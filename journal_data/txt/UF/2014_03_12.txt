City Commission At-Large Seat 2 candidate Helen Warren awaits election results with her partner Florence Turcotte. 
Warren will be competing against candidate Annie Orlando in a runoff election on April 8.    
STAFF REPORT
editor@alligator.org
Tuesday’s City Commission elections 
saw one incumbent re-elected, another vot-
ed out and two candidates facing a runoff election next month. 
Incumbent Todd Chase won District 2 
with 56.95 percent of the votes, according to the Supervisor of Elections ofﬁ  ce web-site. Craig Carter beat out incumbent Susan Bottcher, earning 52.59 percent. At-Large Seat 2 candidates Helen K. Warren and An-nie Orlando will face each other in a runoff election April 8 because neither received the majority of the votes. Warren garnered 45.14 percent, and Orlando came away with 44.05 percent. 
The results showed 10,843 residents — or 
15.06 percent of registered voters — showed 
up to vote, a number that’s consistent with 
previous city elections, said Supervisor of Elections Pam Carpenter.  
Now, Warren and Orlando are encour-
aging more voters to cast ballots in the run-off election.

The Web turns 25 today, and though 
most UF students don’t remember a time 
when the Internet wasn’t around, the uni-versity — and higher education — has changed drastically due to its invention.  
The Internet spun out of labs at universi-
ties such as Dartmouth and Berkley where students had to share computers. The de-velopment of satellite technology during the 1960s space race also contributed to its groundwork.
Andy McCollough, associate provost 
of teaching and technology at UF, said the addition of the Internet has opened up the 
educational process. 
For example, students have information 
more readily accessible, and a geographic 
tie between a class and a student is no lon-ger necessary. 
“What this technology has done has pro-
vided additional opportunities to integrate technology into the classroom,” he said. “As a consequence, it has opened up the teacher-student interchange to opportuni-ties that were previously not available.”
UF launched its ﬁ  rst homepage in Feb-
ruary 1995, joining only 300 other universi-ties, according to Alligator archives. 
Nowadays, it would be nearly impos-
sible to ﬁ  nd a university without one.
The 1995 page included “a catalog of 
courses, telephone and electronic mail directory, information about Gainesville and Alachua County and connections to other colleges’ Web pages,” according to archives.

Alachua County announced last 
week that it has a cardiac arrest save 
rate about three times the national average.
According to the National Car-diac Arrest Registry, in 2007 the na-tional average of patients discharged from the hospital after cardiac arrest was less than about 7 percent.   
Out of the 133 cardiac arrest pa-
tients Alachua County Fire Rescue 
transported between 2012 and 2013, 
28 were discharged from the hospi-tal, which amounts to 21 percent ac-cording to AFCR. 
Bill Northcutt, Alachua County 
Fire Rescue deputy chief of opera-tions, said the ﬁ  re rescue system is one of the reasons for its high sur-
vival rate.
“It’s just because of an aggres-sive team approach that we have re-
sponders throughout the communi-ty so we can provide that advanced treatment process,” he said.
Dr. Jamie Beth Conti, chief of car-
diovascular medicine at UF Health 
Shands Hospital, said cardiac arrest 
means that someone’s heart stops, resulting in the patient’s death — unless there is intervention to pre-vent it.
ACFR Medical Director Christine 
Van Dillen said credit goes to the emergency responders, who “work 
24 hours a day, responding to the 
calls day and night.”Alachua County beats national average for cardiac arrest savesSEE WEB, PAGE 4SEE ELECTIONS, PAGE 4Orlando and Warren in runoffNews Today

Collections manager Gifford Waters displays a Spanish olive jar reconstructed 
from artifacts found at the St. Augustine site. 
AMANDA KASTRINOS

An artifacts collection val-
ued at $3.5 million to the Flor-
ida Museum of Natural His-tory may bring new historical insights into America’s ﬁ  rst Spanish colony.
UF archaeologists have de-
cades of history digging at St. Augustine’s ﬁ  rst settlement, founded by explorer Pedro Menendez in 1565. A dona-tion by the land’s owners, the Fraser family, will allow the study of 97,000 artifacts  found over the years. Arti-facts will eventually join the permanent collection at the museum.
Gifford Waters, a collec-
tions manager for historical archaeology at the museum, said these artifacts, along with remnants of structures found at the site, can provide new understanding into how the settlers lived.
“We can look into how the 
Spaniards adapted to this new land and what they did to be ultimately a successful colony when all these other attempts had failed,” he said.
Thanks to years of care-
ful protection by the Fraser family, the site has remained relatively uncompromised for centuries. Douglas Jones, director of the Florida Muse-um, said this is extremely rare 
for archaeological sites along 
the coast.
“You don’t have to travel 
around Florida very much to 
know most of the coastline 
and coastal properties have 
been developed or altered,” 
Jones said. “We’re very lucky that this site has been pre-served in as great a detail as 
it has.”
Jones said the Fraser fam-
ily realized they would rather 
have the artifacts available to the public than kept in a pri-vate collection.
“It’s a great win-win situ-
ation,” he said. “Knowledge 
increases, and the artifacts are 
cared for at the same time.”
A portion of the artifacts 
are already on display in 
St. Augustine as part of the 
“First Colony: Our Spanish 
Origins” exhibit. It will stay in St. Augustine through the 
end of 2015 and then will be 
on display at UF.
Waters said having the ex-
hibit on campus will not only promote the history of Florida 
but also act as a valuable tool 
for training future archaeolo-
gists and historians. 
Most people, he said, are 
taught that America began 
with British settlements like 
Jamestown and Plymouth 
Rock. 
“Really, it began long be-
fore that with the founding of 
St. Augustine,” he said. “We 
want to get the true history of 
Florida and our nation out to the general public as much as possible.”Museum gets multi-million-
dollar donation of artifacts
97,000 to be studiedsupporters at Tall Paul’s Brew House, 
Warren, 60, said she needs to do more groundwork if she wants to win.
“It was just so close,” she said. “We 
need to take this from a runoff to a win-
ning campaign.”
Warren ended her speech by asking 
the crowd:  “Am I finished?”
Her supporters yelled back “No!” 
in unison.   
However, Orlando, 59, said she’s 
planning to fight hard to beat Warren 
in the runoff. 
She said she believes Warren isn’t 
familiar with the problems City Com-mission faces. Warren hasn’t attended many commission meetings, Orlando said, and it was obvious she was unfa-
miliar with the issues during candidate 
forums. 
The runoff election may make it eas-
ier for voters to differentiate between platforms because they only have to choose between two candidates on the ballot, she said.
“Now it’s just me against her,” she 
said at her post-election reception at the 
Warehouse in downtown Gainesville. 
“People can compare better.” 
While Warren and Orlando are 
preparing to kickstart their campaigns again, Chase is ready to settle into his second term.
Chase said his first order of busi-
ness is to address Gainesville’s trans-portation needs, including routes that primarily service UF and Santa Fe stu-
dents. 
The incumbent ran in 2011 because 
of his mother’s struggle to live on a 
fixed income while city fees and utility bills increased. Though she has since passed away, her influence on Chase’s policies lives on.
“This is the first big accomplish-
ment in my life she hasn’t been here 
for, and her memory will be with me 
for everything I do in public office,” said 47-year-old Chase, standing atop a chair inside the Northwest 43rd Street Beef O’ Brady’s surrounded by family, friends and supporters.
Carter, 54, said once he takes office 
and gets up to speed, he’ll be tackling is-sues such as expanding RTS bus routes 
and fighting increases in Gainesville 
Regional Utilities rates. 
“I feel very humble that the voters 
of District 3 selected me to represent them as city commissioner,” he said.
Bottcher, who will remain on the 
commission until May, said she was surprised she lost.
“I felt really good,” she said soon af-
ter results were displayed at the Super-visor of Elections office. “I was getting a lot of good feedback.”
At about 8 p.m., Bottcher, 56, called 
to congratulate Carter.
She hugged her son and told him, 
“I guess I’ll be spending more time at home.”
Later on in the night, she joined 
Warren and District 2 runner-up Sher-yl Eddie at Tall Paul’s. As supporters sipped on drinks, Warren headed up to the stage of the dimly lit bar to thank volunteers and voice doubts about the future of the commission.
“I feel that I kind of let everybody 
down,” Bottcher told the crowd. “But I feel worse for the City of Gainesville.” 4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, MARCH 12, 2014

The Gator Cricket Club will 
compete as one of more than 24 
college teams today in the Ameri-can College Cricket national championship.
The competition, held at 
the Central Broward Regional Park and Stadium in Lauderhill through Sunday, follows a UF loss to University of South Florida at the 2013 SEC championship.
“The USF game was very 
tough and very close; it went to last ball,” said Sarang Kulkarni, a 22-year-old UF material sciences 
and engineering master’s student.
The club came into the final 
2013 Southeastern Conference 
title game with back-to-back SEC championships, but a majority of the team members graduated dur-ing the time in between, said team captain Aditya Kasinadhuni, 26.
“They did not play like a new 
team (against USF),” he said. “No matter what is ahead of us at na-tionals, we will face it together.”
Lloyd Jodah, founder and pres-
ident of American College Cricket, said cricket is gaining a following in the U.S.“This is our sixth national 
championship, and this year the game will be broadcast on ES-PN3,” Jodah said. “We’re proud to be taking this significant step for cricket in this country.”
Kasinadhuni, a UF third-year 
biomedical engineering Ph.D. candidate, said he started playing cricket as a young boy in Hydera-bad, India. He came to the U.S. in 
2009 and joined the Gator Cricket 
Club in 2011, stepping up as cap-tain this semester.
“In India, cricket is more of 
a religion than it is a sport,” he said.
Kulkarni, who serves as the 
treasurer, said the club’s fund-raising efforts have played a large 
role in the team dynamic, which 
includes a mix of undergraduate, graduate and Ph.D. students.
To raise money, team members 
worked concessions for home football games and held a tennis ball cricket tournament with fi-nancial support from local busi-
ness India Bazaar.
Kulkarni said part of the $2,000 
raised will go toward a new por-
table cricket pitch for the team to practice on.
The practice field has un-
even grass that causes the ball to bounce inconsistently, making it harder for the batters to predict 
its path.
“We just want to get a more 
real experience that is consistent 
with what we will face at compe-titions,” Kulkarni said. “We’ll be able to refine the little things, and that could be game-changing.”

A UF alumnus has taken an unusual career path with 
his law degree — running an online style site aimed at em-
powering women.
Brandon Esposito bought Urban Darling Inc., a Califor-
nia-based professional wardrobe styling website, in Janu-
ary and plans to push the message “We style real people” 
to a new level.
A graduate of the UF Levin College of Law, Esposito, 
26, practiced law at the Intimate Partner Violence Assis-tance Clinic at the college, an experience he said left him with a lot of “anger and frustration” at what he saw.
“I really just wanted to help women push back against 
negative messages they’re getting,” he said.
Esposito and Luisa Lucia, the chief creative officer of 
Urban Darling Inc., revamped the site and pushed for a more diverse crowd of stylists to better accommodate the women they dress. 
Robin McGee, a UF visiting professor and an indepen-
dent costume designer, said the trends in media are shift-ing from an ideal to a reality.
“I think now we’re more interested in the real women 
behind the clothes,” she said.
McGee said designers and clothing departments are 
designing clothes for sizes zero to eight, but the average American woman is between a size 12 and 14.
Gaby Larios, an 18-year-old UF women’s studies fresh-
man, said now that women have more control of the fash-ion industry, the male influence has lessened.
Urban Darling Inc. has received mostly positive re-
sponses following the launch of the new website, although 
there were mixed reviews on the new male leadership.UF alum takes

director of academic technology, wrote 
in an email that UF’s website is the first link with the rest of the world. 
“The University of Florida’s web 
presence is truly our ‘front door’, wel-coming people visiting from around 
the globe,” he said. “In the last com-
pleted academic year, www.ufl.edu re-corded 18,453,622 unique visitors from more than 220 countries.”
Gatorlink debuted in August 1997, offering students free ISIS, email and 
computer lab access. Undergradu-
ates previously paid $20 per term for UF-hosted email addresses. Using the Internet on a computer in dorms cost $60 per semester in the Fall and Spring, according to Alligator archives.
Gatorlink may have been up and 
running in the ‘90s, but many UF stu-dents’ first online experiences came 
years later on AOL. 
Lindsey Jones, a 22-year-old UF 
film and media studies senior, said she remembers playing Neopets and using instant messaging.
“The biggest drama in my life was 
what my away message was going to 
be,” she said.
The advances the Internet has made 
in education are helpful, Jones said, but she considers the Internet somewhat of a crutch as much as a tool. 
“Our parents made it through high 
school and college without Google, so maybe they have something going that we don’t,” she said.wEb , from page 1Actual old screen names of Alligator staffers

The first Student Senate 
meeting after Spring Break 
had a sweet beginning fol-
lowed by a productive end.Before the newly elected 
senators began their meeting, 
Senate President Dylan Fish-er announced that, to help senators understand parlia-
mentary process, they would 
perform a mock procedure passing a resolution in honor 
of ice cream sundaes.
After rounds of debate, 
recording their votes and 
adopting the resolution, sen-
ators put their practice to the 
test and enjoyed bowls of ice cream.
When the official meeting 
began, senators got down to 
business.
While they voted to unan-
imously approve chairs for 
the budget, judiciary, rules 
and ethics, and information 
and communications commit-tees as a block, Sen. Michael Christ opposed the nomina-tion of Sen. Leah Miller for 
the allocations chairwoman 
during public debate.
Christ cited Miller’s lack 
of experience on the alloca-
tions committee vote and her 
vote for a budget “riddled with waste”  as reasons for his opposition.
“I think if we’re going to 
be looking for the most expe-rienced, qualified leaders, we should look to the committee first,” he said. “I’m under no 
illusion of what the likely 
outcome of the vote will be.” 
Despite opposition from 
Christ and rounds of pro-con debate, Miller was voted as 
the allocations chair.WEDNESDAY, MARCH 12, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Last summer, UF mechanical en-
gineering students Trevor Abbott and 
Ty Parker had a unique invention but no way to finance a business.
Thanks to Kickstarter, an online 
crowdfunding platform, they were able to afford to get their company, Spin Chill, off the ground.
Kickstarter, which was founded in 
2009, reached $1 billion in pledges for projects on March 3.  
The crowdfunding model allows 
entrepreneurs to cut out the middle 
man and go straight to the people with 
their product. In return for funding, they provide product-related rewards to their backers.
Entrepreneurs pitch their Kickstart-
er-approved projects in a video and choose a funding goal and deadline. 
If they don’t meet the funding goal in 
time, backers are not charged, and the project dies.
Kickstarter’s funding success rate 
is less than 50 percent, but Gainesville users have been able to raise more than $512,595 in pledges since 2010, accord-ing to the site. 
Abbott, 21, and Parker, 24, invented 
Spin Chill, a device that uses convec-tion to rapidly chill warm beverages. They surpassed their goal of $10,000 by raising more than $40,000 in pledg-es during their Kickstarter campaign, including getting contributions from more than 30 countries.
“Kickstarter is an awesome plat-
form that opened up a market for us, not just in the U.S., but worldwide,” 
Abbott said.
UF professor Bill Rossi, who special-
izes in entrepreneurship and financing 
early stage companies, compared the benefits of Kickstarter to the funding start-up bands get from fans to make an album.
“The only reason to provide the 
money,” Rossi said, “is because you 
believe in the entity to which you are 
contributing and like what they do.”
Tim Elmore, a UF mechanical engi-
neering Ph.D student, used Kickstarter to finance his invention, an at-home fil-ament extruder for 3-D printing called Filastruder.
Filastruder was funded with more 
than $100,000 in the first week of join-
ing Kickstarter. It was the most suc-
cessful Gainesville-based Kickstarter campaign.
Elmore said he had backed several 
Kickstarter projects before and was curious to see how it worked from the creator side. 
Elmore said after spending almost 
all his funding on Filastruder kits to 
send as rewards for backers, he said 
he found his biggest gain was brand recognition.Kickstarter hits billion-

A study co-written by a UF professor is 
taking a closer look at the reproductive habits 
of fruit flies in hopes reducing their popula-tion in Florida.
Lab-sterilized male fruit flies were re-
leased all over the state so that females would 
choose to mate with these flies instead of their 
fertile counterparts. New research published in the Journal of Economic Entomology in February may make this process more effec-tive and less expensive.
Up to $6 million of Florida’s agricultural 
budget is being spent annually to help stop the spread of the Mediterranean fruit fly be-cause of its devastating effect on the state’s agriculture, said Giancarlo Lopez-Martinez, an associate professor of biology at New Mexico State University.
The fruit fly can infest and consume more 
than 200 species of plants, according to the California Department of Food and Agricul-ture.
The last time these flies invaded Florida 
in the 1990s, before this sterilization program was deployed on a large scale, it cost the state more than $20 million to get rid of them, said Daniel Hahn, an associate professor with the Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences at UF.
Previously, the flies were sterilized by ir-
radiation. However, the irradiation made the flies weaker and therefore less competitive 
for the female’s attention, Hahn said. The female flies chose to mate with the healthy, 
fertile fruit flies as a result.
“These are very competitive flies,” he said. 
“They get together in what are called ‘leks’ (an area where a group of animals carry on courtship behavior), where literally dozens of males get together, and it’s kind of like a fly dance club.”
The solution was to introduce a low-oxy-
gen environment while the irradiation pro-
cess is occurring, which allows the male flies 
to maintain their strength after the process.
The research of Hahn and his associates revealed the reason this process works. When the flies are sterilized in the low-oxygen envi-ronments, they produce antioxidants, which have been known to reduce the effects of ag-ing and increase health span, Hahn said.
“Here we’d use the analogy of flies that 
get proportionally sexier as they get older, much like George Clooney,” Hahn said.
This could have further implications for 
farmers and taxpayers alike.
Rose Jean Joseph, a 20-year-old UF food 
and resource economics junior, said she be-lieves the use of this improved research could potentially lead to the use of less pesticide.
“It’s more cost-effective for farmers,” she 
said.
Hahn said if they are able to increase the 
performance of the flies by at least 10 percent, 
it would save about 10 percent of the $6 mil-
lion spent reducing the fruit fly population in Florida.

The History Channel’s “Top Gear” TV 
show filmed in downtown Gainesville on 
Tuesday morning, showcasing vintage mus-cle cars.
Tabitha Lentle, a co-executive producer 
with BBC Worldwide Productions, said Gainesville was chosen for the episode’s set-ting because the town has a “rich history with muscle cars and drag racing.”The U.S. version of the show centers 
around the history of the automobile and fol-lows three hosts on their journeys across the country in various types of cars.
A 1972 Dodge Charger, a 1968 Chevrolet 
Camaro and a 1967 Shelby Mustang Fastback were used for the Gainesville episode.
The production team was partly inspired 
to film in Gainesville because it’s the home to Gatornationals, an annual National Hot Rod Association drag racing event held ev-ery March at the Gainesville Raceway, Lentle said.  
“We wanted to use a town that had a 
theme of Americana,” she said.“Top Gear” hosts Tanner Foust, Rutledge 
Wood and Adam Ferrara were filmed down-town outside the Hippodrome State Theatre and on U.S. Highway 441 at Paynes Prairie.
Ciao Holtz, a 20-year-old student at Uni-
versity Air Center who is studying to be a pilot, said he found out about the show’s ap-pearance from a friend and he went down to the Hippodrome to watch.
They didn’t let him get close while the 
show was being filmed, he said. 
But Holtz said the cast was friendly and 
available for pictures with fans after the show was filmed.
Perry Ciarletta, a 24-year-old express tech-
nician at Gatorland Toyota, said he watched the hosts drive along Paynes Prairie. He said the production crew was careful to film with-out blocking traffic.
“You don’t really expect anything like that 
to happen in this town,” he said.
The episode is expected to air as part of 
season four later in the spring. Car show makes pit stop in Gainesville to film episode

The abortion banners 
need to go
It’s that time of year again: Winter is easing into spring, 
the weather is gradually warming up — and the infamous posters of aborted fetuses are once again on display in high-
trafﬁ  c areas of campus. 
Created Equal is an anti-abortion advocacy group whose 
primary tactic in sparking conversations about abortion in-cludes displaying banners of aborted fetuses. According to Al-ligator archives, the display is “notorious for inducing tears or vomit.”
The executive director of Created Equal told the Alligator 
last year that abortion was a form of ageism, or discrimination based on age.
For those of you who haven’t seen them and suspect your 
Facebook friends are simply being melodramatic, the photos 
truly are gruesome. Tiny ﬁ  ngers clutch quarters and, on its 
website, a video set to autoplay shows body parts of aborted fetuses being handled by doctors.
Shock, obviously, is the easiest way to incite a reaction; 
however, it doesn’t have staying power. 
Regardless of your politics, it’s clear that the Created Equal 
campaign tactics are inefﬁ  cient and bordering on harassment — no one wants to be bombarded with such graphic images, and furthermore, these images are a trigger for women who 
may have previously undergone abortions. 
Although Created Equal organizers claim that shock and 
conversation are their goals, it seems that shame is the tool 
they’re really capitalizing on. 
The organizers have to know what they’re doing. If they 
really wanted to educate students on abortion, they’d hand out pamphlets or other materials that would actually inform rather than disgust or shock students. 
Aside from the fact that the campaign comes across as a cal-
culated attempt to shame women for their personal choices, it seems that reappearing on college campuses every year would only detract from the cause for which they’re supposedly ad-vocating. 
Sooner or later, people who aren’t triggered by the images 
will simply become desensitized to them. 
It comes down to the law of diminishing returns: If they 
keep forcing these images upon students, eventually they’ll lose their impact. Any “Game of Thrones” viewer will tell you 
that by season 3, no one is shocked by graphic beheadings and 
disembowelments. 
The Created Equal campaign, then, is defunct on both sides: 
Those who agree that abortion is, in this case, ageist surely also agree that shock tactics are the wrong way to spark a serious conversation. And those who disagree and believe that abor-tion is a woman’s choice obviously don’t want to see graphic images  on their way to class. 
Of course, we recognize that college campuses are open 
grounds for political and religious organizations to reach out to students. But that doesn’t mean we support shock and shame tactics. Those techniques drive everyone away.

hazed?Today’s question: Are you embarrassed by your ﬁ  rst 
screenname?
Obama’s plan for Venezuela, Ukraine?
Civil unrest is in full bloom for some South Ameri-
can and Eastern European countries. Thousands of protesters in Ukraine and Venezuela — many 
of whom are college-aged students — took to the streets to protest their governments’ wrongdoings.
The Ukraine protesters saw a short-term victory in 
forcing President Viktor Yanukovych from ofﬁ  ce and into Russian refuge. The efforts in Venezuela have not been as successful. Images and videos circulating around the Internet show the military and police brutally beating and ﬁ  ring on the protesters. 
Though these countries seem completely distant and 
their recent developments inconsequential to the average American, these situations do impact our country. 
Think about it: Countries in the modern era are com-
pletely interwoven and heavily rely on each other. The actions in one country can have direct implications for the world economy. Consider all the countries that we import goods from and export goods to — and all the countries that do the same for them. 
So it should be no surprise that nations would want to 
establish credible foreign policy initiatives, but this is a tall order for the U.S. administration. The confusing and 
at times feckless foreign policy put forth by the Obama 
White House harms the already tarnished view of our country abroad. 
To be fair, the president has been successful in deal-
ing with terrorists abroad. His drone policy has been quite effective in dealing with rogue militants who pose a threat to this country. The message is clear and simple: If you are associated with radical groups that want to harm America, the results will be swift and dealt with 
unilaterally.  
But when the administration has to put forth a vision 
of American inﬂ  uence and policy to world leaders, the 
message is completely muddled. 
Will American international interests be protected? 
Will the country back up all the threats and promises it makes? 
Though the White House may be inclined to answer yes to all of these questions, re-ality says otherwise. Remember Obama’s redline in Syria and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s reset button in Russia? 
Our rhetoric seems to say one 
thing while our actions — or in-action — contradict it. 
As NBC White House corre-
spondent Chuck Todd put it, in 
the case of Obama’s handling of Russian President Vladi-mir Putin, “Putin acts, Obama warns; Putin acts, Obama warns.” 
Obama draws a red line in Syria and does not back it 
up; he advocates for the lifting of sanctions on nuclear development in Iran during peace talks, which ironically allows the Iranian nuclear program to progress. 
Despite that no one wants American soldiers in these 
dangerous places, that should not be an excuse for not backing up your tough talk. When you make a stand on the international stage, you should at least justify it. Bring up economic or political ramiﬁ  cations for starters. 
All of the red lines, reset buttons and presidential lec-
tures have not deterred anyone from our foreign foes. Backing down on our own threats undermines the U.S. 
We live in uncertain times. Who would have thought 
that the leader of a European state could be ousted by his own people? Who could have imagined a Cold-War power invading another nation so easily and without re-percussions?   
America’s foreign policy only affects the future. China 
and Japan are butting heads in territorial disputes. North 
Korea is still under the thumb of a madman with nuclear 
weapons. Iran and other countries in the Middle East are still not friends of America.  
If another act of international transgression occurs, 
what will be the response of the U.S.? And more impor-tantly, will anyone take it seriously?

Column about helping drunk friends
Eleni,I wanted you to know that I read your 
recent article in the Alligator and want to commend you for what you’re doing for Molly and the countless students who may beneﬁ  t from her story. 
I was very touched by what you wrote 
and glad to see that you are spreading information that will hopefully save the lives of other students.
I lost a dear friend just before New 
Year’s to a domestic violence crime, and I can understand the pain of losing someone as bright, bubbly and wonderful as I’m certain Molly was. 
Daily I wish I could have done more to 
help, but through sharing the stories of the loved ones we’ve lost, hopefully we can make a difference for those who follow.
Thank you for your beautiful message. 
I’m not sure how often you hear appreciative feedback, but I wanted you to know that I read and I cared!

The Ameri-
can political 
system has 
traditionally exem-
pliﬁ  ed the funda-mental principles of 
democracy.  It is a system that 
Americans take pride in, and among other things, enables them to promote their country as the leader of the free world. 
However, America’s political 
system is not perfect, as it does not prevent those we elect from 
abusing and undermining it. 
Such abuse is currently playing out with the current Republi-can-controlled House of Repre-sentatives.
The GOP and Republican-
controlled House have relent-lessly pursued a mission to bring down President Barack Obama. This mission, which fa-
cilitates the unprecedented at-
tacks on the president, includes blatant disrespect, baseless 
conspiracy theories, character 
viliﬁ  cation and propaganda to 
demonize and ultimately ren-
der him unﬁ  t for presidency. Obama has been called a liar, 
lazy, unpatriotic, a Muslim, a 
racist, divisive, a socialist and 
has even been caricatured as 
Hitler. Their latest mantra is, “he cannot be trusted.”
This obsession has prevent-
ed the GOP from acting in the best interests of the country. Consequently, it is miserably failing to bring down the presi-
dent. The only things it has 
succeeded in doing is shutting down the government, block-ing most of the president’s nominations, calling for in-
vestigations without any real 
evidence of wrongdoing, trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act and blocking efforts to get 
the unemployment beneﬁ  ts 
extended for thousands of un-employed Americans. Having wasted their energy in doing 
these things, it is no surprise 
that the U.S. Congress has the lowest approval rating in history.
So what is it 
about Obama that has driven the GOP and the right-
wing media into this obsessive frenzy to take down the presi-dent? What is it about him, that in trying to destroy him, they do not give any thought about 
the damage they are doing to 
the political system, the country and the American people?
Because the attacks on Presi-
dent Obama are more personal than political, the likely conclu-sion is that his race is the reason for the attacks. Yes, I am play-
ing the “race card” here, but 
what exactly is the race card? It is nothing more than a defense mechanism to shut up people from using race as the cause of 
mistreatment or unfairness to-
ward nonwhite people. In this case, the right-wing media and 
those who want to deny racist 
behavior will try to muzzle any-
one attempting to use racism as 
a reason to any conﬂ  ict involv-ing whites and nonwhites.
Because of its obsession, 
the GOP has been more than 
willing to use hatred, divisive-
ness and fear mongering to the extent that the attacks have reached unprecedented levels. 
The true tragedy is that this ha-
tred of Obama has prevented Congress from accomplishing anything meaningful on the 
major issues like the economy, 
jobs, unemployment, health care, immigration, gun control or energy policy.  This is un-fortunate for the country and 
not a good example for other 
countries that look to America as the leader of the free world. Even more unfortunate is that 
the American people feel aban-
doned by the very people they elected to serve them.

Speaking OutBefore I was a Gator, I was a 
‘Cuda. 
From 2007 to 2011, I was 
fortunate enough to attend Coral Reef Senior High in Miami, home of the Barracudas. 
Coral Reef is consistently ranked as 
one of the top high schools in Florida — No. 13 last year. 
In previous years, Coral Reef has been ranked in 
the top 20 high schools in the entire United States. 
Coral Reef, an all-magnet school, is divided 
into six academies: Agriscience and Engineering, Business and Finance, Legal and Public Affairs, Health Sciences, International Baccalaureate, and Visual and Performing Arts.
Each of these academies focuses on preparing 
students for successful professional careers while also providing them with a holistic liberal education. 
At Coral Reef, the teachers are both well qualiﬁ  ed 
and caring, classes are reasonably sized, and the administration takes its educational mission seriously. 
As a student in the piano division of the VPA 
academy, I received phenomenal instruction not only in traditional subjects like history and math but also in music performance and theory.
Participating in the piano program allowed me 
to both express my passion for music and expand 
my horizons. 
Such opportunities should be fundamental 
components of every American student’s 
education.
Unfortunately, the excellence of Coral Reef is 
an exception among American high schools and certainly not the norm. 
Recent evidence suggests that American students 
are falling behind their peers around the world.
The results of the 2012 PISA, an exam taken by 
high school students worldwide, are the clearest evidence yet that the education system in the United States is failing. 
Among the 34 member countries of the 
Organization on Economic Cooperation and Development, the U.S. ranked 26th in math, 21st in reading and 17th in science. 
Even at Coral Reef, budget constraints have 
resulted in cuts to educational programs and increased reliance on online education, which is a poor substitute for the meaningful interactions between teachers and students on which the school 
prides itself. 
Last Friday, President Barack Obama and ﬁ  rst 
lady Michelle Obama visited Coral Reef to promote 
expanded access to higher education. 
“We heard great things about your school,” 
Obama said during his speech in the jam-packed Coral Reef gymnasium. “We wanted to come down here and see what was going on.”
The president announced a new 
program to increase the number of students who complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid. 
The FAFSA helps connect high 
school seniors around the country to 
nearly $150 billion in federal and state student aid.
Obama also called on Congress to approve $1 
billion in education initiatives included in his most 
recent budget proposal.
Although Obama’s emphasis on improving 
access to higher education is a welcome step in 
the right direction, the problems the American 
education system faces require bold action and 
fundamental reforms.
According to the Center on Budget Policy and 
Priorities, only 14 states increased education funding between 2009 and 2014. 
Florida cut its education budget by 3.9 percent 
during those years. 
In many states, education funding has been 
increasingly directed toward charter schools, which 
are highly unaccountable and have not improved 
educational outcomes. 
According to a Washington Post report, 56 
percent of charter schools nationwide produced no signiﬁ  cant effect on reading proﬁ  ciency among 
American students. 
In addition, 40 percent of charter schools had no 
demonstrated effect on the students’ math skills. 
In many cases, the charter schools produced 
signiﬁ  cantly worse results than in traditional public 
schools. 
Online education, pioneered by proﬁ  t-seeking 
business owners like Neil Bush, has also become a favorite pet project of lawmakers across the 
country.
While politically well-connected charter school 
owners and online education executives siphon 
off a growing share of these budgets, the public 
education system continues to languish.
In the new global economy, the countries that 
do the best job of educating their citizens will be 
the ones that experience the greatest prosperity, stability and peace. 
Every American student deserves a world-class 
education of the kind I received as a student at Coral Reef. 
If our federal and state governments make the 
necessary investments in education, the United States will maintain its position as a global leader and role model through the 21st century and beyond.

MIAMI — A May 5 trial date was set Tuesday 
for Justin Bieber in the Florida case charging him 
with driving under the influence, resisting arrest 
and possessing an invalid driver’s license.
Prosecutor Daniel Diaz-Balart also said at a brief 
hearing that no plea offer has been made for the 20-
year-old pop singer, who has pleaded not guilty. 
Bieber’s attorney, Roy Black, said there was no plea 
deal on the table and none had been rejected, even though first offenders in most similar cases are of-fered a plea to avoid potential jail time.
“All we’re going to say is, we’re going to pre-
pare for a trial and that Mr. Bieber has pleaded not guilty,” Black told reporters.
The initial March trial date was postponed while 
attorneys for news organizations and Bieber wres-
tled with the release of police videos of him giving 
a urine sample for a drug test. Those videos were made public last week with sensitive segments blacked out.
Bieber and R&B singer Khalil Amir Sharieff were 
arrested Jan. 23 in Miami Beach after what police called an illegal drag race with high-end sports cars. Breath tests showed Bieber’s blood-alcohol content was below the 0.02 limit for underage drivers. Oth-
er tests detected marijuana and Xanax.
Miami-Dade County Judge William Altfield said 
Sharieff has a separate April 7 trial date on a DUI 
charge. He, too, has pleaded not guilty.
Black was also asked about a deposition Bieber 
gave last week in a lawsuit filed by a photographer who claims he was roughed up and threatened by one of the singer’s bodyguards. Video of that de-position quickly began appearing on Internet sites, 
which Black criticized Tuesday as an invasion of 
Bieber’s privacy.
Among other things, Black said, Bieber was 
asked in the deposition about topics such as his re-lationships with singers Selena Gomez and Usher 
“that had nothing to do with the case.” A judge pre-
viously denied motions to keep Bieber’s deposition sealed, he added.
“He has absolutely no privacy,” Black said.

A local restaurant has changed its 
name, but the menu, service and staff 
have remained mostly intact.
Gainesville establishment KC 
Crave transformed into The Mix Bis-tro, debuting under the new title Feb. 26 in the same Second Avenue loca-
tion. 
The name change comes after local 
owners Tiff Murphy and Tom Mowry 
bought out other ownership partners for the KC Crave Gainesville loca-
tion, said assistant general manager 
Mystry Faith. The partners at the oth-er location in Jacksonville Beach still own their shares. 
Faith said the owners wanted a fresh start after taking control of the restaurant.
“They wanted to envision what 
we do here, which is a mix,” she said. 
“We do live music, we have a bour-
bon bar, we’re revamping our wine list … We needed a fun, energetic name to go along with that.”
Faith said the core menu is not 
changing. 
However, the restaurant will put 
more emphasis on its seasonal spe-cials. 
It will also focus on using produce 
and meats grown by local farmers.
Rosellen Hatch, 58, said she and 
her husband attended the grand opening. 
They routinely drive from their 
home in Keystone Heights to visit the restaurant, especially when it hosts  “Gator Hotline,” a radio call-in show featuring head coaches of Florida Gators athletic teams.
Faith said shows like “Gator 
Hotline” have become a factor in the identity that the restaurant has tried to establish — something that won’t 
change with the name change. 
“We want people to be entertained 
when they’re here,” she said, “and 
that’s a form of entertainment.”Restaurant mixes it up with name change

Orange County’s animal shelter has 
decided to no longer categorize and 
formally identify dogs by breed, and a 
local group sees value in adopting the 
same approach in Gainesville.
However, Alachua County Animal 
Services plans to continue sharing 
information about the breeds.
Orange County, which includes  
Orlando, made the move to combat 
stigmatization and low adoption rates among pit bull mixes.
Vernon Sawyer, the Alachua County Animal Services director, said the local shelter adopts out a lot of pit bulls and pit bull mixes.
“Pit bulls get a bad rep,” Sawyer said. 
“They’re absolutely a very good dog. I own pits myself.”
Sawyer said Orange County’s idea may 
be worth looking into. 
Dogs are frequently identified on a 
best-guess basis, he said. “It’d be interesting to see their stats 
down the road to see if it increases their adoptions and how it works,” Sawyer said.
Anna Peterson, a volunteer with local 
organization Plenty of Pit Bulls, said Orange County made a great decision.
“Appearance in mixed breeds is a really 
poor guide to breed,” Peterson said. “It’s 
also a really poor guide to determining 
temperament.”
Peterson said she hasn’t noticed much 
fear or distrust toward the breeds in the area, despite stigmatization.
“It’s kind of like with black people or 
gay people or any other category that’s stigmatized,” Peterson said. “Once you get to know some, you realize they’re not that different.”
Amie Kreppel, a UF political science 
associate professor, has fostered seven 
dogs for Plenty of Pit Bulls.
She said the stigma surrounding pit-
bull breeds is the result of ignorance. 
When people meet the dog she’s 
currently fostering, Jade, a 72-pound pit 
lab mix, they can’t believe she’s a pit bull, Kreppel said. 
“Because there is a stereotype of the big 
massive dog that is going to chew your 
face off or whatever, people just make 
assumptions,” she said.
Kreppel said dogs in shelters should be 
categorized by things more important than 
breed, such as size or activity level.Local shelters will keep identifying adoptable dogs by breed KC Crave is now The Mix“They wanted to envision

Wine gets better with age, but adults’ 
alcohol tolerance doesn’t. 
A recent UF study tested the effects 
of alcohol on adults’ driving skills and 
compared how participants in two age ranges, 25 to 35 and 55 to 70, performed. 
It was conducted by Sara Jo Nixon, a UF 
professor in the departments of psychiatry and psychology, along with graduate research assistant Alfredo Sklar.
The study tested adults of similar height 
and weight who had consumed the same amount of alcohol with the only difference being participants’ ages. 
The research began by performing 
a baseline assessment in which the participants did not consume any alcohol.
“Across all the measures, we saw that 
the older adults’ were impaired to younger adults’, and that again is before they had any alcohol,” said Sklar, 29.
Next the participants were given low 
to moderate doses of alcohol, and results showed that the older adults were more significantly affected by the alcohol.
The lower doses that pushed older 
adults’ blood alcohol level to 0.065 produced effects in their driving.
“That dose seemed to exhibit jerkier 
steering and more variability in their speed,” he said. 
He said there’s no difference in how 
younger and older adults metabolize alcohol because both groups were given the same amount.
“Younger and older adults were at the 
same intoxication blood alcohol level, and we still see these differences on top of that,” he said.
Sklar said his research team wants to 
raise awareness with this study and draw attention to the fact that there still might be some risks to having one or two drinks.
“Even minimal amounts, definitely below 
the 0.08 level, do have real implications for driving safety,” Sklar said. 
He said many studies have touted the 
benefits of drinking for older adults such as from consuming a glass of wine a day, but not much is said about the acute risks. 
“A lot of times when people look at 
the risks of drinking alcohol, they’re looking at much higher dose levels,” Sklar said. “Besides just car accidents, you have unintentional injuries that occur at higher rates at lower levels of alcohol consumption.”
Robert Webber, a 49-year-old UF 
alumnus, is a marketing manager for a beer distributing company in Ocala. 
He said he frequently takes new product 
samples home with him, so his home is usually stocked with beer.
“I work with it every day, and I still feel 
a buzz after a couple,” Webber said.
Judith Nogues, a 42-year-old Micanopy 
resident, said she’s in touch with her limits after consuming alcohol.
“I like to drink wine every now and then 
at home, but I never drive afterward,” she said. “I know how I get after one glass.”

� CRIMEA HAS BEEN THE 
NEWS’ FOCUS LATELY.

The first thing Nataliya 
Dmytrochenko does when 
she wakes up every morning is pick up her iPad to read the news about Ukraine.
“I check it to make sure the 
country’s not fully invaded,” she said, adding she’s worried about what could happen to her brother, mother and grand-mother who all live in various parts of Ukraine.
For the past three months, 
Ukrainians have protested the 
government’s decision to not 
become associated with the European Union, which would allow for open trade. Protests turned into riots.
The area wasn’t always like 
this, said 31-year-old Dmytro-chenko, who moved from Ukraine to the U.S. more than 
four years ago to earn her Ph.D. 
at UF in international commu-nication and immigration. She said that when she left Ukraine, it was mostly democratic with-out serious problems.
Recently, President Vladi-
mir Putin declared the new Ukrainian government ille-
gitimate to justify his involve-
ment in the region. Unmarked troops have occupied Crimea, the southern part of Ukraine next to Russia, according to news reports. These troops are rumored to be Russian because Crimea, bordered by the Black 
Sea where Russian navy fleets 
are stationed, has valuable sea access. Russia denies the troops are its own.
UF political science pro-
fessor George Esenwein said Russia is trying to establish its power.
“There are some techni-
cal rights that Russia is using where they can bring in an X number of troops, which clearly they are abusing,” he said.
The U.S. has tried to diffuse 
the situation by threatening tough economic sanctions and sending diplomats to resolve the problem.
But Paul D’Anieri, dean of 
UF’s College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and a professor specializing in the region, said “there’s just not enough be-tween the U.S. and Russia to make anything happen.”
As for Dmytrochenko, she 
said she doesn’t know what 
the future holds for Ukraine if 
Crimea becomes part of Russia.
“I’ve spoken to my family 
there, and they all want to live in Ukraine,” she said. “They don’t understand why Putin is coming to save them.”Ukraine conflict hits 
home for UF student THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
KUALA LUMPUR, Malay-
sia — The missing Boeing 777 jet-
liner changed course over the sea, crossed Malaysia and reached the Strait of Malacca — hundreds of 
miles from its last position recorded 
by civilian authorities, Malaysian military officials said Tuesday, cit-ing military radar data.
The development added confu-
sion and mystery into one of most puzzling aviation incidents of re-cent, and it has raised questions about why the Malaysia Airlines 
flight was not transmitting signals 
detectable by civilian radar, why its crew was silent about the course change and why no distress calls were sent after it turned back.
Many experts have been work-
ing on the assumption there was a catastrophic event on the flight — such as an explosion, engine failure, 
terrorist attack, extreme turbulence, 
pilot error or even suicide. The di-rector of the CIA said in Washing-ton that he still would not rule out terrorism.
Flight MH370, carrying 239 peo-
ple, took off from Kuala Lumpur at 12:41 a.m. Saturday, bound for Beijing. Authorities initially said its 
last contact with ground controllers 
was less than an hour into the flight at a height of 35,000 feet, when the plane was somewhere between the east coast of Malaysia and Viet-nam.
But local newspaper Berita Hari-
an quoted Malaysia’s air force chief, Gen. Rodzali Daud, as saying that 
radar at a military base had tracked the jet as it changed its course, with 
the final signal at 2:40 a.m. showing the plane to be near Pulau Perak at the northern approach to the Strait of Malacca, a busy waterway that 
separates the western coast of Ma-
laysia and Indonesia’s Sumatra is-land. It was flying slightly lower, at around 29,528 feet, he said.
“After that, the signal from the 
plane was lost,” he was quoted as saying.
Authorities had said earlier the 
plane may have tried to turn back to 
Kuala Lumpur, but they expressed 
surprise it would do so without in-forming ground control.
The search was initially focused 
hundreds of miles to the east, in waters off Vietnam, with more than 40 planes and ships from at least 10 
nations searching the area without 
finding a trace of the missing air-craft. 
Earlier Tuesday, Malaysia Air-
lines said in a statement that search-and-rescue teams had expanded their scope to the Strait of Malacca. An earlier statement said the west-
ern coast of Malaysia was “now the 
focus,” but the airline subsequently said that phrase was an oversight. It didn’t elaborate.
Civil aviation chief Azharuddin 
Abdul Rahman said the search re-mained “on both sides” of Malay-sia. 
Attention will now likely focus on the condition of the Boeing 777’s electronic systems as it charted its new course back toward and then across Malaysia.
Malaysian police chief Khalid 
Abu Bakar, who has been ordered to look at possible criminal aspects in the disappearance of Flight MH370, said hijacking, sabotage and issues related to the pilots’ psychological health were all being considered.
Also Tuesday, Malaysian and 
international police authorities said two people who boarded Flight 
MH370 with stolen passports were 
Iranians who had bought tickets to Europe, where they were planning to migrate. Their presence on the flight had raised speculation of a possible terrorist link.
Malaysian police chief Khalid 
Abu Bakar said investigators had determined one was a 19-year-old 
Iranian, Pouria Nourmohammadi 
Mehrdad. “We believe he is not likely to be a member of any terror-ist group,” Khalid said.
Interpol identified the second 
man as Seyed Mohammed Reza Delavar, a 29-year-old Iranian, and released an image of the two board-ing at the same time. Interpol Secre-tary General Ronald K. Noble said 
the two men traveled to Malaysia 
on their Iranian passports, then ap-parently switched to their stolen Austrian and Italian documents. 
CIA Director John Brennan said 
in Washington that Malaysian au-thorities “are looking very carefully at what went wrong.”
He also said there has been “a lot 
of speculation right now — some claims of responsibility that have 
not been, you know, confirmed or 
corroborated at all. We are looking at it very carefully.”

The Gators finished their best regu-
lar season in school history on Satur-
day, and on Tuesday, they received the hardware to prove it.
Of the Southeastern Conference’s 
six major individual awards, the league awarded all but one to Florida. 
The SEC’s coaches voted Billy 
Donovan as Coach of the Year, Scottie Wilbekin as Player of the Year, Patric Young as Defensive Player of the Year and Scholar-Athlete of the Year and Dorian Finney-Smith as Sixth Man of the Year. 
Kentucky’s Julius Randle, who was 
named Freshman of the Year, was the only non-Gator to win an individual  award.
The 2012 national champion Wild-
cats were the only other team to claim five of the six awards in a single year. Young played spoiler that year for 
Kentucky by capturing his first of three 
Scholar-Athlete of the Year honors.
“Any individual honor, to me, is 
just a reflection on your team,” Dono-van said. Gators rack up SEC awards 
after perfect league slate

Will Muschamp, 10 min-
utes into his half-hour press 
conference, uttered the word 
“opportunity” seven times in 
a span of three sentences. 
A month away from the 
spring game, players have 
the opportunity to get a head 
start on a talented recruiting class and a chance to move on from a disastrous 4-8 sea-son. 
They have nothing but 
opportunity. They stunk last year. 
It’s the kind of year that 
puts coaches’ jobs on life sup-port and players on notice. 
What the Gators have 
in front of them is a second chance, an opportunity they 
can’t pass up and one that 
starts with practice No. 1 on March 19.
“You find out about the 
guys who really want to be a part of the program when you go through something like that. Those guys that are here are working their butts off,” Muschamp said Tues-day afternoon. 
“I see a great work ethic 
and a great resolve with this group. There’s a lot of accountability within the 
team.”
The Gators head into 
spring practice with new 
offensive coordinator Kurt 
Roper, who has the gaudy 
task of spreading out and fix-ing the nation’s 113th-ranked offense. 
Redshirt junior quarter-
back Jeff Driskel is getting his first action since fractur-ing the fibula in his right leg in September. Roper is the 
third offensive coordina-tor Driskel has played for at 
Florida.
Eleven offensive linemen 
give Muschamp the most 
flexibility he’s had at UF. 
Having only six healthy line-men last season turned the spring game into a glorified 
practice. 
Six starters return to a 
defense that hasn’t ranked 
outside the top 15 in Mus-champ’s first three seasons.
Florida will be without 
nine players to start. Defen-sive tackle Leon Orr (wrist) and running back Matt Jones 
(knee) headline those miss-
ing time. 
The two will miss all 
of spring and expect to be cleared on May 1.
“At this time of the year, 
there are a couple of things you’re looking for: a be-lief and confidence in what 
we’re doing. I see that with 
our team,” Muschamp said. 
“Generally, what you put UF eager to start spring practicefootbAll
� SNEAD HAS POSTED A 2.25 ERA IN 
NINE APPEARANCES THIS SEASON.
ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
Alligator Staff Writer @alichtenstein24
Kirby Snead does not appear to be an in-
timidating pitcher.
The Alachua native doesn’t throw par-
ticularly hard — his fastball usually clocks 
in around 85 mph — but he has been setting down opposing batters in short order since the season began.
“Kirby’s numb,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan 
said. “I don’t think he knows any better than just come in and throw strikes. We’ve made his role very simple, we’ve kept it simple for him. It’s not complicated. He’s got a different angle that left-handed hitters don’t like. 
“Just keep throwing low strikes and don’t 
over-analyze it.”
Snead, who routinely faces one or two 
batters as a lefty specialist, has posted a 2.25 
ERA over four innings in nine appearances 
— but that is only the third-best mark among pitchers with three or more appearances out of the pen for the Gators (10-6) this season.“Not enough can be said about our pitch-
ing [against Connecticut],” catcher Taylor Gushue said. “It was absolutely unbeliev-able. Every key situation, they did their job.”
The Florida pitching staff 
as a whole has a 3.04 ERA, but that number drops to 2.12 among pitchers who have made at least half of 
their appearances out of the 
bullpen this season.
Like Snead, the rest of the 
freshman class has played a 
pivotal role relieving UF’s starters.
First-year pitchers have accounted for 23 
of the 76.2 bullpen innings for the Gators this season and have put up a 2.35 ERA. They will need to continue their success as Florida plays Illinois State (8-4) tonight at 7 p.m. at 
McKethan Stadium and begins Southeastern 
Conference play on Friday against Arkansas (8-5).
“SEC play, it’s a new season,” Gushue 
said he tells freshmen. “We’re playing for that ring.”
But it isn’t only freshmen who have been Freshman left-hander part 
of thriving Florida bullpen

UF coach
“And whatever awards are 
given out or whatever hon-
ors are given out to any of our guys, I think they would be the first one to say, ‘Without 
my teammates, this would 
not have been possible.’ Even though one individual is be-ing honored, I think everybody shares in that.”
Donovan earned the award 
for the second straight year and third time in four seasons. The 18th-year coach became just the 
fourth coach in SEC history to 
earn the honor in back-to-back seasons. 
Wilbekin joins Chandler 
Parsons as the only Gators to have won the league’s highest prize for players. 
Averaging 12.9 points per 
game, the senior point guard 
had his best scoring season of 
his career while remaining true to his defensive skillset.
Despite the honor, Wilbekin 
said he doesn’t even see himself as Florida’s best player.
“I would say we’re all equal, 
especially the five starters,” Wilbekin said. 
“You throw any of our 
players into a different role, I think you would see the same outcome. I think this award could’ve went to Pat and Casey (Prather) as well. I don’t take too much credit.”
Young became the only 
player in SEC history to have 
won Scholar-Athlete of the 
Year three times. The senior center also became the second Gator to earn Defensive Player of the Year. Corey Brewer split the award with LSU’s Tyrus Thomas in 2006.
Although Young finished the year 20th in the SEC in de-fensive rebounds and tied for 18th in blocks, his presence in the paint has always caused 
tough shots for opponents. Ac-
cording to Sports-Reference.com, the 6-foot-9 center has a 91.6 defensive rating, which estimates the number of points allowed against a player in 100 possessions.
Only Will Yeguete’s 90.0 rat-
ing ranks higher on the team.
“I’m usually in the right 
place so I don’t have to be a shot blocker,” Young said. “I’m not an Anthony Davis-type guy or a Nerlens Noel. It’s just nice to be recognized for doing the right things by all the coaches on the committee and the peo-ple that voted me to win this 
award.”
Finney-Smith, who started 
30 games as a freshman for Vir-
ginia Tech during the 2011-2012 season, started only two games this year under Donovan. How-ever, as the first player off the bench, the 6-foot-8 forward led the team with 6.9 rebounds per 
game.
He was also a threat on the 
perimeter, knocking down 37.8 
percent of his three-point at-tempts.
In addition to the five indi-
vidual awards, Wilbekin and Prather were named to the All-SEC First Team while Young 
was named to the Second 
Team.
“There’s not a drop-off from 
a guy here on this team,” Young said. 
“Everyone just gets along 
and really wants to love each other and do whatever it takes to win. Just that alone, I think 
that puts us in a better posi-
tion to accomplish things we haven’t done before.”Wilbekin second 
Gator to win POYin is what you get out. I think our guys are 
putting in a lot right now and I’m pleased with where we are.”
Muschamp watched the No. 1 Florida 
men’s basketball team beat Kentucky by 19 points in the O’Connell Center on Saturday. He saw a unit — one that he called a true 
team — that his players can learn from. 
Those players finished 2013 on a sev-
en-game losing streak. Injuries broke the 
Gators. 
Now, while spring practice gives them the 
opportunity to pick up the pieces, they aren’t forgetting the embarrassment.
“I don’t know that you can put the season 
behind you at all,” Muschamp said. 
“You need to have a good memory for 
that and not let it happen again. We’ve talked about those sorts of things, but our guys are hungry. Our guys are working hard. 
“At the end of the day you shut up and have a good memory. That’s kind of been our motto around here.”
Green getting healthier: Along with Max 
Garcia, redshirt senior Chaz Green is expect-ed to anchor an offensive line that must im-prove from a year in which its position coach was let go, its opponents sacked the quarter-
back 27 times and its running backs averaged 
3.6 yards per carry.
Green, who started 10 games in 2012, 
missed last season due to a torn labrum he suffered in fall camp. 
He’s always been a hard worker, but Mus-
champ has seen Green up the ante.
“When something is taken away, some-
times you realize how important it is to you,” 
Muschamp said.
 “I’m out in here last Friday before spring 
break, and he’s in here Friday afternoon, 
working out and absolutely grinding. The guy has been a great example for our entire 
offseason program in how he’s handled him-
self and how he’s worked.” 14, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, MARCH 12, 2014
Harris, Rhodes also anchoring bullpen
major contributors to the bullpen 
this season.
Junior Ryan Harris and sopho-
more Aaron Rhodes have posted sub-1 ERAs so far this season. 
In their 26 combined innings 
in 2014, the duo has surrendered only two runs on 18 hits while striking out 14 batters. 
Harris has specialized in short 
relief, with seven of his nine ap-pearances lasting an inning or fewer. 
Rhodes has been the exact op-
posite. All but two of his appearances 
have lasted at least two innings, including a 4-inning save against FGCU on March 1 and a 3.2-in-
ning win over Southern Missis-
sippi in relief on March 4.
“We have confidence in him,” 
O’Sullivan said after Rhodes’ four-inning outing. “We showed 
a vote of confidence, and, obvi-
ously, he pitched very well.”
Lately, O’Sullivan has been 
mixing up his rotation, moving freshman Logan Shore to the Friday-night spot against the Huskies and putting junior Bob-
by Poyner in the bullpen despite 
multiple successful starts.The 6-foot left-hander re-
sponded with three consecutive scoreless outings, notching the win in the series clincher on Sat-
urday and securing the sweep on 
Sunday.
“Whenever duty calls, you got 
to get it done,” Poyner said. 
In his three relief appearances, 
Poyner has pitched 2.1 innings, striking out two and giving up 
only one hit.
“It’s really the same,” Poyner 
said. 
“You still got to make pitches 
in quality situations. You execute those pitches and you’ll do well. 
If you don’t, the opposite.”base , from page 13

No. 4 Florida is moving on up.
After a string of home wins and 
two big wins on the road, the Gators (7-1, 1-0 American Lacrosse Confer-
ence) have climbed back to where it 
started in the preseason poll before 
its season-opening loss against No. 
1 North Carolina.
But with a game against Win-
throp (2-3) tonight and an even big-ger matchup against No. 3 Syracuse 
(6-1) on Saturday, Florida lacrosse 
will have to fight to stay among the top-five teams.
Coach Amanda O’Leary is look-
ing to assistant coach Michelle Tu-molo, a Syracuse alum, to lead Flor-ida through the week’s matchups.
“Syracuse is a huge challenge 
for us,” O’Leary said. “They are an exceptional lacrosse team. They are [No. 3] in the country and it’s a 
well-deserved [No. 3]. They have 
a fast-paced offense. Their defense 
is an older, more mature group. … 
Hopefully, Michelle will help us in preparation.”
With Florida’s solid defense and 
speedy offense, the team should 
cruise past unranked Winthrop, 
which has faltered in more games 
than it has won this season. 
Though the defense has played 
tough in its last three games, senior 
defender Krista Grabher said that even with the defense’s massive 
improvement over its first seven games, it still needs a lot of work.
“The defense has a lot to work 
on,” Grabher said. “We prepare 
specifically for each and every team. 
So a lot of focus, the attack is always 
refining the same thing.”
Freshmen defenders Caroline 
Fitzgerald and Taylor Bresnahan 
and junior midfielder Shannon 
Gilroy have been big facilitators in leading Florida through most of its 
blowout wins and Florida’s nail-biting, 14-13 victory over No. 12 
Loyola.
“[Bresnahan and Fitzgerald] 
have come in and been able to work 
with what we have going on and easily put themselves in the de-
fense,” Grabher said.
Fitzgerald has been credited by 
teammates like Grabher and sopho-
more Sam Darcangelo for her strong 
defensive abilities. The freshman has caused seven turnovers this 
season and contributed 12 ground 
balls and two draw controls.
Darcangelo said starting fresh-
men like Fitzgerald and Bresnahan 
don’t have room for errors.
“They have to be good,” Dar-
cangelo said. 
“We lost a lot of seniors, and 
they have to make up for that — es-pecially the starters.”
Bresnahan has one goal on two 
shots, five ground balls, five draw controls and three caused turnovers for the season.
These two freshmen, with the 
leadership of Grabher, have helped 
put together a whole new defense after losing most of its starters to 
graduation in 2013. 
O’Leary has started Fitzgerald in every game this season and rec-ognizes what a threat she can be to 
attackers.
“I’m really pleased she’s a fresh-
man and we’re going have some more years with her,” O’Leary 
said. 
“She came to us well-seasoned. 
… With each game, we give her more and more responsibility, and she’s lining up against teams’ best attackers. I don’t know if there is 
anymore recognition for her to earn than being put up against teams 
top-10.”

EMILY COCHRANE
Alligator Writer @EmilySCochrane
Following its best performance of the sea-
son two weeks ago at the 2014 Allstate Sugar 
Bowl Intercollegiate Championship, No. 17 Florida looks to continue its success at its only home tournament of the season. 
The Gators host 13 teams, including No. 
8 Oklahoma and No. 10 Arizona, at the Sun-Trust Gator Women’s Golf Invitational this weekend at the Mark Bostick Golf Course. The three-day tournament begins Friday morning after a practice round Thursday evening and continues through Sunday.
“We get to play at home only once a year, 
so it’s a big week for us,” coach Emily Glaser said. “I know the girls are really excited, get-ting to play a golf course we’re familiar with and that we play week in and week out.” 
The Gators finished 
third last season and won 
the tournament in 2011 and 2012. 
Despite previous suc-
cess, Glaser said the team is avoiding placing ad-ditional emphasis on this tournament.
“Obviously, the girls 
want to play well, and we’ll talk this week about expectations,” Glaser said. 
“There’s always a little more pressure 
playing at home — especially for us, since we only do it once a year.
“The girls have to understand that it’s just 
golf. It’s the same at home as it would be if 
we go anywhere else. You still have to make 
the right shots, you just have to get into that one-shot-at-a-time mentality that you would whether you were playing at home or not.”
After finishing in the bottom half of the lea-
derboard in the first two tournaments of the season, Glaser saw the team’s performance in New Orleans as an encouraging sign for the rest of the spring season. 
“Finishing third in New Orleans was big 
for us,” Glaser said. “We played the last day with the No. 1 and 2 teams in the country, and I was really proud of the way the girls responded.“In golf, you sort of measure yourself by 
how good are your mistakes, and I think that’s what they saw with playing with a 
couple of the top teams.”
Freshman Maria Torres took first place 
in the Gators lineup for the weekend af-
ter tying for third in New Orleans with the lowest score of her collegiate career. Junior Sarah Schober and redshirt sophomore Katie Mitchell also made the lineup after successful performances in New Orleans. 
Junior Camilla Hedberg and senior Elcin 
Ulu, the only two players to have previously competed in the tournament, will also com-pete this weekend. 
“It’s a big week for us,” Glaser said. “We’re 
excited and we’re just ready to get started.”

Day 2 of the NCAA Zone “B” 
Diving Regional Championships 
wrapped up with two divers in 
the finals for the Gators, but nei-
ther qualified for the national championships being held later this month.
The top nine divers in the fi-
nals advance from the 43-women field to the NCAA meet, which starts on March 20. 
Sophomore Kahlia Warner 
was in position to be the first Gator in two years to advance past regionals after finishing pre-lims in eighth place on the 3-me-ter springboard.
Going last in the diving order 
was an advantage for Warner. 
She started off strong, moving 
up to seventh place after the first of six dives in the final. But she couldn’t hold on. A meager four-point differ-
ence kept her from advancing, as she slipped to 12th place at the 
conclu-sion of Day 2. 
War-
ner was only two places away from qualifying in Monday’s 1-meter springboard final, finish-ing in 11th place but more than nine points behind ninth place.
Sophomore Delaney Dye 
placed 24th on Tuesday in the 3-meter board prelims and missed the finals after a 17th-place finish in Monday’s final.
Florida’s men had a better per-
formance than they did on Day 1
Redshirt senior Chris Jones 
made the 1-meter finals with just 3.3 points separating him from 
missing out on the action.
The smaller men’s field of 32 
competitors advances only seven 
divers, and Jones fell 10 places behind that mark. 
Although he moved up a spot 
to 17th place in the finals, his score was almost 15 points lower than his prelim performance.
Similar to Monday’s outing, 
sophomore Zach Hernandez 
placed in the back of the pack by 
finishing his event in 30th place Tuesday.
The Gators will still have two 
more chances to make NCAAs to-day as both the men and women take to the platforms on the third and final day of competition.

After winning its ﬁ  rst Southeastern Confer-
ence series against Ole Miss, No. 1 Florida (24-
1, 2-1 SEC) will take a break from league play with a home doubleheader against Mercer (17-
7, 2-1 Atlantic Sun) starting today at 4 p.m.
Mercer has power throughout its lineup, 
with all nine of its starters accruing a slugging percentage of at least .411.
The Gators are going to try to ﬁ  nd a way 
to slow down the Bears, who have won nine games in six innings or fewer this season, by 
avoiding miscues on defense.
Florida boasts a .984 ﬁ  elding percentage 
this season, ranking third in the SEC.
Through 25 games, the Gators have com-
mitted only 11 errors on defense, compared to 
the 14 they created at this point last season.
“We put a lot of stock in our defense,” coach 
Tim Walton said. “We take a lot of pride in it. 
That’s what we work hard on every single day. 
If you ever ask me about letdowns, we can’t let down defensively.”
Against Ole Miss on Sunday, Florida’s in-
ﬁ  eld made several key grabs early in the con-
test. In the second inning, second baseman 
Kirsti Merritt made a running catch in foul ter-ritory for the ﬁ  rst out of the frame.One inning later, third baseman Stephanie 
Tofft caught a pop-up bunt in foul territory 
and ﬁ  rst baseman Taylor Schwarz ran into a 
wall in foul territory to get the second out of 
the inning.
“We kind of make it a challenge for us, try 
to see who can catch a ball that’s over the net, 
running into the wall, things like that,” Tofft said. “It’s a fun challenge for us to try and get 
as many outs like that and making good defen-
sive plays. It’s kind of our thing.”
Tofft, Kelsey Stewart and Lauren Haeger, 
who combine for 88 of UF’s 180 RBIs, will 
spark Florida’s offense against Mercer.
After plating only two hits through Florida’s 
ﬁ  rst six games of the season, Tofft rebounded and has been a force on offense. The Lincoln, 
Calif., native is tied with Aubree Munro with 
a team-leading ﬁ  ve doubles, and she is second 
only to Haeger with 28 RBIs and four home runs.
“We’ve got some really good, talented play-
ers and some kids that really do a good job,” Walton said. No. 1 Florida softball preparing for power-hitting Mercer squad
“We put a lot of stock in our 
defense. We take a lot of pride in it.”
