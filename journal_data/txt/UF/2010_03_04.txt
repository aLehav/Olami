UF, UPD hold meeting to discuss
Police: the 35-year-old student not critically injured
By KATHERINE BEIN
and MINCH MINCHIN
Alligator Writers
University officials, campus police and
Corry Village apartment managers held
two meetings Wednesday with about 75
residents to explain Tuesday's shooting of
a graduate student in his apartment.
A UF Ph.D. student and geography as-
sisant, Kofi Adu-Brempong, was shot by
university police with an assault rifle Tues-
day night at his apartment across from the
Levin College of Law.
According to University Police Depart-
ment Capt. Jeff Holcomb, the 35-year-old
student was shot after an hour-and-a-halfstandoff with UPD officers 
.
A representative from Shands at UF re-
ported having no record of a patient by the
name Adu-Brempong, where police said he
was taken for treatment.
According to an anonymous source,
Adu-Brempong checked into the hospital
under a fake name. But Shands nursing co-
ordinator Doug Wallace said he was "un-
der command" not to comment on a pos-
sible false identity.
At Wednesday's meeting, police told
residents Adu-Brempong was not criti-
cally injured, according to fellow Corry
Village resident Ivan Martinez.
Martinez, a graduate student, was
in his apartment nearby when he heardshouting.
"I looked out the window and saw
about a hundred cop cars," he said. "I was
smart enough to stay inside."
"I looked out the window and saw
about a hundred cop cars. I was
smart enough to stay inside."
Ivan Martinez
Corry Village resident
The cop cars Martinez saw were the
result of a neighbor's phone call about
screaming from Adu-Brempong's apart-
ment.
After negotiating with him throughshooting
the door, police forced their way into the
apartment and were attacked by Adu-
Brempong, who came at police with a knife
and pipe, according to Holcomb.
"We didn't know if there was anybody
else in the room with him," Holcomb said.
"All we heard were the screams."
Martinez said police used an AR-15, an
assault rifle, instead of a 9 mm pistol be-
cause the rifle's bullets couldn't go through
the drywall and hurt people in surround-
ing apartments.
Adu-Brempong, who contracted the
polio virus when he was three or four
years old, walks with a cane, according
to an interview with him conducted last
semester.
Holcomb said all non-lethal measures
were taken to protect the student and po-

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
Unite audio reveals
campaign tactics
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Writer
At Tuesday's Senate meeting,
Student Alliance party senators
played audio of a Unite Party meet-
ing on the first day of SG elections.
In the Feb. 23 audio recording,
the discussion among Unite Party
members and supporters included
a description of sororities being re-
warded and punished for voting.
The statements implicated Kap-
pa Alpha Theta sorority for giving
members alcohol for voting and
Delta Phi Epsilon sorority for refus-
ing to let pledges eat until they vot-
ed, according to the recording.
The Student Alliance party's
transcript cited Andrew Guglielmo,
Unite Party graduate candidate, as
describing these practices.
Guglielmo, denied making the
statements but said he was present
at the meeting and addressed the
Unite members and supporters. He
stressed the value of campaigning.
Meeting attendees at the meeting
can be heard laughing after a state-
ment about Delta Phi Epsilon.
Student Body President Jordan
Johnson said he was not presentwhen the statements were made but
feels the statement was a joke.
"The Unite Party does not de-
termine individual incentives given
out by organizations in return for
voting," Johnson said.
Guglielmo said neither he nor
the Unite Party promotes hazing.
He said coercion is impossible.
"There's no one in that booth
.telling you how to vote," he said.
Student Alliance party Sen. Jona-
than Ossip said
denying pledges
food until they
vote is coercion.
threatens the in-
tegrity of the elec-
tion .and casts
a shadow on theJohnson legitimacy of Stu-
dent Government here at UF," ac-
cording to Ossip, who said the audio
came from a Unite Party fraternity
house representative.
Ossip said the member recorded
the meeting and e-mailed the record-
ing to himself and Student Alliance
party member Josh Niederriter.
The source who e-mailed the re-
cording asked to be anonymous.

Panel addreses
socialism
ByCJ PRUNER
Alligator Staff Writer
In a time when political par-
ties and organizations are vying
for control of the public trust, one
local group is hoping to make its
Marx.
"When a worker goes to
work every day in this
country, he's going to work
under tyranny .In order
for capitalism to survive,
people must be paid less
than what their work is
worth."
Joe Cenker
member of the International
Socialist Organization
Speaking to a crowd of about
20 at the Civic Media Center
Wednesday night, the Gainesville
branch of the International Social-myths
ist Organization made their case
for a system they described as a
bottom-up democracy more sym-
pathetic to the common worker.
"When a worker goes to work
every day in this country, he's go-
ing to work under tyranny,"said
Joe Cenker, a member of the In-
ternational Socialist Organiza-
tion. "In order for capitalism to
survive, people must be paid less
than what their work is worth."
In a forum that lasted more
than an hour, the International
Socialist Organization panel dis-
cussed topics ranging from poli-
tics and economics to women's
rights and social issues.
The panel laid out their politi-
cal philosophy and attempted to
address common misconceptions
of socialism and institutions as-
sociated with it.
In a socialist view of society,
Center said all men and women
would be entitled to enjoy a bet-
ter quality of life.

Melia Jacquot sits next to Mark Jaskowski while speaking about the relationship between feminism and
socialism at the Civic Media Center Wednesday evening.
tivist, ordained minister and re-
cently converted socialist, was
one of four panel members.
A self-described lifelong
Democrat, Lee started studying
socialism last year, although sheis still a registered member of the
Democratic Party.
She expressed discontent with
the current political status quo,
particularly with local politicians'
non-commitment to social issues,such as feeding the homeless.
"If my party can't come out
and feed people once a day," she
said, "I want nothing to do with
that party."
Hare Krishnas to conserve with compost program
* THEY HAVE BEEN SERVING LUNCH
AT UF SINCE 1971.
By MINCH MINCHIN
Alligator Writer
Krishna lunches have always been karma-
neutral. Soon, they will be almost carbon-
neutral.
Beginning the Monday after Spring Break,
the Krishna House, which has been servingvegetarian meals at UF since 1971, will begin
to turn all waste from the utensils used for
the lunches into compost.
Since 2008, the program has used biode-
gradable utensils made of sugarcane and
corn husks. Until now, they have been dis-
posed and taken to area landfills.
The new program will create both ecologi-
cal and spiritual benefits, said Carl Wood-
ham, director of the Krishna Lunch program.
"Eating vegetarian is the No. 1 thing to
help the earth," he said. "This program is justan extension of that."
The Krishna House pays $500 each month
to UF in waste disposal fees from lunch-relat-
ed garbage, he said.
"If [the program] is successful, then we
will ask UF if they
Environmental will remove the fee,"
Issues Woodham said. "They
are enthusiastic about
green initiatives, so I think they will do it."
To make the program work, students
must discard their plates, cups and forks intogreen bins that will be set around the south-
west corner of the Plaza of the Americas,
said Hanan Schwefel, who has been serving
Krishna lunches for the past eight years.
The waste will be collected from around
the Plaza of the Americas, where it will be
put on top of a van and driven up to a com-
post site in north Alachua County, Woodham
said.
The owner of the compost machine, Harry
Windle, will then sell the compost to farmers
and gardeners, he said.

Students create 'war zone'
0 ABOUT 25 STUDENTS PARTICIPATED.
By ANDREW PANTAZI
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Plaza of the Americas turned into a war
zone Wednesday when Students for Justice in
Palestine presented its own simulation of the
Gaza Strip conflict.
The Gaza Strip borders Israel and Egypt, and
most of its population represents Palestinian refu-
gees, according to The New York Times. A three-
week military conflict between Israel and Pales-
tine took place in the Gaza Strip in 2009, and Israel
and Egypt still enforce border blockades.
About 25 students participated posing as Is-
raeli soldiers, Egyptian soldiers and Gazans.
The soldiers pretended to beat the Gazans
with police clubs.
"It's a visual to get people's attention and talk
to them to say, 'Here are some of the facts with
what's going on,"' said Alex Kattan, the vice pres-
ident of Students for Justice in Palestine.
Jos6 Cucal6n, a civil engineering senior, por-
trayed a Gazan during the demonstration.Cucal6n said he did not feel the demonstration
was offensive.
"This story is barely told," Cucal6n said. "It's
been silenced, so I hope that here at UF you can
hear from a different perspective."
Several students walking past the demonstra-
tion found it to be an inaccurate portrayal of what
is actually happening in Israel.
Sarah Pollack, a UF freshman who visited Is-
rael during winter break, said she found the dem-
onstration jarring and did not feel it
On was right to portray the Israeli armyCampus so brutally.
Instead of the demonstration,
Pollack would have preferred a forum in which
both sides could present their views.
During the demonstration, Rafael Yaniz, the
president of Gators for Israel, was contacted by
concerned students.
"Dialogue is always on the table," Yaniz said.
He said he is disheartened this type of rhetoric
is presented on UF's campus.
"They're just trying to stir the pot, and I think
this isn't a good way to have an intellectual dis-
cussion about the issue," Yaniz said. "It's just an
outlandish protest."THURSDAY, MARCH 4, 2010 0 ALLIGATOR, 5
SPECIAL REPORT
Five sue rapper after
2006 club shooting
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Writer
After a bullet grazed Dorian
Johnson's face in July 2006, the dam-
age ran deeper than her blurred vi-
sion.
"I couldn't go into public places
for a long time," Johnson said.
Johnson was one of two vic-
tims who spoke at a press confer-
ence Wednesday morning that an-
nounced a lawsuit against rap artist
Plies.
The lawsuit is in response to a
shooting at a Gainesville nightclub
in 2006 that victims said was used to
promote violence in rap music and
boost record sales.
According to the lawsuit, the
shooting, in which five people were
shot, was part of the kind of crimi-
nal activity that builds "street cred-
ibility" in order to promote perfor-
mances.The shooting took place at the
now defunct Club 238, where Plies,
whose real name is Algernod Wash-
ington, was performing. His micro-
phone was cut-off after his set ran
long, and the ensuing ruckus led
members of his entourage to spray
bullets into the audience.
Edwin Fair-
cloth, the second
victim, said his
hip injuries pre-vented him from
working at the
paint and body
shop he owned at
Plies the time.
"I lost a busi-
ness, lost a job," he said. "I was just
destroyed."
Christopher Chestnut, the vic-
tims' attorney, said the success of
Plies has set a dangerous precedent.
"We cannot have youth thinking
they can shoot their way to the top,"
he said.

Go, Joe, Go
Lieberman's bill is step
in right direction
oe Lieberman finally did something right.
Today, the independent Connecticut senator who usu-
ally grates on our nerves like nails on a chalkboard, an-
nounced a bill that could repeal the military's "Don't Ask,
Don't Tell" policy, which prohibits gays and lesbians from
openly serving in the military.
The bill, called the Military Readiness Enhancement Act
of 2010, would also explicitly prohibit discrimination based
on sexuality.
Now, we know Lieberman is probably more pro-war than
pro-gay rights, and by military readiness enhancement they
mean "we don't care who you are as long as you'll die for
us," but we're not looking a gift horse in the mouth on this
one.
With the bill proposed and significant backing for a re-
peal in Washington, it seems like "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" -a
misguided compromise from our well-meaning 42nd presi-
dent -will finally become nothing more than another em-
barrassing spot on America's political past.
But that's not an excuse to sit around and let it possibly
slip by. Both Democratic and Republican U.S. senators need
to push aside their mutual disdain for crazy Old Man Lieber-
man and pass the bill. It's time.
We hope famous "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" flip-flopper John
McCain doesn't barricade himself in the Senate chamber and
refuse to let the bill move forward until every other problem
with the U.S. is magically fixed.
For now, we're just satisfied Lieberman, who is usually
an enormous disappointment all around, is taking a step to-
ward progress -whether it's for the right reasons or not.
Naughty Audio
S urprise!The Unite Party
uses coercive tactics
to get votes during Student
Government elections.
It's a tale as old as time,
but that doesn't mean it
should be continued.
And we were saddened
to see such glaring proof of
what we always suspected.
We get it, you're going to
do what you need to do to
get votes.
After all, Student Alli-
ance party people fliered
off-campus neighborhoods
to try to gain that extra
edge.
But when it comes to
praising a sorority house
that threatened to starve
its already food-deprived
sisters, it's gone a little too
far.
It makes sense to mobi-lize your Greek masses to
stay in power -even Stu-
dent Alliance can't fault
you for that, because they'd
most likely do the same -
but don't threaten people.
Furthermore, don't hold
meetings to scare people
into voting.
Whatever the newest in-
carnation of the Greek par-
ty's name is, they're always
going to use their numbers
to win elections.
The vast remainder of
the Student Body is always
going to not care and not
vote.
And the underdog, in-
die party is always going to
struggle for seats.
It's the way of life.
So rest assured, Greeks,
you'll still have your power.
Please though, for the love
of God, let those girls eat.

Undead McCain pushes vitamin bill
ith most of the national political spotlight soakedup by a lurching, half-hearted detente concerning
health care, Sen. John McCain sneaked a bill onto
the Senate floor last month that could drastically reshape
the entire supplement and vitamin industries. Washington
insiders, speaking anonymously and way off the record, be-
lieve that this never would have happened if McCain were
still alive.
Senate Bill 3002, the Dietary Supplement Safety Act of
2010, basically would grant the Food and Drug Administra-
tion wide-ranging powers to remove all supplements and
vitamins from the free market until the manufacturing com-
panies work their way through miles of expensive red tape,
and the FDA decides the supplements are safe enough for
impressionable, young professional baseball players. While
it virtually destroys the supplement industry and greatly
expands the federal government's powers beyond current
supplement laws, one assumes a terrible accident like the
tainted flax seed oil that turned Barry Bonds into a potato-
headed hulk would be mercifully avoided.
Opposition to the bill should create an unholy alliance
of Tea Party insurgents and actual herbal tea drinkers, unit-
ing both sides of the political spectrum in their aversion to
this impractical expansion of federal powers. Though seem-
ingly disparate groups, the holistic hippies and Tea Partiers
rallying in resistance to S. 3002 may also find unexpected
common ground in the areas of ostentatious hat construc-
tion and interpretive, Caucasian classic rock dance.
Aides close to McCain dare not speak publicly about
the quasi-undead state of their boss, but off the record they
marvel at the fluid movements and cognitive abilities of a
man who was clinically dead for approximately three hours.
Understandably omitted from the splurge of recent books
detailing the failed presidential campaign, McCain report-edly had a massive aneurysm when
top Republican Party officials denied
his first 17 choices for vice president
and told him that he would be run-
ning alongside the folksy and foxy
Alaska governor.
Tommy Maple McCain was rushed to an un-
letters@alligator org disclosed location and given a new
brain, heart and jejunum -bought
and paid for by pharmaceutical industry lobbyists. Big
Pharma, pharmaceutical corporations with significant po-
litical interests, also paid for McCain to have an unneces-
sary third kidney installed, and unconfirmed reports float-
ing around Washington have stated that McCain is now
hung "like a rowdy stallion."
The massive and unprecedented surgery did not come
without severe side effects: McCain was still woozy and ad-
justing to his new brain and heart when he first met Sarah
Palin, and when McCain mistakenly referred to one of her
children as "Tiny Monkey Cowboy Palin." The fiercely ma-
ternal Alaskan governor came within a heartbeat of field
dressing the senator in the middle of a hotel conference
room.
The drug companies have been muscled out of health
care negotiations by the insurance industry, so the fact that
they now control the important and powerful McCain is a
real coup. That Sarah Palin is now the de facto head of the
Tea Party lends a bit of beautiful symmetry to the whole
ordeal, and thanks to S. 3002, she can finally stand in glori-
ous opposition to the man who somehow bested her and
conjured up a more nonsensical baby name than she ever
could.

Letters to the Editor
Profile misrepresented subject
I am writing in response to staff writer
Jared Misner's article about Marvene Ed-
wards. I was aghast at some of the offensive,
condescending phrasing and terminology Mr.
Misner employed while telling this woman's
unparalleled story of courage in the face of
certain death and unspeakable physical abuse.
I found his use of the flashback sequenc-
ing in his storytelling quite distracting and a
hindrance during reading, and the lack of a
proper timeline left the article formless. Mr.
Misner's description of the town of Princeton,
Fla., was full of unnecessary data -what was
the point of mentioning the racial and finan-
cial makeup of said suburb? His likening Ms.Edwards' drug addiction and IIV infection to
leprosy literally left me agape. Mr. Misner's
classification of Ms. Edwards as an inhabitant
of another world further alienates her from so-
ciety as a whole, something I am certain Ms.
Edwards would not welcome. I do not believe
that this writing style did Ms. Edwards' story
justice, and I hope that in the future your writ-
ers will perhaps show some more sensitivity
to the subjects of their human interest articles.

UF freshman
Reitz Union needs repairs despite vote
Amidst all the turmoil of the recent UF
student government election, one importantfact seems to have been forgotten: The critical
repairs that the Reitz Union needs aren't go-
ing away simply because the referendum vote
didn't pass. The reality is $42.5 million dollars
of problems still remain in our student union.
Renew Your Reitz was initiated specifically
to educate the student body on the deficiencies
in our current union, to explain the possible
benefits of tomorrow's union and to locate all
possible funding sources to help repair and
renovate the Reitz. Although our one-week
awareness campaign and referendum were
narrowly defeated, our mission has only just
begun. That we received 45 percent of the vote
shows how contagious our message really is.
While most new student union buildingsin our state have been funded solely by stu-
dent fees, Renew Your Reitz is committed to
finding other resources to help minimize any
student fee. With our recent success exploring
Capital Improvement Trust Fund and admin-
istration and alumni contributions, we believe
the referendum's estimate of the student fee
was inaccurate and any fee would be lower.
Moving forward, we will continue to edu-
cate every student and organization about
the problems in our union. It is our hope that,
much like students from other schools in Flor-
ida and across the country, UF students will
band together to help renew our union.

Guest column
SG should stop dodging Reitz questions, get down to facts
If I were in Student Government, I'd shake my head this
week wondering why the Reitz referendum didn't pass.
But it wasn't clear who the referendum represented.
In a democracy, people are usually around long enough to
have their decisions affect them. For instance, unless you die in
the next six years, your vote for president of the United States
in 2012 will directly affect you. Sure, it affects others too, but
when you vote, you're representing yourself.
In contrast, college is a place where many of the decisions
made outlast the students. I'm in the Study Abroad Peer Advi-
sors club, which has almost entirely upperclassmen because it's
a club people join after they study abroad. So last year, it ended
up that not one person voting for this year's officers would ac-
tually be in the club now. When they voted, they were dispas-
sionately removed from the situation because no matter what,
it wouldn't affect them. Their votes represented the club.
The Reitz referendum was a failure of democracy because
no one knew whether they were representing themselves orWill Penman UF. This is my last semester here, so I
Speaking Out knew what I was representing: the his-
tory of UF. But a freshman friend asked
whether the changes would benefit her.
"Of course they would," I said. "You still have three years!"
We decided to ask one of the official Reitz referendum rep-
resentatives. "When will any of these benefits be seen?" I asked.
She stammered and stalled and I realized she had no idea. The
next week during SG elections I was ushered through the rain
by a nice Unite party campaigner pushing the Reitz measure.
"Last week, I asked a girl about this," I said, "and in her
answer, she threw in 'for your children.' It's not going to take
twenty years to fix the Reitz, is it?"
"Well, the architects are actually just coming up with the
plans now," Mr. Unite said.
"I know," I said. "I don't need to know if it'll open in seven
months versus eight. I need to know if the renovations will be
slowly rolled out or all come at one time, and how long thatwill take. Five years? Ten years? Fifteen years?"
I made it up to "Thirty years?" before he cut in, the polite
veneer gone, and said, "I don't know, man."
And that's the problem. SG should have at least told their
own people whether we're talking three years or 30, because it
changes the way people vote. The US House of Representatives
forces salary changes to take place after the next election so rep-
resentatives have an incentive to be less self-serving. Voting for
the Union is the same way.
I like UF, and I would be willing to start paying into some-
thing that I won't see. But if the changes can happen in four
years, next year's class can pay for it if they want to, and I'll stay
out of it. The debate over this being a worthy sacrifice is moot.
SG should drop the misleading "Know your Reitz" puns,
drop the assumption that students can't think long-term and be
honest about how much history is at stake here. Then actually
let them decide.

Roe v. Wade lawyer speaks about gender roles
0 ABOUT 350 PEOPLE ATTENDED.
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Writer
When Sarah Weddington graduated from
law school in the late 1960s, her first inter-
view involved convincing a man that she
didn't have to be home to cook dinner every
night.
It was just one of the many prejudices
Weddington encountered on the way to be-
coming the youngest women to win a Su-
preme Court case -Roe v. Wade in 1973."The ideas about woman in those times
were ridiculous," she said.
Weddington shared her experiences with
about 350 people in the Reitz Union Ballroom
on Wednesday night in a program co-spon-
sored by Accent, Women's History Month
and the Graham Center for Public Service.
Throughout her life, she said she has
owed her successes in pushing back barriers
for women to her determination to make her
mark.
"Leadership is the willingness and ability
to leave your thumbprint," she said.
Weddington was was asked to work on
Roe v. Wade at 26 because she was the onlywoman willing to do it for free, she said.
After arguing the Roe v. Wade case before
the Supreme Court, Weddington awaited the
decision and was uncertain of the outcome of
the case. She decided to go home and run for
the Texas Legislature in 1972.
National She won and was re-elected
News twice.
She said throughout her
time as a lawyer, politician and adviser to
former President Jimmy Carter, she always
turned to the law as her guiding light.
"I call law the wind beneath my wings,"
she said.
During the question and answer session,some students asked her specifically about
her opinion on the current arguments of
abortion rights versus anti-abortion.
Again citing her dedication to the law, she
gave public relations junior Ruth Michel her
view on the moment when life begins.
"It's the moment of birth that determines
citizenship," said Weddington, who was
paid $7,500 to speak.
Michel, who is anti-abortion, later said she
agreed with some of what Weddington said
about women's rights, but she still believes
life begins sooner than birth.
"I think we can say life begins when an
egg and a sperm come together," she said.

By MICHELLE PROFITS
avenue writer
Stuck in Gainesville over Spring Break? We've got
you covered. Here are some fun things to keep you
occupied throughout next week:
Start your week by rolling out the red carpet and
watching the biggest awards show of the year. The
Hippodrome Theatre will air the Oscars at its Acad-
emy Awards Gala on Sunday. With a reception, gour-
met food and the show airing in HD, this is one red
carpet event you don't want to miss. Tickets are avail-
able online at thehipp.org.
Then, rest up on Monday so you can hit up Common
Grounds on Tuesday to check out pop/folk group Port
O'Brien. The band just released "The Pan American
Sessions," an EP with all proceeds benefitting Haiti.
Port O'Brien is touring with Portugal. The Man and
The Dig. Tickets are $10 in advance. Doors open at
8 p.m.
Spend the rest of the week relaxing and enjoying
your hiatus from papers and tests before getting a
taste of Broadway. Danscompany of Gainesville will
perform its annual rendition of "The Wiz" at the Phil-
lips Center for the Performing Arts on March 13. Per-
formances are at 2 p.m. and 7:30 p.m., and tickets
are $12.
WHEN YOU GET BACK.
Don't be bummed when you head back to school
because SGP is bringing Ben Folds to the Phillips Cen-
ter on March 17. Tickets are going fast, so buy yours
at the University Box Office before you leave town.
Effortless ways to avoid packing on the pounds this break
You'll only burn 120 calories if you have sex for 60 min.
By LANCE FULLER
avenue writer
If you've spent the whole semester, or
at least the past couple of weeks, work-
ing hard in the gym to get slim and show
off your best beach body, you don't want
to destroy all of your hard work through
inactivity and too many pina coladas.
Here are some ways to maintain your body
and stay in shape during Spring Break with-
out having to step foot in a gym.
On the beach
There are plenty of fun calorie-burning
activities to do in the sand or in the wa-
ter. Depending on your weight, playing
an hour of beach volleyball can burn up
to 600 calories. The best part? You'll be
having fun playing in the sand with your
friends and will easily lose track of time.
You can burn even more calories when you
decide to relax and jump in the water, as anhour of general swimming in the pool or the
ocean can burn more than 500 calories.
On a cruise
If you're going on a cruise this Spring
Break, chances are the ship will have a work-
out room. But you might as well use some
of the ship's other features that you can't
use in a regular gym like a rock climbing
wall. Ascending rock climbing is one of the
most strenuous activities you can do; it will
increase your heart rate and work your fore-
arms, shoulders and biceps.
An hour of vigorous rock climb-
ing can burn around 900 calories.
Also, if you feel like taking a relax-
ing walk, walk around the cruise ship.
Most ships average about 1,000 feet in
length. Walking (or stumbling) the length
of the ship five times equals one mile.
On the slopes
Some Spring Breakers will break themold by going skiing out in the Rocky
Mountains in Colorado or at Lake Tahoe.
Downhill skiing and cross-country skiing
are popular snow activities, but although
you are more likely to burn more calories
cross-country skiing, doing about 30 min-
utes of downhill can burn 245 calories.
Don't feel like skiing and just want to take
a sled out to a hill with
some friends? No prob-
lem! An hour of sled-
ding downhill in the snow
can burn 540 calories.
Hooking up
While Spring Breakers
will inevitably be looking for that memorable
hookup with a complete stranger, sex may
not be the calorie-burning, heart-pounding
physical activity they think it is. To lose one
pound of fat, you would have to burn 3,500
calories.
According to healthdiscovery.net, if youweigh 165 pounds and have sex at a moder-
ate effort for 60 minutes, you'll burn about
120 calories. Intercourse may seem more
entertaining than some of these other activi-
ties, but don't look at sex as a means to burn
calories and lose weight over the break. As
always, if you are going to engage in some
hooking up, make sure it is consensual and
protected.
Pace yourself
There are seven calories per gram of
alcohol, so if you're going to drink, do it in
moderation and responsibly. After all, you do
want to come back with a liver.
Drinking light versions of different beers is
a good idea, and believe it or not, dark beers
like Guinness have fewer calories than most
light-colored beers like Budweiser because
the darker ingredients are less fermentable,
thus less alcohol is made.
Editor's Note: How much you weigh and
how longyou exercise will determine how
many calories you will burn.thursday, march 4, 2010

b~%a~ ~aju~o ?Y®&9Sneaking by security easy for your booze cruise
By GABRIELLE FALONEIRI
avenue writer
Many Spring Breakers will hit the decks of cruise
ships for vacations that leave little bits of dignity scat-
tered about Mexico, Central America and the Carib-
bean.
This alcohol-fueled debauchery puts serious dam-
age on the bank account because cruise lines realize
that with a captive (and thirsty) audience, they've got
all the control.
Spring Break isn't a time for fiscal responsibility or
limits, but college students don't really have the ex-
tra cash to spend on pricy cruise beverages no mat-
ter how much they love those little umbrellas.
But clever travelers of all ages have perfected the
art of sneaking booze on cruises. From hiding it in
shampoo bottles to the lucky few that get through se-
curity with a handle stashed in their luggage, balling
on a budget comes in many forms.
The most successful sneaking attempts depend
on chance, but there are a few tactics that take
smuggling endeavors over the edge.
"One of my friends put vodka in a mouthwash bot-
tle and dyed it blue," said J.R. Hillman, an engineer-
ing student. "He also took the seal off really carefully
so he could replace it."
Some Spring Breakers manage to get alcohol on
the boat by hiding it on themselves; the single serv-
ing bottles make this a lot easier.
More important than all of these, however, is at-
titude."When you go on a cruise line, the trick is not to
look like the catthat swallowed the canary," said Jim
Desmond, creator of Rum Runners flasks, a product
used to sneak alcohol on cruises.
Nowadays, every piece of luggage that goes on
a cruise ship gets X-rayed. Security guards mostly
look for dangerous objects like weapons but keep
their eyes peeled for bottle shapes as well, Desmond
said.
Desmond's product cuts out some of the risks
and drawbacks that come with water bottles and
shampoo containers. Since they're flexible, cruis-
ers can squeeze them around suitcase corners
and there's no air space, meaning no pesky slosh-
ing sounds.
The biggest downfall of putting liquor in previ-
ously used bottles? The original liquid taints the li-
quor's taste forever, he said. Last time we checked,
vodka and rum should be fruit-flavored, not sham-
poo and mouthwash.
Sneaky travelers need to remember that smug-
gling can carry consequences. Although some high-
er-end cruise lines allow their passengers to bring
alcohol on the boat, the popular Spring Break com-
panies like Royal Caribbean and Carnival don't let
any outside alcohol on board.
Cruisecritic.com listed confiscation as the most
common punishment, but cruise lines maintain their
right to refuse entry to anybody caught with alcohol
in their luggage.
"People need to understand thatthe worsttime to
get stuff on cruises is Spring Break," Desmond said.The increased traffic, especially by college students,
makes companies extra strict.
So to those about to smuggle, we salute your bra-
vado. Not wanting to pay inflated drink prices is total-
ly understandable. It's hard enough to plan a Spring
Break extravaganza on a nearly broke college budget
without averaging $8 per cocktail. Plan smart, act
cool and don't get caught. You wouldn't want your
vacation to end before you even get on the boat.

What happens on Spring Break doesn't always stay there
* DO'S AND DON'TS OF
SPRING BREAK 2010
By MICHAEL PERRONE
and AMELIA HARNISH
avenue writers
A good Spring Break is one that
is awesomely wild and a bit hazy, so
go out, get drunk and get laid. DO
have the time of your life. But DON'T
leave all your dignity at the dock.
Even a pact with the devil can't
guarantee everything that happens
on Spring Break stays on Spring
Break.He says.
DO hit on anyone and everyone.
Ninety percent of the sweaty, half-
naked co-eds around you will be giv-
ing it away like it's prom night. Just
think Dan Werner: Jack up enough
shots, and one is bound to land in
the bucket. DON'T get absolutely
plastered and try to spit game. By
all means, drink and have fun, but
going nuts won't get you anywhere.
DO flaunt it if you got it. You've
spent the last two weeks at South-
west trying to turn that gut into a
"Situation." And if you DON'T got it,
show it off anyway. With enough con-
fidence, it won't matter whether youlook like Brad Pitt or Seth Rogen.
DO attempt the kinkiest stuff
possible once you getthe girl. DON'T
even think about sliding in between
the legs of a random girl without
sliding on a condom. I will spare you
the lecture, just be sure to wrap it
up.
She says.
DO feel free to be aggressive.
Getting a guy's attention with an
ass-grab is totally acceptable. You
may not normally take matters into
your own hands, but now is the per-
fect time to master the art of getting
from bar to bedroom.
DON'T abandon all self-worth byseeking attention through flashing
or entering one of those hideous wet
T-shirt contests. Anything that re-
quires you to dance nearly naked on
stage is disgusting in any setting.
DO drink the day away. There is
no limit to the amount of pina cola-
das or tequila shots you consume in
any given day. Go ahead and shot-
gun a few Natty Lights in there, too.
But DON'T drink so much that you
forget to eat, black-out and then
barf all over the guy you just brought
back to the hotel.
DO have fun in the hot tub, but
don't forget to get out of the water
before penetration. Not only can youstill get pregnant and catch an STD
in a hot tub or hotel pool without
proper protection, the water reduc-
es the amount of natural lubrication
you produce, meaning it's probably
going to hurt, and the chlorination
can cause an infection.
DO hook up with random strang-
ers. Again, this is what Spring Break
is all about, so don't feel guilty not
knowing more than his name.
DON'T go home with anyone be-
fore tellingyour friends where you're
going. And if they tell you he's an
ugly creep, DON'T throw a drunk-
girl temper tantrum. Just listen and
thank them later.

This Spring Break, your liver isn't the only thing you should
be taking care of. With most of us jetting off to tropical
locales, this is prime time to do some serious damage to
your skin. Use these tips to take care of that bod as you're
basking in the glorious rays of Spring Break:
* Put enough sunscreen on and reapply:
Make sure you lather sunscreen on after you take a
dip in the pool or ocean to maximize protection.
* Avoid the midday sun:
UV rays are at peak intensity between 10 a.m. and
4 p.m. Try and take a time-out and get under the
shade.
* Keep it cool:
According to Cancer Research UK, storing sunscreen
in hot temperatures can ruin its protective chemicals
and decrease shelf life.
ApInvest in some aloe vera: m z nApply aloe to help heal and moisturize skin burns.U

Florida set for rematch with Auburn in SEC Tourney
0 THE GATORS TOPPED THE
TIGERS IN DOUBLE OVER-
TIME IN JANUARY.
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
etorrens @a rigator org
The start of the Southeastern
Conference Tournament means a
clean slate, and the Gators are hop-
ing they can return to the form they
showed when SEC play opened in
January.
Today at 2:30, No. 7-seeded
Florida (14-15, 7-9 SEC) will get a
rematch with 10th-seeded Auburn
in the first round at The Arena at
Gwinnett Center in Duluth, Ga.
UF began league play 2-0 with
a win at Arkansas and at home
against the Tigers (14-15, 5-11 SEC)
in double overtime earlier in the
season.
The Gators have fallen on hard
times since, losing five of their last
six contests -a stretch that includ-
ed five top-25 opponents and a loss
to unranked Alabama. The Tigers
are coming off an upset win overNo. 2 seed Kentucky.
The double-OT win UF escaped
with at home on Jan. 7 against Au-burn was a tale of two halves. Flori-
da led by 18 in a dominant first half
-holding the Tigers to five fieldgoals while committing just six
turnovers -before Auburn roared
back and outscored the Gators 37-

UF hopes to bounce back
By TONI-ANN MILLER
Alligator Writer
Just four days after its first loss of the
season -an 18-5 blowout at North Car-
olina -Florida (2-1) returns home for a
matchup against St. Bonaventure tonight
at 6:30.
This game could set the tone for the
rest of the season for Amanda O'Leary's
young Gators if they're able to bounce
back from the devastating loss to the Tar
Heels.
Coming off the defeat in Chapel Hill,
UF was forced to examine its composure.
The team couldn't stay close to UNC af-
ter trailing by just two at the half, and it
allowed the Tar Heels to score 12 goals in
the second period.
After the game, O'Leary said her play-
ers needed to use the matchup against
North Carolina as a learning experience,
stick to their game plan and stay com-
posed when things don't go their way.
"It's a matter of being able to stop thebleeding a little bit," she said. "When we
get into a situation (where) they go on a
two or three-goal run, we need to be able
to answer back, and if it means coming
up with a big save or coming up with a
big defensive stand, or if it means scor-
ing a goal at the other end, we need to do
something to change the momentum of
the game."
UF gave up against North Carolina
when the Tar Heels went on a second-
half runSunday, O'Leary
said.
However, she talked
to the team about main-Lacrosse taining its poise in up-
coming games.
Although the Bonnies are not of the
Tar Heels' caliber, the Gators will need
consistency and composure throughout
Thursday's match.
One of the likely candidates to take on
the task for UF is attacker Ashley Bruns.
SEE LAX, PAGE 1940-yard dash is
verybody knows the main event at the
NFL Combine is the 40-yard dash.
It's when you finally get to see
how fast, or slow, a player can run.
And those four-plus seconds can affect a
player's draft stock drastically.
This is bad news for Joe Haden.
People were expecting him to clock the
best time for a cornerback at the combine.
Instead, he ran a 4.57 and his top-10 status
is now in jeopardy.
It seems every year one of the best play-
ers is negatively affected by his 40 time,
and this year the big name is Haden.
Haden has always looked fast in person
and was one of the best players at his posi-
tion the last two years, but his poor show-
ing at the Combine is likely to cause scouts
to start worrying about his ability to play at
the next level.
"If you are sure he has been timed
enough and you are sure the times are le-
gitimate, you know a 4.6 cornerback can't
cover a 4.4, 4.45 receiver, especially with
him running backwards 68 percent of his
time in coverage, so if he can't run forward
faster than that, you just say, 'He's a nice
kid. I really like him. He's a good kid. May-
be he can play something else for us,"' said
Ron Marciniak, who was an NFL scout for
26 years before retiring recently.19 after intermission.
Three three-pointers from then-
scoreless Steffi Sorensen in the sec-
ond overtime gave UF just enough
breathing room.
"We've just gotta look at the first
half and draw a lot of confidence
from the fact that we did play one
of our best 20-minute segments of
basketball against them and try to
dwell on that positive," UF coach
Amanda Butler said.
Six-foot-4 center Azania Stew-
art was pivotal in the win, scor-
ing 21 points, nailing a pair of free
throws that sent the game into the
second overtime while corralling
11 rebounds. Stewart, who hasn't
played in the last five contests be-
cause of a stress fracture in her left
foot, has been listed as day-to-day.
If she's unavailable, the load will
fall on freshman Jennifer George.
It's been a good few days for the
6-foot George, who earned her first
career double-double against Ala-
bama on Sunday and was named
to the SEC All-Freshman Team on
Tuesday.

dumb that two slow
40-yard dashes coul
affect his status tha
much, tape can lie.

bcallovi@alligator org at Florida's Pro Da
on March 17. but it'
hard to tell on tape
how fast he is.
You don't know how fast the people op-
posite of Haden were.
So for now, the only thing to judge just
how fast Haden can run is his times at the
Combine. Luckily for him, the 40 is not the
only thing that is going to be taken into
consideration.
"To me, the 40-yard dash is a very im-
portant factor, but it is just that -a factor,"
Marciniak said. "There are 10 factors, at
least, for every football player."
But now, those other factors that scouts
and coaches are evaluating are going to
have to be even better because they are
going to be looking at him even closer to
make sure Haden is still worth drafting
with a high pick.

Bruns has
led offense
this season
LAX, from page 18
Bruins has been one of the Gators'
stand-out freshmen and a go-to
player so far.
She's second on the squad
with seven goals scored behind
midfielder Brittany Dashiell,
who has eight.
Bruins also leads the team in
t assists, dishing out eight in three
games.
Bruins said the squad will
forget its loss against the Tar
Heels and focus on beating St.
11 Bonaventure.
7t She will be expected to lead
the Gators against the Bonnies
because she is often in the point
guard or shooting guard role,
distributing the ball, dictating
the offense and making shots.
"It's really important for her
to have a good game, but if she
doesn't, we hope we have play-
ers that can step up into that
same role and do that," O'Leary
said.
sai She added that, if need be, the
Gators have other players like
Dashiell and midfielders Colby
Rhea and Julie Schindel who can
help run the offense.
"It's going to be a really com-
Matt Tripp / Alligator Staff petitive game," O'Leary said.
UF freshman Ashley Bruns leads the team with eight assists and is second in goals with seven. The Gators will need her offense when they take "How we come off of a big loss

Stewart's injury has increased George's role
WHOO PS, from page 18
Her recent success is a reflection of her added min-
utes, including 31 against the Crimson Tide, which
came about after Stewart was sidelined.
"I don't know about a blessing in disguise, be-
cause you never want to see your teammates get
hurt," George said of Stewart's injury. "But it did
force me to mature a little bit more in my game and
forced me to be more accountable."
Over the past five games, she led the team withseven rebounds per game and was second on the
team with nine points per contest.
If George is going to have a chance at replicating
her recent performance, she'll need help against Au-
burn and 6-foot-7 KeKe Carrier.
One poor half nearly cost the Gators their last
matchup against Auburn, so they'll be focused on
starting fast and playing a strong 40 minutes.

season," George said. "If we get a lead, we'll keepBOBBY, from page 18
While the coaches are paying more attention to his game
film to find any other flaws in his game, Haden has the next
two weeks to prepare himself to run the best 40-yard dash of
his life.
"Pro Day and the Combine is the fastest that player runs the
rest of his life," Marciniak said. "Anyone who runs in the Com-
bine will never run that fast again. They take three-and-a-half
months to practice with track coaches and condition their body
five days a week to ready for two or three 40-yard dashes."
If Haden can improve his time, he should easily re-establish
himself as a top-10 pick unless the two weeks give scouts time
to find another problem.
Haden's slow time made things harder on himself and ex-
emplifies why the 40-yard dash is the headliner at the Com-
bine.
It takes just 4.57 seconds to hurt a player's draft stock.

Castillo adjusting to diminished role after surgery
0 THE FORMER ALL-AMER-
ICAN HASN'T COMPETED IN
ALL-AROUND THIS SEASON.
By TOM GREEN
Alligator Writer
When Amanda Castillo partially
tore her left Achilles tendon last sea-
son, she wasn't sure what her place
on Florida's gymnastics team would
be moving forward.
But with her senior season wind-
ing down, the seven-time All-Amer-
ican is accepting and adjusting to
her new role.
As a freshman and sophomore,
Castillo earned All-American hon-
ors in the all-around and was one of
the Gators' best gymnasts.
But as ajunior, pain in her left foot
set in after a fall in the preseason.
She battled through the injury for
part of the season before shutting it
down after the team's meet withUtah, and underwent surgery at the
end of March.
"So many things were going
through my mind when it hap-
pened," Castillo said. "'This can't be
happening. Why is this happening?
What did I do wrong?'I'm a compet-
itor, and I had goals. I went through
denial and felt bad I couldn't be
there for the team."
After the surgery, Castillo went
through a six-month recovery pro-
cess before slowly returning to the
gym. She pushed herself and came
in on her off days to do everything
she could before making her return
at the beginning of this season.
Coach Rhonda Faehn said it was
a hard time for Castillo, who didn't
realize how difficult making a come-
back would be because it was new
territory for her.
Since returning, Castillo has seen
a diminished role, competing on
the bars every week, but she hasn't
returned to the all-around competi-
tion this season."At first, it was hard," Castillo
said about adjusting to a different
role. "But I'm a senior, and I've got
three years of college gymnastics un-
der my belt. I'm trying to be more of
a motivator now and be there for my
team and give them the confidence
they need, especially the freshmen."
Castillo has been working on the
all-around in practice, and Faehn
said she had planned for Castillo to
return to the all-around this season,
but things didn't go as scheduled.
The coaches didn't want to over-whelm Castillo in competition.
"Of course I would love to be in
the all-around, but this is a team, and
I want to be able to help any way I
can," Castillo said. "I'm honored to
at least still be competing."
The first part of this season was
a struggle for her and a few weeks
ago she had a breakdown, but Faehn
helped Castillo with her confidence
and reassured her they would figure
things out.
Since then, Faehn said Castillo
has really come to peace with her-self and has realized she will play a
role in the success of the team, even
if it means being more than just a
performer.
Against Auburn last week, Cas-
tillo's 9.875 earned her a share of the
event title on bars, which was her
second win this season. She said it
showed that she's not done yet, and
still has something left in the tank to
help her team.
"I want to be able to lay my head
down at night and know that I gave
it my all," Castillo said.
