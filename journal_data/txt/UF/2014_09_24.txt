UF researchers can crunch calculations instantly thanks to a 
donation from IBM.  
The IBM partnership and donation of a PureData Analytics 
system was announced at the Fall 2014 Research Computing 
Day on Tuesday.
UF is the only university in Florida to have the $500,000 sys-
tem, which analyzes large data. 
The PureData Analytics system optimizes hundreds of mil-lions of records to create patterns and answer questions faster. 
With PureData Analytics, researchers can do queries of 10 
to 100 million records in three seconds, versus the 27 hours it would have normally taken, said Elias Eldayrie, vice president and chief information ofﬁ  cer of UF Information Technology.
“IBM recognized our drive for preeminence,” Eldayrie said. 
“And this latest donation by IBM will be one more tool added to the toolkit that we make available to our staff.”
Erik Deumens, UFIT director of research and commuting, 
said this will make a big impact on the university, adding an-other building block to the goal of becoming a top-10 public university. 
IBM chose to give UF the donation after seeing its data ad-
vances in 2013.
The Data Center was built for $15 million and houses the 
$3.4 million HiPer Gator, the most powerful supercomputer in Florida.  
With HiPer Gator, faculty can already analyze their research 
and ﬁ  ndings at faster speeds. HiPer Gator works at 150 trillion UF receives $500,000 system donation from IBM

Five days after the tragic murder-suicide 
in Bell, Florida, Gilchrist County authorities 
released Don Spirit’s 911 call.
“I just shot my daughter and shot all my grandkids,” he said calmly to dispatch at about 4 p.m. Thursday. “And I’ll be sitting on my step, and when you get here, I’m gonna shoot myself.” 
After conﬁ  rming Spirit’s identity, the dis-
patcher asked him what kind of gun he had.
“It doesn’t matter what kind of gun I got. They’re all dead,” Spirit said. “And when you get here, I’ll shoot myself. And then you’ll ﬁ  g-ure out what kind of gun it is.” 
Upon arrival, ofﬁ  cers made brief contact 
with Spirit before he turned the .45 caliber pis-tol on himself, according to a Gilchrist County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce press release.
Police said the children’s bodies were 
each found in different places throughout the house, and the bodies of Spirit and his daugh-ter Sarah were found separately outside the house. 
All eight deaths were the result of the gun 
shots, a preliminary autopsy report conﬁ  rmed. The ﬁ  nal autopsy report will be completed in several weeks.
Authorities are currently investigating how 
Spirit, a convicted felon, obtained the weapon used. 
They have not determined a motive. Gilchrist County authorities release murder-suicide 911 call  MELISSA MIHM

A composite sketch and new video footage 
of the possible UF assault suspect were released 
Tuesday by University and Gainesville Police.
The footage shows the sus-
pect walking east behind the 
Stadium Club parking garage. 
In the video, the suspect picks up an orange trafﬁ  c cone and throws it into oncoming trafﬁ  c. The cone appears to hit a white car, and ofﬁ  cers are hoping to speak with the vehicle’s driver.
Afterward, the suspect turns north onto North-
west 18th Street. Although other people in the 
video are running to get out of the rain, the man 
continues walking at the same pace.
A drawing of the suspect was formed with the 
help of residents near the 2000 block of Southwest 16th Street, where the ﬁ  rst attack occurred on Aug. 30. This information matched the description giv-en by victims and witnesses, according to a press release. Ofﬁ  cials are not entirely sure if the subject in the drawing is the same as the one in the video, 
but they are hoping to identify the individual.
Witnesses said they were approached by a man Police release

Professors could be ﬂ  ipping their teaching habits to 
change the way students learn in and out of the class-
room.
UF Information Technology is offering a Flipped 
Classroom Seminar on Oct. 9, where the Center for Instructional Technology & Training’s instructional designers will teach faculty how to adopt this hybrid 
model of teaching.
Unlike live classes, the ﬂ  ipped model requires in-
structors to prerecord lectures and post them online, 
allowing students to get the material ahead of time, pre-pare and be able to focus on participating during class meetings.
“Imagine being able to do all of your group work 
in class as opposed to having to schedule it outside of class,” Stephanie McClelland, CITT’s manager of in-structional design services, wrote in an email.
She said it is more convenient because students have 
the option of watching videos on their laptops, tablets or smartphones. 
During class time, they can take part in group activi-ties, ask questions and study for exams. 
This teaching approach is a new concept for many 
professors.
In a study by Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, 
California, ﬂ  ipped classrooms were found to be inef-fective in practice. Students had to be dedicated to the practice for it to work well.
But Konstantinos Gakis, an adjunct assistant profes-
sor in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engi-neering at UF, said he has heard about the model and would be interested in attending the UFIT seminar.
“It’s something that I have not tried, and I don’t 
know how it will play, but I am open to the idea,” Gakis said.
Isabella Cabal, a UF communication sciences and dis-
orders senior, said the ﬂ  ipped model has the potential 
to help students if it is done the correct way.
“If they’re going to do online lectures, then they re-
ally have to put in the effort to make sure we’ll under-
stand the material because we can’t ask questions di-rectly in person,” Cabal, 22, said.
Spots for the seminar have ﬁ  lled up quickly, and 
there is a growing wait list for another session, accord-ing to McClelland. Faculty can register for the seminar with UFIT.
“It is very encouraging that instructors are moti-
vated to improve their courses to be more student cen-tered,” Cabal said. “Times are changing and students are changing. It makes sense that the way students are being taught should also change.”UFIT offers seminar to show faculty 
how to ﬂ  ip teaching classroom method
“If they’re going to do online lectures, then 
they really have to put in the effort to make 
sure we’ll understand the material because we 
can’t ask questions directly in person.”

When the suspect attacked the first vic-
tim a few blocks north of Ben Hill Griffin 
Stadium, police said he dragged her into 
the bushes, beat her and then fled the scene after attempting to sexually assault her.
On Aug. 31, just hours after the first as-
sault, another female was attacked off of 13th Street and Inner Road.And on Sept. 7, a woman reported being 
attacked on campus near McCarty Hall. Af-ter the victim punched the suspect, he fled on foot. The suspect was not located.
In all three cases, police said the suspect 
grabbed the victims from behind, and all the victims fought him off.  He is described as a white male, at least 6 feet tall, with a large build.

A Student Senate rule was sus-
pended Tuesday night to remove 
time constraints for organizations to receive funding near elections. 
Allocations Chair Leah Miller 
motioned to waive the rule, which bans the Senate from hearing spe-cial requests for allocation funds within seven days of the first day of Fall or Spring elections, as an exception for the Virgil Hawkins Pre-Law Society’s funding.
According to the rule, the pro-
vision could be waived by a two-thirds vote.
The motion was passed unani-
mously.
The group faced a time con-
straint to receive funds for upcom-ing activities, which include LSAT test prep workshops, guest speak-ers from admissions departments 
and its annual Pre-Law Day event 
on Oct. 21.
The Senate approved a grant of 
$1,440.37 for the organization. 
Miller said she was impressed 
by the organization’s plans to ac-commodate students. 
“As a committee, we do what 
we can to help organizations,” she 
said.
The meeting also included a 
visit from Gainesville Rep. Keith Perry, who spoke to Student Sen-ate members on using their future careers to create a more organic, 
innovative government.
“Think of your role in govern-
ment after you graduate,” he said.

Individuals and teams can audition 
in the hopes of being selected as one of 10 acts to perform for Talent Night on Oct. 14 at the Phillips Center for the Per-forming Arts.
At Talent Night, one of the acts will 
be selected to perform at Growl.
Martine Valcourt, 18, said she is ready 
to give the audition her all, but she won’t be alone.
The industrial and systems engineer-
ing sophomore will be auditioning with her dance team, Sabor Latino. Valcourt has been part of the team for three se-mesters.
This is her first time auditioning, and she said she is very excited. Last year, the team made it to Talent Night, and she would like to make that happen again.
The Talent Night director and assis-
tant directors will be judging auditions 
this week. 
Homecoming Chairman Evan 
Schauder, a fifth-year accounting stu-
dent, wrote in an email that applications for Talent Night can be found on the Growl website. 
“The past performances have ranged 
from dance and music to magic and jug-gling,” he said. “We are expecting a very 
similar turnout in talent for this year’s 
event.”
Valcourt said if her team got to per-
form at Growl, it would be the highlight of her college career.
“It would give me a chance to per-
form in front of the whole Gator com-munity, which I love,” she said.

New York native Giuseppe DiBella was 
shocked when he received an unexpected 
phone call this month — his missing toy fox 
terrier had been found in Ocala.
The terrier, Nika, had been missing for 
almost two years. 
“I was not expecting Nika to show up so 
far away,” said DiBella, who lives in New-
burgh, New York. He had contacted law 
enforcement, posted fliers and shared her 
microchip number online to no avail.
“I never gave up looking for her because 
I’ve had her since she was a puppy and 
knew someone would take care of her,” he 
said.
Nika’s microchip ultimately led to her 
return.
Abby Rivera, a vet technician for A Fam-
ily Veterinarian, found the small dog out-side a friend’s doorstep and brought her in for a microchip scan.
She was underweight but in good spir-
its, Rivera said in an email.
After scanning for the rice-sized chip 
between Nika’s shoulder blades, Rivera found out which company manufactured the chip. Using the company, she was able to locate DiBella.
Microchipping services are “the only 
thing that can assure you that you will get them back,” DiBella said.
For $15, the Alachua County Humane 
Society can microchip community pets wrote Abigail Amlong, staff veterinarian at the Alachua County Humane Society, in an email.
“There are countless stories of pets re-
turned to owners after varying lengths of time of being lost or stolen,” Amlong said. 
The benefits of having a microchip 
greatly outweigh negative effects, she said, 
which are typically minor.
“Microchipping is extremely important 
— it is useful for identifying and contacting 
owners of lost pets as well as proving own-ership in cases of discrepancy,” she said.New Yorker reunites with dog

vasan said. “As long as you have the data, you can play with it and create insight.”

President Barack Obama’s new rating for-
mula for college federal aid distribution is set 
to be released in time for 2015. 
After a Federal Advisory Committee 
hearing Friday, questions were raised about 
whether the formula would impact colleges’ 
access to federal aid. 
Faculty and students suggest UF would 
benefit from these rankings by creating more financial opportunities and diversity on cam-pus.
“It’s hard to predict how they would affect 
the upcoming year, but in general, UF already does very well in ratings like these,” said UF 
spokesman Steve Orlando. “Anything that 
could potentially bring in students from even 
more diverse backgrounds is always a benefit to the 
university.”
Obama’s ratings system 
will examine colleges based on access, affordability and outcomes in order to dis-
tribute federal aid for low-
income and first-generation students.
The plan will also tie financial aid to col-
lege performance, starting with publishing the new college ratings before the 2015 school year and challenging states to fund public col-
leges based on performance, as well as hold-
ing students and colleges receiving student aid responsible for making progress toward a degree, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
“I think it’s a good idea, even though it 
might be hard to implement,” said Jamilea Van Hemel, a 20-year-old UF animal biology junior. “I think that because it would be hard 
to generalize between colleges in different so-
cial environments and rich and poor cities.”
During the hearing, researchers and ad-
ministrators questioned the plan’s issues.
Some concerns included that the ratings 
may become an alternative to commercial rankings, colleges could try to get rid of pos-
sible at-risk students in order to improve its 
rating and the information and data provided might be flawed.
Orlando said the new formula would not 
affect UF financially.
The rating system would not only give 
more attention to the university but also help current students with their academic finances.
“I think this would benefit me because my 
family is in the middle class,” said Lauren Klitz, a 20-year-old UF industrial and systems engineering junior. “So any financial aid I have received came from scholarships I ap-plied for and Bright Futures, which is based on academics.” Obama’s new federal aid distribution formula set for 2015

A fire at Majestic Oaks Apartments com-
plex Tuesday morning left one family dis-
placed. 
Alachua County Fire Rescue responded 
to the complex, located off of Southwest 20th Avenue, at about 10:30 a.m., Lt. Rus-sell Valentine said.
When fire crews arrived, visible flames 
were coming out of the front door of build-ing J. It took only a few minutes to extin-guish the flames, Valentine said. 
“We had a pretty quick knock down,” he 
said.
The apartment was deemed unlivable, 
though no one was injured in the fire. In-vestigators are still trying to determine the cause.
Now, yellow caution tape blocks off 
the lawn next to the brown wood-paneled building. Piles of clothes, shoes and blan-kets lay on the grass next to a once-white 
door, completely tainted from flames and 
smoke. Greg Dove, of The Aspen Compa-nies, which owns the complex, wheelbar-rowed the family’s burnt belongings into a nearby dumpster.
Valentine said the Red Cross arrived at 
the scene, offering help to the family who is now homeless. Red Cross often assists with temporary housing, food and clothing in 
similar situations, he said.
The fire was completely contained to the 
affected apartment and no other buildings 
were damaged.Fire at Majestic Oaks displaces family 
� HATCHLINGS COUNT DOUBLED THIS YEAR.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
GAINESVILLE, Fla. — A record number of American croc-
odile hatchlings were counted in Everglades National Park 
this year, providing hope that restoration efforts are helping the once-endangered species, researchers said Tuesday.
UF researcher Frank Mazzotti has been monitoring the 
crocodiles since 1978, a few years after the reptile received 
federal endangered species status.
He and a team of researchers caught 962 of the hatchlings 
this year in the park, nearly doubling the 554 found in 2013.
The animal’s apparent rebound led to the government’s reclassification of the species as threatened in 2007.
The crocodiles’ decline is blamed on a network of canals 
dug into the Everglades in the early 20th century to drain 
marsh water for agriculture.
The influx of saltier water increased salinity, which is harm-
ful to the crocodiles. Otherwise, they can live for decades.
Restoration efforts have plugged some of the holes in the 
park, allowing for better water quality.
Mazzotti said although there isn’t definitive proof that res-
toration efforts and the latest count are correlated, it is a good indication.
“What we hope is the lesson is that ecosystem restoration 
efforts can work,” Mazzotti said in a news release, adding that 
crocodiles are good indicators of waterway health.Florida crocodile populations surge� IT SHOULD BE COMPLETED NEXT YEAR.

Ali Baker has enjoyed the quietness of her Wind-
meadows apartment behind Butler Plaza for the last 
four years. But as the shopping center expansion con-tinues and the woods by her apartment are cleared, she said both the construction and traffic are changing that.
The land behind the current shopping plaza is be-
ing expanded to create Butler North. Butler Enterprises President Deborah Butler said the new complex should be completed next year.
Baker, a UF family, youth and community sciences 
graduate student, said she is against the expansion. 
“I’m not a fan,” the 23-year-old said. “There’s al-
ready too many people driving around here.” 
Butler North will add to the main Butler Plaza and 
Butler Plaza East, which is being redeveloped into But-ler Town Center. Once finished, the site will span about 267 acres.
“People will no longer have to travel to Jacksonville, 
Orlando or Tampa,” Butler wrote in an email. “Butler Plaza, Butler North and the planned Butler Town Cen-ter will have everything you need.”
Infrastructure construction began Aug. 2, and build-
ing construction is scheduled for March. Butler said the 
expansion will bring 3,500 permanent jobs to the city 
and about 1,500 construction jobs.
“The impact is not like anything Gainesville has ever 
seen from a single developer,” she said.
But for Baker, the land clearance makes her com-
plex feel exposed and unsafe. She said she’s seen many people walk onto her apartment’s property from the once wooded area and doesn’t look forward to being bordered by future businesses.
Butler North isn’t the only expansion in the works.
Celebration Pointe is planned to open in 2016 at the northwest corner of Interstate 75 and Archer Road.
The center will include office, residential and retail 
space, as well as hotel services, said Tonya Creekmore, principal at Avison Young, the firm handling the man-agement and leasing. So far, Bass Pro Shops and Hotel Indigo are the only businesses that Celebration Pointe has announced.
“If you look at markets similar to Gainesville and 
the amount of retail and office and residential that they have, Gainesville really has a void in those areas,” Creekmore said. “So we’re hopeful that we are actually delivering something to the community that is current-ly missing.”
Creekmore said Celebration Pointe is trying to cater 
to the entire community and expects students, residents and tourists traveling on I-75 to visit the center.Expansion of

Shooting reveals 
holes in Fla. family 
services system
Last Thursday, the small town of Bell in Gilchrist County 
experienced an unimaginable tragedy. Don Charles Spirit, a 51-year-old man with a history of drug abuse and vio-
lence, murdered his daughter and six grandchildren and then turned his gun on himself. 
According to the Miami Herald, the incident may be “the 
largest loss of life in a single family with a child welfare history ever in Florida.” 
Perhaps the worst part of this horriﬁ  c incident is that it very 
well could have been avoided.  The Florida Department of Chil-dren and Families (DCF) was ﬁ  rst alerted to the Spirit family’s volatile history of physical violence and drug abuse on Sept. 1.
The department’s investigation into the family’s situation 
was still ongoing when the tragic shooting occurred about two 
weeks later. 
Unfortunately, this isn’t the only recent case of tragic, but 
preventable family violence in Florida. 
In just the ﬁ  rst half of 2013, at least 40 Florida children were 
killed in outbursts of family violence, according to a evalua-
tion done by Casey Family Program. This epidemic of violence against Florida children has taken place in the wake of massive cuts to the DCF enacted by Gov. Rick Scott and the Legislature. 
Every year since Scott took ofﬁ  ce in 2011, DCF has faced 
harsh and devastating budget cuts. During the last legislative session, Scott and Florida lawmakers slashed $88 million from the department’s budget. In 2011, Scott argued that such bud-gets cuts were necessary to create more jobs in Florida. 
“We’ve got to ﬁ  gure out how to do more with less,” he said. 
“If we don’t, we’re never going to grow jobs in this state.” 
There’s no indication that more Florida jobs have been cre-
ated during Scott’s time as governor than would have been with a stronger, more effective DCF. What we do know is that, in the 
past few years, dozens of Florida children have died as a result 
of horriﬁ  c but avoidable violence.
There’s certainly no guarantee that a stronger DCF system 
would have prevented the Bell shooting, and simply throwing more money at the problem is not a solution by itself. 
Even within the most well-funded, comprehensive social-
safety nets, individual cases slip through the cracks and lead to unfortunate and distressing incidents.
However, the devastating cuts to the Florida DCF enacted by 
the Scott administration have increased the likelihood that more of these preventable deaths will occur in the future.
The DCF does not deserve to be viliﬁ  ed or condemned for its 
failure to prevent the Bell shooting. The counselors, investiga-tors and other professionals in the department work extremely hard and receive very little recognition for what they do.
However, the Bell shooting and other recent cases of family 
violence demonstrate that the DCF still has signiﬁ  cant room for 
improvement. Unfortunately, if the Florida government contin-
ues to slash funding for these vital social programs, the tragedies are bound to continue unabated.

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgTuesday’s question: Do you think books 
should ever be banned? Today’s question: Do you think using technology in the 
classroom is helpful?Not your Tinderella: a lazy dating app
“Did you lose a slipper? Because you’re my Tinder-
ella.” Now, insert a winky face. Tell me this is a joke. 
The quote above is a message I received on Tin-
der, a dating app popular with college students. 
I created an account speciﬁ  cally for the purposes of 
this column. After developing a familiarity with the inner workings of Tinder, I believe I have enough information to bash its nauseating concept to smithereens. 
Tinder is creepy, pointless and potentially trashy. 
It promotes a lazy, superﬁ  cial dating environment and hook-up culture. 
A common argument in Tinder’s defense is that it con-
nects you with people you would never meet otherwise and expands your romantic opportunities.
This argument may be accurate, but at what cost? Tinder is a simpliﬁ  ed application form of online dating 
sites like eHarmony and OkCupid. 
Whereas online dating sites usually aim for older gen-
erations, Tinder’s target audience is college students. Col-
lege students, especially the ones on Tinder, are often look-
ing for fun, casual dates, not committed relationships. 
When I casually asked a friend about her experience 
with Tinder, this is the answer I got: 
“I’ve had the drunk ﬁ  rst date, the guy-who-coupons 
ﬁ  rst date, the guy who asked for my email and not my number and the guy who wanted our ﬁ  rst date to be hyp-nosis.” 
Needless to say, there were no second dates. Tinder 
may provide quantity, but it leaves out the quality. 
Seriously, when was the last time you asked a happy 
couple where they met, and their response was, “Oh, we met on Tinder!” 
Years ago, someone told me you get in what you put 
out. This is true of Tinder, too. If all you’re doing is swip-ing left for “I’m not attracted to you” and right for “Hello, good looking,” you’re not putting in much effort. 
Yes, the initial “match” when two people both swipe 
right and mutually like each other can lead to a shallow, ﬂ  irty conversation and an even-tual date, but the initial effort is not there. By the way, swiping right on a photo means someone 
ﬁ  nds a low quality, 2-by-2-inch 
photo appealing. 
If that doesn’t boost your ego, 
I don’t know what will. 
The lack of initial effort leads 
to the terrible dates people have after meeting on Tinder. People 
are not expecting much. Two people merely swiped their 
phone screen, had a casual, possibly raunchy conversation 
and then decided to meet for a date. More than likely, one or both parties are just looking to hook up. 
Tinder feeds the growth of the stereotypical sleazy, col-
lege hook-up scene, and it thrives on a need for instant gratiﬁ  cation that has become a hallmark of American cul-ture. 
Tinder just opens the door to more instant gratiﬁ  cation 
and infatuation. He’s cute. She’s not. She’s cute. He’s not. Swipe, swipe, swipe. There is nothing meaningful or sub-stantial about liking a picture and sending a witty mes-sage to another person that you’ve probably sent many times before to other Tinder users. 
The creator of Tinder took the instant gratiﬁ  cation of a 
“like” found on sites like Instagram and combined it with a twisted, simpliﬁ  ed form of online dating and birthed a distasteful nightmare.
Tinder generates an awful dating equation full of lazi-
ness that will not satisfy any user looking for quality dates or relationships.
Now that I’ve had enough experience with Tinder to 
write thoughtfully about it, I will be deleting it off my phone permanently.

The world is dealing with a series of cri-
ses that demand action from leaders in the U.S. The Ebola virus — if left un-
checked — could infect nearly half of a mil-lion people by January, threats of large-scale war loom large in the Middle East, Russia continues to be a hornet’s nest for Ukraine, and the big elephant in the room — climate change — continues to threaten the future stability of the entire globe.
One would expect so-called leaders to act 
to ensure the world could tackle these cri-ses before they grow out of hand, as each of them presents a dangerous scenario that has the potential to destabilize countries, regions and much of the world.
However, amid all these raging crises, 
Congress has worked a grand total of eight days since late July. 
After taking a lengthy recess in August, 
Congress returned to work for almost a week before adjourning once again to focus on the upcoming election.
Why would the legislative body of the 
world’s most powerful country take another break with crisis after crisis piling up? 
It’s simple: They must protect the jobs 
they fail to take seriously by returning to their districts to prepare for the upcoming election. 
While Congress has been 
asleep at the wheel, President Barack Obama has taken action on Ebola and worked with oth-er world leaders to combat the threat of the Islamic State. He also plans to take on the issue of climate change when he attends a U.N. summit this week. 
Regardless of your political party or ide-
ology, one thing is clear: For the future of our country and the world, we must elect true leadership in November. We can no longer afford to let our leaders dawdle and play silly political games.  They must be willing to work together, reach a compromise and act on the issues that require action. 
Ironically enough, Congress did seem to 
agree on one issue recently. Unfortunately, the agreement was reached on the prospect of going to war.
There’s no question the Islamic State — 
ISIS — threatens the very fragile Middle East. The terrorist organization has claimed a signiﬁ  cant foothold in both Syria and Iraq, and the Sunni-led group is very close to the Iraqi border with Shia-led Iran. The possi-bility of a catastrophic regional war is very real, and our political leaders acted accordingly.
Obama recently outlined 
some executive action he will take to help abate the Ebola epi-demic in West Africa. These ac-tions will hopefully help allay fears that if left unchecked, Eb-ola could threaten any remain-ing political and economic sta-
bility in West Africa.  As the virus continues to mutate, the possibility that Ebola could go airborne — like the ﬂ  u — remains a real and terrifying risk. If the world’s most powerful country does next to nothing, the threat of one of the world’s deadliest diseases creates a pandemic. 
Studies are indicating that this summer 
was the hottest in history, once again dem-onstrating that climate change is no longer a political debate. It’s quite possibly our damnation. However, we see little — if any — action in Congress, and there’s only so much power that can be exerted by the ex-ecutive branch. An estimated 310,000 people marched in New York City demanding ac-tion on climate change, but what do we hear from Congress? Silence. 
Politicians on both sides constantly argue, debate and remain deadlocked on major is-sues like immigration, student loan reform, the NFL’s tax-exempt status and a whole host of other problems.
Unfortunately, the time for action is well 
overdue. If our current crop of so-called leaders refuses to act on the pressing issues of our time, we have an obligation as citizens of our great nation to ﬁ  re those in charge and replace them with new leadership. 
If your governor, member of Congress, 
state representative or local dogcatcher is more apt to play politics and act as a con-trarian rather than negotiate, compromise and work with the other side, here’s some advice: Fire that elected ofﬁ  cial. Send them to the unemployment lines, and support someone who actually cares about your community, state, country and, ultimately, the world. 
The crises facing humanity right now are 
not the types that can or will be solved over-night but demand real leadership from the world’s most powerful country. Let’s do our duty as citizens and ﬁ  nd them.

On Monday and Tuesday, 
“Dr. Phil” aired a two-part exclusive interview 
and show called “A Mother’s Worst Nightmare,” which fea-tured a Michigan woman named Kelli Staple-ton. Last September, Stapleton was accused 
of trying to murder her daughter, Isabelle 
“Issy” Stapleton, and attempting suicide.
Issy Stapleton is an autistic teenager who 
was prone to violent outbursts, with her mother and sister taking the brunt of the 
abuse. Horriﬁ  c photos and descriptions dur-
ing the interview showed Kelli may have suffered brain damage at Issy’s hands, as well as other bruises and signs of physical 
pain.
Rather than being charged with attempt-
ed murder, Stapleton was only indicted on 
charges of ﬁ  rst-degree child abuse. Despite the lesser charge, she could face a maximum 
of a life sentence behind bars. She has not 
talked to her daughter, whose violent condi-tion is improving after treatment and thera-py since the incident.
The treatment of this tragic and compli-
cated issue by Dr. Phil has been deeply trou-bling and misleading. Kelli Stapleton said on the program that the “jail of Benzie County has been a much kinder warden than the jail 
of autism has been.” Dr. Phil then brought 
on another guest: a mother who thought about killing herself and her severely autis-tic and violent son but couldn’t bring herself 
to do it. Dr. Phil framed these segments in a 
way that seemed to practically excuse these mothers for attempting to murder their dis-abled children.
I ﬁ  rst read about the Stapleton incident 
last year in People magazine, and it kept me up at night. It appalls me that Stapleton is apparently being treated less harshly for her at-
tempted murder-suicide simply 
because her daughter is mentally 
disabled.
Issy did not consent to her mother’s at-
tempt to “take her to heaven.” Although Issy expressed violent tendencies, it doesn’t mean Issy was unhappy or in a bad place  — she may have had difﬁ  culties expressing herself, as many individuals with autism do.
Certainly, Issy Stapleton is not fully inno-
cent either. Issy would habitually attack her sister, and the girls’ mother would suffer the brunt of the violence in an attempt to protect 
her. However, Issy is, without a doubt,  the 
true victim in this situation, as she was the one who suffered an attempt on her life and languished in a coma, all caused by her own mother.
Dr. Phil should also be criticized for his 
ﬂ  ippant treatment of this sensitive issue. The media already has a penchant for portraying autistic people and those with other mental 
health issues as violent and destructive. The 
high proﬁ  le cases of mass murderers Adam Lanza and Elliot Rodger — both believed to have Aspergers’ Syndrome — have further damaged the reputation of those with men-
tal illness or neurological disorders.
Giving favorable treatment to Kelli Sta-
pleton, someone who attempted to murder 
her own daughter because of her disability, 
is appalling and absolutely unacceptable. 
Disabled lives are not worth less than any-one else’s life. Murder is murder, no matter who the intended victim is.

Speaking Out It’s been said for years 
that the pen is mightier than the sword, but in a 
time when technology and education are merging to-gether more and more each year, a new question arises: Is the pen mightier than the laptop?
Upon coming to the University of 
Texas, at Austin this Fall, I was wary about my own answer to that ques-tion. Though I have always used pen and paper to take notes, I knew I might be in the minority among my peers. I made the assumption that most college classrooms would be dotted with glow-ing MacBook laptops, and technology was the most popular source of learn-ing for students and professors alike. What I didn’t assume was that many professors at Texas prohibit electronics of any kind in the classroom. I believe this decision is beneﬁ  cial to students’ learning, and furthermore believe that a professor is well within his or her right to decide how their classroom en-vironment will be structured. 
As it turns out, professors who ban 
electronics have the right idea. In this age, students tend to think that technol-ogy is good and a lack thereof is bad. When looking at studies on the topic, however, the truth of electronic learn-ing comes out. Researchers have con-cluded that students who take notes on laptops simply don’t process the information the same as those who take notes by hand. Longhand notetakers are usually slower at notetaking than their classmates, but this is hardly a disadvantage; writing down important parts of the lecture allows these stu-dents to absorb, sort and understand the information better than those who type every word. 
Bringing a laptop to 
class also provides a screen for students to hide behind. Classes are meant to engage 
students in discussion and foster active participation in intellectual pursuits. In all likelihood, the chances of being able to actively defend an argument while checking Facebook are slim. Fur-thermore, laptop screens distract not only the student on the laptop, but also anyone who can see their screen. In a study conducted in 2010, researchers determined that students using laptops were on “distracting” screens (includ-ing email, games and general web surf-ing) for at least 42 percent of the lecture. Studies of this type are numerous and substantial. 
Despite the disadvantages of using 
technology in the classroom, students argue that they should have the right to choose how they will take notes and participate in class.
Professors who prohibit electronics 
in their class do not do so because they don’t understand technology. Rather, they usually just want to lecture in a studious, distraction-free environment, a wish that students should be respect-ful of. We trust our professors for their knowledge of difﬁ  cult and extensive subjects, so we should trust their judg-ment on a matter like this as well. If stu-dents truly wish to have a great expe-rience in their classes and a solid GPA along with that, we need to reconsider the electronic approach to classroom learning.

TALLAHASSEE — Flor-
ida State University is hir-
ing powerful state Sen. John 
Thrasher as its next president, 
despite significant opposition from people on campus who contended he isn’t qualified 
for the post.
The FSU board voted 11-2 
Tuesday to hire Thrasher over 
three academics, pushing aside objections from FSU fac-
ulty who cited his lack of edu-
cation credentials. Thrasher, a former state House speaker and chairman of Gov. Rick 
Scott’s re-election campaign, 
also drew criticism after he sidestepped questions during a campus forum about climate change and evolution.
But Thrasher’s supporters 
say his political connections and clout could help FSU in its 
quest to move into the ranks 
of the nation’s top research universities. Thrasher also vowed that he would help the university get more money to 
boost faculty salaries.
Student protesters began 
chanting “FSU is not for sale” 
after the vote.
Thrasher, 70, graduated 
from FSU in 1965 with a bach-elor’s degree in business and later received his law degree from the school. In the Legis-lature, he helped win approv-al for the university’s medical 
school, which opened in 2001. 
Thrasher also spent four years on FSU’s board. He has never taught, however, working as 
a lawyer and a lobbyist in ad-
dition to politics.
The selection still has to be 
ratified in November by the Board of Governors. But the 
statewide panel has never re-
fused to endorse the selection 
made by a local univer-
sity board.
FSU has 
been with-
out a presi-dent since 
Eric Barron 
left in April 
to take the top post at Penn State University.
Emails obtained by The 
Associated Press this past summer showed that the con-sultant first hired to help FSU told the head of the search 
committee that the university 
was trying to “concoct a com-petitive process” that would end with Thrasher’s hiring. 
Those same emails showed 
Thrasher reached out directly to top FSU officials about the job and that the former cam-paign manager of Scott gave 
advice about the search.FSU picks politician

FERGUSON, Mo. — Anger spilled over Tuesday 
after fire destroyed one of two memorials on the street 
where Michael Brown was killed, a site that has become sacred to many in Ferguson and others nationwide fo-cused on interactions between minorities and police.
How the fire happened wasn’t immediately clear, but 
it stoked fresh resentment among those who question whether the shooting of the unarmed, black 18-year-old by a white Ferguson police officer on Aug. 9 is being ad-equately investigated.
“It’s the same as if somebody came and desecrated a 
grave,” Anthony Levine of Florissant, another St. Louis suburb, said as he studied the charred scene and shook his head.
Many who gathered at the site Tuesday blamed 
police for the blaze, even as the chief said officers did everything they could to keep the stuffed animals and other items from burning.
Two memorials were put up the day Brown was 
killed. The one not damaged by fire is in the middle of Canfield Drive — a narrow band of stuffed animals, 
crosses, handmade signs and other items at the exact 
spot where Brown was shot.
The smaller memorial that burned sat a few feet away 
with teddy bears, blankets and signs circling a light post. Most residents were certain someone set the blaze. 
“That’s very disrespectful to burn down a memorial 
to someone that got killed,” said Meldon Moffitt, who lives nearby. “That’s just wrong! The police came here and watched it burn.”
Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said in an emailed 
statement that the fire left him “saddened.” He said the first officer on the scene tried to extinguish the blaze but couldn’t. The fire department eventually put it out.
By late morning, the memorial already had been re-
built with fresh teddy bears, a blanket and new signs. The light post and sidewalk remained charred. About 75 people joined hands in prayer, shouting, “We are Mike Brown!”Fire destroys Michael Brown memorial

NEW DELHI — A white tiger 
killed a young man who climbed 
over a fence at the New Delhi zoo and jumped into the animal’s enclo-sure Tuesday, a spokesman said.
Despite repeated warnings that 
he shouldn’t get too close to the outdoor enclosure, the man eventu-ally climbed over a knee-high fence, through some small hedges, then jumped down 18 feet into a protec-tive moat, said National Zoologi-cal Park spokesman Riyaz Ahmed Khan.
The male tiger, which lives on a grassy tree-filled island, grabbed the man from the moat. Footage broad-
cast on NDTV showed the tiger car-
rying the man around the island.
Authorities eventually frightened 
the tiger into a small cage inside the 
enclosure. The man, whose body remained in the outdoor enclosure two hours after the attack, was dead by the time help reached him, Khan said.
“The tiger was just being a tiger,” 
said Belinda Wright, who has spent 
years working to protect India’s 
dwindling numbers of wild tigers. “An unusual object fell into his do-main.... He’s a wild animal in cap-
tivity. It is certainly not the tiger’s 
fault.”
It’s not unusual for visitors to a 
zoo in India to taunt animals or toss bits of food through cages, even though zoo rules forbid it. Groups of visitors may sometimes throw used plastic water bottles or stones into animal enclosures to get the animal 
to react.
Deputy Commissioner of Police 
M.S. Randhawa identified the man 
only as Maqsood and said he was thought to be about 20 years old.Further details about him and the ti-ger were not immediately available.
The zoo remained open Tuesday 
afternoon, though authorities even-
tually roped off the tiger enclosure.Indian zoo: Tiger kills man in moatThrasher

MEGAN STENNES
Alligator Contributing Writer
Shoppers might be sur-
prised next time they browse 
their local grocery store’s beer selection — cans of Swamp Head Brewery’s “Stump 
Knocker” are now for sale.
The local brew is now 
available in select Gainesville 
stores, including Publix, Ward’s Supermarket, Tipple’s Brews and Gator Beverage. As Swamp Head Brewery ex-pands in the coming months to a new location, other beers, 
including Wild Night, Cot-
tonmouth, Big Nose IPA and Midnight Oil will be on store shelves.  
Construction for the new 
brewery, located at 3650 SW 42nd Ave., broke ground about two months ago near the old AMF Alley Katz Bowl-
ing Center. The new facility 
will be about 13,000 square feet, increasing its capacity tenfold.
Swamp Head marketing 
manager Brandon Nappy said he expects the new building to be up and running by the end of December. 
“It will allow us the oppor-
tunity to grow and work on projects that we have wanted 
to move forward with for 
years,” Nappy said.
The brewery’s current lo-
cation in Southwest Indus-trial Park will be demolished to make way for a new Inter-state 75 overpass, which will serve Celebration Pointe, a new shopping center current-ly being built north of Butler 
Plaza.
Swamp Head was founded 
in 2008 and started selling its 
beer the year after. The com-pany was brewing 700 barrels of beer by 2010. 
By last year, Swamp Head 
was brewing nearly 6,000 barrels. Nappy said the ex-
pansion could bring Swamp 
Head to the verge of about 50,000 barrels each year.
“The new brewery will 
allow us to have much more ﬂ  exibility with production,” he said, “so we can play around with new brands.”
The facility will feature 
a tasting room, named The Wetlands, which will have an outside porch attached to it. Though the property will border wetlands and protect-ed land, it will not interfere with them, Nappy said.
“The idea of the company 
was Floridian,” he said. “One 
of our missions is to protect 
Florida in any way we can.”
Beyond expanding its cur-
rent capacity, Swamp Head plans to one day spread to Orlando and Tallahassee. The brewery will continue to post construction updates on Face-book, Twitter and its website throughout fall.
“I think it’s exciting for 
them and myself,” said 30-
year-old Gainesville resident 
and Swamp Head patron An-drew Curcio. “It’s good to see a local business expanding at such a rapid rate. They have a good product. I enjoy their beer.”Swamp Head begins 
construction on new brewery, cans beers
INTERNATIONAL
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
NEW YORK — More than 30 
countries set the ﬁ  rst-ever deadline 
on Tuesday to end deforestation by 2030, but the feasibility of such a goal was eroded when a key player, 
Brazil, said it would not join.
The U.S., Canada and the entire 
European Union signed on to at-
tempt to halve forest loss by 2020 and end deforestation by 2030.
“This is the family photo we 
have been looking for for decades,” says Charles McNeill, a senior en-vironmental policy adviser for the 
U.N. Development Program in an 
interview with the Associated Press. “The forest issue is where everyone comes together.”
But, like any family, there were 
signs of dysfunction before the agreement was formally unveiled Tuesday. Brazil, in an interview with the Associated Press, said it would not join.
Brazil’s position also highlighted 
the divisions between countries 
as they prepare to continue nego-
tiations later this year in Peru in the hopes of meeting a late 2015 dead-line for a new international treaty.
“Unfortunately, we were not 
consulted. But I think that it’s im-possible to think that you can have a global forest initiative without Bra-zil on board. It doesn’t make sense,” 
said Brazilian Environment Minister Izabella Teixeira said in an interview 
Monday with the Associated Press.
If the goal is met, the U.N. says 
it would be the equivalent of taking 
every car off the road in the world. 
The group also pledged to restore more than 1 million square miles of forest worldwide by 2030. Norway vowed to spend $350 million to pro-tect forests in Peru and another $100 million in Liberia. But without Bra-zil, a halt to deforestation would be nearly impossible.
After the last climate change 
talks in Copenhagen ﬁ  ve years ago, which failed to produce a binding treaty, Brazil set a voluntary goal of reducing its emissions by nearly 40 percent by 2020, mostly through re-ducing deforestation and promoting renewable energy and sustainable agriculture.
US, EU pledge to end deforestation
“The forest issue is where 
everyone comes together.”

Alligator Writer @alexmaminakis
Soccer defenders aren’t usually 
celebrated after a win as much as, 
say, the forwards or the midﬁ  eld-ers. The defenders aren’t the ones scoring the goals; their jobs aren’t 
that glamorous.
Defenders do just that: They 
defend. 
They do the dirty work and get 
the ball to the team’s goal scorers.
Florida has one of the best de-
fenses in the Southeastern Con-
ference. The seniority, experience and tenacity of its defenders is a 
big reason why it is the seventh-
ranked team in the country and why its offense gets so many scor-ing opportunities.
Florida has scored 18 goals this 
year. 
Its opponents have ﬁ  ve.The starting defensive backs 
for the Gators typically consist of 
senior Lauren Silver, junior Claire 
Falknor, senior Tessa Andujar and junior Christen Westphal. 
Games are sometimes played 
with different numbers of de-fenders, and other players get substituted in and out of course, but Silver, Falknor, Andujar and Westphal have started all eight 
games this season.
The return of senior Karina 
Gutsche, who started every game 
at center defensive back last year and is coming off of an injury, doesn’t hurt either.
“It deﬁ  nitely helps to have 
experience all over the ﬁ  eld, but especially in the back line,” coach 
Becky Burleigh said, “where 
they’re having to think pessimisti-cally in advance, like ‘what hap-pens if we lose the ball, how do we handle that?’ and to have peo-ple who are experienced in those situations makes it much easier.”
Burleigh knows the value of 
a strong defense and she doesn’t take her experienced defenders for granted. 
She has compared when Lau-
ren Silver is in the game to having 
another coach on the ﬁ  eld.

The Florida women’s 
swimming and diving team 
returns to the pool this week-end as it sets to start its sea-son at home against Arkansas 
on Saturday at 11 a.m. 
Coach Gregg Troy leads 
the team once again after 
coming off a 14th consecutive top-10 ﬁ  nish in last year’s NCAA Championships, where the Gators placed sixth for the second year in a row. 
Florida lost a combined 49 
All-American honors on their roster with the departures of Elizabeth Beisel, Alicia Ma-thieu, Ellese Zalewski and Hilda Luthersdottir. These four accounted for 10 Florida school records. 
Now looking ahead to this 
year, Troy is looking to get 
the season started with his 
new bunch. 
“Always exciting starting 
a new season and especially coming off the summer we had,” Troy said. “We had a good summer for both the men and the women. Our training was good this sum-
mer. We had a lot of people 
compete internationally and do exceptionally well so we feel good about this year as we’re looking forward.” 
The men’s team does not 
begin its season until next week at the Pinch a Penny All Florida Invitational, so Troy’s focus this week will be on the women’s squad. 
And this year’s team is 
encompassed with youth — 
with nine freshmen and red-
shirt freshmen compared to just three seniors. 
But Troy is looking for-
ward to seeing what kind of team he has. 
“It’s real exciting, the be-
ginning-of-the-year training has been outstanding and with young people, they’ve 
been very enthusiastic and on 
the numbers,” Troy said. “So we’re looking forward to see-ing what we have and get a little forecast for this year.” 
With the loss of Beisel, Ma-
thieu, Zalewski and Luthers-dottir, this new-look Gators squad will be looking for new 
leadership within its young 
team, and Troy did not seem too concerned with ﬁ  nding those leaders.
“It’s hard to replace them 
ﬁ  rst thing right away,” Troy said. “From a leadership standpoint and experience, UF women’s swim 
team looks to youth to replace seniors

Every time I’ve talked with 
volleyball coach Mary Wise about speciﬁ  c positions this 
season, she always breaks them down in football terms, so that’s what I’m going to do for all you football fans that don’t know a thing about vol-leyball.
To start, Wise always says the setter is the 
team’s quarterback.
In Florida volleyball’s case, the quarter-
back is junior Mackenzie Dagostino.Like a quarterback, the setter 
plays the majority of the time.
And to quote the wise words 
of Wise: “We’re trying to get 
Mackenzie in a rhythm with her hitters, so Mackenzie gets a little more playing time because of 
that.”
And that sounds pretty accu-
rate to me.
So for Florida’s setters, there is ﬁ  rst-
stringer Dagostino and backup Abby Deter-ing, a freshman who’s seen time in only one set of one match (can we just go ahead and 
compare Detering to Treon Harris?).
But unlike Florida football quarterback 
Jeff Driskel, Dagostino is actually pretty good. She’s 28th in the nation in assists per set (11.06). 
To compare, Driskel is 99th in quarter-
back efﬁ  ciency this season.
Dagostino has also helped lead her team 
to wins against then-No. 13 San Diego and then-No. 6 Southern California.
Next are the outside hitters and middle blockers.
These guys are basically your skill posi-
tion players — your wide receivers, running 
backs and tight ends.
To put into perspective, freshman middle 
blocker Rhamat Alhassan is like the Demar-
cus Robinson of the team.
Except she’s two inches taller than him, 
so there’s that.
But she’s crazy talented for having only 
played volleyball for two years before enter-ing college, and she has become one of Flori-On the court: Comparing UF’s volleyball and football teams

Coach Paul Spangler has 
seen countless freshmen run-
ners through the years, but 
maybe none quite as mature 
and impressive as Lauren 
Brasure and Thomas Howell.
Both runners picked up 
awards Tuesday, with Bra-sure bringing home South-
eastern Conference Women’s 
Freshman Runner of the Week, and Howell earning Men’s Runner of the Week.
Brasure shattered UF re-
cords on Saturday, and How-ell repeated his success at Western Carolina with anoth-er top-5 finish as the women 
won the Mountain Dew Invi-
tational and the men finished in second.
For Howell, his training 
and endurance trumped the grueling 8k as he finished his second collegiate race in a time of 24:45.76.
Quite the feat unto itself, 
it immediately becomes more impressive when considering that it was the first competi-tive 8k he had ever run.
It was a performance that 
Spangler could only describe 
as “phenomenal.”
“I’m going to keep doing 
what I’m doing, listen to my 
coach and learn from these 
older guys,” Howell said. 
“I’m just going to do the best I can to score for this team and contribute to our suc-
cess.”
For the women, it wasn’t 
enough for the trio of Bra-
sure, redshirt freshman Becky Greene and sophomore Tay-
lor Tubbs to beat Georgia 
Tech by 32 points.
Brasure needed to turn 
in the best performance by 
a Gator in the history of the 
race.
She picked up the first win 
of her short career on Satur-day, winning the 5k with a 
time of 16:45.93, crossing the 
line nearly 20 seconds faster than the previous record of 17:05.59 set by Genevieve 
LaCaze in 2011.
“For Lauren to come in 
and run that, she ran about 
40-seconds faster than her PR in high school,” Spangler 
said.
A second faster, and Bra-
sure would have broken the 
all-time course record. She 
will have to settle for the best 
time in 24 years, when Patty Wiegand of Tennessee set the record in 1990.
With the men losing out 
on first place to Georgia Tech, Spangler knows the key to winning relies on the depth of their young runners.
They’re the future of the 
team, after all.
For now, the team will dwell on the records and po-tential their young runners 
are showing as the women 
travel to Lehigh University on Oct. 4 for the Paul Short Run, scheduled to feature some of the nation’s elite teams. 
The men have an extra 
week of preparation, as their next race will be Oct. 11 in Orlando for the Walt Disney Invitational.

Thomas Howell races during the 2014 Mountain Dew In -
vitational on Saturday at the Mark Bostick Golf Course.
When the defense is able to hold off the 
opponent’s attacks, steal the ball and main-
tain possession, it can turn into fast breaks and scoring opportunities for the offense.
Florida’s leader in assists this year is 
Andujar, who plays up the sideline and consistently serves balls in for the forwards and midfielders to have a chance to score.
Falknor is another one of those experi-
enced defenders for Florida who makes a big impact. 
She was one of only three players in Fri-
day’s win over Alabama who played the full 90 minutes. 
The other two were senior Taylor Burke, 
the goalkeeper, and sophomore Savannah Jordan, the team’s leading goal scorer.
“As defense, we start the offense,” Fal-
knor said. “Also, we have to make sure we communicate and stay organized in the back.”
Falknor said she embraces the role on 
the team as communicator among the de-
fensive unit and organizer of the defense’s 
positioning.
“As center back, it’s really important for 
communication, so I’d say communication is a big role of mine,” Falknor said. “Since everything’s in front of me, I see a lot.”
Burleigh had nothing but praise for 
her defense that has been so strong for the Gators thus far this season, Falknor in par-
ticular.
“I think we have three really great cen-
ter backs, and we’ve utilized those some-
times, in the system we play,” Burleigh said. “I think that Claire can attack out of the back, she becomes a dangerous weapon for us both defensively and offensively … she’s just been a big asset to us.”Andujar leads 
UF in assists this season

Both set PRs Saturdayit’s not even the leadership as much as the ex-
perience. Seeing how these freshmen will re-spond, they’ll develop some leadership skills themselves and what we’ve seen from them already is a tremendous interest in one another 
in what they’re doing. I think leadership could 
come from all areas, it doesn’t just have to be seniors.”
Among the freshmen Troy will rely on is 
Chelsea Lawson, who is from Fife, Scotland. 
Lawson won the 200-meter backstroke at the 
Scottish National Championships in 2014 and is the Scottish record-holder in the 200m back for the 17-year-old age group. Other freshmen 
include Ally Donahue, a Tampa native who 
graduated high school early and was ranked as the No. 15 recruit in Florida in the class of 2014 according to CollegeSwimming.com, and Paige Scheriger out of Hendersonville, Tenn., who 
qualified for the 2012 U.S. Olympics Trials in 
Omaha, Neb.
Coach Troy also talked about how he felt 
starting this season earlier than most, having a dual meet against Arkansas a week before the Invitational. 
“It puts you in a little disadvantage com-
pared to where we’ve been in the past,” Troy said. “When you start with that Invitational, you swim two events and see everyone in a lot of different places so you really know what people are capable of. This one, we’ll be a little blind in some events in what we can actually do and how these freshmen will respond in back-to-back swims in a dual meet. It will help us in what we will need to address next week in the 
Invitational.”
da’s most consistent scorers.
The Glenarden, Md., native ac-
tually has the third-highest hitting 
percentage (.510) in all of college 
volleyball.
Now, while Alhassan is the 
Robinson of the team, it’s undeni-
able that Noami Santos-Lamb (but 
really we should all be calling her 
Santos-SLAM because the girl has an arm) is the volleyball version of Kelvin Taylor.
You may be asking, Eden, why? 
How can a volleyball player be 
like a running back?
This is easy.
Just because volleyball play-
ers don’t run as much as a football player (even if I have seen them sprint halfway down court to save a ball) doesn’t mean speed and ac-curacy aren’t important.
Santos-Lamb has a 55-mile per 
hour jump serve. Not to mention, anytime Wise talks about Santos-Lamb, she mentions that Santos-
Lamb has a cannon of an arm.
To put into perspective, this 
5-foot-11 redshirt-junior can liter-
ally serve a ball faster than most cars can go from zero to 30.
So while she’s not running, 
she’s definitely focused on speed and accuracy.
And then there is right-side hit-
ter Alex Holston, who can pretty much do it all.
I’m going to say Holston is the 
Trey Burton of volleyball — yes, I know, he doesn’t even go here any-more — but it’s true.
Quick note: remember when 
Florida used a three-option quar-
terback system and Burton was one 
of the options? Holston is basically in that same situation (she serves, blocks, passes and scores), but it’s actually not a disaster.
And Holston leads Florida in 
service aces this season (25), which is pretty much the football equiv-alent to the Hail Mary actually 
working. 
After Holston comes middle 
blocker Simone Antwi, who show-
cases experience and consistency.
Antwi is comparable to run-
ning back Matt Jones because she’s 
reliable. When things aren’t going 
well, just give the ball to Antwi.
Then there are your defensive 
specialists.
These guys are like the offen-
sive and defensive line. They just protect the court as much as they can.
They don’t usually score and 
basically do the dirty work.
Wise has always referred to 
them as the worker bees, which seems really accurate for their po-
sition because man do they work.
First (and most importantly) 
on defense is Holly Pole. She has 
recently become Florida’s starting libero, which is like saying she’s 
the center in football.
The libero works so closely with 
the setter (they are the only two players that are guaranteed to be 
on the court for the majority of a set) that it only makes sense to say she’s a center.
And Pole and Florida football 
center Max Garcia are new to their respective starting position this season. 
The comparison just works so 
perfectly.
Pole may be new to the libero spot, but the senior is learning quickly, which is why she has con-tinued to start as libero for the last six matches.
Now Taylor Unroe, Maddie 
Monserez and Nikki O’Rourke, they are most certainly the defen-sive line. 
These three are subbed in and 
out pretty often and are used to making big saves (think tipping the football when the opposing quarterback throws the ball for the game-winning score). 
They are constantly on the 
ground making sure the opposing team isn’t getting the point. 
So now that you understand the 
positions — and maybe some of the language — go forth and watch 
volleyball because Wise knows, it’s 
just like football.

Florida baseball continues to bring 
in talent.
The Gators’ 2014 recruiting class 
ranked No. 3 in the country, accord-
ing to Collegiate Baseball newspa-
per’s annual evaluation of NCAA 
Division I baseball classes which was released on Monday.
The evaluation placed nine South-
eastern Conference teams’ recruiting classes in the top 40, while ﬁ  ve (No. 1 LSU, No. 3 Florida, No. 14 Kentucky, No. 15 Ole Miss, No. 16 Arkansas) found themselves in the top 20.
This marks the sixth year that UF 
coach Kevin O’Sullivan has a recruit-ing class ranked in the top eight in the country and the fourth year that it ranked in the top ﬁ  ve.Seven of O’Sullivan’s 11 recruits 
— 10 freshmen and a junior-college transfer — were selected in the 2014 MLB Draft back in June.
“We have seven drafted players in 
school after having a school-record eight draftees come to Florida last year, so that has given us a strong foundation in back-to-back years,” 
O’Sullivan said in a release. “This 
group complements our needs going forward.”
Catcher JJ Schwarz, the brother of 
UF softball junior Taylor Schwarz, was the highest drafted player, be-ing selected by the Milwaukee Brew-ers in the 17th round with the 506th pick.

In just one week, freshman 
Ryan Celano has gone from 
an unknown commodity to winning the qualifying for the Wolf Run Intercollegiate to 
having the best tournament 
of any player on the Florida men’s golf team in Zionsville, Ind. 
Celano acted as the catalyst 
for the Gators as they ﬁ  nished in second place in their second event of the year. 
Celano completed the tour-
nament at 6-over-par, which was good enough for a tie in sixth place. 
Coach J.C. Deacon was hap-
py with the way Celano played in his opening tournament.
“I’m really proud of Ryan 
Celano,” Deacon said in a re-lease. “He ﬁ  nished in sixth 
place individually. It was a 
wonderful start for his college career, and he showed us what he can do and how good he can be.”
Celano’s performance in Zi-
onsville comes on the heels of winning the qualifying for the tournament the week before by four strokes. 
Celano not only competed 
with veterans, but was also able to domi-nate in the 
qualifying after heading into the ﬁ  nal day with an eight shot lead.
The Gators sorely needed 
someone to come into the 
lineup and provide life to the 
team after a disappointing ﬁ  rst tournament. 
Deacon and the coaching 
staff made a couple of changes to the lineup and were able to strike gold with Celano.
In Zionsville, Celano im-
proved his score in each round, and after shooting a 4-over-par in the ﬁ  rst round, he shot a 2-over, 73 in the second round. 
In the ﬁ  nal day, Celano shot 
an even-par round and was 
able to move up eight spots on 
the leaderboard to sixth place. Celano’s score was two strokes better than senior and team-mate J.D. Tomlinson.
Prior to coming to Florida, 
Celano was able to have a suc-cessful prep career where he was given numerous honors 
including being named the 
Naples Daily News Area Play-er of the Year four times. 
He followed up his prep ca-
reer with a successful amateur career before arriving at UF. 
With all the success Celano 
already has in his golﬁ  ng ca-reer, Deacon said Celano has 
all the tools necessary to be-
come an impact player.   
“He’s just a great player,” 
Deacon said. “He’s got all the shots, he’s got the power, he’s got the ﬁ  nesse and he really wants to be great. He’s willing to put in the extra effort.” Celano impresses in Indiana
