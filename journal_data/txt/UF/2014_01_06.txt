Thousands of UF students return 
to campus today for the new se-
mester, but some had to come back to Gainesville without their loved ones. Over Winter Break, the Gator 
Nation lost three UF students.
Though they may no longer be 
among the crowd on Turlington Plaza, sitting nearby in lecture or cheering from the bleachers in The Swamp, their memories live on through their friends and families.
…Brandon Mead and Ashlee Light-
ner were excited to celebrate Christ-mas in their new apartment.
Almost every day, Mead, a 
22-year-old UF mathematics senior, and Lightner, 26, would drive from the small Cabana Beach apartment they shared with a roommate to check out their new place at Uptown Village at Townsend, said neighbor Brittany Bennis.
“They were so happy together,” 
Bennis, 20, said. “They’d only been dating since July, but it was almost like they’d known each other their whole lives, like an old married couple.”
Five days before the couple planned to move, they got into Mead’s black Nissan 300Z to go for a ride.
They never came back.Mead hit a roundabout at the cor-
ner of Southwest 24th Avenue and Southwest 38th Terrace at a high speed, crashing into a large oak tree

� HIGH DIVE HAS BANNED SMOKING 
INDOORS, AND BEEF ‘O’ BRADY’S RECENTLY CLOSED.

Business ventures during Winter Break brought another 
Dunkin’ Donuts close to campus and banned smoking 
inside High Dive. Gainesville also lost two popular campus-area restaurants.
Beef ‘O’ Brady’s on University Avenue, known by 
students for its penny wine night, recently closed, as did Kay Bros. BBQ. 
But the barbecue restaurant announced its same 
management team is opening another joint called “The Coop,” which will offer chicken tenders, wings and shakes. 
It is set to open Jan. 11 at 1620 W. University Ave. between 
Larry’s Giant Subs and Sushi Chao.
Near Target Copy, Dunkin’ Donuts will likely soon be 
rolling in the dough.
The second franchise on University Avenue opened Dec. 
28, about a half mile from the existing Midtown Dunkin’ Donuts.  
Steve Galloway, the franchise owner, said the new store 
at 1412 W. University Ave. is a full-service Dunkin’ Donuts and includes Baskin Robbins. 
He said he thinks pedestrians will appreciate the second 
University Avenue location even though it’s near the other store.
“Our experience on campus is that the trade zones are 
measured in blocks, not miles,” he said. “Convenience is a key factor for how people get around on foot and on bikes.”
He said he also expects the print shop and doughnut 
shop duo will succeed.Break brings less 
smoke, no more penny wine night

Paul Ramsuchit didn’t spend his 
New Year’s Eve as planned. 
Instead, the 20-year-old UF health 
sciences junior spent the afternoon 
driving up to Gainesville from his hometown in Orlando after Gainesville Police called to tell him that his apart-ment was broken into as part of a string of Winter Break burglaries.
The burglaries occurred between Dec. 14 and Dec. 26, likely at night, in two local apartment complexes, said GPD Lt. William Halvosa. TVs, Xbox consoles and jewelry were among the items taken.
Up to 11 apartments at the Estates, 
3527 SW 20th Ave., and 10 apartments at Oxford Terrace, 921 SW Depot Ave., were hit, Halvosa said. 
Investigators are assuming the 
burglaries are related because similar techniques were used to break into both apartment buildings. 
Although there is no sign of forced entry, it appears the locks at the apart-ments were tampered with, Halvosa said.
He added that the department nor-
mally notices an increase in burglary activity during Winter Break. 
“Not like this, though,” he said.In Ramsuchit’s case, two TVs and 
an Apple iMac computer were stolen, along with other items owned by his roommates. He said he hopes apart-ment complexes will consider hiring guards to patrol during weeks when  students are out of town.

Fugitive Ga. banker suspected 
in marijuana case 
ATLANTA — Authorities 
suspect a former Georgia banker,  who disappeared 18 months ago and who faces allegations he stole millions from investors,  was growing marijuana in a home in Florida.
Aubrey Lee Price, 47, turned 
up earlier this week when he was arrested during a trafﬁ  c stop on Interstate 95, in the coastal Georgia city of Brunswick. Price vanished in June 2012 and faces federal charges in Georgia and New York related to accusations he stole millions from the bank he ran and from investors.
When Price disappeared, 
investigators said he sent a rambling confession letter to his family and acquaintances saying he had lost millions of dollars and planned to kill himself by jumping from a ferry in Florida.
It’s not clear exactly what he 
has been doing for the past 18 months. 
He has told authorities he 
had worked odd jobs and as a migrant worker, and police now believe he was renting a house in Florida and growing marijuana.
A Florida man called 
authorities Wednesday to report ﬁ  nding marijuana plants in the garage of a home he rented to a man he knew as Jason, according to a police report from the Marion County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce in Ocala. 
Sheriff’s deputies removed 
225 marijuana plants, 85 from the garage and 140 more from a mobile home on the property, the report said.

‘Breaking Bad’ winner arrested on drug charges
FORT MYERS — Authorities 
say a Florida man who won a rafﬂ  e to watch the series ﬁ  nale of AMC’s “Breaking Bad” with the cast has been charged with running an interstate synthetic marijuana distribution operation.
The Lee County Sheriff’s 
Ofﬁ  ce reports that Ryan Lee Carroll ran the operation from his Fort Myers home with two other men. He was arrested on New Year’s Eve.
Authorities seized more than 
$1 million in synthetic marijuana during the bust.According to deputies, the 
suspects used a cement mixer to create the drugs. The drugs were shipped through the U.S. Postal Service to other states.
Investigators also seized a 
souvenir Hazmat suit signed by “Breaking Bad” cast members. “Breaking Bad” follows a former high school teacher producing and selling meth with a previous student.

Guns, gators, Festivus part of Florida’s weird year 
TALLAHASSEE — You 
know you’re living in a weird state when there’s a Festivus pole made out of beer cans displayed in the Capitol, a man offers to trade a live alligator for a 12-pack of beer, and a homeowners association has to create a no-swimming-as-a-mermaid rule.
Florida is the kind of state 
where lawmakers found it necessary to pass a law that bans using food stamps in strip bars. 
It’s a state where dogs 
are trained to sniff out giant African land snails. 
It was, once again, a weird 
year in Florida.
At least six people were 
struck by bullets falling from the sky during celebratory gunﬁ  re for New Year’s Eve, the Miami Heat’s championship and the Fourth of July.
There were simply odd calls 
to 911, like the man arrested in Pinellas County that drunk-dialed 911 complaining his drug dealer was mad at him. 
A St. Petersburg man was 
arrested after authorities said he dialed 911 about 80 times and asked for Kool-Aid, burgers and weed to be delivered.
A bailiff in Marion County 
resigned after love letters he sent to a female prisoner were discovered.
A Sarasota mall was 
evacuated and shut down for two hours after a man sprinkled some of his

Jan. 6, 1964 
UF’s mascot “Albert the original” returned to The 
Swamp. The live alligator was hauled to the Plaza of the Americas for ABC’s television program “Hootenanny.” He traveled from his home at Ross Allen’s Reptile Ranch in Ocala for the special program. UF students gathered around to be ﬁ  lmed for the show, which featured per-formances by Johnny Cash and comedian Adam Keefe.
Jan. 6, 1971 Hooligans vandalized the Sigma Alpha Epsilon lion 
“Leo” over Winter Break, smashing off its head and tail. White paint was thrown on the lion’s platform and on the front wall of the SAE house. University Police didn’t have any leads, but investigator G.E. Watson said the lion, which was a “sitting target,” was a frequent victim of this sort of prank.  
Jan. 10, 1989  
It was the ﬁ  rst day of her freshman year at UF when 
Patricia Palmer was mugged in the parking lot next to Flavet Field. A man riding a bicycle behind her shoved her to the ground and stole her “expensive, name-brand” purse, which contained about $10 and some credit cards. The mugging happened at about 9 a.m., just after she left her ﬁ  rst class. Palmer was not injured, but according to police spokesman Angie Tipton, cam-pus muggings weren’t a common occurrence. “We’ve only had one other mugging on campus since I’ve been here,” she said. 
Jan. 6, 1999A Morgan Quinto report named Gainesville’s met-
ropolitan area the 11th most dangerous city in the U.S. The research company analyzed FBI data on rape, rob-bery, assault and motor vehicle theft from 255 cities. The report labeled Gainesville as more dangerous than Jacksonville, Baltimore and Los Angeles. “I ﬁ  nd it very hard to believe,” said Mayor Paula DeLaney. “With all the cities in the U.S., … who would believe that?” 
Jan. 8, 2007 UF fraternity Alpha Tau Omega was “suspended 
until further notice,” while Student Judicial Affairs investigated accusations of hazing. The fraternity was accused of “depriving new members of sleep, order-ing them to clean older member’s rooms and throwing them in a ‘mud pit.’” UF spokesman Steve Orlando told the Alligator that the alleged sleep deprivation, called “the lineup,” involved requiring the newer members to recite various fraternity creeds in the early morning. Failure to perfectly recall the passages meant getting thrown into the mud pit behind the house.

The men were described as loving, passionate and charismatic
and flipping the car. Just after 1 a.m. 
on Dec. 10, Gainesville Police found the vehicle upside down against the tree, engulfed in 30-foot-tall flames.
Mead was studying to become 
an actuary, a profession involving estimating the financial consequenc-es of risk.
Now, Brandon Mead’s father, 
Gary, has no one to talk football with on Sundays. Brandon Mead’s Friday-night Magic: The Gathering card games are one player short.
“I walk around with a ‘Gator 
Dad’ T-shirt on,” Gary Mead, of Coral Springs, said. “I’m just won-dering how to go on.”
With Mead, Lightner was the 
happiest she’d ever been, said Mi-chael Stanley, 21, her friend since childhood.
“Every time he was around her, 
she was smiling, and she didn’t used to be like that,” he said.
Sometimes, Bennis tries to con-
vince herself Mead and Lightner are still alive. They just moved, she tells herself.
But the memories of times spent 
laughing on Mead’s couch keep her going.
“I look around and see all these 
people who never got to meet them,” she said. “We were the lucky ones.”
…Rafael Valim didn’t learn for 
school. He learned for life.
Born in Araras, Brazil, Valim 
moved to the United States in 2000 and enrolled as a transfer student at UF, where he met Adam Mahardy. 
They loved to design and build 
furniture.
“He was always working on 
something,” said Mahardy, his best friend. “Almost like a mad scien-tist.”
Valim, a senior architecture stu-
dent, died Dec. 26. He was 25.
After graduating, Valim planned 
to take a year off and either intern in America or go to Germany with his brother and pursue something in design.
“He wasn’t really planning the 
exact route you’re supposed to after graduating,” said Mahardy, a 25-year-old UF architecture senior. 
Mahardy said he was stunned 
when he got the news, worried that Valim’s time spent in school and as-pirations would be in vain. 
But Mahardy said the world 
won’t be cheated of Valim’s vision.
“His ideals will live on through 
my work. The mark I leave upon this earth will be much deeper and will read of his influences,” Mahar-dy later wrote.
Mahardy chooses to remember 
Rafael the designer, Rafael the fight-er: a person with raw design talent who wouldn’t have cared if he lived simply, as long as he was doing something that made him happy.
In one word, Valim was “limit-
less.”There will be a memorial for 
Valim on Jan. 9 at 6 p.m. in the school of architecture’s atrium.

On paper, James Polatty was a 
23-year-old UF pre-medical senior. 
But to his friends in the UF com-
munity, he was better known as Jim-my, the Phi Kappa Tau brother with the contagious smile who could be-friend anyone.
“He was always the first one to 
rally up the guys when anyone was down in the dumps, and he was al-ways the first one to get the party started,” said Drew Zervos, a 20-year-old UF finance junior and fel-low Phi Tau brother.
Polatty passed away Tuesday.Jin Kim, Polatty’s close friend and 
roommate, described his gregarious, fun-loving personality.
“You never knew what was go-
ing to come out of his mouth next,” said Kim, a 21-year-old UF food and resource economics senior.
Zervos recalled a time when the 
Phi Tau brothers were at a house party. 
Some pedestrians started throw-
ing bottles at the house. 
Polatty didn’t hesitate — he went 
outside and confronted them.
“We knew he always had our 
back,” Zervos said.
Kim also shared moments when 
Polatty’s serious side came out. Kim recalled when Polatty stayed up with him until 4 or 5 a.m. smoking cigars and talking about life.
“He was the most kindred spirit 
I ever knew in my entire life,” Kim said.
Amy Havlock, a 23-year-old UF 
alumna, knew Polatty from their days of attending high school to-gether in Sebring, Fla., where they competed on swim team together and he wrestled while she kept score.
Havlock mentioned a photo from 
a school formal that summarized her friend best: Polatty wearing a pink tuxedo surrounded by a group of grinning friends.
“He’s rockin it,” she said. “He 
was going to do what he wanted to do. That’s Jimmy – making people around him smile.”students , from page 1

“The fact that Target Copy is there generates a lot of

Downtown, the concert venue High Dive has a new 
no-smoking-indoors policy, which became effective 
Wednesday.
The decision was made mostly by patron request, said 
promoter Pat Lavery, and many of the bands prefer no smoking indoors, too.
“Over the last year, it’s come up a number of times, 
and we decided the new year was a good time to start it,” he said.
The decision follows suit with other downtown bars, 
which only allow outdoor smoking. 
At High Dive, patrons can still smoke in the outdoor 
deck area.
“I think it’s going to be a really positive thing,” he 
said. “People have been asking for it for a while.”MONDAY, JANUARY 6, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Florida Smoking Law
In 2003, a state amendment made 
Florida’s enclosed workplaces, which 
includes restaurants and public places, 
completely smoke-free. But bars are 
exempt from the requirements. According 
to the law, “’smoking’ means inhaling, 
exhaling, burning, carrying, or possessing 
any lighted tobacco product, including 
cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, and any 
other lighted tobacco product.”Reader response

Apply to be an 
Alligator columnist
Welcome back, Gators! Breaking news: It is about to be 
COLD in Gainesville. Like, seriously. Pull those hats and mittens out of retirement, and for those of you 
who rely on scooters as your main method of transportation — we are so sorry.
About a week ago, we all said goodbye to 2013 and all its 
drama: the government shutdown, Twerkgate and the National Security A leaks. Here’s to hoping 2014 brings jetpacks, hover-boards and governmental efﬁ  ciency. Hey, we can dream. 
We also said goodbye to a few of our regular columnists and 
cartoonists, which means the Alligator wants you, reader, to ﬁ  ll those spots. Alligator Opinions currently needs two or three new columnists and cartoonists, so those of you who are artistic and opinionated should consider applying. 
The Alligator publishes ﬁ  ve times a week — Monday through 
Friday — during the Fall and Spring semesters. This means we need students of every age, major, year, political ideology and walk of life to write weekly 500- to 600-word columns and con-tribute pithy and humorous cartoons each week.
Above all, a columnist’s job is to take a stand using facts and 
sources to defend his or her opinions. Columnists should frame their arguments in an articulate, structured and succinct manner and should strive to present original topics and material.
Writers and cartoonists interested in contributing weekly 
content should submit a cover letter, resume and two or three 500-word writing or cartoon samples to opinions@alligator.org by 5 p.m. Thursday. The samples should be representative of what your column or cartoon would look like. Anything is fair game: politics, pop culture, science, health and ﬁ  tness, LGBT topics, technology and more. Columnist applicants should pro-vide a brief description of their political ideology in their cover letters. Please note that “Democrat” and “Republican” are politi-cal parties, not ideologies. Vulgarity and hate speech will not be considered. 
If you’ve been previously published or run a blog, please 
include links. Columnist applicants do not have to be journal-ism or English majors; however, strong written communication skills and the ability to meet deadlines are required. 
Columnists would submit one column per week of about 580 
- 650 words, and cartoonists would submit one or two cartoons per week. Contributing to Alligator Opinions represents a great opportunity to build a professional portfolio of published clips. 
If you apply and are not selected as a weekly columnist, we 
still strongly encourage you to submit guest columns and let-ters to the editor. We accept these submissions throughout the semester and value input from our readers on campus happen-ings, local, state and national politics, and anything else that ap-pears on the op-ed pages.
Guest columns should be about 450 words, and they should 
include the author’s name, year, major and the school he or she attends. All statistics, references, facts and ﬁ  gures should be sourced and cited. Letters to the editor should be about 200 words and should include the author’s name and any relevant information — major, organizations he or she belongs to, etc.
Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgHave a good ﬁ  rst day of 
classes, Gators!Today’s question: Are you excited about the 
upcoming cold weather?Obama needs to shut down his campaign
If President Barack Obama is in need of a New Year’s resolution, I have the perfect one: Shut down your campaign. 
For whatever reason, Obama’s campaign — once 
known as Obama For America and now Organizing For Action — is still active, raising money, training volunteers and pushing the president’s agenda. 
Organizing for Action is separate from stalwart Dem-
ocratic organizations such as the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic Governor’s Association. Those groups are key to Democratic victories this fall. OFA is not. 
In fact, OFA’s existence is detrimental to Democrats 
across the country.
While it’s one thing to keep a president’s political cam-
paign active between the ﬁ  rst and second term, it’s an entirely different situation to keep the campaign going beyond the second election. It’s unnecessary and a little unnerving. 
As the fundraising emails piled up before New Year’s 
Eve, I wondered where on Earth the raised money was go-ing. Obama is barred from running for a third term, his ap-proval ratings are down and the campaign doesn’t seem capable of generating widespread support for his agenda.
Obama had a miserable 2013. His poll numbers tanked 
after the shaky launch of the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance exchanges, the unfolding scandal surround-ing National Security Agency spying and his inability to bridge the great partisan divide in Congress.
If Obama had a grassroots army at his disposal, with 
staffers providing the marching orders and millions of dollars to spend, why did 2013 end up as such a miserable failure for the president?
The reason is simple: Organizing For America isn’t 
helping Democrats, the president or anyone else. It takes money away from other Democrats and progressive causes, and it appears sketchy to keep a now defunct presidential campaign active.
It’s understandable that 
Obama wants supporters to push his agenda in a grassroots effort, but at this point, it would be far better for the president and fellow Democrats to shut 
down OFA and help other Democratic organizations raise money for the 2014 campaign.
It also opens up the door for a growing divide between 
Democrats and “Obamacrats.” The president’s strongest supporters may be unwilling to donate to an organization not afﬁ  liated with Obama and may even consider other Democrats — including 2016 presidential contenders — a threat. Not only is that a dangerous notion, it could make a 2016 Republican victory easier.
If Democrats — including the “Obamacrats” —  want 
Obama to succeed throughout his second term, they’re going to need strong Democrats at every level of govern-ment. Actively fundraising for OFA strips campaign funds and campaign organization from the Democrats who need it most: those actually campaigning for ofﬁ  ce.
Right now, money donated to Obama’s defunct presi-
dential campaign can’t go to Democrats running for House, Senate or governor. Money that Democrats such as Charlie Crist need to beat a well-funded incumbent like Rick Scott disappear into a vacuum, never to be seen again.
So with that, I say to you, Mr. President, for the good

Gainesville Police arrested a lo-
cal man Saturday night after offi-
cers said he walked into an apart-ment complex, fired two shots in the air and threatened to shoot someone.
Police arrested 22-year-old Dar-
ius Stephon Young on charges of aggravated assault with a weapon, armed trespassing and grand theft of a firearm, among other charges, according to an arrest report.
A mother of three and resident 
of the complex noticed a man wearing a red vest and jeans walk into Gardenia Gardens apartment complex, located at 1727 NE Eighth Ave., according to the report.
The woman was putting her 
children to bed when she saw him shoot in the air, she said in a phone interview after the shoot-ing. She then told her children and nieces to hide in the room and di-aled 911. She and another witness told 
police that several people, includ-ing children, were outside in com-mon areas of the complex when Young made the threats, accord-ing to the report. 
A second 
resident of the complex was standing in the parking lot when he heard a gun-shot, according to the report. He then heard the 
door of his apartment slam shut.
The man ran into his unit to 
check on his girlfriend and four children. Instead, he found Young backing away from the couch, ac-cording to the report. He yelled at Young to leave.
Young ran out of the apart-
ment and confronted police out-side, who told him to get on the ground. When he didn’t, officers had to force him down, according to the arrest report.
Officers found a 9 mm hand-
gun under the couch cushions at the second victim’s apartment af-ter the man told police Young had possibly hid something there, ac-cording to the report.
During questioning, Young 
told officers he went to the com-plex to confront a specific person but did not specify whom or why, according to the report. He also admitted to hiding the gun in the apartment.
Young is a convicted felon with 
previous charges ranging from ag-gravated assault to cocaine posses-sion, according to court records. The handgun he used in the shoot-ing was one of 19 firearms report-ed stolen out of Chiefland, Fla., in June, according to the report.
Officers booked Young into 
the Alachua County Jail at about 11 p.m. Saturday, where he re-mained as of press time in lieu of a $600,000 bond.

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
LAKELAND, Fla. — The 
list of honors that have been 
awarded to architect Santiago Calatrava is distinguished, but the naming of a once-scrawny cat on the Florida Polytechnic University campus marks the first time he has had a con-struction site mascot named after him.
The young black-and-
white cat known as Kittiago Calatrava — thought to have been tossed out a car win-dow — was barely alive when Skanska senior superintendent Rick Lee noticed him at the construction site for the new university.
One aspect of the cat’s ad-
opted family that seems to amuse others at the site is the unbridled devotion of Chuck Jablon, operations vice presi-dent and known tough-guy personality. Jablon turns into a baby-talking fool when he’s around the cat. And he doesn’t care who knows it.
“He’s a good, good boy,” 
Jablon says, patting Kittiago, who was sitting on the deck outside the work trailer as the sun shone down upon them one recent morning. 
“Say ‘I am here every day, 
and I’m loyal, and I’m faith-ful,’” he speaks for the cat, who appeared a bit bored.
He does have an important 
job, and they say he does it very well. He has about 50 ad-mirers who visit him regularly and generally receives at least 60 love pats per day, Jablon said. Architect’s namesake

Oh, the weather outside is about to 
get frightful.
As an arctic blast the National 
Weather Service calls “historic and 
dangerous” chills the rest of the nation today and Tuesday, UF students will experience winter Florida-style.
Temperatures will be in the mid-40s 
by this afternoon, according to UF’s campus weather forecast. Tonight, lows will hover around 20 degrees. 
But the coldest temperatures will be Tuesday morning, WRUF Chief Meteorologist Jeff Huffman wrote in an email. 
“WRUF Weather is forecasting a 
low temperature of 20, but the wind chill (what it will feel like) will be be-tween 8 and 15,” he said. “Tuesday afternoon’s warmest temperature will likely not hit 40.”
Huffman said the jet stream has 
dipped unusually far to the south, al-lowing air straight from the Arctic Circle to move deep into the United States.
“This is certainly not unprec-edented, but it could be the coldest Gainesville has experienced since 2003,” he said.
However, snow is not a possibility.Regardless, UF health science se-
nior Hannah Chiou is prepared for the cold. The 21-year-old said she bought several wool sweaters at thrift stores over Winter Break.
“I’m ready to rock them, because 
it’ll only be cold for a couple of weeks, max,” she said.
Huffman said conditions will be 
warmer by Wednesday afternoon, when temperatures will be near 60.

A Gainesville2Go employee 
was arrested Friday after of-
ficers said he wrote $40,000 worth of fraudulent checks.
Gainesville Police charged 
22-year-old Michael David Tat-um on charges of grand theft and uttering a forged instru-ment, according to an arrest report.
Jeremiah Loper, general 
manager of Gainesville2Go, said in a phone interview that he and owner Andrew Gor-relick were reviewing business records when they noticed a se-ries of forged checks, the first of which was written on Dec. 2. 
Tatum, an employee of two 
years, was fired in mid-Decem-ber. Loper said Tatum made several excuses for the missing funds, including that he used the money to fix the company car and to pay for cancer treat-ment.
Tatum told police Gaines-
ville2Go is an “open business” and employees regularly write their own paychecks from the business account, according to the report. 
During questioning, Tatum 
told police he wrote $1,500 in fake checks to pay for his medical bills, according to the report.
Loper said in the merchant 
account alone, Tatum wrote about $5,000 worth of checks, including one to his mom for a few hundred dollars.

� “THE CHEF’S TABLE WITH RANDAL WHITE” 
AIRS ON SATURDAYS AT NOON.
STEVEN KATONA
Alligator Staff Writer skatona@alligator.org
 WUFT-TV just got a little fresher with an addition 
to its how-to and do-it-yourself programming. Slic-
ing into its Saturday lineup is a local cooking show featuring southern, traditional-style recipes.
Airing at noon, the 30-minute show “The Chef’s 
Table with Randal White” aims to tackle all of the different types of cuisines found throughout Florida, including deep Southern, Spanish and seafood. 
Its goal is to instruct and educate Floridians about 
the fresh and native products found throughout the peninsula, using local farmers and meat markets.
Chef Randal White calls his particular culinary 
style “Southern cracker cooking” and said he’s tak-ing these traditional cooking styles and “just trying to make it a little different.”
The show is available in Gainesville on Cox Cable 
Channel 3 and on Channel 5 in Ocala. It is also in high definition on Channel 5.1.
“What we want is the viewer who is watching it 
… to be aware of what’s around them and available to them,” said Jeff Goertz, the show’s creator and producer, before the premiere on Jan. 4.
Goertz films and produces the show entirely by 
himself at his home in Ocala. 
Transforming his carport into a production stu-
dio, he installed a complete kitchen, lighting and four HD cameras to shoot the show.
 “You would never think that 3 feet away is (my) 
washing machine,” Goertz said.
Goertz partnered with chef White after he saw 
him perform in an “Iron Chef”-type competition in Ocala and said he thought White was a star because of his personality. 
He describes White as a “country boy” with the 
skills of a fine chef and the focus of a Marine, because White served in the Marine Corps for four years.
Although he hasn’t had much formal training, 
White said he learned how to cook by watching chefs from all around the world. 
He now runs his own catering company, Fresh 
Green Tomato Catering, and stresses the importance of using fresh, organic ingredients.
The first 13 episodes have already been recorded, 
so Goertz said he hopes to take the show away from the studio in a few episodes for the next half, which will air later in the year.
WUFT will air 26 episodes, and Goertz is working 
on making the show available online.WUFT-TV show highlights Ocala chef

DAYTONA BEACH — A 
20-year-old man threatened pa-

Daytona Beach Police De-
partment officers responded to a report of shots being fired at a moving car Sunday at about 3:52 a.m. Shortly thereafter, po-lice received a report of gunfire at nearby Halifax Hospital.
According to investiga-
tors, Jonathan Rodriguez-Jeff of Deltona, Fla., shot a glass door entrance at the hospital’s Professional Building. He then went to the second floor and confronted a nurse and patient inside a room.
“Do you want to die to-
night?” police said the suspect asked.Rodriguez-Jeff left and went 
into a second room, confront-ing another nurse and patient. Shortly thereafter, he commit-ted suicide inside the room, police said.
At some point in the ordeal, 
two nurses were hit with the butt of Rodriguez-Jeff’s shot-gun, investigators said. They suffered minor injuries. No pa-tients were hurt.
The hospital’s emergency 
room and other entrances were placed on lockdown during the shooting. An unknown num-ber of vehicles were struck by the shotgun blast inside the parking lot of the hospital, po-lice said.
“We are thankful no one 
was seriously injured,” John Gutherie, the hospital’s director of corporate communications, said.Man threatens

A UF alumnus has put his 
love for the Beatles in a tangible 
form by helping direct the new iOS app, “John Lennon: The Ber-muda Tapes.”
Forty-year-old Mark Thomp-
son, who has freelanced graphic designs for movies such as “Her-bie: Fully Loaded” and “Every-thing’s Cool,” said the app’s pur-pose is to tell the story of John Lennon’s last two albums. 
The app acts as an interac-
tive storybook. Users can listen to tracks pulled from the albums and interviews with Lennon as he talks about his journey to and from Bermuda.
“He comes to Bermuda, and 
these songs just start pouring out of him,” said Thompson. “When you come out the other side, you feel like you’ve experienced it.”
The app, which is $4.99 in the 
App Store, acts as an interac-tive slideshow, allowing users to sail across turbulent waters and see Bermuda’s points of interest with an artistic ﬂ  air. Users can also record sounds to create ani-mations.
Thompson said Lennon, who 
had stagnated creatively after spending all of his time at home with his family, went to Bermu-da to reignite his songwriting. Lennon was reinvigorated by the island. He immediately began writing songs, and he played his recordings through the phone to Yoko Ono, Thompson said.
Thompson, who graduated 
from UF in 1996, said the app’s inception was as much caused by coincidence as it was planning.
He said the inciting moment 
was when Andrew Banks, an-other UF alumnus who works in entertainment ﬁ  nancing in Bermuda, sought out Michael Epstein to ﬁ  lm a documentary about a Beatles tribute concert happening on the island.Epstein decided that although 
the concert wasn’t right for a ﬁ  lm, a tribute app would be a more viable idea.
Epstein brought Thompson 
onto the project, and he said as soon as he saw Banks walk in with Gator clothes, he knew the project would go “awesomely.”
Thompson said he also signed 
the New York strategic design agency Eyeball for artwork and the Massachusetts creative stu-dio Design I/O for applying the team’s creative direction into a substantive product.
He said the team worked 
closely with Lennon’s widow, Yoko Ono, for creative approval.
All proceeds from the app go 
directly to WhyHunger, a charity supported by Ono that is work-ing toward eliminating world hunger and poverty.
Steven Garcia, a 21-year-old 
UF biology senior and self-pro-claimed fan of the Beatles, said the app brings attention to part of Lennon’s story that might oth-erwise be overlooked.
“It’s a very creative app away 
from the usual things you expe-rience,” Garcia said.

While coral reefs across the 
world are reportedly strug-
gling, off the warm coast of the Cayman Islands, UF re-searchers have witnessed colonies bounce back.
From 1999 to 2004, warm 
ocean temperatures resulted in bleaching and infectious disease, which reduced the living coral at Little Cayman by more than 40 percent. But now, the overall health and size of the coral has returned to its original state.
“What we showed here 
is that there was a warming event and they suffered, but they were able to come back,” said Chuck Jacoby, a courtesy faculty member in UF’s soil and water science department and one of the researchers in-volved in the study.
The warming event re-
searchers witnessed can be attributed to climate change, Jacoby said.
In most reef areas, coral 
are subject to global stresses, like warming, as well as local stresses, including damage from ﬁ  shing, anchoring or pollution, Jacoby said. 
But Tom Frazer, a UF pro-
fessor of aquatic ecology, said the reef in Little Cayman is isolated from those local stresses, giving it a unique opportunity to overcome and thrive in a warmer environ-ment as opposed to bleaching and dying in the presence of both global and local stresses combined.
“Our ﬁ  ndings suggest that 
the island’s relative isola-tion, limited human distur-bance and relatively healthy ﬁ  sh populations underlie the observed resiliency,” Frazer said.
Though coral reefs only 
occupy less than 0.01 percent of the marine environment, according to the study’s press release, reefs house about 25 percent of the different spe-cies of marine organisms, pro-duce about 25 percent of ﬁ  sh caught in developing coun-tries and account for about 30 percent of export earnings in reef-related tourism.
The ﬁ  ndings give an incen-
tive to cities and towns with struggling reefs to focus on limiting local stresses and let-ting the reefs thrive on their own.
“Although addressing 
global issues is important, you can’t give up on the local ones, and you can’t give up on the reefs,” Jacoby said. “Local stresses are much more man-ageable than the global ones, and if you get rid of the local ones, the reefs can cope.”

damage, new UF study shows

It might be too difﬁ  cult to ﬁ  t 161 candles 
on the birthday cake, but UF will still recog-
nize its 161st today.
On Sunday, UF social media specialist  
Bruce Floyd commemorated the event by starting a hashtag, #HappyBirthdayUF.
Floyd said although 161 was an odd anni-
versary to recognize, the university’s birthday offered an opportunity to share a quick tidbit about the university’s history while also get-ting current and past students involved.
“We’re always trying to come up with 
ideas to get people engaged in UF’s history,” he said. 
He said he loves seeing responses such as 
J.B. White’s tweet, “Decades later, graduating from the University of Florida remains one of my proudest moments.” Highlights from re-sponses to the hashtag will be showcased.
“We have all these people tweeting about 
how UF has been important in their lives,” Floyd said “It’s almost as if the university is this living, breathing being.”
As of press time, the hashtag has received 
154 responses.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando said the 
university has no ofﬁ  cial plans to celebrate its birthday, but it’s good that students are being made aware of its anniversary. 
He said the university celebrated its 150th 
anniversary in 2003, but there aren’t any plans currently in place for its upcoming birthdays.Orlando said the university originated 
from an institution in Lake City before mov-ing to Gainesville.
“It’s especially important for new students 
to recognize that the university has such a long history,” Orlando said.
Christina Bonarrigo, UF’s Student Body 
president, said there will be a piece about the university’s birthday on her blog, student-bodyprezuf.blogspot.com.

sity has come,” Bonarrigo said.Happy birthday to U(F): School turns 161, celebrates with tweets14, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, JANUARY 6, 2014

The Southeastern Conference is culti-
vating champions on and off the ﬁ  eld.
Eight academic programs that in no 
way target athletes are now featured on a 
new website, thesecu.com, that the SECU launched during Winter Break.
The SECU is the Southeastern Confer-
ence’s academic initiative, and the pro-grams include study abroad fellowships and faculty research grants.
Torie Johnson, executive director of 
SECU, said this is the ﬁ  rst time a major collegiate conference is directly support-ing academic programs that are unrelated to student athletes.
“Other conferences have something that 
is academically focused,” Johnson said. “The SECU is different, though, in that it is so directly tied to the conference.”
The new website is part of a rebrand-
ing campaign the SECU has undergone for more than two years. 
Formally known as the SEC Academic 
Consortium, the organization was origi-nally independent of the Southeastern Conference. 
Now the SECU is operated and funded 
directly through the athletic conference, giving the organization the opportunity to identify with the SEC and utilize its re-sources.
“If successful, I would imagine this 
might set a precedent for other confer-ences to follow,” said Dan Williams, UF marketing assistant vice president.
Though the SECU funds eight pro-
grams, Johnson said the organization may add more grants, scholarships and fellow-ships in the future.
The new website was unintentionally 
launched in conjunction with the prepared launch of the SEC Network, an upcoming cable college sports network that will ex-pand coverage of conference sports. For-mer Gators quarterback Tim Tebow will work for the network.
Johnson said the consecutive timing of 
the two launches was not planned, but the SEC Network might be another platform for the SECU to broadcast its message.
“For instance you might be watching an 
SEC game and then you may see an SECU ad,” Johnson said.
Steve McClain, UF senior associate ath-
letic director, said the SECU is another long-standing collaborative effort of the SEC to bridge academics and athletics. 
“The Southeastern Conference’s aca-
demic initiative will only strengthen the relationships between the academic and athletic units at the University of Florida,” McClain wrote in an email.
Williams said the SEC has become a 
strong force in athletics and that the for-mation of the SECU may remind people outside the South of each member school’s academic prominence.
“For us, I think it could help overcome 
the image that southern universities are nothing more than ‘football schools,’” Wil-liams wrote in an email, “and at the same time encourage even more productive col-laboration between our conference mem-bers.”MONDAY, JANUARY 6, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

MIAMI — Florida’s mangroves are moving farther up 
the state’s east coast, the latest indicator of global climate 
change.
Florida’s Atlantic coast gained more than 3,000 acres of 
mangroves in the past three decades. That’s according to new research published in the Proceedings of the National Acad-emy of Sciences journal, The Miami Herald reports.
Scientists documented the mangrove growth by looking at 
satellite images from 1984 to 2011. Mangrove coverage dou-bled in the area between Cape Canaveral and St. Augustine.Brown University postdoctoral researcher Kyle Cavanaugh 
said that while there are examples of climate change having a negative impact, this could be different. The mangroves are replacing salt marshes, but both are important and highly productive coastal systems.
“The question we have to answer,” Cavanaugh said, “is 
what do these changes mean to Florida’s ecosystem? I think we’ll ﬁ  nd that they are not cause for alarm.”
The researchers examined several possible explanations 
and concluded a decrease in the number of hard freezes was the likely factor behind the mangroves’ push up the coast. Cold snaps of 25 degrees or less halt the growth of mangrove forests, and with fewer hard freezes, they expanded into new areas, the scientists found.
In Titusville there were an average of 1.2 fewer days per 
year with extreme-cold temperatures between 2006 and 2011 than between 1984 and 1989. Similar ﬁ  ndings were found in other cities.
The scientists are examining mangrove movement in other 
parts of the world as well, including Florida’s Gulf Coast.
“There are mangrove forests all over the globe that are 
pushing up on the limits of salt marshes,” Cavanaugh told The Miami Herald. “It’s a complex situation that we’ll con-tinue to be looking very closely at.” Fewer freezes help Florida’s mangroves expand up east coast SEC universities are showcased on thesecu.com16, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, JANUARY 6, 2014

Gainesville Police arrested a 
local man Saturday night after 
officers said he hid cocaine in his boxers and marijuana in his pants.
Police arrested Ramon Castillo 
King, 22, on charges of marijuana possession and cocaine posses-sion with intent to sell, according to an arrest report. 
At about 11:15 p.m., King was 
riding in a car stopped for a bro-ken tag light.
An officer saw King stuff something into 
the front of his pants, and ac-cording to the report, the of-ficer also noted the car smelled of marijuana.
Officers  
searched King 
and found a cigarette box con-taining one gram of cocaine in his boxers. 
The officer then asked King 
where the marijuana was, to which he replied, in his “nuts.” King then reached into the front of his pants and pulled out four grams of marijuana, according to the report.
During questioning, King ad-
mitted to selling crack cocaine.
King has an extensive crimi-

nobody even knew it,” Suzy Johnson, who is helping take care of the dog, told the newspaper.
The fisherman took the dog to Demens Landing 
marina, where resident Tony Basile wrapped the dog in a towel.“She shook all night,” Basile said.The pooch was wearing a red collar with the name 
“Baby” written in rhinestones. A trip to Banfield Pet Hospital revealed she had a microchip.
Workers there scanned the chip and discovered 
she had been reported missing two years ago. But the phone number associated with her name doesn’t work.
A Banfield spokesperson told the newspaper the 
dog’s family might have reported her missing and then found her and never updated the information.
The dog is brown, about 18 inches tall and 20-30 
pounds. Her caretakers aren’t sure what breed she is, but they said she appears well-groomed and cared for. Veterinarian workers are continuing to try to find the dog’s owner, and all are hoping for a happy re-union after the dog’s lucky rescue.Dog rescued from Tampa Bay watersMONDAY, JANUARY 6, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 17

Recruit switches to Florida
Three-star offensive line recruit Kavaris Harkless reportedly committed 
to Florida on Sunday. The lineman was previously committed to Louisville but switched after UL coach Charlie Strong left to coach at Texas.Guard Scottie Wilbekin improved his shooting after a 1-of-9 start against Richmond. Read the story on page 27. Gators in the NBA
Former Gators forward David Lee scored 21 points and recorded 11 rebounds in Golden State’s 112-96 road win at Washington on Sunday.� SEVEN PLAYERS TO TRANSFER.

Florida lost several players to transfer and 
the NFL Draft following its season-ending 
loss to Florida State on Nov. 30.
Seven players announced they would 
transfer to other universities, and three oth-ers declared for the professional draft.
The biggest loss for Florida is its pair of 
cornerbacks, Loucheiz Purifoy and Marcus Roberson. Both juniors announced following the season that they would enter the draft.
Their departures leave the Gators inex-
perienced at cornerback; freshman Vernon Hargreaves III saw the most time among UF’s remaining corners.
Roberson did not notch an interception 
last season, and Purifoy made two. ESPN ranks Roberson and Purifoy as the No. 26 and No. 28 draft prospects, respectively. 
Multiple players also announced they 
would leave the program to join others.
On Dec. 12, the school announced that six 
players were transferring: redshirt junior of-fensive lineman Ian Silberman; sophomore tight end Kent Taylor, redshirt freshmen defensive back/fullback Rhaheim Ledbetter and offensive lineman Quinteze Williams; and freshmen quarterback Max Staver and offensive lineman Trevon Young.
Silberman saw the most playing time of 
the group, starting four games in 2013.
Three days after those players’ decisions 
were announced, quarterback Tyler Murphy announced he would transfer as well.
The redshirt junior entered the 2013 
season as the backup quarterback but was pressed into action after starter Jeff Driskel suffered a season-ending fractured ﬁ  bula on Sept. 21.
Murphy started six games before missing 
the ﬁ  nal three due to a shoulder sprain he suffered against LSU on Oct. 12. 
His transfer left only two scholarship 
quarterbacks on the roster: Driskel and red-shirt freshman Skyler Mornhinweg, who started the season’s ﬁ  nal three games.
However, it was not all bad news for the 
Gators.
UF brought in two players in the middle of December.
Junior college offensive lineman Drew 
Sarvary signed with Florida on Dec. 18. The 6-foot-5, 318-pound offensive lineman previ-ously played at Tyler (Texas) Junior College, where he was named a First Team All-South-west Junior College Football Conference se-lection.The Gators also added former Virginia 
Tech kicker Brooks Abbott, who announced via his Twitter that he would enroll at Flori-da in the summer.
Abbott plans to walk on to the team. He 
did not attempt a ﬁ  eld goal as a Hokie, but he looks to improve a Florida kicking squad that missed 10 of 22 attempts.

Tyler Murphy heads to the ﬁ  eld before playing LSU at Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge, 
La., on Oct. 12, 2013. Murphy announced he was transferring from Florida on Dec. 15. 2013, after starting six games for the Gators during a 4-8 season.
Players leave UF after disappointing season
Gainesville, it’s cold outside.
While you were relaxing at 
home during winter break, a blast of polar air traveled south from the Arctic, bringing sub-zero temperatures to the North and Midwest and pushing ther-mometers south of freezing at UF.
What else has the winter 
wind swept into town? Spring sports, of course (Cue cheesy cheer)!
Fall sports left Gators fans 
cold and upset. Football was abjectly terrible, but with spring comes new life. Some freshmen recruits will be enrolling today, and they will get their chance to prove themselves during spring practices — capped by the Or-ange and Blue game in April. 
Meanwhile, Will Muschamp

For the ﬁ  rst time in Amanda Butler’s ten-
ure as Florida’s coach, the Gators tamed the 
No. 6 Wildcats in Kentucky, defeating them 83-73 on Sunday on the back of a 30-11 run in the game’s ﬁ  nal 12 minutes.
The victory marked the ﬁ  rst time Florida 
beat Kentucky in nearly eight years. The last time the Gators won in Lexington, Ky., was in 2006 under former coach Carolyn Peck. 
The win over the Wildcats was also the 
Gators’ ﬁ  rst victory away from home against a ranked opponent since Florida beat Ohio State in the ﬁ  rst round of the 2012 NCAA Tournament.
“The work that these kids put in … they 
got what they deserved,” Butler said. “They earned this win in the two days of practice leading up to this, and they brought it to the court. I absolutely loved their composure. We were undaunted when we got down. They just kept ﬁ  ghting and grinding and making plays, and just like in every other great win we’ve had this year, 
it wasn’t one person. It was everybody stepping up, everybody doing their 
job to the fullest and taking turns making plays.”Early in the game, senior Jaterra Bonds 
pushed Florida to a 21-10 lead in the ﬁ  rst eight minutes, scoring 10 of her 23 points in that span.
Kentucky had narrowed its deﬁ  cit to a 
single point, trailing Florida 45-44 at half-time.  
At the beginning of the second half, UF 
seemed to be losing its grip on the game.

Florida on eight-game win streak after second SEC victory
Kentucky had catapulted itself to 
a nine-point lead thanks to an 18-8 run in the ﬁ  rst eight minutes.
But when freshman Ronni Wil-
liams is on the ﬂ  oor, no lead can be considered safe. 
With Kentucky leading 63-55, 
Williams produced a sequence of plays that shifted momentum in Florida’s favor for the duration of the game. 
With 10:58 remaining on the 
clock, Williams made a layup to get the Gators within six points. On the ensuing possession, she nabbed the defensive rebound but turned the ball over. When Kentucky drove to the basket, Williams blocked the shot and grabbed the rebound, driving end-to-end to make anoth-er layup and bringing Florida back to within four points. 
Williams ﬁ  nished the afternoon 
with 19 points and 10 rebounds. 
“Keeping Ronni on the ﬂ  oor has 
been something we’ve been really concerned with,” Butler said. “It was a great performance against one of the best teams in the coun-try, but it’s not surprising to see Ronni play like that. 
“She got what she deserved. She 
kept herself on the ﬂ  oor, made good decisions, didn’t hang her head when she made mistakes, which are inevitable against a great team like them on their home ﬂ  oor.”
After Williams’ furious ﬂ  urry, 
Kentucky made only a single ﬁ  eld goal in the ﬁ  nal 10 minutes of the game.
“We did a much better job of 
rebounding the basketball,” Butler said. “That had haunted us up until that point. We were playing pretty good defense, I felt like, but we were giving them second opportu-nities and not doing a good job of being diligent with out box-outs. 
“We just dug our heels in, would 
not allow fatigue to be a factor, and decided to play our best basketball in the most important time of the game.”
The red-hot Gators (12-3, 2-0 
Southeastern Conference) have now won eight consecutive games.This was surely a statement victory for Butler and her team, but there’s still a lot of basketball to be played this year.
“It’s very rewarding, no ques-
tion,” she said. 
“At the same time, we can’t get 
too far ahead of ourselves. This is just another step in the SEC sea-son — one we can build conﬁ  dence on.”

only a month away!
Men’s and women’s basket-
ball continue their treks toward 
different goals. 
The men’s side looks to break 
the Elite Eight barrier that has stopped them for the past three seasons; the women’s team looks to make it back to the dance after a bid in the WNIT title game last year.
Baseball and softball both 
open their seasons in about a month, but the two bat-and-ball sports are coming off wildly dif-ferent campaigns.
The Gators baseball team 
struggled mightily after making three consecutive trips to the Col-lege World Series. UF scraped its way into the NCAA Tournament but did not win a game.
Kevin O’Sullivan and the 
Gators, armed with a top-ranked recruiting class, are eyeing a re-turn to Omaha. They have the talent to make this year exciting, even if they don’t make a title run.
Meanwhile, across campus at 
Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium, the softball team is looking to return to Oklahoma City after a heartbreaking loss to Texas in the Women’s College World Series last season. 
That loss came only about 12 
hours after Florida pulled out a 15-inning win against Nebraska in thrilling fashion. If that didn’t glue you to your TV, then maybe you should take a long, hard look in the mirror. 
UF was not expected to com-
pete for even a conference title last year, but instead, it swept the regular season and tournament titles and was one of the final six teams left in the WCWS.
Back on the more-traveled side 
of campus, the gymnastics squad looks to defend its first national title, and the women’s tennis team will look return to the promised land after being eliminated in last year’s NCAA semifinals.
Other teams are in more ques-
tionable shape. The lacrosse team, so dominant the past few seasons, lost its inaugural class that led them to within a goal of the national title game in 2012. 
Almost as disappointing is the 
track and field squad, which won ONLY a share of the men’s out-door title. 
Come on, track team. Step it 
up. One title is not enough. 
So while it may be chilly out-
side, the spring season is just about to heat up. Spend it with your favorite sweater and favor-ite student-run sports section.Stein , from page 21Two UF

Saturday’s swim meet came down 
to the final two races in the O’Connell 
Center, as the Florida women’s swim-ming and diving team looked to avenge last year’s loss to rival Florida State. 
However, the Gators men did not 
have as much trouble.
D e s p i t e 
FSU taking comfortable leads early 
in the meet, both UF squads rallied to victories.
The diving team started off the 
meet on Thursday, but the women’s sophomore standout, Kahlia Warner, did not compete due to illness.
The Seminoles dominated diving. 
The men’s team took the first three spots on the 1-meter board and grabbed first and third place on the 3-meter, lead-ing to a 28-10 springboard beatdown against Florida. FSU’s women did the men one better, taking first and second on the 1-and 3-meter boards, lending a 29-10 advantage over UF to start the meet.
The Seminoles tallied 23 of the pos-
sible 36 points in the last two races, but they came up six points short as UF rode strong performances from soph-omore Hilda Luthersdottir and senior Elizabeth Beisel to a 153-147 victory.
“It was definitely good to come 
back this year and win, especially be-cause it is my senior year and the last time that I will have a chance to go against FSU,” Beisel said.
Florida’s men won 12 of the 16 
events en route to their 180-118 win. The victory extends their consecutive dual-meet win streak to 20.
“We’ve got some work to do,” 
coach Gregg Troy said.

Editor’s Note: A version of this story origi-
nally ran online on Dec. 26, 2013.
Florida announced Duke offensive coordi-
nator Kurt Roper as its new offensive coordi-
nator and quarterbacks coach on Dec. 26 after firing Brent Pease on Dec. 1.
“This was the right situation for me and 
my family at the right time,” Roper said on a media teleconference. “It’s obviously a great university that has a great tradition, and I look forward to trying to add to that.”
Roper will make $600,000 per year, accord-
ing to the Gainesville Sun.
“I’m excited to have Coach Roper join our 
staff,” coach Will Muschamp said in a press release. “He has a diverse, up-tempo back-ground on offense and does a good job of adapting to what the players do best.”
Under Roper, Duke — a perennial cellar-
dweller — finished 10-4 and clinched its sec-ond straight bowl berth for the first time in school history before falling to Texas A&M in the Chick-fil-A Bowl on Dec. 31. The Blue Devils finished the season ranked 69th  in total 
offense.
The Gators hope Roper can at least get them back to that standard. Florida finished 2013 with a 4-8 record — its worst season since 1979. UF also missed out on a bowl bid for the first time since 1990. Under Pease, Florida’s of-fense finished 115th in the nation.
Roper previously coached in the South-
eastern Conference as the Tennessee running backs coach from 2006 to 2007.
The Gators, who previously ran a run-
based, pro-style offense, plan to switch to a spread offense under Roper. Roper said he was not familiar with Florida’s offense, which averaged a meager 18.8 points per game in 2013, but he looks to evaluate the personnel he will have available to him.
“I think the biggest thing is you got to find 
out the strengths of your quarterback and the strengths of your offensive line,” Roper said. “Once you find those strengths, then you can start putting together what you’re going to start hanging your hat on offensively.”UF hires offensive coordinator

Florida fans got a glimpse at 
their quarterback of the future on 
Saturday.
Will Grier, a 2014 four-star 
signal caller out of Davidson, N.C., and Gators commit, played six drives at the U.S. Army All-American Bowl in San Antonio.
His East 
squad lost 28-6 to the West team, 
but he showcased his abilities in limited playing time, recording a team-best 109 yards on 4-of-8 passing. Fifty-one of those yards came on the longest passing play of the afternoon.
Grier’s ﬁ  rst quarter was not 
as successful as he would have liked. His ﬁ  rst drive went three and out. 
On the ﬁ  rst play of his second 
drive, he rushed for 10 yards out of bounds for a ﬁ  rst down. But after his scramble, he could not pick up another ﬁ  rst down dur-ing that drive.
The 6-foot-2, 187-pound Grier, 
who plans to enroll at UF this se-mester, returned to the game in the third quarter and found his groove. 
On a deep out route, Grier 
completed an 18-yard pass to Ohio State-bound receiver John-nie Dixon to the West 3-yard line.
Three plays later, the East 
scored its ﬁ  rst points of the game on a 1-yard touchdown run from Georgia tailback commit Sony Michel.
During the ﬁ  rst play of his next 
offensive drive, Grier showed off his arm. 
The dual-threat quarterback 
rolled out to his right, dodged a West pass rusher and connected with Clemson receiver commit Demarre Kitt down the right sideline for 51 yards to the West 21-yard line.
But after his best play of the 
day, Grier failed to continue his rhythm on the drive as he alter-nated snaps with Georgia com-mit Jacob Park. On second and fourth down, Grier missed two pass attempts. 
In addition to Grier, three 
other Gators — cornerback Chris Lammons, defensive tackle Khairi Clark and offensive tack-le David Sharpe — participated in this year’s Army Bowl on the East team.
Lammons — who also played 
quarterback at Plantation High this past season — notched two solo tackles and a pass breakup. As a punt returner, the four-
star athlete returned two for 14 yards. 
Clark, a Hollywood native out 
of Chaminade-Madonna High, also recorded two tackles. 
Florida has the No. 10 class in 
the nation, according to Rivals.com, with National Signing Day a month away.

Following a stagnant showing offensively 
from his team in the first half against Rich-
mond, Billy Donovan approached a struggling Scottie Wilbekin in the locker room.
The 18th-year 
Florida coach had a message at half-time for Wilbekin, 
who had only two points on 1-of-9 shooting and was not creating good opportunities for his teammates. The Gators led the Spiders by only two points at halftime after recording only four assists against six turnovers.
According to center Patric Young, Dono-
van challenged his senior floor leader to “start playing like a real point guard.”
He got the message.Wilbekin took five fewer shots in the sec-
ond half, shooting 3 of 4 for eight points. For the contest, he finished with 10 points on 4-of-13 shooting, two assists and one turnover to help No. 12 Florida finish the game on an 18-8 run and escape Richmond 67-58 in its last non-conference game of the regular season.
“He bounced back great,” guard Michael 
Frazier II said of Wilbekin. “With him being a leader on this team, he has to lead by example. We saw him struggling, and he picked himself up and got us going in the second half.”
After missing his first three three-point 
attempts in catch-and-shoot situations, Wil-bekin went 1 of 4 on layup attempts in the first half. He rushed shots and looked upset with Florida’s lack of ball movement.
“Yeah, he was frustrated in the first half,” 
Young said. “It’s not all on him, but … we weren’t playing our offense. The ball was stagnant. We weren’t moving it around, hav-ing our motion offense. But it was forcing him — because he was the point guard, he had the ball in his hands — to take a lot of shots that he doesn’t normally take, and to go one-on-one, which isn’t our style at all.”
But Wilbekin’s shot selection improved in 
the second half. His most important shot, a floater down the left baseline over a Richmond defender that cut Florida’s deficit to 48-47 with 5:54 remaining, helped spark UF’s big run.
He also made a key steal and hit two free 
throws late in the game to help Florida close it out.
Wilbekin’s struggles early Saturday fol-
lowed a trend in the senior’s recent play. After averaging 5.8 assists in his first four contests this year, he has posted only 2.3 per game in his last four. 
His assists average has dropped by one per 
game since last season, and he has averaged four more field-goal attempts (11.3) than 2012-13. Wilbekin’s field-goal percentage of 38.9 percent has dropped by 6.4 since last year. In his past three games, Wilbekin has gone 11 of 35 from the field. 
But what concerned Donovan most after 
Saturday’s game, the last before Southeastern Conference play begins Wednesday, was his team’s poor ball movement in the first half.
“We don’t see well enough now. We would 
be great on a horse track because we play like this sometimes,” Donovan said, motioning his hands by his eyes to imitate blinders.
“We’ve got these blinders on and they can’t 
see left or right. They can only see directly in front of them ... They drive the ball and there’s guys standing wide open … and they don’t see them.”MONDAY, JANUARY 6, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 27

ST. PETERSBURG — The 2014 Under Armour All-Amer-
ica Game on Thursday afternoon put the most highly touted 
recruits from across the country together on one field. 
Florida, a consistent recruiting powerhouse, had three 
commits on Team Nitro and one on Team Highlight. Corner-back commits J.C. Jackson and Quincy Wilson, as well as wide receiver commit Ermon Lane, led Team Nitro. Defensive end Gerald Willis III, playing for Team Highlight, announced his commitment to Florida during Thursday’s game. 
Willis announced his commitment to Florida at halftime.  
A New Orleans native, Willis picked between Florida and LSU. 
Willis should help a Florida defensive line that lost vet-
eran linemen Dominique Easley and Damien Jacobs. He has a chance to make an impact early, as the 2014 defensive line corps will have just four upperclassmen. Jamaal Adams, a safety out of Lewisville, Texas, also an-
nounced his decision during the game. Like Willis, Adams narrowed his choices to LSU and UF. However, Adams went in another direction, choosing to play for the Tigers.
Adams, a physical defensive back who 
consistently attacked the ball during prac-tice, made the decision despite having a connection to the Gators — UF wide receiv-ers coach Joker Phillips is his godfather. 
“I just felt more comfortable there, talk-
ing to all [of] the coaching staff,” Adams said. “The opportunity there at LSU is there for me. I’m ready to go win some national championships.”
Adams has the talent to get reps as a true freshman next 
season. The Tigers’ secondary had three true freshman get meaningful playing time during the 2013 season. LSU al-lowed 198 yards in the air per game in 2013, ranking 13th in the nation.
Lane stood out on Thursday, catching what appeared to 
be a touchdown reception in the second quarter, but it was ruled incomplete. Lane also had a kickoff return for 24 yards in the third quarter and finished Thursday with four catches for 34 yards. 
Minnesota running back commit Jeff Jones won MVP for 
Team Nitro after recording 72 total yards and a receiving touchdown. 
The Gators coaching staff has shown interest in Jones and 
reportedly offered him a scholarship after former commit Dalvin Cook flipped from Florida to Florida State on Tues-day. 
Jones is set to make an official visit to Gainesville on Jan. 
24, just 12 days before National Signing Day.  
Florida head coach Will Muschamp will have to sway 
him away from his home state, as Jones is from Minneapolis. Jones committed to the Gophers in February 2013.UF lands Willis, misses Adams at Under Armour All-America Game
