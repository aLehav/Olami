There’s no defense for this one.
Georgia Southern, a Football 
Championship Subdivision team  
that was missing 19 scholarship 
players due to injury and had lost to the likes of Wofford, Samford, Appalachian State and Furman, dominated Florida on its own turf without completing a pass.
Georgia Southern (7-4, 4-4 
Southern Conference) gained 429 rushing yards using the triple op-
tion to pull off a historic 26-20 up-
set on Saturday in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium that snapped a 22-year bowl appearance streak for Florida (4-7, 3-5 Southeastern Conference) and marked the ﬁ  rst defeat against a current FCS team since 1946.
“Very disappointed for our 
program,” coach Will Muschamp 
said. “An embarrassment in this 
situation.”
Florida managed just 279 yards 
of offense and allowed the fourth most rushing yards in school histo-ry. Eight Georgia Southern players had a rush attempt of 10 or more 
yards. 
Georgia Southern earned a 
reported $550,000 just to share 
the same ﬁ  eld with Florida. The numbers did not add up. Florida entered the game as 27.5-point fa-vorites. Its football expenses of $67 million are more than seven times 
Georgia Southern’s entire athletic budget. This never should have been close.
“They came out here and played 
their tails off. This was their ball-
game,” right guard Jon Halapio said. “They had nothing to lose. We took them lightly.”
At the start, it looked as if Flori-
da could ride its talent to a victory. Redshirt freshman Skyler Morn-
hinweg, starting his second game 
in place of injured quarterback Ty-ler Murphy, led a 13-play, 63-yard opening drive that ended in a 27-yard ﬁ  eld goal by Francisco Velez. Freshman Kelvin Taylor had eight carries on the drive for 54 yards.
Georgia Southern punter Luke 
Cherry fumbled the snap on a punt 
to end the subsequent series. On 
the next Eagles possession, safety Jabari Gorman stripped the ball from GSU running back Johnathan Bryant. Linebacker Michael Taylor recovered the ball at the Georgia Southern 14-yard line. 
Mornhinweg, scrambling right, 
found Solomon Patton in the end-
zone from 3 yards out for the ﬁ  rst 
touchdown of his career. Despite a blocked ﬁ  eld goal, Florida held a commanding 10-point lead with 13:31 left in the second quarter.
“We did not play a perfect game. 
We put ourselves in bad situations, but nobody panicked,” Georgia Southern coach Jeff Monken said. 
“There was never any doubt in 
their minds.”
The doubt escalated for Florida once it became clear that it would not generate a passing offense, and Georgia Southern buckled down against the run. Taylor gained 11 yards during 
the remainder of the ﬁ  rst half fol-lowing his 54-yard opening drive. Georgia Southern, led by senior Jerick McKinnon, gashed Florida in the run game.

One bouncer’s shift turned into a chase across 
UF’s campus this weekend after police reported an 
Ocala man stole more than $1,000 in cover charges.
Gainesville Police arrested 21-year-old Robert 
Price Brannan on charges of grand theft, according 
to an arrest report.
Salty Dog Saloon bouncer Brandon Wright said 
he was putting a wristband on a bargoer at about 
1:15 a.m. Saturday when Brannan walked up and swiped a bag with $1,205 inside. He had been es-corted from the bar earlier after drinking too much. 
Brannan ran across West University Avenue, and 
Wright followed him. While Brannan was crossing the road, a taxi hit him, and he rolled a few times over the car, Wright said. However, he got up and continued running.
Wright said he chased Brannan through the Mur-
phree courtyard, where he took all the money out of 
his pockets and surrendered it to Wright. 
Brannan then started running toward Keene-
Flint Hall near Library West, where he hid in bush-
es. Ofﬁ  cers arrested him there, Wright said. 
Police booked Brannan into the Alachua County 
Jail Saturday. He was released on his own recogni-zance. He declined to comment about the incident.
The chase became the talk of the night among 
Wright’s co-workers.
“I’ve had to clean up throw-up and escort some 
people out, but nothing like this,” he said.  Man swipes Salty Dog cover money

The UF Students for a Demo-
cratic Society’s battle for tuition 
equity for undocumented students continued Friday when the group pushed for space at the upcoming 
Board of Trustees meeting.
Nine members gathered out-
side Tigert Hall to hand over about 
6,200 signatures from an online petition on Change.org, 200 hand-written letters, endorsements from almost every major student organi-zation and 13 news articles to Jamal Sowell, the liaison to the Board of 
Trustees. 
“This campaign is about tu-
ition equity, but it’s also about free 
speech and democracy,” Conor Munro, a lead organizer for SDS, told the crowd.
Munro handed over a thick 
folder to Sowell, who then said a few words.
“As an administration, we never 
want to stop free speech,” Sowell said. “We want to pass what they’re saying along.”
The night before, students from 
the group appeared at the Fac-ulty Senate meeting, where faculty voted 40-27, falling short of a two-thirds majority, to move the item 
to be discussed at the upcoming 
Board of Trustees meeting.
Now, that group is fighting for 
speaking time at the meeting on Dec. 6.
“The biggest emphasis to note is 
that this can be effective at a univer-sity level,” said Michela Martinazzi, a 21-year-old UF art history senior 
and a lead organizer for SDS.
Undocumented students cur-
rently do not qualify for in-state 
tuition and therefore must pay out-of-state tuition, which costs about four times as much.
At Nov. 13’s Student Senate 
meeting, representatives from His-panic Student Association, Black 
Student Union and Asian Ameri-
can Student Union, among 15 other organizations, also spoke during public debate in support of a reso-lution. 
The Senate approved the resolu-
tion with a majority vote. Florida International University has also passed a similar measure.
Munro, a 22-year-old UF history 
and economics senior, said he feels confident the initiative will appear as an item on the board’s agenda.
“I feel like the ball is in their 
court,” he said. “We’ve done every-thing we can.”SDS rallies

Baby Gator nursery and Gradu-
ate Assistants United are teaming up to provide reduced child care today and Tuesday for UF graduate assistants.
Alachua County schools are closed this week, leaving gradu-ate assistants to find babysitters or child care.  But for the first time, Baby Gator and Graduate Assistants United are providing an affordable option, said Emily McCann, the co-president of Graduate Assistants United at UF.
Baby Gator will accommodate 25 children, aged kindergarten to sixth grade.  
 The cost is $35 a day per child, 
but Graduate Assistants United is covering $20 of that cost per child, McCann said.
“We are happy and delighted to 
collaborate with Baby Gator,” Mc-Caan said.
Kelly Jamison, the assistant di-
rector of the Lake Alice Baby Gator, said the nursery thought it would be 
a nice opportunity to serve more UF 
families.
“We thought it would be a nice 
trial run and hopefully do it again in the future as well,” Jamison said.
Melody Schiaffino, the president 
of Ph.D. Moms at UF, said graduate assistants have a 50 percent rate of not completing their graduate assis-tant term due to the cost of caring for children while in school.  
“To have this Thanksgiving week 
and hopefully in the future for other days off would be amazing and would not interrupt our progress and our duty,” Schiaffino said.

� OF THE COLLEGE 
GRADUATES SAMPLED, 36 PERCENT WISHED THEY CHANGED THEIR MAJOR. 
ELIZABETH BROWN 
Alligator Contributing Writer
    
Although college students 
might view their major as a 
seal of fate, a new survey 
says that might not be the case.
A recently released Ca-
reerBuilder.com study found one-third of college-educat-ed employees do not work in careers related to their majors. 
The survey, conducted in 
August and September, also found that 47 percent of the 2,134 college graduates sam-
pled took first jobs unrelated 
to what they studied in col-lege.     
In addition, 36 percent of 
participants said they wish 
they could have changed 
their major.
Kristina DePue, a UF as-
sistant counselor education 
professor, said she thinks 
this is because of the poor state of the job market.
She said graduates with 
degrees in science, engi-
neering and technology are 
mainly the ones landing jobs in their fields because of the specified training, but other 
areas might not be the same 
case.
With this competition in 
the job market, DePue said  she thinks more people are 
coming back to school.
She said because of major 
overlaps, like education sim-
ilarities between sociology 
and psychology or educa-
tion and social sciences, the actual major doesn’t matter as much.But according to the study, 
32 percent of the participants said they never found a job 
related to their major.
Even though jobs are 
scarce, DePue said, just hav-
ing an undergraduate degree is still attractive to employ-
ers, and strengthening a skill 
set is crucial.
“It’s lots of challenges, 
time demands and dead-
lines,” she said.
For students looking for 
jobs right after graduation, 
DePue said location plays a big role in landing a job — 
small cities like Gainesville 
won’t offer the same amount of opportunities like bigger cities.
Gaby Alvarez, a 21-year-
old UF philosophy senior, said she thinks the logical reasoning and thinking skills 
she’s learning will be help-
ful when she attends law school.
She said her main concern 
is getting a well-rounded education, not necessarily 
working in a certain field.
The survey also found that 
64 percent of employees are 
satisfied with their degrees.
As a professor, DePue 
said undergraduate students should invest time in prac-tical classes and additional training.
Because students are not 
familiar with the job world, she said, they should speak with their professors, be pro-
active and work toward get-
ting internships.
“You open a door for 
yourself,” she said. “It’s real-ly all about who you know.” Degree might not 
play major role in 
career, study saysIt is $35 a day per child

A new musical will be rocking the stage of the Phil-
lips Center for the Performing Arts come Jan. 10.
“Rock of Ages” will be the seventh musical planned 
for the 2013-2014 season, said Todd Taylor, a public rela-
tions associate for UF Performing Arts. .
The musical, nominated for five Tony Awards, is 
about a small-town girl and a city boy falling in love in Los Angeles’ most famous rock club to the best hits of the ‘80s, according to a news release.
Tickets for the general public will go on sale at noon for $45 to $65, and student tickets will be sold at noon Dec. 2 for $20, Taylor said.
Elizabeth Auer, assistant director 
for UFPA, said the touring Broadway crew will arrive in Gainesville on Jan. 2 and rehearse for a week before its 
kickoff performance.
Erika Ackerman, a 21-year old UF 
public relations senior, saw “Rock of 
Ages” in New York City.
“I thought it was very good. It appealed to the young 
crowd,” Ackerman said. “It was a little raunchy.”‘Rock of Ages’ coming to UF in January
UF to measure how many leave early
part of the already four-day week-end to ease traveling for students. With some 50,000 students enrolled, having the entire Student Body jam into highways and airports on the 
Wednesday before Thanksgiving 
would create a travel nightmare. 
“The concern now is that stu-
dents are not showing up for classes earlier,” Mair said. 
The issues arose when students 
took off extra days, skipping classes the Monday or Friday before.
Professors like Linda Perry, a 
lecturer in UF’s colleges of journal-
ism and agriculture, feel the issue of student attendance shouldn’t mean 
taking away the extra day.
She said many students live 
four to six hours away, and having everyone drive home Wednesday night poses a serious risk.
“I have to side with the students 
on this one. They need that Wednes-day,” Perry said.
Mair is urging students to avoid 
taking off an excess amount of days so their extra day won’t be killed in the Faculty Senate vote.
“I’m relying on students to come 
to class Monday and Tuesday,” he said. “I think it’s a good thing, but if 
it’s abused, they will lose this privi-
lege.” 
He said because many classes don’t take attendance, different data will be collected to gauge student presence. RTS ridership, transac-tions and water flow on campus will all be measured to determine how many students left early.
David Easley, a 19-year-old UF 
family, youth and community sci-ence sophomore, is braving the five-hour drive to Miami on Tuesday night. He said his trip last year was delayed two hours with traffic, mak-ing him hesitant to start the journey again.
“It is nuts just on Tuesday,” he 
said. “I really couldn’t imagine only 
being able to drive on Wednesday 
instead of spreading out the traffic over two days.”

Someone must have missed 
patience day in prekindergarten. An unidentified man made his way through the drive-thru line 
at Kentucky Fried Chicken. The 
man approached a 30-year-old Gainesville man in his car, who was just waiting on his biscuits, and started verbally abusing him and even punching him through the open car window. Although the food was not implicated as the reason the man lost his tem-
per, the matter was under inves-
tigation.Nov. 25, 1998A man switched up his morn-
ing routine in an unconventional way — by breaking into another man’s house to finish it. The then

meal before trying to sneak out.

� RESEARCHERS ARE 
COLLECTING DATA ON FISH.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
PENSACOLA — The Ocean 
Conservancy says a $3 million, 
five-year project to expand data collection on red snapper and 
other reef fish stocks in the Gulf 
of Mexico could be a key mile-stone in recovery from the 2010 BP oil spill.
The Pensacola News Journal 
reports that the project is one of six in Florida paid for by $15.7 million of criminal spill fine mon-ey from BP and Transocean, and 
it’s the first of the projects that 
targets marine fisheries. The red snapper fishery is of particular importance to the Gulf region.
“This is a good investment of 
BP fine money in the sustainabil-ity of the fisheries,” said Elizabeth Fetherston, a marine restoration strategist for Ocean Conservancy, based in St. Petersburg.
The Florida Fish and Wild-
life Conservation Commission is managing the project. Gil McRae, director of the agency’s research 
institute, said the project will fill 
critical gaps in data collection re-garding catches of red snapper and other fish.Researchers will go out on 
volunteer commercial and rec-reational fishing boats, McRae said. They will more accurately document the type of fish caught, which ones are released and how many of the released fish sur-vive.
Another aspect of the project 
will be development of smart-
phone apps that would allow an-
glers to record their catches in a central computer.
“What we hope is the infor-
mation will improve the predict-ability of the season and prevent wide swings in regulations of size limits and bag limits,” McRae said. “The project is all about get-
ting better data to better manage 
offshore fisheries, especially red snapper.”BP spill money funds snapper projectISHA CHOSKI

Google and Microsoft are partnering to tackle 
the global problem of online child pornography, 
and some UF students are happy with the com-
panies’ efforts.
Internet users can now receive pop-up warn-
ings if they Google search terms that could be as-
sociated with child pornography. 
Microsoft, which claims a zero-tolerance ap-
proach to the issue, will incorporate a buzzword tagging feature on Yahoo and Bing. The company will also use Microsoft PhotoDNA to find illegal pictures and remove them, according to a Micro-
soft press release.
Arren De La Torre, the founding president of 
Gators Against Human Trafficking, said she is glad to see the efforts Microsoft and Google are 
taking and thinks they will help prevent crime.
“I believe the combination of this preventative 
measure of Google and Microsoft’s, along with increasing efforts to advocate and combat against human trafficking, can end (it) within 30 years,” De La Torre, a 20-year-old UF advertising junior, 
wrote in an email. “I hope that my kids will be 
able to finally say that slavery is defeated.”
Peter Barron, a Google spokesman, said in a 
statement that while the company already re-moves offensive material, there was more to be 
done.
“We are fine tuning our search engine to pre-
vent this material appearing in our results,” he 
wrote in an email. “We hope this will make (a) dif-
ference in the fight against this terrible crime.”
Awurama Acquah, a 19-year-old UF adver-
tising sophomore, said the measure is raising 
awareness for an uncomfortable subject.
“Human trafficking is something people don’t 
want to talk about,” she said. “But more needs to be done about it.”Search engines warn about porn

Zhou Duan Zhu, 44, and Eric Carl 
Title Jr., 21, were also arrested on charges of soliciting a prostitute. Zhu agreed to pay a female officer $40 for sex, and Title offered two officers $40 for oral sex. 
Jeremiah Williams, 27, was arrested 
after he agreed to pay a female officer $30 for intercourse and oral sex. 
Both Harris and Stephens were ar-
rested in southeast Gainesville when 
they agreed to give the officers “head,” 
according to arrest reports.

and Zhu in the 1900 block of South-west 13th Street near the Days Inn Motel, according to arrest reports. The men propositioned the female officers and were then taken behind the motel, where they were arrested.
The prostitution sting was orga-
nized after officers received com-plaints from residents in the area, GPD spokesman Officer Ben Tobias wrote in an email.   
Officers booked Harris and Ste-
phens into jail Saturday. They booked in Zhu, Title and Williams later that evening. All defendants were released 
except Stephens, who remained in jail 
with a $10,000 bond.Five people arrested in

In defense of selﬁ  es
Last week, language lovers lamented the Oxford Dic-
tionaries’ word of the year pick for 2013 — “selﬁ  e.” 
First of all, as The New Yorker pointed out, the Ox-
ford Dictionary Online is not the same as the Oxford English Dictionary. The Oxford Dictionary Online is a frequently up-dated “liberal and inclusive descriptivist dictionary,” and its purpose is to document language as it’s being used today, in 
the way “groovy” and “far out” were used in the 1970s and 
“as if” and “hella dope” were popular 1990s slang terms. 
Its entry in the Oxford Dictionary Online as an informal 
noun is “a photograph that one has taken of oneself, typically one taken with a smartphone or webcam and uploaded to a 
social media website.”
Unfortunately, selﬁ  es have a frivolous implication. Obvi-
ously the concept of a self-portrait has been around for de-
cades. A very famous Norman Rockwell painting depicts the 
artist painting his own self-portrait — a meta-selﬁ  e. Selﬁ  es 
have arguably been around for decades, from painted self-portraits to smartphones. The concept of a selﬁ  e isn’t new at all: It has simply been adapted to describe self-portraits in relation to modern technology and the proliferation of social 
media. 
Selﬁ  es, according to Noah Berlatsky at The Atlantic, are a 
modern art form and should be treated as such. 
“Is there really an essential selﬁ  e-ness?” Berlatsky wrote. 
“You can make a selﬁ  e celebrating your achievements as a 
Marine, or you can make a selﬁ  e attempting to turn your-self into the airbrushed models on glossy magazines. They’re both selﬁ  es, just as ‘50 Shades of Grey’ and ‘To The Light-house’ are both books. The selﬁ  e is a deliberate, aesthetic ex-
pression — it’s a self-portrait, which is an artistic genre with 
an extremely long pedigree. There can be bad self-portraits and good self-portraits, but the self-portrait isn’t bad or good in itself. Like any art, it depends on what you do with it.”
Selﬁ  es have an intimate quality that posed photos sim-
ply can’t capture. Selﬁ  es are for snapping on the ﬂ  y at con-certs, parties, lunch dates and family get-togethers, cheek-to-cheek with a blurry arm extending from one corner. Selﬁ  es are for meticulously editing on Afterlight and Aviary with 
splashes of light and colorful ﬁ  lters. Whether you’re taking 
a solo photo to document your progress at the gym or your on-point winged eyeliner, a selﬁ  e here and there never hurt anyone. 
Of course, we don’t recommend you measure your self-
worth from the sum and quality of your Instagram photos. It’s a simple, succinct form of expression, a literal snapshot into the lives of others and ourselves. So you might as well have fun with it — take one over the break with your mom, 
download the Catwings app and splash a few kitties across 
it. Upload it, and harvest the likes. It’s all in the name of good, clean fun.

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgFriday’s question: Do you think UF can 
become a top 10 university? Today’s question: Do you think Thanksgiving Break 
starts early enough?We must do more to stop the ‘tide of evil’
Against a tide of evil, it can seem overwhelming to 
be even a single drop of good.
The ﬁ  rst genocide of the 21st century happened 
in a region of Sudan. The mass killing of the people of Darfur is an atrocity most people can’t fathom. The num-ber of casualties, as far as the United Nations can report, ranges from about 178,000 to 461,000 people since 2003. 
The Sudanese government estimates 450,000 people have 
been displaced as refugees of this civil war. 
Genocide is a particular kind of evil. As Mukesh Kap-
ila said in a recent reading at the Miami Book Fair Inter-national, it is an orchestrated ill of the past, present and 
future. 
Kapila said a recent visit to the Holocaust museum 
and memorial in Paris shows that these crises are fright-
eningly similar from continent to continent, decade to de-
cade, disregarding culture, socioeconomics and political 
leadership.  
Kapila wrote “Against a Tide of Evil: How One Man 
Became the Whistleblower to the First Mass Murder of the Twenty-First Century” as a revealing expose of the 
state of Darfur in 2003, when he was stationed there as 
the United Nations resident and humanitarian coordina-tor and UN resident representative for Sudan. It is a per-sonal account of what he saw there in 13 months before 
he was transferred out of Khartoum before ﬁ  nishing his 
assignment.
In the book, he has a particularly poignant recollection 
of a Darfuri woman who tells him about the kidnapping and violation of women and children from her village. 
As she was silenced by Sudanese men who deemed her 
story a lie, Kapila said he felt powerless. A man with vet-eran experience in handling humanitarian crisis and the world’s strongest conﬂ  ict resolution institution at his dis-
posal felt he could do nothing. 
It was his designation of Darfur as the “world’s great-
est humanitarian crisis” in 2004 that spurred the media coverage of the conﬂ  ict.
The atrocities in Darfur had 
similarities to the conﬂ  ict less than a decade old in neighbor-
ing Rwanda, from mass killings to the rape of women as a tactic of war to the exploitation of chil-
dren as armies. But the world 
gained the Internet during those 
years, making Darfur the ﬁ  rst genocide to have an online presence. The “Save Darfur” campaign that involved more than 100 organizations became a global success in 
informing the public about what was happening, partly 
thanks to leaders like Kapila who spoke out. 
When the conﬂ  ict doesn’t touch us directly, we don’t 
act. Even if we know what is happening through a social 
media campaign and the proliferation of mainstream me-
dia, there is even less happening in reality to prevent or stop the “tide of evil.” Surely, these campaigns were well-intentioned, but they allow us as citizens to feel good about something that simply comes with our generation: 
connectivity and information. At our ﬁ  ngertips, with the 
press of a few keys, we can at once ﬁ  nd out, accept and dismiss a cause that deserves so much more attention.  
We then continue to place blame on the government, 
on the institutions that organize our world order and “the way things are.” But Kapila makes an interesting, albeit self-deprecating point in his book: It is the failure of indi-viduals, both good men in power and good people who care, that allows Darfur and other tragedies to continue. 
Those who strive to be watchdogs for the people by 
keeping tabs on the government should press on and hold them accountable for individual actions. 
But they must also have the agency to take action 
themselves.

As the nights grow longer 
and the temperature slow-ly cools, we are faced with 
a series of festive days. It’s a whirl-wind for all Americans, especially students, who use the time to visit family, cram for ﬁ  nals and crank out that 15-page essay the night be-fore it’s due. 
Thanksgiving is an especially 
joyous time. 
It’s a day where we hopefully 
have the wonderful opportunity to gather with our families, feast together, watch football and take lengthy naps.
Oh, America, how grateful we 
are for your national day of thanks.
However, as American families 
gather around their tables to dine on a delicious meal, underpaid workers will put on their uniforms to work at retail stores across the nation. The holiday President Abra-ham Lincoln declared for our great nation is eroding away at the prom-ise of a good bargain on Thanksgiv-ing evening. Many of the largest U.S. retail-
ers, including Wal-Mart, Macy’s, Kohl’s, Best Buy and a slew of oth-ers are opening Thanksgiving eve-ning to give shoppers the chance to purchase hordes of crap manu-factured overseas at prices so low, they’re insane. Kmart — perhaps the biggest offender of them all — is opening at 6 a.m. on Thanksgiv-ing and will remain open for 41 consecutive hours.
Of course, it’s all about the cus-
tomer convenience. Who cares how many low-wage employees have to skip time with their family and friends in order to assist throngs of animalistic shoppers? 
In what qualiﬁ  es as one of the 
saddest yet most uplifting stories of the year, employees at an Ohio Wal-Mart recently started a food drive — to feed other Wal-Mart employees on Thanksgiving. When you have to start a charity collec-tion for your co-workers so they can actually eat a holiday meal, your country has reached a new low point.
Now, couple that image with 
cell phone videos of gluttonous shoppers, relishing in the cheap 
crap they get to purchase on Black 
Friday — I mean Thanksgiving. 
Little compares to the video of a woman grabbing piles of white bath towels from a bin at a Wal-
Mart and dumping them into her 
shopping cart.
Boy, did her family and friends 
luck out when they all got a set of 
stark white bath towels for the holi-
days. 
In recent years, a select few re-
tail stores dealt with violence, stam-
pedes — which in some cases led to 
the deaths of customers — and a 
whole litany of madness as Ameri-cans spent oodles of money on gifts 
that one day appear in a thrift store near you.
You have to ask yourself, what 
kind of society allows the perpetua-tion of such a disgusting trend?
When Lincoln signed the 
Thanksgiving Proclamation of 1863, I doubt he had bargain shop-ping on his mind. 
As the Civil War raged and our 
nation’s creeks, rivers and streams ﬂ  owed with the blood of fallen sol-diers, Lincoln — at the behest of a woman named Sarah Josepha Hale — issued the proclamation, setting aside the last Thursday of Novem-ber as a national day of thanks so we could all appreciate what we have. It was a dark time in Ameri-can history, but Lincoln wanted Americans to be thankful, hopeful and prayerful. 
One hundred and ﬁ  fty years 
later, he got stampeding crowds at the local Wal-Mart. 
We don’t need to abandon shop-
ping for the holidays, but perhaps we should reanalyze how and when we’re doing it. 
Is there really a need to ruin 
someone’s holiday just so you can shop, or have we become so self-ish as a nation that our shopping addiction comes before the lives of others?
Think that’s an exaggeration? 
Tell that to the family of a Wal-Mart employee who was stampeded to death on Black Friday 2008. The sales were so good, shoppers killed to get them.
It doesn’t have to be this way. 
We can and should demonstrate care and compassion for others, be thankful for what we have and re-alize the need to buy crap doesn’t help those poor employees sacriﬁ  c-ing their holiday for you.
It helps the Waltons and other 
retail giants have bigger Thanks-giving turkeys.

We have all heard the 
cheer, “It’s great — to be — a Florida Gator!” It 
is usually chanted after a football victory as the crowd exits Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium. We all feel great about our team and our school. Have you ever wondered what it is like to be an actual alligator living on campus?
If you walk along Lake Alice, it is easy to 
ﬁ  nd alligators soaking up the sunshine, but you can ﬁ  nd other “gator holes” on campus where the alligators do not appear in a ma-jestic setting.
Off Gale Lemerand Drive, across from the 
band’s practice ﬁ  eld and the parking garage, there is a drainage canal where an alligator normally lies in plain sight. Just up the road, on the corner of Gale Lemerand and Muse-um Road, you just might spot a gator hiding among the vegetation in the drainage ditch. In places such as these ponds and ditches around campus, there is something else that you are likely to ﬁ  nd with ease: trash. 
All over campus, there are garbage bins 
accompanied by a couple of recycling recep-tacles. Still, there is litter left on the grass and in the bushes. Much of this garbage ends up in a drainage ditch and gets carried away by storm run-off to the same corners of campus where you may ﬁ  nd our school’s mascot, along with other wildlife.
Although the courtyard in the middle of 
campus may appear tidy and clean, other se-cluded and forgotten corners of campus are riddled with Aquaﬁ  na bottles, Chick-ﬁ  l-A boxes and Subway wrappers. 
Are we a Student Body that thinks out 
of sight, out of mind? Or do we take pride in knowing we are a Student Body that will make changes in the world both seen and unseen? I feel we are the latter, and as eco-logical issues arise, we will tackle them. 
The issue of litter on campus has been 
around for a long time now. We all need to be more responsible and keep our campus clean, not just for ourselves, but also for the alligators and other wildlife we are so for-tunate to have on campus with us. Then we can all cheer that it’s great to be a Florida Gator.

Is it great to be a gator at UF?Guest column
This past week, some-
thing magical hap-
pened. No, it wasn’t 
brought on by a fairy god-
mother, but rather a group of princesses.
An entirely female team created an 
ad campaign that will revolutionize the way girls think — about themselves, their choices and their futures.
The “You’re Not A Princess” cam-
paign, a progressive and innovative series, soon became nationally recog-nized and includes a set of four ads 
telling girls that they in fact are not 
princesses. The creators of the ads don’t want little girls to stop pretend-ing to be princesses, but they do want them to grow up realizing they don’t 
need a prince to save and protect them 
for the rest of their lives.
Right now, only 20 percent of the 
United States’ Senate is composed of women. In the House of Represen-tatives, females are only a sparse 17.9 percent, despite 
the fact that women make up 
50 percent of the population. As more and more pro-femi-nist texts arise, we can only 
hope we see those numbers shift in a positive direction and see more girls participating in not only politics, but other ﬁ  elds such as math and science 
as well.
The “You’re Not A Princess” cam-
paign is a much-needed campaign that 
can aid young girls in developing a 
better self-image and increased self-
respect. The campaign is feminism at its ﬁ  nest and reminds girls and women of all ages that they shouldn’t be con-ﬁ  ned to society’s expectations; rather, 
they should decide who they want to 
be on their own terms.

Brittnie Baker binge-watched “Orange Is The New Black” 
on Netflix in two days. She has run a half marathon, traveled 
to 13 countries and knows almost every word to “Legally Blonde.”
But she’s not one-of-a-kind.
Capital One, for example, recently had two different pro-
files for Brittnie Baker in its system. Even the Internal Reve-
nue System was confused — while one Brittnie Baker hadn’t yet filed taxes, the other was getting a $38,000 refund.
The “real” Baker, a 24-year-old UF alumna and Florida 
State University law student, is a victim of identity theft.
Her case joined the 69,795 complaints of identity theft 
filed in Florida last year, according to the Consumer Senti-nel Network. About three times as many complaints were 
filed then as there were in 2008, making Florida part of a 
national trend that shows identity theft has been on the rise in recent years.
In fact, since 2009, Florida has had the highest number 
of identity theft complaints in the United States, according to the online database of consumer complaints run by the Federal Trade Commission.
Identity theft is a problem everywhere, said Gainesville 
Police Detective Matthew Goeckel.
“We do see our fair share of it,” said Goeckel, who has 
worked in GPD’s Economic Crimes Unit for about three years.
Alyssa Jones, public relations manager for Protect Your 
Bubble, an insurance company that offers identity protec-tion, said the company is investigating why Florida has such high rates of identity theft.
As of now, the company doesn’t know. However, she 
said, cases have continued to increase everywhere. 
“We’re so much more exposed now than we ever used to 
be,” Jones said.         
In today’s digital age, any information a person puts on-
line could be compromised.
Kristina Bergman, a UF psychology and food science and 
human nutrition junior, said her dad thinks his information was stolen when he filled out financial aid for her Bright Fu-tures scholarship.
“But he’s always buying stuff online, always buying stuff 
on Amazon,” the 20-year-old said. “I think it could be any-thing.”
Using his information, multiple credit card accounts were 
opened in Texas. Although Bergman’s family is financially stable now, her dad’s credit had been crippled.“I don’t think we’re suffering from it financially,” she 
said. “But the fear lingers.”
In Baker’s case, a stranger was using her name, Social Se-
curity number and birthday.
She received a letter, informing her a refund for $38,000 
had been issued in her name for the 2011 tax year. Knowing she hadn’t filed her taxes yet, she completed an ID theft af-fidavit in October 2012.
“I was really worried,” she said. “I realized I give out my 
Social Security number more than I want to.”
It wasn’t until February that everything was settled with 
the IRS, and she could get her real tax return.
Goeckel said one of the most active times of the year for 
identity theft is during tax season. He said people go to file their taxes and find out someone already filed them in their name.
Three days before getting the initial letter from the IRS, 
Baker received another letter.
This one was from Capital One stating “possible fraudu-
lent Capital One account that has recently been opened us-ing some or all of your personal information.”
“I obviously knew it was not me,” said Baker, who al-
ready had a card with the bank.
The police never found out who stole Baker’s informa-
tion.
Goeckel said he finds many of the people stealing identi-
ties are located out of the U.S., particularly in Eastern Eu-rope.
But in the U.S., a “fair amount” are caught, he said.Still, big-time identity theft can happen in businesses, 
like hospitals and doctor’s offices, which most people would consider secure.
Although Baker said she doesn’t know who stole her 
identity, she thinks she could have been a victim of the South Miami Hospital identity-theft scam.
During her freshman year of college, she underwent jaw 
surgery at the hospital. In March, South Miami Hospital an-nounced that two convicted identity thieves allegedly paid a respiratory therapist at the hospital for patients’ personal 
information, including Social Security numbers. The num-
bers were sold up to $150 each, and about 800 patients were affected between June 2011 and February 2012.
A similar situation happened at UF Health Shands Hos-
pital.  
About 14,000 patients were notified in April that a Shands 
employee had been involved in an identity-theft ring and had given out patients’ names, birthdays and Social Security numbers from March 2009 to October 2012, according to a UF news release.
Another incident happened in May at the UF Pediatric 
Primary Care Clinic. An employee of the clinic stole about 
6,000 patients’ and parents of patients’ information, accord-
ing to a UF news release. UF investigated and found that the employee improperly accessed some of the records.
Although doctor’s offices are considered secure, one em-
ployee could jeopardize everything, Goeckel said.
“All it takes is one bad employee,” he said.Goeckel himself was a victim about two years ago. His 
bank contacted him because it needed to authorize a charge coming from Australia. The bank solved the problem quick-
ly, and no money was taken.
He suspects his information was taken from a company 
like Netflix or Redbox. But Goeckel maintains that both 
companies are secure.
Because anyone can be a victim, he said, people need 
to be proactive about protecting their information. He said they should check their credit reports periodically.
After going through her ordeal, Baker hired a service that 
informs her when anything is changed with her account. She 
is even hesitant to give out her Social Security number to 
doctors.
“I realized how easy it is for someone to do this,” she 
said.
Goeckel said it’s almost impossible to be 100 percent safe 
and secure.
The only way to be completely safe from identity theft, 
he said, is to “live in bubble and basically use cash for the rest of your life.”Identity theft on the rise in Florida, Gainesville no exception
GPD tips for 
protecting your information:
• Set hard-to-guess passwords for credit card, bank and 
phone accounts.• Don’t give out personal information online or over the phone unless you initiated the contact.• Check your mail frequently, and take out any letters promptly.• Shred documents that may contain personal data, like bank statements, before throwing them away.• Keep your Social Security card in a secure place and only give out the number when absolutely necessary.• Minimize the number of cards you carry in your wallet or purse, and make sure to keep it in safe places.� FOOD DONATIONS ALSO INCREASE.

Locals are getting into the spirit of giving 
back as nonprofit organizations prepare for 
the holidays.
Charities are seeing an increase of people 
in need before the holidays this year as well as 
an increase in volunteers and donations. But 
they’re still urging for more help.
At St. Francis House’s soup kitchen and 
shelter, the number of homeless people who visit doubles during the holidays to about 400 a day, said Stephanie Breval, the volunteer coordinator.
The number of volunteers increases, too, 
said Lee Smith, director of operations.
“People get in that spirit of giving,” Smith 
said. “They want to be a part of it.”
He said the increase in foot traffic around 
Thanksgiving isn’t so much about the free food but about having people to share a meal with on those days.
Catholic Charities of Gainesville is also 
encouraging people to get in the spirit of giv-ing.
The group has organized a number of dif-
ferent food drives in town in time for the holi-days, including one at UF in Tigert Hall and one at the Santa Fe College Teaching Zoo.
John Barli, Catholic Charities regional di-
rector, said there is a 60 percent increase in donations during the holiday season.   
The organization has seen a slight increase 
in food donations from years past. The num-ber of people in need rose, too — by about 40 
percent, he said.
Holiday food donations can be dropped 
off at Bread of the Mighty Food Bank, 325 
NW 10th Ave., from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday. Money and food donations can be dropped off at Catholic Charities, 1701 NE Ninth St., from 9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Mon-day through Friday. St. Francis House is ac-cepting food and clothes from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
Monday through Sunday. 
Daniela Mejia, a volunteer at Bread of the 
Mighty, said charity is something she enjoys. 
“I like to organize, and I like to give back,” 
the 19-year-old UF biochemistry freshman 
said. “The holidays are … a time to give back because some people don’t get to experience them like you do.”As holidays approach, charities 
see more need, more volunteersBUY IT. SELL IT. FIND IT. 373-FIND

tasked with engineering a game-
winning drive for the second 
straight week. For the second 
straight time, he failed.
The redshirt freshman made 
his second career start — and his 
ﬁ  rst at home — in Florida’s 26-20 
upset loss to Georgia Southern — the Gators’ ﬁ  rst loss to a Football Championship Subdivision team in program history.
“We’re upset,” Mornhinweg 
said. “We should’ve won the game.”
Although the onus of the loss 
does not completely fall on the quarterback’s shoulders — the defense surrendered 429 rushing yards — Mornhinweg felt like he deserved as much of the blame as 
anyone else.
“We got to go make plays, and 
a lot of that falls on me,” he said. 
“So, I’ve got to do a better job.”
Mornhinweg began the game 
poorly. The Gators (4-7, 3-5 Southeastern Conference) drove into the red zone on their ﬁ  rst drive on the strength of start-
ing tailback Kelvin Taylor, who rushed for 54 yards on eight car-ries during the drive.
When Florida got to the Geor-
gia Southern (7-4, 4-4 Southern 
Conference) 10-yard line, offen-
sive coordinator Brent Pease di-
aled up two straight pass plays, but Mornhinweg was nearly in-tercepted on both of them.
The game did not get much 
better for the redshirt freshman. 
At the end of the ﬁ  rst half, he had 
completed four passes for only 6 total yards.
“I got to just open up a little bit 
more with my throws,” he said.
The Gators fell behind in the 
second half and showed little ability to get back in the game. The running attack that gave 
them an early lead struggled, and 
the defense allowed the Eagles’ triple option to run the ball up and down the ﬁ  eld.Redshirt freshman struggles in second career start

The Gators’ injury-depleted defense 
has been leaking for several weeks.
During Florida’s 26-20 loss to Georgia 
Southern on Saturday at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n 
Stadium, the dam burst completely.
Florida allowed Georgia Southern to 
rack up 429 rushing yards, which were the fourth most surrendered in program history and the highest total it had al-lowed since giving up 524 yards on the ground to Nebraska in the 1996 Fiesta Bowl.
Despite failing to complete a pass in 
the game, Georgia Southern became the 
ﬁ  rst non-conference opponent other than 
Miami or Florida State to beat Florida at home since Memphis State accomplished the feat in 1988.
“This is what they do for a living,” 
coach Will Muschamp said. “It’s hard to defend them. The way you defend these teams is you change the scoreboard on the other side and you get them out of 
their rhythm and you create negative 
plays and you get them behind the down and distance.”
Florida (4-7, 3-5 Southeastern Confer-
ence) was rarely able to accomplish any of the tasks Muschamp mentioned.
Its offense sput-
tered much of the 
game, and its defense 
failed to consistently diagnose who was do-ing what when Geor-gia Southern (7-4, 4-4 Southern Conference) ran its trademark tri-ple-option offense.
The results were damning.
Jerick McKinnon rushed for 125 yards 
and a touchdown for the Eagles. Kevin 
Ellison added 118 yards and two more scores. William Banks barely fell short of making it a trio of 100-yard rushers, ﬁ  nishing the game with 94 yards of his own.
“It hurts,” safety Cody Riggs said. 
“We didn’t watch what we were sup-
posed to be watching on certain plays, 
and those six, seven, eight plays are the GSU dominates run gameFIRE JOE MORGAN
I know you’re mad.
You should be.Florida should never lose to Georgia 
Southern, let alone any Football Championship Subdivision team.
Ever.The Gators play in the Southeastern Confer-
ence. You know, the league with top-ranked Alabama in it. The one that has won seven con-secutive national championships.
I don’t think all those fans chant “S-E-C! S-E-
C! S-E-C!” just to hear their own voices.
Even with 13 players sidelined due to in-
jury, Florida’s loss was inexcusable. Especially 
considering the Eagles were missing 19 players 
of their own due to various injuries.
I think it’s safe to call Saturday’s game the 
worst loss in Florida football history.
Georgia Southern torched the Gators in the 
ground game, piling up 429 rushing yards — an outlandish total that marks the fourth most rushing yards Florida has ever surrendered.
The Eagles didn’t even need to complete the 
three passes they attempted.
They simply beat the daylights out of the 
Gators. Don’t let the six-point margin of victory fool you.
But even though Saturday was a living hell 
for the Gator Nation, don’t overreact.
At this point, ﬁ  ring Will Muschamp just doesn’t make much sense.
Athletic direc-
tor Jeremy Foley has already stated he is 
“1000 percent” behind 
Muschamp. Reneging on his word less than a month later would 
not only be a foolish PR move, but it would be damning in the long term.
Firing Muschamp this season would send a 
harsh message to the brave souls who would potentially vie for the chance to resurrect this 
program. Win now and win all the time.
People forget that Muschamp had this team 
one victory away from a spot in the Southeast-
ern Conference Championship Game in Atlan-ta last season. One tumultuous season full of decimating injuries later, and everyone wants to kick him to the curb.
You think Bobby Petrino would want to 
risk his next big career move for a two-year 
window to rebuild the Gators? Not even the 
always-optimistic James Franklin would aban-don Vanderbilt for Gainesville after a swift ﬁ  r-ing of Muschamp.
Foley should exercise some patience here, Muschamp deserves more timeSEE SKYLER, PAGE 14

Will Muschamp, UF coach
on Florida’s offensive problems

Georgia Southern’s triple option confused Florida defense
rushing touchdowns by Kevin Elli-
son and William Banks. The Gators did not have any margin for error on defense with an offense that punted ﬁ  ve consecutive drives 
from 9:06 remaining in the second 
quarter to the end of the third. 
Muschamp publicly admitted 
that frustration directed towards the offense has manifested itself in a once-vaunted defense.
“It becomes infectious. It’s hard 
when you give up 17 points (and) you hope you score 17,” Mus-
champ said. 
“That’s hard right now.”
The triple option, by design, eliminated the talent disparity and slowed down a Florida defensive line that had trouble dealing with a Georgia Southern offensive line that cut blocked at the knees. 
Defensive coordinator D.J. Dur-
kin said before the game that the team had been preparing for the 
triple option since the summer, but 
the Gators did not look the part. Instead, they played like a team that had only four days to prepare. Georgia Southern torched Florida for 7.9 yards per rush.
“They get to the perimeter re-
ally fast. It’s sometimes hard to use your athletic ability,” safety Cody 
Riggs said. 
“You have got to use your eyes 
and play everything.”Despite a defense that surren-
dered 429 rushing yards and an 
offense that could not move the football, Florida had a chance to win after Younghoe Koo shanked his second extra point on Saturday afternoon. 
Five completions moved the 
Gators from their own 36 to the Ea-gles’ 24 with fewer than 30 seconds remaining. Down 26-20, Mornhin-weg needed a touchdown. Florida had four plays to get it.
Three plays later, Georgia 
Southern deﬂ  ected his fourth-down pass to Patton in double coverage to end the game. The Ea-
gles’ sideline rushed the ﬁ  eld. The 
Gators couldn’t leave The Swamp fast enough. The Gator Marching Band, cheerleaders and mascots sang the alma mater alone. 
The longest bowl-appearance 
streak in the nation ended. Florida, now guaranteed its worst season in 35 years, has to get over the shock of arguably the worst loss in pro-gram history.
Players such as Riggs, who ar-
rived at Florida while Urban Mey-er was still the coach, will have January off for the ﬁ  rst time in their careers.
“I’m not going to lie. I never 
would have seen that coming to Florida,” Riggs said. “That’s very upsetting.”
Dominique Easley witnessed 
his ﬁ  rst game on the sidelines since suffering a season-ending torn right ACL on Sept. 24. Jeff Driskel watched with a walking boot on his right leg. Driskel and Easley conjured up thoughts of what Florida was, what it failed to become and what it could have been in 2013.
It does not get any easier for the 
Gators. 
Next up is No. 2 Florida State. 
Muschamp expects Murphy to miss his third straight start. Mi-chael Taylor will not play due to a right MCL injury he sustained in the ﬁ  rst half.
“The morale on this team is at 
an all-time low. We have a lack of 
leadership,” Halapio said. 
“We just really need to tighten 
up as a team.”
FOOTBALL , from page 1
and he is wise to do so. When you’re operating with millions of 
dollars, firing someone so rashly is irresponsible.
Muschamp deserves at least another year. Florida needs to 
give him more time.
Not every coach can be an overnight success like Steve Spur-
rier. That’s why there’s a statue of the Ol’ Ball Coach outside the stadium. And because he won a Heisman, but I digress. 
Another issue to consider is morale.If Foley fired Muschamp today, what does that do to this 
weekend’s Florida State game?
Exactly.I know most Gators fans are going into this weekend’s game 
with a defeatist attitude and it’s sound reasoning. The No. 2 Sem-inoles are almost unstoppable. But if you fire Muschamp, you’re 
looking at an even bigger dud of a game.
Muschamp deserves to come back, but the Gators need to 
make some staff changes.
From the sound of Muschamp’s postgame press confer-
ence, offensive coordinator Brent Pease is most likely done in 
Gainesville. Whether you want to blame the personnel or his love of the Trey Burton Wildcat, Pease is the man who will likely 
fall on the sword this year.
But Muschamp should not take the fall. At least not yet.
I know that’s tough to hear after such an embarrassing loss, 
but keeping Muschamp is the right thing to do.
With a new offensive coordinator and much healthier team in 
2014, Florida could very well return to the heights of 11-2 and a Sugar Bowl appearance.
Maybe they could accomplish even more.Florida needed a big play 
to get back into the game, 
and Mornhinweg delivered.
The redshirt freshman 
tossed a 46-yard touchdown pass to Solomon Patton on second and 10. The score tied 
the game at 20 with 5:41 re-
maining in the fourth quar-ter, causing a previously qui-et crowd to erupt in cheers.
“[Patton] ran a great route, 
and I just put it out to him,” Mornhinweg said. “He made a good play for it.”
But Georgia Southern 
quickly quieted the stadium. The Eagles jumped back into the driver’s seat with a five-play, 75-yard drive that gave them a six-point lead.
GSU’s drive left enough 
time for Mornhinweg to have one final shot to be the hero.
He drove Florida 47 yards 
down the field into Geor-gia Southern’s territory, but Mornhinweg never got the Gators past the 17-yard line.
He made two final heaves 
toward the end zone. The first was overthrown. Wide receiver Quinton Dunbar got a hand on it, but the ball slipped away.
“I’ve got to give him a shot to score there, and that’s 
on me,” Mornhinweg said. 
“I got to give him the shot to make the play.”
Mornhinweg’s final shot 
at the game-winning touch-
down was intended for 
Patton but fell incomplete. By the time the ball hit the ground, Georgia Southern’s 
players and fans were cel-
ebrating.
After the loss, coach Will 
Muschamp did not rule out starter Tyler Murphy (shoul-
der) for Florida’s game 
against No. 2 Florida State on Saturday. But if the red-shirt junior misses his third 
consecutive game, Mornhin-
weg will be tasked with fac-ing one of the nation’s top teams, which is two wins away from playing for the 
national championship.
Mornhinweg believes he 
has improved since making 
his first start in Florida’s loss 
to South Carolina last week. 
If he starts again, he will 
need to accelerate that pro-
cess.
“I think I’m getting better 
every week,” Mornhinweg said. “We work hard every week, game plan, on the field, everything … Coach 
Pease has done a great job 
moving me along.”14, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, NOVEMBER 25, 2013

Florida entered the game with 
the Southeastern Conference’s third-best rushing defense, but 
that ranking no longer properly 
categorizes a unit that has been consistently shredded during its six-game losing streak.
“We’ve had a lot of hardships 
this year,” Riggs said. “Not using that as an excuse again, but it’s just a rough year for us.”
Injuries: Adding injury to 
insult, UF’s defense was lost sev-eral more players.
Linebacker Michael Taylor 
left the game during the first half after suffering a knee injury and did not return. Muschamp said Taylor is doubtful to play against Florida State on Saturday.
Darrin Kitchens suffered a 
stinger during the game. His de-parture, along with Taylor’s, left Florida’s defense playing with multiple seldom-used lineback-ers, including walk-on David Campbell. 
Alex Anzalone, a third UF 
linebacker, suffered a shoulder dislocation. His status moving forward is uncertain.
The injuries further depleted 
a defense that came in short-handed. 
Florida announced prior to 
the game that defensive end Jon Bullard (knee) and cornerback Marcus Roberson (ankle) would be out due to injury.
Streak continues: Quinton 
Dunbar’s 3-yard catch in the third quarter extended his program re-cord for consecutive games with at least one reception to 27. noteS , from page 12

Cory McGee thought about one 
person as she walked up to the 
starting line at the IAAF World 
Championships in Moscow on 
Aug. 11.
His name is Douglas Zembiec.She had known him her entire 
life. Zembiec, a U.S. Marine Corps major, died in Baghdad on May 11, 2007. He was 34.
“He would spend all sorts of 
time as a teenager hanging out 
with my family, working out, run-
ning with us,” said Jim McGee, her father. “He always came over for Thanksgiving. Very, very close member of our family.”
Cory finished 10th in her heat 
for the 1,500-meter race with a time of 4:12.33, which was 3.06 seconds shy of advancing to the semifinals. The memory of Zembiec kept her going.
“It kind of gives me that extra 
strength, because I grew up with him as like my brother,” she said. “I think that his strength and his legacy in the military and just who he was as a person and the trag-edy of him dying so young is just 
something that has kept me moti-
vated.”

Her love of running started 
13 years ago. Seeing her dad and then-11-year-old sister, Shannon, running made her want to join.
“That’s when I started running 
on the beach with her,” Cory, now 21, said. “She would always go with my dad, and I would try and jump in and stick out a few miles.”
But it was not until her family 
lived in Athens, Greece, while her father worked security for the 2004 
Olympics that she had her first 
glimpse of professional running.
“Cory had a lot of exposure,” 
Jim said. “She got to see all the ath-letes, where they trained, where they slept. It kind of planted the seed for what she wanted to do in the future.”
The McGee family settled down 
in Pass Christian, Miss., when they returned to the U.S. in 2005.
The seed was ready to sprout.Yousri El Mejdoubi, a former 
runner at Southern Mississippi, wanted to coach McGee after see-ing her race at a state meet when she was in the seventh grade. 
“He’s mentored me through it 
all,” McGee said. “He made the sport fun for me. He made me love 
it. But he also made me work really 
hard.”
El Mejdoubi’s coaching paid 
off. 
On March 12, 2006, McGee ran 
the mile at the National Scholastic Indoor Championship at The Ar-mory in New York. Despite being a 13-year-old eighth-grader on race 
day, she won the event with a time 
of 4:49.32 to set the record time for her age group while topping 23 high school athletes and one other middle school racer.
McGee collapsed as she crossed 
the finish line — an image Jim re-members well.
“She was not going to lose,” 
he said. “She gave everything she 
had.”
McGee’s training level was el-evated during her sophomore year 
of high school when she and other 
local high school runners had the opportunity to participate in a two-week camp in Colorado with El Mejdoubi.
Most of the runners gave up af-
terward. Cory did not.
“It was one of those things 
where it gave you a taste of what it 
would take to be a collegiate track 
athlete or a collegiate cross coun-try athlete,” she said, “and a lot of them figured out it wasn’t what they wanted.”
That taste of being a college ath-
lete became reality for McGee when she ran her first cross country race for Florida on Sept. 18, 2010. She 
finished sixth of 208 runners at the 
Mountain Dew Invitational, clock-ing a time of 17:47.37 in the 5K race on the Mark Bostick Golf Course.
“Cory is competitive. She’s a 
fighter,” UF cross country coach Paul Spangler said. “That’s one of the things that makes her an elite runner.”

Following her sophomore year at Florida, McGee raced at the 2012 
US Olympic Trials in Eugene, Ore. 
She ran her 1,500-meter heat in 4:17.76 on June 28, 2012, which was 0.11 seconds shy of qualifying for the semifinals.
If only she would have been 
lucky enough to have another near miss after the race.
The night after competing, Mc-
Gee went out to a local restaurant in Oregon with her mom and some friends. About seven feet away from her, a group of people was cheering and clinking their glasses. One of those glasses dropped, and a shard of it shot across the wood-en deck where McGee was stand-ing on and pierced her ankle.
“It didn’t hurt,” McGee said, 
“but it was a really big gash in my ankle.”
After running the race of her 
life, she could not fathom what had just happened.
“I should have been totally re-
motivated, totally inspired but instead I’m in a wheelchair, foot 
in a cast, stitches, surgery a week 
later,” McGee said. “It was such a freak accident. No one could be-
lieve it. I was beside myself.”
Even though the injury caused 
her to redshirt the 2012 cross coun-
try season and limit her training for three months, McGee believed that night was a blessing in disguise.
“I finally appreciated how 
lucky I am to be able to do this and how much I love it,” McGee said. 
“That’s how I was when I was a 
kid, and I think that got away from me for a good three or four years. Last year I found it again.”
McGee returned to action in 
2013. She racked up two All-Amer-ican accolades and finished as the runner-up at the NCAA Outdoor Championships in the 1,500 me-
ters.
One year removed from her 
ankle injury, McGee headed to Bel-
gium to run in the 2013 KBC Night of Athletics in July.
Needing to finish faster than 
4:09 to qualify for August’s World Championships, McGee ran the 1,500 meters in a personal-best 
4:06.67 to claim her ticket to Mos-
cow.
Even though she only ran in the 
first round at the World Champi-onships, McGee thought that com-peting in the race improved her confidence. 
“I feel like an entirely different 
athlete,” McGee said. “I learned so 
much over the summer and also 
realized that sometimes you don’t pick the circumstances, sometimes you don’t pick the time and you don’t really have any control over the other things going on in your life, but if you want to get the mis-sion done, you can.”
For Cory, the mission isn’t over 
yet.
“I’ve always imagined myself 
on a podium at the Olympics,” she said. “I still believe that I can do it, and I think as I get older, it be-comes more realistic. Being at the world championships this sum-mer, watching the final, I truly be-lieve that I belong there and truly 
believe I can compete with the 
women who were in the front.”
And when she gets there, she 
will think about Zembiec.
“It puts it in perspective what 
we do,” she said. “We’re just ath-letes. Essentially what we do is a game and what he did was to rep-resent the United States in a much 
more real way.”

It came down to the final day of competi-
tion at the Ohio State Buckeye Invitational 
for the Gators men’s and women’s swim-ming and diving teams. 
Florida broke six school records, regis-
tered 22 NCAA automatic qualifying times and the women’s team orchestrated a dra-matic win during the three-day meet.
The women used wins in four of the six 
events on Day 3 to secure a four-point vic-tory in front of second-place Virginia.Although Florida’s men’s team got out 
to an early lead on Day 1 and had an even better performance on Day 2, Ohio State took the lead on Saturday and held the lead through Sunday.
Of the five in-
dividual school records the Gators women set, two 
belong to senior Hilda Luthersdottir, who dominated the breaststroke events. She made program history with swims in the 100-yard breaststroke (59.55 seconds) and 200-yard breast (2:08.37). Florida’s 25-year record in the women’s 
1,650-yard freestyle was broken Sunday when senior Alicia Mathieu touched the wall at 15:46.17, 
“Every day at practice, I look at the re-
cord board. That has been my goal since I’ve gotten here,” Mathieu said. “It was a tough swim for me. I felt forced to go out faster than I usually do, but I held on.”
Sophomore Natalie Hinds took down the 
100-yard free record that had stood since 2010.
Senior Ellese Zalewski was in on the 
record-breaking action Saturday with her 
51.13 seconds in the 100-yard butterfly.
The women’s 400-yard medley relay 
squad (3:30.27) grabbed the first school re-cord of the weekend to finish Day 1.
“With our program being in this type of 
dynamic this early in the season, makes this 
one of our most successful falls. We weren’t really expecting as much as far as school 
records,” coach Gregg Troy said. “We had 
a lot of good performances. We still have some weak areas that we need to address, but overall, this is what you want to see in the fall.”
To compliment the records, UF is get-
ting poised for the postseason with those 22 NCAA ‘A’ cuts it picked up in a meet that Troy said he used to assess his team.
“From the stand point of finding out who 
we were, we met a lot of our goals this week-end,” Troy said.

FIVE GAMES OF SEASON.

After missing the Gators’ ﬁ  rst 
ﬁ  ve games due to a suspension dat-
ing back to the summer, Scottie Wil-bekin will play in No. 16 Florida’s road matchup against Jacksonville 
tonight at 7. 
The senior point guard’s suspen-
sion for a violation of team rules, 
which was announced June 10, kept him away from team workouts dur-ing the summer. 
But since the Gators started prac-
tice in October, Wilbekin has served as part of the scout team and ac-
complished all of Billy Donovan’s requirements to fully return.
“He’s served his time and his 
punishment,” Donovan said. “And 
to his credit, he’s done everything that’s been asked of him. He’s shown an incredible commitment to get back on the team and to do 
the right things and, more so than 
anything else, to really prove to his teammates that he’s committed to the team.”
The Gators (4-1) started freshman 
Kasey Hill at point guard in place of the suspended Wilbekin until Hill suffered a high left ankle sprain against Southern on Nov. 18. With-
out Hill and Wilbekin, Donovan 
relied on Michael Frazier III, Dorian Finney-Smith and DeVon Walker to run the offense in Florida’s 79-59 win against Middle Tennessee on Thursday.
Despite the victory, the Gators 
recorded only 10 assists — their sec-ond fewest this season. They also racked up 12 turnovers — their sec-ond most this season. 
“It was the ﬁ  rst time I can re-
member as a coach ... where we just didn’t have a pure point guard the whole entire game,” Donovan said. “That’s really never happened. There’s always been somebody back there that we can utilize, whether it be just one guy or a backup.”
Although Donovan said he has 
not decided if Wilbekin will start 
tonight’s game, he said the senior 
point guard will play plenty of min-utes against the Dolphins (2-3). As Florida’s starting point guard last year, Wilbekin averaged 32 minutes per game, which was the most on the team.
In addition to the ﬁ  ve assists per 
game — the second highest average 
in the Southeastern Conference last 
season — the Gators gain with Wil-bekin back on the ﬂ  oor, the defense receives a boost as well. Wilbekin’s team-leading 53 steals helped him earn a spot on the SEC All-Defensive Team last season.
“In my opinion, he’s — if not the 
best — one of the best defenders in 
the country,” Frazier said of Wil-
bekin. “Just defensively, he’s a lead-er for our team and he’s a defensive anchor along with Pat.”
Donovan said he talked with Wil-
bekin about transferring last year, but Wilbekin refused the chance at a fresh start and chose to earn his way back on the team. After not 
seeing much of a change after his 
suspension last year, Donovan said he ﬁ  nally saw Wilbekin grow into a mature adult during the summer.
“The biggest thing I’ve noticed 
is a total change in his attitude, his behavior,” Donovan said. “Scottie was never ever a bad kid. It was of kind of like a warrior mentality, 
like, ‘I’ll take anything on. I can deal 
with it.’ And I think he’s gotten a lot more humble. I think he has a much, much better understanding of how his actions and things that he does impact not only himself, but other people.”16, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, NOVEMBER 25, 2013

Correlation does not equal 
causation. At least the Gators 
hope not.
Florida has lost its only 
two games against major-
conference opponents so far 
this season. 
It is a troubling early-sea-
son trend, but does it mean the Gators are doomed come conference play?
Five games into the sea-
son, Florida’s (3-2) victories have come against Bethune-
Cookman, North Florida and 
Kennesaw State. 
The Gators beat all three 
teams handily, winning by an average margin of 20 points. 
However, those opponents 
have a combined four victo-ries against the likes of Ed-ward Waters and St. Thomas. 
Florida dropped its games 
against the Atlantic Coast Conference’s Virginia Tech and Florida State by an aver-age of 10 points. 
Southeastern Conference 
leader No. 19 South Carolina currently sits at 6-0, including a 70-point victory against Big South member Charleston Southern to open the season. 
The SEC currently boasts 
six ranked teams, with peren-nial powers Tennessee and Kentucky currently in the top 10. 
The unranked Gators have 
shown the ability to be a strong team in brief instances so far this season. 
Redshirt senior Lily Svete 
sunk her ﬁ  rst four three-pointers against North Flori-da. But against Florida State, she was 1 of 4 from the ﬁ  eld. Freshman Ronni Williams 
has displayed the talent that made her Florida’s highest-rated recruit ever. 
That is, when she’s not in 
foul trouble. 
Jaterra Bonds, the return-
ing offensive leader, has been putting up solid numbers so 
far this season, averaging 17.2 
points per game. But she has not been consistent, scoring 10 points in one game and then posting a career-high 25 points in her next outing.
“We’ve just had too many 
people that we rely on who weren’t their reliable selves 
tonight,” coach Amanda But-
ler said after the loss against FSU. “Whether you’re look-ing at the stat sheet or wheth-er you’re just looking at a mental foundation maybe that they laid down for us. It was just way too much up and down, up and down, up 
and down and you just can’t 
beat a good team like that no matter where you’re play-ing.”
If the Gators remain con-
sistent, they will likely im-prove on their results from last season. So far, Florida’s been outscoring its opponents 
by an average score of 78-70. 
The Gators have had the 
edge on their opponents this 
season in nearly every major statistical category — except rebounding. 
On Tuesday, St. John’s 
comes to Gainesville averag-ing 43.5 rebounds per game. 
With Florida averaging 35.2 
per game, the Gators will have their work cut out for them against an undefeated Red Storm. Gators troubled by
