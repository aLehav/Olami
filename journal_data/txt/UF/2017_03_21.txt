FRIDAY AT 9 P .M.

Alligator Staff Writer
A polarizing rapper and a gui-
tar-playing, stand-up comedian 
are coming to UF on Friday for a 
night of free entertainment.
The Reitz Union Board Enter-
tainment announced Monday that rapper Young Thug and come-dian Demetri Martin will perform 
at the fourth annual Big Orange Festival, a free show for students with valid Gator 1 Cards. 
Martin will be performing in 
the Reitz Union Grand Ballroom at 9 p.m., and Thug will be in the Reitz Union Rion Ballroom at 11 p.m., said Kaitlin Milligan, the 
RUB Entertainment president. 
“We have two very relevant 
artists who are very talented in their respective ﬁ  elds,” she said.
Students can pick up one 
ticket for only one of the shows on Thursday and Friday from 11 
a.m. to 2 p.m. at a RUB Entertain-ment booth on the North Lawn, 
she said. 
Thug is being paid $68,000 
and Martin is being paid $30,000, 
Milligan said. The money comes 
from the organization’s budget. 
Austin Brown, a 22-year-old 
UF statistics senior, said he plans 
to be in the crowd for Thug’s show. 
He’s been listening to the At-
lanta rapper since his freshman year of college and is excited to see how the rapper sounds during 
a live performance, he said. 
Brown said Thug has tested the 
masculine-dominated rap genre 
by wearing a light purple dress in 
his most recent album cover and 
painting his nails.
“He’s hugely inﬂ  uential as far 
as rappers and hip-hop is con-cerned,” he said.

A bill that would allocate 
about $2.5 million for UF to re-search medical marijuana ad-vanced in the Florida House of Representatives last week.
The bill states that money 
from the General Revenue Fund will be used to fund UF’s re-search on the safety and efﬁ  cien-cy of medical marijuana. The bill, which passed through the Health Care Appropriations Subcommit-tee, moved into the Appropria-tions Committee on Friday. 
If passed in the committee, it 
will go to a full House vote for ﬁ  -nal approval. If it passes through the House, the bill states the one-time sum will go into effect July 1. 
House member Dane Eagle, a republican who represents Dis-trict 77, sponsored the bill, which was ﬁ  rst submitted Feb. 7. 
UF spokesperson Janine Sikes 
wrote in an email the money would fund UF’s proposed Mari-juana and Safety Outcomes Sur-veillance System, a program which would monitor the safety and effectiveness of medical marijuana on 25,000 enrolled pa-tients throughout the state. 
Florida’s Amendment 2, a 
constitutional amendment that allows stronger marijuana to be used for a wider list of ailments, went into effect Jan. 3. 
Of the six medical marijuana 
dispensaries licensed in Florida, two are in Alachua County, ac-cording to the Florida Depart-ment of Health’s Ofﬁ  ce of Com-passionate Use.  State bill would fund

In her ﬁ  rst year at UF, Martina 
Onyenwe said she has been on 
high alert.
Onyenwe, an 18-year-old UF 
public health freshman, said it has 
been taxing to deal with repeated 
instances of hate on campus. 
In January, a UF student left 
a noose on a professor’s lectern. About two weeks later, a man sparked a four-hour protest over his use of a swastika armband on campus. In February, racist mes-
sages were found scrawled on a 
classroom whiteboard.
And on Thursday, anti-Muslim 
grafﬁ  ti was found inside an on-campus bathroom. 
At Emerson Hall on Monday 
night, Onyenwe and about 250 oth-ers listened as UF President Kent Fuchs discussed the string of racial-ly charged incidents and the status of minority students at UF during  his ﬁ  rst-ever town hall.
Onyenwe said she wanted ac-
countability from the university. Though she’s received Fuchs’ emails denouncing hate, she didn’t feel they were genuine or did enough to address the problem.
“I feel like there’s a template, 
and he just chooses one, two or three,” she said. “They’re all very cookie-cutter to me.”
Fuchs said the town hall was 
planned about seven months ago as 
a recommendation from the Black 
Student Affairs Taskforce. He said the meeting was the ﬁ  rst of its kind at UF with a university president, and another is planned for Fall. 
“It sends a signal that indeed all 
of us can beneﬁ  t through engaging and listening, and particularly the president,” Fuchs said. “I can’t ex-pect other people to be respectful of others if I’m not myself respectful and don’t send that strong signal.”
David Parrott, the vice president 
for Student Affairs; Zina Evans, the vice president for enrollment man-agement; and Jodi Gentry, the vice president for human resources, spoke for about 30 minutes about how UF is creating a more inclusive

‘Pity for the Wild: Three 
Grotesques’ by Tennessee Williams
The UF School of Theatre and 
Dance presents a “grotesque version” of Tennessee Williams’ “Pity for the Wild: Three Grotesques” until Sunday. This production features three works by the playwright, who is often considered one of America’s finest. The works, “The Chalky 
White Substance,” “Something 
Unspoken” and “The Gnädiges Fräulein,” reintroduce audiences to Williams as a playwright of the grotesque, where unforget-table characters struggle for equilibrium in worlds interde-pendent of horror and laughter. These plays are quite unlike the 
Williams most people are ac-
customed to. Directed by Tiza Garland and Ralf Remshardt, tickets for the production are $18 for the general public, $15 for seniors, UF faculty and staff and $13 for UF students. Tickets are available through the University Box Office. More information is 
available at arts.ufl.edu.

Bodies and the Sufi Saints as Connecting the Living to the DeadA historian of the Islamic world, 
France and medicine from 
McMaster University will give a free public lecture April 6 at 5:30 p.m. in Smathers Library, Room 100. Ellen Amster will discuss the role of the bodies of saints in healing the living in precolonial Morocco. For Muslim pilgrims visiting the tombs of the saints, 
these holy bodies offered cures 
by linking heaven and earth. These traditions and beliefs were challenged by French colonial-ism and notions of science in the late 19th century and early 20th century. This event is the seventh in an eight-part series called “Death: Confronting the 
Great Divide,” during which in-
ternationally renowned scholars and filmmakers explore unique cultural and historical confron-tations with death. This event is free and open to the public and includes time afterward for ques-tions and discussion.

Evans said the number of black 
students applying, being admitted 
and enrolling at UF has increased in recent years. Fuchs also said that 
among a group of 15 top universi-
ties, UF is in the top three for the percentage of African-American students, staff and faculty. 
“We have work to do,” Fuchs 
said. “But usually the negative message overwhelms the positive message.”
William Walker, a 22-year-old 
UF African-American studies se-nior, asked Fuchs why he was si-lent surrounding some incidents, like the racist writing in Anderson Hall. 
He asked why students should 
trust administration, which caused the room to burst into applause. 
“At what point can we trust 
that you’re invested in us because many people in your position have made promises to my people, and they’ve fallen empty,” Walker said. 
Students asked how administra-
tors plan to be transparent, what resources can be added for minor-ity students and how to increase 
the number of black faculty. 
Ernesto Godinez, a 20-year-old 
UF agricultural education and com-
munication sophomore, said he felt the town hall was a productive step forward.
“President Fuchs or his staff 
cannot read our minds,” Godinez said. “To really solve an issue, we 
must ask questions.”

Lawson Nuland / Alligator Staff
Around 250 people crowd the UF president’s room at Emerson Hall 
for the town hall with UF President Kent Fuchs on Monday. The town hall focused on the relationship between the administration and diversity at UF.
The UF program would moni-
tor treatments that haven’t been approved by the FDA, Sikes said. UF would create a secure Data Warehouse to track patient data as part of the program. 
She said the $2.5 million would 
be for costs such as faculty and staff salaries and data processing. 
“Evidence is lacking to evalu-
ate risk/benefit of medical mari-juana,” she said. “It is pivotal that the state establishes a system to monitor emerging safety con-
cerns, especially for use in chil-
dren.”
She said the proposed bill is re-
lated to the Compassionate Medi-
cal Cannabis Act of 2014, which 
requires physicians to submit a 
quarterly patient treatment plan to the UF’s College of Pharmacy for research on the safety and ef-fectiveness of low-THC cannabis on patients.
The details of the bill state 
that it would provide funding to implement research provisions in the 2014 act. Alicia Ciliezar, a UF nursing 
senior, said she supports the use and research of medical marijua-na. The drug helps improve pain levels for patients with issues 
such as neurologic disorders, di-
gestive disorders and anxiety. 
“I’m very eager to see the aims 
of the study, the objectives and 
the outcomes,” the 23-year-old said. “I’m sure it will be fascinat-ing and shape our perception on the substance.”

ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — A 
Florida state attorney says the 
governor overstepped his bounds 
when he removed her from a case 
after she pledged to not pursue the death penalty in any cases.
State Attorney Aramis Ayala 
filed a motion in court Monday asking a judge to allow her to pres-ent that argument in court.
“Every day state attorneys here 
in Florida make important deci-
sions on who to charge, what to 
charge and what to prioritize,” Ayala wrote in the motion. “Giving the governor the tremendous and 
unfettered discretion to interfere 
in that decision making would be unprecedented and could under-mine the entire justice system in Florida.”
Gov. Rick Scott removed Ayala 
from Markeith Loyd’s case and reassigned it to a prosecutor in a neighboring district after Ayala made her announcement against the death penalty last Thursday. 
Loyd is charged with first-degree 
murder in the killings of Orlando Police Lt. Debra Clayton and his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon.
When asked in Tallahassee 
about Ayala’s motion, Scott said he was shocked that Ayala wouldn’t seek the death penalty in Loyd’s case.
“I’m very comfortable that I 
made the right decision, and I had the authority to do it,” Scott said.
Scott said he would “deal with 
it at the time” if Ayala declined to 
seek the death penalty in other cas-
es. He also did not rule out seeking her removal.
“With regards to that, we’re 
continuing to look at our options,” he said.
The confusion over who will 
prosecute the case was evident Monday morning during a rou-tine status hearing for Loyd’s case. Both Aramis and State Attorney Brad King, the prosecutor appoint-ed by Scott to take over the case, 
were in the courtroom together.
Judge Frederick Lauten sched-
uled a hearing for next week to 
hear arguments over who should 
handle the case.
Ayala said in Monday’s motion 
that the governor had no authority 
to remove her.
“I retain complete authority 
over charging and prosecution de-cisions,” she said.
Meanwhile, almost 120 law ex-
perts from across the country sent 
Scott a letter urging him to reverse 
his decision, saying it infringed on the independence of prosecutors. The signees included two former justices of the Florida Supreme 
Court, a former president of the 
American Bar Association and doz-ens of law professors.Anti-death-penalty prosecutor

A UF student driving a motor-
cycle on Southwest Archer Road 
remains in critical condition at 
UF Health Shands Hospital after a 
crash Monday.
Joe Steven Vincent Wagner, a 
23-year-old engineering fifth year, 
was driving an Orange Kawasaki 
motorcycle east on Southwest Archer Road approaching New-ell Drive when Starke resident Glory Edith Jackson, 71, turned 
her white Buick sedan left onto 
Newell Drive into Wagner’s path at about 11:45 p.m., Officer Ben Tobias, GPD spokesperson, wrote 
in an email. Wagner was not 
wearing a helmet at the time of the crash.
Witnesses who saw the crash called police, and westbound Ar-cher Road was closed at South-west 13th Street for about two 
hours during the investigation, 
Tobias said. 
An emergency room doctor, 
who was outside in the area when 
the crash happened, helped Wag-
ner until an ambulance arrived to transport him to the hospital. 
Investigators have not said 
who was at fault for the accident, 
but Tobias said speed was not a 
factor in the crash. It is unclear if Jackson was injured in the crash. 
Almost one year ago, another 
UF student was killed riding the same type of motorcycle, a Kawa-saki motorcycle, east on South-west Archer Road. On March 25, 2016, 22-year-old Andreas 
Dinopoulos was hit by a large box 
truck turning onto Newell Drive, according to Alligator archives.

The yellow house on University 
Avenue has a name: Serenoa.
It’s the Latin name for the Saw 
Palmetto Palm Tree — the ﬁ  rst tree 
to grow back after a raging ﬁ  re. And for the employees at Gainesville Peer Respite, a new sanctuary for people working to prevent personal mental health crises, it is the ideal symbolism for the nonproﬁ  t’s mis-sion.
“It was the perfect metaphor for what we’re trying to accomplish 
here,” said Lexi Braun, director of 
guest services. “There’s always re-
growth after a crisis.”
The nonproﬁ  t respite, the ﬁ  rst 
of its kind in Florida, opened ear-lier this month at 728 E. University Ave. to give free support to any adult who self-identiﬁ  es as having emotional distress or other mental health challenges.
“Our main goal is to prevent 
hospitalization and crisis from hap-pening,” Braun said.
The nonproﬁ  t offers four servic-es: support groups, wellness activi-
ties, telephone support and over-
night stays. Guests in need can stay 
at the house for up to ﬁ  ve days, but must be able to feed and take care of themselves, Braun said. 
“We provide community and 
connection so people know there’s somebody else out there,” she said.
The two-story house has four 
single bedrooms, a living and din-ing room and a lounge space where visitors can participate in wellness activities, Braun said. Tacked on the white walls are “props,” or positive notes of reinforcements, 
for residents.
The house isn’t run by doctors 
or counselors, but eight staff mem-
bers who have each experienced a challenging past, Braun said. The house is run through private funds and a grant from the Alachua County Commission.
The house offers tours Wednes-
day through Sunday for people interested in staying. Guests who would like to stay overnight ﬁ  rst interview with staff members, Braun said.Ernesto Escoto, the director of 
the UF Counseling & Wellness Cen-ter, said with Florida ranked almost 
last in the nation for mental health 
funding, the new respite is an im-
portant addition for Gainesville.
“There’s a need for additional 
resources statewide and at the community level,” Escoto said. “It’s extremely valuable to have this resource in our community.”

 First Florida mental health sanctuary opens in GainesvilleBy Jimena T avel

Within the next week, Uber 
rides will become cheaper for UF students. 
A new UF Student Govern-
ment program, scheduled to launch within the next week, will cover 50 percent of all reg-istered UF students’ Uber rides. The program will cost about $46,000, said Ty Robare, the Ac-tion SG chairman. 
The discount will cover 
rides on campus and off cam-pus around Archer Road, 13th Street, 34th Street, University Avenue and Southwest Second Avenue. To get the discount, students will use unique access codes, which will be emailed out sometime next week, Ro-bare said. 
Students will be able to use 
the discount Wednesdays to Saturdays from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. 
“We just wanted to give 
students the cheapest possible nighttime transportation ser-vice,” Robare said, adding that Uber was the only company to respond to the offer. 
The discount ﬁ  rst started as a 
90-day pilot program in Decem-ber 2014. After the pilot pro-gram, an initial version began in 2015 but was soon shut down during that year’s Fall semester because it failed to comply with the American Disabilities Act. 
This time around, UF Trans-
portation and Parking Services will hire a new driver, who will use an ADA accessible van, Ro-bare said. 
UF administration will pay 
for the driver’s salary, which Robare did not know.  
“I’m excited to see it all come 
together,” he said. Robare said SG felt the pro-
gram was needed because DUI arrests, sexual assaults and drunk driving incidents are common concerns in Gainesville and other college towns. 
That’s why UF anthropol-
ogy freshman Elisabeth Rios-Brookes said she considered the discount a great initiative for her fellow students.
However, the 19-year-old 
does not plan on taking advan-tage of it because of personal issues with both organizations — a lack of representation in SG and what she called Uber’s “ab-solutely disgusting” support of President Donald Trump. 
“It’s great that they’re giving 
discounts,” Rios-Brookes said. “I’ll just use Lyft or ride the bus instead.”

accidentally retweeted by White House Officials. Now, 
it comes as no surprise that we’re not exactly fans of 
this budget, but we’re going to address a common criticism that 
those who do support the budget cuts often bring up: How is 
the government going to get all this money to support all these 
programs that were cut?
And that’s a very good question.Obviously, we are not expert political analysts or seasoned 
economists, but we can toss a few ideas around. We know the basics of budgeting.
As millennials, we’re going to turn to the Internet and meme 
culture for advice (note: this is a joke, readers, please don’t 
barrage us with letters about how memes should not be repu-table sources). There’s a meme that floats around sometimes, 
which lists portions of the user’s budget: rent, data, utilities, 
etc. In the original version, in addition to all those essentials 
is “Candles,” where $3,600 is allocated, in comparison to the 
more standard payments for the usual items. The user says 
something along the lines of “someone please help me bud-
get; my family is dying.” Someone replies with “Spend less on 
candles.” The original poster says “no.”
Budgeting is tricky, we know this. But if you have one big, 
inessential glaring cost that you refuse to budge on, then bud-geting goes from tricky to downright impossible. And it makes 
you a heck of a lot harder to sympathize with if you’re insistent 
on that one thing.
To the Trump administration, that thing is the wall. Yes, 
the infamous border wall, which will apparently keep all the 
big, scary, bad people out of our country and solve all of our 
problems. Never mind that historically proven, border walls just don’t work. Anthropologist Ruben Andersson wrote a book 
about migrations and borders throughout European history and 
stated that walls usually end up functioning as tools by domes-
tic governments to make it “look like they’re doing something” 
— and, most importantly, that if people want to get in, they will find a way.
We understand that was a big campaign promise, albeit one 
of the more grandiose ones. We just don’t know why it’s still 
being clung to.
The wall, in total, will cost between $12 billion and $15 bil-
lion. In the proposed budget, $2 billion has been allocated as a 
down payment. That is a lot of money that could be allocated to 
more direct needs — for instance, perhaps, funding programs 
such as ones dedicated to after- and before- school programs 
and providing underprivileged kids with free lunches. Or per-
haps funding public broadcasting. Or the part of our govern-
ment dedicated to protecting the environment.
We get it; America has a debt problem that needs to be fixed. 
But — and we turn back to the meme in times of trouble in or-der to lighten the mood — if your family is dying, then don’t 
spend thousands (or in this case, billions) of dollars on candles. 
If you’re going to justify getting rid of programs intended to 
feed hungry children, you can’t go around tossing money at some campaign promise that historically won’t even work. 
So to answer that question we posed at the beginning — 
well, we don’t know, but maybe if our government wasn’t al-
locating $15 billion to a wall, we’d have a better idea.Who do you really judge when judging someone?
My topic this week is commonly dis-
cussed, and I’m adding no more to the conversation than another an-ecdote, so I decided I’d give a short course of my piece to save you time 
if you’re uninterested: Get over yourself, and don’t judge others.
Anyway, this Spring Break I went back home 
to visit my family and friends. A piece of the beautiful canvas of my old town is the commu-nity there. I wouldn’t be as quick to say it’s an antiquity like some of the more northern, rural cities of Florida, but a large portion of the community con-sists of elderly and retired citizens. With old dogs come old tricks (as well as old idioms), and, at least most of the time, old opinions. 
Let me preface this. I was enjoying myself and minding 
my business with a few friends at the mall. A member of our group had needed to use the restroom, and the rest of us decided to just sit down to chill for a second at the seating area near us. We had been talking for a bit, but, per usual, the conversation died down for a second. So we all just looked at our phones as we waited on our friend. In that moment, an older man passed by us. As he walked by, he shook his head and mumbled to himself “No sense of ‘real’ relationships.” Also, I think his ears were bad be-cause we all heard him pretty well for something that was meant to be a mumble.
I think it would be safe to assume — based on my ex-
perience with this multiple times in the past — that he was talking about all of us gazing into the life-stealing device that is a mobile telephone. Oh, the horror! 
After we all heard this, my friends and I just smiled. 
Even though in this little moment we were all wasting our time by staring into the infinite abyss imposed on us by the modern world, we all knew how wrong this old man was. These were my homies. I’ve partied everywhere with these fools, climbed cranes and construc-tion buildings with these idiots, had six-hour philosophical conversations with these morons (too many times to count), cried with these b-------, snuck into pools and skinny-dipped with these squares and done more than I could even fit into this column space. They’ll even end up the godfathers or pseudo-uncles of my children someday. 
So what was this old man basing his judg-
ment from? Well, simply put: insecurity — in-security of a changing time. He might not have 
had any ill intention and actually wished for us to have ‘good friendships’ by whatever definition he decided was good. Honestly, I don’t really disagree with him too much. I recommend people experience friendships past some-thing as transient or ephemeral as an intangible, electronic relationship. The only difference between me and him is that I’m secure in what I believe. I understand that not everyone is going to think like I do, and that’s OK. If you can tell me you’re happy with whatever it is you’re do-ing and that whatever you’re doing doesn’t hurt another person, then cool. 
This is a petty judgment that, in the long run, doesn’t 
matter. However, if we can be so sensitive to difference that we’d loudly mumble our judgment upon others, then when does it stop? Things like this can be sourced to other forms of judgment, which are much more powerful and damaging: homophobia, racism, religious persecution, etc.
Next time you judge someone, think about who it is 
you’re really judging. Judgment is the imposition of your beliefs onto another person. When you judge another per-son, you’re actually insecurely qualifying your own beliefs because that person is challenging them. Are you so inse-cure in what you believe that you must do that?

The ’90s are alive and well in 2017. 
From the resurgence of fashion trends we once rocked as children to the ubiquity of the phrase “only ’90s kids remember,” that captivating decade 
continues to exert an inﬂ  uence on modern culture, whether we realize it or not. Count-less beloved ’90s shows have been rebooted to varying degrees of success, and those that remain untouched by modern media can be revisited with the help of streaming services like Netﬂ  ix. 
I recently realized that I continued to re-
visit popular ’90s television shows despite the 
plethora of new television being cranked out 
every day. It didn’t matter that I was roughly 20 years late in watching “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” because the themes and sentiments underlying the show continued to feel mod-ern (despite the laughable special effects). The same fascination with the decade I was born into led me to Ryan Murphy’s “Ameri-can Crime Story: The People vs. O.J. Simpson,” which was recently made available on Netﬂ  ix. I’m not proud to admit that I watched all 10 episodes of it in one sitting, but 
I quickly realized that voracity is 
nothing compared to those who watched its events unfold in real time.
Once I had plowed through a 
few episodes, I called my mom to ask for her take on what seemed to me to be a dramatic plot that was too good to be true. While I knew the general framework 
of the case, I found it incredibly difﬁ  cult to 
believe that the theatrics were rooted in real-ity. My mom recalled the case with nostalgia, “I used to watch that trial every day while I was pregnant with you. It was better than the soaps. You know, you were almost named after O.J.’s daughter.” I couldn’t help but wonder whether the case’s inﬂ  uence on my formational years stopped at the potential baby names. 
It’s always an interesting, if not 
slightly uncanny, experience to learn about the cultural landscape 
you were born into yet can’t en-
tirely recall. Yet, perhaps the most unsettling elements of Murphy’s reenactment were the thematic threads that connected the “case of the century” to the cultural dis-courses that we interact with on 
an almost-daily basis in 2017. Each episode came with modern parallels: the Black Lives 
Matter movement, the discussion surround-
ing the likeability of female public ﬁ  gures, the rise of Real Housewives and Kardashians, the failure of the 24-hour news cycle and our na-tional fascination with true crime. 
It was that fascination which brought me to 
the show in the ﬁ  rst place. In the same vein as “Making a Murderer,” “Serial” or “My Favor-ite Murder,” “American Crime Story” draws on the allure of playing lawyer, detective and juror for discrete periods of 58 minutes (or 10 hours if you’re like me and have no self control). Yet, “The People vs. O.J. Simpson” 
moves beyond the shallow sensationalism of 
the true crime genre by contextualizing the conﬂ  icts we so often view as contemporary issues and highlighting their earlier manifes-tations. In essence, it proves that they’re even more complex than we initially thought. 
It’s often said that in order to understand 
something, you need to understand where it came from, and this notion applies just 
as much to societal discourses as it does to 
people. Perhaps we should keep this in mind when we feel the desire to romanticize the past, since the issues we face today won’t ever exist in a vacuum.

ONE OF THE ATTACKERS 
TOLD POLICE HE HAD 
BEEN DRINKING.
By Meryl Kornﬁ  eld
Alligator Staff Writer
Gainesville Police arrested two lo-
cal residents Sunday whom they say 
robbed a man after crashing into his 
car.
Devontae Micheal Brown, 24, 
drove his car into the gas station parking lot at 1255 W. University 
Ave., and collided with another car 
at about midnight Sunday, according 
to an arrest report. Brown got out of 
the car and grabbed the other driver 
by his neck, pushing him into the 
door of his car and demanding cash.
A passenger in Brown’s car, De-
ontae Akee’m Rutledge, 23, calmed 
Brown down and told the other 
driver to go to the ATM. The driver 
withdrew $160 and gave the money 
to Rutledge, according to the report.
Brown drove off and was pulled over by police, an 
ofﬁ  cer said. Police 
saw him weave in 
and out of his lane 
until he stopped 
at the 200 block 
of NW 13th St. 
When he got out 
of his car, Brown 
swayed while he 
stood and had glassy, watery eyes, 
according to the report.
Police found two cups that 
smelled like beer and an open Mike’s Hard drink in his 
car. After his ar-
rest, Brown said 
he drank alcohol 
four or ﬁ  ve hours 
before driving, 
according to the 
report, but had 
a blood alcohol 
content below 
the legal limit. He also had taken 
two Xanax pills, he told police.
Police also found the cash from 
the ATM and 1.5 grams of marijuana on Rutledge, according to the report.
Brown was arrested for unarmed 
robbery and driving under the in-
ﬂ u e n c e ,  a n d  R u t l e d g e  w a s  a r r e s t e d  
on charges of unarmed robbery and 
marijuana possession. Both were 
taken to Alachua County Jail where 
Rutledge remains, as of press time, 
in lieu of a $15,000 bond.
Brown was released Sunday 
night on a bond of $15,000.

they have proven able to keep rodents away, according to 
a UF researcher.
Robert McCleery, a UF Institute of Food and Agricul-
tural Sciences associate professor of wildlife ecology and 
conservation, worked with two researchers from Swazi-
land on a study that showed cats and dogs living together 
can prevent rodents from entering homes and storage 
buildings.
The study, published Feb. 3, was conducted in four 
agricultural villages in Swaziland, McCleery said. The be-
havioral patterns of the animals will remain the same no 
matter the location, he said.
Cats or dogs separately didn’t affect the rodent popula-
tion as much as the two combined, he said. Both animals 
have different hunting techniques, which makes it difﬁ  -
cult for the rats to survive. 
“Cats hunt differently, they’re going to be ambush 
predators,” he said, adding that dogs are active in the day 
and chase animals instead of pouncing. 
To test the rats’ level of fear, researchers used rat traps 
in Swaziland villages and measured if any of the food was 
taken away or not. If the food wasn’t eaten, then the rats 
were intimidated by the dogs and cats. 
In rural areas, where pest rodents aren’t controlled, 
rats spread diseases and spoil food, he said. Farms are 
more affected since crops are stored in sheds, where ro-
dents frequently visit. 
“One of the reasons people have barn cats is to get rid 
of rodents,” McCleery said. “We’re just saying get a dog, 
too, simple as that.”
- Karen PatinoUF researchers continue testing immunotherapy 
treatment on malignant brain tumors
UF researchers are in the second phase of testing the ef-
fects of immunotherapy on patients with malignant brain 
tumors. 
A team of about 30 researchers from UF worked with oth-
er universities in publishing a study in March 2015 showing 
that immunotherapy, where doctors treat patients’ existing 
cells in a lab to treat cancer, was successful on mice with glio-
blastoma brain tumors, said UF Health researcher Catherine 
Flores, the study’s lead author. In a smaller trial, research-
ers showed the treatment is also effective on humans with 
glioblastoma tumors, which are a highly malignant form of 
cancer. 
Now, researchers are conducting more human trials at UF 
Health Shands Hospital, with possible pediatric tests in the 
future, Flores said. 
There is currently no viable forms of treatment for pa-
tients with this type of tumor, she said. 
“There is really no option for patients with a brain tumor, 
so it was important for me to try to develop a potential cure 
for these patients and these families,” Flores said. 
To conduct the immunotherapy treatment, doctors took 
patients’ immune cells from their bodies, engineered them in 
a lab and transferred them back to the patients. This activates 
the patient’s immune system against the tumor, Flores said.
After the trial conducted on mice was successful, the ini-
tial human trial included 12 terminally ill patients, of which 
six survived, Flores said.
“It’s deﬁ  nitely promising,” she said. “In glioblastoma, 
there is a zero survival, so having potentially a saving treat-
ment is life-changing to these patients.”
- Dominique T orresUF council releases guidelines for Florida men to 
detect prostate cancer 
A UF-led health advisory council released recommenda-
tions regarding the detection of prostate cancer that differ from 
federal guidelines.  
The regulations, released in February, say men should be 
checked for prostate cancer more frequently and earlier than 
men in other states, said Thomas Stringer, the executive di-
rector of the Florida Prostate Cancer Advisory Council at the 
UF Prostate Disease Center. The guidelines take into account 
Florida’s population, since prostate cancer is more common 
with men in the state, especially with African-American and 
Latino men. 
“(The guidelines) are intended to be a reliable resource for 
all Florida men at a time when prostate cancer screening is 
considered by some to be controversial,” Stringer said. 
He said prostate cancer can be overdiagnosed and over-
treated, which results in contradictory and confusing screening 
guidelines.  
Cases of prostate cancer in Florida have increased for the 
fourth consecutive year, according to the American Cancer 
Society. Stringer said data showing that minority groups have 
higher instances of prostate cancer is inconclusive as to why 
that happens. 
The Florida Prostate Cancer Advisory Council recommends 
that Florida men 50 years or older get early detection testing, 
Stringer said. 
The council will continue its work in 2017 to provide educa-
tion and information to Florida men on prostate cancer risk, he 
said. The council’s next goal is to develop statewide manage-
ment guidelines for prostate cancer once diagnosis is made.
“It’s important for all men to consider this regardless of 
their race,” he said.

UF gymnastics coach Jenny Rowland is pleased to be staying home for gymnastics regionals. Read the story, pg. 14 Wyoming native T aven Bryan on Florida weather:
"It's hot. It's hot all the time. And, like, you sweat, but you keep sweating. 
There's no breeze or nothing. You get down in your stance and you just drip, 
drip, drip. So it's hot, man. "IT'S COHEN DOWN / OPINION
Ahh, March Madness.
There are upsets, there are surprises, and 
then there are the rare times when a school like 
Eastern Polytechnic Institute defeats a top-three 
seed to shake up the entire NCAA Tournament 
and college basketball world. 
As it stands, a No. 1 seed (Villanova), two No. 2 
seeds (Duke, Louisville) and a No. 3 seed (Florida State) have all been knocked out. So, with just 16 teams left that have a shot at winning a national title, let’s re-seed the top 10 teams, ranking the most likely winner to the team who really has no shot. (Or so we think.)
Honorable mentions go to the ﬁ  nal six.
No. 1 seed Kansas (previously a No. 1 seed)
The No. 1 seed probably could’ve gone a number of 
different ways. Multiple teams are deserving.
Call it a hunch, but I like Kansas as the favorite to 
win it all.
Senior guard Frank Mason III leads the Jayhawks 
with 20.8 points per game, followed closely by talented 
freshman Josh Jackson at 16.6 points per game.
Plus, Kansas is one of the most efﬁ  cient teams in the 
nation, with a team ﬁ  eld-goal percentage of nearly 50 
percent (49.1).
No. 2 seed Gonzaga (previously a No. 1 seed)Gonzaga deserves the No. 2 seed just because of the 
sheer amount of games it won this season.
The Zags (34-1) only lost once back on Feb. 25, and 
have since decimated their opponents, winning by an average of 17 points over their last ﬁ  ve games.
No. 3 seed UNC (previously a No. 1 seed)
Stop me if this sounds familiar: The North Carolina 
basketball team is crazy talented. They rank 10th in the 
nation in points per game and can score alongside any remaining teams in the ﬁ  eld.
No. 4 seed UCLA (previously a No. 3 seed)Lonzo Ball.
No. 5 seed Arizona (previously a No. 2 seed)
I’ll be honest: I haven’t watched one second of Ari-
zona basketball this season.
But with a matchup against No. 11 seed Xavier on 
Thursday, the Wildcats might have the easiest Sweet 
16 matchup of any team, and freshman forward Lauri 
Markkanen (15.8 points per game, 43.3 three-point per-
centage) can score with the best of them.
No. 6 seed West Virginia (previously a No. 4  
Re-seeding the NCAA 
Tournament’s Sweet 16

The Gators badly need to steamroll someone. Anyone.
After being swept by Auburn for the ﬁ  rst time since 
1987, which was also Florida’s ﬁ  rst time being swept in a SEC-opening series since 2009, they need a prove-every-one-wrong game. 
One that shows everyone in the college baseball realm 
that this past weekend’s play was an anomaly and this year’s Florida (13-8) team is merely off to a sluggish start. 
One that jumpstarts the offense before squaring off with 
No. 4 LSU this coming weekend. 
Enter a midweek clash with an 8-14 Stetson team to-
night.
If history repeats itself, then this should be exactly that 
type of game for the Gators. 
The last time Florida took on the Hatters, it pounded 
out 22 hits, seven of which were home runs, in a 22-2 rout on April 7, 2015. It was also a record-setting night for JJ Schwarz, who as a freshman blasted a program-record four homers himself and notched 10 RBIs. 
Just take a look at what Schwarz said after that win.“That was nice,” he said. “A lot of 
us have been struggling hitting the bats, and a lot of us broke out today.”
And while it’s true UF, which sits 
dead last in hitting (.240) and tied for 
last in runs scored (92) in the SEC, could use a similar blowout victory, it could 
also use a ﬂ  awless game in the ﬁ  eld.
Florida committed four errors over 
the three losses to Auburn, including an 
errant throw from pitcher Frank Rubio on Sunday that cost 
the game. 
That sort of play is uncharacteristic for the SEC’s leader 
in ﬁ  elding percentage and led to words not often uttered by head coach Kevin O’Sullivan. 
“We wanted to get out of here with one win which we 
weren’t able to play good enough defense to do that.”
But the Gators will have a chance to get back on track 
both at the plate and in the ﬁ  eld in Deland at 6:30 p.m.

Florida coach Jim McElwain looks on during the Gators 30-3 win 
over Iowa in the Outback Bowl on Jan. 2.

As Jim McElwain took to the lectern Mon-
day morning for his weekly press conference and began to ﬁ  eld questions about his football team, he looked on incredulously at the group of reporters sitting in front of him.
“Can we talk hoops?” he asked. “Do we got-
ta talk football here? Can we talk some hoops?”
Yes, the mania that is March Madness has 
not only spread all over UF’s campus, it’s trickled onto the gridiron, as well.
McElwain said he was extremely impressed 
with the performance the men’s basketball 
team put forth this weekend, earning a trip to 
the Sweet 16 for the ﬁ  rst time in three years 
following victories over East Tennessee State 
and Virginia.
The third-year coach also expressed con-
ﬁ  dence in guard KeVaughn Allen after McEl-wain was asked if the sophomore could break 
out of his current 3-for-21 shooting slump in 
the tournament.
“There’s no doubt in my mind,” McElwain 
said.
Men’s basketball isn’t the only thing Flor-
ida’s coach is feeling optimistic about, how-ever.
Offensive line looking solid under new 
position coach:
As the third week of Spring practice kicks 
off, McElwain said he’s “really excited” with 
the progress he’s seen on the offensive line. Oﬀ  ensive line, defensive tackle Taven

Coming off a second-place ﬁ  nish at the 
SEC Championships last weekend, the No. 3 
Gators now know who they will be hosting in the NCAA Gainesville Regional.
On Monday, the NCAA released its region-
al selections, sending No. 10 Georgia, No. 15 Missouri, New Hampshire, Penn State and North Carolina to Gainesville.
“This team was prepared to stay home for 
this weekend,” Florida coach Jenny Rowland said. “It’s always nice to know who’s coming and who we will be competing against.”
Three of the teams in the ﬁ  eld — Georgia, 
Missouri and North Carolina — are teams that 
the Gators defeated during the regular season. 
“We’re very excited to have SEC teams 
back in Gainesville,” Rowland said. “It’s al-
ways a great rival, and the team is really look-ing forward to competing in front of a home-town crowd.”
Florida was originally set to be a regional 
host last season, but due to renovations at the O’Connell Center, it was pushed back a year.
It will be the ﬁ  rst time since 2013 that a 
regional has been in Gainesville.
To advance to the NCAA Championships, 
the Gators will have to be one of the top two highest-scoring teams out of the six teams in their ﬁ  eld.
Meanwhile, Florida is coming off one of its 
most solid meets of the season.
And while the team didn’t leave Jackson-
ville with an SEC title, UF was only a few deductions — mainly from hops and balance checks — away from repeating as SEC Cham-pions.
The Gators are looking to carry that 
momentum into regionals on April 1.
“We were this close to winning, and we 
had mess ups,” Kennedy Baker said after the meet. “We’re going to be ready for NCAAs. I think we have what it takes.”

Kevarrius Hayes (right) reaches for a jump ball during Florida’s win over Virginia.T.J. McCoy, Tyler Jordan and 
Brett Heggie have all been taking 
snaps at center to create some depth on the interior.
Martez Ivey has moved to 
tackle and is getting his first seri-ous taste of Spring football after missing last Spring while recover-ing from shoulder surgery.The line has also been rejuve-
nated by its new position coach, 
Brad Davis.
Davis was hired to replace for-
mer coach Mike Summers in Feb-
ruary after stints at North Texas, East Carolina, James Madison and Portland State.
The man who started at offen-
sive line for Bob Stoops at Okla-homa in the early 2000s has only been a part of Florida’s program for a month and a half, but he’s already managed to gain respect 
from his players.
“The way they go about the 
drills, they’re not just walking to the line of scrimmage,” McElwain 
said. "They’re playing with a re-newed sense as far as how they go about it. (Coach Davis) de-mands it from them.”
Taven Bryan is a ‘monster’On the other side of the line of 
scrimmage, Florida will have to deal with the departure of Caleb Brantley, Bryan Cox and Joey Ivie 
in 2017.
While the defensive line will look for new faces to emerge as reliable contributors, one player 
who is already stepping up this Spring is Taven Bryan.
The Casper, Wyoming, native 
totaled 17 tackles, three tackles-
for-loss and one sack in 13 games 
last season, but he “lacked con-sistency,” according to McElwain.
Since practice began last 
month, however, the narrative has changed.
“He has been our most con-
sistent player, day-to-day in all drills,” McElwain said of Bryan. “He has probably taken as big a step as anybody on the team as far as consistency and perfor-mance.” 
One player who has seen 
Bryan’s improvements up close is T.J. McCoy. The two go head-
to-head at the line of scrimmage 
every practice, and the offensive 
lineman said his teammate has made great strides over the past year.
“Taven is a monster, man,” 
McCoy said. “That dude gets off the ball quick. He’s a very high energy guy… The mental part has really taken off for him as well.”

Never underestimate Press Virginia. The Mountaineers 
lead the country with an insane 724 turnovers forced, 136 
more than the next closest team. That’s ridiculous.

Defense has gotten UF to this point, and it could take 
it even farther. Plus, leading scorer KeVaughn Allen, who 
has yet to reach his points-per-game average in the NCAA Tournament so far, is due for a breakout game.
No. 10 seed Oregon (previously a No. 3 seed)Oregon gets a No. 10 seed only because it barely 
squeaked by No. 11 seed Rhode Island in the second round. The Ducks are dangerous, but they’re also vulner-able.
