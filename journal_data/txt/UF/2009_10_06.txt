SG parties discuss election complaints
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Writer
Free food, Twitter and a poster with Biggie
Smalls and Tupac made up the conversations
at the Student Government Elections Com-
mission meeting Monday night.
Only five out of the 19 complaints filedwere heard, and the commission voted two of
the complaints as violations.
The remaining complaints were dropped.
Unite Party President Joey Regalado filed
a complaint against Orange and Blue Party
candidate Graham Clark for wearing a Unite
Party T-shirt and handing out fake "I Voted"
stickers and Unite Party fliers.The commission charged Clark with a vio-
lation. He was fined $10 and given a public
reprimand.
StUdent Stephen Lawson,Government Elections Commission
chairman, said the viola-
tion could be dropped because Clark did not
receive the e-mail informing him about themeeting location and therefore was unable to
defend himself.
Two Unite Party members filed com-
plaints against the the Orange and Blue Party
for passing out free pizza and cake.
Unite Party member Dan Thompson said

SuChin Pak is proud to be an Asian-American, but
that wasn't always the case.
Pak, a former MTV news correspondent, spoke to a
crowd of about 300 Monday night in the Reitz Union
Grand Ballroom.
Accent Speakers Bureau and the Asian Student
Union brought her to UF in honor of Kaleidoscope
Month, which is a celebration of Asian culture.
Pak, who was born in Seoul, South Korea, has
worked with MTV for nine years.
"I try my best to represent young people, but it's re-
ally intimidating," she said during a press conference
before the show. \
Before her speech, Pak showed the audience a sneak \
peek of her new project, "My Life (Translated)". The
show, which will air on MTV, features multicultural
teens dealing with the pressures of fitting into the
American image.
During the clip, Pak tried different methods of cre-
ate the illusion of having wider eyes, like putting scotch
tape on her eyelid and putting eyeliner over it.
"All I wanted was one more freaking centimeter," Harrison Diamond/ Alligator Staff
Pak said in the clip. Former MTV correspondent SuChin Pak speaks in the Reitz Union Grand Ballroom Monday night. The event was co-spon-Pak said she has been on TV since she was 16 years sored by Accent and Kaleidoscope Month.

Health center to offer $10 flu recovery kits to students
0 KITS HAVE SOUP, MASKS.
By ERIN ROBERTS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Gators moms can rest easy this
flu season thanks to Florida Flu
Kits.The Student Health Care Cen-
ter will be selling care packages for
the first time this flu season at the
SHCC Pharmacy. Each kit will in-
clude the basic items necessary for
recovering from the flu, said SHCC
marketing coordinator Katherine
Lindsey.
Priced at $10, the kits will be
stocked with a can of chicken noo-dle soup, a can of Gatorade, a bot-
tle of ibuprofen, a pack of throat
lozenges, a bottle of hand sanitizer,
a box of facial tissues, five dispos-
able face masks and a digital ther-
mometer.
"These kits are intended to
educate students on how to take
care of themselves," Lindsey said.
"With the recent scare of swine fluand the large numbers of students
getting sick, we just wanted to do
something for the kids this flu sea-
son."
Laura Mize, SHCC marketing
coordinator, said it is especially
difficult for students living in the
dorms to take care of themselves
because the close-quartered living
situations make it more likely forthem to get the flu.
"I remember getting sick for the
first time and living in the dorms
when I was a freshman in college
and thinking, 'My mom isn't here
to buy me soup and Gatorade-
this sucks,"' Mize said.
Mize said 500 kits have been as-

Group to hold sexual violence awareness events
The campaign will last through Oct 13
By TATIANA QUIROGA
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF's Victory Over Violence, a
club that aims to eliminate sexual
abuse, will host a Rape, Abuse and
Incest National Network (RAINN)
campaign until Oct. 13.
"The main point of RAINN is
to get information [about sexual
violence] out to students and to getthe main statistics out so people can
become aware and protect them-
selves," said Jenna Calton, VOV
president and a psychology junior.
According to RAINN's Web site,
one out of six women in the U.S. has
been the victim of a rape or attempt-
ed rape in her lifetime.
VOV and Poets, Inc. will host
a Poetry Jam Wednesday at 7 p.m.
Calton said anyone affected by sex-ual violence can speak up during the
event.
"The topics are typically taboo
and many victims are afraid to come
forward," she said.
On "We want to make
Campus these issues OK to talk
about."
On Oct. 13, VOV and Sigma
Lambda Beta, a multicultural frater-
nity, will host a domestic violencediscussion panel in the UF Comput-
er Sciences and Engineering build-
ing.
Some of the speakers at the event
include Dr. Amanda Davis, assistant
professor of the Center for Women's
Studies and Gender Research at UF
and a representative from the UF
Police Department.
The mission of VOV is to spread
awareness about violence around
the world and in the Gainesville
community, Calton said.
Lorraine Wheat, the public rela-tions officer for VOV and advertising
senior, said the RAINN campaign
is a great way to educate people so
that rape and abuse crimes become
less frequent.
"We do it to try to prevent these
things from happening," said Cal-
ton.
"The most important thing for
people to realize is that just because
they are on campus, it doesn't mean
they're safe. Crimes can happen."

Man goes without shoes
* HE HASN'T WORN ANY FOR
MORE THAN SEVEN MONTHS.
By DALIA SABBAGH
Alligator Contributing Writer
Kevin O'Keefe owns nine pairs of
shoes, but he hasn't worn any of them
in more than seven months.
O'Keefe's calloused feet are black
from the dirt they encounter while he
goes to church, class, socials, parties
and friends' houses barefoot.
He said he forgoes shoes to remind
himself of his blessings.
"I have seen a lot of poverty within
the city, country and all over the world,
and I needed to do something to con-
stantly remind me of the poverty all
around me," he said.
When he took off his shoes and left
them off, it was a sunny day and the
pavement was hot from the sun.
"It was all fresh pavement, and at
the end of the day my feet were ten-
der," he said. "Now, by the end of the
day they still hurt but I suck it up or
walk faster. I've gotten used to it."
O'Keefe, a telecommunications
sophomore, said no professors have
asked about his lack of shoes.
"Its college. Professors see weirdthings every day," he said.
Not everyone is so impassive.
On the way to the bus stop one day,
someone yelled from a car, "Wear some
shoes, you fucking weirdo!"
But O'Keefe said he isn't discour-
aged.
"There are places in the world
where people can't get shoes. People
look at me and think I'm weird, but
they don't see how common it is," he
said. "I am secure, and I know why I'm
doing this. It's sadder that [society sees
me as weird.] What if I didn't have the
money for shoes?"
O'Keefe has made a game of the
times people do ask him about it.
"Every time someone asks me about
my shoes I put $5 in a fund to spon-
sor a child through an organization
called Compassion International," he
said.: "It's a combination of personal
reminder not to forget how much God
has blessed me but also to remember
my friends who are homeless -a call
to action."
Lauren Wilkins, a friend of
O'Keefe's, said she admires his drive.
"It redirects me, makes me think of
how blessed I really am," she said.
When O'Keefe encounters situations
where shoes are not optional, he wears
TOMS shoes, a company that gives aAndrew Stanfill / Alligator Staff

to remember those who can't afford shoes. He said he hopes to make it

pair of new shoes to a child in need for
every pair purchased.
"[Not wearing shoes has] served the
purpose that I wanted it to, especially
when they start hurting. With every
step it reminds of how blessed I am and
it keeps me in a mindset and remindsme that certain struggles aren't as bad
as we think," he said.
O'Keefe said he plans to keep it up
until he has gone through an entire year
and experienced a shoeless winter.
"It keeps me grounded," he said
with a chuckle, "get it?"

Zombie preparedness plan removed from Web site
By ANDREW WYZAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
When the living dead rise from the grave,
Doug Johnson will be ready for them.
He wants UF students to be ready too.
Last week, Johnson posted a zombie at-
tack plan for UF students and faculty on the
e-Learning Support Services Web site.
The plan was removed from the LSS site
Thursday afternoon.
"I was told by my boss, very nicely, that
it should be taken down," Johnson said.
"UF is searching for a new Chief Informa-tion Officer (CIO) and it was felt that the
plan would hamper the seriousness of the
search, which is a very valid reason for re-
moval."
The question of disciplinary action to-
ward Johnson for posting the plan has been
brought up by others outside of UF, but
Johnson denies that those claims exist.
"Nobody has even said anything about
disciplinary action," he said. "It's not even
on the table."
A manager of Learning Support Servic-
es (LSS), Johnson said he came up with the
plan while awake late at night. He named"Disaster preparedness is
something I take seriously."
Doug Johnson
Learning Support Services manager
it Zombie Attack Disaster Preparedness
Simulation Exercise #5.
"I have a chronic problem with insom-
nia," he said. "I was up in the wee hours in
the morning and how the idea of a zombie
disaster plan came up I have no idea."
Johnson's job at LSS, along with the team
he manages, is to come up with various di-saster scenarios and exercises to better pre-
pare UF employees and students should
the need emerge.
"Disaster preparedness is something I
take seriously," he said. "It is important to
keep the UF system up and running, and
we try to run disaster plan exercises every
year.
Johnson went on to describe that while
the plan instilled levity and humor to his
team, it led to a very valuable discussion
about scenarios in which employees should
keep away from campus due to obstruction
or danger, such as during and after a hur-
ricane.
93-year-old celebrates birthday by donating books
0 HE GAVE ABOUT 2,000
BOOKS TO THE CMC.
By TIMOTHY TAYLOR
Alligator Contributing Writer
Stetson Kennedy, folklorist, hu-
man rights activist, environmental-
ist and author, celebrated his birth-day this year by giving instead of
receiving.
Kennedy, who turned 93 on
Monday, donated his personal li-
brary of about 2,000 books to the
Civic Media Center.
Kennedy isnot aswell-known as
he should be, said James Schmidt,
a CMC coordinator.
He infiltrated the Klu Klux Klanin the 1940s, providing KKK secrets
to the producers of the "Super-
man" radio program, which ran a
series of episodes in which Super-
man battled the KKK.Local He even authored aNewS book about his expe-
riences called "The
Klan Unmasked."
He also wrote other books de-scribing the South before the civil
rights era.
Many of the human rights fig-
ures of the past have been "sani-
tized," he said, or turned into cari-
catures instead of the real people
they were, in order to make them
more palatable to the general pub-
lic. Kennedy has refused to let this
happen, Schmidt said, and so hisfame has suffered.
Kennedy donated the collec-
tion to secure for others a record of
the history that he lived through,
Schmidt said.
"He is trying to create a physical
manifestation of the long memory
that he has," said Schmidt. "It's
amazing that someone at his age
can be that conscious."

Greedy Gators
Students shouldn't take
advantage of fans
o desire to go to Jacksonville on Halloween
weekend." "I like money." "Can't make the
game and know you really want to go!"
Thumbs down, Gators.
As expected, Craigslist and Facebook marketplace were
bumpin' on Monday night with dozens of students selling
their Florida-Georgia tickets.
Okay, $50 for a ticket isn't horrible, as they originally
sold for $40. But $200?
It's not fair to take advantage of Gators fans who want
to cheer on their team when we dominate the Bulldogs on
Oct. 31.
Students applied for tickets at 6 p.m., only to turn
around and scalp them an hour later.
"I need to pay my rent" is a bad excuse. "I didn't know
I couldn't go" is even worse. Denying an offer for under
$100? Shame on you.
But Gators fans aren't the only ones ripping off fellow
fans.
Georgia fans started their scalping spree a few hours
before, asking just as much for their tickets.
To both groups, we ask you to consider the requests
of seniors who have one last opportunity to experience
the event formerly known as the world's largest cocktail
party.
We know the game is on Halloween, but these prices
are more than scary.
New Pooh
Deep in the forest ofthe Hundred Acre
Wood, things are
about to get a little sweeter.
It seems as though Pooh has
a new honey.
"Return to the Hundred
Acre Wood," the newest
installment in the classic
Winnie-the-Pooh books, is
the first authorized sequel in
more than 80 years, accord-
ing to an article in The New
York Times.
And when Christopher
Robin returns home from
boarding school for summer
vacation, things won't be ex-
actly the same.
Pooh -who may have a
rounder tummy -and clan
will have a new best friend:
Lottie, a pearl-wearing ot-
ter with a saucy attitude
who has a knack for playing
cricket.
The book was released
on Monday to Pooh lovers
everywhere. But it isn't ev-eryone's cup of tea.
Fans of the original Pooh
stories fear the sequel will
take precedence over the
first book, failing to capture
the magic of dripping honey
pots, bouncing Tiggers and
wild adventures.
A blogger even went as
far to say, "Why don't you
just trample on my child-
hood?"
But the new writer, David
Benedictus, doesn't hope to
reinvent or "trample" any
part of the series.
So he's adding a little
sass to the story. That never
hurt anyone. The childhood
charm of Piglet's stutters
and Eeyore's melancholy at-
titude will still remain, and
trample-free at that.
We suggest treasuring the
classic tales and reminiscing
on your childhood with the
new ones. And with that we
have just one thing left to
say: Ta-ta for now.

Letters to the Editor
Coverage of church excessive
I find the whole Dove World Out-
reach Center epidemic at this point to
be rather overblown and played out. It
is obvious that this church and its mem-
bers are simply attention whores. In a
seemingly slow news cycle, they have
been able to attract and maintain the
attention of media outlets such as the
Alligator. I am all for free speech, but
there comes a point where it is obvious
these people are being used for a sensa-
tionalist purpose, and in doing so, it al-
lows their message to spread, instead of
allowing their passions to simply burn
out and fade away into memory.
I urge the Alligator and other local
media outlets to take the logical ap-
proach and simply ignore these people,
because right now they are utilizing
your papers to their advantage. It is
simply a question: Is this the kind of
news people even want to hear about
any more, or have they simply had
enough of these idiots? Continuing to
publish their nonsense just helps keep
the hate spreading like cancer.

Free food shouldn't be stale
While a college student appreciates
anything complimentary, it certainlydoes not mean our standards of food
are any lower than the average person.
Last year, I remember walking on Tur-
lington Plaza after my morning class
and grabbing a free hot dog and soda,
graciously provided by a local church.
For a college student, anything that is
not Ramen noodles or mac 'n cheese
and is also free is as good as a New
York strip steak.
After my class this Monday, I dodged
my way through Turlington and spot-
ted the same familiar table. This time, I
received a plastic container filled with
beef jerky, tuna salad, a small can of
Pringles, applesauce, a bag of cookies
and a bottle of water. New York strip
steak? Heck, this was a filet mignon.
Then the expiration date on the water
bottle caught my eye: March 22, 2009?
Bottled March 22, 2007?
Suspicious, I opened the container
and checked the expiration dates of the
other items. Beef jerky, Aug. 19, 2009;
applesauce, Sept. 17, 2009; Pringles,
Sept. 2009; tuna salad -Oh, good -Feb.
2010.
Don't get me wrong, with the
amount of preservatives in the food, it
could probably preserve a dead body
better than formaldehyde and should
still taste fine. But somehow, I felt a lit-
tle gypped. Is expired free food better
than no food at all?

GALACTIC
Planet found in other solar system
By MEREDITH RUTLAND
Alligator Contributing Writer
Pluto may have been demoted from
its ranking as a planet, but a new one is
stepping up to take its place -albeit in
another solar system.
CoRoT-7b is the first rocky planet
found outside our solar system. It was
discovered by and named after the plan-
etary discovery mission CoRoT.
While the planet has a density similarto earth's, the similarities end there. The
planet has virtually no atmosphere, and
it doesn't rotate as it revolves around a
star as Earth does.
Without an atmosphere to release
heat, the side facing the star is molten and
the side away from the star is frozen.
The planet was discovered through
the transit method, which involves moni-
toring a star's brightness to see when
something passes in front of it. It was
confirmed as a planet in September.Jian Ge, a UF astronomy professor,
said that for a long time humans thought
our solar system was unique, but this
planet proves that other solar systems
are similar to ours, giving evidence for
the possibility that life exists outside our
atmosphere.
"[CoRoT-7b is] a key milestone [to]
eventually understand or detect habit-
able rocky planets around other stars,"
he said. "Of that, there will be life around
other stars."
Pak talked about trials of being Asian-American
ACCENT, from page 1
old, adding that being Asian-American
has helped her get on camera.
"We only had Connie Chung as an
option," Pak said.
She said during a college internship,
makeup artists would put large amounts
of makeup on her to make her face look
more angular and American.
"I looked like a crazy mime," Pak
said.
Pak also explained the hardships of
being Asian-American and working in
the entertainment industry."I think it's interesting that I can't au-
dition for a TV show that already has an
Asian," she said. "One is OK, but two is
an invasion."
On After Pak's speech,CampuS about 10 students asked
questions about Pak's fam-
ily life and the reaction to her success.
"After watching me on MTV, my
mother said to me, 'No Korean man will
want to marry you when you always
laugh with your mouth open,"' she said.
"Could you imagine me interviewing
Beyonce with my hand in front of my
mouth, giggling? But at the end of the
500 kits have been made
FLU KITS, from page 1
sembled so far, and if the flu kits are sold quickly the SHCC
may consider buying additional supplies to create more
packages to be sold this flu season and may have these kits
available yearly.
Lindsey said the SHCC is charging students the exact
amount to cover the costs of supplies included in the kits
and are not making a profit from the kits.
"We really want these kits to be just another outreach
effort to the kids like other programs like GatorWell avail-
able on campus," Lindsey said. "We are able to provide a
large amount of supplies in the kits for the price because we
bought the items in bulk, and UF is able to get a discount. So
it's cheaper to purchase the flu kit than to purchase all the
items separately."day, it doesn't matter what you're par-
ents think."
Pak said her favorite interviews were
with Jay-Z and a Hurricane Katrina vic-
tim who rescued others with his airboat.
Sophomore advertising major Angela
Gonzalez said she related to Pak because
she is half Spanish and half Italian.
"She's an awesome woman figure,"
Gonzalez said. Accent members did not
disclose the amount paid for Pak's ap-
pearance.

complaints were
heard at meeting
COMMISSION, from page 1
handing out free food could influence the vote.
"You can't look at fliers or pencils in the
same regard as an edible, tangible benefit."
Orange and Blue Party member Cain Nor-
ris said the offers of free food were not meant
to get votes but to encourage students to talk to
candidates.
The Commission heard two complaints
against the Progress Party. One complaint cen-
tered around the party's Twitter account not be-
ing registered on time and the
second involving a campaign
poster.
The commission gave the
Progress Party a public repri-
mand.
Parties also debated hip-
hop legends Biggie Smalls
Regalado and Tupac, who appeared on
a Progress Party poster with
the slogan "East Coast, West Coast Progress
Party brings em' all together."
Thompson said he saw the poster as a mis-
representation. Since both dead hip-hop leg-
ends were wearing Progress Party T-shirts,
Thompson said it could imply a false show of
support.
Progress Party President Dave Schneider
said the slogan began as an inside joke between
campaigners but also represents the Progress
Party message of helping to end the division
and strife of the Senate system.
By a unanimous vote, the election commis-
sion decided not to charge the Progress Party
with the violation.
Four complaints were filed against former
Orange and Blue Party Sen. Mark McShera for
handing out fake "I Voted" stickers. However,
since McShera was not present at Monday's
meeting, the complaints were dropped.2 /

UF FOOTBALL
Tebow asymptomatic but still not cleared for practice
By BOBBY CALLOVI
Alligator Writer
bcallovi@alligator org
Quarterback Tim Tebow still
has not been cleared to practice af-
ter suffering a concussion against
Kentucky on Sept. 26.
The senior has been getting
tested for symptoms everyday
since last Monday except for Sat-
urday, and things have been pro-
gressing for him.
"His headaches have been
gone for several days now," UF
coach Urban Meyer said. "He
looks good."
Meyer said he is still unsure
when Tebow will be able to prac-
tice, but if he can practice, he will
not participate in contact drills.
WHO'S NO. 3?: If Tebow cannot
play Saturday and backup John
Brantley gets hurt, things could
get interesting for the Gators.
Meyer said punter Chas Henry
has taken snaps at quarterback
this week. He expects freshman
Jordan Reed and a few others to
practice at quarterback in the case
Tebow has to sit out against LSU.
INJURIES: Wide receiver DeonteThompson was full speed during
Monday's practice after missing
the last two games with a ham-
string injury.
Meyer said he would know lat-
er in the week the status of defen-
sive tackle Lawrence Marsh, who
has been slowed by a sprained an-
kle for six weeks. Also, defensive
tackle Brandon Antwine is day-to-
day with a shoulder injury.
The Gators appear to finally be
getting over the illness that many
of the players had been battling
the last few weeks. Only freshman
Nick Alajajian still has symptoms.
TOUGH CALLS: Georgia's A.J. Green
and LSU's Charles Scott were both
called for unsportsmanlike con-
duct late in their game Saturday
following touchdowns.
Meyer expressed his feelings
about those type of calls Monday.
"I can't stand that when
that happens. I just think that's
wrong," Meyer said. "What I saw
on TV, a kid makes not a good
play, that was not a good play, it
was a great play like (Jake) Locker
for Washington (in the 2008 BYU-
Washington game).
"You make a play like that, and
it's a shame."Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
UF quarterback Tim Tebow has not practiced in the nine days since he suffered a concussion in the
Kentucky game. Tebow's status for Saturday's game at No. 4 LSU is still unknown.
Horror nights, crazed football
fans not for weak stomachs
If you're like me and things like,say, roller coasters and horror
movies terrify you to the point of
near panic, I would advise against a
trip to Universal's Halloween Horror
Nights.
I spent most of Saturday night
desperately clutching my girlfriend's
arm while my friends mercilessly
teased me.
Normally, this would have been
bad enough, but it's so much worse
when everyone knows you're afraid.
You see, my friends wanted to
make sure I got the "full experience."
This involved walking at an ungodly
slow pace through haunted housesMike

.HE WILL NEED TWO MORE WINS
TO MAKE IT TO THE MAIN DRAW.
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Writer
With injuries and inconsistency threatening
to limit the number of UF entrants into the ITA
All-American Tennis Championships to just
one, junior Johnny Hamui is trying to make
that two.
Hamui prevailed in a 6-4, 6-4 upset victory
over No. 55 Slah Mbarek of TCU in qualifying
on Monday. If Hamui can follow this up with
two more victories, he will have earned himself
a spot in the main draw alongside teammate
Alex Lacroix.
"Johnny practiced a whole lot this summer
but hasn't played a lot of matches. The first
couple of events were OK, but [Monday] was a
very good win," coach Andy Jackson said.
Carlos Cueto, the nation's No. 11 player,
likely would have earned a spot in the main
draw if he was not still recovering from lin-gering tendonitis. Also dealing with injury is
No. 105 Joey Burkhardt, who in all likelihood
would have had a shot at making the tourna-
ment through the qualifying draw if not for the
broken foot he sustained during the summer.
"Both of them are back on the practice court
and looking good," Jackson said.
The only player aside from Hamui who par-
ticipated in the qualifying draw
was senior Antoine Benneteau,
who lost 6-3,6-4 to Texas A&M's
Alexey Grigorov. This loss drops
Men s Benneteau to 1-3 on the season.
This lack of production mayTen nis partly be attributed to an offsea-
son hernia surgery that kept him
off the court for an extended period.
"It's only a matter of time until he is back
into form," Jackson said.
Hamui will be returning to action this after-
noon against Marcel Thiemann of Ole Miss.
"Johnny has some rhythm now after win-
ning doubles at FSU and winning today, and
should continue to improve his game," Jackson
said.

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 6, 2009 U ALLIGATOR, 15
Tim Tebow (22 Pts) 170.31 passer rating, 643 yards, 64.7
completion percentage, 6 TD, INT, 271 rushing yards, 4.9 ypc, 5 TD
A bye week and a concussion weren't enough to
keep Tebow off the top of our Heisman Watch.
The senior is really the only dual-threat QB on our top
5. While his passing numbers aren't as impressive as some of the
other contenders, he has run the ball well and only thrown one
interception. It doesn't hurt that Florida is undefeated and the No.
1-ranked team in the nation.
Colt McCoy (13) 150.96 passer rating, 1,145 yards, 71
completion percentage, 9 TD, 5 INT, 61 rushing yards, 2.2 ypc, TD
Despite his five interceptions, our panel voted
Colt "My Boy" McCoy second in the inaugural
alligatorSports Heisman watch. Texas is also
undefeated and the No. 2 team in the nation,
which helps the senior's case. Only Jacory Harris has less total
touchdowns among the quarterbacks who received a vote, and no
one who received a vote has a lower passer rating than McCoy.
Perhaps a little bit of projection over performance from the panel,
but McCoy is likely to strengthen his case as the season goes on.
Tony Pike (10) 159.95 passer rating, 1,493 yards, 66.7
completion percentage, 13 TD, 3 INT, 41 rushing yards, 2.9 ypc, 2 TD
Pike has had a tremendous start to the season
.for Cincinnati and led his team to wins over
Rutgers and Oregon State in the early going. No
one on our list has more total touchdowns than Pike. The redshirt
senior has developed a great rapport with wide receiver Mardy
Gilyard, who has hauled in seven touchdown catches already.
Jimmy Clausen (9) 179.25 passer rating, 1,544 yards,
67.6 completion percentage, 12 TD, 2 INT, -45 rushing yards, -2 ypc
Truth be told, Clausen has the best raw numbers
of any quarterback in the nation to this point. The
junior is hurt by an early season loss to Michigan
as every other player on this top 5 list plays for an
undefeated team. If the Irish continue to win, Clausen could scoot
up our rankings, but if they drop a couple more games, he could
fall off entirely.
Kellen Moore (5) 175.28 passer rating, 1,217 yards, 69.7
completion percentage, 13 TD, 2 INT, -12 rushing yards, -1.1 ypc
Moore is the only sophomore to make
the top 5 and one of only three to receive a vote,
along with Harris and Gabbert. Moore is second in
the nation in passer rating and tied for third in touchdown passes.
His Broncos are undefeated, and Moore has arguably logged
the best win so far out of anyone on the top 5 as Boise State took
down No. 13 Oregon at home to open the season.

able to have insightful sports con-
versation with a guy wearing face
paint and carrying several neon
glow sticks while I waited in line
for the bathroom.
I made friends with a Florida
State fan that looked nearly as pale
as I did explaining the Seminoles
loss to Boston College.
He said that he was "proud"
of how the team played and that
they "almost pulled it out." I was
appalled. What has happened to
FSU? A few years ago that kind of
talk would have been heresy.
I want to give Seminole fans the
same advice my friend Ryan gave
me as I walked out of something
called The Spawning in a cold
sweat: "You just got to keep that
bottled up, man."
We eventually ended up at
some kind of faux-Irish pub in
time to catch the last few minutes
of Miami's win over Oklahoma.
A bartender named Patrick,who I suspect wasn't actually
Irish, poured drinks for some of
the girls in our group, and I made
small talk with two guys wearing
Miami jerseys -one of which had
whiskers painted on his face.
If you have ever come in con-
tact with Hurricanes fans, I'm sure
you've had nearly the same con-
versation I did.
Apparently "The U" is back (or
as the one painted like a kitten in-
formed me, had never left). It turns
out that Jacory Harris may just be
some kind of deity, and it's some-
how appropriate to flash "The U"
hand gesture like a gang sign for
as long as you deem permissible
following a big win.
I like Miami. I like Harris. But
if these are the kind of people that
are being let back out into the
world because the Hurricanes are
good again, I think we were all
better of when they were missing
bowl games.
As ridiculous as my two friends
from southern Florida may seem,
they were by no means the mostmisguided college football fans I
came across.
That award goes to the UCF
fan that was so overwhelmed by
the joy of beating Memphis that
he was buying $6 blood-bag Jell-O
shots for complete strangers.
I'm from Orlando. I want to see
the Knights do well, but UCF fans
running euphorically in the streets
after beating Memphis is almost
as bad of an idea as spending $5
a ball to play some rigged carnival
game after you've put away a few
beers in an attempt to settle your
fears about being practically sur-
rounded by things that scare the
crap out of you.
After this weekend, I'm con-
vinced that the mix of alcohol,
ominous music and football some-
how leads fans to the outer most
reaches of rationalization and san-
ity.
If you know someone that
could be considered obnoxious,
loud or stupid, I suggest keeping
some, or all, of these things away
from them in the coming weeks.
