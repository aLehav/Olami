The colleges of Nursing and Business Ad-
ministration released their 10-percent budget-
cut proposals on Wednesday.
The nursing college’s proposal includes no 
layoffs, while the business college’s propos-al includes five — one faculty member who would not be eligible for tenure and four staff members.
The nursing college will not cut its under-
graduate program, but it might reduce un-dergraduate enrollment over time because of possible cuts to temporary faculty, said college 
spokeswoman Tracy Wright.
Under its proposal, the college would cut 
$813,000, mainly by eliminating eight positions 
that will be vacant. Seven of those are profes-sorships and one is a staff position in the alum-ni office. Also, a vacant, full-time librarian posi-
tion will become a half-time position.
These changes will save about $609,000.The college would also cut funding for tem-
porary faculty and student assistants by about 
$119,000, Wright said. Five temporary faculty positions and an unknown number of student assistants could be eliminated.
The college would also stop paying its por-
tion of funds to the Interdisciplinary Fam-ily Health program, a program for beginning 
health science students, which would save 
$25,000.
The remainder, $61,000, would be saved by 
eliminating the reimbursements clinical faculty receive for work-related cell phone use and by 
reducing travel for faculty, administrators and Colleges reveal cuts
� MEETINGS WILL CONCLUDE TODAY.

The Board of Governors will conclude its 
two-day set of meetings in Tallahassee today 
after discussing on Wednesday the impact Florida’s 11 public universities have on the state’s economy. 
Yesterday’s two-hour long morning meet-
ing was comprised of six presentations high-lighting the role of the universities’ research and faculty in the state’s economy.
“Each institution has a large economic im-
pact on its community,” wrote Bill Edmonds, the board’s spokesman, in an e-mail.
Edmonds said a key point of the presenta-
tions marked Florida’s public university sys-tem as the gateway to Florida’s future, which he said relies on furthering a knowledge econ-omy.
This means having innovative research 
ideas that can be brought to the marketplace, Edmonds said later in a phone interview.  
“The key, underlying message is this: Our 
faculty brings in more than $1 billion 
(a year) in federal 
and private research 
awards,” Edmonds wrote, adding commer-cialization of finished research efforts will 
benefit the economy. 
He estimated the amount of grant money 
UF receives a year is close to half of that $1 
billion. 
A presentation given during the meet-
ing by David Day, director of UF’s Office of 
Technology Licensing, showed UF leads the state in technology transfer, which deals with 
commercializing the ideas and developments 
made in research labs, according to Edmonds.UF ADMINISTRATION

No shoes, no shirt, no pants,

This is the deal for nudists 
headed to the 14th Nude College Greek Athletic Meet on Saturday 
at the Tallahassee Naturally nud-ist club in Monticello, near Talla-hassee.
“It’s a fun thing, to get the feel 
of being nude,” said Paul Lev-valley, a spokesman of the event. “You don’t have to be a jock.”                              A majority of those attending 
will probably be first-time nudists, 
he said.
Both athletes 
and non-athletes will compete in games based on the ancient 
Greek Olympics, including jav-elin throw, discus, long jump and 200-yard dash.
The Olympics will begin at 10 
a.m. with registration and prac-tice followed by a demonstration of ancient competition methods at 11 a.m.  At 1 p.m., competitions will begin. Entry classifications are male athletes, male non-ath-
letes, female athletes and female 
non-athletes. Impromptu games

Officials find 2.5 pounds of pot on highschoolers
Officials found a gun and 2.5 pounds of marijuana 
in the backpacks of three Eastside High School stu-
dents Tuesday.
The school’s administration got a tip that there 
would be a drug deal on campus and asked school resource deputies to help track down Fabian Hatch-er, 16, Alphonso Wells Jr., 16 and Edward Warren, 17, Alachua County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Art Forgey said.
Officials found marijuana in all three of their back-
packs, adding up to about 2.5 pounds, Forgey said.Forgey said it is rare to find that much marijuana 
on anyone, let alone three teenagers at a high school.
Small plastic bags that Forgey said are typically 
used to package and sell marijuana were also found.
While searching Warren’s backpack, officials 
found an unloaded .22-caliber handgun, Forgey said.
All three were arrested and charged with pos-
session of marijuana with intent to distribute within 1,000 feet of a school.
Warren was also charged with possession of a 
firearm on school property.

Amid accusations of plagiarism, the 
North Central Florida Society of Profession-
al Journalists Professional Chapter decided 
Wednesday to rescind awards given to the 
former editor of Ocala Magazine.
The editor, Heather Lee, was fired Sun-
day after allegations of widespread plagia-rism, the Ocala Star-Banner reported. 
“This was a person I put a great deal 
of responsibility and trust in,” said Linda Marks, publisher of the magazine, accord-ing to the Star-Banner. 
Marks could not be reached for com-
ment.
Ten awards given to Ocala Magazine 
in 2007 and 2008 were revoked, said Ana-Klara Anderson, president of the North Central Florida Society of Professional Jour-nalists.  The local chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists met in Gainesville to discuss whether Lee should be allowed 
to keep her awards.
These constitute “any award involving 
writing that was submitted by Ocala Maga-
zine with Heather Lee’s byline or in which Heather Lee played a significant editorial role,” Anderson said.
“We run this awards program to award 
honest, fair, accurate journalism,” Ander-son said. “We really, as a chapter, had no 
other option than to rescind these awards 
because we found consistent and extensive use of plagiarism over the course of several years.”
The story of Lee’s four years of plagia-
rism surfaced last week when two enve-lopes, each containing twenty examples of Lee’s plagiarism, were sent anonymously to the Star-Banner and WCJB TV-20.
These articles contained material pla-giarized from many media outlets, includ-
ing The Wall Street Journal, Entertainment 
Weekly and O, The Oprah Magazine, the Star-Banner reported.
In one example from Ocala Magazine in 
September 2006, Lee wrote that “meat lust is not pretty and I suspect it grips all true carnivores,” TV-20 reported.
Her words were almost identical to a 
June 2006 article written by Robb Walsh of 
The Houston Press, according to the TV-20 
investigation.
“Meat lust is not pretty,” Walsh wrote. 
“But I suspect it grips all true carnivores.”
In some cases, articles contained four 
cases  of plagiarism, said Norman P. Lewis, an assistant professor of journalism at UF.
“It’s pretty unusual to have multiple 
sources for a plagiarism piece,” said Lewis, whose research specialty is plagiarism.
Of the 85 to 100 examples of plagiarism 
he has studied closely, Lee’s are some of the worst, Lewis said. 
“It’s certainly one of the more serious 
cases I’ve ever encountered,” Lewis said.  
To prevent future dishonesty, Marks 
told the Star-Banner that she had installed “Check for Plagiarism” software.
The important thing is that Ocala Maga-
zine works to regain its readers’ trust, Lewis said.
In its next issue, the magazine should 
discuss and correct all of Lee’s plagiarism. It should also amend the online archive, he said. LOCAL

Animal Activists of Alachua is hosting 
its eighth annual VegFest from 11 a.m. to 
2 p.m. on the Plaza of the Americas. 
Tommasina Miller, a UF English senior 
and the club’s president, said the festival 
will provide enough free vegan-friendly 
food for up to 1,000 people, her goal for 
the festival’s attendance.
“We want to reach out to people who 
have never tried vegetarian or vegan 
foods and educate them about the cruelty 
animals in factory farms undergo,” Miller 
said.
The festival will also feature Robert Cheeke, an award-winning vegan body 
builder, who will speak about body build-ing and where vegetarians and vegans get their protein.
Miller said there will be “empathy sta-
tions,” which are areas designed to help 
people envision the lives of animals in factory farms.
For the first time, the 
group will host a donation drive for Rooterville, a local 
pig sanctuary, and Jungle Friends, a local primate sanctuary. Miller said there will be prizes for those who donate the most produce, money or time, and 100 gift cards to local restaurants will be handed out randomly.VegFest offers free food
The 43rd Street Deli added its 13th 
Street location to a growing list of busi-
nesses closing in Gainesville, but the res-taurant isn’t suffering the same plight as those buckling under financial strain.
Richard Ross, former general man-
ager of the 13th Street location and cur-rent manager of the original deli on 43rd Street, said the chain’s owner sold the building to CVS because it was in disre-pair and was losing money from mainte-nance—not lack of business.
“(CVS) just offered a decent amount 
for the location,” he said. 
According to Ross, three-quarters of 
the employees from the closed restau-rant transferred to the 43rd Street or Williston Road locations. The owner is looking for a spot to build a third loca-tion. Ross said the restaurant is able to stay open because of the loyalty of its regular customers.
The remaining restaurants will incor-
porate the old location’s vegetarian and vegan dishes to accommodate the 13th Street Deli’s customers.
“We have to tighten up a little bit, 
but we can pay the bills,” he said. “As long as you can pay the bills right now, you’re doing well.”

Wright said the college’s 2007-2008 state-funded budget 
was about $12.9 million. The college received a cut of about 
$500,000 this year, according to Alligator archives.
The business college’s $2.3 million proposal includes five 
potential layoffs.
The layoffs would be in the Bureau of Economic & Busi-
ness Research, which would be cut by about $407,000.
Only about $2.1 million of the total cut has been specified, 
however, said Andy McCollough, senior associate dean of the 
college.
The bulk of the money, about $1.4 million, in the specified portion of the proposal will be recouped by replacing state 
funds with other money, including donations to the college through the UF Foundation and funds from programs that 
generate their own revenue, like online degree programs.
About $255,000 will be saved by 
reclaiming unused benefits after re-tirements and resignations and by 
spending less on technology, which could mean fewer equipment replace-
ments and less technical support, UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said.
All colleges and administrative units were asked to submit 
10-percent budget cut proposals, which are due by April 1, in anticipation of a possible university-wide budget cut of $72 
million to $75 million in 2009-2010.Business proposes 5 layoffs, none for nursing
Presentations were also given on the 
development of the University of Cen-
tral Florida’s new medical school and reducing Florida’s economic reliance on agriculture, tourism and housing, moving the focus to  research and tech-nology.
“The universities are economic en-gines of this new economy,” Edmonds wrote. 
While Florida’s 11 universities cur-
rently house about 300,000 students and about 63,000 employees, Edmonds said growth must continue. 
“We are currently, in fact, an under-
educated state,” he wrote. “Florida must catch up if we are to be a player, 
not just a spectator.”

Today’s question: Are you excited about the possibilties of miracle fruit?

ColumnAmazin’ Fruit 
A growing phenomenon 
sweeping the nation promises to trick your 
taste buds into thinking sour treats have magically turned 
sweet – all with one little 
“miracle fruit.”
Scientifically known as 
“Synsepalum dulcificum,” the miraculous wonder takes effect by first chewing the fruit and then rubbing the pulp against the tongue.
For up to a half hour, your 
taste buds become altered, in-spiring foodies everywhere to host soirées in which guests gorge on all things sour – completely convinced that they are sweet.
These aren’t your daddy’s 
tripping parties.
While the fruit may be in-
digenous to West Africa, one of the leading researchers on the subject calls the University of Florida’s Center for Taste and Smell home. According to an article on CNN.com, Dr. Linda Bartoshuk has studied miracle fruit since the ‘70s while working in U.S. mili-tary labs.
When the Editorial Board 
first heard word about mir-
acle fruit, we all collectively 
agreed that we had to get our hands on this too-good-to-be-true nectar of the gods.
Just think, we could stuff 
our faces with lemons and limes to our hearts’ content while tricking our taste buds into believing we downed 
more sugar than Fat Albert 
coming off a 48-hour juice fast let loose in Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory. Sadly, Bar-toshuk advises to take caution when using miracle fruit as a way to lose weight, claiming that artificial sweeteners fail to actually help people drop 
pounds.
While we’ll stick to our 
gallon jugs of water and PB&J 
diet, don’t think we didn’t al-ready place an order to dance with the devil known as mir-acle fruit.While economic uncertainty runs rampant in north 
Central Florida, one major corporation’s consolida-
tion of offices will soon heat up an otherwise stag-
nant Gainesville job market.
In an announcement made on Wednesday, Enterprise 
Rent-A-Car revealed plans to open up a regional call center in 
June at the site of an old Winn-Dixie – bringing 200 new jobs to the area. What makes the revelation even more compelling is 
the fact that the positions will offer living wages along with a 
wide array of benefits. If hired, new employees stand to make between $11 to $18 an hour while also receiving medical, 
401(k) and profit-sharing – a far cry from the “fringe benefits” 
of working at Checker’s.
Hell, who wants to eat their greasy offerings sober any-
way?
The Editorial Board is pleased that job growth has found 
its way to Gainesville, especially during a time in which hous-
ing foreclosures are on the rise and credit remains nonexistent. 
While 200 new positions will make but a small dent in a more widespread issue, we can only hope Enterprise’s move will 
spur increased growth in the region. Even though the news of 
career opportunities for the under- and unemployed brings us great joy, we can’t help but think what could’ve been. 
Our inner foodie shed a tear when we learned news that 
talks were in place for a Whole Foods Market to move into the location soon to be occupied by Enterprise.
Just a hunch, but we doubt the rental car company will be 
selling miso-glazed catfish with baby bok choy.
Somewhere, the owners of The Fresh Market are having 
the last laugh.
People have spent the past few days filling this paper 
with complaints about the budget cuts. Admittedly, the cuts are controversial and probably imperfect, 
but you have to make sacrifices when there’s no money available. For those of us who are already here, there’s not much to do other than accept it.
The university has another problem, though. With dis-
emboweled departments, pitiful course offerings and ris-ing tuition, how does it attract high-quality students?
The answer – merit-based scholarships – has become a 
four-letter word among social-justice-craving academics.
Need-based aid has a solid place at all universities and 
helps students, who may not otherwise be able to attend, get the education they deserve. Unfortunately, it usually does nothing to attract the most qualified students – the students who often go on to become scholarship winners, 
public leaders and wealthy alumni donors who bring 
prestige to the university. Even those highly qualified students who are eligible for ample need-based aid may receive better merit-based offers elsewhere.
UF got by for a long time by offering those quality stu-
dents the best education in the state at minimal cost. But 
as the quality of education goes down and cost goes up 
in the wake of budget cuts, UF must expand merit-based aid.
UF’s current merit aid programs include the National 
Merit Scholarship – a relatively insignificant $1,000 per 
year to students who performed well on the PSAT – the 
John V. Lombardi Scholarship and Davis United World College Scholars Program, both incredibly selective pro-grams that can only give generous scholarships to eight 
individuals a year.
On the other end of the spectrum, the Florida Oppor-tunity Scholarship Program does 
a better job of meeting students’ needs. This is awarded to nearly 
300 students every year. While 
it has produced some of the fin-est leaders on campus, it has also produced its fair share of students 
who, unfortunately, weren’t ready 
for college.
The Opportunity Scholarship 
gives many students a chance in college, but the lack of any notable academic qualifications means that some of 
the $3.6 million in the program will inevitably be lost on 
students who can’t handle UF.
I propose that UF adopts a program to single out its 
most holistically qualified freshmen applicants and offer 
them merit scholarship along with their admission, re-
gardless of their family income. This will encourage the best applicants to come here rather than similar schools who might give them more incentives. They can fund it by eliminating national merit scholarships (which is based on one silly test) and by partially scaling back need-based 
programs or adding merit elements to the program that 
will help ensure that the money is well spent.
It’s wildly popular in academia to “fight the good fight” 
for the oppressed and offer them need-based scholarships, but when education quality is declining and costs are ris-
ing, UF needs to remember its reputation as an institution. 
It needs to attract the best and brightest regardless of how poor or rich they are, and the easiest and most cost effec-tive way to do this is through merit scholarships.

The budget cut proposal presented by 
CLAS last week targeted the Depart-ment of Religion as one of the pro-
grams set for a substantial cut, threatening its future as a viable program. Founded in 
1946, the Department of Religion at UF is an 
undeniably strong program dedicated and essential to the ideals of a liberal arts educa-tion.
The academic study of religion is often 
misconceived as religious teaching that has no place in public education  — hardly the 
case. To cut the department that allows us 
to explore and discuss religion as a deep 
and permeating part of human discourse is to cripple our understanding of the various 
ways people understand their relationship with the world. It is undeniable that religion shapes and informs political discourse, mili-tary conflict, environmental practices, inno-
vations in the sciences, the arts — basically 
every facet of human life.
Our distinguished faculty engage their 
students in stimulating and rich discussions concerning issues of diversity, encounter conflict, globalization, ecology, etc. Faculty and students are connected with a variety of interdisciplinary programs, including the School of Natural Resources and Environ-
ment, Latin American Studies, Jewish Stud-ies, African Stud-
ies, the Centers for Women Studies and Gender Research, 
Spirituality and Health, the School of Music 
and the Harn Museum of Art. These connec-
tions are reflective of not only the depart-ment’s commitment to the goals of higher education, but also its commitment to de-velop in individuals the skills necessary to critically assess the significant and pervasive role of religion in global society.
As scholars of religion, we understand 
the importance of a holistic approach in 
higher education, an ideal that CLAS seeks to uphold and celebrate. CLAS’ mission 
statement is “to lead the academic quest to understand our place in the universe, and to help shape our society and environment.” Are we able to uphold this mission while si-
multaneously allowing for strong programs 
and departments that exemplify these ideals to be reduced substantially and irrevers-ibly? 
We need to reconsider what exactly our 
education means to us and what our diplo-mas from UF will come to represent.

Academic Religious Studies. They are a group of

 It’s not as bad as you think. With just about one month of school left, 
summer is just a few finals away, and while you can’t stop thinking about your Gainesville getaway, don’t lose your focus just yet. You’ll thank us in 
about 30 days. 
 1.It’s tempting to skip out on your 8:30 a.m. lecture, but go to class. It’s 
early, your coffee machine is probably broken by now and you may not even know where your alarm clock is (check under the bed), but you might actually learn something — like don’t take morning classes. 
 2.For those who want to be productive this summer or just need some-
thing to spruce up a wimpy resume, it’s not too late to find a summer job or internship. Check local listings or swing by the Career Resource Center in the Reitz Union, ASAP.
3.Maybe it’s a little bit late to throw yourself into a student organization, 
but there’s never a shortage of campus activities. Consult the UF calen-
dar and get back in touch with The Gator Nation.

The Presets (Kim Moyes, drums, and 
Julian Hamilton, vox/keys) will perform at Common Grounds with The Golden Filter on Sunday at 6 p.m.Also, Matt and Kim will play at Common Grounds on Tuesday at 9 p.m. Photo courtesy of The Presets09:Thursday
March 26, 2009Matt Johnson is hoping the walls will get 
ripped down at Common Grounds on Tuesday. 
“Essentially, I just hope to have a crazy dance 
party,” the 26-year-old keyboardist and vocalist 
of Matt and Kim said. “That’s all I want. That’s all 
I want in life.”
Doors will open at 9 p.m., and tickets are $10. 
If there is one thing Johnson is proud of, it is 
the Brooklyn-based duo’s reputation to have a crowd that likes to get physical.
“You go to a show, and people just like stare 
at their feet,” Johnson said. “To be on stage and to have people dancing gets me and Kim much more excited. We definitely don’t put on the too-
cool-for-school, cheesy look.” 
And aside from the dance party, Johnson said 
that fans can expect a show that is a little more 
high-tech. 
“We are really bringing up our 2009 game,” he 
said. “We have a little more multimedia aspect.”
Johnson said Matt and Kim are purposely re-
turning to Common Grounds.
“It’s a great venue, and we have some friends 
that work there,” he said. “We are honored to be back. The shows we’ve done in Gainesville have just been fun, straight-up.”
This show will also feature the bands new al-
bum “The Grand,” which was recorded in John-son’s childhood bedroom that was still covered with skateboarding posters and show fliers.
“The Grand” has been described to take Matt 
and Kim’s songs and lyrics to the next level. 
“As bizarre as it sounds, we kind of let the song 
write itself lyrically with a broad horizon that can mean different things to people,” he said.
What may even be more bizarre, is Matt and 
Kim balance a work and personal relationship to-gether. They have been dating since fall of 2002 and started working together in 2004. 
“We spend so much time together, we should 
hate each other by now, but we get along pretty 
well.”THURSDAY, MARCH 26, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 9
coming up
It has been a crazy couple of years for the dynamic duo 
The Presets. 
This past year alone, they have exploded onto Aus-
tralia’s pop scene winning six ARIA awards, which are 
equivalent to the Grammys. On top of that, their sopho-
more album, “Apocalypso,” went triple platinum in Aus-
tralia.
The Presets will perform at Common Grounds along 
with The Golden Filter on Sunday. Tickets are $12 in ad-vance and $14 the day of the show. Doors open at 6 p.m. 
Julian Hamilton, a half of the electronic-funk pair, said 
he knows it won’t be a boring night in a college town.
“We want to just stamp out our authority on the situa-
tion,” Hamilton said. “Take control of the room and indoc-
trinate the people with our music.”
While their MySpace page describes their sound as a 
mix of industrial, psychedelic and techno, Hamilton said 
he thinks it’s atypical for musicians to describe them-selves. 
“I found it easier if we leave it to you guys to describe 
it for us,” he said. 
Aside from their funky sound, The Presets are also 
known for their live performances, especially when it 
comes to their audience interaction. 
“We jump around on stage, I guess, but really it’s the 
audience that should be dancing,” Hamilton said. “Lots of 
the dancing should be going on in the crowd, and if it isn’t, then that definitely is a problem.”
If there is one thing they are looking forward to in 
America, it’s the food. Hamilton said they really enjoy the local restaurants in each city. They especially love Tex-Mex.
After the tour in America wraps up, the duo will head 
back to Australia to finish touring on the “Apocalypso” album. They hope to head back in the studio in July or August.Presets to perform Indie duo tours with new album

FASHION on the avenue
 The stereotype is that boys roll out of bed and into their days, giving little thought to what they wear. 
But stylish guys show this isn’t true, and why should it be? Style is asexual, and regardless of gender or sexual 
orientation, everyone reaps the benefits of a well-coordinated, gasp-inspiring look.  Stand out among the masses 
by taking a cue from these dapper chaps. 
Preppy Chic
This spring the trend is all about clean lines, neutral colors and structured looks.
Clarence Anthony Jr., 20, sociology student
Wearing: Lacoste boat shoes, cream Dockers and a vintage 
button-down passed down from his dad. Style Icon: LeBron James, he’s able to wear high fashion even at a game. I just saw him at an All-Star game wearing a Burberry trench coat. Why fashion is relevant for men: In college, it is our job to present ourselves like young men, not only for all the women on campus, but also for ourselves.
The New Bohemian
The boho look still has the same relaxed, hippy vibe, minus the 
Birkenstocks and dreadlocks.
John Welch, 18, English student
Wearing: Urban Outfitters stone-washed jeans and scarf and 
Vans slip-on skate shoes. Style influence: My dad was kind of a hippie and exposed to a lot of folky stuff. If I could, I would go in a time machine and buy everything from the ‘60s. I associate with that aesthetic more. Fashion must: I’m OCD about fit. I look silly if I wear baggy jeans. 
Hipster mod
This style is all about mixing modern slim-cut threads with 
roughed-up vintage pieces.
Barry Bernard, 24, American Apparel associate
Wearing: Cheap Monday skinny jeans, vintage penny loafers and plaid button-down. Style icon: The Rat Pack, everything they wore was perfectly tailored and cool. Fashion advice: Guys think it’s too feminine to be into looks, but I think everybody should try to look their best. Find the best pieces to compliment your shape and mood.

Two years ago, when linebacker Brandon Siler and safety 
Reggie Nelson decided to leave early for the NFL, UF coach 
Urban Meyer remembers seeing “red flags.”
Those were the first signs that an immature and border-
line-selfish team was going to run into Ben Hill Griffin Stadi-
um later that fall. And, unfortunately for the Gators, Meyer 
and his coaching staff were right. 
Now, the team finds itself in the same situation: UF is 
coming off a national championship. The Gators don’t see Percy Harvin, Cornelius Ingram, Phil Trautwein or Louis Murphy on the offensive depth chart anymore. And there’s that scary thought of complacency.
Except now, Meyer isn’t seeing red flags. He’s seeing 
sweat. And lots of it. 
It’s sweat that is showing the Gators, in the coaches’ and 
players’ opinions, aren’t in danger of having another let-down season like they did two years ago.
“In ’07 you had a bunch of young, immature football 
players that were not ready to play. But that’s not the case here,” Meyer said. “We’re a good program now. We weren’t then. We were a good team.”
It also helps when you have a Heisman-winning quar-
terback and All-Southeastern Conference linebacker coming 
back. While losing Harvin to the NFL early hurts, it wasn’t 
as bad as it could have been. So when Tim Tebow and Bran-don Spikes came back for their senior years, it became official that it wouldn’t be hard for the Gators to find their leaders for 2009.
“Basically the whole team’s back,” junior linebacker Ryan 
Stamper said. “That’s what’s going to be the difference this year, the leadership. Guys are just hungry to come out here and do it again.”UF FOOTBALLMature defending champs fending off complacency

� TIM TEBOW IS TRYING OUT A PRO-
STYLE OFFENSE IN PRACTICE. 
By MIKE DiFERDINANDO
Alligator Staff Writer
mdiferdinando@alligator.org
Tim Tebow found himself in an unfamil-
iar position when the Gators opened practice 
Wednesday. The Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback took snaps from under center dur-ing the team’s first workout of the spring.
“I think we’re going to work on some under-
center packages and implement a little bit of that into our game plan,” Tebow said.
Because Tebow takes nearly all of his snaps 
from the shotgun formation in UF’s spread of-fense, NFL scouts have questioned his ability to adjust to a traditional pro-style formation.
New quarterbacks coach Scot Loeffler is do-
ing his best to change that.
“I keep hearing that the NFL is so much dif-
ferent than college, so we’re trying to help him get more comfortable,” Urban Meyer said.
Loeffler, a longtime assistant at Michigan, is credited with the development of NFL quarter-backs Chad Henne, Tom Brady and Brian Gri-ese. Meyer said he also plans to incorporate a no-huddle offense this spring. 
SPIKES ON STAYING: For the first time since he made the decision, Brandon Spikes talked publicly about his choice to forgo the NFL 
draft and come back to UF for his senior season.
“(I was) a kid, 21 years old, 
and had a chance to make it to 
the big leagues and didn’t take it. You think about getting hurt or what else you could accom-
plish,” Spikes said. “But I felt like coming back to school would benefit me more.”
THE PROMISE:  Meyer said it was his decision to 
put up a plaque on the wall of the team’s new 
football complex with the text from Tebow’s 
speech after UF’s loss to Mississippi last sea-
son. Meyer said he didn’t think there was any 
reason to wait until the junior had graduated.
“We’re not interested in 10 years from now,” 
Meyer said. “It was a speech that I think every-
one in Gator Nation deserves a chance to see.”QB takes snaps under center
They couldn’t have planned it any better if they tried.
With the UF men’s and 
women’s basketball teams ending their seasons with losses in their 
respective postseason tournaments 
Tuesday night, the Gators sports world had a temporary void.
But Wednesday, right on cue, 
about 16 hours later, that void was filled by spring football practice starting up again.
Let’s not kid ourselves: Base-
ball, softball, gymnastics and all 
the smaller sports are definitely 
important to this school. But noth-ing compares to the madness of football, a madness Gainesville has been without since early January.
Finally. It’s been a rough three 
months without any on-the-field football news to discuss, but we’re going to begin to get answers to some of the important questions 
about the UF football team.
Will the 
Gators be able to de-fend their na-tional cham-p i o n s h i p ? How amaz-ing is this de-fense going 
to be with all 11 starters returning? Who will replace Percy Harvin and Louis Murphy in the wide receiv-er spots? Will Emmanuel Moody ever touch the ball in the first half again? Football back just in time

As entertaining as it has been to follow the explosive 
feud between Urban Meyer and Lane Kiffin, debate the 
insanity of the Tim Tebow “Promise” being etched into a plaque outside the football stadium and track the blazing speed of UF athletes at NFL Pro Scout Day, it’s great to 
finally see football players, well, play football.
Sure, the pads are barely on, new players are getting 
adjusted and there’s never any contact on the quarter-
back, but at least fans and the media get to see what this football team is shaping out to be.
What excitement did the first day of spring practice 
hold? 
Well, there were the punt-blocking drills where an 
overzealous Desmond Parks — a freshman tight end 
whose name you’ll know soon enough — ran straight 
into the coach holding the ball.
The offense and defense faced off in some seven-on-
seven drills as usual, and everyone’s heart rate raised when Brandon Spikes went in for a tackle or Tebow threw a deep pass.
There was an ESPN presence on the practice field — 
the Worldwide Leader had a video camera and a giant boom microphone — and about three times as many 
cameras and notepads as there were during the season. 
The scene Wednesday was one of resounding joy from 
the fans. They congregated inside the practice field gates 
and piled up outside practice afterward to get players — especially Tebow — to sign whatever they brought with them. 
When I emerged from the throng of reporters after-
ward and had to part the sea of fans outside the gate, I felt like an athlete running through a line of teammates 
during player introductions.
That’s what spring practice is all about. It’s a time of 
hope for the fans and a time of new beginnings for the 
players. It’s a time when March starts to feel like Au-gust, and all you can dream of is that first kickoff against Charleston Southern.
For now, we’ll be stuck with the spring game on April 
18, the culmination of all the hubbub we witnessed to-day.
Wednesday was the beginning of what could easily be 
another championship year for the Gators, another year that goes down in the record books and a year that ce-ments Tim Tebow’s legacy as the greatest college football player of all time.
I’m excited to see what happens. It’s just a shame I 
won’t be here in the fall to see how it all works out.
Having Tebow helps players stay 
hungry.
“It’s having veteran leaders out 
here that aren’t going to let our team 
be complacent,” Tebow said on why 
this season will be different from 
2007.
That’s a big step up from that year 
when players “didn’t take it serious” and were “playing around” in games and practice, Stamper said.Junior receiver David Nelson 
bluntly stated that a letdown is “not going to happen” this year. Meyer said several times last season that he 
hasn’t had this level of leadership from a 
team at UF before.
“There’s a lot 
of guys that went 
through that year and went through 
that process of going from a national championship to losing a bowl,” Nelson said. “We know what we did wrong. It’s up to us to fix those prob-lems. We felt like we had already ar-rived. We didn’t feel like we needed to come in to practice and give it a whole 100 percent effort because we just won a national championship.”
That’s not to say Meyer is going to 
make this off-season easy on them.
“The only way I know how to do 
it is to make it the hardest summer they’ve gone through in their lives,” Meyer said. “Just make it real hard so they won’t have time to be com-placent.” Meyer vows team’s hardest summer aheadEVAN , from page 18■ THE TEAM FINISHED A SEASON-BEST THIRD 
IN THE BYU DIXIE CLASSIC.
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Writer
In 2008, the Gators had national-championship aspi-
rations while winning the Southeastern Conference, but 
after the season, the team, which was full of seniors, was dismantled.
In stepped the freshmen, and up the ranks went the 
sophomores.
It was supposed to take time for the No. 26 UF wom-
en’s golf team to return to national prominence.
But this week in St. George, Utah, something unex-
pected happened.
After traveling across the country to play on a course 
they had not seen before, the team finished Wednesday’s final round of the BYU Dixie Classic in third place, their best finish of the spring season.
“This Florida women’s golf team is back on the map,” 
freshman Andrea Watts said.
The Gators shot a team score of 15 over par Wednes-
day, pushing their score to 51 over par for the week, nine shots ahead of fourth place. Only No. 15 Denver (13 over par) and Colorado State (35 over par) finished ahead of UF. While most people did not expect this turnaround to happen so soon, Watts and the team have been waiting for this.
“It means we are moving in the right direction and 
that we are moving toward what we expected of our-selves,” she said.
Watts led the Gators in the event and finished the final round with a score of 7 over par for the tournament. Her individual score was tied for fourth-best.
She credits assistant coach Jay Goble for her solid and 
consistent play during the week.
“Our assistant coach, Jay, spent a lot of time work-
ing with me this week,” Watts said. “With his help and the ability to feel like I could focus this tournament, I did well.”
Freshman Evan Jensen and sophomore Jessica Yad-
loczky enjoyed solid final rounds. They both shot 2 over par Wednesday. Jensen finished the event with a score of 14 over par, while Yadloczky ended with a score of 10 over par.
The Gators will look to build off this performance in 
their next tournament, the Lady Gator Invitational, which will be held in Gainesville beginning April 6.
Watts believes the confidence she received from this 
tournament is going to help her and the team in their home event.
“For me, this was a huge confidence boost, being able 
to play this well on such a difficult golf course all the way across the country,” she said. “Coming home and playing 
in a tournament on our own turf should be a cakewalk.”Young UF impresses in Utah

UF pitcher Stephen Locke, who was dismissed from the team before the start of the 2009 season, 
pitched for the first time following his reinstatement during Wednesday’s game against North Florida.
By BOBBY CALLOVI
Alligator Writer
bcallovi@alligator.org
Almost two months after being 
kicked off UF’s baseball team, Ste-
phen Locke was officially allowed back on the team Tuesday.
In only his second game back, 
Locke made his first appearance, starting in UF’s 5-3 home win against North Florida on Wednes-day.
He lasted two innings and al-
lowed 1 run on one hit before being pulled because of his pitch count.
“This was a good first appear-
ance,” Locke said. “(UF coach Kev-
in O’Sullivan) wanted me to get out 
there and knock the rust off since I really hadn’t faced many hitters this spring.”
Locke was replaced on the 
mound by Justin Poovey, who hadn’t pitched since March 13 at Arkansas when he allowed 4 runs in 2 1/3 innings, but he fared much 
better against the Ospreys.
Poovey only allowed four base 
runners in his 4 2/3 innings of 
scoreless work.
The run support UF (15-8, 3-3 
Southeastern Conference) was missing in its 3-0 loss to North Florida on Tuesday night started to return with one swing of the bat by 
Matt den Dekker.
In the bottom of the third, den 
Dekker lined a solo homer over the 
right-field fence to tie the game at 1.
Den Dekker’s solo shot got 
things started for the Gators, and he has been igniting the team since 
being moved into the leadoff role.
“Ever since we moved him to 
the leadoff spot, he has been a much 
better hitter,” O’Sullivan said. “He is using the left side of the field a lot better. Sometimes you put a guy in the leadoff spot, he is more com-
fortable. Sometimes you put them 
in the three or four spot, and they think they have to do something differently.”
UF took the lead in the next in-
ning on a single by Brandon McAr-thur, scoring Avery Barnes.
While den Dekker continued his 
success at the plate and the Gators managed to rebound from their tough loss Tuesday, it was Locke’s 
two innings that stole that show.
On Jan. 28, he was kicked off the 
team after being arrested on DUI 
charges, but rumors of his return to the team began to swirl when the charges against him were dropped earlier this month due to a lack of evidence. 
With a need for more experi-
enced pitchers, bringing back the senior lefty was an easy solution to the problem.
“He gives us one more veteran 
arm,” O’Sullivan said. “It should help us certainly in conference 
play.”
Before Locke could return, O’Sullivan wanted to make sure the 
torn ACL in Locke’s right knee was 
fully recovered.
Locke said he was cleared by 
doctors Monday, and his right leg 
was stronger than his left in many of the tests.During his time away from the 
team, Locke continued to throw on 
his own four to five times a week, 
and he will be counted on this week-end to pitch out of the bullpen.
The first time he walked into the 
team’s locker room, it was one more step to getting back to his old life.
“It was exciting. I was finally 
getting back to my comfort zone,” Locke said. 
“I’ve played baseball every year 
of my life, so it was good to be back involved with daily routine.”UF BASEBALLLocke throws two innings in return appearance
