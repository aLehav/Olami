  The suspect in an investigation of ﬁ  ve rape cases 
since July was arrested Thursday and taken to the 
Marion County Jail. 
  Police charged Michael Alan Frye, 37, with mul-
tiple counts in connection with rapes he allegedly committed in Marion County . 
  The Ocala Police Department charged him with 
one count of sexual battery and one count of kid-napping, said department spokesman Sgt. Chas Maier. The Marion County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce charged him with one count of sexual battery, one count of kidnapping, one count of armed sexual battery and one count of armed kidnapping, said Judge Cochran, public information ofﬁ  cer for the Marion County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce. 
  The Gainesville Police De-
partment was part of the task force investigating the issue, along with the Marion County 
Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce, Ocala Police Department and Florida High-way Patrol.

  Gary Welles drives his ’97 Gillig bus for eight 
hours a day from the Park-and-Ride Lot to the 
Hub and back again. 
  He used to drive a ’95 — that one had the 
good mirrors, the big ones on the sides that help you see behind you — but he said he guesses it was outdated.
  Welles said he has seen the RTS system grow rapidly in Gainesville over the past few years.
  When he started driving in 1980, there were 
only two buses on Route 20, he said. Today , that route is one of the busiest, usually running ﬁ  ve buses.
  The 10 million riders in the last ﬁ  scal year 
and sometimes 60,000 passengers a day, make RTS the top public transportation agency per capita in Florida, said Chip Skinner, spokesman for RTS.
  On Wednesday , Gainesville received a nod 
from the Federal Transit Administration for its  RTS awarded $9 million

  A 22-year-old man was charged with 
murder early Thursday morning after al-
legedly shooting another man multiple times at Cabana Beach apartments.
 The victim died this morning.  Gainesville Police took Zeng Jean 
Jacques, also known as Bryan Jacques, into custody. 
  He was charged with first-degree pre-
meditated murder, a felony, and booked into the Alachua County Jail. 
  Officials found the victim, Theoder-ick Brown, 22, with what appeared to be about 10 gunshot wounds, said Cpl. An-gelina Valuri, GPD public information of-ficer.
  The shooting happened at about 3:20 
a.m. outside Building 26 at Cabana Beach apartments, 1601 SW 51st Terrace, Valuri said.
  Brown lived at an apartment one build-
ing away, she said. 
  GPD received a 911 call at 3:26 a.m. re-
porting that someone had been shot at the apartment complex. 
  He was transported to Shands Hos-pital, where he was pronounced dead, Valuri said. 
  Officers checked for witnesses in near-
by apartments. 
Jacques was in one of them, Valuri 
said.  She said he had a 9mm semiautomatic 
pistol, which was confiscated by police. 
  A witness said Brown and Jacques had 
been arguing before the incident. 
  Brittany Holt, a 21-year-old UF elemen-
tary education senior, has lived at Cabana Beach for just over a year and said she has never heard of any previous crime in the area. 
  She regularly walks her French bull-
dog, Charlie, at night.

Seth and Eva Matlins want you to know 
the truth.
To lessen negative self-image in young 
girls, they are calling for disclaimers to be 
placed on doctored images of models in advertisements.
The co-founders of OffOurChests.com 
are campaigning against advertisers who use digitally altered and airbrushed imag-es of models, citing that using such images contributes to the increasing problem of low self-esteem and negative body image in young girls. 
The Matlinses announced their cam-
paign to create The Self-Esteem Act, a bill that would require “truth in advertising” labels on airbrushed ads, in a Huffington Post blog on Aug. 22.
Seth Matlins’ post did not call for an 
outright ban of altered images but rather a disclaimer stating that the ads aren’t an accurate representation of real life. 
“I think [The Self-Esteem Act] is awe-some,” said Barbara Welsch, a licensed 
psychologist at the Counseling and Wellness Center. “I think that our young girls are led to be-lieve that these people really look the way they do.”
Middle- and high-
school-aged children aren’t very aware of the 
techniques used in such advertisements, she said, and such unrealistic portrayals of how women “should” look can lead to eat-ing disorders and self-esteem issues.
Journalism professor Kim Walsh-
Childers agreed, saying research has shown girls as young as 10 years old re-spond to images of ultra-skinny models by engaging in dieting behavior. 
However, she said, in the advertising 
industry, it is imperative to get the cus-tomer’s attention, even if the reaction is negative. 
“If we get you to look at the ad,” she 
said, “we’ve won.”

To get the attention of the Environmen-
tal Protection Agency, the Alachua County 
Commission has taken up letter-writing.
The commission sent a letter to the agency 
last week, urging it to test houses near the Cabot-Koppers Superfund site for dioxins, which are cancer-causing chemical com-pounds. The site is located on the corner of Main Street and Northwest 23rd Avenue.
Mark Sexton, county communications co-
ordinator, said the commission feels strongly about testing, especially in residents’ homes, because of health concerns.
The EPA has declared the former char -
coal production and wood-processing plant a Superfund site, which is a designation for a hazardous waste site.
The commission sent two letters about the 
site to President Barack Obama in the past year.
County commissioners have addressed 
the issue at meetings for the past year, call-ing it an injustice to citizens.
“I think we owe it to the citizens of this 
county to at least further investigate,” Com-missioner Rodney Long said in April.County asks EPA

Singing, stepping and dancing will kick off Soulfest 
tonight.
This marks the 12th year of Soulfest, a competition 
that showcases UF student performers and groups. The 
competition winner will perform at Gator Growl on Nov. 4, said Soulfest director Crystal Goss.
Soulfest is one of the first UF Homecoming events 
each year.
Goss said the performances start at 7 p.m. in the 
Reitz Union Amphitheater. International food will be served, and student groups will table from 5 p.m. to 6:45 p.m.
“We’re going to basically have a multicultural ex-
travaganza,” Goss said.
Soulfest started in 2000 as an event on Turlington 
Plaza with a $200 budget. 
This year, it will be put on for $1,400 and co-spon-
sored by Student Government Productions and Star Distribution Inc., she said.
Soulfest’s third annual blood drive ends today. The 
blood drive began Oct. 3 and was co-sponsored by Life-South Community Blood Centers.
The theme for this year’s event is “The Untold Story 
of a Timeless SOUL.”Performances, food

Gabrielle Rushing and Jessica 
Bentley got naked the first time 
they met.
There was no alcohol involved.Rushing, a 20-year-old biology 
junior, and Bentley, a 21-year-old advertising senior, represent UF in Playboy’s “Girls of the SEC” is-sue. The issue, which features girls from the 12 SEC universities, was available on newsstands Oct. 14. 
Playboy does the feature once 
every four years. 
The university has no affiliation 
with the magazine, UF spokesman Steve Orlando said.
Last April, about 100 girls tried 
out for the magazine at a casting call in Gainesville. Rushing and Bentley, who asked to keep her real surname separate from her modeling personality, were cho-sen and left Gainesville a few days later for the photoshoot at Ginnie Springs.
The girls met the day of the 
shoot and got to know each other over hair and makeup, Rushing said. 
Several of the photos include 
the girls holding a 130-pound al-ligator on their shoulders. These photos will be published in the issue of Playboy’s College Girls, a spinoff magazine, on newsstands Nov. 29.
The photograph featured in the 
“Girls of the SEC” shows Rushing and Bentley posing nude together, sitting on a log.
“It wasn’t uncomfortable to me 
because by that time we had seen each other pose separately, and we were aware of what to do,” Rush-ing said.
Rushing, from Tampa, read 
about the casting call in the Alli-gator and, though she had never modeled before, signed up for it.
“I thought, ‘Why not?’” Rush-
ing said.
While the audition process was 
unfamiliar and nerve-wracking, Rushing felt “super comfortable” posing for the photographer.
She was informed of her se-
lection through a phone call and shared her excitement with her six siblings, parents and friends.
She also told her boyfriend of 
10 months, Jason.“At first he wasn’t too fond 
of the idea,” Rushing said, “but I showed him the picture, and he’s really proud of me. He said that I looked beautiful.”
When the magazine was re-
leased, Rushing’s dad immedi-ately went out and bought a copy, she said.
“His exact words were ‘very 
classy,’ and he decided to say, ‘re-ally nice eyes,’” she said.
Aside from her newfound modeling career, Rushing began dancing when she was 3 years old and jokingly considers studying a hobby.
Bentley, from Melbourne, Fla., 
began modeling when she was 6 years old, posing in costumes for a dance catalog. 
She didn’t model again until 
she was 17, when she took photos for a surf expo and websites. 
After auditioning and being 
selected for the Playboy feature, Bentley submitted her pictures to Playboy’s editor and was approved to take part in another photoshoot for the October/November 2011 issue of Special Edition Lingerie, another spinoff magazine.
Photos from the shoot also were 
used in June to feature Bentley as “Coed of the Week” on Playboy’s website.
“Both shoots were easy, and 
I felt comfortable,” Bentley said. “Once you’ve done it once, it makes it more comfortable the second time.”
Bentley’s family, including her 
two younger brothers, and friends are supportive of her modeling ca-reer. Her brothers are too young to have any comments on their sis-ter’s Playboy photos, she said.
Aside from her modeling ca-
reer, Bentley owns Glow Gators, a tanning business she launched in June that offers to spray tan customers in a location of their choice.
“It started off slowly because 
I’m in school, but it’s growing rap-idly,” Bentley said.
She said she would extend her 
career at Playboy, too, if given the opportunity.
In light of their experience, 
Rushing and Bentley have become good friends.
“We share something that a lot 
of people don’t get the opportuni-ty to share,” Bentley said. “We’re two women out of a university of 50,000 people that get to represent UF in an issue that’s only pub-lished once every four years.”
Both girls said they’d always be 
proud of their participation in the magazine, even when they have kids.
“I would be proud if my mom 
was in Playboy,” Rushing said. “I’d represent that and be excited 
and happy about it.”4, ALLIGATOR §  FRIDAY, OCTOBER 21, 2011

INTERNATIONAL
  THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
  SIRTE, Libya — Dragged from 
hiding in a drainage pipe, a wound-
ed Moammar Gadhaﬁ   raised his hands and begged revolutionary ﬁ  ghters: “Don’t kill me, my sons.” Within an hour, he was dead, but not before jubilant Libyans had vented decades of hatred by pull-ing the eccentric dictator’s hair and parading his bloodied body on the hood of a truck.
  Gadhaﬁ  ’s death Thursday , two 
months after he was driven from power and into hiding, decisively buries the nearly 42-year regime that had turned the oil-rich country into an international pariah and his own personal ﬁ  efdom.
  It also thrusts Libya into a new 
age in which its transitional lead-ers must overcome deep divisions and rebuild nearly all its institutions from scratch to achieve democracy.
  “We have been waiting for this 
historic moment for a long time. Moammar Gadhaﬁ   has been killed,” said Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril in the capital of Tripoli. “I would like to call on Libyans to put aside the grudges and only say one word, which is Libya, Libya, Libya.”
  President Barack Obama told 
the Libyan people: “You have won your revolution.”
  Although the U.S. brieﬂ  y led the 
relentless NATO bombing campaign that sealed Gadhaﬁ  ’s fate, Washing-ton later took a secondary role to its allies. Britain and France said they hoped that his death would lead to a more democratic Libya.
  Other leaders have fallen in the 
Arab Spring uprisings, but the 69-year-old Gadhaﬁ   is the ﬁ  rst to be killed. He was shot to death in his hometown of Sirte, where revolu-tionary ﬁ  ghters overwhelmed the last of his loyalist supporters Thurs-day after weeks of heavy battles.
    Bloody images of Gadhaﬁ  ’s last 
moments raised questions over how exactly he died after he was cap-tured wounded but alive. Video on Arab television stations showed a crowd of ﬁ  ghters shoving and pull-ing the goateed, balding Gadhaﬁ  , with blood splattered on his face and soaking his shirt.
  Gadhaﬁ   struggled against them, 
stumbling and shouting as the ﬁ  ght-ers pushed him onto the hood of a pickup truck. One ﬁ  ghter held him down, pressing on his thigh with a pair of shoes in a show of con-tempt.
  Fighters propped him on the 
hood as they drove for several 
moments, appar-ently to parade him around in victory.
  “We want him 
alive. We want him alive,” one man shouted be-
fore Gadhaﬁ   was dragged off the hood, some ﬁ  ghters pulling his hair, toward an ambulance.
  Later footage showed ﬁ  ght-
ers rolling Gadhaﬁ  ’s lifeless body over on the pavement, stripped to the waist and a pool of blood un-der his head. His body was then paraded on a car through Misrata, a nearby city that suffered a brutal siege by regime forces during the eight-month civil war that eventu-ally ousted Gadhaﬁ  . Crowds in the streets cheered, “The blood of mar-tyrs will not go in vain.”
    In Sirte, the ecstatic former rebels 
celebrated the city’s fall after weeks of ﬁ  ghting by ﬁ  ring endless rounds into the sky , pumping their guns, knives and even a meat cleaver in the air and singing the national an-them.
  After seizing power in a 1969 
coup that toppled the monarchy , Gadhaﬁ   created a “revolutionary” system of “rule by the masses,” which supposedly meant every citizen participated in government but really meant all power was in his hands. He wielded it errati-cally , imposing random rules while crushing opponents, often hanging anyone who plotted against him in public squares.
  Abroad, Gadhaﬁ   posed as a 
Third World leader, while funding militants, terror groups and guerril-la armies. His regime was blamed in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, and the downing of a French passenger jet in Africa the following year, as well as the 1986 bombing of a Ger-man discotheque frequented by U.S. servicemen that killed three people.
  Gadhaﬁ   died in the ambulance 
from wounds suffered during the clashes. Abdel-Jalil Abdel-Aziz, a doctor who accompanied the body in the ambulance during the 120-mile drive to Misrata, said Gadhaﬁ   died from two bullet wounds — to the head and chest.
      Thursday’s ﬁ  nal blows to the 
Gadhaﬁ   regime allow Libya’s inter-im leadership, the National Transi-tional Council, to declare the entire country liberated.
    The Council will declare libera-
tion on Saturday , Mohamed Sayeh, a senior council member, said. That begins a key timetable toward cre-ating a new system: The NTC has always said it will form a new in-terim government within a month of liberation and will hold elections within eight months.

Alligator’s poll questions?Today’s question: Are you going to the Pride Parade 
this weekend?Access to genome will advance medicine
The Human Genome Project is a mind-blowing development that has engaged scientists for the past 20 years. It can identify thousands of genes 
in human DNA and determine the sequences of 3 billion chemical base pairs. 
Sequencing the first human genome under this proj-
ect was backbreaking work. Akin to carefully pealing off 
the paint of an important monument in order to discover the age and intricacies of the bare architecture, scientists must delicately uncoil DNA while meticulously deter -
mining the order of the bases. 
Ultimately, the Human Genome Project allowed sci-
entists to discover genes and their sequence. What took billions of dollars and several years to complete can now be done in a few days and for a few thousand dollars. 
However, the accessibility to the human genome 
comes with an influx of moral and ethical questions. 
While the purpose of the Human Genome Project is 
limited to health benefits such as treating medical dis-orders, there is a concern that the project may be used inappropriately. For example, health insurance compa-nies and employers may exploit the genome sequence of a patient if they are able to get access. 
People can be denied health insurance or may be 
charged a very high premium. Additionally, people can be denied a job due to health risks linked to their genome sequence. However, the government has taken actions to prevent such discriminatory practices by passing the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA). 
Another concern with the human genome is that it 
may lead to discrimination and prejudice against people who have “bad traits.” These “bad traits” may include a lack of intelligence in the field of mathematics or simply being too short or too tall. 
Scholars argue that the evolution of the Human Ge-
nome Project will lead to a society that will rely too heav-ily on bettering the human race. There will be no natural drive to excel or no acceptance of the biological essence of human life that makes all of us different. 
While the arguments against the Human Genome Project are valid, they also seem to be missing the main contribu-tion that the project will have on our society. Genetic treatment will be able to flourish, and medical research will benefit considerably from a more thor -
ough understanding of human genes. Once the human genome is made completely available, 
doctors and scientists will have a directory of informa-tion about the genetic compositions of the human body. Doctors will be able to look up the genetic makeup of the patients and quickly identify genes that may be mu-tated. In doing so, medical disorders can be diagnosed, treated and possibly even cured. 
For so long, doctors have spent decades trying to 
decipher what caused a particular disease or what they could have done to prevent the disease from causing death. This strenuous and inefficient process is becom-ing archaic. 
While all of us have the same “human genome,” there 
are differences in the genome sequence in individuals called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These minor variations are thought to be the basis of our sus-ceptibility to diseases and response to drugs. SNPs can predict if someone is likely to get heart disease or diabe-tes. Thus, doctors can assess a person’s medical risk fac-tors just by looking at his or her genome. This is already leading the way to personalized medicine.
We must not hinder human genome sequencing ef-
forts and its adoption in medicine and health care. Peo-ple who believe that the project will create a new era of eugenics are forgetting that patients with life-threat-ening illnesses are yearning for our help. Fear that the human genome will elicit discrimination and prejudice is not enough to stop this phenomenal scientific achieve-ment from transforming our lives. 
Akansha Mishra is a pre-law junior at UF. Her column 
appears on Fridays.Well, it’s almost the weekend here in Gainesville, but 
there’s no football game at home or away. So what is there 
to do? 
How about some homework? How about that research 
paper you’ve known about since the beginning of the se-mester? 
Nah, who are we kidding? It’s not November yet. On that note, it’s time for this week’s this-weekend-
may-be-good-to-catch-up-on-school-work-but-procrasti-nation-is-more-fun edition of... 
Darts and Laurels 
First and foremost, we throw an it’s-a-good-thing-you-
killed-yourself-because-you-would-be-screwed DART to 
Terry Thompson for releasing dozens of exotic animals, including lions and tigers and bears (oh my!) before pro-ceeding to commit suicide. 
Apparently, this guy was deep in debt, so he did the 
logical thing. 
Next, we award a way-to-die LAUREL to former Lib-
yan dictator Moammar Gadhafi for “gettin’ got real good 
like.” 
Meanwhile, the people of Libya are rejoicing in a collec-
tive “Now what?” 
In reference to Wednesday’s editorial, we throw a these-
people-need-to-reevaluate-their-lives DART to the 18 peo-
ple who walked right by two-year-old Yue Yue after she was hit by two vans on a side street in China. 
That’s just sick. For our next award, we give a make-sure-you-give-him-
slippery-soap LAUREL to the Marion County Sheriff’s 
Office for arresting suspected serial rapist Michael Alan 
Frye. 
Maybe the security guard on shower duty will sleep in 
too late one day. 
Don’t hold it against him. We also will be lobbing a you-have-got-to-be-freaking-
kidding-me DART to Springfield public schools in New 
Jersey for banning students from wearing costumes to school on Halloween. 
The students like getting dressed for school because they 
don’t have time to do it after school due to homework. But the school district has asked teachers to lighten their home-work load for that evening to give them more time to pre-pare. And we wonder why our education system sucks. 
We go local for our last award. We’re giving a way-to-stand-up-to-time-and-place-free-
speech-ordinances LAUREL to Ellas Anthony McDaniel 
for getting arrested on the Bo Diddley Community Plaza named for his father. 
Surely, an if-the-park-or-public-place-is-named-for-the-
descendant-of-the-person-inhabiting-the-area exception could be made, right? 
Have a fun and safe weekend, and be sure to check back 
next week!

letters@alligator.org FRIDAY, OCTOBER 21, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 7
Even though poverty has always existed, the seeds of the 
current division between the haves and the have-nots began about 60 years ago. Ever since the government’s 
original attempt to solve the problem of poverty with pro-grams, court decisions and amendments, the fixes only made things worse.
The GI Bill started separating haves and have-nots with the 
“white flight” from decaying inner cities to new suburbs. In-terstate highways paved the way for sprawl and growth while businesses on the “old highways” declined.
At the same time the Supreme Court mandated racial in-
tegration (a good thing when they banned Jim Crow laws), it struck down prayer in schools. That caused public schools to lose many good families who built their own parochial and private schools as well as home schools. Public schools used to be the pinnacle of American egalitarianism. 
In the ‘60s and ‘70s, four things happened that changed 
America for the worse: environmentalism, overpopulation alarmism, family planning and the sexual revolution.  This re-sulted in closed factories (also thanks to unions), a reversal of evolution (smart people limited reproduction for the first time in human history), increased STDs, more divorces, increased rush hour traffic due to more women in the labor force and more teen suicides.
Public housing projects were decaying when, under Presi-
dent Clinton, the government decided that “everyone should own a home” with the Fair Housing (bubble) Act. Mortgage qualifying rules were relaxed. 
We know what happened next.Also in the 1960s, entitlement pro-
grams starting with the Great Society were attempts to place  a  bandage on a dying body, the costs of which grew 
and created a hopeless dependent culture where substance abuse and unwed mothers are common.
Federal student loans were created under the assumption 
that “everyone should have a degree” (really because states couldn’t afford to support colleges and universities due to huge Medicaid costs mandated by Washington in all 50 states). Tuition was free in California for residents until this time. To-day, graduates with large loan debts cannot escape, they can’t declare bankruptcy , and even their parents are obligated if the kid runs off or dies. Washington took the student loan pro-gram entirely from the banks and kept the same rules.
And some people play off the current hatred of the 1 per -
cent to get (re-)elected.
But there is hope. It involves changing family law and us-
ing the judicial branch instead of costly entitlements.
Currently , entitlements make up the biggest portion 
of government spending and will only grow worse if not changed. A sliding scale medical payment/billing system based on (extended) family wealth could easily replace insur -
ance, both public and private. Taxes could be reduced by 50 percent across all levels of government. And finally, the gov-ernment should focus on urban renewal, which is better for the environment than continued sprawl. All three branches of government can still get it right.
J.D. Knee is a resident of Gainesville. US policy has only worsened poverty  Guest column
To borrow Elizabeth Warren’s phrasing, our gen-
eration is being “chipped at, hacked at, squeezed and hammered.” Youth unemployment is at a 
record high, as is college tuition. We’re paying money we don’t have for an education that guarantees less and less in terms of future success.
I don’t believe that college educations should be 
valued only in terms of salary increase nor do I think 
the solution is to tell smart, tal-ented kids not to go to college. The rates of unemployment and underemployment, even when factoring in student loan debt, 
are worse for those with only high school diplomas.
If you don’t want to be here, don’t be. No judgment. 
Go work for a while. Figure out what you want to do. It might not require any more extraordinarily expensive semesters. It might very well require many more pricey semesters. But at the end, there will be something for all that.

Speaking Out
Ben Miller
UWireofficer, said the department is conducting an exten-
sive follow-up investigation to determine whether Frye is the same suspect involved in a July 5 sexual battery case in Gainesville. 
One victim said she was assaulted on July 19, 
according to a Marion County Sheriff’s Office ar -
rest report. She said she had left her home to go to a Dunkin’ Donuts on East Silver Springs Boulevard to turn in an employment application that afternoon.
While walking through the parking lot of a Wal-
greens on the same road, she was approached by a man who was driving either a teal green or light blue minivan who offered her a ride because it was hot outside. 
He took her to Dunkin’ Donuts, where she 
turned in her application. He then drove to Juniper Trail in order to check on homes he said he owned in the area.
He parked across the street from 122 Juniper Trail, where the incident occurred, and offered to let her see the house, according to the report. She fol-lowed him to the backyard, where he then dragged her over to a shed where he bound and sexually as-saulted her. 
After he left she freed herself, ran next door and 
asked a man to call the Marion County Sheriff’s Of-fice, according to the report. 
Cochran said media attention, including publi-
cizing drawings of the suspect, led to tips for the task force. 
“Eventually they worked their way right to the 
door where he lived,” he said. 
Ocala Police Department Detective Stephanie 
McQuaig located Frye, whose appearance matched descriptions given by the victims, as a potential suspect and told Marion County Sheriff’s Office Sgt. Jerry Bevan on Thursday about the connection, according to an arrest report.
In photo lineups that included images of Frye, 
victims identified him as their assailant.  
Frye is being held without bond.8, ALLIGATOR §  FRIDAY, OCTOBER 21, 2011
� THE CITY COMMISSION 
SAID IT IS WILLING TO DISCUSS PLAZA HOURS.
MEREDITH RUTLAND
Alligator Staff Writer
About 30 Occupy Gainesville 
members asked the City Com-
mission on Thursday for per -
mission to stay on Bo Diddley Community Plaza after public hours end at 11:30 p.m. rather than protest on the sidewalks at night.
“We don’t choose the times 
we live in, but by our courage we do choose how we want to be remembered,” said Lars Din, a member of the Occupy Gainesville movement.
Speakers shouted, threw 
their hands in the air and did spirit fingers in lieu of clap-ping or booing, which isn’t allowed during commission meetings.
The commissioners said 
they are willing to talk about the issue with the protesters. Commissioners did not move the issue to a committee for fur -
ther consideration.
Commissioner Randy Wells 
said the city has to be careful when making exceptions to rules.
“If we were to make an ex-
ception for you, there would re-ally be very little legal basis for it to be available for anyone for any reason,” he said.
Commissioner Thomas 
Hawkins said he’d be willing to have a conversation about the rule.
“I think it sounds perfectly 
reasonable to have the plaza open 18 hours a day ,” he said. “But maybe that’s wrong.”Occupy protesters

GRU workers Mark Roc and Ren Gallon work on power lines on Fifth Avenue on Thursday afternoon. “We 
are replacing everything but the pole,” said GRU manager Dwayne Mercer.
Project will cost $50 million
success. The FTA awarded the city a 
$9 million grant to help build a new bus maintenance facility.
This money will be combined 
with a $10.6 million grant the city received in August for the first two phases of the construction project, Skinner said. 
The total project is estimated to 
cost $50 million and is expected to be completed by 2025.
The new facility will be located 
on Southeast First Street and is ex-pected to be much larger than its predecessor.
The City of Gainesville purchased 
the 18-acre property in January 2010 for $4.4 million.Though RTS has about 100 buses 
on its current lot, the facility was only built to house about 50. The new property will have room for up to 230.
It will also be large enough to 
perform in-house maintenance on the buses.
Currently, if a bus is in an acci-
dent or requires paint touch-ups or body work, Skinner said, it must be driven or towed to an outside ven-dor, usually in Ocala or Orlando. Being able to do those repairs in Gainesville would save time and money.
Skinner said Gainesville’s award 
was the largest in the state. 
The city will continue to apply 
for additional federal funding to put 
toward the construction project.rtS, from page 1ArrES t, from page 1Media attention, sketches led to arrestBUY IT. SELL IT. FIND IT. 373-FIND

The Gators’ game against Furman on Nov. 19 will be 
available on pay-per-view only, the school and Sun Sports announced Thursday. alligatorSports Podcast
Check out the website today for a special edition of the alligatorSports podcast featuring coverage from every sport not called football.  Host Greg Luca and several guests will break down everything Gators. Freshman midfielder Havana Solaun scored a game-winning goal in overtime to propel the Gators to a 2-1 win on Thursday. See Story, Page 16. 
Let’s be honest: We here at the 
alligatorSports Brand Picks Column have been mailing it 
in this week.
The Gators are on a bye, none of 
the players want to talk to us about their miserable season, and we’re fine with that. The less work, the better.
We’re not lazy, we’re just worn 
down. It’s completely understand-able. The grind can get to anybody after a while.
But following a week filled with 
UF golf and swimming, we’re ready to spend our weekend without foot-ball the only way we know how: with football.
Our time is free, our lives are 
empty, and many teams are vying for our support and viewership.
The closest game we could find 
was 350 miles south on Florida’s Turnpike. So, since the Picks Col-umn never takes a week off, we let two of our writers debate Georgia Tech’s trip to Miami.
The Ramblin’ Wreck (+3) de-
serves our attention because…
With a week off from Charlie 
Weis’ genius, our best chance at en-tertainment comes from a team that harkens back to football’s golden age with a little triple-option offense. Georgia Tech doesn’t have fancy-schmancy Wildcat packages, spread attacks and passing “routes,” but the Yellow Jackets have a diverse play-calling array of their own: run left, run right and run middle.
Georgia Tech boasts the nation’s 
No. 2 rushing offense at 347.9 yards per game, and that will be more than enough to overwhelm Miami’s No. 94 rush defense.
Plus, if somebody tips the Yel-
low Jackets off about this new thing called “the forward pass,” stellar wideout Stephen Hill might make a few exciting plays, and that would JOHN BOOTHE

The Gators’ preseason expecta-
tions were put to a vote Thursday 
with the release of the first USA Today/ESPN Coaches’ poll. 
Florida checked in at No. 10, 
its highest opening position in the coaches’ poll since 2006 when the team entered the preseason No. 1. This year, top-ranked North Carolina holds the honor with 29 more first-place votes than No. 2 Kentucky.
“It’s kind of like a curse in dis-
guise, honestly, because we’ve got so much pressure on us be-cause of that,” sophomore for-ward Casey Prather said. “But we just have to do a great job of limiting the pressure and focus on what we need to do.”
Four of the six ranked op-
ponents UF will face this season are in the top 10, with No. 3 Ohio State the highest outside of the Southeastern Conference. 
The Gators travel to Colum-
bus, Ohio to take on the Buckeyes on Nov. 15. 
“With our nonconference 
schedule we’re going to be faced and put in a lot of adverse situa-tions,” coach Billy Donovan said. “And we better figure out how to deal with that now. That’s what this time is for, to be able to deal with that.”
Last season, then-No. 11 Flori-
da lost three of its first 11 games, including two against unranked teams. Prather said the Gators came out flat to begin the year and struggled with the high ex-pectations.While three starters off last sea-
son’s Elite Eight squad are gone, Florida has added junior transfer Mike Rosario and a pair of fresh-men in guard Bradley Beal and forward Walter Pitchford.
“We obviously have lost some 
players, and how this team can progress, there probably could be some games where we look like the 10th-ranked team and probably some games where we don’t even look like we should be ranked,” Donovan said.
Inside-out: After five days of 
practice, Florida’s crowded back-court is still finding a way to keep its big men involved.
Donovan said sophomore 
center Patric Young has been tak-ing the bulk of the shots during scrimmages, and the team will continue an inside-out approach.
In a much-hyped freshman 
season, Young was streaky

About five-and-a-half hours af-
ter Madison Monserez arrived back 
in Gainesville, she was in class. A few hours later, she was gearing up for prac-tice on what is typically an off day for the Gators’ volleyball team.
“This week we’re a little pressed for 
time,” Monserez said.
Florida arrived home from a weekend 
road trip Monday at 3 a.m. and barely had time to catch a breath until a much-needed day off Thursday. 
After having one day to recover from 
a hectic, six-day stretch that saw the Gators play three games in three differ -
ent states, UF (16-3, 9-1 Southeastern Conference) begins its preparations to-day for a Sunday afternoon showdown 
at home against Mis-
sissippi State (10-9, 5-5 SEC).
“The most impor -
tant thing right now is that these players have the day off tomor -
row,” Florida coach Mary Wise said after 
Wednesday night’s game at South Caro-lina. 
“Fatigue has really set in. We’re at the halfway point of the season. It’s going to happen.”
In the middle of its most dominant 
stretch since 2009, Florida has won 21 consecutive sets during a seven-game winning streak. 
But in Wednesday’s third set, the 
Gators showed their first real signs of weakness during the past seven games.
Entering the third set hitting .566 
with just two attack errors on 57 swings, the fatigue that comes with being in the midst of a 10-game span, including seven road matches, finally sent in for Florida.
With 41 swings in the third set, the 
Gators committed seven attack errors Finally rested, Florida preparing for MSU

The Hurricanes (-3) will keep us enthralled through a 
week without the Gators because…
The U invented swagger – or something like that. We 
all know Trey Burton is trying to bring the swagger back 
to Gainesville, but it never left Coral Gables.
Let’s be real: No one cares about Miami’s on-field abili-
ties anymore. It’s all about the off-field drama, and the ‘Canes   have plenty of that. 
From Nevin Shapiro’s jailhouse confessional and sub-
sequent player suspensions to Micanor Regis’ one-game ban  for swinging at a North Carolina player, the ‘Canes 
are a real-life soap opera.
Besides, if there’s one thing The U knows how to do 
(aside from violate NCAA rules), it’s stop the triple-op-tion. After an embarrassment at the hands of the Yellow Jackets in 2008, allowing 472 yards on the ground, the ‘Canes have learned their lesson and kept it in check the last two years, both UM wins.

Now, on to the picks!
In first with a 33-22 record is The Associated Press’ 
Mark “Student of the game, my ass” Long, who spent all 
day Thursday railing against Jaguars quarterback Blaine Gabbert because the rookie didn’t know who Howard Co-sell was. Last we checked, announcers don’t wear pads, so what’s the big deal? If he didn’t know the great Gus Johnson, then we would have a problem. 
Leading a three-way charge for second with a 32-23 re-
cord is alligatorSports writer Tyler “Pass the starch” Jett, who made sure all his clothes were firmly pressed before last week’s game at Auburn. Finally, Jett has learned to iron his shirt without the assistance of his mommy. Who’s our little guy!
Also in second after a remarkable 7-1 week is alligator -
Sports writer Greg “Those aren’t my people” Luca, who was terrified when forced to walk too closely to some Auburn fans last Saturday because of their “differences.” You might be a redneck if…
Rounding out the second-place logjam is alligatorSports 
assistant editor Matt “It’s still real to me, dammit!” Watts, who longs for the days when he was a grizzly 14-year-old pro wrestling journalist eagerly stealing stories from other, more credible, basement-dwelling virgins. Captain Insano shows no mercy.
Tied for fifth with a 31-24 record is FightinGators.com’s 
Cody “I was a pitcher in high school, not an outfielder” Jones, who curled into the fetal position when another writer tossed a cell phone to him. Cody’s fear of the fly ball explains why he only knows one type of pitch: junk.
Also in fifth is InsideTheGators.com’s Kyle “Money is 
the root of all evil” Maistri, whose adamant disdain for the nation’s monetary system has been well-documented on Facebook lately. We get it, Kyle: You hate money. We’ll gladly take it off your hands for you.
Still in seventh with a 29-26 record is The Florida Times-
Union’s Mike “The smiley face always works” DiRocco, who engaged in some Twitter flirting with a certain for -
mer member of this column to apologize for knocking that writer’s skills on the gridiron. Don’t be jealous that Ed still has his youth and you must live vicariously through your teenage son, Mike. 
And in dead-ass last place (again), with a piss-poor re-
cord of 27-28 is alligatorSports editor Tom “I interviewed that guy!” Green, who repeatedly interrupted a recent matinee showing of “Moneyball” to remind anyone who would listen that he spent his summer covering the Oak-land A’s. No, Tom, no one cares that you used to walk through that hallway every day. FRIDAY, OCTOBER 21, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 15

offensively and garnered just 2.4 
shots per game.
“There’s been good balance 
there,” Donovan said. “Patric’s not drastically ahead of the guy that’s in second. It’s all pretty well distributed within our team right now, which is good.”
The Gators’ point guards — in-
cluding last season’s leading scor-er, Erving Walker — are taking the fewest number of shots in practice, according to Donovan. Walker is currently third to last in the num-ber of attempts.
“Erving’s already proven he 
can score,” Donovan said. “I’m not worried about that. I’m worried much, much more when I watch tape of practice of what are the quality of shots we’re getting.”
An eyesore: Sophomore for-
ward Erik Murphy had to miss most of Wednesday’s practice after getting poked in the eye. 
“It wasn’t his cornea, but part of his eye got scratched,” Dono-van said. “Had a lot of swelling, 
couldn’t open his 
eye, wasn’t able to come back to practice.”
Murphy saw a 
doctor following the incident and was cleared to practice Thurs-
day. 
Press: Junior guard Kenny 
Boynton said the Gators have been working on their full-court press every day in practice.
Although the squad struggled 
at times last season maintaining pressure defense, Boynton said the team is using the same sets. He feels this year’s depth at the guard position will allow for a more ef-fective defense and more forced turnovers.
“It’s the same press, but I think 
with our speed this year we can fly around and we could cheat some because we have the speed to get there,” he said.
Whether in a three- or four-
guard lineup, the man usually at the back of the press protecting the basket has been the 6-foot-9 Young.
“Pat’s been pretty vocal,” Boyn-
ton said. 
“Pretty much he has the easi-
est job because we’re going hard in the front, so all Pat has to do is anticipate the passes.”

and hit .195, their lowest single-set hitting 
percentage since a .167 clip in the ﬁ  rst set of a Sept. 30 match with Auburn.
  “Fatigue was the No. 1 factor there,” Wise 
said. “Our players are absolutely gassed from the travel.”
  Earlier in the week, redshirt freshman 
libero Taylor Unroe was admittedly affected by the travel despite her dig numbers being as consistently high as they have been all season. But she also said working through fatigue can beneﬁ  t a team.
  “It’s pretty rough, but it’ll be good for 
us to have that turnaround really quick and having to deal with that team very quickly,” Unroe said. 
“It’s good to practice when we’re tired 
and work through that.”
  Because of the rare midweek game that 
was in place due to an ESPNU broadcast, the Gators will have their ﬁ  rst Friday night off of the 2011 season before the Bulldogs arrive in Gainesville.
  “The hard thing about this week is going 
to be mental focus,” Monserez said. “We re-ally need to focus on everything we need to do.”   JOSH JURNOVOY

 The Gators were minutes away from 
their second straight loss to a Southeast-
ern Conference bottom-feeder Thursday night, but they avoided disaster as they ﬁ  nally found their ﬁ  nishing touch.
  No. 13 Florida (14-4, 7-2 Southeastern 
Conference) defeated Arkansas (4-12, 2-7 SEC) 2-1 in overtime in Fayetteville, Ark., thanks to two late goals after giving up an early score for the second straight game.
  The Gators recent ﬁ  nishing struggles 
came to an end with a game-tying goal in the 80th followed by a golden goal in the 92nd minute when senior midﬁ  elder Lindsay Thompson brought the ball up outside and sent a cross to the back post. Freshman midﬁ  elder Havana Solaun headed it in near post for her sixth goal.
  The majority of the game was eerily 
reminiscent of Florida’s 1-0 loss to Missis-sippi State on Sunday, in which UF gave up a goal 37 seconds into the game and controlled the ball the rest of the match but squandered numerous scoring chances.
  Three minutes in, Arkansas, the low-
est-scoring team in the SEC with just nine goals on the season prior to the game, took a 1-0 lead when junior forward Allie Chan-dler shook a tackle attempt from Gators center back Annie Bobbitt just outside the box and ﬁ  nished from 20 yards out.
  Like Sunday, the Gators had total con-
trol of the ball after giving up the early goal, but they were unable to capitalize.  They recorded 12 shots in the ﬁ  rst half, while the Razorbacks’ only shot was the one they netted.
  Gators’ head coach Becky Bur-
leigh said it was frustrating that her team gave up the early goal.In the second half, Arkansas opted for a conservative style of defense, dropping several players into the penalty box to help thwart many Florida chances.
  “They were not trying to win,” Bur-
leigh said. 
“They were just trying to put people in 
front of the ball.”  The Gators broke through to tie it in the 
80th minute thanks to midﬁ  elder Brooke Thigpen. Freshman forward Annie Speese played a free kick to midﬁ  elder Jo Drag-otta near the end line on the right side and Dragotta sent the ball into the middle of the box, where Thigpen emerged from the ensuing scrum to put it past Lillard for her ﬁ  rst goal of the season.
  Said Burleigh: “That is exactly why we 
put her in there — to have an extra attack-er out of the back.”  16, ALLIGATOR   FRIDAY, OCTOBER 21, 2011
