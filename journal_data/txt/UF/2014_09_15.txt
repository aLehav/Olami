When Florida took to the ﬁ  eld for 
its Southeastern Conference opener 
against Kentucky on Saturday, it 
looked nothing like the team that 
showed up against Eastern Michi-gan one week earlier.
The Gators (2-0, 1-0 SEC) may 
have squeezed out a 36-30, triple-overtime win against the Wildcats (2-1, 0-1 SEC) at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Sta-dium, but UF coach Will Muschamp knows the Gators can’t get caught 
up in the hysteria of the victory.
Inconsistencies riddled Florida 
throughout the game, making it dif-
ﬁ  cult for the fourth-year coach to 
relish the win.
“I don’t really feel relief after 
games,” Muschamp said. “I just 
look at it from the technical stand-point that we’ve got to clean some 
things up in the back end and our 
guys fought.”
In the ﬁ  rst half, it seemed as if 
the Gators regressed back to their 
2013 form.
Five of Florida’s seven drives be-
fore halftime resulted in punts and 
one ﬁ  nished in an interception — quarterback Jeff Driskel’s ﬁ  rst of the year — resulting in just three points through 30 minutes of play. 
Dropped balls were abundant and deep passes missed the mark as Driskel skidded to a 35-percent completion rate and just 116 pass-ing yards — 107 of which went to sophomore wide receiver Demar-cus Robinson.
“We had a couple shots down 
the ﬁ  eld where we maxed the pro-tection … but we threw out of bounds,” Muschamp said. “I think Demarcus would’ve brought it in if we had given him the chance. ... We 
were just a little off on some of the 
deep balls down the ﬁ  eld. You hit a couple of those balls, it changes how they play, but we didn’t hit those balls.”
The young Florida secondary 
failed to cover when it mattered and saw more than its fair share of interception opportunities fall right 
out of its hands with some having 
costly repercussions.
With just under six minutes to 
play in the third quarter, Kentucky quarterback Patrick Towles — un-
der pressure by Florida’s Dante 
Fowler Jr. — attempted a pass in the direction of wide receiver Blake Bone that went in and out of cor-
nerback Vernon Hargreaves III’s 
control.
One play later, Towles found 
backup wide receiver Garrett John-son deep for a 60-yard touchdown 
to give the Wildcats their ﬁ  rst lead 
over the Gators in a game since Oct. 20, 2007. 
“Defensively, you know, we’ve 
just got to cover better,” Muschamp said. “Bottom line. That’s my re-sponsibility, and we’ll improve on it. … When you play a team that’s VOLUME 109 ISSUE 15 WWW.ALLIGATOR.ORG MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, 2014

For the ﬁ  rst time, Gator Growl at-
tendees can sip wine or beer before the 
headliners take the stage.
A beer and wine garden will be set 
up on Oct. 17 at the back of Flavet Field, 
the new venue for Growl, which is billed 
as the nation’s largest student-run pep rally.
With the change in scenery after 82 
years in The Swamp comes a change in vibe. Growl event producer Devin McDaniel said the staff wanted to take advantage of the location and create a music festival atmosphere.
“We thought the beer and wine, obvi-
ously in a very controlled environment, aligned with all those other aspects that we’re bringing to the show,” McDaniel said.
Growl staff had to present a proposal, 
along with a security plan, to Student Af-fairs to make the approval a reality. 
The garden will have a capacity of 
about 200 people and will have two ID Gator Growl to include 
beer and wine gardenLOCAL

Swamp Records and Grooveshark are now 
partners.
The student-run record label and the lo-
cal music-streaming startup have anticipated 
working together since last year. They made the 
announcement at a launch party last Friday.
Grooveshark artist coordinator Jason Rubel 
said the pairing is mutually beneﬁ  cial.
“Our service could serve as a powerful tool 
for the label to get these artists off the ground,” 
he said. “They have an inﬂ  uence in Gainesville, and we can harness that brand or brand aware-ness in the town that Grooveshark was found-ed over a decade ago.”
Grooveshark is now global, with more than 
30 million users. Student Government Produc-tions launched Swamp Records in Fall 2013. 
Breana Auberry,  Swamp Records president 
and co-founder, said Grooveshark approached Swamp Records ﬁ  rst. From there, the partner-ship came naturally.
“We bring our artists, and we help bring the 
UF crowd,” Auberry said. “They bring their na-tional level of exposure and their expertise and history to the table.”
Rubel said Grooveshark was interested in 
Swamp Records because of its relationship 
with UF and the Gainesville community.
“We especially found it appealing to help 
out a local startup that had similar values as 
us, and in tandem, support up-and-coming art-ists,” Rubel said.Grooveshark gets new partnerSEE FOOTBALL, PAGE 16

In a search for redemption, former UF Stu-
dent Body President Ben Meyers is taking to 
the Gainesville political circuit once again.
In July, Meyers, 24, ﬁ  led to run as a Demo-
cratic candidate for the Gainesville City Com-
mission’s March election.
His resignation as UF’s Student Body presi-
dent three years ago was littered with rumors 
of under-the-table deals.
Meyers cited personal reasons when he 
resigned in October 2011, but further reports from a 92-page thesis by former UF graduate student Dave Bradshaw revealed more may have been at play.
The report details Greek groups and select 
student organizations allegedly predetermin-ing the upcoming year’s senior Student Gov-ernment positions in a rendezvous location Meyers was quoted calling “The Room.”
Meyers said he now regrets speaking to 
Bradshaw and that some of his comments were taken out of context.
“There’s no scandal there or juicy gossip 
story,” Meyers said.He said his comments in the report were 
accurate, but he resigned because he fell below the SG-required 12-credit minimum.
“There are things in Student Government 
that people do, and it’s a way of learning and growing as an individual,” he said.
Current UF Student Body President Cory 
Yeffet said SG won’t be endorsing Meyers’ campaign because it does not endorse political candidates.
Moving forward, Meyers said he doesn’t 
expect his SG past to avert voters. His cam-
paign will focus on jobs, public safety and 
streamlining government.
“Because of what I’ve been doing to im-
prove our community, people can know that that’s not the way I operate,” Meyers said.
He’s maintained his presence in Gainesville 
as an at-large member of the Democratic Ex-ecutive Committee of Alachua County and the 
city’s Board of Adjustment.
Michael Christ, a 21-year-old UF political 
science graduate student and the SG Senate 
minority leader, said corruption within stu-dent government is a known fact among its members, and he expects it will play a role in Meyers’ campaign.
“People are complicated,” Christ said. “I 
don’t think it’s a black and white, good and evil thing. People will do pretty much what-ever they have to do to get where they want on Student Government.”
Christ was involved in three SG campaign 
cycles since 2012 and said he questions Mey-ers’ switch to the Democratic Party after being well-known as a conservative Republican at 
UF.
Meyers said his party-switch reﬂ  ects a return to his family’s Democratic afﬁ  liation, 
which he strayed from while in college. He said he intends to leave ideology out of his 
campaign.
“I think that when you look at local issues, 
there’s really no room for ideology,” Meyers 
said. “It’s really looking at what’s best on a case-by-case basis.”
Jenna Goldman, a 21-year-old UF politi-
cal science and history senior, said Meyers’ change in party, youth and transient ties to Gainesville make it difﬁ  cult to trust his candi-
dacy.
“I ﬁ  rmly believe we should have a voice on 
the City Commission because students make 
up such a large part of the Gainesville com-munity,” Goldman, a former Students Party president, said. “At the same time, I’m not go-ing to vote for just any old student, especially one with the record that he has.”
But Meyers insists he has a “deep apprecia-
tion for the community” where his family has lived for generations.
“Gainesville feels like home,” the Miami 
native said.
Still, only 1.4 percent of his campaign con-
tributions have come from Gainesville, with 
nearly all the rest originating from South Flor-
ida, according to voterfocus.com. 
“We just don’t know if he’s right for the po-
sition,” Goldman said. “What makes us trust him again?”
Former UF Student Body Presidents Tj Vil-
lamil, now the special assistant to UF Presi-dent Bernie Machen, declined to comment, and Christina Bonarrigo could not be reached 
for comment.MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 3

vous, conﬁ  dent and excited she could help sexual assault 
victims.
“Even though you’re just a voice on a phone, your 
voice actually helps someone calm down and ﬁ  nd direc-
tion,” said Michelle, who asked that her last name not be 
disclosed.The center is currently seeking volunteers like Michelle 
to serve as hotline counselors. Volunteer duties include 
answering the center’s after-hour crisis phone lines, said 
Laura Kalt, the center’s sexual assault program manager.
There is no educational background requirement. 
“We have people with degrees or with no educational 
experience,” Kalt said. “It’s about them being able to sup-
port a person without trying to take control of the situa-
tion.”
An application, available on the Victim Services and 
Rape Crisis Center website, is required to apply.Volunteers begin their six to eight weeks of training 
with an online course through the Florida Council Against Sexual Violence. Training includes one-on-one sessions and interactive roleplaying before starting a minimum of 
nine months at the center. 
“I think this type of work is humbling almost,” said 
Kristen Gerken, a 21-year-old UF psychology student. “It 
not only helps the victims but the volunteers as well.”Rape crisis center seeks hotline volunteers for after-hours calls

2012

Alligator Staff Writer mmihm@alligator.org
Ninety people were ejected and eight 
were arrested at the Florida Gators’ 
Southeastern Conference-opening foot-
ball game against the University of Ken-
tucky on Saturday at Ben Hill Griffin Sta-dium.
Of the 90 individuals who were ejected 
from the game, 48 were UF students, ac-cording to a press release from University Police. 
Three of the eight arrests were also UF 
students.
Twenty-two of the ejections were for 
disorderly conduct and 19 were for ticket switching. Eleven people were ejected for 
sitting in the wrong section, seven for at-tending the game without a ticket, six for sitting in the student section with non-student tickets, eight for possession of al-
cohol and another eight for intoxication.
There were also three ejections for 
smoking, two for standing on the bleach-ers, one for stealing from a vendor, two 
for throwing objects and one for urinating 
on a wall.
Of the eight arrests, four were for tres-
passing after warning. There was also one 
arrest made for disorderly conduct, one 
for resisting without violence and two for battery.
The number of individuals arrested 
and ejected from Saturday’s game was almost three times as much as last week, where 32 people were ejected and one was arrested while the Gators played Eastern 
Michigan University. 
It was also the most arrests made at a 
game since the 2012 football season.90 ejected, 8 arrested at game

UF veterinary students could be 
receiving a break as the American 
Veterinary Medical Association works toward implementing new legislation on federal loan interest rates. 
The American Veterinary 
Medical Association (AVMA) is pushing to lower the 6.8 percent interest rate for graduate students utilizing the federal Stafford Loan program.
More than 90 percent of veteri-
nary students at UF require some form of financial aid to pay the yearly tuition of $28,630 for Flori-da residents, according to the UF College of Veterinary Medicine website.
“I think right now we are at a 
crisis,” said Maureen Long, asso-ciate professor at UF’s College of Veterinary Medicine. “The loan burden is higher than what some-body probably pays in a year for rent.” 
Janna Legg, a 27-year-old third-
year UF veterinary student, said she relies solely on loans to pay for tuition, room and board. 
“I think it is crucial this legisla-
tion be passed for current veteri-nary medicine students and those who are to come,” she said.
Legg said she often receives no-
tifications telling her that she is ac-
cruing $12 in interest a day. 
According to the California Veterinary Medical Association, 28 
percent of veterinarians might not have pursued the field if they had known about the student debt.
But for students like Maria 
Moriyon, a 20-year-old UF biol-ogy junior, the cost will not get in the way of applying to veterinary school. 
“I have worked and planned to 
attend veterinary school, no matter the cost,” Moriyon said.

� IT’S CALLED FLORIDA POLITICAL REVIEW.
MARIA ESPINOZA
Alligator Contributing Writer 
Two UF students have launched a website called 
the Florida Political Review. 
The website discusses current affairs and politi-
cal issues facing Florida. 
The Florida Political Review is a student orga-
nization that has partnered with the Bob Graham 
Center for Public Service, said Sheila Dickison, in-terim director for academic programs at the Gra-ham Center. 
Website co-founder Corrado Minardi, a 22-year-
old UF political science and Chinese senior, said more than 20 students are now participating after their first meeting last Thursday.  
“We hope this will serve to get people more in-
terested in Florida politics,” Minardi said. “We also 
had the perception that, in general, the Student 
Body was not very aware of what happens politi-cally in Florida. Our purpose is to create a space so students can share ideas and become engaged.”
Minardi said he hopes to see the publication in 
print next semester. 
Mireille Lamourt, a 20-year-old UF journalism 
junior, attended the first meeting to learn about how she could contribute.  
“If something is going to directly affect some-
one,” Lamourt said, “they should get the most in-formation in the easiest format.”Students launch political website

As midterm elections ap-
proach, UF is encouraging 
students to sign up with the online voting resource, Tur-boVote.
TurboVote partnered with 
UF and 40 other Florida col-leges through the Florida Col-lege System.
Since UF’s partnership 
with TurboVote in 2012, about 3,800 students have signed up to either register to vote, re-quest absentee ballots or set 
up reminders for all elections 
in their area through email or text message.
“Our platform was built 
around the idea that register-ing to vote and requesting absentee ballots should be as easy as using Netflix or online banking,” said Adrienne Le-
ver, the director for strategic 
partnerships at TurboVote.
UF is ranked No. 2 in the 
country for registering stu-dents with TurboVote.
In a September email to the 
UF community, UF President Bernie Machen urged voters to use TurboVote.
“Fewer than half of the 
millennials in Florida were registered to vote in the 2010 midterm elections,” Machen said.
After users sign up with 
TurboVote, all required docu-ments are mailed to them pre-completed, preaddressed and prestamped. Voters then have 
to sign the documents and put 
them in the mail.
“I’ve participated in all lo-
cal elections since our partner-ship in 2012 because they’ve made it so easy,” said Shelby Taylor, the communications director for the Bob Graham Center for Public Service.
In 2012, more than 75 per-
cent of first-time voters, and more than 80 percent of re-turning voters who used Tur-boVote voted, Lever said. 
“TurboVote makes me 
want to get more involved with elections,” said Abby Gears, an 18-year-old UF 
health science freshman.Students asked to

There will be a two-drink maximum
checkpoints: one at the gate and one 
when purchasing a drink, McDaniel said. 
Those 21 and older are limited to 
two drinks, which are provided by Aramark.
“We really want to make sure 
that, since this is the first year,” Mc-Daniel said. “everything is extreme-ly controlled, and nothing gets out of hand.” 
“We’re not getting ourselves into 
a bad situation,” she said.
The garden will be part of a con-
cession area with food trucks like Monsta Lobsta, Kona Dog and Am-eraucana Wood Fire for guests to enjoy before the live entertainment from Ludacris, Foster the People 
and former SNL performer Brooks 
Wheelan.  
“I think for those that are of 
age, it’s fun to get dinner and have a glass of wine or a beer with it,” McDaniel said. “And I think this is a value-add. It’s another thing that makes this experience such a great University of Florida tradition.” 
“I think this is so conducive of the 
festival feel and students being able to hang out and have fun with their friends, enjoy the music and enjoy being part of this university and The Gator Nation,” she added.
Haley Doyle, Growl associate 
producer of communications, said 
students will be 
excited about the 
addition.
“I know that’s 
something we 
wished we could always have in the stadium,” Doyle said. “It will give the show that fun 
festival, pep rally feel.” 
“I think it’s going to bring a lot of 
people out,” she said.

BEIRUT  — Islamic State extrem-
ists released a video showing the be-
heading of British aid worker David Haines, who was abducted in Syria last year, and British Prime Minis-
ter David Cameron late Saturday 
condemned his slaying as “an act of pure evil.”
Cameron confirmed Haines’ 
death in a statement after the British Foreign Office had said earlier that it was “working urgently to verify the video.” Haines is the third West-erner beheaded in recent weeks by 
the Islamic State group, which has 
seized vast swaths of territory in Syria and Iraq.
“This is a despicable and appall-
ing murder of an innocent aid work-er. It is an act of pure evil,” Cameron 
said, adding that “my heart goes out 
to the family of David Haines who have shown extraordinary courage and fortitude throughout this or-deal.”
The video emerged a day after 
Haines’ family issued a public plea late Friday urging his captors to con-tact them.
At the end of the video show-
ing the beheading of Sotloff, the Is-lamic State group threatened to kill Haines next and briefly showed him on camera. The group threatened to kill another British captive. Both British men were dressed in orange jumpsuits against an arid Syrian landscape, similar to that seen in the 
Foley and Sotloff videos.
His killer says in the video that 
Haines was paying the price for Brit-
ain’s decision to supply weapons to Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, who are battling the Islamic State group in northern Iraq. He references U.S. airstrikes against Islamic State fight-ers near the Haditha Dam in western 
Iraq, which the U.S. began targeting 
on Sept. 7 — indicating that Haines’ killing took place sometime during the past week.
The British government had 
managed to keep Haines’ kidnap-ping secret out of concern for his safety until the Sotloff beheading video identified him as a captive 
and the next victim.
Haines, 44, was abducted near 
a refugee camp in northern Syria 
in March 2013 while working for the French international aid agency ACTED which was helping thou-sands of Syrians displaced by the fighting between Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces and rebel 
groups, including the Islamic State, 
seeking to oust him. 
Mike Haines said in a statement 
that his brother was devoted to hu-manitarian work.
“David was most alive and 
enthusiastic in his humanitarian roles,” Mike Haines said. “His joy and anticipation for the work he 
went to do in Syria is for myself and 
family the most important element of this whole sad affair. He was and is loved by all his family and will be missed terribly.”

The lights are off in a shop with 
cupcake-freckled walls. The red 
countertops are bare, and the doors are locked. 
Sarkara Sweets, whose gluten-
free and vegan cupcakes were sold on UF’s P.O.D. Market shelves, offi-cially closed its doors in downtown Gainesville. 
Next door, Sarkara owners and 
27-year-old twins Stephanie and Su-san Browning packed and prepared to move out of their boutique, Inge-nue Avenue, which also closed.
“We are not closing because we 
wanted more money but because there wasn’t enough traffic,” Steph-anie said.
This past summer was a hard 
one, she said. They got used to bad weather during their busiest hours, which was after 7 p.m. 
“Rain wrecked our night foot traffic,” Stephanie said. 
Angela Sexton, a 19-year-old UF 
pre-occupational therapy sopho-
more, said she liked that Sarkara 
Sweets accommodated different di-ets.
“I am kind of surprised because I 
am so used to seeing their cupcakes in the P.O.D.,” Sexton said. Her fa-vorite was the vanilla cupcake.
Aramark, UF’s food service pro-
vider, approached Sarkara Sweets 
with the opportunity to sell the cup-
cakes in the P.O.D. Market. After six months of planning, the Brownings began delivering cupcakes to the markets all around campus.
Fall had always promised an 
increase in sales, but this semester proved to be different. Where the sisters once made about $4,000 dur-
ing Sorority Recruitment Week, this 
year, they made less than $200.
After five years of doing the same 
thing every day, Stephanie said the dates have become a blur for her.The idea to open a cupcake shop 
first sparked in their minds when they were 20. At the time, there was 
no cupcake shop in the city, Stepha-
nie said. They saw the opportunity.
One year later, at 21, the sisters 
opened the store, with the sanskrit-inspired name Sarkara Sweets.
Stephanie said she does not re-
member much of opening day. She does remember it as hectic because they opened earlier than expected.
However, the time spent at 201 
SE Second Ave. was not a waste.
“I’ve learned a lot more about 
business and how to approach it in a more cost-effective manner,” Steph-anie said.
Stephanie obtained a degree in 
classics, and Susan received a degree in anthropology at UF in 2009.
Stephanie didn’t have to think 
twice when asked about the best-selling cupcake.

A 24-year-old man 
drowned in the Stoneridge 
Apartment complex pool early Saturday morning. His body was found at the bottom of the pool at about 5 a.m.
About 30 minutes prior, 
Gainesville Police officers re-sponded to a noise complaint at the pool and told people to leave, said GPD spokesman Officer Ben Tobias.
Shortly after, two people 
returned to the area to re-trieve items when they saw the man’s body at the bottom and called 911. His identity is being withheld until his fam-ily overseas is contacted.
Upon arrival at the complex 
located at 3800 SW 34th St., GPD Officer Ahipo Doualehi 
jumped in the pool and pulled 
the victim out. Gainesville Fire 
Rescue arrived at the same 
time and began to administer 
CPR.
The man was pronounced 
dead at UF Health Shands 
Hospital’s emergency room.

A Gainesville man was 
stabbed by his girlfriend after 
he tried to strangle her during 
an argument this weekend.
Willie Ross Jr. hit and 
pushed his girlfriend onto a bed before wrapping his 
hands around her neck and 
choking her, Tobias said.
The victim was unable to 
breathe and began flailing her arms around the bed, grab-
bing the first thing she felt: a 
pair of heavy-duty scissors.
The victim hit Ross with 
the scissors several times be-fore stabbing him behind his 
ear and in his left buttock, To-bias said.
When GPD officers re-
sponded to the call at 2626 E. University Ave., Ross instead told officers he was jumped and stabbed by six or seven men outside his apartment, Tobias said.
Ross was admitted to 
Shands. His charges were turned over to the Depart-ment of Justice staff.

A Gainesville woman tried 
to stab her daughter after an argument Saturday.
At about 3:30 p.m., Asia 
M. Delaine, 17, punched her mother, Blanko Shanacye Evens, 41, in the face. The two women fought until they were pulled apart by family and 
friends.
After the fight, Evens went 
inside her apartment and 
locked the door, leaving De-
laine outside.
Delaine then punched out 
a window.
Evens then grabbed a knife, 
attempting to stab Delaine on 
the balcony. The two were pulled apart by family and friends once more.
GPD responded to the 
armed disturbance at the For-est Green Apartment complex, located at 3501 NE 15th St.
Delaine had minor lac-
erations on her hand and was transported to Shands for treatment. A sworn complaint for domestic violence was filed against her.
Evens was arrested and 
charged with domestic aggra-vated assault.Police Roundup:

conservative icon 
to go bad
In February 2012, George Zimmerman, the neighborhood 
watch coordinator for his gated community in Sanford, Flor-ida, shot and killed Trayvon Martin, an unarmed African-
American teenager.
After initially being allowed to go free, Zimmerman was ar-
rested, charged with second-degree murder and eventually ac-quitted. During and after his trial, Zimmerman became a hero of the conservative movement. Sean Hannity of Fox News, one of the most powerful voices in conservative media, called the Zim-merman trial “purely political.”
Alex Seitz-Wald wrote in Salon that Ann Coulter, tea party 
nation founder Judson Phillips and David Horowitz are just a few of the conservative ﬁ  gures who portrayed Zimmerman as the victim of a “left-wing media ‘lynch mob.’”
The most positive thing that could possibly be said about 
Zimmerman is that he acted in self-defense when he shot and killed a 17-year-old. Even if that is what happened, what is it about Zimmerman that made him such a conservative darling?
Unfortunately for his fans in the conservative media, Zim-
merman has managed to destroy any remnants of a positive rep-utation that existed following his acquittal in the Martin case.
After domestic violence-related arrests in 2013, Zimmerman 
took his behavior to a new low last week when he allegedly 
threatened to kill a driver during a road rage incident in Lake 
Mary. The driver later called 911 to report that Zimmerman was waiting in his car outside the driver’s place of employment.
Interestingly, despite Zimmerman’s repeated arrests, none 
of his victims — including his girlfriend — have ever agreed to press charges. It is impossible to know the motivations of these individuals, but it seems at least plausible that their inaction stems from fear of Zimmerman.
Zimmerman isn’t the ﬁ  rst conservative role model whose 
reputation has quickly gone sour.
Cliven Bundy, a Nevada rancher, became involved in a dis-
pute with federal agents from the U.S. Bureau of Land Manage-ment after 20 years of refusing to pay grazing fees for his use of federal lands. Bundy quickly became a conservative symbol of anti-taxation and liberty, and his hero status persisted even after he and his supporters pointed weapons at federal agents.
Only after video footage emerged of Bundy discussing “the 
Negro” and asserting that black people were better off under 
slavery than they are today did the conservative media break off 
their love affair with the troubled rancher.
The point here isn’t to suggest that liberal and Democratic 
icons are blameless or even necessarily worthy of imitation. However, it says something about the conservative movement that the individuals it holds up as heroes, like Zimmerman and Bundy, consistently demonstrate violent and ignorant behavior, often in combination.
At the very least, conservatives should stop and evaluate 
these individuals more carefully and thoughtfully before erect-ing shrines in their honor.
Social justice requires continuous anger
I was once told that the decision-makers of our society 
often hope the public will lose interest in important is-sues before they are forced to do anything about them.
The devaluation of black life in the U.S. is an issue that 
is important to many Americans. People of color empa-
thize with the victims of racism and their families. Our 
white allies see the injustices and stand beside us, hoping to help in our efforts to bring about meaningful change.
Trayvon Martin was a household name for a long time 
following his murder in 2012 at the hands of George Zim-merman. The public was enraged at Zimmerman’s acquit-tal in 2013, and Florida’s Stand Your Ground law faced scrutiny as Martin remained a household name for weeks. It wasn’t long, though, before Martin’s name got lost in 
the shufﬂ  e.
People returned to their ordinary lives: class, work, 
civic organizations or family; all institutions more famil-
iar and salient to them than the devaluation of black life in America. The ﬁ  re that had so passionately burned for social justice is reduced to embers unless a new incident becomes a prodder and pokes at the coals.
So many high-proﬁ  le examples of racism and discrimi-
nation have taken place in just the last few months.
The shooting of Michael Brown by a police ofﬁ  cer in 
Ferguson, Missouri, was the catalyst for new conversations about racism and violence in America. People compared the case to the Martin shooting in its demonstration of the utter lack of respect for the lives of young black men.
Allies in the U.S. and around the world used social me-
dia platforms to voice their support for Brown, his fam-ily and the struggle of African-Americans for justice and equality.
The public outcry against racial proﬁ  ling and sup-
pression of the media by law enforcement made national headlines. People were vocally and visibly angry with the system.
Another African-American male, John Crawford, was 
recently killed while holding a toy riﬂ  e in an Ohio Wal-Mart. Ohio is a permissive open-carry state, so it would have been completely in Crawford’s rights to carry an ac-tual gun if he had proper licens-ing and chose to do so. People were enraged when Crawford’s right to bear arms and his right to life were both ignored when 
a 911 caller falsely perceived 
Crawford as a threat for his pos-session of a BB gun.
Most recently, Darrien Hunt 
was killed by police ofﬁ  cers in 
Utah after 911 callers described him as “suspicious” for doing nothing more than walking by their businesses on a Wednesday morning.  Police shot him for brandishing what they called a sword, which his mother described as a 
harmless toy souvenir. Hunt’s mom, who is white, is cer-
tain that she knows why her son is dead, saying, “They killed my son because he’s black. No white boy with a little sword would they shoot while he’s running away.” 
It’s easy to be angry when stories like these are in the 
headlines, and this anger is important. Without it, there will never be the groundswell of public support needed to enact substantive social and political change.
However, social and racial injustice exists throughout 
America and manifests itself on a daily basis. To change this cycle of injustice, we must remain angry and insistent that racism in America is brought to an end.
The morning my parents left after settling me into my 
residence hall room for my ﬁ  rst year at UF, I remember the warning my dad gave me. He told me to be careful and to always remember that there were things other people could get away with that I couldn’t because I am black. 
That made me very angry.
Ferguson is no longer a trending topic, and the anger 
that Michael Brown’s shooting caused has begun to fade 
from the public consciousness.
Our inability to remain continuously angry about these 
issues is a major obstacle toward the change sought by ad-vocates for social and racial justice.

Without the men and 
women who serve in the 
U.S. armed forces, we 
wouldn’t be able to enjoy the free-
doms many of us take for granted 
on a daily basis. A typical reaction from an 
American when they see someone in uniform is to thank them for their service and sacrifice. 
But recently, one school had a very different 
reaction.
Last week, Lt. Col. Sherwood Baker stopped 
by his daughter’s high school to clear up an is-sue she was having with her class schedule. As he was walking on the campus, he was stopped 
by a security guard and was told that he could 
not enter because the military uniform he was wearing might offend somebody.
His wife, Rachel Ferhadson, said that he 
was given a choice. He could “phone in to the office or go home and change his clothes.” Af-
ter that, Baker left the school and called the 
superintendent’s office. Shortly after, a staff member met him the parking lot and allowed 
him on campus.
The district’s superintendent, Robert Shan-
er, a former combat Marine, said “the district does not have a policy excluding individuals 
in uniform” and went on to apologize for the misunderstanding.
Baker accepted their apology, but we 
shouldn’t just let an incident occur without ob-jection. What is happening in America when 
someone might find someone else in military 
uniform offensive?
Although some may not agree with every 
initiative our military undertakes, we should never be offended by those who put their lives on the line so that millions of people can live 
their lives in one of the freest countries on 
Earth.
This isn’t the only recent event where po-
litical correctness went completely overboard. At a high school in California, Chick-fil-A was banned from selling chicken sandwiches in 
conjunction with the football booster club be-
cause the sandwiches might offend somebody.
The high school’s principal, Val Wyatt, said 
that “with their political stance on gay rights and because the students of Ventura High School and their parents would be at the event, 
I didn’t want them on campus.”
The principal’s decision was backed by the 
district’s superintendent, Trudy Tuttle Ariaga, who said that “we value inclusivity 
and diversity on our campus, and 
all our events and activities are go-
ing to adhere to our mission.”
Ariagas’ stance is clearly con-
tradictory. She cannot ban the football boost-er club’s partner, Chick-fil-A, based upon its founder’s opinion on gay marriage and then 
also preach that she and her school district are 
open-minded and “diverse.”
Diversity means being made up of people 
or things that are different from each other. Some liberals tend to confuse diversity with uniformity, leading to a dangerous attitude of 
closed-mindedness and exclusion. 
If the superintendent really meant what she 
said about welcoming diversity, she would realize the decision to ban Chick-fil-A from 
campus was in poor judgment and should be reversed.
We must avoid shutting people down when 
their opinions don’t completely align with our own. Different opinions offer opportunities to 
learn from one another. Ben Carson, former 
John Hopkins pediatric neurosurgeon and po-tential 2016 Republican presidential candidate, 
described the PC police perfectly: “You need 
to go out and talk to people. Everybody you know, have a discussion. Don’t let the left shut 
you up.”
All this political correctness might be ac-
ceptable if our education system took neu-tral stances and taught our children without 
discrimination and bias. Unfortunately, this doesn’t always happen. 
Last week, a sixth-grade teacher in Wash-
ington, D.C., sent students home with a Venn diagram homework assignment where they 
were supposed to compare former President 
George W. Bush and former mass murder Adolf Hitler. For this educator to suggest that 
any U.S. president is comparable to a man who 
killed millions of people based upon his twist-ed ideology is downright reprehensible. 
We need to reject political correctness and 
stop choosing to be offended by anything and everything. The Declaration of Independence 
says that all people are guaranteed life, liberty 
and the pursuit of happiness. It does not guar-antee that we will always feel comfortable.

By now, we 
should all have heard about the 
serial assaults happen-ing on our campus. Three women so far have been at-tacked. Like my fellow female stu-
dents, I am angry and scared. This 
is a gendered issue: misogyny 
and  rape culture. Few men could 
understand the horror, paranoia, nervousness and fear that comes over many women when we think 
about this issue.
However, these painful emo-
tions only scratch the surface of 
what women at UF have experi-enced. The recent assaults tie into 
the overarching climate of victim 
blaming that defines our univer-
sity. A week ago , I attended an 
event on the Plaza of the Ameri-
cas called No Gator Walks Alone. At the event, there were banners that students could sign, pledg-
ing to never walk alone. Cory 
Yeffet, our Student Body presi-dent, urged us to “be aware of our surroundings,” “take precau-tions” and “never walk without a 
partner.”
As a woman, I know what I 
need to do to keep myself safe. I have lived my whole life being 
told to “take care of myself,” “al-ways be aware of my surround-ings” and “never stay out too 
late.” Every young girl is raised 
with these phrases hammered into her head. We are brought up in a world that normalizes vio-lence against women. 
What I would like to know is: 
Where was the condemnation of the men who are as-saulting women? I have not heard one 
word from adminis-
tration condemning 
sexual violence or rape. My whole life, I have always taken precau-
tions to guard myself from sexual 
assault, but that still has not kept 
me from being victimized by rape 
culture on very personal levels.
I am exhausted from being 
constantly told that it is my fault. 
I have a right to exist on this cam-
pus, as does every other woman. We have a right to study at the library past sunset, to attend our events in the evenings and to par-
ty late into the night if we want to. 
I shouldn’t have to rearrange my 
existence simply because UF isn’t 
calling out sexual violence for 
what it is. And I shouldn’t be told to simply “walk with a partner.” Sometimes, I have to walk alone.
These past two weeks, I have 
seen no serious criticism of rape culture or misogyny. I have felt burdened by victim blaming from not only my peers, but UF fac-
ulty and specifically University 
Police. I’ve had enough of it. I attend this university, and I give 
it my all through my community 
work. I have a right to walk alone, to walk at night, to exist without fear of being assaulted simply be-
cause of my gender. Until we dis-
mantle the rape culture that is so pervasive in our community and attack the core problem that is mi-sogyny, none of us will be safe.

Speaking Out
Guns have a unique place in the 
heart of American culture. The Second Amendment is hailed as a 
symbol of freedom from oppression and a lasting testament to American dedication to individual rights. As much as we often 
enjoy guns and our right to possess them, 
they are undoubtedly dangerous tools in the wrong hands — criminal or not.
When asked to think of a dangerous 
situation involving guns, most of us likely 
imagine war, being mugged or attempted 
murder. However, weapons do not only need to be in the hands of a criminal for a situation to be dangerous.
At the end of August, a 9 year old at 
The Last Stop shooting range in Arizona accidentally killed her instructor, Charles Vacca, with an Uzi. Her 39-year-old in-structor was a veteran, well-trained and 
familiar with weapons.
The 9-year-old, who was on vacation 
with her family, was on a tour with a com-
pany called Bullets and Burgers that took the group to the shooting range to fire a variety of automatic weapons. The range allowed 
children as young as 8 years 
old to participate in the range activities, and there are no state regula-
tions concerning the age limit for handling 
a weapon.
The young girl fired her weapon once 
in semi-automatic mode before switching to automatic with the instructor’s per-
mission. In a flash, the girl lost control of 
the weapon’s massive recoil, injuring her shoulder, and the barrel jumped to her in-structor’s head.
The tragic situation could have easily 
been avoided. Many people are heavily split on the issue of gun control, but simple gun safety could have prevented this situ-ation and others like it from occurring.
Many children in America are taught 
gun safety at a very young age. Guns are a part of American culture, and firing a rifle or shotgun before the age of 10 is not un-common. However, the differ-ence between a semi-automat-ic, long-barreled weapon and a 
powerful, fully automatic Uzi 
is hard to put into words.
A somewhat similar accident occurred 
at a gun show in 2008, where an 8-year-old boy lost control of an Uzi. The recoil from his weapon ended up directing the barrel to his own head, killing him.
Simply put, 8-year-olds and 9-year-olds 
do not have the mass or muscles to handle the powerful recoil of an automatic Uzi, much less the experience. Many young children are responsibly taught to handle 
shotguns and rifles for the sake of gun ed-
ucation and safety. 
However, there is not a responsible 
method or reasonable purpose to hand a child an automatic weapon that they can-
not even hold steadily.
A range near The Last Stop has a simi-
lar policy. Range 702 has a 4-foot height 
requirement for children, and it also re-quires that children master easier to han-dle, safer weapons like a semi-automatic .22-caliber rifle.
Vacca was not certified as a firearms 
trainer by the NRA, nor is there a require-ment in Arizona for gun range instructors 
to be certified. It’s hard to say whether the 
military veteran would have been more prepared if he had been certified, but it is also hard to see why this situation was al-lowed to occur.
Most Americans understand that guns 
can be a source of sport, safety and food, but also that they require a great amount of respect, care and safety as well. Hand-
ing an Uzi to a young girl disregards all of 
that for the sake of a good time.
A little common sense should have pre-
vented a little girl from being scarred and a man from losing his life, but sometimes 
safety doesn’t always come first.

� FLORIDA IS DEPEN -
DENT ON SALES TAXES.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
TALLAHASSEE — A new 
report says a rising concen-
tration of income among the 
nation’s richest households 
is a problem for Florida be-cause it is one of 10 states most dependent on sales 
taxes.
Florida has no state in-
come tax, and its major 
source of revenue is a 6 per-cent sales tax.
The report by credit rat-
ings agency Standard & Poor’s notes that the annual growth rate in the state’s 
sales tax has dropped dra-
matically over the last three decades. The annual rate was 11.25 percent in the 1980s, but it has dropped since then 
and is averaging just below 2 
percent since 2009.
Most economic activity 
comes from consumer spend-
ing, a key driver of growth. 
But consumers have become increasingly reluctant to spend as median incomes have barely increased over 
three decades and remain 
lower than they were in 2007 when the Great Recession be-gan. Florida’s median family 
income, according to recent 
U.S. Census data, is about $46,000 a year.
By contrast, the top 1 
percent of earners has pros-
pered for more than 30 years. 
Adjusted for inflation, their average incomes have nearly tripled to $1.26 million since 
1979, according to the IRS.
But S&P notes that wealth-
ier individuals tend to spend 
less of their money, mean-ing that states are unlikely to see much of an increase in sales tax collections. The top 5 percent in Florida have 
an average income of nearly 
$307,000.
Florida’s own economists, 
however, continue to predict steady and sustained state 
revenue growth in the next 
several years. More recent numbers show that taxes are growing between 4 percent 
and 5 percent annually.
They also say that the state 
is shielded because state cof-
fers are dependent on tour-ists and a continued influx of 
retirees moving to the state. 
A new three-year financial outlook predicts that state legislators will have enough 
money to pay for schools and 
health care and still have a small surplus.
Amy Baker, the coordi-
nator of the state’s Office of 
Economic and Demographic 
Research, notes that as much as 15 percent of the state’s sales tax collections come 
from tourists.
“That provides in normal 
times a buffer a lot of other 
states wouldn’t have,” Baker said.
Economists also say that 
the wave of baby boomer re-tirements that began earlier this decade will also have a 
positive impact on the state’s 
coffers. Baker said that there will be a surge in spending as they move to the state. 
Florida’s major tax source 
remains the sales tax. But the state also collects corporate income taxes, taxes on insur-ance premiums, gas taxes, 
alcohol taxes, tobacco taxes 
and fees placed on automo-biles.Tourism, retirees

UF’s Center for Entrepreneurship & Innovation has an-
nounced a formal partnership with local startup collective 
Starter Space.
Starter Space will offer four internships to UF graduate 
students pursuing a master’s degree in entrepreneurship. 
The partnership will include a speakers series, work-
shops for aspiring entrepreneurs and promotion of Starter 
Space’s activities on UF’s campus. 
Michael Morris, James W. Walter Eminent Scholar Chair and academic director of the entrepreneurship program at 
UF, said the center wants to contribute to the growing start-
up atmosphere and see more ventures stay in Gainesville.
“As we looked around at the local landscape, we were 
especially excited about Starter Space, what they represent, their sort of mantra and outlook and attitude and every-
thing,” he said. “It’s very consistent with our own.”
Ashley Dean, a 22-year-old UF student working on her 
master’s in entrepreneurship, is planning on attending the first speaker event and workshop.
“It’s more of a hands-on approach to speaker series, so I think I’m looking forward to that more than anything,” she said.
Jeffrey Stamp, creator and brand manager of Baked 
Lays, specializes in creative business processes. He will be 
the first speaker in the series on Tuesday evening.
Starter Space collaborates with eight startups, including 
the digital publication GainesvilleScene. 
Payal Khurana, co-founder and partner at Starter Space, 
said the company has always wanted to create a bridge between Starter Space and UF to get students more in-volved.
“Us having the same mission and doing something to-
gether creates a stronger force, creates a brighter light for 
students to have to say, ‘OK, entrepreneurship is an actual, 
feasible route for me,’” she said.Starter Space partners with UF for internships, workshops

ALEXIA FERNANDEZ
Alligator Staff Writer afernandez@alligator.org
The World Wildlife Fund has awarded a UF 
graduate student a prestigious fellowship for his 
research in ecological conservation.
Anand Roopsind, a third-year UF graduate stu-
dent, was one of 26 students awarded the 2014 Rus-sell E. Train Fellowship. Roopsind, 30, received the fellowship for identifying sustainable ways to re-
duce deforestation.
A native of Guyana, Roopsind met Francis Putz, 
a professor at the UF Department of Biology, while 
studying in South America.
“I was the one that convinced him to come to 
UF,” Putz said. “I think that the award was very well deserved with his skill level and capacity. He’s a very good investment.”
Roopsind’s love of the outdoors and conserva-
tion stemmed from his early childhood as he played in the countryside by his grandparent’s home.Roopsind has grown accustomed to the city life 
in Gainesville, but he still considers South America 
his primary research site and hopes to return.
“It’s definitely something that I’m working on,” 
he said about his research. “I think that’s going to 
be part of my long-term development and moving toward going back home as well.”
The fund awards graduate students fellowships 
to pursue graduate degrees in conservation-related fields around the world.
The organization looks for graduate students 
with academic credentials, professional qualifica-tions and commitment to working in their country of origin, said fellowship director Andrea Santy.
“We’re looking for people who are leaders,” 
she said, “people who have really compelling re-
search.”
With the fellowship, Roopsind can receive up to 
three years of funding with a maximum amount of 
$30,000 per year.
Roopsind expects to graduate in 2017 and hopes 
to intern for the World Wildlife Fund after he re-ceives his doctorate degree.
“I’m optimistic,” he said. “My fellowship is for 
three years, so it’s perfect timing as I move toward 
the end of my five years of studying at UF. It’s a 
great incentive.”Graduate student receives WWF   
fellowship for conservation research
“I think that the award was very well 
deserved with his skill level and capacity. 
He’s a very good investment.”

The Gators’ secondary couldn’t decide 
what it wanted to be Saturday night.
In Florida’s 36-30 triple-overtime victory 
against Kentucky, coach Will Muschamp’s 
“talent over experience” defensive backﬁ  eld had its share of highlights — such as Keanu 
Neal’s two interceptions and Brian Poole’s 
crucial deﬂ  ection in the third overtime.
But it was the secondary that nearly cost 
Florida the win in the ﬁ  rst place. 
The Wildcats’ 369 passing yards were the 
most allowed by a Gators defense since Michi-gan threw for 373 yards on Jan. 1, 2008.
“We’ve just got to tie some things up in the 
secondary,” Muschamp said after the game. “They had six big plays for 173 yards. ... That 
was very frustrating.”
Kentucky quarterback Patrick Towles 
threw three touchdown passes ranging from 
25 to 60 yards that gave his team the lead in each occasion. Towles found wide receiver Garrett Johnson twice in the third quarter for scores and Stanley Williams once in overtime.
But besides the scoring, it was the big plays 
on third down that had Muschamp most dis-appointed in his secondary Saturday night.
Late in the third quarter, Florida had Ken-
tucky backed up on its own 37-yard line facing third-and-10. The Gators had just grabbed a three-point advantage and a defensive stop in the Wildcats’ territory would have generated some much-needed momentum.
Instead, blown assignments by Duke Daw-
son and Keanu Neal gave Towles a wide-open target in Johnson for a 30-yard pickup. Towles 
went back to Johnson for a 33-yard touchdown 
on the next play.
And in the fourth quarter with the game 
tied at 20, Kentucky faced a daunting third-and-16 situation on its own 1-yard line. After Darious Cummings sacked Towles for a loss of 12 yards on the previous play, it appeared that UF’s defense would hold to give its offense de-cent ﬁ  eld position to start the next drive.
But once again, loose coverage — this time 
by Marcus Maye — gave Johnson a lane down the middle of the ﬁ  eld and Towles found him for a 22-yard gain.
“We were just soft on coverage on 3rd 
down,” Muschamp said. “And that’s really stupid. And that’s on me. We’ll get it correct-ed.”
Still, two plays after Florida surrendered 
that third-down conversion, Neal came up with his second interception of the game to halt Kentucky’s potential game-winning drive.
And in the third overtime, Towles had an 
opportunity to burn Florida’s secondary once again on a deep pass on third-and-9. But Brian Poole won the 50-50 jump ball over Kentucky’s Dorian Baker, which forced UK to attempt a 41-yard ﬁ  eld goal that was eventually missed.
“That’s a 50-50 ball,” Muschamp said. “I 
know from the stands that looks easy. That’s a really hard thing. It’s a hard task to do some of the things we ask those guys to do.”
Florida’s secondary ﬂ  ashed its talent with 
athletic plays from Neal and Poole, but Mus-
champ said the unit needs to communicate 
better if it expects to limit big plays from other Southeastern Conference opponents.
Throughout fall camp, Muschamp harped 
on his defensive backs — especially his safe-ties — for not corresponding information well enough on the ﬁ  eld, and it showed Saturday.
“Those are things we’ve got to continue to 
work through,” Muschamp said. “We need 
to communicate better on the back end and it 
starts at the safety position.”
JOHNSON’S JOURNAL
What the SEC Network is trying to do is akin to at-
tempting to launch a food truck that sells specialty burgers in the parking lot of a McDonald’s that’s 
run by your father. 
This is where SEC Nation ﬁ  nds itself, a seemingly impos-
sible task of running up against the unquestioned monopoly 
of Saturday morning college football viewership.
Last season, FOX tried its hand at the morning pregame 
market to disastrous results. A weekly audience that aver-
aged 73,000 people was a mere drop in the bucket to ESPN 
College Gameday’s 1.83 million. It’s one of the reasons FOX is out of the Saturday-morning market after only one sea-son. But SEC Nation has three things FOX didn’t have.The ﬁ  rst is the unquestioned 
support and backing of ESPN, the SEC Network’s parent company. Imagine if that food truck you set up was cooking with McDonald’s 
fries and was managed by some-
one who ran some of the Golden Arches’ most successful restau-rants. 
Stephanie Druley is that person, 
the SEC Network’s Vice President 
of Production who runs the ship on SEC Nation and comes from Sunday/Monday Night Countdown, which she was a part of for 16 years.
They travel from city to city like College Gameday does, 
and in the process drum up interest on campus that trans-lates to viewers the may tune in for few minutes. 
If the product is good, people will buy into it.
But SEC Nation’s largest task is just getting you to notice 
them on your way into the drive thru. When you associate 
SEC Nation with College Gameday, you strike a chord with viewers. Students can and did camp out for SEC Nation, something they couldn’t for FOX’s pregame show. 
SEC Nation is on your campus, so the hope is that you’re SEC Nation has support, talent needed for successful runRachel Crosby / Alligator Staff

Analysts have chemistry, knowledge to rival College Gameday
going to tune in for just a little bit. 
That’s when SEC Nation hopes to sink 
its hooks into your eyeballs and reel you in 
with its second advantage.
Plain and simple, the show’s got talent 
and that talent has chemistry in droves. 
Former defensive lineman Marcus Spears 
landed there with a tweet to Druley, asking for a simple follow. 
From there, Spears sent her a direct mes-
sage in order to get an audition, which he nailed on his way to being the most polished analyst on SEC Nation’s set. 
He also has this odd-couple relationship 
with fellow-analyst Paul Finebaum that is downright hilarious to watch play out on 
set. A 315-pound former NFL defensive end 
and a gangly balding 59-year-old man is high comedy. 
Host Joe Tessitore brings his cachet and 
experience to the show as well, steering it back on track when it gets off the rails like his counterpart in the timeslot Chris Fowler. Tessitore is seasoned and he has a recogniz-able voice.
Of course, they pale in comparison to Tim 
Tebow, the one analyst the average fan could name off the top of his or her head with ease before they read this story. He needs extra security wherever he goes, just your run of the mill polarizing sports rock star. 
Both Tebow and Spears digest tape to 
prepare for Saturday mornings with the zeal they once did for Sunday afternoons. They don’t attack opponents anymore, but inform 
a populace. They do this with the pressure 
of Gameday as merely an idea, but not a concrete fact backed up by hard numbers.
As I’ve already stated, College Gameday 
dominates Saturday mornings with close to 2 million eyes, we’ll never know by how much SEC Nation lags behind as it goes through its first season because SEC Net-work isn’t being rated, bringing us to ad-vantage No. 3.
Initially, the decision was to not rate the 
network for an entire year, but for now it’s an indefinite abdication of the metric by which television shows are judged. So while the SEC Network’s new food truck must compete with McDonald’s, they don’t have the external pressure of knowing exactly how far they lag behind the giant, some-thing FOX dealt with in its pregame show launch as well.
You’d taste the burger, you’d watch the 
show and you know that both are different from the monopoly that has a chokehold on the market each is trying to enter. I took an in-person bite of SEC Nation Saturday morning and liked what I ordered, but the problem is I like McDonald’s too. That’s where SEC Nation exists. 
Delivering a similar product that’s very good, but to a consumer base that may not be inclined to switch their taste buds consis-tently.

Fans buzzed about Demarcus 
Robinson following Florida’s 36-30 
triple overtime victory over Ken-tucky.
The sophomore wide receiver 
had a school-record-tying 15 catches 
for 216 yards and two touchdowns, including the game-tying score to 
force a second overtime period.
But there was someone else Sat-
urday night that flew quietly under the radar, and may have been the reason the Gators pulled off their 28th straight victory over the Wild-cats: running back Matt Jones.
Offensive coordinator Kurt 
Roper focused more on the passing game in the first half — the aspect of the offense that worked so well a week ago against Eastern Michigan. 
As a re-
sult of quar-terback Jeff Driskel con-
tinually trying to take shots down the field, Jones had just 63 yards on 
10 carries before the half.In the third quarter, Jones had 
just 9 yards on four carries. 
In the fourth, the junior tailback 
saw touches in only the Gators’ 
opening drive, rushing for 37 yards.
Then the overtime period came, 
and the plays were called with one goal in mind: keep feeding Matt Jones.
“Matt pushes the pile,” coach Will Muschamp said. “He’s 235 pounds and he ended up with about 150 yards rushing, a lot of that was sec-ond contact yardage. When you’re able to get a guy inside … he’s able to lean forward and he’s gonna get you four yards.”
In Florida’s first overtime posses-
sion, down 27-20, Jones rushed for 
20 yards on four carries to set up a 
9-yard Driskel touchdown pass to Robinson to tie the game. 
Jones had just one carry for two 
yards on the second overtime drive that resulted in a Frankie Velez 20-yard field goal to give Florida a 30-27 lead as Kentucky took over for their possession.  
Kentucky’s 41-yard field goal 
forced a third overtime, and the Wildcats got the first possession. The offense was stuffed, gaining only one yard, and Kentucky again lined up for a 41-yard field goal. However this time the kick went wide right, and the Gators had a chance to put the game away for good. 
Instead of turning to Robinson, 
Florida called No. 24’s number. Jones answered that call and deliv-ered.
The Florida offense lined up with 
the ball game on the line. First and ten from the Kentucky 25, Jones ran up the middle for three yards. On the very next down it was Jones 
again, this time trucking between 
the tackles for a 16-yard gain and a first down inside the Wildcats’ 6 yard line.
And he didn’t stop there. He 
ran for five yards on the very next play, and was downed inside the one-yard line. Driskel gave it to him again on the next play, resulting in a 
one-yard touchdown. 
“I told him, ‘you’re carrying us. 
We’re going to keep riding on your 
back. We’re going to keep block-ing for you,’” redshirt senior tackle Chaz Green said. “And then we put it in his hands and he made some great things happen.”Junior running back carries Florida in second half against Kentucky

UF running back Matt Jones carries the ball during Florida’s 36-30 triple-overtime win against Kentucky on Saturday at Ben Hill Griffin 
Stadium. Jones ran for 156 yards on a career-high 29 carries against the Wildcats.

gonna be willing to throw the ball 
vertically that much, there’s going to be some 50-50 balls. We need to 
play the ball better, which we didn’t 
and that was very frustrating.”
In the second half altogether, 
Florida allowed Kentucky to go 5 
for 7 on third down and average 9.7 
yards on that down in the process. 
Towles ﬁ  nished with 369 pass-
ing yards, three touchdowns and three interceptions — a number 
that could have been higher if any 
of Florida’s 14 pass breakups didn’t hit the ground.
But the Gators took positives away from the game as well.The offense rallied in the second half, scoring on three straight drives 
to start the third quarter.
Robinson showed that he’s a 
playmaker on offense, catching a 
school-record-tying 15 catches for 216 yards, a number that ranks 
fourth in program history. 
No other Florida receiver had 
more than two catches against Ken-
tucky on Saturday.
Matt Jones separated himself 
from Florida’s deep pack of run-ning backs, tallying 156 yards on a career-high 29 carries and punching in the game-winning touchdown in 
the third overtime period four hours 
and eight minutes after play began.On Florida’s three overtime 
drives, Jones carried the ball eight times for 45 yards, including the 
one-yard scamper up the middle to 
seal the game.
“We’re explosive enough of-
fensively to go make some plays,” Muschamp said. “And quite frankly 
as we moved forward in the season 
last year, we weren’t. As a competi-tor, you don’t ever want to admit something like that, but it’s hard 
not to at times when you struggle to 
make 10 points.”
Safety Keanu Neal forced two 
interceptions — the ﬁ  rst coming off a tipped pass by fellow safety Jabari 
Gorman, the second giving the 
Gators the ball back with 22 seconds left in regulation in a tie game.
The interceptions were the ﬁ  rst of 
Neal’s career and helped the Gators 
bring their season turnover margin 
to +7 — second in the country only to Notre Dame (+8).
“There were a lot of things that 
I messed up on,” Neal said, “but 
those interceptions just show what 
putting your mind back into things will do.” 
Florida now shifts its attention 
to its ﬁ  rst road test of the season, a trip to Tuscaloosa, Ala., to face No. 3 Alabama (3-0).
UF knows the mistakes it needs 
to correct. Now it needs to correct 
them.
“I think we’ve got a mentally strong team,” Driskel said. “You 
didn’t see guys hanging their heads on the sidelines. You saw guys that 
were competing and knowing that 
at the end of the game, we’ve got the players to make the plays and the coaches that were going to get us in the right situation. That was 
good experience for us. We know 
kind of how overtime works now.”
Not every win will be easy.The Gators learned that on Sat-
urday.
“It’s a very adverse game,” Mus-
champ said. “There’s going to be games like that when you play in our conference, and you’ve got to 
ﬁ  nd ways to win those games and 
our guys found a way to win.”

Three Key Plays
After Florida’s ﬁ  rst ﬁ  ve drives ended in four punts and an interception, kicker Frankie Velez kicked a 35-yard ﬁ  eld goal in the second quarter to give the Gators the ﬁ  rst points on the score-board. Velez’s ﬁ  eld goal capped off an 11-play, 68-yard drive
With the game tied and 1:47 left in regulation, Kentucky tried to drive down the ﬁ  eld to win the 
game. After Kentucky made it to its 30-yard line, UF safety Keanu Neal intercepted a Patrick Towles pass to give Florida the ball back with 28 seconds left to force overtime.
After Kentucky failed to put points on the board in the third overtime, Florida just needed to score 
in order to end the game. The Gators rode Matt Jones for the entire possession, having the junior go the 25-yard distance on four carries.
Swamp Studs
Demarcus Robinson WR (3 points) - Robinson did not slow down from his breakout performance against Eastern Michigan. The sophomore wideout hauled in 15 catches to tie the single-game school record set in 1969. His 216 yards through the air were the fourth most in school history and the most since Taylor Jacobs had 246 in 2002.Matt Jones RB (2 points) - While Robinson was the standout performance of Florida’s offense on Saturday, Matt Jones had a great night in his own respect. The junior tailback tallied 156 yards on 29 carries and scored the game-sealing touchdown in the third overtime period. Jones totaled 45 yards on eight carries in overtime along.Kyle Christy P (1 point) - After a subpar 2013 season, Kyle Christy returned to his 2012 form on Saturday. The senior averaged 48.7 yards per punt on six attempts against the Wildcats, nailing four inside the 20-yard line and kicking one 61 yards.

Turning Point
After the Wildcats scored a touchdown on its ﬁ  rst overtime possession, the Gators were in a do-or-die situation. On fourth and 7 from the UK 9-yard line, Jeff Driskel snapped the ball as the play clock expired and ﬁ  red a pass to Demarcus Robinson in the corner of the endzone to keep Florida’s chance of a victory alive.
