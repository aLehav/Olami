Students rally
for DREAM Act
0 MACHEN SIGNED THEIR
PETITION AT TIGERT HALL.
By ALISON SCHWARTZ
Alligator Writer
They stood in the center of Tur-
lington Plaza Wednesday after-
noon, donning caps, gowns and
the gleaming faces of soon-to-be
graduates.
The mock graduation ceremo-
ny began, and just as the valedic-
torian reached for her diploma,
the shouting began.
"Immigration enforcement.
You are under arrest," said Lance
Griffin, a theater senior. "You have
no rights as a noncitizen except to
be detained and deported."
Although Griffin, who directed
the skit portion of the demonstra-
tion, was acting, the message was
real.
This demonstration was one of
about 128 events held across thecountry in support of the National
Back to School DREAM Act Day
of Action.
Coordinated by the Coalition
of Hispanics Integrating Spanish
Speakers through Advocacy and
Service, the event encouraged
the passing of the DREAM Act, a
piece of legislation that supports
undocumented immigrant youth
who seek higher education in the
U.S.
"Let's educate our youth of
tomorrow," said Victoria Mena, a
campus organizer at the demon-
stration. "Tell Bernie Machen we
want him to support education."
And that's just what they did.
The demonstration broke out
into a march to Tigert Hall, the
administration building. Machen
came outside onto the steps of the
building, voicing his support for
the cause.
"I support the DREAM Act,
and I'm proud to be with you all

Wednesday afternoon.
E-mails to track HINI
UF announced Wednesday it will track
the spread of HINI swine flu by sending
out 1,500 e-mails to students every week
for the next 40 weeks.
The e-mails will be sent to a random
list of students and will ask if they've ex-
perienced flu-like symptoms in the past
week, said Phillip Barkley, director of
UF's Student Health Care Center.
Currently, about 99 percent of all cam-
pus flu cases are HINI swine flu, he said.
UF's infirmary has seen about 450
people with the flu or flu-like illnesses
since the beginning of the fall semester. At
Florida State University, there have been
595 cases of flu, and University of Central
Florida has seen 72 cases of Type A flu,
which includes swine flu.
UF officials have braced themselves for
an infection rate of up to 25 to 40 percent of
students, Barkley said, though they hope
the vaccine -which should be available

measures can slow the flu's spread.
He said UF requested 45,000 doses
of the vaccine, though it's not clear how
many the university will receive.
"We're preparing for the fact that we
may be doing a lot of vaccinating on our
campus," he
UF said.
Administration UF encourag-
es students with
flu-like symptoms to stay home. Some
auditoriums are being equipped with a
system that allows students to record lec-
tures.
Hand-sanitizer dispensers have been
installed around campus, as well, and UF
has set aside dorm rooms for healthy stu-
dents to get away from sick roommates.
"What were hoping is that we can
modify this disease," Barkley said.

University Press to offer
free online textbooks
Free textbooks could be a few clicks
away next semester.
The University Press of Florida -locat-
ed behind Chipotle on West University Av-
enue -has teamed up with a digital book
provider to offer free online textbooks and
reduced price print copies.
The plan is to eventually provide free
online textbooks for every general educa-
tion class taught at any of Florida's 11 state
universities, said Meredith Babb, director of
the press.
All they can do is offer the free books,
Babb said. Professors can decide to adopt
them or not.
"Eight hundred dollars a semester [for
textbooks] is stupid," she said. "Maybe the
students will force the professors into some
of these options. That would be nice."
The press now offers 89 textbooks for
free online, and it plans to continue expand-
ing its selection, she said. A good chunk ofthe books are math-related, she said, so the
press will be targeting its advertising to-
ward math professors this spring.
"Eight hundred dollars a semes-
ter [for textbooks] is stupid."
Meredith Babb
director of University Press
Most of the textbooks, which will be
available at theorangegrove.org, will be of-
fered in print as well. The prices should be
40 to 50 percent less than the prices of simi-
lar textbooks at other stores, Babb said.
And the plan is to make the books avail-
able in as many formats as possible, provid-
ing students with choices between paper,
online and e-book varieties.
"Knowledge is becoming much more
portable," Babb said.-THOMAS STEWART

A Gainesville man was arrested Wednes-
day morning following an investigation
into several gang recruitment videos post-
ed on YouTube.
A joint force of Alachua County Sheriff's
officers and city police carried out a search
warrant at 4401 NW 21st St. at 9 a.m., ac-
cording to Gainesville Police spokesman Lt.
Keith Kameg.
Naymontie Enoch, 18, was charged with
four counts of soliciting or recruiting gangBoth are third degree felonies.
Enoch's bail was set at $200,000.
A recent Florida law raised gang recruit-
ment to a felony offense. This arrest is one
of the first under the new law.
On Aug. 25, authorities learned of online
videos showing Enoch with bags of mari-
juana and threatening others not to mess
with his gang, the East Coast 725 Out West

Enoch was sleeping at the time of the
search and did not resist arrest.
Police did not find guns or drugs but
found evidence of gang recruitment, he
said.
Enoch's previous record includes 23 fel-ide of the
city since he was a child," Kameg said. "He
had been skating by as a juvenile, but now
as an adult it will be different."
The house sits a few blocks away from
C.W. Norton Elementary School.
Kameg said boys between 12 and 14
years old frequently hung out at the house,
and the neighbors thanked police for taking
action.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
Student vote to determine future of 'I Voted' stickers
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Writer
Student Government "I Voted" stickers
may not stick around after next week's elec-
tions.
Voters in the fall SG elections will choose
whether poll workers should continue to pass
out the stickers.
Orange and Blue Party members collected
signatures from 2 percent of the Student Body
to put the initiative on the ballot, which would
end sticker distribution. If passed, the legisla-
tion will go into effect immediately but will re-
quire support from a majority of the voters.
Orange and Blue Party Sen. Jon Ossip, whohelped get the initiative on the ballot, said it
seeks to save money spent on the custom SG
stickers and end the voter coercion.
Ossip said some Greek organizations re-
quire members to present stickers to prove
they voted. He said the Unite Party has house
representatives who oversee the sticker collec-
tion and encourage voters to support Unite.
"That's not democracy anymore," Ossip
said. "People should vote to do the right thing,
not because they have to and not because
they're getting some kind of fine or reward."
Unite Party spokesman Jason Yoepp saidthe stickers don't say who people voted for.
"I don't see them as a tool used by Greek
houses, or by anyone else for that matter, for
,, Isome improper purpose,"
he said. "I see them as
people in our campus tak-
ing pride in our American
democratic system."
Orange and Blue sena-
tors also criticized the cus-
tom stickers' cost.
Orange and Blue Party
Sen. Gary Benedix said SGstickers were ordered for about $1,900 for the
spring 2009 election, and about 10,000 stu-
dents voted.
Progress Party President Dave Schneider
said while his party opposes buying more
stickers, the issue is not important.
"When eight out of 10 people aren't voting,
I think there's a bigger problem than voting
stickers," Schneider said.
SG Supervisor of Elections Ariana Alfonso
said she doesn't know how many stickers
were ordered for this election, and she has not
decided if stickers from previous elections will
they don't force students to vote for them. bought stickers even when it had leftovers be reused this election season.
Yoepp said using the stickers to measure from previous elections. SG elections will take place Tuesday and
voter participation is a losing strategy because According to public SG records, 65,000 Wednesday.

DREAM, from page 1
on this," Machen said to the crowd
Machen, who left a room full of
people to speak to the demonstra-
tors, said he has been involved with
the issue for about eight to 10 years.
"It's a great cause, and it's a greatproposal," Machen said. "It's time
for action."
More than 300 people signed the
petition passed around in support of
the legislation, including Machen.
CHISPAS will send the petition
to the Florida Immigration Coalition
and Students Working for Equal
Rights."The DREAM Act touches us all,
whether through friends, relatives,
friends of relatives,"
On Griffin said. "We haveCampus to build a community
that celebrates talent."
Mario Del Rio, an international
business senior, was one of those
who marched to Machen's officechanting, "Dreams are free, equal-
ity."
Del Riohadn'tplanned on march-
ing, but he saw the demonstration
forming when he got out of class.
"I think it's a great idea," Del
Rio said. "Everybody deserves the
chance to go to college."
Eliana Torres, president of CIS-PAS, said the organization has been
working toward the passing of the
DREAM Act since last semester.
The event was a sequel to a dem-
onstration they held last year in sup-
port of the legislation.
"It's equality. It's social justice,"
Torres said. "They're students just
like us."

Fox News analyst dispels stereotypes about Hispanics
0 ABOUT 80 ATTENDED.
By LIZ BEHRMAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Hispanic stereotypes were
unraveled in Wednesday night's
Accent and Hispanic Heritage
Month presentation.
About 80 students gathered in
the Reitz Union Grand Ballroom
as Linda Chavez, chairwoman of
the Center for Equal Opportuni-
ties, spoke.
Chavez informed students
about the myths and stereotypes
surrounding Hispanics.
"They're not only the largest
minority in the U.S.; they're also
the most misunderstood," she
said.
Chavez, a Mexican-American
born in Albuquerque, N.M., said
that one of the main stereotypes
surrounding Hispanics is that
they are all lumped into one big
group.
The thing to remember, she
said, is that Hispanics have ori-
gins in more than two dozen oth-
er countries.
"We are a melting pot in this
country," Chavez said. "We have
done a very good job of that."Chavez provided listeners
with recent statistics about His-
panic employment, poverty,
homeownership, linguistic and
graduation rates in the U.S.
"She is really just a great wom-
an who has first-hand experience
with Hispanic students and the
Hispanic movement," said Justin
Simmons, vice chair of promo-
tions for Accent.
Political science junior Bianca
Campbell said it was refreshing
to hear Chavez' conservative take
on immigration, border patrol
and affirmative action.
"As a political scientist, I think
that she's very analytical," Camp-
bell said. "She's taking something
from the left and not shunning it
because it's a leftist idea."
Hispanics, particularly those
from second and third genera-
tions, have integrated quite well
into American society and will
continue to do so, Chavez said.
She said their situation is simi-
lar to that of the Jews and the Ital-
ians who immigrated to the U.S.
in the early 20th century.
"At a certain point all of us
joined together to be one people,"
she said. "It is an ideal that has
not always been lived up to, but it
is our motto as a country."Fox News analyst Linda Chavez speaks at an Accent-sponsored event in the Reitz Union Grand Ballroom
Wednesday night.
ON CAMPUS
Party gathers at Turlington to sign transparency waiver
Progress Party President Dave Sch-
neider has nothing to hide.
He spoke on Turlington Plaza Wednes-
day afternoon about the Progress Party's
latest initiative, which will release voting
records as public information.
"Right now there's a big push for trans-
parency," Schneider said. "But you can
only have real transparency when every-
one decides to do it."Progress Party candidates running for
Senate seats signed a waiver, which yield-
ed their rights under the Family Educa-
tional Rights and Privacy Act, complying
with the initiative.
Schneider said, on average, only two
out of 10 students vote in campus elec-
tions. He hopes this action of the Progress
Party will encourage students to vote.
"I don't blame people for not vot-"The best way to do things is
leading by example."

ing," Schneider said.
The Progress Party will also make vid-
eos of meetings, attendance records ande-mails pertaining to SG available to the
public.
Schneider is challenging the other par-
ties to follow suit.
"The best way to do things is leading by
example," Schneider said.
Student Body President Jordan Johnson
has already signed the waiver and encour-
aged other SG officials to do so.

Bust-ed
PSA no more risqu6 than
video game, beer adsR think Breast Cancer is rethinking its newest advertising
campaign after critics say it focuses too much on sex and
too little on the dangers of the disease.
The ad, which features slow-motion footage of a woman
wearing a bikini at a pool party, delivers the message, "You
know you like them. Now it's time to save the boobs. Breast
cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women ages 20
to 49."
Breast cancer survivor Robin Roberts described the ad as
a "less is more" approach in a "Good Morning America" seg-
ment Wednesday. One woman interviewed on the show said it
looked more like a Victoria's Secret ad than an ad about wom-
en's health.
It's true that the ad does bare some skin, but it reveals no
more than Heidi Klum did for the "stripped" version of her
Guitar Hero advertisement. And that was an ad for a video
game, not a public service announcement about breast cancer.
Had the advertisement been for a new brand of beer, would
it have sparked as much debate?
Let's face it. People respond to sex. Criticizing a public ser-
vice announcement for showing too much skin will not change
the fact that men (and women) like them.
Rethink Breast Cancer could have done without the zoomed

Let's just hope Rethink Breast Cancer remembers that the
campaign should not be about saving breasts, but about saving
lives.
Dream On
though PresidentBernie Machen said it
was "time for action,"
outside of Tigert Hall on
Wednesday, his decision not
to give UF's official support
for the DREAM Act -The
Development, Relief and Ed-
ucation for Alien Minors Act
-is slightly contradictory.
The DREAM Act's mis-
sion is to give undocumented
high school graduates access
to higher education by al-
lowing people without social
security numbers to apply to
college.
According to the National
Immigration Law Center,
65,000 undocumented stu-
dents graduate from high
school in the United States
each year.
By not giving these kids a
chance to attend college, we
contradict our nation's goal
of providing higher educa-
tion to all.
Children who have grown
up in America, stayed out of
trouble and graduated high
school shouldn't slip through
the cracks because of a deci-
sion their parents made whenthey were fetuses or giggling
at the Grouch on "Plaza Ses-
amo.1
UF should support this act
because it is an institution of
higher learning that doesn't
want to miss out on the bright
young Floridians who would
qualify for the program. They
have the same right to be here
as any of us if they can get
past UF's admissions board.
We understand the reser-
vations to the DREAM Act,
considering every spot given
to an undocumented alien in
a university is one spot taken
away from a natural born citi-
zen. However, we believe it's
in the best interest of a uni-
versity to accept the best and
brightest students, regardless
of their citizenship status.
While we commend Ma-
chen for signing the petition
to support the DREAM Act,
he's only gone halfway in
showing his commitment to
Florida's students. By not al-
lowing the university to take a
public stance on the DREAM
Act, Machen fails to fully sup-
port education and listen to
his own call for action.

Video disses pimps, proves gullibility
have enjoyed the hectic media buzz surrounding the
widespread condemnation of ACORN -the Asso-
ciation of Community Organizations for Reform Now
-workers over the last few weeks. The travesty against
pimping that transpired in these videos should forever
place shame on the houses of every pimp in the country,
if not the world.
It is absolutely stunning that James E. O'Keefe III
should ever be considered a pimp in America. Gangly
and reeking of privilege, O'Keefe looks like he was made
in the dork factory to be sold for full retail price in the jerk
store. The fact that this shmendrik successfully masquer-
aded as a pimp in so many of America's great cities speaks
very poorly to our nationwide ability to spot fakeness.
All O'Keefe had to do in order to convince a few dozen
middle-aged women across the country that he was a real
pimp was to dress up as if he were going to a Pimps and
Hoes frat party.
The long fur coat and cane are extravagant but essen-
tial to being a cliched fake pimp, but O'Keefe went the
extra mile with the black suit and pimp hat.
Hannah Giles accompanied O'Keefe on these videos,
a healthy girl with brawny shoulders who was clearly
dressed much more like a random bar slut than a full-
blown professional whore. That numerous ACORN
workers would tell Giles to start a small business roughly
called Lady of the Night, LLC speaks to a promising fu-
ture of budding young entrepreneurs with a zeal for old-
fashioned capitalism.
However, these women should have employed other
pimp stereotypes to sniff out the hidden camera opera-
tion. For instance, O'Keefe had no neck tattoo and lacked
a pimp cup or goblet of any kind. Bishop Don Magic JuanH
Tommy Maple
letters@alligator orghas not issued a public statement
yet, but he is rumored to be ponder-
ing a class-action lawsuit against
O'Keefe for falsely impersonating
pimposity.
Could we be losing our edge as
a society, or has this been the final
confirmation that profiling of any
kind has been successfully rooted
out of our bureaucratic government training? Tanned and
toned white sex workers with impeccable posture do not
enter many government offices seeking tax advice.
Stereotypes are our Indian knowledge, passed down
on Facebook -where Giles and O'Keefe planned their
video expose through e-mails beginning in May. The in-
surgency journalism practiced here in a symbiotic and
profitable system with talk radio and Internet purveyors
is an excellent blueprint for any media hopefuls in our
digital age.
Clandestine video recordings of pretty much any-
thing always pique some natural human curiosity, but
the sublimely campy performances turned in by a pair
of young conservative firebrands on the ACORN video
are ultimately troubling. Our own perceptions about this
"unique line of business," dulled by a glorification of
pimp stereotypes in popular culture, are so tarnished that
literally anyone can claim to be a pimp these days.
Pimps are a victim of their own media success, but
now they must chart a new course in fashion and style.
Somewhere in America, a once-proud pimp doffs his
chinchilla-face hat and hangs his head in shame.

munications. His column appears on Thursdays.

Senators failed to support human rights
As a Hispanic student, I am very disappointed
that Student Government senators couldn't find
it in them to pass a simple resolution supporting
human rights and dignity for farm workers in
Immokalee, Fla., especially since most of the work-
ers affected are also minorities.
Although all of the Progress senators voted in
favor of helping some of the most oppressed work-
ers in the country, I'm appalled that some Unite
and some Orange and Blue senators voted no on
the resolution enough for it to fail.
Opponents of the resolution used straw-man
arguments to excuse not taking a stand against
exploitation and slavery in Immokalee. This is a
setback for civil rights in Florida.

SG turned a blind eye to workers' rights
When the UF administration signed a no-bid
contract with Aramark last year, many students at
UF were disconcerted with the lack of research into
the options available for food services on campus.
After the Student Senate meeting last night,
many again should be asking why more research
wasn't done ahead of time before signing a con-
tract with a company with a reputation like Ara-
mark's.
A multi-arty coalition of senators led by the
Progress Party brought forward a resolution to
encourage Aramark to sit down with Immokalee
farm workers to discuss ways of alleviating the ter-
rible conditions faced by workers there, including
seven convicted cases of human slavery involving
more than 1,000 workers. These cases detailed con-
ditions including beatings, pistol whippings and
executions of migrant workers.
I'm proud that a majority voted in favor of the
resolution, including all the Progress Party sena-
__tors and half of the Unite party. But I'm also dis-
couraged that the resolution didn't pass, and some
senators refused to speak up on behalf of those
Smile.without voices who are subject to the most rep-
rehensible conditions imaginable, and refused to
represent this Student Body.
I hope moving forward that those senators who
voted no will do their due diligence this year and
not make the same mistake of ignoring the prac-
tices that Aramark turns a blind eye to.
I hope soon the Student Government will join
the Student Body and demand that Aramark open
a dialogue with the farm workers of Florida to
end exploitation, slavery and horrendous working
conditions.

Students do care about The New York Times
Fransisco Sotomayor: Students like me care
about The New York Times.
I, like many, joined the Facebook group and fol-
lowed the story in the Alligator. Now in my fourth
year on campus, not only am I always on the look-
out for the paper, I also know a secret location
where I can pick one up after 3 p.m.
Yes, I can read nearly any newspaper online,
but I prefer not to.
I can't speak for engineers, but business stu-
dents love the Times.
I've sat next to several people in the Warrington
College of Business Administraton who read the
Times, The USA Today, the Campus Sun and the
Alligator before and after class. Your engineering
classes are apparently not a representative sample
of students.
Yes, I do realize how much $60,000 is and how
it compares to funding for many student clubs, in-
cluding engineering-related organizations.
If the engineering clubs had a way to reach 300
people every weekday for an entire academic year,
Student Government would probably be happy to
give you $60,000.

This Providence serenades listeners with catchy beats
By MAE BASIRATMAND
avenue writer
WHEN: Friday 7 p.m.
WHERE: The Venue
In the era of synthesized pop
beats and barely legal song lyrics,
This Providence keeps it real. The
soothsaying love ballads and grief-
stricken rock tunes about relation-
ships complement the idealistic
nature of the rock enthusiast. With
three albums under its belt and
a strong fan base, the band em-
barked on its fall tour with full force
and high spirits.
Seattle's indie/pop/rock band
has already gained MTV airtime
and exposure through the label
Fueled by Ramen. This Providence
creates catchy beats while simul-
taneously serenading the audi-
ence with deep lyrics, giving themthe "wow" factor that most bands
crave. The band has toured with
Cartel, Paramore, Relient K and All
Time Low. They are not stopping
short of any success. The Avenue
caught up with Aussie lead singer,
Daniel Young, while the band tours
across America.
+ I noticed it said you guys
are from Seattle. Where are you
from?
I'm from Australia, and our bass
player is from Phoenix. But we're
all stationed in Seattle now. That's
where the rest are from.
+ What's your story? How did
This Providence come to be?
From high school we played lo-
cal shows on the weekends. We
loaded our parent's minivan and
eventually got signed on a local la-bel. We started in 2006. Two years
before we were a band, we sent in
lots of demos. It's all about who
you know.
+ Where do the ideas come
from for the content of your
songs? What kinds of songs
should fans expect at your shows
and on the album?
A lot of the musical inspiration is
from music we like and listen to -
Jimmy Eat World, for example. We
want to be a respectable pop/rock
band. Our music tastes change,
just like everyone else's does. On
the recent album we were inspired
by Oasis, The Cure and The Kill-
ers. Songs on the recent album are
mostly about relationship stuff -
love songs, breakup songs. Simple
songs are ones that are deepest to
people. Almost the essence of be-ing human is falling in love.
+ Musically, what is your ulti-
mate goal? What are you looking
for in the long run?
We just want to write really good
songs, great songs. We try to make
music that's not a fad. We try to
write solid rock songs. My dream is
to write a song that really connects
with people. The Beatles did a re-
ally great job of writing songs. Basi-
cally we're just trying to write really
good pop/rock songs.
+ What kind of fan following
do you guys have?
High school, college-aged, just
general. The same as other Fueled
by Ramen bands.
+ So, do you have any crazyfan stories?
There are some clingy, crazy
people. Sometimes you get people
that are sending mean messages
on Twitter. The fans of the band say
stuff, use Photoshop and put lists of
things on my picture. They're inter-
ested in the band's personal lives.
It's an odd thing we deal with.
+ What should fans expect at
the show? Do you guys hold any
surprises or do crazy stuff for the
crowds?
They should expect a rock show.
We play our songs and have fun with
it. It's not anything out of this world
or different. It's just us playing our
songs. People come because they
like the songs. It's aboutthe music.
There are no gimmicks. We're just
a band that plays the songs really
well.

'September Issue' goes behind the scenes at Vogue
By ASHLEY ROSS
avenue writer
Vogue, Pronunciation: \Ev6g\
Function: noun, 1: the leading place in
popularity or acceptance 2: one that
is in fashion at a particular time. Syn-
onyms: see "fashion."
Forget January.
For fashion, September marks the
start of a new year. When the tem-
perature slowly drops, fashionistas
everywhere flip their calendars to this
critical month that initiates what's in
and what's out.
And who is the sovereign of all that
is chic, the driving force behind the
newest styles? Anna Wintour, Vogue's
editor-in-chief, of course.Wintour is unarguably the most
powerful person in the fashion in-
dustry. She demands perfection on
the pages of her magazine and won't
accept anything less. Her legendary
blonde bob and celebrated pout of
disapproval have crowned her the Ice
Queen of Fashion.
But nobody has ever gotten to
know the real Anna Wintour. Nobody
has ever seen what happens behind
the doors of the Vogue office. Nobody
knows how it's decided what's in and
what's out. That is, until now. Film-
maker R.J. Cutler introduces "The Sep-
tember Issue," an exclusive look at
Wintour's world that follows the Vogue
team as it puts together its 2007 Sep-
tember issue, which still reigns asthe largest magazine ever published,
reaching more than 13 million people,
weighing more than 4 pounds and to-
taling840 pages.
The documentary is a slice of heav-
en, bringing view-
ers back in time
to a pre-recession
fantasy world when
purchasing a Karl
Lagerfeld ensem-
ble didn't make you
cringe with guilt.
Every scene of the film shows a dif-
ferent side of the magazine from edi-
torial and fashion to advertising and
business.
There's Andre Leon Talley, Vogue
editor at large who carries himself withan exuberant air of style. His day at
the tennis court is spent with a Louis
Vuitton towel slung over his shoulder,
meanwhile, his racket sits in a match-
ing case.
Then there's Grace Coddington,
the hopeless-romantic creative direc-
tor and former model, whose delicate
British accent sharply differs from her
fiery red hair. Coddington is the only
one who can match Wintour in the of-
fice, battling the page cuts in hopes of
preserving her artsy, historic pages in-
stead of gettingwrapped up in the hur-
ricane of celebrities who have taken
over magazines.
And then, of course, there's Win-
tour. The camera shoots her from a
low angle in order to demonstrate theoffice hierarchy, and the film truly cap-
tures her in a mystifying way, revealing
her cut-throat decisions, her infatu-
ation with the industry, her shy smile
and even her family. And while the Ice
Queen has constantly been gossiped
to be the most polarizing figure in the
industry, she's not as icy as one might
think. She simply says what she thinks
and wants exactly what she's looking
for.
Wintour was the inspiration for
"The Devil Wears Prada." Meryl Streep
played the character in a merciless
manner. However, Streep's character
didn't carry herself with enough style
to live up to the true devil. And in real
life, the devil wears Chanel.

0\Changing norms in the workplace
By KELLY RICHARD
avenue contributing writer
As students permanently ink their
bodies, their method of self-expression
may affect their future careers -a fact
that some take into consideration. The
sleeve of tattoos that friends see will
also be visible to employers.
Bailey Parke, a public relations se-
nior, has six tattoos and plans to get
more, she said.
"I got my first tattoo a couple
months after I turned 18," Parke said.
"I feel weird, but I constantly come up
with ideas of tattoos I want."
The number of tattoos she has
comes down to money and knowing
her limit, she said.
"I've always been kind of the way I
am -very into music and surrounded
by people with tattoos," she said. "I'm
very lucky to have accepting parents."
Parke said that when she worked
for UF, her first job in college, no one
seemed to care about the piece on her
arm.
"Thatwas my first eye-opening expe-
rience with tattoos in the workplace,"
she said.
While working at a day care in a
Catholic school, Parke said it was the
Harrison Diamond/ Alligator Staff
Bailey Parke, a public relations senior at UF, works at a school even though she has
visible tattoosfirst time she felt conscious of her
tattoos. She covered them up as well
as she could and did not mind hiding
them.
At her new child care job, the school
has no problem with tattoos or clothing
she wears, she said.
She said she wants to work in the
music industry, a field in which she
feels tattoos are acceptable.
While interning for Superfly Produc-
tions in New York City this past sum-
mer, one of Parke's coworkers called
her "tattoo girl," but it was a very casual
and accepting work environment. She
never got any negative feedback.
"It has been on my mind that I will
be judged," Parke said. "I feel that if
someone doesn't want to hire me be-
cause of my tattoos, I don't want to
work for them."
She has worked very hard in col-
lege, so she can be picky about the job
she wants, Parke said.
"It's just the way I express myself,
and I hope that people can appreciate
that," Parke said. "All of my tattoos are
meaningful to me."
Nadene Francis, assistant director
of public relations for UF's Career Re-
source Center, said some students with
tattoos come in with concerns aboutTHURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 2A, 2009 + ALLIGATOR, 11
finding a job or interviews.
"Candidates should be judged on
their ability to do the work," Francis
said.
Employers should be more con-
cerned with a person's skill set, but
people are visual too, she said. For
example, she doesn't think she's ever
seen an anchorman with a tattoo that
is visible from the neck up.
bThere are just a few standards
where they're not acceptable," Francis
said. "Itjust depends on the field."
Francis said she asks the students
about their level of comfort interview-
ing with their tattoos. She advises stu-
dents to think of company expectations
ahead of time.
Several companies still don't allow
a 5 o'clock shadow and require closed-
toe shoes for women, Francis said.
"There may be some adjustments
to come for job seekers," Francis said.
Francis said she recently had a
conversation with an employer who re-
cruits at UF. The employer had a lunch
engagement with a person who had
visible tattoos.
The employer was surprised that
the person would have such noticeable
body art, and this framed their decision
of the person. Francis said this might
have been a generational issue.
Tracey Landgraf, an UF sophomore,
has four tattoos on her body. She
started to get tattoos after her dad and
sister got them.
"I like to draw things, so the idea of
having one of my own creations as a
tattoo was appealing," Landgraf said.
She is open to the idea of getting
more tattoos, but she is not committed
to a new one just yet, she said. After
getting her first tattoo on her back, her
other tattoos are in more visible spots.
"I liked the idea of having tattoos
that I could see," Landgraf said. "Yet,
they're still all in places thatlI could hide
with either an accessory or a shoe."
She said she did take her future ca-
reer into consideration, but she doesn't
think her tattoos will be a problem be-
cause of theirplacement.
"Even if it's an unfair reaction, I feel
I would be judged on having large and
visible tattoos," Landgraf said. "How-
ever, thanks to our generation, tattoos
are becoming more acceptable."
Robert Barnes, co-owner of An-
them Tattoo Parlor, said you can see a
change in the acceptability of tattoos
in the workplace. They are losing their
stigma.
"I know doctors that have sleeves,"
Barnes said.
Barnes said about30 percent of his
clientele will come in with issues about
placement.
"People are still apprehensive get-
ting them where they're going to be
seen a lot," Barnes said.
It goes back to when there were
two types of people who had tattoos:
sailors and criminals, he said. Sailors
were associated with rowdiness, and
criminals' tattoos showed that they had
served time.
"As the baby boomers get older,
it's not looked upon as it once was,"
he said. "I don't think it's going to be
thought of as anything weird."
Barnes said tattoos no longer stand
out as much, whether they are on a me-
chanic or a waiter.
"It's like wearing a shirt with a pic-
ture on it," he said. "It just doesn't
come off."

Streetcar Q & A with set designer Kent Barrett
By KIRK WILLIAMS
avenue writer
Kent Barrett is the set designer for
UF's production of "A Streetcar Named
Desire." He is also a fourth-year gradu-
ate student seeking a Master of Fine
Arts degree in scenic design. He spoke
with the Avenue about his experiences
creatingthe set for the production,
which runs until Sunday at the Constans
Theatre.
+ AVE: How did you person-
ally become involved in theater
and set design?
KB: I grew up in a house of theater
people and grew up with lighting design.
And then, somewhere along the way,
I started doing more scenic design
because I felt lighting was more about
reaction, whereas design is more proac-
tive and creative.
+AVE: Tennessee Williams'
original 1947 play, "A Street-
car Named Desire," has been
adapted into movies, TV series
and even an opera. Did you
look to one of those in particu-
lar for inspiration?
KB: Yes and no. I did a lot of re-
search, but most of that research was
geared toward trying not to reproduce
what [past adaptations] had done.
There's elements in here that are sort
of stereotypical to the play, like the
spiral staircase. But we're tryingto do
something a little more unique and
have our own voice with it.KB: Well the process is really long.
We started talking about it back in
March or April. I met with the director
[Dr. Judith Williams], and she and I went
over different ideas we had until we had
agreed on something. What we really
agreed on was the idea of beauty and
decay -there are all kinds of refer-
ences in the text that things used to be
beautiful but had kind of deteriorated.
And Judith really wanted to push that
organic idea of going through these
things that are kind of run-down.
+ AVE: How long did it take
to conceptualize, design and
create the set?
KB: [The director and 1] started
meeting and my designs were due by
the end of April. The process was inter-
estingfor me because I went to [work
on] another play and when I came back,
a good chunk of the set had been built.
And then we spent the beginning of this
semester finishingthe build, painting,
and arrangingthe furniture. So a good
six months I'd say.
+ AVE: What was the approxi-
mate budget for the set and
how did you work off of that?
KB: Our budget was actually pretty
large. I think we ended up spending
approximately $12,000 for all of it.
Normally we would build something, but
for this play we were just able to buy it
instead.
+ AVE: "A Streetcar Named
Desire" takes place in late-
AVE: How did you try to 1940s New Orleans. What did
make your own voice with it? you take into considerationwhile designing the set to
achieve such an "old South"
atmosphere?
KB: It's a lot of research, especially
in terms of props and set dressing. At
one point, someone asked about the
technology for one of the doctor's props,
and we had to check if such technology
was even available in 1947. With the
set pieces, sometimes you get stuck in
the details of tryingto show the time
period. And it's really the individual little
set pieces that show that [time period],
rather than the overall broad design.
+ AVE: Do you feel any set
pieces are the most vital in tell-
ing the story, and how did you
choose those?
KB: The balcony, I love that piece,
because it creates sort of a higher play-
ingfield and has a more New Orleans
feel to it than the rest of the set. Even
the flowers [on the balcony], I wanted
to start the show in cool blue and green
tones with those, and then when [pro-
tagonist] Blanche showed up, we would
start to show more reds and bright
colors. But the director wanted more
color, so we compromised on that.
+ AVE: If you could do any-
thing over again, what would
you change?
KB: I would probably do the whole
thing differently if I could. The set serves
the function it does, but it doesn't do or
say anything that breaks boundaries. I
think it'd be really interesting to set the
play in a modern context and maybe
have the audience closer to the action
itself.

Kent Barrett stands on the set he designed for the run of Tennessee Williams' play "A Streetcar Named Desire " The play began Friday at
the Constans Theatre and runs through Sunday101 Cantina
adds modern
Mexican twist
By KARINA GALVEZ
avenue writer
Facing University Avenue, a trickling bunch of bar ta-
bles and stools in vibrant mosaic green, red and yellow
tiles invite the hungry for a modern Mexican experience.
Inside, a long range of tables creates the atmosphere of
a patio party, complete with a full bar. In the back, a tiki
bar sets the scene of a tropical escape complete with
custom-made margaritas.
101 Cantina opened Sept. 9 after construction delays
pushed the opening date back from July. The restaurant
offers a variety of traditional Mexican dishes -tacos,
chili, quesadillas and ceviche -with modern twists,
stuffing them with interesting ingredient combinations
of lobster, shrimp, blackened fish or mango.
Executive chef Corby Richardson has been working
with Mexican food for more than 10 years, and he offers
exciting twists on both Mexican and Tex-. Mex favorites.
"The menu is a mix between tropi-
cal and modern," said Erik Zika, 101
Cantina's general manager. "We bring
modern flare to the traditional Mexican
restaurant with items such as lobster
burritos and chili relleno."
Chili relleno is a chili pepper stuffed with cheeses
and spicy sauces.
The menu also features traditional items like burgers,
chips with salsa, and guacamole and southwest chicken
enchiladas, all for reasonable prices of about $12.
Taking influence from the 101 Downtown martini
menu, the cantina features a variety of 27 margaritas
and a selection of 27 tequilas, as well as island drinks
and beers. The tiki area of the cantina is decorated with
lattice fencing and wooden tequila barrels as tables.
"Gainesville loves being outside, and our drinks coin-
cide with our concept," Zika said.
101 Cantina expects to thrive in the Midtown area
and is not worried about the established names on
the block that attract customers with their party atmo-
sphere. Cantina will stay open until 2 a.m. and offer
food and drink specials throughout the week.
"We always love competition," Zika said. "We are re-
ally here to focus on our business, which is first and fore-
most a restaurant. The nightlife will always be there."

UK looks to break 22-game losing streak to UF
By MIKE DIFERDINANDO
Alligator Staff Writer
mdiferdinando@alligator org
Kentucky knows a lot about record
losing streaks to conference oppo-
nents.
UK has walked away with a loss in
each of its last 22 meetings with No.
1 Florida -the second-longest active
head-to-head domination in the na-
tion.
The only streak longer is the 24
straight times Kentucky (2-0, 0-0
Southeastern Conference) has lost to
Tennessee. And the Wildcats have
also lost 16 of the last 18 to Georgia.
"(This year's players) weren't on
those teams," UF quarterback Tim
Tebow said. "They are a new team, a
fresh team. They are going to put that
behind them and say, 'That's not us.
Those teams did that; that's not us.
This isn't the Gators team that beat
all those teams. We're going to go in
there and show we're a new team and
we have something to prove.'
UF's last loss to UK, a 10-3 defeat,
came back in 1986, and rarely have the
scores been close. The Gators have
won by an average of 28.8 points in
the last 15 games between the two
schools.
Since 1985, the Wildcats are 5-67against the three powers of the SEC
East.
"When we first got here, that first
year they were bad," UF coach Urban
Meyer said. "Rich (Brooks) is a good
friend of mine. What he's done up
there I think is one of the great coach-
ing jobs, a little bit like what coach
(Bill) Snyder did at Kansas State. .
Personnel level, right now I put them
in the upper third in the SEC as far as
talent."
aBrooks has led the
Wildcats to two Music
City Bowl wins and one
Liberty Bowl win in the
last three years.
Kentucky's second-
ary has held opposing passers to a
44.4 completion percentage and 185.5
yards per game this year, something
that could spell trouble for a UF pass-
ing attack that struggled last week
against Tennessee.
Tebow threw for just 115 yards, no
touchdowns and an interception, and
the Gators' receivers combined for
eight catches for 74 yards against the
Volunteers.

0 HE LED THE TEAM WITH 12 TACKLES
AGAINST TENNESSEE.
By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
rnm ccall@a Iligator org
Usually, when a player of Brandon Spikes'
caliber is in jeopardy of missing a game, it's cause
for concern.
Then again, there isn't usually a jack-of-all-
trades with the mind of a defensive coordinator
ready to step in.
If Spikes isn't able to play Saturday at Ken-
tucky because of Achilles tendinitis, senior Ryan
Stamper will take his place, and it's almost a giv-
en that Stamper will fill the All-American's shoes
well.
"You know if Stamp is there, the job is going
to get done," cornerback Joe Haden said. "That's
basically how we take it."Now in his fifth season, Stamper knows the
Gators' defense inside and out. He can play all
three linebacking positions and knows where the
safeties and defensive linemen should be on ev-
ery play.
He might as well be an on-field coach, and
UF coach Urban Meyer has already asked him to
become an assistant when his playing days are
over.
"I pretty much know what every guy has to
do," Stamper said. "When it comes to the run, I
kind of know what position everyone needs to be
in, so I try to help everyone out the best I can."
Considering the task before him last week
against Tennessee, it's astonishing Stamper didn't
need any help. When Spikes left the game in the
third quarter, Stamper had to fill in.
He had practiced all week at the weakside
spot, but he made a seamless transition to middle
linebacker.
Stamper finished with a game-high 12 tackles,

Nutt created Wildcat from single wing
EHE FIRST INTRODUCED IT
WH ILE AT ARKANSAS.
By BOBBY CALLOVII
Alligator Staff Writer
bcallovi@alligatororg
Ole Miss coach Houston Nutt
gets a lot of credit for introduc-
ing the Wildcat formation to the
college level when he was the
Arkansas coach, but he doesn't
feel as though he deserves all the
recognition.
"A lot of times we are given
way too much credit for that for-
mation," he said. "That formation
was way back in the single wing
days with Pop Warner and all
those guys."
That doesn't mean he thinkshe shouldn't get some acknowl-
edgment for the recent surge in
Wildcat-like formations through-
out the NCAA and now into the
pro game.
Nutt thinks a slight change
from the old style of the single
wing was the reason for his suc-
cess.
"The thing that we did do, and
my brother deserves the credit for
this when he was coaching the
running backs, is we had a meet-
ing and he said 'Hey, if you want
to make this thing go, let a quar-
terback have the direct snap,"'
Nutt said. "(Darren) McFadden
was a true triple threat, and what
I mean by that is he could run
it, he could throw and he could
hand it. That's where it took off."
Despite how well the forma-tion has worked for him in col-
lege, he didn't think it would
make it to the NFL.
But when his former quar-
terback coach at Arkansas took
the same position for the Miami
Dolphins, he brought the Wildcat
with him.
"(An NFL team using it) is sur-
prising though. David Lee, who
worked for me'
told me he was go-
ing to get Dan Hen
ning to run it, but I
didn't believe him though," Nutt
said. "Then, one day last year he
left a message telling me to watch
the NFL highlights versus the Pa-
triots -I think that was the first
time they broke it out -and sure
enough there it was."SEC WEST TOPPING THE POLLS:
The Southeastern Conference
West division has three teams
ranked in the top seven -No.
3 Alabama, No. 4 Ole Miss, and
No. 7 LSU.
With them ranked so highly,
the SEC West is making a case for
the best division in the nation.
"I think it certainly is argu-
able," LSU coach Les Miles said.
"With the improvement that was
made by Mississippi and certain-
ly Alabama's very strong team
and Arkansas can throw it. There
is some competition in this divi-
sion."
Florida is the only team in the
top 10 for the East division, and
only has to play LSU out of those
top teams on the other side of the
conference.
Tebow threw four touchdowns in last trip to Lexington
KENTUCKY, from page 18
out wide for UK and safeties Calvin Har-
rison and Winston Guy Jr. patrol the center
of the field with authority.
"(Quarterbacks coach) Scot Loeffler
made a comment to me that this is one of
the best secondaries he's seen," Meyer said.
"You really can't isolate people. They have
two great corners. They matched (Lindley)
up on Percy Harvin for a lot of the game(last season), I'm curious
where they put him this
year."
Tebow completed 11
of 15 passes for 180 yards
in last year's 63-5 win on
UF's homecoming week-
end.
The Gators have had
some close calls at Commonwealth Stadi-
um in recent years.
In 2007, the Wildcats were within atouchdown of the Gators in the fourth
quarter but came away with a 45-37 loss.
In his first career start, former UF quar-
terback Chris Leak barely escaped Lexing-
ton with a 24-21 win in 2003.
"It seems like we always get them when
they're mad," Brooks said. "They didn't
light up the scoreboard like they're accus-
tomed to lighting it up, so I'm sure they're
going to want to come in here and show
everybody their offense is still very explo-
sive."
Redshirt senior one of four remaining members of
FOOTBALL, from page 18
three tackles for loss, a forced fumble and a sack in the
23-13 win, making the big plays that Spikes, clearly
bothered by his injury, could not.
"I think that's a big reason why we won the game
Saturday," Meyer said. "We don't hold that team, and
those running backs, to what we did without a guy
like Stamper coming to play."
Stamper credits his knowledge of the defense to his
longevity, as he's one of just four signees left from the
2005 recruiting class (Jonathan Phillips, David Nelson
and Dorian Munroe are the others).
His long-standing place on the team has made
him a father figure, and teammates often look to him
for the final word in arguments. That's a source of
pride for the Jacksonville native -originally an Au-
burn commit -who is glad he stayed the course in
Gainesville.
"I don't know what we'd do without a
guy like him. He's the kind of guy who'd
be the face of the program."
Urban Meyer
UF football coach
"I think about that all the time," Stamper said. "A
lot of my guys got kicked off the team or transferred
or something. To know that I'm still here and I made
it through the tough times in this program, that means
a lot to me."
When Stamper takes the field in Lexington on
Saturday, he'll do so prepared to play just about any-
where on the defense.
And he'll be a calming presence for Meyer, even if
it means Spikes is on the sidelines.
"The respect people have for him, he was elected
captain before he was even a starter here at Florida,"
Meyer said. "I don't know what we'd do without a
guy like him. He's the kind of guy who'd be the face
of the program. He's tremendous, a really great player
who holds the whole deal together."'05 class

Hunter S. Thompson's
1970 article "The Kentucky
Derby Is Decadent and De-
praved" is regarded as one of
the most influential pieces of
modern journalism and one
that I have grown to love.
Thompson was sent to
cover the annual Kentucky
Derby for a short-lived
magazine called Scanlan's
Monthly.
After a few days of writ-
ers block, he hit deadline
without a coherent story for
his editor.
Thompson tore pages
from his notebook, num-
bered them, and sent them
to the magazine.
The first-person subjec-
tivity that characterized
these notes became the be-
ginnings of the Gonzo style
of journalism he was known
for.
Thompson's article was
described by one critic as
"falling down an elevator
shaft and landing in a pool
of mermaids."
He depicted the whis-
key gentry that he met that
weekend as "a pretentious
mix of booze, failed dreams
and a terminal identity cri-
sis."
In a naive attempt to
capture the inspiration of
a hero, I would also like to
rub elbows with the people
of Kentucky.
I want to sit trackside
while million-dollar horses
race by and sip cocktails
next to pearl-wearing south-
ern matriarchs.
I want to find myself
standing in line at the bet-
ting window with an exu-
berant business man light-
ing a cigar throwing down a
$100 bill on a race in front of
me and some poor soul with
$1 in his pocket still trying
to win his money back be-
hind me.
And perhaps amidst the
bustle of the track I might be
able to see a little bit of what
Thompson saw.
So somewhere between
an Atlanta layover for Glad-
ys Knight and Ron Winan's
Chicken & Waffles and an
overnight stop in Chatta-
nooga, I'll try one more time
to plead my case to visit one
of the horse tracks and get a
chance to experience the best
Kentucky has to offer.
If I'm lucky, the others
will cave. And who knows,
maybe I'll even pick a win-
ner.Meyer
