A Pittsburgh woman faces charges after 
she allegedly left her 6-year-old son with a 
stranger on board a bus while she was be-ing arrested on a shoplifting charge. 
Police said Portia Scoggins had two 
children with her Friday when she board-ed a bus after taking items from a pharma-cy, but just one when they pulled it over and arrested her.
Officers said Scoggins left the older 
child on board, giving a stranger the ad-dress for one of the boy’s friends and in-structions to drop him off there.
Police later learned the boy had been 
on the bus and found him at the address Scoggins supplied to the stranger.
Online court records don’t detail the 
charges against Scoggins. A phone listing for her could not be located Monday.
The children are in the custody of 
county social workers.

Students who have ever wanted to get a chance to ask Ur -
ban Meyer questions like, “When are we bringing back the 
triple-reverse pass?” or “How many fake punt plays do you 
have in the playbook?” or “How come you don’t wear a visor like Spurrier?” are now going to get that chance. 
Wednesday at 7 p.m., 500 students will be granted entrance 
through Gate 7 at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium into Holloway Touchdown Terrace to participate in a town-hall style meeting with the Gator football head coach. 
“What Coach Meyer wanted to do was set up something 
exclusively for the students,” said Steve McClain, associate ath-letic director for communications for the UF Athletic Associa-tion. “[Meyer wants] to give them an opportunity to be a little 
bit more familiar with the program, or see them in a different 
environment and a little bit more casual setting,” he said. 
This is the first time Meyer has held such an event at UF, McClain said. 
Though doors open at 7 p.m., students may want to arrive a 
bit earlier. Entry is first-come, first-served, and all that is  need-ed to get in is a valid Gator 1 Card.  
At the event, Meyer will be joined by other assistant coaches 
and a player, though it is yet to be determined who those peo-ple will be.
Students at the event will get free T-shirts commemorating 
the meeting and will also receive 2008 Gator Football National Championship DVDs.
Before the question and answer session begins, there will 
also be a showing of the 2009 Gator Football Highlight Video. 
After the meeting, there will be free pizza and drinks for 
everyone. 
“It’ll be unique,” McClain said. “People certainly have per -
ceptions of the football program being what they see on TV , read in the newspaper or read on the Internet. It’s a chance to gain a different perspective. It’s an environment we haven’t seen either coach or student athletes in. Meyer to host town hall forum with students� THE PROBATION PERIOD 
LASTS FOR 90 DAYS.

Repeated underage drinking 
violations and the resulting sanc-
tions have made some of mid-
town’s popular venues off limits for those under 21.
The Swamp Restaurant, 1642 W 
University Ave., and 101 Cantina, 
1632 W University Ave., have been 
ordered by the City of Gainesville to turn away underage customers from 9 p.m. until closing time. The 
probation began July 1 and lasts 90 
days, running until Sept. 28. 
Under a city ordinance that took 
effect April 2009, bars and restau-rants are subject to penalty if they 
incur repeated infractions during a 
business quarter.
Bars with an occupancy of 201 
or less can have up to five infrac-
tions before getting the prohibi-
tion, which is 90 days for first-time offenders. Higher-occupancy bars can get 10 infractions before they get penalized.Rum Runners, 116 SE First St., 
faced the 90-day penalty before ap-
pealing and bringing it down to 45 
days. The bar’s ban ends at 2 a.m. Friday morning.
In July, seven UF Student Gov-
ernment Senators met to discuss the ordinance. The bipartisan group agreed to try to repeal the ordinance through a ballot petition in one of Gainesville’s upcoming 
city elections.
Senate Minority Leader Jon Os-
sip said the main focus is to gauge 
student support for a ballot peti-
tion and try to get it on the bal-
lot in the city’s spring election.
Ossip said the group hopes to 
organize all concerned students at a future meeting to discuss the opposition of the ordinance, which he said is unfair to all parties in-
volved.
“You’re punishing both the 
business owner and the student 
that didn’t commit any offense,” he said. “We view that as a miscar -
riage of justice.”Bars forced to

SPOTLIGHT ON THE SWAMP
By ALEXANDER KLAUSNER
Alligator Writer
One day in April, Matt Walsh was 
poised on a condo balcony on New 
Smyrna Beach preparing to take photos of the last shuttle launch ever. The light-ing was dark. He didn’t have his tripod.
Walsh, a 23-year-old photojournalism 
student at UF, fashioned a tripod out of a light stand and a chair and carefully snapped photos at 30-second intervals as the shuttle streaked through the sky. 
One of those photos appeared in The 
New York Times, hangs in Florida’s capi-tol building and is now one of 12 finalists out of thousands of entries in  the Nation-
al Geographic Energizer 2010 Ultimate 
Photo Competition.
There are six categories in the con-
test, each with two photos going head to head: Animals/Wildlife, Nature, People/Cultures, Weather, Travel and Action/Energy . Walsh’s photo is in the Action/Energy category . 
The winners are determined by fan 
voting, which can be done at www.na-tionalgeographic.com/energizer/vote. V oting ends Sept. 15. The six winners get publication in the 
magazine and a trip to Greece. 
It’s the publication that Walsh really 
cares about most.
“It’s a dream come true to be pub-
lished in National Geographic,” he said. 
It’s a dream Walsh almost didn’t 
chase. 
He first heard about the contest from 
his girlfriend’s grandmother, Lorraine 
Russo. He gave Russo the photo follow-
ing her son’s death in an April car acci-dent on I-75. Before his death, she used to attend shuttle launches with him.
“This photo means way more to her 
than it will ever in my entire life mean to me in anything, even if this photo wins me a million dollars in some competi-tion.,” he said. “But it means way more 
to [Russo] because of the memories that 
she shared with her son, and those were memories that I was able to give back.”
Walsh said he reluctantly entered at 
the suggestion of Russo but forgot about it for a few months until he found out he was a finalist.
“This is bigger than I ever thought it 
was,” he said. “And it was just a photo. 
Just a quick snap of a button. ”Student competes in Nat’l Geographic photo contest4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, AUGUST 24, 2010

The old e-Learning is out at UF, and Sakai is in. 
Sakai, an open-source course management system, is run by 
a community of universities, including the University of Mich-igan, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Cambridge University.
It was chosen to replace UF’s previous system, WebCT Vista 
8, because Blackboard, which runs WebCT, said it would stop supporting the program by October 2012.
Already, there were plenty of problems with WebCT, accord-
ing to Doug Johnson, the manager for UF’s e-Learning Support Services, such as issues with discussion boards and e-mails.
UF has used WebCT for about 12 years, Johnson said, and 
the university has used the same version since 2004. 
UF’s contract with WebCT is expected to end in May.
Sakai is easy to learn how to use, according to Joe Burley , the 
manager of electronic learning for the College of Nursing.
He said Sakai is the best online course structure he’s seen in 
his 13 years of working with online education systems.
When a committee was formed to find WebCT’s replace-
ment, Sakai was accepted unanimously, according to the 
Course Management System Committee Report released on April 27, 2009.
Fedro Zazueta, who created the committee, said in a July in-
terview that while there were cheaper systems, the committee wanted a broad and versatile system that meets UF’s needs.
Because Sakai is open source and can be easily adapted, 
UF’s programming has duplicated almost all features that We-bCT offered, some by adding plug-ins and others by using new features.
The main new features in Sakai are blogs, RSS feeds and wi-kis, Zazueta said.
While students might be confused because they have class-
es in both WebCT and Sakai for the fall, it’s a necessary step in switching systems, Johnson said.
 He also added that professors say Sakai is easier to use, but 
it has a bit of a learning curve.
“Most faculty say it takes about two to four hours to putz 
around with the system then they get it,” he said. “A faculty member said, ‘You have to learn how to think like Sakai, then it makes sense.’”
Johnson also added that his support team has yet to meet a 
problem in Sakai that it can’t fix. 
Zazueta added that professors will use Sakai differently.“Some people will use Sakai at a very basic level, uploading 
a few files and syllabus and this type of thing,” he said. “Other people will make use of the full set of features of this system. 
As time goes by, people who feel more comfortable with the 
system will use more of the new features.” Sakai continues transition as e-Learning platform

A bar employee checks IDs Monday night in Gainesville.
Swamp, 101 Cantina, Rum Runners all on probation for violations
While Ossip said he feels the ban is un-
fair to underage customers looking to sim-
ply eat out, Gainesville Police Department 
spokeswoman Cpl. Tscharna Senn said she 
would hope those patrons would know to try other places around the city.
“This ordinance is only affecting three 
establishments within the city limits,” she said.
The situation is unfortunate for some 
underage customers, but the prohibition is the bar’s own doing, she said.
Nicole Hill, a bartender at 101 Cantina, 
said the bar has remained busy despite the ban—just with different regulars.
“There are just different crowds than be-
fore, but it’s still been busy,” Hill said. “We still have our busy nights.”
She still disapproved of the ban.“I think it’s a little ridiculous because 
it’s not going to keep people from under -
age drinking,” she said. “It’s just going to get people to go to other venues.”
The number of underage drinking in-cidents in Gainesville has dipped over the last quarter. GPD records show that since July 1, the three sanctioned bars have had no further infractions, and there have been 
no spikes in underage drinking incidents at 
other establishments.
For Tony Espetia, owner of Rum Run-
ners, it was necessary to appeal the longer 
prohibition because of the nature of the in-
fractions.
The bar had seven in-
cidents between January and March, two more 
than allowed. 
Bar owners need a 
way to defend them-
selves from bans, Espetia 
said, because it is hard to 
stave off underage cus-
tomers who use well-produced fake IDs and smuggle alcohol into the bar. 
“If it’s a good ID, and we ask them for it, 
at that point, the place should not be held accountable,” he said. “If people are trying to deceive us, that should be taking into consideration.”ORDINANCE , from page 1By KAT BEIN

The bats have left the building, 
but their horrid stench remains.
Last week, a few of the bats on 
campus likely meandered away 
from their home in the bat house near Lake Alice and took up resi-
dence in one of the classrooms at 
Weimer Hall.
According to Ken Glover, UF’s 
coordinator for pest management services, the bats do this from time to time, becoming more of a 
nuisance than an attraction.
But getting them to leave isn’t 
too hard, he said, as the bats 
were removed before students re-
turned to classes Monday.
“As best we can tell … there’s 
no sign of the bats anymore,” he 
said. “But we’re still dealing with the residual odors.”
Mike Foley, a professor of 
journalism whose office is on the third floor of Weimer, said the smell indicates that the bats haven’t left — they’ve just died in the walls and are rotting.
“In the early days, 
you could hear them squeaking in the air ducts,” he said. “It’s 
unpleasant and I don’t know that 
it’s not going to become more un-
pleasant.”
Luckily for the students, the 
stench has not permeated beyond the the top floor of Weimer.
“It just seems to be in the fac-
ulty offices,” Foley said. “The classrooms are OK, but the third-floor faculty offices are, yow!”
When they’re not terrorizing 
the nostrils of journalism profes-sors, the bats are usually hang-ing out in one of their two local 
houses. 
A new bat house near Lake 
Alice was built to replace the old 
one, which collapsed under the 
weight of the more than 100,000 
bats that live inside.According to Glover, a second 
house, called the bat farm and 
built right next to the bat house, 
was necessary to allow the colony to continue to grow.
There are at least three differ -
ent species of bats in the house: Brazilian free-tailed bats, south-eastern mouse-eared bats and 
evening bats, Glover said.
Many students and Gainesville 
residents like to visit the bat 
houses in the early evening to 
watch them emerge en masse as 
the sun goes down.Bats take up residence on top floor of Weimer Hall

Handy guide to election silly season
Judging by the tone of our current political climate, 
one would rightly assume that the results of the im-pending November elections might tear apart the 
very fabric of our society — especially the fabric of our society used in manufacturing jingoistic American flag T-shirts and vaguely racist bumper stickers.
Thankfully, I have decided to step into the fray and 
give voters a handy guide to understanding the 2010 fall elections in Florida.
This election promises to be even more unpredict-
able and flamboyant than normal, and nobody destroys normalcy with more vibrant Technicolor insanity than 
Florida. Virtually every big political office is up for grabs 
in the Sunshine State, a scenario that historically man-ages to scare up millions of dollars squirreled away by 
native parasites like developers and drug dealers to buy 
everything from television and radio ads to voodoo cer -
emonies.
However, an added bonus in our preternaturally 
slimy election season has been the twin candidacies of 
two insanely rich men who desperately want to hold 
higher office in our state. Their combined ability to 
spend money on terribly mean advertisements (which, of course, makes them overly qualified to govern) has led me to believe that the next televised debate will in-
clude at least one bat fight and/or knife wound.
One of the aforementioned rich guys is Rick Scott, a 
man running for the Republican nomination for gover -
nor by running a campaign that attempts to prove he is 
among the more vile human beings on the planet. Scott 
proved his mettle as a CEO by engineering so much cor -
rupt and immoral behavior that his health care company 
earned the biggest federal fine in history. This being Florida, he will win handily.
The other rich guy is actually 
much more wealthy and mysteri-
ous — almost like Batman, if Bat-
man concentrated mainly on hookers and blow. Jeff 
Greene decided to run as a Democrat for the open Senate seat from Florida sometime after a prolonged Caribbean 
excursion on his yacht that managed to plow through a 
coral reef off the coast of Belize and make a highly illegal stop in Cuba to replenish the boat’s supplies of rum and whores. His only real link to the Democratic Party is the fact that Mike Tyson was in his wedding.
Greene is running against Kendrick Meek to win the 
Democratic nomination for senator, and so far Greene has been successfully using his billions to bash Meek on the head and shoulders with negative ads. Whoever 
wins, though, will have to face a formidable duo in the 
general election as Charlie Crist and Marco Rubio have both made it onto the November ballot.  
Crist split off from Florida Republicans earlier this 
year after it became clear that Marco Rubio had suc-
cessfully wooed the intolerant and reactionary wing of 
the Republican Party. Unshackled by party allegiances and mixing Peter Pan with Tea Party ideals, Crist flit-ted about like a pixie governor and generally agitated 
the power structure of the Legislature. Beholden to no 
lobbyists or special interests outside of Tinkerbell and the Fairy Dust lobby, Crist looks like a formidable op-ponent — well, as formidable as one can look in a pair of green tights. 
My advice, as always, is to vote early and vote often.Tommy Maple is an international communications gradu-
ate student.
Sour Semantics
After an American 
soldier was killed in Iraq on Sunday fol-
lowing the U.S. miltary’s re-moval of combat units from 
the country, we, and certain-
ly the rest of the country, are left with a sour taste in our mouths and a yearning for what “removal of combat troops” really means — if anything. 
For many, the declara-
tion to remove all combat 
units from war-torn Iraq 
was a sign of hope that the fighting that began in 2003 would end. For others, it simply created an additional internal battle of semantics. 
In a generation where 
our newest additions to the Gator Nation were 11 years 
old when the war in Iraq 
began — and still 11 when former President Bush de-clared “Mission Accom-plished” — many of us are just tired of witnessing our fellow Americans die in combat.
So when we were told the military and President Obama decided to remove all combat units from Iraq nearly four years after Sadd-am Hussein was executed, 
naturally we assumed that 
meant the American casu-alty count would begin to slow. Just for reference, the American military casualty count is at 4,406, according to a Department of Defense statistic released Monday. 
And for many Iraqis, 
the departure of all com-bat units instills a sense of fear and apprehension that their own government and military is not yet capable of protecting its citizens. Above all, we are left with a sense of incompleteness. 
Regardless of one’s polit-
ical views, every American can surely appreciate the fact that American casual-ties in Iraq will, indeed, de-crease dramatically. 
But more than anything, 
this American soldier’s death Sunday shows the end is still not clear.Vote or Die
Students should vote 
in primary today
Lawns have changed. Watching “CSI Miami” is no longer 
safe. And don’t even think about checking the mail. 
Unless you’ve been hibernating in an igloo awaiting 
the beginning of another school year or in, well, Canada, you’re no doubt exhausted by the onslaught of TV advertisements 
that tell Floridians it’s time to “get to work;” the mailed leaflets 
throwing opponents under the political bus for voting for this 
bill or that bill; and the abundance of political signs dominating 
lawns everywhere. 
Yes, it’s primary season, Gators. It’s the time of the year 
when lawn gnomes and pink plastic flamingo lawn ornaments 
are traded for portable political pin-ups, infomercials are traded 
for attack ads and Five Star mailed coupons are exchanged for mailings with Jeff Greene’s billionaire mug. 
But as much as we’re tired of the negativity, the constant re-
minders of who’s better than whom, and the fact that we just 
want to watch “Big Brother”without another series of mud 
slinging, we also know that today’s an important day . 
And you should, too. 
If you haven’t voted in today’s primary election already , the

 Picture in your mind the most wonderful, 
pristine girl in the world.  She cooks, rips your friends when they’re being com-
plete tools, and is down for making any place her personal bedroom. For about 75 percent of 
you, the image of Vince’s porn-star girlfriend 
from Entourage pops up. Go with it. For girls, just picture Don Draper covered in ﬂ  owers and Nicholas Sparks novels.
  Now, imagine a herd of sinister masked 
men come in with crowbars and blowtorches and wallop your princess/50s sex symbol halfway to hell. They then proceed to leave her/man-god in the gutter where drunk peo-
ple stumble by to relieve themselves on what 
remains of the convulsing human pulp.
  That, my friends, is what has become of 
our beloved Facebook. What was originally designed as a facilitator to let fellow friends know where to ﬁ  nd the best parties, drug or-gies and underground cock ﬁ  ghts has degen-erated into a dumping ground for people’s in-tellectual back-alley abortions.  A few seconds 
of perusing some of your friends’ hemorrhage-
inducing statuses are enough to beg any high-er power for a malignant brain tumor.
  The culprits range in varying degrees of 
worthlessness. There are those who can’t resist telling you how much they love the soul mate they’ve been with for three days,  dropping a profound quote from the Sparknotes of that one book they read in high school or tYpInG 
n SuPa KeWl SlAnG tHaT mAkEs Ur EyEz 
BlEeD. These are the lesser forms of ﬁ  lth. 
  Then there are those who go beyond the 
call of duty and just O.J. Simpson cyberspace and get away with it — again and again.   High on the list are 
those who feel the need to pontiﬁ  cate on poli-tics that they stole from their parents’ dinner 
table. Because our state 
is thrust in the middle of an election, the troll infestation just keeps growing. Nobody cares 
if you think Barack Obama is a socialist, ji-hadist, Nigerian prince who runs pyramid schemes, or that the esteemed city commis-sioner that you pass out ﬂ  iers for gained two 
new followers on Twitter.
  Our next contestants on “Who Should Feel 
Darwin’s Hammer?” are those who can’t resist 
the burning urge to spread God’s word to all us dirty Philistines while one look at their photos from the night before would make Ted Hag-gard blush. “I can do all things through  Christ who strengthens me … even that 12th body shot off the hairy Filipino hooker.” It would 
be better if these people had a millstone tied 
around their necks and thrown into the sea. 
  It’s bad these people make a mockery of 
literary license, but they have the nerve to get a farmer’s license? I’m a fan of all God’s crea-tures, especially those served on dinner plates and draped over rich women’s shoulders, but do we really need to know how many pretend chickens were saved on FarmVille today? I 
propose a new game — Jonestown. No ani-
mals, no Maﬁ  a ﬁ  ghting wars or personality quizzes — just one bowl of punch and all the Farmer Browns that can ﬁ  t onto your screen.

 David Cantu knows he cannot cure the world 
of infectious diseases. 
  But he can bring scientists and researchers a 
step closer to decreasing their occurrence. 
  During an 11-week summer research-train-
ing program at UF’s Whitney Laboratory for 
Marine Bioscience in Marineland, Fla., Cantu studied ways to reduce the threat of malaria- and yellow fever-carrying mosquitoes. 
  “I think I just have a passion for world health 
issues, and malaria is a big problem for most of the world,” Cantu said. “I’ve always been inter-ested in how we can more effectively alleviate that threat.”
  He cites the eight years he lived in his native 
Colombia and the four years he spent in China as reasons for his passion for world health is-sues. 
  Cantu, a UF microbiology junior, was one of 
eight students who participated in the Whitney 
Laboratory Research Experience for Under-
graduates program funded by the National Sci-ence Foundation. 
  Cantu chose to study mosquito larvae and 
the way ﬂ  uorescent-coded nanoparticles travel 
through their bodies.
  Nanoparticles are made of silica and range 
in size between three to 40 nanometers and are 
ingested by the larvae. 
  One nanometer is equal to one-billionth of a 
meter, according to the website for the National Nanotechnology Initiative, a federal agency that coordinates federal nanotechnology research. 
  “I think I liked this project because it was 
more hands-on,” he said. “Also, I would be 
able to get more experience with the high-tech 
microscope. Microscope imaging could be fas-
cinating.”
  Cantu used a microscope to study the dis-
sected larvae. The microscope was equipped 
with a ﬂ  uorescent light, which made it easy to 
spot the nanoparticles.  
  Researchers hope that in the long run, these 
nanoparticles can be used to ﬁ  nd a way to kill the larvae, thus reducing the number of disease-bearing mosquitoes. 
  “If we are able to decrease the vector of dis-
ease-carrying mosquitoes, we would have more control over disease transmittance,” he said. 
  Cantu said he left the Whitney Laboratory 
with both a better understanding of the impor-tance of hands-on research and an appreciation for the mentoring he got from UF anatomy and biology professor Paul Linser.   
  “While I wouldn’t do research as a career, 
I think it is an important experience and skill every science student should take on,” Cantu said.  Student studies mosquitoes, hopes to decrease disease

Nate Brown is marked for life.
 Brown was released from the Alachua 
County Jail system in December after serving six months for selling cocaine. 
When he re-entered society after his period 
of incarceration, Brown discovered that in six months all his possessions were lost or stolen, and he no longer had the money to rent his old apartment. 
Brown became homeless — forced to ask for 
sympathetic handouts from his old drug clients and the supposed “friends” who he suspects stole his things. 
A tattoo gun that was not stolen is now his primary source of income despite not having a tattoo license.
 Brown is determined to work back to where 
he was by making use of the single thing that he still owns — a silver briefcase holding a tattoo gun and needles. 
All day, Brown walks through rough neigh-
borhoods selling tattoos to anyone with money, always working to pull himself up and prove that the challenges he faces don’t have to mark him for life.
Some of Brown’s tattoos can cost as little as 
$10 for half an hour worth of work. 
Without a tattooing license, Brown is forced 
to  offer discounts to entice potential customers and work out of his customers’ homes to keep his costs down.
The Wesley United Methodist Church offers 
free health care to the homeless community in Gainesville. Brown sufferers from asthma and-must visit the church at least once a month to refill his inhaler.
After months of hustling, saving his money 
and avoiding going back to jail, Brown now has enough money to move into an apartment of his own. 
He is no longer on probation, and he says he 
is looking forward to staying clean for his son.

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
Even before peace talks with 
the Palestinians begin, Israel’s 
government is fiercely debating a key concession: whether to extend a slowdown of West Bank settle-
ment construction.
Israeli officials confirmed Mon-
day that the government is in qui-
et talks with the United States in search of a “creative” solution that will allow at least some limited construction to take place after Is-rael’s 10-month moratorium ends on Sept. 26.
The officials said Prime Min-
ister Benjamin Netanyahu is well aware of the high stakes.
Caving in to U.S. and Palestin-
ian pressure to extend the freeze could bring down the conservative Israeli governing coalition. But re-suming settlement construction could spell disaster for the fledg-
ling peace talks.
“Many options are being dis-
cussed. It’s not that simple,” said 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor.
Palestinian officials said Mon-
day that President Mahmoud Ab-bas had sent a letter to the U.S threatening to withdraw from the 
negotiations, which are set to be-
gin next week in Washington, if the settlement freeze ends.
“If Israel resumes settlement 
activities in the Palestinian terri-tories, including east Jerusalem, we cannot continue negotiations,” Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said, quoting from the letter. He 
said the document also was sent to 
other members of the “Quartet” of Mideast mediators, the EU, U.N. and Russia.
U.S. State Department spokes-
man P .J. Crowley said Washington understands the issue’s importance and will make sure it is discussed at the start of negotiations.
“We are very mindful of the 
Palestinian position, and once we are into direct negotiations we expect that both parties will do everything within their power to create an environment for those negotiations to continue construc-tively,” he said.
Israel and the Palestinians ap-
pear to be jostling for position before the formal launch of ne-gotiations on Sept. 2 at the White House. The Palestinians are taking a tough line toward settlements, while Netanyahu this week laid down key security demands.
The roughly 120 Jewish settle-
ments that dot the West Bank have long been a sore point in Mideast peacemaking. Israel began settling the territory soon after capturing it along with Gaza and east Jerusa-lem in the 1967 war.
The Palestinians say the settle-
ments, now home to roughly 300,000 Israelis interspersed among 
some 2.4 million Palestinians, are 
gobbling up land they claim for a future state. The international community considers them illegal, and President Barack Obama has been an outspoken critic.Under intense U.S. pressure, 
Netanyahu imposed the slowdown 
last November to draw the Pal-
estinians to the negotiating table. The move barred approval of new housing construction, though hun-dreds of homes already being built were allowed to be completed.
Netanyahu quietly imposed a 
similar slowdown in east Jerusa-lem early this year after a run-in 
with the U.S. over Israeli policies 
in the area.
Israel considers east Jerusalem 
to be an indivisible part of its capi-tal and has annexed the area, but the international community does not recognize the annexation and considers the ring of Jewish neigh-
borhoods built there to be illegal 
settlements. The Palestinians seek east Jerusalem as their capital.
Netanyahu, a longtime ally of 
the settlement movement, has said the freeze is a one-time gesture. But he has not spoken publicly on the matter since the U.S. announced the upcoming resumption of peace 
talks last Friday.
Obama has made Mideast 
peace a top priority and is sure 
to put heavy pressure on Netan-yahu to leave the freeze in place. At the same time, Netanyahu will face an internal uprising within his coalition, which is dominated by nationalist and religious parties 
allied with settlers, if he maintains 
the status quo.
Officials close to Netanyahu 
confirmed that his seven-member inner Cabinet has been discussing the matter, adding that quiet talks are under way with the Americans to reach a compromise.
They spoke on condition of ano-
nymity because they were discuss-ing a secret diplomatic matter.
In Washington, a U.S. official, 
also speaking on condition of ano-nymity, confirmed the dialogue with Israel and said no decisions have been taken.
Dan Meridor, one of the more 
moderate members of the Cabinet, 
told Israel TV on Monday that he 
believes construction should re-sume only in areas that are sure to remain under Israeli control in a peace deal.
“There is no logic in building 
in territory intended for the Pal-estinian state,” he said. “By the same reason, there is no logic not 
to build in territories that will be 
inside Israel.”TUESDAY, AUGUST 24, 2010 ALLIGATOR, 11

INTERNATIONALIsrael faces challenging decision on settlement freeze  THE POKER GAME WILL 
TAKE PLACE FRIDAY.
By MIGUEL CHATELOIN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Caleb’s Pitch, a local non-profit 
organization intended to create 
memories for children with life-threatening medical conditions, will host a poker tournament at Ocala 
Poker and Jai-Alai on Friday.
The tournament will raise funds 
for the organization, which focuses 
on re-creating for ailing children some of the experiences of Caleb Jacobbe, a sports-loving 7-year-old boy who died from a rare type of kidney disease called Wilms’ tumor.
Mathematics education professor 
and Jacobbe’s uncle, Tim Jacobbe, founded Caleb’s Pitch about a year ago to “help create positive memo-ries for families” who have chil-dren suffering from severe medical conditions. According to Jacobbe, the organization provides an “ath-letic experience” by having children meet with UF football and basketball players. These experiences are cre-ated in remembrance of Caleb, who played several sports and attended a Boston Red Sox spring training ses-sion where he made a pitch.
Jacobbe is always seeking vol-
unteers, who can sign up at www.calebspitch.org/volunteer. 
While there is no need for volun-
teers in the upcoming poker tourna-ment, Jacobbe encourages students, faculty and organizations to partici-pate. 
Caleb was remem-
bered for being skilled at poker. Jacobbe said he remembers his 
nephew beating anyone, young or old, who challenged him. “He defi-nitely knew how to bluff,” Jacobbe said. “You couldn’t read him at all.” 
The tournament will have a $40 
entry fee. The winners’ pool will be  50 percent of the proceeds, while 25 percent of the proceeds will go to Caleb’s Pitch.  Ocala Poker and Jai-
Alai is at 4601 NW CR 318 in Red-
dick, Fla.Tournament to raise

An American Alligator rests along the North branch of the Chicago  River Aug. 23, in Chi-
cago. The alligator is the second to be sighted in the area this month. On Aug. 6, another alligator was captured nearby. Experts belive the alligators were once pets belonging to people in the area. In recent weeks, other cities across the United States have experienced alligator citings.
� VETERAN WAS CONVICTED 
OF MURDERING HIS WIFE.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
Some military veterans are angry 
that a World War II serviceman who 
died in prison after pleading guilty to killing his wife is scheduled to be buried Tuesday in Denver’s Fort Lo-
gan National Cemetery.
Raymond R. Sawyer, a former 
Marine from Colorado, died Aug. 
11 in a Tucson, Ariz., state prison while serving 13 years for second-degree murder. His wife, Frances A. Sawyer, was found strangled in Au-gust 1981 in Glendale, Ariz., where the couple lived. The case remained 
unsolved for 26 years.
In 2007, sometime after Raymond 
Sawyer moved to the Denver suburb 
of Arvada, a cold-case investigator from Glendale went to Arvada to in-terview him in hopes of turning up new leads, Glendale police said.
During the interview, Sawyer 
“broke down” and made statements 
about the slaying that only the killer 
could have known, Glendale spokes-man Matt Barnett said at the time.
Sawyer was arrested and taken 
to Arizona. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to prison in 2008.
Besides citing the slaying, Saw-
yer’s critics also say he once falsely claimed to have received the Navy Cross, the military branch’s second-highest medal for valor.
The only conviction that dis-
qualifies veterans from burial in a 
national cemetery is a capital crime, 
according to federal law. 
Sawyer’s case wasn’t considered 
a capital offense, Arizona officials said.
Veterans Affairs Department 
rules make no mention of disputed medals. A VA spokeswoman con-firmed the burial plans for Sawyer 
but said she couldn’t comment fur-
ther.
“It disgraces the Marine Corps 
and it dishonors the Marine Corps” 
to bury Sawyer at Fort Logan, said Joe Ryan, a former Ma-rine from Denver 
who is part of a color guard made 
up of veterans who carry the U.S. 
and Marine Corps flags at veterans’ services.
Ryan said his group refused a 
request made through the Marine Corps to participate in Sawyer’s in-terment service. Marines spokesman Greg Gordon said he couldn’t im-mediately comment on whether any 
active-duty Marines will attend.
Sawyer was 83 when he died. The 
cause of death hasn’t been released.
His daughter, Mary Sawyer, told 
KUSA-TV in Denver that the choice 
of her father’s gravesite was a family matter.Convict gets plot in

alligatorSports Mailbag UF FOOTBALL TEEING OFF WITH ANTHONY CHIANGBy MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmccall@alligator.org
 
During his most recent appearance with the media, De-
onte Thompson wore a shirt proclaiming “99 Problems But 
My Kicks Ain’t One.”
This season, the redshirt junior hopes to add his hands into 
the same category as his flashy footwear.
Thompson came to Florida with hopes of being the first 
“next Percy Harvin.” And while his career hasn’t worked out 
that way so far, he’s the top returning receiver on a team that desperately needs playmakers to emerge at wideout.
And along the way, he hopes to dispel what he considers a 
baffling myth: that he can’t catch.
“I really don’t drop balls,” Thompson told the Gainesville 
Sun.
He picked up that tag in the 2009 season opener against 
Charleston Southern, when, one play after being flagged for 
a false start, he dropped a perfectly thrown deep ball that 
would have gone for a touchdown.
It wasn’t the first drop of his career and probably won’t be 
the last. But no matter what he did from then on, he couldn’t shed the label.
None of his four touchdown catches — one 
less than tight end Aaron Hernandez — did the trick.
Not the 77-yarder in the third quarter of 
a 23-20 win against Arkansas, and not the 
stretching sideline grab in the end zone during the Sugar Bowl.
Thompson said he was bothered by the questions about 
his hands, but luckily for him, those doubts don’t exist in the 
UF locker room.
“As long as the reputation is not from our coaching staff, I 
think that’s OK,” Florida coach Urban Meyer said. “I know he 
dropped that one in the opener against Charleston Southern 
or whoever that was last year. A lot of people think he can’t 
catch, but he also made some great catches. We need him to be a ballplayer this year, and I think he will.”
Receivers coach Zach Azzanni called Thompson’s hands 
“fantastic,” and quarterback John Brantley has chimed in 
with similar praise.
So how to explain that glaring drop against Charleston 
Southern?
Meyer cites the position of Thompson’s hands on deep routes. Rather than keeping his arms raised to catch the ball 
above his shoulders, he dropped them to his chest or lower.
“‘Eye-level or higher’ is what we say to guys,” Meyer said. 
“People who catch balls [below eye level], their eyes can’t fol-low it into their hands.”
Meyer said that problem has been fixed this offseason, and 
if an improvement in Thompson’s technique shows up on the field this year, Azzanni — who was hired in the spring — is likely the reason why.
“He’s a really, really fundamental guy,” Thompson said. “That’s his main thing. He knows we can run fast and jump high, but he wanted to get us back to the basics of the game.”
One of Azzanni’s main focuses has been route-running, 
which he describes as painting a picture for Brantley.
“That means just make it easier for the quarterback by 
running good routes,” Thompson said. “That’s your artwork 
when you’re out there. That’s your craft.”
When Thompson begins working at his easel on Sept. 4 
against Miami (Ohio), he hopes he’ll be starting a masterpiece 
that ends with the ball firmly planted in his hands.Thompson prepared to catch passes, drop label
Here’s what it takes:
1. You’re really fast
2. But you’re not too 
fast. You don’t just run a go route and have the quarterback chuck 
a bomb after you get behind the 
defense. You don’t have a track ca-reer to fall back on.
3. But, still, you’re really fast.4. You run as hard as you can 
when the ball is in your hands, running through tackle attempts from guys 20, 30 pounds heavier than you. 5. You do this even though the 
whole defense keys on you. Every time you go in motion, every time you line up in the backfield, 11 men across the line of scrimmage 
want to do nothing more than stop 
you. You still average nine yards per carry.
6. You’re the best running back 
on the team, and you don’t play running back.
7. You’re also the best receiver 
on the team, and you don’t play re-ceiver. Not in the technical sense, at least. 
8. De-
spite not RE-ALLY being a receiver 
and not RE-
ALLY being a running back, NFL scouts want you. They don’t know 
where exactly to put you, but they think you will make a great new toy.
9. You are used to scouts can-
onizing your every catch, carry, leap, bound, spin and score. You were the best high school player in 
America, dammit. 
10. You avoid incendiary state-
ments. But sometimes it’s really 
hard to stay humble. Especially when you are better than everyone else.
11. You’re strong. Deceptively 
strong. Bench-press-400-plus-pounds strong.12. An injury to any starter 
is concerning. But when you go down, the collective breath of Gainesville stops. “Change” is not a strong enough word for what 
happens to the offense with you 
hurt and on the sideline. The dif-ference is noticeable even to drunk sorority girls who usually just yell “Get Him! Why don’t you get him?!” during games. The differ -
ence is night and day.
13. You are competitive. Not 
17 rules to follow if you want to excel at the “Percy position”Football

UF wide receiver Deonte Thompson has received criticism since dropping a long pass against Charleston Southern 
in the 2009 season opener. He looks to dispel the belief that he can’t catch this year. 
� According to The Hollywood Reporter, Mike “The Situation” Sor -
rentino, who is on MTV’s “Jersey Shore,” will rake in $5 million this 
year. While it should, this doesn’t surprise me one bit. Jacob from “Twilight” made millions from lifting up his shirt and flashing his abs too. � Junior kicker Caleb Sturgis was named to 
the Lou Groza Award watch list Monday. He joined 29 others in the race to earn the honor given to the nation’s best kicker. Sturgis was a semifinalist for the award last year.� Be sure to get your take out there and send

“I’m going to try as hard as I can and hope for the best” 
competitive. “Michael Jordan” competitive. 
14. This competitiveness might be out of proportion, 
but because this is America and we love winners, we cel-ebrate your hatred of losing. Then again, sports fans are fickle. The moment your “bad attitude,” which is really just the out-of-proportion competitiveness, rears its ugly head, you will be branded as a cancer.
15. When you go to the draft after college, you will fall 
much farther than you should because, again, you’re a cancer. You’re the type of person who gets barred from 
athletic competition your last semester of high school af-
ter getting in a fight at a basketball game. We hate your competitiveness. Also, you failed a drug test.
16. But who are we kidding? Without that competitive-
ness, you never would have won state championships in football and track. One of the team’s assistant coaches will have only one job during practice when you are injured: keep you off the field. But you want to be on the field so bad. Your desire to be better than everyone else drives 
you. You will play in a national championship game with a 
high ankle sprain and hairline fracture in your lower right leg. And you will be the best player on the field, gaining 174 yards on 14 touches and scoring a touchdown.
17. Oh, and you’re really fast.

JACKSONVILLE — The Jack-
sonville Jaguars failed to pressure 
quarterbacks, get off the field on third down and prevent points last 
season.
The defensive woes were the 
focus of the team’s offseason, with 
coaches, players and front office per -
sonnel eager to fix them.
But after two preseason games, 
the same problems persist. Jackson-ville’s revamped defense simply looks like it needs more work.
The Jaguars have allowed oppo-
nents to score on four of their first five possessions in both preseason games. Philadelphia scored a touch-down and three field goals in its first five drives against the Jaguars. Miami came away with three touch-downs and a field goal in its first five drives Saturday night.
“I don’t feel the need to explain a 
whole lot about preseason effort and how we’re putting things together,” coach Jack Del Rio said Monday . “I’m more interested in us going out and recognizing what we’ve got to do better and committing to the 
work necessary to get that done.”
The Jaguars have some excuses: 
lack of game-planning, several new-
comers finding their way , a different defensive scheme and several key injuries.
Three starters — linebacker 
Daryl Smith, defensive end Aaron Kampman and defensive tackle Ty-
son Alualu — missed the opener. 
They returned last weekend, but linebacker Justin Durant and corner -
back Rashean Mathis were out.
“We are still trying to get that co-
hesiveness on defense,” linebacker Kirk Morrison said.
Jacksonville gets another shot 
Saturday night against Tampa Bay, 
which will be without starting quar -
terback Josh Freeman.
Kampman, the team’s top offsea-son free agent acquisition, believes 
everything the Jaguars have done wrong can be corrected.
“Explosive plays are really what 
we’ve done,” Kampman said. “Some 
things are really easily correctable 
with our disciplined eyes, making sure that we’re in our gap.”
Maybe, but the two preseason 
performances are a bad sign for a franchise that was hoping for a de-fensive turnaround after finishing with a league-low 14 sacks last sea-son and giving up 380 points — the most since its inaugural season in 1995.
The Jaguars signed Kampman to a four-year contract worth $26 mil-lion, hoping he will return to Pro Bowl form after reconstructive knee surgery in December. They traded for linebacker Kirk Morrison, used 
their first four draft picks on defen-
sive linemen and parted ways with several aging veterans.
But how soon will all the changes 
pay off?
Kampman and Alualu, the 10th 
overall pick, played their first mean-ingful down together Saturday night and showed promise. They com-
bined to sack Chad Henne on Mi-
ami’s first offensive play. But it was pretty much the only thing Henne did wrong.
Henne completed 11 of 14 passes 
for 151 yards and two touchdowns against Jacksonville’s starters. Back-up Chad Pennington was equally efficient, throwing for 54 yards and 
a score in one series.
Del Rio pointed to issues in the 
secondary, the one position the Jag-uars didn’t address in the offseason.
“There are some things that we’re 
doing that we’ll need to do a whole 
lot better ... going forward for our football team to have success that 
we intend on having,” Del Rio said. 
“We’re going to have to play better back there. There are still some ba-sic leverage in tackling issues that we’ve got to rectify.”
He used Anthony Fasano’s 55-
yard touchdown reception as one example, saying the tight end should have been stopped a few yards from 
the line of scrimmage instead of run-
ning untouched into the end zone.
“It was shoddy leverage and 
tackling on that play,” Del Rio said. “It’s real easy to see. Those are basic football plays that we’ve got to do better, basic stuff. You’re not talking about anything other than an eye violation and then a poor job of le-
veraging and tackling, and when we 
do those better, it’ll look a whole lot better.”
Jags concerned with preseason defensive struggles
“We are still trying to get 
that cohesiveness on de -
fense.”

UF wide receiver Chris Rainey will be the team’s punt returner. He fielded four punts, gaining 40 total return 
yards last season. Running back Jeff Demps will return kickoffs.

The Gators enter the season 
with many question marks, but 
two were erased Monday.
Coach Urban Meyer an-
nounced wide receiver Chris Rain-ey will be Florida’s punt returner, and running back Jeff Demps will handle kickoff returns. 
The pair played in those roles 
at times last season, as Demps returned two kickoffs for 55 to-tal yards and Rainey racked up 40 punt return yards on four at-
tempts.
However, Demps won’t be 
alone on kickoffs. UF will send 
another player with him as a lead blocker.
“[Running back Mike Gillislee] 
will be back there,” Meyer said. “We even talked about (quar -
terback) Trey Burton being back 
there, but he still has to [get better 
at handling] the ball.”
Meyer mentioned corner -
back Janoris Jenkins and receiver Frankie Hammond Jr. as other po-tential punt returners. Hammond, who is back on the team after be-ing suspended because of a DUI arrest this summer, saw action on 
both return teams last year.
MEYER DISAPPOINTED: Meyer wasn’t impressed with his team’s showing in training camp.
Many expected members of 
the talented incoming freshman 
class to earn starting spots, but that didn’t happened. Meanwhile, injuries to offensive linemen Matt Patchan and Xavier Nixon and defensive linemen Lawrence Marsh and Brandon Antwine 
have slowed the team’s progress.
“I’m hitting the panic button 
a little bit,” Meyer said. “We’ve 
got to get better faster than what we are right now. It’s not that we aren’t good, it’s just the consisten-cy of the offensive and defensive line — we have to get them all in there.”
INJURY REPORT: Injuries are 
piling up for the Gators.
According to Meyer, Antwine 
suffered a “little concussion” be-fore Saturday’s scrimmage, and the defensive tackle did not dress out Monday. He is expected to re-turn to practice today.
Nixon is being held out of ac-
tion with an undisclosed knee in-jury . Meyer said the injury could keep him out “for a couple of weeks.” Nixon suffered an ankle injury earlier in training camp and had recently returned to practice. 
Also, receiver Justin Williams’ 
right arm was in a sling Monday because of a shoulder injury.WR Rainey, RB Demps named UF’s return menTUESDAY, AUGUST 24, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 23

Tiger Woods and his Swed-
ish-born wife officially divorced 
Monday, nine months after his middle-of-the-night car crash out-
side their home set off shocking 
revelations that the world’s most famous athlete had been cheating on her through multiple affairs.
“We are sad that our marriage 
is over and we wish each other the very best for the future,” Woods and Elin Nordegren said in a joint statement released by 
their lawyers.
The divorce was granted in Bay 
County Circuit Court in Panama 
City, about 375 miles away from their Isleworth home outside Or -
lando. The couple married in Oc-tober 2004 in Barbados and have a 3-year-old daughter, Sam, and an 18-month-old son, Charlie.
The marriage was described in 
court documents as “irretrievably broken” with no point in trying to reconcile. Terms of the divorce were not disclosed, except that they will “share parenting” of their two children.
“We love Elin, and we are so 
proud of the grace and strength she has shown during this dif-
ficult time,” Nordegren’s father, 
Thomas Nordegren, a talk show host at national broadcaster Swedish Radio told The Associat-ed Press. “We know that she will come out of this even stronger and has a bright future in front of her.”
The divorce was finalized by 
Bay County Circuit Judge Judy Pittman Biebel during a brief hearing in a conference room in her chambers, according to Bieb-el’s judicial assistant Kim Gibson. The hearing lasted no more than 10 minutes. Woods and Norde-gren were present along with their lawyers, Gibson said.
“I don’t comment on active 
cases,” Thomas J. Sasser, Woods’ divorce attorney, said. When asked why they chose to file in Panama City, Sasser said it was a joint decision by the lawyers.Nordegren’s attorneys — 
which included her twin sister, London-based Josefin Lonnborg — referred all questions to the statement.
Woods’ agent, Mark Steinberg, 
declined comment when asked if the couple had a prenuptial agreement or terms of the settle-ment. “We’re not commenting beyond what was in the release,” 
he said.
Nordegren’s 
mother, Barbro 
Holmberg, also 
declined com-ment.
Norde-
gren, who once worked as a nanny for Swed-
ish golfer Jesper Parnevik, asked to have her maiden name re-stored as Elin Maria Pernilla Nor -
degren.
The couple signed a marital 
settlement agreement on July 3 and July 4, the weekend of the AT&T National outside Phila-delphia, where Woods failed to break par in a PGA Tour event for the first time in 11 years.
The sordid sex scandal cost 
Woods three major corporate 
sponsors — Accenture, AT&T 
and Gatorade — worth millions of dollars, and he lost his image as the gold standard in sports endorsements. A month after the scandal became public, Woods spent two months in therapy at a Mississippi clinic with hopes of saving his marriage.
“While we are no longer mar -
ried, we are the parents of two wonderful children and their hap-piness has been, and will always be, of paramount importance to both of us,” they said in the state-ment. “The weeks and months ahead will not be easy for them as we adjust to a new family situ-ation, which is why our privacy must be a principal concern.”
According to court documents, 
Woods completed the Ameri-can Safety Institute’s four-hour course on “Parent Education and Family Stabilization” on July 10, 
the day before he left to play 
the British Open at St. Andrews. Woods, who had won the previ-ous two times at St. Andrews by a combined 13 shots, tied for 23rd.
Nordegren completed her 
four-hour class through Flor -
idaParentingClass.com on Aug. 16, the day after Woods tied for 
28th in the PGA Championship at 
Whistling Straits.
Documents also show the two 
children lived at their primary home at Isleworth until Novem-ber 2009 — Woods crashed his SUV over the fire hydrant and into a tree on Nov. 27 — and that Nordegren had moved out to a 
nearby residence since then.
Woods is to play this week at 
The Barclays, where he needs a 
good performance to extend his PGA Tour season and try to show he is worth picking for the Ryder Cup. It will be his first tournament as a single man since he finished ninth in a World Golf Champion-
ship in Ireland in October 2004.
