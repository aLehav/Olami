68/44How heart handles anger predicts irregular beat
WASHINGTON (AP) — How the heart handles anger seems 
to predict who’s at risk for a life-threatening irregular heartbeat.
Negative emotions like hostility and depression have long 
been considered risks for developing heart disease, and deaths 
from cardiac arrest rise after disasters such as earthquakes.
But research released Monday goes a step farther, uncovering 
a telltale pattern in the EKGs of certain heart patients when they merely recall a maddening event — an anger spike that foretold bad news. In already vulnerable people, “anger causes electrical changes in the heart,” said Dr. Rachel Lampert, a Yale University cardiologist who led the work.Ana Goni-Lessan / Alligator

A  man’s body was found in a car near 
the UF campus Monday afternoon.
The body is believed to be that of John 
F. Waldo, 42, a Gainesville man who went 
missing on Feb. 11, according to Gainesville Police Department spokesman Keith Kameg.
A resident at the house the car was 
parked in front of, located along the 1900 block of Northwest Second Avenue, called GPD after noticing the body. Forensics ar-rived and found the body in the back seat of a 2001 BMW 330i with the temporary Flori-da tag ACM9754, Kameg said.GPD is waiting for autopsy results before 
determining the cause of death or provid-
ing an absolute identification of the man, although police believe it to be Waldo because the vehicle and clothing match 
the description of the missing man, Kameg said.
He added that the department would be conducting a death investigation and is un-sure whether or not foul play was involved.
Waldo was last seen on Feb. 11 at Calico 
Jack’s Oyster Bar. He did not show up for work the next day, and there has been no word from him since.
Police are asking anyone with informa-
tion regarding the disappearance to call De-tective Cpl. Bennie Smith at 352-334-2488.

IHOP will give out free pan-
cakes today to celebrate Nation-
al Pancake Day.
The fundraiser, proceeds 
from which will go to the Chil-dren’s Miracle Network at Shands Children’s Hospital, will run from 6 a.m. to midnight.
Scott Stazzone, the general 
manager of the Gainesville IHOP, said customers will get a free short-stack of three but-termilk pancakes. Donations to the Children’s Miracle Network are not required, but last year the Southwest 13th Street IHOP served more than 1,000 orders and raised $781, he said.
Other Florida IHOPs also 
raised money. 
Monica Haynes, the program 
coordinator for the Children’s Miracle Network at Shands, said that Florida IHOPs donat-ed $10,997 to the organization. 
Nationwide, IHOPs raised 
$875,000 for the Children’s Mir-acle Network last year, said Dan 
Ischy, an IHOP spokesman.
IHOP began National Pan-
cake Day in 2006, and it takes 
place each year on Fat Tuesday to honor the English tradition of making pancakes before the be-ginning of Lent, Ischy said. 
However, students see more 
in this event than the history be-hind it.
Joadi-Kay Benjamin, a UF 
business management sopho-more, said she is attracted by the word “free” because she is a college student during a reces-sion.
She plans to stop by IHOP 
at about 8 a.m. Tuesday and make a donation. She added that IHOP will probably also make money from people who IHOP celebrates

Students will have the chance 
to vote on three referendum ques-
tions and one initiative on today’s 
Student Government ballot.The referendum questions are 
non-binding, and the initiative would be incorporated into Stu-
dent Body statutes if a majority of 
students are in favor of it.
Possibly the most controversial 
of the four items is the initiative 
relating to hand scanners at UF’s recreational facilities.
The question asks students if 
they would like to withhold SG funding from facilities that require 
students to submit biometric data, 
such as a hand scan, for entry.
A similar question was on last 
semester’s ballot, but it was a non-binding referendum. Eighty four percent of students voted against 
requiring hand scans for entry into 
campus gyms.
UF student Sen. Jonathon Os-
sip, who submitted the initiative on this semester’s ballot, said he is trying to make sure the will of the 
students is implemented.
He said the initiative will not prevent UF from installing the 
scanners but said they would have 
to be optional, or else Rec Sports 
would lose its student funding. 
Almost 99 percent of the depart-ment’s budget is funded through 
students’ Activities & Service Fee, according to David Bowles, UF’s Hand-scanner initiative a big ballot issue

� ‘SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE’ 
WON EIGHT OSCARS.
By EMILY FUGGETTA
Alligator Writer
 
Oscar night for movie buffs is like 
the World Series for baseball lov-
ers, but after the Academy Awards Sunday, some felt like Red Sox fans watching the Yankees take the tro-phy yet again.
“It was entirely predictable,” 
said Maureen Turim, professor and director of film and media studies at UF. “There were no big surprises.”
“Slumdog Millionaire” snagged 
a staggering eight out of 24 award categories, stirring mixed emotions in movie fans.
“I had some problems with the 
film,” Turim said. “It’s that pattern of Hollywood taking over a foreign idiom.”
Although the British director, 
Danny Boyle, won an award, Turim said the film catered to Americans.
One award that Turim felt was 
well-deserved was  Heath Ledger’s supporting role win for “The Dark Knight,” which made him only the second actor to receive a posthu-mous Oscar. Turim said that Led-ger’s recent death did not bolster his 
win.
“It was a great per-
formance,” she said. “I’m glad he was rec-ognized.”
She said she also appreciated the 
Academy’s recognition of “Milk,” though it didn’t win Best Picture.
Andrea Stokes, director of Lesbi-
an, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender affairs at UF, said “Milk,” based on  the gay politician and activist Har-vey Milk, deserved its two awards.
“Films about other great leaders 
like Ghandi have won awards,” she said. “So it’s really exceptional that 
such leaders in the LGBT commu-
nity are being recognized.”
Despite a few high points, like 
Penelope Cruz’s recognition for “Vicky Christina Barcelona,” Turim said that 2008 was a poorer cinemat-ic year than 2007. She said that many of the films relied on famous faces more than quality.“Hollywood casts its money-
makers,” she said, citing the correla-tion between the fame of a cast and the film’s box office success.
Steven Thompson, an English 
sophomore who has taken film 
classes at UF, said that the Academy 
rewarded filmmakers who took their pet projects and turned them into something bigger.
“I think the Oscars should be 
about artistic expression and not a big budget,” he said. “Overall, it was an Oscars for people who really love movies.”

The possibility of a $5.3 million budget cut 
next year has caused the dean of UF’s Col-lege of Engineering to consider replacing the phone lines with magicJack, the inexpensive 
Internet phone system famous for its late night 
infomercials.
“I did it at home,” said Pramod Khar-
gonekar, dean of the college. “I got magicJack myself.” 
Khargonekar spoke to about 150 students 
Monday night in a town hall forum about what budget cuts could mean for the college.One thing Khargonekar said he will not 
consider when making cuts is laying off ten-ured and tenure-track faculty because it would cripple the college’s ability to recruit new pro-fessors.
“If you do a great job, then you  have a job 
forever,” he said. “That’s the definition of ten-ure.”
Like all colleges and administrative units, 
the engineering college was asked by UF President Bernie Machen in January to present budget proposals for the next academic year with 10 percent cuts, which Machen calls a “worst-case scenario.”
Under the proposals, the college will have 
to reduce its budget from about $55 million to just under $50 million, Khargonekar told students. Last year, he said, the college had to slash about $7 million.
After Khargonekar explained the size of the 
possible cuts, he opened the floor for an hour-and-a-half question and answer session.
He told students that if the college has to 
cut 10 percent, the budget for teaching assis-tants would likely be reduced and classes with fewer students could be offered less frequent-ly, perhaps once a year.
He also said departments within the col-
lege might be merged, open faculty positions might remain unfilled and professors might 
be asked to teach classes in different depart-
ments to help share the teaching load.
Joanna Sandford, a fourth-year UF indus-
trial and systems engineering major, said she appreciated the dean’s effort to engage stu-dents but hopes the cuts don’t delay her grad-uation date.
“What if two classes are offered at (the) 
exact same time, and I need both of them to 
graduate, and they’re both offered only once a 
year?” she said after the forum.Engineering college outlines budget cut implicationsNewsLocal

Student Government parties 
bombarded students with campaign 
materials and creative expressions of partisanship on Monday in a final push to win votes before elections, 
which begin today from 8 a.m. to 8 
p.m. and continue on Wednesday. 
“At this point, we’re trying to get 
our message out there,” said Donte Hargrove, Orange and Blue Party president. 
Mark McShera, the party’s presi-
dential candidate, said party sup-porters will be stationed outside 
polling locations today encouraging 
students to vote. He expects a good turnout this year. 
“Last year’s national election 
turned students on to politics,” Mc-Shera said. “They’re more willing to talk to us and listen to our ideas.”
The Orange and Blue Party 
painted the 34th Street wall Monday 
night in hopes of furthering their 
campaign. 
Monday the Unite Party presi-
dential candidate Jordan Johnson held a “Day and Night with Unite,” 
a 24-hour campaign effort, which 
included a block party on Sorority Row and painting the 34th Street wall.
A “blue out” was held Monday 
where candidates, volunteers and 
party supporters all wore blue to 
promote the Unite Party.  
Some more enthusiastic support-
ers even painted themselves blue, while one member dressed up in a blue Spider-Man suit and roamed campus. 
Ben Dictor, presidential candi-
date for the Progress Party said he used his Alligator endorsement as a selling point Monday when talking to students about voting. The edito-
rial was taped to his party’s table in 
Turlington Plaza. 
Dictor said the Progress Party’s 
main focus is on “material produc-tion,” handing out about 7,000 fliers, which he added are all recyclable, and hanging about six signs.
One more unconventional sign 
included the executive candidates 
standing with President Barack 
Obama and rap star Lil Wayne.
“It’s a poetic interpretation,” Dic-
tor said. “Barack Obama represents progress, Lil Wayne represents be-ing bad-ass, and the helicopter in 
the background shows we fight crime.”
The Lower 
13th Street Jazz Band was kicked out of Turlington Plaza Monday after-noon when  its members decided to give a free concert while displaying a sign reading, “When Unite Loses We All Win.” 
They relocated to the Plaza of the 
Americas after the University Police 
Department issued a noise viola-
tion.
UF political science senior David 
Borenstein, the band’s clarinet play-er and creator of the sign, said the band was not affiliated with a politi-cal party and wants to create an SG free of cronyism.
“We’ve created a system with no 
accountability,” he said.
Charles said she was taken by 
surprise when the band started play-ing in Turlington Plaza.
“People are free to express their 
opinion,” she said. “But it’s a pretty malicious thing to do.”
“I’m really excited the time has fi-
nally arrived,” Charles said. “We’re 
exited to see how everything pans 
out.”SG parties make

� OFFICERS FOUND 12.7 
GRAMS OF CRACK.
By KATIE EMMETS

A Gainesville man was arrested 
for possessing guns and crack co-
caine after a police foot chase. 
After getting a tip early Sunday 
morning that there was a man wav-ing a gun in a downtown  parking garage, Gainesville Police officers arrived to find a man matching the description. 
When police approached, the 
man told police that he wasn’t the one they were looking for and pointed to another man in a white shirt, said GPD spokesman Keith 
Kameg.
When attention shifted to the 
man in white, he ran out of the ga-
rage. After chasing him four blocks, police caught Lashard Isaac, 22, the GPD arrest report stated.  
While searching Isaac’s car in 
the parking garage, officers found a .45-caliber Glock handgun under the driver’s seat, the report stated.
Officers also found a plastic 
tube containing 12.7 grams of crack cocaine that was packaged for indi-vidual sale, according to the report. Because Isaac was convicted for 
grand theft  in 2007, he was charged 
with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.
He was also charged with sale 
of a controlled substance within 1,000 feet of a church, possession of a controlled substance and resist-ing an officer without violence.Guns, crack found after chaseStudentGovernmentBy CHELSEA KEENAN

Winning student votes 
doesn’t come cheap.  Par-
ties spent a pretty penny this 
election season, with the ma-jority of funds spent on T-shirts. The rest went toward campaign materials, such as 
fliers and stickers. 
Three of the four parties 
running — the Orange and 
Blue Party, the Progress 
Party and the Unite Party 
—  raised at least $12,493, ac-cording to campaign finance records. 
The Orange and Blue 
Party did not have the latest financial report available by deadline, so the party’s latest expenses were not factored 
in to the final sum. 
The Progress Party spent 
$1,275 on T-shirts, while the 
Unite Party spent $2,200, ac-cording to expense reports, 
which are filed every Mon-
day night to monitor party expenses. The Orange and Blue Party spent $2,028 on 
shirts.
“T-shirts are a big ex-
pense, but people like them,” 
said the Unite Party candi-date for Student Body trea-
surer, James Greenwood, 
adding they are a good in-vestment since the clothing serves as walking advertise-ments. 
The Unite Party also 
spent a heavy portion of its 
donations, which totaled 
$6,670, on party parapherna-lia. About $420 went toward stickers and about $480 was 
spent on pencils, according 
to reports.  
Progress Party Treasurer 
Peter Laumann said his par-ty’s spending goal was just 
to get the message across ef-fectively. 
“The point is not to buy 
people’s votes,” he said.
SG records show the 
Progress Party has raised about $2,300, and spent 
about $306 on fliers and $208 
on stickers.
The Keg Party has neither 
raised nor spent any money 
on its campaign, although 
Frank Bracco, Keg Party president, donated $200 to the Orange and Blue Party, according to records.
“Money isn’t the biggest 
part of our campaign. Out campaign is about ideas. Our platform is ultimately 
what will get us votes,” said

� THE ANNUAL COST OF A STUDENT DECAL 
WILL INCREASE FROM  $122 to $134.
By KRISTEN HUFF
Alligator Contributing Writer
 
When a new parking garage goes up on UF’s cam-
pus, the price of parking decals will likely also rise.
One of the proposed amendments to UF’s regulations 
in an annual review by UF Transportation and Parking 
Services would increase the cost of parking decals across 
the board by about 10 percent, said Bob Miller, associate 
vice president of business affairs . 
The proposed increase is largely due to rising utility 
costs, general maintenance costs and the need to gener-ate revenue to pay for the new parking garage on Gale Lemerand Drive.
The annual cost of a student decal would increase 
from $122 to $134, while the annual cost of decals for UF faculty would increase from $258 to $282. 
Miller said Transportation and Parking Services is 
self-sustaining and does not receive state funds. 
Transportation and Parking Services had a $650,000 
utility bill for the 2007 to 2008 fiscal year, Miller said. The projected utility bill for this year is $900,000. 
Additionally, UF paid for the new parking garage 
with borrowed money by selling bonds. Miller said the bond payments are going to increase by $500,000 this year.
A small part of the proposed increase would also 
account for the increase in the state sales tax, which in-creased from 6.25 percent to 6.75 percent. To pass, the amendments will have to be approved in 
March by the Board of Trustees, UF’s highest governing body. If passed, the amendments would go into effect 
April 1, Miller said. 
The board is also expected to approve an amend-
ment that will formalize UF’s contract made with RTS 
last year that allows the spouses and domestic partners of UF students, faculty and staff to use RTS services for free, Miller said. 
Another amendment was recommended to the 
board that would expand the definition of “employees” to include Shands at UF employees as well, though the hospital  employees have been able to buy UF employee decals in the past, Miller said. 
It would also exclude Segways and mopeds from the 
definition of “motor vehicle,” meaning owners would not have to get decals for those devices. Miller said 
mopeds differ from scooters because they can be ped-
aled and are basically motorized bikes, thus they can be parked on the campus bike racks.  
Miller said the amendments are part of an annual re-
view of parking regulations.
“Every year when we revise the parking regulations, 
we look for things that are like, ‘Oh—that’s not really clear,’” he said.More parking brings more feesSG campaigns

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
PITTSBURGH — An 11-year-
old boy apparently covered his 
shotgun with a blanket to keep it hidden when he left his bedroom, 
went downstairs and fatally shot his 
father’s pregnant girlfriend in the head as she slept, a prosecutor said Monday.
The blue blanket, which has a 
quarter-sized hole that appeared to be singed from a shotgun blast, supports a claim that the crime was premeditated, Lawrence County 
District Attorney John Bongivengo 
said.
Police found the blanket in the 
farmhouse where the boy, Jordan Brown, lived with his father; the fa-
ther’s girlfriend, Kenzie Marie Houk; and her two daughters, ages 7 and 
4. Houk was killed Friday morning 
while Brown’s father was at work and the two girls were in the home, authorities believe.“The operating theory is that he 
covered the gun with the blanket to hide it when he came downstairs” from his bedroom to shoot Houk, Bongivengo said. “It wasn’t used to muffle (the shot) or anything, the blanket wasn’t thick enough for that.”
After shooting Houk, the boy 
ran to get on a school bus with the 
7-year-old, who saw him toss some-
thing from his pocket on the ground, Bongivengo said. Police later found a spent 20-gauge shotgun shell there.11-year-old murder premeditatedStudentGovernment

Octomom draws similarities to stimulusColumn Out of the Wild
Last week a New York cartoonist sparked a national 
controversy by directly relating a rampaging, face-biting monkey to the stimulus package recently 
signed into law. 
Combining these current events in a heavy-handed and 
insensitive manner, the cartoonist also managed to make little to no sense — had Oliver the chimp really been more 
involved in the passage of the stimulus bill, the legisla-
tion surely would have called for more domestic banana production.  
A far more appropriate connection between current 
events dominating the news cycle in early February would 
be linking the spending bill to octuplet mom Nadya Sule-
man. Even the blogosphere-induced names of the two news items, Porkulus and Octomom, both sound like the names of second-rate Spiderman villains.
The stimulus bill has no father, just like our highly vis-
ible octuplets. President Barack Obama nurtured this bill and protected it from harm by using up some of his im-mense political capital, and he will see this bill through a difficult adolescence into the maturity of program imple-
mentation. Obama is the momma.  
Nobody else in the Democratic leadership has the abil-
ity or will to act as a surrogate father to this big piece of 
legislation.
Even Nancy “Crazy Eyes” Pelosi seems to have backed 
off and left this whole enchilada to Obama. Congressional Republicans are too busy praying six times a day towards an autographed poster of “Bedtime for Bonzo” to handle fatherly duties.  
Octomom just birthed her second batch of lab kids, 
so her past behavior clearly points to an unsurprising propensity for unfrozen babies. The stimulus package is notable for its bloated size, but it is essentially all of Obama’s cam-paign promises rolled into one bill. 
Putting shovels into the ground, 
funneling money into education and bringing up tax rates on the wealthy are three of the main te-
nets of Obama’s stump speeches.  
Both Obama and Octomom 
stayed true to their convictions, be 
they ideas about the best way to 
spend a few billion dollars or the relative sanity of having 
14 kids and no money.  
Obama and Octomom also have both taken a beating in 
the press over their February babies. Anger has cascaded 
down on Octomom for her obvious insanity and complete 
inability to even fake sanity for a few precious seconds, 
culminating in her receiving death threats. This is clearly wrong — the Supreme Court outlawed executions of the mentally retarded in 2002.
Obama, on the other hand, is catching flak for spend-
ing a bunch of China’s money and taxing the rich to pay for it. Governors of five states have said that they will re-fuse some or all of the stimulus money allocated to them because of the attached rules that force the states to per-
manently raise taxes to pay back some of the funding. 
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said Sunday that it is like “spending a dollar to get a dime.”  
If Louisiana and those other states leave that money on 
the table, I can think of at least one mother of 14 who may 
be looking for some love — and a little extra cash. 
Tommy Maple is an international communications gradu-
ate student. His column appears on Tuesdays.For at-risk youth in Ala-
chua County, hope for a second chance starts 
at the Gainesville Wilderness Institute.
When juvenile offenders 
in the area begin the process of reintegrating into public schools, the Institute serves to bridge the gap and assist students in the uphill battle to improve their behavior, and in some cases, beat drugs. 
According to a Gainesville 
Sun article, the institute was founded in 1991 and provides a four- to six-month program for 14-to-18-year-olds who need hands-on guidance in a heavily structured  environ-ment. 
From a daily class sched-
ule to rehabilitation classes 
addressing substance abuse, 
the Institute goes above and beyond the facets of a tradi-tional school.
While at the Institute, 
students have the opportu-nity to be rewarded for their progress through different colored t-shirts. Specifically, as they get closer to gradu-ating from the program, stu-dents are given shirts that correspond with the strides that they have made. But this 
school is no joke — students 
must maintain a strict dress code and cannot even go to the bathroom without having an escort.
The Editorial Board com-
mends the efforts of the Gainesville Wilderness Insti-tute for offering troubled stu-
dents the chance to right their 
wrongs. Too often there is a cyclical nature to the behav-ior of teenagers that remains uncorrected due to a lack of resources and assistance.
Many young adults suffer-
ing from drug or behavioral problems eventually end up 
in prison if not for programs 
like the Institute.
Students may enter the 
program with a bleak outlook for the future, but with hard work and a helping hand, the Gainesville Wilderness Insti-tute opens doors for even the most unruly of youth.While a typical study abroad trip may include bask-
ing in the Australian sun, UF’s latest overseas offer-
ing will take students even further down under.
In an announcement released by the university Monday, 
the College of Health and Human Performance invited stu-dents to apply for the opportunity to spend nearly two weeks 
studying in Antarctica. Combined with an online course tak-en in the Fall 2009 semester, students will depart on the trip 
mid-December and earn six credits for their work. According 
to UF, the course of study will include history and marine and terrestrial biology as well as aspects of the continent’s 
geology and climate.
The Editorial Board encourages you to apply for the pro-
gram, as the initial details reveal a wealth of information about what should prove to be an amazing experience. What 
better than being able to immerse yourself among the many whales, penguins and orcas that call the region home? Sure 
you can go to Barcelona and party your ass off, but we’re 
pretty sure that’s hardly different from what goes on here in Gainesville.
If you have the ways and the means to attend UF’s study 
abroad trip to Antarctica, we implore you to drop this news-paper, click off our Web site and apply right now. Not to get 
all sentimental with you, but the greatest memories of college 
will not stem from mindless lectures, but rather the once-in-a-lifetime opportunities that expand your horizons and give 
you a greater semblance of the world’s possibilities.
What are you waiting for?

Guest column
Even as a naïve freshman, I 
have already been exposed to far more Student Govern-
ment politics than anyone would ever want to know. Ever since the “green means go” scandal in which several members of the 
Gator Party were implicated for 
fixing interviews so that only indi-viduals with select organizational affiliations would be selected, I have been interested in discover-
ing what really goes on in SG elec-
tions.
Florida Blue Key, UF’s equiva-
lent to Skull and Bones, started in 
the 1930s and propagated a sys-tem to elect Southern white male 
elites to high office at the univer-sity. This society refused to open 
its membership to women and 
minorities until the 1970s, and even then it was because they saw electoral opportunity. Florida Blue 
Key decided to offer a relatively 
unchanging number of senate seats to members of groups like Black Student Union and Hispanic Student Association in exchange 
for support. Eventually minori-
ties were offered positions as vice president and treasurer, but there was a catch — minorities were not 
allowed to run for Student Body president. 
If you go 
to the Reitz 
Union on 
the third floor, one thing you will 
notice is that the vast majority of our Student Body presidents have 
been white males. If you check 
their organizational affiliations, you will find that the vast major-ity of them are from a handful of fraternities. The few exceptions to 
this rule are people who fought 
against the system after they dis-covered that it was not about who was the most qualified. 
The system that now supports the Unite Party had its dirty laun-dry exposed in 1996, when some of its members lied and accused their 
opponent of being a child molest-
er, which resulted in an $85,000 settlement against Florida Blue Key. The Unite Party is the new-
est iteration of the Gator Party line 
that has ruled UF’s Student Gov-ernment for more than 70 years. It has been able to do this because no one challenges it. 
There are wonderful people and 
outstanding candidates running with the Unite Party, but UF is bet-ter than its system of Student Gov-
ernment. Some of the best student leaders ignore SG because they see 
it for what it has become: an insti-tution to aid in the padding of re-
sumes that does not reward merit. 
SG is unimportant in the grand scheme of life, but nevertheless, as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said, 
“a threat to justice somewhere is a 
threat to justice everywhere.”
What I propose is that the mem-
bers of Unite Party that are know-ingly submitting themselves to 
such an immoral system withdraw 
and run under a different party or not at all. 
Travis Hornsby is a political sci-
ence and economics freshman.
UF President Bernie Machen’s recent 
statements concerning a desire to fo-cus mostly on graduate education is 
troubling. In itself, setting a goal to become the best research university in the nation isn’t 
a bad thing, but only focusing on the programs 
that attract the most grant money forecasts a dire picture of UF’s future. 
This is already evident within the sciences 
if you compare the vast resources the biomedi-cal sciences enjoy to the relative dearth of re-search dollars funding the equally important basic biological sciences. If we continue down this path, you will see a sidelining and dete-
rioration of graduate areas, which are the core 
of an undergraduate education as teaching as-sistants are often the people who undergrads interact with the most. 
As a graduate student in the College of 
Medicine conducting research in a well-funded, relevant field, you would think I’d be happy that UF wanted to put focus on money-making areas like my own. But I know 
I would be nowhere if it weren’t for the solid 
undergraduate education I received right here at UF.   
One of my biggest complaints as an under-graduate, though, was that professors were 
too focused on their research and generally 
disinterested in education. 
Putting even more pressure on faculty to 
become nothing but cash cows will only exac-erbate this problem, and while it may boost our statistics as a research institution, it will only cheapen the experience of every undergradu-ate student and turn them off to learning. This would be a huge disservice to the public. En-couraging research and graduate education is fine, as long as it doesn’t come at the expense 
of others’ educational experience. What we 
should be discussing is greater resource shar-ing and collaboration between departments in parallel with an active role in evaluating and modernizing our educational model for both graduate students and undergraduates. 
While research is what fuels this university 
and all of its various functions, it is the diverse array of undergraduate students that makes 
UF different from just a private research facil-
ity and a treasure worth preserving.

student.
Machen needs to switch focusUnite Party benefits from discriminatory power system
I was dismayed to read the misrep-
resentation and misinformation in Kyle Robisch’s Friday column. 
Representing the Fall 2007 Progress 
Party as pompous and not distinguish-
ing it from the new Progress Party is intellectually dishonest. And certain-ly, Robisch must have noticed in the past year or so the partisan bickering 
between Orange & Blue and Gator, 
now Unite. The butting of heads was clearly displayed during Wednesday’s 
presidential concluding remarks, Sun-
day’s debate and many other times.
The new Progress Party has success-
fully stood above the “politics of old.” In fact, I would put them in a category 
much different, and more noble, from 
“politics.” A significant number of the people running and helping the party are brand new to this game, unlike Ro-bisch, but I consider that refreshing to 
the “fundamentally broken SG.” But 
Progress is not all new; we have some of the best veteran SG politicians who have already swum against the tide. 
Streaming Senate video sessions is 
not “petty” at all. One thing Robisch missed when gathering what the stu-dents want is a transparent and ac-countable SG. Having more 
people see what is going on is 
an easy and in-
expensive way toward this noble and democratic goal of fixing SG. The main problem with this system is that about 80 percent of students do not vote be-
cause they are jaded or do not even 
know what SG does.
Finally, to cut this short, I do not 
believe Unite brings “promise.” After four years here, I have always seen one party with the most glossy flyers, the most forced votes and the same prom-ises, but little if anything ever hap-
pens. This year, that party is Unite.
Progress, on the other hand, is not 
the typical indie or oppositional party. 
The executive candidates have sworn off their potential salaries because 
they know others can use that money 
more than they can. For those I have met in the Progress Party, these issues are not talking points for an election. These are personal issues that we truly 
care about.

Teresa Shum, a UF journalism 
sophomore, said people like to do-nate to causes benefiting children.
It’s hard for people to say no to 
kids, she said.
But the fundraiser benefits IHOP as well.
Roy Carson, a server at the 
Gainesville IHOP, said the event is good publicity. He said that he needs coffee to get through the busy day.
Stazzone said the IHOP was 
packed during last year’s event, and customers lined up along the outside of his IHOP to wait for their pancakes.
However, Stazzone said the 
event still makes him feel fabulous.
“I love it,” he said. “I think it’s 
the best thing that IHOP has ever done.”Donations will go to Children’s Miracle Network

State Rep. Kurt Kelly spoke at UF Tuesday night 
about conservative politics and issues ranging from 
Obama’s stimulus package to global warming.
Fifteen students attended the event, which was host-
ed by UF’s Network for Enlightened Women.
Kelly, who was named Freshman Legislator of the 
Year, spoke to the largely female crowd about the im-portance of today’s generation getting involved in po-
litical decision-making sooner rather than later.
“I apologize to your generation from mine,” Kelly 
said. “We are the baby boomers, the self-indulged. This 
burden is going to be handed down to your generation.” 
The Ocala native also spoke about the 
lack of rising leaders in conservative poli-
tics, an absence of a clear party direction, a lack of en-
thusiasm and a poor articulation of values, all of which 
would likely cost the Republican Party the next presi-dential race, he said.
Kelly said that one of the main problems today is that 
Republicans are not changing with the technology and different media of communication.
“If we have to go to digital format or make Facebook 
groups, we will,” he said. “We can’t afford to lose the next generation.” 
Rachel Kopec, president of NEW, contacted Kelly 
about speaking at UF because she said she thought members of her organization and other students would be interested in hearing how things have changed in 
politics since the recent presidential election. When she 
asked him, Kelly offered to speak for free.        
“He’s a breath of fresh air for the Hill in Tallahassee,” 
Kopec said.Rep. speaks

Ossip said he’s concerned that if UF requires hand 
scans, student privacy could be jeopardized if hackers 
were able to access students’ biometric data. He said 
UF could save money by not installing the hand scan-
ners and the turnstiles they need to operate.
Bowles said UF has already purchased three hand 
scanners at a cost of $2,200 each but has not yet decided if they will be installed.
If they are, he said they will be optional, regardless 
of the outcome of the initiative.
He said UF still plans to install turnstiles when UF’s 
budget situation improves, with three planned for the Student Recreation and Fitness Center at a total cost of $50,000. 
Four turnstiles are planned for the Southwest Rec-
reation Center as part of its upcoming $16.3 million expansion. He said he didn’t know how much those turnstiles would cost. 
He said in addition to allowing students to enter 
gyms without their Gator 1 Cards, the scanners would 
divert some student traffic and allow employees to 
take a closer looks at IDs, for those who choose not to 
scan their hands, to make sure only students are using 
the facilities.

Budget cuts at UF? Not if Gov. Charlie Crist’s budget 
passes the state Legislature.
UF’s Chief Financial Officer Matt Fajack wrote in an e-
mail that UF’s budget would remain about the same size 
next year if Crist’s budget becomes a reality.
The governor released his $66.5 billion budget pro-
posal Friday.
It includes a budget of about $3.6 billion for the state’s 
11 universities, which is about $270 million more than the 
current year’s budget.Crist’s budget, which is only a recommendation, 
counts on $4.7 billion coming to the state next year from the economic stimulus package signed last week.
UF is currently preparing for a possible budget cut of 
$72 million to $75 million.
“The (state) Legislature has final authority over bud-
get, so a lot may change,” Fajack wrote. “It is a better start than I expected though.”
Janine Sikes, UF spokeswoman, said UF appreciates 
the governor’s support of higher education but said noth-ing is a done deal.
“I don’t know any governor’s budget that has passed 
in its entirety,” Sikes said. “It’s just too soon to tell what’s gonna happen.”Crist’s budget may stop UF cuts

ONLINE I DID NOT KNOW THAT UP NEXTSeconds can mean the difference be-
tween millions of dollars.
That’s how it goes at the annual 
NFL Combine, held this past week in In-dianapolis. I consider the whole ordeal to 
be a little focused on numbers, but those 
digits will make a big impact on where players get drafted.
Here’s how the four Gators fared at the 
Combine:
Jason Watkins: The offensive tackle was a solid player for the Gators, and Tim Tebow is sure thankful to his offensive line this season. But sometimes it’s diffi-cult to calculate how much of that praise should go to which lineman. The 6-foot-6, 310-pounder ran a 5.20 in the 40-yard dash, which is pretty consistent with some of the leaders at offensive tackle. Virginia’s Eugene Monroe, whom many consider the top tackle this year, clocked a 5.25. 
Projection: I’ll ad-
mit I’m far from an 
expert on offensive linemen, especially when it comes to trying to figure 
out where Watkins 
might go in the 
draft. It’s pretty clear he won’t be hearing his name on Day 1, but some projections have him as high as a fourth-round pick. I’m thinking more like sixth.
Louis Murphy: Unfortunately for Mur-phy, UF wide receivers don’t have a great track record in the NFL (see: Chad Jackson, Taylor Jacobs, Dallas Baker, Andrew Stanfill / Alligator Staff

The Gators are still searching for a signature win to hang 
their NCAA tournament resume on.
When they take the floor tonight at 9 against No. 18 LSU 
(23-4, 11-1 Southeastern Conference), UF will get the chance to 
make its case in front of a national television audience.
“Not only to play a team that’s won 11 in a row in the 
league, but to play it on their home court, it’s as good as an opportunity as we could have at this point in the season,” as-
sociate head coach Larry Shyatt said.
The Tigers have rolled through their con-
ference schedule and appear to be the class of the league. Their only slip-up came in a 65-59 loss to Alabama on Jan.11.
“They’re the only real veteran team in the 
conference,” Shyatt said. “They throw out six 
guys who play quality minutes, and five of them are seniors. And the junior is a fifth-year junior.”
The LSU offense is propelled by the inside-outside scoring 
combination of guard Marcus Thornton (21 points per game) and forward Tasmin Mitchell (17 points per game).
UF (21-6, 8-4 SEC) has not beaten a ranked opponent on the 
road since it took care of Kentucky back on Feb. 10, 2007, and the Gators have not won in Baton Rouge, La., since 2003.
“We’re prepared for a war,” Chandler Parsons said.LSU upset UF at home last season 85-73 just days after the 
Tigers fired long-time coach John Brady.
Brady took LSU to the Final Four in 2006.“I think we have a lot of guys who are ready for the chal-
lenge,” Parsons said. “This is what college basketball is about, 
to have your back against the wall and have to go to the No. 1 
team in the conference.”
The Gators have struggled in big games on the road this 
season. They were dismantled by Tennessee and failed to close Gators ‘prepared for war’ against No. 18 LSU tonight

Coming off a sweep of a top-25 team 
and with a weekend matchup with pe-
rennial powerhouse Miami looming, 
UF cannot overlook its weekday games 
sandwiched in between.
The No. 24 Gators (3-0) start a two-
game series with Eastern Michigan to-
night at 6:30 at McKethan Stadium.
Although the Eagles are coming off 
a losing season, they are not a team the 
now-ranked Gators can look past. East-ern Michigan proved that last year by 
making the NCAA Tournament after 
claiming the automatic bid awarded to the winner of the Mid-American Confer-ence.
UF showed it was a team to be reck-
oned with this season with its first sweep of a ranked opponent in its opening weekend since it swept Miami in 1999, but there are still questions hanging over the Gators.
After weeks of speculation, UF coach 
Kevin O’Sullivan an-nounced the starting pitchers for the week-
day games — two more 
freshmen.
Justin Poovey, who 
received a medical redshirt last year after 
having Tommy John 
surgery on his right arm in fall 2007, will be on the mound tonight, and Anthony DeSclafani will start Wednesday’s game. 
With their starts, the Gators’ rotation will 
consist of four freshmen — Alex Pan-teliodis and Nick Maronde are the other Young arms to be tested

UF CLUBS AND INTRAMURALS
By STEPHANIE SLADE
Alligator Contributing Writer
Six weeks after UF quarterback 
Tim Tebow announced his intent 
to lead his team to a third national championship in four years, a differ-ent group of Gators athletes quietly 
beat him to it.
UF’s handball team successfully 
defended its Division II title with a 
score of 1,359 points Sunday at the U.S. Handball Association’s Na-tional Collegiates in Minneapolis, becoming the only school ever to win the competition in back-to-back years. No other program has won 
the title more than once.
“Obviously not on the same scale 
as the bigger sports, but I think it’s 
kind of neat that this is an era of Gator sports,” coach Zach Arem said. “Our team has won three na-
tional titles right along (football and 
basketball), in the same years.”
A co-ed team of 15 athletes — 
nine women and six men — com-peted in the five-day tournament.
Handball is a sport similar to 
racquetball, except players use their hands instead of rackets.
The UF handball program also 
won the Division II title in 2006 and is only in its fifth year of existence.
Senior Matt Rossheim, who 
coaches and competes for UF, is one of only three members of the team to be a part of all three championships. Rossheim said 11 of the athletes who traveled to Minnesota are new to the team this year.
“It’s interesting how it works,” 
Arem said. “A lot of these schools are recruiting players that have been playing since childhood, pre-school. … Every single person that 
has come through our program — 
which is about 70 — they’ve never played handball before in their lives. I think that really says a lot about our program.”
One recent addition is senior Lau-
ren Wadsworth, who led the effort on the women’s side.  She defeated Sinead Earley and Sinead Carroll, 
both of Dublin City (Ireland) Uni-
versity, on her way to clinching the Contender bracket title.
“I’m still kind of surprised, like, 
‘Wow, that actually did happen,’” Wadsworth said.
The club’s vice president, Lind-
sey Wuenker, lost in the “C” brack-et’s final round to Utah State’s Krista 
Allen, who knocked off UF’s Brandy 
Jaworski in the same bracket one round earlier.
Wuenker also brought home one of the tournament’s sportsmanship 
awards, UF’s first.
“She was one point from being 
knocked out of the tournament for 
the rest of her life — because she’s a senior — and she came back and won (three straight matches),” Arem said. “It was a great story.”
Wuenker had the opportunity to 
win her bracket in a forfeit by her opponent, who was unable to com-pete on Sunday because of a reli-
gious prohibition. Instead, Wuenker 
agreed to play Saturday night and lost the round.
Emily Korszen earned UF its sec-
ond semifinal finish in the women’s Challenger bracket, downing Cali-fornia’s Kathleen Heng and Texas’ Melissa Abrantes before falling to Kelly Parmet of Southwestern.
Rossheim led the men with 
122 points, while Nathan Krowitz played his way to quarterfinal hon-ors in the Intermediate bracket.
Philip Coover made it to the In-
termediate bracket’s round of 16 before losing. The UF women’s 738 points were the most they have to-taled in program history.
“This is the hardest-working 
team that I have ever been a part of,” Arem said. “It’s an individual sport, but it was such a total team effort.”
Club handball claims third championship in four years
Andre and Reche Caldwell). The St. Petersburg native has 
felt the burden but believes he will be different. He had to miss the Senior Bowl due to a minor knee injury, but his 4.43 in the 40 was good for ninth among wideouts.
He told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel that he and Percy Har-vin are going to end UF’s streak of poor NFL receivers.
“There hadn’t been two national championships in three 
years at Florida yet either,” Murphy said.
Projection: Definitely another second-day prospect, and 
Murphy is going to be hurt by the UF stigma as well as the fact that he never had to do too much with the Gators. He had some big catches but also some crucial drops. Some say he’ll creep into the second round, but he’ll drop to the fourth.
Cornelius Ingram: Coming off his ACL injury, Ingram had a lot to prove at the Combine and had nixed any return in the BCS National Championship Game to ensure a good showing.  The 6-foot-4, 245-pounder did pretty well, clock-ing the fourth-best 40 time among tight ends (4.68). 
“There are a lot of pretty good tight ends in this draft, and 
they have a full season worth of film,” Ingram told the Florida Times-Union. “I have a lot to prove.”
Projection: The simple eye test tells me that Ingram — if 
healthy — is going to be a special football player just based on 
his freakish athletic ability. He may be a bit undersized at the tight end position, and injury concerns will likely keep him from going on Day 1. I consider him a great third-round pick and a steal at any later round.
Percy Harvin: The dynamic playmaker had the most to gain this past weekend at the Combine. The First Team All-American ran an official 4.41 in the 40, which ranked him tied for sixth among wideouts. Most importantly, however, he beat the time of Missouri’s Jeremy Maclin (4.43).
Projection: Teams have to decide where they want to use 
Harvin, but there’s no doubt about the playmaking poten-
tial he has. A big key will be how teams view his durability. 
Teams are obviously taking this seriously, as Harvin report-edly took much longer than expected during medical tests and scrapped one media opportunity. It looks like Michael Crabtree will be the first receiver taken despite his injury, but Harvin could edge Maclin and be the next one off the board. Look for him to be a mid-to-high first-round pick.
The next big chance for them to impress NFL coaches and 
scouts will be March 18 at UF’s Pro Day in The Swamp
the deal against Kentucky.
“We’ve been a heartbeat away,” Shyatt said. 
“We’ve won a little more at home, but I would say 
most people do.”
With the memory of last year’s late-season col-
lapse in their minds, questions still remain about whether this UF 
team has what it takes to close out the final four games of the year.
The Gators would likely need 
to win two of their last four to go to the NCAA Tournament. 
Parsons said he doesn’t believe 
last year’s shortfall will lead to a 
repeat performance this season.
“We were pretty much in the same situation, but 
we’ve got a totally different team,” Parsons said. 
“We’ve been through it all. We’ve been kicked out of the facility. We’ve had our gear taken from us. We know how it feels to not get to where we want to get to. We have a bunch of hardened guys who will do what it takes to not go down that road again.”Parsons confidenttwo — and senior Patrick Keating.
O’Sullivan wants to get both of them 
experience and see how they perform un-
der the lights.
“Poovey hasn’t gotten out there yet, 
and he needs to get out there,” O’Sullivan 
said. “DeSclafani is obviously really tal-
ented, and we need to get him out there 
and get some innings. It’s good to get a lot of these guys out there.”
Panteliodis and Maronde set the stan-
dard for freshmen hurlers this weekend 
with strong outings. Their performances 
will give Poovey and DeSclafani exam-ples of how to pitch well in their first col-lege starts. 
DeSclafani already made his college 
debut, pitching an inning of relief Satur-day, so some of those jitters that bugged Panteliodis and Maronde in their first ca-reer innings might not bother him.
Either way, they will have the benefit 
of having a confident team playing the field behind them and at the plate.
No player has more poise heading into 
the season than shortstop Mike Mooney. In addition to hitting a walk-off single 
on Sunday, he recovered from a throwing error on the first play of Friday’s game to make play after play, giving him six put-outs on Sunday and showing why his de-
fense was so hyped in the preseason.
“We knew we were going to be tested 
and see how we stacked, see how we play 
once we got into a game, and this builds 
loads of confidence coming off sweeping 
a ranked team like that,” 
Mooney said.
O’Sullivan will be quick 
to remind his team that 
they still can’t reminisce 
about this past weekend, 
especially with another series against a tournament team coming up.
That doesn’t mean he doesn’t know 
what a sweep against a ranked team does for UF’s tournament resume.
“It was just three games of 56,” 
O’Sullivan said. “Our whole thing (Sun-
day) morning was if you want to put 
yourself in position to host regionals and super regionals, which gives you the best opportunity to get to Omaha, then you 
got to do some things like (sweep Louis-
ville).”Panteliodis, Maronde set standard for upcoming freshman starters

“Obviously not on the same 
scale as the bigger sports, 
but I think it’s kind of neat 
that this is an era of Gator 
sports.”
