� GROUP FACES FIVE-
YEAR SUSPENSION.

UF sorority Sigma Lambda 
Gamma, an 18-member Latina-
based group, has been shut down for five years by its na-tional organization for hazing 
activities that included push-
ups and restrictions on Face-book usage.
UF’s Greek Judicial Board, 
now the Greek Conduct Com-mittee, also recommended a 
one one-year suspension fol-
lowed by one year of probation in February. Paige Crandall, UF’s interim dean of students, approved the recommenda-tions on March 20.
UF’s sanctions are basically 
irrelevant, though, said Chris Loschiavo, director of UF’s Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution.Under the national orga-
nization’s decision, which re-voked the chapter’s charter, it will be at least 2014 before a new chapter of the sorority can be formed on the UF campus, Loschiavio said.
According to UF records, 
the hazing occurred last fall 
as part of a program for new 
members.
The recruits had to follow a 
list of 37 rules, a report from the judicial board stated, “which include no make-up, fast food, Facebook, no shortcuts such as elevators or cutting through grass, and must have permis-
sion to go someplace other than 
where they are supposed to Sorority faces

UF President Bernie Machen stressed the 
importance of raising the academic standards 
for the Bright Futures Scholarship and imple-
menting new state taxes for education during a town hall forum hosted by IRHA, the  Inter-Residence Hall Association, for on-campus residents Thursday night.
Machen said increasing taxes would help 
the state tremendously, citing the $1 cigarette tax being disputed in Tallahassee that would raise more than $800 million in a year.
“We’re not over-taxed,” Machen said to 
the group of about 30 people who gathered for the question-and-answer session inside Yulee Hall’s lounge. “We’re under-resourced.”Skeet Surrency, a UF organic and sustain-
able crop production senior, asked Machen if he would sign a petition asking for a one-cent increase to Florida’s sales tax to help fund education.
“I’ll sign it” Machen said. Surrency said Machen will likely sign the 
petition publicly next week.    
During the forum Machen defended tu-ition increases and said, if it were up to him, he’d make anyone pay tuition who could af-ford it. 
“Bright Futures does not allow true excel-
lence to be awarded,” said Machen, adding 
he believes the scholarship is heavily flawed 
and should take into account need-based ON CAMPUSMachen supports raising standards for scholarships

It’s not often that meetings de-
signed to address college budget 
cuts have audience members feeling more like they’re in the middle of a 
teen musical.“We have a really different ap-
proach to budget cuts here,” joked 
Dr. Jackson Sasser, the president of Santa Fe College, after students from the Fine Arts Department per-formed a rendition of “We’re All in This Together” from the movie “High School Musical” on Thursday afternoon.
A standing ovation was received 
for the high-energy routine. It was per-formed by about 60 students in front of a 
packed gymnasium.
“I wanted you to see that because, as bad as the budget is, we have joy 
here,” Sasser said. “And we’re not 
going to let what we’re facing take that joy away.” 
Although the Florida Legislature 
is still in session and tuition costs for the coming year have not been final-ized, he estimates the college will be out about $500,000, even with a con-
servative budget.
In order to compensate for the 
money the school needs, Sasser 
urged faculty and staff to help the college by reducing health insur-

Critics assail Afghan marital rape law
KABUL (AP) — A new Afghan law makes it 
legal for men to rape their wives, human rights 
groups and some Afghan lawmakers said Thurs-day, accusing President Hamid Karzai of signing the legislation to bolster his re-election prospects. Critics worry the legislation undermines hard-won rights for women enacted after the fall of the Tali-ban’s strict Islamist regime.
The law — which some lawmakers say was 
never debated in parliament — is intended to regu-late family life inside Afghanistan’s Shiite com-munity, which makes up about 20 percent of this country of 30 million people. The law does not af-fect Afghan Sunnis. One of the most controversial articles stipulates the wife “is bound to preen for her husband as and when he desires.”
“As long as the husband is not traveling, he has 
the right to have sexual intercourse with his wife every fourth night,” Article 132 of the law says. “Unless the wife is ill or has any kind of illness that intercourse could aggravate, the wife is bound to give a positive response to the sexual desires of her husband.”Santa F e

every consequence 
that we were given.”

It wasn’t the smell of feces and 
urine from the overflowing toilets 
or the 95-degree ovenlike surround-ings that bothered Paul Harris the most, but the power of fear. 
Harris, author of “Diary From 
The Dome: Reflections on Fear and Privilege During Katrina,” discussed his experience of being trapped in the New Orleans Superdome dur-ing Hurricane Katrina to an audi-ence of about 70 at Smathers Library Thursday. Harris, now a retired staff mem-
ber from the University of California at San Diego, arrived at New Or-leans with tourism in mind. Instead, he was forced to seek refuge in the Superdome with about 20,000 other evacuees three days after his arrival, when Katrina hit. 
He said although the refugees, 
most of them families, received 
good meals and protection from the 
storm, they were put in the most un-sanitary conditions he’d ever seen.
He said people grew frustrated 
and angry after a few days without air conditioning. Some began break-ing into ice machines.
“We kept hearing, ‘The buses are 
coming! The buses are coming!’” Harris said, adding that false rumors about attacks and rapes also quickly 
spread among the crowd. ”It was 
like a lie, after lie, after lie,” he said.
Harris remembers the first time 
people felt collectively scared was when they heard a radio announcer say the waters were rising.
“Fear controlled our thoughts,” 
he said. 
If there was one thing he learned 
from his experience, it would be the power of fear in controlling our lives, he said.
Harris said he was depressed by 
the lack of progress when he visited 
New Orleans again not long ago. He 
encouraged everyone to urge local legislators to spend more money in New Orleans and to never for-get what happened. Harris donates money to Common Ground Relief and other organizations that helped build houses and alleviate bad living conditions for hurricane victims.
Sharon Austin, UF associate pro-
fessor of political science, brought about 60 students from her African-American politics class to the event. She said they were discussing New Orleans in class and thought it would be great to bring them.
Alicia Antone, director of devel-
opment for UF Libraries and a co-ordinator for the event, said Harris asked if he could come to UF and talk about his experience, despite not being paid.
� THE OFFICE HOPES TO COLLECT 
7,500 CELL PHONES BY JULY 4.
BY CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Contributing Writer
For once, the Alachua County Tax Collec-
tor’s Office does not want money.
It wants old cell phones.
The office has already collected 6,876 cell 
phones from county residents for Cell Phones 
for Soldiers, a national organization that uses 
money raised from recycled cell phones to buy calling cards for American troops sta-tioned overseas. 
The office hopes to collect 7,500 cell phones 
by July 4. 
Stephanie Kelley, the director of human re-
sources at the Alachua County Tax Collector’s Office, heard about the program on National 
Public Radio.
After discovering that Gainesville had no 
collection centers for recycled cell phones,  
Kelley asked Alachua County Tax Collector Von Fraser if the county’s three tax collector offices could be used as collection locations. The collection program kicked off in February 2006. 
The phones are shipped to a recycling 
company, and the company sends the money from recycling the phones to Cell Phones for Soldiers.
The program then uses the money to buy 
calling cards. Each recycled phone provides an hour of talk time, according to the pro-
gram’s Web site.
Kelley said she be-
lieves that anybody who goes overseas should be able to call home.
Roxanne Watkins, the director of the 
downtown branch of the Alachua County Tax Collector’s Office, has a son serving as a sergeant in the Marines in Iraq.
Watkins helps get the calling cards from 
Cell Phones for Soldiers and, alongside the Military Support Group of Alachua County, places them in care packages for troops.
The support group is in charge of mailing 
the care packages to the soldiers.
Watkins said the program is a community 
effort, which includes Alachua County and 
surrounding counties like Clay County.
She said returning troops come to the Mili-
tary Support Group’s meetings and comment 
about the care packages and phone cards. The troops have generally expressed appreciation for the service.
“We get a lot of positive feedback,” she 
said. “That’s why we continue to do it be-cause we want to continue to touch the lives 
of all of the troops.”ON CAMPUSLibrary hosts author to speak on Katrina disaster

A Gainesville man was arrested early Wednesday morning in 
connection with hitting an officer and swallowing crack cocaine.
At about 2 a.m., Gainesville Police Officer  John Pandak stopped 
a man near 1100 N.W. Fifth Ave. while he was walking, the GPD 
arrest report stated. 
Because Pandak recognized the man, Eugene Knight, 19, as a 
narcotics offender, he asked Knight to open his mouth to check 
for cocaine.                                                       
When Pandak grabbed Knight’s arm to get a 
better look, Knight swung his other arm at Pan-dak, hitting him in the head.
According to the report, the defendant was 
“placed” on the ground, where he continued to thrash. Pandak at-tempted to remove the cocaine from Knight’s mouth while hand-
cuffing him. Then Knight swallowed the cocaine to destroy the 
evidence, the report stated.
Knight told the officer he was “smoking dirty,” lacing a ciga-
rette or marijuana cigarette with cocaine, the report stated.
Knight was charged with resisting an officer with violence, 
tampering with evidence and possessing a controlled substance.

Persistence is the word a UF law 
professor lives by, and he said it 
earned him a seat on a Florida ap-pointing commission.
Jon Mills was notified in March 
by Sen. Bill Nelson’s office about his seat on the Florida Judicial 
Nominating Commission.               
 “I think it’s an important as-
signment to review federal judge appointments since they play an 
important part in our lives,” Mills said.
The Commission consists of 56 
members that review and give rec-ommendations of candidates who 
will serve as the U.S. District Court 
judges, U.S. marshals and U.S. at-torneys in Florida, Mills said. 
The Commission’s duties also 
include providing the governor with possible appointments to state 
appellate courts.
Mills will join 12 other UF law graduates on the Commission. He 
is also a UF alumnus,  dean emeri-tus, former Florida Speaker of the 
House and founding director of the 
Center for Governmental Respon-sibility.
“I look forward to working with 
other members in the committee, along with having the chance to 
help make decisions by our sena-
tors and President Obama,” Mills said.
Growing up, Mills found in-
spiration in historical figures like Winston Churchill and Abraham 
Lincoln because they had to make 
tough decisions during difficult times.“I think they are the type of 
people that young people can learn a lot from in their lives,” Mills said. 
“They have an important charac-
teristic, which is perseverance.”
Despite his achievements, Mills 
has encountered challenges in reaching his goals in life, but he de-scribes the challenges as defining 
moments that inspired his career.
Besides contributing to the law 
community, Mills currently de-votes his time to helping his daugh-
ters, Marguerite, 14, and Elizabeth, 9, play volleyball. 
He was never a volleyball play-
er himself, but he spends about 10 hours a week helping the girls with 
their game. 
“I am a volleyball dad,” Mills 
said.
Although unsure where future 
plans will take him, Mills said they 
will definitely involve working in 
public service.                      
“Any time you get the chance to 
work in public service, it should be savored and enjoyed,” he said.STATE

Today’s question: Would you call a phone-sex hotline?
221 TOTAL VOTES80% YES20% NOThursday’s question: Would you pass a drug test?Crist shouldn’t cut Everglades funding
Column
When one thinks of the Everglades they tend to 
conjure imagery of nothing but giant swamps — unappealing and, honestly, a bit of a waste 
of space. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. Among other things, the Everglades are a designated 
World Heritage Site, a haven for rare and endangered species and one of the few places in the world where one can see the stunning ghost lily.
Right, enough with the environmentalist pitch. Well I 
only urge all of you to go out and see the Everglades be-cause the way things are looking, the opportunity may be gone some day.
Apparently, the economic crisis, which has been so 
much fun for all of us — which has lead to such fantastic pop-culture memes as Rock Santelli’s Wall Street popu-lism howl and Jon Stewart giving a healthy dose of fear, trembling and sickness unto Jim Cramer — has claimed another victim. 
On Wednesday, Gov. Charlie Crist announced that, 
due to budgetary problems, Florida’s long-overdue plan to buy 182,000 acres of Everglades land from the United States Sugar Corporation will be significantly scaled back. Instead, less than 73,000 acres will be purchased — less than half of the specified amount in the original propos-al.
Don’t think I don’t see where the state is coming from. 
With people losing their jobs, we have to save money where we can. It’s just something of a shame.
This is actually the second time the plan has been scaled 
back, and I’m not optimistic that there won’t be more.
Things are looking bleak for the Everglades. Already 
under siege from industrial developers and environ-
mental problems, the land has lately fallen victim to a series of invasive species — like the Burmese python, the outbreak 
of which was parodied on “The 
Daily Show” — and now it seems 
the cavalry has been delayed. “If 
we don’t fight to create a future,” 
writes Neil Gaiman in his charm-
ing story ‘Strange Little Girls,’ “there will not be a future for any 
of us.”
This announcement, ironically coming just on the heels 
of Earth Hour, has set me to thinking about this place that 
I’ve always known about but so seldom had any interest 
in. It makes me wonder, as well, what will be next. Maybe 
the upkeep of Yellowstone will get too expensive. Maybe filling up the Grand Canyon will be the government’s 
next shovel-ready project. 
I feel the urge to get out and see these places while I 
have the chance. Ah, if only it weren’t for finals.
There’s a fantastic exhibit at the Florida Museum of 
Natural History that you should check out if you want 
to get a feel for the real beauty and majesty that the Ever-
glades hold. 
It consists of a series of large black and white photos 
by a talented photog named Clyde Butcher, and a series of color prints by his protégé, Jeff Ripple. Both men are ex-
tremely talented and capture the serenity of the unspoiled 
parts of this increasingly spoiled landscape. There’s an-
other section where you can learn about the things threat-
ening the Everglades and how to help.
I know it sounds educational, but check it out. It might 
be the closest to the real thing you get.
Eric Chianese is an English junior. His column appears 
weekly.With final exams and project deadlines just around the 
bend, the Department of Darts & Laurels officially de-clares this weekend the one last hurrah of the spring 
semester.
So get your drinking boots on and saddle up for two glorious 
evenings of debauchery while imagining that we call West Hol-lywood home rather than North Central Florida. Whether your latest flavor of the month tastes like the grittiness of Gator City or the sophistication of Sharab, just keep in mind the oh-so sexy demands of academia will soon be whispering your name.
Before we head to the Oaks Mall to score the freshest in Af-
fliction gear, we proudly present you this week’s make-sure-to-keep-your-BAC-below-your-GPA-while-raging edition of...
Darts & Laurels
Word out of London reveals controversy beyond Michelle 
Obama’s horrifying decision to touch Queen Elizabeth on her back. For breaking into a branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland and smashing windows, the Department of Darts & Laurels hurls a you-guys-lost-any-hint-of-credibility-the-second-you-
started-destroying-property DART at the G-20 summit protest-
ers. We completely support the right to voice his or her opinion 
in a public forum, but please don’t go and take such freedoms for granted by channeling your inner anarchist.
For one New Jersey man unable to quench his thirst for 
Hennessy cognac, the second best option was letting out a cry. The Department of Darts & Laurels presents a we-can-safely-assume-you-listen-to-Yanni-while-taking-bubble-baths LAU-
REL to Edwin Calix for showing his sensitive side after being 
arrested for attempting to rob a liquor store. There’s nothing wrong with a grown man shedding a few tears. Hell, we know a certain 22-year-old graduate student who’s returned to work misty-eyed after watching an episode of “Gossip Girl.”
Giving an entirely new meaning to the question “so what 
kind of car do you drive?” one man’s utterly unique mode of transportation has left him facing the wrath of the long arm of the law. For crashing his motorized bar stool after consuming 15 beers, the Department of Darts & Laurels chucks a you’re-
an-idiot-but-when-the-trial-is-over-can-you-build-us-one? 
DART at Kile Wygle. It doesn’t matter if you’re driving a car 
or a glorified lawn mower – driving drunk remains completely inexcusable.
A casual conversation involving “Olympics” typically con-
jures imagery of world-class athletes — not exactly Kevin from “The Office.” The Department of Darts & Laurels extends a what-a-truly-novel-approach-to-lighten-a-miserable-situation LAUREL to the creators of the Unemployment Olympics for 
providing an event in which jobless New Yorkers could blow off some steam with like-minded folks. With games like “pin the tail on the boss” and “race toward unemployment,” we can safely assume the event was a roaring success for all involved.
The latest in the rat saga currently occupying the minds of UF 
students everywhere reveals a turn for the worst. For spreading fear throughout the newsroom and making a meal out of our beloved keyboards, the Department of Darts & Laurels tosses a the-only-cool-rat-was-Splinter-from-Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-
Turtles DART at the Alligator rats. We can only imagine com-
ing back to work on Sunday to find the entire building in sham-
bles after the rats learned word of our unwillingness to coexist. 
We can’t verify, but we’re pretty sure there were construc-
tion worker rats (on strike nonetheless!) in an episode of “Doug” that were pretty sweet too.
Health nuts argue that organic cereal is a great alternative 
to sugary offerings like Captain Crunch — but when was the last time the ol’ Captain made phone sex happen? The Depart-ment of Darts & Laurels awards an excuse-us-while-we-hit-up-Mother-Earth-to-buy-a-box LAUREL to Peace Cereal for put-
ting children everywhere on the fast track to puberty thanks to an oversight printed on their boxes. Nothing like one incorrect digit in the company’s 800 number resulting in a sexy voice in-quiring if the caller loves sex.
You can safely assume what we’ll be eating for breakfast 
from now on. That’s all for this week. Enjoy the weather.

Legalized pot not so problematic
Before we legalize pot, if we were op-
posed to it, we should definitely write an 
article with a plethora of construed facts that have nothing to do with marijuana at all. 
I would not equate the legalization of the 
least toxic psychoactive substance known to man with providing unstable countries with the means to destroy the free world. In addition, letting everyone carry guns also has nothing to do with the issue. 
Anyone in the U.S. that wants to carry a 
gun legally can get a permit to do so. All of the criminals will carry their guns regard-
less of the laws in order to carjack, rob, 
murder and rape the law-abiding citizens. This is why the good citizens have the right to bear arms and obtain a concealed weap-ons permit. 
Back to the real issue here, marijuana. If we legalized pot, people’s interest in 
smoking the substance would probably decline. Only a minor percentage of high 
school students in Amsterdam, where 
weed is essentially legal, have reported try-ing it as opposed to the 20 percent or more of American high students.
I’m not saying everyone should smoke 
pot. The fact is, some people, like Gary Colon’s father, cannot handle smoking pot in addition to their other responsibili-ties. Then again, some people can’t handle 
drinking alcohol, but that’s perfectly legal. 
As for marijuana leading to other drugs for his father, maybe he should blame alcohol. 
He, like the majority of Americans, prob-
ably had his first intoxicated experience with alcohol, not weed. Marijuana being le-gal would not increase its use, cause harm or make it easier to obtain for adolescents. Ask any kid under 21 what’s easier to get, 
weed or liquor, and they’ll say weed. Drug dealers don’t check IDs. 
Perhaps Colon should talk to those who 
have depression, cancer, AIDS and other debilitating diseases who use it for medi-cine, or those who prefer its relaxing feel-ings over drunken nights of fighting, vom-iting, sex with strangers, memory loss and, of course, epic hangovers.

Letter fails to form factual argument
Wednesday’s letter to the editor stated 
that marijuana has no benefit to society whatsoever and is extremely dangerous to the public. 
The author made the massive jump lik-
ening legalizaton of marijuana to allowing everyone to carry guns and letting North Korea and Iran to stockpile nuclear weap-ons. How does anyone honestly think le-galizing or decriminalizing marijuana will lead to a complete breakdown of the policy of the United Nations? Also, if you think kids aren’t already getting their hands on pot as they please, you are just naive.
Moreover, marijuana is used medicinal-
ly and has clearly been shown in lab tests to significantly help treat and prevent such ill-nesses as glaucoma and even Alzheimer’s Disease. But no, marijuana has no posi-tive uses. I am not saying I am either for or against legalization or decriminalization of marijuana, but rather asking that people please use rational and factual support for 
their opinions and not absurd leaps in logic 
and blatant lies. 
Maybe think for yourself and do some re-
search instead of just adopting the “Above The Influence” commercials as your per-sonal belief system.

3AGSG should give group adequate funding
Amongst all of the budget woes here at 
UF, it was inevitable that some student or-ganizations would feel the impact. 
Unfortunately, SG politics threaten the 
fate of an important, popular and visible 
group  Gators for a Sustainable Campus.
When I walked into my first GSC meet-
ing early in my freshman year, I was thrilled 
to find a passionate, ambitious group of young students who were dedicated to making a difference in the university and beyond.
I quickly learned of GSC’s short but ad-
mirable history — it was the brainchild of 
a group of students who took a class on 
sustainability together. The drive of the founders is evident in today’s membership, with student projects ranging from pass-ing a green fee at the university level (it is currently in state legislature), the planning of an Earth Day extravaganza, outreach to local elementary schools and social events like camping.
It is of the utmost importance that GSC 
continues to receive adequate funding and remains a separate entity from the new sus-tainability agency being created in SG. As a student group we allow an outlet for any member of the student body to bring forth ideas and projects to get support, volun-teers and guidance.

Column’s satire belittles poverty issues
Although I know that Johnathan Lott’s 
column in Thursday’s Alligator comparing grades to taxes was written in jest, I have to say that I take serious issue with his meta-phor. 
Under even the briefest of examinations, 
it is obvious that this comparison is com-pletely irrelevant to the real world where there are innumerable issues that force peo-ple into poverty.
Furthermore, the fact that the struggles 
low-income families face every day as they try to make ends meet is compared to such a minor issue as grades is belittling and de-meaning.
Weak metaphors aside, the real question 
that we, Lott in particular, have to ask our-selves is whether the fact that some people possess a higher level of knowledge and skills than others justifies the enormous disparities in wealth in America.
If someone works hard their whole 
life and becomes a billionaire, does that mean that they are entitled to keep most 
of it since they worked hard? Does it mean 
that they are therefore entitled to own five houses and their own private island since they worked hard?  
If, on the other hand, I was not able to 
get an adequate education and I am forced to work a minimum wage job, does that mean that I should be so poor that my chil-dren are unable to get an adequate educa-
tion even though I worked hard? 
Does it mean that they shouldn’t have 
access to adequate health care when they 
get sick even though I worked hard?
Does it mean that they should be forced 
to skip meals or go to bed hungry every night even though I worked hard?
Does it mean that my family and I should 
be forced to live in substandard housing 
even though I worked hard?  
A progressive tax system is not designed 
to make everyone equal. It is meant to en-
sure that all Americans, regardless of their circumstances, have access to decent hous-ing, food, education and health care.

Dr. Jamillah Karim speaks about gender equality in Islam at the Touchdown 
Terrace at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium on Thursday night.By CHELSEA KEENAN
Alligator Writer
Right after sunset, 14 students kneeled in the di-
rection of Mecca on the floor of Touchdown Terrace 
at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium Thursday night to take 
part in prayer before Jamillah Karim took the po-dium to speak to a crowd of about 40 people.
Karim, who was brought by Islam on Campus 
and Accent, lectured about a woman’s role in the Islam faith.
Karim became the first Muslim professor of re-
ligion at Spelman College, an all-girls liberal arts school in Atlanta, Ga.
“I believe it has been divinely decided that I give 
the talk I plan to give today,” she said, adding she had originally prepared a different lecture but was 
driven by Allah to speak on something different. 
To help illustrate her main points, she shared 
stories of the different Muslim women who im-pacted her life and shaped her ways of thinking.
She first shared the story of her 
mother, an African-American Muslim 
convert, who Karim said would try to 
wash off the color of skin when she was a child because she was ashamed 
of its shade.
“She told us this to share the psychological im-
pact on racism but also to show how Islam healed 
her,” Karim said. “It broke the shackles in my mind 
to show that black was beautiful.”
Karim also compared the views the America 
media and Muslim women have toward the hijab, the headdress Muslim women wear.
She said while many American publications de-
pict Muslim women in passive poses, Muslim pub-
lications showcase more active women in the faith. 
 After Karim’s 45-minute lecture, students had 
a chance to ask her questions pertaining to current events facing Islamic women, such as certain Islam-ic nations who participate in female circumcision.  
“The reality is that the Koran does not support 
that,” Karim said, adding there is a distinction be-
tween Islamic practice and cultural practices in Is-
lamic nations.  “The reason why the two tend to be confused is that Islam is a religion that is open to 
cultures, so many cultural acts will continue.”

NEW YORK (AP) — Even Ber-
nie Madoff isn’t exempt from the 
real estate slump.
The Florida mansion that pros-
ecutors seized from the Wall Street 
swindler appears to have lost a big 
chunk of its value since Palm Beach County officials assessed its worth last year at $9.3 million.
A new appraisal that federal of-
ficials had done in March pegged the property’s likely market price at $7.45 million.
Prosecutors disclosed in a court 
filing Thursday that Madoff and his wife tentatively agreed to let the government sell off the waterfront Palm Beach home while the courts decide how much of the family’s fortune should be forfeited and distributed to victims of his Ponzi scheme.
The planned seizure was ac-
celerated, however, because of the hefty cost of maintaining the five-bedroom home and legal complica-tions created by a competing claim to Madoff’s assets posed by a law-suit in Connecticut.
Federal marshals seized the 
house Wednesday, along with a vintage, 55-foot yacht called Bull, 
docked in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., 
and a 24-foot motorboat.Madoff

 Her driver would take her no 
further; he felt crossing the sandy 
riverbed that marked the border 
of Chad and Sudan, nations of central Africa, was for the fool-hardy.
But Lydia Polgreen had to 
meet her sources on the other side, members of a rebel group operating out of Sudan with the goal of toppling Chad’s govern-
ment.
As the West African bureau 
chief for the New 
York Times, it was 
Polgreen’s third or 
fourth trip to the area. She was piecing 
together a fractured and complex regional conﬂ  ict and the rebels 
were another shard of the story.                                                      
“One false step and you could easily ﬁ  nd yourself in a world of trouble,” she said to about 50 UF 
professors and students Thurs-
day. Polgreen and her photog-rapher crossed the riverbed on foot to meet their rebel contact, with whom neither shared a lan-
guage.
Wordlessly, they climbed onto 
a truck overﬂ  owing with ma-
chine-gun-toting rebels.
“I sorta felt this little shiver of 
unease and thought ‘I don’t know about this’,” she said. Sudanese 
soldiers quickly caught the reb-els, along with Polgreen and her 
photographer, loaded them onto another truck and took them to the headquarters of a local secu-rity chief. When Polgreen tried to speak with her photographer, a rebel guarding her tapped his gun’s trigger as a way of saying “be quiet.”   “’This is it’ I thought, ‘my luck 
has run out’,” she said.
She has been to mines policed 
by militants in the Congo rain-forest where barehanded work-ers dig out metal for use in cell phones and computers.
But her work isn’t always 
at personal risk. Recently, she wrote about a plague of caterpil-lars which gobbled up the crops of Liberia.
When she ﬁ  nally met the Su-
danese security chief, Polgreen was surprised.
Instead of throwing her into 
jail, not an uncommon fate for journalists in Sudan, he discussed local politics with her at length in broken English.
Afterwards, he gave Polgreen 
a large meal and had soldiers drop her back at the border.                                                                    Often, when a journalist ﬁ  nds the answer that they’ve been search-
ing for at the “ends of the earth,” 
it’s not what they thought it was going to be, she said.
“That’s what happened to me 
on the border of Chad and Su-
dan,” she said.
Polgreen’s talk was sponsored 
by the Center for African Studies. 
No fee was set but Leonardo Vil-lalón, the director of the center, expects that she will be paid a 
few hundred dollars to help with 
travel expenses, he said.

paring for her new assignment in India.   Foreign correspondent details time spent in Africa

When he stands at the loca-
tion where Gainesville Police 
Lt. Corey Dahlem was hit by a 
drunken driver two years ago to-
day, Capt. Bart Knowles doesn’t think about Dahlem’s death.
Instead, Knowles said he 
thinks about campfires, playing the guitar and occasionally hav-ing a beer or two with his old 
neighbor and co-
worker.
“When I 
come here, that’s what I reflect 
upon, not what 
has happened here,” Knowles said. “I think 
about the good things, not the police stuff.”
Officers held candles close to 
their hearts to protect the flame from going out as about 150 
family members, friends and co-
workers gathered to remember Dahlem at a candlelight vigil Thursday night.
The vigil took place at 1700 W. 
University Ave., where the GPD veteran of 22 years was struck by a speeding pickup truck on April 3, 2007. Following the UF men’s 
basketball team’s win in the na-tional championship game, Dahl-
em was crossing the street at 2:10 a.m. when the driver of the truck illegally turned and ignored po-
lice signaling him to stop.
“It’s not much of a celebration 
when we lose one of our own,” 
Capt. Ed Book said of the basket-
ball team’s win. “If we have one 
tragedy, the whole event is a fail-ure.”
However, good things do 
come out of every bad situation, Book said.
“Corey would appreciate the 
fact that we are safer and more 
efficient,” he said.
GPD Chief Norman Botsford 
said Dahlem was like a father to 
the younger officers in the de-
partment.
“Everyone that worked there 
liked him,” he said. “Which is 
not always true of authority fig-ures.”
Since Dahlem’s death, Bots-
ford said the department has worked on DUI education and prevention.
“More people are killed by 
drivers who are under the influ-ence than any other criminal act,” he said.
Lt. Keith Kameg said the vigil 
highlights how senseless Dahl-em’s death was.
“This is not only a testament to 
a good police officer, but a well-liked man in the office,” Kameg said, adding that he used to live across the street from Dahlem.
On the morning of a UF versus 
Florida State University game, Kameg said he walked out of his front door to find that Dahlem, an avid FSU fan and prankster, shrink-wrapped his entire house and car in garnet and gold.
At the vigil, Lt. Scott Meffen 
expressed his love for Dahlem to his wife Salley and their two chil-dren Brandon and Katie.
“Not a day goes by that I don’t 
drive by and look at the memo-
rial,” he said speaking slowly. 
“He’s right here in my heart.”10, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, APRIL 3, 2009

At 11 p.m., registered nurse Alexis 
Lynch gulps down a Dr Pepper and some 
animal crackers to give her energy for the 16th hour of her shift on the pediatrics floor at Shands at UF. She agreed to work 
late even despite being scheduled to leave 
at 7 p.m. because there were not enough nurses to cover the shift.
The demand for nurses far outweighs 
the supply on a national level, as well as 
right here in Gainesville.  
“We are definitely understaffed,” Lynch 
said. “I am called in almost every day that 
I am off because they need me to work.”
Ruth Thompson, a charge nurse at 
Shands at UF, blames the nursing shortage on a lack of resources and professors, as well as the stress attributed to the job.
“The hospital says that it can’t afford to pay nurses overtime,” she said. “And 
there just aren’t enough professors in the 
college programs to teach students.”
Practicing nurses are paid much more 
than professors in the industry, Thompson 
said. 
“I would love to teach, but I just can’t 
take the pay cut,” she said.  
Tracy Wright, director of public rela-
tions and communications for the College of Nursing at UF, said the budget cuts at 
UF may be threatening the undergraduate nursing program. 
“We do not know the exact impact of 
the cuts yet, but one proposal calls for eliminating the undergraduate program altogether,” she said.
It is more likely that the college as a 
whole will have to scale back, rather than 
cutting entire programs, Wright said.  
“The nursing program is very competi-
tive,” she said. “We have limited resources and clinical spaces.”
Florida law limits the number of stu-
dents allowed to participate in clinicals, 
which are direct observations of patients, Wright said.
Job burnout also appears to be a factor 
in the nursing shortage.
The 12-hour-plus shifts were taxing on 
Rita Toro, who said working in the neona-
tal intensive care unit was extremely de-
manding.
“A lot of nurses are leaving the field to 
go to less stressful jobs at clinics, schools 
and nursing homes,” Toro said.Toro retired from her job as a nurse at 
North Florida Regional Medical Center 
more than 10 years ago to open the bou-tique Especially for Women located on Newberry Road.
“I left nursing to open a business for 
women diagnosed with breast cancer,” Toro said. “It was more flexible for raising children, and I wanted to start a family.”
There were nurses who would go three 
days without seeing their own children, Toro said.
“I can’t imagine what it would be like 
to have this job and take care of a family,” 
Lynch said.
Despite the stress and strain of working 
on holidays, Lynch said she is happy she 
chose a pediatric nursing career.  
“There are always going to be illnesses 
and injuries,” Lynch said. “Health care doesn’t close.  We are open 24 hours a day.”Shortage of nurses is blamed on poor pay, stress

The Gainesville City Commis-
sion unanimously passed an ordi-
nance to regulate the bicycle cabs and rickshaws that give rides for 
tips and donations during game 
days.
The ordinance was first suggest-
ed in an October commission meet-ing as an answer to the problem of too many pedi-cabs on the streets near the campus.
Drivers will have to wear iden-
tification and display a vehicle-for-hire permit on the cab, as well as a license plate. 
The rickshaws will also be re-
quired to have turn signals, head- and taillights and side-view mir-rors. 
Alejandro Ramos, owner of lo-
cal bicycle-cab service Gainesville Rickshaws, said he expects the or-dinance to increase business  be-cause it will discourage companies from Orlando, who often come to Gainesville on game days and don’t act professional.
 “Sometimes they don’t have 
lights or good brakes,” he said.
Ramos said despite the initial 
cost of bringing his company up to the standards of the new ordinance, he is excited about its passing.
“It’ll help me more than it will 
hurt me,” he said. “I’m really ex-cited about it.”
Early in the meeting, Viola 
Moore, mother of a resident in the soon-to-close low-income housing development Seminary Lane, also spoke before the commission in a plea to help the residents there.
Mayor Pegeen Hanrahan said 
that the commission is working 
with the city to provide funding 
for Seminary Lane tenants to trans-
fer their utilities and pay for other moving expens-es.
The commis-
sion also ap-proved the an-
nexation of a piece of privately 
owned property on Southwest Wil-liston Road for development use.
Seven members of the commu-
nity spoke against the annexation, saying they were worried that the land will become overdeveloped and create a traffic problem similar 
to those on 34th Street and Archer 
Road. One speaker pointed out that there are already too many unsold houses in Gainesville.
Hanrahan emphasized that the 
owner of the land is legally allowed to develop, and the choice is only whether it will be under city or county jurisdiction.“Our hands are tied under state 
law,” she said. “Is it a great idea for someone to be  building right now? Maybe, maybe not. But that’s not the decision before the city com-mission.”FRIDAY, APRIL 3, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 11

As people stretch every dollar 
they can, local animal clinics and 
adoption organizations are also feel-
ing the effect of a slowed economy.
“It’s harder to get people to 
adopt animals right now because 
they don’t want to take on the ex-
tra expense,” said Hilary Knodel, a veterinary technician at the All Cats 
Healthcare Clinic on Northwest 13th 
Street.
Cats that would normally be ad-
opted from the clinic within a week 
have waited for double and triple 
that time. Knodel started a Face-
book group to help get the animals 
adopted.
Since she started the group, a few 
of the cats have left the clinic with 
new homes but overall interest has fallen considerably as the economy 
has worsened.
“Last semester students would 
come into the clinic just to play with 
the cats,” she said. “That has not 
happened at all yet.”              
The increased expense of pet sup-
plies and extra time animals spend at the clinic before adoption has 
strained the already tight budget.
Knodel also noticed people wait 
longer before bringing their pets 
for yearly check-ups or lab work and shots. Clients are not as willing 
to spend money on their animals like they were in the past she said. 
Knodel said an increasing number of 
owners who have animals needing 
procedures, such as surgeries, cost-
ing hundreds of dollars, will give up 
the pet instead of paying for it.
“It’s heartbreaking because we 
want to help these animals,” she said.
The Puppy Hill Farm Animal 
Rescue in Melrose also noticed the effects a bad economy can have on 
pet adoptions.   Founder and co-
owner Laurie Trenholm said clients 
who adopted pets years ago have re-
turned the animals because they can no longer provide care for them.
The increase in people losing 
their homes has also resulted in ani-
mals losing their homes, she said.
Puppies and kittens still get ad-opted quickly, but finding homes 
for the older animals is harder, she said.
 Financially, the pet rescue has 
survived rather well because of a grant awarded to Alachua County 
seven years ago through the Mad-
die’s Fund, a non-profit organiza-tion dedicated to stopping the kill-
ing of healthy animals.            
                                           T h e 
grant provides participants funding based on the number of dog and cat adoptions they do each year. 
Along with the Puppy Hill Farm 
Animal Rescue, several other local agencies participate in the program, 
including the Alachua County Hu-
mane Society and Animal Services, 
Gainesville Pet Rescue, Helping 
Hands Rescue at West End Animal 
Hospital and Haile’s Angels Pet 
Rescue, according to the Maddie’s Fund Web site.
When the seven-year grant ends 
in July, the organizations supported by it are supposed to have achieved 
self-sufficiency, but in this economy 
Trenholm said it will be a challenge.
“The everyday person is think-
ing twice about putting $5 in the donation jar,” she said. Both Knodel 
and Trenholm agree that despite 
the economy, adopting a pet is 
more rewarding and less expensive 
than buying one from a pet store or breeder.
On average, at both the clinic and 
the pet rescue, a pet costs about $100 to adopt. The price includes the nec-
essary shots and spaying or neuter-
ing of the animal.
Buying an animal instead of 
adopting it can cost three times that 
amount without the shots or fixing 
included, Trenholm said.AROUND GAINESVILLEAnimal clinics, adoption orgs feel economic strain

� THE COLLEGE WOULD ALSO FACE 
LAYOFFS.
By THOMAS STEWART
Alligator Staff Writer
tstewart@alligator.org
UF would lay off about 100 more staff and 
faculty under budget cut proposals described 
this week, bringing the number of layoffs UF 
could see in the next round of cuts to about 
250.
Most of the new layoffs would be in the 
Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, which proposed about 93 staff layoffs.
IFAS includes the College of Agricultural 
and Life Sciences. IFAS spokesman Jack Bat-tenfield said IFAS and the college were too intertwined to be able to separate cuts to the two entities.
Under its proposal, IFAS would cut about 
$16.4 million. In addition to staff layoffs, it 
would cut operating expenses, such as mon-
ey for travel and equipment, and reduce the number of graduate assistants by 10 percent, or 40 students, he said. IFAS predicts gradu-ate enrollment would fall by about 4 percent under that scenario.
Cuts to operating expenses and gradu-ate assistants would save about $3.7 million, while layoffs would save about $4 million.
About 97 vacant staff and faculty posi-
tions would be eliminated, saving about $6.7 
million. New fund-ing, such as grants, would be found for about 45 positions, 
saving about $2 million.
Building maintenance and electricity costs 
would also be cut by about $100,000.
Though the College of Veterinary Medi-
cine has not released its proposal, the only college that still hasn’t done so, college spokeswoman Sarah Carey discussed some of the details.
Under its $2.3 million cut, about 10 faculty 
and 10 staff positions, most of them vacant, would be cut, Carey said.  
The college would also hire about seven 
fewer residents and interns in the Veterinary Medical Center, which includes the small and large animal hospitals, next year, she said.
No programs would be cut and enroll-
ment would not be reduced, she said.
All colleges and administrative units were 
asked to present 10 percent budget cuts to UF by Wednesday. UF Provost Joe Glover said he had received most of them by Thursday afternoon.IFAS faces proposed budget cuts of about $16.4M

ing in the SFC gymnasium Thursday afternoon.
be.”
The report also stated that new 
members were subjected to push-
ups, running and sleep deprivation.
The evidence of hazing came 
from the testimonies of two girls, ac-cording to the report.
The report noted UF’s definition 
of hazing includes actions or situa-tions that endanger the mental or physical health or safety of a stu-dent.
In unanimously recommending 
the chapter’s suspension and pro-bation, the board noted the chapter had a history of hazing violations.
The chapter was suspended for 
three years in 2003, said Danielle Pechac, who assumed presidency of the chapter when it was allowed 
back on campus in 2006 and served 
until the summer of 2008, the semes-ter before the hazing occurred.
Pechac declined to comment on 
the specifics of the hazing detailed in the board’s report but said the chapter admitted guilt and accepted responsibility.
She said the chapter, which cur-
rently has no house, had been doing well since its reinstatement.
“We did everything 
to try and prevent this 
situation from happening again,” she said.
The group even accepted the 
award for best chapter in 2007-2008 from the Multicultural Greek Coun-cil in November, she said.
But 10 minutes before receiving 
the award, the chapter got a letter from UF informing it of its tempo-rary suspension due to allegations of hazing.
“It was an emotional rollercoast-
er,” she said. “It was just, you know, the best and worst thing at the exact 
same time.”
Pechac said she doesn’t under-
stand why the punishment from the 
national organization was so much harsher than UF’s ruling.“They (the members of the 
board) were willing to give us more opportunity than my national head-quarters was,” she said.
Questions about the national or-
ganization’s decision were referred to its director, who could not be reached by e-mail.
Pechac said she’s hurt but hope-
ful.
“We will work though every 
consequence that we were given,” she said. “We can and we will sur-vive it.”
New members subjected to push-ups, running, sleep deprivation
ance costs. This could mean simple changes, such as buying generic rather than brand-name drugs and going in for routine health screen-ings in order to prevent problems 
before they arise.
According to Lawrence Keen, 
assistant to the president, students 
may be slightly inconvenienced be-cause of the cutbacks.
Because a staff of about 850 has 
been consolidated to 800, students may notice slight changes, such as having to wait an extra day to see an 
adviser, Keen said.
No money will be cut from the 
college’s Student Life budget, a 
fund which is established by tak-ing 10 percent of the cost per credit hour that each student is enrolled in. From a credit hour fee of $59.80, $5.98 goes toward campus activities and services such as student govern-
ment.
“If we have done our job, the 
students will experience minimal 
impact,” Sasser said, in an interview held after the meeting.
Despite cutbacks, the college ap-
pears to be making strides in the positive direction.The president announced that an 
Articulation Agreement has been reached by SFC and UF’s business 
college, a plan that would guar-
antee business students from SFC entrance into UF if they meet the requirements. Students would then be eligible to take online classes for a business degree at UF and even pick up a minor if they choose.
There is no cap for the number of 
students in online classes, and stu-dents would still get all of the bene-fits, such as going to football games, that students who physically attend class receive.
A transportation bill was also 
discussed, one whose fate will be decided in the coming weeks by the Legislature. If the bill passes, a new 
route will be added to the existing 
two, one which runs from the Oaks Mall to the northwest campus. 
Student Body President Cesar 
Fernandez, who has been lobbying for the bill that is more than 9 years old, said the frequency will also be improved, with buses coming three times per hour.
President Sasser remained posi-
tive as he summarized the meeting by urging everyone to look for ways to find additional savings. 
“We’ll get through this,” he said.Santa Fe College president said budget cuts should have low impact on students� 15th ANNUAL DANCE MARATHON 
WILL BE HELD SATURDAY.
By CHELSEA KEENAN
Alligator Writer
About 600 students will stand for a cause 
this weekend in the O’Connell Center.
UF’s 15th annual Dance Marathon will 
kick off  on Saturday at 11:48 a.m., followed 
by 26.2 hours of dancing, donating money to 
the Children’s Miracle Network at Shands at 
UF, according to Madison Cheatwood, public relations chairwoman of the event. 
Children’s Miracle Network is a national organization that helps fund pediatric re-search and provides treatment for diseases and injuries.
About $435,560 was raised last year, she 
said, adding fundraising efforts began in Sep-tember. 
While some of the funds are used to rent 
out the  O’Connell Center, all remaining mon-ey will be given to Children’s Miracle Net-work at Shands Children’s Hospital at UF. 
To mix it up on the dance floor, partici-
pants will dance through different activities 
and perform a five-minute routine about ev-
ery hour. 
Ten of the hours will be themed, during 
which dancers will have the opportunity to match by dressing up in costume.
Cheatwood said themes this year include 
“Alice in Wonderland,” high school cliques, 
and even a birthday celebration in reference 
to Dance Marathon’s 15th anniversary.
Food for the event was donated by about 
40 different restaurants around town and will be served to correspond with each hour’s 
theme. Cheatwood said local bands and groups 
such as  the UF Symphony Orchestra and UF 
steel drum band will all perform during the 
event. 
But the marathon offers more than just 
fancy dance moves and rhythmic beats. 
She said the most touching part of the 
night will be when about 24 families share 
their stories about how the Children’s Miracle Network has impacted their lives.
No monetary goal was set this year be-
cause any amount of money will help, Cheat-
wood said.
“Every dollar stays local,” she said. “You 
can walk through Shands and see what (the 
money) paid for.”Charity event to benefit Children’s Miracle Network
aid as well as have higher qualification stan-
dards.
Students also took the opportunity dur-
ing the meeting to voice their concerns about 
looming budget cuts.
UF sophomore Caitlin Plowfield asked 
Machen about recent cuts to the College of 
Liberal Arts and Sciences’ religion depart-ment and how students who were in the ma-jor currently would be affected.
“I wanted to give a face to the questions 
being asked, especially in the religion depart-ment’s case,” said Plowfield, who is a religion major. She was reassured by Machen that al-though they would not be letting in new stu-
dents to the major under the college’s current 
budget cut proposal, she would be able to continue  and graduate.
Discussion also centered around the Board of Trustees’ new focus on graduate education 
and how it would affect 
undergraduates at UF. 
“We’re not backing off 
undergraduate education,” 
said Machen, who is in favor of reducing the un-
dergrad population at UF. “We’re just putting a ring around it to make it more 
special.”  At the end of the forum, Jonathan Shef-
field, Jr. president of IRHA, awarded Machen 
with a special IHRA pin and said it was rare 
for a university president to meet with stu-dents once, let alone five times in one school year. 
“If your only information is from the Al-
ligator then you’re not getting the whole con-nection,” Machen said. “So these forums are a very valuable and important link for me and the kids on campus.”  President addressed students’ concerns, cutting undergraduate populationSORORITY , from page 1

ON TELEVISION POLL QUESTION ONLINEBy EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
From underdog to top dog, the 
UF gymnastics team will be playing a 
different role Saturday at the NCAA 
North Central Regional Competition in 
Iowa City, Iowa.
It’s the most important meet of the 
season so far because it decides which 
teams and individuals will advance to 
the NCAA Championships on April 
16-18.
The top two teams and top two all-
around competitors who are not on 
an advancing team from each regional 
proceed to the national championship 
competition.
The rotation of events will be differ-
ent for the Gators. UF has a bye in the 
first rotation and starts on floor exercise 
before moving to vault, uneven bars 
and ending on balance beam.
The Gators were overlooked at the 
Southeastern Conference Champion-
ships because of their thinner lineup, 
but they still managed a third-place fin-
ish.
And while the league champion-
ships have no direct impact on the up-
coming meet, the team is feeding off its 
success.
“SECs was certainly, in our point 
of view, pretty much like a win,” said 
Courtney Gladys, who believes the confidence garnered from the SEC Championships will roll over into the regional competition. 
It may be a bit harder for the other 
teams in the North Central Region — UCLA, Minnesota, Denver, Iowa State and Iowa — to ignore the Gators this time considering UF heads in as the top-ranked team in the grouping, ranked No. 6 in the country.
“I feel like any meet we go to, every-

Only 16 teams get a chance to host an NCAA 
regional, so road play is crucial for a team’s 
chance at a championship run.
The way the No. 20 Gators have played 
away from Gainesville so far this season sug-gests they are not yet prepared for that honor.
UF (18-9, 6-3 Southeastern Conference) has 
a chance to turn the corner on the road with a successful weekend series at Vanderbilt (17-11, 3-6 SEC), which is 13-3 at home, starting tonight at 7.
A winning weekend could 
help ready the Gators for the rest of their SEC schedule, including another road conference series next weekend at Auburn.
“The thing with this team is 
we need to learn how to play 
on the road,” UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “We have to be able to play as well on the road as (we do at home). (These road games) will 
tell us what type of team we have in the next 
couple of weekends.”
Struggles with the hitting, pitching and 
fielding have all led to their 2-5 record away 
from Gainesville.
As a team, UF has hit .211 with 24 runs and 
just three homers in those seven games, and the 
team scored more than 5 runs only once — UF beat Central Florida in Orlando 7-3 on March 
18.
The pitching has not been any better, allow-
ing 34 runs in away contests.
While the pitching and the offense have 
been bad, the defense has been atrocious. The 
Gators are averaging just over 2.5 errors per Gators need

� SHE IS STILL RECOVERING FROM 
OFF-SEASON WRIST SURGERY.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer

It’s the elephant in the locker room, an 
obvious issue that goes unaddressed.
Tiffany DeFelice’s left wrist, which re-quired off-season surgery, has made its 
presence known to the UF softball team. 
The sophomore catcher has missed 14 of 
the team’s 39 games this year due to the lingering effects of extensor carpi ulnaris subluxation — a condition where a wrist 
tendon slides in and out of its groove. 
DeFelice, her coaches and the team’s 
training staff treat her wrist like a petulant 
pro athlete: When it’s ready to play, it will play.
“We just kind of go 
with the flow of whatever my wrist feels like do-ing,” DeFelice said. “So if it’s having a bad day, I 
just tell Coach, ‘Bad day today,’ and we’ll go from there. If it’s good, we just 
keep going. As long as it stays at a level where I can play and where I feel that I can perform and I’m not overwhelmed by 
pain, then we’ll just go with it.”
If she stays at that level, she’ll see 
time against Mississippi State (17-17, 2-10 
Southeastern Conference) this weekend, 
as the No. 1 Gators (36-3, 15-1 SEC) host 
the Bulldogs for a three-game series.

22, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, APRIL 3, 2009
The biggest question facing UF’s offense next season is how 
to replace Percy Harvin, and it seems like a lot of people have taken the attitude that, “Oh, Andre Debose will be 
here next year. It’s all taken care of.”
Debose, rated the nation’s No. 2 receiver coming out of San-
ford Seminole High by Rivals.com, has been touted as the Sec-ond Coming, but the claims that he’ll shoulder the load Harvin left behind need to be tempered. Maybe he will be the next Har-vin — just not yet.
Urban Meyer has made it clear that he doesn’t want to give up 
what he calls “The Percy Position” just because Harvin entered the NFL Draft, and why would he? Meyer said opposing coaches told him that the toughest matchups against UF last season were Harvin and tight end Aaron Hernandez, and he wants to keep at 
least one player on the field who’s versatile enough to score by 
taking direct snaps, handoffs, option pitches or catching passes.
From the way Meyer talks about Debose, it’s clear he thinks 
he has his man. On National Signing Day, he called him “the best player in America,” and he’s counting on Debose to make his presence felt right away. 
“I expect him to be a starter and a guy who will come in and 
contribute,” Meyer said Monday. “I expect it because I’m going off his highlight film. Sometimes I give guys too much credit, 
but he has one of the best highlight films I have ever seen. He’s 
tough, too. I went and saw him play in person, and I saw him do some great things.”
Sure, Debose’s highlight film is dazzling. He has blazing 
speed that helps him burn defenders while taking direct snaps, hand-offs, end-arounds or running routes — all the things that make up The Percy Position.
But Debose isn’t at spring practice, and he won’t arrive until 
the summer. As Meyer said this week, spring ball is the time to 
determine who’ll see playing time, and there’s a host of talented 
athletes already in place trying to fill Harvin’s shoes.
Receiver David Nelson said it’ll take several players to make 
up for Harvin, and at least for next season, that’ll be true.
Running backs Jeff Demps, Chris Rainey and Emmanuel 
Moody can take most of the rushing load, along with quarter-back Tim Tebow. Receiver Deonte Thompson is chomping at the bit to take over a more versatile role, and a big group of wideouts is trying to earn more catches.
There’s only so much pigskin to go around, and Debose 
doesn’t have the luxury of going through spring practice to learn the offense and adjust to the speed of the college game — two things that Harvin said he struggled with early on.
Receivers coach Billy Gonzales is a little less caught up in the 
hype, and he knows Debose has a lot of work to do before he’ll 
be getting carries and catches in crunch time.
“I don’t know what I can depend on right now because I 
haven’t had a chance to work with him and he hasn’t been here,” 
Gonzales said. “Our expectations are really high, but they’re rea-sonable. It’s hard to come into any offense and have an impact as a freshman.”
Keep in mind that in his freshman season, Harvin wasn’t re-
ally even Harvin yet. He was more of a side show than the main act for most of the year. He showed flashes of brilliance here and 
there, but it took 10 games before he got 10 touches in a contest. 
From then on, he was a focal point of the offense. He was the 
MVP of the Southeastern Conference Championship and the 
leading receiver in the BCS title game. In his sophomore and ju-nior seasons, the offense revolved around him, and things seemed slightly out of whack when he wasn’t around (see the 2008 SEC Championship).
But all of that took time, and Debose 
will need at least the same grace period.
“I definitely would say he’ll come in 
and contribute, but I don’t know if he’ll be able to come in and be the man right away,” Harvin said. “I think between him, Rainey, Demps and David Nelson, they’ll get the job done. But to put all that 
pressure on one person is hard.”
And Debose will join the team this summer with a level of 
hype that Harvin didn’t even have to face.
When Harvin signed with UF in 2006, he had Tebow in his 
recruiting class, which took a lot of pressure off. Debose — easily the best offensive player in the Gators’ 2009 class — won’t have that luxury.
What’s more, there’s a mold for Debose to fit into. Harvin 
arrived as a talented athlete, but it was hard to know what to expect. He carved out a position in Meyer’s offense, and now De-bose has to live up to it.
That’s a notion that the 6-foot, 176-pounder isn’t happy with, 
as he said on signing day that he doesn’t want to be compared to anyone else. Like it or not, he’ll be measured by the Harvin yardstick throughout his career, and it’s clear that there are some differences.
They’re both very versatile receivers, but Debose doesn’t have 
the same tools as Harvin.
“I think Percy Harvin is more of a guy who makes people miss 
in open space because he has that wiggle,” Rivals.com recruit-
ing analyst Barton Simmons said. “Debose is more of a one-cut, 
outrun-you type of guy. He’s very efficient in his movements as far as outrunning people to the sideline or up the middle. That’s what he excels at, more than making people miss in space. Not that he can’t do that, but that’s more of Harvin’s specialty than Debose’s.”
Essentially, Debose is more like a taller version of Demps 
than Harvin, Jr. He uses his straight-line speed more than the lightning-quick dance moves that Harvin utilized to embarrass 
defenders.
None of this is to say that Debose isn’t an electrifying receiver. 
In his senior season, he rushed for 1,332 yards and 12 touch-
downs, caught 27 passes for 664 yards and six scores, threw for 353 yards and four touchdowns and also returned kickoffs and punts. He also made the winning touchdown catch in the 6-A 
State Championship against Miami Northwestern, scoring three 
times in the game. 
He has the talent to be a huge asset for UF, but to expect him 
to fill in for one of college football’s best players right away is very far off base. If Debose is going to be like Harvin this season, he’ll be like the freshman Harvin, not the one who served as the linchpin for UF’s dynamic attack for two years.
“I think he can come in and help them in the fall for sure, but 
to think he’ll be the centerpiece of that offense is a little tough 
to say,” Simmons said. “He’s a pretty ridiculous athlete, and all 
that’s going to come through. He’ll have a big play here or there, but I don’t think he’ll be an impact player until mid-season at the least.”High expectations for Debose unreasonable

ORLANDO — Patrick Ewing has a the-
ory on why Orlando Magic do-it-all center 
Dwight Howard isn’t mentioned as a lead-ing MVP candidate: He’s a big man.
LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and Dwya-
ne Wade lure voters with their “flash and dash,” said Ewing, quickly adding that when it comes to substance, Howard is as dominant as that trio.
Howard and the Magic face James and 
the Cleveland Cavaliers Friday in the final regular-season meeting between the East-ern Conference division leaders. The Magic don’t expect the attention to be on Howard.
“I think it’s because he 
plays the center position,” said Ewing, a Hall of Fame center with the New York Knicks and now a Magic 
assistant coach. “You guys look for that flash and dash. All the other guys who are in the race are all 
small guys. He’s a big guy 
who should be in there.”
Ewing, of course, might be a little biased. 
He works closely with Howard and in his 
17 NBA seasons as one of the NBA’s most dominant big men, Ewing was an 11-time All-Star, but never league MVP.
Yet there is a case to be made for How-
ard.
The Magic center is leading the NBA 
in rebounding (13.9) and blocks (2.93) per game and has the second most double-
doubles (57) in the league this season. How-
ard ranks third in shooting percentage (58 percent) and his 21.2 points per game is no slouch.
Such statistics have him as a leading can-
didate for defensive player of the year, yet only James, Bryant and Wade have been mentioned for the league’s most prestigious regular-season honor: the MVP. Even cen-
tral Florida resident and the Magic’s most 
famous fan, Tiger Woods, left Howard out of the discussion when asked last month who should get the award.Howard not

game on the road, including 
a six-error performance at Arkansas on March 15.
O’Sullivan thinks concen-
tration has been the biggest issue preventing his team from succeeding when they 
are not in McKethan Stadi-
um, and he needs his expe-rienced players to step up in these games.
“We’ve got to try and work 
on our focus,” O’Sullivan said. “We’ve talked about it. We have challenged a few of our older guys who might not have been playing as well, and hopefully they will 
show some good leadership 
on the road.”
With so many inexperi-
enced players on the team, it 
is important for the Gators to 
get good performances out of their veteran players.
O’Sullivan doesn’t blame 
the team’s youth for the 
shortcomings on the road be-
cause the Gators had the same struggles last year when they went 7-14 in away games and 
0-4 at neutral sites.
“I’m sure (the team’s 
youth) probably is a factor 
in it, but we got to get over the hump,” he said. “I don’t 
know if we need to change 
our approach or what, but we need to play better on the road.”
The Gators will rely on 
inexperienced pitching this weekend with junior college transfer Jeff Barfield starting tonight and freshman lefty Nick Maronde taking the mound at the start of Satur-
day’s game.
O’Sullivan knows he can’t 
rely on UF’s play at home to go deep in the postseason.
“If we are going to get to 
the postseason, which is ob-viously everybody’s goal, we 
have to learn to play on the road,” he said.FRIDAY, APRIL 3, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 23

In golf, a sport that focuses on the indi-
vidual, you don’t often hear a coach beg-
ging for a stronger team effort.
But after the Gators’ previous tourna-
ment, coach Buddy Alexander did just 
that.
“You aren’t going to win with three 
(players with good) scores a day, and basi-
cally that’s what we had all weekend,” Al-
exander said.
However, as the No. 5 UF men’s golf 
team prepares to travel to Atlanta to play in their final event before the postseason 
starting Sunday, the U.S. Collegiate Cham-pionship, Alexander believes he is partly to 
blame for his team’s performance in their 
last tournament.
“I think that a lot of that blame might fall 
on me because I elected not to take Toby Ragland, and he is typically one of our 
more consistent guys,” he said.
At this point of the season, Alexander 
will not make the same mistake twice.
“We are pretty much locked in to four 
guys playing the rest of the year,” he said.
Those four guys are Billy Horschel, Tim 
McKenney, Tyson Alexander and Ragland.
One problem area for UF this year had been its fifth spot in the lineup.
Alexander has given Will Strickler, Mu 
Hu and Max Kieffer the opportunity to make the 
fifth spot theirs, but incon-sistent play has prevented 
them from doing so.
In this event, sopho-
more Andres Echavarria 
will take his chance at the position.
“Andres hasn’t played a lot this semes-
ter, but we have been very inconsistent at 
that fifth spot with Will, Mu and Max,” Al-
exander said. 
“I’m just rolling the stones with Andres a little bit, giving him a shot to see what he 
can do.”
With the postseason just two weeks 
away, the Gators will have to find the golfer 
that completes their lineup quickly if they want to be successful.
But before they can get to the postseason, 
UF will have to play in what could be its 
most difficult tournament of the year. The 
top five teams in the nation, including the Gators, will be competing this weekend.
“This is the biggest tournament of the 
semester so far, it’s the best field that we 
will play, it’s on a terrific golf course, and it 
kind of sets the stage for possibilities in the postseason,” Alexander said.UF MEN’S GOLFNo. 5 spot up for grabs heading into tournament
one’s like, ‘Oh, Florida, we want to beat them,’ so of course (the other teams) are going to want to get us,” Alicia Good-win said.
Goodwin, who sprained her knee 
before the SEC Championships and was pulled from the lineup, will most likely be back on bars and beam lineups in the regional competition. Despite be-ing taken out of the lineup at the last minute, Goodwin said she doesn’t feel any added pressure to make up for missed action.
Based on rankings, No. 7 UCLA is 
the stiffest competition the Gators will face, with the next-highest ranked team being No. 18 Minnesota.
Facing UCLA is nothing new for the 
Gators, who have 
faced the Bruins 
in regional com-
petition two of the last three years. UF coach Rhonda 
Faehn, a UCLA alumna, earned All-
America honors as a gymnast there. 
Faehn believes the Gators still may 
be able to use injuries as a way to divert 
attention from their ranking.
With no more than eight possible 
gymnasts competing out of a 12-wom-an roster, consistency shouldn’t be an issue with the possibility of five gym-nasts competing all-around.
“We all wish we had the other four 
girls,” Elizabeth Mahlich said. 
Faehn said the gymnasts healthy 
enough to compete are fully committed and said the other teams at the regional competition may be thinking, like at the SEC competition, that they have a great shot because UF is beat up.
“We proved them all wrong at 
SECs,” Faehn said.
She also realized the top seeding in 
the regional doesn’t bring about any extra points.
“You can never step into a regional 
championship thinking you’ve got it in the bag,” Faehn said. “The No. 1 seeds everywhere are feeling, ‘We still have to do our job.’”UCLA poses 
biggest threatInexperienced pitchers start series at Vanderbilt
Wednesday at Auburn, so UF coach 
Tim Walton put her back in the start-ing lineup for both of the Gators’ wins 
against the Tigers. In Game 2, Walton 
moved her to the second spot in the or-der, where right fielder Kelsey Bruder had started the last 19 games. 
“I have no idea how that decision was 
made,” DeFelice said. “I got on the bus, and Coach says, ‘How’s your wrist?’ and I go, ‘It’s good,’ and he says, ‘OK, you’re starting.’”
DeFelice responded by batting 1 for 3 
with two RBIs and a walk in the second game of the series. After the doubleheader, Walton ex-
plained his decision to move the versa-tile sophomore up in the order. 
“Her on-base percentage is really 
high, and I didn’t want to give up on an opportunity to drive in more runs,” Walton said. “She’s a matchup problem because she can do so many things — she can hit and run, she can bunt, she’s 
so good at a lot of different things.”
DeFelice was modest about her abili-
ties on the field, simply saying she does 
whatever her coach asks her to do.
“I try to make the pitcher work as 
hard as they possibly can to get me out,” she said. “I like to make them feel like they really had to work. I don’t mind if I have to work at it. If I have to go 23 or 17 pitches, it doesn’t bother me — I enjoy being there.”
As a freshman playing in the Wom-
en’s College World Series, DeFelice fought through a 23-pitch at-bat against Louisiana-Lafayette.
An at-bat that long can even wear on 
a player who says she has “always de-
stroyed” batter’s boxes and is known to 
kick up the dirt and take the chalk off the clay when she steps up to the plate.
“Coach has said it a million times: 
I’m very intense. That’s just the way I am,” she said. “I really love this game and I really love playing it, so it just comes out in me like that.”

This weekend the No. 10 UF 
men’s tennis team is hosting its last 
two home matches of the season beginning at 3 p.m. today against LSU.
The Tigers (6-8, 1-5 Southeastern 
Conference) are only ranked No. 34 by the Intercollegiate Tennis Asso-ciation but have plenty of ferocity at Court 1. Michael Venus is No. 6 in singles, while the duo of Venus and Neal Skupski is No. 8 in doubles.
Gators freshman Carlos Cueto 
defeated Venus 7-6 (7), 7-6 (6) at the SEC Indoors on Jan. 19. Cueto 
is ranked No. 27, one spot ahead of 
teammate Alex Lacroix.
UF (12-6, 3-3 SEC) is coming off 
a 6-1 victory at Mississippi State but dropped its last home match — the first loss at Linder Stadium this spring — to No. 2 Mississippi last Friday night. The Gators are current-ly tied for second in the SEC East.
A win against LSU would push 
UF closer to division leaders Geor-gia and Tennessee, ITA’s third- and fourth-ranked teams, who defeated the Gators in mid-March.
On Sunday, UF will face Arkan-
sas (9-9, 1-5 SEC), which also has a highly ranked singles player in No. 13 Blake Strode.
Gators coach Andy Jackson has 
often emphasized the team over the individual, so wins on courts 4 through 6, as well as in doubles, will be just as crucial as his top players’ performances in both matches. WOMEN BAYOU-BOUND: While the men attempt to avoid upsets, the No. 16 UF women’s team faces a critical 
and final regular-season road stretch 
against No. 24 LSU and No. 15 Ar-kansas. The Gators play the Tigers at 4 p.m. today.
“We have a tough weekend,” 
UF coach Roland Thornqvist said. “LSU is really good at home. We’re certainly going to have our work cut out for us. We’re going to continue 
working on a couple things.”
The Gators (10-6, 4-2 SEC) have 
had a seemingly endless carousel 
of doubles teams 
over the season. 
Marrit Boonstra and Jo Mather entered the ITA doubles rankings 
on Tuesday at 
No. 80. The tan-dem has won the last eight matches 
it has played.
Boonstra, the No. 8 singles player, 
is undefeated at 15-0 in dual match play despite falling three spots in the rankings this week. 
Still, the junior is excited about 
continuing SEC play and said the Arkansas match would be a crucial one.
Mather has just as much confi-
dence as her partner.
“The team is getting along great,” 
Mather said. “The more we play, the better we get.”
The doubles point usually sets 
the tone for the match. 
Thornqvist is aware of this and 
believes his tinkering — which has included involving walk-ons Brooke Allen and Lauren Wolken — has paid off.
� HIGH SCHOOL, COLLEGE AND PRO 
ATHLETES WILL PARTICIPATE.

Home sweet home.
After the start of the outdoor season on the 
road was cut short due to inclement weather, UF is home for its next track meet.
If the weather holds up this weekend, some 
of UF’s athletes will have the opportunity to open their outdoor season on a grand stage in the Florida Relays.
The Relays, in its 65th season, showcases 
high school talents competing against each other and also pits pros against some of the finest college athletes in a two-day event. 
UF senior Carlos Phillips has been to quite 
a few Florida Relays, some of which were reminiscent of what happened in Tallahassee last weekend. 
However, Phillips understands the weath-
er is a part of the sport and is not concerned about it in his final Florida Relays as a Gator.
“I’ve been to Florida Relays since my junior 
year in high school,” Phillips said. 
“It’s been rained out a couple times, but 
whether its raining or just light showers or whether it’s hot, sunny, you just gotta go out there and run.”
The last time UF competed in front of the 
home crowd was in the Tom Jones Memorial Invitational in January, and the team had one 
of its best showings of the indoor season. The athletes will enjoy the opportunity to 
compete in Gainesville this weekend, and they will try to outdo their last home performance.
“It’s the best thing because you’ve got your 
friends, your family there, and you don’t want 
to embarrass yourself out there,” Phillips said. “It’s fun, though, in front of the fans, in front of my home crowd.”
UF coach Mike Holloway, who has attend-
ed his fair share — and then some — of Florida Relays, relishes the opportunity to be a part of this Relays. 
“It’s always a very exciting event. It’s al-
ways an honor to be a part of it,” Holloway said. “I’ve actually attended every Florida Re-lay since 1978, so I’ve been around a long time, seen a lot of relays.”
This weekend’s Relays, which begins Fri-
day at 10 a.m., promises to be an entertaining two days, filled with some of the highest com-petition in the sport.
“There’s going to be a world-record at-
tempt by an elite group of athletes on Satur-day morning in the shuttle hurdles relay, and we’re excited about that,” Holloway said. “The Gators are a part of that relay, so we’re gonna try not to get beat by too much in that 
situation.”UF TENNISGators face Tigers in critical late-season matches
