An anonymous letter names homopho-
bia and racism as factors in UF President 
Bernie Machen’s controversial decision to end the search for a new Levin College of Law dean.
The letter was addressed to Machen, 
Provost Joe Glover, Director of Employee Relations Kim Czaplewski, Gainesville Sun reporter Jeff Schweers and the Alligator. It 
states “the students and faculty are very up-
set about the continued perception of racism 
and homophobia at the College of Law.”
Although the letter was unsigned, some 
faculty, staff and students have expressed 
similar sentiments.
In a private meeting for faculty and staff on Tuesday, Machen ad-
dressed concerns about di-versity in the dean search.
The ﬁ  nalists from the 
search were black Univer-sity of Kentucky College of 
Law dean David Brennen, openly gay former U.S. ambassador David Hueb-
ner and Georgia State University College of Law professor Samuel Donaldson.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said Ma-
chen responded to outside views that his de-cision not to select any of the deans “might be seen as a racist or homophobic.”
“He made his decision based on that he 
did not believe that the transformative lead-er was in the pool of candidates,” she said.
For Matthew Christ, a 24-year-old sec-
ond-year UF law student, the three can-didates met Machen’s qualiﬁ  cations for a transformative dean. Christ said Machen should have a meeting with students and explain his deﬁ  nition of “transformative.”

Dan Dickrell’s students have 
watched their professor’s hair 
grow and twist into new forms almost every semester.
Last Fall, he sported a com-
manding handlebar mustache. This basketball season, he ditched the whiskers in favor of a sky-high hair homage.
The 36-year-old engineering 
professor now sports a mohawk in honor of both the Gators’ winning streak and one of his favorite players, Will Yeguete.
“The engineering life is not 
always the most fun,” Dickrell said. “I try to break up the mo-notony as much as I can.”
He said he plans to keep the 
hairstyle until the Gators lose.
“If you look around bas-
ketball, it’s an emerging hair-style,” Dickrell said. “I thought 
it would be really funny to see 
how many of my students I could recruit to do this with me.”
So far, none have.“I laughed out loud,” said 
Michael Hallenstein, a 20-year-old UF civil engineering sopho-more, when he saw the moun-
tain mane.
He said his statics profes-sor is known for doing things 
like this, and that it makes the class more fun without distract-ing him from learning. Dickrell 
agreed and said he often chang-
es up his ‘do. He called the mo-hawk “one or two steps above” the norm. 
“Regardless of what peo-
ple think, the mohawk is not caused by static electricity,” Hallenstein joked.
Dickrell’s two children will 
be sporting the gelled look as well this year. The 5- and 7-year-olds display the ‘dos ev-ery summer, and this year, their dad will match.
“I’m keeping myself enter-
tained at the same time,” Dick-rell said.
No. 15 Will Yeguete doesn’t 
know the professor personally, 
but he doesn’t mind the trib-
ute.
“I think it’s kinda cool,” said 
Yeguete, a 21-year-old UF in-
ternational studies senior. “It’s something different.”
He said some of his friends 
on the team have had the hair-style in the past, but he’s the only one that’s kept it.
“My mom really likes it,” he 
said.

A local startup is relocating to 
Austin after a big win at music 
and media conference South by Southwest, leaving the Gainesville startup community with mixed 
feelings.
Feathr, founded by Aidan Au-gustin and Neal Ormsbee, dur-
ing their time as UF engineering undergraduate students, beat about 300 startup companies from around the world to win Capital 
Factory’s second annual “Move 
Your Startup to Austin” competi-tion.
The company, which uses a 
smartphone app to maximize net-working opportunities for confer-ence attendees, walked away with more than $200,000 worth of cash investment and other prizes, in-cluding funds to cover relocation costs, Augustin said.
Feathr will be surrounded by 
Austin’s top startups as part of Capital Factory’s incubator, which 
provides a cooperative ofﬁ  ce space 
and shared resources for up-and-coming businesses.
For the founders, both 23, the

MIAMI — Justin Bieber 
claimed after a shaky sobriety test 
in Florida that he was suffering from a hairline fracture in his right foot and made condescending 
comments to officers, according 
to a Miami Beach police document released Tuesday.
The police summary of 
Bieber’s performance on various sobriety tests following his Jan. 23 arrest shows that the pop singer told officers he had injured his foot skateboarding three months 
earlier. 
The officer had noted that 
Bieber appeared to sway and have leg tremors during one of 
the tests and also winced as if in pain.
“He appeared to have great 
difficulty,” the report noted, adding that the injury never was mentioned or noticed after that test.
Bieber, who has pleaded 
not guilty to driving under the influence and other charges, also told officers he was not drag racing in a rented Lamborghini 
along with R&B singer Khalil 
Amir Sharieff, who was driving a Ferrari when both were stopped. 
Bieber, who turned 20 March 1, 
questioned why he was arrested in the first place.The report describes Bieber 
as initially “agitated and condescending” and using frequent profanity when brought 
to the police station.
“He then got upset and said, 
‘I’m 19 years old. I’m just out 
having a good time,’” the report quoted him as saying. “‘What were you doing when you were 19?’”
The officer replied that he 
was not driving around in a 
Lamborghini at that age.
“Yeah, well, I bet you didn’t 
have millions of dollars in your 
bank account either,” Bieber was quoted in reply.
The singer told officers that black Cadillac Escalade SUVs following the two sports cars were carrying security personnel and that the group was trying to avoid celebrity photographers who were tailing them.
The officer mentioned to 
another officer that it appeared Bieber and Sharieff were having difficulty driving the high-end cars.
Bieber was quoted as saying, 
“What? I’ve been driving Lamborghinis since I was 15.”
Other topics of discussion, the 
report noted, included Bieber’s numerous tattoos and fishing for pike in his native Canada with his grandfather. 
He also mentioned taking an 
anti-anxiety medication whenever he feels “closed in,” according to the report.
Police drug tests found the 
presence of the active ingredient 
in marijuana and Xanax, an anti-
anxiety drug. 
Traces of alcohol were also 
detected with a breath test, but the level was below the 0.02 threshold considered intoxicated for drivers under age 21.
Bieber faces a May 5 trial date.
A Canadian judge recently 
scheduled a preliminary hearing 
for the case in which Bieber is ac-
cused of assaulting a limousine driver for April 14.
Before Miami DUI arrest, Bieber told police his foot was broken

A new UF course on music 
history is uniting nations — at 
least online. 
More than 31,000 people 
around the globe have en-
rolled in Music’s Big Bang: 
The Genesis of Rock ‘n’ Roll, a new massive open online course on Coursera. But the class developer and instruc-tor is in Gainesville — it’s UF Center for Media Innovation and Research executive direc-tor David Carlson.
“My guess is that within a 
week, I’ll have more students than the entire Student Body of Florida State,” Carlson said.
He said about 70 percent 
of the students live outside of the U.S., in countries like Mol-dova, China, South Africa, Ja-maica, Mexico and Spain. 
The first person to post in 
the class was on a boat in New Zealand.
The class, which started 
March 13 and runs through mid-May, covers 60 years of music, starting in the early 1900s.
“It’s more about what led 
up to rock ‘n’ roll,” Carlson said, “than it is about rock ‘n’ 
roll itself.”
He also said the university 
is adjusting the class to offer it 
as a four-credit course to UF students this Summer.
The fully online class is free 
and allows students to sign up until the end of the course. 
Instead of having two 60-
minute lectures, they’re broken down into 12 separate 10-min-ute downloadable videos to make them manageable. Carl-son said a lot of the students have jobs and a family, which makes watching a 10-minute 
video more convenient.
Hiring teaching assistants 
to grade the course work was 
unrealistic, Carlson said, so exams will be computer grad-ed. Students will grade each others’ optional projects.
Jason Cain, a UF mass com-
munications Ph.D. candidate 
who taught Rock ‘n’ Roll and 
American Society with Carl-son, said he is excited to see UF getting into the MOOC market.
“The benefit is that you can 
get a lot of information to peo-ple quickly and efficiently,” Cain said. “It also alleviates 
the tyranny of geography a bit 
and allows a person from re-ally anywhere to participate in classes offered by UF.”
Victoria Cappelli, a 20-year-
old UF public relations junior, said she’d be hesitant to sign up for the Coursera class.
“I would be somewhat 
interested, but probably not enough to actually enroll in the class,” said Cappelli, who’s taking Rock ‘n’ Roll and American Society. “A lot of the things that I have even learned in this class are really easy to read about online.”Music course hits high

Gator fans want to follow in the 
footsteps of their basketball team 
— No. 1 in the country. 
This year, UF students are filling 
out their March Madness brackets with a dash of school pride. 
Andrew Selepak, director of the 
UF online master’s program with a specialization in social media, said his students are looking forward to the tournament.
“My students are heavily in-
volved in sports, and they’re go-ing to be really excited about the March Madness brackets … and talking about their brackets,” he said.
Filling out a bracket requires 
participants to choose the win-ner of each matchup, predict the ultimate victor and call the final score.
Warren Buffet is upping the 
ante this year by offering $1 billion to anyone who guesses the entire tournament’s outcome correctly. 
Selepak said $1 billion is going 
to motivate a lot 
of people to par-ticipate, but pre-dicting a perfect bracket is impos-sible.
“You can’t 
predict some of the upsets that 
are going to happen or know when an injury might occur,” he said.
Kevin Hull, a 35-year-old UF 
mass communication and journal-ism Ph.D. student, said he thinks everyone has filled out a bracket at some point, but having someone to root for makes it more exciting. 
“Obviously, students on cam-
pus here are going to root for the Gators,” he said. 
Corey Tober, a 22-year-old UF 
accounting graduate student, has been participating in tournaments for about five years, but this is his first year betting money.
“It makes the tournament more 
enjoyable to watch because you’re affected in some way by the out-come of the game,” he said. 
Selepak said the Gators going 
undefeated in the Southeastern Conference has generated a lot of school pride this season.
“Most of the students at UF 
were not here the last time UF won a national championship in basket-ball,” he said. “So for them, this is really exciting because they’re not used to this.”
March Madness brackets create buzz

2014 SEC championship under

“Yeah, I kind of opened 
myself up for that one,” Dick-
rell said, who clarified that he originally intended to keep the

He faltered. “Well, I mean, I could still

UF engineering professor Dan Dickrell teaches class 
Wednesday. The professor shaved his hair into a mohawk for basketball season in the style of player Will Yeguete.
It moved early into Innovation Hub
gustin said, “but we still have a lot of work to do.” 
Trevor Abbott, co-founder of local startup Spin 
Chill, said some Gainesville entrepreneurs view the 
startup’s departure as disloyal to the community, which has supported Feathr since the idea took 
shape more than two years ago.
But he said others view the company’s recent 
success as an opportunity for Gainesville to shine 
on a national stage and showcase the town’s poten-tial.
“When they do wildly well in Texas, they won’t 
be seen as an Austin startup,” said Abbott, a 21-year-old UF mechanical engineering senior. “They’ll be seen as one of us.”
Feathr was one of the first startups to set up shop 
in the Innovation Hub downtown, and Augustin said he attributes his company’s success to Gaines-ville’s startup community.“There is nowhere in the U.S. that could’ve been 
better for us the past two years,” he said.
Ian Mitchell, president of the UF Entrepreneur-
ship Club and 20-year-old international business masters student, said Florida missed an opportu-nity to create jobs and strengthen its conference in-dustry by not pushing harder to draw the company to Orlando, which was on Feathr’s short list for po-tential future homes.
“It is a failure on the part of the state of Florida,” 
he said. “There is no follow through to keep mature startups here once they start to hire employees and build revenue.”
But David Whitney, entrepreneur in residence 
for the UF College of Engineering, said as a private company, this move only concerns Feathr’s inves-tors, stakeholders and customers — not the state.
“We see bright people arrive and brighter peo-
ple leave, but that doesn’t mean it’s our loss,” said Whitney, also a venture capitalist. “It’s just the na-ture of a college town.”STARTUP , from page 1LOCAL

Gainesville High School students got a 
lunchtime lecture from UF fraternity brothers 
Wednesday afternoon.
Members of the Alpha Tau Omega frater-
nity spent the high school’s two 30-minute 
lunch periods hosting an informational table 
session in the cafeteria to educate the students about alcohol and drug safety.
“A lot of students here are going to be stu-dents coming to UF, so we figured what bet-ter place to talk about underage drinking with underage students?” said Christopher Kes-sling, a 22-year-old UF psychology senior who joined ATO as a sophomore. 
Lina Aubrey, the high school’s activities di-
rector, said this was the perfect venue for the fraternity members to present their informa-tion sessions.
“We can’t make the kids’ decisions for 
them,” Aubrey said, “but we can inform them and help them.”Though only members of ATO were pres-
ent, Kessling said that the fraternity hoped to make this an annual tradition, one where mul-tiple fraternities and sororities participate.
“We’re here representing just Greek life as 
a whole, we just want to give back,“ Kessling 
said.The fraternity displayed a PowerPoint, 
poster and various handouts about the con-
sequences of underage drinking and Florida laws that deal with it.
Kessling said Greek life’s history of drink-
ing did not diminish the value of their presen-tation.
“Yes, there’s people that drink, but a lot of 
guys are of-age and do make responsible deci-sions,” Kessling said. “People tend to focus on that one side of Greek life ... but we do a lot of service, and a lot of great things happen, too.” ATO brothers warn high school students of drinking dangers

Students feeling taxed about 
filing their returns can turn to UF 
for help. 
Volunteer Income Tax Assis-
tance, known as VITA, is offering 
free tax preparation on campus 
until April 15. The program is funded by an Internal Revenue Service grant awarded to the United Way of North Central Florida.
“So many places pop up 
around tax season that offer 
predatory services,” said Jennifer 
Stojkovic, the program’s commu-nity impact manager. “If you do your taxes with us, it is complete-ly free and completely safe.”
All help is provided by stu-
dent volunteers. 
Joshua Giancarlo, a 27-year-old third-year UF law student and a VITA site coordinator, said more than 50 law students are volunteering this year. The training required by the program  helps volunteers do their own 
taxes. 
“That’s something that they’ll 
know forever,” he said. 
Marilyn George, a 21-year-old 
UF accounting senior, said she 
thinks the program is helpful for students.
“People pay a lot of money to file their taxes, but as students, we don’t have money to pay for these services,” she said. 
The program is also avail-
able to international students. Levin College of Law, which has 
partnered with VITA since 2010, 
completed 197 international tax returns last year.
“International students get 
their returns and don’t know where to go,” Stojkovic said. “That’s why we’re here to help.”UF law students can help solve Gators’ #TaxProblems for free

Professor: Machen ignored diversity
candidates transformed the in-
stitutions they’ve been involved with?” he said.
By not selecting a dean, Ma-
chen will have to temporarily place an interim dean once cur-rent dean Bob Jerry leaves his post in June. 
Machen has proposed UF law 
professor George Dawson as in-terim dean. 
Jeffrey Harrison, a UF law 
professor, said faculty members feel Machen did not consider di-versity the defining factor in his decision-making. 
“I just think he honestly be-
lieved these three candidates were not what we needed regard-less of diversity,” Harrison said. 
After paying a Los Angeles firm $90,000 to narrow down ap-plications to a pool of 24 candi-dates, three were left for Machen  and the Provost to chose from. 
Darren Hutchinson, a UF law 
professor, wrote in an email that Machen’s decision to not select one of the more diverse candi-dates in the search will stunt the growth of the law school.
“President Machen gave up a 
perfect opportunity to move the University of Florida beyond its history of racism and homopho-bia,” Hutchinson said. “Most of the highly regarded public law schools have hired women or minority deans. Doing so signals openness and growth. Rejecting talented and overwhelmingly fa-vorable candidates who could ex-pand diversity signals stagnation and exclusion.”
In the near future, another 
search will be held to find the 
new dean. 
But with Machen soon to leave 
his position as president, law 
professor Pedro Malavet said he is hoping Machen does not stick around for the second search.
“We sent him a list of three 
candidates, and he chose to com-pletely ignore us,” he said. “He decided to not consider them at all, and in process of that rejec-tion, he sent a message that we as an institution are not prepared for diversity.”

It’s a tragedy among startup 
companies: Some spend about three 
months delving full force into their products, emptying their pockets and exhausting their resources. Then, they collapse.
But Florida Tech Toybox Inc., an 
“incubator for startups,” is trying to reverse that process by helping entrepreneurs create viable busi-ness plans and product prototypes for their ideas.
“We don’t think any idea is crazy,” said business manager Jose Hernandez. 
The nonprofit launched a 
crowdfunding campaign Wednes-day to subsidize its setup at the Gainesville Technological Entre-preneurship Center’s business incubator at 2153 SE Hawthorne Road. The $15,000 goal will cover electrical fees and transport of 3-D printers, electron microscopes and other equipment.
“We want to make creativity the 
norm,” said president and founder Mark Davidson, who came up with the idea while working as the asso-ciate director of the Microfabritech research facility at UF. “If we can’t do it, we’ll find the person that can.”
Clients can either pay a mem-
bership fee and use the facilities or contract the help of the staff and interns to prototype the idea.
Diane Daniels chose the second 
option. She contracted Toybox to develop a prototype based on her idea — one that she won’t share for copyright reasons.
With Davidson’s help, she said 
she envisions the product launch-ing successfully within three years.
“Davidson has a mind that’s 
very creative,” she said.THURSDAY, MARCH 20, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

MARATHON, Fla.  — A portion of the historic Seven 
Mile Bridge, a Florida Keys icon, is to be saved for future 
generations after officials Wednesday approved a $77 mil-lion restoration and maintenance program that is to con-tinue for the next 30 years.
The Monroe County Commission approved the project 
to restore and maintain a 2.2-mile segment of the bridge be-tween Marathon and tiny Pigeon Key. The agreement calls for the Florida Department of Transportation to pick up 75 percent of the bill, with 18 percent coming from the county and 7 percent from the City of Marathon.
Gus Pego, FDOT’s District 6 secretary, said some $30 
million are to be spent during initial stages to shore up the 
existing structure. He said he hopes construction can begin 
in about two years.
The span was built more than a century ago when Henry 
Flagler constructed the Florida Keys OverSea Railroad.
In 1938 the bridge was converted for automobiles, and in 
1982, the federal government built a new span. “Old 7” was retired and became a fishing pier and walking area, but the harsh marine environment has taken its toll.
“Almost every major component of the bridge needs to 
be repaired — the substructure, the superstructure and the hand railings — in order to make it safe for pedestrians,” Pego said. 
Today, Pigeon Key, the minuscule island beneath the old 
bridge that once housed about 400 workers who built Fla-gler’s railroad, is a historical and education center. Visitors are transported there via a ferry because the old bridge has been deemed unsafe for motorized vehicles.
“Folks come from all over the world to see this iconic 
structure,” said Monroe County Administrator Roman Gas-tesi. “It’s utilized by more than 100,000 people every year for walking and biking.
”We think it’s a good investment,” he said.Plans to restore

TALLAHASSEE — The Florida 
House continues to advance a bill 
offering in-state tuition to certain undocumented students, and some Gators are in Tallahassee hoping to 
watch it go all the way.
The bill, HB851, would allow 
students, including undocumented 
immigrants, to qualify for in-state tuition if they attend a Florida high school and enroll in college within 24 months of graduation.
On Wednesday, Republicans of-
fered an amendment to create new restrictions on the bill, mandating that students seeking in-state tu-ition attend Florida high schools for four consecutive years instead of the originally suggested three years.
Rep. Jeanette Nuñez, who spon-
sored the amendment, said on the floor the change was necessary.
“This bill will ensure not one le-
gal student of Florida is displaced by an undocumented student,” Nuñez said.
Many pro-immigrant organiza-
tions feel this new amendment plac-es unfair requirements, including Gators for Tuition Equity.
“I agree with the representatives 
that spoke against the amendment and stated, ‘What difference is 12 months going to make?’” said Jo-selin Padron-Rasines, a UF student senator and a member of Gators for Tuition Equity. “This is just another restriction that waters down the bill.”
The group will continue to put 
pressure on the Florida House and 
especially the Senate, where the bill 
is in committee, said the 19-year-old UF political science and internation-al studies sophomore.
A rally is planned today on the steps of the Old Florida Capitol, where elected officials, UF adminis-tration and students from across the state will urge all members of the Legislature to support a fair bill.
“Our message at the rally is to re-
mind legislators why we are push-ing this bill, which is to eliminate barriers to higher education and 
even the playing field for all Florida 
graduates,” said Liana Guerra, a 21-year-old UF economics junior.
Final vote on the bill is scheduled 
for 3:30 p.m. today.

Gainesville Police is investigating the re-
ports of shots fired Tuesday night at a house 
across from Littlewood Elementary School.
No one was hurt, but GPD spokesman Of-
ficer Ben Tobias said officers in the zone are 
keeping an extra eye on the area.
“The school resource officer is very much 
aware of the incident,” Tobias said.Late Tuesday, two cars showed up across 
the street from a house located in the 3400 block of Northwest Eighth Avenue, Tobias 
wrote in an email. 
Eight people got out of the cars and started 
yelling at each other. The argument stemmed from Facebook comments, Tobias said.
The mother who lives in the house sent her 
children inside. While on the phone with 911, the mother said she heard gunshots as the cars drove across her yard.
An officer later stopped one of the cars in 
the 3400 block of Northwest Sixth Street.
All the occupants in the car said they were the ones shot at, Tobias said. Damage to a tail-light looked like it could’ve been a bullet hole, 
but it is not certain if it was caused by a bullet.
Officers didn’t find any shell casings, bullet 
holes or weapons at the scene or in the car.
At the house Tuesday evening, trash was 
scattered on the curb from overturned trash 
cans as a result of the shots. Latosha Fayson, mother of the seven children who live with her in the house, stood outside wearing gray 
sweatpants, a hoodie and a beanie.
Fayson, 36, explained that her son, 17-year-
old Iman Johnson, had recently ended a rela-
tionship with a girl who went to school with him at Gainesville High School. 
Johnson said Wednesday he didn’t believe 
the group was trying to kill anyone, but the shooting served as another threat on top of the ones he received at school and on social me-
dia. He’s staying home from school for a few 
days, he said, but he plans to return soon.
“It’s too much,” Johnson said.  Teen breakup spurs shots fired near elementary school

Florida should ban 
under-16 marriages
A Florida lawmaker made headlines Wednesday when she 
announced her plans to stop marriages in the state from going forward if both partners are younger than 16. 
“Marriage is an adult responsibility,” Stafford told the Flori-
da House Civil Justice Subcommittee, according to the Sun-Sen-
tinel. “We don’t want [children] to vote, we don’t want them to 
drink alcohol, they can’t drive a car — and we allow them to marry under 16?”
The current laws regarding marriage of under-18 persons 
stipulate that minors can be married with parental permission if the couple is expecting or already has a child, both parents are dead or the minors have previously been married. 
Stafford’s proposal to ban marriages for children younger 
than 16, regardless of circumstances, passed unanimously in the 
House Civil Justice Committee on Tuesday without debate. 
This piece of legislation is borne of necessity: In her testimo-
ny before the committee, Stafford said that in 2012, there was 
a 13-year-old groom in Florida. Last year, according to the Or-lando Sentinel, “Florida recorded 110 marriages of children 16 and younger.”
Child marriage is an international human-rights issue. In re-
gions of Africa, South Asia and Latin America, the practice is driven by poverty: Parents see it as a way to secure the ﬁ  nancial 
future of their daughters.
A different kind of pressure drives child marriage in the U.S.: 
societal pressure. That’s why special circumstances are awarded 
to preadolescents who have mothered and fathered infants.
For these teens, however, matrimony isn’t the answer. In a time of serious hormonal and physical changes, marriage 
shouldn’t be on the table. And even for teen parents, marriage isn’t a solution to the problem of raising a baby while struggling with one’s own identity, education and growth. 
Preadolescence is a crucial period in the development of a 
child’s brain. It’s during this time, according to the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, that people begin developing their sense of executive function. “Executive function” describes our capacity to control and coordinate our thoughts and behav-ior, including selective attention and decision making. 
Stafford’s proposal, then, makes sense. It’s not a violation of the civil rights of minors, as some will 
surely argue. The issue of child marriage also goes beyond psy-
chology: Consent comes into question. 
The motive of Stafford’s proposal was Sherry Johnson, 
whose 1972 case in Pinellas County gained national attention 
when she was raped and impregnated at 10 years old. When Sherry was  11, her mother granted permission for the girl to marry her 20-year-old rapist.
Examination of the context and motives of most child-mar-
riage cases makes one thing clear: Legislation is needed to pre-vent minors from getting married, even under special circum-
stances. Stafford’s proposal would be a huge, welcome step in 
preventing marriage for kids who aren’t old enough to drive, vote or drink. Executions leave blood on Scott’s hands
Executions are slowing around the country, but 
leave it to Florida to stand out in the worst way.
Our lovely governor, Rick Scott, has executed 
more people in a single term than any other modern gov-ernor of Florida, according to the Orlando Sentinel.
Since 1976, Florida has ranked fourth in the country 
for the number of executions. According to the Death 
Penalty Information Center, Florida is leading the way in 
2014 with three government-sanctioned murders under its belt — more than any other state.
“It’s a solemn duty to sign a death warrant,” Scott told 
the Sentinel. “People go through the process, and I do 
my job. That’s how it works.’’
Scott is so distraught about his “solemn duty” that he 
signed a bill into law last year making executions easier 
and faster. The Timely Justice Act is a unique bill that 
sets a 30-day deadline for the governor to sign a death 
warrant when an inmate’s appeal is ﬁ  nal. Once the war-rant is signed, the execution happens within 180 days. 
He’s just doing his job. That’s how it works.Florida is no stranger to absurdity, and this is no dif-
ferent. While the Sunshine State puts more people to death than almost every other state, more people are ex-onerated from death row than in any other state.
That means there have been more innocent people 
found on death row than in any other state.
So, for a quick recap: Execution rates are falling 
around the country, but in Florida, they’re increasing. Even though more people are exonerated from death row, we’re speeding up how fast people can be execut-
ed.
Translation: There’s less time for inmates to prove 
their innocence, making it easier for the state to kill 
them.
It’s already easier to put someone to death in Florida. 
It’s the only state that requires a simple jury majority to sentence someone to death. Every other state besides Alabama requires a unanimous vote. 
And it keeps getting worse. 
According to Slate, State Su-preme Court Justice Raoul Can-tero has seen “some of the worst lawyering” in death penalty 
cases. 
One example is of Clemente 
Aguirre, an undocumented immigrant from Honduras 
who worked as a prep cook. He was accused of a bru-tal double murder after he discovered the bodies and 
didn’t call police. Of course, he didn’t call police because 
he feared deportation, but that was enough for a 7-5 vote from the jury sentencing him to death. His original lawyer didn’t investigate much or ask for DNA testing. 
With a new confession being presented as evidence and 
a DNA test proving he wasn’t the killer, he’s waiting on a new ruling to absolve him.
The death penalty is wrong, plus it’s applied incon-
sistently. There are wrongful convictions, and there are 
botched executions. It doesn’t act as a deterrent to violent 
crime, either.  The 2011 FBI Uniform Crime Report found the highest murder rate to be in the South, with more than 80 percent of executions taking place in the region.
There are still 32 states where capital punishment is 
legal, but some exercise the death penalty more than oth-ers. California and Florida combined accounted for half of all executions in 2013, according to the Sentinel. 
Remember that come election time, the blood is on  
Scott’s hands. He has done nothing to stop the Timely Justice Act. What he has done is execute more Floridians than any governor in recent history. But we can’t blame him.
He’s just doing his job. That’s how it works.Justin Jones is a UF journalism senior. His column ap-

SIMFEROPOL — The 
Autonomous Republic of Crimea might not 
remain so autonomous. 
Sunday’s preliminary 
votes showed that the people of Crimea want to assimilate and eventually become 
a part of the Russian Federation.
“I voted for joining Russia because 
of the economic, social and holistically 
political beneﬁ  ts,” Dmitry Polachev said. “It has nothing to do with the 
night terrors I get of Russian soldiers 
invading my hometown, burning my house down, kidnapping my wife and wearing the corpses of my children as 
hats.”
De facto prime minister of Crimea 
Sergey Aksyonov claims he counted 
all the votes by hand himself — twice — and is conﬁ  dent that no errors were 
made in the voting process. 
Behind him, President Vladimir Putin 
sat smiling silently during the interview, 
and he cleared his throat on occasion. 
At the sound of Putin’s trachea self-
ventilating, Aksyonov would whimper, tear up, perspire and then continue speaking with stuttered diction. 
“The United Nations is taking 
serious measures against Russia’s illegal and morally reprehensible military advances on neighboring countries,” said United Nations Secretary-General 
Ban Ki-moon. “We’ve already drafted 
multiple different resolutions all with threats emptier than the UN bank account and promises so false it’ll make North Korea’s propaganda look like the 
unalterable word of God.” 
After the interview, the Secretary-
General went back to his ofﬁ  ce, where 
he kicked his feet onto his desk, watched 
Netﬂ  ix, let his nails dry and gossiped 
with President Barack Obama about how they “can’t believe Kim Jong Un claimed he created that haircut, because the dude from A Flock of Seagulls totally invented it ﬁ  rst.”
Not everybody is critical 
of Putin, however.
Some constituents are actually very 
happy with his policies and practices.
“Czar Putin and I hang out on the 
weekends, play golf and stuff,” a wild brown bear said, between wiping his blood-smeared mouth after eating a deer strangled by Putin himself. “He’s a 
really cool guy. I’m ashamed to hear that 
people claim that he uses intimidation tactics and brute force as a way to occupy territory that’s indisputably not his.”
Meanwhile, in Sochi, the Fifth 
Olympic Ring ﬁ  nally opened up from the 2014 Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony.
“I don’t understand what’s going on 
at all,” Andrei, the Fifth Olympic Ring said. “I know I’m a bit late, but my boyfriend and I were out doing normal things that couples do when together in 
a perfectly consenting relationship and 
having no impact on literally anybody’s way of life whatsoever.”
Before the interview concluded, 
the Fifth Olympic Ring was suddenly 
arrested for “crimes against the state,” 
and he was shipped off to the Gulag to be, according to Russian authorities, “cured by a complex medicine of 
demanding physical work and biweekly 
ﬂ  oggings.”
Meanwhile, Tchaikovsky, a Russian 
nationalist, homosexual composer of famous works like “The Nutcracker,” 
rolled in his grave. 
Additionally, not too far from 
Tchaikovsky’s grave, a homosexual 
Crimean deer wrote his Last Will and 
Testament.

I grew up in the shad-
ows of a hundred churches. 
OK, maybe not liter-
ally, but they say my 
hometown of Keystone 
Heights, Fla., used to hold the world record for most churches in a square mile. 
At a young age, I 
was familiar with the term “the lib-eral media:” a radical group of peo-ple who couldn’t get anything right. 
It sounded like all the newspapers 
were out to get the conservatives, and there was no way of redeeming the situation. The media was a lost cause.
But in college, I made an impor-
tant distinction that began to deﬁ  ne not only the way I see the media but also the way I deal with conﬂ  ict and 
listen to others.
Opinions belong on the opinions 
page. 
I realized the things that typically 
brand newspapers as “liberal” are 
columns or editorials in the opin-ions section. These one-sided pieces are sacred places where people can say whatever the heck they want. 
People are entitled to their opinions. 
You don’t have to agree, but that’s kind of the beauty of it. They still get to talk. 
The opinions section is not to be 
confused with the news section, and that’s where a lot of media consum-ers go amiss. 
The news section is the sacred 
place where opinions are dropped at the threshold and we can discuss things from a nonjudgmental per-spective as adults. We can let both sides talk and hear them out. 
I’m not saying every news writer 
can check his or her biases at the door when writing a news story. Objec-tivity is the point — and the beauty 
— of journalism, even though a lot 
of reporters miss the mark.
With that said, be careful who 
and what you listen to. The voices you listen to will grow to deﬁ  ne you. They can make you bitter, paranoid and resentful, or they can make you better in-formed, wiser and well-
rounded. It all depends 
on how you process what you hear.
My plea to you is to 
ask questions. Please, before you judge a mes-
sage, an article, a speech, a group, a person, ask these questions: Who is saying this? What is the source? Is 
he or she talking about a matter of 
fact or of opinion?
Before you close yourself off 
from someone whom you disagree with, please ask, “What insight can I take away from this?” Because even when you disagree with people, you can still learn something valuable from a discussion.
The liberals aren’t bad, and the 
conservatives aren’t evil. 
They just have opinions and 
share them forcefully. 
It’s our job as media consumers 
to listen to what they say and to re-spond logically before we respond emotionally. 
Every now and then when I visit 
my hometown, I’ll run into an old family friend, and they’ll ask how life in the newspaper business is go-ing. 
“Are you keeping the liberal 
media in check?” they’ll more than likely ask.
When that happens, I just smile 
and I say, “I’m doing my job.” 
Because keeping the liberal me-
dia, or the conservative media or anything else in check isn’t my job. 
My job as a reporter is to ask the 
right questions about the people and information I’m presented with. 
It’s not much different than your 
job as a media consumer. 
Be mindful of the voices you’re 
listening to, and ask the right ques-tions.

These are the tools Rob Kol-
house used as he meticulously painted a 2-foot-tall ceramic cy-borg in his studio. 
Kolhouse is a 37-year-old 
third-year UF ceramics graduate student whose work is on display at the University Gallery off of Northwest 13th Street and Sta-
dium Road. 
The exhibit features works 
from Kolhouse and five other fine 
arts graduate students.
Evan Bryan, a 21-year-old 
chemical engineering senior, works as a clerical assistant at the University Gallery. 
He said the MFA shows are al-
ways interesting to see.
“It’s always a bit hectic be-
cause it’s a high-stress situation for the artist usually,” Bryan said. 
“It’s always a lot of work, but it’s 
always a great show.”
For every thesis exhibit, the graduate student is required to write an extensive thesis and present their work for review.
“My work is all about gender, 
cyborgs, anime, video games, cartoons and all of that pop cul-ture stuff people seem to really dig right now,” Kolhouse said.
Kolhouse said the hardest part 
about preparing for the show is building work that matches the thesis. 
He said a lot of editing is im-
portant in the decision-making process.
Another third-year graduate 
student whose work is featured in the show is 27-year-old Orlan-
do Estrada.
Estrada said he worked every 
day in his studio in preparation 
for the installation of the show.
“My work is about a broad-
ening upon the field of queer theory, and it’s realized through a study of metaphysics,” said the photography student.

A feminized spud may em-
power more young girls than Bar-
bie.
A study done by a pair of re-
searchers at Oregon State Univer-sity found that playing with Bar-bie dolls can affect how girls view their career possibilities. And even though Barbie’s resume in-cludes president, flight attendant and astronaut, Mrs. Potato Head might put her out of the job.
“I wasn’t surprised, unfortu-
nately,” said Jasmine Esmailbe-gui, a 21-year-old UF criminology and psychology senior.
The study’s researchers ex-
plained their findings in an article titled “Boys Can Be Anything: Effect of Barbie Play on Girls’ Career Cognitions,” in which 37 girls from 4 to 7 were randomly assigned a Doctor Barbie, Fash-ion Barbie or Mrs. Potato Head to play with. 
Each girl played with her as-
signed toy and was shown pic-tures of 10 workplaces after. They were asked if they could perform the job that was represented by the setting when they got older and if a boy could perform it when he got older.
Girls who played with Mrs. 
Potato Head thought they could have more of the jobs than the girls who played with either kind of Barbie.
However, the majority of the 
participants thought more of the jobs could be done by boys than girls, even if the job was female-dominated.   
Esmailbegui, who is the direc-
tor of Women’s History Month for the Women’s Student Association,  said because the study’s sample size was so small, she questions how reliable its findings were.
“But, to me, the results line up 
with common sense,” she said.Julie Coutu, a 20-year-old UF 
women’s studies sophomore, said she agrees the sample sizes were small but said it makes sense the girls felt the way they did.
Coutu said although Doctor 
Barbie suggests girls can be doc-tors, she is “still a plastic doll that’s upholding these unrealistic standards of beauty.”
Mrs. Potato Head may be a 
feminized version of an inanimate object, but she said it doesn’t put the same expectations on girls like Barbie does.
Laura Guyer, a senior lecturer 
in UF’s women’s studies depart-ment, said Barbie represents one way society communicates to young girls, and boys have equiv-alents — like G.I. Joe — that estab-lish certain expectations for them as children.
Guyer said she isn’t convinced 
dolls like Barbie or G.I. Joe are the only answer to the societal pres-sure put on children, but she said she does think the study brings up questions worth looking into.
But Esmailbegui said while go-
ing through motions like apply-ing makeup, she wonders where she got the idea she has to look a certain way. Plastic toys like Bar-bie dolls can have an impact, she said, and it can be negative.
Daniella Gennaro, a UF 19-
year-old finance sophomore, said before college she never thought about how she had the possibility to hold positions like an electrical engineer or CEO.
“Women can break what we 
were taught as young girls,” said Gennaro, who is a women’s stud-ies minor.
The study showed that even 
though there are several reasons for the low number of women in certain occupations, one may be the impact of gender roles placed on children.
“You’re never going to be a 
grown-up potato, but you are go-ing to be a grown-up woman,” Coutu said. “And you have no pressure to be a potato, but you do have pressure to be a grown-up woman, and (Barbie) is tell-ing you this is what a grown-up woman looks like.”

outside of the sheets, you need to make sure he’d be into it as well. My guess though, 
honey, is if he wanted you the way you want him, he would’ve wifed you up a long time ago. There’s no guy in the world with legitimate feelings for a girl who would ever be OK with another guy’s hands on her. I’d say if you’re starting to catch those god-awful things 
called feelings, get out now. Just like the oral sex between you two, these feelings will 
not be reciprocated. When he looks at you, he doesn’t see someone he loves waking up next to. He sees someone he enjoys keeping up all night and kicking out in the morning. Face the facts. Either grow a bigger pair of gonads and continue to screw him for the easy release or move on to someone better, because talking to this guy is pretty pointless.

“Supermodel,” Foster the People’s 
sophomore album, dabbles in experimen-
tal instrumentality and philosophical 
lyricism. 
Departing from the mainstream ap-
peal of the previous record, the latest al-
bum succeeds in diversifying the band’s 
sound but fails in creating a memorable 
work.
The casual listener may find less to 
enjoy in Foster the People’s second out-ing. Although some tracks come close 
to matching the catchiness of songs like 
“Pumped Up Kicks,” Mark Foster’s writ-ing takes a more experimental turn on this record. 
Hooks and verses disappear in fa-
vor of often meandering musings. “Ask Yourself” urges the listener to consider their happiness without offering a deeper meaning.
The band’s sound also pursues ex-
perimental instrumentals, composed of ambient electronic beats and shoegazing guitar work. The new direction comple-ments the overarching themes found in Foster’s often cynical lyrics. 
However, like the songwriting, the 
instruments tend to digress. Drums and some guitar work sound muted when jux-taposed with Foster’s dominating voice.
The songs “Coming of 
Age” and “Best Friend” 
stand above the rest for 
balancing the band’s new direction with its proclivity for composing 
catchy tracks. 
“Coming of Age” pon-
ders the implications of emotional matu-
ration with an invigorating chorus. “Best 
Friend” takes a page from disco classics 
as it contrasts a funky beat with a darker subtext about helping friends with drug abuse.
“Supermodel” ends up falling under 
the weight of its own philosophizing. The experimentation fails to register and the band’s strengths get lost in the process. 
At most, the album epitomizes a sopho-
more slump with a few stand-out tracks.Foster the People’s second 
album falls short of supertunes
CODY SMITH

Following a colossal 2013, Pharrell 
Williams continues his pop music dom-
inance with his new album, “Girl.” 
The album finds the singer/produc-
er toning down his often explicit lyri-cism and refining his signature style.  
“Girl” marks a decidedly lighter 
direction for Pharrell. Although many of the songs include innuendos (Phar-rell and Miley Cyrus sing, “You wanna ride it, my motorcycle” in “Come Get It Bae”), the majority of the lyric con-
tent suits the radio and makes for great 
easy listening. 
Lead single “Happy” dominated the 
Billboard charts, and for good reason, with Pharrell urging everyone to clap their hands in a saccharine yet catchy 
anthem.
The album stands apart from other 
pop contemporaries for its rich produc-
tion. Many songs include slick guitar 
licks, crisp synths and popping drum beats. The numerous features also com-plement Pharrell perfectly, with Justin 
Timberlake-assisted “Brand New” and Daft Punk-backed “Gust of Wind” rep-resenting noteworthy stand-outs.
Although the album 
never reaches the often groundbreaking vi-sion of The Neptunes or N.E.R.D, it stands 
above almost every 
pop record of the last 
few years. Pharrell demonstrates a penchant for not only composing de-lightful sing-alongs, but also innovat-
ing in an often dull genre. “Girl” could 
have easily devolved into vapid song-writing, but Pharrell writes cheery, creative lyrics to perfectly complement 
the album’s pop sensibilities.
“Girl” shows how pop records can 
still appeal to everyone without sense-
less pandering. The songwriting and production elevate the album to an ad-
mittedly rare level, one which appeals 
both to the radio and the music junkie.Pharrell debuts ‘Girl,’ brings 
innovation to the pop genre JACKSON HART

“Non-Stop,” a plane murder mys-
tery starring stalwart action hero Liam 
Neeson, delivers all that is expected from a modern-day thriller. Is it tense? Unbe-lievably so. Is it entertaining? Yes. Is it 
smart? Not so much.
The premise is promising enough — 
an anonymous assassin will kill some-
one on this trans-Atlantic ﬂ  ight every 20 minutes unless they are given $150 mil-lion. Where the movie falls apart is its ﬂ  at script, uneven pacing and several huge plot holes that kept this viewer dissatis-ﬁ  ed as the credits rolled.
 The ﬁ  lm starts out with us being in-
troduced to Neeson’s character, Flight Marshal Bill Marks, as he guzzles alcohol before a ﬂ  ight. It is apparent that Marks is haunted by demons of his past, and we expect to see those manifest later in the movie. 
Marks isn’t a ﬂ  eshed-out character, 
and some sloppy late-movie attempts 
at making him one fall ﬂ  at. Perhaps 
Marks’ only sympathetically human mo-ment comes early on when speaking of his daughter to a fellow passenger. The rest of his time seems to be spent rough-ing up random passengers and waving a gun around while stalking down the aisles.
If Marks was a better character — and 
Neeson less plastic in the role — the au-dience might be persuaded to overlook some of the ﬁ  lm’s more glaring ﬂ  aws and plot holes. This, sadly, isn’t the case and is the real reason why the movie doesn’t work. 
 As long as you can suspend your 
expectations of quality characters and a plausible plot, however, “Non-Stop” is actually quite a good escapist ﬁ  lm. The supporting cast members — most of whom seem overqualiﬁ  ed for a movie 
like this — deliver excellent performanc-
es, including a very strong turn from Mi-chelle Dockery (who plays Lady Mary Crawley on “Downton Abbey”).
 It was fun to see familiar faces in 
the crowded plane. Look — there’s Corey Stoll (Peter Russo from “House of Cards”), four-time Oscar nominee Ju-lianne Moore and Scoot McNairy from “Argo.” You’ll even catch a glimpse of recent Oscar winner Lupita Nyong’o, though blink and you’ll miss her .
Walking out of the theater, I thought 
“Non-Stop” had completely met my ex-pectations — no more and no less. The ﬁ  lm was thrilling and entertaining with several strong performances, and for the average moviegoer that will be enough. I give it 2 out of 5 stars.THURSDAY, MARCH 20, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 11

We’re not sure if anything can beat the adorable talking snowman from “Frozen,” but a genius talking dog might come close. Mr. Peabody, an accomplished pooch, uses his time machine to travel with his pal, Sherman. But when Sherman takes the time machine out for a joyride to impress a girl (chicks dig hot rides) he accidentally rips a hole in the universe. If you don’t dig the movie, at least “Frozen” came out on DVD on Tuesday.

Sure, the TV musical comedy might have lost some momentum over the past few seasons (OK, does anyone even watch this anymore?), but for the original fans out there, the 100th episode should bring back some familiar faces. We can’t keep up with the cast of new characters and high school drama, but it will be nice to see Queen Bee Quinn Fabray back in McKinley High halls.

This short video of strangers kissing has taken over the  Internet. It’s cute and awkward  and somehow really interesting to watch. It’s almost like watching a trainwreck of a blind date go down from across the room. If you’ve already seen the original clip, we recommend viewing some parodies, especially Jimmy Fallon’s “First Lick.”

The second annual Fashion for Freedom show, hosted 
at Ingenue Avenue, brought out Gainesville’s most fash-
ionable to raise money for Project Rescue.
More than 40 fashion lovers and supporters partici-
pated in Saturday night’s charity fashion show to raise 
$400 for Project Rescue, which aids and restores victims of sexual slavery through Christ-centered ministry. 
With more than 37 years of service, Project Rescue has 
helped more than 24,000 women and children.
Carla Coultas, the event coordinator, worked to bring 
awareness to Project Rescue while debuting a new collec-tion.
“I have been working on the show in general for three 
months, and there were eight new pieces that went down the runway,” Coultas said.
She presented a women’s line of vibrant dresses that 
were well-received by the audience.
A stunning blue ombré ankle-length sundress took 
center stage of the runway and ﬂ  owed effortlessly. A handcrafted periwinkle gem necklace set off the dress. The neckpiece, which was purposely placed on the model backwards, lengthen the model’s neck while showing the detail on the back of the dress.
“Carla is an extraordinary talent, and I don’t see prob-
lems for her becoming huge in the industry,” says Raven Rose, an attendee at the fashion show. 
The event also featured a children’s clothing designer, 
Lily Tallerico, and jewelry designer, Bobby Fox. 
Coultas’ collection can be seen on facebook.com/Car-
laVioletCoultas. Her pieces will be auctioned off starting at $200, and all of the proceeds will go to Project Rescue.Fashion show raises funds for freedom

With only three new episodes 
of “How I Met Your Mother” left, you’ve probably seen Barney drunk-enly hit on someone for the last time. 
The odds of you seeing Ted go on a 
bad date again are slim. You’re prob-ably not going to see one of Barney’s hookups curse him out again.
We’ll get to see Barney and Rob-
in’s wedding, Ted and The Mother’s ﬁ  rst conversation and a ﬁ  nal scene creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas wrote and ﬁ  lmed in 2006. 
And aside from ﬁ  nding out if the rumors surrounding the possible death of Ted’s wife are true, there are so many oh-so-glorious, downright adorable things to look forward to in 
the ﬁ  nal three episodes. 
Ring bear vs. ring bearer:
We can look forward to the “ring 
bear,” as Barney calls him. No, not 
the ring bearer. The ring bear, which is very possibly a giant, growling, brown bear. 
Barney tells Robin he’s not, and 
yet, we’ve already seen a bear being pulled on chain by a big, hulking dude.
What’s the fake-out?It might be Barney telling Robin 
the “ring bear” is an adorable little boy.Here’s why: Right before Ted 
meets The Mother at the train sta-tion, a woman tells him he looks like he’s coming from a wedding. 
Ted says he doesn’t want to talk 
about it and then launches into a story. The story immediately gets cut off, but we know something happened, and it could be a literal giant bear showing up.
Puking and proposals:Another thing to look forward 
to? A possibly hilarious/kind of gross scene in which Ted throws up, and then The Mother does.
Stay with me. Right before Ted proposes in the 
episode “The Lighthouse,” he asks, “Why couldn’t it have been you here with me two years ago?”
The Mother responds, “That’s 
probably for the best. When you vomit, I vomit. You know that.” 
I’m weirdly 
hoping we get a scene explain-ing this. And al-though it was just a brief conversa-tion, nothing in “How I Met Your Mother” is ever 
unintentional. So maybe we will.
Baby Barney:Next thing to look forward to: 
Barney and Robin having a child? We already know Robin can’t con-ceive, but they could adopt. In fact, a recent episode made 
fans think they did have a baby for a quick second. 
Robin and Barney were in Bue-
nos Aires in 2016, passed out drunk on the ﬂ  oor when they hear a baby cry. Robin picks up the baby and soothes her until she asks, “Whose baby is this?” A woman walks in and tells them their room is across the hall. What does it mean? I say they don’t have their own child at this time, but this is the moment that 
makes them want to. 
For all the super fans, the last 
three episodes of the series should 
hopefully tie up the rest of the loose ends and leave us satisﬁ  ed.

It may be a little more than 
five months until college football 
season begins, but with March 
comes a chance for fans to get a 
glimpse of what their team will look like in the fall. 
Spring football for the Gators 
kicked off Wednesday afternoon in front of a large crowd at the Sanders Practice Fields. 
The 2014 Gators are putting 
last year’s 4-8 season behind them. That starts with switch-ing things up offensively under 
new offensive coordinator Kurt 
Roper.
“Very fundamental in his ap-
proach,” coach Will Muschamp said. 
“Certainly philosophically be-
ing on the same page with me and what we want to do, and that’s be balanced. We’re not going to get 
away from running the football. 
Different ways to run the foot-ball, but I think just a really good teacher and more than anything just a positive guy.”
The tempo of the new of-
fensive scheme is significantly quicker than systems Florida has had under Muschamp, and the players noticed the difference in speed immediately. 
Muschamp said the fast pace had some players burnt out by the end of practice Wednesday afternoon. 
“You can see some fatigue at 
the end of practice when we had that move-the-ball period when we moved the ball down the field,” Muschamp said. “The ex-ecution on both sides really fell 
off. The communication really fell 
off. The focus. There were more busted assignments. That’s what happens when you get tired. Fa-
tigue makes cowards of us all.”
This is the third new offense 
installed during Muschamp’s 
four years in Gainesville. He said getting the system implement-
ed is the highest priority this 
spring. 
“We’ll sit down and make sure 
we’re giving our players enough 
to be successful,” Muschamp 
said. “But we aren’t putting too much on their plate where we’re creating struggles within what we’re trying to do.”
Running backs Mack Brown 
and Kelvin Taylor will carry the load for the running game this spring. Junior Matt Jones, who 
suffered a torn meniscus last sea-
son, will be cleared after spring ball on May 1, and early enrollee Brandon Powell will be out for most of spring with a foot injury 
he had been dealing with in high 
school. Muschamp is confident with the backs fitting into the

The Gators are poised and ready 
for three in a row. 
Florida travels to Alabama today 
with the hope of returning as 2014 
Southeastern Conference champions. 
“That would be incredible; that’d 
be amazing,” coach Rhonda Faehn 
said. “But definitely our focus is not on 
the end result. It’s going to be on go-ing out there, having another positive podium training, getting used to the equipment and carrying that into the 
competition day.” 
The Gators will face three of the nation’s top-10 teams (No. 2 LSU, No. 
4 Alabama and No. 6 Georgia) in the 
eight-team tournament on Saturday, 
including the only team that defeated them in the regular season: the Crim-son Tide. 
No. 1 seed Florida has the advan-
tage of competing in the second of two rounds. The top seed also earns them the advantage of competing the four events in the order it compete them at 
a home meet: vault, uneven bars, bal-
ance beam and finally floor. 
Though the time and order will 
be the same, the equipment will see a 
change. For the first podium meet of 
the year, Florida will travel to the meet site a day earlier to get acclimated to the change of equipment. Gators aim to repeat 
as SEC ChampionsWomEn’S bASkEtbAll

A momentary sense of relief washed over the 
Gators on Monday night. 
With the tournament brackets released on 
ESPN, 11-seed Florida is set to take on No. 6 seed 
Dayton in University Park on Sunday afternoon. 
“As soon as we heard it, the whole room 
erupted,” senior Jaterra Bonds said. “We were all yelling. It was a sense of joy and happiness for all the hard work we put in.
“It’s been a battle, especially with all we’ve 
been through, and our limited numbers. To be in the top five in the best conference in the league and to make it back to the Big Dance for my sec-ond time is just a joyful feeling.”
Now with a set opponent, the Gators are get-
ting back to business. 
The NCAA Tournament offers a fresh start for 
every team, deeming the past season’s wins and losses meaningless. 
“This time, the upperclassmen and the seniors 
step up and show and teach the younger kids what it takes and what it means, and how other teams are going to be pumped,” Bonds said. 
“It’s basically a brand new season. Whatever 
you did in your conference tournament and non-conference really doesn’t matter right now. It’s a whole new mindset that teams bring in because it’s do or die, literally.”
Bonds and fellow senior Lily Svete are the 
only two members of the team who played dur-ing Florida’s tournament run in 2012. 
Both will be leaned heavily upon by the rest 
of the team simply because of their prior experi-ence. 
“It gives you another level 
of experience because you know how it’s going to feel, the expectations,” Bonds said. 
“There’s going to be millions 
of people watching on TV, so it’s just another chance to show the world how great our conference is and how good our team is.”
Having been exposed to that type of environ-
ment is important. Luckily for Florida, it plays in the Southeastern Conference, the toughest con-
ference in the country. 
Two No. 1 seeds in the tournament are from 
the SEC — Tennessee and South Carolina. 
“I think the SEC teams have the biggest ad-
vantage from top to bottom,” redshirt junior 
Kayla Lewis said. UF looks for NCAA redemptionFlorida opens spring practice after disappointing  ‘13 season

“The execution on both 
sides really fell off. The 
communication really fell 
off.”

Quotable
“He needs to eat more.” 
Will Muschamp  
UF coach on DL Alex McCalister’s cramps during practice
scheme.
“They are power guys, and they may elude the 
tackler a different way than making a move, but I 
feel like all the situations created in one-on-one 
matchups, you got to win those one-on-ones.” Mus-champ said.
Roper utilized his tight ends — a much-maligned 
group last year — in his first practice. He lined them up outside several times. 
But at this point in spring, Muschamp made it 
clear to not get too caught up on where personnel are placed. 
“You’re really just kind of trying to teach the of-
fense,” Muschamp said. 
“Then as we move through it, then we will start 
narrowing down positionally of what we’re trying to do with certain guys at certain positions and what fits them best.”  
Notes: Defensive back Nick Washington had sol-
id corner coverage while taking reps with the second 
team, including a pick off of No. 2 quarterback Skyler 
Mornhinweg. ... Kelvin Taylor and Mack Brown both made talented cuts behind the line of scrimmage and hit holes well Wednesday. … Wide receiver Quin-
ton Dunbar made catches while matching up against 
sophomore corner Vernon Hargreaves III and early enrollee Jalen Tabor.  Tabor played mostly second-team corner but took some first-team reps with Har-greaves. … Jay-nard Bostwick took the majority of 
first-team reps at defensive tackle. Bryan Cox Jr. and 
Joey Ivie took reps for first-team defensive end.Faehn said the equipment is slight-
ly different in every event. Because of the elevation, the beam has more of a bounce than normal — as does the floor and vault.  
“That’s why we practice really hold-
ing our finishes and not jumping right to the next movement,” Faehn said. “So there’s all these little adjustments that thankfully our athletes have had experience on it, so they know how to make the quick adjustments once we 
get there.” 
Sophomore Bridget Sloan said she 
prefers competing on podium because 
most pre-collegiate gymnastics used the elevated equipment. 
“Podium just gives you that little 
extra bounce,” Sloan said. “The floor is bouncier, the bars are bouncier, the beam is a little bit shaky sometimes, but 
the vault is bigger. 
“Everything is just bigger and you 
kind of have to really think about con-
trolling yourself.”
Junior Rachel Spicer, who, like Sloan, 
has the experience of competing at an SEC Tournament, said the boot she was seen wearing after UF’s final meet of the regular season is a precautionary 
measure for an injury she sustained at 
the start of the season. 
“It happened at the first meet; I did 
something to my Achilles on vault just maybe landing short,” Spicer said. “It 
just keeps the stress off my Achilles all 
day, and then I come in the gym do my thing and just put it back on.
“It’s kind of like whatever it takes be-
cause, you know, I’ve worked so hard and as long as I know I’m not going to be damaged anymore or anything I’m totally willing to tape it up and do any-
thing for the team.”
Florida’s trip to Alabama is not the 
first and won’t be the last of the season. 
The Gators will return to the Birming-
ham-Jefferson Convention Complex  for 
the NCAA Championship meet April 
18-20. 
“They’re already going to step into 
the arena in the NCAA Champion-ship with knowing exactly the visuals, where they’re going to start, which why they’re going to do their series, which way they’re going to tumble,” Faehn 
said. 
“All of those things that the other 
teams will be figuring out that first day, 
it’ll be just like a warm-up for us.”“It was almost even, anybody could have 
beat anybody. All eight of the teams going in 
are battle tested, have losses and have wins against each other.
“I think we’ll all be confident going in, es-
pecially if we don’t have to play each other again.”
In general, tournament games tend to be 
closer matchups than regular-season games simply because the stakes are so high. 
Bonds and her fellow teammates are ex-
pecting an intense atmosphere come Sunday. 
“You’re not going to see games where 
people get blown out,” she said. “You may not even see games with people winning by 10. There’s going to be games people will win by three, or even one point.
“It’s so much emotion. You don’t know 
what each team is carrying on their shoulders, the motivation that they have. You can’t take anything for granted, not one possession, not anything.”
Although film study has just begun, coach Amanda Butler has some experience against Dayton from her coaching days at Charlotte. 
“I had a chance to coach against Jim Jabir’s 
teams then, and he does an amazing job — re-ally, really good coach,” Butler said. “He’s a guy who recruits players away from people and is always in the top of the league and a postseason contender.”
With the season on the line, Butler will be 
doing everything in her power to ensure her Gators beat the Flyers on Sunday.
“It’s going to be a tough matchup,” she 
said. “You have to hit the fast-forward button in terms of your preparation from a coach’s standpoint. Even though you have some time to prepare, this time of year more than any-time, what you do well has got to be more im-portant than what your opponent does.”

All the Gators have done lately is win. In fact, they haven’t lost 
a game in 2014. 
As No. 1 seed Florida heads into its second-round NCAA 
Tournament matchup against No. 16 seed Albany at 4:10 p.m. 
today in the Amway Center, it brings along a program record 26-game winning streak. The Gators are fresh off an SEC Tournament title and a perfect record in conference play. 
As one of the deepest, most defensively stout groups in college 
basketball, Florida does not have the talent of a Kentucky or a Kansas but has the experience and chemistry to win the South Region and earn a Final Four berth for the ﬁ  rst time since 2007.
This group hasn’t lost since December, and that loss came on 
a Shabazz Napier buzzer-beater — what UF coach Billy Donovan called a “freak play.”
Florida’s senior group has lost three straight times in the Elite 
Eight, so Casey Prather, Scottie Wilbekin, Will Yeguete and Patric Young enter the Big Dance with something to prove. 
During the SEC Tournament, Florida’s bench was inconsistent 
at times. According to the school, freshman point guard Kasey Hill has been practicing through turf toe and is a game-time decision 
for Albany, so Wilbekin might need to shoulder a greater load if it 
becomes a problem for Hill this weekend. No. 8 seed Colorado (23-11, 10-8 Pac-12)

Since star guard Spencer Dinwiddie suffered a torn ACL in 
mid-January, Colorado has not been the same team.
The Buffaloes began the year 14-2 — and were even ranked 
No. 15 in the AP poll at one point — but are 9-9 in the absence 
of Dinwiddie, who was Colorado’s floor general and leading 
scorer. Without Dinwiddie, Colorado has struggled offensively 
and has been prone to scoring droughts.
The Buffaloes are generally a poor three-point shooting 
team with a 32-percent clip, ranking 281st in the country, 
and the loss of Dinwiddie compounded that. 
Although the Buffaloes are on a slide, losing four of their 
past seven games as they head into a matchup with No. 9 
seed Pittsburgh today at 1:40 p.m., they have seen Askia 
Booker emerge in Dinwiddie’s absence. 
The 6-foot-6 junior guard has averaged 14.9 points per 
game since Dinwiddie went down. Booker struggles from three-point range, shooting just 27.6 percent, but he has been Colorado’s most reliable player in crunch time during Pac-12 play. 
When he’s on the floor, Booker takes 30 percent of his 
team’s field-goal attempts. Basically, Colorado’s offense goes 
as Booker goes.No. 16 seed Albany (19-14, 9-7 America East)

Albany is coming fresh off a 71-64 win against Mount St. 
Mary’s on Tuesday night in the NCAA Tournament’s first play-
in game. 
The Great Danes got off to a quick 21-2 run against the 
Mountaineers in the contest’s first 8 ½ minutes but eventually 
let them back into the game by the end of the first half.
The Great Danes normally play at a slow, methodical pace, 
as KenPom.com ranks them 320th in the country in tempo. 
But Florida plays at a similar speed and is only three spots 
ahead of Albany in that category. 
The Great Danes struggle with three-point defense, 
allowing opponents to shoot 35.1 percent from downtown — good for 219th in the country.
Most of Albany’s points are scored in the backcourt. 
Shooting guard Peter Hooley leads the team with 15.8 
points per game, while 5-foot-9 point guard DJ Evans averages 11.5 per contest. 
The Great Danes’ best big man is forward Sam Rowley, 
who averages a team-best 6.9 boards per game.
No. 1 seeds are 116-0 all-time against No. 16 seeds, so 
Albany would have to beat all of the odds to win even one 
game — especially one against the top-ranked team.No. 9 seed Pittsburgh (25-9, 11-7 ACC)

The Panthers have had their ups and down this year. 
During Atlantic Coast Conference play, Pittsburgh handled 
the bottom half of league and even notched a win against 
then-No. 15 UNC, but it struggled against the ACC’s elite. 
Pittsburgh came close against Syracuse at home on Feb. 
12, but ’Cuse guard Tyler Ennis’ 35-foot buzzer beater sunk 
the Panthers’ hopes. In the ACC Tournament semifinals against Virginia, Pitt fell 51-48 but hung with the Cavaliers 
until the final seconds.
Despite falling short of breakthrough wins multiple times, 
Pittsburgh has proven this year that it is an efficient unit on 
both sides of the floor. The Panthers are 18th in the nation in 
adjusted offensive efficiency and 34th in defensive efficiency, 
per KenPom.com.
They are strong on the offensive glass, ranking 19th in the 
country in offensive rebounding percentage.
Senior forward Lamar Patterson has had a breakout year 
for the Panthers, averaging 17.6 points, 4.8 rebounds and 4.3 assists in a team-high 32.6 minutes per game. 
Patterson isn’t incredibly flashy, but the seasoned 6-foot-5 
wing can play multiple positions and exploits defensive 
mismatches well.JONATHAN CZUPRYN

Today, No. 1 seed Florida will begin 
what Joakim Noah once called the “purest 
form of sports:” the NCAA Tournament.
But this year’s Gators squad (32-2) — 
which will face No. 16 seed Albany Great Danes (19-14) at 4:10 p.m. in Orlando — has heard enough of Noah. They’ve heard 
enough of Al Horford, Corey Brewer and 
Lee Humphrey, too.
After every win, after every record bro-
ken and after every rise in the rankings, the Gators have been bombarded with com-
parisons to the 2007 national championship 
squad.
News ﬂ  ash: This is a different team. For the ﬁ  rst time in the program’s 95 
years, Florida has a 26-game win streak and counting. For the ﬁ  rst time in the Southeast-ern Conference’s 82-year history, a school emerged unscathed from an 18-game league schedule — or 21, if you count the confer-
ence tournament. 
And no matter what this year’s group 
does over the next three weeks, the banners 
hanging from the O’Connell Center rafters 
will still be there. No matter how many 
comparisons you make, the facts are that those are artifacts from the past, and it’s impossible to determine the Gators’ future from their history.
Not only is coach Billy Donovan not wor-
ried about his past team’s accomplishments, but he also isn’t even concerned with what Florida has done during the regular season.
“Now that the seeding is set, the only 
thing that matters is playing well and put-ting yourself in a position to win and ad-vance,” Donovan said. “We’re excited for another opportunity to play but the No. 1 seed, the overall seed, whatever it is, is 
great. But that’s probably a reﬂ  ection of 
what’s happened from November all the way to here in March.”
Although a No. 16 seed has not upset 
a No. 1 seed since the NCAA Tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985, the Gators aren’t taking anything for granted when they face off against the Great Danes. 
In its 71-64 win over Mount St. Mary’s 
in the play-in game Tuesday night, Albany knocked down 27 of its 47 shots, with only two of those made ﬁ  eld goals coming from beyond the three-point arc.
The Great Danes jumped out to a 21-2 
lead over the Mountaineers on 9-of-14 shooting. However, Albany then made just 1 of 6 ﬁ  eld goals immediately following its run to allow Mount St. Mary’s to go on a 
24-4 stretch of its own.
Scottie Wilbekin said once teams enter 
a one-and-done scenario like the NCAA 
Tournament, all it takes is 40 minutes of good basketball to force an upset.
“Coach D really does a good job of re-
minding us that no matter what the rank-ings are, every year there’s upsets and so it really doesn’t matter once the ball goes up,” the senior point guard said. “Anything 
can happen. Anybody can beat anybody, 
so we’ve got to be on our toes no matter what.”
Casey Prather took his teammate’s an-
swer one step further when talking about Albany’s chances at taking down No. 1 seed Florida.
“They deﬁ  nitely can beat us,” Prather 
said. 
“They’re a good team.”Despite what the players say, the Gators 
are 21.5-point favorites to advance to the Round of 32 where they would face the win-ner of Colorado-Pittsburgh on Saturday. 
If Florida were to continue its run in 
the South Region, it would have an oppor-
tunity for a rematch against Kansas in the 
Elite Eight. When the Jayhawks visited the 
O’Connell Center on Dec. 10, the Gators 
were coming off a buzzer-beater loss to UConn but rebounded strong with a 67-61 victory, which kicked off their 26-game win streak.
The Elite Eight has meant the end of 
the road for Florida the past three years. Overcoming the obstacle would result in Donovan’s ﬁ  rst Final Four appearance since 
2007.
However, just as Donovan isn’t looking 
backward or forward for answers, neither 
are his seniors.
“As far as what happened those last three 
years, I don’t know and to be honest I don’t really care because we’re not thinking about that,” Wilbekin said. 
“Nobody on our team or on the coach-
ing staff is thinking about the last couple of years. It might be cliché, but all we think about is the next game.”
But, as Donovan said, all good teams 
have attributes in common with one anoth-
er no matter how many years separate their 
success. So, naturally, comparisons will be made with the 2007 team that captivated the country.
And even that squad wasn’t able to avoid 
the discussions of living up to the previous 
year’s standard and the pressure of repeat-
ing as national champions. 
“Those conversations, they either take 
you into the past and get you hung up on 
statistics, or they take you into the future,” 
Donovan said on March 12, 2007 — just four days prior to beginning Florida’s last title run. “Right now, the most important thing is that our guys are focused on the pres-
ent.”
Seven years later, and some things never 
change.Road to the Final Four

“As far as what happened those 
last three years, I don’t know and to 
be honest I don’t really care because 
we’re not thinking about that.”
Scottie Wilbekin
UF point guardEnjoy this, Gators fans.
It’s not often a team 
comes around that is as 
good as this Florida team. 
At most, you’ve got six 
games left to enjoy this group 
before a major chunk of them departs for the NBA, the D-League or some other pro-fessional league — this team doesn’t have a Corey Brewer, Al Horford or Joakim Noah who is going to be selected early in the draft lottery.
After that, this group of seniors — the 
“Oh-10s,” if you will — leaves and will and fade into relative obscurity.
I say relative because they’re not going 
to be forgotten. No one is going to be ask-ing, “Who is that Patric Young guy?” on the UF campus next January. But their legacy isn’t coming as individuals, barring any un-foreseen NCAA Tournament domination or NBA superstardom.
The 2013-14 squad isn’t Patric Young and 
Company, or the Scottie Wilbekin Project or the Casey Prather Show.
In a way, they remind me of the New 
York Yankees of the late 1990s.
That team had stars, but there was so much talent around the big names.
Yes, Derek Jeter was the 
darling of New York, but while Jeter was great, there 
were a dozen other players 
playing great who didn’t get the same attention — guys like Bernie Williams, Paul O’Neill and Tino Martinez.
There was a quote about the record-
setting 1998 Yankees — I don’t remember who said it, and a Google search failed me — which said there was a new star every 
night. The Gators are the same way.
In any one game, Young may dominate, 
Michael Frazier II may go off from three or 
Wilbekin might shut down an offense.
Cherish that because a team with that 
ability doesn’t come around a lot. 
Florida has a stellar base to move for-
ward with after these seniors leave — Fra-zier and Dorian Finney-Smith will be back, 
and freshmen Kasey Hill and Chris Walker 
are supremely talented and should return — but that doesn’t guarantee anything.
This could be as good as it gets. Make 
sure you soak it all in because it doesn’t hap-pen every day.18, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, MARCH 20, 2014
