SPECIAL REPORT
Stolen laptop contained
Stands medical records
By KATHERINE BEIN
Alligator Staff Writer
Shands at UF sent notification letters to
about 12,500 people Monday warning them
that a laptop containing their personal and
medical information was stolen Jan. 27.
According to a press release from Shands,
an employee had uploaded the information
onto his home laptop for work-related pur-
poses.
The laptop held information about patients
referred to the gastroenterology clinical servic-
es department over the last three years.
Included were names, addresses, medical
record numbers, and in the case of 650 patients,
Social Security numbers, according to the re-"We have a fair amount of success
.with other burglaries."

lease. It is unclear whether the information was
accessed. Shands launched an internal investi-
gation, and the Gainesville Police Department
is also investigating the theft.
"We have a fair amount of success .with
other burglaries," GPD Capt. Ed Book said.
Shands leaders have launched system-wide
encryption to prevent similar crime.

toring. Call 877-740-6995 for more information.New SG officers
may push union
U IT WOULD COST $90M.
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Writer
Although students voted against the
renovation and expansion of the Reitz
Union, a new union may still be on the
horizon.
With 56 percent of students voting
against funding repairs and 55 percent
voting against funding the expansion,
the project probably won't move as
quickly as advocates hoped.
Student Body president-elect Ashton
Charles said the project is a priority for
her as she prepares to take office in May.
She maintained that she would do her
best to represent student opinions.
Charles said Student Government
will explore different options for fund-
ing, including the Capital Improvement
Trust Fund, a fund to which all Florida
public university students contribute.
Eddie Daniels, executive director of
the Reitz Union, said the union still has
needs that must be met like maintenance
and capacity issues.
He said he favors renovation and ex-
pansion because it would be more cost-
effective than repair in the long run.
Ryan Moseley, the Renew Your Re-itz committee chairman, said the Renew
Your Reitz campaigners were pleased
with the results from the vote consider-
ing the short amount of time they had
to promote the union's renovations and
expansions.
"This campaign should have been a
six-month campaign," he said.
According to Student Body President
Jordan Johnson, a student fee would
cover about $60 million of the $90 mil-
lion project.
Bret Seferian, bargaining committee
chairman for Gradu-
ate Assistants United,
said he would be sur-
prised if Johnson tried
to push too hard for
the fee.
"It would be a
shame if he tried to
ICharles force something on
the students they
don't want," he said. "What's the point
of a referendum?"
Student Alliance party leader Ben
Cavataro said he feels advocates for the
project are ignoring students because
they didn't get the result they wanted.
"I think the whole point of democ-
racy is that you're supposed to listen to
people," he said. "Right now, those in
charge are completely out of touch."
Carl Hiaasen to speak
By ALEX ORLANDO
Alligator Contributing Writer
When Carl Hiaasen visits UF to-
night, he will be speaking off the top
of his head.
Hiaasen, a UF alumnus, award-
winning journalist and best-selling
author, hasn't selected a specific topic
to discuss and instead will be speak-
ing on events of the day, according to a
press release.
"He always has thought-provoking
things to say about the state of the
state," said Vicki Gervickas, communi-
cations director of the Graham Center
for Public Service. "He's kind of en-titled to."
Hiaasen started as a general as-
signment writer at The Miami Herald
when he was 23 and joined the Her-
ald's prize-winning investigations
team, according to a press release.
Gervickas said Hiaasen was per-
sonally invited by Bob
On Graham to speak at UFCampuS and will not be paid for
his appearance.
The event is sold out, but students
without tickets can watch the event
streamed live from the Ocora Room
at Pugh Hall on the Graham Center's
Web site at bobgrahamcenter.ufl.edu.
The event begins at 7 p.m.

The 'CensUS'
wants you!
Dear students:
The University of Florida is well
known for prestige in academics and
athletics,
and now
it's your
chance to + ME
continue
this 
-
success
by participating in the 2010 Census.
The census information provides
more than $400 billion in federal
funding each year for the next 10
years. This funding goes toward
transportation, education, health care
and more. The census also determines
the number of seats each state has in
the U.S. House of Representatives.
Hopefully you are familiar with
the "You+Me=CensUS" campaign.
This is part of an awareness campaign
by the 2010 UF Bateman Team,
UF Administration and UF Student
Government.
The 10-question
census will arrive
in mailboxes in
March. Each
off-campus
household
should fill out The census I
a single form allocate fundi
and mail it back local bhus
by April 1. Campus
residents will receive
instructions from their facilities' staff.
You will not be included on your
parents' form unless your full-time
residence as of April 1 is with your
parents.
It's essential everyone participate
so that the city and The Gator
Nation receive deserved funding. For
more information, visit

ng
S.8 million viewers
watched the
Gainesville
"Extreme Makeover"
show.
It was 8 p.m. on a Sunday and Ryan McGinn and Aaron Wilbur were sitting three rows back from
the large screen amid 150 other people. They are catered hors d'oeuvres and wore their blue "Extreme
Makeover: Home Edition" T-shirts once more.
The two friends, students at the University of Florida College of Design, Construction and
Planning, previously volunteered their time as production assistants for "Extreme Makeover" during
its Gainesville shoot in December.
Their job was to make sure everything ran smoothly. They moved furniture, unpacked trailers and
dealt with catering -all while wearing headsets that Wilbur professed were "just like the FBI."
On Feb. 21, they donned their blue shirts for the viewing party at the Gainesville Woman's Club,
to see the final product of their toils. They watched both a "behind-the-scenes" video and the
main TV show.
McGinn, a master's student studying architecture, and Wilburn, a senior in landscape
architecture, said that the episode did a good job of portraying what happened on set.
"I think they really trimmed the fat," McGinn said. "But you're not going to want to sit
s through every phase of construction. They touched on all the highlights."
for Christopher Silver, dean of the College of Design, Construction and Planning, said the
"Extreme Makeover" experience was "just another example of our students contributing to the
community as they hone their skills in shaping the built environment."
Attending the viewing party and seeing the people they had worked with, and of course watching
the episode, was a bit of a "last hurrah" for the students.
"It was the last step in the entire process," Wilbur said. "It was fun to see that, but it was also the
end of the entire build. It had been over for a little while but it almost didn't feel done because it (the
show) hadn't aired yet."
McGinn added, "It was fun to be there, and fun being with the family to see their reactions to the
show."

Local pedestrian safety to be promoted
"High Visibility Enforcement," a campaign
to promote pedestrian safety on the University of
Florida campus and within Alachua County, is being
coordinated by the Gainesville Police Department,
University of Florida, Alachua County Sheriff's Office
and several other groups.
To increase visibility for drivers, additional pavement
markings and signs have been placed in various
pedestrian crossings throughout the county.
Officers will emphasize traffic enforcement for the
next several months, with a specific focus during April,
July and November. Currently, warnings are generally
given to violators of pedestrian traffic rules.
Pedestrians may be ticketed for jaywalking and
crossing during the "Do Not Walk" phase of a light
cycle.

Student designs, sells bracelets to benefit Africans
By KATHRYN STOLARZ
Alligator Contributing Writer
Alexa Carlin has big dreams of
becoming a fashion entrepreneur,
but she had to start out small.
Carlin, a UF business freshman,
began selling bedazzled jean brace-
lets in ninth grade, but she added a
hefty jewel to her belt when she be-
came the youngest designer and the
first to sell jewelry for L.A.-based
fashion company OmniPeace.
"She is an extraordinary girl
who found something that tugged
at her heart strings, and she actu-
ally followed through with it," said
OmniPeace founder Mary Fanaro.
OmniPeace, which sells every-
thing from T-
Community shirts and hand-Outreach bags to yoga mats
and chocolate
bars, donates 25 percent of its prof-
its toward ending extreme poverty
in Africa by 2025 and support-
ing peace, education and human
rights.
Celebrities such as Jennifer An-
iston, Lindsay Lohan and Zac Efron
sport the company logo -an im-
age of Africa with five fingers com-
ing out from the top, two of which
form a V to represent peace.
Carlin, of Wellington, Fla., has
sold more than 300 bracelets and
donates 10 percent of the sales to
the company. So far, she has do-
nated $500.
The bracelets. which come inred, yellow, green and black, con-
sist of a thin satin band and a dan-
gling chrome charm with the com-
pany's logo.
She discovered the company
when she bought an OmniPeace T-
shirt from dELiA*s Inc. in the sum-mer of 2008. She started researching
the company and was touched by
the organization's philanthropy.
Carlin pitched her bracelet de-
sign to OmniPeace in the summer
of 2008 when she noticed the then-
3-year-old company didn't selljewelry.
"OmniPeace's name was just
getting out, so I thought it was a
great opportunity for me to become
a part of this amazing movement,"
Carlin said.
Fanaro said she had been ap-
Alexa Carlin poses with OmniPeace merchandise in her dorm Monday afternoon.

Gom I Vspreached by a few jewelry manu-
facturers but didn't like their de-
signs. When Carlin approached
her, though, she was sold.
Carlin sells the bracelets for $10
through her Web site at helloper-
fect.com, on OmniPeace's Web site
at OmniPeace.com and from her
UF dorm. She has received orders
from around the world, including
Canada, Mexico, Israel, the United
Kingdom, China and Taiwan. Her
bracelets are also sold in boutiques
in Arizona and Maryland.
Carlin uses her middle name,
Rose, on the tag, because she has
always said this would be her label
if she got into the fashion industry.
UF English sophomore Brit-
tany Holtz bought a green bracelet
last fall, after Carlin made an an-
nouncement to her sorority.
"It's a really good cause, and
they're cute too, so it was a win-
win situation," Holtz said.
She never takes it off because it's
comfortable and small enough that
it won't clash with anything, she
said. She even sleeps with it on.
Carlin plans to start an Omni-
Peace club at UF in the fall and is
looking for a sponsor.
Although OmniPeace has no
immediate plans to make more
jewelry, Fanaro said if Carlin ap-
proached her with another idea,
she would be open to it.
"I have numerous designs, and
I'm just finalizing what my next
product will be. Most likely it will
be a necklace," Carlin said.
Live Long & Prosper.

house
0 THEY WILL COMPETE
AGAINST 18 TEAMS.
By MEREDITH RUTLAND
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF students and faculty are mak-
ing the ultimate "green" house, but
it won't stay at UF for long.
A group representing four UF
departments is building a solar-
powered house for an international
sustainability competition spon-
sored by the U.S. Department of
Energy.
At the Solar Decathlon Europe
competition, 19 university teams
from around the world will be
judged in 10 categories including
architecture, engineering and sale
value of the building, said Laura Et-
tedgui, the team's spokeswoman.
"I think we have a really strong
submission to the competition," Et-
tedgui said.
The team will compete in mid-
June in Madrid. The team's build-
ing, which Ettedgui said looks like
a cross between a classic Florida
cracker house and a trailer, will be
finished in late March.
It will then be taken apart, placed
in four crates
Spotlight on the and shipped
Swamp by boat to
Madrid,
where the team will have 10 weeks
to reconstruct it in time for judging.
The building and shipment of the
house will cost $800,000. The DOE
donated $100,000, and the rest of
the money came from private dona-
tions.
Christopher Sorce, the team's
project manager and an architecture
graduate student, said the roughly
600-square-foot building will be
powered entirely by solar panels on
the roof and cylindrical tubes on the
walls, which absorb sunlight from
all angles. He said the best part of
making the house was working with
students from different majors.
Ettedgui said students studying
business, sustainability, engineer-
ing, architecture, building construc-
tion and interior design found a
common cause in the project.
"Sustainability is pretty power-
ful, and we all believe in it," she
said.
The competition gives students a
chance to work on a full-scale proj-
ect, something they rarely get to do
in the classroom, Ettedgui said.
She said it is far better than the
paper models she constructs in her
architecture classes.
"That doesn't compare to actu-
ally building a house in real life,"
she said.

Going in Circles
Screaming matches will
get you nowhere
he "Islam is of the Devil" people found themselves on
Turlington Plaza Monday, and they got just what they
wanted -attention. Some people come to Turlingon
wanting to have conversations, others just want to inflame
and hear the sound of their own voices.
We hate walking through Turlington Plaza, almost late for
class and getting accosted by people when we're clearly wear-
ing our iPod headphones -the universal symbol for "Don't
bother me."
But we get even more incensed when we have to sidestep
the huge crowd of people congregating around someone yell-
ing about whatever sin we've committed in the past 10 min-
utes and the college student with whom he or she is arguing
at max volume.
Please understand, we know a "free speech zone" doesn't
mean you only get to hear what you want to hear.
Turlington is an area for everyone to say how he or she
feels, and if we squabble with that, we're defeating the pur-
pose.
But here's the deal: If you see someone on the plaza exer-
cising his or her free speech rights and you want to debate, go
right ahead.
But screaming from the top of the staircase or across the
plaza will not help the situation. Yelling doesn't make your
point any more valid. Talking loudest is not equivalent to be-
ing right.
Debate is one thing. Thursday we saw a man with a sign
strapped to his chest reading "You need Jesus; it's hell without
him" and prepared for the worst.
But when two students came up to him, they all spoke at
a normal volume, which did not disturb the people around
them. However, a woman across the plaza began yelling and
walking in circles while a student some 10 yards away shout-
ed back, "Shut up! Go home!"
We got out of there before a giant circle could form.
Don't get us wrong. We think these people have every right
to be here. We'll fight to protect more extreme speech -it
gives more First Amendment room for reasonable discourse.
It's just that this is an institution of higher learning. Part of
UF's mission should be to provide a place where ideas can be
intelligently discussed, debated and critiqued. We wish these
guests on our campus -who have every right to be here -
would try to fit in and contribute to that kind of environment.
Not only would this approach lead to a less hostile environ-
ment on the plaza, but we're guessing students would actually
get more out of these messages if they were presented in a way
that didn't cause them to tune out.
We can't implore the screamers to change their ways; that's
what they come here to do. But the students of the school
should understand that screaming back won't deter them.
If anything, they'll just yell louder. Healthy debate and dis-
course is the nice side of the free speech zone, but don't make
the bad side worse.
When a group of students forms a circle around a shout-
ing match, they're not looking for intelligent comebacks, and
they're not looking for answers.
They're merely watching to see what will happen, and that
doesn't make you look any better than your opponent.
We can't agree with everything being said on Turlington
Plaza, but it's easy to tell the difference between people who
want to converse, and even the people who want to argue, and
those who just want to plant their feet on the ground and hol-
ler.
We feel that the best way to deal with these individuals is
to avoid adding fuel to the fire and just turn up your iPods.

Web documentation desensitizes us
Are we fostering a "culture of personal documenta-
tion" -that is, a culture in which we must record,
document and publicize the events in our lives in-
stead of merely experiencing them?
If it's happening, we certainly have the right tools and
technology for it. Digital cameras and memory cards are
cheap enough that most anybody who really wants one can
get one, or they already own a device that has a digital cam-
era built into it. Many people have cell phones and service
plans that allow texted status updates, video recording and
picture uploading, and smartphones are common enough to
do more involved Web 2.0-y stuff. And social networking
has hit a sort of critical mass where pretty much everybody's
on Facebook, so there's an automatic, built-in audience for
putting your life on display.
And at least anecdotally, events that probably would oth-
erwise be too mundane or unremarkable to warrant bring-
ing along a camera a decade or so ago (grabbing dinner with
friends, going to the mall) are now thoroughly photographed
and commented upon. In some ways, it can feel like an event
only "counts" -it only really happened, or it's only worthy
of acknowledgment -if there's some documentary proof
of it, even if such proof comes in the form of a T9-assisted,
"Having a great night!" Facebook status.
I know that this is the part where I'm supposed to roll
my eyes and bemoan the shallow lameness of our exhibition-
ist/voyeuristic generation, but I don't think that's fair. Obvi-
ously, not everybody is assiduously publishing every minor
detail of his or her lives, and even those who are doing so
aren't necessarily shallow or lame. They could, for instance,
find it a very comforting form of self-expression, or they just
really want their friends and family in the loop about what's
going on in their lives.
For example, say what you want about the silliness of
Twitter, but when you haven't seen someone you love in a
while, getting a sense of how their day is going -even ifJoe Dellosa
letters@ali gator orgit is just a series of tweets complain-
ing about how their professor's beard
looks like a drowned possum -is ut-
terly smile-inducing. But what's more
interesting about this for me is not just
if a culture of personal documentation
exists -it's whether such a culture is
changing the way we live our lives.
That's certainly true in a superficial
way: If you know you're probably go-
ing to be photographed when you go out, you might con-
sider wearing a shirt that wasn't given to you for free by a
predatory credit card company. Or you might shave a little
bit more often. Or you might wear a little bit more makeup
than you otherwise would.
It's also true in terms of what we actually do with our
lives, though. Certain activities lend themselves to photogra-
phy more than others, and some make for a more awesome-
sounding blog post. If there's an added consideration of,
"What will sound cool later?" as opposed to just, "What do
I want to do?" when deciding how to spend your time, it
would directly influence our perception of what activities are
more worthwhile. And the mind reels at how many people
got "In a Relationship" just for the News Feed entry.
That's a shame because the most meaningful moments
make for a bad profile photo, and not just in a "violation
of the Terms of Service" sort of way. Moments of tentative,
hopeful connections, of quiet surprise over a shared secret, of
affectionate inside jokes aren't really the sort of thing that a
lot of people deem Facebook-worthy.
I promise I'm not a Luddite, nor do I think our generation
has really gone all that crazy with this stuff. But I'm just a
little worried about what happens when we place our lives
constantly on a digital stage, performing for all to see.

Guest column
Partisanship plaguIt's more widespread than Olympic fever. It's more of a
heath risk than HINI.
It is fatal.
It has been known to resort to coercive tactics.
It is perhaps the single most dire issue plaguing Ameri-
can politics today.
No, it's not Scott Brown's Cosmopolitan centerfold -it's
partisanship.
Regardless of whether or not the recent White House
health care summit was a real attempt at compromise and
bipartisanship or simply a rhetorical strategy for courting
re-election votes, hyper-partisanship can be seen at every
level of the modern governmental system in the United
States.
But it's not just elected officials -seen a town hall
meeting lately?
In one case on the news, a group of citizens, whether
they were planted by the opposition or not, booed a dis-
abled woman discussing her debilitating autoimmune
disease and her inability to pay her astronomical medical
bills.
Other cases involve riotous groups participating in
verbal assault and others in actual assault (go ahead and
YouTube it).
Who's to fix this problem?
Over the weekend, I traveled to Harvard Univer-
sity along with 40 other student leaders from across thees US political system, personal lives
Brittany Fox country to engage in a conference
Speaking Out on public leadership, and we were
asked the same question I'm asking
in this column.
Though it was suggested that citizens have individual
responsibility in the matter, it was the majority opinion
that the task went to the leaders of our political world,
both in the media as well as in public office.
By setting the example, leaders can show citizens that
while political dialogue is paramount to everything our
nation stands for, it can be and must be done with respect
toward the other party involved.
What's more, while "talking heads" and angry pundits
are acceptable terms to use under free press, it may not
showcase the rational side of any debate as often as pos-
sible.
And average citizens, whether conscious of it or not,
are showing the side effects.
While in Boston Saturday evening, I was accosted
against a dark alley wall as if on Frank Costello's hit list.
This attack was not by the Irish mob, but by the three
of the above-mentioned student leaders hailing from three
distinct state universities.
It turns out I was on a hit list -not as a dirty snitch,
but as a Republican.
Upon their learning of this egregious error, I was ques-
tioned, interrogated, interrupted and forced to explain therationale behind my political preferences.
Then I was blamed for ruining America's chance at
health care.
Not once was it asked if I even agreed with the Repub-
lican viewpoint in Washington -it was assumed. All this
during a conference on political civility.
To put it in perspective, the conference seminar earlier
in the day had been on negotiation and mediation.
Later in the afternoon, there was a session on team
building.
The final topic discussed the morning after the inci-
dent: the need for civility in politics.
Here's to hoping the three unnamed assailants took
home more than a souvenir.
Drawing from their prior behavior, I lean toward the
side of not.
Does this mean that even with three days of training
on leadership, ethics and responsible politics, civil debate
and bipartisanship between parties are impossible?
Perhaps it proves citizens, not leaders, are the ones to
set the example for one another.
If this is the case, let us remember lessons learned in
our primary school days: Listen when someone has the
floor, treat people the way you want to be treated, keep
your hands to yourself and have some respect.
A little goes a long way.

Center to offer help session for Chilean students
By CRISTINA RABAZA
Alligator Contributing Writer
The earthquake in Chile has not yet
sparked the student-led relief efforts seen in
the aftermath of the Haiti earthquake.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando spoke
with the Center for Student Activities andInvolvement and said students have not
planned a relief campaign.
"It's a very different situation from
Haiti," Orlando said. "Chile is not a Third
World developing nation like Haiti. Chile
has the money and resources and the ability
to deal with it."
UF's International Center will offer an in-formation session to help Chilean students
and give them an opportunity to address
their concerns, said Debra An-
On derson, the coordinator of In-Campus temational Student Services.
The Chilean population at
UF is comprised of 24 students and eight
visiting faculty and/or H-lB visa holders,she said.
According to U.S. Citizen and Immigra-
tion Services, some U.S. employers use the
H-lB visa to employ foreign workers in spe-
cialty occupations.
Anderson wrote in an e-mail that the ses-
sion will take place at the Counseling Center
in Peabody Hall at 5 p.m. on Wednesday.

Event talks about sex
By ANDREW PANTAZI
Alligator Contributing Writer
Fake orgasms, free condoms and sex
jeopardy were all tools used to arouse UF
students' interest in awareness about sexu-
al issues in Anderson Hall Monday night.
About 25 students attended the Let's
Talk About Sex forum sponsored by Glob-
al Empowerment, a UF service organiza-
tion.
"You have the whole stigma of college
where everyone is going crazy and having
sex," said Lauren Taylor, a UF biology ju-
nior and the vice president of Global Em-
powerment. "But if you're going to have
sex, then you need to have smart sex."
The discussion also covered sexting,
with Jessica Moscoso, a UF criminology
and political science sophomore, giving a
humorous speech.
Moscoso said sexting promotes sex as
the basis of relationships. She said parentsneed to focus on the role of new technolo-
gy in relationships rather than continuing
to give the same "birds and bees" talk.
"I mean everyone knows how to put on
a condom thanks to things like basic cable
and bananas," Moscoso said.
"But if you're going to have sex,
then you need to have smart
sex."
Lauren Taylor
UFjunior
Cecilia Printy, a family, youth and
community sciences sophomore, came to
the event because she is passionate about
sexual education issues, particularly ones
like sexting, that affect younger people.
"Sexting allows kids to get involved
with the opposite sex earlier, and so I'm
glad that I didn't get a phone until I'm Global Empowerment members Kevin Davis (left)

City suffers cuts
* THE BUDGET COULD FALL
BY $5.6M.
ByCJ PRUNER
Alligator Staff Writer
A memo released to Gainesville
city employees Monday has depart-
ments scrambling to find solutions
to anticipated budget cuts.
The memo, which the Office
of the City Manager distributed
electronically, requested city de-
partments submit plans, to the city
manager s office to accommodate a
15 percent budget reduction in the
respective departments.
According to Gina Hawkins, a
spokeswoman with the Gainesville
PublicWorks Department, the memo
was one of at least a dozen updates
since July 2009 from the City Man-
ager's office about the 2009-2010 and
2011-2012 fiscal periods.
But loomingbudget cuts arenoth-
ing new to Gainesville. The city has
undergone about $10 million in cuts
over the past three years, according
to city spokesman Bob Woods.
For the 2011 fiscal year, Woods
said the city is looking at a $5.6 mil-lion deficit with the 2012 figures ex-
pected to hit a $6.9 million deficit.
However, Woods reiterated the
plans were not final and that some
departments may not have to make
15 percent reductions. The plans are
part of what Woods described as an
exhaustive process that he estimated
could continue until late June when
City Manager Russ Blackburn sub-
mits his recommendations.
Woods said it's too early to tell if
certain agencies will have to make
budget cuts that sur-
Local pass 15 percent.
News But for agencies
such as the Gainesville
Police Department, a 15 percent re-
duction would be a multi-million
dollar setback.
According to GPD spokesman
Capt. Ed Book, a 15 percent cut
would amount to $3.9 million of the
GPD budget.
Book said GPD Chief Tony Jones
is currently working on the GPD
plan, which should be ready to
present to the City Manager's of-
fice either Thursday or Friday. GPD
is hopeful the city commission will
place a high priority in public safety
when it's deciding its budget cuts.

Tampa man to auction gator bike to help wildlife
* HE SPENT 1,000 HOURS
BUILDING THE MOTORCYCLE.
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Writer
This gator is bigger than Tim
Tebow, faster than Percy Harvin
and louder than the Pouncey twins.
But it doesn't run in The Swamp
-the place UF football players call
home. This gator does not spend
time in real swamps, either.
An engine rests underneath its
scales, a wheel sits below its tail
and handlebars stick out from both
sides of its head. With a few modifi-
cations, this reptile has transformed
into a street chopper.
Wildlife Rehabilitation of Her-
nando owner Jim Jablon, 45, wanted
to raise money for his organization
when he conceived the idea for
GatorBike, a 10.5-foot motorcycle
wrapped in alligator hide.
"It's a work of art," Jablon said.
"It's beautiful. If you saw it, you'd
want it."
Those interested in GatorBike
will have a chance to win it at

ing tournament at Gators on theWildlife Rehabilitation of Hernando owner Jim Jablon poses with his GatorBike and a lemur.

After a friend agreed to build a cus-

a man from Sarasota selling a full-

$3,000.
Jablon convinced the seller to
donate the hide when he explained
he was using the alligator for fund-
raising.
Jablon then spent about 1,000
hours creating GatorBike.
When the winning ticket for
GatorBike is selected, Jablon and
Applegarth hope someone in
Gainesville will take home the mo-
torcycle.
"We want the bike to go to some-
one from the University of Florida
or up in that area, so they can drive
it to games," Applegarth said. "It's a
real attraction."

Improved post play key against Vandy
* THE GATORS WILL HOST THE COM-
MODORES TONIGHT AT 7.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator o rg
Last time Florida matched up with Vander-
bilt, the Commodores frontcourt had a field
day.
Vernon Macklin fouled out. Erik Murphy
did, too, despite playing just 13 minutes. The
two centers combined for six points, four re-
bounds and 10 fouls while UF lost 95-87 in
Nashville, Tenn.
Meanwhile, VU center A.J. Ogilvy explod-
ed for 24 points and eight rebounds, forward
Jeffery Taylor scored 14 points on perfect
shooting and forward Andre Walker was two
points and three assists shy of a triple-double.
With their NCAA Tournament hopes po-
tentially hanging in the balance, the Gators
(20-9, 9-5 Southeastern Conference) will take
on the No. 13 Commodores (22-6, 11-3 SEC)
tonight at 7 in the O'Connell Center hoping
their frontcourt can redeem itself.
"We've got to establish Vern and Alex
(Tyus) down low," junior forward Chandler
Parsons said. "Those guys have got to be our
energy, they've got to be relentless on the
glass, they've really got to just battle for 40
minutes. They've got to make it just as tough
on them as they will on us."
Unfortunately for UF, one of its most
glaring weaknesses is one of VU's greatest
strengths: depth. The Commodores used sev-
en forwards or centers on Jan. 9, while only
eight total Gators saw playing time.
"When you look at their depth across the
front line, it is probably as good as anyone in
the country," UF coach Billy Donovan said.
"With Vernon, Alex and Murphy as being our
core, those three guys are going to have to do
a heck of a job against their seven. That's what
it's going to come down to."
That kind of depth has allowed Ogilvy to
rest on the bench, making him more effective
in the 25.4 minutes per conference game he is
averaging.

Tebow's combine workout bodes we// for future
fter months of speculation andhearing people, well, s***-talk his
throwing motion, Tim Tebow was
finally able to get back to doing what he
does best on Sunday.
Being a freak.
Tebow flashed his athleticism at the
NFL Combine, tying the all-time record
for a vertical leap by a quarterback (38.5
inches), running a 4.72-second 40-yard
dash and clocking a 6.66-second time in the
three-cone drill.
He also ran the fastest 20- and 60-yardshuttle times by a
quarterback on the
day (he didn't have
a ton of competition
there, though) and
had the second-best
Mike MCCall broad jump of his
McCallin' It position group (9
Like I See It feet, 7 inches).
mmccall@alligator org What does all this
mean for his chances
of being a successful NFL quarterback?
Nothing, after all, that vertical jump tieda record held by Josh McCown (35 touch-
downs, 40 interceptions, five teams).
But at a time when scouts and TV talk-
ing heads are looking to poke holes in The
Chosen One, the most important thing is
that the workout certainly didn't hurt his
stock.
"I think he helped himself," said CO.

Florida set
for rivalry
showdown
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Writer
tjett@alligator org
Entering the season, Florida's of-
fensive philosophy was simple: Get
on base and let Preston Tucker bring
you home.
And when No. 5 UF (5-0) takes the
field against No. 6 FSU (6-0) at the
"Florida Four" Tournament in Tampa
tonight at 7:30, the Gators will try to
show the Seminoles that their offense
does not begin or end with Tucker.
Coach Kevin O'Sullivan said the
two hitters in front and two hitters
behind Tucker needed to protect him,
as he would see strikes only if those
four batters were threats. Through
the season's first five games, they
have done their jobs.
Leadoff hitter Matt den Dekker
and second baseman Josh Adams
have reached base on 54 percent
of their plate appearances and are
first and second on the team in runs
scored.
"The whole key to our offense is
Josh and Matt getting on base and
forcing other teams to pitch to Pres-
ton," O'Sullivan said. "If they do
that, then I think we're going to score
a bunch of runs."
The only hitch in the top of UF's
order has been Tucker. The player
who broke the Gators' single-season
RBIs record last year has yet to drive-
in a run. But the Gators' have thrived
nonetheless.
UF is scoring more than eight runs
per game, thanks largely to cleanup
hitter Austin Maddox and left fielder
Tyler Thompson, who hits fifth in the
lineup. The two players have com-
bined for 12 RBIs.
Of course, none of this should
come as a surprise to FSU if it has
watched film on Florida. All the Sem-
inoles will have needed to see was the
Gators' first inning of the season.
Facing USF, den Dekker led off
with a single, and Adams followed
with a two-run home run. Not want-

Werner's rocky career at Florida coming to close
Forward hopes fans will remember his hustle
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
a berry@alligator org
From being a part of the Gators'
second national championship
team as a freshman to back-to-back
National Invitation Tournament
appearances, Dan Werner has seen
his fair share of ups and downs.
Werner will get a chance to
close out his career on a high note,
as Florida's lone senior will be rec-
ognized during Senior Night be-
fore the Vanderbilt game tips off
tonight at 7.
He said his mom, dad, broth-
er and sister will walk onto the
O'Connell Center floor with him,
while several other family mem-
bers from his home state of New
Jersey will also be in attendance.
"I'm not really thinking about
the last game or anything like that
because then your mind starts
wandering away from what you'resupposed to think about," Werner
said. "It's going to be tough, but
hopefully, it'll be a little bit easier
with a win."
One of the lowest points of his
four-year career came earlier this
season, when seemingly none of
his shots were falling, and coach
Billy Donovan recommended that
Werner see a sports psychologist.
"At one point there, I was re-
ally down on myself, shooting the
ball not even thinking it was going
to go in. It's tough," Werner said.
"I've talked to people, and it'shelped me. I feel like when I shoot
it, it's going in."
That wasn't the case most of
this season, especially during con-
ference play, in which the senior
forward is shooting 25 percent
from the field and 15 percent from
beyond the arc.
After starting the season by
connecting on 14 of 27 attempts
from three-point range, Werner
has been ice cold, making just four
three-pointers since he hit three in
UF's 85-67 win against Jacksonville
on Dec. 4.Around the Gators' game
against South Carolina on Jan.
23, Werner said, Donovan recom-
mended a meeting with Jim Bur-
rell, a sports psychologist who has
worked with several UF athletes,
including junior forward Chandler
Parsons, and talks with Werner
once or twice a week.
Burrell gave Werner some sim-
ple advice.
"He said, 'So what if you don't
shoot the ball well? You can still
do so many other things,"' Werner
said. "That's what I've had to keep
telling myself."
The shots still aren't falling,
and Werner may never be as con-fident in his jump shot as he once
was. But, Donovan said, Werner is
at peace with his role on the team
and provides enough value to jus-
tify his 28 minutes per game.
"The guy has played his heart
out and given me, as a coach, ev-
erything I could ask for," Dono-
van said. "He's maybe not the
most athletic or talented guy, but
he's one of the smarter guys I've
coached."
With his college career nearly
over, Werner plans to take his
game overseas after graduating,
play basketball there as long as he
can and then come back to the U.S.
and start a career in real estate.
As for his legacy at UF, he hopes
fans remember him for his heart
and hustle -not his stats.
"I would like to think that's
what I'm all about: doing the right
things and giving 100 percent,"
Werner said. "I definitely didn't
make every shot I took, make the
right play or whatever, but at least
I played hard."

HT S o s
Stats shown are from Tennessee and Georgia
games
Parsons continued his impressive
all-around play, so his reign atop
our Hot Shots list continues this week
as well. The 6-foot-9 forward had
a career day Saturday at Georgia,
scoring 29 points while grabbing six
rebounds and dishing out six assists.
Chandler Parsons, F His 29 points were the most by a Flor-
ida player since former Gator Nick
Calathes had 33 points at Kentucky on Feb. 10, 2009.
He had his way with the Bulldogs on Saturday, going
10 of 16 from the field, 3 of 5 from three-point range
and 6 of 7 from the free-throw line. On top of that, his
filthy one-handed slam on an alley-oop from Erving
Walker was SportsCenter's No. 7 play of the month. If
he can get some consistent help, the Gators should be in
good shape entering the postseason.
Stats: 48 points, 18-28 shooting, 4-7 3-pointers,
8-10 FTs, 14 reb, 7 ast, 4 stKenny Boynton, GIAfter struggling to find his
rhythm for much of the Southeast-
ern Conference season, Boynton
caught fire against Georgia. The
freshman guard scored 22 points
Saturday on 6-of-9 shooting from
three-point range. He scored
just 12 points against Tennessee,
but his 22 points were his most
since dropping 28 against Vanderbilt to open the
conference season on Jan. 9, when he also hit six
threes. Through watching game tape, Boynton said
he found the problem in his shot: He was leaning,
moving or kicking his feet when shooting instead of
going straight up and down like he did against the
Bulldogs. UF could use a few more shooting days
like he had Saturday as it prepares to face Van-
derbilt and Kentucky this week.
Stats: 34 points, 12-22 shooting, 7-14 3-point-
ers, 3-6 FTs, 4 ast, 2 stl
Parsons -15 Boynton -5
Walker -10 Macklin -4
Tyus -8I
Walker blew the Tennes-
see game wide open, hitting
back-to-back-to-back threes
to put the Gators ahead 67-
50 with 3:39 to play, assuring
UF's victory. He finished with
19 points on 5-of-1 0 shooting
Erving Walker, PG against the Volunteers, adding
three assists, three rebounds
and two steals. He was somewhat of a non-factor
Saturday against Georgia, scoring seven points
on 2-of-9 shooting and recording four assists and
two rebounds. However, his big shots against UT
were enough to give him a slight edge over center
Vernon Macklin (23 points on 10-of-17 shooting,
16 rebounds) for the third-place spot this week.
Stats: 26 points, 7-19 shooting, 5-10 3-pointers,

Maddox benefitting from hitting behind Tucker
BASEBALL, from page 16
ing to test Tucker while already
down a couple runs, the Bulls elected
to walk him on five pitches.
Maddox came up next, and he
pounded a pitch over the right-field
fence for the second two-run homer
of the inning.
"(Maddox is) getting good pitches
to hit because of Preston," O'Sullivan
said.
Maddox feeds off of the hitters in
front of him.
"When all the players around you
are good, it makes you a better play-
er," he said.
And when pitchers get past the
Gators' first four hitters unscathed,
they still have to face Thompson.
After starting 10 games in 2009,
Thompson's clutch hitting has earned
him an increased role this season.
The left-handed hitter is 3 for 5
with runners in scoring position, re-
cording 6 RBIs in those at-bats. Dur-
ing his limited playing time last year,
Thompson learned what pitches to
expect with runners on base.
"Any time there is a guy in scor-
ing position, you're going to get off-
speed," he said.
If Thompson and Maddox contin-
ue to hit, the Gators will not need to
rely on Tucker. Not that anybody is
expecting the sophomore's slump to
last long.
"He (Tucker) won't press,"
O'Sullivan said. "He gets upset and
he'll be fine. If you look at anybody
that's had the success he's had, you're
going to get pitched differently."
For now, teams have four other
guys to worry about.VU's frontcourt depth
causes problems
HOOPS, from page 16
The 6-foot-11 center is scoring 15.1 points and
grabbing 6.8 rebounds in SEC play, and he has got-
ten to the free-throw line a staggering 125 times,
making 90 of those attempts.
No Gator has attempted anywhere near 125 free
throws in league play. In fact, Parsons has taken as
many free throws on the year as Ogilvy has in 14
conference games, and he has shot the most free
throws on the team this season.
"Because they have an enormous amount of
depth across their frontcourt, they can rest him
at different times and really give him a break,"
Donovan said. "They have a lot
of guys at the three, four and five
they can throw at you."
By attacking the basket with
Men's their arsenal of post players, the
Basketball Commodores can get their op-ponents in foul trouble down
low or open up the perimeter
for guard Jermaine Beal, who scored 22 against the
Gators earlier this season.
UF hung around against VU due to an incred-
ible shooting day from guards Kenny Boynton and
Erving Walker, who combined to score 50 points
and make 11 three-pointers.
But if the Gators want to avenge their loss and
stay in the running for third place in the SEC East,
they will need a much more complete, well-round-
ed performance tonight.
"It's going to take the whole team to physically
compete with those guys," Parsons said. "They're
really tough. They're smart. They defend. They
have shooters. They have a really good guard in
Beal. They have it all."

lege Scouting.
"I think somebody will give him
a shot. Everyone is talking about
how he can't play quarterback, but
I think you need to give the boy a
shot and see if he can do it."
That shot is going to come at
UF's Pro Day on March 17, when
Tebow will show off his revamped
throwing motion in a workout that
will hopefully include a dramatic
curtain-raising and smoke ma-chine.
Another positive of his combine
workout is that Tebow shouldn't
have to worry about the physi-
cal testing from here on out. He
did well enough that his Pro Day
should just be all about throwing,
and he can focus on that for the next
two weeks.
But until then, Tebow gave pro
teams something positive to think
about. He's a great athlete, and one
way or another, his services will be
of use.
"Let me say this: I think he's oneheck of a football player, and if he
can't play quarterback, you better
find a spot for him because if you
let him get away, he'll come back to
haunt you," Brocato said.
Of Tebow's numbers, Brocato
said the three-cone performance
is the most important because it
shows flexibility and change of di-
rection, two very important quali-
ties for quarterbacks evading tack-
lers in the pocket.
And Tebow's time in the three-
cone was very impressive, even if
three sixes seems way out of linefrom everything we know of the
Tebow family.
His 6.66 was far ahead of the
next-best quarterback (Dan LeFe-
vour at 6.93) and even topped the
list of running backs, starting with
former Cal back Jahvid Best (6.75).
"You want guys who do it un-
der seven (seconds)," Brocato said.
"If you break seven seconds, that's
excellent."
Brocato would know. He's cred-
ited with inventing the three-cone
drill.
Tebow also tied Best -who rana 4.35-second 40-yard dash- in the
20-yard shuttle (4.17 seconds).
All these numbers could mean
nothing as far as becoming a great
pro quarterback, but they show
that, no matter what your opinion
is of his release point and wind-up,
Tebow has the physical tools to car-
ry his legend to the next level.
"I think he's a good athlete and
had a fine workout, and I would
love to have him as a football play-
er," Brocato said. "Wherever he
plays, he's going to be good, let me
put it that way."Harrison Diamond/ Alligator Staff

By KELSIE HOECHERL
Alligator Writer
Due to darkness, the Florida
women's golf team wasn't able to
finish their second round of play in
the Kinderlou Forest Challenge.
The squad is in fifth place, but
the scores are not official as all the
teams have between two and six
holes remaining. The second round
will be completed before the third
round Tuesday. The Gators were
in second place after the first round
with a 295 (+3).
Freshman Isabelle Lendl contin-
ued her strong play from the Cen-
tral District Invitational. Lendl is
currently at four-over par in the sec-
ond round and is tied for 24th place.
The freshman started out strong on
her first 12 holes, but three bogeys
dropped her from three-under to
even-par.
"She had a good round this morn-
ing," UF women's coach Jan Dowl-
ing said. "She finished up on some
tough holes today because we were
in a shotgun and she lost a little bit
of momentum there."
Fellow freshman Mia Piccio card-
ed an even-par in her first round and
is currently at one-over par with six
holes left in the second round.
After shooting a one-over 73,sophomore Markia Lendl is at a
stand still in the second round at
three-over par. Lendl finished the
first round tied for 13th.
Evan Jensen tied for 20th in
round one after combating back-to-
back bogeys with two consecutive
birdies. The sophomore is three-
over par with three holes left.
"There are some good vibes
going on -they're [the girls]
talking about winning, which
is always a good thing. This
team doesn't give up."
Jan Dowling
UF women's golf coach
Rounding out the Gators lineup
is junior Jessica Yadloczky who tied
for 31st in round one and is three-
over with six holes left in round
two.
Despite losing strokes between
their first and second round and
having to play two rounds on Tues-
day, the Gators remain confident.
"There are some good vibes go-
ing on -they're [the girls] talking
about winning, which is always a
good thing," Dowling said. "This
team doesn't give up."
The Florida men's golf team
improved its standing by one spotMonday in the John Hayt Invita-
tional and is now tied for 11th place
with Coastal Carolina, carding a 36-
hole score of 603 (310-293, +27).
Senior Tim McKenney jumped
34 spots on the leaderboard to tie for
17th. McKenney finished two-under
par in his second round.
Fellow senior Tyson Alexan-
der also climbed the leaderboard,
climbing 29 spots to finish in a tie
for 35th.
Junior Bank Vongvanij, who was
tied for 64th with Alexander at the
start of the second round Monday
also gained some spots on the lead-
er board, though not as many as his
older teammates. Vongvanij moved
to 47th, carding two-over par Mon-
day.
Freshman Phillip Choi, who was
Florida's leader after round one on
Sunday lost 18 positions on the lea-
derboard and is currently in a tie for
23rd, with a two round score of 149
(72-77, +5).
Rounding out the lineup for UF
in last place, 84th, is junior Andres
Echavarria. Echavarria fell eight
spots on the second round after
carding 10-over par two days run-
ning. He has a two round score of
164 (+20).
Playing as an individual in fa-
miliar territory, freshman Tyler Mc-
Cumber gained eight spots, moving
into tenth place on his hometown
course in Ponte Vedra Beach.Harrison Diamond/ Alligator Staff
