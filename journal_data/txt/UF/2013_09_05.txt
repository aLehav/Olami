One month after the city began a two-
lane trafﬁ  c pattern trial on Northwest 
Eighth Avenue, residents’ reactions 
to the change continue to evoke 
passionate yet divided opinions.
While feedback about the project 
— which is aimed at reducing trafﬁ  c 
and increasing pedestrian safety near 
Westside Park — has been both positive and negative, project manager John Veilleux said the ability to run a trial instead of simply estimating possible 
changes has been a successful choice.
“It’s not often where you can do a 
trial like this,” he said. “In this case, it 
was so controversial and diverse, we 
decided on the trial period so we could 
see for ourselves what the impacts were going to be.”
In early August, the City of 
Gainesville Public Works Department 
cut the number of trafﬁ  c lanes from 
four to two on Northwest Eighth Avenue from Northwest 23rd Street to Northwest 31st Drive.
Chip Skinner, Regional Transit System marketing and communications supervisor, said confusion about 
the trial acting as a permanent 
conﬁ  guration may account for some of the negative feedback.
“Some people feel it’s deﬁ  nitely 
going to be the ﬁ  nal conﬁ  guration 
because they don’t realize it’s a test to 
monitor the trafﬁ  c situation,” he said.
Skinner said the valuable data the 
city will receive about the impacts of the trafﬁ  c pattern change is worth the cost of the trial.
“The feeling behind that is that it’s 
better to spend a little money now and see how the trafﬁ  c ﬂ  ows,” he said.
As residents become more familiar 
with the trafﬁ  c pattern, some have said they’ve grown to appreciate it.
“After driving the redesigned part 
a few times now, I found it much better than before,” wrote resident Stephen Perz in an email to the City 
Commission. “I suggest the redesign is 
an improvement for motorists as well as cyclists, since they are now in their own lanes. This looks win-win to me.”Opinions on Eighth

A Gainesville man went from a hide-
out in an air conditioning unit to a jail cell 
when deputies discovered him Tuesday 
morning.
Cornelius Samuel Banks, 23, was ar-
rested on a felony warrant and charges of 
resisting ofﬁ  cers without violence, accord-
ing to an Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce 
arrest report. 
The friend who was hiding him in her 
apartment — 20-year-old Katronna Vanece Smith — was arrested on charges of resist-
ing an ofﬁ  cer.
At about 8 a.m., deputies went to 
Smith’s house, located in a unit at 5800 SW 
20th Ave., to look for Banks, according to 
the report. 
Smith insisted she hadn’t seen Banks in 
two months and said he was hiding out in  
New Jersey with his family.Deputies couldn’t ﬁ  nd Banks at ﬁ  rst, but 
during a second search of the apartment, 
they noticed a large toy car blocking a door 
to an air conditioning handler vent.
After undoing the two 
swivel latches locking the door, deputies found 
Banks inside the vent cov-ered in a sheet and a tow-el, according to the report. They then arrested both 
Banks and Smith.
Deputies booked them 
both into the Alachua County Jail at about 
9 a.m., where Banks remained as of press time with no bond. Smith was released lat-
er that morning on her own recognizance.
Banks was wanted for counts of aggra-
vated assault and possession of a weapon 
by a convicted felon, among other charges, 
according to Alachua County Clerk of the 
Court records.Felon found in air conditioner

Gator fans taking the journey to 
watch the game against the University 
of Miami will have to leave their back-packs and purses at home because of new NFL regulations.
Chris Yandle, assistant athletic di-
rector for communications at UM, said the decision to adopt the bag policy is new this season. Because the Miami Hurricanes use the same security per-sonnel as the Miami Dolphins at Sun Life Stadium, applying the same safety procedures for the college games makes 
it easier on the staff and fans.
Yandle said fans are urged to read 
the new policies to avoid any frustra-
tion at the gates. The new regulations are listed on the Hurricanes’ website under the football tab.
According to the website, each at-
tendee is allowed one clear 12-inch-by-6-inch bag made out of plastic, vinyl 
or PVC. In addition, small hand-sized 
clutch purses with or without handles are allowed. All backpacks, computer or camera bags, seat cushions and bags Miami clear about game bagSEE TRAFFIC, PAGE 4

UF received a $325,000 grant 
to digitize historic newspapers 
from Florida and Puerto Rico 
published between 1836 and 
1922.
The National Endowment for 
the Humanities (NEH) chose UF 
as the only institution in the state 
of Florida to receive the grant.
Patrick Reakes, chair of the 
Humanities and Social Sciences Library, said the grant is part of 
the National Digital Newspaper 
Program, a long-term collabora-
tion between the NEH and the Li-
brary of Congress to make news-papers more widely available.
“It’s exciting for me because I 
know how heavily used historic newspapers are,” he said.
The library received the con-
ﬁ  rmation letter in August, and 
the two-year project is planned to 
begin in October.
An outside vendor will digi-
tize the ﬁ  lm for the newspapers, and metadata, or “data about 
data,” will also be created so peo-
ple can search the articles.
Reakes said part of the li-
brary’s mission is to provide ac-cess to materials, and the project will fulﬁ  ll that purpose.“It’s a really good use of the 
money to create something that we know is going to be heavily used,” he said.  
Reakes said the existing Flor-
ida Digital Newspaper Library 
and the Caribbean Digital News-
paper Library had about 19 mil-lion hits in 2012, and the demand 
for digital access drove the deci-
sion to create more of it.
“There’s obviously a really 
strong demand for this kind of 
digital access,” he said.
Currently, a specialist can take 
a picture of each individual page 
of the paper and put it onto a roll of ﬁ  lm that can then be looked at through a microﬁ  lm reader.
“A lot of our history classes or 
people doing any kind of histori-
cal research come in and have to 
roll that ﬁ  lm through a microﬁ  lm reader,” he said.
Ben Fritzsche, a 20-year-old 
history junior, said he has used 
both the microﬁ  lm and the UF 
Digital Newspaper Library, and 
with the new resources, a broader 
range of articles will be available 
to students.
“I’m a big fan,” he said. “For 
me, the information is still going 
to be there, it’s just easier to ac-
cess it.”
Once completed, the digitized newspapers will be available through the “Chronicling Ameri-
ca” section of the Library of Con-gress website.Reakes said because these his-
toric newspapers are starting to deteriorate, digitally archiving them is essential.“If this stuff goes away and 
the ﬁ  lm isn’t available anymore, it’s basically lost to history,” he said.

President Barack Obama’s 
statement about two weeks ago 
that law schools should be only two years may not be far-fetched, and a similar concept could appear at UF’s Levin College of Law.
UF students aren’t encouraged 
to take the bar exam after two years because they wouldn’t be ready, said law school Dean Rob-ert Jerry. But the idea of chang-ing the third and final year of law school to be more hands-on has already been discussed by the ad-ministration.
“We would make the third year 
a curriculum of problem solving,” 
Jerry said.
Currently, problem-solving 
skills are spread throughout the 
three years instead of concentrat-
ed in one final year.
He said the first two years 
would remain in the traditional 
classroom format to learn the knowledge necessary to practice 
law. In the last year, there would 
be opportunities for real practice 
settings such as in law firms or simulated situations in class.
“There is the possibility of ma-jor changes in the upper division,” said Jerry.
He said the two major issues 
facing law schools are cost of edu-cation and skills training.
Florida public law schools are 
considered affordable. He said law schools in other states can cost about $50,000. The concept 
of a two-year program would re-duce that cost, but at the expense 
of training students, he said. That 
is where the hands-on third year 
comes in.
Law students also see merits to 
more practice in law school.
“From what I know, the third 
year is not as involved as an ex-ternship or internship,” said 
Andy Schein, 22, a first-year law student. Schein said he is in agree-ment with Obama’s statement 
because two years of traditional 
school would be better for prepa-
ration and more cost-effective.
But law programs might not 
stop at two years.Jerry said there is a market for 
one-year law programs.
The degree, a master of law, 
would be ideal for those who do not want to practice law but want to increase their knowledge of law for other jobs such as for a new 
principal who wants to be familiar 
with education law.
Jerry said the one-year pro-
gram is also something that could 
be seen in the future for UF.
“I’m prepared to advocate in 
addition to what the president said. There is a need for a pro-gram where people can enhance their knowledge of law,” he said.
Obama suggests law schools consider barring third year
� BUSINESS PICKED UP 
IN FALL 2010 WITH A MIAMI DIRECT FLIGHT.

Despite its size, the 
Gainesville Regional Airport is 
in competition with other major airports.
According to U.S. Bureau 
of Transportation Statistics for Florida airports, the Gainesville airport ranks the highest per-centages in the categories of most flights, passengers and seats.
Laura Aguiar, a public rela-
tions manager for the airport, attributed the buoyancy of the 
Gainesville airport to a strong 
base of business travelers.
“There seems to be a trend 
in the airline industry that is focusing hard on the business travelers, which, that is good for us since we have strong business traffic,” Aguiar said.
She also noted students, 
Ocala residents and snowbirds keep seasonal traffic high.
Charles Gray, a frequent 
business flyer from New York, said his experience at the Gainesville airport was posi-tive.“I drop off the car, get the 
ticket, and there is no hassle waiting in lines,” he said.
According to the Depart-
ment of Transportation data, Gainesville has been on a pat-tern of growth for the past couple of years as compared to 
the national average for major 
airports, which is declining.
Statistics for Gainesville 
show an average number of 11,120 passengers in 2009, a low point airports across the country experienced due to the recession.
But Gainesville saw devel-
opment as business picked up back in the fall of 2010 when a direct flight to Miami became available.
The direct route to Miami 
picked up drive traffic as more people opted to fly rather than drive.
Sonam Patel, a 21-year-old 
UF sociology senior, feels some-times it is too much of a hassle to drive.
“I would use this airport to 
connect somewhere out of state and save time and money rath-er than driving home taking a flight there,” said Patel.
The airport is working to-
ward providing direct flights to New York City next, Aguiar said.Gainesville airport

Data to be collected for three more months
However, some residents think limiting the lanes 
is a step in the wrong direction.
Stephen Thomas, a 25-year Gainesville resident, 
said that after giving the redesigned pattern a few 
days consideration, making it permanent would be restrictive.
“While I was originally hopeful, I have to give it the thumbs down,” he wrote in an email to 
Commissioner Susan Bottcher. 
“A lot of stressed-out people will be making 
poor decisions as they are funneled into two lanes 
so close to 34th Street.”
Data for the study will continue to be collected 
for an additional three months.
It will end after the Thanksgiving holiday, 
according to the Gainesville Public Works website.TrAffIC , from page 1
UM ordered bags to give out but won’t have them for the UF game
larger than the given size cannot be taken in-
side the stadium.
“With anything that’s new, we obviously 
want fans to be educated,” he said. “Fan safety is paramount.”
Yandle said the guards have been asked 
to be flexible with fans due to how sudden the changes were. Each season ticket ac-
count holder will be given one regulation-
approved bag, and fans will be given a clear gallon-sized bag at the gates. However, he said the bags that were ordered won’t come in time for the UF game.
“I know it’s going to be an inconvenience 
in the beginning, but in the end, it will be really helpful,” Yandle said.
Daniel Fragata, a 23-year-old UF interior design senior, said after seeing his girlfriend 
and sister carry their bags into games at UF, 
he knows the new rules will cause a big stir with fans.
“I can only see it ending poorly,” Fragata 
said.
He said the convenience of having a 
bag is being able to put it on your shoulder and forget about it. Having a clear bag big enough to hold a phone and a wallet is going to need constant attention.
Mahsa Sabouri, a 19-year-old psychology 
sophomore, said the new rules are going to be a huge inconvenience that might make her stray away from attending the Miami game.
“I can see a lot of people getting turned 
around at the gates because they had no idea about the rules,” she said. “They definitely need to publicize this better.”

As dozens of universities across the coun-
try are creating stricter policies for diagnos-
ing and managing ADHD, UF is ahead of the curve.
The UF Counseling and Wellness Center 
began re-evaluating its policies two years ago, said Michele Travers, a medical direc-tor at the center. The policies, which Travers said are now fully implemented, help differ-entiate between students who have a medi-cal need for the medication and students who fake symptoms to get the medication for nonmedical purposes.
Now, when UF students are tested for 
ADHD, they are also tested for drug abuse. They undergo psychiatric screening for oth-er possible underlying illnesses and are re-quired to get input from parents and former 
teachers, Travers said.
Restrictions other colleges are imple-
menting include enforcing contracts with 
students that mandate drug tests and pro-hibit pill sharing, according to a recent New York Times report.
When UF specialists learned more than 
half the patients at the Counseling and Well-ness Center were on ADHD medications, they decided the number of prescribed drug users was widespread enough to change the criteria for handling attention disorders.
“The guidelines have been in place for 
many years, but there was more leniency,” said Travers.
With the stricter poli-
cies in place, “it’s almost impossible to fake at this point,” she said.
Dr. Scott Teitelbaum, 
medical director for UF Health Florida Recovery, 
called ADHD medications the “steroids of studying” because nonmedical use 
has been known to improve students’ con-centration and academic performance.
It’s a difficult drug to regulate because most students who use the pills for studying get them from their friends, he said.
“The issue on the college campus that’s 
tricky is that a lot of college students know 
what to say to get it,” Teitelbaum said.
Teitelbaum said these stimulants can 
cause restlessness, anxiety and paranoia, 
and it makes the person more prone to hy-pertension and stroke.
But Noah Silverstein, an 18-year-old UF 
biomedical engineering freshman, said doc-tors are partially to blame.
Silverstein said they typically require 
people to fill out  questionnaires, and with the right answers, they will write a prescrip-tion.
“People are abusing the system,” Sil-
verstein said. “Doctors hand it out like it’s candy.”

As Congress comes to a 
decision on intervention in 
Syria, Gainesville residents are sorting their own opin-ions.
On Monday, a French in-
telligence report alleged that the Syrian regime, led by president Bashar al-Assad, launched a chemical attack that targeted its own people in the Damascus suburbs on Aug. 21, according to the As-
sociated Press.  
“We have international 
law that says we cannot use 
chemical weapons, and Syria signed,” said UF political science associate professor 
Leann Brown. “They’re now 
outside the law.”  
An estimated 5,000 Syrians 
are leaving their homes every 
day, leading to a total refugee 
count of more than 2 million people who have escaped to neighboring countries like Iraq and Lebanon, according to the United Nations News Centre.
“It’s especially hard on the 
refugees,” said Paul D’Anieri, 
dean of the College of Liberal 
Arts and Sciences at UF. “It’s a hardship that most of us cannot imagine.”
In a statement Saturday, 
President Barack Obama pro-posed a method of limited intervention that does not involve troops on the ground and has decided to seek con-
gressional approval.
“The president is a consti-
tutional lawyer. He wants to 
make this as legal as he can,” Brown said.
Determined to dissuade 
the regime of Bashar al-Assad from using chemical weap-ons again, French President Francois Hollande agreed with President Obama on in-tervention.
However, French Prime 
Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said France would not act alone and is seeking help from the U.S. and other allies, according to the AP.
“I don’t think intervention 
is appealing to anybody,” said D’Anieri. “But there are 
a lot of people that simply be-
lieve you cannot allow people 
to use chemical weapons.”
According to the Obama 
administration, 1,429 people 
were killed in the chemical attack.
“There is something about 
chemical weapons that in-
duces fear and horror,” said 
D’Anieri. “It is seen as a tool 
of barbarians and uncivilized 
people.”
This is an attack that could 
lead to an escalation in the 
use of chemical weapons if action is not taken, Obama said Saturday.
“If the U.S. has to inter-
vene, I don’t know how, but I just hope that they could 
manage to find a more peace-
ful way of doing so without bombing people,” said Jordi Escaravadal, a 28-year-old in-ternational business student at UF.
D’Anieri said when Con-
gress goes back in session, the vote should produce some 
very interesting results.
“This particular case has 
the feel of something that 
people will be looking back to for many years as a turn-ing point in world politics,” he said.Locals unsure about

Because of a recent grant, UF 
can now offer care to families of 
children with disabilities in twice 
as many Florida counties.
UF’s Pediatric Integrated Care 
System, or Ped-I-Care, has re-
ceived a three-year $18 million 
grant from the Florida Depart-
ment of Health.
Nancy Giunta, executive di-
rector of Ped-I-Care, said the grant money would go toward 
paying for medical services, den-
tal health services and transpor-
tation.
Money would also be used to 
give every child his or her own 
nurse care coordinator through 
Children’s Medical Services.
A nurse care coordinator en-
sures families are able to make 
appointments, get checkups and 
immunizations.“This is a huge factor in the 
success of our program,” said 
Giunta. “We truly believe in the organization of patient-centered 
care and care coordination for the 
children.”  
This grant will provide health 
insurance to children with critical health care needs in 51 of Flori-da’s 67 counties.
Jes Baldeweg-Rav, a 19-year-
old UF history sophomore, said 
he understands the hardships of 
financial struggles.
“Not coming from a high-
income household and my three other siblings also in college, hearing as much money is given to provide health services for low-income households is re-
freshing,” said Baldeweg-Rav.

for these complex children in a 
coordinated and cost-effective 
fashion, she said.
“I think this plan is wonder-
ful, as it is taking a step to reach 
out to many kids in the different 
counties with the facilities and 
state-of-the-art technology that is 
available,” said Jessica Forbes, a

Again, we have chosen short-term proﬁ  ts over the 
long-term well-being of the world.
The Ecuadorean government abandoned a 
plan to conserve part of the ever-shrinking Amazon rainforest from oil drilling. 
Because they would lose all the proﬁ  ts from tapping 
the resource, Ecuador had a plan to make money and 
help the environment — get money from nations around 
the world to not drill in Yasuni National Park, where approximately 20 percent of the country’s oil sits. 
Over the course of 13 years, Ecuador aimed to cash 
in on only half of the estimated value of the oil: $3.2 
billion. In 2007, the country set up a fund through the 
United Nations, but by the end of 2012, the fund only had $6.5 million.
Now Ecuador has scrapped that plan and plans to 
drill in the delicate forest, where any negative impact would harm 100,000 species per roughly 2.5 acre area, according to the Guardian.
“Even the sound of the motor will destroy the fra-
gility of this place,” Ivonne A-Baki, who works for the 
Ecuadorean government, told an NPR journalist. 
Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa is saying that 
less than 0.1 percent of the forest will be sacriﬁ  ced, and 
that as much as $18.2 billion could come from oil extrac-
tion.
This issue highlights the complexity of the dilemmas 
of our generation and something that needs to be talked 
about. I’m not talking about left-right global warming politics here — I’m talking about a real problem that 
needs a real solution.
We live in a world where our livelihood is being sold 
to the highest bidder. How much is the Amazon worth? 
Who are we to even put a price on that?
At the same time, Correa is stuck. He can either choose to tap a lucrative resource and 
continue helping his poverty-stricken nation, or he can preserve a unique home to 10 percent of all living species on earth. 
Now, while I’m a sucker for 
helping the impoverished, the risks cannot be forgotten. 
It’s easy to think that by lim-
iting the forest drilling area, ev-erything will be ﬁ  ne. 
Remember the Gulf oil spill? Lots of oil came from 
one little rig.
Even if there is no such disaster, environmental im-
pacts should be considered.
First is the burning of all the oil that’s extracted, and 
all the gas burned to transport that oil. Not to mention additional deforestation — the Amazon has lost 17 per-
cent of its forest cover in 50 years — and the impact of 
the deforestation on indigenous people and animals.
Half of Yasuni National Park already has oil wells 
on it, according to the Guardian. Western parts of the preserve have been lost because of the wells’ process-
ing and pumping facilities. Then you have roads to the 
wells, housing for workers — the list goes on. It is not too long before the Amazon rainforest becomes another industrial sector.
It’s not something you consider every day, but global 
dependence on oil must stop. 
The consumption of oil is not sustainable, as high-
lighted by the delicate case in the Amazon.
Balancing the welfare of people with the environ-
ment is crucial, but we’re not doing that. 
The world, especially the United States, continues to 
focus on consumption — but not its consequences. 
We continue to take from the earth without expect-
ing anything to be taken in return.

Wake up, America:
Scientists conﬁ  rm
beneﬁ  ts of sleep
As Ernest Hemingway said, “I love sleep. My life has the 
tendency to fall apart when I’m awake, you know?”
However, this quote predates the existence of Netf-
lix and Skype, so maybe he’d recant that statement if he spent 
a night clicking the “Go to next episode” button while binge-
watching season one of “Orange Is the New Black.”
Unfortunately, as classes — not to mention the ﬁ  nal epi-
sodes of “Breaking Bad” — begin and new tasks start piling up, sleep is one of the ﬁ  rst things that tend to slide to the bottom of the priorities list. This is a travesty, people: You basically turn into a monster when you don’t sleep. Sleep not only affects your motor skills, productivity, mood, immune system, blood pressure, cardiovascular health and sex life, but scientists conﬁ  rmed yesterday that chronic lack of sleep could also lead to brain disease later in life.
Researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison con-
cluded a study that conﬁ  rmed sleep helps boost the produc-tion of myelin — the cells responsible for brain repair — ac-cording to Medical News Today. Although further research is needed to know for sure, the researchers believe extreme or chronic lack of sleep could trigger symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis, a progressive brain disease associated with 
myelin damage.
Medical News Today contributor Honor Whiteman re-
ported that studies conducted on brain activity during sleep 
over the years have shown that many genes switch on during sleep and switch off during wakefulness. Until this new study out of the University of Wisconsin, however, the speciﬁ  c ef-
fect of sleep on certain types of cells was unknown.
“They point to oligodendrocytes,” Whiteman wrote. 
“These cells are responsible for making myelin within a 
healthy brain and in response to injury. The researchers add that myelin is responsible for allowing electrical impulses to 
move from cell to cell, ‘similar to insulation around an electri-
cal wire.’”
According to the National Sleep Foundation, we know 
that sleep is needed for restoration and renewal, but sleep — 
like space, the ocean and Beyonce’s thighs — is a natural phe-
nomenon. Although it may seem that new sleep studies are redundant, since we know that sleep is important, scientists still don’t understand the exact function of sleep.
Merrill Mitler, a sleep expert and neuroscientist at the Na-
tional Institutes of Health, said sleep is vital to our molecular structures, energy balance, intellectual function and alertness. Lack of sleep interferes with higher levels of reasoning, prob-lem solving and attention to detail — key skills needed when 
pursuing a college degree.
The prevalent attitude toward sleep among college stu-
dents is that it’s disposable. It’s almost considered a feat of 
strength to forgo sleep in favor of studying or drinking, and 
caffeine addictions and sleepless nights are romanticized to 
the point of annoyance. Forgoing sleep, however, is a risky behavior pattern with long-term consequences.

An AK-47 hangs on a wall, black 
as space and soft as a pillow.
Instead of a cold, metal firearm, 
Bethany Taylor decided to make 
hers out of fabric. Its barrel droops 
downward, seemingly sad, like 
something out of a cartoon.
Inspired by the political debate 
that Americans are being “soft” on guns, she interpreted this idea liter-ally and fashioned a piece to spark a discussion about it.
“I wanted to call attention to this 
fetishization of violence in our cul-
ture,” said the UF assistant professor 
of drawing. “Velvet is kind of a me-morial sort of material. It makes me think of something that has a ritual to it, and I think guns can be seen as kind of a ritual.”
Taylor put her work on display 
for the School of Art + Art History 48th Annual Studio Faculty Exhibi-
tion, along with many of her col-
leagues. 
Through Sept. 27, a collection of 
work gathered from professors of UF’s College of Fine Arts will be on display for the public to see in the University Gallery’s newest exhibi-tion. The exhibition’s opening recep-tion is Friday from 7 to 9 p.m.
Another section of the gallery 
tells a story of the opening of the John Erickson Museum of Art in 
Berlin. The “museum,” which is a 
small torpedo-shaped object, was placed underground near the aban-doned Teufelsberg Spy Station that the U.S. used for espionage during the 1960s. 
UF assistant professor of sculp-
ture Sean Miller shows what was found when he was there.“All of the listening equipment 
was housed in these geodesic domes that are really beautiful and strange and sci-fi looking. But now they are falling apart, and there’s this graf-fiti collective that’s taking over and painting them and cutting them 
open,” Miller said. “Even though they are messing the site up, they 
are kind of reimagining the site in interesting ways.”
One of the photos in his collec-
tion is a graffiti image of Iron Man drawn by the vandals. Miller also included rubble and a piece of ny-
lon fabric from the spy station in his presentation. He wants people to 
know about the site and hopes that his piece inspires people to become familiar with it.  
The show will display most of 
the mediums taught by the school of fine arts, some of which include 
painting, video, mixed media, print,  photography and sculpture. One 
piece in particular sits on a small white table near the front of the gal-lery. People are shouting and clap-ping from inside a UPS package. A recording plays voices of another language inside the Amazon.com 
taped box and draws attention to 
this normal, everyday object.
“It’s a really tasteful show. It’s a 
little toned down compared to past years, and I think that’s a reflection of the art world now,” director of the University Gallery Amy Vigilante said.
For this exhibition, Vigilante 
didn’t curate the show. She let the faculty members present what their most current exploration is.
“What we would like people to 
do,” Vigilante said, “is look, like it, don’t like it, have your own person-al reactions and don’t feel bad about your reactions.”
More than 500 people are expect-
ed to attend the opening reception Friday night. Selected works will be available for purchase, and the art-ists will be there to talk about their pieces.
“The faculty likes to show their 
work once a year to the students so that they can see the work that 
we do,” Kelly said. “To have some 
actual work to show the students, I think, is kind of nice for them.
“It’s nice for us to see each other’s 
work, too.”Fine Arts faculty puts work on display through Sept. 27

Good cuddling buddies: teddy 
bears, puppies, kittens and bunnies. 
Dust mites, not so much. Yet, ap-parently, some single men may not mind sharing their bed with these tiny creatures.
A recent survey of 2,004 people 
done by Ergoflex, a mattress com-pany in the United Kingdom, shows that 55 percent of men between the ages of 18 and 25 rarely change the sheets on their beds, some even as little as four times a year, according to www.msn.com.
Mark Smoke, owner of Sleep Na-tion in Gainesville, said an average person sheds dead skin cells and sweats anywhere from six to 10 fluid ounces during one night. A mattress that was 100 pounds will gain 20 to 30 pounds of skin, sweat and dust from the room over the course of 10 
years, he said.
College students are busy. With 
classes, homework, extracurricular 
activities, work and a social life, it may be difficult to find the time to change the sheets. It’s a process: take them off, put them in the washing machine, wait, put them in the dry-er, wait, remake the bed. Who wants 
to take the time to do all that? And 
just think, if you forget to move the sheets from the washing machine to the dryer and come home late at night wanting to crawl into bed, you won’t be able to if your sheets are soaking wet.
It may, however, be in a man’s 
best interests to make the effort, as 
his image among the ladies may suf-
fer if he does not.
“I think it’s unhygienic and 
shows a lack of maturity,” said Kel-ly Audette, a 22-year-old first-year multimedia journalism graduate student.
Take note, men.Ideally, bed sheets should be 
changed once a month, Smoke said. He recommends keeping three sets of sheets in rotation. If you can’t wash them right away, there is an-other set to put on the bed.
Turns out 
women at UF may be in luck. Sean Wilson, a 20-year-
old finance junior, 
said he washes his sheets at least ev-ery two weeks.
“If I come home drunk and dirty, 
sometimes I will wash them soon-er,” he said.
Cameron Darr, a 21-year-old his-
tory junior, also washes his sheets 
about every two weeks and said if 
it weren’t such a hassle he would wash them more often.
“It’s a pain to remake my bed 
after washing my sheets,” he said. “I also don’t like raising my utilities bill.”
Chuck Rogan, vice president 
of Mattress Town of Gainesville, 
recommends doing more than just 
washing and changing bed sheets. He suggests buying a mattress pro-tector to help prevent dust mites from building up and causing aller-gies.
Keeping the bed bugs from bit-
ing is easier than grabbing a shoe and whacking them until they’re 
black and blue. All you need to do is 
change the bed sheets.
Bi-weekly change helps keep bed bugs away, gets ladies to stay“It’s a little toned down

Red has a reputation of mak-
ing women feel ambitious, daring 
and conﬁ  dent. Think of the little 
red dress you zip up to impress 
or those haute red heels that are your go-to accessory.
But when you are looking for 
just a dash of conﬁ  dence and sex appeal, you could turn to red lip-stick.
A recent study 
found that red is 
the sexiest lip 
color. The study, done by the Uni-versity of Man-
chester, found 
that men ﬁ  xated 
on the lips of women wearing red lipstick for 7.3 seconds and only 2.2 seconds on girls who were not 
wearing any lip color, according 
to Daily Mail UK
“Behavioral psychologists or 
cultural psychologists would 
tell you that it’s because women 
in red have been portrayed over time as sexy,” said Laurie Mintz, a UF psychology professor.
Modern sex symbols like 
Rihanna, Angelina Jolie and Kim Kardashian have sported this crimson look on a regular basis. But scan the crowds along Uni-versity Avenue on a Friday night and you’ll ﬁ  nd that red rouge hasn’t spread widely through Gainesville.“It rubs off and leaves a weird 
color on your lips,” said Aman-da Morales, a 19-year- o l d health science sophomore. “I feel more conﬁ  dent with a nude or light pink.”
The study found pink held 
men’s attention for 6.7 seconds.
Communication sciences and 
disorders sophomore Devon Hall has found the trend doesn’t work for her.
“I’ve tried it,” the 19-year old 
said. “It doesn’t look good on me anyways.”
Some girls recognize the lack 
of scarlet lips across campus and use it to their advantage.
“It’s red, vibrant and beau-
tiful,” said Janna Knapp, an 18-year-old exploratory fresh-
man. “Not every girl wears it, so 
it makes me stand out.”
Mintz agreed that the swipe of 
color is going to grab someone’s 
attention.
“You’re going to be noticed 
more in red than in, well, white,” 
she said.
Contrary to the study, some 
guys don’t give the color the kiss of approval.
“It’s attractive,” said Sorrel 
Thomson, an 18-year-old explor-
atory freshman, “but it wouldn’t 
make me talk to one girl rather than another.”8, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 5, 2013

a ﬁ  fth-year journalism senior (I couldn’t pass up the “opportunity” for one more football season.)
Health has been ingrained in my sys-
tem since I was born. My mom was pretty strict when it came to having junk food around the house, buying mostly organic foods and even all-natural deodorant. She promoted a preservative-free diet ever since I can remember. Although the Newman-O’s never tasted as delicious as a real Oreo, I am very grateful my mother 
taught me the importance of health at 
such a young age.
Everything I know is an accumulation 
of nine years of yo-yo dieting, binge eat-ing and an obsession with calories. No one should be doing any of the afore-mentioned extremes. It’s unhealthy, ex-hausting and will not take your body anywhere.
I have tried almost every diet during 
its “15 minutes of fame” on the market. Once I would go back to normal eat-ing habits, I would gain back all the lost weight and more.
College threw me for a loop. After 
one too many nights of partying and late-night pizza deliveries, my body decided the Freshman 15 was not enough, and I gained 23 pounds by that summer. On top of the “poor eating habits of a college kid 101,”  I rarely made it to the gym.
LivFit is an effort to share the concept 
of eating and exercising as a lifestyle and not a temporary ﬁ  x. Take the word “diet” out of your vocabulary forever. No mat-ter what age you are, it is never too late to change your life for the better, and I want to help you through it.
It’s important to ﬁ  nd a balance for 
yourself and your individual lifestyle. “Once you can control your mind, you 
can conquer your body.”
I believe the mind is a very powerful 
thing. Once I made the decision to change 
my lifestyle, there was a complete para-digm shift of my outlook on life.
I have since lost all of my college 
weight gain and am in the best shape of my life. I am setting a personal goal to en-ter my ﬁ  rst ﬁ  tness competition in the Na-
tional Physique Committee’s Gainesville 
Classic in the Bikini Division.
This ﬁ  tness, health and wellness col-
umn is dedicated to all of you who can identify with my story and want to trans-form your life for the better. I will be shar-ing with you weekly tips, tricks and ad-vice for all things health and ﬁ  tness.THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 5, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 9
Intro to LivFit  — Hello, health
Let’s start with eating habits. Make it simple. Think calories in versus calories out. 
I’m not saying to count calories. That would be way too tedious and annoying. But 
this will give you a solid starting point. It helps put into perspective food quality and the activity level necessary to lose body fat.
Everyone has what is called a Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR), which is the number 
of calories you burn per day just by being you. To get this estimate, there’s a variety 
of formulas, but use this to give you a better idea of where you are:
HI = Height in Inches  WP = Weight in Pounds
(Taken from http://www.shapesense.com/ﬁ  tness-exercise/calculators/resting-metabolic-rate-calculator.aspx)
So, here’s the deal: As your activity level increases, you burn more calories, 
which in turn makes your body need more. In order to lose body fat, you need to de-
crease the number of calories you are consuming by no more than 300-500 calories under your RMR after your activity level is considered.
For instance, my RMR is 1,512 calories per day. After calculating a rough es-
timate of 500 calories burned during daily exercise, I add that to my RMR to get 2,012. If I wanted to maintain my current body weight, I would consume this number in calories per day. Because I want to lose fat, I eat about 1,500 calories per day. If you decrease your calories by more than 500 calories per day, it is more harmful than good for your body. Eating too little will cause your body to eat your muscle tis-sue for energy and will store your body fat like a bear in hibernation. Unless you’re 
a bear, I don’t think you want that.FIT TIP OF THE WEEK

Morning Fatty’s Andrew White performs at High Dive’s 2nd Annual Wake and Bake Weekend 
on Sunday. The band was followed by Ballyhoo! and headliners Less Than Jake.

I am sitting at my laptop, writing an ar-
ticle, playing the “Morning Murmur” track 
on Coffitivity and intermittently pausing 
to check my Facebook, email, Twitter and 
Tumblr.
Somehow I end up on Buzzfeed, reading 
about the 17 ways out of 25 that I relate to 
someone else, or Huffington Post, finding 
myself underwhelmed by an unsubstantial 
article with a catchy headline.
My phone is sitting next to my computer. 
It’s like my phantom limb that has an itch I 
can’t scratch. Every half hour or so I think I 
see its screen flash out of the corner of my 
eye, so I check it for an alert, only to find no 
new activity. When I am in public and hear 
someone else’s cell sound, it’s a siren song compelling me to check my own. 
But despite my relationship with technol-
ogy, I am not addicted to it.
It doesn’t interfere with my living a “nor-
mal” life. I don’t feel “withdrawal symp-toms” when I am away from it. And I do not 
have people in my life complaining about my behavior and planning interventions.
If I did exhibit such behaviors, it may 
indicate an addiction to alcohol, drugs or 
yes, the Internet, according to Joanne Can-
tor, a professor emerita at the University of 
Wisconsin-Madison, who specializes in the effects of digital technology.
Cantor said in an email she doesn’t think 
we should give up on the Internet entirely.
“We … have to learn how to use it wisely 
so that it doesn’t interfere with important 
things in the rest of our lives, like work, 
sleep, and good relationships,” she said.
Other countries, like Japan, have noticed 
their young populations have an unhealthy 
dependence on the online world and have 
decided to take an unconventional ap-
proach.
Japan’s government is planning to hold 
Internet “fasting” camps staffed by educa-
tion experts who will help children unplug 
from their digital devices and reconnect with 
reality, according to The Daily Telegraph.
The action is a response to a study es-
timating that more than 500,000 Japanese children between the ages of 12 and 18 are 
believed to be addicted to the Internet.The Ministry of Education intends to im-
plement its initiative in the next fiscal year 
to get young people off of their computers, mobile phone and gaming devices.
The fasting retreats will include a steady 
diet of outdoor activities at public facilities where campers will have no access to the 
Internet. Psychiatrists and clinical psycho-
therapists will be on staff to aid in the transi-
tion process.
The initiative basically 
sounds like a routine trip 
to summer camp for a 
bookworm. One is social-
ly pressured to keep the 
books packed and aban-
don the comfort of fiction-
al worlds to join others in 
“real” life.
I imagine these fasting camps are going 
to be like getting a whole bunch of introverts together who are all suffering from with-
drawal and trying to get them to interact with one another in perennially awkward 
activities like trust falls and Twister.
But children in Japan are not the only 
ones who are showing signs of too much face time with glowing screens.
In the U.S., reSTART, the first addiction 
recovery program for Internet addiction 
disorder, opened its doors in 2009, accord-
ing to a news release. The 45-day program 
is aimed at helping adults disengage from the Internet and learn how to lead balanced 
lives.   
However, it may be a while before addic-
tion fasting camps catch on like sushi.
“The digital diet camps and retreats (in 
the U.S.) are geared to older and … more af-
fluent adults because they cost a fair amount 
of money to do them,” said David Green-
field, founder of The Center for Internet and 
Technology Addiction and author of virtual-
addiction.com. 
He said there is nothing like Japan’s pub-
licly funded camps targeted toward young 
people here in the U.S.
Internet addiction disorder is not even 
included in the American Psychiatric Asso-
ciation’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders, though Internet 
gaming disorder is identified in the manual, 
but it needs more clinical research to be con-
sidered a formal disorder.Back away from that cellphone — you could be Internet-addicted

Chatter filled High Dive’s concert 
room as wisps of cigarette smoke from 
the outside bar drifted through the graffiti-covered door. 
The crowd was ready for Less Than 
Jake. 
As the equipment crew finished 
setting up the stage, fans were gently 
pushing their way around the room to 
find the best vantage point to see the night’s main attraction. One loud, dis-torted guitar note pierced the air, and 
the lights shut off.  The crowd erupted.  
Sunday was the beginning of the 
end of High Dive’s second Wake and 
Bake Weekend, a three-night concert series featuring Gainesville’s own Less 
Than Jake. The show also included per-
formances by the Duppies, Morning Fatty and Ballyhoo! Not one band re-ceived a less-than-warm welcome from 
the eager crowd of skinny-jean-wearing 
fanatics.  
“We’re homies with them,” said 
Morning Fatty bassist, John “Pop” Pa-
poulis, regarding the band’s relationship 
with Less Than Jake. “It’s our fourth or fifth time playing with [them].”
Morning Fatty played a high-energy 
show and included their fan-favorite 
ode to dealers, “Street Pharmacist.”  The 
band closed out its set with a unique version of the Beatles’ “Hey Jude” that left the crowd scream-singing the lyr-ics back to the band. You would have 
thought the Beatles themselves were on 
stage.  
“If people keep coming, we’ll keep 
playing,” Pop said.  
When headliners Less Than Jake took the stage, the space front and center turned from a dance floor into a thrash-ing mosh pit.  Some of the crowd mem-bers took a few safety steps backward 
to avoid getting dragged into the vortex 
of flailing limbs and flying drinks.  
From a distance, all you could make 
out was a frenzied cluster of happy drunks and the occasional Converse-
wearing foot of a crowd surfer who 
didn’t quite make it on top.  
The members of Less Than Jake 
seemed to be in the comfort of their own home as they chatted and jabbed 
at each other with some friendly verbal 
abuse on stage. They went on to per-form one of the loudest and longest sets of all the bands.   
UF health science senior Gabrielle 
Lipman came to see Less Than Jake for the first time.
“I didn’t know much about them,” 
the 21-year-old said.  “The way they 
interacted with the audience was really 
personal.”
The outside bar was a refuge for 
those who needed a smoke or a change 
out of their sweat-drenched clothes.  
Upon re-entry, the humid air sucked the breath out of your body as you tried to slide your way through the masses.
Mindy McCulloch, a Dunnellon 
resident, traveled an hour to make it to High Dive for the show.  
“I came the first year and had a good

LAUREN ADAMSON
Avenue Writer
The kids who flocked to see the midnight 
premieres of the Harry Potter movies wearing 
striped scarves, fake glasses and lightning bolts drawn on their foreheads with their mom’s eye-
brow pencils are all grown up.
And like the actors who played their favorite 
book characters, they’ve gone through puberty. 
Young Hermione Grangers learned to tame their hair and wear clothes that didn’t drape over them like capes. And little Harry Potters grew facial hair, lost some of their adorability factor, adopted new voices and started seeing Hermione as a love interest.
And though, depressingly, there are no more 
Harry Potter movie releases left in our future, we can still dress up to show our enduring sup-port for the series. The Black Milk Clothing com-pany, which has a love affair with nylon, will be launching a line of Harry Potter-themed clothing for women Sept. 10.
The collection will include pinstripe leggings 
in your house’s colors with its crest featured 
on the upper-side thigh, one-piece swimsuits, 
house-crest flags and shirts that resemble football jerseys, except they are worn as bum-skimming dresses and show support for fictional Quidditch teams that hold matches in your imagination.
Anthropology major Ayaka Mihara, 21, is a 
fan of Harry Potter and has read all of the books, but she says the clothes are not for her.
“I like clothes that have cute prints, but not 
just Harry Potter,” she said. “It is for literature, 
not for apparel.”
Teasers of models wearing the clothing were 
published on Black Milk’s Facebook page to pro-
mote their release to us Muggles. The photos were picked up by other websites like Geeks are Sexy and Geekologie.The models in the photos wear expressions 
similar to those in a Victoria’s Secret ad: seduc-ing the camera, gazing off hazily, gaping super enthusiastically about something outside of the frame and hungrily staring at something in their hands. But what are expected poses in a lingerie 
catalog come off as contrived and comical when 
a snitch, a quaffle, broomsticks and wands are strategically staged in the shot. I’m surprised the models were not directed to blow Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum or hit each other with licorice wands.
Rhina Maylin Lara, 18, a 
freshman chemistry and Eng-
lish major, said she feels that 
even though the clothes are at-
tractive and provocative, they 
do not hold true to the  books. 
“Hermione Granger 
wouldn’t be caught dead in 
one of those dresses,” she said. However, Lara, who plays chaser for UF’s club Quidditch team added that the swimsuits are very cute, and she wouldn’t mind buying one.
Yet, if you plan to show your loyalty to Harry 
Potter by buying one of these items, it is going to cost you a hefty price. You won’t have to join Dumbledore’s Army, as much as you wish you could, but you will have to sacrifice about $95 for the small covering of nylon fabric.  
Despite being a cynic of the clothing brand’s 
cheesecake photo shoots and steep prices, I’m actually quite fond of the designs. I loved Harry 
Potter when I was 9 and sported a tie, cape, wand 
and poor British accent to school for Halloween, and I still love to express my fandom now that I am too old to trick-or-treat.
And while I agree the character Hermione 
would not wear one of Black Milk’s pieces, I can see 23-year-old Emma Watson owning the look with ferocity, style and winged black eyeliner.Accio couture: Black Milk makes 
Harry Potter magically chicThis column is provided by Ariel Barnes, a 22-year-old majoring 
in international studies. 
Would you like to get some Mediocre Advice?

http://mediocreadvicegators.tumblr.com/ask
Dear Mediocre Advice,
I recently found out my boyfriend of seven months 
exchanges Snapchats more with his ex than he does 
with me. Just for reference, we Snapchat multiple 
times a day every day. When I confronted him about 
it, he got mad at me for lurking and said they only 
send each other cat pictures. Am I overreacting?
Dear Mediocre Advice,
I’ve been talking to this guy for weeks. We went on 
a date, and it went really well. He told me he couldn’t wait to see me again. We talked more after, and then, 
out of nowhere, nothing. I’m completely ignored. He 
fell off the face of the planet or something. What’s 
the deal?
Dear Mediocre Advice,
I’m turning 24 and am still a virgin. Smart and 
average good-looking, but nerdy and likes to stay indoors. Where can I go to meet some ladies? I do 
not want to resort to online dating.Dear Friend,
He probably wasn’t into you anymore or became in-
terested in someone else. People flake for different rea-sons, but don’t overthink this one guy blowing you off. 
Chances are he wasn’t that special. Sure, you went on 
a nice first date, but it was only nice because you can’t actually get to know someone on a first date. Here are all of the horrible things that could have happened on a second date that should make you happy it never hap-pened: You found out he lives under a bridge where the 
sexual predators reside, he reveals he loves Bruno Mars, 
he wears fake eyebrows, he shares a toothbrush with his roommate, he likes to look at himself in the mirror while boning, he’s on the Atkins diet, he only showers twice a week, or he is really comfortable picking his boogers in front of people. There will always be other guys, and this 
one probably sucked anyway.
Ariel Barnes
Dear Friend,
A lot of people send mass Snapchats of ridicu-
lously stupid things, so this may not be the Snapchat 
tryst you’re thinking of. Your overreaction depends 
on how long ago and how intense their relationship 
was. If it’s nothing, he should feel fine showing you the cat Snapchats from her. This is probably a good time to alert everyone that cats have taken over the Internet and now are our favorite apps. They’re planning something. I know it.
Dear Friend,
It sounds like you just want to lose your virginity. Don’t 
go to a bar or wherever and expect a random girl to sleep with you. Despite popular belief, a lot of girls like to go 
out and be social with no intention of talking to guys who 
are just trying to get it in, so try not to make a fool of yourself when you hit on girls. Although you are a bit of a late bloomer, don’t go on a mission to lose your virgin-ity. You can avoid the hard way of learning this lesson by watching “The 40-Year-Old-Virgin.” As I recall, the moral 
of the story was: Do not go on speed dates, boobs do not 
feel like bags of sand, you should sell all of your old stuff on eBay, and it’s worth waiting for someone you like. So, make a change. Say yes to going out more often, and make new friends. Branch out, see who you meet, and maybe something will happen. Maybe a friend will hook 
you up and all of your nonvirgin dreams will come true 
and so on.THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 5, 2013

Miami running back Duke Johnson (8) attempts to avoid Florida Atlantic defensive back D’Joun Smith during 
the ﬁ  rst half of an NCAA college football game on Aug. 30, in Miami Gardens, Fla. Johnson had a career-high 186 rushing yards and a touchdown as Miami defeated Florida Atlantic 34-6.

Alligator Staff Writer @joe_morgan
D.J. Humphries (right MCL sprain) returned to 
practice on Wednesday, coach Will Muschamp said 
during the weekly Southeastern Conference Coach-es Media Teleconference.
Muschamp began the week by announcing that 
the offensive tackle would miss practice Monday and return in a limited fashion Tuesday before be-coming a “full go” on Wednesday.
Dominique Easley (ﬂ  u) re-
turned to practice on Tuesday af-ter missing Monday, and Darrin Kitchens (oblique strain) is still expected to play against Miami.
Humphries’ return puts Flor-
ida in good shape heading into Saturday’s game at Sun Life Sta-dium. After numerous injuries forced the Gators to alter their 
spring game format in April, Jon Halapio (partially torn pectoral muscle) is Florida’s lone injuredstart-er.
“We had some offensive linemen miss spring 
ball, but since the start of camp, this is probably the 
healthiest we’ve been,” coach Will Muschamp said. 
“…We should be good to go heading into the game Saturday.”
Storm front: A quick look at the numbers shows 
Miami’s defensive front struggled in 2012. 
The Hurricanes ranked last in the Atlantic Coast 
Conference and 114th nationally in rush defense, allowing 217.9 yards per game. The group did not prove much better in the pass rush, tallying only 13 
sacks in 12 games for an average of 1.08 per game.
However, Florida is not underestimating Mi-
ami’s defensive front. Muschamp likes the return-ing talent UM boasts in a scheme similar to that of 
UF.
“They mix odd and even fronts,” Muschamp 
said. “Four down and three down, very similar to what we do.”
Offensive coordinator Brent Pease believes the 
familiarity with that style should beneﬁ  t Florida’s offense, which will have starting running back Matt Jones (viral infection) back in the fold on Saturday.
“They do a lot of different mixtures of schemes 
on you,” Pease said. “They are able to get into an odd front without subbing guys in, which is what our defense can do, so I think we’ve got some good reps on that.”
Counting on Koehne: Kyle Koehne was the 
epitome of Florida’s “man down, man up” mantra in 2012.
He started only three games — all at right tackle 
— but played in all 13, bouncing all over the line during the Gators’ 11-2 season. 
“The versatility has gotten me on the ﬁ  eld faster 
than just playing at one spot,” Koehne said. Florida regaining 
health after early rash of injuries
 PHIL HEILMAN
Alligator Staff Writer @phillip_heilman
With the speed and power of a run-
away freight train, Miami’s Duke John-
son is almost impossible to stop on a football ﬁ  eld. 
The sophomore running back opened 
the season by blistering Florida Atlantic to the tune of 19 carries for a career-high 186 yards and a touchdown before leaving the game with concussion-like symptoms on Friday. 
For Johnson, the performance was 
far from unexpected. The 5-foot-9, 196-pound tailback surpassed 100 rush-ing yards in a game on four separate 
occasions as a freshman in 2012 and en-
tered this season as a Heisman Trophy hopeful.  
Limiting Johnson, the nation’s lead-
ing rushing after his explosive ﬁ  rst week of the season, is critical for the No. 12 Gators when they face the Hurricanes on Saturday at noon in Sun Life Stadium. 
“That guy can put his foot in the 
ground and change the score on any down,” defensive coordinator D.J. Dur-kin said. “He has great running-back skills. He ﬁ  nishes runs, he’s physical, (and) he runs inside the tackles really well, too.”
Dating back to last season, Johnson 
has accumulated 1,181 all-purpose yards 
and eight touchdowns during his last 
ﬁ  ve games. Behind him and senior quar-terback Stephen Morris, Miami’s offense has racked up more than 500 yards of of-fense in each of its past three contests. 
“He’s always been special,” said 
Quinton Dunbar, who grew up playing football against Johnson in South Flori-da. “It’s nothing new.”
But the sophomore sensation could 
be in for a tough game against a Gators defense that is stingy versus the run. 
Florida has the eighth-ranked rush-
ing defense in the country after limiting Toledo to only 50 yards on the ground during a 24-6 victory on Saturday. In 2012, the Gators were No. 4 in rushing defense, allowing a sparse 94.5 rushing 
yards per game. 
“It takes 11 guys,” Durkin said. “Ob-
viously, we understand what we’re up 
against with him, and he’s a point of em-phasis. That’s a guy they’re going to get the ball in his hands. It’s got to be a team effort and everyone doing their job.”
The return of linebacker Antonio 
Morrison, who was suspended for Flor-ida’s season opener against Toledo fol-lowing a pair of offseason arrests, should prove helpful to the UF defense. 
In addition to providing depth for the 
linebacker unit, Morrison offers a skill set that is particularly important when defending a running back as talented as Johnson. 
“He brings a certain physicality to 
our football team,” Will Muschamp said of Morrison. “He’s a very good commu-
nicator at the linebacker position, which 
for us is critical.”
Muschamp tried to persuade John-
son, who helped Miami Norland High win the Class 5A championship in 2012 by rushing for 1,957 yards and 29 touch-downs as a senior, to reconsider his com-mitment to the Hurricanes prior to his freshman season. But after missing out 
on Johnson, Florida’s third-year coach 
will have the challenge of stopping him.
“He’s a guy that can take the ball 
anywhere,” Muschamp said. “He sticks his foot in the ground and gets the ball north and south.”
Gators focused on slowing ‘Canes tailback
“[Johnson] has great running-
back skills. He ﬁ  nishes runs.”

“So I learned to use it as an advantage of 
mine. It’s a good thing for me.”
His role looks to be more of the same in 
2013. 
Koehne started at right guard for injured 
senior Jon Halapio (torn pectoral muscle) in 
Florida’s season-opening win against Tole-do and is listed as the backup center to Jon Harrison.
“He knows all the spots,” offensive co-
ordinator Brent Pease. 
“He’s kind of the guy across the board 
that causes a ripple effect. You know, he’s important to us.”
Learning the responsibilities of multiple 
positions may sound daunting, but Koehne insists that in the grand scheme of the of-fense, it is not all that difﬁ  cult.
“It’s all about how you learn the of-
fense,” Koehne said. 
“You don’t want to learn it by one spe-
ciﬁ  c position. You want to learn the whole offense, conceptually. You always want 
to know what your buddy’s doing next to 
you. The whole time I’ve been learning the offense, I’ve been learning what the centers do and the tackles do, so I can know what I do better.”
Although Pease enjoys the luxury of 
a versatile guy like Koehne, the offensive coordinator acknowledges that UF should proceed with caution. 
Overusing Koehne at any one spot can 
jeopardize his availability elsewhere, espe-cially at center.
“He’s such a hard worker, and he’s just 
steady,” Pease said. 
“But there was games last year, we’re 
beating Tennessee and somebody else where he’s playing tackle. OK, now all of a sudden, he’s guard. 
“And [offensive line coach Tim Davis] 
rested him a little bit there and played [Ian Silberman] because, you know, we’ve got to be careful with ourselves, because if Jonot-than Harrison goes down, I mean, Kyle’s got to step in at center.”

NOTEBOOK , from page 15AS STEIN ON TV
Florida-Miami was once 
a huge rivalry, but you wouldn’t know it if you 
looked at the schedules from the last decade. The two teams 
have played each other only 
ﬁ  ve times this century. All but one of those were during the Ron Zook era.
Now that we’re about to 
see the newest addition to this once-storied rivalry, younger fans may be wondering, ‘Why is Florida-Miami a big deal?”
It’s not a conference game, 
and the Hurricanes haven’t been good of late. So why isn’t this just another game on the schedule?
Well, obviously, Florida and 
Miami share the state. Gators fans and Hurricanes fans grow up as each others’ neighbors, 
attend their respective schools 
and have to deal with each oth-er on a day-to-day basis. This engenders spite between the fan bases. 
And when the teams have 
played, they have been evenly matched. 
Right now, Miami leads the 
all-time series 28-26. The Gators and Hurricanes played annu-ally from 1939 until 1987 with a year off in 1943, so that gave the teams time to build up a hearty dislike of each other.
Miami has the hot hand in 
the series, winning six of the 
last seven, but Florida won 
the most recent game — a 26-3 home victory in 2008.
Also, the two teams compete 
for young talent in one of the top recruiting hotbeds in the nation — South Florida.
The fertile ﬁ  elds of Dade, Bro-
ward and Palm Beach County are right in Miami’s backyard, but Florida has a large enough presence in the south to sway recruits to travel up the Florida Turnpike to Gainesville.
But aside from general dis-
like and competitiveness, there 
have been plenty of incidents 
on the ﬁ  eld that have sparked animosity between the two teams.
To get your ri-
valry juices ﬂ  ow-ing, here are three 
of the most notable 
games between the Gators and the Hurricanes.
1971 — 45-16 
Florida: Neither team was par-ticularly great this year — both ﬁ  nished 4-7. The Gators man-aged to blow out the Hurricanes 
early in the game, but it wasn’t 
the ﬁ  nal score that stuck a thorn in Miami’s side.This game 
was the last of the season, and UF quarterback John Reaves was aim-
ing to break Jim 
Plunkett’s NCAA record for passing yards. 
The Hurri-
canes had the ball late in the game with Reaves only 14 yards short of the record. After using their timeouts to keep the 
game going, Florida’s defend-
ers dropped to the ground to allow Miami to score so the UF offense could get the ball back.
Reaves found Carlos Alva-
rez for a 15-yard completion to set the record, and the entire team jumped into a fountain at 
the Orange Bowl to celebrate. 
The play, known as the “Gator Flop,” still angers Hurricanes fans, even though Reaves’ re-cord has been passed multiple times.
2003 — 38-33 Hurricanes: 
The return of Brock Berlin. Ber-lin began his college career with 
the Gators, joining coach Steve 
Spurrier’s 2000 recruiting class. 
But when Spurrier bolted 
for the Washington Redskins in 2002 and Zook took over, Berlin took his talents to Coral Gables.
The Gators pounded the 
Hurricanes in the ﬁ  rst half, jumping out to a 33-10 lead half-
way through the third quarter 
while intercepting Berlin twice. 
But Berlin went on an 18-for-
20 tear, picking apart the Florida secondary and Gator chomping his way to a 38-33 win.
1984 — 32-20 Hurricanes:
This game should have been all Miami. The Hurricanes were 
coming off a national title sea-
son, and the Gators had enough injuries to make this year’s Yan-kees’ suffering look tame.
Miami boasted Orange Bowl 
MVP Bernie Kosar. Florida started walk-on quarterback Kerwin Bell, who was eighth 
on the Gators’ depth chart at 
one point.
Bell nearly pulled off the 
upset victory, tossing a go-ahead touchdown pass with 41 seconds remaining. But Kosar staged a last-minute comeback, 
leading a 76-yardscoring drive.
Bell attempted a last-ditch 
touchdown play, but his pass 
was intercepted and returned for a touchdown to seal the 32-20 defeat.
In the stands that day was 
a young Will Muschamp, who will now get a chance to leave 
his own legacy on the Florida-
Miami rivalry.
