Alligator alum
talks comedy
ByCJ PRUNER
Alligator Staff Writer
J. Hunter Sizemore/ Alligator
UF alumnus and Miami Herald columnist Carl Hiaasen, who also worked for the Independent Florida
Alligator as a student, speaks in Pugh Hall on Tuesday night.In most cases, corrupt politi-
cians, drunken surgeons and ra-
bid monkeys on the loose don't
mesh well.
However, when Carl Hiaasen
steps into the room, the combina-
tion seems natural as he shares
stories from his work as a best-
selling author and award-win-
ning columnist for the Miami
Herald.
Speaking in front of about 350
people at Pugh Hall, Hiaasen dis-
cussed topics ranging from mun-
dane statewide budget issues
to bizarre legislation regarding
romantic relations between men
and goats.
Hiaasen noted how some peo-
ple may perceive his style to be
eccentric and cynical.
But he emphasized how his
role is to make sure people in
public positions are held account-
able.
"When you start acceptingweasely behavior. you've sur-
rendered," he said.
An alumnus of UF's College of
Journalism and Communications,
Hiaasen spoke fondly of his time
as a writer for the Alligator.
"It was a great time for politi-
cal satire," Hiaasen recalled. "You
had Nixon, (Henry) Kissinger,
John Mitchell. it was a parade of
knuckleheads."
"When you start accepting
weasely behavior.you've
surrendered."
Carl Hiaasen
Author and columnist
Myra Eddy came to the show
with her son, Thom, a graduate
of the College of Journalism and
Communications, and her grand-
son, James. She was entertained
by Hiaasen's dry humor and said
she has read all of his books.
"It's a little raunchy, but it
makes me laugh out loud," she
N Fla tobacco trial begins
E S. FLA. VERDICTS HAVE REACHED
$300M IN COMPENSATIONS.
By KATHERINE BEIN
Alligator Writer
Opening arguments were made in the first
trial against Big Tobacco in North Florida since
the Florida Supreme Court found the industry
liable for cigarette-related deaths in 2006.
Amanda Jean Hall, represented by Rod
Smith, accused R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and
other major tobacco companies for the wrong-
ful death of her husband, Arthur Hall, who
died from lung cancer in 1995.
In his opening argument, Smith blamed R. J.
Reynolds for misleading Arthur Hall and other
smokers about the dangers of cigarette smok-
ing, therefore being responsible for his illness
and eventual death.In their rebuttal, R.J. Reynolds, represented
by Dennis Murphy, argued the burden of proof
is on Amanda Hall to prove cigarette smoking
killed her husband and that it was Big Tobac-
co's fault her husband didn't quit.
In 2006, the Supreme Court found cigarettes
to be "unreasonably" dangerous, to cause nu-
merous types of cancer, that nicotine is addic-
tive and that Big Tobacco knew about the dan-
gers and acted negligently.
Special The Supreme Court ruling
Report stated Big Tobacco was liable for
smoking-related injuries or deaths,
and although it reversed a jury's verdict to
award $145 billion in damages, it allows smok-
ers and their loved ones to seek individual cases
against the companies.
Though this is the first trial to come from the
Engle decision in North Florida, jury verdicts
in South Florida have reached $300 million in
compensations awarded to date.LOCAL
City honors women
By MINCH MINCHIN
Alligator Writer
For Gainesville Mayor Pegeen Han-
rahan, being a woman has been worth
more than $100,000 of campaign dona-
tions.
As part of the second annual Wom-
en's History Month event sponsored
by Florida Women in Business and
Students in Free Enterprise, Hanahan
talked to about 25 business school un-
dergraduates in Bryan Hall on Tues-
day night.
She spoke about the benefits of be-
ing a woman in the business and po-litical spheres.
"For whatever reason, people op-
erate under the as-
sumption that being
a woman is a disad-
vantage when run-
ning for public of-
fice," Hanrahan said
o the all-female au-
dience. "But it is the
Hanrahan exact opposite."
Having a defense
mechanism ready, such as wit or sar-
casm, can be helpful for dealing with
sexism, she said.

Former FBI agent to
speak about security
By MINCH MINCHIN
Alligator Writer
Randall Murch cannot share his secrets
from classified missions he was involved in
as an FBI agent.
But he will be speaking at 7:30 tonight
in the Pugh Hall Ocora about the criminal
surveillance lessons he learned over more
than 25 years in the FBI and Department of
Homeland Security.
Murch is the associate director of research
program development at Virginia Tech's
Center for Technology Security, and Policy.
He will discuss how the U.S. government
tracks suspected criminals in order to keep
its citizens safe.
"I'm going to talk about how surveillance
is used and the societal implications," Murch
said in a phone interview Tuesday. "I'm then
going to let the audience decide for them-
selves what we should do."
Since Sept. 11, American society has be-
come more acclimated to increasing levels
of public surveillance, he said. As this trend
continues, policymakers must be careful tomaintain a proper balance between safety
and the preservation of civil liberties, he
said.
"I'm going to talk about how sur-
veillance is used and the societal
implications. I'm then going to let
the audience decide for them-
selves what we should do."

The speech, which is sponsored by Cen-
ter for Humanities in the Public Sphere at
UF, is the third lecture in a four-part series
on identity-tracking technologies.
Murch is traveling from Virginia. He will
not be paid for his speech, but the Center for
Humanities in the Public Sphere at UF will
cover travel costs.

Tuesday's Senate meeting was all about hello and

newly elected Senators took their seats in the chambers.
The names of the new Senate president and president
pro-tempore were not available at press time.
Former Student Alliance Sen. Emily Hunt, who repre-

remember that they are all there for the same reason, and
much can be accomplished through just listening and co-
operating with members of other SG parties.
"Something that I've really strived for here is to get
along with everyone," Hunt said.
Ashton Charles, Student Body president-elect, en-
couraged senators to work together and be civil to each
other as they work for students' needs.
"We're all people, and I think all people should be

lice at Corry Village Tuesday at about 9:45
p.m.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando said thestudent, whose identity was not released

Neighbors called police at about 8:17

the apartment, Orlando said.
The University Police Department went
to the apartment and tried negotiating
with the student for about an hour, Or-lando said.
The student confronted them with a
pipe and a knife, Orlando
On said.
CampuS After police tried to subdue
the student with a taser and a
bean bag round, which delivers non-lethal
blows, the student continued to struggle,
he said.Police shot the student at around 9:45
p.m., he said.
The student's condition was not known

Children read books, paint faces at Dr. Seuss celebration
UF elementary education graduate student Barbara Ogden stands on the corner of Northwest 34th Street
and Eighth Avenue in a Cat in the Hat suit Tuesday for a Read Across America event at Westside Park.By ASHLEY HEMMY
Alligator Contributing Writer
The sun did not shine, but it
wasn't too wet to play at a celebra-
tion for Dr. Seuss' 106th birthday
Tuesday afternoon at Westside
Park.
Eight-year-old Ellie Donelan
enjoys reading Dr. Seuss books, so
when she saw the Cat in the Hat
greeting children at the event, she
ran over to him.
UF's Florida Education Associ-
ation, a part of the National Educa-
tion Association, threw the party
celebrating Read Across America
Day, which always falls on Seuss'
birthday and encourages children
to read, said Laura Roberts, the
association's president.
The organization gave away
books to about 60 children, Rob-
erts said.
Children sat at picnic tables to
eat snacks, do crossword puzzles
and look through more than 300
books donated by professors from
the UF College of Education.
"This is so much fun and it
puts something really fun into
your day," Ellie said. "And I've
been looking for something new
to read."The Florida Education Associa-
tion has been planning this event
since October and advertised the
birthday party on local radio sta-
tions.
Members of Kappa Delta Pi,
an education honor society, also
helped at the party.
Jaclyn Savino, the president
of Kappa Delta Pi at UF, said the
event provided an opportunity
for education majors to work in
the community.
She said some students in
Gainesville may not be able to af-
ford books but should still be ex-
posed to reading at a young age.
The rain and cold weather did
not prevent families from coming
to meet the Cat in the Hat.
Ben Wise, father of 5-year-old
Henry and 4-year-old Spencer,
said the event was great for his
kids.
"They can see that other people
enjoy reading besides their dad,"
Wise said.
Earlier on Tuesday, volunteers
from the UF's Florida Education
Association and Club Creole read
to five first grade classes at Idyl-
wild Elementary.
They also made Cat in the Hat
hats with the children.

But she said sexism is becoming rare.
"This is an extraordinary time for women in
leadership, whether it is in business or academia,"
Hanrahan said.
She said women are more likely to vote and go
to college, and being a woman in the workplace is
easier than ever.
Some gender-specific challenges will never go
away, she said.
"I highly recommend running for office while
being pregnant," she said. "And going into a busi-
ness meeting and having baby snot on your shoul-der. Those are just the kinds of things you will have
to work with."
The future of gender relations in the workplace
is bright, she said.
"For women in your age range, the men should
be just fabulous," she said with a
Local wink.
News Event organizer Sarah Hudson
said she plans to invite a similar
speaker to next year's celebration.
"It was really good to have a successful woman
who went to UF who is still in the community,"
Hudson said. "Being a woman is not a disadvan-
tage."

Van-napping
Alligator hopes its van
will be returned
Asadow descended upon the Alligator staff Monday
As we sat in our offices, diligently slaving over
computer screens to produce Tuesday's paper, a villain with a
thirst for mayhem stole our distribution van right from under
our noses.
The vehicle, henceforth affectionately referred to
as Van, was minding his own business in the park-
ing lot just last night when he was purloined.
Those who spotted him later thought he was being driven
lawfully. But he was being taken against his will. (We're
sure he would have screamed for help had his hood not been
latched.)
Put yourself in Van's tires. You're sleeping on your com-
fortable concrete slab, resting before a long morning of bring-
ing joy to the hearts of Alligator readers, and all of a sudden
someone snatches you away. Imagine how scared you'd be.
That's why we're asking whoever took Van to return him
-unharmed, of course. We can assure you none of us will
sleep until he's safely returned.
We use him to deliver the paper, and without him our
distributors are forced to carry mounds of papers for miles
and miles on foot (OK, not really, but you get the point).
We don't know if it was a reader with a taste for mischief, a
slighted source with a grudge or just a local hoodlum who
needs some extra space to haul other stolen goods (or a grow
house). All we know is that he's gone, and we need him back.
If you know anything concerning Van or his whereabouts,
please call the Alligator office at 352-376-4446. In the mean
time, check our Web site, where we'll let you know if he is
found so you can stop your tireless searches.
Too Little, Too LateA s of Tuesday, nearly
800 people have died
s a result of the earth-
quake in Chile. Individuals
and corporations alike are
coming to the aid of victims
any way they can. But it's
frustrating to watch as some
mask avarice with fake gen-
erosity.
Saturday, Walmart an-
nounced its ostensibly noble
commitment to give a million
dollars for "emergency relief
efforts throughout the coun-
try." Normal people like us
don't have a million dollars
to give, so, initially, this seems
generous of them.
However, as pointed out
by Huffington Post commen-
tator John Perkins, Walmart's
profits verge on $5 billion per
quarter, and they're growing
every day.
With profits like this and
the fact that barely a year ago
Walmart merged with Chile's
largest food retailer and nowowns more than half of it, Per-
kins points out that Walmart's
donation is "less than their
equivalent of a dime."
"The Widow's Offering"
parable comes to mind. Sure,
Walmart gave what we con-
sider a great sum of money,
but the amount is embarrass-
ing when you think about it.
Despite the fact that there
have been documentaries
and countless articles written
about the greedy and unfair
practices of Walmart, it re-
mains a public giant. Most
people hear about the things
Walmart does and say, "That's
terrible!" but head there the
next time they want cheaper
DVDs or cookies at 3 a.m.
Walmart can be conve-
nient and cheap for a college
student, but is it really worth
it to continue feeding the cor-
porate monster? When there
is some other place to go,
we're going to start bypassing
Walmart.

'Wasteful' spending not always bad
s I grow older and have more things to pay for,I find that money has taken on an increased sig-
nificance in my life. When I was younger, having
money was never really that big of a deal. This was be-
cause it was my parent's money and I was a greedy little
candy addict. When I did have some coins and bills, it
barely stayed in my pocket before I blew it on some choc-
olate or Twizzlers. Nowadays, I still live off my parents
but have come to appreciate the almighty dollar a little
bit more. However, when I hear about people blowing
millions of dollars on comic books, as two anonymous
buyers did for the original Superman and Batman com-
ics last week, I am not stunned at how people can spend
so much money on so little. Rather, I applaud someone
for spending the money on a hobby or personal dream,
as long as it does not hurt someone else.
For people who have not read the story, last Monday
a very rare issue of Action Comics #1, the debut of Su-
perman, was sold for a then-record $1 million dollars.
Then, three days later, Detective Comics #27 sold for
$1,075,500, the current record. Although this in no way
influences my opinion on the matter, I love comic books.
One of the remaining vestiges of my childhood is this
nerdy, slightly embarrassing infatuation. I could debate
on who the best superhero is all day (Superman takes
it by a hair over Spiderman) and break down the truly
superhuman qualities of the Incredible Hulk's pants.
However, I would have this same opinion for anything
so extravagant that sold for such a high price. I am not
arguing people should spend their money on something
that is evil or hateful. While it seems ridiculous to waste
large amounts of money on really, really old pieces of
printed paper, I feel that it is commendable that these
anonymous collectors are that devoted to spending their
money on something that interests them and not being
deterred by what others may think.
Yes, I can definitely think of a million other thingsJoshua Lee
letters@alligator orgthat I could waste that money
on other than old comic books (a
couple billion packets of Ramen
soup or a four year supply Fresh-
ens smoothies are the first things
that come to mind). However, these
collectors are spending their mon-
ey on something that makes them
happy and that they are interested
in. I should be the first one to de-
ride these collectors for their seemingly wasteful spend-
ing habits. Money is of constant importance to me as a
financially-strapped college student (and by financially-
strapped, I mean I am living off of my debit card and the
only thing of value in my wallet is a coupon for $5 off at
T.G.I. Friday's). I could never imagine spending such an
amount of money on comic books, even though they are
my now not-so-secret shame.
However, when I look at people spending such
amounts to obtain something that is truly in their own
interest, it becomes clear to me that the definition of
wealth and how to spend that fortune is different for
every person. Some people spend their money on
cars, boats, and water balloon fights while others have
mouths to feed and bodies to keep warm. Others donate
their money to humanitarian causes and some blow it
on comic books. As long as it doesn't hurt someone else,
people should have the right to spend their money on
their own harmless interests. Especially in the midst of
the current economic problems that face this country,
it is understandable that the knee-jerk reaction to news
of people spending millions on comics would be nega-
tive. Although people are quick to criticize the buyers or
shake their heads at the purchase, I applaud these col-
lectors for spending their money on something that they
love.

Americans sho
wo capital cities will make history this
week as they join the exclusive club of
five states and seven countries that al-
low same-sex marriages.
Following Congress' failure to reject Mayor
Adrian Fenty's bill to allow gay marriage in the
nation's capital and Chief Justice John Roberts'
refusal to intervene, Washington, D.C., will
join other capitals across the globe, including
Madrid, Ottawa, Oslo and Stockholm, as it be-
gins to recognize gay marriages today.
More surprisingly, Mexico City is poised
to begin recognizing gay marriages Thursday,
which remains a shock for the staunchly con-
servative, Roman Catholic-dominated region.
However, Mexico's federal government
appealed to the country's Supreme Court in an
effort to deal gay and lesbian couples another
blow to achieving basic human rights -rightsuld give gay co
many straight couples take for granted.
Thankfully, the country's Supreme Court
recently rejected a similar measure brought
to it by the governors of three Mexican states
who worried the new law would force them to
recognize the gay marriages.
For the record, the law would do no such
thing in Mexico City or Washington, D.C.
The laws wouldn't affect anyone except the
gay couples who simply want to publicly cel-
ebrate their love for one another.
The laws wouldn't taint the "sanctity of
marriage" heterosexual couples hold so dear.
And by "sanctity," I'm referencing, with
no particular emphasis, Elizabeth Taylor's
eight different marriages to seven men, Britney
Spears' 55-hour marriage and the divorce rate
creeping up to nearly 50 percent in the U.S.

Eye of the Beholder
Gainesville woman relives past, looks to future
By JARED MISNER
Alligator Staff Writer
Jmisner@alligator org
When the neighbors heard her screaming,
they thought it was just another stray cat.
It wasn't until a woman walking her dog
found her the next morning, run over, raped
and lef I to rot they realized the cries of agony,
the cries for mercy were from a woman cling-
ing to life.
But as she lay dying in the street, Marvene
Edwards still had eight lives left. This wasn't
the last time she would cheat death. This
wasn't the last time she would muster the un-
fathomable tenacity to keep going.
It was in the early hours of a Saturday
morning in December, just before Edwards'
32nd birthday in Princeton, Fla., a town with
a population of about 11,000, where black and
Hispanic residents outnumber their white
counterparts by more than 4 to 1. It is a town
where the percentage of people living below
the poverty line in 2008 was nearly double
Florida's average. It is a town swept up and
silenced by the sand and spice of neighboring
Miami just 23 miles to the northeast.
She was wearing a white fur coat as she left
a nightclub alone sometime after 2 a.m. and
walked down a dirt road used more by sex-
crazed adolescents looking for a place to park
than for any kind of driving.
And it would be here on that dirt road,
within an hour, where Edwards would be
raped. And it would later be here on that tire-
grooved gravel road where a .22-caliber bul-
let would both destroy and save her life as it
barreled through her right eye, ricocheting
through her right hand and out through the
left side of her skull, creating a nickel-sized
hole where now just a thin layer of skin and
tightly braided black hair protect her brain.
"It can't end like this," she thought. She
had children she hadn't said goodbye to. She
had a family, a job and a life to live.
Flash.
Her head was shrouded in blood-bathed
bandages, her right eye socket bare, her mem-
ory obliterated as she awoke in a hospital bed
more than three days later.
"I knew I lost my eye, but I didn't remem-
ber anything," Edwards recalled.
Flash.
After she left the nightclub that Saturday
morning, a van sped down the dirt road past
Edwards, its tires crunching the pebbles em-
bedded in the road. She thought nothing of it
until the van raced back around so close to her
it forced her into a nearby bush.
Two Hispanic men started yelling at the
31-year-old mother of four to get in the van.
"The first thought in my mind was, 'He
gon' rape me,"' Edwards said. "And I wasn't
gon' make a fuss because I wanted to get out
alive."
The men repeatedly clubbed Edwards on
her upper lip with the butt of a gun, cracking
teeth and slashing lips. They punched Ed-
wards incessantly, demanding drug money
she didn't have while she begged for mercy
and pleaded with the men they had the wrong
woman.
"No one's listening to you," Edwards said.
"All they care about is their merchandise."
Then Edwards'nightmare got worse as the
men "snatched up" her clothes and raped her,
fracturing her pelvis as they shoved anything
they could find inside her.
"Every way you think I could be raped,
they did to me," Edwards said.
And these were the memories from a wom-
an who doctors said would never amount toanything more than a vegetable if she ever
awoke from her coma.
Edwards remembered the men finally
giving up on her beaten, bruised and blood-
ied body after one of them stabbed her in the
stomach. She remembered how the worst was
yet to come.
"Once these people know you don't have
what they want and that you've seen all these
things they've done, they can't let you get out
alive. They throw you up against a tree because
they can't allow blood to get all over their car,"
Edwards said. "And then they shoot you."
Flash.
A point-blank gunshot wound to the face
was just the beginning for Edwards.
As she slept in her foreign hospital bed,
Edwards' blood-blotched hospital gauze cov-
ering her eye and skull had been laced with
a poison so new, so deadly in 1987, it would
later put Edwards on a death mission. Her life-
saving, and potentially life-destructing, blood
transfusion was unintentionally tainted with
ITV.
Flash.
Edwards, now 54, walks out from her
kitchen in east Gainesville as her white front
door, marred black toward the bottom, budges
and squeaks open after just the right amount
of force. The smell of freshly fried catfish and
hushpuppies wafts out into her front yard.
She's wearing a baby blue smock atop a long-
sleeved white thermal, blue jeans so worn
there's no blue left, a silver necklace with the
words "Friends Forever" etched on the heart-
shaped pendant and a perfectly matched choc-
olate brown glass eye in her right eye socket.
"I've done crazy things with my eye,"
Edwards said, as she slapped her knee andleaned back on her sofa, laughing.
And this is the woman who once just want-
ed to die more than anything in the world,
joking about her glass eye as she leans over
to allow a quick touch of the spongy part of
her skull where a bullet once ravaged its way
through.
"She's a walking miracle," said Quinton
Williams, one of Edwards' four children.
The fact that Williams is sitting on Ed-
wards' ordinary blue sofa in her ordinary liv-
ing room, watching "Legion" on an ordinary
Wednesday evening is a miracle in itself.
Because everything wasn't always this fun-
ny. Everything wasn't always this ordinary.
Edwards awoke like a child in Jackson Me-
morial Hospital, forced to relearn how to walk
and talk after waking up from being shot in
the face.
But even living a child's life was miracu-
lous. Just by waking up, she had cheated death
one more time. Her nine lives were dwindling
quickly.
Doctors joked with Edwards, saying the
only way she could have survived a bullet fly-
ing through her skull was if God moved her
brain aside.
Edwards never thought of this as a joke.
She knew this was nothing short of the truth.
"They called me 'The Miracle Patient,"' Ed-
wards said, as her right eye stared unwaver-
ingly, artificially.
After relearning how to walk and talk dur-
ing about six months of intensive rehabilita-
tion, Edwards found herself fighting to get her
own children back from protective services
who had taken them while Edwards was in
her comatose state.
"At the time I found out where they were,
m"a- 11- ball/ millatuf atl
Marvene Edwards poses for a portrait in her home in east Gainesville on Tuesday
night.I had found out I was I-iV-positive," Edwards
said. "I thought they were better off. I aban-
doned my children; I really did."
And to cope, Edwards turned to drugs and
transformed into Peaches, her cocaine-snort-
ing, crack-smoking alter ego.
"The drugs, they hide the pain; they cam-
ouflage everything," Edwards said. "It makes
for an easy way out."
And that was Edwards' life for more than
10 years -drugs. This was Edwards' escape
from her reality as an HIV-positive, leper-like
societal blister, she said. This was her escape
from her inability to escape life.
"That was what life was about -the next
hit," Edwards said. "You wake up wondering
where you gon' find the next hit. You live for
the next hit. Basically, you work for the drug.
You work hard day and night, overtime for
the drug."
The multitude of drug homes Edwards
lived in during the '90s, letting drugs flow in
and out freely like sleazy motel guests, landed
her in trouble more than once.
The criminal charges, including a handful
of cocaine-related third- and second-degree
felonies fall easily off Edwards' tongue, and
Edwards isn't bashful to admit them. Because
Peaches is dead now.
The past is dead now.
"I could smell flesh burning, I was that
close to hell," Edwards said of her "drinkin'-
and-druggin' past. "When I did drugs, I saw
demonic things in the mirror."
This was rock bottom. She might as well
have been dead, she thought. And death was
all she wanted.
"I drank. I did drugs. I OD'd a few times. I
was on a suicide mission," Edwards said. "Ev-
erything I did, I wouldn't die."
Edwards still had a couple of lives to burn.
That was seven years ago. That was the last
anyone saw of Peaches.
"She bent way over, but she didn't break,"
said Donzella Latimer, Edwards' older sister.
"God didn't want her to break."
God had other plans for Edwards.
"Until the world knows about me, I'm not
going anywhere," Edwards said, as she dis-
cussed her mission to "stomp out" the stigma
surrounding the disease that's raged a ruthless
war on her immune system for more than 20
years.
Edwards is now president of Positives
Empowering Positives, an organization in
Gainesville designed to uplift those living
with I-IV/AIDS and help those infected and
affected with the disease realize there's more
to life than being HIV positive.
But not everything is so easy for the wom-
an who's living on one of her last lives, the
woman who freely admits every birthday is
extra special.
Edwards estimated she's known almost 10
people who have died from the same disease
that could potentially kill her.
"It's painful. Especially when you know
them, you've played with them, you've
laughed with them. It's painful," Edwards
said. "Sometimes a good cry has to come."
Edwards lives in a different world. It is a
world where people are distinguished by be-
ing positive or negative. It is a world where
her life is governed by so many daily pills that
she remembers them by color rather than by
name.
Amid the T-cell counts, the twice-daily
cocktails of medication and the constant en-
counters with those who treat her like a leper,
even at church, Edwards still finds time to
live.
"It's not the end of the world unless you
want it to be," she said. "I got too much livin'
to do."

Florida falls at home to Vanderbilt
0 GUARD KENNY BOYNTON MISSED WIDE-OPEN
THREE-POINTER IN THE FINAL SECONDS.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
Florida got off a shot in the final seconds this time but
couldn't get it to fall.
Down by two with 10 seconds to go, freshman guard
Kenny Boynton missed an open three-pointer, and No. 13
Vanderbilt (23-6, 12-3 Southeastern Conference) held on for I
a 64-60 win over UF (20-10, 9-6 SEC) in the O'Connell Center
on Tuesday night.
The final play was designed for junior forward Chandler
Parsons to drive and create a shot, and after being double-
teamed he kicked it out to a wide-open Boynton, who was just
2 of 15 from the field on the night after hitting 6 of 9 attempts
from three-point range Saturday at Georgia.
"I skipped it to KB, and he got a great look," said Parsons,
who followed up his 29-point performance against the Bull-
dogs with just three points. "Those shots have been going
down for him lately, so I can't even really complain about the
look we got."
The Gators viewed their rematch with the Commodores
as a must-win, and the loss puts far more pressure on them
to win at Kentucky on Sunday and make a deep SEC Tourna-
ment run if they want to avoid a third-straight National Invi-
tation Tournament appearance.
"This one was huge," Parsons said. "You win this one,
you're in the (NCAA) Tournament. So it definitely hurts to
fall short, especially on Senior Night for Dan (Werner) and
with everything on the line."
UF led by five with 9:22 to go but couldn't get anything go-
ing offensively, as it went the last 9:53 without a field goal.
The Gators shot just 26.7 percent from the field and missed
all seven of their attempted three-pointers in the second half.
The Commodores, meanwhile, went 42.9 percent from the
field and hit 10 of 20 shots from beyond the arc for the game. Steven H. Keys/ Alligator Staff
Six of those came from guard John Jenkins, who finished UF center Vernon Macklin goes for a layup in the Gators' 64-

UF could see familiar end with NIT appearance
ou know this feeling, but thatdoesn't make it any easier to
swallow.
The familiar NIT is knocking -pret-
ty much banging down the door actu-
ally -after UF could not score down
the stretch once again in a 64-60 loss to
Vanderbilt.
Tuesday showed why the Georgia
game Saturday was so important. It
showed why the loss at South Carolina is
reason for concern. It showed how past
indiscretions -you know, like a home
loss to South Alabama -can come back
to haunt you in March.
Each of those losses is excusable by it-
self. Compounding those errors shrinks
the margin for error.
Florida all but clinched a three-gamePhil Kegler

the regular season,
putting even more
pressure on UF in
the Southeastern
Conference Tour-
nament.
I see a more
troubling pattern
developing: strug-
gling to score down the stretch.
The Gators went without a field goal
for the final 9:53 Tuesday. UF didn't
have a point in the final 1:39 against
Georgia. Florida finished the Auburn
game with no field goals in the last 8:24.
South Carolina held UF to one field goal
in six minutes late in the game. Missis-
sippi State cut a 12-point deficit with2:38 left to four in the final 30 seconds.
Florida scored five points in the final
5:14 against Kentucky.
The remarkable thing is the ability
of Florida's defense to keep the team
in games. The Gators shot 27 percent in
the second half -and had a wide-open
three-pointer to win the game.
"I thought we got phenomenal
shots," Donovan said. "We executed
our offense very, very well. The result
of the ball going in the basket was not
great."
The problem is the poor shooting
continues to be a trend. Kenny Boynton
and Erving Walker made a combined 3
of 24 shots. That's what happens when a
lack of depth forces those two to play 33

TAMPA -After pitching a shutout
in his first start, Anthony DeSclafani
could not record an out in his second
appearance this season.
The sophomore faced only five bat-
ters before leaving the mound.
No. 6 FSU (7-0) exploded for seven
runs in the opening inning on its way
to a 10-5 victory over No. 5 Florida (5-1)
on Tuesday as part of the "Florida Four"
Tournament in Tampa.
"I thought we were going to get a
good start out of Anthony tonight -I
really did," UF coach Kevin O'Sullivan
said. "For whatever reason he wasn't
sharp and we got off on
1 h the wrong foot. There's
really no way to explain
it. It's just disappoint-
Baseball ing. "
DeSclafani could not
find his command and
even hit FSU left fielder Mike McGee
with a pitch with the bases loaded to
bring in to bring in Tyler Holt for the
first run of the game.
"1 think it was just a lack of execution
on pitches," catcher Mike Zunino said.
"We can't afford those hit by pitches be-
cause that's just something the defense
can't defend."
FSU's fifth hitter, Stuart Tapley,
singled up the middle to knock in two
more runs, marking the end of DeScla-
fani's short appearance.
He left the game after allowing all
five batters he faced to reach base and
eventually score.
Ten hitters came to the plate for the
Seminoles in the first, and first baseman
Jayce Boyd capped off the inning with
a two-run homer over the left-field wall
off of freshman Hudson Randall, who
came in to relieve DeSclafani after he

had plenty of open looks caused
by loose-ball situations that Van-
derbilt came away with.
"He's a terrific shooter. You've
got to pickyour poison," UF coach
Billy Donovan said. "Was he
wide-open on some crazy plays?
Yes. But I thought our guys were
focused on trying to stop him."
Parsons, Boynton and sopho-
more point guard Erving Walker
combined to shoot just 4 of 28 on
the night, and UF was forced to
rely on Vernon Macklin.
The junior center had 21 points
and nine rebounds, but Macklin
was the only Gator to score more
than nine points -just the sec-
ond time this season Florida has
had just one player in double fig-
ures.
"Vernon really stepped up,"
Parsons said. "They pretty much
took me out of the game offen-
sively."
Werner, the team's lone se-
nior, was honored before the last
regular-season home game of
his four-year career. His father,
mother, brother and sister joined
him at center court, where Dono-
van gave Werner a framed No. 21
jersey.
He finished with eight points,
five rebounds, two steals, an assist
and a block -one of his better
games on the year -but couldn't
get a win in his final regular-sea-
son game in the O'Connell Cen-
ter.

game and you don't fight. We
fought," Werner said. "We were

Junior pitcher Geoff Parker
never allowed the Gators back
into the game.
He came into Tuesday's
matchup with an 11.25 ERA,
but that number fell as he
pitched 5.1 innings and gave
up only one run.
"I just think that's (fail-
ing to hit with runners in

ning of the year stuff.
I think that's going to
be taken care of as the
season goes along. It's
something that's going to

UF freshman catcher
The Gators could not find
their rhythm against the right-
hander.
After playing five games
in seven days to start the sea-
son, Florida was forced to sit
around for four-consecutive
days because their weekend
series against La Salle was
called off due to snow in the
Northeast.

big lead.
Jonathan Pigott led off the
third inning with a single, but
he was caught napping on first
base after taking too big of a
lead.
In the same frame, Zunino
hit a solo home run that would
have brought in two runs if
Pigott could have avoided the
pickoff.
Donovan complimented Boynton and
Walker on Tuesday for their ability to be
resilient and overcome poor offensive
nights.
That is a great characteristic for a bas-
ketball player to have, but at some point'
you have to stop being a liability on the of-
fensive side.
Take away the Georgia game and Boyn-The Gators also had runners
on second and third with one
out in the fifth and sixth in-
nings, but failed to bring in a
run both times.
"I just think that's (failing

behind the three-point line.
It's not a slump when you're 30 games
into the season. It's just a terrible year.
The thing that had been most impres-
sive about Florida -its ability to win a lot
of different ways -also means the team
doesn't have one go-to guy. The Gators
can't handle too many key parts having a
bad game.
"Good teams really, really make win-
ning plays," Donovan said. "When I'm say-around."
The lone bright spot for
Florida was the ninth inning.
It scored four in the frame,
and center fielder Matt den
Dekker extended his hitting
streak to 15 games, dating back
to last season, with a RBI single
the in inning. But Daniel Pigott
fouled out to first base with the
bases loaded to end the game
and UF's comeback attempt.
ing winning plays, it's like the plays where
it's just reaction plays -where the ball
goes up and they just react with it.
"They find a way to come up with the
loose basketball and throw it out to the
three-point line. Our guys, especially our
front court guys, have to react a little bit
better to that. That is probably a great chal-
lenge."
It's also the difference between rejoining
an old friend at the dance and being stuck
looking in from the window.

Men, women finish seventh
STAFF REPORT
The Florida women's golf team tied for sev-
enth place with Ole Miss at the Kinderlou For-
est Challenge in Valdosta, Ga.
The Gators finished with a three-round total
of 913 (295-309-309, +37).
"Because we were in a shotgun this week -
we played all three rounds starting on the same
hole -we actually finished on the same three
holes which happened to be a pretty tough
stretch of golf," UF coach Jan Dowling said.
"We didn't play them as well as we would have
liked to, and it kind of killed our momentum
going into the second and third rounds. But we
have got to take the positives from this week
and learn from it."
The squad started off strong through the first
round-and-a-half, but after the second round
was rescheduled for Tuesday morning due to
darkness, Florida lost its momentum.
Freshman Isabelle Lendl led the Gators in
the third round, carding a one-over 74. She fin-
ished the tournament in a tie for 20th with a
54-hole score of 227 (73-80-74, +8).
Fellow freshman Mia Piccio joined Lendl in
20th with the same score (73-77-77).
Sophomore Marika Lendl trailed the fresh-
men by one stroke, but that meant six spots on
the leaderboard. She finished in a tie for 26th,
carding a 228 (74-76-78, +9).
Sophomore Evan Jensen (75-79-80, +15) and
junior Jessica Yadloczky (76-77-83, +17), round-
ed out the Gators' lineup, finishing 49th and
55th, respectively.
The UF men's golf team completed the JohnHayt Invitational in Ponte Vedra Beach with a
seventh-place finish, jumping four spots on the
leaderboard. The Gators finished with a total
score of 899 (310-293-296, +35).
Senior Tim McKenney led the way by finish-
ing in a tie for fifth. He carded a tournament
total of 217 (78-70-69, +1), improving his score
each round.
Next in line for Florida, senior Tyson Alex-
ander finished in a tie for 21st, shooting 225 (80-
72-73, +9).
"We didn't play them as well as we
would have liked to, and it kind of
killed our momentum going into the
