UF has begun to create a dedicated 
bias response team following the re-
cent Alpha Tau Omega incident that caused UF President Bernie Machen to send a letter condemning the actions of a brother.
The university will create a commit-
tee of various department heads and involved students that will deal with bias incidents that occur within the campus community.
Mary Kay Carodine, assistant vice 
president for student affairs and one of the heads of the future committee, said the mission of the team is to en-courage “awareness, education and re-sponse” in the community about bias incidents.
Bias incidents differ from hate 
crimes in that during a bias incident, no crime is committed, Carodine said.
Once “a few more parts are in 
place,” the committee will open up to student involvement. Carodine said she expects a website to debut at the end of this semester or the beginning of next semester.
“There already is a response that 
happens to bias incidents,” she said. “What we really want to do is make the protocol cleaner and pull people in.”Response

Gainesville Police identified a suspect Wednesday in a re-
cent robbery and are still looking for a man involved in a local 
burglary last week.
Investigators issued a warrant Wednesday for Gainesville resident John Gabe Gaddy III, 23, after police reported he robbed the Eastside location of Sweet Dreams Homemade Ice Cream of Gainesville, 1040 E. University Ave., according to Gainesville Police.
Officers reported Oct. 27 that Gaddy walked into the shop 
and forced the female clerk into the bathroom at gunpoint. He then took money from the register and ran from the store.
He’s wanted on charges of armed robbery, kidnapping and 
possession of a firearm by a convicted felon with a bond of $800,000, police said.
Gaddy’s last known address is 1101 SE 15th St., Apt. 76, and he drives a 1998 tan Buick LeSabre, police said. He should be considered armed and dangerous.
Anyone with information to help locate Gaddy is encour-
aged to contact GPD detectives at 352-393-7670 or text the key-word “GPDFL” plus the tip to 274637.
Investigators are still looking for a man whom police report-
ed broke into Gator Tales Sports Bar, 5112 NW 34th St., while the bar was closed on Oct. 30. A surveillance video shows the man walking into a back room and taking boxes of liquor.
Those with information on the burglary should contact in-
vestigator Steve Jones or text their tip plus GPDFL to 274637.Gainesville Police identify robbery suspect, search for bar thiefLOCAL

Royal Opera House
Step inside the famed Royal Opera House and experience the world’s finest opera at the Hippodrome State Theatre. The Royal Opera House Cinema Season 2013/14 kicks off this month with Puccini’s “Tosca.” Among the star singers in this revival are Angela Gheorghiu, Jonas Kaufmann and Bryn Terfel. Jonathan Kent’s de-tailed production draws on the historical backdrop of Rome in 1800, a political world of con-trol and suspicion, beautifully evoked in Paul Brown’s lav-ish designs. The pageantry of church ritual, the darkness of a brooding study with its hid-den torture chamber and the false optimism of the light of a Roman dawn all throw into relief the love of the beauti-ful diva Tosca, the idealism of her lover Cavaradossi and the deadly, destructive obses-sion of the malevolent chief of police, Scarpia. Admission is $20 and includes a compli-mentary glass of wine. The opera showings will be at 7:30 p.m. and Sunday at 2:30 p.m. To purchase tickets, contact the box office at 352-375-4477.

Jen Day Shaw, associate vice president and 
dean of students, said the goal of this commit-
tee is to respond to the victim of the incident, as well as the community at large.
So far, UF has asked Gainesville Police to 
add hate crimes and bias incidents to their anonymous report system, but currently these incidents are handled by the U Matter, We Care campaign.
“We have the structure already in place, 
so really it’s more pulling stuff together and formalizing it and ﬁ  guring out what training people will need,” she said.
LB Hannahs, director of LGBT Affairs and 
assistant director of Multicultural and Diversi-ty Affairs at UF, said this team will be “ﬁ  lling in the gaps” University Police, housing and stu-dent affairs have left in their response to bias incidents.
“We’re in the beginning stages of research-
ing what other schools do, researching models that will ﬁ  t our campus culture and examining the resources and response protocols that we already have in place and seeing what works best for UF,” Hannahs said.
Hannahs said the hope is the information 
the team is gathering will give the department a fuller picture of what students are experienc-ing and where they are experiencing it.
“The response team isn’t about hunting 
down every single person and punishing them,” Hannahs said. “It’s about educating people how to advocate for themselves and educating people who perform bias incidents and how we can help them do better in not con-tributing to a negative atmosphere.” REGINA SIN

Good news for students planning to travel 
home for the long weekend: Gas prices statewide 
have reached an all-time low for the year so far.
According to AAA’s Daily Fuel Gauge Report, 
one gallon of regular gas is going for about $3.35 in Gainesville.
One month ago, prices were about a dime 
higher with regular gas selling for $3.43. A year ago, a gallon of regular was $3.54, according to the report.
Local prices are slightly above the national av-
erage for unleaded gasoline as well as the aver-age price in Florida, both $3.23, according to the report.
The drop could be attributed to an increase 
of oil supplies, pushing both gas and oil prices lower, according to a AAA fuel price brief.
A barrel of oil was traded below $95 for the 
ﬁ  rst time since June because of inﬂ  ation. U.S. stockpiles also increased the nation’s fuel sup-plies by 4 million barrels, according to the AAA fuel price brief.
Dianne McDonald, AAA manager, said the 
low gas prices are beneﬁ  cial to students and lo-cals for the upcoming breaks.
This will give locals who may not have been 
able to afford the higher gas prices earlier in the year a chance to travel during Thanksgiv-ing Break, she said. Lower prices are expected to continue for the rest of the month.
Teresa Zamor, a 20-year-old UF health science 
junior, said she looks for the lowest gas prices to ﬁ  ll up her tank for the long trips home.
“Even though some of the gas stations differ 
in prices within a couple of cents, those cents become dollars, and it will eventually add up,” Zamor said. “I hope they continue to stay low until I can visit home.”4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 2013

To further the university’s environmental-
ly friendly efforts, UF is working to establish a 
student bike-sharing program.
UF offers departmental bike-sharing, but 
it is only available to faculty and employees. Student Government is researching effective programs that can be for students on campus, said Andrew Giacini, SG’s chief of staff.
“The program is still in the backstage of 
planning but could be something we see in a few years,” said the 20-year-old UF economics junior.
An SG poll asked students if a bike-sharing 
program was something they wanted, and many responded with a yes, Giacini said.
“My personal goal is to have the program 
implemented in about three years,” he said.
The departmental program started in 2011 
and has 50 bikes for all the departments on campus, said Stephanie Sims, implementation coordinator for UF’s Ofﬁ  ce of Sustainability. The bikes are refurbished from abandoned property on campus, she said.Other schools with bike-sharing programs 
have been evaluated in order to see if the pro-grams could ﬁ  t the needs of a large campus with so many students, Giacini said.
“Having the option to rent out a bike would 
be very convenient, and plus, I would get my workout in for the day,” said Abby Yull, a 20-year-old UF political science junior.
SG wants the program to be accessible to 
students in all departments, Giacini said.
“There are differences between classroom 
buildings, gym on campus, living areas and major departments like Shands that we want to cover,” Giacini said.
Once the student bike-sharing is in place, 
long-term checkouts could allow students to rent out a bike for a semester and not have to worry about checking it back in anytime soon, Sims said.Bike-sharing program could let UF students rent wheels

The aftermath of Fest in-
cludes fan souvenirs of left-
behind trash. For some ven-ues, the cleanup is relatively easy, given the number of people who migrate to the four-day festival. But part of the responsibility also falls on the city.
Shauna Dixon, owner of 
Durty Nelly’s Irish Pub, said Fest cleanup is like “regular cleaning times 30.” But the process is pretty standard, she said, and her staff took care of all the cleaning at her venue.
Dixon, who said the bar has 
hosted Fest bands every year, said this year was no cleaner than usual, but the music fans tried to show as much respect for the venue as possible.
“They’re very mannerly 
— the punk culture — very respectful of the premises,” she said.
Steve Joplin, the city’s solid 
waste manager, said much of the Fest cleanup falls to the city.“Unfortunately, the city 
ends up cleaning whatev-er mess is made,” he said. “We’ve had some years where downtown is a terrible mess, but the information from my staff was that [Fest 12] wasn’t as bad as previous years.”
Joplin said because Fest 
is such a big event, he has to schedule employees to work Friday through Sunday even though that falls outside nor-mal hours.
“When we have to schedule 
staff to come in,” he said, “it’s not a very ideal situation.”
Fest organizer Tony Wein-
bender said all Fest volun-teers stay an extra hour after each show to help the venues clean up. Compared to other Gainesville events, he said the cleanup isn’t a big deal.
“I think we are … less of a 
cleanup process than a Gator game or the Homecoming Pa-rade,” he said.

� A PORTION OF THE PROFITS

Gator Innovators swarmed the 
Plaza of the Americas during the 
Entrepreneurs Raid the Plaza event held Wednesday.
Sean Treiser, a 19-year-old UF 
economics sophomore, said the event was sponsored by the Center for Entrepreneurship and Innova-tion. The event gave student busi-ness owners the chance to sell their goods — provided that a portion of the proﬁ  ts went to charity.
“People don’t have the oppor-
tunity to appreciate the really cool things that students are doing them-selves in terms of startups,” he said.
One such startup, as well as event 
partner, was Trendy Tyme, which sells fashion watches. Monica Desai, the 22-year-old founder, is seeking her masters in business management at UF. She said she is proud of the strong tradition of Gator innovation, and one day, she hopes to extend the event to a weekly happening, similar to the University of Central Florida’s weekly market day.
“I just wanted it so that other en-
trepreneurs can come out here, get to know each other, help each other out and promote their businesses,” she said.

We don’t need to look further than the pages of 
this newspaper to see how racism still plagues this entire country. But we can.
In case you missed it in the Halloween issue of the Alli-
gator, there was a front-page story discouraging students from wearing culturally insensitive costumes.
Although this seems unnecessary in what is supposed 
to be a post-racial society — we elected President Barack Obama, didn’t we? — it is necessary after last year’s black-face incident and that recent case of racist and sexist cat-calling.
Those are just two examples of not-so-isolated racist 
episodes happening on our campus.
Something has to be done. We can talk about it for 
starters. That’s always good. Even that doesn’t happen enough.
The real problem with racism, though, is that it’s in-
grained everywhere, from TV shows with predominantly white casts to Congress. But those aren’t the only institu-tions infected by racism.
In New York City, home of the stop and frisk, a judge 
was kicked off a case regarding the issue by failing to up-hold the “appearance of impartiality surrounding this liti-gation,” according to the New York Times.
Apparently, Judge Shira Scheindlin was removed 
from the case because she exercised her First Amendment right to talk about the trial — and only to defend herself from accusations from being impartial. Not only was she removed, but her decision to reform stop and frisk has been temporarily held as well. So there goes the First and Fourth Amendments in one fell swoop.
I know what it’s like to have privilege. I am a white 
male, and I won’t even pretend to truly understand the oppression people of color face.
But I do know that in 2012, more than 284,000 black 
people were stopped by police ofﬁ  cers without probable cause and searched, a violation of their constitutional rights. That’s ﬁ  ve and a half times the number of white people stopped in a similar manner, according to data from the New York Civil Liber-ties Union.
But here’s the worst part: 
There’s no proof stop and frisk reduces crime at all, and even though crime has fallen in New York City since its implementa-tion, other cities like Los Angeles and New Orleans had greater re-duction in crime without relying 
on the policy.
We don’t live in a post-racial society. Many claim we 
do, often citing Obama’s presidency as proof. It is fantastic that we elected a black man as our commander in chief. It is an important step. Don’t forget that after he took of-ﬁ  ce, multiple high-proﬁ  le white people — not to mention ordinary citizens — were quick to demand Obama’s birth certiﬁ  cate, not believing he was American because of his race.
Institutional racism on this scale affects every aspect of 
people’s lives.
An American Economic Review study found that job 
applicants with black-sounding names received 50 per-cent fewer callbacks than applicants with white-sounding names. Since 1954, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics began consistently keeping unemployment data by race, the unemployment rate for black people has averaged 2.2 times that of white people.
My goal here is not to demonize white people or start 
some kind white-guilt conquest. It’s just that we, as a coun-try, don’t talk about this. Conversations start change.
These numbers are appalling. Many people can’t fath-
om discrimination on this level, but it is the reality of our society.  And there’s strength in numbers. The more equal everyone is, the greater our achievements as a country will be. It’s time to shed the false consciousness and realize we really are one nation, indivisible, united for justice for all.

Christie’s win and 
what it means for ’16
There was no question of whether Chris Christie would 
win New Jersey’s gubernatorial elections.
Sure enough, on Tuesday, he was re-elected with more 
than 60 percent of the vote and a signiﬁ  cant win among women voters.
According to The New Yorker, “The New Jersey guberna-
torial race is not just another lopsided off-year contest; Chris-tie made it clear that he is thinking about the 2016 Presidential race, and that he thought this victory helped. His speech was full of political double entendres. ‘I did not seek a second term to do small things,’ he said.
“Not to say that New Jersey is small, but just how big is he 
thinking? ‘Maybe people in Washington should turn on their TVs now and see how it’s done,’ he said at another point, pre-senting Jersey as a magical land where things like partisanship and race could be put aside.”
He’s an effective yet controversial politician. For all his work 
with Hurricane Sandy relief efforts, he’s no magnanimous hero. He made headlines this week when a photo surfaced of him screaming and shaking his ﬁ  nger at a teacher who asked him why he continued to spread myths that teachers in New Jersey are failing.
It’s a fair question: New Jersey public schools are doing 
extremely well despite Christie’s claims that they are “failure factories.” Christie is on a mission to implement a corporate-inﬂ  uenced school reform agenda — but that’s an editorial for another day.
Christie, however, is poised to stake a claim in the Repub-
lican presidential candidacy for 2016. And Democrats should worry.
According to The Atlantic, “With a reelected Christie poised 
to become a major national ﬁ  gure, Tuesday’s result may be a warning as much to Democrats as it is to the GOP. Republicans will have a hard time succeeding if they follow Cuccinelli, Cruz, and the far-right fringe.
“But the toxicity of the Republican brand proved no obstacle 
at all to a candidate savvy enough to stake out a forceful and distinct persona and convince voters he can hurdle partisanship to get things done. Any Democrats who previously thought de-mographics, tactical superiority, and Republican disarray made their party a lock in 2016 ought to look at Chris Christie and think again.”
Voters have seen campaign failings from both parties in the 
past. Bush was re-elected in 2004 thanks to some Democratic missteps and a little campaign “strategery.” Obama was re-elected in 2012 thanks to some Republican missteps and cam-paign wizardry.
But 2016 could go either way. Remember how Christie’s 
endorsement of Obama (in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy) killed him in the polls and cost him the governorship?
Oh, wait.If nothing else, this should at least be a call to the Democratic 
Party to rev up those campaign engines. Both sides will need all the horsepower they can get.THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 2013

All pumpkin everything.
A barbecue restaurant like 4 Riv-
ers Smokehouse might not be the first place that comes to mind for some overwhelmingly comforting desserts — especially pumpkin-fla-vored, why-isn’t-it-Thanksgiving-yet whoopie pies and cupcakes, to name a couple — but it clearly is.
The restaurant’s Sweet Shop in-
vited the Avenue to sample some of its fall-themed sweets.
“We’ve always had desserts,” said 
catering coordinator Claire Dixon. “But we wanted to do it in store.”
Here are some of the highlights 
from the mouthwatering adventure:
Pumpkin harvest stack: pumpkin 
chiffon cake filled with a whipped mascarpone filling and topped with fresh whipped cream, pecans and caramel drizzle. Do not attempt this one on your own. Bring friends.
Pumpkin whoopie pie: pumpkin 
spice cake filled with toasted pecan cream-cheese filling and topped with a white chocolate drizzle and pecans. The cakes holding the whoopie pie together were sturdy enough to hold the pecan cream cheese filling but were moist and soft. Because who wants a dry whoopie pie?
Pumpkin creme bombe: vanilla 
bean mousse, spice frosting and the ever-present caramel drizzle.
Pumpkin bayou bar: pecan short-
bread crust, pumpkin and cream cheese filling. The bayou wasn’t the most photogenic or the best dessert there, but it embodied Thanksgiv-ing. Maybe it was the consistency of the pumpkin, or maybe it was the shortbread crust.
Pumpkin cupcake: I described it 
as “pumpkin pie, but 100 times bet-ter,” while my friend and photogra-pher said it was “a better way to eat pumpkin pie.” Basically, if you don’t like pumpkin pie, you will like this. The pumpkin flavor is subtle and the cupcake not too sweet.
John Rivers, the restaurant group’s 
chef and owner, is also responsible for the Sweet Shop’s take on the cro-nut, according to an email.
This soft, crunchy and warm 
pumpkin spice “do’ssant,” as Dixon 
called it, was the last dessert to come out. The part croissant, part donut was (obviously) made of fried cin-namon spice croissant dough cov-ered in brown sugar, pumpkin spice clove and a caramel drizzle.
After so much sugar, mousse 
and obvious pumpkin flavor, it was almost a relief to have this crunchy “do’ssant” in front of us.
If these sweets are any indication, 
the desserts section of John River’s first cookbook, “The Southern Cow-boy,” is sure to have something to satisfy any sweet tooth. The book hit shelves last weekend, and there will be a signing Friday from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. at the restaurant’s Gainesville location, 3262 SW 35th Blvd.
The restaurant’s mail-order 
smoked turkey will be available to taste at the signing. The turkey is fea-tured in the cookbook, which costs $28.99 plus tax and is also available as an e-book.
I don’t think I could eat like this 
more than once, but that’s what the holidays are about, right?

You never notice the way the crowd syn-
chronizes at a concert when you’re in it: the 
flux and flow of the bodies like blood to the pulse of the music, the crowd surfers skim-ming over the mass.
At Fest, you’re a critical part of the move-
ments. As a volunteer, I watched it all unfold.
To some people, the best part about volun-
teering at Fest is the free, all-access wristband that is usually $100. I disagree.
The best thing about volunteering at Fest is 
the people you meet, whether you are helping the bands set up, letting people into venues or just talking to other volunteers. 
Volunteering is a hugely important slice of 
the crazy Fest pie because it completes the en-tire experience. 
You spend a couple of days seeing your fa-
vorite bands and discovering new ones, then you spend one shift meeting bands, helping the shows run smoothly and watching the crowd go crazy as your hard work pays off.
This was my second year volunteering, and 
both years, I checked wristbands at the door. 
It sounds monotonous, but when a 6-foot-
5-inch bearded man enters a venue in the mid-dle of intricately air drumming along to a live band, and he stops mid-beat to show you his wristband and flash a thumbs-up, your night is far from dull.  
Last year, I met one of 
my favorite bands, Make Do and Mend, standing in front of where I was volun-teering at :08. 
Then, as I volunteered, 
I got to meet bands like Le-
muria and Iron Chic while I helped them be-fore their sets. The thing about volunteering is that everyone is genuine. 
The bands and the fans both share the same 
explosive passion for music, and these are people who are unapologetically themselves.  
The way it feels to be a 19-year-old student 
with no tattoos screaming along to “World’s on Heroin” with a big, bearded dude in black on one side and a petite, purple-haired girl with octopus tentacles tattooed up her leg on my other side is euphoric.
We all look different, but we all feel the 
same about our music.
There’s more than just sharing music with 
new friends at Fest. I learned about gender identity and societal implications of being cisgendered in the crowd of Spoonboy at the Civic Media Center.
Volunteering at Fest is work, but the expe-
rience pays in ways that surmount money.
If you come into the weekend not knowing 
anyone, you will leave with some new best friends.

This fall season, McDonald’s debuted its McCafé 
pumpkin spice latte, but some UF students do not ap-
pear to be “lovin’ it.”
Zach Feldman, a 19-year-old UF 
economics sophomore, was skepti-cal of the drink.
“I don’t trust it as much,” he 
said.
The new McDonald’s drink ri-
vals Starbucks’ pumpkin spice latte, one of the cafe’s best-sellers. Last year, the drink was so popular that Starbucks ran out of the concoction in some stores, according to Time magazine.
The Starbucks beverage ranges from about $4 to 
$5 a cup, while the McDonald’s cup ranges $2 to $3, depending on size.
John Lollo, a 19-year-old UF business administra-
tion sophomore, said he did not think the price gap would make a difference.
“People that are traditionally set in Starbucks 
ways are going to buy Starbucks,” Lollo said.
The traditional drink, however, has some students 
worried about the sugar intake.
“The Starbucks ones are really good, but they’re so 
sugary I never get them,” said Danie Solis, a 20-year-old UF applied physiology and kinesiology junior.
The McDonald’s 16-ounce latte has about 270 cal-
ories, while the Starbucks version has 380 calories.McDonald’s joins

The first time the Grooming Standard participated in 
Movember, 447,808 Mo Bros and Mo Sistas were regis-
tered to grow mustaches and support mustache growth.
This year is Movember’s 10-year anniversary.About 800,000 people have registered to participate in 
the global movement that encourages men to grow mus-taches to raise funds and awareness for prostate cancer, testicular cancer and mental health.
The Grooming Standard is participating for its fourth 
year in a row.
Oded Eshel, a 29-year-old clinical consultant at Exact-
ech Gainesville, and Mike Cushing, a 27-year-old mar-keting strategist at local digital agency 352, started the Movember team in 2010 when a mutual friend, who was about 25 at the time, was diagnosed with testicular can-cer.
Their friend survived and is now the group’s mascot, 
Esthel said.
Just one week into the month, the Grooming Standard 
has raised a bit more than $5,000 toward its $30,000 goal for the 30-day global fundraiser. 
Eshel, the team captain, said he has no doubt the team 
will surpass its goal.
The group markets its cause using humor and You-
Tube videos that they send to friends and family who support their cause. 
The first YouTube video they made for Movember 
2013 features booty shaking to the song “Good Vibra-tions” by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch and a set of signs that read “Welcome to Movember” and “F**k you cancer.”
The object of the fundraiser is to start a conversation 
about health from the male perspective, Eshel said.
“I think that the awareness happens organically as 
a result of that,” he said. “The big thing with fundrais-ers is no one really donates to a cause. They donate to people.”
Howard Rofenblatt, a 66-year-old testicular cancer 
survivor, said raising awareness is the best way to catch cancer early because people who are taught to do self-examinations can know when something is wrong.
“Early detection results in increased life expectancy,” 
he said.
Cushing, whose father was diag-
nosed with prostate cancer earlier this year, said he has always been passionate about his involvement.
 But his father’s diagnosis just shows 
cancer can strike at any time.
B.J. Webster, a barber and owner of  
the Downtown Barbershop, said Mo-
vember is gaining momentum.
In November, a lot of customers say they’re partici-
pating.
“Slowly but surely, for one month of the year, the 
mustache is becoming the look of prostate and testicular cancer,” Cushing said.
Although the Downtown Barber Shop doesn’t do any-
thing special to promote the movement, it offers a free beard trim to men who come in for haircuts, Webster said.
Keeping beards short and rocking just a mustache is the 
most challenging part of Movember for Cushing and Eshel, 
who are both fans of year-round facial hair.
Cushing’s ‘stache is a handlebar right now.
“I want to look slightly ridiculous, so people ask me 
about my mustache,” he said. “For most people, I think the mustache is not a common look.”
Eshel said his mustache doppelganger is the Killers’ 
lead singer Brandon Flowers. He said he’s “like 12 hairs shy of going full handlebar.”
“Full up top. Soul patch on the bottom,” Eshel said. 
“Like a classy pirate.”

tip of the weekSmall Goals Yield Big Gains
“When you set and accomplish small, tangible changes, you get an 
immediate sense of gratiﬁ  cation, and that is self-motivating.”
— Ellie Krieger, registered dietitian and author of “Small Changes,
Big Results: A 12-Week Action Plan to a Better Life”Liv Langdon is a 23-year-old senior 
majoring in journalism. 
You can follow @LivLangdon on 
Instagram and read her blog at 
LivLangandProsper.wordpress.com
The Challenge: 
Set a distinct monthlong goal. It doesn’t have to be a new year 
to shape a new you. The goal can be anything from finishing that 
one book to exercising one hour a day to getting up earlier to start 
the day. But the rule is you must stick to it for at least four weeks. 
Why? According to the Colipera website, it takes about 20 to 30 
days to make habit change a behavior. Put forth your full energy, 
commitment and productivity to achieving this personal goal, and 
you may actually find your true passion.S.M.A.R.T. goals: 
Speciﬁ  c — Don’t use words like “more” or “less” in your goal. Use hard numbers.
Measurable — By when? How much time? How many pounds? How many words?
Actionable — “Be healthier” does not work. Make the goal something you have to do.
Relative — Make sure the goal is in line with your motivations right now.
Timely — Don’t make the goal 10 years in the future. Short-term stuff is best.

Ariel BarnesDear Mediocre Advice,
Do girls poop?
Dear Mediocre Advice,
What’s the deal with Movember?Dear Friend,
Yes. Sometimes we poop, and sometimes we take such massive dumps that it’s a 
surprise we don’t lift off like a rocket ship right from the toilet. Guess what? Girls fart, 
too. Some are capable of smelling worse than a dumpster of dead bodies and rotten eggs — a smell that can only be described as pure sin. There are scary things in a woman’s world that you wouldn’t see in your worst nightmares. We can harvest para-sites in our stomachs for nine months. Your mother could drown you in the amount of blood that’s been spilled from her uterus in her lifetime. Sometimes, depending on our ethnic background, we can grow fuller peach fuzz mustaches than a 13-year-old boy. Even worse, every once in a while, some of us will find a really long single strand of hair growing from a random part of our neck. Last, but not least, some of us live for high-waisted shorts, and we’re not going to stop wearing them because guys don’t think they’re flattering. Poop is the least of your worries, friend. We are monsters.Dear Friend,
Sweet baby Jesus, it’s the most wonderful time of the year. 
Every man grows out a full and beautiful mustache to raise awareness about prostate, testicular and other male cancers. This is also the time of year that I am constantly tripping over myself and drooling because of all the glorious mustaches and beards to ogle at. If you hear a catcall such as, “Aye baby, let me ride that ‘stache!” then I’m definitely in the area. Gentle-men, please indulge me, and grow out the greatest mustache 
you can. It’s for a good cause.BUY IT. SELL IT. FIND IT. 373-FIND

Add Tyler Moore to an injury list that 
keeps growing each week.
The starting offensive tackle suffered a 
compound fracture of his elbow during a 
scooter crash Tuesday night, becoming the ninth Gator to suffer a season-ending in-jury in 2013.
Moore underwent surgery on his elbow 
Wednesday morning.
“I hurt for Tyler,” coach Will Muschamp 
said. “He’s a good young man and really does everything we ask on and off the field. He’s an outstanding member of our foot-ball team, and it’s just very unfortunate.”
Moore switched from right tackle to 
left tackle prior to Florida’s 23-20 loss to Georgia in Jacksonville to fill in for D.J. Humphries, who is currently sidelined with a sprained left MCL. Now, the Gators’ offensive line will see an even more jarring shift.
Left guard Max Garcia will switch to left 
tackle to replace Moore. Backup linemen Kyle Koehne and Ian Silberman will share time filling in for Garcia at left guard.
 Trip Thurman will serve as the backup 
for both tackle spots, and Muschamp men-tioned that Octavius Jackson could even earn some playing time on the line.
“Somebody else needs to step up and 
play productive football,” Muschamp said.
Moore joins Chaz Green as starting of-
fensive linemen lost for the season. Green suffered a torn labrum during training camp in August. The other seven Gators done for the season are Andre Debose (torn ACL), Jeff Driskel (fractured right fibula), Dominique Easley (torn ACL), Matt Jones (torn meniscus), Jeremi Powell (torn ACL), Matt Rolin (torn ACL) and Nick Washing-ton (shoulder).
“Surely no one wants to hear about 
those problems we have, or really cares about them much,” defensive coordinator D.J. Durkin said on Wednesday. “It’s part of the game. We’ve just got to move on and keep fighting through it.”
Easley signs with agent: Easley report-
edly withdrew from UF this week and has signed with agent Tom Santanello of Elevate Football in Boca Raton. Easley underwent surgery on Oct. 17 to repair a torn right ACL suffered during practice on Sept. 24.
According to Santanello, Dr. James An-
drews described Easley’s surgery as “100 percent successful.” Now, the defensive tackle’s focus shifts to reclaiming his status as projected first-round talent before his injury.
“He’s on track to be right there again,” 
Santanello said of Easley’s performance prior to the injury. “He’s not worried. He’s a very confident young man.”
Noisy neighbors: While Florida is fight-
ing for bowl eligibility at 4-4, Florida State is riding high.
The undefeated Seminoles entered this 
week ranked second in the BCS standings.
Win out and FSU will have a shot at 
winning its first national championship since 1999.
Even in Gainesville, the Gators know 
what’s going on in Tallahassee this year.
“It’s kind of hard not to,” defensive 
tackle Darious “Bear” Cummings said. “But then again, we’re at Florida, they’re at Florida State. We’ve got to focus on us.”
The Gators will shift their focus to the Seminoles ahead of the two teams’ meet-ing in The Swamp on Nov. 30. FSU hoped to play spoiler for UF’s national title hopes in last year’s game. The roles will likely be reversed this time around.“That’s Florida State, that’s a rivalry,” 
Cummings said. “It’s going to be a hype game regardless of what the records are.”

this report.

Savannah Jordan made a bold 
move against Arkansas’ goalkeeper 
Cameron Carter.
Junior midfielder Havana So-
laun shot a ball into the air, and as it was closing in on the box, Jordan saw Carter coming out of the goal to make a save.
Jordan followed the ball, leaped 
forward and headed it into the back of the net while colliding into Cart-er to give the Gators their only goal of the night.
The freshman forward was Florida’s deciding factor in a tough 1-0 victory against Arkansas in the second round of the Southeastern Conference Tournament at Orange Beach Sportsplex in Orange Beach, Ala., on Wednesday night.
“That’s a brave goal,” coach 
Becky Burleigh said. “But she’s been doing that all year. She dis-plays all her courage, knowing that she’s going to take a hit and scoring anyway. 
“That’s one of the things that 
makes her a great goal scorer.”
Despite Jordan’s relentlessness 
on Florida’s attack, the win did not come easy.The Gators 
struggled on the attack for the rest of the game, tak-ing 17 shots with Jordan’s 24th-minute attempt being the only one to find the back of the net.
The Razorbacks increased their 
pressure and changed up their for-mation in an attempt to muster up an offense, putting forward Jeriann Okoro on the high line with for-ward Ashleigh Ellenwood.
The change put pressure on Florida’s defense — Arkansas took nine shots during the game — but the lack of accuracy behind them saved Florida.
“They’re a pretty predictable 
team,” Burleigh said. “But just be-cause they’re predictable doesn’t make them easy to deal with. It’s physical. 
“It’s just putting a lot of bodies in 
front of the goal and just battling.” 
The Gators had to battle through 
a close call in the 89th minute when the Razorbacks earned a free kick from a Florida foul in the attacking third. Arkansas packed the box and sent a shot forward.Junior goalkeeper Taylor Burke 
made a difficult save at the far post, diving to the ground to keep the ball from finding the feet of any Ar-kansas players. The Gators pushed the ball back into Razorbacks terri-tory to run out the remainder of the clock.
After ending the game with a 
shutout, Florida will advance to the semifinals and play No. 4 Ole Miss on  Friday night.
“I’m really proud of us getting 
the shutout because [Arkansas is] hard to shut out,” Burleigh said. “We just have to get our bodies ready for Friday and recover.”
Freshman forward powers Gators to SEC Tournament victory“I hurt for Tyler. he’s a good 
young man and really does 
everything we ask on and off the 
field. He’s an outstanding member 
of our football team, and it’s just 
very unfortunate.”

Each week, two alligatorSports columnists 
will debate the biggest looming matchup in college football. Today, Adam Lichten-
stein and Adam Pincus preview No. 13 LSU’s road matchup against No. 1 Alabama in Tusca-loosa on Saturday at 8 p.m. on CBS. For simplic-ity, Adam Pincus will go as “Pincus.”
Adam: LSU-Alabama has been the 
pivotal college football game the last few 
years. It was so important in 2011 it had to be played twice to ﬁ  gure out the superior team.
It may not have that kind of hype this 
year — Auburn has an edge on LSU in the standings — but it’s still a battle of top-15 SEC teams, including No. 1 Alabama.
With that said, the Tigers don’t have a 
chance.
The Crimson Tide has been the top dog 
in the nation since it dismantled the Fight-ing Irish in the national title game last sea-son, and for good reason.
Pair a top-10 scoring offense with the 
No. 1 scoring defense (which gives up an absurdly low 9.8 points per game), and you have the far-and-away best team in the nation.
LSU is good, but it just can’t keep up 
with Alabama, especially not in front of 100,000 screaming Tide fans at Bryant-Denny Stadium — even if some leave early.
Pincus: I’m taking the Tigers  to cover 
in this one. Perhaps it’s still the “I’m from Louisiana” song by Louisiana Ca$h play-ing nonstop in my ears that’s clouding my judgement, but LSU will make this a game. 
If you don’t know which song I’m talk-ing about, you haven’t been to a game in Death Val-ley and your ears have thankfully been spared.
LSU has the tal-
ent and experience to stick with Ala-bama. 
Zach Mettenberger has started 22 ca-
reer games and has vastly improved in his second full season as starter. Couple him with Jeremy Hill running the football, and Alabama has some players to account for. LSU is too good to lose this game by two touchdowns.
Adam: I remember that song. I have 
spent nearly a month trying to get it out of my head. Thanks for ruining weeks of hard work, man.
On the other hand, Alabama is build-
ing its entire season toward a spot in its third straight BCS National Championship Game, and LSU is not going to get in its way.
Mettenberger has started 22 games? 
McCarron has 35. 
As the song goes, anything Mettenberg-
er can do, McCarron can do better. 
Mettenberger has some better numbers, 
but he also has receivers like Odell Beck-ham Jr. and Jarvis Landry. 
McCarron has talented wideouts to 
throw to as well, but no one who has put up the kind of numbers Beckham and Lan-dry have. 
Beckham averages a ridiculous 21 yards 
per catch!
But Beckham won’t be putting up those stats against the Tide. Alabama has the No. 9 pass defense in the nation. 
When Metten-
berger and LSU went up against Florida a month ago, the Gators limited him to his lowest output of 
the season. 
Although UF lost, Mettenberger threw 
for only 152 yards — 77 yards fewer than his second lowest total. Beckham had only two catches for 47 yards.
Alabama will at least match Florida, 
stumping Mettenberger and LSU.
Pincus: I do think Alabama pulls this 
game off, but the question is whether LSU covers. 
The last ﬁ  ve matchups have been decid-
ed by an average of eight points, with Ala-bama winning four of the last six. Exclud-ing the 21-0 embarrassment in the 2011 BCS National Championship, the biggest margin of victory was a 24-15 Alabama win in 2009. 
It’s not a stretch to say that this game 
will come down to the fourth quarter. Heck, I wouldn’t be surprised if LSU actu-ally pulled it off.
The Tigers are coming off of a bye week 
and are relatively healthy. 
Also, Alabama hasn’t looked like Ala-
bama this season. 
This may be an unfair knock, but when 
you’re going for your third straight na-tional title, expectations get higher and higher.
Also, I think it is time that we address the elephant in the room. 
Nick Saban has his biggest distraction 
this season in a year full of them — from former players allegedly receiving imper-missible beneﬁ  ts while at the school, to safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix taking a cash loan from an assistant coach. 
An email obtained by the Associated 
Press on Tuesday from Texas regent Tom Hicks said this: “Sexton [Jimmy Sexton, Saban’s agent] conﬁ  rmed that UT is the only job Nick would possibly consider leaving Alabama for, and that his success there created special pressure for him.”
That doesn’t sound like good news. Also, is it me or is the well-oiled ma-
chine that is Alabama looking a little ob-solete? 
Saban is the king of killing distractions, 
but this season has been chock-full of them. I’m thinking this may be one too many.
Adam: If anyone can keep a team fo-
cused, it’s Nick Saban. 
The former Tigers coach has a record of 
4-3 against LSU, but he will improve that on Saturday. And unlike 2011, there will be no rematch. 
With weapons like McCarron, T.J. Yel-
don and Amari Cooper, you can just crown Saban the king of the Bayou.
Pincus: That last line didn’t make any 
sense. The game is in Tuscaloosa. There’s nothing to do there besides drink whiskey and leave football games early. 
This won’t be your old-fashioned SEC 
barn-burner. These two offenses can put up some points. 
I say Alabama pulls it out in a 27-24 vic-
tory. Most importantly, the Tigers cover the spread. 
Can LSU cover a 13-point spread against Alabama?
