Activists callfor tolerance at local church
Thomas Plevik/ Alligator
Members of the Queer Activist Coalition and Stand-Up Florida stood outside the Dove World Outreach
Center on Northwest 37th Street Sunday to protest its anti-Islamic and anti-homosexual messages.0 ABOUT 40 PEOPLE
PROTESTED SUNDAY.
By CJ Pruner
Alligator Writer
They came through the morn-
ing, the smoke of their breaths
lingering in the winter chill.
Marching side by side, they made
their way down Northwest 37th
Street, hoisting a rainbow banner
for all to see.
Carrying signs calling for
tolerance and acceptance, they
halted in front of the Dove World
Outreach Center, a church known
for its controversial statements
regarding Islam.
Gainesville's Queer Activist
Coalition, Stand Up Florida and
several advocacy organizations
spoke out against the church's
stance against homosexuality
Sunday morning.
"They seem to think every-
thing is wrong except for what
they preach," said R. Zeke Fread,
the west central director of Stand
Up Florida, an activist group
dedicated to promoting gayrights. "We need to call them out.
That's why we're freezing our
butts off."
The group of about 40 stood
across from signs planted on
the church's property that read
"Homo leads to Hell," "Fort
Hood is only the beginning" and
"Obama's policies are of the dev-
il."
They waved banners, planted
rainbow flags next to the center
signs and altered the church's
signs to read "God loves youR
butT."
When Wayne Sapp, a pas-
tor with the center, came out to
record the protesters, he was
greeted with two questions.
"Sir, why do you hate us?" a few
of the protesters asked Sapp, who
stayed at a distance. "Doesn't
God love everyone?"
According to the Rev. Terry
Jones, the center's senior pastor,
the church's message isn't one of
hate but of compassion.
"We feel very sorry for these
people. You can't have love
without the truth," Jones said.
"Whether you are a homosexual

Pageant winners crowned
By ANDREA RUMBAUGH
Alligator Contributing Writer
After three hours of fashion, perfor-
mances and Twitter updates, Cecil Duffie
and Romilda Justilien were crowned Mr.
and Miss Black Student Union at the Reitz
Union Rion Ballroom Friday night.
About 500 people attended The Mr. and
Miss BSU Scholarship Pageant 2010, said
Talia Jean Cadet, marketing director for the
BSU Pageant.
The winners each received a $500 schol-
arship.
Archie Moss Jr. and Asia Jones were the
first runners-up and also won awards for
best male and female talent.
Ana Duperval, Leonard Thompson Jr.,
Murielle Joseph and Vonecia Carswell also
competed in the pageant.

and the Gators
finally found their
outside shooting
touch against Van-
derbilt in Nashville
on Saturday, but
poor defense cost
them their confer-
ence opener.
See Story, Page 14.The decorations of pearls, brass instru-
ments and music notes represented the
pageant's theme of 1920s Harlem. Cadet
said Harlem became known as a cultural
hub for African Americans starting in the
1920s.
"For me, Harlem is
sophistication," she said.
"Harlem is culture. Har-
9 lem is history."
The pageant blended
its historic theme with
.1' modern technology by
Dufe " asking audience members
to Tweet about the acts.
The hosts read the Tweets to the crowd
during breaks between performances.
Cadet, the marketing director, said Twit-
ter was a fun way to engage the audience.

Locals learn about hypnosis
By CAITLIN O'CONNER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Despite a quiet mood and the soothing voice
of hypnotherapists Saturday, Gainesville resi-
dents were not getting sleepy.very sleepy.
Instead, the attendees listened attentively to
seven certified hypnotherapists discuss topics
ranging from stress management to weight loss
through hypnotism in honor of World Hypno-
tism Day.
World Hypnotism Day, officially Jan. 4 but
celebrated throughout the week, is dedicated to
dispelling myths and promoting the truth about
hypnotism, according to its Web site.
Although this is the holiday's sixth year of
recognition, Saturday was the first time the day
was celebrated in Gainesville, said Carol Perrine,
a certified clinical hypnotherapist and co-orga-
nizer of the event.
Intrigued by the idea, Gainesville residents
like Helen Kiefer crowded Books-A-Million on
Northwest 13th Street and braved the cold to at-
tend and learn more about the mysterious topic.
"It's not a voodoo thing like some people
think," Kiefer said.
Perrine said many of the misconceptions
about hypnotism that World Hypnotism Day
seeks to remove come from the idea that hypno-tism is a form of mind control.
"The idea is that you can be made to quack
like a duck," she said, "but the truth is you can-
not be made to do anything that you wouldn't
do normally, legally or morally."
World Hypnotism Day also seeks to raise
awareness of the medical and dental uses of hyp-
notherapy, Perrine said.
Hypnotherapy can help people stop smok-
ing, lose weight, raise low self-esteem and even
fix procrastination, Perrine said.
"The idea is that you can be made
to quack like a duck. But the truth
is you cannot be made to do any-
thing that you wouldn't do normally,
legally or morally."
Carol Perrine
certified clinical hypnotherapist
Lily Blanchet agreed, saying she had previ-
ously been hypnotized with great success.
She came to the event for presentations on
stress and weight loss, hoping they might help
in the same way they helped her quit smoking.
"After hypnotherapy," she said, "I feel as
though I can do anything."Professors win award
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Writer
Three UF professors can now
make a world of difference after re-
ceiving Fulbright Scholar grants to
teach or conduct research abroad
this year.
Ido Oren, an associate professor
of political science; Paul Robinson,
an assistant professor of architec-
ture; and Sheryl Kroen, an associate
professor of history, will be teaching
around the world.
Kroen will be lecturing in Italy,
while Robinson will teach and con-
duct research in Slovenia and north-
ern Italy.
Oren, whose specialty is in for-
eign relations, will travel to Beijing,
China, in mid-February and stay for
four months to instruct students in
U.S. foreign policy and foreign rela-
tions theory.
He said he will be teaching two
graduate-level courses but plans tobe just as much a student as his pu-
pils.
"I'll be teaching, but I'll be able
to learn a lot about China and about
how Chinese students perceive the
world," he said.
UT Provost Joseph Glover said
the program provides a new research
opportunity for faculty and a chance
to represent UF around the world.
"They serve as
UF ambassadors ofAcademics goodwill for the
country and [UTI
to the universities
they go and teach at," he said.
The Fulbright Program is a feder-
ally funded international exchange
program that allows students and
faculty to study, teach and conduct
research abroad.
According to the program's Web
site, the Fulbright U.S. Scholar Pro-
gram gives grants to about 1,100
American scholars and professionals
per year.

Congressman plans to support student interests
* MEEK WILL RUN FOR U.S.
SENATE IN 2010.
By MATT HARRINGER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Florida's 2010 Senate race has been gener-
ating headlines since Gov. Charlie Crist an-
nounced his candidacy last spring.
And as Crist's primary race against Marco
Rubio soaks in the media spotlight, a demo-
cratic candidate running for Senate is also vy-
ing for his position on the political stage: Mi-
ami Rep. Kendrick Meek.
Although Meek is expected to win his
primary race against former Miami Mayor
Maurice Ferre, he isn't speculating on whichRepublican would be easier to beat.
"I'm more focused on reaching voters and
getting voters to vote in the November elec-
tion," Meek said in an interview Thursday.
"Whoever comes out of the Republican pri-
mary, we will be prepared because of hard
work and leadership on the issues."
Meek was raised by a single mother, Carrie
Meek, and said she was the reason he became
involved in politics.
"My mother is a person of great commit-
ment," Meek said. "She's the reason why I'm
in this race today -the reason why I'm in
public service."
When Meek was 11 years old, his mother
was elected to the Florida House of Represen-
tatives. She later became a state Senator andthen a congresswoman -a trail her son has
followed.
After graduating from Florida A&M Uni-
versity, Meek became the first black Florida
Highway Patrol captain.
While in the state Senate, he staged a sit-in
in Governor Jeb Bush's officeState to protest the governor's One
NeWS Florida plan to end affirma-
tive action in the state.
Meek said he found the courage to protest
in the governor's office for 25 hours because
Bush was trying to change public policy by an
executive order without public input. He said
that kind of courage is needed in the Senate
now, where they killed a public health care op-
tion he supported in the House.A main goal for the Meek campaign is to
win the highly coveted youth vote, a chal-
lenge that brought the Congressman to UF
last Thursday.
"We are really working hard to make sure
that we have as many young leaders engaged,
especially here at the University of Florida, as
possible," Meek said.
And he's treating the youth vote as a two-
way street. If college students vote for him,
he'll have to vote for their interests.
He voted to lower interest rates for student
loans and said he wants young people to leave
college without bearing a mountain of debt.
"I will be very much indebted to a number
of the young people that are involved in this
campaign," Meek said.

Comedy group kicks off semester
By AMANDA BROOKE WARD
Alligator Contributing Writer
Audience members got cozy Friday
night as they piled into the Orange and
Brew to see Theatre Strike Force's first
performance of the semester.
Theatre Strike Force performs im-
provisational games and shows similar
to those seen on "Whose Line is it Any-
way?"
Erik Voss, veteran member and for-
mer president of Theatre Strike Force,
hosted the show and asked audience
members to contribute topics, locations
and characters for the actors to use dur-
ing their performances.
In "Radio," actors were the voices for
stations like Jersey Shore radio, Amish
radio and Homemaking for Men radio.In the game "Kick It," actors had to bust
into a freestyle rap on cue.
The audience roared with laughter
during Kaylyn Brickey's rap about po-
tatoes.
Brickey has been in Theatre Strike
Force for a year, but she said the expe-
rience of being on stage is still "like a
trauma situation."
"You're thrust into it," she said.
"My mind is blank not only before but
after."
Despite the stress of performances,
the zoology major uses Theatre Strike
Force as her playtime when she needs a
break from academics.
"I saw Theatre Strike Force once at
my dorm, and I knew I wanted that -
to blow off steam and have a fun time
with funny people," Brickey said.For the game "Moving Bodies,"
Voss brought two volunteers from
the audience on stage to direct actors'
movements while they improvised.
Freshman Kelsey Kitts was one of
the audience members chosen. She had
to move actor April Dudash's arms and
legs while Dudash spoke lines match-
ing her motions.
"It was hard not to laugh," Kitts
said. "It made me realize how hard it
is up there."
While the actors fought off smiles
and chuckles to stay in character, the
audience's laughter was as constant as
a sitcom laugh track.
Sophomore Jenna Hankins saw The-
atre Strike Force for the first time.
"e was impressed," Hankins said.,,It
exceeded my expectations."Lara nicI~x/Riiigaor

COMMEMORATING MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.
Event honors civil rights hero
By MELINDA
CARSTENSEN
Alligator Contributing Writer
About 40 people gathered
Sunday in the cold seats of a
small church in Rochelle, Fla.,
heated by the warmth of cama-
raderie in their celebration of
one man's 46-year-old dream.
During the tribute Together
as One: Are We There Yet?,
those in attendance expressed
their appreciation of the Rev.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
with presentations to begin a
series of events throughout the
week honoring King."Racism was present
everywhere, even in
Gainesville."
The Rev. Milford Lewis Griner
Pastor, Hall Chapel United
Methodist Church
The Rev. Milford Lewis
Griner, pastor of Hall Cha-
pel United Methodist Church
where the event was held,
spoke about the history of rac-
ism and the local importance
of the event.
"Most kids take what
they have for granted," Gri-
ner said. "They don't realizethat right here in Gainesville
in the mid-'60s, dogs and
water hoses were turned on
black people, and that there
were separate bathrooms and
separate water fountains for
blacks and whites. Racism was
present everywhere, even in
Gainesville."
Inez Lucas, who is a mem-
ber of Hall Chapel, also thinks
King left an important legacy.
"We walk hand-in-hand to-
day because of everything that
he did," Lucas said. "This holi-
day is not just for one day. We
live Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
Day every day."

Tired of Tiger
America should drop
Tiger Woods fixation
member that YouTube video starring the overly
concerned Britney Spears fan begging the American
public to just leave the pop princess alone?
Well, the Editorial Board is considering making a se-
quel, only we'll be whining about the unfaithful golf pro
instead.
AT&T announced Thursday that it will no longer be
sponsoring Tiger Woods. Although the company didn't
use his image very often, its logo did appear on Woods'
bag.
The company is now among a long list of sponsors who
dropped Woods, including Gatorade, TAG Heuer (a Swiss
watchmaker), Accenture (a consulting firm) and Gillette,
which has stopped airing his commercials.
Now, don't get us wrong -we in no way approve of
him cheating on his wife (and we definitely don't approve
of his umpteen mistresses) -but isn't taking away his
sponsorships overkill?
America has put too much emphasis on stars' personal
lives during the last decade. (We're not above the usual
gossip -one of us is following all the Kardashian sisters

taken. So imagine the difficulty in trying to work out mari-

The American public (and its advertising companies)
just need to learn to stop kicking Woods when he's down.
After all, we're quite certain Woods is getting enough
heat from his wife; he doesn't need it from the rest of us,
too.

know it's nottime for Darts and
Laurels yet, but
the Editorial Board would
like to commend state Rep.
Christine Johnson for agree-
ing to carry a child for a gay
couple in Utah -one of
only six states in the U.S. to
explicitly ban gay adoption.
Johnson's decision may
not have raised many eye-
brows in California, one
of the 14 states that allow
gay adoption. But John-
son's child will be raised in
a state where 48 percent of
the population belongs to
the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter Day Saints and
more than 60 percent voted
Republican in the 2008 pres-
idential election.
But despite the risk -or
probability -of offending
those who make up much of
her constituency, Johnson is
making a bold move and a
step toward equality.Hopefully, her actions
will be noted in Florida
-the only state that bans
adoption by gay and lesbi-
an singles -and strengthen
the growing fight to con-
vince people across the na-
tion that it's cruel to deny
rights based on sexual ori-
entation.
In accordance with John-
son's personal act of sup-
port for gay parenting, "Sex
and the City" star Cynthia
Nixon partnered with the
American Civil Liberties
Union Saturday in Miami
Beach to fight publicly.
Nixon and the ACLU
hosted the kickoff event to
launch a campaign to repeal
Florida's 1977 ban.
The Editorial Board
hopes this is the beginning
of a war against discrimi-
nation that will start with
the eradication of adop-
tion bans and end with real
equality.

Political gaffes grow more rampant
t was a banner week for bipartisan tomfoolery, culmi-nating on Friday and coming from both Republican
National Committee chair Michael Steele and Demo-
cratic strategist James Carville.
To start the week off peachy, Steele, in an interview
with Sean Hannity, not only voiced his lack of confidence
in the RNC's chances for gaining control of the House in
the upcoming midterm elections, but also referred to him-
self as an "honest injun." In his defense, maybe Michael
doesn't realize it isn't 1956 -he should really fix those
crooked glasses of his. Regardless, he spent the rest of the
week backtracking both comments.
Then, in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting
Network, Steele said he is leading the RNC because he
was placed there by God. I suppose this means God is a
Democrat, go figure.
Beyond that, I'd have to agree with his implying that
he's merely a pawn -perhaps "tool" would be a more
appropriate word -simply adhering to a much larger
scheme of things. After all, what else but a divine plan
could place such a painfully out-of-touch, political-friend-
ly, fire-prone man at the head of his own party? Steele
presents yet another puzzling example of rationalizing the
inexplicable with the inconceivable.
What really surprised me about his interview, how-
ever, is that he made all the effort to appear on CBN and
talk about sensing this "higher directive," (having more of
a gut feeling than a direct line to the Big Man, I suppose)
and then neglected to ask for any money from the viewers.
I mean, if you're going to play your crowd like that, you've
got to commit to it. That's how the game goes. If he's going
to insist in reneging on his own party, the least he could do
is have some impromptu funding to show for it.
Here's how it should have gone down: Steele gets a
special message from God about where he fits in function-Ryan Spencer
letters@alligator orgally, then a message about where the
audience fits in financially. Boom -
that's $2 million in the RNC's pocket
by day's end. Steele's wrangler (or
whoever it is that makes him apolo-
gize all the time) needs to get him in
touch with Rick Warren to see how
that formula breaks down, because
R-Dubs knows how to run that
track.
Meanwhile, over on The Tony Kornheiser Show, James
Carville was busy losing his mind. As a solution for air-
port security, Carville suggested a system in which the
Transportation Security Administration would give him
a security pass, "and y'know, measure [his] penis and let
[him] get on the plane." I just hope he didn't first think it
and then decide, "OK, let's go ahead and say that."
Perhaps he's reaching out, in a way, and suggesting
that he alone is well enough endowed to take on potential
terrorists, no-handed (they don't call him the Ragin' Ca-
jun for nothing). Evildoers everywhere will cower in fear
at the thought of the blunt force trauma and black eyes
doled out by Carville's robust manhood. Of course, this
is entirely appropriate for a man who looks like a giant,
emaciated phallus with astigmatism -a Clark Kent for
the new decade, you might say. Perhaps we've found our
first actual super hero, folks.
These blunders make me wonder: Is it the oversatura-
tion of media that brings to light more gaffes than have
been the norm in the past, or is some Adam Smith-esque
invisible hand leading us to favor political personalities
who would be exceedingly entertaining on such grand a
stage?

Letters to the Editor
Nothing after 1980 compares to old rock
This letter is in response to Tommy Maple's column
in Wednesday's Alligator. The reason we love aging
rockers is very simple: There has been little or no good
innovative music since about 1980, roughly the "dis-
co" period. There will not be another time period like
the late '50s through the late '70s that produces such a
prodigious amount of great music. You can rail about
record sales, but remember, in Elvis' time, 50,000 units
was a huge record. Most of the talented, successful
younger bands will quickly tell you of their influences,
and I'd bet they'll name the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Eric
Clapton and the Allman Brothers -just to name a few
of my favorites.

Merger will bring accountability back to SG
Since its inception, the Unite Party has held an
electoral edge not based in original ideas, but simple
math. Using patronage and coercion to force voters to
the polls, and by consistently opposing and blocking
online voting, it stands only to maintain its election-
winning equation.
Over the last year, the Unite Party has remained
largely unopposed in Student Government. This is
why I was both excited and relieved at the merger be-
tween the Progress and Orange and Blue parties -ex-
cited for the original ideas that the new party will bring
to the election and relieved that the Unite Party will no
longer have free reign in the Student Senate.
I'm confident the shared ideas and platforms of the
merged parties will bring accountability back to SG.

Too soon to compare presidents
"I have never seen outright hatred for a president
like I have seen with Obama," is a quote from Paul
Murty's guest column on Friday. I would like to dis-
agree. First off, the only president our generation can
compare President Obama to is President Bush
Secondly, except for some seniors and graduate
students, we can not even recall any criticisms from
Bush's first term, so we can not equally compare them.
And, lastly if we look into our history we can see quite
a lot of hatred for our past presidents.
Half the country seceded during Lincoln's presi-
dency. In fact, the Southern states didn't even put Lin-
coln on the ballot when he ran for president. When
it boils down, we can't compare presidents until they
finish. It is often the leaders who are most hated during
their reign who are loved afterward.

Guest column
Gay marriage views influenced by statistics, representation
Found a chart online recently consisting oftwo pictures. The top picture had a map of
the United States with states highlighted
where gay marriage was legal: Massachusetts,
Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont and New Hamp-
shire. Pretty simple picture -five states. The
picture below it was the same map but with a
lot of states colored. That one? States where it's
legal to marry your first cousin.
Apparently, marriagebetweencousins isle-
gal in Alabama, Alaska, California, Colorado,
Connecticut, D.C., Florida, Georgia, Hawaii,
Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New
Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Rhode
Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Ver-
mont and Virginia.
And with restrictions, it's legal in Utah,
Arizona, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, North
Carolina and Maine. As one Web site put it,that makes marrying your cousin 500 percent
more legal than marrying someone of the
same gender.
What struck me about this pairing of maps
is that it makes an implicit argument. I always
think of charts and maps as being objective,
free from partisanship. I mean, get a Repub-
lican to show you a map of who voted for
Obama, and it has to be the same as the Demo-
crats' map, right? So we can trust maps and
make our decisions from there.
I never think of my opinion as being formed
just by looking at the map. But as I looked at
this chart, I had two impressions before I re-
alized what I was thinking. First, I thought,
"Wow, gay marriage really isn't that popu-
lar." But it's not like I've taken a poll of all my
friends and this map contradicts my polling.
I've gotten my perception of how popular gayrights is based on the
media. (It's very impo-
lite at UF to oppose gay
marriage, you know.)
This made me feel
a little manipulated. If
Will Penman I thought I was having
Speaking Out a revelation lookingat the chart, it wasn't
because it was a differ-
ent source. It's just that the facts and statistics
were presented in a different light.
It started to make me wrestle with asking
what light is best. But the light is pre-data; it's
how you're going to view the information.
Seems to me like you have to choose your po-
sition before you evaluate it, because the eval-
uating is affected by what your position is.
And that was only my first thought. Mysecond thought looking at the pictures was,
"Wouldn't the gay rights activists be so excit-
ed if they could make gay marriage as popular
as cousin marriage?" Now, maybe some read-
ers are in love with their cousins, but I haven't
heard much from the cousin-rights people.
In fact, I'd be embarrassed to even tell people
if I married my cousin. And yet, gay rights
groups would love to be only that offensive.
Presented on the map, divorced from trends
through time, it makes gay marriage appear
500 percent more distasteful than cousin mar-
riage.
Maybe all my awareness of being influ-
enced is just because I can't figure out what to
think about gay marriage. But it worries me
that I have to decide before I can think about
it. Wish me luck.

Defensive lapse costs UF SEC opener
0 FLORIDA STRUGGLED WITH FOULS AND VU

By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
NASHVILLE, Tenn. -Florida finally fixed its woe-
ful outside shooting, but one of the Gators' supposed
strengths turned into a glaring weakness Saturday.
Guards Kenny Boynton and Erving Walker combined
for 50 points on 11-of-22 three-point shooting, but UF
struggled with foul trouble, couldn't stop Vanderbilt on
the other end of the floor and dropped its Southeastern Copyrighted MaterialConference opener 95-87 in Memorial Gym.

the arc -a huge improvement on their recent efforts -
but showed no signs of the tough defense they prided Available from Commercial News Providers
themselves on early in the season.
With centers Vernon Macklin and Erik Murphy in foul
trouble all game, the Commodores (12-3, 1-0 SEC) capi-
talized down low, scoring 40 points in the paint and 18
second-chance points.
"It should be a great lesson for our team -and you
hate to have it happen here," Donovan said. "Here's a
game where we come on the road and shoot 52 percent
from the field and 48 percent from three and lose.
"There's some significance in the fact that our basket-
ball team has got to continue to be committed to playing
defense at the level we need to."
Donovan said the foul trouble was the source of most
of his team's problems, as it forced Alex Tyus to play cen-
ter and Dan Werner to play 35 minutes -a lot of them out
of position at power forward.
Tyus shot well, scoring 12 points on 6-of-8 shooting,
but managed just two rebounds in 30 minutes.
Even when they did play, Macklin and Murphy were
ineffective, combining for six points, four rebounds and
10 fouls in 27 minutes.
Despite the fouls and getting practically no produc-
tion from the center position, the Gators actually ended .
the first half up by two thanks to hot shooting by Boynton
and Walker.

It didn't take long for Georgia to put the
game out of Florida's reach.
UF shot the ball poorly throughout the
first 10 minutes of the game and dug itself
into a 16-6 hole early after committing five
turnovers and shooting just 20 percent up
to that point.
The slow start led to the Gators' 61-52loss to the Bulldogs in Athens, Ga., on Sun-
day.
"We made a lot of silly mistakes," said
senior guard Jennifer Mossor, who finished
with a season-high 11 points. "Our 16 turn-
overs in the first half was just awful. You
can't get into a roll like that, turning the ball
over."
Georgia's defense forced 16 Florida
turnovers in the first half alone. That didn't
put the game away, but it was too much to
overcome.Butler has encouraged her players to
shoot this season and even though the ball
hasn't found the bottom of the net, her
squad sparked a 9-0 run to narrow the gap
to a seven-point lead at halftime.
"Our 16 turnovers in the first half
was just awful. You can't get into a

Both teams came out in the second half
unable to muster the same type of firepow-er seen in the first half.
The Gators pulled within single digits
five separate times before Georgia iced the
game on free throws. The seven-point defi-
cit the team faced at halftime was the clos-
est it would come.
"1 thought our play was just very incon-
sistent today," coach Amanda Butler said.
She pointed to the team's inability
to establish itself in the paint, as well as
"streaky" shooting.
"The thing that really jumps out at me
was our turnovers in the first half, we just
really couldn't get any type of flow because

Urban Meyer might not be coaching on the
UF sideline when the Gators take the field to
open the 2010 season, but he's not letting his
leave of absence hinder the football program's
recruiting efforts.
Instead, with national signing day less
than a month away, Meyer and his staff are
vigorously pursuing remaining undecided
recruits. UF bolstered the
nation's best recruiting
class (according to Rivals.
cor rankings) Saturday by
landing three more sought-
after prospects at the U.S.
Army All-American Bowl
in San Antonio.
Elam The nation's No. 1-rat-
ed defensive tackle, Shar-

No. 1 defensive end Ronald Powell joined the
Gators' list of recruits.
Floyd, from Philadelphia (Pa.) George
Washington High, donned a Gators hat at
halftime and announced his commitment to
UF. The 6-foot-3, 310-pounder showcased his
quickness by breaking into the backfield to
make two sacks for the East team.
Floyd also considered Ohio State, North
Carolina and South Carolina.

UF suffers loss after shaky start
* EARLY STRUGGLES ON UN-
EVEN BARS COST GATORS.
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
etorrens @aliga tor org
After the long wait for the season
opener, the Gators proved they still
had some cobwebs in their first meet
Friday.
Florida (0-1) opened the meet on
the uneven bars and only managed to
score a 48.175, the lowest score of the
meet for either team.
The poor start was too much to
overcome as UF lost 196.25-195.275
to Oklahoma.
"We competed timid on the first
event," UF coach Rhonda Faehn said.
"That's a hole that we really just
couldn't get out (of). When the mis-
takes happened, it was pretty hard to
overcome point-wise."
The Gators were missing nine-
time All-American Melanie Sinclair,
who was kicked off the team after be-
ing arrested in October, on the bars,
as she posted the nation's third-best
average score in the event a year ago,
averaging a 9.92.
Senior Maranda Smith, who tied
for a meet-low 9.2 on the bars, was
quick to blame missed handstands
and botched landings for the low
scoring on bars instead of Sinclair's
absence.
"The thing we missed with Mel
overall with the competition was just
her attitude," Smith said. "We have
girls that can get the same score. We
missed her fun attitude."
The Gators made up ground on the
Sooners with a 49.3 score on vault.
They were led by Smith and fresh-
man Ashan6e Dickerson, who both
tallied scores of 9.875.
Dickerson was the meet's only
all-around competitor and earned
or shared the highest score in three
of the four events for the Gators. She
was the anchor on all three of those
events.
She finished with a 39.35 and
showed glimpses of what Faehn saw
when she said Dickerson could be a
heavy all-around hitter in the future
for UF."She did a phenomenal job," Faehn
said. "She just went out and did what
she does every single day in practice,
and that's what I was trying to share
with the athletes: You're not going to
perform any miracles at the compe-
tition site. You're going to compete
how you train."
Although the meet did not go
how the team wanted, it showed the
Gators what they need to improvebefore their next meet.
In their next competition, they are
going to have to be more aggressive
from the opening event.
"It was more of a meet where we
got our jitters out," Smith said. "All
the mistakes that were made were
jitters -with our bar routines -
they were jitters in the sense that we
weren't aggressive and we held back
so we made little stupid mistakes."

USC bound to slip
with Carroll leaving
ne thought for why Pete Carroll is bolt-
Jing for the Seattle Seahawks is because
USC is about to be hit with sanctions.
And I agree with that thought.
In fact, it's about time.
There has been an ample amount of proof that
Reggie Bush broke NCAA rules and took money
-and a lot of it -from a marketing agent.
And now, there is the investigation surround-
ing Joe McKnight, who is
also heading to the pros,
despite a lackluster three
seasons.
All signs are pointing
to trouble for USC, which
would mean the end of era.
Bobby Callovi Sure, the Trojans haven't
Bobby's World had the same national suc-
bcallovi@aligator org cess they had early in the
2000s, but year-in and year-
out, they are one of the best
teams in the country.
If the program loses scholarships and without
Carroll out there recruiting and with the recent
improvement of other teams in the Pac-10, USC
can expect a big dropoff in the wins column.
The three years before Carroll took over, the
Trojans were only 19-18 under Paul Hackett.
In his second year, Carroll had USC in a BCS
game and coached Carson Palmer, the first of
three of the next four Heisman Trophy winners.
He won seven-straight conference titles and
two national titles. His on-field success started on
the recruiting trail, and that's where he is already
being missed.
The fifth-ranked overall prospect (according to
Rivals.com), Ronald Powell, made his decision at
the Army All-American Bowl on Saturday, and he
did not put the Trojans hat on, despite being from
California. USC should no longer expect one of
the top classes every year. Instead, it should hope
the program is only put on probation and the loss
of scholarships lasts a few years.
If that does happen, the athletics director needs
to get a coach who can win with less talent. He
will have the players there now, and some of the
guys already committed to USC.
That should get the new coach through the
next few years, but after that, he will have to win
with great coaching and getting the most out of
the players that come in. He can't afford to have
the few talented players he will be able to get to
fizzle out.
Carroll rebuilt USC to the greatness it once
was, but he is now leaving it for another coach to
save from falling back to mediocrity.
Gators dive into spring season with two easy wins
Salamone sets two school records
By TONI-ANN MILLER
Alligator Writer
During two easy weekend victories for the
Florida swimming and diving teams in the
O'Connell Center Natatorium, the women's
squad made headlines on the diving boards.
On Saturday, UF's men and women de-
feated Indian River State College 174-102 and
168-101, respectively, having only exhibition
entries after 22 of the 32 scheduled events.
On Sunday, the teams began exhibition
swims after 26 events and topped LSU 157.5-
134.5 on the men's side and 171-121 on the
women's.
Senior diver Kara Salamone set a personal
best and UF record against IRSC in the 3-me-ter dive, scoring 356.11 points. That mark re-
placed the previous school record of 346.75,
set by Salamone last season.
Against LSU, the senior set another person-
al best and school record in the 1-meter dive,
scoring 318.15 points to replace her own 317.25
from a year ago.
Salamone's teammate, Monica Dodson,
also improved her personal best in the 3-meter
dive on Saturday by scoring 326.41 points.
"Monica and Kara have been diving really
well, and hopefully we're going to carry that
on through the conference championship,"
diving coach Donnie Craine said. "They've
had a great season, probably their best season
so far."
In the pool, UF had a routine weekend.Neither the men nor the women faced difficul-
ties on their way to amassing 18 NCAA provi-
sional-qualifying times over the two days.
"It is hard to get up and get ready for meets
that aren't quite so competitive, but winning
races is just great experience for the end of the
season," senior Gemma Spofforth said.
Spofforth had five non-
exhibition top-three finishes
on the weekend.
The dual meets were theSwimming first competitions for both
teams since early Decem-
ber, but there were no signs of rust.
"We had a great month of training," senior
Shaune Fraser said. "We had some time at
home, so the first (meet) is always an indicator
of where we're at."
The senior picked up six top-three non-ex-hibition finishes in the two days, one of which
was in an event he hadn't swam all season.
Fraser finished with a NCAA provisional-
qualifying time of 4:27.35 in the 500-yard free-
style, an event in which he won a state cham-
pionship in high school, according to coach
Gregg Troy.
"He's just a (really) good athlete," Troy
said. "It's not one of his best areas but he's a
tough kid. He's really matured a lot. It used
to be that he'd pick and choose, (but now) it
doesn't matter where you put him, you get a
great effort every time."
Troy added that he was pleased with most
of the teams' performance. However, looking
ahead,therearesomeareashewantstoworkon.
"We still aren't very crisp around the walls,
we've got to get better in the turns (and) we
were really slow on relay starts," Troy said.~ $ Pm

Ogilvy dominates Gators inside with 24 points, eight rebounds
HOOPS, from page 14
with a concerted effort to attack Florida's
foul-laden frontcourt.
"We came out to start the second half and
said, 'Hey, let's make sure we throw the ball
inside because they're in a little bit of foul
trouble,' and that just kept growing," Van-
derbilt coach Kevin Stallings said.
Commodores center A.J. Ogilvy scored
eight of his 16 second-half points in the first2:34 after intermission, giving Vanderbilt a
50-49 lead it never relinquished. Ogilvy, the
preseason All-SEC center, finished with 24
points and eight rebounds.
Vanderbilt's 53 second-half points were
the most allowed by UF since Feb. 14, 2009,
when Georgia scored 54 in the opening half.
"I told our team at halftime to just finish
off the game," said Boynton, whose 28 points
were the most for a Florida freshman since
Matt Walsh scored 29 on Dec. 28, 2002. "We
didn't listen, and I think we didn't finish offthe game."
With 29 total second-half foul calls, and
Donovan having to change
his lineup as a result of his
team's foul situation, the
Gators were inconsistentMen's on both ends of the floorBasketball and were simply outplayed
after halftime by the deep-
er Commodores, who had 27 points off the
bench to the Gators' 12.
"Every time you think you get momen-tum going, they come down and get a foul
or an and-one -they got so many and-ones
tonight," Boynton said. "It was just like we
couldn't get anything going."
Unlike in the Gators' previous losses this
season, Walker said he thought UF was pre-
pared to play and came out with energy, just
not enough to win.
"It's just something that happens," Walker
said. "We were mentally focused and ready
to go today, but we just didn't play a full 40
minutes."

UF guard Jordan Jones, who

road.
"We're obviously going to

Butler said her team didn't
really set up a presence in the
post -partly due to turnovers
that staggered momentum.
Azania Stewart, coming off
a career high in points, was
shut down by Georgia's 6-foot-
5 center Angel Robinson, who
finished with 12 points and 14
rebounds.
Freshman Jennifer George
crashed the boards with a career-
high 10 rebounds, but didn't
erupt as an offensive force, fin-
ishing with two points.
"I felt like when we didn't
finish or fought for a rebound,
we didn't take it back up with
the toughness and the grit and
the intent to score," Butler said.
"We were a little more worried
about maybe getting our shot
blocked, or maybe the fact that
we were getting fouled, and that
can't matter."

RECRUIT, from page 14
announcement to take a leave of absence in December,
Elam backed out on his commitment to Florida in fa-
vor of rival FSU but switched back on Saturday.
"I'm a Gator for good," Elam said in a postgame in-
terview for ESPN.com. "I'm putting my trust in coach
Meyer. I had a talk with him earlier this week, and I'm
trusting that he will be back."
Should Meyer return to his post, it won't be the
first time he has coached a member of the Elam family.
Matt's older brother, Cleveland Browns safety Abram
Elam, played under Meyer at Notre Dame in 2000.
Elam's high school and All-American teammate,
Gerald Christian, caught a touchdown pass for the
East squad. The No. 2 tight end in the country, Chris-
tian committed to UF in April.
Powell's commitment created the greatest buzz as
the game neared its culmination. The Rancho Verde
(Calif.) High defensive end is the nation's No. 5 overall
prospect, and he garnered MVP honors for his role in
the West's 30-13 victory.
Making contributions on both sides of the ball,
Powell demonstrated his physical prowess, and
looked like the complete package.
In the first quarter, he lined up at tight end and
reeled in a 23-yard touchdown between defenders in
the end zone. He also brought the first half to a close
with a sack and a forced fumble. In the second half, he
returned a blocked extra point the length of the field
for two points.
In choosing Florida over USC, Powell gives UF a
playmaker at a position that will lose Jermaine Cun-
ningham to graduation and may lose junior Carlos
Dunlap to the NFL Draft.
The Gators will be looking for more commitments
this weekend when they host Plano (Texas) West
High defensive end Jackson Jeffcoat and West Chester
(Ohio) Lakota West High linebacker Jordan Hicks. Jef-
fcoat and Hicks are evaluated as the country's No. 6
and No. 12 overall prospects, respectively.
Verbal commitments are non-binding until a letter of
intent is signed on or after national signing day, Feb. 3.
