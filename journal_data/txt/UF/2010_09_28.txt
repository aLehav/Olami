See Story, Page 14.LONDON (AP) — A wealthy British 
businessman who owns the company that 
makes the two-wheeled Segway has been found dead in a river in northern England after apparently falling off a cliff on one of the vehicles, police said Monday. The body of 62-year-old James Heselden and a Segway personal transporter were found in the River Wharfe and he was pronounced dead at the scene, West Yorkshire Police said.
Police said a witness reported seeing a man fall Sunday over a 30-foot drop into the river, about 140 miles north of London.
“The incident is not believed to be sus-
picious,” police said, indicating that they do not believe anyone else was involved.
Police have not revealed further details 
about the incident. A dozen members of He-selden’s family asked for privacy Monday after placing flowers at the heavily wooded accident site, which is popular with hikers and nature lovers. Owner of Segway company dies after riding Segway off cliff in England

Alex Sink, the Democratic 
nominee for governor,  visited 
Gainesville Monday night for a  
fundraiser, where she spoke about supporting new industries and crit-
icized her opponent. 
More than 300 people attended 
the event at Villa East on North Main Street — where donations 
were asked for but not required. 
“I feel like half of Gainesville is 
here tonight,” Sink said in an inter -
view before the event, which was closed to the press. 
Sink, the state’s chief financial 
officer, said Florida’s economic crises were due to a housing boom 
and bust, and the best way to pre-
vent another recession would be to diversify the state’s economy. 
“What we have to do differently, 
is we can’t get wrapped up in these big real estate plays,” Sink said. 
“We have to nurture businesses 
that represent businesses of the fu-ture, like biotech, and manufactur -
ing, and health care, and research — like right here at the University 
of Florida.”
She touted her business plan, 
which calls for supporting small 
business with tax credits and a 
three-year state income tax exemp-
tion for new businesses. 
Sink also attacked her opponent, 
Republican nominee Rick Scott, 
who has been running ads criticiz-
ing Sink for her support for some of 
President Obama’s policies. 
“He keeps brining Washington 
into the picture,” Sink said of Scott. 
“I think he should be running for 
president or U.S. Senate.”
She also criticized Scott for the 
amount of personal money he’s spent on the campaign.
“He’s already spent $70 mil-
lion of his own personal wealth to 
buy the governor’s office, and you 
know, I just refuse to let him hijack our state.”
The latest Mason Dixon poll, 
released last week, showed Sink 
leading Scott by seven points (47-
40 percent).   
Her running mate, Rod Smith, 
who prosecuted serial killer Dan-ny Rolling as a state attorney and 
served as Gainesville’s state sena-
tor, also attended the fundraiser in 
his hometown. 
Smith said as lieutenant gover -
nor he’d work on issues important to Gainesville. 
“While I will be as fair as pos-
sible, I am, of course, at heart a ga-
tor,” he said. 
In addition to supporting Shands 
and UF, he said he’d work on poli-
cies involving criminal justice, the 
judiciary and agriculture. 
Sheriff Sadie Darnell, a demo-
crat, said she was supporting Sink, because of her support of law en-
forcement and public safety. 
She also said she was concerned 
about Scott’s plan to cut $1 billion

Sixth period was lights out for UF students during Monday 
afternoon’s downpour.
The power outage affected most of campus between about 
1:15 p.m. and 2 p.m., leaving buildings and students in the 
dark. UF spokesman Steve Orlando said the outage appears to have resulted from a weather-related problem at the substation on Hull Road.
The substation is operated by Progress Energy, the univer -
sity’s energy provider. Orlando said the problem was on Prog-
ress Energy’s end.
According to a message posted on UF’s web-
site, the Health Science Center received priority attention during the outage.
Besides disabled lights, computers and telephone lines, air 
conditioning units weren’t running as heavy thunderstorms unloaded about an inch of rain in the area.
Orlando, who’s been at the university for almost 14 years, 
said he’d never experienced a power outage that affected so much of campus.
“Even through the hurricanes in 2004, we never lost power 
like that,” he said.Storm leaves

Shands at UF will embark on 
a five-year, $100 million endeavor 
to construct a new division for women and children, including a pediatric ER and inpatient and 
outpatient units.
The new four-story building 
will have 175 patient beds and will 
be built on already existing Shands facilities.
The plan was initiated partially 
due to a study done by a health care information services firm, Sg2, which showed an increasing 
demand for children’s services in 
the region. 
It is also a project of the Sebas-
tian Ferrero Foundation, which has been striving to build a children’s hospital in Gainesville.
The foundation was established 
by Horst and Luisa Ferrero after their 3-year-old son, Sebastian, 
died from a series of medical er -
rors at Shands. 
“[Sg2’s study] confirms our 
mission and the 
validity of our 
vigilant advoca-cy for transfor -
mative change, as it reveals the 
opportunity and 
necessity for major changes and investment 
in growth,” Horst Ferrero said in a press release. 
The Ferrero Foundation, 
Shands and UF will sponsor the 
new facility.Shands to build

Chants like “Hey, hey, ho, ho, police 
oppression’s got to go,” and “Same thing 
every time; opposing war is not a crime” 
echoed from the corner of South Main Street and Northeast Second Avenue on Monday evening.  About 30 protesters, led by the Students for a Democratic Society,  
stood outside Gainesville’s FBI Regional 
Agency from 4:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. to raise their voices against recent investigative ac-tivity concerning anti-war activists. 
Justin Wooten, an SDS member, former 
UF student and organizer of the protest, said the FBI entered, searched and confis-cated belongings from the homes of two of his  acquaintances. 
“We’re upset at the violation of civil lib-
erties of people just like us,” Wooten said. 
The goal of the gathering, according to 
Wooten, was to “end FBI intimidation.” 
The Regional Agency office did not re-spond overtly to the protest and was un-
available for comment Monday.
Some SDS members said Homeland 
Security had taken photos of the protest. 
At least four Homeland Security vehicles, 
including a K-9 unit, were parked behind the FBI offices but out of sight during the protest. 
“We’re here for extra security,” said one 
officer, who refused to give a name or fur -
ther comment. No Homeland Security rep-
resentatives were available for comment. 
“They can put you behind bars for sup-
porting any organization they deem a ter -
rorist organization,” Wooten said. “It’s 
a real threat to freedom of speech in this 
country.” THEY RAISED ABOUT $4,500.

It was 5:30 a.m. when Timothy Johnson 
got out of bed. He made sure to wake up be-
fore the sun rose to prepare for his daylong fast. His breakfast consisted of three nectar -
ines, eight glasses of water, and some Wheat 
Thins crackers. 
He would have to wait until sundown for 
his next meal. 
“It helped that it was raining,” said John-
son, a third-year UF political science major. 
“Not drinking water all day was the worst.”
Islam on Campus hosted the 2010 Fast-a-
Thon on Monday evening, where participants pledged money to benefit a local charity in 
the Gainesville area. 
Several participants like Johnson fasted 
from sunrise until sundown without having 
any food or water to drink.  The event chair -
person said that one of the main purposes of Fast-a-Thon was to help people who are less fortunate in the Gainesville community. 
“The purpose of Fast-a-Thon is to build 
bridges and close gaps between different reli-
gions,” said  Zubair Zafar, chair of the event.
For every participant, Islam on Campus 
pledged  to donate money to the Alachua 
County Coalition for the Homeless and Hun-gry . The organization raised about $4,500. 
“By fasting, we all see the blessing and 
luxury that we have,” said Noha Abdelgha-ny , a member of the organization. “We can go 
out and buy any type of food and drink at any 
time of the day . Meanwhile, there are others that don’t have that luxury.”

Student Government elections begin Tuesday, and the can-
didates are working hard to encourage students to vote and 
get their messages out. 
Unite Party spokesman Micah Lewis said his party’s pri-
mary objective is to get out and hand out fliers, which gives the party’s candidates an opportunity to meet potential vot-ers. 
“We’re a very visible presence on campus,” he said. “And 
it’s very clear to the students that we care strongly about these elections and are looking for their support.”The Progress Party isn’t doing anything differently. Party President Dave Schneider said his party also puts 
emphasis on getting out and talking to students, and it always has.
“Our strategy isn’t going to change last minute over the 
next couple days,” he said. “We’re going to be talking to stu-dents and communicating with them on the grassroots level.”
Most Independent candidates, many of whom will switch 
their affiliation to the Student Alliance Party if elected, also follow the same strategy. However, they don’t typically use fliers, said Michael Morales, a Lakeside Area candidate and  representative for the Independent Coalition of Students.
Instead, the candidates try to focus more on running by 
word of mouth.
Morales said he will also be giving free pizza to anyone 
who shows an “I Voted” sticker in the hopes of encouraging a greater voter turnout.
Amanda Griffin, supervisor of elections, said she suggests 
students remember to bring a form of identification to vote and make sure they go to the correct polling location.
She also suggested students make sure they have updated 
their addresses on ISIS, though there will also be paperwork available for them to update their addresses at the polls. 
There will be 19 places to vote, she said, including one 
at Southwest Rec Center and a new one at Keys Residential 
Complex.Student government candidates make last-ditch effortsStudents fast for charity

� ONE CRITICAL INJURY OCCURRED.
By ALEXANDER KLAUSNER
Alligator Writer
An estimated 14 cars crashed on Inter -
state 75 Monday, leaving one person criti-
cally injured and several others requiring immediate medical treatment. 
It is unsure how the crash first occurred, 
said Lt. Steve Maynard, a spokesman for 
the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office, but it wasn’t just one accident. 
“It was like a chain reaction,” he said. 
“More accidents continued to happen after the original crash.”Multiple semi-trucks were involved in 
the accident, he said. 
The accident occurred just 
north of the 390 mile marker on the northbound side of the 
interstate. 
All three lanes were blocked by the acci-
dent, though at 4:45 p.m., the sheriffs were able to unblock two of the lanes, Maynard said. 
UF student Cassandra Watkins, who 
commutes daily using County Road 241, 
was delayed as a result of the accident.
Watkins said it took her much longer 
than usual — an hour and 45 minutes — to make it back to her house.‘Chain reaction’ causes 14-car pileup on interstate
from the state’s prison budget. 
“I think he’s speaking from a place 
of which he doesn’t have much knowl-
edge,” Darnell said. “The things that he’s talking about don’t make sense ,and they seem to be very risky from 
the standpoint of public safety.”
About 15 UF College Democrats 
attended the event, and some were helping with registration.   
Kristin Klein, the group’s presi-
dent, said Sink is a strong candidate 
because she appeals to Democrats, Republicans and Independents. 
She also lauded her professional 
background. Before becoming CFO, Sink worked in the banking industry. 
“She’s a businesswoman,” Klein 
said. “She knows how to cut spend-ing and create jobs.”County sheriff also attended

Alina Fernandez, the daughter of Cuban 
leader Fidel Castro, will speak on campus 
Wednesday at 8 p.m. in University Audito-rium.
Fernandez, an outspoken critic of the Cuban 
government, fled Cuba in 1993. She currently resides in Miami, where she hosts a radio show 
and discusses Cuban politics every Wednes-
day . In 1998, she wrote “Castro’s Daughter: An Exile’s Memoir of Cuba,” which describes her 
life in Cuba as Castro’s daughter.The event, sponsored by Accent, coincides 
with the start of Hispanic Heritage Month. 
“We thought bringing her 
to speak would be a great 
way to integrate Accent with 
the multicultural month,” 
Accent director Zachary

According to Goldstein, 
Fernandez will be paid about $10,000 to speak at UF. The event is free to the pub-
lic with first-come, first-served seating. Doors open at 7 p.m.Castro’s daughter to speak

149 TOTAL VOTES64% YES36% NOMonday’s question: Do you think church sex scandals reflect poorly on Christianity as a whole?Today’s question: Were your classes affected by the power outage?In an election year turned upside down by the biggest 
Tea Party south of Boston and an overwhelming dis-taste for whoever just happens to be in office, UF stu-
dents will be given the opportunity today and Wednesday to mirror their detestation of the status quo — or just vote 
arbitrarily and   strike those special voting pens down a 
party line simply to collect an “I Voted” sticker so your sororities will feed you. 
Or you won’t care either way.We hope all of you will reconsider that last part, though, 
because as much as you want to think it’s all the same, it doesn’t concern you and you just don’t care, here’s the truth: You should care about Student Government elec-tions. 
After all, these are the people holding the megaphone 
to the student voice governing millions of your dollars. And although we think all parties would do a fine job in their fancy suits, we’re endorsing the independents. 
These are the 24 students who realized they couldn’t 
run with a specific party due to a filing error and still de-cided to join forces and fight for what they believe in.
Independent Coalition officials spoke to us Monday 
about accountability in a way we couldn’t disagree with. 
The independents want to get rid of frivolities like end-
of-year awards ceremonies and abolish certain SG perks, including spending on parking decals for SG officials, food money for the same officials and more than $100 a month for a handful of leaders. 
This should hit home for you — it’s coming directly out 
of your pocket. Sure, it’s a small sum against the multi-million-dollar budget, but think about it this way: Would you hand a $10 bill to an SG official who asked you to 
help him park on campus? Or would you feel that if you 
have to pay for your own parking or find another mode of transportation, he should, too? 
We agree that SG officials work hard and need help 
with expenses, but that’s what we pay their salaries for. When it comes to necessities like food, parking and cell phones, we have to draw the line.
And what do the independents want to do with the 
money? Give it back to you by expanding programs like 
GatorWell.
And speaking such political verbal death as eliminat-
ing government perks, the Independent Coalition of Stu-
dents recognizes this is only realistic if the right people are elected, and unfortunately, they’re the only ones who are willing to get it done.
We aren’t saying the Unite Party or the Progress Party 
are horrible choices. In fact, we support and agree with many of their platform points  No one can deny the ef-
fectiveness, for example, of President Ashton Charles’, a 
Unite Party member, reconstruction of the accountability standards SG committee members are forced to adhere to or the Unite Party’s effectiveness in its successful comple-tion of its student-generated platform points. 
We support the Unite Party’s desire to expand fair pric-
ing in off-campus housing, and we absolutely support the Progress Party’s goals to optimize bus routes based on ridership volume.   But with issues like those, we don’t 
anticipate any opposition. It’s easy to get behind a plat-

 What’s difficult is standing up for a policy change that

The Real Housewives of the Tea Party
Facing intense public scrutiny and lower approval 
ratings than Casey Anthony, Congressional Dem-ocrats decided this week to do the one thing that 
could give them a lift in the polls.
They quit.  By going home early and getting out of Washington, 
the Democrats in Congress get to sidestep pesky things 
like passing a budget and deciding whether or not to 
extend the Bush-era tax cuts. 
Maybe they were sick of missing all the new fall 
shows on TV .
Much more likely, though, is the fact that Democrats 
couldn’t wait any longer to get out of the way and let the Real Housewives of the Tea Party take center stage. 
Christine O’Donnell and Sharron Angle are both 
running for seats in the United States Senate, and both 
have won the Republican Party nomination in their 
respective states after winning Tea Party-fueled upset campaigns. 
That both are also insane is a real treat for Americans 
of every political persuasion.
Angle is like that one crazy aunt in every family, the 
one who ruins Thanksgiving after drinking too much white wine and making gay slurs at the dinner table. The only real difference is instead of being someone 
your family conspicuously avoids around the holiday 
season, she is someone who could potentially be in the U.S. Senate.
Angle is equal parts Good Housekeeping and Tali-
ban, a former substitute teacher who has repeatedly 
stated rape is God’s plan. 
She refuses most interviews, which is a good thing. 
Looking into her crazy eyes for an extended period of time is like staring directly at the 
sun, and she routinely struggles to speak without being overtly racist 
and homophobic.
Christine O’Donnell is a far 
more palatable insane candidate, 
mostly because she seems like a 
less threatening version of Sarah 
Palin. 
She is from Delaware, after all, a state filled with 
semi-conservative white people who probably do not like to hear O’Donnell once dated a witch and believes 
evolution is a myth.  
If Thomas Jefferson could stop spinning in his grave 
long enough to get his zombie hands on a working fire-
arm, he would shoot himself in the face out of pure Re-
publican shame.
With the economy in a lurch, the infusion of cash that 
will come from countless political ads aired during the 
next month will be a much more direct and effective stimulus than the hornet’s nest of legislation passed last 
year.  
Couple the aforementioned economic bump with 
these two unstable harpies/potential Senators un-
leashed and unhinged on the campaign trail, and maybe 
the Democrats knew what they were doing when they 
left town a month early.
It’s only going to last a month or so, but right up un-
til the election in November, I have a new favorite show on TV — the Real Housewives of the Tea Party, a hot 
mess brewed just in time for fall sweeps week.

A recent report indicates that while students might 
be incurring thousands of dollars in student loan debt due to increasing tuition, the value of a col-
lege degree is rising.
The report, “Education Pays: The Benefits of Higher 
Education for Individuals and Society,” was released Tuesday. The report stated that those in the workforce with a college degree earned more and were also more likely to be employed in comparison to individuals with only a high school education.
The report shows that the median earnings of work-
ers who had bachelor’s degrees was $55,700 as of 2008 — $21,900 more than those with only a high school diploma. The numbers also illustrated that those with a bachelor’s 
degree will earn approximately 66 percent more than 
high school graduates throughout a 40-year working pe-riod.The report also stated that the 
unemployment rate in 2009 for col-lege graduates was 4.6 percent, in comparison to a rate of 9.7 percent 
for high school grads.
“If it wasn’t clear before, it should be abundantly clear 
now that a college graduate is far more competitive in today’s workplace,” said Gaston Caperton, president of the College Board.
Caperton also addressed the concern of increasing 
student loan debt accrued by students to pay for tuition
“Even for students who use loans to finance all of 
their tuition, it would only take about 11 years to recoup the cost plus foregone earnings,” he said. “Over the long 
run, they would be much better off financially than their 
counterparts without a degree.”

Unite Party focused on helping students
Where are all the caring Independent candidates? 
During the past few days I have seen a lot of blue and 
nothing else. I ask myself, why would candidates for 
the Student Senate not be campaigning to win their 
seats? 
Could the reason possibly be that they have no 
record to run on, or perhaps they are ashamed of 
their fellow candidates in the Independent Coalition? 
Though I spent most of the past few days dodging the army of Unite volunteers across campus, I relented Monday when one walked me to class with an um-brella. I was genuinely surprised by the sincerity of 
the volunteer’s excitement regarding the election and 
the true passion evident in his voice. 
I was won over. I plan on voting Unite today be-
cause I like students who campaign on what they can 
do for me, rather than being preoccupied with attack-
ing their opponents.

Independent candidates not reaching out to stu -
dents
I have to say I was truly disgusted by Kevin Klepo-
nis’ letter in Monday’s Alligator. I have always been taught leaders should hold themselves to a higher 
standard of excellence. Kleponis demonstrated how 
not to be a leader. 
Members of the Independent Coalition have clearly 
chosen their course. They have made the conscious 
decision not to reach out to students and campaign on 
ideas. Instead, in a last-ditch effort to salvage an utter failure of a campaign, these so-called student leaders have decided to descend into the gutter. I have good friends in Student Government, and it upsets me be-
yond all reason to hear their integrity called into ques-
tion by a bunch of politically motivated lies. This is not the way to get students excited about campus in-volvement. The students do not reward liars.

Anthony’s Wood Fired Pizza is ready to bring the 
“real deal,” and amid 48,784 students, they  have plenty 
of mouths to feed. 
The restaurant opened Saturday, replacing  Mellow 
Mushroom at 1209 W. University Ave. The building 
had been empty since last fall. 
Anthony’s owners, Anthony Grey and William 
Trenchard, moved from their other location in Tampa 
due to the oil spill and resulting poor influx of tourists and residents. 
According to mutual friend and real estate agent, 
they heard the location in Gainesville was good be-cause the city is busy.
Anthony’s is two stories with an outdoor patio. The 
restaurant is open from 4 p.m. to 2 a.m.
The plan is to install televisions throughout, convert 
the second story into a sports bar and transform the patio into a tiki bar to contribute to the eclectic atmo-sphere. 
Anthony’s is hoping to take suggestions from cus-
tomers and present a chalkboard menu with seasonal items.
With a grand opening set to be around Halloween, 
Anthony’s’ goal is to offer fun, festive food including wood-fired, New York-, and Chicago-style pizza that “can get as creative as people want,” Trenchard said. 
All pizzas are available in 18-inch pies or by the 
slice. 
But Anthony’s doesn’t plan to stick to just pizza. 
They will offer Gator Bites, which are jalapeño peppers stuffed with a three-cheese blend and wrapped in ba-
con. 
The bites can be either grilled, baked, or put in a 
smoker and can be dipped in ranch dressing.8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 2010

Chris Rainey’s third-degree felony stalking charge was reduced to a misdemeanor Mon -
day. But he still will be held out of Saturday’s game against Alabama. 
By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmccall@alligator.org
 
Suspended wide receiver Chris Rainey 
took the first step on the way to rejoin-
ing No. 7 Florida on Monday, accepting a 
deferred prosecution agreement from the state attorney.
Rainey’s third-degree felony stalking 
charge was reduced to a misdemeanor, and the lesser charge will be dropped if 
he stays out of trouble, pays a $50 fine, un-
dergoes counseling and either performs 10 hours of community service or donates $100 to charity.
Rainey’s legal troubles began Sept. 14 
when he sent a text message to an ex-girl-friend that read, partially, “Time to Die 
[expletive].”
State attorney Bill Cervone said in a 
statement that probable cause supported 
the felony charge but the fact that Rainey was never in position to act on his threat 
made the crime a misdemeanor.
“The victim has, in fact, essentially stated that she was more annoyed than 
threatened and that she did not want an arrest or prosecution, only the resolution 
of an immediate problem,” Cervone said. 
The victim released an accompanying 
statement encouraging others to take a 
stand against violence but explaining her 
case as blown out of proportion. She also 
chastised the case’s handling by the me-dia.
“We felt this was a private, personal 
matter and did not want it to become the 
media frenzy that it has become,” the vic-
tim said. “The lack of sensitivity to our privacy has been disturbing, and we ask that our privacy be respected moving for -
ward. We are in full support of the deci-sion made by the state attorney.”
Rainey still has a few hurdles to clear 
before he gets back on the field. UF coach Urban Meyer said the redshirt junior 
will not be with the Gators this weekend 
against No. 1 Alabama.
“He’s not part of the team,” Meyer 
said.
Meyer expects Demps back: Meyer 
said running back Jeff Demps is wearing a 
protective boot after injuring his left foot 
against Kentucky. Demps had hurt the same foot a week earlier at Tennessee, and Meyer said an X-ray of his leading rusher 
showed a sprain.
“I took a deep breath on the sideline 
when they said they were going to get it 
scanned, but it came back negative (for a fracture),” Meyer said. “I think we are     Rainey agrees to plea 
deal for reduced charges
Sitting in an Atlanta subway car last De-
cember, my senses were overwhelmed with orange and blue.
There was still 10 minutes left in the SEC 
Championship Game, the final stop before 
the coronation of one of the best college 
football team’s ever. But the Gators were fin-ished, and fans had evacuated the Georgia Dome.  
All the preseason expectations, all the 
big-game experience, all the media infatua-tion. Squashed — all of it. 
There was one Alabama fan in that car, 
and he told anyone who would listen that 
the football universe revolved around the 
Heart of Dixie. The Crimson Tide played harder because, well, people from Alabama love the sport more.
Most Gators fans 
laughed it off; they had left the game early to avoid this de-
bate. But one middle-
aged man took the disrespect to heart, reacting with red-in-the-face anger.
This man was ei-
ther (a) the type of passionate fan who makes sports go around or (b) insane. Regardless, anyone invested in the Florida program re-
ceived serious pain at the hands of Alabama Gators fans need Crimson 
Tide to continue rollin’

With at least 30 arrests issued to UF 
football players during Urban Mey-
er’s six years as head coach, Florida’s 
program has come under scrutiny by 
many.
While the national perception of the 
Gators has changed as the arrests have accumulated, there’s one area that has 
gone unaffected by the team’s legal 
woes — recruiting.Four of the last five years, Meyer 
has put together a top-three recruiting 
class, according to 
Rivals.com, includ-
ing the No. 2 class in 2006, the No. 1 class 
in 2007 and the No. 3 
class in 2008. 
By the time Na-
tional Signing Day came around Feb. 
3, there were at least 25 instances in 
which a UF player was arrested. De-Recruits overlook arrests

CORAL GABLES — The question in-
volved the road schedule for the Miami 
Heat’s traveling circus, and as Dwyane Wade leaned forward to answer, he was barely au-
dible in the big room.
Wade paused. “I think they cut my mike 
off,” he said.
With midseason timing, two microphones 
simultaneously slid his way — from LeBron 
James on his left, and from Chris Bosh on his right.
“Thank you,” Wade said. “I appreciate 
you passing the ball.”
See? The Heat’s new power trio shares 
just fine.
Though hardly in need of publicity, the 
threesome assembled for a 20-minute news conference Monday during Heat media day, hours before the team departed to begin training camp Tuesday in the Florida Pan-handle.
Considering the scope of the event — 275 
credentialed media, more than two dozen TV cameras — the mood was subdued. Unlike, say, Super Bowl media day, there were no VIPs in the audience to rival the celebrity of the players. There were no audacious ques-tions or oddball outfits, either.
For the most part, the Heat merely seemed 
ready to go to work, even if they’ll do it un-der a microscope.
“This team is not built for us to go below 
the radar,” coach Erik Spoelstra said. “That’s a good thing. The expectations are there. We won’t run away from it.”Some expect the Heat to win every game, 
thanks to an unprecedented free agent haul that united Wade, James and Bosh. All were 
among the top-five picks in the 2003 draft, 
and all are All-Stars, but none has been in a situation like this.
“There are so many things being differ -
ent, even this media day,” Bosh said. “Ev-erything is different from what we all have either expected or experienced.”The question about who will take the 
last shot won’t be answered until the season starts Oct. 26 at Boston. As for the question 
of who was going to take the first question: 
It was Wade.
Sitting in the middle, flanked by the two 
Heat newcomers, he served as a moderator of sorts. At one juncture, reporters on oppo-site sides of the room tried to ask questions at the same time, and Wade interrupted.“There are two people talking,” he said, 
before nodding toward James. “I know he’s confused, because I’m confused, and Chris 
is, too.”
Wade restored order and kept his team-
mates involved throughout, such as when he 
defended the much-maligned celebration at the Heat arena after all three signed in July.
“We enjoyed it,” Wade said. “And 13,000 
fans in the arena enjoyed it. We did it for Mi-ami. We didn’t do it for anyone outside of that. I think it was fine.”
He turned to James, then Bosh.“Did y’all like it?”They nodded.“Good times,” Wade said.Bosh listened closely when his teammates 
talked and smiled easily, while James mostly stared ahead with a solemn expression, look-ing like he was ready to go on a 45-point binge at any minute. The reigning two-time 
NBA MVP tapped his fingers on the table, 
scratched his collarbone, stroked his mus-tache and laughed only once — when Wade teased him about leaving Bosh off his list of good ball-handlers.
James was more relaxed once off the po-
dium and in a smaller room, facing only a handful of reporters and photographers. He and Wade said they’ll continue such pre-
game rituals as baby-powder-rubbing, and 
Bosh joked he’ll need to come up with a simi-lar routine to complement James.
“I’ll make something up,” Bosh said. “I’ll 
watch his chalk-throwing and getting the crowd ready, and I’ll go to some other cor -
ner.”TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Burton earns SEC freshman honors
going to have Demps,” he 
added. 
Burton picks up SEC 
honors: Trey Burton’s perfor -
mance in The Swamp against Kentucky on Saturday was bound to earn him some ac-
colades.
On Monday, Burton was 
named SEC Freshman of the 
Week for his six-touchdown night, a school-record perfor -
mance that left Meyer prais-ing his multi-talented new-
comer.
“I think 
the important thing with a guy like Trey is that his foot-
ball IQ is off the charts,” Meyer said. “You say, ‘Trey, I want you to do this,’ and he does it. It might sound easy, but in the heat of a battle and in practice learning so many things, that’s hard for a young player.”
Burton said he spent most 
of his time since the game at home rather than soaking in his newfound celebrity, but his fans found him anyway. 
“I can’t add any more 
friends on Facebook,” Burton said. “For some reason, they have a limit.”
FOOT , from page14
last year. 
But while the Crimson Tide may 
have hurt you, the Gators need them. 
In sports, like in life, you need a con-temporary , someone who pushes 
you to greater heights. 
Florida players said their team 
brought a rock-star mentality to 
last season’s conference champi-onship. Their 22-game win streak gave the Gators a sense of invincibil-ity . Blood-thirsty autograph-seekers made them late to practice. Road games became a sideshow — “let’s go watch the national champions and Jesus’ favorite quarterback!” 
Alabama was Clubber Lang, 
doing pull-ups in a dungeon. Flor -
ida was Rocky Balboa, getting lazy against overmatched opponents.
And for Florida fans, the parade 
was fun; until it came to a screech-ing, embarrassing halt. But the loss should not have been shocking. 
UF looked sloppy against less-
talented teams in Mississippi State and Tennessee, but Florida was not pushed by an opponent last season like it had been by Ole Miss two years ago. And Florida entered the Alabama game averaging 10 less points than it did before the 2008 matchup. 
Of course, the Gators coaches 
had seen the cracks in their team. Watching film, it was impossible not to. But Florida was undefeated, and it’s tough to be self-critical when you haven’t experienced legitimate failure.
That’s not arrogance. That’s hu-
man nature.Urban Meyer has been praised 
for how he dominates UF’s rivals, Georgia, Tennessee and FSU. His 15-1 record against those teams stirs pride, but that success also creates concern for Florida fans.
Once considered national title 
contenders, each of Florida’s tra-
ditional rivals have fallen off as of 
late. Not counting games against the Gators, those three teams have a me-diocre .639 winning percentage since 2008.
How much credit Meyer deserves 
for those schools’ collective downfall is debatable. But without the Dawgs, V ols and ’Noles keeping the Gators 
up at night, Florida could theoreti-
cally fall out of fighting shape.
Greatness only comes when 
you’re pushed. Usain Bolt would not have coasted through those last 10 meters at Beijing if a young Mi-chael Johnson ran next to him, and the ’86 Celtics would not have been one of the greatest basketball teams ever if they had not lost the champi-
onship to the Lakers in ’85.
This season, the Gators are play-
ing with a carrot dangling in front of 
them. Whatever they do this week, four digits will rest in the back of their minds: 32-13.
Campus would have been a 
much more fun place last winter if Florida had cruised past a bad Ala-bama team. But the Crimson Tide are 
great, giving you something to look 
forward to all year. In the minutes before kickoff, you will be trapped in a glass case of emotion.
And somewhere, a middle-aged 
Gators fan will be watching, his face red with anger or excitement or joy.TYlER , from page 14
2011 class currently ranked ninth-best
spite that, Meyer and his staff put together the 
No. 2 class in the nation.
The recent string of arrests and national 
attention they have garnered doesn’t appear to be affecting the 2011 class either, which 
already has 15 verbal commitments and cur -
rently ranks No. 9 in the nation.
“[The number of arrests] never played into 
my decision,” said Ryan Shazier, a four-star linebacker from Plantation High.
Shazier, the No. 7 outside linebacker in 
the nation, committed to UF on June 21 — 
just more than one week after wide receiver Frankie Hammond Jr. was arrested and 
charged with a DUI on campus. Shazier said 
that during the recruiting process, the Gators’ 
legal issues never really came up because it 
wasn’t something his family was concerned 
with.
One recruit who did question the arrests 
during his recruitment was Madison (Mich.) 
Madison Heights High three-star cornerback 
Valdez Showers, who said he and his mother 
expressed worries about who was to blame for the high number of arrests and brought it up with UF’s coaching staff.
“My mom’s concerns were about whether 
or not the coaches were to blame,” Showers said. “But players do dumb things, too. Every-
body has a personal life outside of football.”
The arrests don’t seem to be ammunition 
for competing schools when it comes to re-
cruiting the same coveted recruits, either. 
Both Shazier and Showers said other coaches have not 
tried to get in their ears about 
UF’s run-ins with the law to try and dissuade them from 
committing to the Gators. 
And even though the le-
gal issues haven’t affected 
Florida’s ability to bring in top recruits, it still lingers 
and makes some of them think when consid-ering a scholarship offer from UF.
“It makes you wonder sometimes,” said 
four-star defensive tackle Timmy Jernigan, 
who has UF among his top-five choices. “But 
I really feel like if you go into college and you 
got your mind set on the right thing and you 
got your priorities straight, things like that won’t happen to you.”RECRUIT , from page 14Football

 The Gators have used an exotic 
defensive formation to stop the 
Southeastern Conference’s lead-ing rusher in consecutive weeks, 
but some believe that wasn’t its 
intended purpose.
  Ever since Crimson Tide run-
ning backs Mark Ingram and Trent Richardson shredded the Gators’ 
run defense for 195 yards in last season’s SEC Championship, Flor-ida has been looking for a ﬁ  x.
  “In my head, [I felt like the 
package was designed for Ala-
bama],” senior linebacker Brandon Hicks said. “Ever since the [SEC 
Championship], I wanted it back so bad. That game hurt so bad. We felt like we had the team to win, 
but we didn’t execute everything we were supposed to.”
  No. 7 UF will face its tough-
est test of the season Saturday 
against No. 1 Alabama when it 
goes against Ingram and Richard-son, who average 8.45 yards per carry and have combined for 664 rushing yards in four games this season.
  “I think we ﬁ  nally have that 
kind of personnel that we have the ﬂ  exibility to [use this package],” coach Urban Meyer said. 
  But it won’t be easy.  Ingram, who missed the ﬁ  rst 
two games of the season after un-
dergoing arthroscopic knee sur-
gery, has run for 308 yards in two 
games since his return.
  The “heavy” package features 
three defensive tackles on the 
line and pushes defensive end Duke Lemmens to a hybrid end/linebacker position on the strong side.
  “Seeing that [our linebackers 
are] smaller than other teams’, we 
don’t have to deal with them try-
ing to stack a big lineman in there to try and knock us off the ball,” Hicks said of the beneﬁ  ts to the package. 
  “We have [Lemmens] to stand 
him up and set the edge. That way 
we can come downhill and hit the 
ball as fast as we possibly can, basically to our advantage to use our own speed to kill the run.”
  The defensive scheme has 
already helped limit then-SEC leading rushers Tauren Poole of Tennessee and Derrick Locke of Kentucky to an average of 63 rush-
ing yards the past two weeks.
  However, the expected return 
of defensive tackles Lawrence 
Marsh, Terron Sanders, Brandon Antwine and Dominique Easley from injuries will strengthen the front four even more in its attempt to stop Ingram and Richardson.
  New defensive coordinator 
Teryl Austin emphasized the run-stop alignment in the spring, but a similar formation was already part of the Gators’ arsenal.
  “We actually had one when 
[defensive coordinator Charlie] Strong was here,” Hicks said, “but we never really had to use it because we would hit the ball 
before it crossed the line of scrim-
mage.” 16, ALLIGATOR  TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 2010

 “Heavy” package prepares UF for ’Bama RB tandem
“Ever since the [SEC Cham-
pionship], I wanted it back 
so bad. That game hurt so 
bad. We felt like we had 
the team to win, but we 
didn’t execute everything 
we were supposed to.”
