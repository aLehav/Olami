Haunted house doors
creak open today
By HILARY SHEINBAUM
Alligator ContributingWriter
Walt Disney World has fairy-tale prin-
cesses and a haunted house. Now Gainesville
does, too, but with a scary twist.
The Gainesville Junior Chamber of Com-
merce, or Jaycees, will hold its 14th annual
Haunted House at the Alachua County Fair-
grounds starting tonight and ending on Hal-
loween.
In groups of five or six, people will enter
a 1,500-square-foot house in the depths of
the woods and make their way through 13
rooms, numerous hallways and a maze, ac-
cording to Kristen Rabell, Jaycees commu-
nity director and haunted house head chair-
woman."I have seen a grown woman wet
her pants, and someone actually
ran out of their shoes."
Kristen Rabell
Jaycees community director
This year's event, The Enchanted Castle,
is inspired by fairy tales and Disney stories
twisted into frightening tales, she said. For
the past three years, the house's themes were
movie-based, asylum-inspired and deco-
rated to resemble the horror movie genre
respectively.
Tickets are $5 in advance and $6 at the
door, cash only. A portion of the funds will

Dorms test shower timers
0 THE YULEE AREA PLACED THE
DEVICES IN 86 SHOWERS.
By JENNIFER BATE
Alligator ContributingWriter
When Yulee Area residents take a shower,
they are not alone.
They have shower coaches.
The small, $2.80 timing devices, called
Shower Coaches, are suction-cupped to the
walls of 86 showers in Yulee, Mallory and
Reid, which comprise the Yulee Area.
"I really like them," said Haley Merritt, a
freshman Yulee resident."They really help. I
definitely take a five-minute shower now."
The timers were placed in the showers tohelp save water and are sponsored by the
committee that oversees sustainability ef-
forts within the Department of Housing and
Residence Education.
Sharon Blansett, chairwoman of the
Housing and Residence Education Green
Team, wrote in an e-mail that the program
is designed to educate residents on sustain-
ability issues.
The targeted shower time is five minutes.
Every minute spent showering uses 2.5 gal-
lons of water, so a five-minute shower uses
12.5 gallons.
"I'm a lot more conscious of the amount
of water I am using with the timers around,"
Merritt said. "It's something major that

did not hit the woman and "pivoted" to get
around her.

jured.
Bell said he knew she was 6-months

Members of UF's Model United
Nations and students linked them-
selves through their support of
global cooperation among nations
Thursday.
In celebration of United Na-

chain, which symbolized their sup-
port of global cooperation to help
developing nations on the Plaza of
the Americas.
Inspiration for the activity's
theme came from one of the U.N.'s
Millennium Development Goals,
which is to help nations that are
still developing -like third world
countries -succeed.

Seventy-two thousand people

These facts and others were
pasted upon the panels of a rep-

a group of UF students.
More than 100 people gath-

for the Freedom Without Walls
gala, which commemorated the
20th anniversary of the fall of the
Berlin Wall on Nov. 9, 1989.
"A large group of UF students
collaborated to bring the Berlin
Wall to UF," said Will Hasty, a
German studies professor.
For the past month, German
students and faculty hosted a
film festival, a speech contest and
built and tore down a replica of
the Berlin Wall.

The first-place winner, Heath-

the end of her speech, in which
she described her visit to Berlin
and how her parents met there
years ago.
"I was completely blown

sophomore Johanna Meyer said.
Meyer was one of the students
who helped build and paint the

After the student speeches,
keynote speaker Holger Teschke,
an author and former dramatist
in the Berlin Ensemble Theater

what he was doing when the wall
fell. He said there was a peaceful
rebellion the night the wall came
down and the world should use
this as an example to help make
it a better place.
"I wasn't expecting a tearjerk-

ing more of a celebration, but I
guess with this the two go hand

Shands offers tour of center

Alligator Contributing Writer
The wait to see the inside of Shands'new-
est building is over.
This weekend the UF Shands Cancer Cen-
ter is opening its doors to the public before it
begins admitting patients on Nov. 1.
The $388 million cancer center, at 1515 SW
Archer Road, will host an open house from 9
a.m. to noon Saturday.
Guests will be able to take tours of the facil-
ity and preview some of its 192 patient rooms.
They will also get to see some of the center's
departments, such as the stem cell lab and the
emergency department, spokesman Jeff Kelly
said.
The center was designed with emphasis
on bringing the outside in, Kelly said, and the
many windows give the building a unique
appearance -the hospital is surrounded by97,000 square feet of glass.
"It's absolutely a sight to see," he said. "It's
not the way your mind's eye would picture a
hospital."

People of all ages can attend the event,

children younger than 8, Rabell said.
During a previous haunted house walk,
a guest hyperventilated and had to be car-nied out by paramedics.

Barcia also developed somewhat

"People were shaking my hand

specific, Barcia said luck was on his
side.
"I was just ecstatic," Barcia said.
"I was going crazy. I jumped up into
the air, and I pumped my fist in the
air about five times. I think I broke
my watch."
He was heading to the final round:
The Showcase.
While CBS protocol prohibits Bar-
cia from disclosing the final outcome
of the show, he was allowed to com-
ment on his emotional reaction to the
60-minute game that would, in many
ways, change his life.
"I was sweating," Barcia said.
"There's all this pressure on you. I
can't stress that enough. Everything
happened so fast; you have no time
to really take it in."
As Barcia prepares to graduate in
the spring, currently working part-
time at the UF Athletic Association
as a customer service representative,
his experience on the show has im-
pacted the way he views himself.
"It's made me believe in myself a
lot more," Barcia said. "I believed in
myself. It made me remember to not
doubt the power of going after what
you really want."

6, ALLIGATOR U FRIDAY, OCTOBER 23, 2009
It's been a busy week at the Alligator (go figure). Just
when we thought exams were over and all was quiet
on the West University Avenue front, another parade
took us by surprise. This time, it was a festival of suck that
hit us like a dump truck loaded with your neighbor's rot-
ten Wu-Tang pumpkin that he carved way too early and
allowed to marinate in the sun.
We now present you with the how-long-until-we-get-
to-melt-into-our-parents'-couches-for-Thanksgiving edi-
tion of.
Darts & Laurels
For some reason, the university thinks it's okay to pe-
nalize all residents on the third floor of Riker Hall for the
mistakes of some jerks whose actions resulted in $150,000
worth of flood damage. If administrators get their way,
each student will pay $3,000 for the Oct. 10 flood. Resi-
dents only pay about $2,200 per semester to live there. We
shoot a way-to-take-the-easy-way-out-again DART at UF,
and we stab a way-to-not-man-up-to-your-actions DART
at the Kevin Costner-wannabes for their awful recreation
of "Waterworld."
Just when you thought a gunshot to the face would,
you know, kill you, 27-year-old Glenn Altman not only
survived but managed to drive himself to the hospital. In
addition to a blood-soaked apartment, police also found
a "small marijuana growing operation." For having crap
luck after having lead embedded in his skull, we give a
it's-a-good-thing-chicks-dig-scars LAUREL to Glenn Alt-
man.
We don't know how -or why -a wanted Georgia
man stole $6,000 worth of Steel Reserve and cigarettes
from a local Chevron early Wednesday. But we do know
this: Georgia sells 40-ounce beers, and the only way to
drink Steel Reserve is with the bottle duct-taped to your
hands while playing Edward-40-hands. For this, we give
a could-you-at-least-have-gone-for-the-champagne-of-
beers? DART at Oscar Tellez.
Way to "steal" the "reserve"! Ooooohhhhh.
A local CVS manager was arrested Friday and charged
with video voyeurism after a woman found his cell phone
secretly filming in the bathroom. For violating the pri-
vacy rights of dozens of women by filming them while
they peed, we give a hope-you-like-being-watched-when-
you-pee-too DART at possible future inmate Johnathan
Matheny. As if public restrooms weren't gross enough
already.
A local man was arrested Thursday after an apparent
scuffle with his girlfriend, who is six months pregnant.
The 6-foot-3-inch, 225-pound man reportedly elbowed her
twice and pushed her into a wall. In an argument over.
sports cards.
For what looks to be an extreme overreaction, we throw
a you'll-have-no-trouble-getting-on-"Maury" DART at
Jabaric Bell, who admitted that he believes he IS the fa-
ther of the baby.
When police called in the bomb squad to investigate a
suspicious backpack outside the Reitz Union on Monday,
the robot they sent in did a less than stellar job. For the big-
gest technology fail of the week, we throw a gritty, way-
to-drop-the-"bomb" DART at the bomb squad robot for
not only mishandling the potentially explosive backpack
but also for mistaking sand for fabric softener. Looks like
robots aren't good at everything.
That's all, folks. Hope you've got your costume ready
for next weekend, because nobody likes a slutty ghost.

UF should have sent text about th reat
his past week revealed a disturbing trend at UF,something that the entire Student Body should be
concerned about. Apparently it is becoming com-
mon practice around campus for students and bystand-
ers to leave suspicious-looking backpacks lying around
public areas and for the Gainesville Police Department
bomb squad to respond accordingly.
Or at least that's the message UF administration is
sending when it shut down part of the Reitz Union for
almost an entire day to a bomb threat but failed to uti-
lize the emergency notification system it touts each year
as crucial to our safety.
It seems that the administration either doesn't con-
sider bomb threats serious enough threats to notify us
or it simply is so inefficient at running things that it
failed at sending out a simple text message and/or e-
mail on its emergency notification system.
But seeing as these are many of the same administra-
tors who argued the addition of minus grades to our
grading scale would magically "raise" the overall GPAs
of UF students, I am leaning toward the second option.
Regardless, there are two reasons this failure should
go corrected in the event of a similar incidence.
Most importantly, it is flat-out dangerous. Thousands
of students use the Reitz Union each and every day for
various reasons like studying, eating and visiting the
Career Resource Center. By not notifying students that
a large portion of the union is shut down, there are two
negative impacts.
First, students take a significant amount of time out of
their days to travel over to the union only to get kicked
out or re-routed. Second, and even worse, the situation
becomes potentially even more dangerous when a glutof students is left hanging around
a potential bomb.
The second major reason why
UF needs to actually utilize its
emergency notification system in
instances like this is because it is
Kyle Robisch simply annoying when the univer-letters@alligatororg sity doesn't.
With spring registration just
around the corner, ISIS will surely be asking all of us to
verify our emergency contact information.
If UF thinks being able to actually e-mail and/or
text us in potentially dangerous situations is important
enough to prevent us from registering for classes, then
use it.
But when I drove past the union twice earlier this
week and had no idea either time why it was blockaded
completely, despite having my phone and e-mail open
all day, there arises a major issue.
And if you are lucky enough to have actually re-
ceived one of the many test text messages or e-mails
sent out by the administrators of the system, you know
it works, just like I do.
So a question arises: How much does student safety
have to be endangered before we are notified? If a bomb
threat at the heart of campus doesn't pass that test, then
does an armed gunman roaming around campus qual-
ify?
These are all questions students are left wondering
about after Monday's debacle. Hopefully we all find out
before it is too late.

Guest column
Govt. needed for health reform
While I believe that Neal Wheeler hasthe kernel of a good idea in his letter
to the editor, he becomes increasingly
more ignorant as the piece goes on. His idea
that the government can't be counted on to fix
everyone's problems is very true. The govern-
ment can't, in fact, fix everything. Perhaps the
government has tried too hard in the past to fix
all the problems in American society, but this
doesn't extend to health care.
First of all, you can't compare health care to
having a bad mortgage, to amassing credit card
debt that can'tbe paid off, to not saving up enough
money for retirement, or to not being able to buy a
new car. All those things are due, in the most part,
to irresponsibility on the part of the consumer.
Health care, however, is not due to irresponsi-
bility, at least for the most part.
Wheeler chooses to focus on the obese and
the smokers of the world, as if they are the only
ones crying out for health care reform. Many of
the people that simply want to be covered want it
because they will/do suffer from genetic diseases,
or other ailments through no fault of their own.
Take Christina Tucker from the Alligator's edi-
torial as an example. She was raped, and she can't
get coverage. Is that her fault? No.
Wheeler says, "You can get in shape or stopPaul Murty smoking," in response to
SpeakingOut the cries for a public op-Spea king Out__ tion. What Wheeler doesn't
realize, though, is that it is
more than simply changing to a healthy lifestyle.
Sometimes you need legitimate help because of
things you have no control over.
I'd love to see Wheeler tell people like my
brother, a recent college grad who can't afford
health care, to shape up and buy his own health
care. Wheeler's solution for the poor is that they
qualify for Medicaid, anyway.
The minimum qualifications for Medicaid, ac-
cording to govbenefits.org, are that you must class
as low or very low in the income scale. You must
also be either pregnant, a parent of, or a caretaker
of dependent children younger than 19; be blind;
take care of someone with a disability; or be older
than 65 years of age.
That doesn't sound like my brother, who is 26
and neither blind, nor a guardian, nor disabled.
The health problems people incur during their
lives aren't always the result of irresponsibility,
like the credit card or mortgage problems. Health
care needs legitimate reform, and the government
is legitimately being relied upon to take care of a
huge problem.
Paul Murty is an english sophomore at UF.Letters to the Editor
Medicaid could fix health care issue
Mr. Wheeler makes an excellent point.
If you can't afford health care, don't go
running to the government to solve your
problems. Just get on Medicaid!
Medicaid is a wonderful little char-
ity that everyone in America contributes
a little money to for the benefit of those
poorest around us. Isn't it wonderful the
things we can do without the govern-
ment in our lives?

Asbestos nothing new on campus
As great as it is to read about our stu-
dent senators feeling "uncomfortable"
regarding the health of hotel guests, I
would like to take this opportunity to
remind our representatives that as resi-
dents of Rawlings Hall we live under
these circumstances every day.
Asbestos has been found in both our
ceilings and piping providing difficulties
for both maintenance and a desperately
needed renovation.
So while you allocate money to the
removal of asbestos in the Reitz hotel
we will just sit tight over here, patiently
waiting our turn. Try not to "fear" for our
health too much.

UF has money to repair Riker Hall
When I saw on Monday that the third
floor of Rinker hall would be required to
pay $3,000 each for damages, I was flab-
bergasted.
Imagine, you're sitting in your dorm
studying, when the sprinklers shoot on.
Your night is now ruined, and the com-
fort the school gives you is a $3,000 bill
for something you didn't even take part
in. While the school should not be re-
sponsible for the entire bill, the students
who were not absent-mindedly kicking
a ball inside a dorm that caused the inci-
dent should not be punished with a bill.
And then I turn the page to see some-
one has proposed implementing a stu-
dent fee to fix the Reitz Union hotel to
make it asbestos free. That's dandy, we
should all get a bill from UF to pay for
a service we take no part in so that the
school doesn't have to pay for it.
I remember seeing somewhere lastyear that Bernie Machen has the second-
highest public school salary in the nation,
meanwhile UF is cutting undergraduate
departments.
As much as I love sports and all, this
school is becoming too sports-oriented.
We just spent who knows how many mil-
lions of dollars building a lacrosse field
and soccer field and fixing up Southwest
Rec Center, meanwhile we can't get away
with building a study center. While I love
sports just as much as the next student,
what makes a country strong and inde-
pendent is not sports -it's the education
that the population has.

Prof. shouldn't have been reinstated
Good for the anthropology depart-
ment for defending diversity and minori-
ties. What could be more diverse and be a
smaller minority than a reckless-driving
professor who attempts to exchange
drugs for gay sex near a church? Shame
on UF for reinstating such a creeper.

Comedian with Tourette syndrome
mischaracterized
I was severely disappointed in the
representation of Louis Centanni con-
cerning the front-page article. Certain
inaccuracies were statedthat all together
misrepresented not only Louis himself,
but all thosesuffering with Tourette Syn-
drome.
First, subjugating the disease to say-
ingthat the ticks can be controlled is a
gross exaggeration. Louis was sayingthat
through acting, miraculously he can con-
trol his ticks, however he isaware and
mentioned that the ticks are uncontrol-
lable and mostlyunnoticeable to him.
Moreover, I feel that the article complete-
lymisunderstood Louis's objective in giv-
ing the talk. He was not saying thatliving
with Tourette's is "not so bad." He com-
pletely acknowledged thestruggle it was
and is for him concerning his battle with
the public schoolsystem and also every-
day tasks. Louis's point was that life goes
on and that he does not let his disease de-
fine him.

Kyle Maistri is still fuming about
the money he (would have) lost (if we
condoned gambling here in the alliga-
torSports Brand Picks Column but we
don't, so he isn't) because of Washing-
ton last week. And there are few things
that Mike DiFerdinando loves more
than Jake Locker and UW football.
So we thought it would only be ap-
propriate for the two of them to break
down this week's clash between the
Huskies and the Ducks.
WASHINGTON WILL WIN BECAUSE.
This is the week Jake Locker proves to
Kyle Maistri and the rest of the world
he's one of the nation's elite quarter-
backs. The "West Coast Tebow" has
already led the Huskies to three more
wins than last year (they were 0-12)
and has blossomed as a passer un-
der new head coach Steve Sarkisian.
The 6-foot-3, 226-pound junior has
completed 57.2 percent of his passes
this season and has thrown for 1,702
yards and 11 touchdowns. That's
more yards (1,032) and touchdowns
(8) than Gainesville Tebow.
-MIKE DiFERDINANDO
OREGON WILL COVER THE -10 POINT
SPREAD BECAUSE. Washington is
simply a mediocre team, at best.
It stands to reason then that DiFer
would like the Huskies, as he is gen-
erally mediocre, at best. Washington
is the most celebrated 3-4 team in the
history of college football, and putting
Jake Locker in the same sentence as Tim
Tebow is criminal.
Unless of course that sentence reads,
"Tim Tebow could have all of his dis-
cernible talents and skills sucked from
his body in a Space Jam-esque manner,
and still the Florida quarterback would
be better than Jake Locker." Locker
would undoubtedly play the goofy Bill
Murray character in such a remake.

0 FLORIDA HAS LOST ITS
LAST FOUR IN STARKVILLE.
By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
m mcca ll@a Iligator org
Forget Dan Mullen.
When Mullen left Florida for
the head coaching gig at Missis-sippi State after last season, this
weekend's matchup between the
Gators and Bulldogs gained in-
stant relevance as the battle be-
tween Urban Meyer and his for-
mer sidekick.
But recent events have changed
the game's meaning.
After a lackluster showing last
week against Arkansas, No.2 Flor-ida (6-0, 4-0 Southeastern Confer-
ence) has something to prove dur-
ing its trip to Starkville.
The Gators were surpassed by
Alabama for the top spot in the AP
poll, and getting back on track for
a run to a national title takes prec-
edent over the family reunion.
"We won't be thinking about
it while we're playing, but after

Tight end Aaron Hernandez is 22 receiving yards away from topping his output from all of last sea-
son, but he said UF's offense isn't as explosive as it's been in the past.the game we'll probably go up
to them," tight end Aaron Her-
nandez said. "It won't be weird
because they're an opponent, and
they're in our way."
The Bulldogs (3-4, 1-2 SEC)
don't appear as dangerous as the
Razorbacks, but Florida has lost its
last four trips to Starkville, and re-
peating last week's mistakes (four
fumbles, 3 for 6 in the red zone)
could certainly yield an upset.
Cleaning up that sloppy offen-
sive performance willbe a priority.
Although Florida's offense ranks
in the nation's top 11 for rushing,
total yardage, scoring and pass ef-
ficiency, the unit has come under
fire for uncreative play-calling
and poor execution.
Getting receiver Deonte
Thompson more involved in the
passing game is also key, as Her-
nandez and receiver Riley Cooper
have accounted for the majority of
the team's receptions.
There's still room for improve-
ment, but Hernandez doesn't
think the offense should be held to
the same standard as years past.
"I think we're not the offense
that's going to be putting up
points on one-play drives like
[Thompson's 77-yard touchdown
against Arkansas]," he said. "It's
not going to happen that often.
We're a team that's going to pun-
ish the ball, drive it down the field,
run it and use play-actions. I don't
think people should expect us to

In 2008, this came at Arkansas as Florida
used 21 unanswered points in the fourth
quarter to break open a 38-7 victory.
The scenario sets up well for UF to repeat
such a dominant performance as it prepares
to face a less-than-stellar Southeastern Con-
ference foe with a pretty weak defense in its
way.
Last year, Arkansas finished 72nd in the
nation in total defense and No. 93 in scoringbuoyed by the fact the
season is only halfway through, and MSU has
had a few cupcake games -Jackson State and
Middle Tennessee -to help the numbers.
It still has to face Florida, Alabama and
Arkansas, three of the SEC's top four scoring
offenses.
The Dan Mullen factor is worth a little
something, although Mississippi State's tal-
ent level won't allow Mullen to put his in-
depth knowledge of the Florida offense tomaking the offensive leap it made a year ago,
a few specific deficiencies must be cleaned
up.
The Gators are only scoring on 80 percent
of red zone trips, compared to 95.8 percent in
the first six games of 2008.
A big reason is UF's surprisingly high
number of turnovers. Florida finished +22 in
turnover margin last season, good for No. 2
in the nation.

say for DiFer. -KYLE MAISTRI
Now on to the picks!
Still hanging on to first place with a record of 38-31 is Mike "Logistical
Knightmare" DiFerdinando, who has spent the last few weeks planning out
his currently non-existent musical career. We don't want to spoil it, but it
involves skin-tight leather pants, a members only jacket and a Bedazzler.
In second with a record of 36-33 is Mike "I'm going to throw up on your
lap" McCall, who was so upset that he couldn't spend Thursday night in
Tifton, Ga., that he threatened to projectile vomit all over DiFer's bedazzled
leather pants. Or maybe it was the pants that upset his stomach.
Tied with Mike, we have Bobby "I like a teenage boy in uniform" Callovi
and the Gainesville Sun's Ed "The South will rise again" Aschoff. While Bob-
by is probably already painting his chest for the Hoover High football game
Friday night in Birmingham, Ed was undoubtedly disturbed by news that
his beloved Ole Miss is changing one of its fight songs. Now who's going to
confuse him with Dave Chappelle's black blind white supremacist?
Next, with a record of 35-34 we have Kyle "I like my large quantities of
meat late at night" Maistri, who is outraged at the thought of scarfing down
Dreamland's famous ribs first thing in morning.
With a record of 34-35, is Phil "That's classified" Kegler, who is keeping
his LSAT score under lock and key. We'd be embarrassed, too, if we found
out we couldn't go to law school in a country with running water.game plan to stop UF's offense, see- will know what it's up against.

With a record of 31-38 is the Orlando Sentinel's Jeremy "More blush,

illustrious Gator Country TV show this week.
Not far behind with a record of 30-39 is the Florida Times-Union's Mike
"Kids pick the damndest games" DiRocco, who for the second time this year
defaulted to the favorites. He's too old to stay up for the West Coast games.
With a record of 27-42, it's the Miami Herald's Joe "I've got a fever"
Goodman, whose only question to offensive coordinator Steve Addazio was
about MSU fans' cowbells. He's not afraid to ask the tough questions.
And in dead-last place with a piss-poor record of 22-48 is the Palm Beach
Post's Ben "Was that Chandler or Miley on stage?" Volin, who embarrass-
ingly tried to hit on Parsons after mistaking him for the underage teen pop
star he loves so much.

Gators dominate SEC-leading Tigers
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Writer
tjett@alligator org
The top of the Southeastern Conference
is now muddled.
No. 17 LSU (10-3-3, 6-1-1 SEC) came
into Gainesville on Thursday tied for first li_
in the SEC, but the Tigers were dominated
by the No. 12 Gators 4-0, and, with just
two games left on the year, the conference
championship will most likely be decided
in the season finale.
UF will host South Carolina, the other
conference leader, Oct. 30.
Coming into Thursday's game, the
Gators found themselves in a must-win
situation.
"How wouldn't it make you focus?"
freshman McKenzie Barney said. "It is the
ultimate competitive situation."
Barney, who was making just her sec-
ond start on the season, kept LSU on its
toes.
After midfielder Angela Napolitano's
low corner kick was deflected into the air
by sophomore Sarah Chapman, an LSU
player botched a clear attempt. The ball
found Barney two yards away from the
goal, and the forward headed it in uncon-
tested in the fifth minute.
"Somebody kept the keeper away,
which was definitely a bonus for me," Bar-
ney said.
Florida added another goal in the 32nd
minute when senior Lauren Hyde served
a free kick into the penalty box that Chap-
man was able to head into the lower left
corner from 15 yards out. The Gators put
the Tigers away early in the second half
when freshman Brooke Thigpen wrestled
the ball from an LSU defender inside the Steven H. Keys/ Alligator
penalty box and scored from 12 yards out. UF midfielder McKenzie Barney kicks the ball during Florida's 4-0 win over LSU at

PHIL,from page 13
This fall, the Gators sit at minus 2,
tied for 76th in the nation.
Do I expect UF's fumbling ways to
persist through the whole season?
No, but playing the what-if game for
too long is like continually betting hard
sixes at the craps table.
Eventually, seven hits and all is lost.
If Tebow didn't fumble near the goal
line against Tennessee, Florida might
finish with a 30-6 win.
If UF didn't decide to just play con-
servatively against LSU, the offense
could've done more.
If the Gators didn't fumble twice
within the Razorbacks'10, they could've
won by several touchdowns and not
been forced to kick a game-winning field
goal.
There is something to be said for a
team being forced to fight through ad-
versity, especially if it comes out the
other side undefeated.
But there is still plenty of risk.
What if those things never get fixed?
What if UF can't stop turning the ball
over? What if teams stack the box and
the passing game lets Florida down?
The Gators' national championship
hopes could use a boost from a great
game by the offense.
Can it reproduce the eye-popping
stats of last season?
Probably not, and UF players and
coaches seem like they're beginning to
realize this.
But with just a little more offense and
a fixing of the fundamentals, the Gators
are a game away from fans wondering
why they were so worried.
Otherwise, Florida will be playing
in a bowl far from Pasadena this win-
ter, asking what if it could turn back the
clocks one more time.
