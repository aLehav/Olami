Gun shots erupted at a family home 
nestled north of Newberry on Monday 
night, leaving a man and woman injured 
but the children unharmed.
The victims initially called the Alach-
ua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce at about 10:30 
p.m. to report suspicious people near their home, located at 3707 NW County Road 
235. 
But as Alachua deputies made their 
way to the victim’s house, they received 
another call within 10 minutes to report 
that two people had since been shot.
It is not clear at this time whether more 
than one person was involved in the shoot-
ing.
When deputies arrived at the scene, the shooter or shooters had ﬂ  ed. 
Law enforcement were able to provide 
security for the injured man and woman and the two children, allowing them to leave the house safely.
Emergency Medical Services transport-
ed both injured adults to a nearby hospi-tal, according to Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce spokeswoman Sgt. Becky Butscher. 
The children — both girls, ages 10 and 7 — remained unharmed.
After the family was evacuated from 
the house, Butscher said deputies con-ducted a thorough search of the area but were unable to locate anyone or ﬁ  nd any additional evidence.
Bullet holes littered the front of the 
house, ﬁ  red from multiple locations. They shattered glass windows and splintered wood paneling.
A sheriff’s ofﬁ  ce news release said that 
the bullet holes patterns are consistent Two people injured after shooting near Newberry

Alachua County library cards are available 
on campus this week as part of a national cam-
paign to encourage students to utilize their lo-cal libraries. 
This is the ﬁ  rst time the Alachua County 
Library District is participating in September Library Card Sign-up Month.
About 55 students signed up for free cards 
Tuesday at Library West as part of the promo-tion. Library district representatives will be at the same location from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. until Friday and at Santa Fe College on Thursday. 
“A lot of students don’t know that our ser-
vices are available,” said library district assis-tant Eric Leppin. 
Students can sign up for a library card with 
either their Gator 1 Card or driver’s license. Any Florida resident can get a card for free. 
Emily Thompson, a 20-year-old UF  family, 
youth and community sciences junior, got her card Tuesday and said she plans on using it at the downtown library. 
“It’s a good resource to have to be able to go 
to some of the other libraries,” she said.
Barbara Hood, Smathers Libraries spokes-
woman, said it’s great that the district is trying to get students interested in local libraries. 
“There’s just so many resources available,” 
Hood said.Having fun isn’t

The UF Presidential Search Commit-
tee’s Subcommittee held a meeting Tues-
day to revise the campus brochure for po-tential presidential candidates.  
“This is a document that is a virtual 
walk-through campus,” said David Nor-ton, a member of UF’s Presidential Search Committee’s Subcommittee. 
Additions to the brochure will include 
the renovations of the Reitz Union build-ing and UF’s goal to be a top 10 public school university, he said. 
The subcommittee’s tasks include host-
ing the potential presidential candidates during the campus visit and interview process. The committee plans to have the bro-
chure completed by the end of Septem-ber. The search for the next UF president kicked off last Spring, UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said,  and there is much more of the search process that needs to con-
tinue. 
“There are a lot of intricate pieces that 
we have to be put together,”  Sikes said.

Students can heat up a frozen meal 
in a new microwave in the Reitz Union 
and then eat it on a solar-powered picnic 
table by the end of the month, courtesy 
of UF Student Senate.
The installation of three solar-pow-
ered picnic tables at the Hub and one microwave in the Reitz Union was 
unanimously approved Tuesday night.
Student Body Treasurer Elliot Gras-
so, one of the authors of the solar-pow-
ered picnic table resolution, said the idea 
came from last year’s election campaign 
platforms.“We saw it was something that stu-
dents really wanted,” he said. “We were going for something that offered more study space on campus and that was more cost effective.”
While the microwave was installed 
before the Fall semester began, the pic-nic tables will be installed by Sept. 22. The wheelchair-accessible tables, which can also be found at the J. Hillis Miller 
Health Science Center, the Rawlings 
Plaza and Diamond Village, have four power outlets each and two USB ports to charge electronics. Each table costs 
$9,000.
The single-dish microwave cost 
about $250 and is available for anyone 
to use. One other microwave is available for use in Turlington Hall.
“It’s definitely useful for students 
who want to bring lunch to school,” said Sen. Michael Christ of the microwave after the meeting, “but it’s no game 
changer.”Solar picnic tables, micro-

A couch one of the girls 
was resting on was shot mul-tiple times, according to the release.
On Tuesday afternoon, the 
house was empty. Two cars sat in the driveway about 50 me-ters back from County Road.
A small red tractor stood 
still in the grass. Near the front porch, a light pink cloth 
draped unevenly over a fold-
able pink child’s chair and a taller lawn chair, hoisting up a makeshift fort.
The garage light was left 
on.
Anne L. Hair, who lives 
down the road from the vic-tim’s house, said she didn’t 
know the family or hear the 
gunshots but was surprised it happened in her neighbor-hood.
“Not around here,” Hair 
said, lighting up a cigarette as she sat on her metal lawn 
chair.
It was not clear why the 
family was targeted, Butscher 
said. The shooter or shooters are still at large.
Detectives ask that any-
one with any information re-garding the shooting  should contact Detective Brett Rho-
denizer or send in info anony-
mously to Crime Stoppers at 352-372-7867. The Alachua County Gun Bounty Program is offering a potential $1,000

� THREE FLIGHTS HAVE BEEN 
GROUNDED DUE TO UNRULY RIDERS.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
NEW YORK — Squeezed into tighter spaces, 
airline passengers appear to be rebelling, taking 
their frustrations out on other fliers.
Three U.S. flights made unscheduled land-
ings in the past eight days after passengers got into fights over the ability to recline their seats. Disputes over a tiny bit of personal space might 
seem petty, but for passengers whose knees 
are already banging into tray tables, every inch counts.
“Seats are getting closer together,” said Sara 
Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, which represents 60,000 flight at-tendants at 19 airlines. “We have to de-escalate conflict all the time.”
Southwest Airlines and United Airlines both took away 1 inch from each row on certain jets to 
make room for six more seats. American Airlines 
is increasing the number of seats on its Boeing 737-800s from 150 to 160. Delta Airlines installed new, smaller toilets in its 737-900s, enabling it to squeeze in an extra four seats. JetBlue Airlines reduced the distance between coach seats by 1 inch.
But passengers aren’t just losing legroom; 
they’re losing elbow room.
Airlines sold 84 percent of their seats on do-
mestic flights so far this year, up from 81 percent five years ago and 74 percent a decade ago, ac-cording to the Bureau of Transportation Statis-tics. That means there are fewer and fewer emp-ty middle seats on which passengers can spread out.
The government doesn’t break out the reason 
for diversions, but industry experts say the vast 
majority occur because of bad weather or me-
chanical problems. And diversions remain a tiny portion of the 6 million annual flights in the U.S. — less than a quarter of a percentage point.Airline passengers rebel over

NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Thirty teens 
“overwhelmed” their minders at a ju-
venile detention center by simultane-ously breaking out of four dormitories and then crawling under a weak spot 
in a chain-link fence. By Tuesday eve-
ning, seven were still on the run.
Police caught up with some walk-
ing along roads or coming out of the woods. 
Some turned themselves in, includ-
ing one at the guard shack Tuesday evening. And some were swiftly re-
turned to the detention center by their 
own families for their own good.
“He broke loose, he was gone, 
but he’s back now,” said LaWanda Knowles, whose nephew joined the escape. “I just want to know that he’s here safely and he’s OK — I don’t want the police jumping on him, nobody beating on him or nothing.”
The teens — ages 14 to 19 — left their rooms at the Woodland Hills Youth Development Center at about 
11 p.m. Monday night and gathered in 
common areas. 
With just 16 unarmed adults to keep 
watch over 78 youths in 12 dormito-ries, the staff was “overwhelmed,” said Tennessee Department of Children’s Services spokesman Rob Johnson.
The groups of young men kicked 
out metal panels under the windows 
of each dorm to get into the yard, and 
then ran around for a while before some started slipping through the chain-link fence that encircles their campus.
“Staffing was lighter during the 
overnight hours, so presumably, they had planned for that,” Johnson said.
While juvenile records are sealed, 
police released the names and mug 
shots of the remaining eight fugitives, 
all of whom are 17 or 18 years old.
None are convicted killers, said 
Melvin Whitlow, the facility’s superin-tendent.30 teens escape from

� HURRICANE WILMA WAS THE LAST MAJOR 
STORM TO HIT THE STATE IN 2005.
JULIA LOPEZ
Alligator Contributing Writer
As Tropical Storm Dolly headed for the Gulf Coast of 
Mexico on Tuesday night, Florida avoided yet another 
major storm system.
Dennis Feltgen, a spokesman for the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration National Hurricane 
center in Miami. Hurricanes, in general, are a game of 
luck, he said. They are unpredictable and come fast.
The longest the state had previously gone without be-
ing hit by a major storm system was six years.
The last major hurricane to hit Florida was Wilma in 
2005, causing an estimated $29.1 billion in damage across the state and the Caribbean, according to the NOAA na-tional hurricane center website.
Allison Stendardo, a 21-year-old journalism senior, re-
called her brief encounter with Hurricane Wilma. 
“If I remember back in 2005, I was in seventh grade, 
and I lived at the time in South Florida,” she said. 
Stendardo’s parents stocked up on food and supplies. 
Even though her house in Miami had shutters on its win-dows, her parents boarded them up anyway.
 “I remember distinctly waking up the next day and 
seeing tree branches thrown all over the road and in my yard,” Stendardo said.
Feltgen said hurricanes aren’t the only storms that can 
cause damage. 
He said the Gulf of Mexico is like a giant boiling pot, 
and a storm can form at any moment.
“One thing we know for sure is that our luck will run 
out,” Feltgen said. “It’s just a matter of when and for how long.”
Hurricane season is from June 1 to Nov. 30, and ac-
cording to the NOAA, October is the most active month in Florida.
 Waters in the Atlantic start to cool down, but waters 
in the Gulf of Mexico are still warm. 
Even though Florida has not experienced hurricanes 
recently, individuals should not take these storms lightly. September is National Preparedness Month, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“The more knowledge people have about these storms 
and what they are capable of, the better off they will be,” Feltgen said.State has lucky

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
MILWAUKEE — President Ba-
rack Obama renewed his push for 
Congress to raise the minimum wage Monday in a buoyant accounting of the economy’s “revving” perfor-
mance, delivered on behalf of Demo-
crats opening their fall campaigns for the midterm congressional elections.
“America deserves a raise,” he 
told a union crowd in Milwaukee, vowing to keep a hard sell on Con-gress in much the same way he once courted his wife. “I just wore her down,” he said.
“By almost every measure, the 
American economy and American workers are better off than when I took ofﬁ  ce,” he said, rattling off a string of improving economic indica-tors, even while acknowledging not all people are beneﬁ  ting. “The en-gines,” he said, “are revving a little louder.” 
The emphasis on 
the minimum wage is designed to draw 
campaign contrasts 
with Republicans, many of whom 
maintain that an in-crease would hurt small businesses 
and slow down hiring. No one ex-pects Congress to act on it before the November elections.
Thirteen states raised their mini-
mum wages at the beginning of this year. Those states have added jobs at a faster pace than those that did not raise the wage, providing a counter-point to a Congressional Budget Of-ﬁ  ce report earlier this year that pro-jected that a higher minimum wage of $10.10 an hour could cost the na-
tion 500,000 jobs.
Until now, Obama and his White House aides had been reluctant to 
draw too much attention to positive economic trends, worried that some may prove illusory or that, even if 
they hold, many working Americans 
continue to live on the edge of pov-erty and take no comfort in the up-swing.
But now, the White House is en-
couraging Democrats to draw atten-tion to the recovery as they head into the November mid-term elections.
In an August memo to Congress 
Democrats, Obama’s top two eco-nomic advisers underscored the pos-itive news: more than 200,000 jobs created per month for six consecutive months, a six-year high in auto sales, second-quarter economic growth that exceeded expectations and an expanding manufacturing sector.
The unemployment rate stands at 
6.2 percent, dropping 1.1 points over the past year.

Republican staff’s 
China trip shows 
double standard
Two members of Florida’s congressional delegation, Sen. 
Marco Rubio and Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen have gained reputations during their time in ofﬁ  ce for speaking out 
forcefully and frequently against communism, particularly the Fidel Castro regime in Cuba.
In February, Rubio delivered a speech on the Senate ﬂ  oor, 
lambasting his colleague, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, for praising the Cuban health care and education systems.
“I would suggest to my colleagues, the next time they go to 
Cuba,” Rubio said, “ask to meet…with the dissidents and the human rights activists that are jailed and repressed and exiled.”
In 2013, Ros-Lehtinen called communism “an abysmal fail-
ure,” referring speciﬁ  cally to Communist China.  
The legislators’ criticism of communism is certainly war-
ranted. Freedom of speech and other rights are violated and re-pressed in the world’s remaining communist countries.
That said, it was surprising to read a report from the Tampa 
Bay Times that aides from the ofﬁ  ces of both Rubio and Ros-Lehtinen recently took an “all expenses paid” trip to China. Those expenses were paid directly by the communist Chinese government that both ofﬁ  cials have so strongly criticized.
Alex Conant, a spokesperson for Rubio’s ofﬁ  ce, explained the 
trip by arguing that China is too important to ignore.
“Senator Rubio has consistently condemned the totalitarian 
nature of the Chinese government, its record of systematic hu-man rights violations and its illegitimate territorial claims,” Co-nant wrote. “However, China is the most populous nation on earth, has the world’s second largest economy, has a signiﬁ  cant nuclear weapons arsenal and is increasingly an economic com-petitor of the United States.”
There’s no doubt that China plays a vital role in the world 
economy. Attempting to isolate ourselves from one of the 
world’s most important global powers is not an ideal strategy.
However, Rubio has previously harshly criticized those who 
visit communist countries, especially Cuba.
“U.S. law clearly bans tourism to Cuba by American citizens 
because it provides money to a cruel, repressive and murderous 
regime,” Rubio said in a statement after American music icons Jay-Z and Beyoncé visited in 2013. 
In a statement, Ros-Lehtinen offered a contrasting view to 
Rubio’s assertions about China’s economic importance.
“The world raves about the economic growth occurring in 
China but we all know that economic freedom cannot be a sub-stitute for liberty and democracy,” she said.
Rubio and Ros-Lehtinen do not deserve condemnation. 
However, their insistence on condemning others who interact with a communist regime is certainly hypocritical.
Both of these legislators continue to oppose efforts to nor-

this year?Nicki Minaj: different kind of feminist
When Nicki Minaj released the cover art for her new 
single, “Anaconda,” the world eagerly awaited the release of the accompanying music video. 
Many wondered just how far she would push the enve-
lope. If you have seen the video, you know she pushed it 
pretty far.
Minaj recently performed at the MTV Video Music 
Awards, and she has increasingly become a ﬁ  xture of Ameri-
can popular culture. The feminist statements she makes through her brand seem very intentional.
Chuck Creekmur, CEO of AllHipHop.com, addressed an 
open letter to Minaj shortly after the infamous cover art was revealed. 
Creekmur asked her to consider how young men who 
are “already conditioned to sexualize girls at a young age” would react to the image of her famous behind in a thong. 
It is clear that Creekmur and several other commenters 
take offense to Nicki Minaj’s agency and choice of sexual ex-pression.
But the issue is not with Minaj’s body. Even Creekmur 
states in his letter that “as a man,” he “can appreciate the vir-tues of (Nicki’s) perfect posterior.” 
The issue is the need for men to objectify Minaj’s body 
under any and all circumstances.
When women decide to own their bodies and are sexy 
because they want to be, the complaints and disapproval run rampant. 
But more often than not in American culture — especially 
in hip-hop culture — these same grievances are not heard when women engage in these same behaviors for the grati-ﬁ  cation of men.
Hip-hop music videos, especially those in which men are 
the main performers, frequently use the female body as an object to liven up the act. 
For example, Robin Thicke’s “Blurred Lines” peaked at 
No. 1 in fourteen countries, including the U.S. The explicit music video included completely topless women parading around for the enjoyment of Thicke and featured artists T.I. and Pharrell.
Nicki Minaj, a powerful and independent woman in her own right, has stormed the tradi-tionally male-dominated industry that is hip-hop. 
With her overtly sexual lyrics 
and provocative dance moves, she 
challenges all conventions that say 
that women should be appealing only for the enjoyment of the male gaze. 
Instead, Minaj is sexy for her-
self alone. Minaj’s independence and control over her own body is evident in the “Anaconda” music video. 
Drake, a well-known rapper, is used as a prop. He is pres-
ent merely as an object for Minaj to twerk on. 
The second he gets too handsy for her liking, she swats his 
hand away and leaves him to sit in an empty room and think about what he has done. 
She denies him access to her body because it is her right 
to do so.
This is what feminism is about — women being allowed 
to make their own decisions without anyone else staking some unearned claims to their bodies.
When Nicki Minaj shakes her butt on stage and does 
180-degree leg raises, she is sending the message that the only person who determines how sexual Nicki Minaj is al-lowed to be is herself.
Not concerned parents, not people who think that modes-
ty constitutes self-respect, not people who believe a woman should only be sexy in the bedroom for her partner — only herself. 
While some people may have qualms with the ways in 
which Minaj express herself, her extravagant and explicit ac-
tions drive home the point that no one can tell any woman 
what to do with her own body. 
These actions make Nicki Minaj very important to the 
feminist movement. Her ability to be a woman and her re-fusal to apologize for it make her one of the feminist move-ment’s major power players.

I’ve heard that you have seven seconds to 
make a first impression. The average per-son reads around 35 words in seven sec-
onds. Your first impression of this column has been created in 3, 2, 1 — now.
First impressions are everywhere. You are 
forming an impression of this column, fresh-men are creating first impressions of campus, and returning Gators are being reimpressed or perhaps unimpressed.
The newbie freshman class’ first impres-
sion of this school is now taking shape.
In the midst of deciphering cryptic bus 
schedules, learning lanyards are unacceptable 
and questioning whether there is a blood do-
nation bus within ten feet of them at all times (there is, trust me), freshmen are all pulling together bits and pieces of this campus that make a first impression.
By the second semester, remembered mo-
ments will morph into one overall impression. Hopefully, the ubiquity of Gator pride at UF hasn’t sent you into a psychedelic spin of or-
ange and blue.I also hope that the hordes of 
people assaulting you to join stu-
dent organizations on Turlington Plaza did not leave you in a state of panic. 
You also hopefully realized 
that, contrary to popular belief, there is extra credit in college. 
Maybe you’ve also discovered that teach-
ing assistants are not all that inept and that you can follow HUM2305’s path to enlighten-ment to find out “What is the Good Life?”
A freshman’s first impression of UF prob-
ably looks different than my continually de-
veloping impression. 
A freshman may think, “Wendy’s in the 
Reitz Union? Cool!” or “Norman Tunnel is so 
convenient for walking to class.”
In contrast, I want to know what happened 
to Burger King and its fabulous dollar menu ice cream and why the bike lane in Norman Tunnel, which I long used as a shortcut to class, no longer exists.
The blue trees in Turlington look like they have not been repainted since the senior Bush’s administra-tion, and finding a place to lock my bike at the Reitz is still mi-raculously like securing a DVD 
at Redbox the day it’s released 
— nearly impossible.
There’s a lot of good change, too. The new 
dorms and the expansion of the Warrington College of Business Administration will beau-tify two corners of campus, and The Swamp pulled out all the stops for the first game day, even if it was more of a rain day.
Some things don’t change at all. Gainesville 
is still oppressively hot, I still get lost, and I can still smell Chick-fil-A from a mile away.
To freshmen and transfers: Get out there, 
and get familiar with this school. 
Let it make a first impression on you, and 
make a few first impressions on other people.
Introduce yourself to your professors, and 
make small talk with your classmates. 
You will thank me when you need a letter 
of recommendation from a professor or when you take a mental health day and need that day’s lecture notes.
Whether you are impressed with or under-
whelmed by your first week of experiences, don’t let your first impression become perma-
nent just yet.
First impressions aren’t everything. My 
first impression of UF was wrong. 
I used to be intimidated by the size of the 
campus and the number of students, but now 
those are just parts of my everyday life.
A good first impression and a bad first im-
pression can almost always be reversed.
Take in the orange and blue, embrace the 
never-ending search for a parking spot, and be pleasantly surprised by how quickly Chick-fil-A employees can prepare your No. 1 with fruit punch and no pickle.
Be impressed or reimpressed by this cam-
pus, and if you can, give it more than just seven seconds.

The First Amendment to 
the U.S. Constitution guarantees every Ameri-
can freedom of religion. 
Unfortunately, some Amer-
ican organizations have twisted the Consti-tution’s words and are trying to convince us that we should instead embrace freedom “from” religion. 
This anti-religious movement is fre-
quently manifested in American schools, with the most recent attack in the Orange County Public School District, located in central Florida. 
After receiving a complaint about 
prayers being performed at high school football games from the Wisconsin-based Freedom From Religion Foundation, OCPS issued a memorandum with some new rules: one being that volunteer chaplains for football teams can no longer hold the ti-tle of chaplain. They must now be referred to as “life coaches.”
Additionally, now parents, coaches, 
chaplains and other school staff are not al-lowed to participate in or lead prayer be-fore or after football games, even if prayer before the game has been a long standing tradition for many OCPS schools, including my alma mater, Apopka High School. 
The memorandum states that “having a 
team chaplain is not permitted as it is an 
unconstitutional endorsement of religion 
in the same manner as a school employee 
participating in prayer with students.” 
Additionally, this ruling was further 
endorsed by Gov. Rick Scott in 2012 when 
he signed into law a bill that doesn’t allow adults to be involved with students leading prayer or other “inspirational messages” at student rallies and other school-sponsored events. 
Although I do not consider myself a re-
ligious person, I know that religion does 
give people a sense of hope and stability 
in trying or stressful times, and for a lot of these high school football players, it is used as a tool to calm their anxiety and get them focused on the game. 
Now, because an organization from 
Wisconsin has complained about some-thing happening in Florida, the players lose this right. Players can still lead their own 
prayers with their fellow teammates, but 
now, even the coaches cannot be involved — the ones who train and mentor these kids for months upon months, some for years and years.
Players look up to their 
coaches, but right before the game, when they need them the most, they have to be silent and distant. 
What these people from Wisconsin fail 
to recognize because they don’t understand the city of Apopka — given that they are over 1,300 miles away — is that prayer and religion is a part of the culture in Apopka. And OCPS, rather than standing up to the 
Freedom From Religion Foundation, just 
gave in to their demands instead of trying to find common ground. 
Let’s assume for a second that chaplains 
and coaches leading a Christian prayer is, in fact, unconstitutional. Is the appropri-ate reaction to such a judgment to simply ban acts of religion on the football field to satisfy the wishes of an organization from 
another state? 
What OCPS should have done instead 
is inform people that if some people on the 
team don’t happen to be Christians, and they also want to hold a prayer before the game that comports with their own reli-gion, that is OK and encouraged. 
By stripping all religion from our public 
schools and other institutions, we are doing 
our students a disservice by not exposing 
them to diversity. 
The lack of diversity in American life is 
a common complaint, but the call for diver-
sity is often accompanied by an insistence on banning and regulating everything, es-pecially religion. 
Rather than attempting to shut out reli-
gion, we should embrace religious diversi-ty and allow others to learn from each other and develop a broader, more nuanced view of the world. 
What we are teaching our students now 
is that if you believe in something, you must keep it locked up inside of you and not share it with others. 
I would prefer to live in a country where 
we celebrate our differences and not where we shun others for what they believe.

In recent days and weeks, 
a number of female ce-lebrities have had their 
phones hacked, which has resulted in private nude 
pictures of them being plastered far and 
wide across the Internet. 
Targets of these illegal and invasive 
hackings include Jennifer Lawrence, 
Kate Upton and Mary Elizabeth Win-stead. Almost as soon as the photographs 
were posted, the photos and related gos-
sip spread alarmingly quickly online. 
Popular opinion regarding these phone 
hackings, which regards the invasion of these celebrities’ privacy as a “scandal,” 
is frankly disgraceful. 
The intentional, malicious hacking 
of any person’s phone and distribution 
of their private content is a crime and a form of sexual harassment, not a scan-dal or a juicy piece of shocking celebrity gossip. 
The celebrities in these nude pho-
tos did not bring this upon themselves. When gossip websites and TV shows re-fer to these leaks as part of a “scandal,” it implies that these women consensu-ally shared their photos on the Internet, which is clearly false. 
It implies that the victims of these ac-
tions have done something distasteful and should apologize for their own ac-
tions as celebrities have done for leaked 
nude photos in the past. But no matter what your opinion is on individuals tak-ing and sharing nude photographs, the appearance of these photos on the Inter-net is not the fault of the women who had their privacy and sexual activity violated. 
In modern America’s rape culture, 
which has infected the way we see is-sues of assault and abuse, there is a ter-rifying expectation that women, and people in general, are responsible for protecting themselves from abuse. 
The focus has largely shifted away 
from creating pressure not to abuse oth-ers in the first place. 
Viewing invasion of sexual privacy 
in this backward manner, women who take nude photographs are supposedly opening themselves up to be exploited. This is a misogynistic and distasteful way to view this harassment. Victims are never to blame for the crimes committed against 
them. 
The celebrities in these photographs 
are entitled to engage in any kind of con-sensual sexual activity they choose, as is any person. This goes for the celebrities victimized now and any individual who has had his or her private photos leaked in the past.
The hacker who violated the privacy 
of these celebrities publicized an inti-mate activity between these women and their significant others. These personal and private moments were shamefully twisted into a public gossip spectacle. 
Anyone who seeks out, views or 
shares these photos is complicit in the crime against these women by violating their privacy. Whether people search for 
these photos in order to humiliate and 
ridicule, or because they think these women are attractive, they are perpetu-ating the victimization of these innocent women. 
It is not acceptable to disregard a 
woman’s privacy because you think she’s sexy. Just as with instances of cat-calling or street harassment, women’s 
bodies are not items for public owner-
ship, and objectifying them even with supposedly “positive” connotations is not OK. 
I am sorry for the pain and humilia-
tion being experienced by the female ce-lebrities who have had their privacy vi-olated. In today’s age of technology, the involuntary disclosure and publicizing 
of sexual activity is becoming increas-
ingly common, especially with young, mostly college-age women. As a female college student, I can only hope that these disgusting crimes will make more people realize that stealing and sharing the personal photographs of others is an abhorrent and unacceptable crime. These invasions of privacy amount to a 
form of sexual harassment and should 
be treated as such.

Country duo Florida Geor-
gia Line will fittingly headline 
the Tailgate event to kick off Florida-Georgia football game weekend.
The Oct. 31 festival held at 
the Shipyards in Jacksonville will take place two weeks after the band plans to release its sec-ond album.
“With their name and the 
play on words, it was a no-brainer (to decide on this),” said Billy Catlin, president of 
Orange Peel Entertainment, 
which partnered with Gator Bowl Sports and national pro-moter AEG Live to bring Flori-da Georgia Line to Tailgate.
Catlin said the event is in-
spired by large tailgate parties that he’s hosted since 1999 at his home. He said a similar 
event to Tailgate was hosted last year, which featured Corey 
Smith and Sister Hazel.
Along with Florida Georgia 
Line, other musical acts that will appear at Tailgate include Cole Swindell, The Cadillac Three, Clare Dunn, John King and Michael Ray.
The event will feature food 
trucks and tailgating activities. There will be a VIP section for those 21 and older.
“It’s more festival-esque,” 
Catlin said. “We’re going to have plenty of activities for ev-eryone.”
Nolan Ehinger, a 20-year-
old UF mechanical engineering 
junior, hasn’t missed a Florida-
Georgia game yet.
“It’s always a lot of fun,” 
Ehinger said. “I think having Florida Georgia Line there will make it better.”

Volunteer recruitment for Gainesville’s 
33rd Downtown Festival and Art Show has 
officially begun.
The annual event is scheduled for the 
weekend of Nov. 8.
The festival is in need of volunteers in 
two different areas: the Children’s Imagina-tion Station and the Junior Firefighting Chal-lenge, said Linda Piper, event coordinator for the City of Gainesville Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs Department.
The Children’s Imagination Station is a 
free, hands-on art activity for kids to chan-nel their creativity using various mediums, Piper said.
“There’s everything from hat making 
and mask making, beadwork where you can make necklaces and bracelets, even puppet 
making,” Piper said.
At the Junior Firefighting Challenge, pre-
sented by the City of Gainesville Fire Rescue team, children will earn their badges and be-
come honorary firefighters.
Positions working alongside the artists 
and helping with event coordination have already been filled, and the other positions will likely be taken within the next two weeks.
Shifts run for four hours and are unpaid, 
but Piper said volunteers will be given a free commemorative T-shirt.
Drew Daehne, a 21-year-old UF English 
junior, said he’d be interested in volunteer-ing.
“Volunteering is an opportunity for per-
sonal and community growth and a chance for a free T-shirt,” Daehne said. “It’s defi-nitely important.”Downtown Festival and Art Show actively seeking volunteers
� APPLE SAID IT WAS HACKED.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
LOS ANGELES — Apple Inc. said Tues-
day that hackers obtained nude photos of 
Jennifer Lawrence and other female celebri-ties by pilfering images from individual ac-counts rather than through a broader attack 
on the company’s services.
Meanwhile, numerous sharing sites re-
moved images of the stars, apparently in 
response to copyright complaints.
However, experts said there is no way 
to fully scrub the photos from the Internet, and the images could keep popping up in the future, forcing celebrities to file repeat-ed complaints as they play a cyber-version 
of the arcade game “whack-a-mole.”
Apple Inc. said its engineers have deter-
mined that hackers breached individual ac-
counts and didn’t obtain general access to a pair of the company’s services — iCloud and Find my iPhone. The tech giant said it conducted 40 hours of investigation.
Law enforcement inquiries likely will 
take days or weeks to complete.
The FBI offered no details on its efforts to identify people responsible for stealing the images that were posted on image-sharing site Imgur.com, the social networking sites Reddit and Twitter and other websites. But the agency said Monday it was aware of the breach and addressing the matter.
Lawrence, an Oscar winner for her role 
in “Silver Linings Playbook,” contacted au-
thorities after the images of her began ap-
pearing Sunday.
By Tuesday, a Reddit thread that had 
been compiling links to images of nude photos of Lawrence and other celebrities had been disabled due to a copyright claim, the website said.
Representatives of Twitter, Reddit and 
Imgur did not respond to messages seeking comment.
Mark Rasch, a former federal prosecutor 
who specialized in computer crimes, said investigators will focus on who’s responsi-ble for the theft of the photos, the tools they used and the idiosyncrasies of how they program.
“There is a digital trail,” Rasch said. 
“What you hope for (is) the people aren’t very good at what they do, that they screw 
up, that they (upset) other hackers. Or that 
they leave a trail.”Stars’ nude pictures leaked

NAPLES — Florida Gov. Rick Scott 
on Tuesday called Islamic State militants 
“evil” and demanded that President Barack Obama destroy them after a video surfaced purporting to show the beheading of free-
lance journalist Steven Sotloff who had ties 
to the state.
Scott launched a two-week re-election 
bus tour on Labor Day and planned on Tuesday to hold his second political rally of the day at a hardware store. But during the stop, Scott said he was canceling the event, and instead, asked supporters to give a mo-ment of silence to Sotloff.
The Republican governor then criticized 
Obama for not having a “strategy” to re-spond to the militants that he called “im-moral” and “barbarians.”
“He’s got to start taking this seriously, 
we have got to destroy this evil,” Scott said.
Sotloff’s mother lives in the Miami area, 
and he attended the University of Central Florida from 2002 to 2004.
Sotloff’s mother released a video state-
ment last week begging the militants to re-lease her son. He had been kidnapped more than a year ago while working as a freelance reporter covering the Syrian conflict.
UCF President John Hitt said Tuesday that university officials “join millions of people around the world who are outraged at this despicable and unjustifiable act.”
Other Florida leaders on Tuesday also 
reacted to the news about Sotloff.
U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, 
D-Fla., said in a state-
ment that the U.S. must go after the militants “right away because the U.S. is the only one that can put together a coali-tion to stop this group 
that’s intent on barbaric 
cruelty.” He also said 
he is filing legislation to give Obama clear authority to carry out airstrikes against the militants.
U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., called 
Sotloff a “man of enormous courage and decency.”
“As Steven was a native of Florida, my 
office has been in contact with his family throughout their ordeal, and today my heart goes out to all who loved him as they make the painful transition from fear to grief,” Ru-bio said in a statement.
Rubio added that the Islamic State mili-
tants represented “a threat to the American 
people, our allies, and the principles of free-
dom and human rights that we cherish.”FL reporter beheaded by ISISStAtE

EXCHANGE STUDENTS.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
BUFFALO, N.Y. — College 
students from West Africa may 
be subject to extra health checks when they arrive to study in the U.S. as administrators try to in-
sulate campuses from the worst 
Ebola outbreak in history.
With the virus continuing to 
kill in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Le-one and Nigeria, the arrival of students from those countries has U.S. authorities on alert but cau-tioning against alarm.
“I can see why there would 
be concern; there’s no vaccine for it,” said Fatima Nor, an 18-year-old freshman at the University at Buffalo, where about 25 students from Nigeria are enrolled for Fall. “As long as everyone keeps their 
personal space, it should be OK.”
While the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention have is-
sued no speciﬁ  c recommendations for colleges, some state health departments, including in South Carolina and North Dakota, have spelled out for administrators what symptoms to look for and how to react.
Elsewhere, universities are 
drafting their own precaution-ary plans against the often-fatal hemorrhagic fever, which causes weakness, vomiting, diarrhea, in-ternal bleeding, and sometimes, bleeding from the nose and ears.
“I don’t see this as a huge threat 
on college campuses,” said Dr. Susan Even, student health direc-tor at the University of Missouri-Columbia and a member of the ACHA, “but it makes sense when you’re communicating with stu-dents ... to ask a question or two.”

UF has launched a rebranding campaign to move the university 
closer toward its preeminence goal of being a top 10 school. 
UF joined forces with branding agency 160over90 to kickstart its 
new re-energized promotional campaign, “For the Gator Good.”
The more than $700,000 privately funded campaign focuses on 
UF’s global impact. 
The rebranding is a progression of the UF Rising campaign, UF 
spokeswoman Janine Sikes said. 
“It’s important that we talk about the great things that happen 
at the University of Florida as we work to become a top 10 pub-
lic research university, which is one of our major goals going for-ward,” she said. 
“Two years ago, the state of Florida designated the University 
of Florida as the state’s most preeminent university.”
The “For the Gator Good” rebranding launched on Saturday 
and is airing on select TV spots. The campaign will run over a span of two to three years, according to a UF press release. 
The campaign will include stories of UF’s research beneﬁ  ciaries, 
including that of a 4-year-old boy named Aaron who underwent treatment at the UF Proton Therapy Institute in Jacksonville while battling a rare bone cancer. 
Sikes said it is the ﬁ  rst time that a single agency has helped with 
the rebranding of all three UF organizations: UAA, the UF Founda-
tion and UF. 
“For the Gator Good” is a fresh take on The Gator Nation cam-
paign, which was launched nearly 10 years ago. 
The new campaign shows Gators’ ambitions to make a differ-
ence that’s not only felt on campus but also felt around the world.
Maggie Slomiany, director of client services at 160over90, said 
the UF projects all have the same strategic foundations and the 
same themes with their own unique personalities. 
160over90’s rebranding of UAA includes a revamped style 
guide and toolkit that allows UAA to independently produce ma-terials that work in tandem with the overall themes of the project.
Nicole Yucht, UF director of marketing for university relations, 
said “For the Greater Good” campaign will show UF’s positive reach in issues such as poverty, cancer and hunger and hopefully create more support for its research. 
“We know we can’t do it alone, so we are imploring others to 
join in this ﬁ  ght to help us ﬁ  nd solutions to these big issues,” she said.UF rebrands itself to

WOULD HAVE ALTERED PLAYCALL.

Although Florida fans 
were expecting to get its ﬁ  rst 
look at Kurt Roper’s new of-
fense, they would have to 
wait another week to do so as the season opener versus Idaho was suspended Satur-
day due to unsafe weather in 
the area.
Kickoff time was delayed 
two hours and 48 minutes, and the game kicked off at 
9:50 p.m. 
Valdez Showers returned 
the opening kick for 64 yards 
down to the Idaho 14 yard 
line before both teams were 
escorted off the ﬁ  eld after more lightning was reported in the area.
The game was suspend-
ed shortly thereafter due to weather as well as unsafe ﬁ  eld conditions. 
Roper said that the ﬁ  eld conditions were a bit of a concern in terms of play-calling if the game were to be 
played.
“You just wondered how 
hard it was going to be to ex-
change the football, whether 
it was between the quarter-
back and center, center and running backs,” Roper said. “And you start wondering how wet it is when you’re 
going to throw it. 
“One of the advantages 
offenses get when it’s re-
ally wet is you know where 
you’re going and those DBs 
don’t.”
The long delay didn’t 
have too much of an effect on quarterback Jeff Driskel 
while he waited in the locker 
room for the game to start.
“He’s a real even-keeled 
guy,” Roper said. 
“He handles things re-
ally well. And that’s what I like about him; he doesn’t ride the wave of emotions like I like to talk about quar-terbacks doing. He’s pretty Roper’s first game cut short, offense fails to see field

Kurt Roper has a lot of stories to tell.His weekly media availabilities are ﬁ  lled 
with anecdotes about his coaching experi-
ences, growing up as a coach’s son and rais-
ing his six-year-old daughter Reese — who was probably more upset than Roper about Florida’s season opener against Idaho be-
ing suspended.
“It got pretty late — she is 6 — and so 
my wife said ‘hey at some point she’s got 
to go home,’” Roper said Tuesday. “So my mother in law started to take her and my 
son home, and my daughter said, ‘I got all 
dressed’ — she had her ﬁ  ngernails painted, toenails painted orange and blue — ‘I got all dressed up for this. I’m just so disap-
pointed.’”
But there’s one story that fans are wait-
ing to hear from the ﬁ  rst-year UF offensive 
coordinator — the story of Florida’s suc-cessful offense.
And while that story won’t be told un-
til Florida is able to play more than just its opening kickoff (cue Valdez Showers pun here), one thing is certain about Roper’s of-fense: The pieces are there.
Florida’s of-
fense this season has arguably as much depth at its skill positions as 
the 2008 team — a 
group that con-tains names such 
as Percy Harvin, Louis Murphy and Chris 
Rainey.
The wide receiver position is brimming 
with talent from redshirt seniors Quinton 
Dunbar and Andre Debose to true fresh-man C.J. Worton. 
Roper plans to rotate at least six receiv-
ers around throughout the three wide re-ceiver positions this season.
The Gators also have a formidable pass-
catching option at tight end in Virginia 
transfer Jake McGee. 
The redshirt senior caught 43 passes in 
his ﬁ  nal year with the Hokies — three more 
than any of UF’s returning receivers from 2013.Offense debut worth the wait

Kurt Roper is a football lifer.Because his father, Bobby Roper, 
coached at the collegiate level while he 
was growing up, Kurt grew up on foot-
ball ﬁ  elds across the country until he was old enough to play on them. 
After his play-
ing career ended at Rice University in 1994, he took 
to the sidelines, grabbed a clipboard and has been following in  his father’s 
footsteps ever since.
But despite the amount of time he 
has spent around the sport, Roper has 
never seen a sight quite like Saturday 
night’s “false start” in the Swamp.
“I’m 42 years old and been around 
college football my whole career . . . 
since I was born,” Roper said Tuesday. “And that’s the ﬁ  rst (game) I’ve ever 
been around that wasn’t played. So, no. 
It was a ﬁ  rst.”After a two-hour, 48-minute weath-
er delay, the Gators took the ﬁ  eld for 
the opening kickoff only to be told im-
mediately following the play that they had to return to the locker room.
Jake McGee, who transferred during 
the offseason from Virginia, was sup-
posed to make his Florida debut and 
show the fans his potential in Roper’s spread offense. 
However, what was scheduled to 
be a test run for McGee and the new system turned into the redshirt senior’s most deﬂ  ating affair.
“It’s one of the weirdest feelings 
I think I’ve ever had with football,” 
said the 6-foot-6, 245-pound tight end. 
“You put a whole week of game prep in, do the whole pre-game, do really everything and then the game doesn’t 
happen. It sort of an empty feeling, I 
guess.”

For the first time in 27 years, 
the Florida men’s golf team will 
have a different leader, as J.C. Deacon is taking over as head coach for Buddy Alexander. 
Deacon served as an assis-
tant coach at his alma mater — the University of Nevada, Las Vegas — for four years before accepting the head coaching position with the Gators.
The new coach will have 
big shoes to fill, as Alexander guided Florida to two national 
titles and eight Southeastern 
Conference titles during his tenure. 
But Deacon didn’t come to 
UF to replace Alexander, and he knows that no one can com-pletely follow in the footsteps of someone who brought as much success to Florida as Al-
exander did. 
“I’m not going to replace 
Buddy Alexander,” Deacon 
said. “No one in the world can replace Buddy Alexander, legend, done an incredible job, won two national cham-pionships. He’s one of the best coaches that’s ever been in col-
lege golf.”
What Deacon does bring 
is someone who is young and 
someone who has a fiery per-sonality. 
“I’m going to bring a lot of 
energy to the table, I’m going to demand hard work,” the 31-year-old coach said. “Our guys 
are already doing a great job 
living up to my expectations and we’re going to try and work harder than everyone in the country.”
Deacon inherits a team 
which returns eight players from last year’s squad that have playing experience.Leading the team is senior 
J.D. Tomlinson, who paced Florida last year with a 72.55 stroke average. Even though he was arguably the best player on last year’s team, Tomlinson 
made it a point to get better in 
the offseason.
“I made a couple of swing 
changes, which took the whole summer, which I’m really happy about,” Tomlinson said. “I played some tournaments 
around the country and I just 
really worked on my game and kind of put my head down and made some changes.”
Tomlinson will be counted 
on to continue his strong play heading into this season along with fellow senior Eric Banks, who finished with a 73.50 
stroke average — good enough 
for second on the team.
Sophomore Ryan Orr 
played in every tournament last season, and finished first on the team with two eagles and finished second with 75 birdies in his freshman year.
“Coming in my goal was to 
just qualify for some tourna-ments, and to be able to play 
in all of them was awesome 
and it gave me a lot of expe-
rience,” Orr said. “Getting to play against the best players in the country was a really good experience.”
Florida didn’t qualify for 
the NCAA Golf Champion-ships last year. The last time that happened was in 2000. The 
next year, the program won its second national title under Al-
exander. 
UF will be using the four 
tournaments in the fall season as a springboard to get back to the NCAAs in the spring. 
Deacon says the team has been 
putting in the effort to get back to the Golf Championships.“The whole point of why 
we’re doing this and putting in all of this time and hard work is to get to nationals and com-pete at the highest level,” Dea-con said. “We got to find a way 
to get back there, but the way 
we’re going to do that is do all the little things.”

After an impressive start to her colle-
giate career, freshman Rhamat Alhassan 
ended the weekend on a high note as she 
was named the Southeastern Conference 
Freshman of the Week on Tuesday.
The freshman, who started in two of 
three matches over the weekend against 
Idaho and Oklahoma, had playing time in 
all three of Florida’s opening matches but saw big numbers in her second collegiate match ever against Idaho.
Alhassan started her first collegiate 
match against Idaho and made 13 kills on 16 attempts, with no errors and three blocks. In all, she completed the weekend with 23 kills on 35 attempts and only two 
errors in three games.
She sits in first in the SEC with a .600 hit-
ting efficiency and is second in the league 
among freshmen with 1.3 blocks per set.
The freshman’s performance was the 
first time a true freshman middle blocker for Florida recorded a hitting efficiency of at least .800 in a match since Cassandra Anderson (.909) in the 2008 NCAA Tour-nament.
“She went from zero to 60 is what she’s 
done,” coach Mary Wise said. “…She’s 6’4” and jumping 36 inches. There aren’t a lot of players in the college game, not women, that are at that point.”SEC honors

Brown will lead a three-headed attack in the back-

Showers’ kickoff return against Idaho would have 
been a perfect prelude to the Roper-led offense that took the field after it.
The 64-yard return brought the excitement that 
Roper hopes to bring out of a Florida offense that has been anything but that for the last three seasons.
Mother Nature had other plans, though, and the 
closest Roper’s group got to a play was huddling on the field before play was suspended for a final time.
But even though Florida’s spread offense debut has 
been pushed back to Saturday’s game against Eastern 
Michigan, it will be worth the wait.
elsewhere and return later, the 
players had no choice but to wait in the locker room.
And because the storm had the 
potential to end at anytime, Flori-
da’s athletes stayed alert and stud-
ied the gameplan laid out for them earlier in the week. If the Gators were to be called upon to take the field once again, they did not want to be caught unprepared and unfo-
cused when facing the Vandals.
“We was still getting ready, like 
game ready,” safety Jabari Gorman 
said. “A lot of guys just up getting 
their legs warmed, just things to 
keep the body warm. I mean, we was ready.”
Still, having to endure a dragged 
out delay in a chilled locker room in soaking uniforms and pads caused some players to become a little an-tsier than others.
Some, like kicker Frankie Velez 
and defensive tackle Joey Ivie, tweeted out their growing hunger.
“(There’s) about a hundred guys 
in the locker room,” Jeff Driskel 
said. “Food goes quick.”
Some, like Dante Fowler, Jr., ex-pressed more anger than anything.
“Never felt this rage before,” 
Fowler tweeted after learning the 
game was suspended.
No matter what the Gators felt 
Saturday night sitting in that locker 
room, each one is relaying the same message now: Florida is more than 
ready to begin its most anticipated 
football season in recent history.
UF is scheduled to kickoff 2014 
against Eastern Michigan on Satur-
day at 4 p.m. 
Gorman said having been teased 
this weekend has just hyped him 
up and his entire team to face off against the Eagles.
“We’re more determined,” said 
the team captain. “We’re more hungry to go out there and show our fans and our family that we 
ready to play for this season.”
And Gorman, who said earlier 
this fall camp that he likes to play 
safety because it allows him to hit more people, is now itching more 
than ever to strap on a helmet and 
deliver some punishing blows on Florida Field.
“Oh I wish tomorrow was Sat-
urday. You know? We all ready. That’s all we can think of is Satur-day.”WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

steady.”  
Added Driskel: “I think it’s good 
that guys were let down. We just 
have a bunch of competitors on the 
team that just want to get out and start the year off right.”
Driskel, fully recovered from a 
season-ending broken right fibula during last year’s Tennessee game, has appeared more comfortable and confident in Roper’s new offensive scheme in spring practice and the 
offseason. 
Through the entirety of fall 
camp, he didn’t throw a single in-
terception. 
For Driskel to have a successful 
season, Roper expects a high com-pletion percentage.
“When I first started putting goals together — Coach Cut (David Cutcliffe from Duke) started teach-ing me to put goals together — at the end of the game, 60 percent was 
our goal,” the first-year UF offen-
sive coordinator said. 
“Really, it’s higher now because 
of all the things that happen behind 
the line of scrimmage and things 
like that.”
Like a multitude of offenses 
throughout the Southeastern Con-ference, Florida’s up-tempo scheme 
will allow the offense to run a high 
number of plays in a single game. 
“We’ve never just put a number 
on it and said, ‘here is exactly how 
many plays we want to run,’” Rop-
er said. 
“If you get up around the 80 
range, you are running a lot of plays. If you get above 75, you’ve 
had pretty good tempo.”With that high number of plays, 
Roper needs consistent production 
from his offensive line.
“I think real games teach you a 
lot,” Roper said. “We have a chance to be really good up front. We’re starting to build some depth mov-ing along.”
Florida’s next chance to get out 
on the field comes Saturday against Eastern Michigan, which hails from the Mid-American conference. 
Roper said the Eagles’ defense 
presents some different challenges than Idaho’s unit from last week.
“They play more with a 3-down 
front than a 4-down front,” he said. 
“I think they don’t mind playing a 
little bit more man coverage than what Idaho had shown in the past. And so they’ve got the ability to be aggressive, but those are the main 
changes.”roPer , from page 1316, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 2014

How fast is too fast for an of-
fense? Texas A&M ran 99 plays in 
its season opener against South 
Carolina, and Baylor ran 97 in its 
debut against Southern Method-ist. 
Offensive coordinator Kurt 
Roper’s former employer, Duke, ran 86 plays Saturday and East-ern Michigan, UF’s next oppo-nent, ran 86.
As the hype continues around 
Roper’s up-tempo system, just how fast the Gators will go is a key topic of discussion.
But one down in particular 
makes the difference, said Roper.
“It all really is determined by 
how successful you have been on third downs in a lot of instances,” he said.
Of the 10 teams which ran the 
most plays in college football’s ﬁ  rst week, eight of them con-verted on 10 or more third down 
attempts.
Another type of efﬁ  ciency 
Roper will need from his offense 
is from quarterback Jeff Driskel. 
Roper said during his career, 
the benchmark has risen for how accurate a quarterback needs to be in his offense during a game. 
A 60-percent completion rate won’t cut it anymore, and in Rop-er’s best season, quarterback Sean 
Renfree completed 68 percent of 
his passes for Duke in 2009, lead-ing the Blue Devils to the ninth best passing attack nationally in yards per game.
Jeff Driskel is near that mark 
already. 
Driskel threw at a 63.7 per-
cent clip in his only full season as 
Florida’s starter in 2012. 
Before being sidelined against 
Tennessee in 2013 with a broken 
ﬁ  bula, he had a 68.9 completion percentage.
But Driskel is not one to be 
caught up in numbers.
“When you start to think 
about numbers, you start to just 
take easy things to get the num-
bers up,” Driskel said. 
“But if you do take what the 
defense gives you, at the end of the day you’ll be at around 65-70 
percent. That’s kind of a number 
you want to be at the end of the year.”
McGee has strange Satur-
day: For the ﬁ  rst time since 2010, tight end Jake McGee wasn’t on the sideline of a Virginia Cava-liers football game as UVA fell to UCLA in a hard-fought 28-20 
contest. 
McGee was sitting in a hotel room, getting ready to play for 
his new team for the ﬁ  rst time,  a 
game that never ended up hap-
pening thanks to lightning and the condition of Florida Field.
“I watched as much as I could 
in the hotel,” McGee said. “It was 
tough to watch, a lot of weird 
feelings but I thought the guys played hard.”
Gorman ready for opener: De-
fensive back Jabari Gorman can’t think of anything else but Sat-urday’s opener against Eastern Michigan. 
He, like the rest of Florida’s 
team is chomping at the bit to get on the ﬁ  eld after having lightning ruin the game against Idaho. 
As Florida prepares for Satur-
day’s game against Eastern Mich-igan, they ready themselves for a run-happy unit, content to pound the rock with power more than they are to play pitch and catch 
all over the ﬁ  eld.
Gorman isn’t worried though.
“They’re a power team, noth-
ing tricky about their formations 
and stuff like that,” Gorman 
said. 
“They just run the power in 
different formations and with a good defensive line as we got 
then we look like we’ll have a 
great chance.”Roper looking for third-down efﬁ  ciency
