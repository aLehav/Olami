As chants, fists and cigar smoke filled the air, Supervi-
sor of Elections Amanda Griffin announced the results of 
the fall Student Government elections, leading to an erup-tion of cheers from the Unite Party.Unite Party candidates won 48 of the 50 Student Senate 
seats up for election during this cycle, while  the Progress 
Party won one seat and independent candidate Michael Morales snagged the other.
Unite Party spokesman Micah Lewis said he was very 
proud of all of his party’s candidates. 
“We’re looking forward to the upcoming year so we 
can accomplish the platform points that we promised the students,” Lewis said.Jose Soto, the sole Progress Party winner, who will rep-
resent graduate and family housing, said that even with one seat his party will make a difference on campus.
“Even though we got one seat, our platform is going to 
be represented,” he said.
Dave Schneider, president of the Progress Party, said 
he was content with his party’s sole victor. 
“I feel the graduates and family housing are going to 
have an excellent representative for the next year,” he 
said.
Michael Morales, who ran independently and will rep-
resent the Lakeside area, said he plans to switch his affili-
ation to the Student Alliance party after he assumes his 
seat. 
“Third time’s the charm,” he said. “Right now I am 
so overwhelmed with joy. I’ve got the worst farmer’s tan 
ever, but it’s worth it.”
Kevin Kleponis, Student Alliance party Senate leader, 
said he knew the Unite Party would sweep the available seats. 
The Student Alliance party did not participate in the 
elections after submitting the wrong candidate list to the 
supervisor of elections for approval. 
Instead, some of the candidates up for positions who 
interviewed with the Student Alliance Party decided to 
run independently and planned to switch affiliations if elected. 
“The students of the university deserve the govern-
ment they elect,” Kleponis said.

LIVINGSTON, Mont. (AP)  — A judge running for the 
state Supreme Court has given a man accused of assaulting a 
woman a sentence with an unusual twist.
District Court Judge Nels Swandal gave Daniel Martz a 
10-year suspended sentence on Monday for a May 2009 attack in which Martz allegedly choked and hit a woman, and then tried to have her change her story.
Swandal also ordered Martz to report to jail each Dec. 15 
through Jan. 1 for the next five years, according to the Livings-ton Enterprise. Swandal said incarcerating Martz around the holidays will keep him out of trouble.

The names, addresses and Social Secu-
rity numbers of 239 former students were 
compromised from 2003 until last month, according to a release sent out by the uni-
versity Tuesday.
The students’ personal information was 
available on a Web-accessible archive cre-
ated by a faculty member in 2003, which contained information for a computer sci-
ence class.According to the release, the website 
was removed immediately after it was dis-
covered last month on a server housed in the Department of 
Computer and Information Science and Engineering at the 
university.
Letters were mailed to most of the in-
volved individuals listed in the database Tuesday, but contact information for 54 students was not available, according the release.
The university recommends concerned 
individuals call UF’s Privacy Office Hotline toll-free at 1-866-876-HIPA.

ON CAMPUS
� ABOUT 115 PEOPLE WERE 
TURNED AWAY.
By JOSHUA ISOM
Alligator Contributing Writer
 
The hallway vibrated with the 
excited voices of people anxious to 
be the first to see “The Social Net-work” before anyone else.
And thanks to the Center for En-
trepreneurship and Innovation and the Reitz Union Board, they watched it for free, too.
At the Reitz Union Cinema on 
Tuesday night, about 500 people were in line, hoping to get a red wristband to watch David Fincher’s film about Mark Zuckerberg, the creator of Facebook and the world’s youngest billionaire. 
But the cinema only seats 350 
people, and according to Ashley Ro-don, film co-director for RUB, 150 of the seats were already reserved by 
the CEI.
Amid the clamor at the front of 
the line sat Mike Russo and Anne 
Elizabeth Clark, two freshmen who waited in line since 3:30 p.m. and al-ready had wristbands.
“The first thing we did was up-
date our Facebook status,” Russo said.
The buzz was considerably less 
for those without bands at the back of the line.
Some were eating salads; others 
gazed outside at the rolling storm clouds. All of them were waiting for their ticket in.
Around 7 p.m., the 
bad news came. The last of the bands had been given out. 
Andrew Wyzan, creative direc-
tor for the RUB film committee, said about 115 people had been turned away altogether. 
Before the doors opened at 7:30 p.m., attendees were told to leave their cell phones and bags at the Re-itz Union Ballroom counter.
Two additional men in black 
suits and ties were standing at the entrance of the cinema armed with handheld metal detectors.  
With the lecture hall seats and 
the loud chatter from the students, 
the cinema felt like being in a high 
school classroom without a teacher.
Rodon said the CEI contacted 
Sony Pictures to discuss bringing “The Social Network” to UF. Sony agreed to show an advance screen-ing for free to raise publicity for the film, and since the RUB doesn’t have to pay A/V or room costs for the cin-ema, the CEI contacted them to ar -
range a movie night. 
According to Abby Swartz, film 
co-director for RUB, Sony Pictures covered the costs of screening and security detail, so there were no ex-penses for RUB. 
As the lights dimmed and the 
movie played, the audience ap-peared to connect with the movie. There was laughter, cheering and noises of outrage during the appro-priate moments.
When the credits rolled, thunder -
ous applause stirred the tiny cin-ema.

Alina Fernandez, daughter of Fidel Castro and out-
spoken critic of his regime, spoke to students Wednes-day night to unravel the personal story of her father’s counterrevolution. 
Fernandez, who wrote “Castro’s Daughter: An Ex-
ile’s Memoir of Cuba,” took a packed University Audi-torium through her childhood and into her adult life. She escaped from Cuba through Spain in 1993.  Still, the 
revolution follows her.
“What’s most bizarre,” she said, “is that I come 
from a country in which the revolution is endless.”
Fernandez described the defining point of her fa-
ther’s counterrevolution as the moment in 1959 when her cartoons left the TV screen, replaced by an image 
of Castro descending the Cuban mountains alongside 
his fellow counterrevolutionaries. 
“That’s when Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse 
vanished from my screen forever,” she said.  
Fernandez laced her speech with humorous obser -
vations encountered along her journey.
She said that growing up as the child of Castro, 
with a mother who “made an army of her ideology” in support of communism, made it difficult to be around 
much of the Cuban population. 
“You know you must be in real desperation to ap-
proach a child, expecting her to be helpful,” she said. “What is worse is that you can’t do anything to help.”
Though she says almost nothing has changed in 
Cuba since Castro assumed a term that lasted through 
11 American presidencies, Fernandez compared the constant organization of Castro’s regime to a farm. 
“In Cuba, health and attention and education 
are free, but you’re not paid for your work,” she said. “They make about a $10 salary a month at most. 
It’s a farm that belongs to the Castro family , in which you’re going to consume everything but they’re going 
to keep the money .” 
Though she said the prospect of a rebellion is nearly 
impossible, Fernandez is hopeful that Cuba awaits a 
bright future. However, this will depend on the cur -
rent generation. 
“I think we’re waiting for each generation to pass 
away,” she said. “That generation is almost 80 years old now. They’ll have young people like [the audience members] willing to go back to the country.”
Her expectations of the Cuban youth, however, 
were not so optimistic. She said after the speech that their work ethic has declined as a result of commu-nism.
“The basic quality is that they’re hopeless,” she 
said. “The best you can aspire to in Cuba is to become a barber or a hairdresser or a manicurist. That’s the maximum you can achieve now. That’s why people are able to get on a piece of wood and travel 90 miles 
through water full of sharks.”Castro’s daughter shares story

ST. LOUIS — The odds against 
winning $1 million in the Lottery: 
Astronomical. How about doing it twice?
It happened to a man from 
Bonne Terre, Mo., Missouri Lot-tery officials said Tuesday. Ernest Pullen, 57, won $1 million with a “100 Million Dollar Blockbuster” 
Scratchers ticket in June. And this 
month, he won $2 million with a 
“Mega MONOPOLY” Scratchers ticket.
Pullen, a retired military man 
who was working at the help desk 
for a telecommunications company 
before retiring after the first lottery win, said he considers himself to be a “lucky guy.”
You think?
John Wells of the Missouri Lot-
tery said the chances of winning $1 
million in the “$100 Million Dollar Blockbuster” game are 1 in 2.28 million. The odds of winning $2 
million in “Mega MONOPOLY” 
are about the same.
The chances of winning both?
Because they’re independent 
games, it is impossible to calculate 
the odds, Wells said.
“But it’s a pretty amazing co-
incidence,” he said. “We’ve had 
players win big multiple prizes before, but this is the first person to ever win a second million-dollar prize in the history of the Missouri 
Lottery.”
Pullen bought the most recent 
winning ticket on Sept. 17 at Mill-
er’s Quick Shop in Bonne Terre, a community in the Old Lead Belt 
region of eastern Missouri, about 
60 miles southwest of St. Louis. He 
opted to take the cash payment in-stead of the annuity for both wins. He received $700,000 for the June 
winner and will get about $1.3 mil-
lion for the September winner — 
both before taxes.
Pullen recalled a dream six 
years ago in which he won a lot of money. Even after the $1 million 
win in June, he didn’t feel like the 
dream was complete.
He does now.
“All the numbers I dreamed 
about, and all my lucky numbers, 
were on the card,” Pullen said.
Pullen plans to use the money 
to fix up his new house, which 
needs a new lakeside wall.
As for the Lottery, he figures 
he’s about used up his luck, though 
he still might play the big jackpots 
on Powerball and Mega Millions.
“My wife said she’s winning 
the next time,” Pullen said.THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 5

In order to improve electric flow and response time, 
UF’s Physical Plant Division is upgrading medium-volt-
age cables and switches.
Mike Gentry, the All Florida Electric Co. Inc. project 
manager contractor, said that the current oil fuse cutouts, 
designed to give protection to all classes of circuits, are extinct in the industry and will be replaced with gas-op-
erated switches. 
The existing switches, some of which have 
been in place for as long as 40 years, have 
limited capabilities.
The upgrading project, which was origi-
nally started during the beginning of summer, is sched-uled to be completed by the end of December.
According to Gene Platt, a medium-voltage techni-
cian who has been with All Florida Electric Co Inc. for 
12 years, each electrical box feeds electricity to supply a 
100-yard radius. 
In every metal box there are 15 cables, and each cable 
has 7,200 volts.
Platt said that while there will be an outage in the 
buildings to swap out the switches, it will not have any effect on classes as it will be conducted on the weekends. Physical plant

Dirty Tricks
Political ploys               
embarrass SG
Every semester during election season, we’re accosted by 
party supporters passing out glossy fliers by the thou-
sands. Every semester, we develop more advanced meth-
ods, a la Harriet the Spy, of evading the volunteers who stake 
out places we can’t avoid and try to convince us to vote for one 
party over the other. And every semester, we find ourselves 
shaking our heads over pitiful and shameful ploys to throw one 
party or another under the political bus. 
A Unite Party representative brought our attention Wednes-
day evening to just one more example of such a ploy. 
According to this gentlema and the evidence he brought us, 
members of the Independent Coalition of Students distributed cheap, unconvincing fliers while wearing T-shirts displaying the names of the Unite Party and now-defunct Gator Party. This representative also brought along Nancy Drew-style cell-phone pictures of the independents printing large quantities of (can you guess?) to support his case (we know what they look like). 
The fliers encouraged members of UF’s Greek community 
to “protect [their] house[s]” from trying to ascend UF’s political hierarchy because Florida Blue Key has already chosen its next three Student Body presidents from a select few houses.
Whether we believe that information to be true is irrelevant.  
To be honest, with all the rumors, lies and fairy tales we hear  every semester, we don’t know what to believe. In this case, though, we’re focused on the sad reality that instead of cam-paigning based on merit and serving the students like they 
promised to do, some people would rather spend their time at-
tacking the opposition. We’re not amused when Rick Scott does it, and we expect better from our peers. 
Smear campaigns do nothing but make the offenders seem 
petty and unworthy of holding power. Focus on your own cam-paigns, kids. Maybe then you’ll have a chance.
Dirty Deeds
In Erin Brockovich style, Gainesville city com-missioners and Alachua 
County commissioners have fighting words for the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agen-
cy: We’re sick of this.
Voting unanimously 
on a 26-page list of recom-mendations and critiques of how best to clean up the Cabot-Koppers Superfund site, both legislative bodies expressed disgust with the 
federal government’s slow 
response on removing con-taminated soil and generally providing a safe environ-ment for area residents.
And we join them. 
Enough is enough.
The Gainesville wood-
treatment-site-turned-envi-
ronmental-disaster has been 
listed as a Superfund site for its contaminating effects since 1984 – or before al-most every student here was born. Things have gotten so bad 
that a massive door-to-door study of residents’ health near the wasteland was rec-ommended. 
We’re blatantly offended 
that residents of Gainesville have had to deal with the poisoning infection seeping through the soils left de-cades ago, which only paints an image more sinister than that of the oil monster in “Fern Gully.”
We’re also left question-
ing what the point of label-ing such a location as a Su-perfund site does if it’s left to fester for more than a quarter century. 
It’s time for the EPA to 
recognize what Gainesville residents need and deserve. 
A quarter century is long 
enough to wait to return our environment to normal. Or at least as close as we can bring the tainted, infected land to normal. China: Greatest threat to Americans
With so much focus at home, our current govern-ment is letting a lot happen abroad. 
China continues its economic ascent and posi-
tions itself as a rival to America while we fumble with gigan-tic domestic programs that run up the country’s credit card 
bill like a 16-year-old at the Mall of America.
At this point it’s wise to at least be aware of the challenges 
and even some possible threats an increasingly powerful 
China poses to the United States. 
Three areas are of the most concern: economics and trade, 
China’s growing military and naval power and a potent cy-berwarfare capability . 
In his recent trip to China, President Obama discussed 
China’s growing anxiety about the inflating American dollar 
with the Chinese prime minister. China is the largest inves-
tor in U.S. government bonds, of our currently $1.3 trillion budget deficit, China has lent $846.7 billion.
In a recent Bloomberg article, Yu Yongding, former advis-
er to China’s central bank, even said China is worried about the safety of its foreign exchange reserves including those in-vested in U.S. treasuries.
Though we are gradually working on paying our debt 
back, China remains economically aggressive, erecting vari-
ous trade barriers and keeping its currency at artificially low 
rates.
By sea, China has increased its deep-water navy power to 
an extent that hasn’t been seen since the massive exploration fleet of the Ming Dynasty in the 15th century. The issue here is  these are not wooden junks meant to explore foreign lands but military vessels intended to assert dominance over the South China Sea, a maritime region of the world that over -
sees one-third of all sea-based commerce.
China plans to expand its fleet of submarines to match 
that of the United States by 2020. This could pose a threat to the vital economic area of the East Pacific where the United States and other countries currently enjoy unimpeded access by sea. Perhaps the most jarring of the 
three categories  is China’s cyberwar -
fare front. Today’s high-tech military arsenal relies on computers, satellites and microprocessors in almost every 
operation and function. As such, all 
digital technology is subject to cyber -
sabotage.
Companies and government de-
partments within the U.S. have been 
dealing with an escalating number of hacking attempts that have been identified as originating from inside China. It was suggested in a 2009 report by a congressional advisory panel that the advanced Chinese hacker community has ties to the 
country’s central government. 
After the Google attack in January 2009, a McAfee execu-
tive called Chinese-based attacks “highly sophisticated.” In a 
Wired article, the McAfee official elaborated, “We have nev-er, ever, outside of the defense industry, seen commercial in-dustrial companies come under that level of a sophisticated attack.”
The important question to pose is to what ends does this 
present a threat or obstacle to our country? 
Twenty-one years ago democracy demonstrators were 
massacred in Tiananmen Square. Political and human rights are still suppressed in China. The PRC hasn’t always been the most cooperative player on the global stage, and China remains a one-party authoritarian state. Some of these newly developed capabilities only have an offensive use. For all these reasons, the U.S. must be vigilant and skeptical of Chi-na’s intentions. 
To take just one possible example, a Chinese cyberattack 
could result in substantial personal data loss for millions of Americans. And we all know how devastating a day without Facebook would be.

Unite Party majority guaranteed un -
less students care
With Student Government election 
season wrapping up, it is not news to 
anybody that SG elections are less than 
earnest. 
In all of the elections I have wit-
nessed during my time at UF, I never 
doubted whether the Gator or Unite 
Party would carry the day and continue 
to maintain the status quo at UF. 
This is not due to a lack of effort from 
opposition parties but rather to the way elections are carried out at UF. 
As long as students compete head-
to-head in single-seat districts, 20 percent of the population will get the chance to dictate what the remaining 80 
percent must live with. 
If seats were apportioned through 
a more proportional system, electoral 
minorities would see
substantial increases in representa-
tion. 
If the Student Senate would pool 
all of the seats everybody would have a better chance to have their voices 
heard, regardless of the questionable 
election tactics of the Unite Party. 
Until reforms to the system are enact-
ed, it is essentially a guaranteed major -
ity for the Unite Party. In the meantime, 
opposition parties (or independent co-
alitions) should start figuring out how they can coerce the non-Greek commu-nity at UF into voting for them.

When I accepted a summer intern-
ship at the Narcotics Affairs Section of the U.S. Embassy in 
Mexico I was naively underestimating the magnitude of Mexico’s precarious issue 
with organized crime. During my first day 
of work, as I walked into my office, I ob-served the amount of American personnel and resources devoted to narcotics issues in Mexico. It took me no time to realize that I was about to work in one of the most relevant divisions within the embassy.
The motif of headlines in Mexican 
newspapers everyday revolved around 
findings of mass graves, assassinated 
politicians, corruption scandals and car -
tel feuds over territory. But what is this “drug war” really all about? And what are the U.S. and Mexico actually doing to deal with this issue? These questions remained trapped in my head during my three-month stay in Mexico, and the unique ex-periences I was exposed to slowly peeled 
away at the systemic and entrenched drug 
issue in Mexico.
During my second week as an intern, 
a co-worker told me, “You should start packing because you are going to Ciudad Juarez in two days.” I did not know how to reply to this unappealing invitation. Ciudad Juarez is considered to be the most dangerous city in the world. In this year 
alone, more than 2,100 people have been 
killed — a figure that might surpass last year’s death toll of 2,700. As I arrived at Juarez under the burning sun and got into the armored Suburban, I could observe dozens of trucks carrying masked police-men with AK-47s and sub-machine guns. As soon as the voyage began, it became 
unavoidable to see teenagers standing in 
the corners of streets with walkie-talkies, and many suspicious cars driving around with pitch-black windows and no license plates.
A month later, 
I had the oppor -
tunity to work for 
one week along the U.S.-Mexico border 
in Yuma, Ariz., and San Luis Rio, Colo., 
in the state of Sonora. During my stay between the walls built by former Presi-dent George W. Bush, I was alarmed by the severity of drug, weapon and human trafficking.
One night under the pouring rain, I 
had to get into a cab in order to get home. As soon as I got in, my driver made some 
phone calls and specified his location 
and his intended destination. After look-ing at the taxi’s permit with the driver’s name and photo, I realized that the person driving me was not the person in the ID, and that if I stayed in that cab I was prob-ably going to get kidnapped or assaulted. I quickly told him to drop me off and he showed reluctance to stop the car. There-
fore, on the next red light I had to jump 
out of the cab and sprint as fast as I could.
After all of these experiences, I progres-
sively acquired a thorough understand-ing of this complex issue and the ways it might be tackled. As both presidents Cal-deron and Obama have stressed, this is a shared problem between the United States and the United Mexican States. The U.S., 
which has a high demand for illicit drugs, 
and Mexico, which has a high capacity for drug production, are equally guilty in this illicit enterprise. While the U.S. needs to work exceptionally hard in reducing demand at home and controlling arms movement along the border, the U.S. gov-ernment is also trying to help out Mexico 
with a strategic plan called the Merida 
Initiative. This policy includes donating billions of dollars in order to dismantle criminal organizations, institutionalize the rule of law, develop 21st-century bor -
der facilities and build strong and resilient communities.
What the U.S. is trying to do is supple-
ment and guide Mexico in serious institu-
tional changes that need to be put in place 
if permanent change is to be achieved. Institutional and structural issues such as corruption, a weak judiciary system and unemployment are Mexico’s problems, and no matter how much aid they get from the U.S., it is a change that Mexicans need to undertake within their great sov-ereign territory.
Not without justification, the Merida 
Initiative is often criticized because its social component is the last priority and it has not shown a commitment with im-proving the social aspects that are visible to the public. While this policy should be enhanced by allocating more funds to so-cial and educational programs that will reduce demand for drugs, Mexico needs 
to play its part as well and improve its 
mediocre public education system and provide more job opportunities in order to reduce the supply of labor for the drug market.
On Sept. 16, Mexico celebrated its 200 
years of independence. After observing how much Mexicans love and care about their country, I am convinced they will 
not allow organized crime to completely 
plague their republic, and that they will re-sist, just as Colombians did for more than 20 years. When it comes to Americans, we must not show ignorance, indifference or unresponsiveness. We must be as com-mitted as Mexicans should be. If not this issue which no wall (no matter how high) 
can stop will progressively permeate the 
1,969 miles that make up our border.

Don’t be surprised to see firefighters, campus 
police and other officials wearing pink uniforms 
today.
Firefighters from all over north central Florida 
along with UF police officers will wear pink to support women battling cancer with UF’s South-eastern Healthcare Foundation as part of the Pink Heals Initiative.
Kevin Rulapaugh, the coordinator of the event, 
said pink is the color traditionally associated with women, and authorities will wear the color to show women they care and support them.
“Big, manly men on a firetruck wearing pink 
shirts goes to show there’s power in wearing pink,” he said.
UF police spokesman Capt. Jeff Holcomb said 
campus police have already raised more than 
$2,000 selling the pink T-shirts, which cost $15 
each.
He said he hopes officers wearing the shirts 
will make people stop and say , “What in the world?”
The free Pink Heals event will begin at 2 p.m. 
today. Gainesville politicians will read a proc-
lamation and give speeches at the Bo Diddley 
Community Plaza downtown.
Police will then escort attendees to Butler Pla-
za West, near Target. The main event, “Celebra-tion of Women,” will be there from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.
There will be live music, radio stations, a Life-
South blood mobile, health care booths and guest speakers from the UF Shands Cancer Center.
Gator Domino’s will sell pizza and Sweet 
Dreams will sell ice cream.  Both will donate a portion of their proceeds to the cause.
Pink Heals T-shirts and other merchandise 
will be sold.
Six pink firetrucks from the national Pink 
Heals tour will be there, and the tour’s founder, Dave Graybill, will speak.
Graybill, a firefighter from Phoenix, Ariz., 
started the Pink Heals movement four years ago when the wife of one of his coworkers was bat-tling cancer.
With the city’s support, he bought a firetruck 
from eBay Inc., painted it pink and drove it around to raise money for breast cancer.

The UF Band Hall of Fame is 
about to get brighter with the ad-
dition of two honorees.
The UF College of Fine Arts 
music department will celebrate 
the musical contributions of con-ductors Frank Wickes and Linda 
Moorhouse at the Hall of Fame 
Concert tonight at 7:30 p.m. in the University Auditorium. 
According to Dr. David Way-
bright, director of bands at UF, the two musicians will each con-duct one piece at the concert to-night. 
The two musicians arrived in 
Gainesville on Tuesday and re-hearsed once with the UF bands on Wednesday, according to Waybright.
Wickes, who just retired from 
his position as director of bands at Louisiana State University, said he was surprised when he received the notification phone 
call over the summer and was 
unaware that UF had created this award. 
“This is a special deal for the 
students,” Wick-es said. “They reap the ben-efit and learn more about the 
profession and 
about its his-tory.”
Moorhouse, 
who received her bachelor of mu-sic education at UF, is currently a visiting associate professor of music at the University of Illinois, where she conducts the wind or -
chestra and teaches instrumental conducting classes.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — A grand jury 
decided Wednesday against investigating 
a citizen’s complaint about a $48 million 
appellate courthouse so opulent that crit-
ics are deriding it as a “Taj Mahal.”
The new home of the 1st District Court 
of Appeal in Tallahassee has become a 
political football with politicians blam-
ing each other for approving a sprawling structure replete with a rotunda, dome and columns modeled after Michigan’s Supreme Court building.
Other features include private bath-rooms with granite countertops for each of the 15 judges as well as big-screen televi-
sions and kitchens.
State Attorney Willie Meggs said the 
grand jurors didn’t say why they turned 
aside the complaint but that he personally 
didn’t think there was any criminal wrong-
doing by judges who sought the project or lawmakers who approved it.
“They went through all the proper 
channels,” Meggs said. “Nobody was try-
ing to hide the fact it was going to built as 
a courthouse.”
This one, though, has drawn plenty of 
attention from the news media and politi-cians.
Loranne Ausley, the Democratic can-
didate for chief financial officer, has cited the courthouse as an example of wasteful spending by Republicans who control the Legislature such as her opponent, Senate 
President Jeff Atwater.
Gov. Charlie Crist, a former Republican 
now running for the U.S. 
Senate as an independent, 
blames his Republican ri-
val, Marco Rubio, who 
was House speaker when the project was funded in 2007. Crist, though, signed the budget that included the courthouse and 
a bill that included a bond issue to fund 
the project.The Republican Party of Florida puts 
the blame on current Chief Financial Of-ficer Alex Sink, the Democratic candidate for governor, because she joined Crist and other Cabinet members, all then Republi-cans, in approving the bond sale.
Chief District Judge Paul Hawkes, a 
former legislator, this week distributed a letter defending the project.
He wrote that it went through regular 
legislative channels over a four-year peri-od, will free up the court’s existing build-ing for use by Florida State University and cut utility costs due to its “green” design.
Hawkes also noted the price includes 
$6 million in impact fees paid to the city of Tallahassee. Fla. grand jury won’t probe ‘Taj Mahal’ courthouse

The Student Alliance party won 20 
Senate seats during the spring SG elec-

“What was so promising a push that 
we made in the spring just seems dead now,” Kleponis said. 
Alan Yanuck, who has represented the 
Keys Residential Complex for two years as a member of the Student Alliance par -
ty, lost his seat to the Unite Party.
“I’m feeling fine,” he said. “I’ve had 
two years and I’ve done a lot of things I’m 
proud of. Hopefully my successor will do 
a lot of things they’re proud of.”
Student Body President Ashton 
Charles, who represents the Unite Party, 
said she was proud of her party and all 
the hard work the candidates did for their campaigns. 
“I think it really represents the fact 
that we truly represent who will make a difference on campus,” Charles said. 
She said even though her party lost 
two seats, she is still looking forward to working with the Student Senate in the future.
“I’m so proud of everyone, win or 
lose,” Charles said.
According to Griffin, 7,526 ballots 
were cast during this fall’s election. She said this turnout was slight-
ly lower than that of 
previous fall elections. 
“I’m glad to see people are participat-
ing,” Griffin said.

Commission, said there were 11 cam-
paign and election complaints filed as of 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, but candidates had until midnight to file more.

LONDON — Police increased 
their guard around Buckingham Pal-
ace and other landmarks Wednes-day as security officials monitored what they described as a fledgling 
terror plot to wage Mumbai-style 
shooting sprees or other attacks on Britain, France or Germany.
At least some of the recent CIA 
strikes in Pakistan were aimed at al-Qaida operatives suspected in the plot, U.S. officials said. European officials said the plot was still in its early stages and not considered 
serious enough to raise the terror 
threat level.
Still, the Eiffel Tower in Paris was 
briefly evacuated Tuesday — the second time in two weeks because of an unspecified threat — and French police were on alert.
A heavy police presence was 
seen Wednesday around Bucking-
ham Palace, Trafalgar Square and 
Big Ben. Victoria Station was briefly evacuated after an unusual smell was reported.
“This plot was in its embryonic 
stages,” a British government of-ficial told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonym-ity because of the sensitivity of his 
work. He said the plot had preoc-
cupied the security community more than other recent threats, but did not merit changing the security threat level from severe to critical.
Some details about the plot came 
from Ahmed Siddiqui, a German citizen of Afghan background who was captured in Afghanistan in 
July, a U.S. official said.
Intelligence authorities used Na-
tional Security Agency wiretaps to 
flesh out details, U.S. officials said, and while a Mumbai-style shooting spree was one possibility, there was no concrete plan. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak 
about the plot.
Secretary of State Hillary 
Rodham Clinton told reporters 
Wednesday the U.S. was working closely with its European allies, but declined to provide specifics.“We are not going to comment 
on specific intelligence as doing so threatens to undermine intelligence operations that are critical in pro-tecting the United States and our allies,” Clinton said. “As we have 
repeatedly said, we know that al-
Qaida and its network of terrorists wishes to attack both European and U.S. targets.”
“I want Americans to know 
how focused we all are in the government and how committed we are not only in protecting our own country but in protecting our 
friends and allies.”
The Department of Homeland 
Security would not say Wednes-
day whether U.S. security has been enhanced as a result of the terror threats in Europe.
Revelations of the plot came just 
ahead of the anniversary on Thurs-day of the publication of the Proph-et Muhammad cartoons in a Danish newspaper.
It also came as Spanish authori-
ties announced they had arrested an American citizen of Algerian origin on suspicion of financing al-Qaida’s 
North African affiliate.
Mohamed Omar Debhi, 43, 
was taken into custody Tuesday, 
although Spain’s Interior Ministry said the arrest was not connected to the terror threat. He is suspected of laundering money and sending some of it to an associate in Algeria, Toufik Mizi, to be passed on to al-
Qaida cells in the Islamic Maghreb, 
an Algerian terror group.
Europe has been a target of nu-
merous Islamic terror plots — the deadliest being the 2004 Madrid train bombings, when 10 shrapnel-filled bombs exploded, killing 191 people and wounding about 1,800.
A year later, suicide bombers killed 52 rush-hour commuters in London aboard three subway cars and a bus.
In 2006, U.S. and British intelli-
gence officials thwarted one of the largest plots yet — a plan to ex-
plode nearly a dozen trans-Atlantic 
airliners.
Despite the beefed up security 
presence at tourist sites in London and other European capitals on Wednesday, most visitors took the news in stride and went on with their sightseeing.
“In this case, ignorance is bliss,” 
said Theodore John, a 35-year-old banker from Pittsburgh who was visiting Buckingham Palace and heard about the threat Wednesday.
Officials gave no other details of 
the terror plot except to say that it originated in Pakistan with a group “threatening to wage a Mumbai-style attack” on cities in Britain, France and Germany.
“This was the headline threat 
but it was not clear whether the attack would come in the form of shootings or other small-scale at-tacks,” said the British government 
official.
A three-day siege in 2008 by 
gunmen in the Indian city of Mum-
bai left 166 people dead and raised fears of similar low-budget types of attacks around the world — a de-parture from the sophisticated and precision-planned Sept. 11 terror at-tacks in the United States in 2001.
U.S. intelligence had heard of 
the European plot about a month ago and was monitoring the people involved, according to two U.S. of-ficials. The CIA recently stepped up airstrikes from unmanned aircraft in northern Pakistan, in part to dis-rupt the plot.
However, a second British gov-
ernment official said that while the drone strikes were thought to have disrupted the planning of the at-tacks, the operation was still consid-ered active. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensi-tivity of his work.
The Obama administration has 
intensified the use of drone-fired 
missiles in Pakistan’s border area. 
This month there have been at least 21 attacks — more than double the highest number fired in any other single month.
CIA director Leon Panetta was 
in Pakistan for talks with the head of the country’s main spy agency. A Pakistani intelligence officer 
confirmed Panetta was meeting 
Wednesday with Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha.
A Pakistani official said some in-
formation about the plot was com-ing from a suspect who had been interrogated at the military prison at Bagram Air Base near Kabul. Sid-diqui is reportedly being held in 
Bagram.
The Pakistani official, who spoke 
on condition of anonymity because 
the investigation was continuing, characterized the evidence as more aspiration than a fully planned ter -

Julie Cohen, a 26-year-old recent gradu -
ate of Florida State University, is new to 
Gainesville and looking for friends.
She likes having fun, reading, shopping 
and watching “True Blood.”
She’s single, blond, attractive, and inter -
ested in friendship and dating. 
Julie’s not very different than most 20-
somethings in town, except for one small de -
tail — she doesn’t exist.This Friday, theaters across the country are 
debuting “The Social Network,” the true story of how the world-changing, Myspace-destroy -
ing, time-draining, mega-site Facebook came to be. In honor of the movie, we decided to 
do our own little social experiment to see just 
how friendly the Facebook world really is.
This is where Julie comes in.
We know we broke the rules (sorry, Mark). 
Fake profiles violate Facebook policy, and it says so loud and clear in the site’s “Statement 
of Rights and Responsibilities.”“You will not provide any false personal in-
formation on Facebook,” the guidelines read, “or create an account for anyone other than 
yourself without permission.”
What can I say: My editors put me up to it. 
But with all due respect Mr. Zuckerberg, our 
“social experiment” was only intended to shed light on what we believe will go down in his-
tory as the largest cultural contribution of our 
generation (so pretty-please-with-wall-posts-

Ellie Circhansky spends her weekends digging. Sifting through 
mounds of clothing at thrift stores, she stretches her $20 allowance 
to its bare bones, salvaging the simplistic designer pieces others have tossed from their closets and welcoming them into her own.  
Earlier this month, her website, HwoodStyle.com went live. 
HwoodStyle offers celebrity- and designer-inspired pieces for 
an affordable price, all less than $80. 
Not everyone has a knack for unearthing fashionable pieces 
and spotting their potential, but you could say it runs in Circhan-sky’s blood. 
Her mother worked in retail for 40 years with positions such as 
Kris Kardashian’s personal stylist (pre-TV show) as well one of the founders of the first Nordstrom on Rodeo Drive. 
“She’s passed it on to me,” Circhansky said. “I’d look through 
her closet and would find vintage pieces from the ‘70s and ‘80s and bring them back by incorporating them into today’s style.”
Flash forward to a second-year fashion merchandising major at 
Santa Fe College, and Circhansky is making her own high-heeled footsteps in the industry—far from her mother’s fashion hangers. Implementing her talent for formulating fashion at a skinny price, Circhansky has become an entrepreneur at age 19. 
“A lot of people don’t think you can look nice in a $30 outfit,” 
Circhansky said. “But style doesn’t have to cost a fortune. Forever 21 and H &M are trendy, but they aren’t celebrity inspired pieces.”  
Circhansky researches celebrity paparazzi pictures and then buys similar pieces on a wholesale website to then sell on HwoodStyle.com. She built up her savings from working at Saks Fifth Avenue in her hometown of Boca Raton to invest into bringing her creation to life. 
What distinguishes HwoodStyle from other sites that offer ce -
lebrity looks for less is that Circhansky’s site offers everything in 
one place. 
In other words, it’s not an exhausting hunt for the fashion find. 
Everything’s right there in front of you, no work required except for 
a simple click. 
“It’s a one-stop shop,” Circhansky said. T-shirts are priced around $20, sweaters around $30, outer -
wear around $30, and bags around $80. In the fall items currently available on HwoodStyle, shoppers can expect to see what Cir -
chansky describes as “street chic” featuring vintage plaid, embel-
lished tunics and leather jackets. Pieces are accompanied with a 
snapshot of a model or celebrity that’s sporting the look such as Miley Cyrus, Mary-Kate Olsen and Nicole Richie. 
However, in some of the photos on HwoodStyle, shoppers can 
expect to see a familiar face. 
Circhansky was so eager to launch her site that she didn’t want 
to spend the time casting models. 
She decided to just get it all done quickly by modeling the looks 
herself in a “paparazzi” inspired style in photos taken in downtown 
Gainesville.
“Being in Gainesville was an inspiration in itself,” Circhansky 
said. “I wanted HwoodStyle to be a place for people to go that of-
fered more options [for fashion].”
Gaining hits from out of state as well as in, Circhansky remains 
hopeful for the future of HwoodStyle, looking to do fashion shows and establish boutiques nationally, pinned with the HwoodStyle name.  thursday, september 30, 2010   � ALLIGATOR, 11

 Since its inception in February 2004, Facebook has 
been on a path toward world domination. Originally in-
tended for college students, Facebook is now used by ev-eryone from your little sister  to your 74-year-old grandma.According to a recent article by the Washington Post, 
about two-thirds of Facebook’s membership is older 
than 26, and its fastest growing demographic outside the United States is middle-aged women.
  As more people ﬁ  nd themselves spending more time 
staring at their newsfeeds, we have to ask ourselves: Why?
  “Facebook … is a website sort of constructed to take 
advantage of the fact that you care about your friends,” said Gary Ritzenthaler, a graduate communications stu-
dent who teaches a journalism class about social me-
dia. His class asks students to take a closer and harder look at social media sites.
  But while Facebook touts bringing us closer to the 
people we cherish, some people have more than 300 friends  — and it’s hard to believe they’re all besties.
  “The term ‘friend’ has totally sort of been co-opted 
by Facebook. It means a lot of different things,” Ritzen-thaler said. “We have these connections to people, and what do they mean? We don’t really know the answer to that.”
  Julie, thus, was born to test the waters. Her purpose 
in her short life was to see how willing we really are to open ourselves up to strangers online. To accept their friendship requests and, like it’s nothing, share with 
them our birthdays, phone numbers, pictures, who 
we’re dating, who we’re related to, what we like to do, where we are, where we will be – almost everything.
  The original thought was no one would buy it. No one is going to add someone with one picture and no friends that they’ve never seen before.
  But that was very wrong.   Within a day, Julie had more than 80 friends. She 
updated her status, left comments on threads and liked different posts. She began getting invited to events and left messages on the walls — and she was getting re-sponses. 
    She started getting messages from random people, 
telling her they’d seen her out over the weekend, asking when she’d be back in their town, what she’d been up to since high school. A few asked straightforwardly where they’d met before, but most just went with the ﬂ  ow.
  It was bizarre and shocking, and it was time to ﬁ  nd 
out why people were so welcoming.
  “At ﬁ  rst, I thought she was one of those spam peo-
ple, but then I saw she was friends with some of my friends,” said Alan Lipp, a friend of Julie’s, upon ﬁ  nding 
out she wasn’t real. He’d assumed he must have met 
her before but didn’t remember.
  “I am still going to add cute girls, but they will need to 
provide proof of their physical reality, most easily done on a date,” Lipp said.
    That random request might not be just a cute boy 
or girl. Maybe it’s a company boss trying to get a better idea about a potential employee. Maybe it’s a bully look-ing to trick someone into sharing personal details. Or 
maybe it’s just some creep trying to look at hot college 
chicks and blend in among them.
  Julie is gone now, her ﬂ  imsy presence a mere blip 
in the land of social media. My “Frankenstein” days are over, and I won’t be making any more fake proﬁ  les (Pinky promise, Mark!).

    We sent Alligator writers to Tues-
day’s advanced screening of “The So-
cial Network” at the Reitz Union, this 
year’s highly anticipated portrayal of 
the rise of Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg. 
  Look out for bathroom sex, cocaine 
use, Harvard fraternity bros and drunk LiveJournal blogging. Also, Justin Tim-berlake is in this movie and does not dance. Disappointing. 
  What do you need to know before 
you see this movie? Well, they liked it. And although the real Mark Zuckerberg isn’t attached to this movie, his hyper-bolic evil-nerd role makes for a good 
story and a great ﬁ  lm. Even if you don’t 
watch it, you’ll probably read all about it tomorrow ... on your newsfeed.
  In between party ﬂ  ashbacks 
and lines of programming code, the 
movie surrounds Zuckerberg in two 
lawsuits about his business deal-ings with fellow Harvard students — one is played by the new Spi-
derman (mmm, Andrew Garﬁ  eld).
Like all great inventions, Facebook was created by a nerd who was pissed at his ex, and it tells the story of the Ivy League legend who launched the web-
site we all waste most of our time on. thursday, september 30, 2010   ALLIGATOR, 13 12, ALLIGATOR  thursday, september 30, 2010

 ‘Zuck’ On ItFake Facebook profile fools more than 80 ‘friends’ 
SOCIAL , from page 10 Avenue challenge: Five days without Facebook 
  By JUSTIN PLEMMONS
 avenue writer
  Before I even get out of bed in the morning, I roll 
over and check my Facebook. While I’m in class, I 
keep my laptop open so I can pretend to type notes while my professor lectures and check my Facebook. When I’m with friends, I get on the Internet, so I can 
show them a video of a cat who wants a cheeseburger 
and check my Facebook.
  My entire life has become a puzzle of ﬁ  nding out 
how to access my Facebook as often as possible. The little red box notiﬁ  cation sign has become a barometer of self-worth, and when the new friend request icon lights up, I feel like a kid on Christmas morning.
  My name is Justin Plemmons, and I am addicted to Facebook. 
Therein lies my predicament, and I’m going without 
Facebook for a week just to see what happens.
  Tuesday:  I count Tuesday as my ﬁ  rst day. I log in one more 
time to post a status about me being ofﬂ  ine for the 
next week, so nobody would think I died.
  I can imagine logging on Facebook 
on Sunday and seeing an invite to my own funeral. I would click “maybe” be-
cause I’m coy.
  They say no Facebook for a week, but that starts 
when I next log out. So if I never log out, I never have to 
leave Facebook. But then I realize my computer is set to restart in 15 minutes, and when it boots back up, it’ll be logged out automatically.   Here it goes. 7:15 p.m. Tuesday. Five days without 
Facebook. 
You can do this Justin (I talk to myself when I’m 
nervous).
  One week without funny status updates.  One week without funny status update comments.  One week without pictures of my female friends 
boozing and wearing skimpy outﬁ  ts.
  I can do this.  Wednesday:
  Today, I have been legitimately concerned about 
whether or not anybody has commented on my fare-
well update.
  Will anybody care I’ve been gone for a week? 
Would  my professors pass Facebook 101? 
  By JESSICA POITEVIEN
avenue writer  
  It’s weird to think that our professors exist outside 
the lecture hall — never mind on your newsfeed. 
In a culture where everyone has a Facebook, cy-
berspace run-ins with the person who grades your ex-
ams are highly likely.
  With an ofﬁ  cial UF Faculty network on Facebook, 
where does that leave our professors? Facebook eti-
quette isn’t exactly on the syllabus, so it’s up to stu-dents and professors to make their own guidelines.
  Professors and students can invite each other into 
their personal and professional lives with a simple friend request. While some professors only accept re-quests from former students, others use it as a tool to 
connect with current ones.   “I think it gives me good insight about my students 
and what their interests are,” said journalism profes-
sor Jean Chance.
  But Joe Meert, a geology professor, said a friend 
request doesn’t guarantee a passing grade.
  “It doesn’t matter if you’re my friend on anything,” 
Meert said. “You get what grade you deserve in my class. [My students] understand that.” 
Thanks to a constantly updated news feed, it’s 
easy to keep up with our friends’ statuses or photos of 
their drunken escapades. So when it comes to keep-
ing their Facebook image in tip-top shape, professors say they stay away from putting anything risky online — but are often amused by their students’ posts.“If I get updates about [former students] uploading pictures, I’ll go look at them, and sometimes there are these embarrassing pictures of them drunk off their asses partying,” said Sean Witty, a linguistics profes-
sor.
  That’s a visual that’s all too familiar to history pro-
fessor Steven Noll.
  “The pictures my students post are not shocking 
to me,” Noll said. “I’m shocked more at the fact that 
they’re stupid enough to put it up there.”
  Chance said she has no sympathy for students who 
miss assignments — especially when freshly tagged party shots show up on her news feed.
  “The Monday night before a paper was due I got an 
email from [a student] around ten o’clock saying he wasn’t going to have the assignment and wanted an extension,” Chance said. “Just out of curiosity, I looked at his Facebook page. I saw all these comments about this great beer party he had on Sunday, and I just laughed.”   see FACEBOOK, page 14
Dear Jared,
  I work at a local food chain and everything is going great, but there’s just one problem: My boss and I are falling for each other. To make matters worse, he is double my age and has a child. I want him, but I’m afraid of the social and occupational ramiﬁ  ca-tions. What should I do?  -Young and in Love
 Oh, the blights of two modern star-
crossed lovers. Substitute a narcotic for an illegitimate child and a romantic 
Verona for equally lustful Gainesville, and we have ourselves our very own tale brewing wor-thy of a Sassy Gay Friend’s intervention. 
  Assuming your surname is, in fact, not Capu-
let or Montague, you’re in good hands here. Just 
call me Allstate.
  First, who said falling for your boss is a bad 
thing? Aside from the fact you’ll probably get ﬁ  rst dibs on who gets Friday nights off and won’t get stuck rolling silverware until the end of eternity – because you’ll be too busy bracing yourself up against the sneeze guard – you might even get an Employee of the Month certiﬁ  cate. Who can turn down new fridge décor? 
  Essentially, you have quite the beneﬁ  t pack-
age to gain. 
  And as for that whole professional relation-
ship, moral-shmoral dilemma -- are we really go-ing to discuss this? I’m assuming your “local food chain” doesn’t mean “Raymond James ﬁ  nan-ciers” and your “boss” doesn’t mean your “law school professor.” 
  I’m assuming we’re talking more along the 
lines of your boss is a 36-year-old assistant man-
ager at the local Pizza Hut with a case of adult 
acne and an afﬁ  nity for Stouffer’s TV dinners.  
  I  doubt you’ll gather 35 years of seniority at 
this place, collecting more pieces of ﬂ  air on your vest than a redhead has freckles, so the talk of job security is about as worthy as Michael Vick’s chances of winning the Eukanuba Dog Show. 
  Now that we’ve talked about the amount of 
care you should put in your assumed short-term 
job (minimal if the chance of after-hours Hut sex 
and free pizza is high), let’s open up this other can of worms.
  Double your age? It’s hard to answer this with-out knowing your age. Assuming you aren’t a fourth grader dating a 
college junior and as-
suming your boss is prob-ably mid-to-late 30s, age is just a number, baby. 
  Assuming this is all le-
gal fun for everyone, and no statutory rape action is going down, what’s the 
hold up? Move your Pizza Hut line along, and let 
this grandpa gather ‘round your good stuff.
  What kind of social ramiﬁ  cations are we talk-
ing about here? Are you worried his child will call 
you “that person who always leaves barefoot from our house”? Are you anxious of being known as The Hut Whore? Or are we concerned with be-coming the next Douglas/Zeta-Jones ﬁ  asco? 
  If you feel in your heart that this is genuine, 
and you have a chance for love, don’t take that 
lightly. Society’s opinions mean little in your quest 
for happiness. You’re lucky to ﬁ  nd that special someone, and you should consider that when weighing your paltry concerns over what society might think. 
  And if your job really does mean that much 
to you, and if you’re worried about things getting 
awkward if you two split, perhaps you should see 
if Domino’s is hiring.
  Just don’t let the kid call you “that skank we  
knew.”
 
 Dear Jared,
  I have an issue I deal with on the daily: I fall in and out of lust too quickly. The shelf life for one of my love interests is typically a week’s time.After that, I lose interest and move onto the next one. This obviously leaves no time for a long-term anything. Is there something wrong with this? What can I do to stop the madness?  -Flavor of the Week
 
 Solution: Stop being such a whore.

 Just a Dream
Nelly takes on a less literal and more 
symbolic form in the video for his 
latest song, “Just a Dream.” It’s a song 
about regret for a failed relationship —  sounds like a 
snooze, right? 
But in this day and age, when music in visual form 
has become more than obsolete due to reality TV, it’s hard to expect much of music videos (exception: video-making queen Lady Gaga, of course). As the rapper’s love interest, “Vampire Diaries” star Kat Graham, drowns and refuses Nelly’s help, a ﬂ  oating oversized ring, and a car burn to ashes in the sky. Nelly’s new venture is a refreshing reminder that music videos still can be made well and enhance the 
meaning of the song they depict. Just the Way 
You Are
Singer/songwriter 
Bruno Mars struck pop gold 
when his debut single “Just the Way You 
Are,” soared to the No. 1 spot last week on the Billboard Hot 100. In the song, 
he croons, “When I see your face, there’s 
not a thing I would change ‘cause you’re amazing just the way you are.” Cliché? Check. Cheesy? Check. The Filipino-Puerto Rican artist brilliantly utilizes this heart-melting pop formula to its teen creaming capacity.The Social Network
Face it: Facebook is one of the 
biggest cultural milestones of Generation Y. So there’s really 
no other movie to see this weekend than 
“The Social Network,” a ﬁ  lm that tells the 
story of how the decade’s biggest, perpetual 
online popularity contest was started in a Harvard University dorm.  The movies stars Jesse Eisenberg (“Zombieland”) and the always loveable Justin Timberlake. Iron Man 2
  One of this summer’s biggest 
blockbusters hit store shelves 
this week, and it’s packed with 
tons of special features. And for a sequel with a plot that was less than brilliant, but 
whose scenes looked awesome, you’ll get 
your money’s worth — if you like action, that is. Both the two-disc DVD and three-disc Blu-ray packages include deleted scenes, fea-turettes and audio commentary from director Jon Favreau. The Blu-ray package, however, is far superior. The package includes cast and crew interviews, characters’ origins and additional behind-the-scenes video. buyFacebook challenge fails by Friday
Will there be any kind of fanfare when 
I ﬁ  nally do log back on? A weirdly poignant 
fear of mine is that I’ll have no new notiﬁ  -cations come Sunday.
 I thought I would have been more pro-
ductive without Facebook draining away at my time, but in reality, all I’ve managed to do is ﬁ  nd other ways to fool around.
  I found out my roommate had “Poke-
mon Snap” and an N64, so I beat it. I had some comics that I never got around to reading, so I read them.  
      Thursday:  It is really hard to burn a few a minutes 
without Facebook. In a just world, I would be going through my friends’ statuses and thinking of witty comments to make.
  Status: “Carolyn had a great time with 
the boys last night!”
  Comment: “I’m sure you did ;)”    Friday:  Today I found myself in a weird posi-
tion where I actually needed to get on 
Facebook for personal reasons. I thought 
it would be satisfying to see notiﬁ  cations and event invites, but it just felt cheap and weird and not at all enjoyable and cathartic like I thought it would.
  However, after being on Facebook 
for just about ﬁ  ve minutes to send a few messages, I found myself craving it like nicotine.  Saturday:  I kept busy for almost the entire day. 
But when I got home around 10 p.m., I 
realized I had nothing to do.
  I close my laptop and turn on the TV. 
Then I get a text from a friend of mine say-
ing he just put up pictures from this party we went to and how hilarious they are.
  Crap.   My parents are on Facebook; 
they can’t see pictures of me drinking and being a bad Christian — they’ll be stricken with grief.   So I log onto Facebook and see 
three notiﬁ  cations. None of them are tell-
ing me that I was tagged in any photos. I send my friend a text message.
  He sends one back that says, “SIKE.”     Sunday:  So here I am, Sunday 8 p.m. I techni-
cally didn’t make the entire ﬁ  ve days, but I don’t care. Logging onto Facebook to mess around for the ﬁ  rst time, I really am 
disappointed. There is no fanfare. Just a 
little blue button above my newsfeed that says “300+.” 
  I realize now that I don’t miss Face-
book at all. For a site that wastes so much of my time, there is little actual content to it — all the site does is turn us into nosy gossips.
  My friend Danielle wants me to join a 
group that promises somebody will name their kid “Megatron” if a million people join. I click ignore. NO FACEBOOK , from page 12Classifieds ALLIGATOR

POLL RESULTS TEEING OFF WITH MIKE McCALL QUOTABLEUF running back Jeff Demps (foot) will probably play Saturday, 
according to coach Urban Meyer.
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Staff Writer
achiang@alligator.org
 
Mark Ingram underwent surgery just four 
weeks ago.
Since then, he has knifed his way through 
two defenses for 308 rushing yards and four 
touchdowns.
The Alabama running back has shown no 
signs of the arthroscopic knee surgery he re-ceived just before the season, averaging 9.3 yards per carry after missing the first two games.
“My main focus coming back into the first 
game was to not have any hesitation in my step whatsoever,” Ingram said. “I wanted to have 100 percent confidence in my ability and what I can do out there on the field.”
He has done that, and the team isn’t sur -
prised.
“I don’t think I have ever been in shock,” 
Alabama quarterback Greg McElroy said. “I have never doubted what he can do. He has great ability, and he does a great job with the ball in his hands. We all thought he was go-
ing to have a great season this year.”
But Ingram isn’t alone. Sophomore run-
ning back Trent Richardson has provided a 
second option in the Crimson Tide’s back-
field.
Richardson, who ran for 751 yards as a 
freshman, is already almost 
halfway there with 356 through four games. He racked up 210 
of those yards in Ingram’s ab-
sence.
The Crimson Tide’s backs, who are as 
strong as they are fast, weigh a combined 435 pounds, something the Gators’ undersized 
linebackers could struggle with.
“I’ll tell you, [tackling Ingram is] hard to 
do,” Alabama defensive back Mark Barron said. “You can’t go in scared, you just have to ‘Bama RBs bring power, speed
 THE GATORS ARE GETTING 
KILLS FROM ALL SPOTS.
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Writer
gluca@alligator.org
 
Trying to defend against the Flor -
ida offense is like reading a “Choose 
Your Own Adventure” book. 
The only difference is that, 
against the Gators, there’s almost never a correct choice. 
If you try to block the outside, 
they’ll feed the middle blockers. If you attempt to block the middle, they’ll send it outside. And if you can somehow block both, that’s when they’ll strike via the pipeline. 
No. 2 Florida’s attack options ap-
pear nearly unlimited, and through 11 matches the majority of them 
seem equally effective. 
Excluding junior Kelly Murphy , 
who leads the team with 3.07 kills per set, the difference between the 
team’s top-five scorers is just .85 kills per set. 
Last season, the difference be-
tween No. 2 scorer Colleen Ward and No. 6 scorer Cassandra Ander -
son was 1.78 kills per set. 
“When you can distribute the ball 
among various people, you become a 
team that’s harder 
to defend,” coach Mary Wise said. “You can’t double 
team a player or 
you leave some-body wide open, and that’s what happens. Kelly Murphy will al-
ways be double-teamed.”
Opposing coaches have found 
that none of the Gators can safely be 
left open, as a pack of five players 
averaging between 1.4 and 2.3 kills per set has Murphy’s back. UF using balanced 
offensive attack By TYLER JETT
Alligator Staff Writer
tjett@alligator.org
 
Florida running back Jeff Demps 
removed his protective boot Wednes-
day but is still limited in practice.
Coach Urban Meyer said Demps 
(sprained foot) will probably play Saturday at No. 1 Alabama, assum-ing the tailback can practice at full 
speed by Friday. 
Demps originally injured his foot 
against Tennessee on Sept. 18, when 
a UF offensive lineman stepped on it. Demps was the centerpiece of Flori-
da’s offense in its first three games, 
but the junior looked less explosive last week against Kentucky.
Including kick returns, Demps 
touched the ball 13 times for 98 yards against the Wildcats. Enter -
ing that matchup, he was averaging 19.7 touches and 207 total yards per game.
“He is just one outstanding play-
er,” Alabama coach Nick Saban said. “He’s a good runner and has great speed at the perimeter, probably the 
likes of which we have not seen. But 
I think [Florida’s] entire team does, and they have some other backs that are capable guys as well.” 
Florida’s game plan will not 
change without Demps, but running 
back Emmanuel Moody said the 
bulk of the team’s carries will shift to sophomore Mike Gillislee (35.8 rushing yards per game) and himself 
(31.25).
“He’s a good player, as everyone 
knows and can see, but whether he’s 
in or not really doesn’t make a differ -
ence to us,” offensive tackle Xavier 
Nixon said, refer -
ring to the team’s play calling.
S w i t c h i n g 
sides: Nixon was equally noncha-lant about his move from left tackle to right tack-
le. Nixon, who has played on the left side since he first suited up in ninth grade, was told by the coaching staff that he would flip to the right side 
late last week. 
 “It wasn’t really a hard transi-
tion,” Nixon said. “I’ve never played 
right tackle before, so all the calls, (I’m) just switching them to the other 
side.”Senior Marcus Gilbert started 
Florida’s first two games at left tackle 
while Nixon recovered from a knee 
injury. Gilbert started on the right 
side against Tennessee — Nixon’s first game back — but returned to left tackle against Kentucky.
DBs looking up: The Gators’ 
defensive backs received a preview of this weekend’s matchup with 6-foot-4 Crimson Tide receiver Julio Jones against the Wildcats, who fea-
ture three pass-catchers at least that 
tall.  
Defensive coordinator Teryl Aus-
tin said cornerbacks Janoris Jenkins 
and Jeremy Brown fared well against 
the taller receivers, but freshman Cody Riggs struggled.
Riggs surrendered a 27-yard 
touchdown to Kentucky’s Chris 
Matthews in the third quarter, and 
Austin said the cornerback needs to locate the ball in the air sooner when he’s physically overmatched.
“If you get into a jump ball with 
those guys because you don’t have position, you’re probably going to lose,” Austin said.

play ball. You have to go at him. 
You can’t be scared of him.”
Florida defensive coordinator 
Teryl Austin knows exactly how to stop Ingram and Richardson.
“Probably have to stop the 
bus from getting to the stadium, 
that’s probably the only way,” 
he said. “We’re going to have to have our best tackling effort Sat-urday. Anything less than our best won’t be good enough.”
Austin, who coached in the 
NFL from 2003-09 before coming to UF, said he feels the Crimson Tide’s talented tandem is already 
good enough to suit up on Sun-
days. 
But slowing them is just half 
the battle.
The two will be key in setting 
up the play-action pass for McEl-roy, who hurt the Gators in their Southeastern Conference Cham-pionship loss to the Crimson Tide 
last season.
But Alabama isn’t using its 
recent win against Florida as 
any indication of how Saturday’s 
meeting will turn out.
“What happened last year, 
happened,” said Ingram, who ran 
for 113 yards and three scores in that game to lock up the Heisman Trophy. “It’s not really going to help us win or help them win this 
year. There is no dwelling on it 
from a personal standpoint.”
Florida’s run defense has faced the SEC’s leading rusher in 
each of the past two weeks and 
has held them to an average of 68 rushing yards. However, coach 
Urban Meyer knows the Gators 
can’t be complacent.“This will be a completely dif-
ferent challenge,” he said. “This is going to be a grind-it-out outfit that we have to tackle. [Ingram] 
breaks tackles at an alarming 
pace. Both those backs do.”
Outside hitters Kristy Jaeckel and Callie Rivers lead that 
group, recording 2.29 and 2.22 kills per set, respectively . 
Checking in behind them is right-side hitter Tangerine 
Wiggs with 1.86 kills per set. 
Middle blockers Lauren Bledsoe (1.61 kills per set) and 
Cassandra Anderson (1.44) round out the unit and give the 
Gators’ offense quality attack options that aren’t available to 
many teams. 
“Our middles have been really stepping it up,” Murphy 
said. “They’ve always been good at defense and blocking, but 
I think their ability to score points is going to make us a whole different team.”
Because Gators setters Murphy and Chanel Brown are al-
ways a threat to send a quick set to a middle blocker, oppos-ing defenses have to either wait before committing to a block or just guess and hope for the best. 
This defensive quandary allows Murphy and Brown to 
read the opposition and then find the open player, often gen-erating an attack against one or no blockers. 
“When everyone is making plays, it opens the court for 
each player,” Jaeckel said. “When everybody is doing what they’re supposed to be doing, it makes things a lot more fun.”
The team’s offensive balance was never more apparent 
than in last week’s three-set wins over Florida State and Ole 
Miss. 
In both matches, six Florida players registered five or 
more kills, the fourth and fifth times that has happened this 
season. 
Additionally , the spread between the Gators’ top scorer 
and their number six scorer was five against Florida State and just four against Ole Miss. 
On the season, that number has been six or fewer in five 
of 11 matches. 
“It would be like a basketball team where all five players 
are in double digits, not just one going off for 30,” Wise said. “That makes us much harder to defend, and I think it speaks well for our progress.”THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 21
Steven H. Keys / Alligator Staff
UF setter Kelly Murphy, who leads the team in kills, has 
received plenty of help from her teammates this season.
last season earlier this week, Meyer said the 
Gators took on a “rock star” attitude, which was inevitable given their fame as defending 
national champions. 
On Wednesday he clarified, saying the is-
sue was more a reflection of the times and that 
big-name programs receive more national at-
tention than they used to.
“There’s the places, like a Florida and the 
top [Southeastern Conference] schools, and 
even schools like Ohio State, 
[that] have the same issues,” 
he said. “Coaches spend a lot 
of time on trying to keep them grounded.”
Rainey still out: Meyer reit-
erated that receiver Chris Rainey will not play this weekend, despite the junior accepting a deferred prosecution agreement that reduced his third-degree felony stalking charge to a misdemeanor Monday.
Meyer has not decided if the reduction will 
increase Rainey’s chances to rejoin the Gators.
“I haven’t even thought about it,” Meyer 
said. “At the appropriate time, I’ll sit down 
with him and have that discussion. But that’s 
certainly not now.”Rainey still ruled out

� THIS WILL BE HIS FOURTH SEA -
SON AS THE COACH OF THE MAGIC.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
ORLANDO — Stan Van Gundy took a 
few extra trips this summer.
They weren’t vacations to exotic des-
tinations with five-star accommodations. 
The Orlando Magic coach just wanted to 
improve communication with players, so 
he traveled to some of their hometowns — and in typical Van Gundy fashion.
On one occasion this summer, Van 
Gundy flew to Atlanta to have lunch with 
Dwight Howard. No car service after land-
ing for Van Gundy; he took the MARTA, Atlanta’s metrorail.
“I don’t think I’ve rode the train since I 
was in middle school,” Howard said. “For him to get on the train is like crazy. He said people were bothering him and asking 
questions about the Magic. It’s crazy. But he really wants to be a part of us.”
It’s all tied into Van Gundy’s biggest 
goal this season: Improving communica-tion with players.
Maybe it’s hard to believe considering 
he’s an eccentric, never-afraid-to-say-any-thing coach, the kind who traded verbal jabs this summer with Miami Heat presi-dent and former boss Pat Riley. But Van 
Gundy recognized sometimes his in-your-face style bothers players.
The best way he knew to connect was to 
show players the messenger cared not just about their games, but the players and their 
families.
So Van Gundy also flew to Paris to 
spend time with small forward Mickael 
Pietrus, and not to see the Eiffel Tower or cruise down the River Seine. No, Van Gun-
dy took an overnight flight to France, spent about half the day on the ground with Pi-
etrus and then flew back home across the Atlantic the next morning.
“That’s dedication,” Pietrus said.
Oh, the coach wasn’t done.
During some offseason conditioning 
workouts, Van Gundy decided to lace em’ up and run sprints with other players who 
were in Orlando. The exercise drew mostly laughs, but it was appreciated by players.
“You should have seen me run,” Van 
Gundy said. “I don’t think you call those sprints. I don’t know what it was, but that was far from sprints. That was a 51-year-
old, overweight sprint.”
Van Gundy will also be sporting some new looks this season — one by choice, an-
other by mandate, and both of his creation.
Slightly slimmer and more physically 
fit, Van Gundy is exercising on an ellipti-
cal machine and lifting weights. He’s also trying to eat better, he said, and is sched-
uled to have another checkup in two weeks 
to find out exactly how much weight he’s 
lost.
“It would be almost physically impos-
sible for it to go up,” he said, chuckling.
And those trademark 
turtleneck shirts, com-plete with the same few sport coats on the side-
line, are gone. New NBA rules require coaches to 
wear collared shirts dur -
ing games.
In an appreciative 
gesture, Magic CEO Bob 
Vander Weide — after extending Van Gundy’s contract through 2013 — even had tailors fit the coach and some front-office 
members with suits. So, yes, a fully suited Van Gundy is coming to NBA sidelines.
Maybe even sometimes with a tie.
“I want them to at least name the rule 
after me,” Van Gundy said. “Somebody has 
their Bird rights. Larry Bird got that rule named after him. I want it to be the Van 
Gundy Rule.”
Consider it the next step in Van Gundy’s 
coaching makeover.
It was early last season, after all, when 
some players asked him to tone down the negative comments. Van Gundy com-
plied — at least for a little — and has since 
stressed the importance of communication.
No matter how he’s done it, Van Gun-
dy’s way wins.
In three years in Orlando, he has led the 
Magic to the Southeast Division title each season. They made the NBA finals in 2009 and were bounced by Boston in the Eastern 
Conference finals last season.
Only now, players say, Van Gundy has 
become more receptive to change, and com-
munication has never been better.
“He’s reaching out to us a lot more on 
text messages, just phone calls and asking 
about our personal life and getting to know 
us better. I guess he’s starting to open up a little bit,” Magic point guard Jameer Nel-
son said.
“People just have this misconception of 
him because he’s really animated on the 
sideline. Me, personally, I don’t take that as 
a knock. But sometimes people who don’t understand him might.”Van Gundy uses offseason to connect with players

BATON ROUGE, La. — When Alabama’s 
Greg McElroy turns on an NFL game, it re-
minds him of some of his worst moments as a Southeastern Conference quarterback.
“There’s a lot of guys that I see on Sundays 
that have hit me or tackled me or intercepted me or made things difficult for me,” McElroy 
said.
And McElroy is not exaggerating.
Heading into last weekend, players from 
the SEC had made more NFL starts since 2000 
than players from any major BCS conference. 
According to STATS LLC, SEC players had combined for 4,729 NFL defensive starts since 2000. The Big Ten was second with 3,540, fol-
lowed by the ACC, Big 12, Pac-10 and Big 
East.
SEC alumni have also combined for more 
NFL sacks (1,045.5) and more interceptions (343) the past decade. Big Ten players com-
bined for the second-most NFL sacks (778) 
during that span, but ranked fourth in inter -
ceptions. ACC players had combined for the second-most interceptions with 299.
LSU left tackle Joseph Barksdale says it’s 
the main reason the SEC has won four con-secutive national titles.
“You are playing against potential All-
Americans every weekend,” said Barksdale, whose No. 12 LSU squad has won non-con-ference games over North Carolina and West Virginia on its way to a 4-0 record.
“North Carolina and West Vir -
ginia had very capable defensive 
linemen. But the SEC teams have 
great starters and great depth,” Barksdale said. “Every week in the SEC, it’s like you’re coming 
out of a dogfight.”
McElroy , whose father is an executive with 
the Dallas Cowboys, says people understand the talent in the SEC on defense.
“Those guys are pretty fast and pretty ath-
letic players,” he said. “The fact that they start more so than any other conference in the NFL is not surprising to me, having played against them.”
This year, LSU is undefeated and climbing 
the national rankings — relying heavily on its defense. Quarterback Jordan Jefferson hasn’t thrown for 100 yards or a single TD in any of his past three games, the Tigers rank second-
to-last in the conference in total offense, and 
yet they keep winning.
“You don’t see big-time offenses in the SEC like the Big 12 where Texas Tech would score a 
million points,” said LSU center T-Bob Hebert, 
son of former NFL quarterback Bobby Hebert. 
“The SEC has more conservative styles of of-fense. SEC defensive linemen are close to NFL 
ready. The defensive linemen are beasts. They 
are 6-3, 300 pounds. That’s solid pounds of 
muscle.”
The second- and third- ranked defensive 
teams in the SEC are Alabama and Florida, 
both giving up fewer than 300 yards and both 
unbeaten — at least until they play each other 
this weekend.
“If you’re going to win championships, you’ve got to be good everywhere, but ulti-
mately it comes down to stopping people,” 
said LSU defensive coordinator John Chavis 
said. “It doesn’t matter how many points you can put on the board. If you can’t stop people 
and get the ball back for the offense, you can’t 
expect to win, particularly at the highest lev-
el.”
It’s hard to argue with Chavis’ logic, given 
that SEC teams that have won the past four na-
tional titles all had excellent defenses.
Defending champion Alabama is coached 
by longtime defensive specialist in Nick Saban, who has raved type of athletes — with their combination of size and speed — that SEC 
schools can recruit from their own region.
“There’s a lot of good players in this league, 
period,” said Saban, who has been both a head 
and assistant coach in the NFL. “The high 
school football programs in the Southeast are 
really good. There’s a lot of players that devel-
op. There’s a lot of good athletes. There’s a lot 
of speed. ... All those things contribute to the 
kind of players that they look for at the next 
level.”
Kansas City defensive linemen Tyson Jack-
son and Glenn Dorsey, and Washington safety LeRon Landry , are examples of players from 
LSU’s 2007 championship team who’ve found 
early success in the NFL.
At Tennessee, senior linebacker Nick Rev-
eiz spoke of admiring former Volunteers line-backer Al Wilson, who starred for Denver. 
Reveiz’s former teammate, Jerod Mayo, is a 
third-year starter for New England.
“You always hear about those great defens-
es of the SEC,” Reveiz said. “There’s so much 
tradition.”
Since the BCS began 12 years ago, a team 
from the SEC has won half of its title games. 
Chavis coached defense on the Tennessee team 
that beat Florida State in the first BCS champi-
onship game at the end of the 1998 season.
When the Tigers last won a BCS title, they 
struggled to overcome Tennessee’s Chavis-coached defense in the SEC championship 
game. LSU managed one offensive touch-
down, and needed two field goals and an interception for a score to beat the Volunteers 21-14. LSU then scored 38 points against No. 1 Ohio State in the title game.
When 2006 and 2008 Florida teams won 
national championships, offensive stars like Percy Harvin and Tim Tebow got a lot of at-tention, but both teams had top defenses. Flor -
ida’s 2006 squad was the underdog against then-No. 1 Ohio State, but the Gators won in a 41-14 romp, allowing only one offensive touchdown.
Although Auburn’s 2004 team never got a 
shot at the national title when it went 13-0, that team, too, was known for its defense. Gene Chizik, now Auburn’s head coach, was the de-fensive coordinator of that team.
“This league is, top to bottom, filled with 
really talented defensive players,” Chizik said. “The offenses, yes, they get a lot of credit and publicity and those things, but you can’t win championships without playing really good 
defense.”THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 23

Florida has some hardware 
missing from its trophy case, and 
the UF Student Government has 
taken notice.
In 1955, the Seminole Tribe of 
Florida and the city of Hollywood 
donated an authentic, hand-paint-
ed war canoe to be awarded to the 
winner of the annual Florida-Mi-ami football game. The canoe was 
carved from a 200-year-old cypress tree that was struck by lightning. 
According to the Miami’s athlet-
ics website, “The canoe symbolized the magnificent spirit and fighting determination traditional of the in-
dependent Florida Seminole tribe that was displayed annually be-tween the Hurricanes and Gators.” When the schools last met Sept. 
6, 2008, UF won 26-3 in front of a Ben Hill Griffin Stadium-record 
90,833 fans. The win snapped a six-
game losing streak to Miami dating 
back to 1985, but the trophy re-
mained on display at UM’s Sports Hall of Fame in Coral Gables.
Student Senators Andrew Hart 
and Jon Ossip authored a resolu-tion requesting that UM return the Seminole War Canoe trophy “to UF soil as soon as possible.” 
It passed through the Student 
Senate by a unanimous vote Aug. 31. Four weeks later, Hart has yet to receive a response from UM’s SG.
Hart said when he presented 
the resolution, his peers thought he was talking about the 10-foot-long Okefenokee Oar trophy awarded to 
the winner of the Florida-Georgia football game already sitting in the SG office. 
Nobody had even heard of the 
Seminole War Canoe, he said.
“During the summer, when 
they were talking about playoffs 
in college football, in-state rivals 
wouldn’t be play-
ing each other 
much,” Hart said. 
“I was procrasti-nating from my homework and 
came across the trophy online.”  
It’s not clear 
why the trophy 
exchange stopped. Its importance diminished during the 1970s, and a 
former Hurricane player, Don Mar -
iutto, recovered the canoe from a 
trash pile. Hart said the schools felt the 
trophy took up too much room to be passed back and forth on tempo-rary display.  
The annual rivalry ended after 
the 1987 season. 
Copies of the resolution were 
sent to the universities’ presidents and athletic directors. ESPN, The 
Miami Herald, The Gainesville Sun, The Miami Hurricane and The 
Alligator also received copies. 
Hart launched a Facebook group 
to rally support among the network 
of current and former UF students. 
Hart said he also wants input from 
the Seminole Tribe and the city of Hollywood on their trophy.
UM SG President Christina 
Farmer told the school’s student newspaper, The Miami Hurricane, that she would be happy to work with UF’s SG and the universities’ 
athletic departments to start new 
traditions, but that the students 
don’t have the authority to return 
the canoe. 
UF athletic director Jeremy Foley 
could not be reached for comment. 
Though the Hurricanes lead the 
all-time series 28-26, the Gators are 
19-12 against their South Florida ri-
val since the trophy’s inception. The only remaining scheduled meeting between the schools is in 2013, and 
Hart said he does not want to see one of college football’s great rival-
ries die then.
“It’s something we should bring 
back,” Hart said. “People talk about 
the good old days. We have tradi-
tion keepers to glorify Florida tradi-tions; it’s silly that we’ve forgotten 
about this one.”
