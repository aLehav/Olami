THE UNKNOWN SERIAL 
THIEF HAS STOLEN ABOUT 
20 PLANTS SINCE APRIL
By Dana Cassidy
Alligator Staff Writer
They don’t know who he is. 
They don’t know why he does it.
All Satchel’s Pizza knows is a 
man rode away with three of their 
hanging potted plants on a bicycle 
just before 5:30 a.m. on Wednesday.
It was three of about 20 
succulents, ferns and more stolen from the Gainesville pizza joint 
since April — that employees know 
of. They say it keeps happening. 
The culprit ﬁ  nally happened to be 
caught on surveillance footage.
“It’s just been an ongoing issue 
we’ve been trying to ﬁ  gure out,” 
said Satchel Raye, the restaurant’s 
owner. 
Raye isn’t sure how long the 
plant thief or thieves have been 
scheming, as hundreds of plants are 
housed at the restaurant. 
He’s been nursing the vegetation 
for a while and was confused why it looked depleted at times.
It wasn’t until ﬁ  ve months ago 
when Satchel’s gardener Ashley 
Watkins pointed out that plants 
weren’t dying — just disappearing.
The basketed plants spend a long 
time growing, they blossom from 
time-to-time and are aesthetically 
pleasing, Watkins said. It’s 
frustrating to see Watkins’ and 
Raye’s passions stolen, he said. 
A few weeks ago, Watkins woke 
up to see her staghorn fern hanging 
in the front garden replaced with a A YEAR AFTER 
HELPING ANOTHER 
INMATE ESCAPE FROM 
ALACHUA COUNTY 
JAIL, JUSTIN WILLIAMS 
SHARES HIS STORY
By Samia Lagmis
Alligator Staff Writer
Justin Lee Williams watched 
his reﬂ  ection against a dim 
screen in the Alachua County 
Jail. 
Dressed in a crinkled jump-
suit and equipped with a 
pen and paper, his blue eyes 
scanned the monitor as he 
picked up a one-way phone.
“Why did you do it?” he 
heard through the hard plastic. 
His pen raced to paper and 
Williams lifted a sheet up to 
the camera, his plump ﬁ  ngers 
gripping the edges. Five words 
became clear, shaking in his 
ﬂ  eshy grasp: 
“To prove that I can.”
Williams was arrested and 
taken to the Alachua County 
Jail in 2015, where he proceed-
ed to impersonate an ofﬁ  cer 
and fake faxes in an attempt to 
escape. About three years later, 
he used his hacking skills again 
to help another inmate escape 
from the jail. 
Now, he’s 29, in the North-
west Correctional Complex in 
Tiptonville, Tennessee, where 
he’s expected to serve time until 
November 2028.
The following story is com-
piled with  public records from 
the Alachua County Sheriff’s 
and mutliple interviews with 
Williams conducted from Janu-
ary to February. 
One year after breaking an-
other inmate out of jail, this is 
the story of the man who out-
smarted the system. 
Just to prove he could. Williams got his ﬁ  rst com-
puter when he was 11 years 
old as a gift from his grand-
mother, Wanda Bonner, who 
raised him. Bartending six days 
a week, Bonner scraped up 
enough extra cash to buy her 
grandson a worn computer that 
barely work. Williams found 
himself tinkering with the ma-
chine. Nine months later, he 
brought the computer to life 
and learned a new skill along 
the way — hacking. 
It started out small. In the 
early 2000s, while the Internet 
and online shopping were still 
new, he would hack Walmart’s 
website to steal computers and 
video game consoles. He would 
then sell the coveted treasures 
to help his grandmother pay her 
bills. 
In January 2014, four years 
after he last visited his grand-
mother, she died. He left two 
messages on her online obitu-
ary. The ﬁ  rst read in all caps, “I 
LOVE YOU MAMA.”
His last post to the website 
was the following: “My grand-
mother/mother left this world 
and escaped the pain of several 
debilitating illnesses on 1/7/14. 
While she’s truly missed, it’s 
understood that she’s in a bet-
ter place.”
The next year, Williams was 
trying to ﬁ  nd his own escape. 
He was partying in Miami 
with his sidekick Shawn Free-
land. They sped down Interstate 
75 on their way back to Tennes-
see. Soon, their blasting music 
was overpowered by blaring 
sirens. 
Williams, who had an active 
out-of-state warrant from Sum-
ner County, Tennessee, was ar-
rested after he failed to appear 
on the original charge of “theft 
of property $10,000 to $60,000.” Who is the plant bandit?

“I’ve been kind of really upset about it,” Watkins 
said. “It’s not just an easy thing to replace.”
Raye isn’t able to move all of the plants indoors 
due to space constraints, a watch guard is too costly 
and other security measures just aren’t plausible, 
he said. 
Raye contacted law enforcement but decided 
not to ﬁ  le an incident report on the matter. Instead, 
he took to Twitter to see if civilians recognized the two-wheeling bandit.
“The cops don’t have time to look for a plant 
thief they don’t know anything about,” Raye said.
Watkins and Raye aren’t sure why anyone 
would consistently steal plants. Watkins said she 
doubts anyone is selling them, and said they are 
perhaps collecting or giving them away.
Regardless, Raye said he and Watkins just want 
their pizzeria plants left alone.

dcassidy@alligator.orgPLANTS,  from pg. 1‘Not just an easy thing to replace’
At the Alachua County Jail, 
Williams made a phone call to a 
man he called “Edgar.” He dis-
cussed his potential jail time for 
the arrest, “along with all of the 
checks I have been writing.” Dur-
ing the conversation, Williams 
slipped up and called the crackling 
voice on the other end “Shawn.” 
The man was conﬁ  rmed to be 
Freeland by authorities, according 
to an ACSO report.
On Oct. 1, 2015, Williams 
called Freeland again and shared 
his personal login for a website 
used to buy credit card informa-
tion with bitcoins.
Later that day, Williams used 
Freeland to conduct a three-way 
phone call to the Sumner County 
Sheriff’s Department in Tennes-
see, where the warrant for his ar-
rest was issued. According to the 
jail, if a three-way call is detected 
it will be immediately disconnect-
ed – Williams’ call wasn’t. 
Over the phone, Williams be-
gan his elaborate lie. He identi-
ﬁ  ed himself as James Woodland, 
an ACSO employee, and inquired 
about the status of his own war-rant. Williams told the employee 
that Sumner County needed to lift 
the warrant. 
Williams and Freeland laughed 
about how easy it was to trick the 
Sumner County employee about 
his identity. 
“Believe it or not, I have actual-
ly talked them into lifting warrants 
before,” Williams told Freeland.
The men continued plotting 
over the phone. In another three-
way call, Williams, posing again 
as James Woodland, told Sumner 
County they have two days to pick 
him up. 
He conspired with Freeland to 
ensure his escape. They planned 
to create a fraudulent fax from the 
Sumner County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce 
calling for his release. When an 
Alachua jail booking clerk became 
suspicious of the fax, Williams’ 
plot was foiled.  
On Aug. 27, 2018, Williams 
began his next challenge. He used 
another inmate’s personal access 
number to make a call to a woman 
he referred to as “Boo-boo.” 
He told her Macajiah Valen-
zuela was an inmate at the Ala-
chua County Jail charged with at-
tempted second degree homicide 
and had a bond set at $850,000. 
Valenzuela promised Williams he would pay him $10,000 cash if 
he could use his skills to pay his 
bond. 
In another three-way call Wil-
liams called Sam Wesley Bail 
Bonds, posing as Valenzuela. He 
told the bondsman he had more 
than $1 million in his bank ac-
count and was willing to pay the 
full amount of his bond.
He then called a woman 
identiﬁ  ed as Amy O’Connell 
and instructed her to pose as a 
banker. With Williams’ guidance, 
O’Connell fooled the Sam Wesley 
Bail Bonds representative and Va-
lenzuela was released that same 
day.
Williams was put into solitary 
conﬁ  nement on Oct. 8, 2018. 
     When asked why he was put in 
conﬁ  nement, he wrote “escape,” 
surrounded by quotation marks. 
In his mind, the escape didn’t 
count; he never got out. 
Williams squints at the win-
dow looking for the outside world.
On Christmas, he wakes up 
and sings holiday carols to him-
self. His tenor voice escapes thin 
lips and ﬁ  nds no audience within 
the walls of his cell. He recalls a 
past life where he held second 
chair in his high school choir and 
for a moment, remembers what it 
felt like to be applauded. 
On Jan. 7, the ﬁ  fth anniversary 
of his grandmother’s death, Wil-liams withdrew his prior plea of 
not guilty and pleaded no contest 
to the charges of trafﬁ  cking stolen 
or  counterfeit credit, use or pos-
session of another person’s ID, 
false impersonation of an ofﬁ  cer, 
scheme to defraud, unlawful pos-
session of another person’s ID, pe-
tit theft and use or possession of 
another person’s ID.
His plea was accepted. 
Williams was sentenced to im-
prisonment for two years consecu-
tive to his active sentences in Ten-
nessee. The order also stated that 
the “defendant may be required to 
continue assisting state investiga-
tors.”
Williams is scheduled to ap-
pear for parole consideration in 
August 2022.
Sitting alone in the Alachua 
County Jail, through a broken 
phone and pixelated screen, Wil-
liams shared his hopes for when 
he’s no longer behind bars. 
He misses listening to music 
and asked about his favorite sing-
ers Taylor Swift and Sam Smith. 
He asked to hear their new music 
through the phone. 
When asked what he hopes to 
do once free, he held a piece of 
paper to the monitor and pointed 
to the swollen words, “Start a fam-
ily.”

IT’S A TRADITION 
FOR TATTOOS TO BE 
DISCOUNTED
By Nick Hudson
Alligator Staff Writer
Friday the 13th may be ﬁ  lled 
with bad luck, but there is always 
one unique perk: discounted tat-
toos.
Getting cheap tattoos on Fri-
day the 13th has been a national 
tradition since the mid ‘90s, ac-
cording to Vice. The tradition be-
gan after tattoo artist Oliver Peck 
threw a 24 hour tattooing party on Friday the 13th in 1995.
Tattoo parlors in Gainesville 
are keeping up with this custom 
by lowering their prices for the 
day.
At Anthem Tattoo Parlor, 
the cost of tattoos starts at a mini-
mum of $60. The shop will have 
14 ﬂ  ash sheets and more than 
100 designs for patrons to choose 
from.
The parlor is at 230 NW 2nd 
Ave. and is open from 12 p.m. to 
8 p.m.
Mike Salay, Anthem Tattoo 
Parlor owner and artist, said hav-
ing Friday the 13th sales is a tradi-tion for his parlor.
“We’ve always done it. We 
consider it customer appreciation, 
giving back to the community for 
choosing us as a tattoo parlor,” 
Salay said.
The artists at Bodytech Tat-
tooing and Piercing created a 
custom ﬂ  ash sheet consisting of 
red and black tattoo designs. Each 
tattoo costs $40 and can only be 
placed on arms and legs. 
Bodytech Tattooing and Pierc-
ing is at 806 W University Ave. 
and is open from 11 a.m. to 1 a.m.
While Wunderland Custom 
Tattooing is not directly celebrat-ing Friday the 13th, the shop is 
still reducing its prices on Friday 
and Saturday in honor of their 
four year anniversary.
A selection of special anniver-
sary designs can be found on its 
Facebook page. Each costs be-
tween $50 and $150, depending 
on the size, placement and color 
of the tattoo.
Wunderland Custom Tattoo-
ing is located at 235 S Main St., 
and is open from 12 p.m. to 8 
p.m.

KYLE BLUNDELL, 27, WAS 
ARRESTED MONDAY ON  
FELONY CHARGE
By Dana Cassidy
Alligator Staff Writer
Drops of blood left behind during a 
break-in at the Greater New Hope Bap-
tist Church in June led to the arrest of 
a man on felony charges on Monday.
Kyle Blundell, 27, of Gainesville, 
was accused of breaking into the 
church on the 15000 block of North-
west 278th Avenue and trying to get in-
side the pastor’s ofﬁ  ce, according to an 
arrest report from the Alachua County 
Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce. Blood in the church 
matched Blundell’s DNA, which led to 
his arrest.
The report did not say why he broke 
into the church.
Blundell was released from the Ala-chua County Jail on his own recogni-
zance Thursday morning. He has been 
charged with burglary and criminal 
mischief of a church, which are both 
third degree felonies, according to 
county records.
Damages included a broken glass 
window, a damaged pastor’s ofﬁ  ce 
door and a broken mirror that was 
attached to it. An interior door that 
was “almost broken in half,” deputies 
wrote.
Blundell was previously arrested on 
a misdemeanor charge of damage to 
property in 2015 among other arrests 
more than $200 and less than $1,000, 
according to county records.
The Alligator was unable to reach 
the church and the person who ﬁ  led 
the complaint in time for publication.

HE IS ON ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE
By Dana Cassidy
Alligator Staff Writer
An Alachua County Jail detention ofﬁ  cer is on 
administrative leave after deputies charged him for 
domestic violence against another Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce 
employee.
Christopher Hathcock, 33, is accused of push-
ing a woman he was dating to the ground Tuesday 
morning after a miscommunication about where 
she was sleeping, according to the ACSO arrest re-
port. Deputies arrested him when he got to work 
and charged him with battery.
He was released from the jail on his own recog-
nizance within about three hours of being booked, 
according to the jail.
Hathcock works in the jail’s Security Opera-
tions Division, according to an ACSO release. 
The woman told deputies this isn’t the ﬁ  rst time 
he abused her, and she feared for her life. Depu-
ties wrote she kept pictures of injuries throughout the years. 
Deputies said a friend of the victim reported the 
incident on Tuesday. 
She and Hathcock did not live together or have 
children, but they often spent nights at one an-
other’s houses, deputies said. She spent Monday 
night at Hathcock’s house and packed her bag be-
fore work Tuesday morning to go home.
Hathcock started arguing with her about not 
telling him sooner, according to the arrest report. 
She left for work but went back to Hathcock’s 
home to get her phone, deputies wrote. Hathcock 
walked up to her and said, “Get the f--- out of [my] 
house.”
She told deputies he put his hand to her face 
and pushed her, causing her to fall backward to 
the ground. She arrived to work 30 minutes late 
and was limping. In 2011, an internal investiga-
tion was completed on Hathcock, said Art Forgey, 
ACSO spokesperson. The Alligator requested a 
copy.

How to combat mental health stereotypes
When you picture an asylum, what

it’s a prison-like building with white 
walls and barred windows. Maybe 
even a “Shutter Island”-esque ocean 
lockup ﬁ  lled with unknown or unspeakable 
horrors. I think it’s telling that just Googling 
‘psychiatric asylum’ brings up images meant to 
invoke fear: walls with writing scratched into 
them and patients conﬁ  ned to straitjackets. But 
is this really the way we should be depicting mental illness, 
something that 1 in 5 adults struggle with yearly?
These stereotypes are not coincidental. The stigma 
against mental illness can be traced back to how terribly 
mentally ill individuals have been treated throughout his-
tory, not only in the U.S., but around the globe. Today, 
studies show this stigma materializes in the way we are 
treated by our family members, peers and teachers. Those 
afﬂ  icted are belittled as burdens while the act of seeking 
help is made out to be taboo. I’ve heard a friend be de-
scribed as “too depressing to be around” due to their social 
anxiety. This social stigma is often invalidating and pain-
ful, leading to self-hatred. Our mentally ill peers are often 
forced to ﬁ  ght on three fronts: against their illness, against 
those who discriminate against them and against them-
selves. Self-stigmatization, in turn, leads to a reluctance to 
seek help, pushing forward a vicious cycle. 
Despite a long history of challenges, there is so much 
we can do every day to combat these stigmas. One way is 
to simply talk openly and sensitively about mental health, 
while educating ourselves and others on the topic. By 
eliminating the idea that these discussions are somehow ta-
boo, we can encourage others to be more open about their 
own experiences. While doing so, we should always stay 
conscious of our language. For example, it’s better to say 
that someone “has bipolar disorder” instead of saying that someone “is bipolar.” In a quick shift of words, 
you can highlight that an individual is so much 
more than their illness. 
One great tip I think everyone should re-
member is to treat mental illnesses just as you 
would any physical illness. Think about the way 
you imagine someone with schizophrenia and 
compare that to how you imagine someone with 
cancer. Both are struggling with something far 
out of their control and both deserve equal re-
spect and access to humane treatment. 
Another way to help is to actively be positive about 
seeking treatment and therapy. There is no shame in seek-
ing counseling just as there is no shame in visiting a prima-
ry care doctor. I ﬁ  nd that this stigma is especially danger-
ous because it discourages individuals from getting better. 
Imagine if a man with a broken bone felt ashamed to visit 
the hospital? 
With regards to counseling, one of the holes that I’ve 
personally fallen into is the idea that “others have it worse, 
so I don’t want to take up a spot that would be better used 
elsewhere.” I promise there is no minimum threshold re-
quired for therapy. Your experiences are valid. You are 
valid.
At UF, we are fortunate enough to have access to the 
Counseling & Wellness Center, U Matter, We Care, the Care 
Team, Nutrition Services, GatorWell and more. Though 
they could always be expanded, I encourage anyone who 
feels that they would beneﬁ  t from a visit to schedule one 
soon. Classes can become overwhelming, so it’s important 
to remember to put ourselves and our well-being ﬁ  rst.

Columns of about 450 words about original topics and editorial cartoons are also welcome. Questions? Call 352-376-4458.It’s been a long week. Actually, a long month. You de-
cided to treat yourself (again), and hit the town with 
friends. After a long night of… never mind, it doesn’t 
matter. You ﬂ  op face-ﬁ  rst into bed and curl up in your 
plush comforter for some long deserved sleep. But, you 
don’t get to sleep in as planned. 
The next three hours are spent tossing and turning, toss-
ing and turning. You crack one eye open to check the time 
on your phone. 4 a.m. Ugh. Your stomach rumbles. You 
knew you should’ve gone to McDonald’s before calling the 
Uber. Another rumble. The emptiness in your stomach be-
comes unbearable, so you decide to take the L and walk to 
the kitchen. 
You stumble down the hall, deciding not to turn on the 
lights to not wake up your roommates. You swing the pan-
try door open and blindly reach in. What feels like a box 
of cereal hits your ﬁ  ngertips. You grab some oat milk and 
make yourself a hearty 4:15 a.m. snack. (Yes, it took 15 
minutes to get to the kitchen.) 
The ﬁ  rst bite is good. Mm, sweet. The next bite, though, 
is a little salty. The third bite is spicy, so spicy it burns your 
tongue. What is this? 
You ﬂ  ick the lights on to read the box. Oh no. You choke 
down the last bite, the spoon dropping from your hand. The 
box wasn’t full of cereal, at all. It’s…. It’s…..
Darts and Laurels
Another day, another bizarre celebrity couple PR stunt. 
Singers Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello shocked social 
media by posting an absolutely terrible video of them kiss-
ing with a lot of tongue. And face. It’s just a lot. A dart for 
Mendes and Cabello for tainting our Twitter timelines. We 
think The Black Sheep UF Twitter account said it best: They 
look like freshmen making out at Grog. 
In other celebrity news, President Donald Trump referred 
to Chrissy Teigen as John Legend’s “ﬁ  lthy mouthed wife” 
in another Twitter rant. A laurel for Teigen for having to 
put up with his harassment after speaking her mind. You do 
you, Chrissy. Keep the brunch recipes coming. We’re send-
ing a dart to the president for not minding his own busi-
ness. Maybe he should focus on comprehensive gun control 
legislation as much as he’s focused on vaping. Yes, we will 
give the Trump administration the slightest bit of a laurel
for cracking down on an industry (or at least Juul) that mar-
kets toward young people. 
Now, let’s pivot to chicken. The Popeye’s chicken sand-
wich is still taking over the world, despite multiple short-
ages. A dart goes to Popeyes for trying to ﬁ  x their sandwich 
issues by asking customers to bring their own buns. Pop-
eyes, what makes you think that we’re just carrying our 
buns around for whenever we’re hungry? You know who 
would never disrespect us like that? KFC. Speaking of the 
colonel, KFC Australia announced they’re offering a chance 
to have food, decorations and supplies provided to six cou-
ples’ weddings through May 2020. A laurel goes to this 
chicken joint for supporting love and our addiction to their 
11 herbs and spices.
Finally, a dart to the ferry that kicked off innocent Ba-
hamians who were trying to enter the U.S. after Hurricane 
Dorian wreaked havoc on the island. Any Bahamian on the 
boat found without a U.S. visa was told to disembark. While 
the ferry operator issued an apology, we’re still upset that 
he picked that moment to try to get “proper authorization.”

THE DRIVES END TODAY 
By Ana Escalante
Alligator Staff Writer
Several UF student organizations 
collected donations for the Bahamas 
after Hurricane Dorian’s devastation.
The Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity 
organized drives with the Caribbean 
Student Association, the Domini-
can Student Association, the Cuban 
American Student Association and 
Unión de Estudiantes Puertorrique-
ños Activos (the Puerto Rican stu-
dent association). Donations end 
today.
As of Thursday, the student orga-
nizations collected about 400 pounds 
of donations, said Ajay Patel, Tau Kappa Epsilon service chair. 
The organizations will drop off 
supplies at the Tau Kappa Epsilon 
house at 1000 SW 9th St. Fraternity 
members will also collect donations 
from other locations including the 
Sigma Kappa sorority house and 
Mayor Lauren Poe’s ofﬁ  ce in City 
Hall.
The Bahamian government says 
more than 1,300 people are missing 
as a result of the Category 5 storm, 
according to Reuters.
On Saturday, fraternity members 
will deliver supplies to a site in Or-
lando coordinated by HeadKnowles, 
a Bahamian-led organization. Da-
mon Veras, a pledge of the fraternity 
and 18-year-old UF political science 
freshman, said he found Head-Knowles on a Bahamian government 
website listing reputable charities. 
Veras, a south Florida native and 
head organizer of the drive, said he  
acted after realizing the storm could 
have hit the U.S. as well.
“It’s heartbreaking what hap-
pened to a lot of people’s homes 
there and the death toll and with all 
that going on,” he said. 
Veras said he had not contacted 
HeadKnowles as of Wednesday but 
was planning to do so. 
HeadKnowles is a private Ba-
hamian-led organization providing 
relief to areas affected by natural di-
sasters. According to its GoFundMe 
page, the organization previously 
supported rebuilding efforts in the 
Bahamas. By Thursday night, the campaign 
raised $1.3 million. But it remains 
unclear how the organization will 
prove where these donations go. 
Representative Kaché Knowles 
sent a press release that said the sup-
plies will be shipped via air and sea  
to volunteers partnered with shelters 
through Abaco, Grand Bahama and 
Nassau. The group did not respond 
to questions on distribution and con-
ﬁ  rmation on how the donations will 
reach their destinations.
The GoFundMe page was created 
on April 16 — ﬁ  ve months before 
the storm hit the Bahamas. Patrons 
can also send money directly to two 
unspeciﬁ  ed bank accounts, routed in 
New York or Georgia. Funds from 
the page go to HeadKnowles co-founder Lia Head-Rigby’s personal 
bank account and will be “promptly 
forwarded” into HeadKnowles com-
pany bank account, according to the 
GoFundMe. 
The efforts hit close to home for 
the Puerto Rican student association 
president Kimberly Ramirez. When 
Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico two 
years ago, she knew Latinx student 
organizations would be willing to 
help.
“Us Puerto Ricans, we felt their 
pain. As Cubans, they felt their 
pain,” she said.

THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL 
LIKEL Y BE CHOSEN IN OCTOBER 
By Hope Dean
Alligator Staff Writer
Nine months after Santa Fe College started 
searching for a new president, the school an-
nounced two ﬁ  nalists — Paul Broadie II and 
Edward Bonahue. 
Santa Fe President Jackson Sasser an-
nounced his upcoming retirement in February 
2020 after 17 years of serving as the college’s 
president. Broadie and Bonahue were chosen from a 
group of semiﬁ  nalists decided on in August, 
which cut more than 60 national applicants to 
seven. The two ﬁ  nalists were recommended by 
the Presidential Search Committee, comprised 
of three Board members, several faculty, local 
business leaders and a student. They will ei-
ther be conﬁ  rmed or denied by the Board on 
Sept. 17, Santa Fe’s human resources director 
Lela Frye said.
The ﬁ  nal cut includes a two-day process 
with public community engagement and inter-
views before Santa Fe’s Board of Trustees de-
cide who the next president will be. The Board 
will likely choose the next president on Oct. 
15, Frye said. 
Broadie, current president of Connectitcut’s 
Housatonic Community College and Gateway 
Community College, said he’s excited to fur-
ther familiarize himself with Gainesville during 
this last phase of the presidential search. 
“I’ve toured the area, and I see some of the 
socio-economic challenges that exist,” Broadie 
said. “I think we can have an impact in up-
lifting communities and closing equity gaps. 
That’s something that I’ve done here at Housa-
tonic and Gateway.” 
That’s not the only transferable skill Broad-ie says he has. He’s also worked in academic 
affairs, student affairs and fundraising, three 
areas that he says will help with Santa Fe’s up-
coming ﬁ  ve-year “strategic plan” for academic 
and campus growth. 
“This is such an exciting moment for me 
career-wise,” he said. “Should I have the op-
portunity, I’m willing to work day and night 
to fulﬁ  ll the obligation that has been given to 
me.” 
Bonahue, Santa Fe’s current provost and 
vice president for academic affairs, is looking 
forward to “reintroducing” himself to his peers 
as a presidential candidate, he said. 
However, Bonahue also sees his established 
position at the college as an advantage to the 
school — he’s already familiar with how the 
college operates and has pre-existing ties with 
UF ofﬁ  cials.
Bonahue also wants to see the college 
through students’ eyes to see what they need 
to succeed, especially given Gainesville’s eco-
nomic disparity and the nation’s competitive 
job market.
“We’re trying to be sure that there’s a really 
strong alignment between our students’ expe-
rience and all of the potential experiences we 
offer our students,” he said. Santa Fe’s Student Body President Kate 
Santacruz believes both candidates are quali-
ﬁ  ed to be president, but she wants whoever 
wins to maintain Sasser’s shared governance 
model. 
Santacruz said that Santa Fe has three main 
community groups — Student Government, 
the College Senate and the Career Service 
Council. All are free to voice their concerns to 
the president and the Board of Trustees.
“That’s how we get things done here, be-
cause we have a voice,” Santacruz said. 
Sasser said he feels a “touch of sadness” 
about retiring, but is ultimately excited to see 
what the college’s next leader will bring to the 
table. 
“What I’d love to see the new president 
do is to bring a whole new set of interests, a 
whole new set of ideas and get the college to 
the next level,” Sasser said. “Santa Fe is never, 
ever satisﬁ  ed.”

Florida had five former offensive tackles on opening-day NFL rosters: DJ 
Humphries, David Sharpe, Jawaan T aylor, Marcus Gilbert and Trent Brown. 
That was tied with Oklahoma for the most of any program in the country. Jessica Pascoe will compete 
in her first meet of the season

Florida has its chance for revenge a year 
after Kentucky marched into Gainesville and 
ended its 31-year losing streak to UF with a re-
sounding 27-16 victory.
The No. 9 Gators will meet undefeated Ken-
tucky in Lexington, Kentucky, Saturday night 
at 7. The matchup is UF’s first SEC game and 
first true road test of the season.
While many Florida fans may be looking 
for their absolution, the team (2-0) isn’t wor-
ried about exacting payback on the Wildcats 
because of last year’s loss.
“Last year was last year,” defensive coordi-
nator Todd Grantham said. “That doesn’t af-
fect this year.”The sentiment was echoed by running back 
Malik Davis.
“The past is the past,” Davis said. “It’s 
not revenge; we’re treating it like every other 
game.”
Although the Gators are not treating this 
game differently, they will have to overcome 
some added adversity: Two of their most dy-
namic playmakers – defensive back C.J. Hen-
derson and athlete Kadarius Toney – will likely 
miss the game with ankle and shoulder inju-
ries, respectively.
Kentucky (2-0) will have to overcome a cru-
cial injury of its own. Quarterback Terry Wil-
son – who led UK to its first 10-win campaign 
in more than 40 years in 2018 – is out for the

Florida’s soccer team is now 
one game away from getting 
back to .500.
The Gators defeated Florida 
Gulf Coast 4-0 at Donald R. 
Dizney Stadium on Thursday. 
The second home match of the 
season for UF snapped a four-
game losing streak, getting Flor-
ida to 3-4 on the year. 
The last time the Gators lost 
four-straight games was last Sep-
tember when they dropped the 
string of matches by eight com-
bined goals. In the 25th minute, Florida 
midfielder Cassidy Lindley took 
it up the left wing all the way to 
the endline and crossed in a pass 
on the ground to forward Van-
essa Kara. The forward got to it 
before FGCU goalkeeper Melissa 
Weck could, she placed it in the 
back of the net on the far right 
side with the outside of her right 
foot. The goal put Florida on the 
scoresheet 1-0. 
The speed of UF’s wing play-
ers has allowed opportunities to 
play outside-to-inside soccer all 
season; on Thursday those op-
portunities finally mattered. 
“We kind of had a reality check in last game (UCF) losing 
when we thought we should’ve 
won,” Kara said after the game. 
“We thought it came down to 
not even a lack of finishing, but 
a lack of confidence in the box.”
The rest of Florida’s night 
proved the success of that real-
ity check. 
UF struck again not long after. 
Madison Alexander was closer to 
the midfield line than the 18-yard 
box when she rifled a power-
ful shot. The right-footed strike 
loudly struck the right post of 
the goal and bounced back into 
play to find Kara’s feet just out-
side the 6-yard box. Kara cleanly placed it left this time in the back 
of the net for her second goal of 
the contest. 
The 37th minute brought 
more scoring on the orange and 
blue side. Midfielder Parker Rob-
erts chipped a flawless pass to 
the left wing over the head of de-
fender Alison Wessel and to the 
feet of forward Kouri Peace. “I 
think I was just trying to switch 
the field,” Roberts said. “I know 
how fast she is too so I know I 
have a little leeway if it’s not per-
fect.” 
Peace then dusted Wessel 
with a sharp cut from left to right

Matches against No. 1 Stanford and No. 8 
Minnesota were supposed to be good tests for a 
Florida team trying to prove that it belonged in 
the national-title conversation. 
The Gators, however, flunked that test like 
a freshman stumbling into a chemistry exam. 
Stanford came into the O’Connell Center and 
swept the Gators, who followed up the match 
against the Cardinal by getting swept by the 
Golden Gophers. 
Still, coach Mary Wise isn’t concerned about 
her team. At least not yet. 
“We’re doing some good things defensively; 
our serving, like this past weekend, was much 
better, we’re doing some really good things in 
the blocking,” Wise said. “Had we not played the level of competition that we played, we 
might not know those things, as well as the 
benefit of playing those teams.”
The good news for Wise’s squad is that the 
schedule will be much softer this weekend. The 
Gators (2-2) will host three unranked opponents 
at the Honda of Gainesville Gators Invitational: 
USF, James Madison and Long Beach State. 
Here’s what to know about all three teams:
South Florida
Game time: Friday at noon
USF is coming off a 2018 campaign where 
they went 20-12. The Bulls (3-3) won 20 games 
for the first time since 2002 and earned a berth 
in the NIVC, volleyball’s version of the NIT. USF 
was eliminated in the first round, but it was the Gators not after revenge

Staff Report
Can you believe it’s already Week 3?
It seems like just yesterday we were 
heading into Week 0, starved for foot-
ball. Now, the regular season is almost 
a quarter of the way done.
Last week’s games weren’t the most 
eventful — aside from Tennessee losing 
to a Group of Five team at home again, 
of course. 
Meanwhile, Florida earned a 45-0 
win over Tennessee-Martin, and natu-
rally, fans are unhappy. The Gators take 
on Kentucky this week to open SEC play, 
and although Florida’s 31-game winning 
streak over the Wildcats is no more, UK 
still hasn’t beaten UF in Lexington, Ken-
tucky, since 1986.
So, for all intents and purposes, the 
streak is still alive. No pressure, Florida.
Aside from the Gators’ revenge game, 
this week’s lineup features several sto-
rylines.
ACC teams North Carolina and Wake 
Forest play a non-conference game 
against each other Friday night (which 
is weird as hell), Florida State tries to 
avoid complete freefall against Virginia, 
and, most importantly, Florida Atlantic 
(0-2) travels to Muncie, Indiana, to take 
on Ball State (1-1). 
Sports Editor Tyler Nettuno and foot-
ball beat writer Dylan Rudolph debate 
that one below:
FAU will win because…
Three words, seven syllables: Joey 
Freaking Freshwater.
Owls coach Lane Kiffin’s Tuscaloosa 
bar-hound alter ego makes him a pop 
culture icon in his own right, but Kiffin 
also has a trick up his sleeve — he’s ac-
tually a pretty good football coach.
FAU took a step back last season 
after winning 11 games in Kiffin’s first 
year, dropping to 5-7. Still, the Owls re-
turn last year’s starting quarterback in 
redshirt sophomore Chris Robison. He 
was shaky as a freshman, throwing 12 
touchdowns and 12 interceptions. But if 
there’s one thing Kiffin can do, it’s coach 
offense.

first postseason match the program 
has played in since 2002. 
However, the Bulls return just 
eight players from last year’s squad, 
including Gainesville native Jac’cara 
Walker. The 5-foot-9 outside hitter 
registered 394 kills last season, the 
fourth-most in the American Confer-
ence last season. The PK Yonge grad-uate is second on the team in kills this 
year with 22.
James Madison
Game time: Friday at 7 p.m.
The Dukes (3-3) are coming off 
their fourth-straight season with at 
least 20 wins. It's the sixth time they 
have done so in nine seasons under 
head coach Lauren Steinbrecher. 
Despite losing eight players from 
last season’s squad, including six players who played 100 sets last 
season, James Madison topped the 
Colonial Athletic Association’s pre-
season poll. Seniors Sarah Martin and 
M’Kaela White were selected to the 
preseason All-CAA team. 
Martin tallied 145 kills and the 
second-most digs (231) on the Dukes' 
roster last season.
White had the second-most kills 
for JMU last season (308) and had a 
lethal hitting percentage of .356. 
Long Beach State
Game time: Saturday at 5 p.m.Long Beach State women’s vol-
leyball has been much like the profes-
sional football team in the northern 
part of the state: full of history, but 
nothing of note since the 1980s and 
1990s. 
The Beach  (2-4) used to be a legit-
imate power while Brian Gimmillaro 
was the team’s coach, winning three 
national titles between 1989 to 1998. 
But after an appearance in the nation-
al championship match in 2002, the 
LBSU hasn’t advanced past the sec-
ond round of the NCAA tournament. 
Gimmillaro retired after the 2016 season, his 32nd with the team. In his 
place, the school hired Joy McKien-
zie-Fuerbringer, who won a national 
championship as a player at LBSU. 
The Beach went just 10-19 in her 
first season in charge before improv-
ing to 16-13 last season. The team has 
struggled so far this season, though, 
limping into Saturday’s match after 
losses to Texas State and Georgia be-
fore being swept by UCLA.

CROSS COUNTRY
TENNISBy Joseph Salvador
Sports Writer
 
This weekend will mark the 
first and last home meet of the sea-
son for UF’s cross country team. 
The Gators will host the Mountain 
Dew Invitational at Mark Bostick 
Golf Course on Saturday morning. 
where they hope to impress a home 
crowd. More than 30 programs will 
compete against Florida.
Here are some things to keep in 
mind:
 
Complacency is the enemy
There is no question that the 
men’s team was left disappointed 
after its season debut. It fell short 
of expectations after just two 
Gators finished in the top 10, one 
of them being freshman Hugh Brit-
tenham, who finished seventh.
Despite placing in the top 10 in 
his collegiate debut, Brittenham 
was disappointed in himself and 
the team, citing failure to execute 
and even complacency.
“If you start second-guessing yourself or start just getting com-
placent mid-race, you know, 
you’ve just shot off your legs and 
shot off your teammates legs,” Brit-
tenham said.
Assistant coach Chris Solinsky 
wants the men to enter the Moun-
tain Dew Invitational better rested 
and more competitive, even quot-
ing his father, saying “[the] hungry 
dog hunts harder.”
 
Women poised to dominate
Florida senior Jessica Pascoe 
will be making her season debut 
Saturday after skipping the UNF In-
vitational to train. Her participation 
will only help the already impres-
sive squad.
Pascoe has placed in the top five 
in all three of her previous appear-
ances at the Mountain Dew Invita-
tional and will look for the sweep 
in her final season with Florida.
The women’s team has im-
pressed Solinsky, but she wants 
everyone competing to not hold 
anything back.
“I definitely want them to suffer a little bit,” Solinksy said. “[I want 
them to] leave their running on the 
course, not thinking they have a lot 
left.” 
 
Info on the meet
The men will run the 8K at 7:55 
a.m. while the women’s team will 
run the 5K at 8:30 a.m. 
All of Florida’s cross country 
runners are expected to compete. 
However, some runners will be 
racing “unattached,” meaning they 
will not be officially participating in 
the race or wear an official jersey. 
Florida has done this in past Moun-
tain Dew Invitationals in order to 
give everyone the opportunity to 
compete and see where they stand. 
Admission is free, and parking will 
be available at the UF Levin Col-
lege of Law and the Gainesville 
Woman’s Club.

Less than four months after 
its Final Four defeat, Florida's 
men’s tennis team is back in 
action.
UF will start its fall season 
this weekend at the Seahawk 
Fall Invite, hosted by UNC-
Wilmington at Porters Neck 
Country Club in Wilmington, 
North Carolina. 
Friday will feature the dou-
bles quarterfinals, the singles 
round of 16 and quarterfinals. 
Saturday will be the doubles 
and singles semifinals and 
Sunday will cap off the week-
end with the doubles and sin-
gles finals. 
About half of Florida’s 
squad will be playing this 
weekend and the other half 
will be playing in the Houston 
25k at Rice University.
UF looks to use the fall to 
build off its most successful spring season in years. It fin-
ished with its best record in al-
most 20 years at 25-4 and went 
to the Final Four for only the 
third time ever before losing 
to eventual national champion 
Texas.
The Gators return most of 
the same squad from last sea-
son, led by top junior Oliver 
Crawford; rising sophomore 
Sam Riffice (fresh off an ap-
pearance at the Pan-American 
Games in Lima, Peru, over the 
summer); and senior Johannes 
Ingildsen.
 There will be some new 
faces, however. Two of the 
best players in team history, 
McClain Kessler and Alfredo 
Perez, graduated and have 
been replaced by freshmen 
Blaise Bicknell from Miami 
and Will Grant from Orlando. 
Both are five-star blue-chip 
recruits. Bicknell was the No. 
19 recruit out of high school, 
while Grant was the No. 25 prospect.
This will be Florida’s first 
time in the Invite. The Gators 
join host UNC-Wilmington, 
Coastal Carolina, Gardner 
Webb, Georgia Gwinnett, 
UNF, Presbyterian, UNC Ashe-
ville and VCU. Florida’s tough-
est challenge may come from 
Georgia Gwinnett, which won 
the NAIA Championship last 
season.
Coach Bryan Shelton, who 
is entering his eighth season 
at the helm, is just pumped for 
the season to get going.
“Our guys are focused and 
working hard to be ready for 
each opportunity,” he said.

Senior Johannes Ingildsen is expected to lead the men's team this year 
coming off a strong spring showing, going 6-3 in conference singles.  
with the outside of her right foot at the 
top of the 18. She took advantage of the 
favorable angle the move earned her 
and rocked it into the left side of the 
goal, her ﬁ  rst as a Gator, and put UF 
up 3-0. 
   “Kouri’s acceleration is really scary,” 
coach Becky Burleigh said. “You’re left 
with a dilemma as a defender. If you 
step up high, she can get behind you 
and if you give her a little space she 
can run at you, neither of which are 
great options.”The second half possession was 
dominated by the Gators. The Eagles 
were pressing since they were so far 
behind and the focus was gone from 
the FGCU side, as it failed to string 
together any long possessions. The 
Gators not only kept the ball on FG-
CU’s side of the field for most of the 
second half, but they kept it near the 
18.
After seemingly endless threat-
ening chances from Florida in the 
second half, the 71st minute finally 
saw another one get in. Laney Steed 
played a corner kick to the head of Roberts. The midfielder leaped over 
a cluster of players in the 18 and got 
enough power on it to sneak the ball 
past the goalline, increasing UF’s ad-
vantage to four. 
Fourteen minutes later, the final 
whistle blew mercy for the FGCU side 
and the Gators were victorious at 4-0. 
“I think we left some goals off the 
scoresheet that we probably could’ve 
scored,” Burleigh said. “But in terms 
of the quality (of) play overall, it was 
much, much better.”

knee, which he suffered in the third quarter of 
last week’s 38-17 win over Eastern Michigan.
Starting in Wilson’s place will be Sawyer 
Smith. The graduate transfer, a Florida native, 
was 144 for 229 with 1,669 yards, 14 touch-
downs and six interceptions last year in seven 
starts for Troy. He has never started against a 
Power 5 defense.Grantham still isn’t taking Smith lightly.
“He’s a competitor, he knows where to dis-
tribute the ball,” Grantham said. “I fully ex-
pect him to run their offense and do the things 
that they’ve done to win the games they’ve 
won the past two years.”
Kentucky will also have to replace the pro-
duction of Josh Allen and Benny Snell Jr., who 
were both drafted into the NFL, to replicate its 
success against Florida. Snell Jr. ran for 175 
yards against UF last year and Allen registered ﬁ  ve tackles, a sack and a forced fumble.
Expect the Wildcats, who are averaging 
over 200 yards on the ground per game this 
year, to lean even more heavily on running 
backs Kavosiey Smoke and Asim Rose against 
UF because of the inexperience at the quarter-
back position.
Florida quarterback Feleipe Franks will 
have to avoid a repeat of his struggles against 
Kentucky last year for UF to continue its per-
fect start to the season – he was just 17 for 38 
with 232 yards, two touchdowns, an intercep-
tion and a lost fumble in last season’s contest.
This year, Franks won’t have to contest with safety Darius West, who graduated in De-
cember. West was a thorn in Florida’s side last 
year, intercepting a pass and recording eight 
tackles. However, Kentucky returns some 
talent on defense, including linebacker Kash 
Daniel, who racked up 11 tackles last year and 
ﬁ  nished tied for 24th in the SEC with 6.3 tack-
les per game.
“They’re a sound team, they got a pretty 
good defense,” Davis said. “We’re ready.”

cord. FAU’s start has been brutal, as 
it’s been an early season sacriﬁ  cial 
lamb for Ohio State and UCF.
With Muncie’s lame nightlife 
(I’m assuming), Kifﬁ  n will have no 
choice but to spend Friday night 
game-planning. A focused Fresh-
water is basically game over for Ball 
State.
-Tyler Nettuno
Ball State (+2) will win be-
cause…
Ball State has a lot to be conﬁ  -dent about entering this Week 3 
matchup.
Coming off a 57-29 stomping of 
Fordham, the Cardinals are on the 
verge of prominence with their high-
ﬂ  ying offense headed by redshirt 
junior quarterback Drew Plitt, who 
has amassed 737 passing yards and 
eight touchdowns in his ﬁ  rst two 
games of the season.
The Cardinals’ top receiver, red-
shirt senior Riley Miller, has grabbed 
11 balls in the same span for 167 
yards and two touchdowns. Miller 
totaled 878 yards last year and is ex-
pected to cross the 1,000-yard mark 
in his ﬁ  nal year with the team.
Ball State matches up well with FAU, which has allowed a combined 
1,043 total yards and 93 points in its 
ﬁ  rst two contests and has a 2-4 re-
cord in its last six non-conference 
games.
The Cardinals proved they don’t 
balk at tough competition when they 
impressed against Big 10 opponent 
Indiana in Week 1, coming just two 
yards short of eclipsing 400 yards 
of total offense in the unexpectedly 
close game. If Ball State continues 
its laudable play, it should keep 
FAU and head coach Joey Freshwa-
ter Lane Kifﬁ  n winless after three 
games.
-Dylan RudolphAnd now onto the picks...
Three pickers top our standings 
at 12-4. First up is Tyler “I Set A 
Bad Precedent” Nettuno, who was 
late to the new hires meeting that 
he — oh wait for it — set up. Yes, I 
know it’s shocking for our leader to 
set such a bad example for the young 
and eager copy editors we hired this 
week. I mean, come on Tyler. You 
set the time for 5:45 p.m. and both 
of the new hires were able to make 
their way inside our tight-security 
building (without a keycard) before 
you waltzed in at 5:51 p.m. I know 
your iPhone X has a clock on its 
screen, Tyler. Maybe you should use 
it, sometime. Also in the lead is Mark “Throws 
Shade At Team USA” Long, who 
tweeted that USA Basketball team 
“will get a participation ribbon” af-
ter playing Poland in the seventh-
place game at the FIBA World Cup. I 
know its showing at the World Cup 
has been pretty embarrassing so far, 
but come on, Mark. There are no su-
perstars playing. Did you really ex-
pect Brook Lopez to lead this team 
to a title?
