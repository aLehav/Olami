About one in eight women 
over the age of 18 binge drink.
The Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention re-
leased a statement Tuesday that stated excessive drinking is a dangerous behavior that is under-recognized as a women’s health issue.
Joan Scully , a substance 
abuse coordinator and licensed clinical social worker at UF Counseling and Wellness Cen-ter, said the ﬁ  rst step to recog-nizing binge drinking as an ill-ness is to lower the stigma that comes with addiction.
For the 14 million American 
women who binge drink, the chances of breast cancer, heart disease, sexually transmitted diseases and unintended preg-nancy are heightened, accord-ing to the center.“You can’t ﬁ  nd that label on 
a bottle of vodka or a bottle of wine,” Scully said.
She said binge drinking 
needs the same level of social awareness that cigarette smok-ing has.
Despite these risks, women 
who binge consume six drinks in one sitting and drink three or more times a month.
Although males have histor-
ically been more involved with high-risk drinking, women are catching up, said GatorWell Health Promotion Services di-rector Maureen Miller, who also specializes in  alcohol and other drug prevention.
Miller said it’s important 
to use common sense when drinking.
“Be aware of how much you 
are actually drinking based on alcohol content, not number of drinks,” she said. “You are probably having more than what you really think.”
Carolina Garcia, a 20-year-
old public relations junior, said she worries when she sees peo-ple overindulging
“I think it should deﬁ  nitely 
be made known,” she said. “People don’t see it as anything except socializing.”

Shawna Clark’s hair was tied 
back on Tuesday. She wore denim 
shorts and an orange Gators T-shirt. Small beads of sweat slid down her forehead.
It was 77 degrees Fahrenheit.”It’s not as cute as wearing win-
ter clothes,” said the 19-year-old applied physiology and kinesiol-ogy sophomore. “But I guess I’d rather be warm than freezing.”
According to the National Cli-
matic Data Center, last year was the hottest on record.
The average temperature of 
2012 was 55.3 degrees Fahrenheit — 3.2 degrees above last century’s average and one degree higher than 1998, the hottest previously recorded year.
WRUF Chief Meteorologist 
Jeff Huffman 
said although it was the hottest year nationwide, rainfall — which was above nor-mal for the year — was the big-ger factor within 
Gainesville.
He attributed the higher rain-fall to tropical storms Beryl and Debby and said the extra precipi-tation followed a two-year area drought.
Though Huffman said the cur-
rent weather in Alachua County is unusual for the season, he warned it may change soon.
“The coldest nights of the win-
ter could still be ahead of us,” he said.
Roxanne Connelly, an associate 
professor of medical entomology, said the higher temperatures have had an effect on the local mosqui-to population, which breeds in the heat.
She said summer is the peak 
season for mosquitoes, and tem-perature drops during winter nor-mally knock out most of the North Central Florida population.
“Typically, in winter months 
and even early spring, the activity you’re seeing in Alachua County would be much more reduced if temperatures were lower,” she said.

NEWBERRY — Rows of ofﬁ  cers 
in forest green, black and brown 
uniforms stood at attention near the entrance of the Canterbury Showplace, their faces somber as the gray sky.
A hum of mufﬂ  ed voices ﬁ  lled 
the covered arena —  the sounds of those waiting to say their last goodbyes.
Two ofﬁ  cers on white horses 
led a black hearse as it backed into the arena. Uniformed law enforce-ment ofﬁ  cers saluted their friend, their co-worker, their brother, in his casket.
Jean-Guy Deffense, who had  
served with the University Police since 2008, died in a car accident Friday afternoon in Orlando.
Deffense, 43, and his wife, Mar-cia Wolf, 45, were headed west-bound on State Road 408 when Deffense drove around a curve, lost control of his 2008 Dodge Ram 1500 and veered into a grass shoul-der. Wolf was unharmed.
During the memorial service 
Wednesday, dozens of family members, co-workers and acquain-tances praised Deffense for his pa-triotism, dedication and strength.

 �UF IS NOT 
IMPLEMENTING THE CONCEPT.
RACHEL KURLAND
Alligator Contributing Writer
Housing at two universities 
are getting an upgrade with a 
twist.
Texas A&M University- 
Kingsville and Florida Insti-tute of Technology will add residence halls geared toward Catholic students on their re-spective campuses in the Fall.
The Newman Student 
Housing Fund, which is sepa-rate from FIT, is financially supporting the Mary Star of the Sea Catholic Student Resi-dence at the Florida school, ac-cording to a press release.
The fund’s goal is to pro-
vide housing arrangements that deepen students’ faith on a secular campus, according to its website.
The new FIT residence halls 
will house 140 students and will eventually be accompa-nied by a chapel.
Though this concept is not 
being implemented at UF, Sha-ron Blansett, assistant to the associate vice president for Student Affairs and UF Hous-ing spokeswoman, wrote in an email that the UF Department of Housing and Residence Ed-ucation “supports all students in seeking spiritual well-being, health and balance, and sup-ports all religions and faiths.”Blansett also wrote that UF 
housing is open to exploring special interests for all stu-dents.
“When developing special 
interest housing for college-age students, it is important to be inclusive rather than exclu-sive,” she wrote.
Blansett said faith-based 
housing has the potential to benefit university communi-ties and its students if both support the idea.
Abigail Nabors, a 20-year-
old biomedical engineering junior, said public universities should remain secular so there is no conflict with certain stu-dents or groups not being ac-knowledged.
“Finding sufficient on-cam-
pus housing is already diffi-cult,” she said.
UF student Marielle Mo-
lina said the idea of Catholic residence halls seems unfair to other religions. 
The 19-year-old biology 
sophomore said the idea is strange to her, although she was raised Catholic. Dorms should remain secular, she said. 
Molina said some religious 
students may force their views onto others and may be judg-mental toward other religions or lifestyles.
Molina said students would 
have to question that living situation and whether they would fit into that community.
“Are you Catholic enough 
to be here?” she said.Florida university to

Deffense wore all uniforms with pride
They described him as a man 
who could overcome challenges, 
and to one officer, Deffense was “the toughest guy I ever met.”
Family members said he was 
a man who held himself to a high standard. As a young man, Def-fense worked at McDonald’s, and when he dressed for work, he took pride in his uniform: shined shoes and pressed pants.
“No one looked better at that 
McDonald’s than Jean-Guy,” a family member said.
His friends reminisced about 
how Deffense once got his hands on a Boy Scouts uniform, even though he wasn’t one.
He later became a member 
of the JROTC at his high school, 
where he wore 
his uniform  even on prom night.
D e f f e n s e 
served as a Unit-ed States Army military police officer and was involved in Op-eration Desert 
Storm and Operation Iraqi Free-dom.
Jonathon Defino, who led the 
memorial, spent 18 months de-ployed with Deffense.“Even in the desert his uniform 
was spotless,” he said.
Defino also described Deffense 
as a friend who had a “coolness factor about him: slow to speak, fast to listen.”
Once the service ended, mourn-
ers moved to say their final good-byes at West Hills Memorial Gar -
dens in Jonesville.
 There, after a three-volley salute 
and “Taps” trumpet call, Deffense was lowered into the ground. 
“If Jean-Guy could come back, 
I believe he would say, ‘Our lives are short. We need to enjoy it, prepared for what’s next,” Defino said.

A Gainesville man who shot a gun at a group of peo-
ple outside the Butler Plaza movie theater turned him-
self in Wednesday afternoon.
Gainesville Police arrested Zairon Jarquis Fussell, 
19, on attempted murder and possession of a weapon by a convicted felon, according to GPD. Fussell turned himself in after police called and spoke with him on his cellphone, GPD spokesman Ben Tobias said.
Police had been searching for Fussell since he fled the 
scene Monday morning. Police already arrested another suspect involved, Robert Nathaniel Morris, 19, on four counts of attempted murder and one count of conspir -
acy.Fussell and Morris got into an argument with a group 
of four friends before a movie at the Regal Stadium 14, located on the 3100 block of Southwest 35th Boulevard, 
according to a GPD police report. Af-ter the movie ended, the argument continued in the parking lot. Fussell pulled out a handgun and fired a sin-gle shot at the group, according to the report. No one was hurt.
Fussell was booked into the Ala-
chua County Jail, where he remained Wednesday night with a $1,015,000 bond.
  “That’s good that his a-- got caught,” said victim 
Brandon Richardson.

WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

As an international airline pi-
lot, Pamela Mincey has witnessed 
the effects of climate change. She saw a biomass plant slated to open this summer eight miles north of Gainesville as a step in the right di-rection.
At a Gainesville City Commission 
workshop Wednesday , a divided group of about 70 people discussed their concerns about the plant.
The workshop was held as part of a lawsuit settlement between the commission and response group Gainesville Citizens Care Inc.
Ray Washington, a local at-
torney , gave a presentation about what he called the “public process” flaws in the commission’s handling of the plant’s contract. He said de-tails of the contract were kept hid-den through redactions to protect Gainesville Renewable Energy Cen-ter from competitors.
“The commission would not lis-
ten. It became comical,” Washington said.
Gainesville Regional Utilities 
signed a power purchasing agree-ment in 2009 to purchase all energy produced by the plant.GRU general manager Robert 
Hunzinger said the company has had no success finding other entities to purchase some of the energy from the city.
Biomass plants use wood to cre-
ate energy with less pollution than fossil fuels while helping to provide communities with energy security and diversity , said GREC President Jim Gordon.
Hunzinger estimated the total 
value of the plant plus fuel costs at about $3 billion in the 30-year con-tract.
Gordon said investing into the 
plant will help Gainesville and the surrounding communities, creating jobs and providing tax revenue.

Gainesville Commissioner 
Randy Wells will run for re-
election after he submitted paperwork Monday to the Alachua County Supervisor of Elections.
Wells is the third candidate 
in the District 4 city commis-sion election, which is set for March. He will run against W.E. “Mac” McEachern and Alfredo Espinosa for the position.
District 4 consists of the east-
ern part of UF’s campus, as well as areas north of West Univer -
sity Avenue.
Wells previously won the 
commission seat in 2010 when he beat Penny Wheat, a former Alachua County commissioner, in a runoff election.
During his first term, Wells 
worked to improve city code enforcement and promote small businesses throughout Gainesville, according to his campaign press release. He is also chair of the Equal Oppor -
tunity Committee.  
For his 2013 campaign, Wells 
said he would work to improve the relationship between the city and small businesses.
“When local government 
can develop relationships with local business and community groups, we find unique oppor -
tunities to better our city and the lives of our residents,” he said in a statement.
McEachern, a former city 
commissioner, announced his candidacy Thursday , according to the Supervisor of Elections’ website.
McEachern said he wants 
to bridge the gap between resi-dents and the city.
“There has been a discon-
nection with citizens and the city commission, and I want to address that,” he said.
Espinosa could not be 
reached for comment.

Cathedral catharsis: 
Victory in marriage 
equality
Who says you can’t teach an old church new tricks?
The Washington National Cathedral announced 
Wednesday that it would begin to host same-sex mar -
riages.
“The cathedral’s congregation and leadership include many 
gays and lesbians,” stated an article by The Associated Press. 
“The church was just waiting for the right moment and the right leader.”
This is pretty exciting.Don’t forget to continue to be excited by news such as this. 
Every once in a while, some positive news for the LGBT commu-nity is announced, but we should continue to make a “big deal” out of every step in the right direction. It’s like when a parent has to be enthusiastic for each new piece of “art” their toddler makes them. You have to keep giving positive reinforcement with an excited face and a compliment.
“For more than 30 years, the Episcopal Church has prayed 
and studied to discern the evidence of God’s blessing in the lives of same-sex couples,” the Rev. Gary Hall of the National Cathe-dral said in an article by ABC News. “We enthusiastically affirm each person as a beloved child of God — and doing so means including the full participation of gays and lesbians in the life of this spiritual home for the nation.”
“As a kind of tall-steeple, public church in the nation’s capi-
tal, by saying we’re going to bless same-sex marriages, conduct same-sex marriages, we are really trying to take the next step for marriage equality in the nation and in the culture,” Hall said in the AP article.
This decision sets an amazing example for the rest of the 
country — especially as it is taking place in our nation’s capital.
We don’t fully understand people who don’t agree with 
equality at this point in our nation’s history. You can’t continue to put people down or discriminate against them because they are different than you.
That’s not how it works. And no, we’re not going to delve 
into the religious facet of the marriage equality argument, be-cause there’s no need to bring extra stress into this.
“I consider it a great honor to lead this Cathedral as it takes 
another historic step toward greater equality — and I am pleased that this step follows the results made clear in this past Novem-ber’s election, when three states voted to allow same-sex mar -
riage,” Hall said, according to ABC News.
Good for you, dude. There is nothing more admirable than 
standing up for what you truly believe in despite what adversity you might face.
Let’s all try to be so brave.“I read the Bible as seriously as fundamentalists do,” Hall 
said to the AP . “And my reading of the Bible leads me to want to do this because I think it’s being faithful to the kind of com-munity that Jesus would have us be.”
It’s incredibly inspiring to see an era of change attempt to 
sweep its way across our nation. 
Don’t be a stick in the mud, because it’s way more fun to just 
jump in and enjoy yourself.Kanye and Kim’s baby: What to expect
Kim Kardashian, living brand and professional Beyon-cé wannabe, made headlines Dec. 30 when her beau Kanye West announced her pregnancy at a concert in 
Atlantic City . 
According to “Entertainment Tonight,” West sang, “Now 
you having my baby,” and urged the crowd to congratulate his “baby mom.” 
In an interview on Jan. 1, “Entertainment Tonight” asked 
Kardashian about the pregnancy . Has she encountered morning sickness? Cravings?
“I wouldn’t say it’s been easy,” Kardashian, 32, said. 
“When people say pregnancy is, like, fun and they love it, I would have to disagree.” 
Kardashian is right on with this one, you guys. She’s jug-
gling an unresolved divorce, a Sears’ fashion line, the gar -
gantuan ego of Kanye and the everyday stress of fitting all your Kardashian k-thoughts into a 140-character tweet. The same pregnancy guidelines hawked by the now-outdated “What to Expect When You’re Expecting” don’t quite fit.
In lieu of a baby-shower gift, because my budget won’t 
allow for any pieces from the Baby Dior at Bergdorf Good-man collection, I offer to you, Kim Kardashian, a brief and accessible overview of pregnancy.
First, you may have questions about the inevitable chang-
es to your body. You may be thinking, “Should I start sew-ing elastic waistbands into my J Brand jeans? Is it still OK to wear peplum dresses? Will extended wear of Alexander McQueen armadillo heels damage the fetus? Are muumuus really a thing? What’s a cervix?”
Well, there’s no way to dance around it: Your standard 
diet of D-A-S-H water bottles, edamame and sugarless gum will no longer suffice. Remember, there’s a miniature Kanye growing inside that bandage-dress-wrapped belly.
The sculpted hourglass figure you’re paid to maintain 
will soon resemble a lumpy potato — embrace it! For the next nine months, look forward to a break from running on the gi-ant hamster wheel that powers the Kris Jenner Empire.
And who knows — maybe a Kardashian maternity line 
(with possible Jessica Simpson collaboration?) is the perfect opportunity to jump from Sears to the more versatile, lucra-tive Target.
In addition, you’re probably 
wondering about matters of ex-ercise, diet and sexual activity. “What about juice cleanses? Will my Bikram yoga practice give my baby a lopsided head? Will my changing body affect my duties as Kanye’s personal Barbie/manne-quin? Why am I craving bananas 
with Tabasco sauce?”
Unfortunately, a hiatus from rigorous activity is what 
your baby needs. According to “Entertainment Tonight,” you are 12 weeks pregnant, and according to TheBump.com,  your fetus is the size of a plum. I shudder to think how that plum would look after a session of Kim Kardashian Fit Into Your Jeans by Friday workout session. Be kind to that plum.
And whatever you do, pay no attention to Gwyneth Pal-
trow and her Goop maternity website. This same woman named her children Apple and Moses and tried to launch a country-music career. In her Goop article, she suggests her favorite brand of $148 faux-leather leggings. Paltrow is ri-diculous. Do not ever listen to Paltrow.
Above all, Kim K, I wish you the best of luck. Remember, nobody is judging you for having a baby . 
They’re judging you because Kanye announced it in song in front of an audience, your divorce to Kris Humphries hasn’t been consolidated and, according to the “New York Daily News,” your mother is already collecting bids from celebrity magazines for photos of your baby bump and eventual in-fant. 
Oh, and you once said in an interview with “The Guard-
ian” on your pending divorce, “Like, I spoke to a girl today who had cancer and we were talking about how this is such a hard thing for her, but it taught her a big lesson on who her friends are and so much about life . . . and I was like, that’s how I feel.”

Punk rock legend Hot Water Mu-
sic has remained an integral part of 
Gainesville’s musical DNA since its inception nearly two decades ago.
With its ﬁ  rst studio album re-
lease in eight years, the band will return to its old stomping grounds at Element Nite Club, formerly the Florida Theater, on Jan. 18 at 8 p.m., with openers The Menzingers and La Dispute.
This show marks the third stop 
on the quartet’s tour, following the release of “Exister,” in May.
Singer and guitarist Chris Wol-
lard said that after six months of opening gigs and festivals, a head-lining run gives the band more cre-ative freedom.
“It was really important not only 
to play in the South, but we really wanted to start the tour here in Flor-ida,” he said.
Headlining the tour also gives 
the band greater ﬂ  exibility when it comes to preparing the set list, in-cluding new material, Hot Water Music classics and the possibility of playing songs they haven’t played in several years.
Wollard described the recording 
process as easier than past records, in which the band toured for 200 days and went straight into writ-ing and recording on a regimented three-month schedule.
“We just eased ourselves back 
into the groove,” Wollard said. “The more we did, the more we were en-joying it. It didn’t seem like some-thing we had to do — it seemed like something we wanted to do.”
Living in Gainesville for many 
years, Wollard, 37, is no stranger to the local music scene.
“I’ve been around the world, and 
I still love it here,” he said. “I still love the community . I love that No Idea is still putting out records and supporting the scene. There are still people doing local shows. It’s the thing that keeps me here.”
The band will release “Live in 
Chicago,” a triple LP/double CD and DVD, Tuesday . The album documents the band’s performance at the Metro in Chicago on Feb. 1 to 2, 2008.
Tickets for the show are avail-
able for $17 at www.ticketweb.com. Tickets can also be purchased at Hear Again Music and Movies, and Arrow’s Aim Records.THURSDAY, JANUARY 10, 2013

Gainesville punk rockers Hot Water Music will be playing a hometown show at Element Nite Club, for-

If working on your physique found its way to 
the top of your resolution list, trade crowded cam-
pus gyms for adventure by considering local alter-natives.
From rock climbing to running for beer, begin-
ners and gym junkies alike can ditch boring, solo workouts for good by taking advantage of social ﬁ  tness programs.
CrossFit: A rigorous training program that 
pushes participants to complete rounds of activi-ties ranging from ﬂ  ipping tires to Olympic lifting, CrossFit has developed a loyal following of people looking for a challenge.
Classes follow a national Workout of the Day 
schedule and are taught in a group setting, in which each member tries to beat their personal record.
For those who want a test run, both CrossFit 
Gainesville and Gator CrossFit offer free introduc-tory courses.
Mixed Martial Arts: Cages and graphic T-shirts 
aside, MMA and jiu-jitsu training offer cardio con-ditioning and can come in handy if you ever get in a tough situation. Capoeira, a Brazilian dance-style martial art, is also an alternative for gaining strength and ﬂ  exibility.
F2 Arena and Global Mixed Martial Arts Acad-
emy both offer classes ranging from introductory to competition ﬁ  ghter training.
Rock Climbing: Boulder climb to a more sculpt-
ed upper body at Gainesville Rock Gym. With 8,500 square feet of vertical climbing space and a separate cave and tunnel system, there’s plenty of room to spread out and meet other climbers.
Never tried scaling a 36-foot 
cliff before? Classes are available to teach climbing basics like be-
laying and lead climbing.
Beer Run Club: A self-proclaimed drinking 
club with a running problem, the Gainesville Area Thirsty Runners practice the tradition of “hashing,” a hare-and-hound-style run that ends with a cel-ebratory beer social at a local bar.
Before each run, a preselected “hare” lays a 2- 
to 5-mile trail for the rest of the group to follow as “hounds,” with signals and dead ends along the way.

meeting next, or to learn more and start a hash group of your own, visit gatrh3.wordpress.com.Resolutioners: Ditch routine

Doritos Locos Taco lovers may 
have a hard time sticking to their 
New Year’s resolutions this year.
On Jan. 2, Taco Bell tweeted a 
picture of a taco next to a bag of Doritos Cool Ranch chips with the caption, “Anything could happen in #2013.”
It posted the same photo on Fa-
cebook. As of Wednesday night, the photo had about 132,700 likes.
After the tweet, Twitter was 
abuzz with replies such as, “SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!” and “STOP PLAYING WITH MY HEART, @TacoBell! EITHER COM-MIT OR DON’T.”
John Michael Yakulevich, a 20-year-old industrial and systems engineering junior, said, as a col-lege student, he frequently visits Taco Bell and loves the Doritos Lo-cos Taco.
“I’m stoked,” he said. “I love 
Cool Ranch Doritos. I love Taco Bell tacos. I can’t wait to experience the combination.”
Taco Bell released the nacho-
cheese-ﬂ  avored Doritos Locos Taco last March.
According to Taco Bell, the Dor-
itos Locos Taco launch was the most successful in the company’s 50-year history.
Yakulevich said he thinks the 
Cool Ranch taco would sell just as well in the beginning, but he thinks it may not have the lasting power that the original has.
He said although cheese and ta-
cos go well together, ranch is some-thing he has “never been tempted to drizzle across the top of my taco.”
“I’m still excited, though,” he 
said. “It will deﬁ  nitely be a cool twist to the Doritos Locos.”Taco Bell teases fans

Lost in an endlessly growing queue and buried underneath thou-
sands of rows of titles, there are these few hidden gems of Netflix.
“2 Days in New York” (2012)
Rated R, 96 minutes
How we act around our family is not always how we act with our 
friends, co-workers or even our special someone.  
There is a certain rhythm established with family that makes it 
difficult to fit in any newcomers. This is where the heart of Julie 
Delpy’s “2 Days in New York” lies.
Marion (played by Delpy) is a French photographer in New York 
City. She has a 3-year-old son and lives with her 
boyfriend, Mingus (Chris Rock) and his daughter.Marion’s eccentric family will be visiting New York for the weekend to tour the Big Apple. 
Her family brings out a side of Marion that 
Mingus is completely unfamiliar with, challenging what he had originally thought of her.
“2 Days in New York” has a quick and crass 
sense of humor that is punctuated with philosophic 
questions on life and love. 
At times, these jumps feel a little rushed, but that isn’t a deal 
breaker.
Possibly the best note of the film is Rock’s performance as Min-
gus. He is always funny and even a little intimidating during the more tense scenes of the movie.
Hidden Gem you’ve already seen: A bunch of Disney movies
During the break, Netflix acquired the rights to stream many Dis-
ney movies including “Aristocats,” “Pocahontas,” “Dumbo,” “The Fox and the Hound” and many other bits and pieces of your child-hood. 
Pixar movies, however, will not be on Netflix for some time.Hidden Gems of Netflix:

It’s that time of year again — Twitter feeds 
and gossip sites are abuzz with speculation. 
It’s award show season, and all eyes are on Hollywood’s finest. January kicks off a jam-packed period of glamorous gowns, surprises and snubs, and even the occasional wardrobe malfunction.
What (And Who) To Watch:
Every year, I divide the numerous nomina-
tions into three categories (known affection-
ately as “the trophy three”): favorites, under -
dogs and “that got nominated?!”This year, all three groups are full force in 
their selections. 
Favorites: “Argo,” “Zero Dark Thirty,” 
“Lincoln.”
These three are your typical awards season 
darlings, ranging in their patriotic-centered dramatic forte from finding Osama Bin Laden (“Zero Dark Thirty”), to depicting one of the nation’s most famous figures (“Lincoln”). Plus, all three have leading actors who are no strangers to the Academy and its precursors.
Underdogs: “Django Unchained,” “Silver 
Linings Playbook.”
These films are the ones being hyped by 
both critics and crowds. Both “Django,” the lat-est from Quentin Tarantino, and “Playbook,” a film-festival feature, have stark performances from stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence that have had everyone talking.
“That Got Nominated?!”: “Salmon Fish-
ing In The Yemen,” “Hotel Transylvania.”
This year more than 
any , the animated features seemed to be lacking. Less-than-stellar flicks, includ-ing Adam Sandler’s “Hotel 
Transylvania,” scored some nods. As for “Salmon Fish-ing in The Yemen,” to me, it 
appears this is a filler nomination among the other more-notable features.How to catch up:
• Check out the cinema:There is no better prep for awards season 
than sitting down with a bucket of popcorn and watching the nominees themselves. Both of Gainesville’s Regal Cinemas and the Hippo-drome have nominated flicks on the marquee.
• Read the blogs (all of them):If you want all-around coverage, blogs are 
the best places to read up on it all. From the LA Times’ “The Envelope” to your average movie fan’s personal place, there are lots of picks and predictions for your online reading pleasure.
• T une in:The Golden Globes are on Sunday at 8 p.m. 
on NBC.

After a disappointing loss against the University of Louis-
ville in the Sugar Bowl, the Gators football team has traded in 
its gameday uniform for practice jerseys this semester.  
So, what is there to do in Gainesville now that football sea-
son has come and gone? There might be more than you think.
Basketball is the sport of choice for students during Spring. Currently ranked 11th in the country, the Gators men’s bas-
ketball team has been predicted to be a nation-al threat this season.
A major perk for students is that the games 
are free when you register for them at www.gatorzone.com.
As the weather warms up, it becomes the 
perfect time to head out to Ginnie Springs, Paynes Prairie or Lake Wauburg. All three lo-
cations offer scenic views, hiking and a great way to explore the nature of Gainesville.
“Gainesville has so much to offer when it comes to doing 
stuff outside,”  said Patrick Wang, a 23-year-old UF engi-neering senior. “Floating down Ginnie Springs and canoeing at Wauburg are some of my favorite ways to relax with my friends on a beautiful day.”
Spring Break will come and go before you know it, and 
then, graduation will whisk away another class of seniors into the real world. 
Plays, speeches, museum events and concerts — whatever 
you do this semester, remember: There are plenty of things to keep yourself busy, even if football season is over.After football season:

Morgan Frazier has impressed coach Rhonda Faehn early. See story, page 16.Perfect attendance
Student attendance for Florida’s 77-44 win against Georgia on Wednesday night was 3,200, the highest turnout in seven years.LANDON WATNICK
Alligator Writer
Forward Erik Murphy fractured 
one of his ribs when he absorbed 
contact from a teammate during Friday’s practice. 
Murphy missed Sunday’s game 
against Yale, and coach Billy Dono-van listed the senior as “doubtful” on Monday.
Still, Murphy dove for balls and 
drew charges Wednesday night. 
In 18 minutes off the bench, 
Murphy scored 11 points as No. 11 Florida (11-2, 1-0 Southeastern Con-ference) opened its SEC slate with a 77-44 victory against Georgia in the O’Connell Center.
“(With) a broken rib and him 
trying to breathe and run and be a frontcourt player and take on the amount of contact he takes on, it’s a painful experience on a daily basis,” Donovan said. “I give him a lot of credit.”
Murphy made 4 of 9 field goal 
attempts, including 3-of-6 shoot-ing from behind the arc. He scored eight points in the first half. 
Despite hustling through pain, 
Murphy was critical of his perfor-mance. 
“I wouldn’t say I played that 
well,” he said. “I have to rebound better.”Murphy first felt discomfort in 
his ribs against Air Force on Dec. 29 but fractured one of his ribs Friday. He missed practice Monday but re-turned Tuesday. 
Murphy wore a pad wrapped 
over the fractured rib Wednesday night. 
“[Athletic trainer Dave Werner] 
is the best in the business, so I just trusted him,” Murphy said. “He’ll always nurse me back to health. … [Werner] made a little contraption, so when I get hit, it doesn’t hurt that bad.”
Redshirt senior guard Mike Ro-
sario scored a team-high 19 points on 6-of-10 shooting, while junior forward Casey Prather notched 10 points on 5-of-7 shooting and grabbed seven boards.  
Prather started ahead of Murphy 
and junior forward Will Yeguete, who is dealing with tendinitis in his right knee. Yeguete, who averaged 24.8 
minutes per game before Wednes-day, went scoreless in 14. 
“This has been going on for a 
couple of weeks here. It just got pro-gressively worse,” Donovan said.
“After the Yale game, it really, 
really bothered him, and he tried to practice on Monday and couldn’t go, then tried to go again [Tuesday] and couldn’t go. … This is going to be kind of an ongoing thing with him for a little while until we can kind of get it calmed down.”
In his third career start and first 
since Feb. 24, 2011, Prather set the tone early for the Gators. 
During Florida’s 11-0 run in the 
first five minutes, Prather scored the game’s first six points and notched two steals, including one  in the full-court press. 
“It was just a good feeling be-
cause the crowd was into it, my teammates jumping around,” Prather said. “It was a great energy boost for our team.”
Florida had runs of 8-0 in the first 
half and 9-0 in the second period. 
The Gators held Bulldogs guard 
Kentavious Caldwell-Pope to 11 points on 4-of-10 shooting.
The 6-foot-5 sophomore entered 
the game averaging 17.5 points, 7.2 rebounds and 2.3 steals per game. No other Georgia player scored more than six points.

BASEBALL
ADAM PINCUS
Alligator Staff Writer
After losing nine players to the MLB 
draft, UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan can add 
Tyler Thompson to the list of players the Gators must replace this season. 
The redshirt senior decided to leave the 
team, creating a void in center field.He is expected to grad-
uate in May, according to a UF release.
Thompson suffered 
a right ACL tear during Florida’s Southeastern 
Conference opener against Vanderbilt on March 18. The injury occurred when Thompson rounded first base after reaching on a dropped third strike in the eighth in-ning.
The NCAA granted Thompson a sixth 
year of eligibility in June.
Thompson finishes his Florida career 
with a .280 average, 10 home runs and 64 RBIs. He made 90 career starts, including 80 in either left field or center field.Defensively, Thompson committed just 
one error in 183 chances.
Postseason play brought out Thompson’s 
best at the plate. He hit .339 in 23 NCAA Tournament games. He earned NCAA Gainesville Regional All-Tournament hon-ors during his sophomore and junior sea-sons.
Senior will not return to team despite earning medical redshirt
PHILLIP HEILMAN
Alligator Staff Writer 
Florida netted its first Southeast-
ern Conference win of the season 
with a 77-72 victory against LSU on Sunday , but the Gators suffered a troubling loss during the game.
Senior forward Jennifer George is questionable for tonight’s game at 8 against Mississippi State after suffering a dislocated shoulder in the second half against LSU. George has been considered day-to-day this week and will be evaluated prior to the game. 
“My range of motion really de-cides what I can do,” G e o r g e said. “If I’m not 
able to be 100 percent, I will save it for Tennessee on Sunday .” 
If George is unavailable, the Gators will have just eight active players against the Bulldogs. 
Florida has been without Chan-
dler Cooper since she suffered a left foot injury on Nov . 15 in a 98-67 loss to Florida State. Viktorija Dimaite, a player coach Amanda Butler hoped would provide another option on the low-block, suffered a torn ACL before the season in practice on Nov. 3. 
“We’ve faced a lot of adversity 
this year,” redshirt freshman Carlie Needles said. “Losing George is ob-viously [big], but losing Chandler, 
Leading scorer, rebounder questionable to play tonight

Senior forward Jennifer George dribbles in the lane during Florida’s 
77-72 win against LSU on Sunday in the O’Connell Center.Thompson suffered 
torn ACL on March 18
Thompson scored the only run 
in Florida’s 2-1 loss to South Caro-
lina in Game 1 of the College World Series Finals in 2011.
Thompson struggled to stay 
healthy throughout his career, suf-fering knee, back, hamstring, hand and wrist injuries. Before last sea-son, O’Sullivan was optimistic that Thompson’s injury issues were be-hind him.
“We are hoping we are able 
to keep him healthy,” O’Sullivan said during fall practice in 2011. “I know he is, too. He has had some string of bad luck. Hopefully, he is beyond that. He is a very capable defender, and he has worked aw-fully hard on his arm. I am just ex-cited to see him go a full year injury free.”Thompson’s season ended when 
he suffered the ACL tear on March 18. Florida went 13-1 in Thomp-son’s 14 starts last season.
With former UF outfielder Dan-

George suffered the injury with 
5:06 remaining in the second half on Sunday. She got tangled defend-ing LSU’s Adrienne Webb and fell awkwardly on her right shoulder.
Florida’s medical staff assisted 
George off the court and popped her shoulder back into place in the locker room. George watched the duration of the second half from the bench with her right arm in a sling and her shoulder heavily wrapped. 
George leads the Gators with 
14.6 points, 9.3 rebounds and 2.5 steals per game. George is also the SEC’s active leader in career double-doubles with 26, seven of which have come this season. 
Florida (12-4, 1-1 SEC) will be 
challenged to stop Mississippi State (8-7, 0-2 SEC) without George. The Bulldogs are led by 6-foot-4 sopho-more Martha Alwal, who averages 11.6 points and 9.4 rebounds per game. 
Redshirt sophomore Kayla Lew-
is acknowledged the Gators would be undermanned without George but said fighting through adver -
sity has become one of the team’s strengths the past two seasons. 
“Our coaches have done a great 
job of letting us know that adver -
sity was going to come even before we had it,” Lewis said. “You’ve just got to be resilient. That’s what defines a great team, is being resil-ient.” 
Florida posted a season-opening 
71-49 victory against Fairfield on Nov. 9, a game George missed due to personal reasons. Lewis scored 12 points and pulled down seven rebounds.
Butler said the Gators will need 
to bring that type of intensity into Starkville, Miss., particularly if George’s balky shoulder causes her to miss the game. 
“It’s just an unfortunate part of 
our game,” Butler said. “It’s not something that affects our expecta-tion. It doesn’t affect our momen-tum or our mood. I think our team understands that.”

Last week’s opening meet 
against Ball State gave coach Rhon-
da Faehn the chance to evaluate Bridget Sloan’s collegiate debut. 
With Florida traveling to No. 8 
LSU on Friday for its first road meet of the season, Faehn may have the chance to see how another fresh-man, Morgan Frazier, performs in competition after a few weeks of training.  
“She is definitely pushing her -
self, and I would love to see her get out there because she can certainly bring depth to this team on three events,” coach Rhonda Faehn said. 
Frazier is one of three gymnasts 
who signed a national letter of in-tent with Florida in November, along with teammates Silvia Colus-si-Perez and Claire Boyce. 
Frazier, from Orlando Metro’s 
club team, won 2012 Florida Level 10 titles for all-around, vault and balance beam.She enrolled at UF this spring, 
marking the fourth consecutive season a gymnast joined the team midyear. 
While confident Frazier will pro-
vide depth in many events, Faehn is especially intrigued by both her vault and floor routines.
Sloan is also impressed with her 
fellow freshman.
“I haven’t seen her compete 
much from the time she was a (Flor -
ida) Level 10 (competitor), but I heard she was really dedicated and she’s brought that here,” Sloan said. “She’s been working her butt off.”
Frazier said she has seen an in-
creased workload since coming to Florida. “The training is much faster and 
the practices are much faster, more intense because you can only train for a certain amount of time,” Fra-zier said. 
Frazier has taken notice of the 
work ethic and style of sophomore Kytra Hunter and All-American Ashanee Dickerson. 
The duo showed Frazier several 
nuances, such as running faster and opening her shoulders during her vault routines. 
The added time in the gym has 
aided Frazier’s college transition, and she noted that Sloan’s recent debut has been reassuring. 
“I saw how confident Bridget 
was going out there and that gave me confidence to say ‘I can do that too, I can hang with them’,” Frazier said. 
Whether Frazier will be compet-
ing on vault come Friday has yet to be determined, but UF has a range of gymnasts it can call upon when needed.
