◗ THERE ARE 115 CARDINALS TO 
CHOOSE FROM.
ANDREW KAYS
Alligator Contributing Writer
The College of Cardinals is set to begin 
the deliberation for a new pope today in 
Rome, a decision that will resonate across the world — including in Gainesville.
The Rev. Marek Dzien, of Gainesville’s St. Augustine Church and Catholic Student Center, said he compared the relationship between the pope and local congregations to that of Washington D.C. and the states.
“For 95 percent of Catholics, it’s more 
important what’s happening in their par-ish than in Rome,” he said. “But when a big decision is made, it affects everybody.”
The election process, also known as 
Conclave, will have 115 cardinals locked in the Chapel until they select the new leader of Catholicism.Conclave comes almost two weeks after 
Pope Benedict XVI resigned from his pa-pacy, making him the ﬁ  rst pope to resign in nearly 600 years.
The process to choose a new pope is 
straightforward: 
Members of the college who can travel 
to Rome and are under the age of 80 take part in the electoral ritual. 
Four times a day, the cardinals write the 
name of their choice on a slip of paper and place it into a golden urn in front of Mi-chelangelo’s “Judgement Day” painting.  Three cardinals are chosen to count and College of Cardinals begin process of pope selection today

As of today , UF students 
and faculty are ofﬁ  cially able to 
remotely access programs such as Adobe Photoshop and Auto-CAD without having to pay.
UFApps, produced through 
the Ofﬁ  ce of Academic Technol-ogy , is an online network that allows UF students to use thou-sands of dollars worth of soft-ware for free on any platform.
“We wanted to make soft-
ware more accessible for stu-dents,” Jameson Johnston, proj-ect coordinator for UFApps, wrote in an email. “Students have more and more access to mobile devices and laptop computers, and UFApps allows for access to popular computer software from anywhere at any time – it is the next step in the evolution of computer applica-tion technology.”According to the propos-
al, the startup costs for the program totaled more than $150,000. Licensing alone cost about $37,000. 
The program is funded 
through the Student Tech Fee proposal. All UF students pay this fee, which costs up to 5 percent of the tuition per credit hour. According to the UF Fact-book’s breakdown of student tuition and fees for the 2010-2011 school year, this fee was $4.78 a credit hour.
Every January , faculty , staff 
and students submit propos-als regarding a technical idea in need of funding. Last year’s proposals included UFApps, written by Michael Kutyna, and since its approval in Spring 2012, developers have handled all aspects of the program launch, said Tracy Gale, UF In- Students, faculty can 
now access software programs for free

Professor Elie Wiesel, Holocaust survivor 
and author of “Night,” will speak tonight at 
UF. Hosted by Accent Speaker’s Bureau and Jewish Awareness Month, Wiesel will speak about his experiences in the Auschwitz con-centration camp and his career as an author.The program starts at 8 p.m. at the Phil-
lips Center for the Performing Arts. 
Doors will open at 7 p.m. Student tickets 
are free and can be picked up from noon to 6 p.m. at the box ofﬁ  ce. General admission tickets will be distributed at 7 p.m.
Accent Chairman Josh Holtzman said 
Wiesel was chosen to speak because his mes-sage is not limited to the Jewish community.“It’s a message of un-
derstanding and facing the challenges of humanity and knowing the best and worst that people are ca-pable of,” said the 22-year-
old UF history and politi-cal science senior.
Wiesel is being paid $53,000, and Accent is paying $35,000 of that. The rest of the money is coming from Jewish Awareness Month, Holtzman said.
Ari Sokolov, a 20-year-old UF environ-
mental science junior, will be in attendance.
“He is a living part of history,” he said.Contact Alexa Volland at avolland@alliga-

record the votes.
If there isn’t a two-thirds majority 
for any candidate, the slips of paper are 
burned, and a black smoke emerges from the Chapel’s chimney, signaling there will be another vote.
Once a majority is reached, however, 
white smoke signals will show that a new pope was chosen.
The newly-elected pope then chooses 
a new name and is fitted for papal robes before addressing the world for the first time.
Dzien said he doesn’t think the next 
pope is likely to make too many chang-es. He does believe a more conservative pope will be chosen.
Jordan Kassabaum, a 21-year-old UF 
religion and classics senior, agreed, but thinks a non-European pope would be beneficial for the Church.
“I think doing that would be a good 
thing because it would show that the church really is the universal church, Catholic meaning universal, not just the European church,” he said.4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, MARCH 12, 2013

Gainesville residents might be 
alarmed to know just how stable — 
or unstable — the ground they walk on is.
Anthony Randazzo, a UF profes-
sor emeritus of geological sciences and president of Geohazards — a group that evaluates areas for sink-holes — said Gainesville is at high risk when it comes to sinkhole for -
mation. However, he said, residents shouldn’t be worried that an event like the Tampa-area Seffner sink-hole, which trapped one person Feb. 28, will happen here.
“[Gainesville is] probably ahead 
of Seffner in terms of the number of sinkholes, probably behind Seffner in terms of the catastrophic kind of sinkholes — the ones that swallow up a home in a matter of hours,” Randazzo said.
He added sinkholes form as a 
result of eroding limestone near the Earth’s surface. Over time, the ero-sion creates cavi-
ties, which can get bigger and no longer support the weight of the ground above them.
Randazzo said 
the 20-foot-wide and 50- to 60-foot 
deep Seffner sinkhole, which swal-lowed and killed Jeffrey Bush, 37, while he was sleeping, is rare.
“This is only the third time in 40 years ... that I have documented a case of a fatality associated with the formation of a sinkhole,” he said.
Donald Sessions, special opera-
tions chief at Gainesville Fire Res-cue, said he doesn’t think residents should panic because of the Seffner tragedy.
“All of Florida presents a risk just 
because of the land,” he said. “When sinkholes open up here, it’s been in rural areas.”
Sessions said GFR doesn’t have 
specific policies for sinkholes, add-ing firefighters are still trained to handle those types of emergencies.
“It’s part of our technical rescue: 
rope rescue, trench collapse, struc-tural collapse,” he said. “All of these things are elements that we train on and have specialty teams that re-spond to them.”
Randazzo and Sessions both 
said residents should monitor their homes for signs of damage such as cracks in the walls, tilting of floor slabs or strange noises that could all be a precursor to a sinkhole.

Alfredo Espinosa may not be the obvious 
person to run for City Commission, but that 
isn’t stopping him.
The 20-year-old UF building construction 
junior is running for the District 4 seat in the Gainesville City Commission.
“I wanted to do something different,” the 
Venezuelan native said.
District 4 covers the main UF campus and 
the area behind Midtown, which includes stu-dent housing.
Espinosa, who moved to the United States 
when he was 6 years old, said UF’s Student Body is underrepresented on the city level.
If elected, Espinosa said he wants to give 
district residents a voice in the commission.
“I’m here to listen and here to hear them 
out,” he said.
Espinosa said being a student wouldn’t af-
fect the time he would dedicate to his job as a commissioner.
As a student, he said he would pick his 
own schedule and focus on City Commission during business hours and take classes during other times.
Espinosa said he wants to enact a soft clos-
ing of bars at 2 a.m. and cut utility rates. In the past year, rates went up 10 percent, which is a hardship to both students and businesses in the district, he said.
With an interest in building construction 
and project management, Espinosa said he wants to speak with builders and developers to ease traffic congestion in the district.
Espinosa said he also plans to tackle the is-
sue of homelessness. He said the city should work with situational homeless families to ensure they don’t become permanently home-less.
“Our community deserves better,” he said.Espinosa’s last goal is to create a pro-busi-
ness-friendly environment in the district. He said Gainesville has a lot of innovation but no capital.
“We need to make Gainesville attractive to 
outsiders,” he said.
Espinosa has lived in Gainesville since 
starting at UF in 2010. He said his experience as a Preview staffer last summer will help him immensely if elected.
He said he worked about 70 hours a week 
in a fast-paced, high-pressure environment where he worked with people of different backgrounds.
“It was my motivation to help people and 
give back,” Espinosa said.
During that time, Espinosa met his cam-
paign manager Ryan Garcia.
Garcia, a 22-year-old UF economics and 
history senior, said he was volunteering at convocation when he met Espinosa.
“He would bring a lot of energy , passion 
— and frankly, intelligence — to the commis-sion,” Garcia said.
Garcia said Espinosa is relatable and per -
sonable to most people.
“He’s always willing to listen and hear ev-
eryone out,” he said.

OPINIONS EDITORToday’s question: Should medical marijuana become 
legalized in Florida?
49% YES
51% NO
66 TOTAL VOTESMonday’s question: Have you ever ordered Midnight Cookies? New York City may be the city that never sleeps, but it 
almost slept on something pretty important: soda leg-islation.
For some reason, the day before Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s 
controversial soda ban would take effect, New York Supreme Court Justice Milton Tingling in Manhattan overruled it.
Sort of.Back in September, the city’s Board of Health approved 
Bloomberg’s plan to limit the size of sugary soft drinks sold in restaurants, movie theaters, stadiums and arenas to no more than 16 ounces a cup.
“In October, groups representing beverage makers, restau-
rants and theaters ﬁ  led a petition in state court, seeking to block the measure,” reported Bloomberg, the news publication, not the mayor. “They called the ban ‘unprecedented interference’ with consumer choice.”
“In anticipation of the soda ban, Bloomberg on Monday re-
leased new data tying sugary drinks to the city’s fattest neighbor-hoods,” said a CNN Money article. “The new city study showed nine of the neighborhoods with the 10 highest obesity rates were also the highest in sugary drink consumption. At the other end, the three least obese neighborhoods were also the lowest in sug-ary drink consumption.”
We’re pretty sure people should just, at the very least, try not 
to ruin themselves.
People are complaining that the state is attempting to take 
too much control over everyone’s everyday lives, but, like, may-be don’t drink giant sugary soft drinks.
Is that too much to ask?“This is America,” they yell. “We can do whatever we 
please.”
“It is arbitrary and capricious because it applies to some but 
not all food establishments in the city, it excludes other beverages that have signiﬁ  cantly higher concentrations of sugar sweeten-ers and/or calories on suspect grounds, and the loopholes inher-ent in the rule ... serve to gut the purpose of the rule,” Tingling wrote.
What’s crazy to us is the judge waited until the day before 
the ban was going to start to make any kind of decision on this challenge.
Like, did you forget this was coming up, dude?Are businesses just complaining about losing customers even 
though this decision will make customers healthier?
And don’t try to claim this ban wouldn’t, at least, make small 
strides toward a healthier New York City. The mayor released a study that clearly illustrated what people this ban would posi-tively affect.
“Nearly 60 percent of New York City adults and 40 percent of 
city schoolchildren are overweight or obese,” reported the CNN Money article.
Those numbers are only slightly higher than the national av-
erage, as about 36 percent of Americans are obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s one-third of the adults in this country.
It doesn’t seem like we, as an American society , can be trusted 
to make our own decisions when it comes to junk food.Will NYC lead the 
charge after all?
Google Glass is a case of dreams vs. reality
I know some harbinger of doom says this every single year, but I really do believe Americans will have to have a ‘come-to-Jesus’ moment with their technology 
pretty soon.
Maybe we will need public service announcements of 
some kind, or maybe some sort of visual reminder. I’m thinking of one of those little rubber bracelets that usual-ly say “LIVESTRONG” or “WWJD” but instead one side says, “Is this a good idea?”, and then when you ﬂ  ip it over the other side reads, “No, probably not.”
What I’m trying to say is Google Glass is dumb. There. 
I said it. Woo, that’s such a weight off my shoulders. Deep breaths, Flannery, deep breaths.
The idea of Google Glass itself is dumb. A hands-free 
device that can take and share point-of-view pictures and photos or that can use Google or Google Maps without you pressing buttons? Absolutely brilliant.
I am sure everyone at some point has thought, “Man, 
if only [person] could see what I am seeing right now.” Now to say we have the tech to do just that is a little mind-blowing.
But like every other brilliantly innovative piece of tech-
nology that sounds terriﬁ  c in theory, its real-world use will probably just disgrace its originally intended one.
When Google itself was invented, I bet the program-
mers dreamed of a virtual space where knowledge and experience could be freely traded across people and cul-tures, instead of a gateway platform for people with large amounts of free time to search for porn and videos of cats doing funny things.
Was that example blown a little out of proportion? Yes, 
but I was trying to make a point.
We vastly underuse the technological resources given 
to us. I’m not necessarily saying that is a bad thing, but believe me, a few years from now when I see someone walking around wearing Google Glass, I won’t think, “Man, that person must be a highly-sophisticated multi-tasking individual.” I will think, “That person is probably watching porn or cat videos right now. And just stepped out in front of a bus.”The promotional videos 
Google has pushed out to pro-mote Glass have all featured “regular” people using Glass as they all do wildly adventurous things like skydiving or taking trips in hot air balloons, which makes sense.
Wouldn’t it be incredible to 
see a gymnast’s routine through 
her eyes or to see the New Year’s ball drop from the per-spective of someone in Times Square?
More likely, the techy-type people who are willing to 
fork over $1,500 for a “still-in-market-testing” product are probably not the people doing the skydiving or hot air balloon trips.
Google is desperately trying to appeal to the everyday 
consumer, and in its haste to launch a product, I think it forgot the everyday consumer lives a pretty boring life.
Looking over the promotional material and blog post 
hype, I thought about what I would use Glass for.
I came to the conclusion that I would use it to record 
and share local concerts with my friends and to look up pictures of baby hedgehogs. Which isn’t all bad — who couldn’t use more hedgehogs in life? — but I still don’t think that would justify me dropping a grand and a half on it.
When advertisements for the next shiny thing come 
along, always feel free to stop and ask yourself the hard-hitting question, “Is that really the best use of my money and free time?”
Be honest with yourself because the more sophisticated 
the technology, the more it tends to make fools of us all.
I’m sure everyone thought when they got a Twitter, 
they would share their vast amounts of witty quips and wisdoms with the world instead of complaining about their jobs and taking duck-face pictures.

◗ DETECTIVES HAVE FOUND FOUR 
VICTIMS.
KATHRYN VARN
Alligator Writer
The Alachua County Sheriff’s Office is look-
ing for victims who could have been affected by 
an ATM skimming scheme at a Jonesville Publix last month.
On Feb. 18, ASO arrested three men for at-
taching a card skimming device and video cam-era to a Presto! ATM outside of a Publix, located at 14130 W. Newberry Road, according to an ASO news release.
So far, detectives have tracked down four vic-
tims, said ASO Detective William Beck. Howev-er, Beck used a surveillance video to identify that nine people used the ATM between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. when the hardware was attached.
In a typical card skimming scheme, criminals 
create a plastic mold of a card reader, whether it’s on an ATM, gas pump or other card-reading device, and then place it over the existing reader, said ASO spokesman Lt. Todd Kelly.
They also attach a micro-wireless camera to 
the device that points down at the keypad, Kelly said.
When someone swipes a card, the fake reader 
sends information from the card to a computer, Kelly said. The criminals can also watch the user punch in his or her PIN via the camera.
When the men were arrested in the Jones-
ville ATM incident, ASO received word from other police departments and sheriff’s offices that the men matched descriptions for suspects who committed similar crimes in other counties, Kelly said.
Kelly and Beck believe the three men weren’t 
acting alone.
“In cases like this, it generally does expand 
much broader,” Kelly said.
The men could be just a few people in a larger 
organization. Kelly described it like a military operation, with a chain of command of people with different positions working toward a com-mon goal: to obtain information and steal mil-lions of dollars.
To avoid becoming a victim of card skim-
ming, Kelly advised county residents to avoid ATMs and instead take out cash from a bank or through the cash-back option at a store.
However, if someone needs to use an ATM, 
Kelly recommends checking the card reader. If it looks different than the rest of the machine or feels hollow, don’t use it, he said.
Kelly said if someone believes they were a 
victim of card skimming, they should contact police as well as their bank.
By doing this, detectives will be able to speed 
up the investigation process, he said.
“If you can go the extra step to prevent some-
one else from being a victim, you’re doing your part in the community,” he said.
If you have any information about the Jones-
ville Publix ATM incident or other card skim-ming issues throughout the county, contact De-tective Beck at 352-367-4166 or Crimestoppers.

Between work and classes, students don’t 
always have time to sort out the sincere sweet-
hearts from pretentious players in their depart-ments, let alone their campuses.
But Datemyschool.com, which has been ad-
vertised around UF, is hoping to resolve this problem.
UF has about 500 students on the network, 
said Zachary Hayworth, director of national operations for Date My School.
The site, founded in 2010 at Columbia Uni-
versity, has about 209,000 users and seeks to connect students to potential boyfriends, girl-friends or just friends around their universities who they wouldn’t otherwise meet.
Adriana Di Graziano, a 20-year-old UF pub-
lic relations freshman and a campus ambas-sador for the company , said a week after the site launched, about 5 percent of Columbia’s Student Body registered for the site, which prompted founders to expand to other univer -
sities.
The site’s co-founder, Balazs Alexa, wrote in 
an email that he is excited to have UF involved in the site.
“UF is an incredibly important ‘anchor’ 
school for us in Florida, given its positive repu-tation and sheer size of 50,000+ students,” he said.
Although other campuses regularly have 200 students sign up a week, Di Graziano said she has seen recent increases in UF numbers.
Only individuals with .edu email addresses 
can join the site, which includes current under -
graduates, graduates and alumni.
Although users cannot search by name for 
privacy purposes, they can exclude individuals from viewing their information.
“No one will know that you are there unless 
you want them to,” Di Graziano said.
Although UF’s activity is still growing, 
schools like Columbia and New York Univer -
sity have a combined 17,000 user base.
“My dream is to have a similar user base 
at UF as what we have in New York schools,” Alexa said. “So if … we would become respon-sible for 50+ percent of dates happening on campus — I would be happy.”
UF public relations senior Saphira Lazarre 
said she considers this new site to be another categorical dating website.
“I am definitely a big skeptic when it comes 
to online dating,” the 21-year-old said. “I’m an old-fashioned girl. I’d rather meet someone personally and use it in terms of networking.”New dating website reaches UF
◗ THE BILL WAS INTRODUCED TO 
THE FLORIDA SENATE MARCH 5.
JOVAHN HUERTAS
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF student Guy Ginton may not need 
medical marijuana, but he supports it for 
people who do.
Eighteen states, plus the District of 
Columbia, allow the use of medical mar -
ijuana, and Florida may be next.
Florida State Sen. Jeff Clemens, D-
Lake Worth, filed the Cathy Jordan Medical Cannabis Act on Feb. 27, which would allow for the possession and use of marijuana for medical purposes in Florida.
The bill is named for Cathy Jordan, 
the president of the Florida Cannabis Action Network, who has Lou Gehrig’s disease. Her house was raided by police, seizing the marijuana she was using to treat her condition.
“Her case really demonstrates a lot of 
what’s going on right now,” said Ginton, 21, an UF economics junior and former president of UF’s chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijua-na Laws.
Ginton said he feels people should 
have full rights to use marijuana as med-icine.
“Right now, you have people who can 
be treated with this medicine and aren’t able,” he said. “It’s a weird situation — in certain states you can be treated, but in others you can’t.”
A recent poll showed as many as 
seven in 10 Florida voters would sup-port a state constitutional amendment legalizing medical marijuana. The poll, which was conducted by People United for Medical Marijuana, showed 24 per -
cent of respondents opposed medical marijuana. The bill was introduced to the Florida Senate on March 5.
But UF anthropology sophomore 
Mariah Nelson, 19, said she would vote against medical marijuana.
“I don’t think it should be smoked,” 
she said. “There are other, healthier ways to relieve stress and pain.”Florida Senate to hear bill 
on medical marijuana
“UF is an incredibly important 
‘anchor’ school for us in Florida, 
given its positive reputation and 
sheer size of 50,000+ students.”

Tournament? Vote online at alligatorSports.org.   JOSH JURNOVOY

 The ﬂ  ashes have been there. 
UF   has proven capable of catch-
ing ﬁ  re offensively this season.
Florida scored 16 runs against 
Duke in its third game of the sea-son and six runs in each of its two victories in a series win against Miami during the ﬁ  rst weekend in March.
  The Gators must rediscover 
that spark if they want to get another win against an in-state rival.
  When Florida (8-9) hosts ﬁ  fth-
ranked Florida State (15-0) to-night at 7 at McKethan Stadium, it will look to ﬁ  nd its collective stroke at the plate after losing a weekend series at home against Indiana.
  “We need to swing the bat 
better,” sophomore Justin Sha-fer said. “We didn’t have a good weekend hitting. All of us. It hap-pens, but we just got to get bet-ter.”
  In Sunday’s loss, Florida’s position players were unable to work counts.
UF had 37 plate appearances, 
with a batter getting to a three-ball count just ﬁ  ve times.
And when they did get favor-
able counts, the Gators failed to take advantage of them.
  “We got into some offensive 
counts,” O’Sullivan said of his team’s at-bats on Sunday.
“Two of the three double 
plays we hit into, we had offen-sive counts. If you get to a 2-0, 3-1 count, you got to do some damage. You can’t miss those pitches.”
  In Friday’s and Sunday’s loss-
es to Indiana, UF put together consecutive hits only twice.

 Although missing shots has hurt the Gators in late-game situations this sea-
son, coach Billy Donovan said turnovers played a bigger role in the Gators’ 
meltdowns against Kentucky on Saturday, Missouri on Feb. 19 and Arizona on Dec. 15.
  During its 61-57 loss against Kentucky in Rupp Arena in Lexington, Ky., No. 
13 Florida relinquished a lead of at least six points in the ﬁ  nal 10 minutes of a game for the third time this season. Late turnovers by the Gators fueled runs of 11-0 by Kentucky, 7-0 by Arizona and 12-0 by Mizzou in UF’s three losses to 
those teams. 
  “We’re having a hard time taking care of 
the ball,” forward Will Yeguete said. “We’ve struggled the past couple games down the 
stretch. I think we have to work on executing, and we’ll be ﬁ  ne.”
  Donovan added: “If you look at the numbers, it’s not like we’re turning the 
ball over 20 times a game. But in some of those stretches where we’ve got a lead, some of those things are coming back and we’re not giving ourselves a chance to shoot the basketball.”
  Against Kentucky, Missouri and Arizona, Florida committed just 23 com-
bined turnovers in the ﬁ  rst 30 minutes of play but was plagued by 17 giveaways in the ﬁ  nal 10 minutes. 
  Ten of the 17 turnovers came from errant passes. Guard Mike Rosario com-
mitted six of those, while forward Erik Murphy had four. 
  Mistimed passes hurt UF against UK on Saturday. Four of the Gators’ ﬁ  ve  Ill-timed turnovers plague

 PHILIBUSTER
  The Southeastern Conference women’s 
basketball coaches decided one Gator was worthy of representing Florida 
on this year’s All-SEC team. 
  But unfortunately for those paying real 
attention to UF, it is obvious they chose the wrong one on March 5. 
  Entering the season, Jennifer George was 
expected to carry an inexperienced Florida squad. George was named a preseason First Team All-SEC honoree, the ﬁ  rst UF player to garner that type of recognition since Mar-shae Dotson prior to the 2008-2009 season. 
  But injuries derailed the season of Flori-
da’s lone senior.
She never came close to matching the ef-
fectiveness she brought to the ﬂ  oor during her junior campaign when she essentially came out of nowhere to help lead the Gators to the NCAA Tournament.  
  In her place, junior guard Jaterra Bonds 
answered the call. 
  Best known as a streaky shooter and 
somewhat mercurial ﬁ  gure on the court during her ﬁ  rst two seasons, Bonds took a leap forward this year while George took a step back. 
  Through 32 games, the Gainesville na-
tive leads the Gators in scoring with 12.7 points per contest to go along with 3.3 as-sists and 3.8 rebounds.  Coach Amanda 
Butler refers to the SEC as the toughest conference in wom-en’s collegiate bas-ketball. 
Bonds responded 
to the added chal-
lenge of facing elite talent by improving her numbers. 
  She averaged 14.8 points in 18 conference 
matchups, though two games came during the SEC Tournament, which was held after the All-SEC teams were announced.
Unfortunately for Bonds, averaging 17.5 
points in a victory against Arkansas and a loss to Tennessee did not count in the vot-ing. 
  But more impressive than raw statistics 
is the way Bonds passes the “Eye Test.” Having been to nearly every Florida home game the past two seasons, it is easy to see her development on the ﬂ  oor during that time. 
  She is no longer the shoot-ﬁ  rst, think-
second point guard she was during her ﬁ  rst two seasons.
While some games still tend to be an 
emotional adventure, her teammates are  Guard deserves SEC honorSEE BASEBALL, PAGE 16

Junior forward Will Yeguete dribbles during Florida’s 66-40 victory 
against Vanderbilt on March 6 in the O’Connell Center.Yeguete played 19 minutes vs. UK
turnovers late in the second half 
resulted from miscommunica-tion. 
Kentucky defenders stole two 
of Rosario’s passes in the last 10 minutes. 
Two passes from Wilbekin — 
a dish intended for guard Kenny Boynton on the right wing and a lob pass to forward Casey Prather for a dunk — sailed out of bounds. 
“The building was loud, and 
I called a play. Boynton thought I called something else,” Dono-van said. “He kind of got con-fused. Then when he realized what I called, he was running to get into the action when Scottie threw it to him. So it was kind of a miscommunication, which was hard.
“Prather is open on a backdoor 
lob, wide open. Scottie throws a lefty pass with one hand. It goes off Prather’s hands and goes out of bounds. We have to execute that, because it was open and was the right pass, but a poorly executed pass.”
Yeguete feeling better: After 
missing six games in February due to arthroscopic surgery to remove bone chips in his right knee, Yeguete is finally seeing increased playing time.  
In Florida’s loss to Kentucky, 
Yeguete logged 19 minutes, his highest total since Jan. 30. The junior forward recorded four points, six rebounds and two as-sists against the Wildcats. “This is the first time I’ve seen 
Yeguete back to close to where he was at,” Donovan said after Saturday’s game.
Added Yeguete: “I’m doing 
rehab every single day, even though we have days off. Taking care of my knee every day, after practice and before practice. So far, it’s good.”
Yeguete returned from injury 
on March 2 against Alabama, but logged only 23 combined min-utes in two games prior to Sat-urday. 
With Florida’s first game of 
the SEC Tournament on Friday, Yeguete is preparing for the chal-lenge of possibly playing three days in a row.  
“I don’t think you have any 
choice,” Yeguete said. “Every player is going to be tired, and every player is going to be sore.”

Guard Jaterra Bonds drives to the basket during 
Florida’s 68-57 loss to Vanderbilt on Feb. 21.
better when she is on the floor — which 
is nearly always. 
Bonds finished fifth in the confer -
ence in minutes per game, averaging 33.7. Nobody else on UF even averages 30 minutes per contest. 
Staying on the court proved espe-
cially tough for George this season, a shame for a player nearing the end of her college career.  
She missed the opening game of the 
season — an easy win against Fairfield — for an undisclosed reason. But an even bigger blow came against LSU on Jan. 6. George suffered a dislocation of her 
right shoulder in the Gators’ 77-72 win against the Tigers in the O’Connell Center. 
Despite missing only one game be-
cause of the injury, she was never truly the same. 
George gutted it out four days later 
against Mississippi State, but she was largely ineffective.
The Bulldogs held George scoreless 
in 17 minutes.
She then suffered a second disloca-
tion in an 78-75 loss to Tennessee on Jan. 13 and missed Florida’s 52-44 loss to South Carolina on Jan. 20. 
Since then, George has been up and 
down. She is certainly having a produc-
tive season. George is averaging 11.5 points and a team-best eight rebounds per contest. 
There is no question she is a versa-
tile player for the team. She also tops the Gators in blocks, steals and double-doubles.
But if the SEC is only going to hon-
or one Gator among the league’s best players, it should be Bonds. 
Bonds is Florida’s leader and its 
most important player.
For that, she should not have to set-
tle for a spot on the SEC Community Service Team.

Sophomore midfielder Nora Barry runs past Stony Brook’s Amber 
Kupres during the Gators’ 16-9 win on Feb. 20 at Dizney Stadium.
LACROSSE
MAX MATTERN
Alligator Writer
 
Sophomore midfielder Nora 
Barry may not put up gaudy num-
bers, but she is what coach Aman-da O’Leary wants each of her play-ers to be — consistent.
“Nora’s not going to be your 
flashy player,” O’Leary said. “She’s going to be somebody that’s going to do the dirty work.”
The reigning American La-
crosse Conference Rookie of the Year has had a quiet yet successful season thus far.
Barry helped propel the second-
ranked Gators to their ninth win of the season by scoring three goals on three shots during Florida’s 14-9 win against then-No. 13 Dart-mouth on Saturday. She has scored 11 goals on 14 shots this season for a team-best 78.6 shot percentage. The Gators’ average as a team is less than 50 percent. 
“She’s going to take those op-
portunities that are afforded to her and make the most out of them,” O’Leary said. “She’s not going to shoot to shoot. She’s going to shoot to score.”
Barry has recorded at least 
one point in the Gators’ last eight matches and looks to extend that streak when Florida (9-0) takes on Lehigh (2-3, 0-1) tonight at 6:30.
She has tallied at least one point 
in 27 of her 31 games played in her career.
O’Leary described playing the 
midfield as doing the dirty work for the team. That dirty work shows up in the statistical columns as groundballs and draw controls.
Barry is tied for second on the 
team in groundballs with 14 and third in draw controls with 20. She was asked to step up in Saturday’s game in the draw when senior Brit-tany Dashiell was sidelined with a concussion. Barry answered the call, collecting four draw controls to lead the team.
Barry said playing in midfield 
requires her to be versatile enough to grab groundballs, snag draw controls and score on offense while helping defensively as well.
The 5-foot-4 sophomore uses her speed to help make up for her lack of size while defending.
“I use quickness to defend peo-
ple who are taller,” Barry said. “If I can stay in front of them, even if they are taller, they can’t shoot through me, so I use quickness to my advantage.”
Barry has forced opponents to 
turn the ball over eight times this season. She is second on the team behind senior defender Sam Far -
rell, who has 11 forced turnovers.
“She is small, but she is tena-
cious,” O’Leary said. “She is strong for her size, so we have no prob-lem putting her against teams’ bet-ter players.”
With a team that can go from 
a 10-1 run in 23 minutes against Dartmouth to a 25-minute score-less lull in a 5-3 win against UNC, O’Leary hopes UF improves its consistency.
And that’s what Barry has to 
offer.
“I’m not really sure where we 
would be without Nora,” O’Leary said. “That’s how critical she is to our program.”
Sophomore midfielder providing efficiency, consistency for UF
Florida State’s expected starter tonight boasts a 0.64 ERA in ‘13
In the third inning of Friday’s 4-1 de-
feat, senior utility fielder Cody Dent and 
sophomore second baseman Casey Tur -
geon led off with back-to-back singles, but Florida ended the frame with no runs and  the bases loaded. 
The Gators had five straight batters 
reach base in the eighth inning of their 7-4 loss on Sunday via four singles and a walk, which led to four runs.But the four-run comeback was not 
enough to climb out of a 7-0 hole against the Hoosiers.
First baseman Vickash Ramjit does not 
believe anything needs to change with Florida’s plate approach.
The Gators’ batters just have to ex-
ecute.
“Just not miss pitches when we get 
them,” Ramjit said.
“Missed a lot of pitches when we had 
the chance, and it went against us.”Weaver starting: O’Sullivan said on Sun-day that he expects the Seminoles to start 
sophomore right-hander Luke Weaver tonight.
In three appear -
ances against the Gators in 2012, Weaver struggled.
He surrendered five runs in 5.1 in-
nings, but struck out five of the 10 batters he faced in a 6-3 UF win in Tallahassee on April 10.
Weaver has an ERA of 0.64, allowing 
only one run in 14 innings this year.  In his two midweek starts this season, Weaver has gone six innings in both outings while striking out 17 batters without issuing a walk. 
“He’s got a good arm,” O’Sullivan said. 
“It’s a rivalry game. We have to com-pete.”
