As the Islamic State becomes a growing 
topic of national discussion,  three UF pro-
fessors hosted a public conversation on the issue Wednesday.
The Bob Graham Center for Public Ser-
vice held the ISIS and the Question of Is-lamic Militancy panel in Pugh Hall.
The professors offered different perspec-
tives on the violent actions of ISIS and other Islamic militant groups.  
Panelist Terje Østebø, an assistant pro-
fessor with UF’s Center for African Stud-ies and the Department of Religion, spoke ﬁ  rst about ISIS trying to establish religious purity.
“What we’re seeing is enforcement of 
this purity now with very violent means,” Østebø said.  
He said ISIS claiming to be a religious 
movement is something to be taken seri-ously.
About 50 people attended the ISIS dis-cussion.
At the panel, Matthew Jacobs, an as-
sociate professor in the UF Department of History, suggested ISIS should be seen as a problem stemming from years of political chaos in that region.  
Panelist Leonardo Villalón, the Interna-
tional Center dean, expressed similar con-cerns during the discussion.  
“We need to ask ourselves, what are the 
conditions that are provoking people to join these kinds of movements?” Villalón said.
Audience members were encouraged to 
make their own points and pose questions at the end of the panel.VOLUME 109 ISSUE 43 WWW.ALLIGATOR.ORG THURSDAY, OCTOBER 23, 2014

UF released 175 pages of documents Wednesday, including 
a witness testimony and an interview between Treon Harris 
and Detective Justin Faroni. The documents also contain an in-cident report and multiple text messages that shed light on the details of the sexual battery complaint ﬁ  led against Harris on Oct. 6, which was withdrawn Oct. 9. 
■   ■   ■
It is 6:36 a.m. Oct. 6, and Treon Harris is in the kitchen area 
shared by the residents of the fourth ﬂ  oor of Building 4 of the Springs Residential Complex in just a shirt and his underwear. He can’t get any other clothes because his room is sealed off by police, and anything in it is considered potential evidence. He agreed to speak with Faroni there instead of at the Univer-sity Police Criminal Investigations Division because he didn’t want to leave the building without wearing more clothes.
Just after midnight Oct. 6, a female UF 
student reported that Harris sexually as-saulted her in his room in the early hours of Oct. 5. Harris admits he has known the com-
plainant since the summer when they both arrived at UF, admits immediately in the in-
terview with Faroni that he believes she’s in-
terested in him romantically and says on the night in question, 
she “kept” trying to sleep with him. Harris repeatedly states in the interview with Faroni that the two had intercourse but that it was consensual and that she in no way gave him any sign of not wanting to have intercourse that night.Harris is repeatedly confused about why the complainant 
waited nearly 24 hours to report anything and is also distressed about the fact that the incident might appear on ESPN. 
Harris says he could tell the complainant liked him from the 
moment he met her. He said she would say things like “you’re so handsome.” 
The night began after Harris returned to Gainesville with 
the rest of the Florida football team after a 10-9 victory over the University of Tennessee Volunteers. Harris and the complain-
ant had “hung out” the Wednesday before the game — Harris 
and the team left for Knoxville, Tennessee, on Oct. 3. 
When they returned the next day, per testimony given by 
Harris’ roommate Quincy Wilson, Wilson said he and Harris returned to their residence hall at 6:30 p.m. and watched T.V. UF releases police report regarding Treon Harris case

A few new sororities and fraternities will 
be added to the UF Greek community starting 
Spring of 2015.
Voting for the potential groups took place 
Wednesday night. The ofﬁ  cial decision will 
not be announced until mid-November.  
The Multicultural Greek Council Expan-
sion Committee and Panhellenic Council Ex-
tension Committee are voting to invite three groups to be a part of UF’s campus.
“It’s really exciting to see our community 
as growing like this and to have the member-ship to support more groups,” said Betsy Ad-ams, program coordinator for the department 
of Student Activities and Involvement.
Since 2002, UF Panhellenic has not added 
a new sorority, and the Multicultural Council 
has not added a new group since 2011.
“This is a historic time for us,” Adams 
said.
She said UF Panhellenic is looking to add a 
new sorority in Fall of 2015. The three sorori-ties applying to be new additions to UF are 
Gamma Phi Beta, Phi Sigma Sigma and Alpha 
Phi.  
Phi Sigma Sigma closed in 1994, but the so-
rority is looking to re-establish itself on cam-pus.

Jesus Lopez, 26, a tattoo artist at Death or Glory Tattoo Parlour, paints a dragon on the face of the shop. 
The dragon is an old Sailor Jerry design the shop chose to spruce up the building.hellenic Council, said it’s an honor to have the opportunity to be 
able to begin the process of expansion.
“The council hasn’t expanded in over a decade, so it’s due 
time that we bring an incredible chapter to the University of Florida,” the UF political science senior said.  
Torgerson said by expanding, more UF women will have the 
opportunity to be a part of the Panhellenic experience.
Nine groups applied and three were selected for the ﬁ  nal 
round of the Multicultural Council’s decision. The three Asian interest groups are: Delta Phi Lambda Sorority, Inc., Lambda Phi Epsilon Fraternity, Inc. and Sigma Sigma Rho Sorority, Inc.
Adams said it will take about one to two years for the Greek 
houses to be built and it will cost around $6 million to be con-structed, based on previous houses.
President of the Multicultural Council Hrishi Kumbhojkar, 
22, said the council is always looking for ways to grow and in-clude as many cultures as possible at UF.
“All three organizations brought personality and opportu-
nity for students, and the students themselves are very active both in their organization and on campus,” the UF mechanical engineer ﬁ  fth-year said. “In MGC (Multicultural Greek Coun-cil) it’s all there. We offer a lot for any individual wanting to join Greek life.”

As the grand opening of its new facility nears, 
Gainesville Regional Transit System is one step closer to 
incorporating new bicycle racks on each of its buses.
The RTS Bus Fleet Maintenance & Operations Facility 
will open Nov. 20 with more space and improved bus-es, which will be accompanied by bike racks that could ﬁ  t three to ﬁ  ve bikes at a time, said Chip Skinner, RTS 
spokesman.
“We’re not as large as a bigger city where the bus can 
swing into another lane and come around,” Skinner said. 
“We’ve always been limited to a two-bike rack system.”But with the help of new vendor Byk-Rak, RTS buses 
will soon have more room for bicycles.
“They actually offset it so it’s more of a staggered bike 
system,” Skinner said.
Byk-Rak has been working with the Florida Depart-
ment of Transportation for the past two years to approve the company’s racks, said Ron Coon, Byk-Rak marketing and sales vice president.“The bike owner can have fenders on their bikes and 
use our racks,” Coon wrote in an email. “With our wheel-
locking system, fenders have no interference to our tire-
locking device.”
Some students are wary of the new bike rack system 
and how effective it may be.
UF art history sophomore Alejandra Carrillo rides her 
bike at least four times a week.
She said she likes the idea of more space for bikes but 
is worried about the logistics.
“I think it’s good because sometimes you get there and 
there’s two bikes already, so you have to wait again,” the 20-year-old said. “However, I struggle putting my bike on the rack when there’s one in front and I have to put it behind that one.”New expanded bicycle racks to appear on RTS buses in Nov

Housed on the first floor of 
The Swamp Restaurant, a new 
coffee delivery service will soon 
cycle java to students.
Vive Delivery will quelch cof-
fee cravings via bicycle deliveries 
starting next month, replacing the 
void GoJoe left after the company 
went on hiatus following Spring semester.
Deliveries will run Mondays 
through Fridays from 6:30 a.m. to 
12:30 p.m.
“I noticed so many times that 
line outside of Starbucks going 
out the door, and students frus-
trated having to go out of their 
way to get their coffee,” said Vive’s co-founder, DJ Staub. “I heard so many complaints.”
The 22-year-old UF food sci-
ence and human nutrition senior decided to start the business with Daniel Varona, a UF alumnus.
“If I was going to work 100 
hours a week, I wasn’t going to do it for anyone else,” Varona said.
The student-based company 
offers three different types of coffee: a light roast called Eyes Wide Open, Vive’s Medium House Blend and Premium Bra-
zilian Dark Roast. All three cost 
$2.99 each including tax and de-livery fees. Orders can be placed through Vive’s mobile applica-
tion, its website or a telephone 
call.  
Unlike GoJoe, Staub said Vive 
personalizes each cup of coffee.
“It’s going to be slow with 
this first location opening up,” he said.
But in the next four years, 
Staub and Varona plan to expand 
their business to 10 different col-
lege campuses in the Southeast.
UF psychology senior Iman 
Bouryou said she would be in-terested in Vive for the conve-
nience.
“A great aspect of this is that 
I can order through an app so I 
don’t have to stand in a long Star-
bucks line at the Reitz or Library 
West,” the 21-year-old said.THURSDAY, OCTOBER 23, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

If you’re in college, it’s likely that pizza is 
the love of your life — the Internet says so. 
And come December, you’ll be able to 
customize your favorite food into the ideal 
thin-crust slice thanks to a new build-your-
own pizza chain coming to Gainesville.
National franchise Blaze Fast Fire’d Pizza 
will open its doors at 3617 SW Archer Road, 
across from Butler Plaza, bringing a new meaning to assembly-line fast food. 
Customers can go down the line and 
build 11-inch personal pizzas from the sauce up. Choices include a selection of handmade sauces, like Blaze’s spicy red sauce, cheeses from ovalini mozzarella to ricotta, vegetables and meats like applewood bacon and Italian sausage.
Pile them on — no matter the toppings, 
the pizza comes for one set price: $7.85.
Personal pizzas are then cooked in an 
open-flame oven and served in 2 to 3 min-utes. “We try to position our price point so that 
it’s affordable for college students that are on a budget,” said Dennis Sherer, a managing 
partner for the Florida market. 
The restaurant also serves “simple pie” 
cheese pizzas for $5, signature pizzas for 
$7.85, entree salads for $6.25 and its s’more pie dessert for $2. It will seat about 100 cus-tomers between indoor tables and two out-door patios.
Blaze’s special dough is made from execu-
tive chef Brad Kent’s recipe, which requires a 24-hour fermentation period to create a crisp crust. 
Blaze will also offer gluten-free dough 
and vegan cheese, as well as a selection of wine and craft beer.
Backed by investors such as LeBron James 
and Maria Shriver, the chain has opened in 11 states and Washington, D.C. since its California opening in 2012.  Blaze Pizza will continue to open restaurants across Florida, 
from Tallahassee to Miami, in the coming 
months. 
Sherer said the restaurant’s target audi-
ence is millennials, with college towns acting as a major draw for its new locations.
Ken Peng, owner of food blog Ken Eats 
Gainesville, said it is still to be seen if Blaze will match up to the other local pizza places.
“Blaze would be the first pizza joint that 
really allows the customer to customize piz-zas exactly how they want,” he said. “For better or worse, more variety is a healthy thing.”
Peng said he expects the concept will 
appeal to college students who are fans of other assembly-line restaurants, like Chipo-tle Mexican Grill and Moe’s Southwest Grill. Still, he said he feels artisanal Italian pizza “is 
an art that should be left to chefs.”
“It’ll stick around if only for the opportu-
nity to pile nothing but meat onto a pizza,” 
Peng said. “Someone’s going to do it.”Build-your-own pizza chain, Blaze Fast Fire’d 
Pizza, will debut in Gainesville in DecemberVive Delivery will caffeinate on the go Mondays through Fridays

About 200 people traveled to a garage 
sale at the UF Institute of Food and Agri-
cultural Sciences Extension Bookstore on Wednesday to buy donated household items.
The department made about $800 dur-
ing the event, which lasted from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. All of the proceeds from the items provided by the IFAS Communications Services employees will be donated to the UF Campaign for Charities, said Pam Bobilin, IFAS communications services special events and projects planner.
“We’re really excited,” Bobilin said. 
“We thought we’d get around $500, but we just didn’t know what to expect.”
Bobilin said more than half of the 
3,000 total items including glassware, books, used clothes, board games and small kitchen appliances, were sold. The unsold items will be donated to Haven 
Hospice, she said.
More than 30 IFAS Communications 
Services employees donated goods to the 
garage sale. Bobilin said the department began asking for donations at the begin-ning of the month.
Eliana Pabon, a UF telecommunica-
tion senior, is an intern with IFAS Com-munications Services. Pabon, 22, said she 
came to support the event and check out 
the items for sale.
“I think that this is a great event and is 
for a great cause,” Pabon said. “It seems 
like they sold a lot of stuff.”Charitable

A Gainesville woman was ar-
rested Tuesday after police said 
she poked the father of her child on the shoulder with a knife, cut up his bed sheets and destroyed 
his laptop.
At about 9 a.m., Kiara Shan-
drea Sharde Cray went into the 
victim’s apartment. 
She and the victim had been 
in a relationship for about three years and have a 1-year-old son together. They split about a month ago, according to a re-port.
After en-
tering the 
a p a r t m e n t 
at 2044 SW 
66th Drive, the 23-year-old grabbed a large knife, cut up the 
victim’s bed sheet, tapped the victim on the forearm and poked 
him on the left shoulder with the 
knife.
“Where do you want it?” 
Cray said to the victim. “Do you want me to stab you in the throat, cut off your d**k or stab you in the ribs?”
She also told their child, “Son, 
go into your room. I am going to kill your daddy.”
Cray grabbed the victim’s 
laptop — a Toshiba — and threw it, causing the screen to crack and $150 in damage.
Cray was arrested on charg-
es of aggravated domestic bat-
tery and criminal mischief.
She was released Wednes-
day afternoon on a $6,000 bond.

ColumnScott’s handling 
of execution is 
telling of ofﬁ  ce
On Tuesday night, Florida Gov. Rick Scott and Democratic 
challenger Charlie Crist squared off in their third and ﬁ  -nal debate.
One of the debate’s most heated moments came during a dis-
cussion about the execution of Marshall Lee Gore. A convicted 
rapist and murderer, Gore was put to death Oct. 1, 2013.
Gore’s execution was originally supposed to take place in 
June of that year. However, legal concerns over Gore’s sanity 
resulted in Scott postponing the execution until Sept. 10.
After the date in September was chosen, Florida Attorney 
General Pam Bondi requested that Scott postpone the execution once again. The reason for Bondi’s request? According to the Tampa Bay Times, the date of the execution conﬂ  icted with Bon-di’s “’hometown campaign kickoff’ at her South Tampa home.”
Bondi apologized afterward for the postponement request, 
saying she “absolutely should not have requested that the date of the execution be moved.”
Ironically, Bondi has been one of the strongest supporters of 
Florida’s Timely Justice Act, which aims to ensure speedy execu-tions for Florida death row inmates. Apparently, timely justice is critically important unless Bondi ﬁ  nds it politically inconve-nient. During the debate on Tuesday, Crist pressed Scott about whether he knew Bondi’s reason for requesting the execution be 
postponed.
“She asked me to delay it because it didn’t work on the dates 
that she thought it was going to be on,” Scott responded. “She 
apologized.”
Scott claims he did not know the reason for the delay. This 
leaves two possibilities. The ﬁ  rst is that the governor is lying and did, in fact, know that Bondi wanted the execution postponed so she could hold her fundraiser. The second — and equally damning — possibility is the governor simply postponed the 
execution without being given a good reason. Such carelessness 
in matters of life and death is inexcusable from someone who wants to lead our state for another four years.
The controversy over the Gore execution is very similar to 
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s “Bridgegate” scandal. As a brief reminder, this scandal unfolded after revelations that Christie’s political aides intentionally caused roadblocks and trafﬁ  c delays on the George Washington Bridge as retaliation against one of Christie’s political opponents. Christie continues to claim he had 
no knowledge of his staffers’ actions.
Both “Bridgegate” and the Gore controversy demonstrate 
governors who are either actively involved in unethical and in-
appropriate political scheming or are simply ignorant of miscon-duct occurring right under their noses. However, because the Gore incident involved playing political games with a human life, Scott and Bondi’s malfeasance is far more despicable.
Florida needs leaders who demonstrate a clear and unwaver-
ing commitment to serving its citizens’ best interests. The mis-handling of the Gore case is just the latest evidence that Scott and Bondi are not those leaders.

ity?‘GamerGate’ latest in online harassment
On Monday morning, Monica Lewinsky joined Twit-
ter.
Lewinsky spoke at Forbes’ “Under 30 Summit,” 
which was geared toward successful millennials. She told the crowd about her plans to lead a cultural revolution against 
the Internet’s culture of harassment. She called herself “Pa-
tient Zero,” because after the scandal in which she was im-plicated as Bill Clinton’s alleged mistress, she was harassed through chain emails and on message boards. Lewinsky was inspired to speak out about online harassment after Rutgers University student Tyler Clementi took his own life. Clementi was driven to suicide in the wake of harassment he received when his roommate posted video taken in secret of him and another man kissing on the Internet. In an effort to “give pur-
pose to (her) past,” Lewinsky started her campaign.
Within hours of Lewinsky joining Twitter, people began 
harassing her, vilifying her again for her role in the late ‘90s 
scandal, as if it doesn’t take two to tango and that her past indiscretions completely discredit her as a voice against a malignant trend that hurts real people.
But this perfectly illustrates Lewinsky’s point. Online ha-
rassment has become expected — so entrenched that people accept it as one of the unalterable realities of life. The re-
emergence of a public ﬁ  gure of Lewinsky’s caliber is telling, 
because her “cultural revolution” is in sync with a new cul-ture war’s ﬁ  rst skirmish.
This skirmish is GamerGate and its surrounding contro-
versies.
GamerGate is a social activism movement that began in 
August when Zoe Quinn, who developed the critically ac-claimed indie game Depression Quest, broke up with her boyfriend. Enraged, he took to his blog and said, among other 
things, that Quinn had cheated on him with a journalist from 
the game site Kotaku. Quinn’s boyfriend claimed this was the only reason her game took off: reviews in exchange for sex. Outrage radiated from this story into the general body of gaming journalism, despite the fact that the story of the affair was totally unfounded and Kotaku never even published a review of Depression Quest.
Masquerading under the banner “Ethics in Games Jour-nalism,” supporters of GamerGate are patrolling social media and online forums, harassing anybody they deem subversive to their vi-sion of what the gaming commu-
nity should be. 
There are, of course, good 
people involved with GamerGate 
who hold legitimate concerns about gaming journalism, and 
their voices should be heard. In spite of these noble people with noble intentions, though, GamerGate has become a front for hordes of reactionaries. It has effectively become a massive act of pointing to the crudely painted “No Girls Al-
lowed” sign in front of the clubhouse and shouting down all 
who suggest otherwise with rape threats.
Demographically, these people don’t represent the gam-
ing community at all. Gamers are simply people who enjoy playing video games. That is a huge and extremely diverse demographic.
However, a small but loud segment of the movement 
sincerely believes feminists are in league with a progressive media establishment and waging a war on gamers and gam-
ing. Figures who have nothing to do with gaming are now 
using this vaguely right-wing, anti-establishment stance as a launchpad for their rhetoric against institutions outside of gaming. Everyone is entitled to their opinions, even if those opinions are barely veiled justiﬁ  cations to keep women out of gaming and maintain the precious status quo. Their toxic ideology gives those who buy into it an excuse to harass and threaten women and men to the point where they’re afraid to live in their own homes. As an example of this harassment, 
when feminist game critic Anita Sarkeesian announced her 
plans to speak at Utah State University, a man emailed the university and pledged to commit “the deadliest school shooting in American history” in response.
This is culture war in the time of the Internet. One can 
only hope Lewinsky will save us now.

UF alumnus Taylor Bomarito, right, proposes to his now ﬁ  ancee and 
UF alumna Keri Hoefer on the Gator Walk in front of Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium on Oct. 10 before UF faced Louisiana State Univeristy. The couple met when they were seniors at UF.
JASMINE WILDFLOWER OSMOND
Avenue Writer
Even though Gator football 
failed against Louisiana State 
University this season, a Gator 
grad won his sweetheart’s heart 
forever that day.  
Taylor Bomarito, a UF alum-
nus, proposed to his girlfriend 
of three years, Keri Hoefer, a UF 
alumna, outside Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium on Oct. 10 in a simple yet permanent way: a brick on the Gator Walk with the words 
“Keri, Marry me? Love Taylor.”
The couple met during their last semester at UF in 2012 
through a mutual friend while at the Salty Dog Saloon in Midtown. Keri said she knew within two 
weeks that they were going to be 
together for a long time. At the end of the semester, she moved to North Carolina for an intern-ship, and Taylor went with her.
The weekend of the game, 
they made the long drive from Raleigh, North Carolina, down to Gainesville to enjoy gameday 
with their closest friends. They 
went to Salty Dog early in the evening with family friends, and Taylor mentioned tak-ing a photo on the Gator Walk for this year’s Christmas card.
On the way there, he started 
talking about the bricks and how 
they are there forever.
Then, a friend pointed out 
their brick.
Taylor got down on one knee.
Keri was in so much shock 
that she didn’t even hear what he said. She knew he was thinking about proposing but thought he was going to do it during Christ-
mas with family.  
She was completely surprised 
when she saw the large brick.
Taylor had started thinking 
about proposing back in August 2013. He knew he had to do it in 
Gainesville, where they both had history. He imagined them in front of the stadium and knew it 
should be there.
He called brickorders.com to 
engrave the brick back in July. 
It told him that the deadline for 
the bricks was in June, and he’d 
have to wait until April to try again. He said he got lucky at the last minute, and his order was approved. Shelly Gulerandson, 
from brickorders.com, said the 
bricks on Gator Walk are never removed. 
From there, he started plan-
ning how to get together in The Swamp with their friends with-out raising suspicion.
Megan Lawrence has been 
friends with Keri since elemen-
tary school — she was even there 
the night they met. Taylor told her about his plan at the end of July, and her job was to gather 
mutual friends at the game and 
keep Keri in the dark.
“I don’t even know how I kept 
that secret,” Megan said. For now, the couple is planning on 
moving back to Florida. While 
there’s no solid arrangement yet, the couple is planning to get mar-ried in about a year, Keri said.

A cookbook can be considered 
an autobiography. 
The very title of early Ameri-
can food writer M. F. K. Fisher’s 
“The Gastronomical Me” suggests 
that to write about food is to write 
about oneself. Her collection of 
essays, which depicts events from her childhood, her life in France, 
the beginning of World War II, 
the ending of her ﬁ  rst marriage 
and the suicide of her second husband, are told through a culi-nary lens. The embedded recipes 
suggest a cookbook but one that 
is more than a list of ingredients 
and instructions. 
Cookbooks as autobiographies 
tell personal stories and are a tes-
timony of one’s existence. Simply 
by writing one’s name on the ﬁ  rst 
page of a book is an act of auto-biographical writing.Writing about food is 
a way to record one’s life, giving permanence to the ﬂ  eeting pleasures of eat-
ing and the value of cook-
ing. In composing reci-
pes, cookbook authors jot 
down notes in the margins, store paper ephemera like grocery lists 
and magazine articles and save 
photos between the pages of the 
cookbook. As a result, cookbooks 
become a hybrid of written forms: a diary, a journal, a travelogue, an 
essay and a scrapbook. 
As personal narratives, cook-
books connect food and the self 
in a textual representation, telling how we come to be the people we 
claim to be through writing the 
stories and recipes of our lives. 
Cookbook writers self-conscious-
ly shape their identities by select-ing memories and preserving 
them in images and recipes. 
Yet, cookbooks are not bound to a chronological se-
quence. Instead, recipes 
are like distinct, frag-mented life events made 
whole and coherent in a 
cookbook.
Cookbooks are evi-
dence of one’s life and commu-nity participation, as they are 
documentations of eating practic-
es and food trends. A cookbook 
isolated from its author and time 
period cannot be properly under-stood, nor can recipes isolated 
from their origins. Like Benedict 
Anderson’s “imagined commu-
nities,” there is a sense of com-
munity in cookbooks because a non-space-bound comradeship 
is built based on shared interests 
and values between the author 
and reader.
Returning to “The Gastronom-
ical Me,” Fisher explains why 
she writes about food: “(W)hen I 
write of hunger, I am really writ-ing about love and the hunger for 
it … and then the warmth and 
richness and ﬁ  ne reality of hun-ger satisﬁ  ed … and it is all one.” 
Through her own discrete “I,” 
Fisher represents other intangible 
hunger pains we all share. 
Like Fisher, cookbook writers-
slash-autobiographers are com-
pelled to write their recipes and 
experiences of food, driven by 
emotional and social hunger for 
love, attention and acceptance. Other urges, such as the need 
for deﬁ  ning a personal and col-
lective identity, are also met in 
cookbooks. Gabrielle Hamilton’s 
“Blood, Bones & Butter” offers a contemporary version of cook-
books-cum-memoirs that trace 
their development as women and 
professionals. 
Personal twists to a traditional 
dish allow one to leave his or her 
mark and seasonings at the kitch-
en table and beyond. Your cookbook is more than simply your recipes cuisine

The dramatic how-to videos 
of the ‘90s, such as a McDonald’s 
training video and a 1997 instruc-tional video “How to Have Cyber-sex on the Internet,” will come alive 
this weekend.
Curators Nick Prueher and Joe 
Pickett will host the Found Foot-
age Festival (FFF) for the second time in Gainesville on Sunday at 9 p.m. at the High Dive, 210 SW Second Ave. 
“Formats may change, but stu-
pid ideas are here to stay.”
That’s the reason 38-year-old 
Joe Pickett gave as to why he and 
his business partner decided to dig around thrift stores, garage sales and dumpsters across the nation 20 years ago: to ﬁ  nd old, random videos.
 The small town Wis-
consin boys, who met in sixth grade, have compiled 
a variety of VHS clips since 
their high school days. 
“It feels like this was 
kind of an inside joke that 
now other people got let in on,” 
said Prueher, 38.
In April 2004, they debuted their 
ﬁ  rst show in New York City and have gone on to sell out of hun-dreds of shows each year across the U.S. and Canada — they’ve also recently gone international. The 
showcase consists of 15 videos, each 
about 3 minutes long, accompanied by their critiques and commentary on their scavenger hunt.
Initially, it was just a hobby. 
“There wasn’t a lot happening 
in the city of Eau Claire,” Prueher said. “We wanted to make 
ourselves and our friends laugh.” 
Then it was just a matter 
of timing.  
Prueher studied elec-
tronic media at the Univer-sity of Wisconsin with Pick-
ett and became heavily involved in comedy. He has written for the satirical online news outlet, “The Onion,” with Pickett.
Some of the people who show 
up on the videos have actually been invited to attend the FFF shows to reunite and reminisce with others.
Pickett said videos share a uni-
versal language.
“Everybody can relate to stupid 
videos,” he said.

for purchase at foundfootagefest.

The fall music festival season is 
kicking off strong in Central Florida 
in the coming weeks, and the small town of Waldo is once again bringing back bluegrass.
The Dixieland Music Park Fall 
Bluegrass Festival will start Monday and run through Nov. 2 at the Dix-ieland RV Park with a lineup that 
enlists the talents of acts such as The 
Boxcars, Goldwing Express and MC 
Jo Odom.
Organized by Ernie and Debi Ev-
ans, the festival marks only one of 
several ventures the married couple 
helms. Leading their company, Evans 
Media Source, they also tour the U.S. as The Florida State Bluegrass Band.
This year marks the sixth year of 
the festival, which debuted in 2009.
Unlike other music festivals, the 
event balances live music performanc-es with a seemingly endless supply 
of dining events. The most notable of these events oc-curs on Monday with a full-blown, smoked-rib din-ner.
“(My fam-
ily) looks forward to the food,” said Gainesville resident Mary Jacobs. “It helps us meet new friends and fami-lies and give the festival a more inti-mate setting.”
This will be the third year the Ja-
cobs family has attended the festival.
“We have seen (The Florida State 
Bluegrass Band) many times and love everything the Evans do for the com-munity of Waldo,” Jacobs said.
The intimate atmosphere of the 
festival can also be seen in activities such as the “Face-2-Facebook” event, which shows attendees how to con-nect to new friends via social media platforms.
“All of the activities we have from 
the time our guests arrive until the time they leave are about building relationships in every corner of our festival,” Ernie said.
This year marks new innovations 
for the Dixieland RV Park venue. Unlike many camping festivals, the camping sites for the bluegrass festi-val now feature outlets for electrical appliances. A heated pavilion also sits on site, ensuring performances will occur rain or shine.
Tickets can still be purchased on 
evansmediasource.com. Advance tickets cost $47, and tickets will be available the day of the festival. Sin-gle-day tickets can also be purchased for various prices.

Gator Growl just brought two headlin-
ing musical acts to Gainesville, but concert 
addicts can see even more this weekend at the Coral Skies Music Festival.
Organized by Live Nation Florida, 
Coral Skies will take place Saturday at the MidFlorida Credit Union Amphitheater in Tampa and Sunday at the Cruzan Amphi-theatre in West Palm Beach.
Cage The Elephant, Manchester Orches-
tra and Julian Casablancas (lead singer of The Strokes) and his backing band The Voidz will headline. Acts rounding out the bill include Bleachers, City and Colour and UF J-School alumnus Benjamin Booker.
“Our main goal was to give fans of the 
indie and alternative rock genres a chance to spend all day seeing awesome bands for 
a low ticket price,” said Live Nation Flor-
ida President Neil Jacobsen. “We feel the lineup has a great mix of acts. Everyone on the bill is going to put on a great show and 
we can’t wait.”
Along with the music 
lineup, Coral Skies boasts 
an impressive selection of food trucks, craft beer 
and local art.
“For the price of a nor-
mal concert at a club ven-
ue, you can see 12 acts with no overlap,” Jacobsen said. “Then there are the many 
food trucks, craft beers and local artists showcasing their work.”
The new festival’s name comes from 
the original name of the Cruzan Amphi-
theatre in West Palm Beach. Coral Skies 
also debuts a few months after Live Na-tion brought the Big Guava Music Festival to Tampa.
Jacobsen said he wishes to give attend-
ees a great experience and create an annual festival for Florida music lovers to enjoy.
“The goal with any event is to give the 
fans an experience they’ll remember and 
cherish for a long time,” he said. “Hope-
fully doing that will allow us to grow but keep the value the same year in and year out.”
Tickets can be purchased on Live Na-
tion’s website. Regular admission tickets are $40.50 after service fees, and pit access tickets are $70 after service fees. Although VIP tickets are sold out, Live Nation is of-
fering a four-pack ticket deal with each 
ticket priced at $31.50. Parking is sepa-rate.10, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, OCTOBER 23, 2014

Writer and director Justin Simien’s new 
film, “Dear White People,” is a hilarious sat-
ire of racial politics and a welcome breath of fresh air. While the movie has its flaws, it is funny, pointed, honest and something we haven’t seen in recent modern films.
The movie follows the lives of four black 
Ivy League students at the fictional Win-chester University. The main character, Sa-mantha White, played by Tessa Thompson, has a radio show called “Dear White Peo-ple,” where she calls out white people for actions she sees as racist. Samantha receives opposition from other students of all races: Some of the students feel that she takes things too far in claiming racial divides.
During the movie’s climax, there’s a party 
at Winchester: a blackface party that proves Samantha’s point that racism still exists. UF is even featured during the closing credits, with a photo from the 2012 blackface inci-dent at an off-campus party that threw frat boys into national news.  
Simien’s screenplay is a parody that 
makes the viewer laugh and, more impor-tantly, think. Part of what makes this movie so refreshing is that the characters feel like real people and not caricatures or stereo-types. At one point, Samantha laments the “homogenization of black people” in mov-ies and television. Coincidentally, the char-acters in “Dear White People” are nuanced and have distinct personalities. In other words, the people populating Simien’s film are the opposite of the portrayals Samantha complains about.  
The interesting thing 
about this movie is that it doesn’t offer a tidy solu-tion for ending racism, nor does it provide a clear defi-nition of what racism actu-ally is. Several of the char-acters think Samantha’s 
radio show is racist toward white people, though the film clearly depicts the opposite regarding incidents at Winchester.  
The movie stumbles briefly, only to come 
back for a thoroughly satisfying conclu-sion that redeems any faults the film has. There are a few gags that don’t land, and the opening 10 minutes is a barrage of jokes, exposition and title cards that are initially disorienting. But once the movie settles in — which it quickly does — it’s actually a re-ally good time. It may make you squirm a little or feel a sense of guilt, but this is defi-nitely a movie worth your time.  
‘Dear White People’ is relief from racial stereotypes in moviesfilm

Alligator Writer @LFTorresIII
Billy Horschel and Sean Foley are two of 
the best in the world when it comes to golf.
They are at the top of the line when it 
comes to their craft. Horschel is the reigning 
FedExCup champion on the PGA Tour, while 
Foley is known around the world as one of the 
best golf instructors.   
The two of them also have a connection to 
the Florida men’s golf program, although it’s distinctly different for both.
For Horschel, it’s simple. He is a University 
of Florida alum and was a three-time first-team All-American on the golf team under the tutelage of former Gators coach Buddy Alex-ander.
For Foley, his connection to the program 
lies with coach J.C. Deacon, as they both grew up practicing on the same course in their na-tive Canada.
Both Horschel and Foley had a chance to 
sit down with the team during their time off between the second and third tournaments.
The team met with Foley when it traveled 
to Arnold Palmer’s Bay Hill Club & Lodge in Orlando for practicing and qualifying. 
Foley shared his experiences working with 
some of the game’s best.
Deacon said the team was able to absorb a 
lot information from talking with Foley.   
“They got to ask him a bunch of questions, 
it was a phenomenal experience,” Deacon said. “From that I’ve seen a lot of motivation, the guys have been working harder, working smarter, spending their time in more precise areas.”Players on the team like senior J.D. Tom-
linson have high praise for Foley. Tomlinson wrote a note to Foley after the meeting about what he learned from talking to him.   
“He is the most single fascinating person 
I’ve ever met in my life,” Tomlinson said. 
“He talked to us for three hours in the ho-
tel lobby and I wish he could’ve talked more. I learned so much information in that time frame it was unbelievable.”
About a week after meeting with Foley in 
Orlando, the team got the chance to talk to Horschel, who was in Gainesville as he was going to be honored at the LSU-Florida foot-ball game. 
Horschel brought along with him the Fe-
dExCup and left it at the Mark Bostick Club-house for display.
The team had a chance to see that even 
though Horschel achieved tremendous suc-cess on the PGA Tour this year, his fervor for the program still runs deep.  
“He’s one of the most passionate Gators 
I’ve ever met,” Deacon said. “I think the guys 
really saw that you know, he just made 12 mil-
lion bucks this year and won all of these PGA Tour tournaments, but being a Florida Gator still means so much to him.”
Even though Horschel is busy playing his 
own tournaments on the Tour, he manages to keep up with the team and how it’s perform-ing in every tournament.
“He knows the guys names, he knows their 
scores, he knows who’s playing well, who’s not,” Deacon said. “I think that had an impact on them that ‘holy smokes this guy is the big-gest thing in golf right now, but he’s still pay-ing attention to what we’re doing.’”
As the Gators wind down their fall season, 
having the chance to talk to two high profile professionals in golf resonated with them. 
Not only can their advice work in the short 
term, as with Tomlinson, who tied his career-best finish in the previous tournament with a tie for third place. 
But it also has a chance to make the team 
better in the long run.  “I think it gives everybody more confi-
dence, they gave everybody more informa-tion, which should make us better,” Tomlin-son said. 
“Just meeting those guys and talking to 
them, it’s a cool experience.”

The seniors are the wise players. They’re 
the tough, know-it-all, been-here-before play-
ers that take the field as if they own the uni-versity. 
Sometimes, young freshmen and sopho-
mores are scared of the seniors; they’re in-timidating. But at Florida, this year’s class of seniors has left their mark here in nothing but positive ways.
On Friday, the Gators will celebrate senior 
night as they host Tennessee. 
This year’s class is the second largest in 
program history, with eight Gators saying farewell at the end of the season.
This senior class will be remembered for 
their performances and contributions on the field, of course, but maybe even more so for the way that they have impacted the program at Florida. Good, positive 
people will make any 
team better.
“I think they’ve really impacted our culture 
in a lot of positive ways,” coach Becky Bur-leigh said of the seniors. 
“I think the most important part is how 
they’ve been as people for this program, what they represent and how they represent us.”
Being such a large class this year, these 
eight seniors have been through a lot together and have formed the nucleus this season for what is such a close, tight-knit team. They have been leaders and mentors for younger players as well as great friends with each other.
Senior Annie Bobbitt said that she is be-
yond excited to experience senior night along-side the seven other seniors and redshirt junior Lindsey Cooper because they are all so close.
“It’s like flown by, not 
just this past year but the last four years,” Bobbitt said. “I know I can go to any of them and talk to them if I 
ever need anything, they’re the first people I call, I live with mostly seniors, so 
they’re like my best friends.”
Bobbitt also said that this senior class has 
done a great job of taking young players un-der their wings and showing them the ropes throughout their time at Florida.
“There’s so many different personalities 
between all of the seniors, they bring such a good variety to the team,” sophomore Meggie Dougherty Howard said.
“Different skills for on the field, but also energy they bring off the field and their lead-ership and just advice that they can give us be-cause they’ve gone through it for four years.”
Senior night is always an emotional night 
for all of the players and coaches, but also a happy night because the players are acknowl-edged for all of their hard work and dedica-tion for four years.
“Everything that you dread in the moment, 
I think you miss in the future,” said senior Ha-vana Solaun. 
“And so I think for me right now, I’m kind 
of already missing it and it’s still here.”
It’s never easy to hang up the cleats and say 
goodbye, and Bobbitt said she’s going to miss everything there is about playing at Florida and being a Gator.
“I think the number one thing I’m going to 
miss is just the friendships. I’ve grown so close to these girls over four years,” Bobbitt said.

UF Soccerin Wilson’s room, which is sepa-
rated from Harris’ by a bathroom. The two then went to dinner and returned to Wilson’s room. What happened between the time the two 
returned and when Harris bid his 
roommate goodbye at 8:30 p.m. is not explained by Wilson, but Harris claims the complainant came over to watch the LSU-Auburn game which started at 7 p.m. 
In text messages included in the 
incident report, Harris texted the complainant in a conversation begin-
ning at 7:32 p.m. to “Come massage 
me,” to which the complainant re-sponded “Haha. I’ll come chill with you for a lil.” Harris messages back “Whatever,” and the complainant messages back “Lol so no?” Harris 
then says “It’s up to you.” And the 
complainant says “Ite. Ill call you 
when I’m outside.” Harris responds 
with simply “ok.”
With the game turning into a 
blowout, Harris and the complain-ant went their separate ways, but shortly after midnight, the complain-ant texted Harris “Where you at?” to which Harris responded “Finna go out.” The complainant then texted 
“Oh ite. Im at rain.” 
Harris ended up at the Rain 
Nightclub & Lounge along with a 
group of football players.
At the nightclub, Harris said he 
consumed one non-alcoholic Red Bull and had only had one drink be-fore arriving at the club. 
After the nightclub closed at 
2 a.m., the group went to Waffle House, which turned out to be closed when they got there. They then went to a Kangaroo gas station and then got into a car with the complainant and a mutual friend (who was driv-ing) to return to Springs. 
Harris says in the incident report 
that the complainant came back to 
his room — both individuals live in 
UF’s Springs Residential Complex, but in separate buildings — and they laid together on his bed. Har-ris said they had plans previously to hang out together after going to the club.
According to the incident report, 
Harris told Faroni that “he removed 
his shoes and pants and lay down in 
his bed.” Harris also said the com-plainant took her shoes off, put her purse down and lay beside him.
They began talking to each other and then kissing, and she began “feeling on me and everything.” Harris said while the two were in the bed kissing the complainant re-moved her own underwear and then the two engaged in intercourse. 
Harris told Faroni in the inter-
view that the complainant asked Harris if the sex was good, to which 
Harris said yes.
According to the report, Har-
ris said the complainant wanted 
to spend the night with him in his room, but he typically rests on Sun-days after Saturday games.
Harris walked the complainant 
back to her building, then called her to make sure she was “alright” at 
3:28 a.m.
Later in the day Sunday, Harris 
had a short text exchange with the 
complainant. He started by saying, 
“Don’t tell nobody bout nothing,” 
and the complainant sent back “And 
don’t ever try me ever again,” then 
“I wouldn’t even come near me if I were yu.”
The 54-minute, 43-second in-
terview is cut short when Harris requests an attorney. Faroni writes in the incident report that it was ap-parent Harris received a text mes-sage from someone advising him 
to no longer speak with him. Faroni 
discovered later that day that the person was his roommate, Wilson. The messages said “Tell (Faroni) you don’t want to talk no more. You want a lawyer.” Wilson followed with another that reads “Make sure he don’t see this.”

The complainant was in the 
Shands South Emergency Room at 12:49 a.m. on Oct. 6 when UPD Of-ficer Jessica Lynn Zarate responded to a sexual assault that happened the night before. In a private room with her father listening on speakerphone almost 24 hours after the alleged sexual battery occurred, she told 
UPD officers her side of the story. 
On Oct. 4 at approximately 11:45 
p.m., the complainant went with a 
friend to Rain, according to a police report. She said several UF athletes were also at the club. The complain-ant had “two rum and coke” drinks herself.
After they were finished at the 
club, the complainant and her friend, who drove, were going to head back to Springs. Harris — who the com-plainant described as a casual friend — asked if he could get a ride back with them, according to the report.
The complainant and Harris 
were in the back seat of the com-plainant’s friend’s vehicle while heading back to Springs. While on the ride back, Harris put his hand on the complainant’s leg, the com-plainant told officers. She then said she responded by telling him that he 
was “not gonna get laid,” according 
to the report.
Once they returned to Springs, 
the driver wanted to get something to eat, according to the report.Harris and the complainant did not want to go, according to the report, and the complainant’s friend asked Harris to walk the complainant to her room.
The two walked into Building 4 
of the residential complex and up the stairs to Harris’ room.
According to the report, the com-
plainant said she was OK with go-ing to Harris’ room at the time be-cause “she was not really tired and did not mind hanging out for a bit.” After time elapsed, the complainant 
asked Harris if she could stay the 
night, according to the report. Har-ris agreed.
The complainant, who had re-
moved just her earrings and her boots according to what she report-ed, lay on the side of the bed closest to the wall while Harris was on the other edge, according to the report.
Then, she said, Harris flipped 
on top of her and felt like “dead weight,” making it impossible for her to move. 
The complainant said she told 
Harris multiple times that she did not want to have sex with him. Ac-cording to the report, “she kept tell-ing him to get off of her and that she 
did not want to have sex with him.” 
The complainant’s father paused 
the conversation and asked to talk 
with his daughter privately, accord-ing to the report. When Zarate re-turned to the room, she explained to the complainant and her father their options regarding charges, accord-ing to the report.
After completing a sexual assault 
evidence kit, the complainant then continued her story with Faroni.
After initially telling Faroni the 
same story she told Zarate, the com-plainant added that she remembered her underwear being removed at some point while Harris was on top of her, according to the report.
“(The complainant) told Harris 
to get off of her and that they were just friends,” the report says. “(The complainant) said for five to seven minutes, Harris remained on top of her, using his body weight to hold her down, while she repeatedly told him to stop. (The complainant) said she specifically told Harris ‘I don’t 
want to have sex with you.’”
Harris then put on a condom and 
had sex with the complainant with-
out her consent, she said to Faroni. She told Faroni that she was unable to move and Harris remained silent throughout. 
After Harris ejaculated and threw 
away his condom, the complainant 
proceeded to put back on her boots 
and earrings and headed back to her room of the residential complex, ac-cording to the report. Harris walked her back to her room. She said it was about 3:25 a.m. on Oct. 5 when she arrived back at her room. Har-ris called the complainant later that night to see if she was still in her room, according to the report.

The girl (whose name was re-
dacted in the documents released) who drove Harris and the complain-ant back to the Springs Complex in the early morning hours of Oct. 6 wanted to get something to eat. Har-
ris declined to dine with her and re-
quested to be taken back to Springs with the complainant per the inci-dent report.
The girl said she heard the com-
plainant say “no, no I see you as a brother, I see you as just a brother. I don’t see you like that,” but she thought the complainant was mere-
ly intoxicated. In hindsight, she ad-
mitted to Faroni as well as Officer Bonnie Boland — who also sat in on this particular interview — that Harris may have been touching the complainant, but she couldn’t see anything occurring in the back seat during the drive.
When they made it to Springs at 
approximately 2:30 a.m., she said she thought the complainant wasn’t that drunk anymore and let Harris walk her into the building, holding her hand while he did so. 
The driver got food, then re-
turned to Springs and asked if the complainant was OK. Harris called her and said “well, uh, I don’t know 
if she’s OK, ah, she opened (her 
room) door and then she shut it again when I was leaving, so I don’t know if she walked out.”
The driver then said she called 
the complainant and asked her if  she was in her room. The complain-ant then replied by saying “yeah, I could have sworn I said no.” The 
driver asked the complainant to 
clarify what she was saying, and the complainant replied with “I think I said no.” The driver thought the complainant was intoxicated and said she’d talk to her in the morning. The complainant sent a text message that said “OMG (redacted) - I really have to tell you about Treon later 
(sad emoticon)”. 
But when pressed, the complain-
ant said she wanted to speak over 
the phone and not over text mes-sage. During a phone call, the com-plainant told the driver, “yeah, last night I think I had sex with Treon.” According to the report, the com-plainant told the driver that Har-
ris didn’t walk her to her room but 
went to Harris’ room, and then said “he jumped on top of me and I just remember repeating ‘uh, no Treon, I don’t see us like that.’”

Harris called wide receiver La-
troy Pittman and a woman named Shanndore Brown at 3:30 a.m. Sun-day to pick him up. They all then went to Brown’s apartment and Harris watched T.V. and talked 
about random subjects. Brown says 
in the incident report that Harris never spoke about anything that had happened earlier that night and the two fell asleep on her couch. Brown woke Harris up at 8:30 a.m. and drove him to Springs, then did not have any further contact with him, per the incident report. 
The next day after Harris’ initial 
interview with Faroni, the Univer-sity Athletic Association released a statement saying Harris would be suspended indefinitely.
By Oct. 9 at 11:35 a.m., Harris’ 
lawyer Huntley Johnson had issued a three-page statement in which they alleged — among other things 
— that the complainant had sexual 
relations with another individual earlier that evening and also said he did not believe Harris would be ar-rested or prosecuted and that they had gathered information from the Internet showing the complainant smiling and happy the day after the alleged sexual battery.
At 2:24 that afternoon, Boland 
received a phone call saying that the complainant had decided not to press charges on Harris as she pre-viously intended to. By 4:33 p.m. a signed and notarized complaint withdrawal had been returned to Boland. The next day, it was an-nounced publicly that the complain-
ant had withdrawn her complaint 
and that Harris was fully reinstated 
to the Florida football program. 
Florida head coach Will Mus-
champ declined to comment to al-ligatorSports through a spokesper-son on the release of the documents 
surrounding the alleged Harris inci-
dent, and University spokeswoman Janine Sikes wrote in an email link-ing to the documents that “the Uni-versity will make no statement.” 
Johnson released a brief state-
ment Wednesday saying “This has obviously been an unfortunate and traumatic event for Mr. Harris and 
his family, and for the young lady 
and her family. The judicial system and the University of Florida have both agreed to the appropriate reso-lution in this case.”THURSDAY, OCTOBER 23, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Without much height in the 
2013 season, numerous teams at-
tempted to create mismatches 
against the Florida women’s bas-
ketball team.
The tallest players barely 
reached 6-foot, and there was no 
legitimate post presence the play-
ers could throw the ball down low to.
However, the Gators received 
one of their strongest contribu-
tions last season from 5-foot-6 
redshirt junior Cassie Peoples.
Originally a transfer student 
from Texas, Peoples sat out her 
ﬁ  rst season at Florida due to 
NCAA rules for transfer stu-dents. 
She trained with the Gators 
and practiced hard to further de-
velop the game that she excelled at — ESPN ranked her the sev-enth best guard coming out of 
high school.
Peoples faced a signiﬁ  cant set-
back when she tore her labrum in 
practice and spent the summer 
rehabbing to hopefully make a contribution to a UF squad that was already deep at the guard position.
So when she 
ﬁ  nally hit the court last sea-son, Peoples 
was hoping to 
ﬁ  nally be past the injuries that plagued her for much of her bas-
ketball career.
Peoples, who was ﬁ  nally 
healthy,  played in every game for the Gators and started the ﬁ  -
nal 25.A scrappy defensive player, 
Peoples led Florida in steals, and 
was often responsible for guard-ing the other team’s best player.
She had the second most as-
sists of all Gators, proving that even if she wasn’t scoring herself she was positioning her team-mates to score.
Peoples – along with the rest of 
the Gators – is eager to show that last year was no ﬂ  uke. She’s itch-ing to start the season, to high-light how her talent has evolved 
from last year.
“I think we’re all just anxious 
to get on the court,” Peoples said. 
“We’ve been training all sum-mer, we’ve been training this pre-
season and we’ve been working 
really hard.
“We’re ready to show people 
what that hard work is going to 
do for us in the game.”With the team missing last 
year’s leading scorer Jaterra 
Bonds, Peoples and redshirt se-nior Kayla Lewis are expected to handle a majority of the scoring 
for the guards.
To improve offensively, Peo-
ples has worked on her shot, es-
pecially from the three-point line.
She converted nearly 30 per-
cent of her attempts from down-town last season, a number that should improve with the practice she’s put in.
She’s also worked on getting 
stronger — spending extra time with Florida’s strength and con-ditioning coordinator Tyler Stu-art — to avoid any more injuries 
that slowed the development of 
her talent.
“(Strength and conditioning 
coach) Tyler (Stuart)’s been really 
pushing our limits, seeing what our limits are, showing us that 
we have no limits,” Peoples said. “It’s been tough but at the same 
time it’s been really great.”
With training camp nearing 
the halfway point, Peoples has 
seen the hard work pay off. 
The team has developed chem-
istry with incoming freshmen and transfer junior Carla Batchelor, and depth is now a strength for a team that was often labeled short 
and lacking in depth.
“It was very challenging last 
year not having a lot of depth,” 
Peoples said. “We made it work, 
but this year we’re going to have 
a lot more people to work with.
“We’re going to be able to go 
in and out very interchangeably. We’re going to be able to play de-
fense for longer periods of time 
at a high level. We’re going to be able to press the whole game and have fresh legs in there, because 
that does play a big role in your 
strategy and it plays a role in how effective you are on defense.”
