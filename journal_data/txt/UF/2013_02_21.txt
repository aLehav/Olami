UF will have its sixth female Stu-
dent Body president.
Swamp Party presidential candi-
date Christina Bonarrigo and vice-
presidential candidate Joselyn Rivas won the election with about 66 per-cent of the vote.
On Tuesday and Wednesday , 
10,048 students cast votes in Student Government elections. This number is smaller than last Spring’s election, which had one of the highest voter turnouts ever with 10,644 ballots cast.
Bonarrigo and Rivas won the 
ticket by 3,180 votes. They beat out Students Party presidential candi-date Johnny Castillo and his run-ning mate, Jenna Goldman.
Swamp Party treasurer candi-
date Jayce Victor won the seat by about 66 percent of the vote, beating out Students Party candidate Billy Farrell by 3,232 votes.
A majority vote is needed to win 
a position, and the election codes do not list a need for a recount unless no candidate captures a majority of the votes.
After hearing she won, Bonarri-
go was surrounded with supporters jumping with joy.
“This is the most historic election 
in the history of UF,” she said. “I’m so honored and humbled.”
Supervisor of Elections Stephen 
Davis announced the winners short-ly after midnight. There were no technical difﬁ  culties, he said.
“I couldn’t be more proud of my 
team,” he said. “I was focused on making sure that every student who wanted to vote had the ability to do so.”
Rivas said she was happy for ev-
ery student who was elected.
“UF is the ﬁ  rst university that’s 
breaking all the boundaries, and I’m proud to be a part of that,” she said.

MARCH 14.

Six months after he didn’t appear in 
court for driving without a valid driver’s 
license, a UF basketball player was ar-rested early Wednesday morning.
The arraignment, which was sched-
uled for August, was a result of a citation issued by University Police on July 17 to Damontre Harris, 21, according to court records from the Alachua County Clerk of the Court’s website.
At about 2 a.m. Wednesday , a 
Gainesville Police ofﬁ  cer stopped Har-ris’ car after he ran a red light at the inter-section of University Avenue and Main Street, said GPD spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias.
The ofﬁ  cer ran Harris’ driver’s li-
cense and noticed there was an Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce warrant out for Harris’ arrest, Tobias said.
Harris, who transferred to Florida 
from South Carolina, is sitting out the season due to NCAA transfer rules. 
A University Athletic Association 
spokesman said coach Billy Donovan is aware of the situation.
After deputies arrested Harris, they 
booked him into the Alachua County Jail with a $2,500 bond at about 2:30 a.m., according to the report. Harris was re-leased at 2:44 p.m. on his own recogni-zance, a jail ofﬁ  cial said.
His arraignment is scheduled for 
March 14, according to court records.

A Canada-based website is looking for 
UF students to upload their course notes.
Notesolution has served more than 90,000 
Canadian university students through social 
learning and is expanding to the U.S.
Currently, Notesolution has more than 
100,000 documents, which cover more than 5,000 courses, according to the website. UF is not yet listed on the website.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said if in-
dividual student notes are uploaded to the site, it would not be a violation of the UF Student Conduct Code. However, upload-ing PowerPoint presentations and other speciﬁ  c instructions could potentially be in violation of the code because that is a pro-fessor’s intellectual property, she said.
“It depends on the situation and instruc-
tor directions in class,” Sikes said.
Kevin Wu, co-founder of Notesolu-
tion, created the website his senior year at the University of Toronto in 2010 with his friends Jack Tai and Jackey Li.“We can help new students and be 
able to provide course notes for them or if they’re looking for supplementary reading material,” Wu said. “It’s also a good way for current students to pass down their knowl-edge.”
Students who want a job as a notetaker 
for Notesolution would upload lecture notes on a weekly basis for a base salary of $50. Depending on performance and com-mission, student earnings could be as high as $500 a week, according to the website.
Wu said the website does not promote 
students skipping class because it is based on a credit system.
Students obtain notes by paying for them 
with credits, which are only earned by up-loading their own notes, he said.Site hopes UF students take note

Gator Dining Services plans 
to eliminate plastic bags in on-
campus dining locations.
It has implemented a new 
sustainability initiative to help reduce petroleum-based waste such as plastic bags.
Subway restaurants at the 
Reitz Union and Turlington Plaza have recently eliminated the use of plastic bags by intro-ducing labels that secure sand-wich wrappings, Jill Rodriguez, marketing program manager for Gator Dining Services, wrote in an email.
Although the restaurants  
will continue to keep bags on hand for customers who re-quest one, Gator Dining Ser -
vices is exploring options to replace plastic bags with paper bags at other dining locations, Rodriguez said.
Deta Waller, an 18-year-old 
UF early childhood education freshman, said the initiative is a great idea and will help UF to be greener.
Waller thinks the new pro-
gram will help increase student awareness about sustainability issues by sparking conversa-tion when customers inquire about plastic bags.
“It will make students more 
aware of the environment,” she said.
Waller said the initiative 
makes her proud to eat at a din-ing center that is sustainable.
Casey Seely, a 21-year-old 
UF English junior who eats five meals a day at Gator Dining fa-cilities, said he thinks the initia-tive is a good course of action.
“I think that going green is 
always a good choice,” he said.
Local nonprofits also support the new sustainability changes by UF’s dining services.
“We think that by doing this, 
UF is moving in the right direc-tion,” said Erin Condon, execu-tive director of Florida Defend-ers of the Environment.
She said it’s always a good 
idea to reduce the waste a big organization creates.
Worldwide, trillions of plas-
tic bags are used every year, according to UF’s Gator Dining Services’ website.
In an effort to reach UF’s 
goal of zero waste by 2015, the Green Team, which is in charge of executing sustainability pro-grams with Gator Dining Ser -
vices, has been investigating ways to minimize food waste in food service locations on cam-pus.
“We will ensure that our 
sustainability initiatives not only better the environment but improve our customers’ experi-ence when eating on campus,” Rodriguez said.

He’s tried to use a taco as identifi-
cation, threatened to kill the president 
on Facebook and when his cat was denied entrance to a strip club, he di-aled 911.
He is the Florida Man, the world’s 
worst superhero, hailing from “Ev-erywhere, FL.”  He first appeared on Twitter on Feb. 2 as @_FloridaMan, an account that chronicles real head-lines from around the state featuring the Florida criminals.
As of Wednesday night, the ac-
count had about 50,000 followers.  @_FloridaMan did not respond to a tweet for comment.
Bruce Floyd, UF social media spe-
cialist, said the account is likely not run by one person but by an aggre-gator, a program that collects specific types of information — in this case, weird news from Florida.
Floyd follows the account on his 
personal Twitter.
“I think certain posts of people do-
ing ridiculous things can be funny, certainly,” he said.
Hadar Arazi was introduced to 
the Florida Man on Tuesday when somebody she follows retweeted one of the posts on the account.
The 18-year-old UF political sci-
ence freshman said she found it inter -
esting people pick weird news from Florida more often than from other states.
Floyd said most news sites have a 
place for news that’s strange.
“I think it’s painting with an inert 
broad brush to say that Florida is the only state with dumb criminals,” he said.Twitter superhero lets

“I think that going

UF English juniorVictor said the win was not his per -
sonal victory.
“I’ve got a big year ahead of me,” he 
said.
Castillo said he wanted to thank every-
one who participated in the campaign.
“I wanna congratulate Christina, and 
I know she’ll do an incredible job as Stu-
dent Body president,” he said.
Goldman is disappointed, she said, but 
she has to respect the decision of the vot-ers.
“I’m surprised that the margin was this 
high, shocked actually,” she said.
Students also voted for student sena-
tors to represent their college or classifica-tion. Swamp Party won 37 seats, and the Students Party won 13 seats. The engi-neering seat was divided among one Stu-dents Party senator and two Swamp Party senators.
Students Party nominated candidates 
for 40 seats, and the Swamp Party nomi-nated candidates for all 50 seats.
A nonbinding referendum was also on 
the ballot regarding soft closings of bars. The referendum gauged student opinion on whether they wanted bars to close at 3 a.m. but stop serving alcohol at 2 a.m.
About 90 percent of the people who voted on the referendum voted “yes.” About 900 people opposed it, and no one abstained.
The Election Commission will hear no 
more complaints regarding the election, said Election Commission Chairwoman Brianne Lewis.The results of the election are not in 
effect until the Student Senate validates them Tuesday.

Underneath a massive, blue Americas Best 
Value Inn sign, streaming below a bridge on 
Southwest 13th Street, there is a narrow creek with an unusually green color.    
Tumblin Creek was once a winding stream 
with twists and turns. However, the health of the creek watershed has continually degraded, and the city is now working to rejuvenate it.
Gainesville City Commissioner Lauren Poe 
said since he’s been on the Commission, city resi-dents have wanted to see an improvement in the creek’s well-being.
“We need to fix up the system, so it works to 
keep the water quality high,” he said.   
Keeping in mind the ecological and economic 
risks an unhealthy watershed can cause, the City Commission has given the city’s Public Works department the green light to begin the Tumblin Creek watershed project, according to a City of Gainesville memo.
The project aims to reduce 
the concentration of harmful nutrients brought on after a city project in 1964 redirected the creek’s flow straight into Bivens Arm using a raised 
bank called a berm.       
Stefan Broadus, an engineer 
with Gainesville Public Works, said once the berm is removed, 
the creek will take its natural journey into the wetlands through Bivens Arm and eventually flow into Payne’s Prairie.                   
Broadus said the wetlands naturally treat 
the water, which increases the water quality to healthy levels by removing unnecessary nitro-gen and phosphorus quantities. This allows for aquatic ecosystems to thrive.
At this moment, the concentration of nitrogen 
and phosphorus is too high for a water body of Tumblin Creek and Bivens Arm’s size to control, especially after both bodies of water receive run-off from storm water, said Assistant Public Works Director Don Hambidge.
Hambidge said while some nitrogen and 
phosphorus content in the city’s water bodies is good, an excess of these nutrients speeds up plant growth.
Additionally, Plan East Gainesville, a commu-
nity-planned study funded by Alachua County and the city , reported nitrogen and phosphorus levels in the creek to be as high as 2.5 milligrams per liter and 0.7 milligrams per liter after a storm, respectively.
Hambidge said he attributes this large spike in 
nutrient concentration to the diversion of storm-water runoff from the wetlands. He estimates the project will be completed next year.
“Once the designs are finished, we can get 
bids to start construction in January and then hopefully finish by summer,” he said.    
Stewart Pearson, former stormwater manager 
for Gainesville Public Works, said this project would lead to better recreational opportunities in Bivens Arm and the surrounding area.                                                    
Even though the city has received several op-
portunities to fix the problem in the past, Pearson said the project will help improve water quality across the county .   
“If it doesn’t get dealt with upstream,” he said, 
“it will be dealt with at the bottom end.”4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 2013

High-calorie foods are getting the red 
light — literally — and Gainesville res-
taurants might be caught in the traffic.
Symbolizing the caloric content of 
menu items with traffic light colors had the strongest influence among all levels of health-conscious people, according to a recent study. It compared the intake of diners who ordered from a standard menu, a menu with the calorie counts and a menu with red, yellow and green lights representing items with high, mid-dle and low calorie counts, respectively.
Diners ate an average of 817 calories 
from the standard menu, 765 calories from the calorie count menu and 696 cal-ories from the traffic light menu, all at the same restaurant.
Dietician Laura Acosta, who owns 
LifeStyle Wellness in Gainesville, said the results of the study bring up an interest-ing idea: using symbols instead of actual numbers.
“The results don’t really surprise me, as symbols are quick visual guides that don’t require processing what the num-bers mean and calculating how the calo-rie counts might fit into one’s diet,” she said.
Ron DeFilippo, owner of The Swamp 
Restaurant, is also onboard with the traf-fic lights. He said The Swamp’s menus used to include calorie counts, but they have since switched to health symbols.
“The symbols work much better than 
a number,” he said. “People shy away from numbers.”
DeFilippo said he would be open to 
implementing the traffic light idea.
“I like anything that identifies some-
thing you’re doing,” he said.
But Gary Beuning, general manager of 
Peach Valley Café in Gainesville, doesn’t like calorie information — in either form — on menus.“I do not have any idea of the calorie 
counts on my menu,” he said.
Beuning said because the restaurant’s 
food is made-to-order, it would be too challenging to estimate the calorie levels beforehand.
He also thinks people don’t want to 
worry about counting calories when they eat out.
“They’re here for the flavor, not weight 
watching,” he said. “Putting those things on the menu is more confusing than any-thing else.”
Jacklyn Locklear, an 18-year-old UF 
exploratory freshman, said she tries to be health-conscious while ordering from a restaurant menu. She believes the traffic light idea would help her.
“It catches your eye because you’re 
drawn to colors,” she said. “It would definitely change the way I eat.”
The traffic light design is simple, and 
the study results suggested it helps peo-ple reduce their calorie intake.
“They provide an easy way to tell, at 
a glance, whether a menu item is high-, medium-, or low-calorie,” Acosta said.
Customers conscious of calorie count colors
The site allows document previews for accuracy
Credits can also be redeemed for perks like gift cards, ac-
cording to the website.
“In order for you to access, you have to contribute,” he 
said.
However, Wu said the website makes sure the quality of 
the notes are up to par by letting students preview 60 percent 
of the document before spending credits.
Wu said previewing the document lets students get an 
idea of the content and allows the option to give a document a thumbs-up or thumbs-down.
Kelsey Thomas, a 20-year-old UF applied physiology and 
kinesiology junior said she would be interested in looking at the site to back up her notes.“But I don’t know if I could trust other people’s notes,” 
she said. “I’d be concerned with how accurate they are.”
The website has documents for 39 U.S. universities, but 
a student’s university doesn’t have to be on the website for him or her to find useful information, Wu said. Students can get chapter notes by searching the name of their textbook.
“We try to make notes as useful across different campuses 
as we can,” he said.

P. K. Yonge Developmental 
Research School is bringing 
a twist of New York City to Gainesville this weekend.
The school, located at 1080 
SW 11th St., is putting on “In the Heights” for its spring musical and is one of the first schools in the country to do so, said school play director Carrie Kelsey.
The Tony Award-winning 
musical is based in Washington Heights, a predominantly D o m i n i c a n - A m e r i c a n neighborhood in New York City, and follows the characters through three days in their lives.
“The students have been 
begging to do it for years,” Kelsey said.
She said the production, which 
costs about $40,000, is the school’s only play for the year. 
It was completely funded 
through fundraisers, donations and ticket sales.
In January, students traveled 
to Washington Heights during P.K. Yonge’s annual New York City trip. While there, some attended a Q-and-A session with Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator of the musical.Raphael Llana, an 18-year-old 
P.K. Yonge senior, auditioned in September for the part of Usnavi De La Vega, the narrator and main character.
Llana said he can relate to his 
character because of their similar Hispanic backgrounds.
“Everything he talks about 
I’ve heard before, tasted before and smelled before,” he said. “He’s very intricate, and he doesn’t think like everyone else in Washington Heights does, which is how I feel here.”
The show will run Friday and 
Saturday at 7 p.m. with a 2 p.m. matinee on Saturday. 
It will also continue to run 
next weekend. Tickets are $10 for students and $15 for everyone else.THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Member of the National Aviation Hall 
of Fame and Gator alumnus Col. Joe Kit-
tinger spoke to about 400 students and faculty about his contributions to the Red Bull Stratos program Wednesday in the Reitz Union Auditorium.
Kittinger was a UF engineering student 
in the late 1940s. He made history when he went 102,800 feet into the stratosphere in a high-altitude balloon Aug. 16, 1960.
Throughout the last four years, Kitting-
er has helped the Red Bull Stratos program break his record, reaching new heights of 128,100 feet. Kittinger said it was first time someone jumped into space.
“With the media of today, the whole 
world was able to share in the excitement of the record,” he said.
In recognition of National Engineers Week, UF’s College of Engineering and its student chapters of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and U.S. Air Force ROTC invited Kittinger to share the highlights of the program.
“I remember watching him on the Dis-
covery Channel when I was a little kid and thinking it was the coolest thing,” mechanical and aerospace engineering freshman Giovanni Santoro, 18, said.
External vice president of the American 
Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Paul Chestnut introduced Kittinger.
“It was the most amazing experience,” 
the 21-year-old UF aerospace engineering junior said. “He makes me want to push myself further in my goals and career.”
Even after signing hundreds of auto-

The University of Central Florida sus-
pended all Greek life Wednesday after re-
ports of hazing and alcohol abuse.
The decision came a week after UCF’s 
Sigma Chi fraternity was also suspended for posting a Facebook picture with the cap-tion, “Forcing a pledge to chug while two others puke in misery,” according to Central Florida News 13.           
UCF fraternities and sororities are pro-
hibited from socials as well as new member initiations and are only permitted to hold organizational business meetings.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said she 
couldn’t speculate about what circumstanc-es would lead to a blanket suspension at UF.
“We would have to consider all of the is-
sues at hand,” she said.
According to the UCF Fraternity and So-
rority Life website, chapter activities may resume when the university believes the Greek community reflects the UCF values and is compliant with laws and university regulations dealing with hazing and alco-hol.
Albie Kaminsky, Interfraternity Council president and UF finance senior, said he was sad to hear about what happened.
“You never want to see something like 
that,” he said. “It gives fraternities and so-rorities a bad name. Actions by some can ruin it for many.”
Kaminsky said UF Greek life has taken 
measures to prevent hazing, like a presenta-
tion about hazing at the 
new members orienta-tion Sunday. Also, UF administration formed the Anti-Hazing Task Force in 2011 in the wake of issues at Florida A&M University.
Some members of 
UF’s chapter of Alpha 
Phi Alpha, a National Pan-Hellenic Coun-cil fraternity, were charged with hazing last year. Students were allegedly forced to do chores, slapped and beaten with paddles. Kappa Alpha Psi was also investigated. Most recently, UF’s chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon — Sig Ep — was closed for a num-ber of charges including hazing, according to Alligator archives.

Harlem residents not fans of the videos
“I can’t believe what the whites did to the harlem shake,” 
a post from Tumblr user fquemark reads.
After an explosion of replications of the “Harlem 
Shake” meme, in which a locked camera shot records a lone dancer and then cuts to many dancers waving their arms and improvising dance moves, the SchleppFilms YouTube chan-nel added a video (with much higher production value than any of the Harlem Shake videos to date, I might add) called “Harlem Reacts to ‘Harlem Shake’ Videos.”
Most of the people responded with disbelief, annoyance 
and anger.
At the end of the video, a few of the residents performed 
the actual Harlem Shake, a complicated dance involving con-trolled, isolated upper-body muscle movements.
“The dance in the video, to the extent that it’s a dance at 
all, isn’t the actual Harlem Shake, which has been an uptown staple for more than a decade. (See most of the videos by the former Bad Boy rapper G. Dep for a tutorial.),” Jon Caraman-ica, a New York Times critic, said in a review of Macklemore’s “Thrift Shop” and Baauer’s “Harlem Shake.” “The explosion of this song, and its accompanying videos, threatens to all but obliterate the original dance’s claim on the name.”
The Harlem residents in the SchleppFilms video reacted 
with similar frustration with the Internet’s bastardization of the dance. A few older reactors shook their heads and ex-pressed their contempt for the people who turned a cultural phenomenon unique to Harlem into a cash cow.
They’re spot on.According to an interview with Baauer in The Daily Beast, 
Baauer has been basking in the fame of the runaway hit after his song hit No. 1 on iTunes.
“That’s not the Harlem Shake at all, that’s humping,” one 
man said.
“I think they’re misinformed,” another said.“They look like they just smoked some dust.”“I feel like they trying to disrespect us.”“They don’t live in Harlem. They don’t come from Har-
lem. They come from a strange planet.”
“It’s an absolute mockery.”“It’s injustice.”“That’s a bunch of idiots.”“It’s just a shake,” one wom-
an said,  “but it ain’t the Harlem Shake.”
“That represents Jersey, Cali-
fornia,” a woman said. “That is not Harlem.”
The makers of the video asked 
people what they would like to tell everyone who made a Harlem 
Shake video.
“Stop, please.”“If you’re going to make one of these videos, please do the 
Harlem Shake, not just waving your arms doing the Sponge-Bob.”
“Stop that s---.”The ﬁ  nal frame of the video read, in white block letters, 
“Please use the Harlem Shake responsibly!”
Baauer said in the interview his song is not a homage to 
Harlem, which makes sense — the 23-year-old DJ only lived in Harlem for two years and then moved to Brooklyn.
He explained he named the track “Harlem Shake” after a 
phrase from a beat he sampled in the song.
Baauer spent most of his teen years on the mean streets 
of Connecticut, and his ﬁ  rst DJ gig was at the Toquet Hall Teen Center.
Nope, that’s not a joke; the guy who single-handedly 
pissed off everyone in Harlem is just a white boy who grew up in a state after Martha Stewart’s own heart and who now lives in a part of Brooklyn where scenes from HBO’s “Girls” are ﬁ  lmed.
Of course, in two weeks, when the pop culture machine 
belches out some other horrible trend for people to go nuts over, the Harlem Shake will be forgotten. In twenty years, when VH1 does an “I Heart the 2010s,” some comedians will reminisce about the silly, ﬂ  ash-in-a-pan dance. But the people who grew up with real hardcore Harlem hip-hop won’t for-get the punk who misappropriated their decades-old dance.

runs on Thursdays.Fightin’ Florida: 
We’re taking down 
Russia or something
Hold onto your seats, folks. Florida might have just 
done something awesome. It’s at the expense, though, of Russian lawmaker Vladimir A. Pekhtin.
“A senior lawmaker from Russia’s ruling party , who was also 
the chairman of Parliament’s ethics committee, resigned from 
the legislature on Wednesday over revelations that he owned more than $1.3 million worth of luxury real estate in Florida that he did not list on required disclosure forms,” reported The New York Times.
The ethics committee he was in charge of was part of the State 
Duma, a lower house in Russia’s parliament. 
“The Duma has been a hotbed of passionate anti-American 
activity recently, passing laws forcing organizations that receive funds from abroad to register as foreign agents, banning adop-tions by Americans and ﬂ  irting with limiting such Western in-ﬂ  uences as foreign ﬁ  lms,” according to an article by The Wash-ington Post.
The fact that the dude in charge of something pretty anti-
American owned a whole bunch of luxury property in Florida makes him look so, so bad. He left his position over this whole issue, all because a blogger from the opposition made allega-tions toward his property-owning status.
“Last week, Alexei Navalny, an anti-corruption activist, 
posted compromising photographs and property records show-ing Pekhtin’s name on the deeds to two condos in Miami Beach and another in Ormond Beach,” reported The Washington Post. “Pekhtin said the real estate was owned by his son, who lives in the United States, but both names were on the deeds. He soon relinquished the chairmanship of his committee — temporarily , he said.”
He said he had not broken any law, according to The New 
York Times, but that “‘there are very controversial documents that have been made public on the Internet,’ and it was necessary to clear up “‘obvious legal misunderstandings.’” How hysterical is it that Florida is again at the center of a political scandal? We didn’t do anything too bad this time, though.
“President Vladimir Putin has been trying to seize the anti-
corruption mantle from the opposition and has proposed a law prohibiting government ofﬁ  cials from having foreign stocks or bank accounts, although it leaves property ownership un-touched,” stated The Washington Post. Ha, good luck, buddy.
There are few things you can learn from the United States 
as a whole; an easy lesson is how to be corrupt in government. We’ve got this one covered. The opposition party or forces (basi-cally, the people who don’t always side with the government or with Putin) are the ones who are pro-anti-corruption. Russian authorities have frequently fought against bloggers like Naval-ny by bringing charges of fraud against those rebellious people.
Sorry Florida was so intriguing to your lawmakers that they 
didn’t list them on ofﬁ  cial documents. Sorry our beaches are just too pristine or that our Spanish food is sometimes on point. 
We realize we’re writing an editorial about a country that 
will never read this, let alone change their entire basis of policy on our small words.

For the past four years, Americans have been wait-
ing for the solution to the economy they thought would have come sooner. 
Four years ago, in his ﬁ  rst State of the Union address, 
President Barack Obama said Americans had to “answer 
history’s call” in the light of a potential “second depres-sion.”
This time, as he entered the House chamber and 
looked in the television cameras, he focused on the idea 
that creating middle class jobs must be the “North Star that guides our [economic] efforts.”
While there are many important issues that face this 
country, I was pleased the president brought up manu-facturing.
He said Washington must “guarantee that the next 
revolution in manufacturing is Made in America.” With the Republicans reeling and looking to ﬁ  nd support, Obama must strike a bipartisan agreement on the ﬁ  scal issues facing this country. Now is the time for Congress to ﬁ  nally make America a “magnet for jobs and manu-facturing.”
Though there have been signs of erosion, the Ameri-
can manufacturing industry is still one of the largest in the world. A January 2012 Congressional Research Ser-vice report found that America’s share of global manu-facturing activity has decreased in recent years.
China’s manufacturing sector is almost as large as in 
the United States.
One of the common arguments related to manufac-
turing thrown around recently is that American com-panies are outsourcing jobs to other countries because their labor laws allow manufacturing operations to be more proﬁ  table.
However, this is not as big of an issue as most Ameri-
cans think it is.
As the Bureau of Labor Statistics has found, the effect 
of outsourcing has been minimal. In the third quarter of 2012, when more than 100,000 workers were laid off, ﬁ  rms told the bureau a small percentage of these work-ers had their jobs moved to another country.
An article from The Atlantic reported that American 
companies are seeing the economic beneﬁ  ts of keeping jobs in America and have, in fact, started to “insource” jobs.
China’s Foxconn, the Chinese manufacturing giant, 
is actually planning on increasing their operations in the United States. American companies are realizing the beneﬁ  ts of keeping jobs in the U.S., which will limit the effect outsourcing will have on the economy.
On the other hand, what’s pre-
venting companies from produc-ing in the United States is the at-
tractiveness of production in other countries.
Part of the issue is the value of the dollar made pro-
ducing goods in the United States less attractive than other countries with cheaper labor, production costs and lower marginal tax rates. 
If America wants to become more competitive in this 
regard, the federal government must be willing to cre-ate a plan that provides subsidies and “lowers tax rates for businesses and manufactures that [will] create jobs right here in America.”
This would help reduce the costs of production in 
the U.S., which would make companies more willing to attract new jobs without having to reduce workers’ salaries.
One point Obama has been stressing is that increas-
ing our focus on alternative energy will make America a stronger manufacturing country.
According to the Department of Energy, in August 
2012, the wind sector was employing “75,000 American workers, including workers at manufacturing facilities up and down the supply chain, as well as engineers and construction workers who build and operate the wind farms.” 
People are now feeling the beneﬁ  ts of alternative-
energy manufacturing.
On top of providing jobs, it will help Americans save 
money on energy consumption. This is the direction the manufacturing sector is going. If we fail to recognize the importance of alternative energy, America will fall behind.
Manufacturing is what has driven America through-
out the past century. If we plan to give up on manu-facturing, we are throwing the future of this country away. 
But words can only go so far. This plan will not com-
pletely revive the American car industry or the steel in-dustry.
Although it’s not complete, President Obama’s plan 
will make American manufacturing industry more com-petitive than it is today so that we can be authors of the next great chapter in our American story.

The big day came and 
went: Valentine’s Day.
It’s a time of celebrat-
ing companionship or lone-liness, depending on your situation. It’s a day of broken expectations and extravagant surprises, depending on your luck.
The geeky shy girl prayed 
that the guy next door would ring her doorbell with ﬂ  ow-ers and chocolates — he didn’t.
The spoiled girlfriend posted a picture of the $100 
items her boyfriend gave her — she made us jealous.
The girl dating the “bad boy” waited to see her man 
in a suit and tie at a fancy restaurant — he didn’t even show up.
Every year, for every girl, Feb. 14 is marked on our 
calendars as test day. We give guys no choice. My barely single guy friends from around campus had the most dreadful experiences last week.
Here are some perspectives from my guy friends from 
different majors around campus:
Economics: “The money wasted on Valentine’s Day 
can solve the debt crisis. I’m always single, but I look for a date a few months ahead. Not too early. The price of the present she expects grows exponentially. Not too late. She’ll have made plans supporting her single and weep-ing friends.
But, as always, I ended up with my nerdy engineering 
friends. We bought beer and played Xbox all night. Bro-mance counts, too, right?”
Chemistry: “I’m busy trying to get into med school; if 
not, dentistry . Then, pharmacy and law school as a last resort. I have no time for a girlfriend.
My engaged friend created an account for me on www.
OkCupid.com, but the girls there are after my prestigious degree and future. Maybe I’m bitter because he starts sav-ing months in advance for his high school sweetheart.  He’s too busy and poor to afford the necessities: football games and drinks at Balls.
The only thing he talks about is what expensive pres-
ents he should buy her and what the look on her face will be. He lives for the words, ‘I love you. You’re a keeper.’ After six years of dating, he is still afraid of losing her. Bet-ter to be single than that insecure, right?”
French and music: “Chicks dig musicians and French 
men. I’m not really French, but my great-great-grandpa was German. That counts.
I’m classy , and I didn’t take her to the typical romantic 
dinner. Actually, I tried to make a reservation too late. We went on a picnic, and I played her a French song with my guitar. It was barely French. She loved it anyway.
Then, I surprised her with a bottle of Châteauneuf-du-
Pape, a red wine I can’t really pronounce. The taste was unbearable, but she pretended to like it, and together we got drunk. I puked and got stopped by the cops for driv-ing under the inﬂ  uence. Hmmm…worth it?”
Journalism guy: “I’m not a conformist, and I totally 
didn’t enter the holiday aisle at Walgreens. But I did try to get laid by a girl in my newspaper editing class. I’ve known her since she cried in reporting.
There’s too much fuss about Valentine’s Day , but this 
was my chance. I make such a big deal of everything, from grammar to girls. I decided to just ask her out next month. I’m more cool and casual than a follower anyways. Wait, I’m never getting married. What’s the point?”
Mechanical engineering: “There are only three girls 
in my thermodynamics class. The odds are in my favor that she’d be mine. I’ve let her cheat off me on every exam since sophomore year. She loves my intelligence, and she owes me anyway. Or so I thought.
I borrowed my roommate’s BMW and showed up at 
her dorm room. I obnoxiously overdressed, gave a canned speech and handed her roses. She started laughing.
I looked behind her and saw a shirtless guy. They’re 
probably just friends, right?”

Team Koach prepares hamantaschen in a bake-off at UF Hillel on Wednes-
day. The cookies are filled with fruit, chocolate or other ingredients.
� PURIM BEGINS SATURDAY.
JACLYN ROSEN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Students got down and dirty in dough for the 
annual dog-eat-dog Hamantaschen Bake-Off at UF 
Hillel on Wednesday night.
Hamantaschen are triangular-shaped, jelly-filled 
pastries that are traditionally eaten for the Jewish holiday Purim, which begins Saturday. The shape of the cookies symbolizes the hat of Haman, the vil-lain of Purim’s historic story.
“We eat the cookies to remember that we were 
saved from this bad guy ,” said Melanie Miller, 19-year-old Torah Advancement Program treasurer and UF political science freshman.
Torah Advancement Program, the newest Jew-
ish grassroots organization, competed against Koach, the Conservative Judaism organization, and Kesher, the Reform Judaism organization.
For the bake-off, some cookie competitors de-
viated from the traditional jelly-filled recipes and showcased their creativity with flavors including Girl Scouts’ Samoa, cheesecake, Nutella and Marsh-mallow Fluff-flavored hamantaschen.
Koach took first place for its three different ha-
mantaschen filled with jelly, Fluff and Nutella.
“Our hamantaschen is just simple, and it’s the 
beauty in being simple. It’s a very traditional reci-pe,” said 22-year-old bake-off winner and president of Koach Stefani Pila, a UF psychology and history senior.
In the spirit of Purim, Hillel’s campus impact 
specialist Jeffrey Kaplan plans to build the world’s largest grogger.
The 27-year-old entrepreneurship graduate stu-
dent said groggers are noisemakers used as part of the Purim celebration, and his goal is to create a 5-by-8 foot grogger using brackets, swivel casters and screws. The original grogger is 3-by-6 inches.Bake-off offers sharp competition

Browsing the Internet and down-
loading apps just got a whole lot fast-
er for Gainesville residents and UF students.
AT&T announced Tuesday that 
their 4G LTE network went live throughout the city.
Company spokeswoman Michele 
Money-Carson wrote in an email that the network service will be available for about 40 compatible devices such as tablets and smartphones.
AT&T now joins Verizon Wire-
less, which expanded its own 4G LTE network last year, in providing the service throughout Gainesville.  LTE, which stands for long-term evolution, will speed Internet surfing and down-loading up to 10 times faster than 3G, according to the AT&T’s website. Gainesville AT&T stores have been anticipating the launch.
“We’ve been waiting for a while,” 
said Shannon Coe, assistant store manager at the AT&T store at 6110 NW Fourth Place. “We’re real excited that it’s here.”
Kyle Beckman, a 20-year-old biol-
ogy junior, has noticed faster down-loads on his iPhone 5.
“Browsing and downloading, Fa-
cebook, Instagram and Twitter are faster,” he said.AT&T launches new service

Three Oaks Mall restaurants 
will no longer serve customers, 
but they will soon be replaced with new establishments.
In the past month, the mall 
has seen Suki Hana, Lotus Ex-press and Great Steak & Potato Company, once prominently lo-cated side by side in the mall’s food court, close their doors.
“It was a combination of a 
lack of traffic and high rent,” said Amber Williams, general manager of the Red Mango on the other side of the food court.
A spokeswoman for the mall’s manager’s office said the restaurants’ leases ended with the beginning of the new year, and they did not renew.
She added that Charley’s 
Grilled Subs, Asian Chao and Maki of Japan are set to replace the old restaurants in the com-ing months.
The new managers, how-
ever, could not be reached for comment. In the meantime, mall employees and customers will continue to eat at the food court.
Farran Kountz, a 22-year-
old UF dietetics senior, works at the Abercrombie & Fitch store next to the food court.
“I buy my lunch every day I work, but the store closings have eliminated a lot of healthi-er choices,” she said. “The only place I can go to for healthy, hot food is Great Wraps.”
Vanessa Rodriguez, 30, said 
she isn’t concerned with the restaurants’ closing.
“I’m excited to try the new 
options when they open,” she said, “but I’m always going to go back to my Chick-fil-A. I love it.”

When UF cheerleader and psychology se-
nior Amanda Soule was told to do the “Har -
lem Shake” during the Florida-Kentucky 
men’s basketball game Feb. 12, she had no idea what it was.
The 22-year-old also had no idea that six 
days later, a video of the dance performance would amass almost 2 million hits on You-Tube, joining thousands of others like it. 
“I think it’s taken off because it’s just a fun 
thing for people to do, and it’s fun to watch other colleges’ renditions of the Harlem Shake,” Soule said.
The dance requires one person (Albert, in 
this video’s case) to dance solo to the heavy-bass track made by electronic music producer Baauer, while other dancers wait for the beat to drop before joining in, for a grand total of about 30 seconds.
In most of the videos, bizarre props and 
outlandish outfits add to the randomness of the latest viral dance craze.
UF social media specialist Bruce Floyd 
said the short length of the song clip and its two defined steps make it easy for people to duplicate and upload to social media.
“I think it’s easy to produce, and it’s easy 
to consume,” he said.
An underwater version of the dance per -
formed by the University of Georgia’s swim-ming and diving team, for example, is one of the more notable Harlem Shakes on You-Tube, with more than 21 million hits.
   “Facebook and YouTube and Twitter all 
make these things possible, but if something resonates with the right people, it can make things grow exponentially,” Floyd said.
In the UF video, Soule is joined by her fel-
low cheerleaders, the Dazzlers and Albert on the basketball court, jumping and jiving be-fore a sea of orange- and blue-clad fans, each doing their own dance move.
“Like anything, it’s a trend,” Soule said. 
“I think it’s popular because of its entertain-ment factor and the fact that it’s so easy to throw together.”
In addition to the “Harlem Shake (Flori-
da Gators Edition) LIVE” video posted by Florida Gators Athletics, plenty of other UF organizations are adding their own versions to the mix. More than 30 Gainesville-based videos appear after searching “Harlem Shake UF,”including Tau Epsilon Phi Fraternity, RecSports and Florida Competitive Cheer -
leading.
Jessica Watson, a 20-year-old UF public 
relations junior and Reitz Union Board En-tertainment Bands director, hadn’t heard of the dance either. That was, until a fellow RUB member suggested via social media the group make a video, following the legions of Harlem Shakers all over the Internet.
“Someone posted on the RUB Facebook 
group, and it kind of blew up,” Watson said. “They said we have to be a part of that — it’s too cool!”
On Feb. 13, Watson found herself dancing 
on top of a table in the office RUB shares with TRiP , surrounded by eight grooving RUB members, a dancing beaver and a cutout of President Barack Obama.
“I thought it was hilarious, and no one else 
wanted to be the first person to start danc-ing,” Watson said. And so, the Harlem Shake newbie fearlessly took one for the team.
“Maybe I was inspired by Beyoncé,” Wat-
son said. “I’m a big fan of her and her Super Bowl show. So sure, I channeled a little bit of her swag.”
Last Friday, telecommunication fresh-
man Giselle Ponce, 18, watched as hundreds of costumed students swarmed Turlington Plaza for a Harlem Shake flash mob.
“All the people that were dancing had the 
most ridiculous things on: gorilla masks, ba-nana suits, and Mario and Luigi costumes,” she said.
Ponce said the new dance craze was an-
noying at first, but once some people started doing it, the rest followed suit.
“I think it’s popular because it’s some-
thing weird, and everyone likes stuff out of the norm,” she said. “It’s entertaining and can make people laugh, and it’s one of those things like ‘Gangnam Style.’”
Even if people think the trend is irritating, 
Watson is proud of her club’s video.
“It’s a short time, but it’s a fun little thing 
to do,” she said. “You can be whoever you want for that 31 seconds.”

Dear Perfect Friend,
A lot of guys think that plowing a girl 
is the best way to make her moan — 
false. They rely on the reviews of their past partners, who may have been overly generous to avoid being rude. The result is a sexually ignorant and cocky man. That’s a problem for the future ladies who will have a useless head between their legs. Good sex is about communication. The reason you don’t know how to tell a guy that he doesn’t know jack s--t about vaginas is the same reason he may think he’s a sexual master. This is a waste of time for one-night stands, so teach this lesson to someone you think will stick around. Use dirty talk to guide your partner when he/she seems to lose track of what he/she is doing down there. Tell him/her what you want and where you want it. He/she should catch on. In the heat of the moment, guiding someone isn’t awkward or rude because the other person is only in your lady-land to please you. He/she wants to help you cross the finish line, so help him/her by lending an instruction manual.Dear Mediocre Advice,
I’m a girl who likes receiving 
oral, but there are so many guys who can’t seem to master the task. How do you kindly show a partner how to please you? I’m shocked that so many guys don’t know a damn thing about the fe-
male body.
Dear Friend,
Keep it casual. She wants the 
attention because she can openly flirt with anyone now. You should keep in touch, but she’s probably not ready for another relationship at this point, even if she says otherwise. Starting a long-distance relationship with someone you barely know is not worth it, and from my personal experience, a mistake. Stay friends.Dear Mediocre Advice,
I hooked up with a girl who 
just got out of a three-year relationship. Everything was very casual because she no longer lives in town. I like her, and she’s interested in continuing this, but I’m a massive opponent to long-distance relationships. What do I 
do?
Dear Friend,
You have a better chance at be-
coming a wizard than avoiding razor bumps. Just wax instead. The idea of a razor near private parts is scarier than wolf spiders. Dear Mediocre Advice,
I have been manicuring my pubic 
region for years now and still have not mastered how to avoid those unsightly shaving bumps. I’ve tried 
everything. Any advice?� THE BAR OPENED FRIDAY.

home was rented from Stage 7-KTV , a new private karaoke-room venue and bar that celebrated its grand opening Friday.

is open from 1 p.m. to 2 a.m. Monday through Thursday , from 11 a.m. to 4 a.m. Friday and Saturday , and from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. Sunday. 
Patrons can reserve private sound-
proof rooms with high-end karaoke equipment, mood lighting, microphones, a speaker system, furniture and a large screen TV . Stage 7’s bar sells snacks and serves alcoholic and nonalcoholic bever -
ages.
The venue offers varying sizes of 
rooms that can hold up to 30 people. Prices per room range from $19 to $119 an hour depending on the day of the week, time and room size.
Cecilla Padilla, a 20-year-old English 
and theater sophomore, was one of the girls singingat a birthday party during Stage 7’s grand opening weekend.
“It’s great for college students,” Pa-
dilla said. “Pricing wasn’t too expen-sive, and you can bring big groups with you.”
Founders Martin Elkins, a 24-year-
old UF business administration gradu-ate student, and Wei Fan, a 24-year-old UF alumnus, met at The Entrepreneur -
ship Club at UF in April of last year.  
Fan wanted to bring his knowledge of 
the Karaoke TV — abbreviated KTV — 
craze in China to the U.S. So, he partnered with Elkins, who has experience with Amer -
ican bars and clubs, to create Stage 7.
In Asia, Karaoke 
venues are more popu-
lar than bars are in America, Elkins said. 
“It’s everything you want to do at 
karaoke, but not in front of strangers,”he said.
There are more than 50,000 songs to 
choose from in several languages includ-ing English, Mandarin, Korean, Japanese and Filipino.
Jisoo Kim, a 20-year-old UF biology 
sophomore, said she often sees the ka-raoke bars on Korean news. The venues are extremely competitive, sometimes lining entire streets.
She has been to places like Stage 7 
in Orlando and Jacksonville with her friends and family for stress relief and relaxation, singing in both English and Korean. 
“It’s just fun bonding time,” she said.Karaoke bar harmonizes with

Sriracha, cheesy garlic bread, 
and chicken and waffles — they 
have more in common than being staples of a freshmen dorm diet.
Last week, Lay’s released the 
three new flavor finalists after 3.8 million people submitted their suggestions for the “Do Us a Fa-vor” crowdsourcing campaign.
I am a foodie. My palate is 
refined, and I refuse to taint my taste buds with these disgusting flavors. But having tried the non-potato-chip versions of these cu-linary creations, I am qualified to rip them apart.
Sriracha, a popular Thai hot 
sauce with a cultlike following, is the most promising option of the three.
Sure, it’s great on french fries 
or breakfast sandwiches, but is it really necessary to put it on ice cream or peanut butter sand-wiches? Yes, people really do that. (A Sriracha cookbook even exists — you can’t make this stuff up.)
Who knows, maybe Sriracha 
and potato chips will be a perfect match, but the combination could also be a blasphemous offense if the flavor doesn’t do the sauce justice. 
Of course, you could always 
cover them in more Sriracha.
Out of 3.8 million sugges-
tions, I feel there must have been something more interesting than cheesy garlic bread flavor. I’m betting the “bread” part of the equation will be nonexistent as the base is a potato, but the gar -
lic and cheese might complement each other nicely.
However, what kind of cheese 
are we talking here? There’s a clear difference between under -
tones of sharp cheddar and Chee-to dust. To be determined.
I’d really like to meet the per -
son who submitted “Chicken and Waffles” as a flavor. Even more, I’d like to meet the Lay’s employ-ee who thought, “Yes. This will be a good idea.”
Proteins are not meant to be 
turned into potato chips. Just imagine the unmentionable things they are doing to obtain “chicken taste.”
The bag features a drumstick 
with a pair of Belgian waffles, but in a taste test, The Huffington Post describes the flavor as like “cheap maple syrup.”
So, salty potato maple syrup, 
eh? I think I’ll keep the Aunt Jemima strictly for my pancakes.  
If you’re a potato chip lover, 
don’t miss this tasty opportunity to vote for your favorite via the Lay’s Facebook page, by texting VOTE to 24477 or by using the Twitter hashtags #SaveSriracha, #SaveChickenWafffles or #Save-GarlicBread by May 4. The win-ner will receive $1 million or 1 percent of 2013 sales, whichever is higher, and the runners-up will receive $50,000 each.
Overall, I think Sriracha has 
the most to lose, but if Chicken and Waffles somehow pulls it out, you’ll have to hand me a bag of them immediately — so I can throw up in it.Lay’s new chip flavors add zing

Want to become a Kend-
rick Lamar fan in time for the 
show? Drank, as the rapper would suggest.
Once you dive into La-
mar’s music, you’ll hear a wide variety of sounds, un-like other rap. His most pop-ular song, “Swimming Pools (Drank),”  is not all he should be known for.  
On Monday, Lamar will 
perform at the Stephen C. O’Connell Center. If you want to become a Lamar fan quickly, here is our suggest-ed playlist to prepare you for the epic show ahead:
“B---h, Don’t Kill My 
Vibe” (Album: “good kid, m.A.A.d city”)
Though the title may scare 
some of you away, the song has more to it than you’d think. It’s upbeat with a su-per-chill tempo — perfect for vibing anywhere. The mes-sage is to let people do their own thing and to stop put-ting others down (thus kill-ing their vibe).
“Money Trees” feat. Jay 
Rock (Album: “good kid, m.A.A.d city”)
Just got that new job in 
Gainesville and feel like cel-ebrating now that you don’t have to ask your parents for every penny? If so, “Money Trees” is the song for you. What’s more inspiring than singing “Money Trees is the perfect place for shade” over and over again to yourself?
“The Art of Peer Pres-
sure” (Album: “good kid, m.A.A.d city”)
This fast-paced song is re-
latable and great to listen to when you’re feeling socially pressured. Essentially, it’s Lamar’s commentary on life in the ghetto and how his en-vironment influences him to do drugs. It speaks truthfully in how an environment can make or break a person.
“HiiiPoWeR” (Album: 
“Section.80”)
One of Lamar’s most fa-
mous songs displays not only his diverse beats but his liberal ideals throughout his lyrics. The song discusses an important movement tak-ing place called HiiiPoWeR. The three i’s represent hav-ing heart, honor and respect for yourself, no matter what you’re going through. The song references the civil movement and applies Hiii-PoWeR to historic events.
“Hol’ Up” (Album: “Sec-tion.80”)
To make sure we’ve cov-
ered all of the bases, we’re go-ing to jump into some more of Lamar’s older music.
The song’s jazzy and un-
usual beat makes it deserve a prime spot on your iPod. Ba-sically, this song is Lamar’s version of Kanye’s “Good Life,” where he describes his life after he made it big. It’s motivational and calming, so it’s perfect no matter what kind of mood you are in.
“Now or Never” feat. 
Mary J. Blige (Album: “good kid, m.A.A.d city”)
To tie up your Kendrick 
knowledge with one per-fect, little bow, we proudly present the stinger, “Now or Never.” It’s a bonus track on the album, basically defining YOLO for us. It’s about in-vesting in the present because when opportunity knocks on your door, you don’t want to let it pass you by.
Now that you’re a Kend-
rick Lamar fan, you won’t be shunned by your friends for not knowing the lyrics dur-ing his performance. Tickets are available online for $17.30 (plus fees) on Ticketmaster and $10 with a Gator 1 Card at the University Box Office. Drank up.
Ear prep: Kendrick Lamar playlist12, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 2013
On the road to the Oscars red carpet, 
many ﬁ  lms are set on earning nomina-tions for the year’s top honor in mo-
tion pictures. A select nine are vying for the title of the year’s Best Picture. 
For Avenue writers Joe Morgan and Al-
yssa Holcomb, two movies honed in on the Academy’s most sought-after qualities.
Joe: Choosing one as Best Picture is no easy 
task. But, if I were stranded in a lifeboat with a hungry tiger or on the wrong end of Django’s gun and his steely glare, I’d throw my support behind “The Silver Linings Playbook.” The David O. Russell ﬁ  lm is a hilarious but touch-ing look at real, relatable people with real, relatable problems. The ﬁ  lm hits home with a compelling narrative, well-rounded charac-ters and razor-sharp dialogue. “SLP” may not be a favorite for the big prize on Oscar night, but it is undoubtedly the best picture of 2012.
Alyssa: While this year’s Best Picture nom-
inees seem more varied in their sentiment than in years past, it’s “Argo” that grabbed my attention the most. You’d think a declas-siﬁ  ed CIA story from the Middle East would be your typical awards show fodder, but the simple yet poignant performances on screen combined with director and star Ben Afﬂ  eck’s gritty, real coverage make it gripping.
Afﬂ  eck may have been snubbed by the Academy in the Best Director cat-egory , but as far as cinema’s top hon-or goes, “Argo” has secured not only the rest of award season’s highest accolades, but the respect of both audiences and industry professionals. It’s that rare, real combination of story and recognition that makes “Argo” the best picture of 2012.
Joe: Ben Afﬂ  eck’s failure to earn a Best Di-
rector nomination for “Argo” was the worst Oscar snub since “The Dark Knight” and “Wall-E” failed to earn Best Picture nomina-tions in 2008. Afﬂ  eck’s snub aside, Russell made the cut, and he deserves to win.
Bradley Cooper plays a man whose life is 
torn apart by his wife’s affair and complica-tions from bipolar disorder.  The material may seem like everyday fare, but Russell’s ability to transform the minutiae of a Philly suburb into a hilarious and thoughtful look at family and companionship makes “SLP” truly special.
Alyssa: Russell does make the mundane 
exciting again with some of his ﬁ  lms, but the risk-taking factor in “Argo” makes it the bet-ter candidate.That and the 
fact that Afﬂ  eck’s snub has only fu-eled the public’s curiosity , which provides a Hol-lywood buzz that strengthens its cause. Afﬂ  eck also pulls a “George Clooney ,” serving 
as both star and director — it’s rare that it hap-pens, but when it does (and is executed well), any audience is putty in their hands.
Joe: Afﬂ  eck is one of the few people who 
can pull off the actor/director combination, and he does so beautifully in “Argo.” But when I think about the best acting perfor-mances in 2012, I go back to “SLP .” Robert DeNiro, Jacki Weaver and Chris Tucker give ﬁ  ne supporting turns, but Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence demanded my atten-tion the most. 
In his ﬁ  rst real attempt in a dramatic role 
surrounded by veteran, Oscar-nominated actors, Cooper held more than his own. But my highest praise goes to Lawrence, who unquestionably deserves the Oscar for Best Actress. Her character has plenty of issues — including intense, unexpected mood swings — but she likes herself, and Lawrence con-veys her conﬁ  dence with incredible wit and a stay-away-from-me-but-not-too-far-away-because-I-kind-of-like-you charm. Her insane knowledge of Philadelphia sports in a scene with DeNiro is a deﬁ  nite winner.
Like Lawrence’s character, “Playbook” has 
heart and a wicked sense of humor. The dance scene with Cooper and Lawrence at the end of the ﬁ  lm is the best thing ever. “SLP” tackles everyday issues and relatable problems, yet it also provides a poignant escape from reality that few ﬁ  lms have achieved.
Alyssa: That is an undoubtedly talented 
cast, but the combination of all things cin-ematic in “Argo” make for the better compre-hensive choice. Combining the acting chops of Ben Afﬂ  eck, Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin and John Goodman makes for an intense and entertaining ensemble. They balance each other and the story well. Their interactions with each other provide a wide spectrum of emotions for people both on- and off-screen to digest.
For me, earning that Best Picture nomi-
nation (and, eventually , trophy) means that it’s more than just the performances. It’s the cinematography; it’s the costuming; it’s the score; it’s the direction; it’s the whole package. “Argo” has all of that and some of the most subtle yet fulﬁ  lling performances, and that’s why it’s going to take home the gold.
What film deserves to win Best Picture at the Oscars?

Freshman Mary-Sean Wilcox 
made five saves on six shots in Florida’s win against Stony Brook on Wednesday.Read story, page 18.
ADAM PINCUS
Alligator Staff Writer
When the game started, the Rowdy Reptiles were a 
group of 20. When Vickash Ramjit had a chance to win it 
in the ninth, there were 13. And when Georgia Southern finally won it three innings later, only 10 remained.
A season-low crowd of 2,759 saw the No. 17 Gators (3-
2) lose an 8-7 contest to the Eagles (3-1) in 12 innings at McKethan Stadium.
The crowd that grew quieter and smaller with each ex-tra frame saw 15 runs, 21 hits and six UF errors.
Sophomore right-hander Ryan Harris walked in the 
winning run in the top of the 12th.
“[On Wednesday night], we didn’t play well at all,” 
coach Kevin O’Sullivan said.
“You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to figure it 
out.”
Florida fell behind by five runs early but fought its way 
back to grab a late lead. After their rally, the Gators had three chances to win their fourth-straight game.
Closer Johnny Magliozzi was one strike away from his 
third save of the season. He had been unhittable in his previous two outings.
The sophomore had cleanup hitter T.D. Davis down in 
the count 0-2 with a runner on second.
Davis sawed off a signature Magliozzi curveball in be-
tween third base and shortstop for the game-tying RBI. 
Ramjit could have been the hero in the bottom half of 
the inning.
The bases were loaded with two outs and a tied score 
in the bottom of the ninth.
The senior struck out on an inside curveball to bring 
the game into extra innings. 
Florida played its first free baseball since defeating 
N.C. State 9-8 in 10 frames on June 10 to reach the College World Series last season.
Freshman Kevin Stypulkowski watched a fastball 
down the middle for the third strike with runners on first and second and two outs in the 11th.
Stypulkowski entered midway through the ninth after

Sophomore Justin Shafer swings during Florida’s 16-5 win against Duke on Sunday at McKethan Stadium. Shafer 
hit a three-run homer during UF’s 8-7 home loss to Georgia Southern on Wednesday night.
Georgia Southern outlasts Florida in extra innings

Alligator Staff Writer
Three days after losing to No. 13 
Georgia on Sunday, coach Amanda 
Butler silently reminded her squad of its inability to finish games in-side the O’Connell Center. 
Florida’s 62-57 defeat — its most 
recent loss — burned brightly on the scoreboard as the Gators began practice.
Close losses have deflated UF’s 
season, especially during South-eastern Conference play. The Gators, tied with Missouri for ninth in the conference at 4-8, have been plagued with an inability to finish games in the final minutes.Of Florida’s eight losses in the 
SEC, seven have come by fewer than 10 points. Only three of UF’s 11 losses on the season have been by double figures.
“ W e ’ v e 
lost these ball games by four points, five points, six 
points,” Butler said. “That’s two possessions, that’s three posses-sions that have got to go differ -
ently.”
Late-game execution has been 
problematic for the Gators. Florida struggling down

Midway through the first half, center Pat-
ric Young set a screen on Missouri’s Earnest 
Ross for freshman Michael Frazier II.
Seconds later, Young sprinted underneath 
the basket to block out the Tigers’ Alex Ori-akhi, anticipating a rebound that never came after Frazier sunk his jumper.
Young demonstrated his athleticism and 
speed on the play.
However, it was one of the few positives 
from the Gators’ starting frontcourt on Tues-day night in Mizzou Arena. 
“With our lack of depth in the frontcourt, 
we’ve got to be able to fight through fatigue a little bit better,” coach Billy Donovan said. 
“We don’t have the same rotation up front, 
and obviously that wears on you when you got a guard a guy like [Tigers guard Phil Pressey] all the time.”
After the Gators shot 29.4 percent from be-
hind the arc in the first half, Donovan wanted Florida to improve its post presence in the second half. 
Unfortunately for the Gators, they couldn’t 
get it done.
During Florida’s (21-4, 11-2 Southeastern 
Conference) 63-60 loss to Missouri (19-7, 8-5 SEC) in Columbia, Mo., both Erik Murphy and Young failed to find the net on 0-of-7 shooting in the first half. The frontcourt only scored six points before halftime, all of which came from junior Casey Prather.
Things didn’t get much better in the sec-
ond half for Florida’s frontcourt. 
UF’s post players combined for 17 points 
on 7-for-18 shooting. Without Prather’s per -
fect shooting, they shot 26.7 percent from Frontcourt struggles in defeatsee bAsebAll, p Age 19

After a Stony Brook narrowed Florida’s lead 
to 12-8, coach Amanda O’Leary took a timeout 
with 19:37 left in the second half. 
Watching the Seawolves trim a nine-goal 
deficit to four, O’Leary benched All-American senior goalkeeper Mikey Meagher for fresh-man Mary-Sean Wilcox.
Less than a minute after entering the game, 
Wilcox was tested. After Stony Brook’s Emily Mercier was left wide open in the middle of the field on a transition, Wilcox faced a one-on-one breakaway . Mercier shot less than 4 meters from the goal.
Wilcox made the save.“It was really exciting to get out there,” Wil-
cox said. “Having that initial save pretty much turned the game around for everyone. Every-one started to really pick it up after that, started to check back into the game.”
Thanks to Wilcox, the No. 3 Gators (4-0) de-
feated the 19th-ranked Seawolves (1-1) 16-9 on Wednesday afternoon.
The second shot Wilcox faced came off the 
stick of Stony Brook’s Claire Petersen, whose 101 points in 2012 set a program record. 
Blanketed by two defenders, Petersen forced her way to the 2-meter circle in front of the goal and fired.
Wilcox made the save.“It was incredible for Mary-Sean to come in 
and do such a great job,” said Brittany Dashiell, who led the Gators with four goals in the match. “It’s hard to sub in so quickly and then to come into the game and get right into it. And I think 
she did a great job. She had some nice saves for us.”
Wilcox also played dur -
ing the final 8 minutes of 
Florida’s 13-7 win against High Point on Sunday . She allowed three goals and saved four.
But against the Sea-
wolves, Wilcox was solid.
Stony Brook’s Hillier had two consecutive 
free-position shots in 11 seconds, but Wilcox held strong. She saved both tries.
After four consecutive saves by Wilcox, the 
Gators scored four straight goals.
Petersen slipped a shot past Wilcox with 
12 seconds remaining in the game. Despite the late blemish, Wilcox finished with five saves on six shots.

Lauren Haeger has first base cov-
ered.
Although the Florida sophomore is 
a formidable force in both the circle and 
the batter’s box, she always makes time to work on her fielding.
“It’s something that I’ve always 
done,” Haeger said. “It’s just normal to me.”
Haeger has split time at first base with 
freshman Taylor Schwarz this year.
During the Florida Lipton Invita-
tional, Haeger saw her first substantial action outside the circle this season.
Although both Haeger and Schwarz 
performed well in the field, their seasons have differed drastically at the plate.
Haeger is currently second on the 
team in batting average and a 1.195 OPS. She has hit two home runs and is tied for the team lead with 11 RBI.
Haeger’s production picked up when 
No. 5 Florida (12-0) came home to play in the Lipton Invitational. During the six-game tourney in 
Gainesville against unranked competi-tion, Haeger went 7 for 15 with two dou-bles. She also hit both of her home runs at Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium. One was a clutch homer. Haeger forced ex-tra innings, hitting a solo shot with two outs in the bottom of the seventh inning in Florida’s 4-3 win against Charleston Southern on Sunday.
“I know that’s 
why [coach Tim Walton] put me back in after Schwarz took 
over at first,” Haeger said.
Schwarz has struggled to adjust to 
college-level pitching. She’s only bat-ting .125. Her only two hits this season are the two home runs she hit during the Kajikawa Classic in Tempe, Ariz.
Schwarz said she needed to improve 
her offense in the future, but the most important thing was helping the team win.

UF Softballstarting catcher Taylor Gushue twisted his ankle sliding into 
second on a stolen base in the seventh. 
Florida had four errors and a five-run deficit heading to 
the bottom of the fifth.
Following an opening weekend series during which 
they committed eight errors, the Gators added six more on Wednesday.
Georgia Southern, three days removed from taking two of 
three against Georgia, took advantage of Florida’s miscues.
Third baseman Josh Tobias and short-
stop Richie Martin booted groundballs, 
and Harrison Bader had a throwing error, leading to three Eagles runs.
“That’s not really Gators baseball,” second baseman Casey 
Turgeon said.
“No one likes six errors out there. We have some work to 
do and we’ll put this one behind us. We’ll be ready for this weekend.”
Florida hosts Florida Gulf Coast for a three-game series 
starting Friday.
Although the Gators had their worst performance to date, 
the young team enjoyed a few bright spots.
Justin Shafer hit his first career home run with a game-
tying three-run blast in the fifth and threw a career-high four innings in his second college start.
Left-hander Corey Stump pitched a career-best two score-
less innings in extras.
Every starter recorded a hit except Zack Powers. “It’s a tough loss,” Shafer said. “We are going to hate to 
lose, but we battled, and we came back. Just came up a little bit short.”
Contact Adam Pincus at apincus@alligator.org.In the final 2 minutes of regu-
lation or overtime in games de-cided by three possessions or fewer, Florida is shooting just 37.7 percent from the floor, a de-crease from the 43.2 percent it shoots in other situations.
An even bigger drop has been 
the team’s free-throw shooting. The Gators make just 51.7 per -
cent of their attempts from the foul line in the final 2 minutes of regulation or overtime in close games, compared to 67.2 percent otherwise. 
“It’s a lack of focus for us 
sometimes,” junior guard Jaterra Bonds said. “Just getting caught up in the play before or getting too nervous.” 
Butler characterized the late-
game struggles as a product of having an inexperienced team lacking floor awareness. 
“What you expect when you 
have an inexperienced team is that they are not understanding the moments,” Butler said. “We’ll show them clips from a men’s game the night before like with Butler and Gonzaga. … We’re just constantly trying to teach basket-ball in a way that they have never really had to think of it before.”
The referenced play came in 
Butler’s 64-63 win against Gonza-ga came on Jan. 19 in Indianapo-lis. Gonzaga guard David Stock-ton overthrew an inbounds pass with 3.5 seconds remaining. But-ler’s Roosevelt Jones scooped up the loose ball and hit the game-winning shot as time expired to give Butler a 64-63 victory.
UF’s coaches have used that 
clip, as well as others, to highlight the importance of fundamentally sound play late in games, some-thing Florida will attempt to do against Vanderbilt tonight at 7 in the O’Connell Center. 
The Gators fell victim to a last-
second miscue in last season’s loss to the Commodores. 
Trailing 65-62, Vanderbilt 
guard Christina Foggie con-nected on a three-pointer to tie the contest at the buzzer on Feb. 16, 2012. The Commodores used a 6-0 run late in overtime to win the game 75-69, underscoring Florida’s poor performance down the stretch in close games. 
“Toward the end of the game, 
again we didn’t execute like we should have,” redshirt freshman Carlie Needles said.
“We let Christina Foggie get 
the ball, and she banked in a three. It’s really hard to beat a team in overtime, especially on their home court. We’ve just got to be really aware and smart this time.”

Young, Murphy tally three rebounds, 
three fouls each in loss at Missouri
the field. The Tigers outscored the Gators 24-16 in the 
paint.
“We don’t have the same team,” Donovan said. 
“When they came to our place, they didn’t have the same team.
“We’ve both have had to battle through some dif-
ferent injuries and setbacks.”
While Young and Murphy struggled offensively on 
Tuesday, their defensive performance wasn’t much better.
The big men each grabbed three rebounds while 
turning the ball over twice. They also each picked up three fouls. 
While the duo failed to gain any momentum on de-
fense, Donovan wasn’t pleased with the Gators’ over -
all defensive performance during the final minutes of Tuesday’s game.Missouri went on an 8-0 run in the last 4:19 of the 
first half, which featured 0-for-8 shooting from Florida, cutting an 11-point deficit to three. 
Still, it was the defense in the final 8 minutes that 
cost the Gators the game. 
Late in the second half, Pressey drove down the 
lane past Murphy and found an open Laurence Bow-ers  on the low block.
Bowers took Pressey’s pass and dunked, bringing 
Missouri within one point of Florida’s lead with 8 min-utes left in the second half.
Then with 2:47 left in the game, the Gators gave up 
the lead for the first time after Pressey drove past ju-nior guard Scottie Wilbekin and redshirt senior guard Mike Rosario to make a go-ahead layup.
Wilbekin fouled Pressey, who made a free throw to 
complete the three-point play.
Missouri finished the game on a 10-3 run, complet-
ing a 13-point rally in the second half.
 “Our defense, for the most part, did a really great 
job in the game,” Donovan said.
“I thought we defended them really well except for 
those last 8 minutes.”
Guard Kenny Boynton said: “We tried switching 
defenses. They scored on both of them, whether we went to two or we went man. They just converted. At the end of the game, they just converted more than we did.”
