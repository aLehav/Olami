  St. Augustine Church members pray before noon Mass. According to a recent study, women who regularly attended          religious services were 56 percent more likely to be optimistic and 27 percent less likely to show signs of depression.

  Anna Holmbraker attends church every week and 
leads songs during Mass. For the 20-year-old anthro-
pology junior, church brings a sense of optimism and 
belonging. 
  “It gives me time to reﬂ  ect on where I’m at and 
where I want to be,” she said. “It makes me check my-
self and ﬁ  x things that aren’t right in my life.”
  Holmbraker isn’t alone.  According to a recent study, attending church 
could actually affect people on a clinical level. Researchers at Yeshiva University in New York found that women who regularly attended religious services 
were 56 percent more likely to be more optimistic and 
27 percent less likely to show signs of depression. 
  Published Thursday in the Journal of Religion and 
Health, the study considered the mental health of about 92,000 women older than 50.
  Although attending church could affect all age 
groups and both males and females, the study’s ﬁ  nd-ings were drawn only from older women, said Eliezer Schnall, a clinical assistant professor of psychology at Yeshiva University. Attending religious services, mental health may be linked

  For the third time in UF Student Government his-
tory, the Student Senate will conduct an impeachment trial.
  Senators will hear Supervisor of Elections Toni 
Megna’s impeachment trial at tonight’s Senate meet-ing. Senators Carly Wilson, Gillian Leytham, Ford Dwyer, Aimee Dolan and Stephanie Kreitzer ﬁ  led the 
resolution on Oct. 31. 
  The resolution listed 13 elections rules the senators 
said Megna violated, including not listing polling lo-cations in some of the dorms, not properly testing the 
voting computers two days prior to elections and not 
preparing a backup plan in case the electronic voting 
system failed.
  Wilson and Leytham previously appealed to the 
Election Commission and the UF Supreme Court to have the elections investigated and even recommend-ed the elections be redone.  Senators elected in the spring will make up the im-
peachment body , which will vote whether to impeach 
Megna. 
  If at least two-thirds of the impeachment body votes 
to impeach Megna, a trial body will convene ﬁ  ve to 10 days later, according to Student Body codes. The trial 
body would be made of senators 
elected this fall, and potential reper-
cussions must be passed by another 
two-thirds vote.
  The ﬁ  rst UF impeachment hear-
ing occurred in 2008, according to 
Alligator archives, when the Senate voted not to impeach Student Body 
Treasurer Paul Drayton. 
  In 2009, the Senate also voted not 
to impeach Student Body President Kevin Reilly.
  Senate President Andy Mason decided to form a 
special committee of senators to revise the elections 
codes. Members will be announced at the Senate meet-
ing at 7 p.m.  Students Party moves to impeach

The Florida Quidditch team left 
Gainesville last week for the 2011 World 
Cup as a 21-member group with high 
hopes.
Monday, players returned with sore 
legs, hoarse voices and the title of second-
best Quidditch team in the world.
After going undefeated in the pool and 
bracket stages, the team of UF students faced four-time World Cup champions Middlebury College for the title.
The finals game, held in Icahn Stadium 
in New York, started at 10 p.m. on Sunday. After a few yellow cards and with only a few minutes left in the game, the score was Florida 80, Middlebury 70.
“Everybody was cheering for us be-
cause nobody wanted Middlebury to win,” said Hannah Pohlmann, 19, the team’s vice president of tournaments.
The scene was magical. As the game 
raced on the pitch, the coaching staff snuck in players from the University of South Florida and University of Miami to cheer with them on the sidelines, said 
Pohlmann, a mathematics sophomore.
“It was dark, lights shining, the crowd 
was chanting my name,” said Dre Cle-
ments, a 19-year-old chaser. “It was like something out of a dream.”A fan blared UF’s fight song on his sax-
ophone as most of the 1,500-member audi-
ence did the Gators chomp.
The team fed off of the energy in the 
crowd, said Clements, also a mathematics sophomore.
“Earlier in the day, my body was giving 
up,” he said. “But during the game when 
the crowd was cheering, I didn’t feel any of that.”In Quidditch, once the snitch runner 
enters the field, seekers on each team at-
tempt to locate and catch him or her. The 
capture of the snitch awards that seeker’s team with 30 points and ends the game.
Florida Quidditch’s star seeker Alex 
Williams, who caught the snitch in every game but the final, lunged for it seconds after Middlebury’s player got it, Pohl-mann said.
The final score was 100-80, which 
means UF’s club team was winning when the snitch was caught.
Despite the loss, the team is overjoyed 
at its success, team president Bridget Sie-
gel said.
“I can’t even describe the feelings with 
words,” Siegel, 19, a religion sophomore, 
said via email. “Our team is more than just friends, we are a family. We felt closer than 
ever before with every game we won.”
Afterward, the two teams hugged each 
other. Members of Middlebury told Flori-
da that it was the toughest game the team 
had ever played.
“I have never seen our players push 
harder,” Siegel said. “We gave them hell.”
Back at UF, the team hopes its success 
will cause the university to officially rec-ognize Quidditch as a sport.
“We proved ourselves,” Siegel said. “No 
one will underestimate us ever again.”

Holiday spirit filled the Starbucks line as new signs 
advertised the arrival of the peppermint mocha and gin-
gerbread lattes. 
Accompanying the seasonal switch to red holiday cups 
this holiday season is a new interactive Starbucks app.
Starbucks Cup Magic allows users to scan holiday 
characters on certain Starbucks products with smartphone cameras and bring them to life on a mobile screen.
Christmas Blend bags, red cups and miscellaneous in-
store objects all hold the key to unveiling winter anima-tions. 
The characters include an ice skater, a squirrel, a boy, a 
sleigh dog and a fox. 
Activating all five qualifies customers to win a yet-to-
be-named prize. 
Starbucks Cup Magic also offers basic mobile sharing 
capabilities like sending e-cards or Starbucks holiday of-fers and is available for iPhone and Android.
Starbucks introduced its “Let’s Merry” campaign last 
week, sending some customers into a frenzy of excite-ment. 
UF architecture senior Haley Padgett, 21, said she could 
hear the chatter throughout the Reitz Union food court.
“It makes Christmastime seem that much closer,” 
Padgett said. “It’s a simple pleasure that brings a smile to so many faces.”Starbucks unveils smartphone app that spreads holiday cheer
UF’s Quidditch club team takes second place at World CupHe said the benefits are more criti-
cal and more easily seen among this 
demographic.
The women studied came from 
different ethnic backgrounds, re-ligions, income levels and geo-graphic regions, Schnall said.  
The study “purposefully didn’t break the findings down into specific reli-gions,” he said. “If it did, our findings may do more harm than good.”
People could have interpreted the 
findings as proof of one religion being better than another, he said, when that was not the purpose of the study.
Mike Redmond, pastor of Windsor 
Baptist Church in Gainesville, said he has seen people become more optimis-tic because of church.
“In my personal experience, it’s 
not the overly optimistic people who begin to attend church but the people who are struggling and looking for an-swers,” he said. 
“Misery likes company. Women 
who are having trouble rearing their children go to church and find out that every other mother is in the same boat, and then they feel better.”
Redmond said he has seen young 
people benefit from church. 
“[College students] disguise their 
issues through the adrenaline rush of 
youth,” he said, and “are involved in 
activities that bring temporary joy, but that may add to the emptiness that needs to be addressed in their 50s.”Study was conducted with

Students and faculty can attend events showcasing 
UF’s international programs all week. 
International Education Week, an annual event 
sponsored by the U.S. Education and State depart-
ments, celebrates the use of different world cultures 
in the university system.
The International Center started planning the 
events about two weeks in advance, said  David Sam-
mons, dean of the International Center.
“This week is about appreciating the diversity 
around campus,” Sammons said. “Students have the chance to meet people from other parts of the world.”
Events are being held all over campus and will be 
co-sponsored by groups such as the Belly Gators, the Peace Corps and Volunteers for International Student Affairs. 
Santa Fe College will also co-host some events on 
its campus, Sammons said. 
The week doesn’t focus only on international stu-
dents, but it also highlights UF’s study abroad pro-grams.Linguistics junior Tommy Budd, 21, competed in 
the study abroad category in the Eighth Annual Glob-
al Culture Photography Competition.
His photo, which shows a priest reading outside a 
church in Lalibela, Ethiopia, won second place.
Winning photos will be displayed in the Grinter 
Gallery. 
“Studying abroad was the best decision I have 
made so far at UF,” Budd said. “I was exposed to oth-
er cultures and was able to decide what I want to do 
with my life.”
Budd, who studied in Ethiopia during Spring 2011, 
said he hopes to record endangered languages in vil-
lages to keep record of them before they disappear.
Studying abroad and other international programs 
form a more complete college education, said Mabel Cardec, spokeswoman for the International Center.
Cardec said this year 15-minute flash demonstra-
tions have been added to the week’s events. The dem-onstrations will show how to complete tasks from 
other countries, including embroidery from Jordan, 
skiing from Switzerland or Tai Chi from China.
“The idea here is to put that little international bug 
in everyone,” she said. “Hopefully students will want to be more involved in international programs.”Events to promote international programs
ReliGiOus , from page 1Ozone is the only pollutant 
tested for in Alachua County
Gainesville are under control but close to 
the maximum acceptable standard.
He said it is important to contain ozone 
levels because ozone attacks lung cells and irritates eyes and skin. 
Ozone forms because nitrogen oxide re-
acts with sunlight, he said.
Diaz said the new national standard, put 
in place in 2008, is 10 times higher than the previous standard.
Ozone is the only pollutant the FDEP 
tests for in Alachua County, Wu said.
Hillsborough County, which includes 
Tampa, is the only place in Florida where lead levels are monitored, with four test locations, Diaz said. Lead pollution in the 
rest of Florida has decreased to very low 
levels.
“Since lead was phased out of gasoline, 
it is not worthwhile to monitor lead in air,” Wu said.If a county exceeds the maximum level 
of ozone, he said, the county must submit a plan to the EPA with a solution to the ozone problem.
After two to three years, if the plan is not 
effective, the county will start to have its federal transportation and highway fund-ing phased out.
Increased ozone levels kill crops and 
farm animals, and people affected by in-
creased ozone levels may see increased 
health insurance rates and have to take off time from work, Wu said.
“Loss of labor and increased health in-
surance, these are the hidden costs of high air pollutant levels,” he said.AiR , from page 1THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
WASHINGTON — Rep. Gabrielle Gif-
fords, struggling to form the words in her first 
extended interview since a January shooting rampage, said Monday she will not return to Congress until she is “better.”
“No. Better,” she said in response to a 
question about whether she wanted to return to Congress.
As she gestured as if to help her form the 
words, her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly, completed the thought: “She wants to get better.”
At that point, interviewer Diane Sawyer 
also tried to get Giffords to summarize her 
mindset, asking whether she was thinking 
she would go back to Congress if she got bet-ter. “And that’s where you’re at right now?” Sawyer asked.
“Yes, yes, yes,” Giffords replied.Since the Arizona Democrat made a sur -prise appearance on the House floor this sum-mer to cast a vote on the debt ceiling increase, there has been wide speculation about her ca-reer plans, including whether she would run for the state’s open Senate seat.
The ABC interview showed a woman who 
appeared confident and determined but still far from able to carry on a detailed conversa-
tion. She spoke in a clear voice, but in halting 
phrases: “Pretty good ... Difficult ... Strong, strong, strong,” she replied to questions about how she was feeling and how she’d fared over the 10 months since the shooting.
The Giffords interview was accompanied 
by video Kelly shot documenting Giffords’ recovery. The initial days and weeks showed her struggling to understand what had hap-
pened and to communicate in the most basic 
forms. She struggled just to learn how to nod, to raise two fingers. When her therapist asked what one sits in, she replied “spoon,” before later settling on “chair.” Kelly said she used the word “cheeseburger” to describe several items.
Eventually, she learned to speak again 
and smile.
Kelly said he documented her recovery 
because he knew she would astonish her 
skeptics.
“Gabby Giffords is too 
tough to let this beat her,” Kelly said.
Giffords has undergone 
intensive therapy. At times, despair set in. One clip 
shows her sobbing in her therapist’s arms at Hous-ton’s TIRR Memorial Her -
mann hospital.
“Can I tell you something? It is going to 
get better,” her therapist said at one point. “You’ve come a long way in five weeks.”
Giffords is shown becoming more upbeat 
and smiling more frequently in the ensuing months. She now walks with a limp and can talk, though she generally speaks in halting 
phrases or repeats a word to get her point 
across.
At one point, Kelly used the word “brave” 
to describe the word on his mind when he thinks of her — “brave and tough,” he said. Then Giffords, looking directly at Kelly, re-sponds almost in a whisper: “Tough, tough, tough,” and she kissed his bald head.
Sawyer asked Giffords if she was ever 
angry about what happened to her. Giffords 
replied, “No, no, no. Life, life.”
The television interview comes as fellow 
victims of the shooting came to Washington 
to testify in favor of a gun-control bill. They said Giffords’ appearance represents a major 
milestone for them as it helps them cope with 
the trauma they’ve endured over the past 10 months. About a dozen survivors and fam-ily members are in Washington lobbying for legislation that would extend criminal back-ground checks to all gun sales and enhance the quality of the FBI’s criminal background checks.

Stephanie Asselin used to assem-
ble her plastic Christmas tree in her 
Citrus County home every Decem-
ber. But year after year, the branches 
got a little more smashed and the scent got a little more musty, so three years ago she made the switch back 
to live Christmas trees.
“There’s just something about 
that smell,” the 20-year-old English 
junior said. 
This sentiment is something the 
National Christmas Tree Association wanted to capture through adver -
tisements promoting the sale of fresh trees.
To fund the advertisements, the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture an-
nounced earlier this month that it 
would impose a 15-cent fee on all fresh Christmas trees sold for farms that sell more than 500 trees a year.
However, after coming under fire 
for “taxing Christmas,” the depart-ment announced last week that it would delay implementation of the “Christmas Tree Tax.”
The fee was originally requested 
by the National Christmas Tree As-
sociation in 2009 to fund research 
programs and marketing campaigns to promote the purchase of real trees. The ads would have been similar to 
commodity brand campaigns such as 
the “Got Milk?” or “Beef: It’s what’s for dinner” advertisements.
In a press release, the National 
Christmas Tree Association said the 
fee should not change the price con-
sumers pay for their trees; however, price increases were not strictly for -
bidden.
Cathryn Gregory, co-owner of 
Unicorn Hill Christmas Tree Farm in Gainesville, said she doesn’t view 
the fee as a burden but rather a type 
of membership dues for the national organization.
“We have never charged any type 
of fee to our customers, and we never 
would,” she said. “This is just part of doing business.”
Unicorn Hill Farm, 3605 NW 69th 
St., opens each year on Dec. 1 and 
sells about 300 to 400 Christmas trees annually. Since they don’t sell more than 500 trees a year, the Gregorys 
would not have been required to pay 
the 15-cent fee per tree, but Gregory said she and her husband support the idea.
Florida’s Christmas tree industry 
has declined drastically over the past 20 years, she said. The number of peo-ple who buy Christmas trees remains roughly the same each year, and as the economy has declined, farms’ op-
erating costs have increased, making 
it difficult for farmers to stay afloat. 
Gregory said many people don’t 
think about the environmental im-pact of purchasing fake trees.
“You have to think: What is the 
carbon footprint of producing that tree?” she said. “It’s almost nonexis-tent for real trees, but fake trees are 
usually made in China from petro-
leum products and then have to be shipped to this country.”

Pennsylvania now attracts more 
international students to its university 
campuses than does sunny Florida.
The Sunshine State has fallen from 
sixth to seventh place in the number of international students at its universi-ties, according to the 2011 Open Doors report published by the the Institute of International Education.
The Keystone State had a 9 percent 
increase in international students last year, passing Florida, the only state in the top 10 that didn’t experience a per -
centage increase.
The report found that the number 
of international students in Florida increased from 29,708 students dur -
ing the 2009-10 school year to 29,719 in 2010-11.
However, the total number of inter -
national students in the U.S. increased by five percent from last year.
That increase is largely due to a 
23 percent rise in Chinese students studying in the U.S., according to the report.  
California holds the top spot for 
hosting the most international students, followed by New York and Texas. 
UF has the highest number of in-
ternational students in the state, with 5,393 registered during the 2010-11 year.
Jan Sohl, a 22-year-old economics 
student from Germany, said he chose to study at UF after his friend gave it a good recommendation.
“I wanted to see the U.S. anyway,” 
he said. “And there’s good weather.”Percentage of international students did not increase this year

The promise of turkey, cranberries and pump-
kin pie will lure many students home for the holi-
days, despite travel costs that can put a dent in 
their wallets.
While flying home can sometimes mean break-
ing the bank, students said they will go home re-
gardless. 
However, students can do a few things to make 
the journey a little more affordable.
StudentUniverse.com is a website students can 
use to find discounts just for college students and faculty for flights, hotels, rail passes and activi-ties.
The site has been around for 10 years and has 
contracts with all major airlines, said Danielle 
Carlson, marketing manager for the site.
The company verifies for the airline that the 
traveler is a college student, and the airline passes 
on the discount to them. Carlson said millions of 
students visit StudentUniverse each year. 
Gainesville Regional Airport has three airlines 
that fly in and out. All three have parent compa-
nies that are partnered with StudentUniverse. Del-ta Connection, US Airways Express and American Eagle, a part of American Airlines, all have flights 
that fly to designated areas of the country. 
Other websites, such as priceline.com, expedia.
com and cheapflights.com also promise to get dis-
counted rates for passengers.
UF business freshman Billy Harris, 18, said 
he used his Delta credit card to use miles al-ready saved up from Delta Air Lines to book his flight home to Maryland. He is flying out of the Gainesville airport to go home.
“It’s just something I have to do,” Harris said.Laura Aguiar, spokeswoman for Gainesville 
Regional Airport, said the economy has an effect on all travelers, and when the economy is tough, everybody cuts back. 
Students are no exception.“I think students are going to go home for the 
holidays no matter what,” she said, “but they will weigh the alternatives, even if it means finding 
cheaper flights or packing into a car.”Website offers 
travel discounts for holiday breaks
“There’s just something about 
that smell.”

GOP debate was 
poorly planned
Given that we are still a couple of months away from 
the first votes being cast in the Republican presiden-tial primary, many of you probably couldn’t care less 
about the candidates because you aren’t voting or aren’t vot-ing for Republicans. 
For those of you who do care (and this should include 
everyone, considering that one of these candidates could be your next president), you might have heard something while watching the South Carolina/Florida game that there was a debate on Saturday night. 
That’s right, Saturday at 8 p.m. on CBS — the exact same 
time as the big Oregon/Stanford game — the GOP contend-ers faced off on what are arguably the most important issues of this campaign. 
While most people care more about the economy than 
foreign affairs, one of the president’s main functions is be-ing the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. In recent years, almost all foreign-policy decisions have come from the White House or other parts of the executive branch — especially wars. 
But apparently, CBS doesn’t think it’s important for 
you to know or care what these candidates think about our foreign policy. If you weren’t watching football, you were 
probably out doing something else with your life on Satur -
day night.
To be honest, no members of the Alligator editorial board 
watched the debate, but there were some important topics 
discussed of which many Americans should be aware. 
For instance, both Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich told 
the audience in Spartanburg, S.C., that if sanctions and other strategies failed, the U.S. would have no other choice but to engage in military action with Iran. That is pretty important 
for the American people to know about a candidate, don’t 
you think? 
Ron Paul and Herman Cain resisted this argument in fa-
vor of other strategies. 
On the issue of torture, Cain and Michele Bachmann 
agreed that waterboarding does not constitute torture, while Paul and Jon Huntsman argued that it does and is immoral. 
These are some pretty important distinctions that all vot-
ers — Republican, Democrat and otherwise — should know 
for next year’s elections. 
CBS not only messed up the timing of the debate, but it 
also did a horrible job at keeping the debate fair. 
Both Bachmann and Paul have claimed that CBS pretty 
much ignored them during the debate. 
While not the sexiest of topics for debate, foreign policy is 
one of the key components of the president’s constitutional 
obligations. The media should take this issue seriously and make sure that a debate on this topic occurs when more peo-
ple will be able and willing to watch it. 
Also, if these news outlets are going to invite everyone to 
a debate, they should do a better job of awarding equal time 
to each candidate to respond to questions. Tight deadlines always pay off in the end
Don’t even talk to me about deadlines. At this point, 
I’m a deadline professional. Without them, I’d be lost. I’ve relied on major deadlines for most of my 
education.
I was a theater nerd in high school. I could quote any 
of the very popular musicals, could tell you the difference between Samuel Beckett and Arthur Miller and somehow owned more black clothing than the average high school student. The black clothing came in handy for perfor -
mances and working backstage during shows.
High school theater, for me, was all about having fun. 
The problem lies in having too much fun and then you forget about deadlines. Too often we were rushing to fin-ish the scenery the week of opening night. More likely than not, our director would have to work unbelievable hours just to make sure the show would go off without a hitch.
But of course, there would be hitches. Microphones ran 
out of batteries, curtains weren’t pulled fast enough and actors tripped and almost ruined their costumes. That’s all part of the experience, though.
Similar situations have happened in college, too.I didn’t want to do theater for the rest of my life, but I 
knew I’d need a creative outlet. That’s why, when I was a puny freshman, I joined Theatre Strike Force and had my eyes opened to the crazy world of improv comedy.
TSF also does sketch comedy, which is just like high 
school theater all over again.
Over the past three years, I’ve been a part of our major 
semesterly shows. Our latest is this Thursday and might be pretty controversial to the extremely school-spirited. Either way, I’ve been able to help the creative vision of our writers and directors be communicated to huge audi-ences. That’s such a special experience.
But I’ve also seen those shows almost fall apart. Props 
weren’t made on time, sketches were rewritten hours before the show and audiences took their sweet time to show up.
Performances of any kind can 
be nerve-wracking and terrify-ing. It can be scary to put your -
self out there and represent your school in some capacity.
At the end of the day, though, 
everything always came togeth-er — no matter what. 
The shows I’m a part of now are just as wonderful. 
It’s always wonderful to watch any kind of improv show. Somehow, even without a script or prior knowledge, magic happens on stage. Put those minds in creative posi-tions, and the funniest sketches come to life. All of TSF’s members were drawn to the club because of a show they had seen, so the pressure is always on to be the funniest and the best.
Being involved in productions for so many years of my 
life has taught me a lot. 
It’s taught me that those deadlines are both scare tac-
tics and for your own good. I’ve learned to listen to your director and stage manager because they know your schedule and personality better than you do. I’ve learned that you need a script to give organization to your life, but that it’s more than OK to break away from it every once in a while. I know now that, in all kinds of theater, team-work is one of the most important and necessary things.
After all that, I’m going to drop a simile on you. Get 
ready.
The performing arts are like taking care of a pet.You’re so excited when you first get involved. It teach-
es you how to have fun while being responsible and ac-countable. But if you neglect it, even for a minute, you could have a large, stinky mess all over the place.

The amount of biodiversity on this planet is 
truly awe-inspiring. Scientists almost unan-imously agree that deforestation directly 
leads to global climate change. Furthermore, sci-entists lament loss of biodiversity, particularly 
with respect to still undiscovered and undocu-
mented species. Some believe these unidentified species could hold the key to curing diseases or providing a blueprint for further scientific innova-tion based on Mother Nature’s diverse creations.
People from around the world who are con-
scientious of the destruction of this important ecosystem commonly cite the Amazon rainforest as the largest and most well-known example of 
this man-made calamity. Other rainforests also 
face similar — albeit less publicized — challenges throughout Indonesia and Southeast Asia.
The Amazon rainforest, for decades now, has 
been the modus operandi to blame the “evil” for -
eign investors and multinationals who recklessly steal the national resources of this fertile region. The word “imperialist” is a one-size-fits-all meth-od of passing the buck to others far away.
But concerned citizens need to take a closer 
look at the real forces leading to the continued de-forestation of the Amazon rainforest. For far too long, the blame for deforestation has been placed on international corporations, as well as other 
powerful multinational entities such as the Inter -
national Monetary Fund or the Asia-Pacific Eco-nomic Cooperation.
In the case of Brazil, 
the pro-nationalist, avidly anti-imperialist Work-
ers’ Party has been in power for nearly 10 years. 
Since assuming control of the country, the party has made several key changes. The most notable change has been the systematic and methodical alienation of the IMF and other multinationals operating inside Brazil. 
In other words, Brazil has become increasingly 
protectionist economically.
One ambitious goal set by the party was the 
creation of more jobs for Brazilians. As a result, the first decade of the 21st century will be remem-bered in Brazil as a decade of tremendous growth, with extensive construction projects and infra-structure development.
Scientists have confirmed that deforestation 
increases greenhouse gases much more than fossil fuel emissions do. By far, the largest cause of de-forestation in the Amazon rainforest is land clear -
ing for cattle and livestock. For the past decade, it was estimated that close to 70 percent of all de-forestation in the Amazon was for the purpose of cattle ranching. 
Surprisingly, the often-vilified practice of 
logging, long associated with imperialists, was deemed to be the cause of a mere 2 to 3 percent of all Amazonian deforestation. Add into the equa-tion the fact that Brazilians consume more beef per capita than nearly any other nation world-wide, and a much clearer picture emerges, further clarifying what really is the driving force behind 
the continued deforestation of the Amazon.
In a region that notoriously prides itself on fer -
vent nationalism and staunch anti-imperialism, it 
is ironic to see the Amazon rainforest being rav-aged not by foreign imperialists, but rather by millions of native mini-imperialists, all of who are taking advantage of the legal system for what they hope will be a better life. 
The only loser at the end of the day is their 
own national treasure, pillaged and soon to be ex-hausted by its own people.

L    ike many, I remember Election Day 2008 as one of 
unusual euphoria. I was at the College Democrats’ party in Currier dining hall when I heard Ohio had 
been called for Obama, clinching the election, and prompt-ly started celebrating like I’d never celebrated before.
I tried unsuccessfully to remember my mother’s cell-
phone number and ended up screaming “WE ELECTED 
OBAMA” to some poor Maine woman. I ran to Winthrop 
to meet up with old intern friends from Obama’s primary campaign, amazed that we had even gotten to the gener -
al election, let alone won it. I may have had a little bit to drink. It was a good time.
So I understand, in light of the still-stagnant economy 
and the deficit brinkmanship of the last year, why people are disappointed. Obama’s victory was emotionally mean-ingful and, given the huge expectations that win set, dis-
content is inevitable. But the right takeaway, I think, is 
not that Obama is a failure, but that major change is really hard, especially in America, especially for the president and especially now.
Suppose that the United States had a parliamentary 
system, the kind in place in most of the developed world. Let’s suppose the U.S. had no president or Senate, that the Speaker of the House operated as a de facto prime minis-ter, and that Obama had been swept into that office. Given 
that the House, under Speaker Nancy Pelosi, passed cap-
and-trade legislation to fight global warming and a health care bill with a public option, it’s fair to say that Speaker Obama would have gotten that done as well.
He also likely could have passed initiatives that Pelosi 
didn’t take up because she assumed the Senate would just kill them. Perhaps he would have passed more stimulus spending, perhaps campaign finance reform. He would have done what all parliamentary leaders with majori-
ties do: use the power voters gave him to pass his whole 
agenda.
But instead of a parliament, the U.S. has a system that 
is designed to prevent government policy from fully re-flecting the public will. The Founding Fathers, as we all 
learned in high school civics, were deathly afraid of actual 
democracy and put plenty of veto points (the president, the Senate, the Supreme Court, etc.) in the Constitution so as to prevent it. That Obama could not have pushed through his 
whole agenda, like leaders of other developed democracies 
can, is not his fault. It’s James Madison’s.
Some might find this explanation unsatisfying. Didn’t Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyn-don B. Johnson pass major leg-islation under these same con-
straints? Yes, but they had two 
other things going for them. For one thing, their congres-
sional majorities were enormous compared to Obama’s. In 1935, when Roosevelt signed Social Security into law, 
there were 72 Democrats in the Senate. In 1965, when John-
son signed the bill creating Medicare, there were 68 Sen-ate Democrats. Obama, by contrast, had at most 60 Senate Democrats to work with and only 59 by the time health-care reform passed.
What’s more, Obama has had to deal with a de facto 60-
vote supermajority requirement that only emerged in the past few years. Roosevelt and Johnson had to deal with a higher bar for breaking filibusters (67 votes instead of 60), 
but it was only with Mitch McConnell’s emergence as Sen-
ate Minority Leader in 2007 that the procedure began to be used routinely to influence legislation, and before 1970 it was only really used to delay civil rights legislation. In-deed, when Johnson was whipping votes for Medicare, his 
legislative strategists did not even consider the possibility 
that the bill would be filibustered. It was just too absurd an idea.
If you’re going to be disappointed with someone be dis-
appointed with the Republicans and moderate Democrats in Congress who derailed Obama’s agenda. Talia B. Lavin, [a disappointed student quoted in a recent Harvard Crim-son article], regrets that Obama has not done more to cur -
tail “continual expansion of the power of the presidency.”
But on domestic policy, the rise of the filibuster has ac-
tually led to an expansion of Congress’ power and a dimin-ishing of the president’s. And with great power, as Spider-Man’s Uncle Ben reminds us, comes great responsibility. 
Mitch McConnell may not be “one of us,” but he is a person 
with moral agency. 
Liberals should start treating him like one. We can argue 
for days over what Obama could have done differently, but there’s no question there was plenty that Congress could 
have done differently. 
To respond to the policy failures McConnell and his 
allies create by blaming Obama is to enable Republicans’ 
— and Congress’s — effort to duck responsibility for their 
actions.

OAKLAND, Calif. — Police 
decked in riot gear and armed 
with tear gas cleared out Oakland’s anti-Wall Street encampment early Monday , the latest law enforcement 
crackdown amid complaints around 
the country of health and safety haz-ards at protest camps.
The raid at the Occupy Oakland 
camp, one of the largest and most active sites in the movement, came a day after police in Portland, Ore., arrested about 50 people while shut-ting down its camp amid complaints 
of drug use and sanitation issues.
Police in Burlington, Vt., also 
evicted protesters after a man fatally 
shot himself last week inside a tent.
Police staged a previous raid on 
the Oakland encampment on Oct. 25, but Mayor Jean Quan allowed protesters to re-establish their tent city . On Monday , however, Quan 
said officials could no longer ignore 
the problems posed by the camp.
“We came to this point because 
Occupy Oakland, I think, began to take a different path than the origi-nal movement,” Quan said. “The encampment became a place where we had repeated violence and, last week, a murder. We had to bring the 
camp to an end before more people 
got hurt.”
Demands increased for Oakland 
protesters to pack up after a man was shot and killed Thursday near the encampment at the City Hall plaza.
Protesters claimed there was no 
connection between the shooting and the camp. But police identified the slain man as Kayode Ola Foster, 25, of Oakland, saying his family confirmed he had been staying at the plaza.
Witnesses also told police that 
one of two suspects in the shooting had also been a frequent resident at the plaza. 
Monday’s raid came as no sur -
prise to protesters after the city is-sued its fourth order to abandon the camp. About 300 officers from the Oakland Police Department and seven other law enforcement agen-cies moved in around 5:30 a.m., ar -
resting 32 people and tearing down about 150 tents.Officials declared the operation 
a success, saying all arrests were peaceful, and there were no report-ed injuries to protesters or officers. Police said those taken into custody likely will face charges of unlawful assembly and lodging.
“This had been a very difficult 
situation,” Quan said. “I’d tried to do what was right for the city and keep the most people safe at every 
step.”
But Dan Siegel, one of the may-
or’s top legal advisers, resigned 
over Monday’s raid, saying officials 
should have done more to work 
with protesters before sending in police. 
Video footage of a protest after 
the Oct. 25 raid showed officers us-ing flash-bang grenades and firing bean bag rounds into the crowd, injuring a number of people and 
prompting cries of police brutality.
Marine Corps veteran Scott Ol-
sen was left in critical condition after 
suffering a head injury during that protest. His case became a rally-ing cry for the Occupy Wall Street movement around the nation.
Olsen, 24, issued his first state-
ment Sunday since leaving a hospi-
tal.
“You’ll be hearing more from me 
in the near future and soon enough 
we’ll see you in our streets!” he post-ed on his Google+ account, as well as a photograph of himself with a neck brace and apparent bruising around his left eye. Oakland raid is latest in Occupy movement camp crackdowns8, ALLIGATOR §  TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 2011

� THE PROPOSAL WILL BE PUT 
ON THE 2012 BALLOT.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
TALLAHASSEE — Some Florida 
lawmakers are having second thoughts 
about a property tax-cutting proposal the Legislature put on the November 2012 ballot.
On Monday the Senate Community 
Affairs Committee approved a replace-ment for the proposed state constitution-al amendment that would offer more tax relief for homeowners but less for busi-nesses.
The panel’s chairman, Sen. Mike Ben-
nett, said he dislikes the current version, listed as Amendment 4, because its hom-
eowner provision would cut taxes only 
for those who haven’t bought a home in the past three years.
“This pertains to all buyers and all 
property , and I think it’s a much better deal than just first-home buyers,” said Bennett, R-Bradenton.
The new proposal (SJR 314) spon-
sored by Sen. David Simmons, R-Mai-tland, drew opposition from business interests because it is less generous to commercial taxpayers.
Either version would be in addition 
to the long-standing Save Our Homes Amendment. It caps assessment increas-es for primary homes, known as home-steads, at 3 percent annually . V oters in 2008 also adopted an amendment that caps assessment increases for businesses 
and other non-homestead properties at 
10 percent.
Amendment 4 would reduce the non-
homestead limit to 5 percent. Simmons’ proposal would make it 7 percent as a compromise with the Florida Associa-tion of Counties.
Davin Suggs, a lobbyist for the associ-
ation, said reducing the non-homestead 
cap would increase the pressure on local 
officials to raise tax rates for everyone to make up for the revenues they’d lose.
The non-homestead cap is in response 
to the Save Our Homes Amendment that began shifting the tax burden toward businesses and away from homeowners after it was adopted in the 1990s.
Save Our Homes also has caused 
inequities among homeowners. People 
who have owned their homes for many 
years pay much lower taxes than those who recently have bought houses of the same value.
“We are in fact penalizing new home 
ownership,” Simmons said.State Senate panel OKs 
revised tax-relief proposal THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
TALLAHASSEE — A panel that included 
legal experts, academics and lawmakers on 
Monday renewed a push for changes to try to make Florida’s death penalty more just and prevent innocent people from being executed.
Participants’ views about their chances of 
success ranged from hopeful to despairing in a state that leads the nation with 23 death row inmates who have been exonerated this year
“It seems to be a problem that may not be 
able to be solved,” said former State Attorney Harry Shorstein of Jacksonville. “What the public doesn’t understand is how expensive this litigation has been over the years.”
Shorstein, who participated by telephone, 
supports the death penalty but said he’s trou-bled with the lack of movement toward fixing its problems.
Florida State University’s law school spon-
sored the forum to mark the fifth anniversary of an American Bar Association study that criticized the state’s death penalty procedures and made a number of recommendations.
One was that juries be unanimous in rec-
ommending death sentences. Florida is the only death penalty state that lets juries make sentencing decisions or recommendations by a simple majority. Florida judges have the fi-nal say but must give great weight to jury rec-ommendations.
For a second year, State Sen. Thad Altman  
is sponsoring a bill (SB 772) that would require 
unanimous findings of aggravating factors as 
well as death sentence recommendations. His legislation failed without so much as a com-mittee hearing earlier this year.“I’m hoping ... we can at least get a hear -
ing,” the Viera Republican told other panel 
members. “I don’t think that’s asking too 
much.”
The panel’s moderator, Mark Schlakman, 
senior program director at Florida State’s Cen-ter for the Advancement of Human Rights, was more optimistic.
Schlakman noted the new bill would apply 
only to crimes committed after Oct. 1, 2012. Prosecutors had been worried about it being 
retroactive to existing cases.
Also, since the last legislative session, U.S. 
District Judge Jose E. Martinez in Miami has 
ruled Florida’s death sentence law is unconsti-tutional because jury recommendations don’t 
have to be unanimous. The state is appealing.
“Irrespective of where 
the appeal goes, it under -
scores the concern about that process,” Schlakman said in an interview.
Some lawmakers have 
opposed changes because they were afraid that might 
result in more appeals. Martinez’ ruling shows the opposite may be the case, Schlakman said.
He is hopeful Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican 
businessman who never ran for public office before last year, will be receptive.
“Gov. Scott approaches issues, whether 
one agrees or disagrees with his policy, with a fresh look and an open mind without having had much in the way of political background on these issues and tends to look at issues in general within the context of business prac-tices,” Schlakman said.Legal experts look to change 
Florida’s death penalty policy

New Podcast Breaking Down Loss to Gamecocks
To hear what our football writers think of Saturday’s brutal loss to 
South Carolina, log on to alligatorSports.org or subscribe on iTunes and download the latest edition of our podcast hosted by Greg Luca. UF v. FSU Time Announced
Florida’s annual rivalry game with Florida State on Nov. 26 will be broadcast on ESPN2 at 7 p.m. The game will be played at home in The Swamp. Florida coach Will Muschamp said he and the coaching staff have gone to great lengths in an effort to reduce penalties. See story, page 15.
GREG LUCA
Alligator Staff Writer
Freshman cornerback Marcus 
Roberson will sit out the remainder 
of the season due to a neck strain, 
coach Will Muschamp said Mon-day. 
Muschamp expects Roberson to 
be “fine” in four to six weeks, set-ting up a return in time for spring practice. 
“It’s nothing that’s going to 
be permanent,” Muschamp said. 
“They’re just taking the precaution-
ary measures.”
Roberson started in each of 
Florida’s first 10 games, notching 22 
tackles, two pass breakups and an 
interception. 
He has topped the Gators’ cor -
nerback depth chart since the open-ing week and shadowed Alshon Jef-
fery throughout Saturday’s contest 
with South Carolina, holding the 
All-America wideout to two catches for 17 yards. 
With Roberson out, Muschamp 
said UF will lean on sophomore Jay-len Watkins, who has started each of 
the last three weeks, and sophomore 
Cody Riggs, who started the team’s 
first seven games before Watkins 
claimed the role.  
Freshman Loucheiz Purifoy and 
senior Moses Jenkins will also be in the mix for additional playing time. 
Wideouts invisible: After a 
spring season filled with hype and hope, Quinton Dunbar and the Flor -
ida wide receivers have been mostly 
nonfactors this year. 
As a group, UF wideouts have averaged 5.4 catches and 78.8 yards 
per game. This year, 54 individual receivers nationally have averaged 
at least that many catches, and 43 
wideouts have had at least that many yards. 
“They’re team players, they want 
to do whatever it takes to win,” se-
nior quarterback John Brantley said. 
“They’re just going to keep going out there each week and trying to 
better themselves and better this 
team.”
Dunbar has only eight catches 
for 116 yards this season and failed 
to record a stat Saturday, but Brant-ley and Muschamp lauded him for his performance.
“To see him blocking downfield 
on longer plays and finishing the plays, he did a great job,” Brantley said. 
Said Muschamp: “Given his op-
portunities, he has played well.”
Injury update: Brantley said he 
feels only as sore as he would expect to feel on a Monday after a game. 
He said his right arm, which was 
injured Nov . 5 against Vanderbilt, is healed. His ankle, on the other hand, is still problematic, although 
it has been steadily recovering since 
he sprained it Oct. 1 against Ala-bama. He said there have not been

Gators to finish season without top cornerback Roberson

Following his first career double-
double on Friday, Patric Young had no 
problem pointing out college basket-ball’s top post player.
“Our next game is against the best 
center in the country: Jared Sullinger,” he said.
While Young took the humble route 
ahead of tonight’s clash at 8 between No. 7 Florida (1-0) and No. 3 Ohio State (1-0), his words served as a fair descrip-tion when discussing the Buckeyes’ 6-foot-9, 280-pound big man. 
After all, Sullinger powered 
through the Gators’ 
frontline for a game-
high 26 points and 10 
boards during Ohio State’s 93-75 win in Gainesville a year ago. 
“I have a great 
deal of respect for [Sullinger] because 
he really understands the game,” UF coach Billy Donovan said. “Watching Florida to focus on stopping 
Ohio State big man Sullinger THE JETT STREAM
The heat has really cranked up this 
month.
It will only get hotter come Decem-
ber, and expect the temperature to rise and rise throughout the winter. Welcome to 
Will Muschamp’s throne, where the flames 
are growing and will continue to stoke as fans reflect on this season and their coach’s $2.5 million contract.
Concern; anger; F-bomb-spitting, re-
mote-chucking disgust — it’s all justified. Florida looks as close to its glory days as Notre Dame does, and the Gators were na-tional championship contenders two years 
ago, when students like me were sopho-
mores. 
But ease up on Muschamp, at least for 
now. This is not an endorsement of the Gators’ coach. This is an endorsement of logic.  
Florida gets dominated in the fourth quarter, is bad in key situations (32.5 per -
cent on third-down conversions) and is undisciplined (8.3 
penalties per game, 
minus-10 turnover margin). These are all categories of a 
poorly coached team. 
This year, however, is not a fair reflec-
tion of Muschamp. First seasons rarely are. Muschamp deserves a chance to bring in his own athletes, to suit up players who can 
establish a power run game and pressure 
the quarterback and defend tall receivers. 
He should be able to prove whether he 
can learn from his own mistakes. In addi-tion to recruiting pipelines, booster support Patience key with Muschamp

“To see [Dunbar] blocking 
downfield on longer plays 
and finishing the plays, he 
did a great job.”
John Brantley
UF quarterbackand an elite training program, Muschamp 
should be given one other resource: time. At least three years.
Look at the 10 active coaches in BCS 
conferences with the highest winning per -
centages who have coached at least three seasons. In their first years, nine of those coaches combined to go 58-50 (see chart). The other coach is Nick Saban, who went 9-2 at Toledo in 1990 before bolting for a defensive coordinator gig with the Cleve-land Browns.
Going 6-6 in the regular season — a 
lock for Florida — would put Muschamp in fine company. Of course, this season doesn’t suggest the Gators’ coach will be one of the best in the nation. Far from it. Plenty of coaches go .500 in their first year and then fade into obscurity.
The key will be next season. Of those 
nine coaches, eight won more games in 
their second season. One (Bob Stoops) 
took home the national championship, and two others (Bobby Petrino and Mark Richt) were conference champs.Consider Florida’s own coaches. Urban 
Meyer went 9-3 in 2005 before winning a national title in his second season. Ron Zook, meanwhile, finished 8-5 in each of his first two years.
That latter stat, read the wrong way, has 
already stirred panic — Ron Zook and his 
silly prevent defense was still more successful than Muschamp! But Zook didn’t improve in year No. 2, and he was gone by the end 
of his third season.
We don’t know Muschamp’s fate yet. 
Nobody does. Not the players. Not Mus-
champ. Not Athletic Director Jeremy Fo-ley.
Foley, of course, knows better than any-
one the depression of an era like Zook’s. 
That was his first high-profile hire, and 
the move flopped miserably. Foley also knows patience, though only a proper amount. 
Muschamp hasn’t proven himself, ob-
viously. Not even close. But, for now, be patient. For now.
If you still want to grab your pitchfork 
at this point next year, though, I certainly won’t be the one stopping you.

After making his debut in last 
week’s poll, Weeden contin-
ues to show that age ain’t
nothin’ but a number. The 28-year-old’s climb up our charts has him sitting at No. 2 this time around. Against Texas Tech, Weeden put on a passing clinic, completing 31 
of 37 passes (83.8 percent) for 423 yards and ﬁ  ve touchdowns while tossing no picks in the Cowboys’ 66-6 win.
4.  �  Andrew Luck, Stanford quarterback 
(9 points): 168.9 passer rating, 2,680 pass-
ing yards, 70.6 completion percentage, 29 passing touchdowns, 7 interceptions.
3. �  Case Keenum, Houston quarterback (11 
points): 193.3 passer rating, 3,951 passing yards, 
74.2 completion percentage, 37 passing touchdowns, 
3 interceptions.1. �  Trent Richardson, Alabama running back (18 
points): 1,205 rushing yards, 5.9 yards per carry, 18 
touchdowns; 25 receptions, 318 yards, 1touchdown.2.  � Brandon Weeden, Oklahoma State 
quarterback (15 points): 164.2 passer 
rating, 3,635 passing yards, 73.1 comple-tion percentage, 31 passing touchowns, 9 interceptions.5.  �  LaMichael James, 
Oregon running back (4 points): 
1,207 rushing yards, 7.9 yards per carry, 12 touchdowns; 13 receptions, 175 yards, 1 touchdown.
James makes 
his ﬁ  rst appear-ance this week after leading Oregon to an emphatic winagainst previ-ously unde-
feated Stanford. James carried the ball 20 times for 146 yards and gashed the Cardinal defense for three touchdowns. Making his season stats even more impressive: He missed two games in the middle of October due to injury.
Luck had a stranglehold on 
the top spot in our poll since its inception. However, anuncharacteristic performance and a pair of interceptions send him tumbling down inthe standings this week. Luck went 27 of 41 for 271 yards and three scores, but 
the two interceptions didn’t help him as his chances at an undefeated season, and perhaps the Heisman, took a shot in a 53-30 loss to Oregon.Keenum sits steady in third after 
another solid performance for unde-feated Houston. He connected on 22 of 29 passes for 325 yards and three scores before heading to the benchin the third quarter to take the rest of the game off. Houston went on to put 
up 73 points against Tulane and improve to 10-0.Richardson overtakes the top spot in 
this week’s poll after another strong performance for the Crimson Tide. Against Mississippi State, Richardson rushed for 127 yards, eclipsing the century mark for the seventh time in 10 games. Richardson also added a 
touchdown on the ground as Alabama rolled to a 24-7 victory.

Junior forward Jennifer George 
has taken 17 shots this season — 16 
came against Stetson .
George scored a career-high 21 
points and grabbed nine rebounds 
in the Gators’ 71-57 win against the 
Hatters (1-1) in the O’Connell Center on Monday night.
“I just worked on posting up more 
and wanting the ball,” George said. “I was just trying to own the paint, unlike I did in our first game.”
George’s performance comes 
on the heels of a one-shot, three-
rebound effort in Florida’s 69-66 
season-opening loss to Michigan on Friday.
When Butler saw George barely 
made a mark on the stat sheet, she planned on having Florida (1-1) fo-
cus on getting the ball into the paint 
Monday.
“[George] knew Friday’s effort 
was not her best, and she accepted that,” Butler said. “That’s a hard to thing to do, to say, ‘My bad, y’all. 
I’m better than that.’”
While George was nearly nonex-
istent in the Gators’ loss to the Wol-
verines on Friday, senior guard Dea-na Allen didn’t play after suffering a concussion in practice Nov. 6.
But Allen returned to the lineup 
against Stetson and provided a much-needed offensive spark. 
She played 19 minutes, scoring 11 
points and grabbing eight rebounds. Allen and George were the only Gators to score in double figures.
“I was hyped all over again,” Al-
len said. “[Monday] was my actual 
first game of contributing with the 
rest of my teammates.”
UF fared much better offensively 
Monday, making 28 of 60 shots for a 46.7 shooting percentage.
However, the struggles from 
3-point range continued, as the Gators connected only once in 10 tries.
“The best thing about that stat is 
the 10 part,” Butler said. “The im-provement was recognizing, ‘Here’s what’s not working, so let’s quit do-ing that.’”The first half was a tightly con-
tested 20 minutes, as the Gators and Hatters exchanged the lead 10 times and were tied on four different occa-sions.
However, Stetson’s 30-29 halftime 
lead would prove to be their last ad-vantage of the night. Florida started the second half on an 8-0 run, pulling 
ahead 37-30 with 18:06 remaining.
Sophomore forward Kayla Lewis sparked the spurt, scoring six points 
and registering a steal to help put UF ahead for good.
“When post players run the floor, 
and they run the floor every single 
time and get out ahead of the tran-

� FLORIDA IS NATION’S 
MOST PENALIZED TEAM.

The Gators have a prob-
lem, and coach Will Mus-
champ is going to great lengths to try to solve it.
With 8.3 penalties per 
game, Florida is the most penalized team in the nation — not the kind of title Mus-champ was hoping for in his first year in Gainesville.
“We’ve emphasized it 
as much as we can,” Mus-champ said Monday. “We’re exhausting every measure we can (to fix the prob-lem).”
The team pumps crowd 
noise into practice every day and uses hard counts against the defense “probably once every two to three snaps,” but Muschamp is also get-ting creative to try to curb the Gators’ penalty woes.
He said the team has 
made shirts with the phrase “Hard Count” printed on them to emphasize staying onside. Coaches are even sending text message to players to ingrain the man-tra into their minds.
“We’re trying every-
thing,” Muschamp said. “We’re just trying to empha-size it a different way. That’s all we’re trying to do.”
While the national rank-
ing in penalties hasn’t al-tered since the calendar turned to November, the Gators have shown signs of improvement. In two No-vember contests, Florida has committed three and five penalties against Vanderbilt 
and South Carolina, respec-
tively, for a total of 47 yards. 
UF has decreased its aver -
age number of flags by one per outing in November. 
The team’s average penalty 
yards per game has dropped 
from 70.88 after the loss to Georgia, which put UF at 115th nationally, to 61.4 — 
tied for 93rd.
Although the numbers 
are down considerably from 
earlier in the season, the Gators are still committing 
penalties in crucial situa-
tions, like defensive tackle 
Dominique Easley’s offside penalty on third-and-2 late in the game that extended 
the Gamecocks’ clock-killing 
drive.
Defensive end Sharrif 
Floyd attributed the prob-
lems to a lack of focus, but 
Muschamp said it also has 
to do with Florida making 
such mistakes before, giv-ing other teams film to try to prepare and make the Gators 
force the same errors. 
“We’re going to continue 
to do a better job; we’re not 
doing a good job, obvious-ly,” Muschamp said. “When you see us jump offsides, everybody else says, ‘That’s a pretty good idea, let’s try that.’”

ST. PETERSBURG — Dante Fowler Jr. 
could be considered either one of high 
school football’s biggest question marks or 
one of its boldest exclamation points.
At 6-foot-3, 232 pounds, Fowler carries 
the title of the nation’s No. 1 defensive end 
recruit, according to Rivals.com. 
Beneath the evasive façade and tough 
bravado, though, is just an 18-year-old with a soft voice and a wide-toothed smile — and an easily ignited temper.
After an on-field dispute last season, 
Fowler was ejected from a game and served a one-game suspension from the Florida High School Athletic Association.
Then, in early September, according to 
the St. Petersburg Times, a growing ten-sion between Fowler and his coaches at St. Petersburg Lakewood High was detonated by one maverick play. Fowler, frustrated by being double 
teamed in Lakewood’s season opener against Seminole High, went rogue and recorded a sack despite orders from his 
coaches to remain inside. Then came a 
four-week suspension from coach Cory Moore.
Against St. Petersburg High on Friday 
night, Fowler also got into trouble, begin-
ning with a late hit in the first quarter, af-
ter which he taunted the offensive lineman he had pushed around. 
He was also involved in a dispute in-
volving a few players from both teams on the St. Petersburg sideline after a player was pushed out of bounds.
“Yeah, I get out of line a lot,” Fowler 
said, “but I’m going to have to practice on that in college.”
Coupled with his on-field aggression is 
a senior season in which Fowler has failed to meet expectations and his own goals. 
Before the season, Fowler had set a goal of 25 sacks. Instead, he watched his team go 5-0 from afar before rejoining the squad that has now ended its season on a 1-4 note.
Fowler ripped off his helmet nearly ev-
ery time his cleats crossed the Lakewood sideline Friday night, often throwing it to the ground in irritation. 
For a defensive lineman heralded for 
his pass-rushing ability and knack for disrupting offenses, Fowler seemed to consistently be the far -
thest Lakewood defender from the ball. 
He recorded just one 
and a half tackles before 
halftime and capped the 
37-14 loss with five tackles and two as-
sisted tackles. He was also pulled out for a few fourth-quarter plays and later rein-stated at tackle.
“It’s a tough loss,” Fowler said. “The whole season, teams have been 
scheming against me … but I’m glad I made it through my senior season, all four years with not like a real bad injury. 
“I’m ready to take it to the next level.”He has been a soft oral commit to FSU 
since last December. 
After stating he would keep everyone 
guessing until National Signing Day on 
Feb. 1, he retracted comments about tak-
ing official visits to UF, Southern Califor -
nia, LSU and Clemson during a trip to Tal-lahassee last weekend. 
Fowler was originally scheduled to 
take an unofficial visit to Florida during the Vanderbilt game two weeks ago before making an official visit in January. 
It is unclear whether he still plans to at-
tend UF’s game against FSU on Nov. 26.
Oral commitments are non-binding until 
a national letter of intent is signed on or after National Signing Day on Feb. 1, 2012.

him reminds me of a throwback 
guy of a long, long time ago. You have guys that are really big and strong, but he understands how to use his size.”
In last season’s matchup, 
Sullinger and Young, both highly touted freshmen at the time, had an opportunity to showcase their skills to a national audience. Sullinger clearly took advantage of the spot-light and went on to have an All-America season while Young saw the court for just 12 minutes in the 
game.
“I just thought I could go in there 
and could compete against him, 
because I’ve done it in AAU be-fore,” Young said. “I thought, ‘My time’s going to come when I get the chance to just play against this guy again, hopefully, one day.’”
Now, as UF’s focal point in 
the paint, the 6-foot-9, 247-pound Young does not have to worry about playing time Tuesday in Columbus, Ohio. He will face the tall task of trying to slow down Sullinger with a different approach than departed seniors Alex Tyus and Vernon Macklin used.
“The gameplan is to keep him 
off the boards, not let him get any-thing easy,” Young said. “He’s a good player. He’s going to score a few points here and there, but don’t let him get anything easy.”
Half of Sullinger’s rebounds in 
the previous matchup came on the offensive glass, and he was able to finish above the rim for an easy 
dunk seven times.
Rebounding has been a concern 
for Donovan through Florida’s ex-
hibition and first regular-season game. With more depth at guard than in the post, he is expecting UF’s perimeter players to have a larger role.“That will be a big factor in the 
game: our rebounding,” junior guard Kenny Boynton said. “Both teams will miss shots. ... Sometimes it’ll just be (Sullinger) and four oth-er guys down there, and he comes down with the rebound.”
While the Buckeyes did lose 
three seniors, including 6-foot-5 swingman David Lighty, who also scored 26 points against the Gators, OSU returns a strong core in shoot-ing guard William Buford and point guard Aaron Craft.
Like Florida’s Young, both 
are on the Naismith and Wooden Award Watch Lists for Player of the Year. 
“We’re just going to try to con-
tain (Sullinger) but let him have 
what he wants,” Boynton said. “But 
other than that, try to contain the other players and not let the other players have big games also.”

After 21 years at Florida and 
25 years of coaching college 
volleyball, Mary Wise doesn’t come across many firsts. 
But after watching Chloe 
Mann, a sophomore middle blocker just a couple weeks re-moved from being a small role player, lead the Gators to two weekend victories, Wise was impressed.
“I can’t remember in our 
tenure here somebody [emerg-ing] that way ,” Wise said. 
Against LSU and Arkan-
sas, Mann, 6-foot-1, put on two of the better individual per -
formances in Florida history . First, she used a size advan-tage against the Tigers’ middle blockers on Friday night en route to the second-highest sin-gle-game hitting efficiency in 
NCAA history by a player with 
20 or more attempts. Mann had 18 kills on 20 swings for a .900 hitting percentage. 
In Sunday’s game, Mann 
broke the UF record for points and kills by a middle blocker since 25-point rally scoring be-gan, both marks she previously 
set on Friday. During the five-
set match, Mann had 19 kills and five blocks. 
Friday’s game was the best 
overall hitting performance by a Gator since 2002, when All-America middle blocker Bena-via Jenkins had 12 kills on 13 attempts against UCF. Mann’s recent playing time 
has come at the expense of se-nior middle blocker Cassandra Anderson, who carried a start-
ing role since midway through 
her freshman year. Before Flor -
ida’s Oct. 30 game against Ken-tucky , Mann had taken just 14 swings in seven Southeastern Conference appearances .
In her new starting job, 
Mann has been given a larger offensive role than either of 
her middle blocker teammates. 
During the weekend, Mann averaged 6.2 swings per set. In comparison, Betsy Smith and Anderson have averaged 2.95 and 3.14 this year, respectively.
“Her contact point is very 
different from Betsy and Cas-
s a n d r a ’ s , ” 
Wise said. “It’s way up there. It’s easier to set, but it’s dif-ferent.”
On Sun-
day, An-derson saw 
her first game action since the Kentucky match but played a support role in comparison to Mann, who became the first middle blocker to be named SEC Offensive Player of the Week since 2007.
“Cassandra has been Chloe’s 
greatest ally ,” Wise said. “I’ve 
never been more proud of Cas-
sandra than how she’s handled the past couple weeks and es-pecially how she came in and played [Sunday].”Mann goes from 
backup to UF star
