Terry Anderson shares his experience as a reporter in the Middle 
East on Wednesday during his international journalism class in Weimer Hall. Anderson was held by Shiite Hezbollah militants while reporting for The Associated Press from 1985 to 1991.

After the brutal murders of two American 
journalists abroad, one UF professor is giving his 
insight on the state of international journalism. 
The death of Steven Sotloff captured national 
attention when a video of his beheading by the 
Islamist terrorist group known as ISIS was re-
leased online Tuesday. Sotloff was held for a 
year before his murder. 
Journalists James Foley and Sotloff were be-
headed by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.
UF adjunct professor Terry Anderson is a 
former chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press.
The ﬁ  rst time he met his second daughter, she 
was 7 years old.
He spent the ﬁ  rst half of her life as a hostage 
in Beirut, Lebanon.
He was captured in 1985 by Shiite militants 
while covering the civil war in Lebanon. He was released in 1991.
Anderson is sharing his personal experi-
ence with terrorism by teaching a course at the UF College of Journalism and Communications called international journalism.
He said he is aiming to teach aspiring journal-
ists about the dangers of visiting conﬂ  ict areas, 
which has become more dangerous in recent 
years.
“(Students) need to know how to be more 
safe when in these dangerous situations,” An-derson said.
This knowledge comes after the abduction 
and murder of James Foley, a freelance war cor-respondent, who was kidnapped by a Syrian militia in 2012. Sotloff’s capture followed suit in 
2013, also in Syria, by ISIS.
The US policy for dealing with terrorists is to 
deny any negotiations, but when they kidnap 
journalists to make headlines, that promise be-comes difﬁ  cult to keep.
Richard S. Conley, UF associate professor of 
political science, said it is an undesirable and tragic situation for all people involved in an in-ternational kidnapping.

To go along with its new name, CVS Health, 
the former CVS Pharmacy discontinued the sale 
of cigarettes and other tobacco products as of Wednesday. 
The new name is intended to reﬂ  ect CVS 
Health’s commitment to the well-being of its cus-
tomers, according to a company press release. 
In addition to halting the sale of tobacco prod-
ucts, CVS Health is offering a new smoking cessa-
tion program to help smokers quit.
Cigarettes, rolling papers and chewing tobacco 
no longer line the shelves behind the store’s regis-ters. Instead signs read, “Let’s quit together,” and products designed to help people quit, like Nicor-ette, are on display. 
Although the company no longer sells tobacco 
products, customers who haven’t heard the news yet are still going to CVS Health stores hoping to buy them.
Ashlei White, a 23-year-old sales associate at 
a Gainesville CVS Health store, located at 901 N. Main St., said within an hour of getting to work on Wednesday, two people came in wanting to buy cigarettes. 
“There are still people who don’t know that we 
don’t sell tobacco products, but we just don’t have that here anymore,” she said. 
Alex Barshel, a 21-year-old UF environmental 
science senior, said she doesn’t smoke but thinks 
CVS Health has the right to sell, or not sell, what 
it wants. 
“You can get cigarettes anywhere,” she said. 
“There’s a drug store on every corner.”CVS rebrands to

Santa Fe College is competing for $1 million after being rec-
ognized as one of the top 10 community colleges in the nation.
For the second time, Santa Fe has been selected for the As-pen Prize for Community College Excellence Program, which 
honors high achievement and performance among community colleges in the nation. It was previously selected in 2012.
But Jackson Sasser, president of Santa Fe College, said he 
hasn’t thought about the prize money.
“We have known this over a month, but we have not talked about (winning),” Sasser said. “For us, it’s what we do. It is about student success and good job placement.”
The prize is awarded every two years and is on its third 
cycle. Out of more than 1,000 community colleges, 150 are se-
lected to apply on the basis of completion, employment and 
earnings, and high levels of access and success for minority and low-income students.

Throughout JT Reale’s time 
spent at UF, he has never par-
ticipated in the UF student foot-ball lottery. 
Reale, a 20-year-old pub-
lic relations senior, is part of a growing trend of students who feel that the college football ex-perience is about more than just the game. 
“I don’t see the need to enter 
the lottery,” he said. 
According to The Wall Street 
Journal, declining student ticket 
sales has become an escalating 
trend on college campuses na-tionwide. 
The Journal found a 22-
percent decrease in attendance at UF football games from 2009 to 2013. Meanwhile, student at-tendance nationally decreased by 7.1 percent on average since 
2009. 
Daniel Apple, assistant di-
rector of communications for 
UAA, wrote in an email that UAA did not sell out for season 
tickets this year.
“I don’t think there is one particular reason that the num-
bers declined,” he said.  
“I think that there are many 
factors and that it’s a nation-
wide problem that schools are losing student attendance and attendance in general,” he added. 
However, Apple said UF 
still has the fourth-highest stu-dent attendance in the country. 
Bre Rouse, a 22-year-old UF 
architecture senior, has never entered the lottery because she does not have time to attend the games, which can be all-day af-fairs. 
She said the declining at-
tendance could be attributed to the football team not playing as well as they have in previous 
seasons.
 “It’s not exciting anymore, 
so people don’t want to go,” 
she said. “When it’s exciting, people go. When it’s not, they don’t.”
On Sunday, about 1,500 stu-
dent lottery tickets remained unsold. 
But even without selling 
out the Idaho game, which was later suspended and ruled a no contest, the UAA sold more student tickets for the opening game than were sold for the 
2013 opener against Toledo, 
Apple said. 
Reale wondered if more stu-
dents would buy tickets if they were sold on a game-by-game basis instead of packaged in the lottery. 
“Personally, I know a lot of 
my friends do the same thing 
that I do,” he said. 
He added, “They just buy 
guest tickets for the games they 
want to go to”
Within the UAA, Apple said 
there is always an ongoing dis-cussion to see what can be done to improve the process of stu-dent ticket sales. 
Even through the rain, he 
said Saturday’s game was a testament to how much UF stu-dents come out to support the Gator football team.Student football ticket sales

The Florida Education Association 
is challenging the state’s most recent 
expansion of its K-12 tuition assistance program, the Florida Tax Credit Schol-arship Program.
The FEA — among others — ﬁ  led 
a lawsuit last week alleging that the state’s program, which provides in-come-eligible students scholarships for private school tuition, is an unconsti-tutional attempt to divert funds from Florida’s public schools. 
The program is funded through 
corporate donations, but donors are 
provided tax credits. These tax credits 
end up costing the state money in lost revenue, opponents argue. 
 “I think the major concern we have is that there are students throughout the state of Florida that need to have better attention paid to them,” said 
Mark Pudlow, spokesman for the 
FEA.
In 2006, the state Supreme Court 
deemed a similar program unconstitu-tional. The Florida Opportunity Schol-ars Program, however, was directly appropriated money by the state. 
Proponents of the current pro-
gram’s expansion hope that changes 
in how it is funded will allow it to be 
viewed as constitutional. 
Jason Nance, an assistant professor 
in the Levin College of Law, said prov-ing the program’s constitutionality will be difﬁ  cult. 
One question Nance raised was 
whether the overall budget for public schools would decrease.FEA sues over private 
school tuition tax credits

UF Health Shands Children’s 
Hospital revealed a new entrance 
along with the Sebastian Ferrero Atrium on Wednesday as part of its ongoing renovation projects.
The atrium includes a dedica-
tion wall honoring its namesake, Sebastian Ferrero, a 3-year-old who passed away at Shands in 2007. 
The $11 million atrium and exte-
rior were presented Wednesday in front of crowd of physicians, hospi-tal staff and donors. 
Inspired to honor their son’s 
memory, Sebastian’s parents launched the Sebastian Ferrero Foundation, which advocates for advancements in pediatric care.
David Guzick, president of UF 
Health, said the revealing is “a cul-mination of a vision that started four or ﬁ  ve years ago to give an identity to a dedicated children’s hospital.” 
He said remaining projects in-
clude renovations of the neonatal intensive care unit and a pre-and-post operative area for pediatric surgical patients.
Featured at the entrance of the 
children’s hospital is a sculpture, “Tomorrow,” created by artist Romero Britto and commissioned by the Sebastian Ferrero Founda-tion. 
“It’s a realization of a dream in 
memory of our son, but for the ben-eﬁ  t of so many children and fami-
lies for decades to come,” Horst Fer-
rero, Sebastian’s father, said.  Children’s Hospital un-
veils colorful entrancePrize winners announced in March
of those colleges that applied, said Leigh Arsenault, 
Aspen College Excellence Program manager. 
“I think year after year, Santa Fe has exceeded 
the national average in completion and transfer,” Arsenault said.
Arsenault said there is national consensus that 
community colleges serve an important function in higher education as they enroll the majority of fresh-men and sophomores in the country. The prize is meant to recognize the work within the top colleges, spotlight the successes and encourage replication. “We do ask that (the winners) share with us how 
the money is used,” she said. “We know that the col-leges have been achieving exceptional results, and we allow them to use that to continue the work.”
In line with Aspen’s ideals is Santa Fe’s support 
of minority groups. 
“A student coming from a non-majority ethnic 
group has a better chance of succeeding here than most colleges,” Sasser said. “That’s a priority to us – to promote success for all students.”
Sasser said he is looking forward to Aspen’s 
campus visit to share the culture of Santa Fe before the winners are announced in March. SANTA FE , from page 1
He spoke about Sotloff’s death
(airplanes),” Conley said. “Now, 
they’re focusing on the media and people in the press.”
Anderson said journalists 
don’t have to make any mis-
takes to become hostages while 
abroad.
“Just being in a dangerous 
area is all it takes,” he said, add-ing that the victims shouldn’t be blamed.
Emily Weiss, a 19-year-old ﬁ  -
nance sophomore and cousin of Sotloff, found out about his death 
during her stress and anxiety 
management class.
“I just got an outpour of texts,” 
she said. “My stomach dropped, and I knew.”
Weiss said every day of his 
disappearance was a constant worry and what got her through was his love of life.
“I knew he wouldn’t want us 
to constantly worry about him,” she said.
Weiss said Sotloff only want-
ed to report the truth.
“He was truly an adventure,” 
she said. “He wanted to be where the action was. He was very, very passionate.”TERRY , from page 1THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 4, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

� IT PREPPED WITH A HALF-
TON OF CHICKEN.
WM. JARED SIMMONS
Alligator Contributing Writer
A Midtown restaurant served 
more than 1,000 students free food 
Wednesday afternoon, including 
coolers of sweet tea and more than 
a half ton of chicken.
From 4 to 7 p.m., a line wrapped 
around The Coop, located at 1620 
W. University Ave. 
“I originally only shared (the 
event) with my friends, and I only 
promoted it on Facebook twice,” said manager Adrienne Harrow. “It 
just kind of blew up from there.”
Harrow set up the Facebook 
event in coordination with KISS 
105.3 and The Coop’s owners, Dar-
ren Kay, 27, and Steven Kay, 30. 
The radio station played music for the crowd waiting in the heat.
The giveaway generated more 
than 23,000 page views on the com-
pany’s Facebook page, Harrow said.
One of those views was Samm 
Mattson, a 21-year-old UF tourism 
and hospitality management se-nior, who was first in line. 
“I mean, it’s free food, so I made 
sure I was first,” she said.
The restaurant held a similar 
event early this year, when they ran out of food, so they more than qua-drupled the supplies they brought in for the day.
The Coop also advertised its 
new late-night window, which will be open until 3 a.m. every Wednes-day through Saturday.
There to watch the brothers’ busy 
day was their mother, Sue Kay.

sible,” she said. “Mama’s proud.”The Coop gives away free chicken, tea with KISS 105.3 eventMELISSA MIHM

A Gainesville man was arrested 
shortly before midnight Tuesday and 
charged with driving under the influ-
ence and leaving the scene of a crash 
that involved injuries. 
Gainesville Police officers re-
sponded to a hit-and-run at about 10:30 p.m. involving Dail Z. Mills, 25, 
who was driving a pickup truck close 
to Northeast Ninth Street. Police say 
Mills ran the eastbound stop sign and 
hit a Mercury, which was heading 
north on the same street at the time. 
Mills drove away from the scene, 
and a witness followed him to his residence, located at 3003 NE 11th Terrace. The witness then notified the 
responding officers. 
Mills appeared impaired and per-formed poorly on field sobriety tests. 
Mills was taken to GPD and blew two breath samples, which read 0.158 and 0.146. The legal limit is 0.08.
After the DUI 
investigation, Mills 
was transported to 
UF Health Shands 
Hospital for medical 
clearance. 
Gainesville Fire 
Rescue had to cut and remove the car 
doors to get the in-
jured passenger, who was complain-ing of back and neck pain, out of the 
vehicle.
There was an estimated $2,000 
worth of damage.

� THE BURGLARY WAS ON AUG. 10.

A man is wanted for burglarizing a house 
while the victim was still inside on Aug. 10, 
according to the Gainesville Police, and de-
tectives are looking for the suspect.
Nathaniel Heath, whose last known ad-
dress is 4129 Alpine Drive, forced his way 
into the back door of a house located on the 
1000 block of Northwest Fourth Avenue. 
Police released his identity Wednesday. 
The victim was in her bedroom when 
police say Heath entered the house.
Heath stole two purses and a Hewlett-
Packard laptop from the victim as she ran across the street to a friend’s house, police said. The victim and her friend then saw Heath 
leaving her house through the front door. Heath got into a 2005 gray Volvo XC90 and 
drove north on Northwest 10th Street. The 
tag number on the Florida license plate is 324PDL. 
An officer later found Heath in the ve-
hicle, pulling into his last known address. Heath then fled across Northwest 24th Bou-levard, ignoring the officer’s commands to stop, according to the release.
The victim’s stolen items were recovered 
from the front seat of the vehicle.
GPD Dispatch asks that anyone with in-
formation on Heath contact the department at 352-955-1818.

anonymous tips via text message to 274637 using the keyword “GPDFL” and their tip.Police ask for information

College students no longer have to worry 
about their younger siblings tagging along to 
Miami’s Ultra Music Festival. 
Attendees now must be 18 or older to par-
take in the festival’s electronic beats, flower 
headbands and sweaty crowds. 
Bre Berry, a 20-year-old UF advertising 
senior and director of Swamp Records, said 
it was obvious for Ultra to ban minors. 
“The culture of EDM is very adult-
themed, so people under 18 should not be allowed into Ultra,” she said. “I’m sure Ultra was under pressure from the City of Miami as well.”The festival, scheduled for March 27 to 29 
of next year, was heavily criticized after in-cidents, including a guard getting trampled and an attendee dying from an overdose. 
Chloe Ehrlich, a 20-year-old UF advertis-

The Repurpose Project is moving two 
doors down from Satchel’s Pizza.
The nonprofit that reuses resources 
for art, school and household supplies 
announced Tuesday night that it will set 
up shop in Mallard’s Upholstery, about 3 miles away from its original location. 
“I was emailing Satchel three and a 
half years ago, and he had mentioned this place. That was before we even started The Repurpose Project,” said co-founder Sarah Goff. “So it’s kind of funny how things have worked out.”Plans for the new, bigger building at 
1920 NE 23rd Ave. include an in-house workshop and an entertainment venue, which will contain a permanent stage, a deck with seating, a bar area, ample park-
ing and a children and family zone.
“It’s a big undertaking,” said co-found-
er Mike Myers. “This is four times the size 
of where we’re in now. You couldn’t ask for more.”
Kelsey Luksovsky, a 20-year-old UF 
public relations junior and Repurpose Proj-ect intern, said Satchel’s is a far-reaching 
and influential aspect of the community. 
“It will be great to raise awareness about 
what we do,” she said.
The Repurpose Project needs commu-
nity members to help with the move.To

“I originally only shared 
(the event) with my friends, 
and I only promoted it on 
Facebook twice. It just kind of 
blew up from there.”

of Scott’s allies 
speaks volumes
There’s an old Japanese proverb that says, “When the char-
acter of a man is not clear to you, look at his friends.”
Applying this adage to Florida Gov. Rick Scott is some-
what difﬁ  cult because he doesn’t seem to have many friends these days. A June poll from Public Policy Polling found that 
Scott’s approval rating was just 39 percent, making him one of 
the most unpopular governors in America. 
Unfortunately for Scott, a number of the friends he does have 
are turning out to be corrupt criminals.
On Aug. 27, Scott Batterson, one of Scott’s appointees to 
the state’s Expressway Authority, was convicted on charges of bribery and other corruption. Batterson faces up to 15 years in prison. The Orlando Sentinel reported that Batterson and his al-lies planned to take over the authority and use its $300 million 
in toll revenues to “win contracts for friends and further their 
own careers.”
Batterson is far from the ﬁ  rst Scott ally to engage in corrupt 
and illegal practices. Last year, Scott’s current chief of staff, Adam Hollingsworth, admitted that he repeatedly lied on his 2011 membership application to Enterprise Florida, a public-private economic development agency.
Hollingsworth’s predecessor, Steve MacNamara, resigned 
in 2012 following revelations of a scandal in which MacNamara 
helped secure lucrative no-bid contracts for his associates.
In February, Manny Maroño, former mayor of Sweetwater 
and a close ally of Scott, began serving a prison sentence for his 
own corruption scandal.
It’s also worth remembering that Scott himself has a criminal 
past. Before his election to the Florida House of Representatives, Scott was the CEO of Columbia/HCA, a health care conglomer-ate. During Scott’s time at Columbia/HCA, the company was involved in a $1.7 billion Medicare fraud settlement, the largest 
such settlement in Medicare history. 
In 2000, Scott gave a deposition in which he invoked the 
Fifth Amendment, which protects American citizens from self-
incrimination in criminal investigations, a remarkable 75 times.
Even if Scott wasn’t directly responsible for his company’s il-
legal activity — and that’s a generous assumption — the corrupt behavior of his friends and associates is a clear demonstration of his own character. 
At this point, the best defense one could present for Scott is 
that he is an aloof and incompetent executive unaware of the rampant corruption taking place on his watch.
Leaving aside Scott’s numerous policy failures during his 
time as governor, his penchant for appointing and associating with corrupt individuals is a shameful mark on our state. 
Scott is far from the ﬁ  rst corrupt Florida politician, but there’s 
no doubt that he’s mastered the art.
In November, Florida voters will get the chance to reject four 
more years of the corruption that Scott has allowed to run ram-pant in our state. The people of Florida deserve better than what Scott has to offer.Common Core opponents need a plan
I can’t stand numbers, and for good reason.
I am almost entirely right-brained, which means my 
mind sometimes works in mysterious and unconven-
tional ways. Most people have a good balance between the analytical, logical left brain and the creative, conceptual right 
— but I have much less of a distinction. 
My mind doesn’t work like an organized, functioning 
ﬁ  ling cabinet. Rather, it resembles a bundle of multicol-
ored yarn that somebody dragged through a conspicuously quaint coffee shop.
In my senior year of high school, I dreaded taking the 
PSAT/NMSQT, ACT and SAT, along with the multitude of other barbaric acronyms students in this country are subject-ed to during their educational careers. 
I was expected to stuff my wad of yarn neatly into a box 
and ship it off to some spreadsheet wizard I’ve never met, who would poke around in it for a while before turning it into a nice, neat number. It was horrifying. 
I’m not alone in my frustration with the uncompromising 
rigidity of America’s standardized testing system. People all over the country have been expressing their discontent about these kinds of tests for years. Increasingly, parents of elemen-tary, middle and high school students who are fed up with 
the kind of education their children are receiving have spo-
ken out against these tests. 
Opponents of standardized testing are also frustrated by 
the implementation of Common Core, a government initia-tive that seeks to establish a national standard for public edu-cation. A single national rule looks like a good idea, but the program relies heavily on standardized testing.
 It seems the government has decided these tests are the 
best way to measure the yarn balls and ﬁ  ling cabinets of mil-
lions of American students. 
Those pushing back against standardized testing received 
a bit of encouragement last week in a Lee County school dis-
trict meeting, where the school board voted to abolish the Common Core standards in the district. 
A crowd of concerned citizens showed their solidarity 
with the anti-Common Core movement by dressing in red. For three hours, they spoke their minds. One woman said the district 
sent a proctor to watch her son take the FCAT at his home because he was terminally ill and couldn’t take it at school. 
Cheers erupted when the board 
made its decision; the crowd booed down dissenting opinions from the superintendent, who said the decision would hurt the district’s 
children. Attendees also booed another speaker, who agreed with the decision but also asked for some sort of standard-ized plan to be put in place.
Unfortunately, the board met a few days later and re-
versed its decision, voting to opt back into the Common Core standards. The school board was likely responding to a warning from the superintendent that the district could lose $280 million in education funding if it didn’t fall in line with the rest of the state. 
Common Core has evolved from an idea meant to stream-
line education into a potent piece of political ammunition, with enough supporters among the rich and powerful that millions of dollars can be tossed around to protect it. 
Although the program has a number of wealthy support-
ers, Common Core is losing support among the general pub-lic. As much as 60 percent of the American public disagrees with Common Core standards in some capacity. 
Common Core has one major advantage: It is an existing 
and realistic plan to ﬁ  x America’s public education system. The plan is ﬂ  awed, drains the joy out of learning and turns kids into numbers — but it’s a plan nonetheless. 
It’s not enough for anti-Common Core groups to feel 
good about themselves for opposing a broken system. If any-thing is to be learned from Lee County, it’s that criticism and vetoes aren’t going to cut it any longer. 
If Common Core opponents want to challenge the sta-
tus quo, they must present a realistic alternative to modern America’s inadequate system of standardized testing.

lands will appear at High Dive on 
Wednesday. Doors open at 8 p.m., 
and the show begins at 9 p.m. Tick-ets are $12 in advance on either ticketweb.com or from Hear Again Music and Movies and the High

The Avenue spoke with Is-
lands’ Nick Thorburn, formerly of 
beloved indie-rock group the Uni-
corns, for a brief Q-and-A session. 
Do college-town shows tend to 
have a different atmosphere?
There’s good and bad elements 
of smaller college towns versus 
bigger cities where you’re getting a 
wider swath of the population. But 
college towns can sometimes be a very select group of people who, you know, drink to excess and sometimes borderline disrespect-
ful. But I also think it can also be a 
positive thing where there’s young people who really love music and just want to get out of world 
they’re in and have a night where 
they can get lost. That was music for me when I was in Montreal go-ing to school — hugely important. 
That “Rock And Roll Leg-
ends” segment on “Ski Mask” was hilarious. Did you say Derek Waters produced that?
I did — the lovely Derek Wa-
ters. He’s a dear friend of mine. 
We talked for a while about work-
ing together and collaborating on something. I had a very vague idea about doing a behind-the-music 
type special, and he was able to 
take that general idea and make it very funny. And he roped togeth-er some of his funny friends and turned it around in 48 hours. He’s 
a really talented and funny human 
being. Have you ever talked about 
getting involved with “Drunk 
History”?
He’d asked (me) to be a narrator 
for the first season, but they kind of overshot their invitations and I 
ended up being cut out, which is 
OK. I don’t think I’d want to be 
drunk on national television, but I was an extra in (one) episode. You can see me in the back. 
So “Ski Mask” is about to cel-
ebrate a birthday. Could you tell me more about the writing and recording process? You once said it was about “being angry,” but it doesn’t sound vitriolic or full of rage.
I don’t really know what I was 
talking about (laughs). I think it has this aggressive nature where instead of playing the victim card, which is maybe done on the pre-vious album — it was the breakup 
record, and I was feeling lost. With 
“Ski Mask” I was the gunship, and I had the shotgun vision. I’m not necessarily the aggressor, but I’m the master of my own fate. I don’t 
know if that’s angry, but it’s defi-
nitely more confrontational and assertive, which isn’t my general state. I’m not an assertive song-writer. I’m usually more reflective 
and ponderous. So this was po-
tent.
It seems that so many artists 
are driven to form their own la-
bels to escape control from bigger 
labels. Was there anything spe-cific that drove you to form your own label?
We were under contract with 
our label, (which) had been very cool and supportive for a time, but they had been tightening their 
waist belts, and we started to feel 
like less and less of a priority. This 
is becoming more of a popular, 
conventional thing for artists — self-released, enhanced distribu-tion deals where you have the dis-
tributor who does the heavy lifting 
but the artist has control. That was always a sticking point for me — 
being on a label where you give 
the record away in perpetuity. 
So you don’t ever envision 
yourself going back to a different label? 
I think so as long as there’s an 
infrastructure that I can curate. A label is just a bank really. It’s just a brand. If you want to be affiliated 
with Merge Records, that’s fine. 
But at the end of the day, you can hire all the people who do those jobs in-house where their job is specifically to do that one thing, 
whether it be radio, marketing 
or publicity. It’s just the norm, to sign to a label, but it’s totally out-moded. It’s traditional, but it’s not a currently relevant method of re-leasing music.
Is there a new Islands album 
in the works?
We’re pulling at a few new 
songs on this tour. We’ve got four 
new songs we’ve been working on 
in a live context. There’s no rush, and we’re going to try to take it slow and make everything sound right before we pull the trigger. But 
definitely there’s plans to make a 
new record. 
Everyone’s been talking about 
a Unicorns reunion lately. Do you 
find that irritating, or are you hap-
py that people are so invested?
I love it. I don’t find it irritating 
at all. It’s something I’ve come to terms with. I’m happy that there’s 
a modicum of interest about us 
getting back together. I think we were on to something, and I think we were trying something differ-ent. We were pretty young, in our early 20s, and we were pretty driv-en and sure of ourselves. I think 
that’s a very important quality to 
have. It’s an important stage in de-velopment. 
What stage of development do 
you think you’re at right now?
Humbled — the humble stage. 
The world is a big place. I don’t think I realized it back then. Now 
I feel like the world is big, and I’m 
small. I’m also grateful that I’m able to do everything, but it’s defi-nitely more fun to be in your 20s 
and think that you can run shit. 
Well, that’s all I got for now. 
Is there anything else I should 
know?
Just get ready to get your danc-
ing shoes on for Gainesville. It’s always been a blast and a party for us, so we’re ready to pull out all the stops.

This fall is the season of TV mediocrity. 
There isn’t a single show coming up that 
I’m over the moon about, as most prestige 
TV will air in the spring. I’m also not a huge fan 
of trying out a new series 
— I prefer to wait until a 
show is established and 
has a couple seasons un-der its belt before watch-ing. 
With that in mind, here are the shows I 
will be watching live come this fall and the shows I think have enough potential that I might watch in the future.

Within the last 20 years, there 
has been an international boom in 
TV channels devoted exclusively 
to food and cooking, including 
Cuisine TV in France and the Food Network and Cooking Channel in the U.S.
 The cooking shows range from 
competitions, reality shows and travelogues to the most traditional form of basic how-to-cook shows.
For many Americans, cooking 
and eating at home are becoming more unrealistic with long work hours and a fast-paced lifestyle. So, what is the draw? 
How is it that food TV, initially 
intended for housewives, now captures the attention of viewers across generations, socio-econom-ic levels and gender?
Maybe because cooking shows are entertaining. These hosts ap-pear to be more intent on estab-
lishing a relation-
ship with viewers than being in-structional. 
Rarely do we get enough de-
tails to be able to cook the recipe ourselves just by watching the show. 
Even the cooking technique 
practiced by the show host sug-gests spontaneity — few measure precise quantities, preferring a liberal hand in the addition of in-gredients. 
For instance, Rachael Ray of 
Food Network is famous for her Rachael-isms, or distinctive ex-pressions.  She uses terminology 
such as “two turns of the pan” 
when adding “EVOO” (extra vir-gin olive oil) to the skillet, or she will “eyeball it” by measuring the ingredient in her palm. 
Indeed, the reason for giving 
recipes on cooking shows seems 
to be more about imparting ideas 
and giving inspiration than on de-manding exact emulation. 
Sometimes, the show host gives 
a rundown of suggestions on how 
to expand the recipe, such as using 
extra roasted vegetables with lin-guine, stuff it in a sandwich, add to a salad, top with rice, etc. 
Shows can even be a form of 
advertising with hosts highlight-ing food-related products, cook-books and kitchen equipment. 
Cooking shows not only provide 
culinary instruction and consumer tips, but also offer the vicarious pleasures of cooking, eating and simulated companionship with 
show hosts — all reasons for the 
food-related networks’ irresistible draw for viewers.TV cooking shows: Do they or can 
they offer more than cooking tips?MICHELLE LÜCHAU

A UF psychology senior asks his 
roommate for his laptop and looks up 
a website. 
Sitting in the middle of his  living 
room amid dirty dishes and Xbox con-trollers, he lets out a loud cackle.
Roscoe Parsley, 21, looked up Check 
One Two, a campaign created by Brit-ish brothers Simon and Andrew Salter to raise awareness about testicular can-cer, one of the most preventable forms of the disease.
The Salter brothers encourage men 
— and sometimes women — to post funny or creative pictures on Insta-gram using the hashtag #FEELING-
NUTS to bring the cause to light. 
The campaign has even reached 
Emmy Award winner Aaron Paul, fa-
mous comedian Ricky Gervais and The Kooks, a British rock band.
Parsley says he checks himself reg-ularly and has never found an abnormal-ity. 
He said he loves 
the campaign and ﬁ  nds it to be a cre-ative way to catch social media savvies’ 
attention.
“I like it. I just think it’s a cool way 
to spread awareness,” Parsley said. “Much better than in a textbook.”
Check One Two also aims to educate 
men and women about the disease. 
The website, checkonetwo.co.uk, 
offers a comical tutorial on how to quickly check for abnormalities in six steps.
Dr. Paul Crispen, a urologic on-
cologist at UF Health Shands Hospital, said self-examination is harmless and relatively simple. 
Testicular cancer is a rare malignan-
cy, affecting only about one to three per hundred thousand men in the U.S.“It is, however, the most common 
malignancy of men between the ages of 20 and 40,” he said. “Thankfully, it is a very curable cancer.”
Nikolas Colley, a UF zoology ju-
nior, said although he had never heard of the campaign, he does check himself regularly.
Colley, 19, found an abnormality 
during his senior year of high school.
“There was just, like, a very perfect-
ly round kind of lump thing, he said. 
“So once I felt that it was only on 
one side and not the other, I thought, ‘Well, I need to go get this checked,’” he said.
Colley consulted a doctor who con-
ﬁ  rmed the lump was a harmless cyst after a testicular ultrasound.
“This nurse lady that I hadn’t ever 
seen in my life, she was pouring like warm jelly down there and poking and 
prodding with this thing that usually 
is used on pregnant women’s bellies,” he said. 
“I just found a kind of comedy in 
that.”Need a good excuse to feel your nuts?

Bunches of illustrated chickens 
form the word “YUM” on a blood-red 
background. A familiar sans-serif font in trademarked yellow letters reads, “they’re livin’ it” just beneath. 
This allusion to McDonald’s is just 
one of the posters in an exhibition that took place downtown on Friday, host-ed by a group of community design-ers from a local graphic design and printing company.
The group, neutral7, decided to 
tackle serious, worldwide issues by bringing awareness to the public through a series of 23 posters. 
The exhibition, called “#visual-
izewhatmatters,” took place at Jolie Events, 6 W. University Ave. It was followed by a silent auction, during which guests were able to bid on the posters. 
“I don’t think that anyone has done anything like this here in Gainesville,” 
said Albey Coronel, 
the creative director 
of the company. 
Despite some 
challenges with 
time and resources, Coronel said he 
is pleased about the exhibition’s out-
come. 
He said 100 percent of proceeds 
will go to non proﬁ  ts speciﬁ  c to the 
topics on each poster.
Rick Bales is one of the designers 
whose art was displayed at the exhibi-
tion. His pieces — “Desero,” “Yum” and “Unspoken Oppression” — vary 
in topics from religion, health and 
politics. 
“This is the ﬁ  rst show I’ve ever 
done,” he said. “I was surprised. I’ve never seen anything go up so quick-
ly.” 
Bales managed to ﬁ  nd work right 
after graduating from high school, de-signing on his own as a freelancer.
“There’s a lot of talent involved. 
There’s a lot that goes into a piece…
collaboration that made this possi-
ble,” he said.
Multimedia designer Scott Littler 
was one of the guests who attend-
ed the event after hearing about it 
through Facebook. 
“They’re pushing messages you 
don’t normally see,” he said.
Littler said the one thing he likes 
about Gainesville is that it’s a college town, which allows local artists to 
ﬂ  ourish and show off their work.
“It’s been kind of an adventure, 
honestly, putting this show togeth-
er…I think it’s probably the best work 
we’ve ever done,” Coronel said.
For the next 20 days, neutral7 will 
release posters daily via social media.

most “guilty pleasure” show coming back this fall. 
“Red Band Society” (Sept. 17) — A medical

Since the release of their debut jazz-pop hybrid album 
“Songs About Jane,” Maroon 5 has been in a consistently 
ﬂ  uctuating identity crisis. Are they a soul-pop band with 
funk infusions? Are they a synth-pop formula machine gen-erating replicated sound after sound? 
The answer depends on who you talk to, but with their 
aptly named ﬁ  fth effort “V,” the band continues to tread the 
precarious balance between soul and synth. 
Some songs are difﬁ  cult to place in a speciﬁ  c category. The 
ﬁ  rst single, “Maps,” plucks back and forth between frontman 
Adam Levine’s falsetto-driven verses and a densely backed 
chorus, while “It Was Always You” almost drops the beat 
with its electronic-backed second verse.  
“Animals” comes close to being a rhythm and blues track, 
with Levine’s vocals slinking back and forth between rang-
es easily, while “Unkiss Me” shows a slow grind of a verse 
building to a sighing chorus.
Seventies funk rears its ugly head a bit in “Sugar,” which 
sounds part Bee Gees and part Bruno Mars. “Feelings” is al-
most there with its bouncing bass line, but it gets lost in its synthesized “whoomp whoomp” backing sound. 
The album features a steady staff of writers and produc-
ers, including Fun.’s Nate Ruess co-penning the sweeping semi-ballad “Leaving California” and OneRepublic’s Ryan Tedder helping write and produce several tracks, including the more processed track “New Love.”
Stadium-ready power ballad “My Heart Is Open,” featur-
ing Gwen Stefani, is one of the few standout tracks. Stefani’s surprisingly soulful tone — a departure from both the harsh-er sounds of No Doubt and the higher pitched “Hollaback Girl”-era vibes — blends well with Levine’s, making for a 
particularly lovely moment on the album. 
And no wonder this track is a standout — it’s co-written 
by Sia, the songstress behind some of the most memorable 
Top 40 tracks of the past few years (see “Chandelier,” Rihan-na’s “Diamonds”).The deluxe version of the album also includes the softer 
“Lost Stars” from the “Begin Again” soundtrack, in which 
Levine played a folky musician whose rising stardom leaves 
Keira Knightley in its wake, and a cover of Marcy Play-ground’s “Sex and Candy.” 
The latter is a slow and sensual track akin to the early 
sounds of the band. Levine’s voice shines in this style of vo-
calization. 
Sure, he can hit that falsetto time after time, but his lower 
register rumbles just right on this.
As a whole, the album is a mixture of genres and sounds 
with a lack of origin that typiﬁ  es the general Maroon 5 sound as of late.
 However, that mesh of music doesn’t always ﬂ  ow well 
together. 
There are some moments that stand out, but overall, the 
album can’t ﬁ  nd a consistent link between the genres.Maroon 5: ‘V’ treads between soul, synthreview

Rain falls on Ben Hill Griffin Stadium on Saturday night during a weather delay that ultimately resulted in the sus-pension of Florida’s season opener against Idaho. The game was ruled a no contest on Wednesday.

Florida and Idaho will not face off again in Ben Hill 
Griffin Stadium this season.
The Gators’ suspended season opener against the 
Vandals has been ruled a no contest, UF announced on 
its website Wednesday. 
UF Athletics Director Jeremy Fo-
ley and Idaho Athletics Director Rob 
Spear both decided that rescheduling 
the game this season would be a vi-able option, but the two teams have decided to play a game in Gainesville during the 2017 season, according to 
a release.
“We looked at a number of options 
and, in the end, we both thought it was in the best in-
terest of our student-athletes and football programs to 
play out the remainder of our respective schedules as 
they stand,” Foley said in a release.
Added Spear: “I want to thank UF, especially AD 
Jeremy Foley, for the professional and first-class way they worked through this issue and the focus on stu-
dent-athlete welfare. It was not in our best interest to 
play 10 consecutive weeks without a bye week. We look forward to our return to Florida in 2017.”
The game experienced a two-hour, 48-minute delay 
due to lightning within an eight-mile radius from the stadium. Per NCAA rules, play has to be suspended for at least 30 minutes following a lightning strike within that radius.
Officials gave the all-clear for a 9:50 p.m. start time, Florida-Idaho game called no contest, teams will play in 2017

QUESTIONED HIS SUSPENSION POLICIES.
JORDAN MCPHERSON
Alligator Staff Writer @J_McPherson1126
Coach Will Muschamp has received 
criticism this week concerning his decision 
to lift the suspensions of wide receiver De-
marcus Robinson (university sanction) and 
nose tackles Darious Cummings and Jay-nard Bostwick (violation of team rules) on Monday.
And during the Southeastern Confer-
ence’s weekly teleconference on Wednes-day, the fourth-year UF coach answered those critics.
“There are a lot of things that go into 
discipline,” Muschamp said. “It’s about al-tering and changing behavior, which we’ve done here. I think our discipline speaks for itself and how we’ve handled our football 
team. ... At the end of the day, it’s more than that and there are a lot of things that 
go into those situations, a lot more than people know and it’s very frustrating for me as a coach or any coach to have some-
one being critical and you don’t even have 
all the information. 
“So at the end of the day I make the de-
cisions in this program, I handle the disci-pline in this program and it’s been handled 
very well.’’
This is the first time Cummings and 
Bostwick received a suspension during 
their tenure at UF, but it was the third time 
for Robinson, a sophomore who was sus-
pended for violation of team rules twice during his freshman year.
“He’s done everything we’ve asked him 
to do,” Muschamp said of the wide receiv-
er. “He’s a wonderful man to be around. 
He’s got a smile on his face all the time. I love Demarcus, he’s a great kid. Now just because you make a couple of poor deci-
sions doesn’t make you a bad person. He Muschamp responds to criticsEDEN OTERO

With the first road trip looming, the 
Gators are looking to put the past behind 
them and focus on creating an impres-
sion with its largest roster since at least 
1996.
On Dec. 6, Florida’s dreams of its first 
national title were dashed when Florida 
State took a 3-2 win in the second round 
of the NCAA Tournament, ending the Gators’ season.
After completing its opening week-
end with wins against Georgia Southern, 
Idaho and Oklahoma, No. 11 Florida is 
setting its sights on Tallahassee and Tul-ly Gym when it faces No. 8 Florida State tonight at 6 — not for revenge, but to 
show their competition that they are just 
as strong as last year.
“We’re focused on this year,” senior 
defensive specialist Holly Pole said. “We’re focused on going out tomorrow 
night and giving it our best and that’s all 
we’re worried about.” 
Pole played a pivotal role in Florida’s 
five-set win over Oklahoma on Saturday by taking on the libero position going into the third set for Florida to relieve se-
nior Taylor Unroe.
The Ocala native finished with 18 digs 
and one service ace against the Sooners.
Going against Flori-
da State won’t be easy. While putting their 
best foot forward is the first step for the Florida squad, coach Mary Wise 
is most focused on pre-
paring for FSU’s fast-
paced offense.
“In a relatively short period of time 
we’re trying to prepare for one of the fast-
est offenses in the country,” Wise said. 
“Florida State has been good for a 
while and this may be even a better team 
than the team that went to the Final Four 
— they have four new transfers that we 
didn’t even see in the spring starting for them — and so much of our attention has just been trying to prepare this team for Thursday night.”

but the game only got as far as 
the opening kickoff.
UF will pay Idaho its 
$975,000 guarantee for com-ing to Gainesville by Feb. 1, as outlined in their contract agree-ment. 
Fans who purchased tickets 
to the game will also be reim-bursed at face value — student tickets at $15 and regular game tickets at $25.
Florida’s new season opener 
will be Saturday against East-ern Michigan (1-0) at 4 p.m. in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. 
The last time Florida did not 
play its season opener on sched-ule was in 2004, when Hurri-cane Frances pushed the Week 1 game against Middle Tennessee 
back from Sept. 4, 2004 to Oct. 
16. Florida’s new season-open-ing opponent that year was also Eastern Michigan.
“I wish we could have played 
the game Saturday night, but I support the decision made by both athletic directors,” coach Will Muschamp said in a re-
lease. 
“As I said earlier this week, 
our focus is getting our play-
ers and team ready for Eastern 
Michigan and we are excited to 
get back out there in front of our passionate and loyal fans.”
Both Idaho and Florida had 
an open date on Oct. 25 — the weekend before Florida’s an-nual game against Georgia in 
Jacksonville. If they were to 
have played the game on that day, the Gators’ regular sea-son would have ended with 
UF playing nine consecutive 
games.
“The season’s a brutal 
stretch,” quarterback Jeff Driskel said. 
“When you get to playing 
four, five weeks in a row, you don’t have as much time as you like to really rest your body. 
Football’s obviously a physi-
cal game, not as much for me as it is for some of the linemen or running backs or linebackers that are constantly hitting each 
other, but it’s big mentally and 
physically to take a little time off and get back to where you want to be.”
Redshirt junior Valdez Show-
ers, who returned the opening kickoff 64 yards to the Idaho 14-yard line, agreed.
“It’s a long season and to be 
honest with you a lot of play-ers take advantage of those bye weeks, trying to really get in the treatment room and get treated 
up during the off week,” Show-
ers said, “but we definitely look forward to those bye weeks.” THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 4, 2014 § ALLIGATOR, 15

Leon Orr progressing: Redshirt 
senior Leon Orr is ready to make his mark.
After playing behind starters 
such as Sharrif Floyd, Dominique Easley and Damien Jacobs through-out his Florida career, Orr is ready to 
make an impact.
“He’s playing well, doing a good 
job,” defensive coordinator D.J. Dur-
kin said. “I think he understands his role has changed a little bit now. 
He’s been behind some really good 
players throughout his time. Now it’s his turn to step up and take on more of those reps.”
Durkin also sees development in 
redshirt freshman Caleb Brantley. 
“Caleb’s made great strides from 
throughout his time here — from when he first got here to right now,” Durkin said. “He’s gone leaps and bound. ... We’ve had to work on his 
practice habits and things he does, 
but that’s natural.”
Fowler’s lovin’ it: Dante Fowler, 
Jr. made a New Year’s resolution to 
lose weight. 
One way he’s accomplished that 
was giving up on eating one of his 
favorite foods — the McDonald’s Big Mac.
“I’m like six months clean or 
something. But nah, I mean, I feel good, just being healthier and just staying in shape,” Fowler said. “I’m 
feeling more better, my body is more 
leaner, I don’t have a lot of fat on me. So I’m able to just run around and just play football.”
Fowler then clarified that he 
had not eaten a Big Mac in eight months. 
Injury Report: Redshirt sopho-
more Jeremi Powell had his knee 
scoped and will be out for a few 
weeks, Muschamp said on the tele-conference.

fense is one of the biggest 
issues Florida is working to combat, the Gators still have 
to consider the impact that 
FSU junior outside hitter Ni-cole Walch will have in the match.
Florida State is coming 
off of a big win at then-No. 
7 Nebraska that saw Walch 
put up a double-double with 18 kills and 15 digs. 
In Florida’s final match of 
2013, Walch finished the five-
set FSU win with 22 kills, 15 
digs and three service aces.
With Walch and four 
transfers that Florida has 
seen little from, the Gators 
will have to find a way to slow down the Seminoles of-fense and stop Walch from putting up big numbers.
“This will be the ultimate 
test that we’ve had so far, playing on the road at Flor-ida State — they’ll have a huge crowd and they’ll come 
out and give us their best,” 
Unroe said. “So I think we’re just preparing as best we can on our side to try to combat what they do on Thursday.”Volley , from page 14“Now it’s his turn to step

For many teams, when the start-
ing players begin to get tired or are 
not having their best game, coach-es struggle with substituting and 
putting in a player off the bench.
So far this season, Florida has 
had no such problem.
Sunday’s victory against Okla-
homa State is a perfect example of 
this. 
It was a very hot game in Still-
water, Okla., so coach Becky Bur-
leigh utilized the depth of her ros-
ter to its full extent.
“I think depth is a strength 
of this team and this year we’ve 
been really committed to using it,” 
Burleigh said. “I think it’s paying off.”
It certainly paid off last week-
end, when players coming off the 
bench scored two of Florida’s ﬁ  ve 
goals in its two road games. 
One of those players was sopho-
more Brooke Sharp, who recorded 
an assist and a goal within about 
three minutes of each other against Oklahoma State.
“That’s what’s special about 
us,” Sharp said. “No matter who comes off the bench, our coach-es trust us that we can go in and 
make big plays and do something 
big for us.
“They (Oklahoma State) were 
just really tired. So it wasn’t hard to move the ball around and go in 
with a 100-percent effort.”
That is where having such a 
deep roster helps teams like Flor-
ida, especially playing in the Au-
gust and September heat. 
The Gators tire their opponents 
out and take advantage of their 
fresh players off the bench. 
Not a lot of teams have that 
luxury.
Sophomore Savannah Jordan 
is a regular starter at forward for the Gators, but she understands 
the importance of the players who 
come in later in the game and play a big role for the team.
“We have great depth this 
year,” Jordan said. “I think a lot 
of players this year are really step-ping up and ﬁ  lling in spots and even coming off the bench and be-
ing big players for us, so I think that can continue to go throughout the season.”
Throughout the season, Jordan 
has shown strong offensive play.
Four games into her sophomore 
season, the Fayetteville, Ga., na-tive has tallied 25 goals in just two 
seasons for the Gators and has re-
ceived accolades like Southeastern Conference Player of the Year, Na-tional Rookie of the Year and an 
All-American second team selec-
tion. 
She has scored in three of Flori-
da’s ﬁ  rst four games this year and credits her teammates for making 
the big plays around her.
“A lot of that is my teammates, 
they set me up for all those goals,” 
Jordan said. 
“I think all three (goals) actu-
ally came off of crosses or balls in from my teammates so I think I’m just getting in good positions and my teammates are doing a fantas-
tic job of ﬁ  nding me.”Depth provides Florida with 
opportunities to tire out opponents
