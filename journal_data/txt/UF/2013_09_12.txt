� MORE THAN 670 QUALIFIED.

Alligator Staff Writer cwright@alligator.org
After a slow start, more students qualiﬁ  ed and slat-
ed for UF Student Government Senate seats than last 
semester.
A record 674 students qualiﬁ  ed for the 2013 Fall 
elections, which are next month. 
In Spring, a total of 513 students qualiﬁ  ed, accord-
ing to Alligator archives.
Supervisor of Elections Justin Hoover said he tried 
to spread the word about qualifying through social me-dia and advertisements through the Gator Times and Channel 8 news in the dorms.
Wednesday, he said, was the biggest rush, with 465 
students qualifying in one day.
“People were trying to get in here and get it done,” 
Hoover said.
Students Party Campaign Manager Helie Dharia 
said her party will ﬁ  ll 44 seats on its slate, the same number as Spring 2013. A total of 61 students slated with the Students Party.
Overall, 550 students slated with the Swamp Party. 
Party Spokesman Joseph Michaels said the party will have a full slate with 50 seats.
“Swamp Party is conﬁ  dent that it has assembled the 
best candidates the University of Florida has to offer,” he said.
The remaining 63 students either did not slate with 
either party or intend to run as independents, Hoover explained.
Both parties announced their slates around mid-
night. A mandatory meeting for selected candidates will be held today at 9 p.m. in Rion Ballroom B in the Reitz Union.Record number of

MULBERRY, Fla. — Polk County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce depu-
ties arrested the Rev. Terry Jones of Dove World Outreach 
Center — which left Gainesville this summer — on Wednes-day afternoon after they found a smoker full of kerosene-soaked Qurans attached to the car he was riding in.At about 5 p.m., deputies arrested 61-year-old Jones  
about 35 miles east of Tampa on one count of unlawful con-veyance of fuel, according to a Polk County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce news release. His organization had planned to burn 2,998 copies of the Quran in a park, according to its website.
Jones will additionally face a charge of unlawful open 
carry of a ﬁ  rearm because some deputies said they saw him carrying a handgun in a Mulberry McDonald’s parking lot, according to the release.
Deputies also arrested the driver, 
44-year-old Dove World Outreach Pas-tor Marvin Wayne Sapp Jr., on charges of unlawful conveyance of fuel and invalid 
registration for the smoker attached to his car.
Deputies seized Sapp’s 1998 Chevrolet 
1500 pickup truck as well as the smoker 
containing the Qurans, according to the release. Terry Jones arrested, found with gas-soaked Qurans

Professors dimming the lights and 
reading off PowerPoint slides is noth-
ing new to college students, but a new study from Northwestern University states a teacher’s underperformance might be due to tenure.
The study followed freshman stu-
dents of tenured and nontenured faculty, rating the teachers by the stu-dents’ grades and how many of them took upper-level courses in the same ﬁ  eld after completing the introductory class. Tenured teachers were found to do poorly on both fronts, as opposed to adjunct or nontenured professors.
But Marc Heft, senior chairman of 
UF’s Faculty Senate, said giving a pro-fessor tenure doesn’t necessarily mean they’re going to become bad teachers.
“It’s not a fair assessment to say that 
once people get tenure they don’t care about anything anymore,” Heft said. “Some of the most outstanding teach-ers I’ve met are highly established ten-ured faculty members.”
He said the concept of tenure is a 
peer-review process where profes-sors are judged on their mentorship, teaching and research, among other things. Professors who achieve tenure, typically after a seven-year period, are given security in that their salaries are guaranteed by the university.
“It’s a bidirectional commitment,” 
Heft said. “It’s saying ‘we believe in you,’ while you give us your best work.”
He said not all faculty is brought on 
to teach, which is why some students might be dissatisﬁ  ed with their lectur-ers. Faculty brought on for research

By 10 a.m. Tuesday, locals were already 
bent over in the rich soil of Porters Com-
munity Farm, kneeling and pulling weeds to prepare for planting the next crop: let-tuce.
After a little more than a year in opera-
tion, the farm, located at 518 SW Third St., has grown more than 500 pounds of or-ganic produce and donated it to St. Fran-cis House. Now, as it gears up for the fall growing season, garden organizers are planning a series of how-to workshops to teach residents about gardening.
Travis Mitchell, the farm project man-
ager, said since the project started, the farm has continued to expand while also producing full-scale. A November gift of fruit trees from Chestnut Hill Tree Farm will take another year or two to get fully established.
Mitchell said one of the upcoming 
workshops will help residents learn how to start their own vegetable seeds and sam-plings, and to plant at home.
It will be held on Sept. 21 from 10 a.m. 
to noon, and the public is invited to regis-ter online at www.growgainesville.word-press.com.
Another workshop about harvesting 
rainwater will be held Oct. 5, which will demonstrate how to properly use rainwa-ter in gardens.
Zac Totta, a 21-year-old UF sustainabil-
ity and the built environment senior, said he originally came to the farm because he wanted to learn about growing food and agriculture.
Now, he said, he’s helping prep the 
ground for the cooler season and for new crops.
“I’m here to see the process of the pro-
duce that we grow, and it’s nice to spend time doing something physical while help-ing out the community in some way,” said Totta.
Donna Smith, director of A to Z Pro-
fessional Childcare Academy, said she’s taken groups to visit the farm during the last year. She said, so far, it’s had a positive impact.
“I feel that the vegetables grown over 
there are quality vegetables,” Smith said. “That does enhance the health and knowl-edge, even for the children, as they see them grow.”THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 3

On Monday, Facebook rolled 
out two new interfaces that will 
make the social media platform more public. By collecting valu-able feedback, it’s becoming more like Twitter, some locals say.
The application programming interfaces (APIs) pull content from users who have publicly posted information, and it may incorporate that information into a public news feed.
The interfaces allow major me-
dia networks such as Buzzfeed, CNN and NBC’s “Today” show access to ﬁ  nd and broadcast real-time talk about a given topic.
These networks can see the 
demographic breakdown — in-cluding the age and gender — of who’s buzzing about what on Fa-cebook.Bruce Floyd, UF’s social media 
specialist, said he’s excited about the APIs.
“It won’t change us,” he said. 
“It will affect companies by giv-ing them access to what people are talking about. They can mea-sure sentiment, cut out stuff peo-ple don’t like and keep the good content.”
He said it can also gather 
valuable information about pub-lic opinion, and he said Face-book implementing the platform makes sense because it’s where many people post declarations about trending topics.
Austin Wynn, a 19-year-old 
UF microbiology and cell science freshman, said he doesn’t like the idea of Facebook being scoured for media chatter.
“If media networks want in-stant feedback on their show or music, they should search a hashtag on Twitter,” Wynn said.  “Facebook should stay as a place to keep in touch with friends.”
Lakirra Turner, a 19-year-old 
UF East Asian languages and lit-erature junior, agreed. She said media networks shouldn’t be al-lowed to search through Facebook because that’s not the purpose of that social media platform.
“I like Facebook more sub-
dued,” she said. “Twitter is the hot spot for gossip and trends.”

UF social media specialistare primarily assigned a specific role while also 
undertaking a lecture, as opposed to professors who are expected to both teach and conduct re-search.
He said the issue of tenure doesn’t separate 
the good teachers from the bad but is instead a case-by-case basis.
“When I was in school, I had my share of 
good and bad teachers,” Heft said. “To say that just because someone becomes tenured they change what they do, is wrong.”
Barbara Romanova, a 21-year-old UF psy-
chology senior, said her experiences with ten-ured professors are typically good. She said she heard mixed reviews about a tenured professor at UF, but her time in his class went well.
“It gives them a sense of job security that al-
lows them to say, ‘I’m going to give it my all,’” Romanova said.
Andrew Kerr, a 20-year-old UF computer en-
gineer junior, said whether tenure makes for a bad teacher depends entirely on the professor.
“I’ve had crappy professors that I know for 
a fact weren’t tenured,” he said. “But I’ve never encountered a professor I knew was tenured and didn’t do a good job.”Not all faculty 
meant to instruct Sapp will receive citations for im-
proper lighting on the smoker as well.
As of press time, officials said Jones 
and Sapp were in the process of getting 
booked into the Polk County Jail.
Jones, whose ministry was based in Gainesville until July, sparked contro-versy after threatening to burn Qurans on Sept. 11, 2010. Later, church mem-bers did burn copies on site.
Geoffrey Panjeton, 22, a second-year 
UF medical student and president of the Muslim Medical Students Associa-tion, said he’s disappointed Jones hasn’t taken the time to understand the Quran and its similarities to other faiths.
“As a Christian priest, you would 
expect him to read it and see the way in which the Quran is calling to the same God,” he said. “Faiths are more similar than they are different.”
However, Panjeton said he hopes 
that, like the first Quran burning at-tempt, this incident will spark interfaith conversation.
“The hope would be that as more 
people access the Quran and see the Quran,” he said, “it becomes less exotic and different and strange and becomes more familiar.”
The 20-acre Gainesville property that 
Jones’ ministry vacated in the spring is now owned by another church, Spirit of Faith ministries.
In April, when Jones announced he 
would move his ministry south, he told the Alligator his goals wouldn’t change with his location.
He said he considered raising 
awareness about the moral, spiritual and financial condition of America his mission and that he would keep hold-ing rallies, conferences and demonstra-tions.
“We will continue with the 
same things we have done here in Gainesville,” he said.4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 2013

There’s a new iPhone in town, 
and it’s easier on the eyes and the 
wallet.
Apple announced the release of 
the iPhone 5c and 5s on Tuesday. The iPhone 5c costs $99 — with a two-year contract — for the small-est storage space and comes in five different colors. The phone has a polycarbonate plastic casing.
Ross Newman, CEO of iHospi-
tal, said the iPhone 5c is the entry-level model into the iPhone family and gives everybody the opportu-nity to be an iPhone owner.
The phone will be available in 
blue, green, pink, yellow and white. The 16 GB iPhone 5c costs $99 and the 32 GB costs $199.
Newman said the iPhone 5c is 
targeted to a younger audience and thinks high-school-age people will seek out the color option.
Newman described the features 
on the iPhone 5s as game-changing. He said the 5s will have a better camera and flash technology, as well as faster processing and Touch ID.
Touch ID reads any fingerprint 
programmed into the phone and will serve as a security feature, he said. The user just clicks the home button, and it unlocks the phone by reading the user’s fingerprint.
The iPhone 5c will go on presale 
Friday. However, Apple has yet to announce a preorder for the iPhone 5s. Both iPhones will go on sale Sept. 20.
Kelly Johnson, an 18-year-old  
UF telecommunication freshman, has the iPhone 4 and is due for an upgrade in November. Even though the iPhone 5c is less expensive, she said she will most likely get the 5s because of the software.
After seeing the new phone, 
Brandon Herndon said he didn’t think there was a big difference be-tween the iPhone 5 and the iPhone 5c.
“Nothing really struck me as 
something that I would want so badly that I have to have it,” said the 19-year-old biology sophomore.
But the lower price and different 
colors are features that could pro-mote sales among students, he said.
“Everyone wants an iPhone,” he 
said. “It’s part of the culture these days, so with it being less, then peo-ple are probably going to be buying them, especially college students.”

On the most polarizing scien-
tific issues like climate change, more 
knowledge does not necessarily lead to more agreement. Or so said science communication theorist and Yale law professor Dan Kahan when he gave the first presentation Wednesday for the 2013-2014 Center for the Human-ities and the Public Sphere Speaker Series, “‘Civil’ Society?”
Kahan spoke to students, profes-
sors and administrators Wednesday evening in the Smathers Library.
Kahan discussed his cultural cog-
nition thesis, which claims people will align some of their scientific be-liefs with the ones that are popular in the groups they want to belong to, regardless of how much science they know.
“People use their critical reason-
ing abilities in ways that make them fit into their group,” he said.
The speaker series is designed as 
a dialogue between science and the humanities that can lead to better understanding of how people sub-jectively interpret objective informa-tion, said Sean Adams, acting direc-tor of the center.
Rachel Walters, a 30-year-old 
postdoctoral geological sciences stu-dent, was one of about 60 people in the audience.
“It’s important to try to start fixing 
the disparity between what the pub-lic believes and what science says, especially in controversial issues like climate change,” she said.

month speaker series is on Oct. 15.Yale prof talks beliefs at UF � THE OUTDOOR

The Hub may not be new, 
but students are noticing its 
improvements.
A project that broke 
ground on May 6 was meant to resolve the overcrowding in and outside the Hub with additional seating.
According to Alligator ar-
chives, the renovations were projected to cost $350,000.
In an email interview, 
Chandler Rozear, project manager of architecture and engineering with the UF Physical Plant Division, said the renovations alone ended up costing about $335,000, but the total cost of the proj-ect was above that estimated amount.
“The total cost of the 
project, including design, permits, outages and inspec-tion fees, pushed the project cost to a bit over $417,000,” Rozear said.
Still, he sees the renova-
tions as having a positive ef-fect on the Hub and the area around it.
“It has proven to be a 
most attractive improvement to the area by enhancing the flow of people through the area, providing a new bus shelter, better access to the Food Service Court in the HUB, as well as providing a very pleasant outdoor seat-ing area,” he said. “It does a good job of connecting the HUB to the street and the people in that area.”
The Hub’s new covered 
seating has replaced its old concrete tables.
John Shahin, a 19-year-old  
UF biochemistry sophomore, said the improvements were necessary.
“I remember how annoy-
ing it was eating with my friends on those old tables,” he said. “The umbrellas are wonderful. The additions made to the Hub were a much-needed improvement, easily worth the cost.”

UF Health scientists have dis-
covered that the source of throbbing 
pain in migraines comes from al-pha brain waves, not the heartbeat. These new findings could result in changes in how people receive therapy.
Neurologist Andrew Ahn and 
his colleagues have been working on the project for more than 10 years and used techniques involving pul-sation to find the true source of the pain.
“The more that I got into the basic 
signs underlying the migraine pro-cess, the more skeptical I got (about the source of pain),” Ahn said.
Ahn and his team used dozens 
of patients over the past year to test the relation between the pulsation patients felt in their heads and their actual heartbeat. Ahn found the two were drastically different.
The difference in the two rates 
led him to believe the throbbing pain had nothing to do 
with the heart but was actually fully in the brain.
The discov-
ery could impact changes in ther-apy.
Most of the 
treatment given to patients does not cure the source of the pain but sim-ply reduces the amount of pain the patient feels, Ahn said.
“People view opioids as being the final stand,” Ahn said. “The truth is that opioids really aren’t that effective, and for most people, there are really unpleasant side effects … it just doesn’t work. It doesn’t get people back to work.”
With different types of therapy, 
doctors can allocate resources in dif-ferent areas instead of continually using money to pay for treatments that are ineffective, Ahn said.
“We are taught to guide our 
treatments by the body systems af-fected,” said Sean Connolly, 23, a second-year UF medical student.
In many cases, drugs feed the 
pain addiction instead of the cause of the pain being addressed, Ahn said.
“The war on drugs is no longer 
about illegal drugs,” Ahn said. “It’s about prescription drugs.  That’s where people are getting their opi-oids now. It’s not from across the border.”
Ahn said changes could poten-
tially take up to 10 years before they are seen in the medical world.

Award-winning journal-
ist and HIV and AIDS activist 
Regan Hofmann will speak at the Reitz Union Grand Ballroom today.
The free event will be held at 
7 p.m. and is part of UF’s annual Common Reading Program. The UF bookstore will be selling Hof-mann’s memoir, and she will be signing autographs.
Alison Spannaus, the event’s 
organizer, said she reached out to Hofmann as a speaker be-cause of Hofmann’s personal history with HIV.
Hofmann said when she 
found out she was diagnosed with HIV in 1996, her doctor told her she only had one year to live. With little knowledge of HIV, she’d planned her funeral.
“I really thought of the end of 
my life,” she said. “At the time, it was a death sentence.”
Six years after her diagnosis, 
she said she realized living a normal life was possible.
Hofmann used journalism to 
raise awareness.
She said she put herself on 
the cover of the first publica-tion she worked on, announcing to everyone she was diagnosed with HIV.
She said her announcement 
shocked her relatives and col-leagues.
Hofmann said she became an 
HIV and AIDS activist because she believes what happened to her doesn’t have to happen to anyone else.
She said it is “criminal that 
we don’t do a better job at teach-ing young adults about the dis-ease.”HIV-positive writer speaks

Naked Juice may be leaving its 
customers feeling a little less bare 
after the conclusion of a class ac-tion legal settlement, and UF stu-dents may reap the benefits.
The company, a subsidiary of 
PepsiCo, advertises its products using phrases like “100% Fruit,” “All Natural” and “Non-GMO.”
Recently, plaintiffs in the law-
suit settled out of court with Pep-siCo about false labeling of the beverages, according to the web-site for the lawsuit. The suit al-leges that some of the ingredients used in several of the products are not as pure as advertised, includ-ing genetically modified soy.
But UF students like Otto 
Akin, a 21-year-old economics se-nior, were unmoved.“I understand it’s false adver-
tising, but it doesn’t bother me that they use genetically modified soy in their products,” he said. “I don’t necessarily equate safety with organic like some people do.”
As part of the settlement, Na-
ked customers can apply for up to $75 in reimbursement for qualify-ing products with proof of pur-chase. Without it, customers can still net up to $45.
But along with this consumer friendly format comes worries of fraud.
“It sounds a bit easily gamed,” 
said Akin. “You can just go on there, some random person, and get $45?”
Frank Torres, a 20-year-old 
business management junior, said he agrees that the easy money could be tempting to students.
“I’d take the money,” he said. 
“I’m fairly certain I’ve bought Na-ked Juice sometime in the last few years.”
The wide scope of the claim, 
for any individuals who pur-chased Naked Juice between Sept. 27, 2007, and Aug. 19, 2013, leaves plenty of room for guessing over whether or not an individual pur-chased the drink, said Torres.
But Akin, unlike many of his 
peers, said he probably won’t take advantage of the deal.
“I’d feel bad,” he said. “I’m 
interested in the story but not in making $45 from Pepsi.” Naked Juice bares consequences 
of lawsuit, compensates customersKATHRYN VARN

A Gainesville man was ar-
rested after attempting to gouge  
out a police officer’s eyes over a bottle of wine Tuesday. 
Gainesville Police arrested 
39-year-old Troy Delano Allen on charges of resisting an of-ficer, battery on a law enforce-ment officer and petit theft, ac-cording to an arrest report.
An employee said he saw 
Allen leave Food Max, located at 1304 E. University Ave., with a $6 bottle of Arbor Mist wine without paying for it, accord-ing to the report. An officer saw Allen walking in the 1300 block of Northeast First Avenue and told him to stop. Allen started running down the road and cutting through yards until the officer caught up with him in front of a house on N o r t h e a s t 
Third Av-enue.
W h i l e 
the officer was trying to handcuff him, Allen 
started punching and kick-ing the officer. He then tried to gouge the officer’s eyes out with his thumbs, leaving the of-ficer with a swollen eye, bruises and scratches, according to the report. The officer had to use a Taser to subdue Allen, wrote GPD Spokesman Officer Ben Tobias in an email.
Officers booked Allen into 
the Alachua County Jail on Wednesday at about 2 a.m., where he remained as of press time with a $90,000 bond. Thief tries to gouge

United States go to war with Syria? Today’s question: Have you ever had an extremely 
bad professor?Big Brother’s watching: NSA exploits data
We’re on the verge of a second civil war. 
However, this one won’t be fought in ﬁ  elds 
with guns — it will be fought behind screens 
with codes.
We’ve all heard about the National Security Agen-
cy’s blatant disregard for individual privacy after Ed-
ward Snowden leaked classiﬁ  ed documents in June. We didn’t know the full scope of the data theft until recent-ly, though more information has yet to be released.
One week ago today, The New York Times, the 
Guardian and ProPublica jointly published a story stat-ing that the NSA is able to crack Internet encryption, making virtually everything you do accessible to them. Secure email, virtual private networks and encrypted chat rooms — virtually anything protecting you from prying eyes — has been torn away. 
More disconcerting are the code names for these 
higher-than-top-secret operations: Bullrun and Manas-sas. Those are two names for the ﬁ  rst battle of the Civil War, where the public was declared an enemy of the state, according to the Guardian. Even rhetorically, we are all enemies of the NSA.
Usually with top secret operations, individuals in-
volved are briefed on a “need-to-know” basis, which means exactly what it sounds like. If you need to know something about the operation, you’re told. But accord-ing to a brieﬁ  ng document about Bullrun, there was no need-to-know basis. 
While I’ve spent my summer being outraged the 
government thinks it has any authority to infringe on my rights as a citizen, others have been enraged that our government’s secrets are being published for the world to see, buying into the rhetoric that this is necessary for our national security.
That is a false narrative. The NSA simply doesn’t want the public to know its 
strategy.The agency spends roughly 
$250 million a year of taxpayer dollars on the Sigint Enabling Project, according to its budget request on The New York Times website. This project seeks to work with U.S. tech companies to install “back doors” into soft-ware, essentially allowing the 
NSA to access data from supposedly secure programs like Skype, Outlook and Gmail.
This weakens national security. The back doors 
might be hidden, but they can be found and exploited by others. 
Even if the NSA says it has the people’s best interests 
at heart, it’s making those people vulnerable to hackers with malicious intent.
People write all of this off, thinking that if you have 
nothing to hide, you have no reason to be afraid. Howev-er, the Hawthorne effect is well documented and shows that people behave differently under observation. Phys-ics majors should know that even light behaves differ-ently under observation. By nature of observing people, they stop being who they are and act differently.
Now, what I said earlier about the Civil War sounds 
drastic, but it’s not. For now, we don’t have much to fear. What about when the government has a vested in-terest in what you’re saying behind closed doors? What if what you’re doing or saying contrasts what’s in its interest?
Well, then the NSA has every tool at its disposal to 
bring you down. 
Every encrypted email, every Facebook post and ev-
ery phone call can and will be used against you. 
Incriminating yourself will have never been easier.Justin Jones is a UF journalism senior. His column runs

We Can’t Stop: 
Why do we turn to pop 
culture in turmoil?
When I ﬁ  nd myself in times of trouble/Miley Cyrus 
comes to me/speaking words of wisdom:/”la-da-dee-da-dee, we like to party.”
On the serious, it seems as if only two things dominate the 
news cycle: Syria and Cyrus — OK, and maybe the iPhone 5c. We digress.
After the ﬂ  urry of Internet activity surrounding Cyrus’ 
beaten-to-death-by-the-moral-police VMAs performance, the New Yorker published an insightful reaction piece. Writer Sasha Weiss commented on the inﬂ  uence of Internet culture and social media, and reminded everyone that as long as there are innocent young pop ingénues, there will be drastic image transformations — see Madonna’s burning crosses and cone bras and Britney’s red bodysuit circa “Oops! I Did it Again.”
“Most of us are dimly aware of ships massing in the east-
ern Mediterranean to bomb Syria, and watching Cyrus gyrate on a page of news stories reminds us of how dim that aware-ness is, how easily we can be drawn away from seriousness into frivolity, and back again,” Weiss wrote in the article titled “Reacting to Miley.”
The back-and-forth of the frivolous and the serious contin-
ues this week with the release of Cyrus’ new music video for her song “Wrecking Ball,” which happened to coincide with President Obama’s speech about the Russian diplomatic plan his administration is preparing.
Both have received criticism in their respective ﬁ  elds: Po-
litical commenters said Obama’s cause is lost, and he’s failed to be consistent and clear in his statements about his intent to strike Syria with a calculated missile attack. The nation’s trust cache in Obama keeps diminishing, and his vague speech — no American boots on Syrian ground, no “pinprick strikes” — did little to put Americans at ease.
Another equally loud collective voice of criticism has been 
directed toward Miley Cyrus’ “Wrecking Ball” video. Just as her VMAs performance was “debated, criticized and dissect-ed to the point of obscurity,” as Weiss wrote, her music video was met with the same sort of pearl-clutching hysteria when people watched her swing nude atop a literal wrecking ball.
Another Internet explosion ensued — complete with par-
ody Vines and condescending faux concerned Fox News cov-erage. People reacted as if they’d never seen a naked human in a popular video before, even with Justin Timberlake and his cheap imitation, Robin Thicke, and their respective music videos featuring nude bodies.  
Although it was fun at ﬁ  rst, Mileygate is quickly becom-
ing tiresome. We get that pop culture is the candy shop and international upheaval is the Brussels sprout, but what’s hap-pening abroad deserves attention as well.
During a speech on Tuesday, Hillary Clinton said, “In a 
democracy, citizens cannot sit on the sidelines, that we have to ‘get into the arena,’ as Teddy Roosevelt called it, and par-ticipate.”
We have a feeling that Hils, unfortunately, wasn’t refer-
ring to rebellious 20-year-old pop stars.

Dispersed throughout 46 acres are 10 
cows, 11 horses, 25 chickens, two roost-
ers, five dogs, three donkeys and about 100 goats. It’s safe to say Charlie Meister has his hands full — usually with bottles and animal feed.
For the past three years, Meister, 72, 
has been posting ads in the classifieds sec-tion of The Alligator to spread the word about his goats and hopefully sell some.
“Students call me daily to ask about my 
goats,” Meister said. “They usually ask how much I’m selling them for and then say they will call me back but never do. I suppose they could think it’s a joke.”
Hidden behind hundreds of trees in 
Kanapaha Wildlife Sanctuary is Great-house Farm on Southwest 67th Street. 
Meister’s home sits on the property 
among pastures, horse stalls and the ani-mals roaming his land.
If you get past the honking Chinese 
geese and clucking chicken pecking at your feet, you’re golden. Just watch out for Paulie — sometimes, she nips at strangers.
Paulie, an 8-year-old white Great Pyr-
enees with matted fur, is the feistiest of the five guard dogs that protect the farm from any unwanted visitors — including the three coyotes that “caused a ruckus” last year and feasted on some of Meister’s defenseless goats.
“Goats are kind, loving animals that 
don’t have a mean bone in their body, which makes them easy targets for prey,” Meister said.
About 20 kids (baby goats) were born 
on the farm a couple of months ago. 
Talea, an 8-year-old goat who was 
born, bottle-fed and raised on the farm, just gave birth to two kids — one buck (male) and one doe (female) — but she only accepted the buck. 
In the wild, the newly born doe would 
not last a day without her mother’s help, Meister said, but he bottle-feeds her mul-tiple times a day.
“[Rejection] happens sometimes, and 
it’s good that way because I can use her milk to bottle-feed other kids”
Persuaded out of the pasture by a shak-
ing cup of food, Talea followed Meister to the milking room. She knows the routine, he said. She 
willingly jumped onto a metal platform and happily chowed down on feed as Meister began to milk her.
“The smaller of the two udders doesn’t 
need to be milked because her little guy is nursing on that teat,” Meister said.
Crouched down on one knee, his left 
hand squeezed the teat, and his right held an aluminum bowl with lukewarm milk from the first session earlier that day.
The milk squirts out in increments that 
match the power of his squeeze, hits the bottom of the bowl with the speed of a child’s squirt gun and slightly splatters on the sides.
Anjani Patel, a UF public relations se-
nior, said she chooses to drink goat’s milk before cow’s milk because it’s healthier and tastier.
“Goat’s milk is smoother and has a 
sweeter taste than cow’s milk,” Patel said.
A 3-year-old buck that goes by the 
name Number 19 is the hot commodity and the reason for almost all of the kids at Greathouse Farm. 
Don’t underestimate the fact that he’s 
young because he breeds with all the does, Meister said.
“He knows his way around the ladies,” 
Meister said. “He gets the job done.”
Meister said his goal is to transition his 
farm to solely raise goats, but he knows that is a huge transition that will take many years.
Number 19 and other goats still for sale

The open mic stood center stage like 
a blinking cursor on a blank Word doc-
ument, expectantly waiting for some-one to approach it. Natalie Nix, 26, a UF English alumna and emcee for The Conch, was the first to take on the mic.
Nix greeted everyone and intro-
duced the parameters of the event: Tell a five-minute true story without us-ing any notes relating to this month’s theme, “Tell your favorite story.”
In Gainesville, from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. 
on the second Tuesday of every month, talkers of all types are encouraged to come out to Lightnin’ Salvage, the open-air bar attached to Satchel’s Piz-za, to share their stories. The nights are put on by Grow Radio, Gainesville’s community Internet radio station. The events are recorded, and select stories are uploaded as podcasts on the ra-dio’s website, www.growradio.org.
Bill Bryson, founder of Grow Radio, 
was inspired to start the true storytell-ing project he named “The Conch” in Gainesville after visiting Atlanta and seeing its popularity there. 
“I was just hopeful that this would 
capture an audience and an interest in local storytellers,” he said.
And a year since he organized the 
first Conch event, he believes it has.
Tuesday evening, The Conch’s one-
year anniversary, the locals showed and, with alcoholic beverages and pizza slices in hand, settled into the booths facing the bar’s short platform stage.
Speakers are not allowed to use 
notes: “The idea is to tell a story from the heart and not get so caught up in your head,” Nix said.
Some people prepare their stories, 
but many choose to get up spontane-ously, Bryson said.
“There seems to be a direct corre-
lation to how much alcohol has been served,” he said and laughed.
Tuesday night, the crowd was hesi-
tant, so Satchel’s bartenders were the first two speakers to break the invis-ible barrier between the tables and the stage.  
Soon, a fairly steady stream of peo-
ple came up with only slight persua-sion from Nix.

High-powered entrepreneur and former 
UF graduate Paxton Atwood faces a night-
marish partnership with his older sister in the ﬁ  ctitious world of “The Curse of the Old-er Sister.”
Written by entrepreneur and UF alumnus 
Patrick Arenson, ﬁ  ction and reality meet in a tale rooted in Arenson’s own life.
The 23-year-old graduated from UF with 
a master’s degree in entrepreneurship in May and is now hoping to gain the funding to make the story of a very similar entrepre-neur a published reality. 
His Kickstarter launched Tuesday to raise 
the $3,250 necessary for publication.
But Arenson isn’t new to publication.At 14, he began his ﬁ  rst novel, “The Little 
Boy Story,” which was completed by the time he graduated high school and published in 2008. In college, prompted by his love for food, he wrote a cookbook, “Cooking for Col-lege Students: A Beginner’s Guide,” which was published in 2010.
By January 2012, the lifelong reader and 
fan of writing was on the way to beginning his third book.
This time, he took pointers from his sur-
roundings.
His older sister by 15 months, Ashley, 
makes her literary debut as the inspiration for Paxton’s older sister of the same name and age difference.  Arenson said he was inspired to write the 
book after friends who saw him and his sister interact told him he should write about their relationship.
“I would say we have an entertaining re-lationship,” he said.
His friends, too, would become the inspi-
rations behind the book’s characters.
“It was an all-consuming thing,” he said. 
“I couldn’t be around people. You create these ﬁ  ctitious arguments that last so long in your mind, and you’re constantly devel-oping them and changing them to see where they go. So, you’re constantly angry all the time.”
The world of the novel intertwined with 
real life to the extent that he couldn’t separate his ﬁ  ctitious sister from his real one.
Jessica Wu, a UF alumna, is the only one 
of Arenson’s friends who has read the book in its entirety and is a mutual friend of both Arenson siblings. She said she felt the same confusion.
“It was just funny because I remember 
talking to both of them, and I was angry, and then I was like, ‘Wait, that wasn’t even real. That’s in the book,’” said Wu, 22.
Wu said the story surpassed her expec-
tations, making deeper connections with themes of self-growth and reﬂ  ection.
“I think the story from the book does a 
good job of realizing you should take a look at both perspectives,” Wu said.  
Ashley Arenson said she isn’t allowed to 
see the book until the ﬁ  nal product, but she admires her brother for completing the feat, true to his determined character.
“You have to be really brave to do that 
and follow through with it,” she said.
Writing a fake character that was so close-
ly related to him made writing the book an emotional experience, Patrick Arenson said.
“You force yourself to deal with topics and 
acknowledge things you normally wouldn’t,” he said. “It forces you to re-prioritize.”UF alumnus searches for funding to publish third novelliterature

trip in an Oldsmobile with an 
expired registration and insur-ance, how she was stopped by police and let off, only to hit a deer and have a cop pull over.
The stories were a mixture 
of hilarious rants, confused but compelling meanderings and captivating dramas. The sto-rytellers stood on stage with The Conch’s very own conch shell and had their moment to tell everyone to shut up and listen. And unlike Piggy who held the conch in “Lord of the Flies,” the participants were not beaten to death if the audi-ence disliked what they had to say. Rather, the audience was friendly.
Woody Blue said she thinks 
it takes a lot of courage to share a part of yourself with strangers and to be vulner-able. It seems everyone listen-ing Tuesday night recognized that.
We all know them. There 
are the people who can spin a five-second moment of a piz-za falling to the ground into a gripping 10-minute story. They could be narrators on those murder mystery shows that build the suspense for an hour until dramatically reveal-ing the perpetrator.  
We also know the people 
who can drone on about noth-ing with no punch line in sight.  Not unlike info marketers, they keep adding pointless details to try to spice up a dull prod-uct, but in the end, it’s still just a rag to clean things with.
But despite the quality of 
storytelling, the audience still clapped and cheered. It was like in karaoke when the singer doesn’t know the lyrics, is tone deaf or chooses Celine Dion, and the audience chimes in to support him or her.
The emphasis on commu-
nity was evident and is repre-sentative of the go-local move-ment that Satchel’s, Grow Radio and the arts embody. Even the decorations were cre-ated from mostly local contri-butions, from the chandeliers made up of keys to the posts adorned with beer cans.
So if you are interested in 
backing a community radio station, a local restaurant and a dying art form, the tradition of The Conch will continue Oct. 8 with the  prompt “You wanna hear something really scary.” 
Participants are encouraged 
to dress in costume for the oc-casion. 
There will also be dramatic 
under lighting to enhance the spooky effect.  ANGELA SKANE

Lines were blurred between 
hearing and listening in one of 
this summer’s biggest hits. If it weren’t for the topless women prancing around Robin Thicke, T.I. and Pharrell in the music video for “Blurred Lines,” no one would have heard what Thicke was “trying to say.”
The hit’s music video caught 
heat from feminist groups for its portrayal of women.
The unrated version of 
the video, found on Thicke’s VEVO account, features topless models being grabbed at. The single generated attention from critics who claimed the lyrics were “rape-y.” But people have overlooked the lyrics and en-joyed the tune.
“I think that it’s a catchy and 
upbeat song, so it gets you in a happier mood,” said Stepha-nie Sheridan, a 19-year-old UF biomedical engineering sopho-more.
UF psychology professor 
Laurie Mintz doesn’t think the song caught a lot of people’s at-tention because it isn’t that out of the norm for us.
“Objectification of women is 
so ingrained in our culture, in advertisements, in music vid-eos, that we see this as normal,” she said. “It doesn’t even faze us.”But Auckland University 
students Adelaide Dunn, Ol-ivia Lubbock and Zoe Ellwood were outraged after reading the song’s lyrics. The 22-year-old women decided to paro-dy Thicke’s music video for “Blurred Lines” as part of a re-vue show.
They worked together to 
come up with a feminist ver-sion of “Blurred Lines,” titled “Defined Lines.” Their video flips the gender roles and shows shirtless men clad in tight un-derwear dancing around Dunn, Lubbock and Ellwood.
“Defined Lines” was taken 
down from YouTube shortly after being posted.
“People who tried to watch 
it were messaging us, telling us the video was gone,” Lubbock said. “I thought it was unfair ... I think it had a lot to do with the fact that we had a lot of re-ally negative comments on the YouTube.”
Dunn thinks it was flagged 
as inappropriate because of the “gender flipping.”“It’s a strange thing to see 
men, like, in a situation that women are in often in music videos,” Dunn said.
After appealing YouTube’s 
decision, the women got the video back onto YouTube.
“I think that it shows you 
what YouTube is about,” said 19-year-old Karen Lara, a UF accounting sophomore. “You can have the same concept, one with men and women, and the one with women gets taken down. It favors women being shown as sex objects, not men.”
Ellwood thinks people are 
taking their song too seriously.
“We don’t literally mean all 
of the stuff that we were say-ing,” she said. “We don’t want to castrate men.”
The girls didn’t think they 
were being “too radical” when they made the video, Lubbock said.
“Maybe that has to do with 
our upbringing and the fact that New Zealand is a really liberal country,” she said.
Despite the negative feed-
back, they have received posi-tive responses to their video.
“We’ve had a few messages 
from men … saying that they saw the video, and it made them really uncomfortable,” Ellwood said, “and they realized that if this was how women felt in everyday life, then they felt that they wanted to change things.”
Women fight song’s messageinternational
� THE VIRTUAL PET FROM SPACE HAS 
BEEN REVIVED JUST IN TIME FOR ITS 16TH BIRTHDAY.
VALERIA YULEE
Avenue Writer
Although the virtual pets quickly went out 
of style in the ‘90s, Bandai Co. Ltd., the Japa-
nese company that created the Tamagotchi brand, has been making efforts to bring them back to life this year.
Bandai Co. Ltd. and its North American 
marketing representative, Sync Beatz Enter-tainment,  announced last week they signed a deal with Los Angeles-based clothing com-pany Mighty Fine, giving them licensing rights to Tamagotchi L.i.f.e.’s first line of clothing and lifestyle products, according to Women’s Wear Daily.
Lifestyle products will include home décor 
as well as accessories. The clothing line will in-clude activewear, T-shirts, bodysuits, dresses, fleece, pants, shorts and skirts for women and juniors. 
Even though she was fond of the toy, Sanela 
Music, a 21-year old UF business junior, said, “I don’t think I’d want a pillow or blanket with my Tamagotchi animal on it.”
Dennis DiPasquale, a UF Ph.D. student in 
advertising and instructor of Principles of Ad-vertising, said the respective companies might be reviving Tamagotchi because it plays a nos-talgic role in the market.
He said another reason for the brand’s 
comeback might be a chance at a fresh market.
“The idea of the Tamagotchi is new to its 
original demographic,” he said.  “(For) the other audiences who have never heard of it … it’s not passé for them because it was never popular for them. So, it’s an opportunity for it to become popular again.”
J. C. Penney Professor of Marketing Rich-
ard Lutz also believes nostalgia plays a role in Tamagotchi’s return.
Younger kids aren’t usually making their 
own purchase decisions, Lutz said. People who played with Tamagotchis in the ‘90s are now in their 20s and may buy into the new line for younger generations. Items like this tend to be fad-driven, he said.
Alexandra Valverde said she probably 
wouldn’t buy into the new Tamagotchi line be-cause it’s not her style.
“I may buy something like that for my niece, 
though,” the 21-year-old UF microbiology and cell science junior said.   
DiPasquale doesn’t think Tamagotchis are a 
fad that’s come back to stay for good.
“Something to remember is that Tamag-
otchi didn’t stay popular for that long, so I don’t think that this will stay popular for that long,” DiPasquale said.  “I think it’s going to be in and out. (It’s) probably a seasonal fad — for maybe one year.”
Andrea Bonvecchio said she wouldn’t buy 
into Tamagotchi L.i.f.e.
“I’m all about owning memorabilia of things 
you’re a fan of as a kid, but Tamagotchi was just a short-lived phase that lasted as long as my little Tamagotchis,” she said.Tamagotchi makes a comebackt

Dear Mediocre Advice,
As my college career nears 
its close, I find myself wonder-
ing if guys’ ultimate conquest is simply a fantasy, or if I still have a fighting chance. What are your thoughts on three-somes and how to make it hap-pen? Ever participated in one? 
Am I missing out?Dear Mediocre Advice,
I’m really bad about going 
to the gym. I need motivation. 
Help me and my fat ass.
Dear Friend,
Threesomes don’t expire after 
college, so, you still have a fight-
ing chance. I have never partici-pated in one, and I would hate to because I don’t want to take care of more than one person in bed, excluding myself. “You get what you get, and you don’t get upset” is my motto in bed. You need to consider this: how good you re-ally are with pleasing women and then double that expectation. I’m going to assume you want the two-girl combo threesome package. That’s two vaginas you need to prep and impress. If you cannot execute this, the girls in your bed will get bored of mak-ing out in order to make you turn from Play-Doh to rock hard. If you want the two-guys-one-girl combo package, well, that’s just too many pegs and not enough holes. I have no idea if you really are missing out on this cliché col-lege man-quest, but chances are 
I didn’t change your mind.Dear Friend,
Get off your butt, and go to the 
gym. Think about it like this: You can undo a cookie or doughnut by running. That’s easy to fix, and I get to say that because I ate a doughnut five minutes ago. They are less difficult to get rid of than a bubble butt. For example, you can’t undo farting in front of your boss, a deviated septum or a fraternity tattoo. Sure, there’s laser tattoo removal, but does the embarrassment ever come off?Next event 
is Oct. 8

women is so ingrained 
in our culture, in ad-

Jeff Driskel rushes during Florida’s 21-16 loss to Miami on Saturday in Sun Life Stadium. Driskel suffered a knee sprain in the game but is expected to face Tennessee on Sept. 21.
PHIL HEILMAN
Alligator Staff Writer                           @phillip_heilman
A bye week has come at the perfect 
time for the Gators.
Following a 21-16 loss to Miami on Sat-
urday in Sun Life Stadium, No. 18 Florida 
has several important players on the mend. With a week off, coach Will Muschamp ex-pects most of them to be healthy enough to return against Tennessee on Sept. 21. 
Quarterback Jeff Driskel is on crutch-
es after suffering a sprained knee while scrambling against the Hurricanes. Driskel did not miss a snap in the game despite sustaining the injury in the first half. 
“He will be fine for Tennessee,” Mus-
champ said on the weekly Southeastern Conference Coaches Media Teleconfer-ence on Wednesday. “We’re just precau-tionary, just trying to get him off his knee a little bit; we’ve got a long season ahead of us.”
Safety Marcus Maye (shoulder), corner-
back Marcus Roberson (knee), left tackle D.J. Humphries (knee) and Buck line-backer Dante Fowler (hip) are all expected to be ready to go against the Volunteers, Muschamp said.  
Right tackle Tyler Moore, who was 
called for three penalties against Miami, suffered an ankle injury while filling in for Humphries along the left side of the line. If the Gators had a game this week, Moore would not be ready to play, Muschamp said. 
Muschamp added that Moore “prob-
ably should be fine” to play against Ten-nessee. 
The news is not as promising for fresh-
man defensive back Nick Washington, who suffered a shoulder injury during practice Monday that will require season-ending surgery.
Washington re-aggravated a shoul-
der problem he developed during high school. “[He was] just reaching in for a ball,” 
Muschamp said. “It was a non-contact in-jury, knocking a ball off a guy in a skel-eton period. Unfortunate. He was really progressing well at defensive back for us and on special teams. He was doing a good job.”
As expected, Muschamp said right 
guard Jon Halapio is nearing a return from injury. 
Halapio, a second-team All-SEC selec-
tion, missed Florida’s first two games after suffering a partially torn pectoral muscle during the offseason. Prior to the injury, the redshirt senior had made 27 consecu-tive starts for UF.
With nine days to go until the Gators 
face the Volunteers, Halapio appears to be on schedule to return for the game. 
Despite the long list of injuries, Mus-
champ said he would have liked to play this weekend because of the sour taste left in his mouth after Florida’s show-ing against Miami. The Gators racked up more than 400 yards of total offense, but five turnovers and multiple failures in the red zone sunk UF. 
The loss dropped Florida from No. 12 
to No. 18 in the Associated Press Poll. Mi-ami, unranked entering the game, vaulted to No. 15. 
“Anytime you lose, regardless of who 
you’re playing next, you want to get back on the field,” Muschamp said. 
“I wish we could line up and play this 
weekend. Unfortunately, that’s the way our schedule falls. We created this issue, so now we need to circle the wagons here.”Driskel expected to face Vols

LANDON WATNICK
Alligator Staff Writer        @LandonWatnick
After maintaining his ver-
bal commitment to the Gators 
for about seven months, Class of 2014 offense tackle Benjamin Knox opened up his options Tuesday night. 
Knox’s reason for decommit-
ting from Florida: He has not heard from the UF coaching staff since July.
“I read that they were backing 
off,” Knox said. “About a week after that, they hadn’t been talk-ing to me.”
Knox, who stands at 6 feet, 6 
inches and weighs 259 pounds, said his family, friends or De-Land High coaching staff did not influence his decision.
A three-star prospect, accord-
ing to Rivals.com, Knox original-ly committed to Florida on Feb. 16 during the team’s first Junior Day of 2013. 
“When I went there, I felt like I 
belonged,” Knox said of first vis-iting UF.“At the same time, that was 
the first time I ever visited col-lege.”
W i t h 
F l o r i d a now out, Louisville 
and USF are Knox’s two leaders. He has also received offers from Utah, Marshall and Middle Ten-nessee State.
“I talk to Louisville on a regu-
lar-day basis,” Knox said.
“They check up on me. It’s like 
back to back, back to back.“South Florida, the same. I 
checked South Florida out. It’s a good school, a good educational school, too. …
“I think more schools are go-
ing to come. I’m just going to wait it out.”
     Although he primarily plays 
at offensive tackle, Knox has also 
lined up at defensive end for De-Land.
“At UF, if I didn’t work at 
offensive tackle, I would have played at defensive end,” Knox said.“I’m comfortable at both. I’m 
just more comfortable at tackle.”
Including Knox, five former 
verbal commits have decommit-
ted from the Gators since Febru-ary.
Florida’s 2014 class now in-
cludes only 14 commitments, seven of whom rank among Ri-vals.com’s top 250 prospects. 
Nine of UF’s verbal commits 
are prospects sporting four-star rankings. 
The other five are three-star 
Three-star offensive line prospect decommits from Gators“[Driskel] will be fine 
for Tennessee. We’re just 
precautionary, just trying to get

got a long season ahead of us.”

If coach Will Muschamp had 
his way, Rod Johnson would not 
see the ﬁ  eld this year.
“That’s the plan,” Muschamp 
said on the Southeastern Confer-ence Coaches Media Teleconfer-ence on Wednesday.
The Gators coaching staff wants 
to redshirt the freshman offensive lineman, but with the No. 18 Gators (1-1) suffering numerous injuries on the offensive line, Muschamp may need to play the Delray Beach native this year.
The 6-foot-5, 316-pound of-
fensive lineman came to Florida with a pre-existing meniscus in-jury from high school and missed preseason camp. Muschamp said  Wednesday that Johnson would begin contact drills Monday.
“He’s missed through August 
camp and now we’re two weeks into the season,” Muschamp said. “He’d be hard-pressed (to play now).”
Johnson came to Florida as a 
three-star recruit out of Delray Beach American Heritage High as one of ﬁ  ve offensive linemen in a 29-player class. The only new lineman to see game action so far is JUCO transfer Trenton Brown, who has two years of experience at Georgia Military College under his belt.
“Right now, [Johnson] would be 
a redshirt guy,” Muschamp said. 
But injuries might force John-son into action.
Before the season began, red-
shirt senior Jon Halapio suffered a partially torn pectoral muscle, and junior Chaz Green suffered a torn labrum. Halapio is scheduled to return to the ﬁ  eld when Florida plays Tennessee (2-0) on Sept. 21, but Green is out for the season.
The injury bug did not stop bit-
ing once the season began – sopho-more D.J. Humphries (knee) and junior Tyler Moore (ankle) have both suffered injuries since the sea-son began.
Despite the injuries, Muschamp 
said he is conﬁ  dent in the team’s depth right now.
“We have enough depth where 
we are on the offensive line,” he said, “even though we had to re-shufﬂ  e things obviously last Satur-day.”
The Gators have a week off 
before they face the Volunteers, which should provide time for the team to get back into playing con-dition.
 “You’d like to go play tomor-
row,” Muschamp said after Florida lost to No. 15 Miami on Saturday. 
“But we certainly need a little 
time to get these guys back and hopefully get Jon Halapio back — seems like we will for Tennessee — and get some guys healthy as we move into the SEC.”16, ALLIGATOR  THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 2013

Florida recruiting linemen 
from California, Missouri
recruits. Florida’s 2014 class is currently 
ranked No. 17 by Rivals.com.
With Knox out of the mix, Florida has 
only three 2014 offensive line commits — 
four-star offensive tackle Nolan Kelleher and three-star guards Dontae Angus and Travaris Dorsey.
Among the offensive linemen current-
ly considering Florida are four-star guard Damien Mama (Bellﬂ  ower, Calif.) and four-star tackle Roderick Johnson (Floris-sant, Mo.).
Also on the Gators’ radar is David 
Sharpe.
The 6-foot-8, 275-pound offensive 
tackle attends Providence School of Jack-sonville.
Sharpe is listed as a three-star offen-
sive tackle on Rivals.com but as the No. 15 overall player in ESPN’s Class of 2014 rankings. RECRUIT , from page 15Four-star commits (according to Rivals.com)
