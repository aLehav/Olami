0 MORE THAN 800 UF STUDENTS
WILL PARTICIPATE IN REVAMP.
By JAMEL LANGLEY
Alligator Contributing Writer
A local elementary school will get a face-
lift this weekend.
As a part of Project Makeover more than
800 UF students will paint murals and re-
vamp the baseball field at Lake Forest El-
ementary.
Project Makeover is , an annual event in
which UF students renovate local elementary
schools.
The event begins Friday with shifts start-"The biggest way we can make a
difference is by providing a learning
environment where learning be-
comes fun."

On Saturday, shifts last from 9 a.m to 9
p.m., and on Sunday they will go from 9 a.m
to 6 p.m.
UF alumnus Josh Jackson came up with
the idea for Project Makeover in 2007 when

whole lot more successful this
year than last year," said Shel-
don Clark, marketing director
for the event. "And last year
was pretty successful."
Last year, 2,500 people
raised $2,000 and
On hurled 65,000Campus water balloons at
each other.
Students raise money for the
event by tabling, selling carna-
tions for Valentine's Day and
encouraging people to bring
donations to the balloon fight."Being a female in general,
and maybe having to deal with
breast cancer firsthand one
day, makes me relate well to
the cause," said Natalie Hy-
man, the event director.
Proceeds raised from the
event will be donated to the
North Florida chapter of the
American Cancer Society.
The balloons are stored at
the Keys Residential Complex.
Volunteers will be there
today filling balloons for the
fight.
LOCAL POLITICS
Mayoral candidates mingle
By ANDREA RUMBAUGH
Alligator Contributing Writer
There is more to Gainesville politics than Stu-
dent Government elections.
In anticipation of the March 16 city election,
about eight people attended a Craig Lowe for
Mayor student interest meeting at 8 p.m. Thurs-
day.
Garrett Gamier, Lowe's campaign manager,
began the meeting by emphasizing students'
ability to turn around an election.
Garner said in March 2009, about 3,000 peo-
ple between the ages of 18 and 25 voted against
Charter Amendment 1, which would have re-
pealed Gainesville's discrimination protectionlaws based on sexual orientation and gender
identity.
The amendment did not pass.
Garner said voting is not
the only way students can
contribute to Lowe's cam-
paign.
They can also volunteer to
make phone calls, go door to
door and table on campus.
"We need students be-Lowe cause students can complete-
ly change the dynamic of this election," Garner
said.
It is important that students vote in local elec-

Police arrest woman for attacking child's father with screwdriver
A Gainesville woman was arrested Thurs-
day for attacking her 2-year-old child's father
with a screwdriver.
Jaime Pelletier, 30, got into an argument
with him over a Facebook message left on his
phone, according to a Gainesville Police De-
partment report.
As the pair fought, Pelletier became physi-
cally violent and picked up a small screw-
driver. She cut his arms and chest with the tool,
according to the report.After being pushed away, Pelletier put
down the screwdriver and grabbed a pair of
scissors, again cutting his chest and arms. By
the time police arrived, the man also had vis-
ible scratches on his back and nose, although
none of the wounds were life-threatening.
After being read her rights, Pelletier said
she had no idea how her partner got his injuries
and that she didn't remember what happened
in the apartment, according to the report.

Candidates for Gainesville
mayor and District 4 City Com-
mission focused on the issues
Thursday night in an effort to at-
tract local voters for the upcom-
ing election.
Speaking in front of about 80
people at the Gainesville Wom-
an's Club, the candidates were
placed onto panels, where they
were grilled on fiscal, social and
environmental issues.
"On March 16, our neighbor-
hood's at stake," said mayoral
candidate Craig Lowe, alluding
to the upcoming election. "There
will be no time for on-the-job
training. We need someone with
proven leadership."
The candidates for the Dis-
trict 4 commission, Francis "Pat"
Fitzpatrick, Nathaniel Sperling,
Mason Alley, Randy Wells and
Penny Wheat, were the first to
address the crowd.
The candidates spoke for
about 45 minutes, and they spent
most of their time emphasizing
the need to maintain fiscal re-
sponsibility during rough eco-
nomic times.
"This is the biggest thing we
face," Alley said. "We do have
a budget shortfall. We need tothe thing that brings us together
is jobs and job creation."
Fitzpatrick, a homeless aware-
ness advocate, deferred on most
of the questions, instead choosing
to speak on attaining more rights
for the homeless, especially on
the subject of potentially lifting
the 130 meal limit at St. Francis
House.America, where they tell you that
you can't give a sandwich to a
child, and we show up in masses
and do it anyway."
But there was another press-
ing issue at the heart of Thurs-
day's forum.
The mayoral candidates,
Lowe, Don Marsh, Ozzy Angu-
lo, Monica Leadon Cooper andpers Inc. industrial site, which
is an environmental concern for
Gainesville residents.
"This is the one issue in
Gainesville that everyone is on
the same page," Cooper said.
"The whole town wants this
cleaned up."

missioner to address the con-

cerns.
"Koppers came to me and
asked how they could be better
neighbors," Lowe recalled. "I
told them that the best thing you
can do is to leave."
Selwach, the owner of Best
Jewelry and Loan Pawnbrokers,
said that more drastic action,
such as placing heavy fines, is
necessary in addressing the en-
vironmental issue of the Koppers
site.
Although his fellow oppo-
nents used all their alloted time,
Selwach kept his answers short
and crisp.
"My three main priorities are
balancing the budget, balancing
the budget and balancing the
budget," he said.
But for the candidates, the
election is not just about the is-
sues.
It's about reaching out to the
community.
"I talk to smart people all the
time," Marsh said. "I think to my-
self, 'Why aren't we listening to
these people?' I want to partner
with you as mayor."
Although all the candidates
had differences in their politi-
cal philosophies, they all shared
a sentiment of encouraging
Gainesville citizens to make the
effort to vote.
"Elected officials need to be
held accountable," Angulo said.
"And the only way we can do that
is to have citizens involved."

Students learn money management at workshop
0 ABOUT 50 STUDENTS ATTENDED.
By PAIGE LACY
Alligator Writer
By the time students graduate, they owe
about $2,500 in credit card debt and about
$10,000 in school loans, according to Michael
Gutter, a UF assistant professor.Gutter, who works in UF's family, youth
and community sciences department, was
just one of the finance specialists who of-
fered advice to a crowd of about 50 at the
Florida Gym Thursday night during Savings
in the Swamp, a money management work-
shop for students.
"People who are heavily in debt are less
productive," Gutter said. "Knowing how to
use a credit card is the first step."Kristin Jackson, student coordinator of
Savings in the Swamp, said many college
students do not know enough about manag-
ing their money to make educated financial
decisions.
On "We wanted to go beyondCampus the classroom to help educate
anyone about creating good fi-
nancial habits," Jackson said.
Representatives from local Gainesvillefinancial companies encouraged students
not to buy things on impulse and develop a
spending plan.
UF freshman Dean Tzobanakis said that
before college he wasn't responsible for
managing his money.
"Coming to college and having to start
paying for things on my own definitely
makes me live on a tight budget," Tzobana-
kis said.

Editorial
Forgive us if we slur a little. We're still nursing our Student
Government hangovers and are a little disoriented. But we
don't have that much to complain about -unlike our SG re-
porter, who is still in her exhaustion-induced coma.
So, while we take a few Tylenols, pour another cup of coffee
and put on our sunglasses, we're going to slowly present you
with this week's Turlington-Plaza-kind-of-looks-eerie-now-
that-all-those-pesky-SG-people-have-finally-vacated-it edition
of.
Darts & Laurels
But we find comfort in the fact that some of those said miss-
ing persons will be turning up in the Student Senate Tuesday
-especially the 20 new senators elected from the Student Al-
liance party.
It's good to see there will finally be some democracy in the
Senate. That's why we're going to write a resolution, pass it
unanimously and hand over a we're-excited-to-see-the-faces-
of-Unite-Party-members-turn-red-while-you-all-make-mo-
tions-against-everything-they-say LAUREL to the little indie
party that could.
Give 'em hell.
One last SG-related thing, and then we promise we'll stop.
The Department of Darts & Laurels would like to hand out a
we-don't-care-if-it-was-our-editorial-their-fliers-or-the-fact-
you-wanted-a-sticker-to-use-as-immunity-we're-just-happy-
you-voted LAUREL to each of the 9,775 students who went out
to the polls Tuesday and Wednesday. It wasn't an all time high,
but it wasn't an all time low either, and we're OK with that.
Something we're not OK with though, and something we're
a little confused about, is why SeaWorld Orlando has chosen to
keep Tilikum, the whale that killed its trainer yesterday in front
of horrified fans.
Extensive research has been done about reintroducing cap-
live animals to the wild, and even whales like Tilikum, who was
bred in captivity, have had success being released. But SeaWorld
has decided against releasing the animal, who has proven three
times so far that his environment isn't working for him.
Therefore, the Editorial Board is shooting an underwater
torpedo how-many-bodies-will-it-take-before-you-stop DART
at SeaWorld.
On the other end of the subject of freedom, we're having
mixed feelings about a California state assembly resolution that
established the first week of March as a statewide "Cuss-Free
Week."
As newspaper employees, free speech is near and dear to
us, and if you want to use some creative profanity, we're all
for it. But we're not sure encouraging Californians to clean up
their mouths is the worst idea. According to the resolution's au-
thors, there is a connection between foul language, drugs and
bullying. So we're half-throwing, half-handing a LAURT at the
California Legislature -because we know we have an opinion;
we're just not sure what it is yet.
California isn't the only one voting on important decisions.
Some University of Mississippi students banned together in
hopes of finding the school a new mascot to replace it's more
outdated one, Colonel Reb.
And what's the top competitor you ask? Why, it's Admiral
Ackbar, the leader of the Rebel Alliance, from "Star Wars." And
with more than 15,000 Facebook fans and a Twitter account, it
looks like, come Tuesday when students vote, this bizarre char-
achter could be it.
That's why we're going to toss a be-careful-it-might-be-a-
trap LAUREL to the Ole Miss Rebel Alliance.
That's it for this week. And remember -there's only one
more week until Spring Break.

Politicians shouldn't favor extremism
s many of you may know, the Conservative Po-litical Action Conference occurred in Washington,
D.C., this past weekend. A variety of conservative-
leaning Americans attended the conference, such as anti-
homosexual rights advocates and anti-liberal media activ-
ists, setting up booths to promote a plethora of causes.
Among these groups, which are to be expected at a con-
servative conference, some had questionable motives. There
was a group that advocated Americans moving to New
Hampshire to start the second Revolutionary War. Another
called attention to the tyranny of liberalism by selling a book
titled "The Tyranny of Liberalism," along with "A Consum-
er's Guide to the Apocalypse."
The Oath Keepers, a group of law enforcement officers,
were represented at the conference, promoting their ideals
of disobeying laws they don't agree with. They were only
founded in April 2009, interestingly only months after Ba-
rack Obama was inaugurated as our president.
Finally, Let Freedom Ring published "Grandma's Not
Shovel-Ready: Signs from 9/12 and the Tea Parties of 2009."
The publication highlighted and promoted different signs
that were proudly held high at the tea parties, which includ-
ed countless references to socialism, Marxism, communism,
czars, fascism, comrades and, my personal favorite, the sign
that read "We came unarmed. this time."
If this was merely a conference for people with certain po-
litical affiliations, it would be harmless. But the problem is
that is not what the CPAC is, it's a pre-primary opportunity
for Republicans to feel out their constituency for a possible
presidential push in a few years. The problem with having
these kinds of groups represented at the conference is they
become affiliated with the Republican Party. And by speak-
ing at the conference, Republicans such as Tim Pawlenty and
Mitt Romney are supporting their ideas. By pandering to
some of the most extreme examples of conservatives, these
potential presidential nominees are allying themselves withwhat extreme conservatives believe.
.- I can't imagine possible presi-
dential nominees attending a liberal
counterpart to the CPAC. Just look-
ing at what the conservative media
has done to Democrats with ties to
Paul Murty liberal groups proves my thoughts.
letters@alligator org Glenn Beck began a campaign against
Van Jones, one of the many "czars"
appointed by President Obama, be-
cause of ties to left-wing causes in his past. Jones was forced
to resign from working in the administration because of the
campaign, yet conservative extremists are pandered to by
important political figures.
Democrats should be pointing this out to the American
people. The only reason I found out about all of this was
because Rachel Maddow's show came on after Olympic
hockey on MSNBC. She had a story on how the conservative
movement, as represented by the CPAC, continues to move
away from pro-active politics and toward anti-Democratic
and, more specifically, anti-Obama politics. I feel bad for the
normal conservatives I know because they are being ignored
in favor of more extreme groups.
Regardless of their motives, the Republican speakers
should be criticized for partaking in the conference. Centrist
Republicans should be offended that their possible future
presidential nominees are already moving to the right. Per-
haps if the Republicans had stayed more toward the center
in the 2008 presidential election, they could be in the White
House right now. I guess getting Sarah Palin's name out
there was too important to ignore. But by being isolated to
the far right, they are already hurting themselves. And Dem-
ocrats must call attention to the -let's face it -crazy groups
represented at the CPAC and the seeming endorsements by
the Republican speakers.

a historic 20 seats in the Student
Senate. Over the course of the cam-
paign, the Student Alliance candi-
dates and supporters demonstrat-
ed incredible character, integrity
and devotion.
To everyone who helped out -
whether they campaigned for days
or just took a few minutes to vote
-I want to sincerely thank you.
That outpouring of support al-
lows 20 new voices from UF's col-
leges of liberal arts and sciences,
engineering, architecture, fine arts
and nursing, as well UF's gradu-
ate community, to represent tens
of thousands of Gators and their
needs and concerns.
Equally important, the defeat
of the proposed Reitz Union fee
sends a powerful message. Despite
a massive, publicly funded cam-
paign to push a new fee on the Stu-
dent Body over the next 30 years,
a decisive majority came out and
said it wanted fiscal responsibility
from its Student Government.
When I first got elected 3.5 years
ago, I was the only Senate oppo-
sition member. Now, we are 23
elected representatives strong and
a strong voice for accountability.That's something all UF students
can be proud of.

U U U
Reader urges others to avoid
trolling
Over the past several weeks and
the next few weeks, students have
and will continue to be trolled
hard. For those unaware of what
trolling is (we've all been trolled),
trolling is when someone pur-
posely antagonizes others by post-
ing inflammatory content, thereby
causing others to rage. It's like the
Hatfield-McCoy feud. One party
makes a claim; the other counters.
It never ends. This back-and-forth
also reminds me of a "Girls Gone
Wild" tug-of-war: Everyone pulls
for his or her own side, but in the
end both sides end up dirty and in
some awful video. So, to all of UF,
do whatever you can do to end this
repetitive and boring back-and-
forth. Or do nothing. I suppose
you're getting trolled if you do
something because you'd be raging
-bummer. Oh well, you now know
you're being trolled every day,
and in writing this I'm even troll-
ing myself. Damn. Whatever it be,
don't feed the troll. And don't rage
hard when you get trolled hard.

SG poll workers say election experience is rewarding
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Writer
Campaigners sporting Student Govern-
ment party T-shirts are not the only people
telling students to vote on election days.
Every semester about 50 poll workers help
hand students their ballots and reward them
with a sticker after they cast their votes.
On the morning of elections, the poll work-
ers meet in the Reitz Union drop-off area near
the parking garage. They can either drive
themselves to the polling locations or get rideswith election officials. Then, with their packed
lunches and boxes of ballots in hand, they trek
out to their various posts around campus.
Nita Watkins has been manning the polls
at Matherly Hall for three election cycles.
"It's fun being around the college stu-
dents," Watkins said. "Most of them have a
good sense of humor."
Watkins, who is retired, said she moved
to the Gainesville area not too long ago and
thought working as a county poll worker and
UF elections would be something fun to do.
She said her job keeps her busy."It's fun being around the college
students. Most of them have a
good sense of humor."
Nita Watkins
poll worker
"I'm not too interested in sitting around the
house all day," Watkins said.
Watkins said most of the students know
how the elections work and happily stop to
chat with her and the other workers.
Flossie Pressley, who collected the ballotsfrom students at Matherly Hall during this
election, has run UF polls for three years.
She worked at Santa Fe Community Col-
lege for 27 years, and she said working at the
polls is a great way to help students.
"The reception's there, and you are still
serving them," Pressley said.
Supervisor of Elections Ariana Alfonso said
the workers are always excited to help out.
They check ID cards, cross students off the
voter list and help count the number of stu-
dents who voted at the end of the day.
"I think they're just the sweetest," she said.
The project has raised $4K
MAKEOVER, from page 1
he saw "Extreme Makeover:
Home Edition" and decided to
apply the show's concept to local
schools.
Project Makeover director Ju-
lianne Scherker said the group
wants ABC to air clips of paint-
ing and landscaping they do in el-
ementary schools since their proj-
ect was inspired by the show.
Along with paintings and mu-
rals, the makeover will include
donations of books and school
supplies.
The project has raised $4,400,
but Scherker continues to encour-
age people to donate money this
weekend.
The new fundraising goal of
$5,000, which is $1,500 more than
last year's total.
In partnership with the Alach-
ua County Public Schools Foun-
dation, "Project Makeover: Lake
Forest Edition" will air today
through Sunday.
The event will be taped by lo-
cal ABC affiliate WCJB-TV 20.
Abby Snyder, Project Make-
over's director of external publicrelations, said the fundraising
team looked at new strategies by
hosting the first annual Kickin'
for the Kids kickball tournament
to help meet the organization's
financial goals.
Fifteen teams representing stu-
dent groups including the Florida
Cicerones and the UF Ad Society.
She said the teams raised more
than $600 at the tournament.
Members also collected dona-
tions during classes and stood
outside of Wal-Mart asking shop-
Spotlight on the pers for do-
Swamp nations, ac-
cording to
Snyder.
She said the project involves
more than just renovations.
The project is about beautify-
ing the schools and making them
better, she said.
"The biggest way we can
make a difference is by providing
a learning environment where
learning becomes fun," she said.
Scherker encourages people to
find more information by search-
ing "Project Makeovers" on Face-
book.
Kids to sleep in museum
* OVERNIGHT AT THE MUSEUM
WILL BE AT THE FLORIDA
MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY.
By ALLEN HAYNES
Alligator Contributing Writer
Children will sleep next to Columbian
mammoths and butterflies this weekend.
Overnight at the Museum, inspired by
the 2006 film "Night at the Museum," will
take place at the Florida Museum of Natu-
ral History from 7 p.m. Saturday until 9
a.m. Sunday.
"We've been planning something like
this for a while, but once the movie came
out, we knew we had to act on it," said Tif-
fany Ireland, an education assistant at the
museum.
The response to the first overnight pro-
gram, which took place in September, was
overwhelming with about 16 families par-
ticipating, she said. About 30 families canparticipate this weekend.
Participants are responsible for bring-
ing their own sleeping bags, pillows and
overnight items. A variety of arts and
crafts workshops, such as building a bird
house and creating fossil-shaped sand art,
have been scheduled, said Amanda Arner,
public programs education assistant.
A scavenger hunt will be the night's
main event, giving children the oppor-
tunity to really explore the museum, she
said. The night will close with the screen-
ing of "Night at the Museum."
Although overnight stays at museums
existed before the movie, they gained
popularity after the film was released,
said Amer, who stayed at the Museum of
Science and Industry in Tampa with her
Girl Scouts troop.
To register for the event, visit the mu-
seum's Web site, flmnh.ufl.edu. The cost
is $50 for each parent/child pair for mu-
seum members. For nonmembers, the cost
is $65 per pair. Additional guests cost $25,
Amer said.Early voting begins March 8
LOWE, from page 1
tions because they live in Gainesville for
four years, and these elections affect what
happens right here where they live, he
said.
Erin Murphy, a UF environmental sci-
ence sophomore, said she thinks it's impor-
tant for students to vote in local elections.
"I think a lot of students are apathetic
about it, and they think it's not relevant,"
she said. "It's a democracy. When you have
the right to vote, you should always exer-
cise it."
Other candidates are also engaging
Gainesville students.
Mayoral candidate Monica Leadon Coo-
per said she spoke about her campaign to a
UF political science class, and students have
called her on her cell phone to discuss elec-
tion issues.
She also held a campaign fundrais-
ing concert Sunday at the Baird Center in
downtown Gainesville, in which about 12
local musicians performed.
Candidate Ozzy Angulo received an
endorsement from the UF CHISPAS, the
Coalition of Hispanics Integrating SpanishSpeakers through Advocacy and Service,
on Feb. 18.
Angulo said he supports their efforts to
gain the City Commission's endorsement of
the DREAM Act.
Richard Selwach, who's also running
for mayor, said he welcomes help from stu-
dents.
"If they want to get involved, they should
stop by my shop," said Selwach, who owns
Best Jewelery and Loan on Northwest Third
Avenue. "My door is always open. If you
don't vote, you get what you deserve."
Candidate Don Marsh said
Local the decisions voters make
News now will have an impact on
the future of Gainesville.
"I understand the curse
of youth is to think in terms of right now,"
Marsh said. "The investments you make
now will pay off 20,30 years later down the
line."
Early voting for the mayoral election is
March 8 through March 13 at the County
Administration Building, located at 12 SE
First St., and the actual election is March 16.

UF stays unbeaten with win over Siena
UF ace Tommy Toledo took the win in his second start of the season, allowing
two runs and striking out seven in five innings of work.0 TOMMY TOLEDO PITCHED A PERFECT
GAME THROUGH FOUR INNINGS.
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Staff Writer
achiang@alligator org
After struggling with his command in his
first start of the season, Tommy Toledo blamed
it on jitters.
In his second outing, he wasn't as anxious.
"It was definitely a lot better. I felt like I com-
manded the ball a little bit more today," Toledo
said. "I guess getting used to it, the first game
out was a little different, but I felt like I fixed my
mistakes from last game."
He retired the first 12 hitters he faced while
only throwing five called balls on his way to
leading No. 5 Florida (5-0) to a 13-3 victory over
Siena (1-4) on Thursday.
His hopes for a perfect game were dashed in
the fifth inning when first baseman Kevin Quar-
anto drew a walk, but Toledo still picked up the
win, receiving early run support from the top of
UF's batting order.
In the third inning, freshman Austin Maddox,
who started behind the plate for the first time
this season, brought in one run on a sacrifice fly
to right field. Just one at-bat later, Tyler Thomp-
son knocked in two more with a triple down the
right-field line to give the Gators a 3-0 lead.
That was all Toledo needed, as he left the
game after allowing two runs in five innings
of work while racking up a career-high seven
strikeouts on just 59 pitches.
Toledo, who is coming off of shoulder sur-
gery that kept him out of the 2009 season, was
on a limited pitch count because of the cold
weather.
"I even contemplated not throwing him to-
night," UF coach Kevin O'Sullivan said. "I want-
ed to make sure his arm got loose and he had
no restrictions at all, so we went for it. We were
going to let him go five and that was going to be
it, regardless of the pitch count."

No. 3 Florida hosts Northwestern State
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Writer
No matter what style of play North-
western State (8-2) brings to Gainesville this
weekend, the Gators figure to be ready for
it.
Even though No. 3 Florida (9-1) is only 10
games into the season, it has already proven
it can win slugfests and pitchers' duels alike,
which has given the team some early season
confidence heading into the three-game se-ries that starts Saturday at 1 p.m.
"I think that value is
there. We can win 12-8,
and we can win 1-0," UF
coach Tim Walton said.
"That's our game. I think
with our scoring runs, ev-
erybody gets used to us
throwing up home runs.
Walton .It's just a fight. It's
good to know you can
win a 1-0 game, but I hate to have to rely onpitching."
Not only have the Gators shown they can
win with or without run production; they
have also proven they can produce those
runs in a variety of ways.
In a 7-0 win over Campbell, eight of
UF's 11 hits went for extra bases, including
a team-record six homers. But in a 12-4 win
against Kansas only two of the Gators' hits
were for extra bases, as they did the majority

Bulldogs in
tough road
atmosphere
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer

Florida may have played its way
into the NCAA Tournament on Tues-
day night, but coach Billy Donovan
didn't want to talk about it.
Avoiding the numbers games in-
volved in figuring out whether the
Gators will make the field of 65, Dono-
van was more interested in the fact that
UF's 75-62 win over Tennessee put his
team in third in the Southeastern Con-
ference East.
"The more games we win, the better
chance we have to go. If we lose the rest
of our games, we won't go," Donovan
said. "The game was much more about
the fact that we're in third place -the
fact that we're a game out of second.
That's what the
game was about."
UF (20-8, 9-4
-SEC) has a shot at
Men's taking the second-
Basketball place spot from
Vanderbilt, which
would put it in po-
sition for a first-round bye in the SEC
Tournament. And the team hasn't been
mathematically eliminated from the
first-place race yet, although Kentucky
currently has a strong hold on the top
spot.
The Gators will finish out the regu-
lar season against the Commodores
and Wildcats, but their hopes of climb-
ing up the rankings start Saturday at 4
p.m. against Georgia (12-14,4-9 SEC) in
Athens.
The Bulldogs have struggled
throughout the year and are among the
worst teams in the SEC, but they have
practically been a different squad in
Stegeman Coliseum.
All four of Georgia's league wins
have come at home, and two were
double-digit beatings of ranked teams:
a 78-63 win over then-No. 8 Tennessee
on Jan. 23 and a 72-58 victory against
then-No. 18 Vanderbilt on Feb. 6.

Den Dekker extends
hit streak to 14 games
BASEBALL, from page 16
Siena starter Robert Tedesco continued to struggle from
there.
UF tacked on four more in the fourth, including a solo
home run from Ben McMahan, to jump to a 7-0 advantage.
Matt den Dekker picked up an RBI in the frame and also
extended his hitting streak to 14 games, dating back to last
season -a new career high. He continued his early season
tear and finished 4 for 6, increasing his batting average to .500,
while also scoring two runs and swiping a pair of bags on
Thursday.
"I'm just not trying to do too much. I just want
to get on base for the guys to drive me in. I'm
trying to hit line-drive ground balls, and luckily
I'm finding holes right now."

But Florida didn't stop there.
Seven batters hit for UF in a four-run sixth inning in which
the bottom four hitters in the lineup all drove in runs.
Eight Gators finished with RBIs, and nine picked up at
least one hit.
Toledo's two earned runs were the first allowed by Flori-
da's starting pitchers in 22.1 innings.
The Gators were originally scheduled to open their three-
game weekend series against La Salle on Friday, but because
of inclement weather in the Northeast, the game has been
pushed back. The teams will play a doubleheader starting at
2 p.m on Saturday.nior forward Chandler Parsons said.
"We've got a lot of respect for them

The Bulldogs also upset then-No.

"They're a confident team at
home," Donovan said. "They've had
some phenomenal home wins and
have been an extremely good home
team. I don't feel at all our guys are
going into this game and looking at
Georgia or their record or anything
like that at all."
One thing UF would be well-
served to look at, though, is the
game tape from its 87-71 beatdown
of Georgia in Gainesville on Jan. 27.
The Gators negated a hot shoot-
ing night by the Bulldogs by forcing
19 turnovers and taking 13 more
shots.
Georgia shot 59.6 percent from
the field and 57.1 percent from
beyond the arc in the teams' first
matchup, but UF's relentless full-
court pressure led to 12 steals and a
big win despite its lower-percentage
shooting.
Parsons said he expects more of
the same this time around.
"We're going to press them, get
up and down with them, force their
guards to handle the ball," Parsons
said. "They have great personnel, so
we're going to have to match that
and play good defense."
As effective as it was against the
Bulldogs earlier this season, Dono-
van was a little more reluctant to
guarantee a similar game plan, as his
team's lack of depth makes pressing
throughout the game more difficult.
"We've got to pick our spots and
be smart. When we can press, I think
we've got to do it," Donovan said. "I
always enjoy pressing and wish we
had the depth to press all the time,
but we don't have that kind of depth
so it's an area we're a little bit more
selective in."

Coming off of a first-place finish
at home, the Florida men's golf team
will travel to Ponte Vedra Beach on
Sunday to participate in the three-
round John Hayt Invitational. This
invitational is considered the first
collegiate major of the year.
The tournament will take place
at the par 72, 6,895-yard Sawgrass
Country Club golf course.
The Gators' squad will be the
same as it was in the SunTrust Gator
Invitational, which the won, and
will consist of seniors Tim McKen-
ney and Tyson Alexander, juniors
Andres Echavarria and Bank Vong-
vanij and freshman Phillip Choi.
"We gained a little bit of confi-
dence from the Gator [Invitational],
but we are realistic enough to know
that we had some pretty significant
advantages [there]," UF coach Bud-
dy Alexander said. "That tourna-
ment went pretty much as I mighthave expected, but that's not to say
that I am not proud of the way we
played and the way we handled the
pressure and the heat of playing at
home.
"Hopefully that should help us
[realize] that we are capable of put-
ting up numbers like that."
Junior Robbie Wight and fresh-
men Tommy Mou and Tyler Mc-
AlexanderCumber, all of
whom participated
in the Gator Invita-
tional as individu-
als, competed for
the individual spot
for the upcoming
tournament.
McCumber won
in the qualifying rounds and will be
participating as an individual.
"Our goal is every day to come
out and work hard and try to get
a little bit better," Alexander said.
"Hopefully, by the end of the year,
we will be one of the elite teams."Florida travels to SEC Indoors

Alligator Writer
Charlotte Browning hasn't had many chanc-
es to impress during the indoor track and field
season. She has a big opportunity this week-
end.
Browning, who holds the Southeastern
Conference's best time in the mile and sixth-
best time in the 800, and the rest of the No. 4
men's and No. 3 women's track and field teams
begin the 2010 SEC Indoor Championships on
Friday.
The three-day event, featuring every team
in the conference, will take place in Fayetteville,
Ark., at the Randal Tyson Track Center.
On the women's side, middle-distance
events will be imperative for the Gators, as they
try to hold off No. 5 LSU, No. 6 Arkansas and
No. 9 Auburn for an SEC championship. No.
4 Tennessee, featuring one of the premier dis-
tance units in the country, may be UF's tough-
est competition.
Browning will attempt to win the mile like
she did in her only try in 2010 at the Husky
Classic. She'll also run the 3K for the first timethis season and try to challenge UT's Jackie
Areson, who holds the best 3K time in the con-
ference on the season at 9:07, about 23 seconds
ahead of UF's Rebecca Lowe, who holds the
next-best time.
"Coach (Mike) Hollowayis definitelysetting
us to peak at the right time," Browning said. "I
feel I'm ready to run my best at this point."
Shot-putter Mariam Kevkhishvili is expect-
ed to win the women's shot put
title like she has in every other
competition this season.
Her best throw in 2010 is
Track nearly two meters better than
the next-best mark in the SEC,
and she is the only automatic
qualifier shot-putter for the NCAA champion-
ships from the conference.
On the men's side, UF will have to contend
with No. 3 LSU and No. 6 Arkansas to pull out
a conference championship.
Individually, Christian Taylor will be a fa-
vorite to win three gold medals at the SECs.
The defending national champion in the triple
jump will also compete in the long jump and
anchor the 4x400 relay team.

Florida heads to North Carolina for early season test
ETHE TAR HEELS ARE THE
FIRST RANKED TEAM UF HAS
FACED.
By TONI-ANN MILLER
Alligator Writer
Florida midfielder Rachael
Zimmerman and assistant coach
Erica LaGrow have two things in
common. Both played lacrosse at
North Carolina, and now the two
are at Florida.
Sunday, the duo will visit fa-
miliar ground when the Gators
(2-0) take on the No. 4 Tar Heels
(3-0) in UF's second-consecutive
road contest.
Zimmerman, a sophomore,
played at UNC for just one season
before taking a year away from the
sport and coming to Gainesville.
Going up against her former
team will just be another test
for her and the Gators. She has
moved on from her time in North
Carolina with no regrets.
"I don't really think I have
anything to prove to my old team-
mates or my coach," Zimmerman
said. "I'm pretty much at peace
with the whole situation, so I
don't think I'll be too nervous."
The match will be the toughest
test for the Gators' lacrosse pro-Matt Tripp / Alligator Staff

as a member of the Gators' staff
for what she said will be "a great
game.
"A lot of them were my for-
mer teammates," LaGrow said.
"I competed with them day-in
and day-out, so I know their little
nuances and what they do pretty
well. Hopefully that can provide
us with an advantage over them."
On the field, UF's emphasis
will be on attacking and control-
ling possession to keep the ball
out of the sticks of the dangerous
Tar Heels' offense.
The challenge for the Gators is
paramount. UNC has a 3-0 record,
winning its first three games by 11,
six and 12 points, respectively.
UF coach Amanda O'Leary
said her team has been giving 100
percent in each of its games so far,
and she expects her players to rise
to the level of competition North
Carolina will bring Sunday.
"They're one of the top pro-
grams in the country," O'Leary
said. "It'll be a huge test for us to
go in there and play against a high
caliber team, but that's why these
kids are at Florida, to be able to
play against the best of the best,
and certainly Carolina is one of
those elite teams."
UF looks to end league
play with win at Auburn
By TOM GREEN
Alligator Writer
When No. 4 Florida faces off
against No. 16 Auburn tonight at
8, the team will be wary of a let-
down.
The Gators (5-2, 4-1 Southeast-
ern Conference) are coming off
their best team performance, and
arguably their biggest win of the
season, after beating rival Geor-
gia in Gainesville for the first time
since 1990.
But that was last week, and while
the victory helped boost the team's
confidence, coach Rhonda Faehn
made sure the gymnasts realized it
was just one meet and the team still
has a lot left to accomplish.
"That meet was great, but it's
done now, and we need to focus
on the rest of the season," Faehn
said. "I was pretty hard on them on
Monday. I certainly wasn't going
to accept a bad practice because we
think we did so well. I gave them a
harder assignment."
That assignment was closing
out the SEC schedule on a high
note against Auburn (2-4, 2-3 SEC),
which Faehn said always seems
to have its best competition of the
year when the Gators visit.Florida is 2-2 in its last four trips
to Auburn, and the meets have been
decided by half a point or less, in-
cluding a Florida loss by one-tenth
of a point in Faehn's first visit there
as UF's coach in 2004.
While the meets have been close
against the Tigers, the team's focus
is to come away with a good road
score to count toward its season to-
tal in order to drop the 195.475 it
scored against N.C. State.
"We've been building and build-
ing after each
competition, so
we have to fix
the mistakes weGymnastics made against
Georgia," senior
Maranda Smith said.
Of those mistakes, Faehn said
the Gators had only one stuck land-
ing each on vault and bars, and
three on beam.
In a perfect world, she would
like to see at least 75 percent of the
landings stuck for the team to im-
prove its scores and avoid a disap-
pointment against Auburn.
"I don't expect a letdown,"
Smith said. "We've been training
so hard that I expect for us to go in
there and do well and come home
with a win."UF TENNIS
Gators will face top-15 teams
By ANDREW OLSON
Alligator Writer
Before the Florida tennis teams start
Southeastern Conference play in March,
they'll have to get through two top-15
teams at home on Sunday.
In its first match in a week, the No. 6
men's team will face No. 13 Illinois at 1
p.m., and the No. 9 women's team will fol-
low up its 7-0 win over No. 15 FSU with a
clash against No. 6 Duke, the defending na-
tional champions, at 4 p.m.
The Blue Devils will present a stiff
challenge, and UF women's coach Roland
Thornqvist praised Duke's "championship
attitude."
"As defending national champions,
they're used to winning," Thornqvist said.
"Duke won't be intimidated by playing at
Florida."
Duke is 10-1 on the season, with the lone
loss coming against then-No. 11 North Car-
olina.
Last weekend, the Blue Devils topped
No. 7 Michigan and Furman.
They opened Atlantic Coast Conference
play Thursday with a sweep of N.C. State
at home.
Senior Anastasia Revzina isn't getting
caught up in the Duke hype.
"When we go out there and play, we're
not thinking about rankings or who won
what," Revzina said.
As one of two contributing upperclass-
men, Revzina is considered a team leader,
and she has been impressed with the young
group of players she is charged with lead-
ing.
Three of the Gators' four freshmen wereimportant factors in this week's sweep of
FSU.
"They've gotten much better," Revzina
said. "They're more mature now. It has
been good for them to play a few matches
before SEC season."
The men's team has also benefited from
the contributions of some of its newcom-
ers.
Bob Van Overbeek was named SEC
Freshman of the Week after a strong perfor-
mance that helped put the team in position
early to clinch the victory against USF last
week.
His doubles partner, freshman Billy Fe-
derhofer, said Van Overbeek's positive at-
titude has helped the two
freshmen adjust to the
learning curve of playing
college tennis.
"He's so positive out
there, which makes him a
fun guy to have on your
Reyzina team," Federhofer said.
"We lost our first couple
matches partly because we were nervous.
Now, we're playing better because we're
more positive, more confident."
Van Overbeek and Federhofer have
made an effort to win the doubles set on
court No. 3 early to help take the pressure
off the team's leaders, the country's No.
10-ranked doubles team of Alexandre Lac-
roix and Antoine Benneteau.
And their match could be the deciding
factor against Illinois.
"Illinois is really good in doubles," UF
men's tennis coach Andy Jackson said.
"There's a long history of close, tight
matches between these two teams."
