Eunice Johnson, 65, who received two Ph.D.s from UF, raises her arms in celebration as she shares her testimony 
of how she has battled with and is a survivor of both Waldenström macroglobulinemia cancer and urinary bladder cancer, during the 18-hour fifth annual Relay For Life fundraiser at the O’Connell Center on Friday night.

More than 400 small, white paper bags bearing the 
names of those affected by cancer lit up the indoor track of 
the O’Connell Center as about 1,200 participants walked a 
silent lap and carried candles in remembrance. 
Friday night marked UF’s fifth annual Relay for Life 
fundraiser, which gave participants and cancer survivors 
an opportunity to pool their donations and walk for a cure.
As the opening lap came to an end, the lights came on 
and nearly 15 hours of walking commenced to symbolize the search for a cure.
Many were costumed to match the event’s theme of dif-
ferent destinations.
UF sophomore Mark Adams, dressed in pirate attire 
and sporting a heart-shaped tattoo that read “Matey for life,” began walking the track in honor of his father, who died during Adams’ senior year of high school.
A member of Friends for Life, a student organization 
that raises awareness of pediatric cancer, Adams said the group chose to dress as pirates for its theme of “Treasure Is-land” to entertain other walkers during the 18-hour relay.
While some participants walked the track, others visited 
the 62 booths circling the upper and lower floors, which of-fered different activities, such as face painting and video games, as well as a place to rest.
Adams said his group planned to raise money at their 
booth throughout the night by giving temporary tattoos and offering a jail cell for participants to “put a matey in the brig.” 
David Rountree, event chairman, said donations col-
lected at and before the event totaled  about $114,339, as 
of Sunday night.  Online donations for the event have not ON c AMpuSRelay for Life raises money to cure cancer

Five men, some hairy, some shaved 
clean below the waist, sprinted across a field of clay, soggy from Saturday’s squall. 
The footing was treacherous, made 
more difficult by a lack of shoes. In the traditional Olympian fashion, they were nude.

Greek Athletic meet in Monticello.

Pulling my car up to the registration

male division. He wore a leather gladi-ator chest piece, a cotton undershirt, and nothing else. Stephen later told me, while standing bare in the discus-throw-ing circle, he would buy dinner for any-one who could find him a “worthy op-Nude olympics held

Dell, a hand surgeon at Shands at UF, and 
his wife Ruthie co-founded Hands to Love’s 
Hand Camp to help children emotionally 
cope with  their congenital hand condition.
The ninth annual Hand Camp, themed 
“Marvel-At-Us” took place Friday through Sunday, and gave kids the opportunity to participate in activities they might shy away from elsewhere.  Kids cheered each other on as they tack-
led rope climbing, swimming and archery.
Guest speaker UF football coach Urban 
Meyer surprised the group, signing more 
than 300 autographs and distributing auto-
graphed posters of Tim Tebow.
Meyer was introduced by camper Jacob 
Rodriguez, 9, who compared the Gator Na-tion’s superhero coach to his personal super-heroes, the Dells.

Local teens help with alcohol sting
Teenagers working with the Alachua 
County Sheriff’s Office helped catch four 
convenience stores selling alcohol and cigarettes to minors. 
The sting tested 29 stores Friday night, 
finding four that sold to minors illegally, ASO spokesman Art Forgey said.
“Obviously we would like to see that 
number be zero, but that would be in a perfect world,” Forgey said.
He said ASO feels good about the op-eration because it showed that most stores abide by the alcohol and tobacco laws.
“Twenty-one means 21, and 18 to sell 
tobacco means 18,” Forgey said.
He said that sometimes the store clerks 
can get sloppy and not think about what they are doing when selling these prod-ucts.
Each store clerk who sold alcohol or to-
bacco to minors was given a written arrest and a notice to appear in court, he said.

Because of the rain Saturday 
night, the concert was moved 
from the Gainesville Downtown Community Plaza to the P.K. Yonge Auditorium.
Conductor Evans Haile said 
the Pops concert  gives the or-chestra a chance to reach out to

For almost 500 people, the 
orchestra played a smorgasbord of music including pieces from  
Broadway’s “Show Boat” and 
“E.T.” 
The orchestra also played 
“A Tribute to Henry Mancini,” which featured the theme song from “The Pink Panther.”
Buchholz High School senior

Thirteenth Street became a runway for 
vintage vehicles Saturday when a local 
nonprofit group held a charity showcase for motorcycles and classic cars.
The car show, hosted by The Sunshine 
Eagles service organization, raised about $800 for the Dignity Project, a local non-profit organization that repairs cars and computers and gives them to underprivi-leged families.
Owners of each of the 15 cars and mo-
torcycles on display paid a $10 gate fee and collected donations to compete for tro-phies. 
People walking by a white ambulance 
from the ‘50s and a vintage red Mustang heard motorcycle owners revving their en-gines in friendly competition. 
On display were an American Ironhorse 
Texas Chopper and a Harley Davidson Heritage Soft Tail.
In addition to perusing the classic cars 
and motorcycles, visitors to the five-hour 
event bought raffle tickets, quesadillas and 
doughnuts.
Participants competed for the people’s 
choice award by accumulating the most change in pint-sized plastic containers next to their vehicles. The money was counted at the end of the show to determine who would win and receive recycled softball and hockey trophies.
People also bid in a silent auction for 
items from local businesses like Bush Gator Transmissions, which donated two $500 service certificates, and Gainesville Harley Davidson & Buell, which donated about $500 worth of merchandise, according to Dignity Project spokesman Chuck Gregg.
Gregg said beyond raising money, the 
goal of the event was to raise awareness 
about the Dignity Project, which has donat-
ed 782 cars since it was founded in 1998.
Gregg said the project allows mentors to 
teach at-risk youth to work on cars and use computers so they’ll have the skills needed to enter the job market in the future.
“We take the computers apart and tell 
them to put them back together,” he said. “We tell them, ‘Don’t be afraid! They’re al-ready broken.’” 
Gainesville resident Vicky Quinn, vice 
president of the classic car club Gainesville Street Rods, brought her vintage rat rod out to support the project. She said that in today’s economy, it’s important to provide teenagers skills that will help them find 
jobs.
Jan Hukle, Sunshine Eagles auxiliary 
vice president, said she hopes to make it a 
yearly tradition. 
“We’re so proud to have raised that 
much,” she said. “It was a light crowd, but it was a good one.”Car show raises $800

ponent” to compete nude. After parking, I hid behind 
my car, and slowly arranged the bananas, oranges, water and sun lotion in my book bag.                                
Facing the social equivalent of jumping out of an 
airplane, I was in no hurry. Nobody explained when 
or where to strip down, but I didn’t want to turn in 
my paperwork at the registration desk clothed.
Finally, I took the plunge, which turned out to be 
the most difficult part, besides dealing with the sun-
burn. Organizers demonstrated the ancient methods 
in the long jump, the discus, the javelin and the 200 
meter dash.                                         
Six men competed in the non-
athlete class and two competed as athletes. While no women competed, 
several looked on from the crowd, 
some cheering on their friends.
After long jumping into a trough of mud, the com-
petitors washed off in a nearby pond and moved onto 
the discus, followed by the 200-yard dash and the jav-
elin.
AJ, a non-athlete, and Kevin, an athlete, from Flor-
ida State University, took first place in their respective 
divisions.    While sitting on a bench in the buff follow-
ing the Olympics, Paul LeValley, Naturally’s remain-
ing active founder, discussed his captivation with the 
idea of nudism and classical philosophers.
He wrote his dissertation on the gymnosophists, 
the nude philosophers that Alexander the Great met 
in India, and has written a column for “Travel Natu-
rally” magazine about nudism in art history, accord-
ing to his Web site.
For LeValley, who sports a philosopher’s beard, 
there is a connection between his research and his 
nudism.

Warsteiner, Presidente, Budweiser, Sapporo 
and Dundee are just a few of the dozens of beers 
slung back by festival goers on Saturday. 
Gainesville residents attended the Greater 
Gator Beer Festival, where, for $25, they were 
supplied with small plastic cups and unlimited, 2 
oz. refills of international beers from places such as Russia, Japan and Spain. The festival also had Floridian beers such as Orange Blossom Pilsner and Shipyard.
Sweaty masses of people crowded the beer 
booths, holding out their cups and trying to catch the eye of the beer pourers to plead for refills.
Festival organizers were unsure of how many 
people attended but said they gave away about 2,000 beer cups. Snacking on pizza, chicken wings, shepherd’s pie and chocolate-filled pastries, peo-ple swayed to Neil Diamond’s “Sweet Caroline” shouting the “bah, bah, bah” of the chorus. 
Despite the economy, this year showed the 
greatest diversity of beer and more food than pre-vious years, said Ricki Black, an organizer for the event. The only visible response to the downturn was that some beer vendors brought fewer cases this year, she said.
Ruben Parra, a UF telecommunications major 
from Spain, was disappointed with the one beer from his country, but was impressed with the festival, he said. Alhambra isn’t even in the top 
five of Spanish beers, but the hot dogs, wings and 
chicken nachos made up for it, he said.  
The festival provided people with a way to try 
beers they wouldn’t venture to buy.

been added, but Rountree said about $10,000 
has been donated via Internet so far.
He said all of the money will be given to 
the American Cancer Society, which paid for the event’s expenses.
Teams were asked to chose a theme based 
on this year’s title “Cruising for a Cure,” said UF sophomore Andrew Ruiz, 19, event co-chairman for the event. Many booths por-trayed islands such as Fiji, Ireland and Ant-arctica, while others centered on outer-world-
ly destinations such as “Cosmic Lounge” and 
“Never Neverland.”
Ruiz, who said the idea for the theme came 
from summer workshops, has participated in the event since his freshman year of high school and has since raised about $36,000.
Ruiz was 13 years old when he lost his 
mother to breast cancer.  Despite the hard-ship, he decided to make a difference.  
“It was like a wall I had to overcome,” he 
said. “It hit me hard when she passed away.”
Manned with a headset and turquoise staff shirt, Ruiz said he stayed at the event for about 24 hours to oversee all the committees involved.   
Cancer survivors, dressed in purple T-
shirts with “Survivor” sashes, shared their stories throughout the event.  
UF freshman and 19-year-old cancer sur-
vivor Devon Vickers said she was diagnosed with an adult form of leukemia in 2001, a type of cancer  rarely seen in children.  
In 2006, Vickers said she received a bone 
marrow transplant, and her cancer has since been in remission.
While she has all her strength back and can 
live life as a normal student, she stressed there 
is no foolproof cure for cancer. 
“It’s the closest thing to being cured,” she 
said.  
can be themselves and happy.”
Since its creation in 2000, the 
camp has focused on helping pa-
tients adjust to a congenital condi-tion occurring in one of every 5,000 births in which a person is born with 
abnormalities of the hands, arms or 
fingers. 
Campers, between 7 months old 
and 13 years old, made superhero capes and superman masks and par-ticipated in physical activities.
The program aims to provide 
campers with self-confidence through activities designed for their success, Dell said.                                   
“They’re able to see other kids 
with the exact diagnosis,” he said. 
“That’s so important.”
There are few people who under-
stand the camp’s impact better than 
19-year-old Jackie Kenyon.
Since birth, she underwent seven reconstructive surgeries to increase functionality of her fingers. 
“You know in your head you’re 
not the only person with a differ-ence, but it’s hard to deal with be-
cause you never see it,” Kenyon said.  
For her, it’s the un-
comfortable everyday 
occurrences that she has to over-come, such as handing money to a cashier.
“It’s the little things that build up,” she said. First attending as a camper, then as a counselor, Ke-nyon now uses her bad experiences to mentor other children and their family members.
“The good days are made sweet-
er by the bad ones,” she said. “And t h e  b a d  o n e s  m a k e  y o u  s t r o n g e r . ”                                                        
She especially advises protective 
parents to let their children figure things out for themselves. 
“Everyone has to deal with fail-
ure, whether you have 10 fingers or not,” she said.
For 49-year-old Wendy Stoeker, 
who was taking pictures at the camp with her feet, sharing her skills with campers is one of the highlights.
Stoeker proudly said that she 
drives a car and competed as a diver on UF’s swim team.
She taught a camper how to drink 
from a  regular cup using her feet.
“As a 3-year-old, she gets that 
we’re the same,” she said. “You can’t put a price on this weekend.”Cancer survivors, victims remembered during relay for cancer cure

Today’s question: Has our gener -
ation lost its sense of adventure?
86 TOTAL VOTES53% YES
47% NOFriday’s question: Let’s rage?For one former colle-
giate rower, raising awareness about can-
cer meant taking his talents to the ocean – all 2,950 miles 
of it.
Paul Ridley, a 25-year-old 
who lost his mother to can-
cer, set out to row across the Atlantic Ocean in hopes of collecting $500,000 in dona-tions for research at the Yale Cancer Center.
His journey proved to be 
anything but easy – as Rid-ley only had a pair of oars to navigate the waters and did not enjoy the luxury of a support boat following him along the way. Even though the trek across the ocean left him riddled with salt sores, exhaustion and 
blisters, Ridley became the 
youngest American and just third overall to successfully complete the trip. Relying on freeze-dried food and a satellite phone to post blog updates about his adven-ture, Ridley rowed up to 12 hours per day in his custom-ized boat to accomplish his goal in 88 days.
Ridley and his sister cre-
ated the organization “Row for Hope” in memory of their mother, having raised $100,000 thanks to his daring journey across the Atlantic Ocean. 
The Editorial Board ap-
plauds Paul Ridley for his 
efforts to attract attention 
to cancer research and raise money for such a worthy cause. Ridley’s accomplish-ments work to dispel the no-tion that one single person cannot make a major differ-ence to combat cancer. While he may have fallen short of 
his original goal of $500,000, 
we hope Ridley’s story will encourage others to push their own perceived limits and do something coura-geous to help others.
Stoners everywhere have been getting mixed signals 
lately thanks to the Obama administration’s stance on legalizing marijuana. Last week, Secretary of State 
Hillary Clinton visited Mexico for her first diplomatic tour of the country that has been rocked by more than 7,300 deaths in the Mexican government’s war on drugs. Clin-ton alluded to a change in U.S. drug policy after conceding 
that America’s voracious appetite for drugs only fuels the 
problem. 
Not so fast, said President Barack Obama when an-
swering an online question during a town hall forum last week. Legalizing marijuana is off the table in his admin-
istration. 
It really is silly, the pot question, to be brought up dur-
ing this time of crisis. But if there’s ever been a time to re-
examine our war on drugs, Mexico’s growing drug prob-
lem and our burgeoning prison bills couldn’t be stronger 
signs that the time for some introspection is upon us. 
The classical argument against legalizing marijuana 
doesn’t focus on the drug itself but rather the supposed slippery slope the legalization would promote. How could 
the government legalize one drug but ignore the others? 
For many, the answer is paradoxically clear. Alcohol, a 
drug that claims thousands, if not millions of addicts, and 
kills more than 70,000 people per year, according to the 
Center for Disease Control, is perfectly legal for adults 21 
and up. There are currently more than 40 million Ameri-cans who smoke, all of whom will only burden our health care system years down the road. 
Florida’s Medical Examiners Commission released a 
report last year that found prescription drugs had claimed three times as many lives as all illegal drugs combined in 2007 – a statistic Rush Limbaugh and middle-aged con-servative women with back prob-lems aren’t helping. The same report found that marijuana use 
had caused zero deaths in the 
state.
I cannot condone smoking 
pot. The recreational user is most 
likely to inhale some amount of 
smoke, which can’t be beneficial to any person’s lungs. 
It is inconceivable, though, to 
condone the criminalization of 
marijuana when it has fostered the very drug culture where anti-marijuana activists derive their arguments. Want to talk about a gateway drug? Ask your friendly neighbor-hood drug dealer what he thinks about free samples of 
crack cocaine. Worried about increasing gun battles over 
drug deals gone wrong? No need for exceptional violence when you can simply pick up some weed from your local convenience store. 
The total money saved and raked in through taxes 
could go toward education programs for students, as similar tobacco and alcohol programs have shown success in curbing use of these products in recent years among teenagers.  The industry created by legalization could put 
thousands back to work and would take away much of the 
power enjoyed by cartels and other unsavory figures of our government-perpetuated drug culture. 
Once marijuana is taken off the forbidden shelf, our in-
ner Adam and Eve complex won’t fall to temptation – cre-
ating an environment where marijuana use declines.
Matthew Christ is a political science freshman. His column 
appears on Mondays.For Texas gun owners licensed to carry concealed weap-
ons, proposed state legislation may soon allow for fire-arms to be found in an unlikely place – college cam-
puses.
The two bills, one in the House and the other in the Senate, 
are being promoted by supporters as a way to ensure that a massacre along the lines of Virginia Tech does not occur in Texas. According to the Gainesville Sun, the University of Texas has taken a strong stance against the bills by passing resolutions against them. Opponents of the bill, including one former Virginia Tech student who now attends UT as a graduate student, argue that legislation allowing for guns on campus will result in students using their weapons in un-necessary situations.
While 18 states have proposed and failed to pass similar 
bills, Texas is among seven other states currently exploring on-campus firearms legislation.
The Editorial Board strongly believes the passage of bills 
to allow for concealed weapons on college campuses is not the right approach to deter future shootings. If anything, legally allowing guns to have a place in college dorms and classrooms will only breed an environment that complete-ly contradicts the intention behind the legislation. Instead of cutting down on campus shootings, who is to say that if passed, these bills won’t lead to coeds pulling guns on their significant other over a minor disagreement or professors feeling unsafe in their own classrooms?
To consider the allowance for firearms on college campus-
es as the cure-all to ending school shootings is simply a gross miscalculation on the part of Texas state legislators.

Letters to the Editor
Doctors should be paid based on work
I am not part of the UF Faculty Practice 
Plan, but I do know that it is common prac-
tice (especially in large doctor groups) for doctors to be paid a base salary and then additional income based on how many pa-
tients they see. That way, people who work 
harder and see more patients get additional income.
Further, I am not aware of anyone in the 
Faculty Practice Plan who squandered bil-lions of UF dollars and contributed to the collapse of the economy like the executives at AIG did.
Now, imagine that article without the 
word “bonus.” If the headline had read “Doctors earn typical income for working 
hard and taking care of their patients,” I 
doubt there would be much controversy.
Dr. David E. Winchester
UF alumDocumentary Institute needs to survive
By eliminating the Documentary Insti-
tute, it is now clear that Dean John Wright is utilizing the current budget crisis to re-shape the College of Journalism and Com-munications to his own vision and heed the 
advice to “never waste a good crisis.” He 
claims that the DI is “not as central to the college’s mission.” I would invite every-one to read the college’s mission statement on its Web site. It states, foremost, that the college should produce “exemplary profes-sional practitioners” for “various journalism and communication fields.” From another perspective, the DI could fit directly into the college’s mission, which is open to wide in-terpretation. Unfortunately, the DI does not fit into the more personal mission of Dean Wright.

Today’s installment of the 
Eric Chianese Chronicles will bring to the forefront 
something that’s been on my mind quite a bit lately--and I warn you in 
advance, this isn’t for the faint of 
heart.
There’s a question that’s been 
plaguing me: where has our collec-tive sense of adventure gone? Let me be clear — I’m referring to my gen-eration; known by the sociologists in their vulgar claptrap as “Genera-tion Y.” Despite my discomfort at 
being catalogued and analyzed in 
a manner befitting a new species of insect, I find the name appropriate. We have truly become a genera-tion that asks why—and asks it too often. The native hue of resolution that is the birthright of American youth has, in Shakespearean fash-ion, become “sicklied o’er with the 
pale cast of thought.” Perhaps some elaboration is necessary.
We are an apathetic genera-
tion-— no one is denying this and, 
hell, it’s part of what makes us so bright. Of course, this apathy was 
temporarily broken with the tre-
mendous outpouring of enthusiasm created by the Obama campaign.
Well and good, but let’s not for-
get something: that enthusiasm was over a once-every-four-years presi-dential election and, more than that, it was something that was thor-oughly within the existing system. 
Instead of burning with the fire and 
passion of youth, we’ve become a generation of armchair nihilists and play-it-safe philosophers.
The blame is not entirely ours. 
I’ve long had a bone to pick with the hippie counterculture movement of our parents’ (in some cases, I sup-pose, grandparents’) generation. 
They had the right idea at the out-set: a com-
plete rebel-lion against the staid, neo-Victo -
rian order of the day. Except they gave up. The hippies got older, the Age of 
Aquarius didn’t dawn and they re-alized that — wait a minute — they 
had to get jobs. And so they capitu-
lated and paved the way for the most disgusting ideological group in recent history, the Reaganauts of the ‘80s. Our forebears lost that Hunter S. Thompson sense of their “inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil.” Their ideology shattered and, subsequently, there 
were no great models for us to fol-low.
My essential complaint, I sup-
pose, is this: we’re jaded. Largely 
gone is our sense of the wonder and mystery in the world. We think, 
now, before we act and we rethink 
and we vacillate. We’ve become a generation without ideals--one which has no higher purpose than “get the grades, get the degree, get a good job, make a lot of money.” That, fortunately, is not life and there is so much more out there if only one makes the effort to seize 
it.
Luckily, the disease is not yet 
terminal. Call it nihilism, call it apa-
thy, but no matter the terminology one uses, this enfeebling of our gen-erational sense of adventure is suck-ing the life from us slowly. We’re becoming “a whole generation,” as Camus described his post-WWII 
contemporaries, “intoxicated by nihilism and yet lost in loneliness, 
with weapons in our hands and a lump in our throats.”
I see a gray future for us all if we 
don’t start seizing the day. We need 
to recapture the sense of joie de 
vivre and what-the-hell confidence that has been lost somewhere along the line. Go on a road trip. Chase a dream. Most of all, find a passion that burns and live for it. Remem-ber, you only live once—and some people not even that.
I guess the ideal that I feel de-
serves aspiration that can be best summed up by referring again to Thompson: “Walk tall, kick ass, learn to speak Arabic, love music and never forget that you come from a long line of truth-seekers, lovers and warriors.” That’s how legends are made.

BRACKET CHALLENGE TODAY IN UF SPORTS HISTORY POLL QUESTIONUF SOFTBALL
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator.org
The difference between a tough 
loss and a series sweep: about 5 
feet.
The UF softball team entered the 
bottom of the seventh Sunday down 
6-1 but pulled to within 2 with two 
runners on. With two outs on the board, freshman Michelle Moult-rie’s shot to right field fell just short 
of the warning track and into Jazlyn 
Lunceford’s glove.
Alabama pitcher Kelsi Dunne 
(13-1, 1.40 ERA), who threw 392 
pitches over the weekend, held 
the Gators to just 1 run going into 
the bottom of the seventh. The top 
of the order strung together a few hits and walks to get on base, and Francesca Enea’s 3-run homer put 
UF within striking distance. The 
bottom of the order couldn’t finish 
the job, though, as catcher Kristina Hilberth struck out and Moultrie’s flyout put an end to the comeback.
“I talked about that in the fourth 
inning that we haven’t been in this position before, so let’s find a way to answer,” UF coach Tim Wal-
ton said. “And we’ll get a little bit 
tougher from this, and obviously we didn’t win, but I thought we showed some character.”
Despite the loss in Game 3, the 
No. 1 Gators (34-3, 13-1 Southeast-ern Conference) won their weekend series against the No. 4 Crimson Tide (27-6, 7-4 SEC) with two mer-cy-rule victories Saturday.
UF struggled on both sides of the 
ball Sunday, committing two errors and striking out 13 times against Dunne. 
“We did a great job in that last 
inning, but when you go back and look at the mistakes we made in the game — the No. 1 team can’t make those kinds of mistakes, so we’ve got some work to do,” Hilberth said.
In addition to the mistakes they 
made, the Gators also had to deal with several questionable calls by the umpires. During the seventh-inning rally, third baseman Corrie Brooks hit a ball that appeared to have fallen just inside the line, but it was called foul. Gators’ seventh-inning rally falls short in series finale

■ UF LOST ITS TOP 2 WIDE 
RECEIVERS FROM LAST YEAR.
By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmccall@alligator.org
After watching receivers Percy 
Harvin and Louis Murphy work out 
for NFL scouts at UF’s Pro Day on March 18, Urban Meyer came to an unpleasant realization.
For the first time during his tenure 
in Gainesville, the Gators were losing their top two receivers.
“I’m wondering how we’re go-
ing to get a first down next year after watching that receiving workout,” Meyer said.
With Harvin and Murphy headed 
for the NFL, UF entered spring prac-
tice waiting for playmakers to emerge 
and fill the void.
Senior David Nelson, who caught 
crucial touchdowns in the Southeast-ern Conference title game and BCS Championship, will be charged with leading the group, and he sees a lot of potential in his under-the-radar unit.
“I expect this to be one of the 
best receiving groups in the coun-try because we’re solid all the way through,” Nelson said. “No one really expects a whole lot after losing Mur-phy, (tight end Cornelius Ingram) and Percy, but I think we’re going to sur-prise people.”
Nelson, Deonte 
Thompson and Riley Cooper will be the most experienced wideouts returning, but none of those three tallied half as 
many yards or catches as Murphy and Harvin last season.
Tight end Aaron Hernandez, 
UF’s third-leading receiver in 2008, will provide a steady presence in the passing game, but someone will have to take over the diverse role Harvin played. 
Last year, he was second on the 
team in rushing (660 yards on 70 car-ries) and receiving (644 yards on 40 
catches), and he excelled on direct WRs lack experience

The Gators have a case of the hitting bug.
It started with a couple players early in 
the season, but it spread to everybody on the 
team this weekend.
UF’s recent offensive explosion continued 
Sunday in its 10-7 victory against Alabama, 
completing the weekend-series sweep. The 
Gators scored 30 runs on the weekend.
“When one guy is hitting good, we feed 
off it,” junior Clayton Pisani said. “It’s defi-
nitely contagious.”
Every starter had a hit in Sunday’s win for 
UF (18-8, 6-3 Southeastern Conference), and six starters had two. 
It wasn’t just the hitting that led the Gators 
to the sweep. The bullpen was called upon 
again to stop the bleeding early. 
Patrick Keating’s start ended after he al-lowed 5 runs in 3 1/3 innings, letting the 
Crimson Tide keep pace with the 5 runs scored by the Gators. 
UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan turned the ball 
over to Anthony DeSclafani (2-0, 3.80 ERA) with the bases loaded and one out to pre-
vent Alabama from pulling away.
DeSclafani responded 
by striking out the first hit-ter and got help on the last out of the inning from Matt den Dekker, who made a 
sliding catch in center field 
to keep any more runs from scoring.
DeSclafani was nearly perfect — except in 
the eighth when he gave up two solo hom-ers — allowing just one hit and the minimum of 11 hitters over the previous 3 2/3 innings Offense blows past Alabama

“Once again we didn’t get a great 
start out of our starter in Patrick, but 
our bullpen and DeSclafani did a heck 
of a job for us and settled things down in those middle innings,” O’Sullivan said.
Getting a strong outing from a re-
liever was nothing new for the Gators, as they needed Clint Franklin’s (2-0, 2.45 ERA) four innings of shutout pitching to keep the team in the game during UF’s 11-4 win Friday. Starter Jeff Barfield al-
lowed Alabama to get a 4-run lead in 
three innings. 
Saturday starter Nick Maronde gave 
up 7 runs over 4 2/3 innings before Alex Panteliodis threw 3 1/3 innings and al-lowed just 1 run to keep the game in the Gators’ reach. They rebounded in dramatic fashion 
to win 9-8 with a 7-run ninth inning.
Sunday’s win was the only weekend 
game the Gators did not need late rallies 
to win.
UF crept back into the game Friday 
before taking the lead with a 3-run sev-
enth and ran away with the game dur-ing a 6-run eighth.
On Saturday, the Gators needed a big 
ninth inning to overcome the 8-2 deficit they faced.
UF jumped out in front in the first in-
ning Sunday on a 2-run homer by Avery Barnes. 
Although the Gators never trailed, 
a 4-run fifth inning sparked by a 2-run double from Pisani put the game out of reach.
Hot bats and the dominance of the 
bullpen led to UF’s first sweep of Ala-
bama since 1994.
Some of those relievers could see 
themselves getting an opportunity soon 
because O’Sullivan said he was going to 
look into a change in the starting rota-
tion.
“We’ll sit down as a coaching staff 
and try to figure out (if changes need to be made),” O’Sullivan said.Hot hitting makes up for lackluster starting pitching in weekend sweep14, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, MARCH 30, 2009
Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff 
UF second baseman Clayton Pisani tags out Alabama’s Jake Smith during the Gators’ 9-8 
comeback win against the Crimson Tide on Saturday at McKethan Stadium.
A similar situation occurred in 
the top of the fifth, when Brooks 
seemingly turned an infield 
grounder into a triple play, but the ball was ruled foul well after Brooks had made the throw to first 
for the third out. The Tide went on 
to score 3 runs in the inning.
“The officiating’s not really 
anything we can control,” Hil-
berth said. “So we just had to work 
through that adversity and try to 
become a better team, whether it 
goes your way or not.”
Saturday was a completely dif-
ferent story for both teams. 
Dunne, who had her way with 
the UF lineup for most of Game 3, gave up all 9 runs in UF’s 9-1 vic-tory in Game 1 in front of a record crowd of 2,423. 
UF outscored Alabama 19-2 on 
Saturday, and five of the top six hitters in the Gators’ lineup added to their home-run totals. 
The Gators’ 
dominant perfor-
mances even sur-
prised Walton. 
“If you had 
told me we were 
going to run-rule 
Alabama two games in a row, I 
would’ve been like, ‘Yeah, right. There’s no way. They’re too good of a team for that to happen,’” he 
said. “You’ve got to give our kids 
credit. I thought they came out 
and executed.”UF mercy-rules ’Bama twice
snaps and jet sweeps.
While incoming freshman Andre Debose has 
been dubbed the next Harvin because he has a 
similar skill set, it’s unlikely Debose will be able to fill his predecessor’s shoes right away.
“You can’t replace a player like Percy Harvin,” 
Nelson said. “It’ll take three or four of us to fill in the production him and Murph had.”
Debose, Thompson and running backs Jeff 
Demps and Chris Rainey are all candidates to pick up Harvin’s rushing duties, but the lineup at receiver is much less defined.
Nelson, Thompson and Justin Williams — who 
played safety last season — began spring practice 
as the first teamers with Carl Moore subbing in.But redshirt freshmen T.J. Lawrence, Omarius 
Hines and Frankie Hammond are knocking on 
the door for playing time, and Cooper (currently with the baseball team) and Debose will join the Gators in the summer, meaning the battle for 
playing time will be wide open.
Wide receivers coach Billy Gonzales said he 
will shuffle the lineups frequently to give each 
player a chance to impress, and if there’s one thing he knows, it’s that his players have a desire to stand out.
“I stood in a group with them and said, ‘If you 
have achieved everything you wanted to here at the University of Florida so far, raise your hand,’” 
Gonzales said. 
No hands hit the sky.
“I’m excited about the whole group,” Gonza-
les said. “No one is proven right now.”Harvin’s absence leaves hole in offense SOFT , from page 13

Junior swimmer Shaune Fraser 
ended the season strong.
After Fraser won individual na-
tional titles in the 200-yard freestyle 
and the 200-yard butterfly, the UF 
men’s swimming and diving team 
rallied behind him to secure a fifth-place finish in the NCAA Champi-onships over the weekend.
“I didn’t do as well in the Olym-
pics,” Fraser said. “So I wanted to show everyone what I can do at NCAAs.”
And he did just that. Coach 
Gregg Troy said Fraser’s 200 fly was one of the best he had witnessed.
Senior Bradley Ally was also 
a standout during the three-day competition, starting off with an ex-ceptional swim on the first day to win a national title in the 200-yard individual medley. 
Fraser also had a career-best time 
in the 200 free Friday.  The Gators took 33 All-American awards in-cluding honorable mentions.
No. 7 UF was in fourth place af-ter Thursday, sixth after Friday and managed to move up one spot on Saturday.
The weekend marked the 10th 
consecutive year that the men fin-ished in the top 10. 
“We did a fantastic job through-
out this whole week, with effort from every single member of the 
team.” Troy said. “We broke a 
bunch of school records, and every-one garnered All-America status. You couldn’t ask for a better end to the season.”
The Gators were on fire at the 
championships, breaking 10 UF records. But even so, Fraser knows he has greater potential. He said 
winning two titles was a great ex-
perience but the opportunities are endless.
“I can always improve after ev-
ery swim.” Fraser said. “I am going to look back at the video and cor-rect my mistakes so I’m better next time.”
Other solid performances at the 
meet included junior Clark Burckle and Omar Pinzon in the 200 breast-stroke and 200 back, respectively. Burckle finished in eighth place, breaking his own school record, and Pinzon took third in his event, breaking his career best.MONDAY, MARCH 30, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 15

The rain and wind couldn’t completely 
stop UF this weekend in Tallahassee.
The UF track and field teams faced ad-
versity from the beginning of the three-
day Florida State Relays but managed to 
finish the weekend well. 
The bad weather curtailed Thursday’s 
events and prevented UF from compet-
ing on Friday afternoon. But the weather held up Saturday, and UF took advantage 
of the opportunity to have a full, uninter-
rupted day of competition.
The teams maintained their compo-
sure after the delays and cancellations and gathered five first-place finishes and 16 to-
tal top-10 finishes on the final day.
Senior Kallinka Pitt took the first win 
of the day for UF, claiming the 110-meter 
hurdles title.
The other first-place finishers for UF 
were sophomore Terrell Wilks in the 100-meter dash, the men’s 4x400-meter relay team, the women’s 4x400 relay team and freshman Keely Medeiros in the wom-
en’s discus throw.
For Medeiros, her discus mark of 149 
feet, 1 inch is a new personal record in the 
event. 
Her previous best was 138 feet, 1 inch, 
which she set in the UCF Black and Gold Challenge last weekend in Orlando.Coach Mike Holloway was not overly 
impressed with what he saw but under-stands the weather was a big factor in what the teams were able to do and the 
events they were able to 
compete in.
“We did a good job, 
nothing spectacular by 
any means, but we got through it. We are an out-
door sport. It’s just part of what we do,” Hollo-way said. “I think it hurt, 
but in the areas where we could get some 
work done, we did.”
The weather defeated UF in one area: 
It prevented freshman Jeff Demps from making his scheduled debut. Demps was expected to compete as a member of the 
4x100-meter relay team and possibly in the 100-meter dash.
The 4x100 relay was not run during the 
three-day event, and according to Hol-loway, Demps was just not ready for the 100-meter dash.
“He was entered, but we never really 
planned for him to run,” Holloway said.
“He’s probably gonna open up later 
in the season. He’s just not ready for 100s yet.”
Instead, fans will have to wait until this 
weekend’s home meet, the Florida Relays, to see Demps in action, if weather per-mits.UF MEN’S TRACK

The No. 14 Gators women’s ten-
nis team could open a kennel the 
way it’s been taming Bulldogs in Southeastern Conference play.
UF (10-6, 4-2 SEC) bounced back 
from its 4-3 loss to Mississippi on Friday by dominating Mississippi State 6-1 on Sunday at Linder Sta-dium. The weekend came after a much-needed 12-day rest.
“We looked very rusty, I thought, 
particularly at (Court) 1 doubles at Ole Miss,” UF coach Roland Thorn-qvist said. “We were certainly dis-appointed leaving there because it 
sets us back in the SEC rankings, 
but I was proud to see how we re-sponded the next day here, playing at home.”
The Gators won all three doubles 
matches to take the doubles point. Marrit Boonstra and Jo Mather claimed their eighth consecutive win as a tandem. Boonstra was previ-
ously paired with Megan Alexander 
before Alexander went out for the season with an undisclosed injury.
“In the beginning, it was kind of 
getting used to each other, but right now we feel really comfortable,” Boonstra said.Mather, who clinched the win 
in singles against Radka Ferancova, said she loves playing with the fifth-ranked Boonstra, who is 15-0 in du-al-match singles play.
“She’s improved a lot confidence-
wise, certainly at a completely dif-ferent level than before, and Mar-rit’s strength has always been she’s a very cerebral player,” Thornqvist 
said. “She puts the balls in spots that 
are very uncomfortable for the op-posing player.”
The junior used this skill Sunday, 
easily toppling Olesya Tsigvintseva 6-1, 6-0 on Court 1. She said she still has room to improve, but agreed with Thornqvist that her confidence has definitely elevated her play.
“She moves like a cat. That’s a 
tremendous advantage,” he said.
With Alexander out, Mather has 
assumed the No. 3 position. She has proven herself up to the challenge, earning SEC Freshman of the Week honors. She took winning the award in stride.
“(Assistant coach) Dave (Balogh) 
wanted my signature,” she said. “That was good enough for me.”MEN BEAT MISSISSIPPI STATE: Af-ter dropping its first home dual match on Friday against No. 2 Mississippi, the UF men’s tennis team traveled to Starkville, Miss., to crush Mississippi State 6-1.
Freshmen Joey Burkhardt and 
Carlos Cueto turned in dominant performances. Burkhardt downed Antonio Lastre 6-1, 6-1. Cueto, the No. 24-ranked singles player, clinched the No. 7 Gators’ victory by beating Ryan Farlow 6-4, 6-1.

CHANCES TO TAKE THE LEAD.

With wind whipping and fans cheering, 
Santa Fe College (19-15, 8-4 Mid-Florida Conference) was unable to walk away with 
a victory Saturday against Lake Sumter 
Community College, falling to the Lakers 
13-10.SFC, which was on a nine-game winning 
streak, now finds itself looking down the 
path of a multiple-game losing streak. The 
Saints lost the first game of the two-day se-
ries with the Lakers in Leesburg on Friday 8-0, snapping their winning streak.
“When you drop two games in a row af-
ter winning nine straight, of course it’s very 
frustrating,” Saints coach Johnny Wiggs 
said. “I thought we had the chance to take the lead a couple of times, but we made too 
many mistakes.”Mother Nature caused difficulty for both 
SFC and LSCC on Saturday. While the ex-act speed of the wind was unknown, every-
one took note of the importance it played 
on both sides. Four home 
runs were scored between 
the two teams.
SFC starting pitcher 
Gary Merians gave up 6 runs in the second 
inning. Merians would give up seven hits and 7 runs during his 6 2/3 innings.
“Very rarely does a college pitcher re-cover from a real big inning. Generally it 
lingers and carries over into other innings,” Wiggs said. “I give Gary a lot of credit for 
keeping his head in the game.”
SFC freshman Keon Broxton, who saw 
his first at-bat during the eighth inning, 
hit the Saints’ second home run of the day. 
Broxton’s at-bat set up closer Andy Mee’s 
2-run homer that tied the game at 10.
After giving up 4 runs during his two 
innings pitched, Mee took the loss for the 
Saints.Lake Sumter snaps Santa Fe’s 9-game winning streak
