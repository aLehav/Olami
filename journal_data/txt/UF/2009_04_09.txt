Four months after Monica Toliver  
struck a scooter with her Lincoln Town 
Car into his scooter, resulting in the death 
of a UF student, the Gainesville Police De-partment issued a warrant for her arrest.
The warrant was issued Wednesday 
after results from a toxicology screening 
came back negative, Sgt. Joe Raulerson 
said. The results proved that Toliver’s er-
ratic driving was not a result of drugs or alcohol. 
On December 2, Toliver, 40, was driv-ing east on West University Avenue when she hit the side of a Gainesville Regional Utilities truck that was stopped at a traffic light, the report stated.
She continued to drive up onto the 
sidewalk and hit Michael VanWagner’s Yamaha scooter, throwing him and the scooter into the crosswalk at Northwest 17th Street.
According to the report, Toliver contin-
ued driving and hit the back of a 2001 red Dodge Ram that spun the truck onto the 
east corner of the sidewalk.
Toliver sped up and drove her car two 
more blocks before it stalled out in the left LOCAL

In summer of 2008, Kevin Reilly 
left the hatch on his 1999 Dodge 
Durango unlocked.When he returned to his vehicle, 
he found that his iPod, radar detec-tor, stereo and speakers had been stolen, worth about $600 total. It was the second time Reilly, the UF student body president, had been a victim of car burglary. He was just one of the hundreds of victims in 
2008.
“I’m vigilant about it now,” he 
said.
Sixty percent of the 1,400 bur-
glaries in Gainesville last year in-
volved cars, and many began with unlocked vehicles and rolled down 
windows, according to GPD. 
While this is on par with the na-
tional average, Audrey Mazzuca, 
a GPD crime prevention officer, is hoping to drop the number of thefts through the “Lock It or Lose It” campaign, which is meant to raise 
student awareness on the issue.
Thieves have admitted to focus-
ing on students as easy targets with 
high payout, according to Maz-zuca. ‘Lock It or Lose It’ campaign promotes locking car doorsBy THOMAS STEWART

Local feminists protesting 
what they see as a racist and 
sexist pattern in layoffs at UF 
presented the university with 
a statement signed by about 240 supporters Wednesday around noon.
Between 10 and 15 sup-
porters handed the statement 
to Jeanna Mastrodicasa, UF’s 
assistant vice president of stu-dent affairs, with the intention that it would be given to UF 
President Bernie Machen, said 
UF journalism sophomore Bethany Koch, spokeswoman 
for the group.
“Only 34 percent of full-
time faculty are women, and 
25 percent are of minority background,” the statement 
read.
“Yet 61 percent of the lay-
offs have been women, and 54 percent were people of color,” it continued.
The numbers were pro-
vided by UF’s chapter of the 
United Faculty of Florida, 
Koch said.
“Our intention was to in-
form Bernie Machen that we’re 
not going to stand for this,” Koch said.
According to 
UF records, eight faculty, seven of whom were 
women, and 66 staff were laid off as a result of the last round 
of budget cuts. Two of the fac-
ulty members, both foreign-born women, were reinstated 
last month after challenging 
their layoffs. Two other faculty were fired in their place.
Presenting the statement 
was part of a project for a community class offered by Gainesville Women’s Libera-tion called Women’s Libera-tion: Where Do I Fit In?Feminists protest

Man arrested in connection with ‘fake crack’
A Gainesville man was arrested Tuesday 
after he told police officers he was selling fake 
crack cocaine.
According to the GPD arrest report, an of-
ficer approached Louis Williams, 42, who was standing in the middle of a busy street at about 6 p.m.  Officer Brett Kikendall saw a thin stick behind William’s ear that is used to clear crack pipes.
When the officer asked if Williams had 
drugs, Williams voluntarily stated that there was a crack pipe in his pants pocket as well “fake crack,” the report stated.
Williams said that because “times are hard 
right now,” he had been cooking fake crack cocaine with baking soda and candle wax. Wil-liams’ “fake crack” was found inside a napkin in his pocket According to the report, the fake drugs were the same size and shape as that of the crack cocaine that is sold in street level transactions. Williams was charged with sale or possession with intent to sell counterfeit drugs.

Woman’s tofu license plate curdles in Colorado
DENVER (AP) — One Colo-
rado woman’s love for tofu has 
been judged X-rated by state of-
ficials.
Kelly Coffman-Lee wanted to 
tell the world about her fondness 
for bean curd by picking cer-tain letters for her SUV’s license plate.
Her suggestion for the plate: 
“ILVTOFU.”
But the Division of Motor Ve-
hicles blocked her plan because they thought the combination of letters could be interpreted as 
profane.
Says Department of Revenue 
spokesman Mark Couch: “We 
don’t allow ‘FU’ because some people could read that as street language for sex.”
Officials meet periodically to 
ensure state plates stay free of 
letters that abbreviate gang slang, drug terms or obscene phrases.
The 38-year-old Coffman-Lee 
says tofu is a staple of her fam-ily’s diet because they are vegan and that the DMV misinterpreted 
her message.tion to male. In the U.S, these 
children who have 5-alpha reductase syndrome would be called “intersex,” and are heavily scrutinized, whereas in the DR they are part of normal society. Come join us for a discussion on this topic.

Wendy’s employee Anna Harris hands a customer his order at the restaraunt’s location in the Reitz

UF and Wendy’s are break-
ing up, and it’s not on the best of 
terms.
Carl Hoover, franchisee for the 
Reitz Union Wendy’s, said he’s dis-
appointed in the way negotiations 
with Aramark, UF’s food service provider, transpired.
He said the increase in rent and 
an added utilities charge were too steep, and thought that after 14 years of good relations with UF, the university would have had more interest in keeping the chain on 
campus. 
“They just raised our rent so 
much they pushed us out of busi-
ness,” Hoover said.
Reitz Union director Eddie Dan-
iels said Wendy’s’ on-campus sales have been lagging.
“I’m not sure what’s happened 
over the last few years,” Daniels said. “Subway has grown every year and Wendy’s has been pretty flat.”
This runs counter to the ru-
mor, propagated by students and campus tour guides, that the Reitz Union Wendy’s is the busiest in the 
world.Hoover said some of his other 
Wendy’s franchises in Gainesville 
make more money than the one on campus.
He said, if anything, the Wendy’s 
at the Reitz Union has the highest rent of any Wendy’s in the world.
“There’s no one that pays as 
much,” he said. “Not even close.”
If all goes according to plan, 
Hoover will close his Wendy’s, the restaurant named for founder Dave Thomas’ daughter, Melinda “Wendy” Morse, a UF alumna, on 
May 1.
Either a Burger King or a Chee-
burger Cheeburger will replace it. 
The Burger King at Broward Din-ing Hall could become a Green Street Diner in 2012, according to UF’s food service contract. 
Meanwhile, Subway will move 
downstairs and Papa John’s Pizza could take its place. Nature’s Table might fill the other open basement 
spot, and Freshens will likely re-
main open, edging out Jamba Juice.
Pollo Tropical will replace Cap-
eesh, and Noodle Bar will become AFC Sushi.
The changes are part of a $2.3 
million Reitz Union culinary make-over. About $1.7 million will come from Aramark and about $600,000 
will be funded by UF.On c AMpuS

Internet chatter has some local organic 
farmers concerned about a food regulation 
bill moving through Congress.                  
  E-mails claiming that organic farming 
could be outlawed by the bill have been sent 
out to activists and farmers over the past 
several weeks.
The Food Safety Modernization Act of 
2009 was proposed in response to recent health issues such as the Georgia peanut but-ter scare and was introduced to the House of Representatives by Rosa DeLauro, a repre-sentative from Connecticut. It is one of sev-
eral proposed bills addressing food safety.
Locally based organization Florida Or-
ganic Growers and UF’s Center for Organic 
Agriculture have questioned the e-mails’ fiery accusations while remaining cautious about the bill’s final form. 
According to a chain e-mail, the bill is 
sponsored by Monsanto, a multinational corporation which produces genetic seeds and the herbicide Roundup, with the intent of forcing organic farmers, even backyard growers, to use chemical fertilizers and in-
secticides. The connection to Monsanto is 
drawn through DeLauro’s husband, who worked as a political strategist for the com-
pany, according to some reports. Two You-
tube videos are also linked in the e-mail.
“Buried in the bills are regulations that 
criminalize all aspects of organic farming by categorizing the practice as a source of seed 
contamination,” according to one video, a 
camera recording of a news anchor on Free Speech Internet Television.                          
But Marilyn “Mickie” Swisher, direc-
tor of UF’s Center for Organic Agriculture, has read the nearly 19,000-word bill, and couldn’t find any mention of the criminal-ization, she said.
While she is admittedly not a legal expert, 
Swisher felt comfortable saying that the bill would not affect backyard gardens and was likely less threatening to small-scale farmers than reactions suggest.
She also spoke against connecting Mon-
santo with the bill.
“We make people devils by association,” 
she said. “’I don’t like what your preacher says, so I don’t like what you say.’ It’s the 
same thing.”
According to Marty Mesh, director of 
the Gainesville-based, statewide Florida Or-
ganic Growers, the problem is broad word-ing and “one-size-fits-all legislation,” which 
could apply the same fines and regulations 
to small-scale farms as it would to corporate operations.
“A $1,500 fine could have a small effect on 
a large industrial farm, while it may threaten 
to put a small grower out of business,” he 
said.
But Mesh believes that any ill-will that 
the bill shows towards organic farmers is an accident and would be worked out if it be-
came law.Proposed organic farm

To combat the strain of unemploy-
ment, young adults are making life-
changing decisions and increasing their 
debts simultaneously, according to a 
national study released Wednesday.
“I would say young people are the 
proverbial canary in a coal mine,” said Anna Greenberg, senior vice president of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, the re-search company that conducted the study for Qvisory.
Since its launch about six months 
ago, Qvisory, a non-profit online ad-visory organization, has formed an online community aimed at helping young adults with their money, work and health concerns.
On Wednesday, the organization 
launched services to reduce financial stress on young adults, including credit counseling, an online records storage 
service and first-home ownership ad-
vice.
Greenberg said when the recession 
hit more than two years ago, financial experts should have recognized the struggles of young adults foreshad-owed the future downturn of Ameri-ca’s economy.
She said young adults are particu-
larly vulnerable to the shifting economy because they rely on part-time work and have the highest unemployment rate. The study found about 20 percent of young adults are currently unem-ployed versus only 7 percent of adults of ages 30 and older.
Along with relying heavily on cred-
it, young adults face increasing debts 
from student loans, first-home mort-gages and car loans.
“They’re basically getting by with 
plastics,” Greenberg said.
Although 71 percent said they cut 
back on expenses, 41 percent of young 
adults admitted they sometimes only pay the minimum amount on credit card bills, while nearly one-third said they have paid a bill late. Sixty-eight percent reported having the same or 
more debt than last year.
“They’re digging a hole that’s going 
to be very hard to get out of,” she said.
In addition to racking up debt, 20 
percent of those sur-
veyed said they or a family member have left college or transferred to 
a less expensive school.
Young adults are two-and-a-half 
times more likely to lose their job than older employees.
The impact on this age group has 
not gone unnoticed at UF, where about 11,200 students flocked to the univer-sity’s two-day career showcases in fall 2007 and spring 2008 combined. 
For the 2007-2008 academic year, 
the Career Resource Center reported a 24 percent increase to visits in career counseling, a 16 percent increase in em-ployer visits and a 24 percent increase in individual employment interviews.
Despite being unsure of current hir-
ing capabilities, companies still return to the career fairs, said Ja’Net Glover, assistant director of career events.
Glover said UF’s strong alumni net-
work has also brought employment opportunities to students. Still, she en-couraged students to be flexible with job opportunities and open-minded to alternatives like working for the gov-ernment or non-profit agencies.Grad job options slim

Due to increased flow from northern riv-
ers, parts of the Santa Fe River are expected 
to flood by Friday, according to the Florida 
Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commis-
sion. 
“It could stay flooded out for awhile,” 
said Karen Parker, spokeswoman for the 
commission. Areas near Hildreth and Fort White are 
at a high risk for flooding, with a 32-mile 
segment of the Santa Fe River from River Rise in O’Leno State Park west to the where it joins with the Suwannee River declared an idle-speed, no wake zone Tuesday. This requires boaters to go no faster than re-quired to maintain steerageway and head-way. 
However, Parker said boaters should try 
to stay off the river during these conditions, as currents are strong and boaters could collide with fast-moving debris.
“You could be idling along and have something slam into your boat,” she said.
Major flooding is predicted around April 
18, with the Santa Fe River near Fort White rising to about 34 feet, 10 feet above flood level. Parker said officers from the commis-sion will patrol the river to help people if they become stranded.
On Wednesday, the part of the river 
near Three Rivers Estates inched over the 19-foot flood level and is predicted to keep rising, according to a press release.LOCALParts of Santa Fe River expected to flood by Friday

The Regional Utilities Com-
mittee made a stink about con-serving toilet water at a meeting Wednesday afternoon. 
James Heaney, UF professor 
and chairman of the Department of Environmental Engineering Sciences, described how water is wasted.
Most indoor water is used by 
toilets, he said, and older toilets waste a lot. 
New toilets use about 2 to 
3 gallons of water per flush, he said, as opposed to 4 to 7 gallons used by older toilets. 
“You think toilets are unglam-
orous?” he said. “It’s the largest water user in the world.”
The committee also heard a 
presentation by Gainesville Re-gional Utilities representatives Rick Hutton and Jennifer McEl-roy, who discussed the water wasted by sprinkler systems.
Hutton suggested an irriga-
tion maintenance  incentive sys-tem where people would receive 
a rebate for hav-ing their sprin-kler systems checked for leaks 
and adjusted. 
“You pretty much have to 
get serious about conservation,” Hutton said.
Rob Brinkman, president of 
the local Sierra Club branch, pro-posed a tax on new homeown-
ers who want to install sprinkler 
systems.
“I think we ought to impose 
fees on things we want to dis-courage,” he said, “and I really think we need to discourage the use of irrigation systems.” 
Conservation measures will 
be discussed and voted on in a future meeting.Group advocates

Today’s question: Should the U.S. 
Congress pass the DREAM Act?Monday’s question: Should Rhianna have taken Chris Brown back?
135 TOTAL VOTES11% YES89% NODREAM Act will contribute to economyColumnSurf’s Up
I have very mixed feelings about SG’s proposed resolu-
tion in support of the DREAM Act.
Because SG’s resolution will never have any sub-
stantial impact on a bill being debated before the U.S. Con-gress, SG should use its time to discuss pressing campus issues for which they could have real impact.
That said, I do hope Congress will actually do some-
thing right and pass the DREAM Act this time around (Yes, the conservative columnist actually supports a “lib-eral” piece of legislation).
The bill, if passed, would give the children of illegal 
immigrants who graduate from high school the oppor-
tunity to earn citizenship if they earn a college degree or 
spend two years in the military within six years after high school.
This is one of those rare things that conservatives and 
liberals can agree is fundamentally a good idea. Immi-grants who have succeeded in our education system or served our country deserve citizenship as much as any of us who were lucky enough to be born into it.
Sadly, both major political parties have it wrong on im-
migration. The Republican Party has become the stereo-typical “closed borders” party — the party of ignorant, insensitive douches complaining about the “Mexikins” taking their “Jebs.” The Democrats, on the other hand, are 
the stereotypical “open borders” party of self-righteous, 
liberal douches who are happy to let the rest of the world come in and feast on our overly generous welfare state.
Milton Friedman was right when he said you can’t have 
immigration and the welfare state. Unfortunately, conser-
vatives take him out of context and liberals discredit him 
as a capitalist pig.  Immigration in a free society means that only people who will be better off in America by their own labor than they were in their old country will emigrate. This is distorted by welfare since many 
people will be better off in America 
whether or not they contribute to society.
Since, despite my many cries 
for it, we’re not going to abolish the welfare state anytime soon, it makes sense to have a degree of 
regulation at the lowest skill levels to keep the welfare seekers from citizenship. At the higher skill jobs, however, 
welfare is not an issue. If people want to be citizens and 
will contribute positively to our society then, by all means, let them.
Congress should immediately and unanimously pass 
a law that makes anyone holding a graduate or profes-sional degree from an American university eligible for citizenship. We have a problem now because successful immigrant professionals, such as engineers, lawyer and the like, are sent back to their home countries when their 
visas expire. No one who wants to be a citizen and helps 
our economy should ever be denied citizenship.
Citizenship denial to graduate and professional school 
graduates is the biggest travesty in immigration policy, 
but the DREAM Act is certainly a step in the right direc-
tion.
I hope the act will pass, prove successful and be the 
first step in a sensible immigration policy that will actu-ally contribute positively to our economy. And if it does, I

more. His column appears on Thursdays. Free from the risks of 
bone-crushing shark bites and devastating 
sunburns, the latest surf-ing sensation sweeping the 
world has less board and 
more couch.
According to an article on 
NYTimes.com, the phenome-non of “couch surfing” allows for world travelers to provide each other a place to crash so long as they reciprocate for someone else in the future — 
all for free. Started as a non-
profit, CouchSurfing.com seeks to bring people from across the globe together to create a better understanding of different cultures.
For example, an Ameri-
can visiting Rome might stay in a spare bedroom for two 
months, or a Chinese man 
traveling to England could potentially sleep on the floor in a flat for one night.
Not only does the com-
pany help global jet setters connect with people around the world, they also work to ensure the safety of all parties involved. Billing their safety system as a “circle of trust,” CouchSurfing.com offers us-
ers piece of mind through 
their vouching and verifica-tion system. Under their sys-tem, individuals registered on the site can be vouched for by established members and can become verified by providing detailed personal information.
The Editorial Board thinks 
coach surfing is a wonderful opportunity for anyone and everyone to see the world and meet new people. What better way to immerse one’s self in a foreign culture than staying with a local through couch surfing? For the stu-
dent unable to afford a study 
abroad program, couch surf-ing offers a non-touristy al-ternative for a fraction of the price.
Excuse us while we go 
make plans for the summer.As UF faces the daunting prospects of massive budget cuts, Alachua County’s own financial crisis has bal-looned to a projected $12 million deficit.
The lack of funds stems from new reports revealing stagnant 
property values of houses in North Central Florida projected for 
the 2009-2010 fiscal year.
Prior to the announcement made Tuesday, county commis-
sioners were already bracing for $10 million in funding cuts – a 
staggering figure in its own right.
According to an article in the Gainesville Sun, a plan has 
been drawn up focusing on potential areas of the budget in which funds could be cut back. Some of the ideas tossed around range from closing county parks to cutting back on road main-tenance, none of which interests county commissioners as they 
seek to avoid cutting back essential services. While steps have 
already been taken to slash funding, including money allotted to building projects, social service agencies and the health de-partment, these measures only account for a small portion of the $12 million deficit.
One alternative that would serve as a cure-all would be to 
increase the property tax rate — an option requiring a 4-1 vote by county commissioners.
The Editorial Board sincerely hopes that Alachua County 
can formulate a plan to remedy the county’s budget crisis with-out sacrificing quality of life for area residents. Closing down county parks would severely disrupt a sense of community fos-tered in many towns around the county.
While a property tax hike hardly constitutes a sexy solution 
to an unfortunate situation, such a response would seemingly be temporary as opposed to closing parks indefinitely.

Letters to the Editor
Video portrays misleading image
I would like to point out that us-
ing the “Harvest of Fear” video as 
the sole determinant of one’s posi-tion on genetically modified (GM) crops is to be misled. Those famil-
iar with the movie know that its 
directors resort to scare tactics and doomsday music, which attempt to simplify the complex issue of genetically modified organisms.  Surely, interviewing organizations like Green Peace (who believe agri-businesses are conspiring a world takeover of GM seed production) on 
GM foods is enough to freak out the 
average American.
While GM seed allows farmers 
to plant and harvest resilient crops without the use of pesticides, GMOs are not a quick fix to the problem of world hunger. Simply having more food does not “help everyone out.” More food on the market means that the price of food will inevitably fall, hurting farmers’ pockets. In the face of a European Union moratorium on GM crops, it is questionable whether developing nations will even benefit from GM seed. 
The safety of GMOs is another 
tenuous issue. Criticism of the lack of systemization of the food safety 
framework, “substantial equiva-
lence,” due to the absence of uni-form animal models and feeding patterns, calls into question research conclusions.
The “hardest part” about GMOs 
thus lies in determining what GMOs will do to the food system as a whole in the developing and developed 
world, how it will be used and who 
will have access to the technology and the ethical considerations and consequences of adoption.

Women who abort deserve rights
Kate Cardinale is right about one 
thing. Abortions are extremely com-mon in the United States. 
They happen more often than 
tonsillectomies or wisdom teeth re-
movals, and more than one out of 
three women will have an abortion by the time she reaches the age of 45. It is people like Cardinale, how-ever, who force women to keep their medical procedures a secret, pre-venting society from realizing how common the procedure is and how many women have been affected by 
it. The women who have abortions 
are not some group “over there.” They are your mothers, your sisters and your friends.   
If “pro-life” activists were truly 
concerned about women, they would stop intimidating women as they go into doctors’ offices and immediately start advocating for comprehensive sex education and improved access to birth control. That is what will reduce the num-ber of unintended pregnancies, not displays aimed at shaming millions of women for taking advantage of a safe, legal medical procedure.

Protesters must pool ideas
A recent survery showed that 
President Bernie Machen has the eighth highest salary of all public-school executives. While Machen has been doing the admirable thing 
with the budget cuts (he raised em-
ployees salaries by an average of 2 percent and denied himself a raise), there is more that should be done. 
Tuesday’s rally really reflects 
a problem with how we react to a crisis. I stood alongside 500 other protestors, signed a petition and chanted, “No more cuts,” but we are still missing the big picture.
The way we need to attack this 
problem is with solutions. As a whole, we can complain and com-plain as much as we want, but if the Florida Legislature has no more 
ideas it will just become a circular 
problem.
It would be nice to see a 500-per-
son brainstorm session on how to fix the budget cuts. Why didn’t we protest against Hough Hall, which is currently being built in the midst of the cuts?  While I am not suggesting that we cut faculty members like we 
are already doing, I am just saying 
that everyone can complain about something. Instead, let’s make a move toward change.

I disagree with Tommy Maple’s column 
that addresses how the increased tax on cigarettes is wrong. 
According to the American Cancer Soci-
ety, 440,000 people in the United States die every year from cigarette-related deaths and many more suffer from cardiovascu-
lar complications due to their habits. These 
health problems caused by cigarette smok-ing serve only to place a huge burden on the state’s health care system. During times of economic recession, it makes sense to 
tax those who choose to buy cigarettes, as 
they are the ones who may need to utilize the state’s health care system once their to-bacco habit begins to cause serious health problems. Why should nonsmokers pay for the health problems of those who make the 
conscious decision to light up?
However, I do applaud Maple for raising 
awareness about the excessive taxes levied 
on cigars, wraps and rolling papers that 
aim to unfairly tax marijuana smokers. 
Taxation without legalization is cer-
tainly wrong and the government could 
easily generate tax revenue if the state de-criminalized marijuana and allowed the 
passage of medical marijuana laws. Unlike 
cigarettes, no one has been able to prove that marijuana use leads to death, cancer or any other malady as-sociated with tobacco smoke. In fact, mari-
juana has been shown 
to kill cancer cells and 
prevent Alzheimer’s disease.
Additionally, although Maple claims 
that “organizing smokers to do anything other than listen to music or play video games is a Herculean task,” he should be informed that Gainesville’s chapter of People United for Medical Marijuana was 
organized solely by UF student smokers 
and non-smokers who hold strong political beliefs about our state’s current drug poli-cies and wish to see them changed. Many of these students are currently volunteer-ing to collect signatures on a petition in 
hopes that Florida will vote to allow medi-
cal marijuana in our state. Clearly, these hardworking students demonstrate that people who support marijuana reform are 
not lazy, apathetic stoners who care only 
about eating Funyuns.
But rather, they are responsible young 
adults who wish to change the oppressive and archaic laws that demonize nonviolent 
marijuana smokers.

High fashion from around the 
world will be presented at the One 
Night Only fashion show on Fri-day.
Volunteers for International 
Student Affairs, also known as VISA, an umbrella organization managing more than 20 interna-
tional student organizations at UF, will host the show.
It will take place in the Reitz 
Union Grand Ballroom at 7 p.m.
The show is free and open to 
the public.
Rohe Mascharak, a UF English 
senior and director of the show, 
said this year’s event will take the audience around the world with fashion from Latin America, the 
Caribbean, Africa, Europe, Asia 
and finally “the one and only” Los Angeles.Eva Mejicanos, a UF sopho-
more and assis-tant director of 
the show, said she is expecting about 400 people to attend.
There are 
about 30 mod-els for the show, 
from various or-
ganizations such as Russian Club, 
Arabic Cultural Association, In-dian Student Association, Greek 
American Students Association, 
Black Student Union, Club Creole and Hispanic Student Associa-tion.
The models will showcase the 
traditional and modern daytime clothing of the specific regions. The final scene will feature the cultures coming together in an upscale Los 
Angeles nightclub.
“The U.S. is a melting pot,” she 
said. “It brings people from all around the world together.”
For more than 30 years, VISA 
has celebrated International 
Month between mid-March and mid-April, Mascharak said. The month includes various events such as a pageant, global potluck, fashion show and talent show.
“The fashion show and all of 
our events during International 
Month aim to share a simple mes-
sage,” she said. “Embrace diver-sity or celebrate differences.”

� 30 DOGS WERE TESTED.
By JESSICA WHEELEY
Alligator Contributing Writer
A recent study suggests dogs may not 
be chasing their tails for the thrill of the 
catch but  as a result of high cholesterol 
that could lead to more serious diseases. 
A research team of veterinary medi-
cine at Uludag University in Bursa, Tur-key, found that dogs with a compulsive 
tail-chasing habit also had a high level of 
cholesterol, according to an article in the “Journal of Small Animal Practice.” 
A total of 30 dogs were tested; half had 
the obsessive habit and tested with signifi-cantly higher cholesterol than those that did not engage in the behavior.
Dr. Clint Greene, a veterinarian at Haile Plantation Animal Clinic, said he could see how the connection was made. He said the reason for the behavior may be blockage 
in arteries of cell membranes, which affect 
the flow of brain hormones responsible for mood and actions.
Elevated cholesterol levels are genetic 
in certain breeds, he said. But dogs that have diets high in fat and meat are prone to higher cholesterol.
Hypothyroidism and Cushing’s syn-
drome are two diseases associated with 
high cholesterol. Typically, both diseases 
show up in middle-aged dogs and the treatments are a life-long commitment. 
Some symptoms of these diseases are 
hair loss, cold intolerance and sleepiness, Greene said. These add stress to the dog both mentally and physically, and tail chasing is a sign of irritability.Cushing’s syndrome is a condition in 
which the body produces excess cortisol, a hormone that plays a major role in metab-
olism and response to stress. It can cause 
abnormalities such as diabetes, congestive heart failure and enlargement of the ab-dominal organs, Greene said. 
Typically, veterinarians start testing for 
abnormalities when dogs are around 7 or 8 years old, he said. When the dogs are younger, high 
cholesterol is usually a temporary effect after a meal. 
 Dogs don’t get cardiac diseases or heart 
attacks from high cholesterol like humans 
do, he said, so it’s less likely for the owner 
to set up an appointment specifically to check their dog’s cholesterol. 
“It’s a signal for a greater problem,” he said.
Julie Levy, a professor at Maddie’s 
Shelter Medicine Program at UF, said com-
pulsive tail chasing is initially viewed as a 
response to an environment, such as dogs who live in crowded kennels.
It also can be a response to an to an un-
happy or unstable situation.
But Levy can see where there would be 
a connection. She said she’s never heard of a study like this before, but is very inter-ested to learn more about it. 
She said elevated cholesterol will cause 
a hormonal imbalance which can lead to behavior changes. The important thing is to be aware of the dog’s behaviors and 
take notice if there are any changes.
“Providing the dog with a more en-
riched environment is essential to the 
dog’s health and happiness,” Levy said.Dogs may chase tails due to higher cholesterol levelsMascharak

She also told officers that the reason she hit the

Luis Velasco Jr. is an 18-year-
old freshman at UF. He is studying 
English. And he is gay.
After growing up in a strict fam-
ily and attending a Catholic school 
in Ft. Lauderdale, Velasco said he 
didn’t want to hide his identity any-
more.
Velasco is one the many students 
at UF who experienced an accept-
ing and supportive environment 
when they left their hometown and 
stepped onto campus.
The month of April is Pride Awareness Month and is run by a committee within the Pride Student 
Union.
Evan Lauteria, vice president of 
education for the union, said this ef-
fort is about bringing awareness and 
education to the UF community.
Coming out is not always easy, 
but there is always someone here to 
talk to, Velasco said.
“Back home, I felt I could never 
be as open about myself,” he said.
At 14, Velasco told his parents he 
was gay. They were not accepting.
His parents will not welcome 
him back into their home if he con-tinues to live as an openly gay per-son, but he said being part of the LGBT community lets him know he does have a family.
“This is a part of me,” he said. “I 
don’t want to hide it.”
Many students like Velasco find 
comfort in attending the month’s 
events and talking to other stu-
dents who have experienced similar 
struggles. But the issues surrounding their 
lives don’t disappear after April, Lauteria said. 
“There should always be discus-
sions about combating homophobia 
and creating acceptance on cam-
pus,” he said. 
Velasco said UF is already a 
more accepting environment than 
he was used to, but he does expe-
rience times when he feels like an 
outcast.
Walking to class one day, he 
made his way through Turlington Plaza when he was bothered by 
protesters, he said.
“There were these super reli-gious people who were condemn-
ing everybody,” he said. “That day 
I was really outraged.”
When it comes to opposition, Ve-
lasco advises students to find some-
body to talk to who supports them 
and not to take it too seriously.
Pride Awareness Month will 
end with closing ceremonies on 
April 20. 
In the weeks that remain, so-
cials, forums and performances will be sponsored by the Pride Student 
Union, Multicultural and Diversity 
Affairs, Greek Pride and several

� CONCERTS TO BE HELD EVERY 
FRIDAY FROM MAY TO OCTOBER.
By emILY FuGGett A

Downtown Gainesville will be a melt-
ing pot of musical styles for the next six 
months.
Every Friday from May to October, the 
Bo Diddley Community Plaza,  on the cor-
ner of Southeast First Street and West Uni-
versity Avenue, will host a different local 
band each week as part of the 2009 Let’s Go Downtown “Free Fridays” Plaza Series.
This year’s free shows, which run from 
8 p.m. to 10 p.m., will feature 30 bands, with genres ranging from blues to “cosmic 
Americana.” 
The showcase will kick off May 1 with 
the 6th Street Rhythm & Blues Review, a 
mix of blues, old-school R&B and jazz.
Guitarist Bill Barnard said his band has 
played the event for a few years, and the 
tight-knit atmosphere of Gainesville makes it fun.
“It’s downtown, it’s outside. It’s a good 
place for people to come hear music,” he said.
On June 5, the concert will be a Bo Diddley Tribute. Diddley, the rock icon and 
Archer resident for whom the venue was 
renamed after his death, will be honored by 
the community while members of his family 
and band perform. 
“We’re going to 
change the sign, a mural 
will be unveiled, there 
will be a proclamation,” 
said David Ballard, 
events coordinator for Gainesville’s Divi-
sion of Cultural Affairs.
Ballard said another highlight will be a 
performance by Black Violin, a two-person hip-hop violin group who competed on the show “America’s Got Talent.” “We’re very excited about them,” he 
said. “They gave us a good break because they’re from Florida and they like to play 
here.”
The city will pay each performer $400-
$500, which varies based on the band.
Last year, between 300 and 700 people 
attended the concerts per night — about 
10,000 total.
Ballard expects an even better turnout 
this year, as people under financial stress take advantage of free entertainment. 
“Kids play. People bring their lawn chairs 
and blankets. Some bring picnics. Others go out to eat downtown,” he said. “It’s some-thing people could do every week.”Concert series to offer free shows from May to October
 Commonly stolen items include 
MP3 players, GPS systems, lap-
tops, cell phones, purses and loose change.
“When people leave their loose 
change in plain view it gives thieves a reason to explore,” she said. Re-cently, a thief stole only $3 in loose change from a vehicle.
GPD spokesman Keith Kameg 
believes that there is a connec-tion between the poor economy, drug use and the increase of stolen change, he said.
“Most auto burglaries are the 
bottom-feeders of our criminals,” he said.GPD makes several recommen-
dations to prevent theft beyond making sure to lock doors and roll up windows.
Park in well-lit areas, away 
from shrubbery, and don’t park a small vehicle between two larger 
ones. Detachable stereo face plates 
should be removed and stored in a secure place.“Loud stereos advertise your 
sound system to criminals,” she said.
Those who use a sunshade 
should not back into parking spac-es; it hides thieves from passers-by.
Mazzuca warns that burglars 
operate at all hours. “They are crimes of opportunity, during day-time or nighttime criminals will take advantage of it,” she said.
Mazzuca has been coordinating 
the campaign with local media and businesses, but not everyone is co-operative.
“The apartment complexes want 
to create the illusion that every-thing is fine, when they are not,” she said.
Sixty percent of the 1,400 burglaries in Gainesville last year involved cars

Pack your suitcase with enough clothes to last you a week, give or take a 
day or two. Destination? Wherever the back roads take you. Summertime 
is road trip season, but before you hit the highway, make sure you abide 
by these tips — and the speed limit.
1) Be selective. It’s going to be a long ride, so you’ll want good company. This 
isn’t the right time to invite that girl who you only kind-of-sort-of tolerate, or 
that friend whose bladder capacity is that of a 3 year old.
2) Rest stops get old, and while stopping at random diners in in-between-
civilization towns is a delightful little culture shock at first, you’ll eventually 
want food faster than any given drive-thru establishment can provide. Load 
up your cooler with your favorite goodies and beverages. Stick to foods high 
in protein, like trail mix.
3) Nothing fits the open road better than good tunes. Be it classic rock or 
underground hip-hop, make your soundtrack to the scenic route something 
you can sing along to. Loudly.
 4) Whoever said getting lost was part of the fun probably had a GPS. You 
can be spontaneous without having to ask directions from the old, toothless 
man at the abandoned gas station in the boonies.

the A - LISTThursday
April 9, 2009Danger is sexy when 
you’re in college. It’s a short 
time in your life when you can get away with making bad decisions. And nothing’s 
more of a turn-on than know-
ing something can go wrong at any minute.
“Sexy” is the rogue breeze 
outside Gator City trying to lift that already-revealing skirt. It’s the fear of your roommate waking up to the squeaks of the mattress. It’s the jingle of 
the janitor’s keys as he cleans 
the bottom floor of the library, unaware of what you and your T.A. are doing behind the reference desk. 
Why look for the “right” 
person when the most appeal-ing thing about sex is how “wrong” it is?
That’s where I run into a 
wall. Besides a fatalist person-ality and a slight resemblance to that skinny, pale monster from “Pan’s Labyrinth,” there is nothing about me that com-municates danger. No tattoos or piercings. No spontaneous bursts into reckless stunts. 
I’ve never been arrested, I’ve 
never been in a fist fight, and I drive a white Altima that could easily be your mom’s. 
And she could probably 
take me in an arm-wrestling match. 
Lately I’ve tried the James 
Dean thing, but so far it 
hasn’t worked. For example, I stopped wearing undershirts 
in attempt to “open up my chest” for the ladies, but the white skin underneath made the switch unnoticed. I’ve also 
caught myself talking to girls 
like Humphrey Bogart, using words like “toots.”
Don’t call a girl “toots.” 
Just trust me.
I’ll occasionally run into 
some luck and distract a girl from one of my more “dan-gerous” friends. Throw in 
some alcohol and a slightly 
prettier girl to distract all the other guys, and I might have a chance. 
Unfortunate-
ly for the girl, I turn out to be a gig that pays by 
the hour. Sure, there’s no real 
risk, and you’ll get your mon-
ey’s worth, but there’s no pay-off either. And college girls are in the mood to gamble. 
While I try to create my 
own version of “dangerous,” I suppose I can always count on the greatest benefit of be-ing the safe guy: rebounding. 
While she’s on that walk 
of shame after a night of get-ting burned by Bond, I’ll pull up in my Altima, wearing an easy-on-the-eyes Gap sweater and tapping my foot to some Jason Mraz, and save the day. We’ll round the bases and slide into home.

with JASON ESTALA  costume designer 
Behind every great production is 
a great costume designer. After all, 
what would Sex and the City have been without Patricia Field’s stylistic talents? 
For UF’s rendition of “Pride & 
Prejudice,” M.F.A. student Jason Estala is in charge of bringing the characters’ wardrobes to life.  After only two years at UF, Estala’s skills and creativity led him to the posi-tion of head costume designer for this large-scale production.  
 
What was the most difficult part 
of designing the costumes for “Pride 
& Prejudice”?
The size of the cast. This is a huge 
show, and all the costumes had to be fitted to each person. Ninety percent of this production was built from scratch. I have spent a whole school year’s worth of time on this show. 
What has the design process 
been like?
I was assigned to do this show 
last semester. I started doing all the research and started sketching then. During winter break, we went to New York to get fabric from the Garment District. As soon as we got back to school, we started mak-ing the costumes. We document the whole process to show how we do 
things from the first patterns to the 
final details.  
What kind of research did you 
have to do?
I read the book and the play, 
because they really are two differ-ent pieces of literature. I saw all the movies and looked at a lot of cos-
tume books. I really had to break 
down each character to figure out what they would really wear. 
Tell me about the costumes for 
the show.
I was really inspired to make this 
like an English rose garden. There are a lot of pastels and florals — 
very earthy and organic. I have the 
Bennets in lighter cottony fabrics, because I feel like they don’t follow the rules. The other characters are in more structured patterns and richer fabrics — silk and taffeta — to sym-bolize wealth and rigidness.How much creative freedom do 
you have as a costume designer?
A lot more than you would think. 
It’s really about telling a story. I take 
the designer’s vision and interpret it. 
I got to play with color, fabrics and motifs. 
What is the im-
portance of cos-tumes in a show?
Especially in 
a show like this, 
it really sets the 
era and shows the 
difference in so-cial class. I tried 
to create a closet for each charac-ter, so that their clothes looked like something they would have picked out. I even have the older people in older fashions, because I imagine 
they wouldn’t be wearing the latest 
fashions. 
What is your favorite costume in 
the show?
Each one is special to me, but I re-
ally love Lady Catherine De Bourgh. She wears a regal purple-striped dress. 
How did you get into costume de -
sign?
I learned to sew when I was real-
ly young in El Paso, Texas. My mom was a seamstress, and she taught my siblings and I to sew. She said it was a skill we had to learn and with me, it just stuck. In high school, I was an actor, and I made my own costumes, that’s really how it started. At New Mexico State University, I taught 
band, and I made flags and color 
guard halftime-show costumes. 
How have your previous design 
experiences influenced what you do now?
It got me to see things not for 
what they are, but for what they could be. I have worked in base-
ments and churches with no air con-
ditioning. Sometimes all you have is what you have, and you just have to make it work. 
How does working at UF com-
pare?We are lucky to have a lot of space 
and good resources and equipment. My colleagues are amazing too. I couldn’t have done this show with-out them, really. 
What are you looking forward to 
in your career?
Learning more. I still have so 
much more to experience and see. I don’t think I will ever be satisfied. I learn every day. 
Would you consider fashion de-
sign or costume design for movies?
I would do both of those as side 
projects, but I really love the theater, because day-to-day you never know what is going to happen. Each show is different. I get to create these fan-tasy worlds and recreate history. It’s something about the storytelling that I just love. 
What is the biggest payoff?To see your vision on the stage, 
singing, dancing and walking. It’s weird because part of you just wants to say, ‘That’s mine, I did that,’ but it really is about the whole show.

For most, the start of the new 
year signaled a fresh beginning, 
but for Polaroid film it marked the end of an era. Last year Polaroid 
announced that it would stop mak-
ing instant film, and it should be phased out of stores by 2009. To many people in this digital age, Polaroids are no more than ancient 
relics, but to those in fashion, art 
and photography industries they are very much alive. 
“It is going to be bad for 
art to not have Polaroid,” said Thomas W. Southall, curator of photography at the Harn Museum of Art. “The aesthetic of the Polaroid has proved to be ir-
replaceable. Digital has the same 
instant gratification, but it’s pixi-lated.”
Many famous artists have used 
instant film over the years, includ-ing Andy Warhol and Ansel Ad-ams. Adams became a consultant for instant film’s creator Edwin H. 
Land in 1948. He helped test the 
product, and over 35 years took hundreds of instant photographs. Adams wrote thousands of letters about his findings that helped Po-
laroid develop. 
Warhol took hundreds of Pola-
roids of celebrities and anonymous 
subjects and then transferred the 
images onto silk screens. The more 
Warhol used instant film, the more he began to like the effects of Pola-roids on their own.
“Polaroid has very fine grained, 
weird beauty,” Southall said. “Each one of those snap shots is unique.”
Many artists chose Polaroids be-
cause the images could not be re-produced, which is something that cannot be said about digital prints, Southall said. Each Polaroid is as distinctive as a drawing. 
“The fact that the picture in your 
hand is the object that was exposed to the light, that is unique in its his-tory and existence,” said Douglas Whitaker, president of the UF Pho-
tography Club.
Many amateur photographers 
have fallen in love with instant film 
as well.
“I take Polaroids to capture mo-
ments,” said Susan Jane Phelan, who has been using different types of Polaroid cameras since 2000. “Each photo I have reminds me of 
a certain time in my life.”
In the fashion industry, Pola-
roids served practical purposes. 
At fashion shows they were used backstage to keep track of looks be-
fore models hit the runway. Many 
modeling agencies liked to take Polaroids to get instant feedback of how a model photographs. 
Polaroid’s announcement came 
as big shock to many.
“People were totally freaking 
out,” said Jillianne Pierce, who in-terned at Marie Claire magazine 
last summer and used Polaroids to 
catalog clothing samples that came into the fashion closet. 
“The fashion industry does not 
like change,” she said. “Change in the clothes is enough.”
Now the closets of agents, cast-
ing directors and designers are filled with just as many boxes of stockpiled Polaroid film as Prada shoe boxes. 
There are those who refuse to 
just watch instant film expire quiet-ly. One group, the Impossible Proj-ect, acquired Polaroid’s film pro-duction equipment in Enschede, 
Netherlands. They do not plan to 
recreate Polaroid film, but instead develop a new type of instant film by 2010, according to the Impos-
sible b.v. Web site.
“There are glimmers of hope,” 
said Whitaker. “I hope one of these 
projects comes to fruition.” 
Fuji will still be producing in-
stant film but as of now it will not fit into traditional Polaroid camer-as, only wider format Fuji cameras. 
Polaroid has also introduced 
a new type of digital camera, the Pogo, which they are advertising as a replacement for instant film cameras. 
“Those cameras serve a pur-
pose, but I personally don’t think they are indicative of a coming revolution in photography,” said Whitaker. 
Whitaker said digital cannot 
replicate the anticipation built when waiting for a Polaroid to de-velop. 
As stockpiles of instant film 
dwindle, each picture becomes more precious for Polaroid enthu-siasts. For now all they can do is wait for new developments. In the 
meantime, they can celebrate 60 
years of rich instant-film history in the only style appropriate—by shaking it like a Polaroid picture.

sex on the avenueRules of Attraction: when is it too soon to have sex?
Sex is a never-ending complex. It 
shouldn’t be that complicated, but it is. 
When first hooking up with some -
one, both physical and emotional attrac -
tion can let things get hot and horny too 
fast. And girls are constantly wondering, 
“When is the right time to sleep with a 
guy?”
 Sleep with him too soon and he could 
lose interest, having conquered the chal -
lenge without even lifting a finger. Wait 
too long to do the dirty deed and he’ll 
lose interest too quickly. As much as 
I hate to say it, you’ve got to play the 
game right in order to score. 
I once had a guy tell me that I’d never 
given him the chance to chase me; harsh, 
I know, but so true. Nobody likes to just 
get what they want right away; where’s 
the fun in that? You have to dangle the 
bait first. Upon making an initial connection 
with someone, sparks fly and you quickly 
fall in lust, making you both eager to rip 
off your clothes. If you do it right away, 
there will be nothing left to go after, no 
challenge, no surprises left. 
And even worse than him losing in -
terest is getting wrapped up emotion -
ally. Everyone knows girls get more 
emotionally attached than guys do after 
having sex, and unless your name is Sa -
mantha Jones, there’s not much you can 
do about it. In fact, it’s been proven that 
girls have more of the oxytocin hormone 
— also known as the cuddle hormone — 
than guys do. It’s not our fault we want 
to spoon up and snuggle after sleeping 
with you. It’s really just a part of who we 
are. 
And though you feel like you won’t 
be able to control your need to sleep with him, think about how much better 
the sex will be once you’ve made a real 
connection. If your feelings are simply 
bubbling on the surface, the sex could be 
awkward and insignificant. If you wait 
until the time is really right, then it will 
do more than satisfy your craving. 
So, how long do you wait? This is 
where it gets tricky. It 
definitely comes down 
to personal preference, 
but I say that a month 
is a decent time frame 
to work around. A 
month is certainly long 
enough for you to develop an actual rela -
tionship with someone while also letting 
you feel out whether it’s right to have sex 
with him. 
Having sex with the wrong person 
happens all too often that real, passionate 
sex doesn’t occur as much as it should. If you do your best to control that crazy 
urge, it’ll be more mind-blowing than 
you could have ever imagined.  
And if you’re afraid he’ll lose inter -
est if you don’t do it soon, then screw 
him — not literally of course — because 
if he pushes for it before you’re actually 
ready, chances are he doesn’t care about 
you half as much as he 
should. 
But be careful not 
to be a tease. If you’re 
seeing someone and 
you keep putting it off 
because it doesn’t feel 
right, then you probably shouldn’t be 
seeing him anymore. Every guy is after 
the goods; don’t make him wait around 
for nothing. 
So, girls, there you have it. Don’t hate 
the player, hate the game — but don’t be 
afraid to play it.Lil Wayne is the voice of our gen -
eration.
Not because we also started deal -
ing drugs at age 11. Not because, ev -
ery day, we drink gallon jugs of Ha -
waiian Punch mixed with a bottle 
of Robitussin from the moment we 
wake from what can only be referred 
to politely as a concubine pile. And 
not because we too need a Winn-Di -
xie grocery bag full of money, right 
now, to the VIP section.
Even if you do share these traits, 
it doesn’t matter. He’s our voice be -
cause he represents our current state 
of humanity, or as another might ar -
gue, an eternal testament to how we 
are so animalistic.
Power, sex, violence, money, drugs. Did I already say sex? Make 
no mistake, “Weezy Baby’s” content 
is not appropriate for younger audi -
ences or the easily 
offended. 
Shakespeare was 
very similar in these 
regards. Now, I can’t 
claim to have stud -
ied Shakespeare in -
tensely, but I’ve read 
some works and am 
currently going back 
to reading more -- mostly because I 
started listening to Lil Wayne.
Anyway, Shakespeare loved 
his sex and sexual puns. Take the 
scene in “Hamlet” for instance, 
when Hamlet rests his head upon Ophelia’s lap and speaks warmly 
of “country matters,” or in “Twelfth 
Night” when Malvolio, in effect, 
spells out a four-letter word, again 
referring to female anatomy. 
Then there 
is all the death 
and killing 
and power 
struggles -- 
and everyone 
knows Shake -
speare did 
drugs, which 
he alludes to in his non-dramatic 
works. 
So does this mean generations 
later, students will be studying 
Weezy F. Baby? I have a dream…
But back to our generation. Are 
we another lost one? Have consum -erism, capitalist society and Wall 
Street claimed our ambition and 
confidence forever? Have our “tra -
ditional values” been warped?
In a word, yes. We’re a genera -
tion of debauchery, superficiality 
and self-awareness. But then again, 
what generation truly wasn’t? 
Weezy isn’t so much a leader 
as he is a prime example of every -
thing the generation wants to be: 
confident, powerful, rich, sexed-up, 
drugged-out.
Mr. Carter isn’t infallible though. 
He has some sick drops, but also 
many terminally ill rhymes and 
references. Let’s just say Adam San -
dler’s movie “Click” gets a shout-
out.
It does serve as a reminder 
of Weezy’s own humanity, even though he often reminds us of his 
alienation from it, proclaiming him -
self a Martian. Outer-space-Wayne 
probably looks upon us from his fly -
ing stretch Escalade saucer -- at our 
courtesies and false smiles, at our so -
cietal protocols, at our bureaucratic 
demeanors – and laughs the laugh 
that sells millions of records, exhal -
ing THC with each chuckle.
That is why he is our voice and 
not another – because he truly be -
lieves he is not part of our world, and 
he isn’t. He’s living our generation’s 
dreams, however subconscious they 
might be.
Even if you can’t swallow my 
words, he’s at the very least a promi -
nent icon in our culture.
And if that’s too nasty, spit it 
back at me.Lil Wayne is voice of generation, represents humanity

ON TELEVISION POLL QUESTION SCOREBOARDHarrison Diamond / Alligator Staff 
UF shortstop Megan Bush rounds the bases after hitting a home run 
during the Gators’ 11-2 win against Mississippi State on Saturday.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator.org
Stephanie Brombacher was one out away from her first 
career loss. 
After giving up two home runs in as many innings, the 
undefeated sophomore pitcher had to watch from the dugout 
as her teammates — including her roommate — brought UF 
back from a 3-2 deficit against FSU.
In front of the second-largest crowd in UF softball history, 
Megan Bush stepped up to the plate with two outs in the bot-
tom of the seventh inning and tied the game at 3-3 with a solo home run off the scoreboard.
“I pretty much knew she could do it,” Brombacher said. 
“I love her. She’s my roommate. I owe her whatever she wants.”
Bush’s homer sent the game into extra innings. Two in-
nings later, Francesca Enea’s leadoff home run gave No. 1 UF (40-3, 18-1 Southeastern Conference) the 4-3 victory against No. 21 FSU (29-13) at Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium on Wednesday night.
UF has made a habit lately out of coming from behind and 
putting games away late, as Enea’s shot to left field was the team’s second walk-off home run in three games. Right field-er Kelsey Bruder hit a walk-off grand slam to beat Mississippi State on Saturday.
“We like to make things exciting,” Enea said. “We know 
that we can go out there and beat teams, but sometimes we like to go out there and mix it up.”
For the second time this week, the Gators rushed out of 
the dugout to celebrate their walk-off win by dogpiling one of Late-game home runs push UF past FSU

When quarterback Tim 
Tebow and linebacker Brandon Spikes announced they would stay at UF for their senior sea-sons, the Gators became a favor-
ite to win their third national title 
in four years.
That chance was part of what 
brought them back, and they have been talking about it all through spring practice.
“We just 
talked about getting a 
three-peat,” 
Spikes said. 
“We have the whole defense back, and you win champi-onships with 
the defense. So we have a great chance of doing it.”
Spikes’ math is a little off, as 
the 2007 season ended with a Capital One Bowl loss instead of a championship. But it’s fitting that he considers that as a lost season — an anomaly wedged between titles.
That year started much like 
the 2009 season will, with UF 
coming off a championship, but 
the team suffered. There weren’t enough leaders, and coaches say there was a sense of entitlement throughout the squad. Spikes and Tebow are determined to keep that from happening again.
“We know the standards are 
high because we’re bringing 
everybody back on defense,” 
Spikes said. “People are expect-ing us to play well, but our thing is that we can’t get complacent. We know we’re good, but we have to keep working.”
Winning another title wasn’t 
the only thing that convinced Spikes to stay. His brother, 
Breyon Middlebrooks, is serving Team set

The ball has been looking 
bigger to Preston Tucker late-
ly, and he made the ball appear 
smaller to Central Florida’s 
pitchers Tuesday.
“It looks like I’m seeing 
a beach ball coming at me,” 
Tucker said.
After a walk and a ground-
out in his first two plate appear-
ances, he started his record-set-ting night with a  grand slam to 
right, putting the Gators ahead 
5-3 in the fifth. That wasn’t enough for him, as he added a 3-run blast to left field that put the game out of reach.
And he still wasn’t done.
When Tucker walked to  the 
plate with the bases loaded in 
the seventh, he didn’t disap-point. 
This time, he sent the ball 
over the center-field fence for his second grand slam of the game. Tucker’s two grand slams marked only the third time the 
feat had been accomplished in 
the Southeastern Conference, and it was the first time it has happened since 1987.
The Gators (21-11) cruised to beat the Knights 16-3 on Tuesday night behind Tucker’s bat in McKethan Stadium.
The three-homer night is just 
the latest in a series of huge of-fensive performances from the freshman slugger.
In the last 
five games, Tucker has hit 14 for 21 with six home runs and 23 RBIs.
The recent power surge 
from the lefty first baseman has provided UF’s lineup with the pop it has been lacking all 
season.The rest of the team only 
has hit 19 home runs compared 
to his 7, and no other player has more than 30 RBIs on the season. 
The closest player behind 
him is Avery Barnes with 26 RBIs, just three more than Tucker had in the last five games and 13 fewer than Tuck-
er’s season total of 39.
Tucker also made it into 
UF’s record books with his 11 
RBIs, breaking Barnes’ single-game record of 10.
“In order to be a good team, 
you got to pitch and play de-fense, but you got to have a well-rounded lineup,” UF 
Tucker explodes with 11 RBIs on three HRsSpikes
“We know that we can go out there and beat 
teams, but sometimes we like to go out there 
and mix it up.”

ONE FIELD GOAL LAST YEAR.

mmccall@alligator.org
When UF hosts FSU on Senior 
Day in November, kicker Jona-
than Phillips will be recognized 
for playing his last game in The 
Swamp.
Again.When the 2008 season ended, 
Phillips considered his career as a Gator to be over. He had already 
spent four seasons in Gainesville, 
and he was ready to move on to 
law school.
But coach Urban Meyer had 
an idea to give Phillips one more season. He wanted Phillips to 
apply for a medical redshirt for 
2007, when he missed most of the season with an injury.
“It came up right before 
the (Southeastern Conference) Championship because Coach was thinking about it, and there was a lot of negative feedback that I wouldn’t be able to get a 
medical redshirt,” Phillips said. 
“Just after signing day, I went in and talked to some people, and I asked Coach if it would be okay 
to go for it anyway.”
When Meyer gave him the 
go-ahead, Phillips filled out the paperwork and wrote a letter 
explaining the circumstances of his injury. He wasn’t expecting much, but during spring break, 
Phillips got some surprising news 
in a call from Meyer.
He had been granted a red-
shirt and will be eligible to help the Gators defend their national 
title.
“Last year went so well that I 
figured, ‘Why not do it again?’” 
said Phillips, who’s currently 
working toward a master’s de-
gree in real estate.
Phillips was 12 of 13 on field 
goal attempts last season and connected on 78 of 79 extra points 
— the lone miss being a blocked 
PAT that proved to be the differ-ence in a 31-30 loss to Mississippi. His solid performance made him 
a semifinalist for the Lou Groza 
Award, given to the nation’s best place-kicker.
But 2009 won’t just be a ca-
sual stroll down memory lane for 
Phillips. UF lost experienced long 
snapper James Smith and holder Butch Rowley to graduation, two essential parts of Phillips’ field 
goal operation.
“This year, the biggest chal-
lenge will be the whole field goal 
unit,” Phillips said. “Last year, I had James Smith and Butch, who 
had been snapping and holding 
for three or four years. Now we have two new guys, so we have to work on that. Butchie and Smitty made everything easy on me, but now I have to get used to 
the new guys.”
John Fairbanks (field goals) 
and Mike Williamson (punts) will take over the snapping du-ties, while punter Chas Henry 
and receiver Cade Holliday are vying for the holder spot.
And Phillips is still working 
his way back into playing shape. 
After last season, he said he 
wasn’t kicking as regularly as he usually would, and he was a little rusty when he started up again.
His goal for this season is to 
become a go-to player in close games. Last year, he only at-tempted two field goals of 40 yards or longer, hitting from 40 
and missing from 42.
“A lot of times people assume 
I can’t kick that far because I haven’t in a game,” Phillips said. “On a good day, I can hit a ball 
from 60 yards-plus, but once you get back that far, it’s just a consis-tency issue. 
“I’m confident that if an op-
portunity ever presents itself when we really need it that we’ll take that chance.”22, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, APRIL 9, 2009

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
NEW YORK  — The recession has hit base-
ball salaries.
Teams cut payrolls for their active rosters 
and disabled lists by $47 million from opening 
day in 2008 to the first day of this season. That 
comes out to a drop of 1.7 percent.
“Clubs were cautious all winter with re-
gards to the economy and were concerned the 
economy might have an impact on club rev-enue,” said Bob DuPuy, baseball’s chief oper-ating officer. “The spending reflected that for many clubs.”
The drop is the first since 2004 and just the 
second since the 1994-95 strike.
Looking at payroll team by team, 16 of 
the 30 major league clubs cut payroll. Among those who lowered spending — the mighty New York Yankees.
While the Yankees led the major leagues 
with a $201.4-million payroll, they trimmed salaries by $7.6 million from the start of last season. 
The difference is that while they added 
high-priced free agents C.C. Sabathia, A.J. Burnett and Mark Teixeira, they also let Jason Giambi, Bobby Abreu and Carl Pavano leave, 
watched Mike Mussina re-tire and more than halved pitcher Andy Pettitte’s guaranteed pay.
Others cut more, led 
by San Diego ($30.9 mil-lion), the Chicago White 
Sox ($25.1 million), Detroit ($23.6 million) and Seattle 
($19.1 million).
The 14 teams that increased salaries were led by American League champion Tampa 
Bay ($19.5 million), the Chicago Cubs ($16.5 
million), Florida ($15.0 million) and World Se-
ries champion Philadelphia ($14.7 million).
“The company would have had every right 
to reduce the payroll until the new owner came,” said Cubs general manager Jim Hen-dry, whose team is in the process of being sold.
And while the 10 highest spenders lowered 
payroll by an average of $7.8 million, the 10 
lowest raised spending by an average of $4.5 
million.MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALLTough times impact baseball’s opening-day salaries
DuPuy
coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “To 
be able to hit the ball out, you feel like you can come back from 
a 3-run deficit with one swing of 
the bat.”
To keep his hot bat going, 
O’Sullivan plans to motivate 
Tucker by pushing him in prac-
tice and in his books.
“We’ll keep ribbing at him a 
bit to make sure he stays ground-
ed, and I’ll make sure to get on 
him about his study-hall hours,” O’Sullivan said.
Tucker’s onslaught allowed O’Sullivan to give some lesser-used pitchers a chance to throw. O’Sullivan got to see Kevin Chap-
man, Will Jolin, Lee Reumann and 
Chas Spottswood on the mound.
The four relievers had com-
bined for only 15 appearances 
before Tuesday, and it was the 
first appearance for Reumann, a walk-on freshman.
The innings thrown by the 
rarely used pitchers filled the in-
nings usually taken up by Tony 
Davis and Billy Bullock, allowing them to get rest heading into UF’s weekend series at Auburn.
O’Sullivan did use Anthony 
DeSclafani (3-1, 3.49 ERA), who is often called upon late in games, for 2 1/3 innings to get the win.
“I think (DeSclafani) is a key to 
our staff right now,” O’Sullivan said. 
“He’s started, (and) he’s come 
out of the pen. I feel confident 
pitching him at the start of the 
game, the end of the game or in middle relief.”THURSDAY, APRIL 9, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 23

PLAY FOUR POSITIONS.

Alligator Writer
In the early race for the top 2010 re-
cruiting class, the Gators increased their 
lead Tuesday with the oral commitment of 
Gideon Ajagbe.
Ajagbe, an athlete from Coconut Grove 
Ransom Everglades High, is UF’s ninth commit, putting the school ahead of South-
eastern Conference rivals Alabama and 
LSU, which have seven and six recruits, respectively. 
Ajagbe is also the seventh player in UF’s 
class on the Rivals250, an early ranking of the nation’s best juniors on the recruiting Web site Rivals.com.
Ajagbe waited until he received his ACT test results, which he described as “well above the requirement,” to commit. 
The Gators offered him a scholarship 
last summer before his team started two-
a-days.
Ajagbe plays running back, linebacker, 
safety and special teams for Ransom Ever-
glades, a team with only 23 players.
“I’ve learned to play every position be-
cause of the lack of numbers,” he said.
UF assistant coach Vance Bedford, who 
recruited Ajagbe, told the prospect UF wants him to play defense.
“I’m being recruited as a linebacker, 
mostly outside. I don’t have an inside linebacker’s body. I actually don’t have an 
outside linebacker’s body, but hopefully 
I’ll get there,” the 197-pounder said.
The UF coaches want to put weight on 
Ajagbe without sacrificing his speed. He runs a 4.6-second 40-yard dash and com-
petes in the 100-, 200- and 400-meter dash-
es for Ransom Everglades.
He said his track schedule, coupled 
with the five-hour drive between his Mi-
ami home and Gainesville, makes it diffi-
cult to attend UF spring practices, but he hopes to visit campus soon.
“I want to come to the spring game, 
then come this summer to Friday Night 
Lights. I also want to talk to an academic 
adviser,” he said.
Ajagbe showed why college coaches recruit him as a linebacker during a game against Coral Shores his sophomore year. Ransom Everglades was kicking off and the return man broke three tackles before 
encountering Ajagbe at the 30-yard line. 
Ajagbe’s hit gave the kick returner whip-lash, leaving him lying in a crumpled heap on the sideline.
Ajagbe has offers from FSU, South 
Florida, North Carolina and Boston Col-lege, but he feels UF is the best team in the nation and liked the way the coaches re-cruited him.
“None of (the UF coaches) pressured 
me. That was also a big factor,” he said. “They let me know they’re there, and they wanted me to be a Gator, but it was ulti-mately my decision.”
Oral commitments are non-binding until a 
national letter-of-intent is signed on National 
Signing Day on Feb. 3, 2010.Gators get versatile Ajagbe to orally commit for 2010
a life sentence for a first-degree murder convic-
tion, and using a pro contract to hire a lawyer for an appeal has always been a priority for Spikes.
But Middlebrooks took a load off Spikes’ 
shoulders when he was making his decision.
“I spoke with him when I was going through 
the process, and he just told me to follow my heart,” Spikes said. “He didn’t want me to make any decisions on his behalf or on what he did in the past. I felt like coming back would benefit me more.”
With their decisions behind them, Spikes and 
Tebow can get back to the task at UF. 
According to Tebow, the key is to keep a nar-
row focus on the Southeastern Conference. 
“The SEC is our No. 1 goal,” Tebow said. 
“It’s our conference, and it’s what we want to win. It’s what we take the most pride in because we feel it’s a great conference, one of the best in the country. If we win that, we think we deserve 
to be in a big game.”
MEYER BREATHES SIGH OF RELIEF:  After 
Monday’s practice, coach Urban Meyer had a tough time getting to sleep.
“We left practice, and I had to take an Am-
bien that night because (defensive end Justin 
Trattou) went down, (tight end Desmond Parks) went down and (offensive lineman) James Wil-son went down, all the same day,” Meyer said.
But after examining all three, Meyer said 
none of the injuries were serious, and Trattou 
(shoulder) and Wilson (foot) may be able to re-
turn before the end of spring practice. 
Parks will miss the rest of spring practice 
with a dislocated kneecap, a much better diag-nosis than Meyer expected, as Parks was carted off the field Monday.Injuries not as severe as Meyer first thought
NOTES , from page 21 their power hitters at home plate.
“When I was running around the 
bases, I was like, ‘I hope they dogpile 
me. I’ve never been in one,’” Enea said. “Then I saw Kristina (Hilberth) 
bounding toward me, hands in the 
air ready to tackle me, and I was like, ‘Do it!’”
UF coach Tim Walton brought in 
senior pitcher Stacey Nelson (24-3, 0.47 ERA) during the eighth inning to relieve Brombacher, and Nelson gave up just one hit while striking out three batters.
Brombacher got the start against 
the Seminoles and pitched 7 1/3 in-nings, giving up 3 runs on seven hits while striking out seven batters. 
Brombacher gave up two home 
runs — matching her total this sea-son — to allow FSU to climb back into the game after UF took a 2-0 lead into the sixth inning.
“It’s one of the biggest games 
she’s ever pitched in,” UF coach Tim 
Walton said. “I need her to get in that 
atmosphere. I wanted Stephanie to go the distance. For her first big, big, 
big start, I thought she pitched really well ear-ly and just didn’t close it out.” 
The Gators jumped 
out to an early lead 
against the Seminoles, 
scoring a run in the first and adding 
another in the third inning, when center fielder Michelle Moultrie stole second base, thought she had been called out and began walking toward the dugout before realizing she was safe.
Moultrie then had no choice but 
to run to third and ended up scor-
ing when Seminoles second baseman 
Kristie McConn overthrew third baseman Michelle Snyder.Nelson gets victory in relief

MIAMI — Even to Dan Uggla, 
the Florida Marlins’ numbers are a 
bit surprising.
Uggla hit a tiebreaking 3-run 
double, Chris Volstad was almost 
flawless after a shaky first inning 
and the Marlins beat the Washing-ton Nationals 6-4 on Wednesday to complete an opening three-game sweep.
Florida scored 26 runs in the se-
ries, and the Marlins’ starters went 3-0 with a 3.06 ERA.
“Everyone in this division, this 
league knows the kind of hitters that we have in this clubhouse,” Uggla said. “Are we going to score 8-10 runs a game? Odds are, no. ... But we’ve got guys up and down the lineup that can swing the bats.”
John Baker added a pair of run-
scoring singles for the Marlins, 3-0 for only the second time. The other 
was in 1997, when Florida won the 
first of its two World Series titles.
Volstad (1-0) struck out a career-
high seven, allowing 2 runs — one earned — and two hits in five in-nings. Emilio Bonifacio went 2 for 4, lowering his average to .571, with 2 runs and his fourth steal for the Mar-lins, who hit .313 with 14 extra-base 
hits in the series.
“It’s a tough pace to continue,” 
Florida manager Fredi Gonzalez 
said. “Good pitching will beat good hitting anytime, and we’re going to run into some tough pitchers who’ll shut the offense down. But we’ll keep riding it for right now.”
Matt Lindstrom issued a bases-
loaded, one-out walk to Adam Dunn in what became a 32-pitch ninth be-fore hanging on to convert his first save chance of the season. He struck out Josh Willingham for the second 
out, then got Austin Kearns to line 
out — on a nifty sprawling grab by left fielder Brett Carroll — to end it.
“Two feet either side would have 
tied it or we would have taken the lead,” Nationals manager Manny Acta said. “We had the right people and we had good at-bats.”
Volstad walked four Nationals,  
and four Marlins relievers combined to walk six more. The Marlins are now 9-32 all-time when allowing 10 or more walks.
“It’s very frustrating,” Dunn 
said. “We had our chances to win this game, and we let them slip.”
Uggla’s well-placed fifth-inning 
liner off Daniel Cabrera (0-1) put 
Florida in control. Ross Gload led off 
with a single and scored on Baker’s second RBI hit of the day. Three bat-ters later, Uggla delivered to right-center, driving in Baker, Hanley Ramirez and Jorge Cantu for a 5-2 Florida lead.
Cabrera allowed 5 runs and sev-
en hits in six innings.
“I think everything was good,” 
Cabrera said, “until the fifth.”
Washington had a chance in 
the sixth against Florida’s bullpen, loading the bases with one out off Andrew Miller. From there, Kiko Calero came on and retired a pair of pinch hitters, first Ronnie Belliard by strikeout and then Josh Bard with a lazy fly.
“For me, that was the game,” 
Gonzalez said.
Florida made it 6-2 in the sev-
enth, when Ramirez’s second hit of the day brought home Bonifacio. Washington got the run back in the eighth, when Alberto Gonzalez hit a two-out single, allowing Dunn to score.
“I’m happy with the way we are 
swinging the bat,” Acta said. “We 
just got completely outpitched by 
them. They do have a very good starting rotation, and it showed.”
Volstad allowed the first two bat-
ters to reach, and both scored.
Cristian Guzman singled on the 
game’s first pitch, went to second when Elijah Dukes walked and scored after center fielder Cody Ross caught Ryan Zimmerman’s fly, then threw the ball to first in an attempt to double off Dukes. No one was at 
the bag, and the ball rolled into the 
dugout.24, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, APRIL 9, 2009
