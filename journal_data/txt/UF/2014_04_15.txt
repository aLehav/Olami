A grand jury ruled Monday that a 
Gainesville Police ofﬁ  cer lawfully shot and 
killed the man who stabbed a UF employee in March.
A group of 19 jurors found a “no true bill,” 
which means no criminal actions were taken by GPD Lt. Mike Schibuola, said State Attor-ney’s Ofﬁ  ce spokesman Darry Lloyd. 
“We believe that the grand jury’s ﬁ  ndings 
were appropriate,” Lloyd said. “Any reason-able person would have seen that.”
A UF Alert sent out March 3 informed stu-
dents, faculty and staff of the stabbing that oc-curred near Leigh Hall. 
At about 7 a.m., Michael Cravey, a 28-year-
old Gainesville resident, attacked UF staff member Clifford Preston unprovoked and stabbed him several times. When Cravey ﬂ  ed the scene in a Jeep, he sparked a police chase 
throughout the city. 
Schibuola saw Cravey hiding a hatchet in 
front of Best Buy, according to a GPD press release. 
Schibuola confronted him and Cravey ran 
with the hatchet in the air, “coming within 
feet of striking” Schibuola, according to the release. The ofﬁ  cer ﬁ  red shots that hit Cravey, 
who later died at UF Health Shands Hospital.
Police notiﬁ  ed the mother, Maureen 
Cravey, who said her son saw psychological 
counselors for grief and anxiety. The night be-
fore the stabbing, she told police, her son got up several times because he couldn’t sleep. He 
then left the house at about 6:30 a.m.
At Monday’s hearing, Chief Tony Jones and 
other ofﬁ  cers came out to support Schibuola, GPD spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias wrote in 
an email. 
Tobias said the department does not deal 
with hearings like this often. It is standard pro-
cess to take law enforcement-related fatalities to a grand jury of residents.
“We are glad that the Grand Jury was able 
to analyze all of the evidence in the case and show that Lt. Schibuola acted within the law to protect himself and potentially others,” To-
bias said. “We are glad that he can focus on his 
career again.” Jury: GPD ofﬁ  cer who shot, killed man did no wrong

An ancient Mayan civilization 
has come alive again at UF thanks 
to virtual reality technology.
With the use of an Oculus Rift 
headset, the students in one general 
anthropology course are peering 
through a window in time to the ancient township of Cerros.The headset, which resembles a 
pair of goggles attached to a small screen, transports its users into a digitally created environment. The device tracks its user’s head move-ments, shifting the screen’s view in sync. Oculus VR, the company that  
creates the headset, was purchased 
by Facebook in March. 
With the device, students have 
stood atop ceremonial pyramids in the same spots kings might have, observing pink limestone struc-tures that were reduced to ruins over time. They’ve explored homes and temples of two and a half mil-lennia ago. They’ve experienced the ancient city at its peak — before its 
population vanished.

Even when Ali Brody 
wasn’t delivering GoJoe coffee 
or Jimmy John’s subs, she wore her helmet.
But Sunday night, her 
helmet was no match for a drunken driver. The UF stu-dent sustained serious injuries after a Gainesville man struck her Sunday night. She was re-leased Monday from UF Health Shands Hospital.
Brody was riding her bicycle 
on West University Avenue at 
about 10 p.m. when 21-year-old 
Kirtley Stephen Davis slammed into her with his 2003 orange Honda Element, according to a Gainesville Police arrest report.
The report states Brody  
sustained minor injuries, but 
friends say she suffered a skull 
fracture, a compression fracture in her spine, broken ribs and bruising.
Davis did not stop after 
he hit Brody and continued south on Southwest 13th Street, where he ran into the back of another car. 
During ﬁ  eld sobriety testing 
at the scene of the second acci-dent, Davis admitted to drink-ing. He said he was going to get food from Midtown when he hit Brody, according to the report.
Police said he registered 
blood alcohol content levels  of 0.308 and 0.313, nearly four times the legal limit. He was ar-
rested on various DUI charges.
Ofﬁ  cers booked Davis into 
Alachua County Jail at almost 
3 a.m. Sunday, where he re-mained as of press time in lieu of a $95,000 bond.
Jimmy John’s employee 
Heath Harris was surprised to hear about the accident.
“Ali’s not going to be the one 
to go between trafﬁ  c and work her a** off to get the best deliv-ery times,” said the 23-year-old Santa Fe College student. “She’s careful.”
Brody has always been an 
advocate for cyclists, said Lau-ren Streifel, a 29-year-old UF third-year veterinary student.
Streifel said when she vis-
ited Brody in the hospital Mon-day afternoon, she seemed to be in good spirits but had no memory of the accident.
Streifel created a GoFundMe 
fundraising page to help Brody pay for living expenses because she won’t be able to work dur-ing her recovery.

Gainesville’s own Swamp Head 
Brewery hopped its way to a gold 
medal at the World Beer Cup last week. 
The brewery’s Smoke Signal, a 
robust smoked porter that sells for $12 per 750-milliliter bottle, won first place in the smoke beer cate-gory at the biennial competition, re-ceiving its award Friday in Denver.
The competition, often referred 
to as “the Olympics of beer,” brought judges from 31 countries to sample beer from about 1,400 brew-
eries from all over the world.
Smoke Signal was ranked first 
among 54 competitors in the smoke 
beer category, according to the World Beer Cup website. 
Brandon Nappy, Swamp Head’s 
tactical marketing manager, said beers were judged based on how true they are to the flavor category.“It was an amazing experience,” 
he said. “Literally, you’re in a room with all of the best brewers in the 
entire world.”
Although the team has returned 
from Denver, the medal hasn’t.
Nappy said they accidentally 
left it in the airport during a layover 
in Charlotte.
The brewery contacted airport 
personnel, who are shipping the medal to the brewery, he said.
The medal will join several 
other awards displayed above the bar, Nappy said. The most recent is 2014’s “Best Beer in Florida.”
“We’ve won statewide awards 
before, but this is our first interna-tionally renowned award,” assis-tant bar manager Ryan Wakeland said. 
The beer is made by burning 
wood chips under a malt of ingredi-ents and smoking the malt at room temperature, he said. 
“For a fan of dark beers, it’s a very delicious dessert beer,” Wake-land said. “Anyone that would be a fan of dark beer would definitely 
want to check it out.”
Gainesville resident Dan Riser, 
40, drank beer outside the brewery 
Monday afternoon and said Smoke Signal surprised him.
“I did not think I would like it,” 
he said, “but it was excellent.”
Riser, a frequent customer of the 
brewery, said he likes Swamp Head 
because it’s local.
“They spend a lot of time with 
their beers,” he said. TUESDAY, APRIL 15, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 3

LEAWOOD, Kan. — Wil-
liam Lewis Corporon was tak-
ing his grandson to a singing 
audition at a community cen-ter. Terri LaManno was visit-ing her mother at a nearby 
retirement complex.
It was a seemingly quiet 
spring Sunday, but neither 
Corporon, his grandson nor LaManno made it home alive. 
Their lives were cut short by 
a shooting spree that targeted 
the two Jewish facilities in the mostly affluent suburb of Kansas City known as Over-
land Park.
Investigators have not re-
vealed any motive for the at-
tack, though suspected gun-man Frazier Glenn Cross had a long history of white-supremacist activities and anti-Semitic beliefs. But Cor-poron and his grandson were Methodist, and LaManno was Catholic.
Cross, 73, has been jailed 
awaiting charges that inves-tigators said could come as early as today.
Mindy Losen said her fa-
ther, a 69-year-old physician, and her son were headed to a singing contest for high school students.
Corporon’s grandson 
waited three years for the try-outs. Dressed in a coat and tie, 14-year-old Reat Griffin Un-derwood practiced two songs before getting a kiss and “I love you” from his mom and 
leaving with the grandpa he 
knew as “Popeye.”
Losen headed to the com-
munity center to watch her son perform, but what she 
saw instead was horror: The 
two had been randomly am-
bushed, each shot in the head 
outside the Jewish Commu-nity Center of Greater Kansas 
City.
Losen said she spotted her 
father’s pickup truck with its 
doors open and her dad mo-tionless. 
At first, she thought he had 
suffered a heart attack but soon knew otherwise.
“Very quickly, I realized it 
wasn’t that, and I knew that my dad was in heaven,” she said.
Minutes later, LaManno 
was gunned down outside the Village Shalom assisted living center.
LaManno, 53, was eulo-
gized Monday as a devoted Catholic wife with two col-lege-age children. Her St. Pe-ter’s Parish described her as “a gentle and giving woman,” as did the Children’s Center for the Visually Impaired, where LaManno worked as an occupational therapist for eight years.
“She was honestly one of 
the kindest people I’ve met,” said Nicola Heskett, the cen-ter’s executive director. “She was always gracious, always full of gratitude.”Family, friends

connect his students to the ancient world in a way that textbooks never could. 
“This is the best way I can 
take them there: I can give them a portal,” Vadala said. “Everyone that comes in is just blown away by it.”  
Vadala said he taught the 
class once before but felt like there was a better way to get his students interested in the material. One day toward 
the beginning of Spring, 
Vadala turned his lecture into a Skype interview with a Voodoo priestess in Haiti. Students asked her questions about culture and religion.
With the backing of his 
faculty adviser, he said he decided to raise the bar and purchase the device. He 
wanted to see if it helped 
students learn once they re-turned from Spring Break.
But this wasn’t a shot in the dark. Vadala had digital-ly recreated Cerros previous-
ly for an exhibit in the Florida 
Museum of Natural History. 
Using a video-game en-
gine and satellite imagery, pictures and measurements from the city’s archeological site, he digitally rebuilt the town in sections.
Once he made the render-
ing compatible with the Rift, Vadala let his students sign 
up to use the device for their 
second project of the semes-ter. More than half of the class has already used the device, and others are still coming.
Students in Vadala’s class, 
like 21-year-old Rodrigo Sar-mento, came to see what the hype behind the Rift was 
about.
Sarmento, a UF microbiol-
ogy and cell science junior, 
said the experience was un-forgettable.
“Honestly, it was one of 
the coolest things I’ve done at UF,” he said. He digitally rebuilt

CORAL GABLES — An attorney who as-
sisted the NCAA during its probe of Miami 
athletics is facing charges from the Florida 
Bar, which claims a wide range of ethics vio-lations occurred during that investigation.
Maria Elena Perez could face probation, 
a public reprimand, suspension or even dis-barment. The complaint, released Monday, only asks Florida’s Supreme Court that she be “appropriately sanctioned.”
Perez, a Miami alumna, declined com-
ment when reached by The Associated Press. 
The Bar has been investigating for at 
least a year to see if, among other things, she acted unethically in taking money from the NCAA.
Perez represented Nevin Shapiro, the convicted Ponzi scheme architect and former Hurricanes booster who was at the center of 
the NCAA probe. The complaint released 
Monday said Shapiro told Perez to forward documents from the bankruptcy case to the NCAA.
Monday’s complaint detailed a number 
of alleged violations by Perez, including procedural errors she made, questions about her billing, that she failed to inform deposed witnesses about her relationship with the NCAA and that she even contacted pro-
ducers at HBO about taping depositions of 
former Miami equipment-room staffer Sean Allen and sports agent Michael Huyghue.
Records show the NCAA paid Perez at 
least $19,000, though she billed them for sig-nificantly more. Shapiro is serving a 20-year term in federal prison for masterminding a $930 million Ponzi scheme.

Stargazers who were awake early this 
morning may have noticed something a 
little off about the moon — namely, a blood-red tint.
The blood moon that was visible at about 
3 a.m. today was caused by a total lunar eclipse. Sarik Jeram, president of the UF Astronomy and Astrophysics Society, said the moon appears red during a total lunar eclipse because of the way light from the Sun reacts when it passes through Earth’s atmosphere.
“The photons from that light go through 
interactions with the gases in the atmo-sphere,” the 20-year-old UF astronomy junior said. “It basically shifts their wave-length to a longer wavelength, and that’s called reddening.”
Jeram said the eclipse could be seen any-
where on this side of the planet from about 1 to 4 a.m.Alexandrea Matthews, a science journal-
ism intern at the Alachua Astronomy Club, said this is the first total lunar eclipse visible from Gainesville since 2010. 
This lunar occurrence is especially sig-
nificant because it is the first in a “tetrad,” which is a series of four lunar eclipses that will occur during the next two years.
She said because atmospheric conditions will change throughout the next two years, the four eclipses will not look the same.
“Each total lunar eclipse will be its own 
individual shade of color, and so each one in the tetrad will be unique,” she said.
Matthews said eclipses are exciting be-
cause they are a phenomenon exclusive to Earth’s solar system. People on Earth only see eclipses because, from Earth’s view-point, the moon and the Sun appear to be the same size.
“It can’t be seen from any other planet 
in our solar system,” Matthews said. “It’s a privilege of living on planet Earth.” 
Blood moon appeared this morning for first time since ’10

Waldo Police arrested a Vermont 
man Sunday who hid marijuana in 
his underwear. 
A traffic stop revealed he had 
guns and drug paraphernalia in his car. Officers arrested 20-year-old Bradley Daniel Mahoney on con-cealed firearm, drug equipment and marijuana possession charges, ac-cording to a police report. 
At about 3 p.m., an officer pulled 
over a Chevrolet Impala for speed-ing. Mahoney was riding in the front seat. The officer smelled marijuana 
and called for back up, according to the report. 
When the offi-
cer told the driver 
he could smell the weed, the driver said he “would be honest” and 
said there were 
two guns in the 
car, according to the report. 
After conducting a search, the of-
ficer found a pistol under the arm-rest, according to the report. Officers also found a rifle, pistol ammo, two 
smoking pipes, a weed grinder, a 
suspected crack pipe, a blunt and a pill crusher in the car. 
Mahoney admitted all of the 
pipes except the crack pipe belonged 
to him, according to the report. Ma-
honey also said the pistol belonged 
to him, and he placed it under the 
armrest “for protection,” according to the report. The officer handcuffed Mahoney 
and explained at the police car he 
would be searching Mahoney, who 
then said he was hiding weed in his underwear. The officer undid the right handcuff so Mahoney could remove it — a total of 9.2 grams, ac-
cording to the report.
Officers booked Mahoney into 
the Alachua County Jail at about 
4:40 p.m., where he remained as of press time in lieu of a $10,000 bond. Man arrested in Waldo with 9.2 grams of weed in underwear

Sidney Homan’s lifelong love affair with 
theater began at age 5, and now, about 70 years 
later, he is being recognized for his scholarly 
contributions to the field.
On Wednesday, Homan, an English profes-
sor, was given UF’s Teacher-Scholar of the Year 
award. 
Born in Philadelphia to a blue-collar work-
ing family, Homan thought he’d end up being a telephone installer like his father. But his love of Shakespeare pushed him to college. He attend-ed Princeton University as an undergrad where 
he studied English. He continued studying Eng-
lish for his Ph.D., which he earned at Harvard University.  
Shortly after finishing graduate school, Ho-
man became an assistant professor at the Uni-versity of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. One night, while Homan and fellow theater-loving 
professors were wandering around, they came 
upon an abandoned railroad station. They rent-ed it out for $100 a month, called it the Depot Theater and used it to stage productions. It was then Homan said he recognized the importance 
of practicing what he teaches.
He was once involved in a production of 
“Waiting for Godot,” which toured Florida pris-ons.
“The inmates really dug it,” he said. “It was 
cutting real close to their own lives. It took them to make me realize how practical the theater can be.”
He is also a widely published author with 
works focusing on topics ranging from Shake-
speare to Hitler.
But Homan said he’d be the same person 
without the award.
“I’d still be very happy if I were working as a 
telephone installer,” he said. “It honestly blows my mind that I get paid to do this.”
Andrew Varan, a 19-year-old UF psychology

in Dance Marathon? Today’s question: Do you take daytime naps?Focus on giving — not receiving — love
Midway through April, we are enjoying the height 
of spring and the season of love. 
“April is the cruellest month,” reads one of 
the most famous lines of modern poetry. If T.S. Eliot used April as a metaphor of love, it makes sense to consider it cruel. 
After all, nothing gives equal dosages of pleasure and 
pain like love does.
Let’s take a look at one of college America’s favorite TV 
shows for some cultural insight. A quarter-way through season three’s ﬁ  nale of “Suits,” Harvey Specter’s favorite employee, Mike Ross, barges into his house to seek per-sonal, not legal, help.
The young associate going through some serious tur-
bulence with his girlfriend knows his boss is the man to turn to for guidance. Specter “excels” in balancing person-al and professional lives — namely, by taking the George Clooney route to navigate relationships.
Ross pleads with Specter for advice: “What I know is 
that you seem to have relationships, again and again, and they don’t eat you up or spit you out or seem to affect you at all ... Harvey, I’m not judging you, all right? I’m just — I just need to know what your mindset is.” 
Ever the slick lawyer, Specter escapes the role of Dr. 
Phil by suggesting Ross take the day off work.
Today, many of us ﬁ  nd ourselves reluctant to engage in 
meaningful relationships with each other — let’s not even bring up the buzzkill word “commitment” — so as to not get emotionally distraught if things don’t work out.
If we are to dig deeper into the reason why we’d rather 
not get attached to each other, we have to return to that eternal, albeit trite, concept of love. From Ovid to St. Au-gustine, the ancients have ceaselessly noted the potent and addictive feelings of love, and today, we have fallen into the trap of being more obsessed with “falling in love” than we are with “standing in love” and more concerned with being the object of others’ love than with trying to master our own expression of love for others.
If we are to explore religious 
thought, the faithful make the case that pure love only be found with the Unmoved Mover. Sim-ply sticking to human interac-tions, however, we can agree that the highest form of love is 
usually found in the mother-child relationship. So let’s take a look at that.
The mother unconditionally loves her child. As a par-
ent, she has no expectation of reciprocity.
Sure, as her boy grows up, she misses him and would 
like the occasional phone call, but in her months of preg-nancy, hours of labor and years of rearing, does the moth-er expect anything in exchange for her devotion?
As we see, love in its true sense is selﬂ  ess and does not 
need to be reciprocated. As the late novelist W. Somerset Maugham put it, it’s more important “to love rather than to be loved.” This explains why the purity of unrequited love affects us so deeply. Maugham solemnly explained, “The love that lasts the longest is the love that is never returned.”
No modern philosopher has broken down this concept 
more skillfully than Erich Fromm.
In his book “Art of Loving,” he mentions a common 
dilemma many of us face: “the confusion between the ini-tial experience of ‘falling’ in love, and the permanent state of being in love, or as we might better say, of ‘standing’ in love.” 
The failure to distinguish between the two is due to our 
infatuation with the object — in this case, some person — rather than focusing on developing the faculty and the art of loving.

state’s development 
problem
On Saturday night, an Orlando woman was mauled in her 
driveway by a black bear. In the past few days, ﬁ  ve bears have been killed by wildlife ofﬁ  cials in search of the bear 
that initiated the attack, the Orlando Sentinel reported.
This recent attack is indicative of a growing bear problem. 
ABC News reported that bear sightings in Florida have nearly doubled, though bear attacks on humans are highly unusual.
Naturally, people are quick in trying to pinpoint the reason 
for the attack and the uptick in Florida bear sightings. Many cite the end of hibernation, which prompts cranky, hungry bears to become more aggressive. However, ofﬁ  cials say bears have be-come bolder in recent years: They walk into open garages and drag bags of trash off with the ease of a stoner walking into a 7-Eleven for a taquito and a Slurpee. And, now, they’re not shy 
about attacking humans who approach them.
It would be naive to pin the blame solely on unsecured gar-
bage cans or springtime bear aggression. 
A peek into Lake Mary’s history shows that unchecked rapid 
development in the past few decades has caused the once-rural 
city to grow in size — at the expense of natural land.
According to Lake Mary’s website, the suburban “city of 
lakes” just north of Orlando is “one of the fastest growing areas in Central Florida.” (Side note: It’s also our editor’s hometown. 
Go Rams!)
Since the 1970s, Lake Mary — previously a citrus-based ag-
ricultural community — has been growing as Disney develop-
ment in Orlando pushed north. In the past few decades, the city has “experienced tremendous growth in residential develop-ment as well as an economic development center with hundreds of thousands of square feet of ofﬁ  ce, retail and industrial uses.”
The issue of Florida’s overdevelopment is one that Miami 
Herald columnist and ﬁ  ction writer Carl Hiaasen has written 
about extensively, and it’s rooted in politics, he says.
“It’s astounding how many Florida politicians are in favor 
of ‘growth management.’ Such a clean, strong-sounding, utterly 
ambiguous phrase… And so much easier than coming right out and speaking the unspeakable, which is: We’ve got too damn many people,” Hiaasen wrote, according to the American Jour-nalism Review. “Hearing all this, one might believe that our leaders ﬁ  nally have grasped the obvious fact that overdevelop-ment is ruining Florida.”
Florida has been predominantly wild, untamed land for most 
of its history. Tourism, especially in connection with Disney, has led to rapid development of areas that don’t belong to humans. They belong to wild-animal populations.
For now, the bear problem merits a Band-Aid, which is a set 
of bear-safety tips from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conserva-tion Committee, increased awareness about securing garbage cans and closing garages and instructions on how to scare bears away. But in the long run, Florida legislators need to take note and quit allowing land development at the expense of humans — and wildlife.

Listicles on this topic are circulating on 
my social media pages lately from sources we’ve all come to know and 
have love-hate relationships with: Thought Catalog, the Hufﬁ  ngton Post and BuzzFeed. They’re not about graduating seniors or cats but rather another popular college-student topic — modern dating.
Without fail, one of the top perils of mod-
ern dating listed is one of my biggest pet peeves, not just in relationships, but in life. It’s that the person who is least invested or enthu-siastic is the one who is considered “winning” or having all of the power.
This is the person who texts “hey” pur-
posely lowercase with no punctuation.
They never use exclamation points or 
emoticons because that would make it seem as if they care, and they respond to texts and Facebook messages hours or days later.And this attitude doesn’t just 
exist in the dating world; it tran-scends to everyday life. They even have descriptors like “hard to get,” “playing it cool” and “dark and mysterious.” They are the modern Mr. Darcy, and you know what? I hated that charac-ter.
I don’t have time for people 
who are aloof. It’s not as if you’re going to convince anyone that you’re less human than the rest of us or that you are so above being a homo sapien that you aren’t a runny mess when you get the ﬂ  u or that you aren’t help-less and sick when you drink too much or that you won’t have trouble walking and eating when you get old. I think people censor them-selves too much to seem a certain way, and that is not just a “modern dating” problem.I really believe the world 
would be a better place if every-one were more vulnerable be-cause vulnerability is honesty. If you’re not showing emotion and are editing yourself to ﬁ  t into some “norm” that doesn’t exist, I’m just going to become suspi-cious that you are a cyborg try-ing to blend in like in “Battlestar 
Galactica,” and I’m going to get as far away from you as possible.
Life is too short to act as if you are not in 
pain or not excited for a date or not scared of death or not tearing up over that cat video. If someone texts me, I’m not going to wait an “appropriate length” of time to seem dis-interested or too busy to respond if I’m just doing laundry and watching “Parks and Rec-reation.” I will respond within 30 seconds if I want to. Oh, the faux pas! And if I meet some-one cool in one of my classes, I’m going to tell them, “Hey, I think you’re really neat, and we should totally be friends. Let’s exchange numbers.”
I’m not going to wait around all semester 
worrying about how awkward and geeky that would be and miss out on a potential friendship. I’m not going to stop myself from complimenting someone, liking a photo or commenting on a status because I’m over-analyzing how that would make me look in a situation.
I’m quirky, and I have lots of ﬂ  aws, feel-
ings, opinions and issues, and if you pretend that you don’t, I don’t trust you. So stop try-ing to act cool; I’m not buying anything that comes with a Mr. Darcy attitude.

Modern dating, playing it cool and the Mr. Darcy mentalityColumn
If all I ever did with my life 
was watch television and 
read magazines, this is how 
I would envision my life should 
be: I should marry a white 
heterosexual man, have a few 
rambunctious children, stay at home and use my new Swiffer 
WetJet and Dyson vacuum, go 
to the gym for yoga, buy the newest beauty products, sell 
my clothes when they go out of style and eat 
Special K cereal until I have the right mea-surements.
Luckily, watching television and reading 
magazines is not all I do with my life.
There is a lack of variety in our media 
culture that has put pressure on our civilian culture to ﬁ  t to these so-called standards of living.
Although we can chalk it all up to our 
social behavior, there is something pro-grammed within us that drives us to follow 
a speciﬁ  c path. You don’t see too many or-
ganisms genetically hardwired to “do their own thing.”
We are pack animals, and so we thrive 
on camaraderie and acceptance from others. This is why we seek lifelong partners in love 
and friendship. We need acceptance. Since 
we need this nod of approval to feel good 
about ourselves, it often leads many in the 
wrong direction.
Our culture establishes something that 
we deem normal. We pick an in-trend color, a genre of music, a cool celebrity, a religion or even a sexual orientation, and we call that “normal.” We take these things and cling to 
them tightly. The closer we stay to that norm, 
the more accepted we become. Our culture is quite literally forcing us to conform. Since 
many want to be accepted by the masses, 
even if they don’t agree with these synthetic standards, they overcompensate and adopt 
all of the accepted practices.
Trends are ﬂ  eeting and meaningless. They 
depreciate almost instantly, and once they do, nobody cares about them anymore. Yes, 
we are pack animals, but that does that mean we must be a pack of Nike-North-Face-jack-et-Croakie-wearing animals? A new concept we must learn is 
that appearing the same does 
not make us the same.
That being said, it may not 
be incredibly scientiﬁ  c to say, “We are all unique snowﬂ  akes” because many of us are more 
similar than we like to believe. 
The human race is one of the most homogenous species in 
the world. That means if you line up people from Zimbabwe, Switzerland, Vietnam, Can-ada and Brazil, there would be less variation 
between them than most birds of the same 
species. All humans are 99 percent identical biologically. Our minds are all hardwired 
differently, allowing us to express ourselves 
as individuals, which manifests in our cul-ture. There is a saying in Japan, “The nail 
that sticks up gets hammered down.”
As Americans, we too have this idea that 
standing out is only asking for action against it.
Expressing yourself in any form is incred-
ibly important to your own psychological well-being. Dressing or acting like everybody 
else should not be the goal. I don’t know about you, but I get embarrassed when I’m 
wearing the same outﬁ  t as someone else. I do 
not take pride in blending in with the crowd, 
and neither should you. Appeal to your own 
personal preciosities. Being the same makes you incredibly replaceable.
There is a poem by Robert Frost in which 
he is at a fork in the road. He sees one road completely overgrown, green and desolate and the other worn and better used. He 
knows if he takes the one trodden upon and 
worn, he will get to where he needs to go. Yet he chooses to take the one less traveled 
since he wants to discover new things for 
himself.
The last line of the poem: “Two roads di-
verged in a wood, and I/I took the one less traveled by,/and that has made all the dif-ference.”

The headlines are North-
western University and unionized college 
sports, but the storyline is uni-versal and highlights an op-
portunity for us all.
Forget the fretting pundits who con-
jure up endless what-ifs. The truth is, the 
football players at Northwestern under-stand the power of collective action and the meaning of a fair deal. We’d all be bet-ter off understanding the same.
You see, one player standing alone 
against institutions as powerful as North-
western or the NCAA faces some pretty 
tough odds. But when a majority of play-ers come together, that’s a game changer. That’s how collective bargaining lifts up whole groups of people — from individu-al workplaces to the community at large.
Students and universities, in general, 
could do with more than a little lifting up. 
That’s why it’s so disappointing to hear 
university representatives echo the kinds of comments we hear from anti-worker politicians and CEOs who cajole and bully workers with lies and scare tactics. We deal with this kind of stuff every day. 
America has been playing college foot-
ball for more than 100 years, and we’ve cheered for our school teams every sea-son, but it is no longer just an extracur-
ricular activity or a booster for alumni. It’s 
big business. The truth is that the NCAA makes a lot of money from college sports, and so do universities. Both also exert con-trol over pretty much every aspect of the student-athletes’ lives, and the pressure on players to produce is at an all-time high. But that’s just it — no one has sat down to seriously address the impact of this new 
regime on the players. And that’s why the 
Northwestern players stopped waiting for someone else to come up with a solution and have stood up for themselves collec-tively.
The NCAA is a ﬁ  nancial powerhouse 
with assets of more than half a trillion dollars. The universities, too, are major institutions. They’re not pushovers. No 
one has to worry about their interests. No 
corporation or institution of that size will change easily or overnight — and the ef-fects won’t be isolated to Northwestern or football players.
Think of the era, not long ago, when 
universities outsourced ofﬁ  cial apparel to the developing world where textile companies forced workers to labor in dangerous conditions for rock-bottom wages. 
Students organized themselves and 
founded United Students Against Sweat-shops, which has built a powerful pres-ence on more than 150 campuses during the past two decades and won ground-breaking campaigns for fair labor prac-tices for the men and women who make college gear.
Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa has high-
lighted the big problem of student debt, which has topped $1 trillion. He pointed out the increasingly stratiﬁ  ed world of higher education, where a low-perform-ing, high-income high school student has an 80 percent chance of going to college, and a high-performing, low-income stu-dent has only a 20 percent chance of going college. 
That’s wrong. America’s post-second-
ary education system should be a de-fender of meritocracy, not the opposite. That’s why, earlier this year, students and organizations launched the “Higher Ed, Not Debt” campaign to tackle the issue of student loan debt in America.
The growing movement doesn’t 
stop there. When adjunct professors at 
Duquesne University were being denied 
fair beneﬁ  ts and pay, they organized in collective action. When food service work-ers at Pomona College were being treated poorly, they, too, organized in collective action.
The atrocities of sweatshops. Growing 
student debt. Low pay for adjunct profes-sors. Mistreatment of food service work-
ers. These issues needed rebalancing in 
the modern era. Certainly, most people recognize the need for a similar rebalanc-ing when it comes to the NCAA. Who better to provide that balance than the student-athletes themselves? 
What’s happening in college sports is 
another movement of people understand-ing what’s possible through collective ac-
tion, and it’s being led by the people who 
know it best; who live it and work it every day. These are the kinds of movements that give us all hope and help to lift us all.

Rabbi Berl Goldman said he re-
members when he had to host Pass-
over Seder in a tent.
But on Monday night, he held 
one of Florida’s largest public Sed-
ers at the newly built Lubavitch-
Chabad Jewish Student and Com-munity Center, located at 20201 NW Fifth Ave., for more than 560 people seated together as a family.
“We were enslaved together, and 
we were redeemed together. So Jew-ish unity and community is vital,” he said. 
Goldman said the 15-step din-ner service, which details the an-cient story of Passover, the birth of the Jewish people and their exodus 
from Egypt, parallels much of what 
happens in modern daily life.
“Each (step) represents a physi-
cal exodus of personal enslavement and a spiritual one as well,” he said.  
Ayelet Faerman, a 27-year-old UF 
alumna and Coral Springs resident, said the Seder gives Jewish locals the opportunity to have a spiritual expe-
rience during the weeklong holiday. 
She said Goldman does every-
thing it takes to make an environ-
ment kosher for Passover so others don’t have to.
“It’s more convenient for stu-dents to be able to come to one loca-tion for all their meals,” she said. 
Kosher lunches and dinners 
are available at the center all week, along with other activities made pos-sible by a $55,000 budget donated by alumni, parents and others close to the center, Goldman said.  
UF materials science and engi-
neering senior Allison Silverstone, 22, attended the Seder with her brother and several friends. She said 
the event enabled her to celebrate 
the holiday.
“Even being away (from home),” 
she said, “it’s nice to get back to your Jewish roots.”8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, APRIL 15, 2014

LAKE MARY — After a 
bear mauled a woman in the 
driveway of her suburban Florida home, dragging her about 4 feet before she es-
caped, wildlife officials said 
Monday they had killed five of the animals, who had become dangerously accustomed to humans.
It was unclear whether the 
bear that attacked Terri Frana, 45, on Saturday was one of those killed. DNA and other 
tests will be done on the five 
animals — one shot and four euthanized — in an attempt to determine that, officials said. 
Frana said the bear had her 
head in its mouth and dragged her toward a wooded area.
“She opened her jaw and 
clamped down onto my head, 
and I could just hear her teeth 
marks,” Frana told WFTV-TV.
She managed to escape 
from the bear’s jaw, and she ran inside the house, where she collapsed.
She was treated at a hospi-
tal and released.
All five bears were “highly 
habituated,” Florida Fish and Wildlife officer Greg Work-man said during a news con-ference Monday. “They had no fear of humans, making them dangerous bears,” he said. “We’re erring on the side of public safety.”
Lake Mary is an upscale 
community about halfway be-tween Orlando and Daytona Beach. Workman called the entire area in and around Lake 
Mary “prime bear country.”
“We’re going to be out 
here until we feel that the area 
is safe from these bears,” he said.
In December, a woman was 
attacked by bears while walk-ing her dogs in Longwood, about five miles from Lake Mary. She suffered facial inju-ries and was hospitalized.
Frana was afraid the bears 
were going to go after her two young children Saturday evening, her husband, Frank 
Frana, said. 
Her 10-year-old daugh-
ter and 11-year-old son had 
just left the house Saturday night when she saw five bears scurry toward the garage. She walked down the driveway to look for her children.
“One of the bears stood up, 
knocked her down and start-ed to maul her,” Frank Frana said. “She has 30 staples in her head, 10 stitches in her head, lacerations and claw marks on her back.”
Experts say this is the time 
of the year when bears leave their winter dens.After attack, officials

As spring continues, Floridians 
can expect to see more gopher tor-
toises poking their heads out.
Gopher tortoises become more 
active this time of the year to find 
mates and food, making them more 
likely to crawl on to busy roads, ac-cording to a Florida Fish and Wild-life Conservation Commission news release.
The gopher tortoise is a threat-
ened species. This means it’s on a rate of decline but not endangered yet.
Eric Suarez, a 28-year-old UF 
graduate student in wildlife ecology and conservation, said transporting gopher tortoises is illegal.
However, if a tortoise is in the 
middle of the road, people are en-couraged to help it. Suarez said he recommends putting it on the side of the road it was crawling toward.
Motorists should keep an eye out 
for baby tortoises as more adult tor-toises find mates and have offspring, he said.
“Once females lay eggs and those 
eggs hatch, then there will be a lot of juveniles and hatchlings mov-ing around to find burrows and so forth,” he said.
FWC local government coordina-
tor Allie Perryman said the gopher tortoise is a keystone species, which means other species live in or have been found within their burrows. 
Some of these other species are also 
threatened.
“A decline in gopher tortoises 
could mean a decline in those spe-cies as well,” Perryman said.
The commission has released an 
app, called Florida Gopher Tortoise,  to encourage people to participate in the conservation efforts of the go-
pher tortoise.
Perryman said the app not only 
helps the commission map out the 
location of the tortoises and their burrows, but it can also help educate the general public.
To report an injured or dead go-pher tortoise, download the app, call the FWC at 850-921-1030 or call the Wildlife Alert hotline at 888-404-
3922.

CAPE CANAVERAL — A space 
station cargo ship will remain Earth-
bound for a while longer because of a rocket leak.
With about an hour remaining, 
the SpaceX company called off Monday’s planned launch. Offi-cials said they believe the problem can be fixed by Friday, which is the next opportunity for flying and the last chance before astronauts do ur-gent spacewalking repairs.
A helium leak in the first-stage of 
the unmanned Falcon rocket forced a halt to the countdown, the latest delay spanning the past month.
Over the weekend, NASA al-
most postponed the launch attempt because of a computer outage at the International Space Station. But mission managers decided Sunday that everything would be safe for the arrival of the Dragon capsule and its two and a half tons of sup-plies.
The computer, a critical backup, 
failed outside the space station Fri-day as flight controllers were trying to activate it for a routine software load. The primary computer has been working fine.
It’s the first breakdown ever of 
one of these so-called space station MDMs, or multiplexer-demulti-plexers, used to route computer commands for a wide variety of systems. Forty-five MDMs are scat-tered around the orbiting lab. The failed one is located outside and therefore will require spacewalking repairs.
The Dragon capsule holds a 
gasket-like material for next week’s computer replacement. This new material was rushed to the launch site during the weekend and loaded into the Dragon. NASA said astro-nauts can make the repair without it, if necessary.
NASA astronauts Rick Mas-
tracchio and Steven Swanson will perform the spacewalk next Tues-day — regardless of whether the Dragon flies by then. It will take several days to get the replacement computer ready, thus the one-week wait before the job, NASA’s Kenny Todd, a station operations manag-er, said Monday.
SpaceX — Space Exploration 
Technologies Corp. of California — is one of two American companies hired by NASA to fill the cargo gap left when the space shuttles retired in 2011. Orbital Sciences Corp. of Virginia is the other.
If the SpaceX Dragon isn’t flying 
by Friday, the company may have to get in line behind Orbital, which is on track for a May delivery run from its Virginia launching site.
The Dragon should have soared 
in mid-March, but SpaceX needed two extra weeks of launch prep-ping. Then an Air Force radar-tracking device was damaged in a fluke accident; an electrical short caused the instrument to overheat.Monday’s helium leak appar-
ently came from a system that sepa-rates the first stage during the first few minutes of flight.
Earlier in the afternoon, SpaceX 
signed a 20-year lease with NASA to take over the launch pad used during the Apollo and shuttle pro-grams. Kennedy Space Center’s Launch Complex 39-A would be used for SpaceX launches with as-tronauts bound for the space sta-tion in three or four more years, if NASA approves the venture. Rus-sia currently provides the only way to get astronauts to and from the space station.
Unmanned missions are also 
slated for this pad, possibly next year.

When late-afternoon fa-
tigue hits and happy hour 
at Dunkin’ Donuts is not an option, losing an hour of the day to the sweet serenity of a nap on the living room couch seems like a fair trade-off.
However, according to 
new research, people who consistently nap could be losing a lot more than one or two hours every day — they could be losing years.
A 13-year study published 
in the American Journal of Epidemiology revealed that individuals who nap during the day are more likely to die 
earlier than those who do not 
nap regularly.
The study, performed by 
researchers at Cambridge 
University, observed the 
sleeping habits of more than 
16,000 men and women in the United Kingdom and found that people who take naps during the day are al-most one-third more likely to die before they turn 65.
According to the Gator-
Well website, 44 percent of UF students report feeling well rested when they wake up in the morning on four or more days of the week.
The site offers a sleeping 
improvement program called Sleeping in the Swamp, de-veloped for and tested by UF students, which provides tips for better sleep. The program does not de-
nounce naps but encourages students to keep naps shorter than one hour.
Carolyn Ivey, manager of 
North Florida Regional Med-
ical Center’s Sleep Disorders 
Center, wrote in an email that multiple studies suggest 
the majority of college stu-
dents are sleep deprived. 
“Sleep is a time for our 
bodies to restore physical and mental health,” she said. 
“Sleep problems can inter-
fere with quality of life and 
seriously impact health.”
Erratic work and class 
schedules, late-night study 
sessions and stress can result 
in an unhealthy sleep depri-
vation, said Ivey, 61. 
“Naps are an attempt to 
regain lost sleep,” she said. 
“However, it takes more 
than a nap to recover from a 
serious sleep debt.”
Skylar Chwatt, a 21-year-
old UF public relations se-
nior, said the study might be misleading. She said she suspects that underlying health issues may encourage individuals to take more fre-quent naps as opposed to the other way around.
The study acknowledges 
the plausibility of such an idea and admits napping may be “an early sign of system disregulation and a marker of future health problems.”
Chwatt said her grandfa-
ther, who is almost 80 years old, is an advocate of naps.
“He is one of the healthi-
est guys I know — still swims laps every morning — but, man, does that guy love to nap,” she said.Pillow talk: Snoozing

The most anticipated reg-
ular-season game is here. 
Florida’s biggest rival in 
the American Lacrosse Con-
ference, Northwestern, will be the opponent in UF’s final game of the regular season 
on Saturday in Evanston, Ill.
No. 5 Northwestern (9-4, 
3-2 ALC) is No. 4 Florida’s 
(14-2, 5-0 ALC) final obstacle in completing the season un-
defeated in conference play.
In Florida’s 14-9 win over 
Vanderbilt on Sunday, the 
Gators clinched the No. 1 
seed in the ALC Tourna-
ment.
If it beats Northwestern, 
UF won’t just be the No. 1 seed in the conference tour-
nament but will also finish 
out the regular season with a 15-2 record — an impressive feat for a team that lost sev-
eral key players when its in-
augural class graduated after last season.
However, O’Leary isn’t 
concerned with staying un-
defeated. With the No. 1 seed 
already clinched, her focus is on finishing the season strong 
and entering the tournament 
on a high note.
“Ultimately, this game is all about us playing North-
western and it’s not about 
what the ramifications are if we lose,” O’Leary said.
Freshman Sammi Burgess 
said the offense would have 
to make fast-break points to 
have a chance against North-western, and O’Leary agrees.
“It’s important that we 
actually get up and down 
the field because we do have 
good speed on our team, so we want to capitalize on one more man-up to make those 
opportunities happen for 
us,” O’Leary said.
Burgess, freshman mid-
fielder Mollie Stevens and sophomore midfielder De-
von Schneider capitalized 
on multiple fast-break op-portunities against Vander-bilt, scoring six goals on fast 
breaks.
The success on fast-break 
points against Vanderbilt 
was good practice for Florida � FLORIDA IS RANKED NO. 1.

With five days left in the 2014 
gymnastics season and just one 
practice before the Gators depart 
for the NCAA Championship, the 
finish line is clearly in sight. 
No. 1 Florida will travel to 
Birmingham, Ala., for the 2014 
NCAA Championships from April 18-20. But the reigning 2013 champions are not focused solely 
on returning to Gainesville with the program’s second NCAA championship trophy. 
“We don’t talk about repeat-
ing because that’s focusing on the end result and we have to focus on the process,” coach Rhonda Faehn said. 
“Right now, our focus is on 
two great training practices here, and then getting there and hav-ing an awesome podium training 
and then the first day and going 
out and just competing aggres-sively on that first day.”
With almost two weeks be-
tween NCAAs and Florida’s last outing at regionals — where the Gators claimed first place — Faehn and her gymnasts used their time off to prepare and per-
fect.

After starting 53 games and hitting 11 
home runs in 2013, Briana Little has seen 
less time on the field this season.
The junior outfielder has started just 
nine games in 2014, taking on more of a reliever role to start the season.
But that didn’t stop Little from making 
the most of her chances at the plate against Florida A&M and NC State this past week-
end.
The Middleburg native went 3 for 3 at the plate during the Gators’ 9-0 win against the Rattlers on Friday and hit her second home run of the season in their 10-0 
thumping of the Wolfpack on Saturday.
“I just came ready to play,” Little said. 
“Whether I was playing or not, I was ready. I was going to get a hit, that’s what 
I planned on doing.”
Little’s home run against NC State, a 
three-RBI slam to center field, capped off a Florida first inning that drove in five total runs.
“I saw her in her stride and she was mid-stride when she got into her leg a little more. You could tell it was a 
slower pitch, and she just 
let it fly,” coach Tim Wal-ton said. “In a worst-case 
scenario, you’re looking at that as being a run … So I’m thinking, ‘Alright. 
We got a good swing, an 
elevated pitch.’ And she just smoked it.”
Little’s performance at the plate in Flor-
ida’s nonconference shutouts boosted her batting average to .375 — second only to 
Kelsey Stewart’s .387 — and gives her a team-leading slugging percentage of .594 
in her limited time.
“With more at-bats, that brings more 
confidence,” Little said. “I was just going to keep swinging the bat hard and looking 
for good pitches.”
On the weekend, the Gators posted a 
.455 team batting average, and three play-ers had multi-hit games in both contests.

� BASEBALL AMERICA RANKS UF 
NINTH.
ADAM PINCUS
Alligator Staff Writer@adamDpincus
When trouble brewed in 2013, Florida 
folded. That has not been the case this sea-
son.
Florida committed five errors in its series 
finale against South Carolina. It had a 4-2 
deficit going into the eighth inning in front 
of a sold-out crowd of 8,242. But the Gators still pulled out a come-from-behind, 6-5 vic-tory on Sunday to clinch the series.The Gators fin-
ished 7-10 in one-run 
games last season. 
Through Sunday, 
they’re 8-1 against top-five teams, are 10-5 in one-run games and have nine comeback wins. Baseball America rewarded UF with a top-10 ranking on Monday. 
Freshman A.J. Puk earned Southeastern 
Conference Freshman of the Week honors with his win and RBI double on Saturday. 
It’s a year to the day Harrison Bader was the 
last Gators freshman with the honor.
No. 9 Florida (23-13, 9-6 SEC), fresh off 
a series-finale victory, visits Florida Gulf Coast (24-13, 9-3 Atlantic Sun) in Fort My-ers tonight at 6:30. It has a one-game lead on South Carolina in the Eastern Division and 
trails Alabama by a game for the overall SEC 
lead. 
“I can’t say enough about our team and 
the way we battled,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said in a release. “The bottom line is that it was a really gritty performance by the whole team this weekend.”
Florida split its two games against Flori-
da Gulf Coast during the three-team, round-
robin tournament in Gainesville from Feb. 
27 to March 2. Right-hander Michael Murray held Florida scoreless over seven innings in a 2-1 win to open the tournament.
The Gators dropped their final game that weekend 5-1 to Illinois. The Illini outscored the Gators 11-1 in two wins. Freshman Peter 
Alonso called the ineffective at-bats frustrat-
ing. Florida skipped out on its postgame dugout meeting that Sunday for a closed-doors meeting in the locker room.
For as bleak as Florida’s future looked 
then, it has made a complete 180-degree turnaround. As it stands, Florida will likely host a regional and could potentially travel to Tallahassee for the Super Regionals. The 
Gators swept the season series against the 
Seminoles, capping it with an 8-0 victory on April 8.

torSports.org.Gators’ clutch victories vault them to top-10 ranking
UF Baseballfrom regionals, we spent a 
few days focusing in more on individualized skills and 
making little corrections here 
or there,” Faehn said. 
Florida’s trip to Alabama 
could be déjà vu for some 
Gators, because they compet-
ed in the same arena against some of the same teams on March 22 at the Southeastern Conference Championship. 
“We’re really looking for-
ward to getting back to the arena that we competed in a few weeks ago and getting 
familiar again with that real 
quick and then getting the championship underway,” Faehn said. 
Florida is hoping to do 
better than they did at the SEC Championships, in which the Gators fell short of the title by .175, losing to 
host Alabama. But UF will 
be looking back on that meet to prepare for the podium equipment set up that the Gators have competed on 
only once this season. 
“Podium is going to be 
different, just a little bit, than 
what we encountered at re-
gionals,” Faehn said.  “I feel 
like our athletes adjust very quickly to that.”Though most Florida 
gymnasts have competed on podium equipment in past stints of elite and interna-tional gymnastics, the Gators 
have competed 11 of 12 meets 
this season on non-podium equipment and they prac-tice on regular equipment so 
adjustments will need to be 
made.
“The slight difference is 
that with a podium it’s on a raised surface and it is in ef-
fect a little bit springier, a lit-
tle bit bouncier,” Faehn said. “So I know our athletes abso-lutely love that for floor and 
vault, it’s a little bit softer on 
the landings but they have been training definitely with the harder landings.” 
Florida will compete in  
Semifinal II against Alabama, UCLA, Nebraska, Penn State and Utah on Friday at 8 p.m. The top three teams from 
each of the two semifinals 
will move onto Saturday’s Super Six team finals, where a champion will be named. This will be UF’s first multi-
ple-day meet this season. 
“It’s definitely a longer 
competition,” Faehn said. 
“We’re going to take one 
day at a time, but they are 
going to be able to compete aggressively and well for all of the days.”because the Commodores’ style of play is similar to Northwest-ern’s, O’Leary said.
“I think when teams slow the 
ball down against us, it’s our de-fense that needs to adjust and I don’t think that we did a tremen-dous job defensively against it,” O’Leary said. 
“I thought we were too fo-
cused on our single players and not as a unit as a whole.”
Florida has faced Northwest-ern every year since the program 
began play in 2010. 
The Gators are 3-1 in the series, 
but the Wildcats have made the 
Final Four in the NCAA Tourna-ment each of the last four seasons 
and have won two titles in that 
span. They have seven NCAA Championships since 2005. 
While the Gators have a histor-
ical advantage over the Wildcats, the team’s two losses this season have come while on the road. Last season’s loss in the ALC Tournament — the first loss to 
Northwestern in Florida’s history — was at the neutral Homewood Field in Baltimore.
O’Leary has emphasized Flori-
da’s pace all season, and now that 
it’s down to the final game of the season, UF has to come out dictat-
ing the pace or the defense could 
be swallowed up by the Wildcats’ relaxed offense.
“Northwestern typically comes 
out in a methodical, kind of slow-paced offense,” O’Leary said. 
“They work very hard for that 
perfect shot and they get that per-fect shot because they wear down 
the defense.”Kirsti Merritt said. “Whatever team 
you’re coming up against, you play 
them like any other team. Just going out there and hitting and playing de-
fense the same. Going out there and 
being able to hit with runners in scor-ing position is really boosting our 
confidence.”
Added Walton: “This is such a 
mental game. It’s important when you look up there and see that many 
runs and that many hits, you typi-cally don’t look in the dugout and see 
that many down faces of kids who 
have not been successful. It’s highly contagious and highly mental, that’s 
for sure.”
Walton also spent the weekend ex-
perimenting with his starting lineup, allowing some players who have been 
on the bench to be a contributing fac-tor to the offense.
In addition to Little making two 
starts this weekend, junior outfielder Jessica Damico earned her third start 
of the year Friday.
Damico started 59 games through her first two seasons at UF, but she has entered only 28 so far this season, 
with the majority of those appear-ances coming as a pinch runner or 
a seventh-inning substitution in the 
outfield. In her start on Friday, the Gray Summit, Mo., native notched 
her first hit of the season and swiped 
her fifth bag of the year.
“For Jess, obviously, she played 
quite a bit last year and we’ve gone to maybe a little bit of a different offense in some ways with playing a couple 
of the freshmen and the left-handed 
at-bats,” Walton said. “So that’s been the biggest difference in the number 
of at-bats she’s had, is that we’ve 
gone to a different style.”
Walton liked giving players such 
as Damico a chance in the lineup and said that despite their lack of playing time, some spots in the lineup aren’t 
locked up as the regular season starts 
to wind down.
“There are still a couple jobs that 
haven’t been won, and we’re not go-ing to let them be won,” Walton said. “We’re going to continue to rotate and 
go with who’s doing well at practice, 
go with who’s doing well in games.”

 Alligator Writer @ibcohen5 
  Going into the Southeastern Conference Tour-
nament, coach Roland Thornqvist is excited for 
two reasons.
  Reason No. 1 is freshman Kourtney Keegan, 
who has been named SEC Freshman of the Week 
twice this season. The other is sophomore Bri-
anna Morgan, who was named SEC Player of the 
Week on Monday.
  When opposing teams scout Florida, they are 
initially drawn to the Gators’ three decorated se-niors — Alexandra Cercone, Olivia Janowicz and Soﬁ  e Oyen. After all, the threesome has hoisted 
two national championship trophies and cap-
tured three SEC titles in their four-year tenure.
  But Florida’s secret weapons are its newest 
faces.
  On Monday, Morgan was named SEC Co-
Player of the Week after a dominant performance in UF’s two weekend matches. The second-year player compiled a 4-0 record and grabbed her 10th consecutive victory as the Gators outscored 
Kentucky and No. 5 Vanderbilt 8-1.
  Morgan improved to 17-1 in career SEC sin-
gles matches. She hasn’t lost one this season.
  The sophomore has been praised for picking 
up her play in the late stages of the season. After 
rehabbing from a shoulder injury that cost her some practice time over the winter, Morgan has consistently played at the one spot — above her older and more experienced peers.
  “My shoulder has gotten a lot better, but as 
far as tennis, I think I’ve improved my backhand a lot and my net game, my volleys and my dou-bles,” Morgan said. “In general, I think I’ve im-
proved as a player.”
  Thornqvist would pin that as an understate-
ment.
  “There’s nobody in the country better right 
now,” he said.
  At least in singles play.  In doubles, Keegan may have a leg up on the 
sophomore.
  “Yeah, [Kourtney] is pretty good in doubles, 
I’ll tell you that,” Thornqvist said. “She has a 
monster serve, big ground strokes, and she’s not afraid at the net. She’s got great courage and she 
can make the right play calls.”
  Keegan is a coach’s dream in doubles pairings 
and the perfect compliment to Janowicz. The two 
have cemented their position as Florida’s best 
duo and currently rank 26th in the nation. 
  “Both of us are pretty conﬁ  dent, and we have 
a great connection on the court,” Keegan said. 
“We always know where the other is going to be.” 
  But stellar play is expected from Janowicz, 
who is also the nation’s No. 9 singles player. For Keegan, greatness wasn’t always a sure thing.
  When Keegan arrived on campus last August, 
she worked tirelessly to improve her quickness, durability and overall ﬁ  tness. She would need it to survive the long and grueling spring season and a potentially deep tournament run if Florida stays alive in the postseason.
  “What we saw in Kourtney when she came 
here was the raw power and the talent,” Thorn-qvist said. “It’s really easy for a coach to see all that and say, ‘You want it now.’ But that wasn’t 
the play with Kourtney.”
  Twenty-eight wins in singles matches, 31 dou-
bles wins and two SEC Freshman of the Week 
awards later, Keegan is surpassing all expecta-tions.
  “I mean, looking at Kourtney’s numbers now 
in doubles, her freshman year, they’re pretty scary,” Thornqvist said. “If she can continue on this pace, she’ll be one of the best doubles players 
to ever play here.” 16, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, APRIL 15, 2014
