Volunteers and ofﬁ  cers continued the search for Christian Aguilar, 18, in the woods around the Ala-chua County Fairgrounds on Wednesday during a press conference.

As the search for a missing 
UF student moved to northeast 
Gainesville, police released new information Wednesday about what the suspect purchased before 
Christian Aguilar’s disappear-
ance.
In a press conference at the Ala-
chua County Fairgrounds Wednes-day morning, Gainesville Police spokesman Ben Tobias said police conﬁ  rmed that Pedro A. Bravo purchased a shovel and a roll of duct tape several days before Agu-
ilar went missing.
Tobias said police did not re-
cover either of the items. He added 
that Aguilar’s last known cell-phone activity was at 8:14 p.m. Sept. 20 when it was turned off. However, the phone has not been found. 
Aguilar, an 18-year-old bio-
medical engineering freshman from Miami, was photographed 
while walking into a Best Buy 
with Bravo, an 18-year-old student 
at Santa Fe College, to purchase Kanye West’s “Cruel Summer” CD at about 3 p.m. Sept. 20.
Tobias said Bravo and Aguilar 
met at UF earlier that day.Police recovered the disc jewel 
case and wrapping, but not the CD. 
If the CD is found, it “may lead us 
to some more information,” Tobias said.
Police named Bravo a person 
of interest Friday, after he said he fought with Aguilar and left him in a parking lot in the 4900 block of Northwest 13th Street.
Police arrested Bravo on Mon-
day on a charge of depriving a victim of medical care, which is a third-degree felony.
Bravo remains in the Alachua 
County Jail with a $100,000 bond and hired a lawyer.
Volunteers and ofﬁ  cers combed 
through the wooded areas Wednesday near the fairgrounds, 
the Gainesville Regional Airport, 
the Airport Industrial Park and the State Road 121 corridor, but no new evidence was found, Tobias said.
Carlos Aguilar, Christian Agui-
lar’s father, also spoke with report-ers Wednesday.
In lieu of the new information 
from police, Carlos Aguilar, 45, said he and his family will contin-ue to look for his son.
“We still believe there is hope,” 
he said.Suspect in missing student case bought shovel, tape

country artist Josh Turner at this year’s 
Gator Growl.
The Growl, billed as the largest stu-
dent-run pep rally in the world, will be 
at 7 p.m. Nov. 9 at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadi-
um. The theme of the 89th Gator Growl is “United We Growl,” according to a news release.
Morgan spent eight seasons as a reg-
ular cast member on “Saturday Night Live.” He stars as Tracy Jordan in NBC’s “30 Rock” sitcom, which earned him an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Sup-
porting Actor in a Comedy Series.Gator Growl’s associate producer of 
communications Lauren Ettlinger, 21, 
said feedback from undergraduates, graduate students and alumni suggested attendees would want a comedian from a current television show. Morgan’s name came up frequently . 
“Tracy was very excited about doing 
this show, and we thought he would be a great choice,” Ettlinger said. Ettlinger would not disclose how much Morgan is being paid to appear. 
The Gator Growl lineup will also in-
clude ﬁ  reworks, the Para-Commandos skydiving team, the Dazzlers, UF cheer-leaders and members of the Gators foot-
ball team, according to the release.

“Harry Potter” series author J.K. Rowl-
ing is at it again.
Today marks the release of her new book, 
“The Casual Vacancy,” her ﬁ  rst novel writ-
ten for an older audience. As of press time, the book was already at No. 1 on Amazon’s Top 100 Best Sellers list.
Like many fans, freshman English and 
economics major Anna Morgan, 18, would love to see Rowling revisit the magical se-ries that made her famous.
She started reading the books in third 
grade and is now a chaser on the Quidditch team at UF.
Morgan said she plans to read Rowling’s 
new book eventually, but “comparison is 
inevitable.”
According to the book’s description on 
Amazon, “The Casual Vacancy” is 512 pag-es of adult content, touching on themes like 
death, politics, drugs and crime.
UF professor of English Brandon Ker-
shner said he’s interested in reading the 
novel, but he’s in no rush.
Kershner said he pre-
dicts some people who 
usually don’t read seri-ous novels will read “The Casual Vacancy” simply 
because they loved Rowl-
ing’s “Harry Potter” series so much.
“I think it will do well 
by ordinary novel stan-
dards — but nothing like ‘Harry Potter’ standards,” he said.
Brooke Austill, a 22-year-old journalism 
junior, agreed.
“Since she is so famous, people will be 
reading it more to see what new aspects she is bringing to her writing,” she said.‘Harry Potter’ author releases

◗ CONSTRUCTION IS AHEAD OF 
SCHEDULE.
SAMANTHA BLACK
Alligator Contributing Writer
After about a year and a half of re-
pair work, all 334 apartments at The 
Bartram should soon be filled with resi-dents, said J.D. Hatton, general man-ager. The apartment complex opened 
its doors to new residents Aug. 1 and 
is set to lease the remaining half of its complex in January.
During an annual inspection in 
2011, Hatton said inspectors found that the roof truss system needed to be ad-justed, and the balconies needed better wrapping. The construction is restricted to the vacant north building.
Although the second phase of apart-
ments is set to lease Jan. 1, Hatton es-timated that it might be ready sooner, because they’re ahead of schedule.
A lawsuit filed by The Bartram 
against the original builders of the complex endured for the first couple of months after the apartments’ 2011 clos-ing. According to Alligator archives, the repairs were said to be a result of the companies’ not building the apart-ments “properly.”
The Bartram sued for breach of con-
tract after water damage that was al-legedly caused by construction defects was found, according to the case file.
Hatton said the lawsuit was resolved 
outside of court before it went to trial.
UF law student Jennifer Harrington 
remembered being removed from her apartment at The Bartram when it 
closed in 2011.
“I think the fact that they spent a 
year with no residents just devoted to 
fixing whatever issues they had is, if anything, reassuring that those issues won’t arise again,” she said.The Bartram is set to leasecampus

The Tannahill Weavers, a Scottish traditional 
band, will perform at 7:30 p.m. at the Phillips 
Center for the Performing Arts.
The band features four members: Roy Gul-
lane, guitar and vocals; Phil Smillie, flute and 
bodhran; John Martin, fiddle; and Colin Mel-
ville, bagpipes.
According to the band’s website, its music 
embraces the Highlander’s Celtic music and the Lowlander’s Anglo-Saxon tunes. The mu-sic combines traditional Scottish melodies with more modern rhythms.
The band is very popular in Scotland, said 
Todd Taylor, the public relations associate for 
UF Performing Arts. It has received positive 
reviews from the media in the United States as well.
“UFPA takes pride in presenting performers 
from all over the world that UF students and res-idents in North Central Florida might otherwise not be able to see and experience,” he said.
Taylor expects the show to last about 90 min-
utes. He would not disclose the artist fee UFPA is paying for the Tannahill Weavers.
He said the performance might approach a 
sellout, with about 1,700 people in attendance, including more than 1,000 students enrolled in the newly required humanities course “What is the Good Life?”
Preparations for the performance are in full 
swing at the Phillips Center, including ensuring of a prop-
erly staffed venue.
Jonathan Prevost, the 
event staff coordinator, is responsible for making sure events go smoothly.
Prevost said the typical 
performance at the Phillips Center requires between 10 
and 40 volunteer ushers. 
In addition to the volunteers, Prevost has 
scheduled an extensive team to work behind the scenes and a security staff of eight to 14 to promote safety at all times. With experience in much bigger and complicated performances, he is not concerned about Thursday’s show.
“This should be a piece of cake,” Prevost said.

Aguilar’s family says Bravo is lying
Carlos Aguilar talked about the relation-
ship between his son and Bravo, saying he 
never saw any problems within their group of friends.
“Pedro was a boy who never demon-
strated fighting, and we never knew of him getting into any conflicts,” he said in Span-ish at the press conference. “And at least to my knowledge, I never knew that one of the boys from Doral was involved in drugs or any of those activities.”
Carlos Aguilar said he saw the court vid-
eo from Bravo’s first appearance Tuesday, and described him as not the same person 
he knew. 
“That’s a criminal walking with a cold-
blood mind,” he said.
Carlos Aguilar said he believed his son’s 
disappearance was tied to his relationship 
with Erika Friman, who is Bravo’s ex-girl-friend.
“I know that in this circle of lies that he’s 
thrown out, he said that it’s because of a love story, and that’s a lie,” Carlos Aguilar said 
in Spanish.
Carlos Aguilar said he also believed Bravo 
lied about the information he gave to police.
“Pedro is a pathological liar,” he said. 
“He’s been telling lies right from the begin-
ning, and right now, we know we cannot be-lieve him.”
Carlos Aguilar said he told his family that 
they “have to start thinking the worst.”
A reporter asked what his wife’s reaction 
was to the new information about Bravo.
Holding back tears, Carlos Aguilar said 
his wife told him, “He killed my son.”
Marjorie Nunez translated Carlos Aguilar’s 
statements.

PROJECT AIMS TO HELP NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS.

For some, the hammock tied between 
two trees in the atrium of the Architecture 
Building is nothing more than a place to kick back and take a breather. But this seemingly small addition is actually part 
of a much bigger picture.
UF students in the Design Innova-
tion course will participate in the Make 
a Difference project throughout the next two months. The project was introduced to the students Tuesday and encourages them to use their skills in small ways to make big differences, said Margaret Por -
tillo, a professor and chairwoman for the 
Department of Interior Design.
The project is sponsored by the Inte-
rior Design Educators Council. This is the 
third year UF students are participating, Portillo said. Students identify nonprofit organizations with specific needs and implement solutions — called “design interventions” — to meet those needs.
Before this semester, Portillo said, stu-
dents had the option to address a need on campus. The hammock in the atrium was the result of one project. This semester, however, students will work only with nonprofit organizations off campus.
She said the focus was put on orga-
nizations off campus so students could take their expertise and creativity into the community and increase the scope of 
their impact.
In the past, Portillo said, this project 
has been done with interior design ma-
jors and nonmajors enrolled in Design Innovation. This semester, for the first time, the project is also being done with an online section.
With the integration of the online sec-
tion and a list of about 100 organizations 
for students to choose from, she said the 
department is really “opening the flood-gates” of possibility within the project.
Peggy Carr, the associate dean for the 
UF College of Design, Construction and Planning, helped coordinate students’ ef-forts in previous semesters. She said stu-dents need to be aware of how their de-sign efforts later in their careers will affect 
people, and this project shows them how 
their work can make a real difference.
Pamela Driza, a graduate student and 
Design Innovation instructor, said part of the importance behind this project is showing students what interior design is really about.
“There’s a misconception that it’s dec-
orating, and it absolutely is not,” Driza 
said. “We will not pick pillows, and we 
will not pick carpet in this semester. It won’t happen.”
Because Design Innovation is an in-
troductory course, Driza said, the project is an opportunity for students to see how far they can push the envelope.
Some students approach Driza with 
concerns about the extent of their creativ-
ity , but she said these are the students 
who often develop the most creative and impactful solutions.
She said the goal is to submit about 
three of this semester’s projects to the IDEC Social Responsibility Network, which will compile the ideas for exhibi-tion at the IDEC conference and online.
Because the point of the project is for 
students to make an impact on the orga-nizations they work with, Portillo said she sees the online section as an opportu-nity for the program to grow and multi-ply the overall effect on the communities 
students select.
At one point, students will have 36 
hours to fully implement or physically 
install their design interventions within the organizations, which receive them for free.
Portillo, who introduced the project 
to a section of Driza’s students Tuesday, said she recognized the looks of trepida-tion on students’ faces when she men-tioned the time limit, but it generally is not an issue.
The strict 36-hour deadline and ex-
tended emphasis on the post-design evaluation, she said, requires students 
to use photographs and other forms of 
documentation to show how a design is incorporated and used within the orga-nizations.
“These can be small solutions, but 
they really do make a difference,” Driza said.Design class seeks to help

Students who gripe about rising tuition costs across 
the county may have a valid concern, according to 
findings from a study released this month.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development’s annual “Education at a Glance” re-
port, which studies the education systems of coun-
tries across the world, showed it costs a U.S. student between $116,000 and $117,000 to pursue a college degree, including direct costs and a calculation of pos-sible wages lost while in school.
The U.S. is the second highest among the surveyed 
countries in terms of overall cost, behind the United Kingdom at about $122,000.
The study also showed 29 percent of Americans 
will get a higher level of education than their parents. The U.S. is third to last among the 26 countries sur -
veyed for the category.
The report said 17 percent of parents in the U.S. 
haven’t received a secondary degree, such as a bach-elor’s degree, as compared to the international aver -
age of 33 percent.
However, the report said that payoff for a college 
degree is higher in the U.S. than in most countries.
Pilar Mendoza, an assistant professor in the College 
of Education, said she wasn’t surprised by the study’s findings. She called the study a “reality check” for the government.
“Unless the government does something to elimi-
nate poverty, we will see an increase in the gap be-tween the haves and have-nots,” she said. “It is true that the United States is ahead in terms of educated people, but if this trend continues, I think the United States will start losing that.”
Mendoza said rising tuition costs and uncertain 
postgraduation job opportunities are primary reasons young people don’t go to college today.
McKinley Carden, a 21-year-old elementary edu-
cation junior, agreed. She said she tutored students at low-income schools and saw the effects of a failed edu-cation system firsthand. Once, she said, a third grader couldn’t read to her a Dr. Seuss book.
“Tuition goes up each year, and it’s not like educa-
tion is stressed enough in this country,” she said. “The 
government needs to be more involved in the educa-
tion system.”
UF spokesman Steve Orlando said UF is trying to 
correct these problems through access and affordabil-ity for students.
More than $500 million in financial aid is disbursed 
at UF annually, Orlando said.
“Yes, we’ve had to increase tuition, but we’re still 
very affordable compared to our peers,” he said.
Orlando said $17,000 is the average amount UF stu-
dents pay back in loans after graduation, compared to the $25,000 national average. He said about 66 percent of graduates leave UF with no loan debt.Study shows US among most 
expensive countries for college

Few things in life are free, and public school is one of 
them. The lessons taught in today’s classrooms will be seen in the years to come as students enter college and 
eventually the working world. Our public school system 
owes it to children to give them the tools for success. And an 
extra hour a week may be just what the kids need.
Elementary school is a place where lessons and values 
are formed as children learn to share and express them-selves. However, it is also a place where receiving an educa-tion is top priority.
According to The Gainesville Sun, seven Alachua Coun-
ty schools are holding students an hour later in hopes of im-
proving standardized test scores. In these 60 minutes, teach-
ers can give more personal attention to struggling students.
The bonus hour was created in response to the poor 
FCAT results from last spring. The 100 Florida elementary schools with the lowest scores would have more classroom time. Seven Alachua County schools made the cut.
While this may seem like a punishment, it is the best 
thing the government can do for the children. More hours spent learning keeps children entertained longer and equals less time to cause trouble.
In actuality , all elementary school students could greatly 
beneﬁ  t from this extra hour of instruction. Instead of sup-porting state programs that do not provide direct results, our state needs to invest in the future. That is, it needs to spend the money on education now so the educational sys-tem provides what it should for the thousands of children in Florida that it supports.
Adding an hour to a school day creates a positive ripple 
effect.
Not only would children learn more and have a more 
valuable education, but also parents would be able to work longer hours knowing that their children are in good hands. Many children with two employed parents attend after-school programs, so lengthening the school day would only give them an educational boost and not create any kind of 
disturbance in their daily routines.The money that is spent to ﬁ  -
nance after-school programs can 
add the extra hour of education. Therefore, the expense of length-
ening a school day would not be 
as great.
Children must work to receive 
their educations, but they must be met halfway. The decreased budgets for sports and arts pro-
grams is a true testament to what our society really consid-ers important. Studies have proven time and time again that 
creative and physical outlets are necessary for growing chil-
dren.
The budget committee obviously does not give much 
credibility to such studies, as they continually cut funding for the programs.
The national deﬁ  cit is now out the window, and the ad-
ditional zeros behind the front numbers send a shiver down 
my spine. If we are willing to leave the rising generations 
with this massive problem, they need a solid foundation for their education.
Elementary school children of today will be taking over 
the broken economy of tomorrow. We owe it to them to give them an education that will serve as a foundation for the remainder of their lives.
We live in a society focused on moving forward and al-
ways reaching for the newest, biggest and best things. Chil-dren who do not have a top education may not accelerate 
at this momentum, which potentially sets the pace for their 
entire lives.  
What are we teaching children if we cannot even grant 
them the education they rightfully deserve? Increasing funds for public education and ultimately giving students more time to learn will open an endless amount of possibili-ties for the next era.

appears on Thursdays.Party Pooper 
Gators should stay 
out of pools
We just heard about a really cool new trend, and we 
couldn’t wait to tell you about it. It’s fun, it’s exciting and it’s just a little bit dangerous.
It’s gator pool parties!
Oh, wait, it’s not just the normal pool parties that UF students 
have daily during the summer? You mean this new trend is of 
actual, live alligators being placed in pools with children who then smile and take their pictures with them?
That sounds a bit too exotic for us. But that’s what Alligator 
Attraction offers.
The Tampa Bay Times explains how the workers “take alliga-
tors smaller than 4 feet long to pool parties around the Tampa Bay area and allow guests to swim with them, hold them and take photos.”
Bob Barrett, the owner of Alligator Attraction, and his “gator 
parties” recently made the national news circuit, mostly because people are rightfully concerned about a myriad of safety issues.
“If you’re 9, 10 or 11 years old, you’ve already had the ‘jump-
aroo’ house, the bounce house, you’ve had the pizza party, you’ve had the clown party ,” Barrett said to ABC News. “You get to have a pool party with a gator. It’s a very popular party.”
Apparently, kids these days love it.“They really were so into it,” Chris Jones, a mother in the 
Tampa Bay area, said of the party she threw for her 8-year-old this summer.
Only, she didn’t tell her son or his guests about the “gator 
party” ahead of time. Imagine telling your mother that you were at a pool party with live alligators in the pool with you. Then, imagine never going to a birthday party again.
Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission spokes-
man Ofﬁ  cer Baryl Martin said that it’s not something they would necessarily encourage people to try.
“But it is not a violation of the law,” Martin said, according 
to the Tampa Bay Times. “Our main concern is the safety of the people and the animals.”
Although the alligators’ mouths are taped shut, and they are 
very young, that doesn’t sound like an atmosphere that would be described as “safe parenting.” Fine, OK, we guess proper precautions are taken when putting reptiles in the same pool as kids.
Quite frankly , these parties sound terrible, but maybe that’s 
because we’re not 8-year-old boys who might love these kinds of things. 
“They go really fast,” Marshall Jones said when describing his 
awesome pool party this summer. “They’re like, really cool.”
Fair enough, Marshall. Fair enough. Maybe this trend isn’t as 
bad as we thought.
It’s certainly better than “butt chugging.” Also, don’t Google 
“butt chugging.

Letter to the Editor
Concerning Ryan Galloway’s Wednesday article 
about evolution:
I will explain why I disagree with you using an 
example. A friend and a stranger tell you conflict-
ing stories. 
In the past, you have trusted your friend because 
he has previously shown himself to be trustwor -
thy. 
The stranger, on the other hand, has never shown 
you any evidence that would support his honesty, though he may be correct in this case. 
Whom do you believe without further evidence 
about the circumstances? In whom do you put your faith? Which action requires a smaller leap of 
faith?
Similarly, while it is true that a measure of faith 
is required to believe in evolution, science is some-
thing that has shown us in the past to be a trustwor -
thy field due to its self-regulating nature. 
Religion, on the other hand, has never had any 
evidence to back up its claims. 
Evolution requires a significantly smaller leap of 
faith.
Also, to answer your question about the “miss-ing links” in the fossil record, consider the idea that not every location in every era on Earth had the nec-essary conditions to promote fossil formation, such as tar pits. 
Human remains will likely never fossilize be-
cause most dead people are buried in wooden box-es. 
Will a far future civilization disbelieve in Homo 
sapiens because they could not find our remains?
Finally, you express amusement at the idea of 
punctuated equilibrium. 
There is no deus ex machina. This is not an inex-
piable or random event. 
It only occurs when natural conditions separate 
a smaller group from the population at large, often within a very different environment. 
Please at least review Wikipedia before assert-
ing claims on a topic with which you are apparently 
unfamiliar.

In this election, Americans are understandably most concerned 
about their pocketbooks — their ability to put food on the table, to pay for gas, to cover the cost of college. Alas, the world does 
not pause while we attempt to put our houses in order. Over the past four years, China has grown stronger, Iran more nuclear and Islamic extremism more potent.
The next commander in chief will likely have to decide whether 
we are victorious in Afghanistan, whether Iran goes nuclear and 
whether we have the resolve to stand up to China in the Pacific.
Unfortunately, on nearly every major issue impacting the se-
curity of the United States, President Obama’s policies have made America less prepared for future threats.
Obama’s decision to set a pre-emptive, unconditioned expira-
tion date on the American presence in Afghanistan has put the U.S. on track to lose its first foreign war since Vietnam. Having once christened the war in Afghanistan as both just and necessary, the president, by issuing the withdrawal deadline concurrent with 
a major troop increase, has allowed the Taliban to wait us out. In turn, it 
is unlikely that otherwise supportive 
Afghans would oppose them for fear of brutal Taliban retribution once we leave.
By the end of a second Obama term, all American forces will be 
withdrawn from Afghanistan, but no American objectives will be achieved. Obama is fond of saying that the “tide of war is reced-ing” in the Middle East, but he fails to mention that the ebb of vic-tory is regressing as well.
A second Obama term will likely also see the fanatical Iranian 
regime gain possession of nuclear weapons. Iran’s nuclear prog-ress has accelerated on Obama’s watch, putting one of the world’s worst regimes on the verge of acquiring the world’s most danger -
ous weapon.
The Obama administration has also unreservedly embraced 
the quickly unraveling “Arab Spring,” calling the recent murder of the U.S. ambassador in Libya and the flying of black al-Qaida flags over four U.S. embassies on the anniversary of Sept. 11 mere 
“bumps in the road.”
Foreign policy begins with a simple dictum: Support your 
friends, defeat your enemies. Under Obama’s leadership, the U.S. 
has become an unreliable ally and a weak-kneed adversary. Iran is on the verge of acquiring nuclear weapons, American embas-sies in the Arab world are under attack, defeat in Afghanistan is over the horizon and the U.S. is unprepared for the challenge of a strong China.
While Americans are rightly concerned about the economy, 
they should also look beyond their kitchen tables and ask whether, over the last four years, America has become better prepared to deal with the more dangerous world that surrounds it.

The McKnight Brain Institute 
made a call, and artists answered.
The institute asked UF art stu-dents to submit a proposal for an art 
piece related to the brain, said UF 
biology professor and School of Art + Art History scholar-in-residence Jamie Gillooly . He was the one to make the call, because his job as scholar-in-residence is to get scien-
tists and artists to work together.
Kelly Sharp, the administrative 
director of the institute, saw the four 
best proposals, Gillooly said.
Sharp said the institute needed 
some artwork and decided to work with UF students.
“It was a desire to help out an-
other college and to ultimately dis-
play something that was done by a 
UF student,” he said.
Sorina Vaziri’s proposal was 
chosen, and now, months later, it hangs at the back entrance of the institute.
“We’re excited to have it,” Gil-
looly said. “She put a lot of thought and creativity into this and we’re all 
appreciative of it.”
The institute wanted a represen-
tation of neurons in a traditional 
way , but the 21-year-old graphic design senior’s proposal had a more modern design.
The 4-by-6-foot piece is made of 
wood, acrylic and plexiglass.
“It was a long, long journey ,” 
Vaziri said.
She painted the piece ﬁ  rst. Then, 
using Adobe Illustrator, she made it into abstract circles and lines to look like a circuit board to represent neurons interacting. With a laser cutter, she etched the designs onto plexiglass. Finally , she connected everything and attached it together 
on a frame.
“Through modern technology 
and through research, we’ve been 
able to understand the human brain,” Vaziri said.
The institute gave Vaziri $500 as 
an award and paid for her supplies. 
Gillooly said this is one of a se-
ries of initiatives UF has started to 
combine science and art.
“It’s a pretty rare collaboration,” 
Gillooly said.

UF may be one of the coun-
try’s 50 most expensive schools 
for out-of-state students, but 
the cost of tuition is one of the 
best investments students can make, according to a ranking by Smart Money.
The Wall Street Journal 
Magazine of Personal Business ranked UF second in terms of return on investment for 2009 graduates at 50 of the most ex-
pensive public and private U.S. 
colleges. The ranking was com-piled by comparing young pro-fessionals’ starting tuition and 
fees to their median salary.
The recent UF graduates re-
viewed from a salary database 
spent $73,476 on out-of-state tu-
ition and fees over fours years  
and made a median salary of $46,200, earning 182 points on the magazine’s scale. Georgia 
Institute of Technology lead 
the ranking with 202 points.
Smart Money also com-
pared the starting tuition and 
median salaries of midcareer graduates from the UF class of 
1997. In that category, the grad-uates make a median of $80,800 a year now and spent $26,850 on starting tuition and fees.
Christina Rohan, a 28-year-
old senior specializing in paint-ing, said UF produces profes-sionals in too many ﬁ  elds to 
declare one salary to repre-
sent all graduates, calling the $46,200 median salary “ambi-tious.”
“Maybe, if you’re an eco-
nomics or business major, that might be a reasonable esti-mate,” she said.
And while Georgia Institute 
of Technology may seem like a more sound economic op-tion for students, according to the rankings, it’s important to keep the lower cost of in-state 
tuition in mind, said econom-
ics professor Mark Rush. The ranking assumes students paid out-of-state tuition without ﬁ  -
nancial aid.
“Even though they’re high-
er on the scale, you’re still bet-
ter off in-state,” he said.
Steve Orlando, UF spokes-
man, said most UF under-graduate students paid in-state tuition and got ﬁ  nancial aid.
“When you take those two 
things into account, it makes the picture brighter,” he said.UF ranked second in

Orange and blue was not reserved 
for only Gator fans in The Swamp Sat-
urday.
At the opening of F.L.A. Gallery, at 10 
N. Main St., descending shelves adorned with oranges covered the walls on one side of the room, while aquatic patterns 
embellished the stark white wall in a sea 
of blue, purple, green and black on the other.
F.L.A. Gallery hosted its inaugural 
show, “Rewilding, F.L.A.,” Saturday 
night, with an exhibit featuring works 
from artists John Orth, Kelie Bowman and Serra Victoria Bothwell Fels. The show was from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m.
According to its Facebook page, the 
gallery operates from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. Thursday through Saturday, and noon to 5 p.m. Sundays.
“In the past, opportunities to show 
art have been restricted to one-night-only events,” Orth said. “Now, we have the opportunity to have this space with legitimate gallery hours.”
Orth said he plans to institute a resi-
dency program at the gallery in which 
fellow artists can receive living accom-
modations and a place to create and 
showcase their art.
“Many of my 
friends are artists and 
musicians,” Orth said. 
“A lot of them have done me the favor of showcasing my work. 
This is just an oppor -
tunity to return the favor.”
Bowman, a UF alumna, worked as 
a founding member of Cinders Gallery 
in Brooklyn, N.Y . for seven years before 
joining Orth in this new gallery venture.

culture,” Bowman said. “I’m interested 
in exposing smaller towns to the ideas of

Culinary creations and chemis-
try , an unlikely combination, fuse 
together at The Brew Spot Cafe, which opened early this month.
Less than 15 minutes from the UF 
campus, The Brew Spot Cafe, 1000 
NE 16th Ave. Building H, offers pa-
trons free chemistry lessons in addi-
tion to the menu.
Jeff Keaffaber, senior lecturer in 
the department of chemistry at UF 
and co-owner of The Brew Spot Cafe, teaches free chemistry classes to students who want extra assis-tance.
“Help is offered to UF, Santa Fe 
and high school students,” Keaf-faber said. “If you need help, show up.”
Topics are presented at 5 p.m. 
and 7 p.m. Monday through Thurs-day in the classroom at the cafe, a space with walls covered in chalk-board paint and six extra-large pic-nic tables that are perfect for study-ing.
The cafe is open for business be-
tween 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. daily, serv-ing breakfast all day, lunch and ap-petizers, said Keith Cox, co-owner and general manager at The Brew Spot Cafe.
“No freezer, no deep fryer — you 
will get fresh foods, home-baked breads, pies and cakes, all cooked the same day,” Cox said.
In addition to food,  the cafe of-
fers a drink selection of fresh-brewed coffees, craft beers and fine wines.
After leaving work at Disney 
as an Imagineer in 2003, Keaffaber wanted to create a place to fuse arts and science in a community-first restaurant.
One way the cafe focuses on the 
community is by decorating the 
walls with work by local artists.
If artists wish to sell their work, 
The Brew Spot Cafe asks for 10 per -
cent of the price to donate to local el-
ementary school art programs. They also buy their food from local grow-ers, Keaffaber said.
The classroom is also home to 
The Brew Spot Cafe Dinner The-ater, where guests can enjoy a per -
formance with their meal. The the-ater’s season begins with a mystery , “Trouble in Silver City ,” Friday at 7:30 p.m.
Keaffaber said he hopes the com-
munity finds other ways to use the classroom space.
“I just want it to be open and wel-
coming,” he said.THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 2012

Gainesville’s music gurus can witness 
the life story of the lesser-known folk-rocker 
Sixto Diaz Rodriguez, with the limited re-
lease screening of “Searching for Sugarman” at Regal Cinemas 14 Friday.
“Searching for Sugarman” is a film that 
showcases the true story of Rodriguez, the Detroit rocker who never blew up in the 
mainstream America of the ‘70s. This film 
follows two fans on the search for their music idol who, along the way, separate 
the true story of Rodriguez’s life from the 
myths of alleged suicide and a lost catalog of music.
After his failure to gain popularity in the 
U.S., Rodriguez went off the radar. During that time, a bootleg copy of his album found 
its way to South Africa, gained attention 
through commercial distribution and grew to be a huge success. Ironically, Rodriguez had no idea what 
a celebrity he had become with the interna-tional music fans in South Africa.
Chicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert 
gave “Searching for Sugarman” a four-star rating — his highest rating for films. 
“His songs became anthems of the anti-
apartheid movement,” Ebert said of Rodri-
guez.
The film premiered at 
the Tribeca Film Festival this year and had three limited screenings across 
the country in August, 
said Brittany Brave, college marketing representative 
for Sony Music Entertainment.
Gainesville was one of six cities in Florida 
chosen for the film screening and, although 
the reason is unknown, Gainesville’s music 
fans will be able to appreciate its release.
“We’ve got a city with a rich music scene, 
and that’s a huge part of the reason why Gainesville could have been chosen,” Brave said. “Between fans, musicians and other 
enthusiasts, Gainesville has a lot of people 
who would appreciate Rodriguez’s story.”‘Searching for Sugarman’ set for

Gainesville is about to feel the 
beats and lyrics from the heart of 
hip-hop’s newest member of roy-
alty, Childish Gambino.
Donald Glover, who raps by 
the name Childish Gambino, will perform on Flavet Field Friday at 7 
p.m. for free.
But Glover isn’t just a rapper.
The 29-year-old has been a 
member of the sketch comedy group “Derrick Comedy,” a writer 
for “30 Rock,” an actor on “Com-
munity,” a standup comedian and a movie star.
Gambino said he got his rap 
pseudonym when he typed his 
name into a Wu-Tang Clan name 
generator.
Tomorrow, Gambino will rap 
about everything from sex and fame to Spider-Man and his pen-
chant for Asian women.
Behind the lyrics is usually a 
pulsing electronic beat molded to 
match his high-pitched voice, but he’s been known to rap over in-die rock hits by artists Sleigh Bells, Grizzly Bear and Neon Indian, too.
Gambino recorded his first mu-
sic video to his song “Freaks and Geeks” off of his EP .
The video, which has more than 
11 million hits on YouTube, was di-rected by Dan Eckman.
Eckman has worked with Glov-
er since his days on Derrick Com-edy and and the group’s movie “Mystery Team,” which premiered 
in 2009.
The video shows Gambino 
dancing alone in a warehouse.
As usual, he doesn’t shy away 
from vulgarity:
“E.E. cumming on her face, yeah 
that’s poetry in motion.”
He graduated from New York 
University in 2006 with a degree in 
dramatic writing, and it shows.
“Took the ‘G’ out your waffle, 
all you got left is your ego.”
Listen for the single from his 
first studio album, “Bonfire” from “Camp.”
This hit is high-tempo through-
out. It starts with alarms and cuts 
right into his fast-paced and vulgar lyrics that are too good to deny.
In the song, he claims to be the 
best black actor who raps while 
gaining respect from other rap-
pers.
“Rap’s stepfather, yeah you hate 
me, but you will respect.”
And during the song, he shows 
he is OK with controversial lyrics.
“Made the beat then murdered 
it, Casey Anthony.”
Different from most Gambino 
songs, “B---h, look at me now” from 
his mixtape “I Am Just A Rapper,” 
covers Grizzly Bear’s song “Two Weeks,” an indie rock hit.
Gambino’s nasally lyrics shine 
through the free and happy rock 
song with a choir.
“I’ma try to make my street cred 
stack up. I mean I’m rapping over 
Grizzly Bear, what the f--k?”The song is an amalgam of one-
liners weaved together to create an amazing mash-up of indie rock and underground rap.
“These rappers need ER like 
their Charlie Park. Go hard like 
my suits made by Tony Stark. This 
kind of music makes your balls drop, Dick Clark.”
Gambino uses subtlety and raw 
emotion to create a track to chill with.
“I’ll always be childish. Call me 
Maggie Simpson.”
As soon as you lose sight of 
Gambino’s actual rap skill and think he’s full of sophomoric and 
cartoonish d--k jokes, he comes 
back with songs that showcase how much flow and intelligence he has.
Gambino felt inspired by Com-mon on his track entitled “I’m On It,” from his third independent al-bum, “Culdesac.”
The song, and the whole album, 
has a light and airy feel to it, with sincere lyrics about Glover’s life 
over the choir-like sentiments of 
the album.
Even if you aren’t a Childish 
Gambino poindexter, you should go to the concert — even if it rains.10, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 2012

James Cameron, Christopher Nolan, Mar -
tin Scorsese, George Lucas. These four leg-
endary directors are not just film industry innovators; they are four of the voices who help track the evolution of film in the new 
documentary “Side by Side.”
Directed by Chris Kenneally and produced 
by actor Keanu Reeves, the film premiered at 
this year’s Tribeca Film Festival to critical ac-claim. With interviews with film experts from every level, also conducted by Reeves, the documentary tracks the progression of how films are made and the impact that techno-
logical change has on not only film, but on 
its audience.
From directors to cinematographers, color -
ing artists to camera engineers, the documen-tary covers all of the bases to really indulge in the art of filmmaking. Tracking the history, piece by piece, from film’s initial (and costly) beginnings through its gradual shrinking into the digitized age, provides the commentators 
feedback with a mixture of fact and thought.
Each interview has its own “feel,” its 
own message . From Nolan and beyond, the 
subjects share their personal thoughts about whether film’s new hori-
zon is its new beginning 
or its final frontier. A grandiose topic, yes, but contrasting insights make it intriguing.
Mixing Robert Rodri-
guez’s pro-digital stance with the more old-fash-ioned cinematographers’ 
nostalgia about cutting film in the editing room makes “Side by Side” a weighty two-sided argument. Yet, with visual aids to illus-trate the constant expansion into digital for -mat, the passion for which all involved have 
for their craft is undeniable.
That passion is spread throughout every 
frame of the documentary, from the on-set 
examples of the changes digital editing pro-vides in movies like “Avatar,” to actors’ opin-ions about what it’s like to film in 10-minute increments versus 40-minute digital takes. It reinforces how powerful film is for both those behind the camera and in front of the screen.
“Side by Side” will play at the Hippo-
drome State Theatre Oct. 2. For more infor -

Spectators gather around artwork at F.L.A. Gallery, 10 N. Main St., during the open -
ing night of “Rewilding, F.L.A.,” the gallery’s first show. 
“Rewilding, F.L.A.” is on display
tinguishing theme. Orth’s pieces incorporated a 
citrus.
“I wanted to use citrus to represent the po-
tential or idealized version of Florida that is of-ten unrealized,” Orth said.
Orth’s contributions were also aligned with 
the exhibition’s overall nature aesthetic. His sec-tion of the space included drawings of flowers and various wildlife species.
Bowman’s time spent at a marina in St. Pe-
tersburg contributed to the water and optical illusions in her pieces for the exhibit. A mural covered a majority of her section and served as one of the exhibition’s more integral pieces.
Her progression of the water theme from 
piece to piece peaked the interest of guests like architecture senior John Richardson.
“Everyone is just trying to understand what 
the artist is trying to say ,” Richardson, 22, said. “Whether you’re wrong or right, you’re still asking questions that are making the imagina-tive side of your mind stronger.”
Orth said Fels’ hexagonal wood structures 
incorporated wood reclaimed from renova-tions on the gallery’s building neighbor, The Top. Fels’ work was placed near the center of 
the room, bridging the gap between Orth and 
Bowman’s respective walls.
Allison Garnsey , a second-year chemistry 
graduate student, noted the communal atmo-sphere at “Rewilding, F.L.A.”
“Gainesville is such a small, unique place, 
and it’s really cool to see these shows reiterate that,” Garnsey said.
Throughout the evening, people shuffled in 
and out of the gallery , compelled to stay by the 
allure of free food, a sociable atmosphere and 
walls adorned with decorative oranges.
“We are thrilled with the community sup-
port,” Orth said. “We had an amazing turnout for opening night — an auspicious beginning.”
He said the “Rewilding, F.L.A.” exhibition 
will run for six weeks. The next exhibition, “When Elephants Weep,” will be curated by Wendy Babcox. The show will incorporate ani-mal/human hybrid themes.
“It’s no different than going to a football 
game for the first time,” Julia Morrisroe, UF as-sociate professor of painting and drawing, said at the event. “You might be surprised at what 
you find interesting.”gALLery , from page 912, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 2012

Well, cold and flu season is

that means: For the next few months your life will resonate the general theme of a horror 
movie. Allow me to elaborate.
First, the general popula-

sallow. It’ll start moaning and shuffling everywhere on cam-pus, and your paranoia of the sickly will affect your social standing as you slowly earn the reputation of “that one 
guy who keeps running away 
screaming from people.”
Next, your friends will 
suggest you go camping un-til, one by one, they contract different variations of strep throat and the West Nile Vi-rus, leaving you to wonder if you’ll be next as you ap-
proach your darkened home 
and shout, “Hello? Hello? Is 
anybody there?”
Finally, unsettled with the 
state of the world around you, you’ll go to bed after a pre-
emptive swig of NyQuil, only 
to realize that Freddy Krue-ger will be waiting in your dreams to put his dirty, un-washed hands in your mouth, giving you a horrible strain 
of the rhinovirus and chronic 
halitosis.
But the greatest concern 
for the student population — aside from Freddy Krueger — is grades. Students ask: How can I keep my grades up when I’ve already pretended to be sick this semester so I could 
go to Miami to watch Dwayne 
Wade juggle chainsaws at a slam-dunk contest? Most people answer this question in a sensible way: Wash your hands, take your vitamins, avoid sick people, get rest. Well to that I say: Most people are idiots. In addition to aver -
age forms of prevention, here is a list of aggressive tactics for your health:
1. Attend local gun shows.Remember how healthy 
and germ-free your childhood was? Especially when your parents took you to the gun 
show? That’s because chil-
dren aren’t allowed to touch the guns. And there’s nothing more sterile and pure than a good old fashioned .38 that some wheezy old man has 
picked up and drooled on. 
Remember how cold the gun shows were? Do you think germs can survive in that en-vironment? You could have eaten ice cream off those guns. That’s how cold they were. In fact, some children did eat ice cream off the guns. The same 
one’s old men drooled on. The 
lesson here: If you want to boost your immune system, pick up your favorite flavor from the ice cream aisle and head to the nearest arms dis-
play.
2. Have a sick spouse? 
Dump him/her.
One of the biggest mistakes 
healthy people make is caring 
for the weak or sickly. Are you crazy? Why would you do that? The first thing you 
should do is assert your supe-
riority by publicly announcing your physical prowess to your family in a showy and trucu-lent manner. Rent a bullhorn, 
and stand outside their homes. Ha-rass them 
for hours for 
having per -
petuated in-ferior genes. 
It’s important for your own DNA to recognize its apti-tude for fighting germs. Once you’ve made your point, or once the police have removed 
you from the property, find 
your spouse and, in his or her weakened state, leave him or her. Say something mean and condescending like, “Look at you.” When he or she asks why, say it’s because you couldn’t bear to produce offspring that would inherit 
that immune system. Or don’t 
explain yourself. Just squint and say, “You know what you did.”
3. Buy a chicken.Did you know chickens 
are immune to the West Nile Virus? Yes, it’s true. They are. 
Who knows what else you 
can learn from them. Go buy a chicken, and convince the bird to teach you its secrets. Then when cold and flu sea-son passes, eat it. Before you do, say, “You know what you did.”
To keep colds at bay, it’s 
important to remain morally ambiguous.
4. Watch Medical Dramas, 
or attend a Tea Party rally.
Watching one season of 
“House” with Hugh Laurie is enough to make anybody nev-er want to see a doctor. Have 
you seen that show? People’s 
eyes explode. The same could be said of any event in which the Tea Party discusses univer -
sal health care, which equates to that scene in “Saw” where the captive saws his leg off. Scare yourself into health.
And that’s all there is to 
it. Follow those four simple steps, and for the rest of your life, you’ll look amazing with your shirt off. And you’ll nev-er get sick. You’re welcome.How to not die: Les -

All For You
Sister Hazel treated a packed Phillips Center for the Performing Arts to an extra long set-list at its Home-
town Show Friday night. Songs included classic fan-favorites like “All for You” and an acoustic version of “Champagne High,” which was played in the middle of the aisle next to audience members.

Medical drama fans have had a 
big whole in their hearts ever since 
“House” ended its final season last 
May. Luckily, this fall’s lineup adds 
a few new prescriptions that might 
fill the void.
“The Mob Doctor” stars Jordana 
Spiro as Grace Devlin, a young new doctor who made a deal with the mob to spare her brother’s life. From 
the gruesome opening scene to a 
near-deadly car chase, “The Mob Doctor” is guaranteed to get your 
heart racing. Fans of “The Sopra-
no’s” and “Grey’s Anatomy” alike should tune in to Fox every Monday 
at 9 p.m.
“The Mindy Project” debuted 
Tuesday to almost universally posi-tive reviews — as would be expected from a show thats lead actress/pro-ducer is fresh off the set of “The Of-
fice.” Mindy Kaling stars as Mindy 
Kahili, an OB-GYN with a success-
ful medical practice and a fruitless 
love life. Expect that to change early, 
as her co-stars 
include two at-
tractive doctors vying for her attention in the 
office and in the 
bedroom. Ro-mantic-comedy 
fanatics should 
tune in to Fox 
Tuesday at 9:30 p.m.
“Emily Owens, M.D.” stars Ma-
mie Gummer, daughter of Meryl Streep, in her first lead television role. The show’s extended preview 
features a “Mean Girls”-inspired se-quence in which Gummer’s charac-ter is schooled on the cliques in the 
hospital. “Emily Owens, M.D.” pre-
mieres Oct. 16 at 9 p.m. on the CW.
Finally , “Do No Harm” is the 
show with the highest expectations 
and the highest probable payoff. Steven Pasquale stars as Jason Cole, 
a doctor who has been taking ex-
perimental drugs to suppress his Mr. Hyde counterpart for years. But 
now, the drugs aren’t working and 
Ian Price comes out every night to wreak havoc on everything Jason 
Cole does. “Do No Harm” is set to 
appear as a midseason replacement on NBC.
One of these shows should do the 
trick to fulfill your medical drama cravings. If not, there’s always the tried and true “Grey’s Anatomy” on 
ABC every Thursday at 9 p.m.Medical dramas take over televsiontelevision

◗ “TINY FURNITURE” WAS WRITTEN BY 
“GIRLS” CREATOR LENA DUNHAM.
BAKR SALIQ
Avenue Writer
Lost in an endlessly growing queue and buried be-
neath thousands of rows of titles, there are a few hidden 
Netflix Gems.
“Tiny Furniture” (2010)NR
98 minutes, Comedy/Drama
Lena Dunham is a swirling mess of postgrad un-
certainty. While never depressing, the heavy malaise of having no clue of where to go after college is consis-tently a motif in the 26-year-old actor, writer and direc-tor’s repertoire. “Tiny Furniture” (directed and written by Dunham), which attracted enough attention to land her a role HBO’s “Girls,” is no exception.
Following graduation, Aura (played by Dunham), 
an aspiring filmmaker, moves back in with her mother and young overachieving sister. Aura can’t seem to find much help in her family or her free-spirited childhood friend Charlotte (Jemima Kirke from “Girls”).
Dunham’s characters can be summed up into two 
categories: men and women. Where the men are too cool or witty to be looked at as actual people, and the women are exaggerations of personalities, either very smart or very vivacious. If this were how every character acted fit into this film, it would be unbearable.
However, in the midst of these cool and funny guys, 
and these smart and fun girls is the protagonist, Aura. 
Who is never the best, most beautiful or coolest. She is 
just normal. An average girl who ap-
pears even more average as these over the top characters eclipse her. Most notably is the fact that Aura is very aware of her lame stock compared with the others in her life. This jux-taposition coupled with the protago-nist’s humor makes the film engaging 
and enjoyable.
“Tiny Furniture” is not very different from “Girls” 
in its approach to the difficulty of finding oneself after graduation, and the protagonist’s odd relationships with the men in her life. If you’ve watched and enjoyed “Girls,” “Tiny Furniture” isn’t going to disappoint.
Bonus awesome hidden movie you’ve already 
seen: “Kick Ass”  (2010)
With a sequel opening next year, now might be 
a good time to watch Chloë Grace Moretz impale baddies with a spear one more time.Hidden gems of Netflix: ‘Tiny Furniture’THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 13

you like to get some Mediocre Advice? Visit http://mediocreadvicegators.tumblr.com/ask
Dear Mediocre Advice,
My boyfriend and I have been boning for a 
while now, and he just started spending the night. I have really bad gas when I sleep, but he imagines girls as sweet / cute. I try to be, but my farts aren’t. Sometimes, the gas is so bad he wakes up and asks what the smell is. I blame it on the dog. Problem is, I don’t have a dog, but I bought a food and water bowl to keep up the lie. He just realized I don’t have a 
dog, and it’s been three weeks. What do I do?
Ariel Barnes
Dear Mediocre Advice,
I slept with a good friend once, and I regret it. I have a boyfriend who lives 3,000 miles away and 
expects me to move in with him. The sex with the friend was awkwardly terrible and didn’t mean anything to me. The boyfriend is amazing at sexy time. We love each other, and I don’t want to lose him. Should I confess my one-time mistake? And should I remain friends with my good friend, who 
still has feelings for me, to soften the blow of rejection?
Dear Friend,
Please never say “sexy time” again. You’re not a bad person, but you shouldn’t be with your boyfriend. Something made you screw around with 
your friend who you claim is awkwardly terrible in bed. Your boyfriend may expect you to move in with him, but you don’t want to. He isn’t someone you feel passionate enough about to move 3,000 miles for. Cheating is a clear indication that the relationship needs to end, whether you realize it now or later. It doesn’t matter if you tell your boyfriend, but it matters if you choose to stay with him. That’s a complicated choice that not even Me -
diocre Advice can make. As for the friend who apparently sucks at sex — if he really wants to be with you, you can’t play with his emotions. Make 
his life easier, and give him some space. Dear Friend,
There are a few simple explanations why 
guys just quit talking to girls. He probably just lost interest. It’s crappy that he didn’t give you a straight answer as to why you are no longer boning, but don’t let it bring you down. If you just want his attention, you could do a lot of dumb and embarrassing stuff, but I’m sure that’s not what you mean. Since you two are at the same bar all the time, it wouldn’t be weird for you to walk up to him and started a conversation. Worst case scenario: You have a dry conversation that ends awkwardly. Best case scenario: He goes home with you, and you piss off your neighbors with the noise. Make a 
move before too much time passes.Dear Mediocre Advice,
October is quickly approaching, and I need Hal -
loween costume ideas. I’m a girl, and in “Mean Girls” tradition, I want something a little slutty. 
Any suggestions?
Dear Friend,
Screw the “Mean Girls” tradition. Being slutty is the easy way out. Just take any costume, remove 50 percent of the clothing, and boom — it’s slutty. I did that freshman year. I tried to be a sexy ver -
sion of The Tin Man from “The Wizard of Oz,” and guess what — it looked awful. People thought I was a Hershey’s Kiss or an alien. Why don’t you be something cool and original, like a dinosaur, Quail Man/Dog, the ass-half of a horse, the moon or sun, a Mormon, one of the “Inglorious Bastards,” any Tarantino character, a superhero, Jessica Rabbit or Ryan Gosling’s abs? When I see a sexy version of a cop, nurse, doctor, firefighter, sailor or any actual respectable profession on Halloween, it makes me want to “boo.” Past a certain age at which you 
should know better, it just screams “daddy issues.”
Dear Friend,
You should buy a dog. Not only because you’re 
too deep in your lie, but because who doesn’t want the companionship of a dog? Dogs are bet -
ter than boyfriends, girlfriends and most people.  You should still tell your boyfriend the truth at some point. Until then, keep a window open and blame the outside smells if you really can’t own up to your unfortunate foul truth. For the long run, I highly recommend that you change your diet 
and Google “Why do my farts smell like sin?
”Dear Mediocre Advice,
I met a boy, and we were instantly 
attracted to one other. He seemed to really like me, but after two weeks, he stopped talking to me. Since this is Gainesville, I see him way too often. Also, he works/hangs at my favorite bar, and whenever I see him he com -
pletely ignores me. What should I do to 
get his attention back? THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 2012

Florida quarterback Jeff Driskel (6) attempts a pass while being hit by a UK 
defender during UF’s 38-0 win on Saturday in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium.
  JOE MORGAN
 Alligator Staff Writer
 
  The bye week seems to be 
the only thing that can slow Jeff 
Driskel. Since earning the start-
ing job against Bowling Green 
on Sept. 1, the sophomore quarterback has improved each week.
  After four games, Driskel 
ranks second in the Southeast-ern Conference with a 69.6 completion percentage.
  Driskel’s quick develop-
ment has played a major role in Florida’s 4-0 start this season. Offensive coordinator Brent Pease said the Oviedo native 
stands out among quarterbacks 
he has coached during his 22-year career.
  “Some of the guys I’ve 
worked with, he’s ahead of 
what they’ve done on a week-
to-week basis,” Pease said. “Sometimes, it’s maybe right on par. I don’t think he’s be-
hind anybody. Each week he’s 
done a better job.”
  While Driskel has impressed 
early, both he and UF coaches admitted that the 6-foot-4 quar-
terback needs to improve sev-
eral aspects of his game before playing LSU on Oct. 6.
  Driskel’s scrambling abil-
ity is one of his strengths, but 
it has created problems for the 
Gators at times this season,   of-ten resulting in sacks. Instead of getting rid of the ball when facing the pass rush, he would 
step out of bounds behind the 
line of scrimmage.
  The issue proved most 
prominent when Driskel ran out of bounds for a loss twice against Texas A&M, account-
ing for two of the eight sacks 
he took in Florida’s 20-17 vic-tory in College Station, Texas, on Sept. 8. 
Three days later, Pease said 
only two of the sacks were the result of poor protection by the offensive line.
  “That’s deﬁ  nitely just in-
stinct, I’m not watching the rush,” Driskel said of his ten-dency to scramble. “If you 
get caught watching the rush, 
you’re never going to be able to ﬁ  nd your receiver on time. If you look down at the rush and then look up at the receiv-
er, you’re going to be late and 
throwing into bad windows. So that’s just deﬁ  nitely an instinc-tive thing, and it’s just been 
something I’ve been doing the 
whole time I’ve been playing the game.”
  Driskel has been sacked 
three times since the Gators’ 
win against the Aggies, but 
Pease noted that Driskel’s pocket presence has improved.
  “One of the things I think 
he’s done a great job of is just his comfort zone in the pocket — trusting the protection,” Pease said. 
“Then starting to use his 
feet when he has to. He hasn’t mastered it by any means, but he’s gotten a lot better at it on a week-to-week basis.”
  Driskel added: “You’ve got 
to give the O-line trust, and you’ve got to trust them and be able to stand there and show them that they’re doing a nice 
job and giving me time. I felt  Driskel improving as year progresses
 �UF WIDE RECEIVER EARNING 
PRAISE FOR CONSISTENCY.
  ADAM PINCUS
 Alligator Staff Writer
 
  Redshirt sophomore wide receiver 
Quinton Dunbar is ﬁ  nally starting to 
catch on with the Gators. After two years as little more than a spring-prac-tice standout, Dunbar is second on the 
team with 10 receptions so far in 2012.
  He caught a 19-yard touchdown in 
double coverage against Kentucky on 
Saturday and  has become a more com-plete receiver this season.
  “He’s smiling (and) having fun,” 
Gators offensive coordinator Brent Pease said. “He’s making plays on third down (and) makes blocks. He’s out there to 
compete. He caught a touchdown pass. 
Any time you catch a touchdown pass, I’m sure you’re happy about that.”
  Dunbar entered his redshirt freshman 
season with coaches and teammates rav-ing about his ability . Unfortunately for the Gators, Dunbar’s size and speed 
didn’t translate into success on the ﬁ  eld.
  Dunbar had more than two re-
ceptions only once in 2011 — against 
Florida State on Nov . 26. He made his two touchdown catches in the ﬁ  nal two games of the regular season. 
  In four straight games against Ken-
tucky , Alabama, LSU and Auburn, he failed to record a catch.
  At 6 feet, 1 inch and 189 pounds, 
Dunbar is Florida’s tallest wide receiver to record a catch this season.
  He has three catches in three of Flor-
ida’s four games and has 26 more yards than he had at this point last season.
  “He’s getting a good feel,” Pease 
said. “And the thing about it is when that happens, with guys as young as 
they are, their personalities start to 
[come out]. When they have fun, but they’re still competing, you can see that that stuff carries over. When you’re not having fun and it’s not working, you’re  Dunbar assuming bigger roleEND OF GREGULATION
    Andre Debose grinned from ear to ear as he celebrated on EverBank Field at the end of the 2011 season. Florida had just 
beaten Ohio State 24-17 in the Gator Bowl, and Debose hoisted the Most Valuable Player tro-
phy high above his head. The hopes for his 2012 
campaign ﬂ  ew even higher. 
  Although Debose caught only one pass for 
9 yards in the Gator Bowl, his 99-yard kickoff return for a touchdown swung the game. The effort capped a season in which he averaged 27 yards per catch. That ﬁ  gure would’ve ranked second in the nation if he had caught enough passes to qualify. 
  But that’s partly the point: He didn’t have 
enough catches. In 12 games he caught only 16 passes, four of which went for touchdowns. 
  The common perception became that if 
quarterbacks targeted Debose more in 2012, he could become the playmaker Florida desper-ately wanted. 
  The new season is here, but those targets 
aren’t coming. And Will Muschamp is right for 
playing it that way . 
  Debose has rarely seen the ﬁ  eld on offense 
this season due to issues with consistency and 
intensity in practice.   Thirteen players 
on UF’s roster have a catch this season. Debose is not one of them. 
  In fact, he’s been 
targeted just once, a play-action bomb in Florida’s season open-
er that Jacoby Brissett overthrew. 
  Debose also has two carries. The ﬁ  rst was 
the opening play against Tennessee, but call-ing it a carry is misleading. Matt Jones took the handoff from Jeff Driskel and pitched the ball to Debose on the reverse. The ball bounced off 
of Debose’s hands, and he fell on the fumble to 
avoid disaster. 
  In the second quarter, Debose ran for 8 
yards on a jet sweep. He promptly returned to his spot on the bench. 
  Those three plays have been the extent of his 
offensive involvement this season. 
  Muschamp said Debose’s prolonged ab-
sence is a result of him not giving consistent 
effort. 
  Offensive coordinator Brent Pease said 
Debose’s ability to learn the playbook isn’t the  Benching Debose right move

Senior Holly King heads the ball in UF’s 3-0 win against 
FIU on Sept. 3. King has scored twice on headers.
LANDON WATNICK
Alligator Writer
Holly King likes to use her head.   
Two of the senior midfielder’s 
three goals this year have been head-
ers on set pieces. 
In only 10 matches, King has 
equaled her best single-season goal 
total at UF. 
“She’s pretty relentless,” coach 
Becky Burleigh said. 
“She’s going to try and find that 
ball and just get after it. … She’s not afraid to get in the trenches and get 
dirty.
“She’ll find a way to at least get a 
head on the ball, knock it down and 
give somebody a second chance if she 
doesn’t score directly.”
King’s goals on set pieces have 
sparked the Gators’ offense for three 
consecutive weekends.
The most recent came in No. 24 
Florida’s 4-1 win against Georgia on Sunday.
Off a right-side corner kick from 
sophomore Annie Speese, King leaned forward and redirected the ball into the net to give UF its first goal of the match in the 55th minute. 
The score ignited an offensive on-
slaught, as the Gators netted three more goals in a 25-minute span. 
“Once you get a goal in, it’s a lot 
easier to keep the goals rolling,” King 
said.
Against New 
Mexico and Au-
burn, King scored off free kicks from 
senior midfielder Jo Dragotta.
The Gators won both matches by a 
goal. 
“She wins probably 99.9 percent of 
any ball that comes near her,” Drag-otta said. “She’s a beast in the air.”
King did not head a goal in 2011, 
but three of her four scores during her first two seasons came courtesy of her forehead.  
In practice, the 5-foot-9 King works 
with Dragotta and Speese on execut-ing set pieces.
To improve her precision on head-
ers, King competes against 6-foot redshirt freshman teammate Lindsey 
Cooper in practice.
“I have someone with height that 
can jump probably higher than I can 
to work on my timing,” King said. 
She also said playing basketball for 
her first three years at Ashburn, Va., Broad Run High helped her time her liftoffs. 
King is the most dangerous aerial 
threat in the Southeastern Conference,  senior Erika Tymrak said. 
“Even in practice, she works her 
butt off to get every air ball,” Tymrak 
said. “If you don’t challenge her, she 
gets mad at you.”
Said King: “When the ball’s in the 
air, I don’t want anyone else to win it. For me, it’s just a mental thing.
“I don’t like losing as it is, so head 
balls are something I take person-ally.”Gators midfielder using headers to score

Betsy Smith first started to play volley-
ball in the summer before sixth grade. It 
wasn’t until the summer before her fresh-man year of high school that she knew 
she wanted to play for Florida. 
In 2004, the Atlanta native attended 
her first Gator Volleyball Camp with her teammates from Peachtree Corners, Ga., 
Wesleyan School.
“It’s actually a fate thing because I had 
signed up to come with my old school, and then in the middle of that spring [I] 
switched schools and they were coming 
to Florida’s volleyball camp as well,” 
Smith said.
“So regardless, I was going to be here. 
I was young, and I didn’t really know where I stood with other players my age, 
so it was fun to come out and compete with some really good girls.”
After her first camp at UF, Smith re-
turned each summer for the next eight years. The middle blocker credits the 
camps as a factor that led her to become 
a Gator.
“It got me to know Florida volley-
ball as a family,” Smith said. “I’ve been around a lot, and the familiarity with it really helped.” 
When Smith signed with Florida in 
2008, she was part of the nation’s No. 1 ranked recruiting class, according to 
PrepV olleyball.com. Smith was also the 
nation’s 26th-ranked recruit that year, 
with fellow UF commits Kelly Murphy , 
Cassandra Anderson and Colleen Ward ranking higher than her.
Despite her talent and familiarity with 
the Gators, Smith received a redshirt right 
before her freshman season.
“It was kind of a surprise for me,” 
Smith said. “I went through all of the two-
a-days and had no idea that I was going 
to be redshirted. It was right before the 
season actually started that we made that 
decision as a family, and with the coach-
ing staff, and it’s turned out to be a great 
decision for us.”
Smith didn’t let her coaches’ decision 
discourage her. 
Instead, she used the 2008 season to get 
stronger and improve. Smith regularly at-tended 6:30 a.m. workouts on Saturdays with strength coach Matt DeLancey to 
prepare for the 2009 season.
“She was part of that heralded recruit-
ing class and had to redshirt her freshman 
year,” coach Mary Wise said at UF’s me-dia day on Aug. 16. “She had to wait very 
patiently for her turn, but boy has she taken advantage of it.”
Fortunately for Florida, Smith returned 
this season for her fifth and final year. In addition to leading the six true freshmen, Smith is on her way to having one of her best seasons as a Gator with 61 kills, 16 
digs and 22 blocks in 33 sets.
“Coming in with that big class, I kind 
of wanted to graduate with them a little 
bit, but after the way last season went, I 
knew that I was going to be around for 
another season,” Smith said. “It was a lot 
of fun to play with these girls, and I didn’t 
want my last days with a Florida jersey on 
to be last season. I wanted another one.”

issue. Instead, it’s his inability to consistently do the 
little things in practice, like running hard through a route even if he’s covered or the play isn’t de-signed for him. The frustration and borderline an-ger was audible in Pease’s voice as he discussed 
Debose on Wednesday . He seemed to get louder 
and more incisive with every response, eventually saying the issue with Debose is one of trust.
Whatever the reason is, Muschamp putting his 
foot down is refreshing. Gone are the days when Percy Harvin reportedly did whatever he wanted during practice time, only to be the focal point of the offense on Saturdays. Muschamp is laying down the law, all part of the process to establish a 
tougher culture. 
“You’ve got to practice to play here now,” 
Muschamp said after Saturday’s game, with just 
enough emphasis on the ‘Now’ to make it clear he’s enacting a real shift in attitude and philoso-phy. 
With every snap Debose watches from the side-
lines with a towel draped over his head, the rest of the Gators gain a greater understanding of Mus-
champ’s willingness to practice what he preaches.

In addition to building trust with the offensive line 
during the bye week, Driskel plans to work on timing with the wide receivers. 
Pease said that the issue would likely be resolved 
with repetition of plays and increased familiarity with the playbook.
“The more snaps he continues to get, the better he 
is going to get,” coach Will Muschamp said. “He’s going to work hard at it. He is a cerebral guy. He is 
going to learn and work at it and watch the film and 
understand. He takes coaching very well. Again, the more snaps you get, the more opportunities you get, the game starts to slow down.”

probably not going to be doing it on Saturdays.”
Man down, man up: For linebacker Mike Taylor, more 
playing time means greater responsibility.
Taylor, a sophomore, has played more snaps since 
Jelani Jenkins suffered a broken right thumb against Texas A&M on Sept. 8. He recorded Florida’s lone in-terception by a linebacker this season against Kentucky with less than a minute remaining in the first half.
Against the Aggies, Taylor sacked quarterback John-
ny Manziel on the Gators’ 41 for a loss of nine yards, 
pushing Texas A&M out of field goal position with 20 
seconds remaining before halftime. Florida won the game 20-17.
Taylor, along with sophomore cornerback Loucheiz 
Purifoy , has impressed Gators defensive coordinator Dan Quinn with his ability to handle increased snaps.
“That’s an important thing that can’t be overlooked,” 
Quinn said. “I’m not going to let my other guys down 
here. I’m going to do it right and be on top of things.”
Two backs are better than one: When UF faces LSU on 
Oct. 6, the Tigers will do something the Gators haven’t 
seen much of this season. 
Florida’s previous four opponents ran either a spread offense or used mostly a one-back system.
The Tigers’ offense typically has a fullback accompa-
nying a running back. 
Quinn said that the Gators expect to see a two-back 
backfield substantially more against LSU than they have this season.
“(They are) certainly more tradi-
tional in the approach in the way they run the ball at LSU,” he said. “It has been unusual in the first couple ball 
games in SEC play of not seeing as 
much two-back, downhill run that this conference is certainly known 
for.”
Kenny Hilliard, Alfred Blue, Mi-
chael Ford and Spencer Ware help 
make up the Southeastern Conference’s second-ranked rushing offense. The four have gained a combined 889 rushing yards in 2012. 
With a two-back system, Florida can play more of its 
base defensive package instead of worrying about four-wide-receiver sets and a scrambling quarterback.
“It gives you an opportunity to go back and play 
some more of our traditional three-linebacker, four-down fronts,” Quinn said. “It’s been a higher percent-age of practice snaps in our nickel and dime packages.”
