While Tim Tebow and most of the other 
UF starters spent Saturday’s Orange and Blue 
Game on the sidelines, John Brantley gave 
Gators fans a glimpse of the future.
Brantley threw for 265 yards and three 
touchdowns and led the Orange squad to a 31-
21 victory.
“It’s really clicked for me that I can do this,” 
Brantley said. “Once Tebow leaves, and if I’m fortunate enough to get the starting job, I can run the show.”
Tebow was 7-for-9 passing for 83 yards and 
a touchdown for Blue in the first half, but he was replaced by Brantley, who quarterbacked both teams in the second.
A spring-game-record crowd of 65,000 came 
alive when Brantley opened the second half with a 50-yard touchdown pass to wide receiv-er Frankie Hammond Jr.
Hammond finished the game with 131 re-
ceiving yards and two touchdowns on just four 
catches.
The 6-foot-3, 217-pound Brantley made 
flashy plays with his arm, but it was his legs 
that caught teammates and coaches off guard.
The sophomore rushed for 45 yards on nine 
carries, including a 15-yard touchdown run with 15 seconds left in the first half.
“He’s not a running quarterback, but he can 
make plays,” Tebow said.
Meyer compared Brantley’s style of play to 
former Utah quarterback Alex Smith.
“He had a great spring,” offensive coordina-
tor Steve Addazio said. “You watch his pres-UF FOOTBALL

� TWO WOMEN WERE 
ROBBED AT GUNPOINT.
By KATIE EMMETS
Alligator Writer
Police are still searching for a 
man who robbed two women with 
a gun in a hotel parking lot Satur-
day night.
At about 11:30 p.m., a man 
walked up to the women, who were getting out of their car to go into 
the Hilton Hotel and Conference 
Center on Southwest 34th Street.
The man pointed a semiauto-
matic handgun at the 
women and demand-
ed that they give him their purses, a Uni-
versity of Florida Police release stated.
According to the release, when 
the women  gave him their purses, the man ran toward Southwest Ar-cher Road.
A UPD police dog followed 
the man as far as the Doyle Con-ner Building, 1911 S.W. 34th St., but couldn’t catch him, the release stated.
The suspect is described as a 
black man, 18 to 20 years old, about 6’2” and between 150 and 160 pounds.
He was wearing a black, hooded 
sweatshirt, black shorts and large loose-fitting shoes with the shoe-laces untied.
He was carrying a dark semiau-
tomatic handgun that had scratches on the barrel.

Broken bones and bruised flesh are as 
run-of-the-mill for the Roller Rebels as for 
the defensive line on a football team, but forget cleats and jerseys — these girls wear 
fuchsia fishnets and feather boas. 
The Gainesville Roller Rebels played 
their first home match of the season at Skate 
Station Sunday along with the Greater Jack-sonville Roller Derby.
The two crews divided into the Bar-
bies and the Goths, with members from Gainesville and Jacksonville on both teams. About 30 women make up the Roller 
Rebels, and President Catherine Seemann, whose derby name is Ms. Rebel, said the derby girls range in age from early twenties to mid-forties. 
“We have stay-at-home moms, profes-
sionals, students, teachers,” said Seemann, 31. “You can’t pigeon-hole these girls.” The match, which lasted an hour, consist-
ed of short “jams” where jammers plowed their way through blockers to get in the lead. When a team’s jammer reached the head of the pack, the jammer’s team received a 
point.
Blockers fended off jammers using their 
mid-sections to bump them out of the way.
Despite sticker-covered helmets and 
heavy padding, volunteer paramedics en-
tered the rink three times during the match to assist fallen derby girls, but no one was seriously injured.
About 400 fans watched from the “sui-
cide section” — denoted by signs that read, Goths defeat Barbies in derby match SEE FOOTBALL, p AGE 17

HOUSTON (AP) — Police filed intoxica-
tion manslaughter charges Sunday against a 
driver who lost control of his car while using a cell phone, plunging the vehicle into a rain-filled ditch and killing five children inside.
Chanton Jenkins, 32, was in police cus-
tody facing four counts of intoxication man-slaughter, one charge for each of the chil-dren found dead so far, said Houston police spokesman Kese Smith. Police said a relative told them Jenkins was the father of three of the victims.
Jenkins failed a field sobriety test fol-
lowing Saturday’s crash, which occurred after heavy rain turned the ditch into a tor-rent. The results of a blood alcohol test were pending, Smith said. It was unclear if Jenkins had an attorney.
The search was continuing for the miss-
ing victim, a 3-year-old girl. A dive team searched a bayou for the child Sunday after-noon, Smith said.Driver charged in Texas crash that killed 5 kids2, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, APRIL 20, 2009

“It takes cash to care,” Harvey 
said, noting a percentage of his 
merchandise sales go toward the foundation and his research in-stitute in Fort Lauderdale.
Harvey also made an appear-
ance at Florida Bookstore on Saturday, where fans of all ages 
lined up for nearly two hours to 
get his signature on shirts, hats and posters. 
“I like his take on conserva-
tion,” said Nina Gubin, a UF microbiology junior, who got her ticket from Friday’s speech signed. “His art is realistic and unique.”
Harvey, who grew up in Ja-
maica and has been impacted by the ocean since childhood, said in a phone interview he appreciated the following.
“I try to be authentic as possi-
ble,” Harvey said of his artwork, adding he wasn’t sure just what about his art enticed people. “I 
know a lot about the physiology 
and ecology of the animals. Fish-ermen appreciate that. ”
Harvey said his design for 
the 2008 National Championship commemorative shirt for the Gators was done months before the team took home a victory.
“We can hopefully do it again 
next year,” Harvey said, adding he would attend the Orange and Blue game, his first college foot-ball game, on Saturday.

Guy Harvey, world-re-
nowned marine life artist and water conservationist, will go to any depth for his inspiration.   
“I’m fiercely devoted to the 
sea,” Harvey said at the Uni-versity Auditorium on Friday as he spoke on marine life is-sues, such as overfishing and the declining shark population.  
Harvey, a former marine 
biology college professor, told the audience of about 130 dur-ing his 50-minute talk that 
“shark-finning,” or the removal 
of shark fins for an Asian soup delicacy known as “Shark Fin Soup,” has become a huge is-sue. 
“The demise of sharks is a 
problem that’s going to affect the rest of the ocean,” Harvey said, adding it is “very hard to 
ask people whose culture eats 
these animals to stop.”
As for overfishing, Harvey 
said there should  be a morato-rium on fishing certain species for at least four or five years to fight ocean depletion. He told the audience his restaurant chain does not serve grouper, 
adding other restaurants often 
use mystery fish as a substitu-tion.

“Sit here at your own risk. You may end 
up with a derby girl on your lap — and not in a fun way” — and cheered raucous-ly each time the girls breezed by as they orbited the rink. 
Some supported the Barbies, holding 
bright pink signs with phrases like “Ful-filling your fantasies since the 1930s,” and some supported the Goths, with phrases 
like “Goths do it best in the dark.”
The audience gaped as 
the Barbies and Goths pum-
meled into each other, their sparkling eye-
liner glinting in the strobe lights as they 
glided around the rink, often crashing to the ground before springing back to their feet and scrambling to catch up to the rest of the team.
The Goths won the bout with 146 points 
to the Barbies’ 97.
Seemann, who said the Roller Rebels 
practice about five hours a week in addi-
tion to individual conditioning, said it’s 
not about winning or losing.

DERBY , from page 1THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Despite a rap-
idly deteriorating housing market and 
plunging real estate values, Florida is ex-periencing an unprecedented number of requests to build new homes and develop 
commercial property.
The requests are coming from devel-
opers with an eye on a future real estate 
bubble, and those who don’t want to be hamstrung by the Hometown Democracy Amendment supporters are trying to put on the 2010 ballot that would give local res-idents the right to decide how land is used.
“Instinctively, most people would think 
there would be a slowdown,” said Mike McDaniel, a planner at the state’s Depart-ment of Community Affairs. “And it may be true at the other end, where the de-velopers apply for the (building) permit. But there’s been no letup here. It’s a gold rush.”
The Department of Community affairs 
approves and denies requests to change 
land usage.
Since 2007, it has 
received a staggering 
410,126 acres of pro-posed new projects, with 
a potential for 630,965 new homes and 479.5 million square feet of nonresidential space.
“This really catches 
me by surprise,” said 
David Denslow, a University of Florida economics professor. “I’ll have to revise my thinking.”
Not all plans submitted get approved, and not all plans approved will ever even-tually be built. But the tendency is to keep getting bigger even though that’s not al-ways the best idea, McDaniel says.
For example, state planners have turned 
back requests for 4,500 more houses in Pasco County, on the Gulf Coast. That’s be-cause the area already has 277,983 housing units approved but not already built.
Many of them are in Connerton, a new 
development where 8,400 lots in a new planned community sit vacant because of the housing meltdown. Only 230 fami-lies live there now, and further building is 
stalled.
Environmentalists say Florida needs to 
slow down, or risk building into another 
boom-and-bust cycle that lowers the val-ues of existing homes and further strains resources like water.
Developers still hungry for Fla. land

Nations boycott U.N. racism conference
� AT LEAST EIGHT WILL 
BOYCOTT THE EVENT.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
GENEVA — The United 
Nations opens its first global 
racism conference in eight years today with the U.S. and at least seven other countries 
boycotting the event out of con-
cern that Islamic countries will demand that it denounce Israel and ban criticism of Islam.
The administration of Presi-
dent Barack Obama announced Saturday that it would boycott “with regret” the weeklong meeting in Geneva, which al-ready is experiencing much of the bickering and political in-fighting that marred the 2001 
conference in Durban, South 
Africa.
The Netherlands, Germany 
and New Zealand announced their boycotts Sunday and Monday, while Australia, Can-ada, Israel and Italy already had said they would not attend.
“I would love to be involved 
in a useful conference that ad-dressed continuing issues of racism and discrimination around the globe,” Obama said in Trinidad on Sunday after attending the Summit of the Americas.
But he said the language 
of the U.N.’s draft declaration 
risked a reprise of Durban, dur-
ing which “folks expressed an-
tagonism t o w a r d Israel in ways that 
were often times completely hypocritical and counterpro-ductive.”
“We expressed in the run-up 
to this conference our concerns that if you adopted all of the language from 2001, that’s not something we can sign up for,” Obama said.
“Hopefully some concrete 
steps come out of the confer-ence that we can partner with 
other countries on to actually 
reduce discrimination around the globe, but this wasn’t an op-portunity to do it,” he said.
Some European countries 
are still deciding whether to attend the U.N. conference, which runs through April 24. Britain said it will send dip-
lomats, despite concerns the 
meeting could become a forum for Holocaust denial or anti-Semitic attacks.
NewsInternationalNewsLocal� THE FORMER U.S. SENATOR AND 
STATE GOVERNOR IS A UF GRAD.
 By CHELSEA KEENAN 
 Alligator Writer 
   
 Bob Graham may have been the governor 
of Florida and a U.S. Senator, but he was a 
Florida Gator ﬁ  rst.
“My ﬁ  rst encounter with the Gators oc-
curred exactly 46 days after I was born,” he said Friday afternoon to a crowd of about 25 in Pugh Hall.
Graham said his older half-brother, Phil, 
who was attending UF, gave him a stuffed cloth alligator for Christmas. 
Graham’s talk was part of the Samuel 
Proctor Lecture Series, a program that brings 
speakers to UF to talk about the university and 
the state’s history.
He spoke on UF’s history from the 1930s to 
the 1950s, adding personal family anecdotes to entertain the crowd. 
His brother Phil, who attended UF in 1932, 
pledged as a member of the Sigma Alpha Ep-silon Fraternity. 
Graham said his father took a spontane-
ous trip to Gainesville and stopped by the SAE House to see his son. But upon arrival, he found his son Phil passed out drunk in the bushes.
“That started a nine-month sabbatical for 
my brother from the University of Florida,” Graham said, adding Phil was put to work de-livering milk at 3 a.m. every day during that time.
“He came back and was a serious student,” 
he said. “He graduated on time with his class and went to Harvard law school.”
By the late 1940s, Graham said, UF had 
enrolled 19,000 students and become a co-ed institution. 
At this time, another older brother had re-
turned from the Second World War with intentions to attend 
Michigan State University.
But his father decided his son 
should attend school in the state 
where he grew up.
Graham said he took the same advice and  
attributed his political career to the friendships 
and connections he made while at UF. 
Graham said the 1950s was a wonderful 
time for the state of Florida as it transformed 
its traditional image as a poor, marginalized 
state.
He attributed the development of air condi-
tioning, mosquito control, retirement pension and commercial jets as agents that fundamen-tally changed Florida.
During this time, Graham met his wife, 
Adele.
It was the fall of 1956, when Graham was a 
UF sophomore, and he was leaving a meeting in Tigert Hall.  
“As I was leaving, I walked down the 
steps, and there was a stunningly beautiful brunette coming up the steps,” he said, add-
ing he found out she was looking for a tutor to 
help her with a class.
“As a southern gentleman, I wanted to alert 
her I had taken it the year before and would be willing to be her tutor,” he said. “She took my offer and has now been tutoring me for 52 years.” 
Graham said the nation and state are in a 
period of economic crisis and should follow 
President Barack Obama’s lead by doing what 
needs to be done to get through the crisis and to come out with a different economy. He said Florida needs to offer more efﬁ  -
cient, affordable health care, become less de-pendent on foreign oil and put more emphasis on education. He also said Florida needs to make a commitment to higher education so it can attain an intellectual economy.  
At the end of his speech, Graham said he is 
concerned about UF’s future.
“The Legislature is now debating if they are 
going to cut the budget $20 million or $70 mil-
lion,” he said. “President Machen announced 
yesterday what it would be if they cut it $70 million, and it is draconian.” 4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, APRIL 20, 2009

 At 15 years old, Tim Tebow 
found his passion for something 
greater than sports at Uncle Dick’s 
Home, an orphanage for young 
children in the Philippines.  
“After spending time with those 
kids, from that point on I knew my 
ultimate goal in life wasn’t about 
how many touchdowns I could score, whether I could make a lot of money or become famous — it was about taking all my blessings and 
trying to help these kids,” Tebow 
said.
He brought his mission to David 
Sinopoli, a UF alumnus, and for-
mer Student Body President Ryan 
Moseley, and the three thought of a powder puff tournament. 
In 2008, the birth of Student Government’s First and 15 pow-der puff tournament raised $10,000 for children in Gainesville and 
Uncle Dick’s Home. This year, the 
event raised more than 
$300,000.
The tournament 
took place Friday on Flavet Field. The win-
ners faced off in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium before the Orange and Blue Game, where Zeta Tau Alpha 
Sorority was crowned the cham-
pion.
“I knew it would end up grow-
ing this big, but I didn’t think in 
year two we would be this far,” 
Moseley said. “That’s a credit to a guy like Tim.”

 Gator Growl may be six months away, but 
preparation for the largest student-run pep 
rally in the world has already begun.
The early start stems from current produc-
er Matt Sloan’s desire to create a show that caters to both students and alumni.
“I want the 35-year-old Gator alum that 
has two kids to be as comfortable as the col-lege freshman that sees this as their Friday-night activity,” Sloan said.
In the past, he said, the event’s production 
team received feedback about the show after it was over, but this year they want to get 
opinions beforehand.
For the next two weeks, students will have 
the opportunity to submit suggestions related to the show and the acts they would most like 
to see by e-mailing talent@gatorgrowl.org.
The production team will use the sugge-
sions to help them create a student survey to help determine which acts the production team books. The survey will be ready in about 
a month.
“The student responses are weighted very 
highly because, when push comes to shove, this is Gator football pep rally,” Sloan said. 
Sloan said the acts should be chosen by 
the middle of the summer A term and will include recognizable household names in-
tended to bring Gator Growl attendees’ ex-citement to a whole new level. 
“We are under the assumption ... that this 
is the biggest year that Gator Growl has ever 
seen,” Sloan said, attribut-
ing the the pep rally’s im-
portance it’s celebration of UF’s national champion-
ship-winning athletes. 
The event’s role in ener-
gizing fans for the home-coming game is more im-
portant than the talent acts chosen, he said. 
“Our show, it’s really a pulse on the cam-
pus, a pulse on the football team,” Sloan said.
Gator Growl tickets will go on sale today 
to coincide with the ﬁ  rst day of the student football ticket lottery.
Student tickets are priced at $15, with 
general tickets being sold for $25. Sloan said ticket prices could increase, depending on the 
chosen acts. STUDENT LIFEGrowl begins preparation

ery parent’s worst nightmare would come to fruition. Thirteen deaths 
later, along with the suicide of the two gunmen, viewers across the nation religiously followed coverage offered in real-time by CNN — even grieving “alongside” the friends and family of the victims. But, like with any modern massacre, the media fell guilty to a gross fas-cination with the killers, deeply curious and inquisitive, wondering how two young teens could engage in such horrific behavior.
With the masses crying for ‘round-the-clock updates and schools 
around the country questioning their own safety, the media worked feverishly to meet the public’s insatiable demands. Peppering wide-eyed Americans with a bombardment of sounds and images, much of the media overload would prove to be inaccurate by new informa-tion reported in USA Today mere days ago. Back in ‘99, the media wrongfully framed Harris and Klebold as members of the “Trench-coat Mafia,” who in reality cut an image of normalcy in spite of previ-ous reports.  
In the wake of the massacre, students and teachers were sent 
into a frenzied fear — looking over their shoulders for anyone and everyone bearing any resemblance to the portrait of the two killers that was mistakenly painted by commentators and talking heads. As recent data revealed by the FBI dismissed the notion of a “loner” or “bully” profile for the two Columbine gunmen, the question must be raised asking what the federal government has done to prevent future school shootings over the course of the last 10 years. For the Editorial Board, a snap reaction to such an inquiry would a response of “nothing.”
With incidents such as Virginia Tech, Northern Illinois and Bing-
hamton (though outside the traditional classroom), an unspoken sense of fear exists in America questioning the safety of college and high school campuses across the country. The obvious answer to remedy the threat of future violence in the classroom would stem from the passage of federal legislation banning assault weapons — a solution currently being skirted by the Obama administration. 
According to an article in Newsweek, economic reform and uni-
versal health care have taken precedent over restricting guns — leav-ing $2 billion in stimulus package money for increased law enforce-ment to serve as but a small step in the right direction. 
Additionally, the fear of a strongly mounted lobbying effort by 
the National Rifle Association  has worked to deter efforts by staunch administration proponents of a weapon ban, such as Attorney Gen-eral Eric Holder and White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel. An extremely sensitive topic over the course of the first 100 days of Presi-dent Barack Obama’s term, the issue of banning assault weapons ex-
tends beyond schools and even international borders.
With a brutal drug war in Mexico currently claiming the lives of 
innumerable cartel members and innocents, a degree of culpability 
can be placed on the accessibility of guns across America. Acquiring an assault rifle in Mexico is as simple as having the necessary funds to pay one of the many smugglers bringing the guns across the bor-der from America. 
As bloodshed continues to stain the streets of locales such as Juar-
ez and Tijuana, we wonder how long “politics as usual” will continue to trump our country’s sense of moral accountability.
The 10-year journey from high-school teenager to 20-something 
knocking on the door of adulthood marks a decade of incredible change. For the 13 victims whose lives were cut far too short, dreams of college, companionship and family disappeared in the matter of an instant at the hands of two clinically sick individuals. Today and every April 20, we must solemnly reflect on the passing of the young men and women from Columbine High School and gain a deeper ap-
preciation for the countless blessings present in our own lives.
I have a story to tell.
Late November in 2008 a gentleman by the name 
of Ray Sansom was elected speaker of the Florida 
House of Representatives. Sansom, who represents the 
4th District, a stone’s throw from my hometown in the Florida Panhandle, was indicted last Friday by a grand jury for professional misconduct. Also indicted was Dr. Bob Richburg, the president of Northwest Florida State College, which — wouldn’t you know it — happens to also be located in the 4th District.
Representative Sansom is no longer speaker of the 
House. He resigned from that position after only a 
month on the job when allegations arose that he had 
funneled more than $35 million of state money to NFSC. On the day he was sworn in as the speaker, he was also officially hired by NFSC as a vice president of develop-
ment, a position with a $110,000 salary.
The indictment purported that Sansom’s college sal-
ary was paid for by some of the $35 million he steered 
toward the campus at Niceville, Fla. How convenient!
In a time when all Florida colleges and universities, 
including UF, are having hard times making ends meet, NFSC was doing quite well. 
Now, I tell that story to explain a much larger prob-
lem that’s growing every day: The death of newspa-pers.
See, newspapers aren’t doing so hot these days. The 
seemingly free information age has stolen advertising revenue at the hefty expense of newspapers. Who wants to advertise in the classifieds when there’s Craigslist and eBay? The problem with relying on simply CNN or Fox News is that they don’t have investigative jour-nalists who will uncover potential misuse of power and other “professional misconduct” at the local level.Sure, small newspapers may 
never have the capability or staff to launch exhaustive investiga-tions into the cases of corrup-tion, abuse of power and soci-ety’s other marginalized stories, but more and more regional pa-pers lack the resources to do so as well. Even when newspapers do launch investigations, the 
outcomes don’t catch a local community’s interest on 
the scale that a national scandal does.
We’re becoming a society that’s focusing more and 
more on the nation at large and less on the commu-
nity we immediately inhabit. The information age has shrunk the world, has even made it flat, as veteran New 
York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman has argued, 
but by shrinking a large part of town and even state 
culture, much has been lost.
There is local news. I know it’s hard to accept that 
fact when cable news channels endlessly drone on about Phil Spector, but there really is local news that affects every person’s life. There are other Sansoms and Dr. Richburgs in Florida. Anyone who has grown up in a small Florida town most likely knows of a shady de-veloper or two, and corrupt city council members and county commissioners do exist.
Of course the journalism industry will evolve. No 
one will allow credible local newsgatherers to simply disappear, but who will watch the Sansoms of the world in the meantime?
CNN and Fox News certainly aren’t.Matthew Christ is a political science freshman. His col-
umn appears on Mondays.

Letters to the Editor
Stimulus could ﬁ  x budget woes
 Bernie Machen is running the 
University of Florida into the 
ground.
Why undertake such radical bud-
get cuts and restructuring instead of 
using federal stimulus funds to cov-
er the shortfall? Rather, he intends to use the stimulus money to pay for his changes. It is not wise to take such drastic action until absolutely necessary. Like the stimulus funds, this recession will hopefully be tem-porary.
But there again, Machen is not 
the only problem. If UF is struggling, why does the Board of Trustees con-tinue to pay the exorbitant salary, and why did the trustees award him hefty performance bonuses last year, even in tough economic times then? Because Machen is doing ex-
actly what the Board of Trustees 
hired him to do: Restructure UF to a corporate model more concerned about UF’s bottom line than the quality of education it provides for its students.
But we can take this one step 
further: The trustees would not be worrying about UF’s bottom line if 
the Legislature better funded higher 
education. Florida ranks last in the U.S. in per capita spending on high-er education. Funding higher educa-tion will be the quickest way out of this recession.
Everyone, please write your leg-islators and governor and tell them to save higher education in Florida.

  SG overlooked existing service
 Providing a quality tutoring ser-
vice to all the students at UF is im-portant, and I don’t think anyone would disagree that it is a great idea for Student Government to promote 
tutoring; however, SG is supporting 
the wrong establishment. 
UF has its very own tutoring 
service: the Broward Tutoring Cen-ter (BTC). Students are able to go to www.teachingcenter.uﬂ  .edu and view who is tutoring what subjects and at what time slot they would be available. The BTC offers walk-in hours, private appointments, prac-
tice tests, exam reviews and discus-
sion sessions for all lower level math, science and English classes. 
Although most tutoring that 
concerns students is for lower level classes, BTC also offers tutors for a large portion of upper division classes. The best attribute of BTC is that it is completely free for all UF 
students.
Ethan Fieldman, one of Tutoring 
Zone’s owners, said, “This way tu-
toring becomes much more afford-able,” in reference to the new Fa-cebook application where students can check times and prices at which tutoring is provided. 
What is more affordable: free tu-
toring or an app that shows you tu-
toring costs? Even though BTC pro-
vides the same quality of tutoring as Tutoring Zone, Tutor Train, etc., they do not get the publicity they deserve. I don’t think that students enjoy paying for a question packet when they can get the same material for free at BTC, so I can only assume that they are not well-informed. 
SG should be teaming up with its 
own associated tutoring service that is free to its students, instead of pro-moting expensive outside services.

With his back straight, head 
tilted slightly and hands in “bear 
paw position,” with the thumb be-tween the middle and ring fingers, 
he picked a spot on the floor about 
three feet in front of him, closed his eyes slightly and concentrated on his breathing.
No other thoughts should enter 
the mind at this time, Greg Jones later said when discussing medita-tion. As the teacher of the introduc-tory meditation class at Gainesville 
Karma Thegsum Choling, Jones, 
who practices Tibetan Buddhism, said meditation has many out-comes. 
“You are able to build a little bit 
of space and take a step back from the situation,” he said.
The Sunday class’ five-minute 
meditation sessions begin and end 
with the chime of a gong. 
Baptized as a Methodist when 
he was younger, Jones said Christi-anity never fit him.
After exploring many religions, 
including that of the Cherokee Na-
tive American tribe, Jones found Buddhism five years ago, which he said made his life more centered. 
“I used to be known to fly off the 
handle and I’m also a bit ADD,” he said. “But now I’m able to focus on my tasks.”
Jones said he is now able to 
watch what is going on around him 
and ask himself, ”Is this really how 
I want to act? What I want to do?”
Jones said meditation is an active 
process that builds mental muscle.
There are many branches of Bud-
dhism, with each culture practicing slightly differently and “adding their own twist, turns and color.”
But they all believe that when a 
person dies, their spirit is reincar-nated, Jones said.
“You know the saying ‘been 
there done that?’” he asked. “Well, we’ll be there, and we’ll do it again.”
Lama David Bole, resident 
teacher at the Center, earned the title “lama,” which means teacher, 
by completing a three-year and 
three-month meditation retreat in Woodstock, N.Y.
He said that more than 25,000 
years ago, Siddhartha Gautama, born as a prince in northern India, founded Buddhism. Gautama, known to his followers as Buddha, resisted pressure from his father to 
take over the kingdom of Lumbini 
and decided to become a spiritual leader. Bole said that in the begin-ning, Buddha’s practices were self-torturing, but later in his spiritual journey, he created Middle-Way 
Buddhism.
“It is in the middle of being 
overly ascetic and extremely he-
donistic,” Bole said. “Being in the world, but not of it.”
Karma is also a main component of Buddhism.
“The Law of Karma is as 
straightforward as Newton’s Law of Gravity,” he said. “It is a natural outcome.”
Buddhists believe that for each 
action, one receives karmic seeds. If one does good deeds, he or she re-
ceives good karmic seeds, and bad 
deeds merit bad karmic seeds.
“Some people think that Karma 
is set in stone, but that’s not true,” he said. “We have our own free will.”

College students stocked 
up on biology, chemistry 
and calculus textbooks while mystery lovers chose be-tween 6,875  novels at the 
Friends of the Library book 
sale that started Saturday.
The sign “Welcome Book-
worms” greeted customers into a 15,000-square-foot 
warehouse filled with stacks 
of books and other items. 
The biannual sale offers 
more than 300,000 items,  
including classical litera-
ture, fiction and gardening books as well as CDs, VHS tapes, audiobooks and Play-boy magazines. Most prices 
range from 25 cents to $3.
The book sale will contin-
ue today and Tuesday, from 
noon to 8 p.m., and Wednes-
day until 6 p.m.
On Tuesday, items will be 
half-price. Wednesday, the 
final day of the sale, will be 10-cent day.Joan Curl, president of 
Friends of the Library, said 
organizers were worried that 
the turnout would be low be-cause of the recession.
But their worries quickly 
disappeared when they saw 
a huge crowd lining up near 
the entrance of the ware-house on Saturday.
She said 711 people came 
in first eight minutes, but af-ter that the exact number of customers was impossible to 
count. 
The proceeds from the 
event go to the Alachua County Library District. The 
event also funds numerous programs, such as Adult Literacy League Inc., and of-fers mini-grants to proposed 
projects.
More than $2 million was 
donated to the Alachua Li-brary District, said Margaret 
Wagener, a volunteer at the 
book sale.
Curl said Friends of the Li-
brary collects books through-
out the year from libraries, bookstores and Gainesville 
residents.
Liz Jones, volunteer chair-
woman of Friends of the Li-
brary, said some bookstores 
went out of business this 
year, donating their books, many of them in very good condition.
In the Collector’s Corner 
section, prices ranged from 
less than $2 to about $200 
for rare items, such as signed books, first editions of books, rare children’s books, post-
ers, Florida collections and 
maps. A poster signed by Tim Tebow was sold within hours.
Gainesville resident Beni-
to Veron, 68, said he has at-tended the book sale for five years.
“You look at people here 
and you can see in their eyes how much they love books and reading,” he said, stand-ing by a carton box filled 
with books, audio cassettes 
and CDs.8, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, APRIL 20, 2009

Scantily clad runners from the Great Underwear Dash cool off in the fountain near the Fine 
Arts College on Southwest 13th Street Friday night. At midnight, runners took off clothes they wanted to donate to charity and started running in their skivvies from Turlington Hall.
By JESSICA RONAY
Alligator Contributing Writer
About 200 students stripped to their 
skivvies at about midnight Friday af-
ter gathering on Turlington Plaza for the ninth biannual Great Underwear Dash.
After chanting UF cheers, such as 
“It’s great to be a Florida Gator,” stu-dents cast away their  clothing and be-gan counting down to the start of the run.  
Dash founder and UF alumnus 
Beau Bergeron said the event began in spring of 2005 and said he felt it helps promote a positive body image.
UF electrical engineering senior 
Christian Ramirez and his friends came ready to run wearing boxer briefs, Mexican sombreros and bandannas.         
For them, the dash is a proper fare-
well to their four years of college.
“We wanted to go out with a bang,” 
Ramirez said.
The dashers ran up the campus side 
of University Avenue, where they re-
ceived high-fives from people walking by and honks from passing cars.
After ending the sprint 
on Turlington Plaza at about 1 a.m., some students took a dip in the foun-tain near the College of Fine Arts, sing-ing, cheering and posing for pictures.
Clothes from the event will be do-
nated to Gainesville’s Salvation Army, according to event organizer Jorge Gomez.Coeds cast off clothes,

Mario Cavaradossi wasn’t sup-
posed to die, but when Tosca real-
ized the executioners’ bullets had 
been real, she also knew she was caught red-handed for murder.
When the officials came to take her away, she jumped from the top 
of the building, choosing rather to 
die than be captured and continue living without her love.
Then curtain and applause.
The second and final showing 
of “Tosca” was performed by UF 
faculty, students and staff in front of 1,022 people at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts Saturday. 
“I think the male performers are fabulous,” said Vibeke Vala, 
who said she’d seen this opera 10 
times, although it’s not her favor-ite.
Cavaradossi was played by 
Michael Austin, a Broadway performer who flew in only two weeks before the debut to rehearse with the cast.Danielle Porcellini, a sopho-
more and musical theater major at UF, said working with Austin was a wonderful opportunity.
“It’s so great working with 
professionals because you gain so much knowledge,” she said. “His professionalism rubbed off on all of us.”ON CAMpuS

The blows keep coming for 
the UF men’s basketball team.
Sophomore center Alex 
Tyus announced his intention 
to transfer from UF on Friday.
“Coach Donovan and I had 
a chance to talk about my fu-
ture, and we agreed on the 
best course of action,” Tyus said in a statement. “I want to thank my coaches, my team-mates and the fans at Florida. 
I enjoyed my two years here, 
and now I look forward to the next chapter of my life.”
Tyus was second on the 
team in scoring this season, av-eraging 12.5 points per game. He was the Gators’ only real option in the paint, bringing in a team-high 6.2 rebounds.
“Sometimes for guys, they 
want something different,” UF coach Billy Donovan said. “For Alex, I enjoyed coaching him for two years, but at the same point he wants to do things for 
himself. That’s a decision that 
he has to make on his own about what he wants.”The 6-foot-8 Tyus, a natural 
power forward, was forced to 
play center this season in the 
undersized UF frontcourt.
“As a coach, you know 
there is a certain vision and a certain path that’s necessary 
for the team going forward, 
and I think that Alex, that’s not really what he wanted to do,” Donovan said. “And I 
respect that. I wish him luck, 
and I hope he can get what he’s looking for.”
Tyus started all 36 games 
this season for the Gators and shot nearly 60 percent from the field.
He is the 10th Gator to 
transfer since the 2003-04 sea-son. Tyus’ decision to leave comes on the heels of Allan 
Chaney’s recent transfer as well as news that recruit De-
Shawn Painter has been re-
leased from the letter of intent 
he signed in November.
Although Tyus has not ad-
dressed the media since he an-nounced his decision to trans-
fer Friday, he dispelled some 
rumors through his Facebook page, writing that his decision had nothing to do with aca-
demic problems.
“I decided to transfer be-
cause i (sic) did not feel that 
I was going to get the oppur-tunity (sic) to become the best 
player I can be, along with a 
few other basketball factors,” Tyus said.
If Nick Calathes leaves for 
the NBA, UF will be without its two top scorers from last season.
“I don’t know what’s going 
to happen with Nick,” Dono-van said. 
“I think that Nick right 
now is certainly, probably not 
a clear-cut first-round draft 
pick. Now all that can change, and it changes over a period of time. I think Nick will go 
through the process and take 
a look at it.”Tyus becomes Gators’ 2nd 
transfer in two-week span
Cox Cable should be ashamed of it-
self.
Because on Saturday afternoon, 
there must have been absolutely nothing worth watching on television.
That’s the only way I can understand 
why 65,000 people — a spring-game re-
cord — showed up for the Orange and 
Blue Game  to watch a scrimmage that didn’t feature most of UF’s best players.
The entire starting defense stayed on 
the sideline, including Brandon Spikes. Running backs Jeff Demps and Emmanu-
el Moody didn’t play, and neither did the Gators’ best pass-
catcher, Aaron Her-nandez. 
The competition 
between the Orange and Blue teams was a joke, too. When 
Tim Tebow didn’t 
return to the game in the second half, John Brantley be-
came the quarterback for both squads.
The only thing I was remotely curious Spring game in need of makeover ■ GEORGIA WON ITS FIFTH 
STRAIGHT NATIONAL TITLE.

Cinderella just wasn’t feeling or-
ange and blue.
The No. 5 UF gymnastics team, run-
ning on a two-thirds-full tank of gas, 
finished fourth at the NCAA Cham-pionships in Lincoln, Neb., with a 196.725.
No. 1 Georgia won the national 
championship for the fifth straight year with a 197.825. 
The Gators team was depleted for 
its postseason meets but managed a 
third-place finish at the Southeastern Conference Championships and an 
NCAA Regional win to get to Lincoln.
“We feel that they performed better 
than they have ever at a national cham-
pionship as a team,” UF coach Rhonda 
Faehn said.
The Gators finished fourth for the 
second year in a row, this time with eight gymnasts af-ter four athletes — 
Amanda Castillo, 
Kailey Tissue, Re-bekah Zaiser and 
Nicole Ellis — suffered season-ending 
injuries.

ence in the pocket, his poise. 
“He took a shot under the 
chin and delivered a strike, all 
the signs and evidence of a guy that’s really developing into one 
heck of a football player.”
Walk-on running back Chris-
topher Scott was the big surprise 
on the ground. 
The junior rushed for 80 yards 
on 14 carries.
Scott spent two and a half 
years away from football while he was a student at Santa Fe Col-lege, but he walked on at UF in 
the spring of 2008.
He spent last season working 
as a strong safety on the scout 
team.
“I know when I first came out, 
I felt like I was one of those target 
dummies,” Scott said. “I remem-
ber going out there and being at 
practice, and I’m just on a knee 
half the time last year. This year, I’m in there on a lot of downs. (The coaches) just said they want to try to get me on the field wher-ever that’s at. I’m pretty much trying to earn their trust — and 
keep it.”
Hardly any of the big names 
made appearances Saturday. In 
all, 16 starters had the day off. The entire first-team defense was held out of the game, as was tight 
end Aaron Hernandez.
Tebow, receiver Deonte 
Thompson, running back Chris 
Rainey and three offensive line-men — Carl Johnson, James Wil-son and Marcus Gilbert — were 
the only first-team players to see 
the field.
“You can’t coach scared, but 
there were certain guys that I 
saw enough from (this spring),” Meyer said. GATORS RECEIVE FIRST RINGS: Before the game, players received one of the three rings they earned for their accomplishments last 
season. 
The team gets one for winning 
the SEC championship, another 
for winning the national champi-onship and a third from UF.
The ring they were given Sat-
urday — the one from the BCS 
— was silver with an orange-
and-blue “No. 1” etched between 
“National” and “Champions.”
“My arm’s already a little 
bit sore, and I’ve only had it on a couple of minutes,” Brantley said.Walk-on running back Scott finishes with game-high 80 yardsBy BRIAN STEELE

UF coach Urban Meyer made no secret 
of the fact that he loves freshman lineback-
er Jon Bostic after Saturday’s Orange and 
Blue Game.
In fact, Meyer said he had to be careful 
not to gush too much so he wouldn’t heap 
pressure on Bostic.
Bostic played safety in high school but 
was recruited as an inside linebacker for the Gators. 
Now, he has the inside track to replac-ing to Brandon Spikes and may even start next year.
Bostic had four tackles, including one 
impressive takedown of the speedy Chris 
Rainey in the open field, and one pass de-
flection that led to an interception on Sat-urday.
“My thoughts coming in were (to) just 
learn as much as I could my first year,” Bostic said. “If I had to redshirt, then red-shirt.”
That, Meyer said, is no longer an op-
tion.
“He’s playing,” Meyer said. “The red-
shirt’s gone. It’s now a battle for a starting spot at Florida.”
That’s high praise, considering the 
Gators still have linebackers Spikes, Ryan Stamper, Dustin Doe, A.J. Jones and Bran-
don Hicks — who all saw significant time last year.
“It’s actually come pretty 
quickly and kind of eas-
ily,” Bostic said. “When I 
watch something, I can turn around and do it the very 
next play.”
FULLBACKS BACK ON TRACK: A few weeks ago, Meyer thought his fullback play was “bordering on embarrassing.” There’s no reason to get red-faced anymore, though, when it comes to talking about that posi-
tion.
T.J. Pridemore and Rick Burgess caught 
touchdown passes in Saturday’s game and 
have shown great improvement in block-ing as well.
“When we were seeing some of the 
stuff (Meyer) said, it wasn’t personal,” Pridemore said. 
“I know he didn’t mean it personal, but 
it was personal at the same time. “We did 
have to have somebody step up. I feel like 
it’s a position that the coaches feel like that we have to have.”Bostic’s performance in spring game impresses Meyer

can be just as harmful to a team’s 
chances of winning as errors and home runs. 
It was the little things that caused 
UF (26-14, 10-8 Southeastern Confer-ence) to drop two of three to Missis-sippi (28-11, 11-7 SEC) this weekend in Gainesville.
After the Gators won Saturday’s 
game 8-4, the Rebels took Sunday’s matchup 5-3 on the legs of leadoff hitter Jordan Henry and the arm of 
starting pitcher Scott Bittle. 
“There’s no blame on any aspect 
of the team,” UF left ﬁ  elder Avery 
Barnes said. “Unfortunately, we just didn’t come out and get it done to-day.”
Henry drew four free passes and 
added a single in his ﬁ  fth at-bat, dis-rupting the Gators’ pitchers from 
the ﬁ  rst inning. 
The junior spark plug swiped 
three bags and scored 2 runs as Mis-sissippi became the ﬁ  rst SEC team to take a series from UF in McKethan 
Stadium this season. 
Freshman starter Alex Pan-
teliodis  (3-5, 4.04 ERA) walked Henry on four pitches in the ﬁ  rst and third innings, which set the tone for the game. 
In Henry’s ﬁ  rst 
at-bat, he stole 
second and third 
base, but Pan-teliodis was able to pitch out of the jam without allowing a run. The second walk, however, proved 
costly, as the Rebels’ next hitter, 
Kyle Henson, took Panteliodis deep 
to tie the game at 2-2. 
“The thing that’s disappointing 
is we walked six guys today,” UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “A.P. (had) two four-pitch walks, and that just can’t happen. That was the difference in the ballgame, in my opinion, because three of the walks 
scored and we lost by 2.”The other two walks that went on 
to score came in the ﬁ  fth, when Greg 
Larson put Henry on ﬁ  rst to start the inning and then intentionally walked Logan Power to put runners on the corners with one out. A wild pitch followed by a single was good enough to score both runners, and Mississippi took a 4-2 lead that held up for the rest of the game. 
The Rebels got a quality start from 
Bittle, who went six innings and al-lowed 3 runs. Bittle’s effort was the Rebels’ second strong outing of the weekend, as sophomore Drew Po-meranz turned in a complete-game, nine-strikeout gem in Friday night’s 6-2 victory. 
“That’s the best pitching staff 
we’ve seen so far,” O’Sullivan said.
The Gators were able to get to 
Bittle in the ﬁ  rst inning, when Dan-iel Pigott and Barnes each drew one-out walks and later scored on a single from Josh Adams and a bas-es-loaded walk from Teddy Foster. Home-plate umpire Randy Watkins had a tight zone throughout the 
game, and both coaches questioned balls and strikes at different points in the game.
TRACK PICKS UP 32 REGIONAL-QUAL-IFYING MARKS: After a week off, the UF track and ﬁ  eld teams continued their successful outdoor season in the War Eagle Invitational at Au-burn over the weekend. The Gators gathered eight wins and a total of 32 NCAA regional-qualifying marks in 
the two-day event. 
Leading the charge for UF was 
freshman distance runner Gen-
evieve LaCaze. She highlighted the ﬁ  rst day of competition by breaking UF’s freshman record with a win in the women’s 1,500-meter run.
She won the race in 4:20.90, best-
ing the previous school record of 
4:22.18 that she set on April 3 during 
the Florida Relays.
Having never competed in an in-
door meet before this season, it took LaCaze some time to adjust. But the outdoor season has put her in a fa-miliar environment.
UF coaches knew the potential 
LaCaze had when they recruited 
her, and they were not surprised by her performance this weekend.
“We are very excited about what 
she is doing, and we expect her to 
keep going in that same direction,” UF coach Mike Holloway said.
Another freshman, Christian 
Taylor, performed well for UF this weekend, picking up where he left off two weeks ago at the Florida Re-lays. Taylor won his ﬁ  rst outdoor 
long jump with a leap of 25 feet, 4 
inches, an NCAA regional-qualify-ing distance. He picked up another regional-qualifying mark when he ﬁ  nished sixth in the men’s 200-me-ter dash in a time of 20.91 seconds.
Also in the spotlight for UF this 
weekend was freshman sprinter Jeff Demps. Demps made his season 
debut in the men’s 100-meter dash, 
ﬁ  nishing sixth in 10.42 seconds.
“Jeff and I have talked. We’ve 
got a plan, and he’ll be ready when the championship season (begins),” Holloway said.
UF will head back to practice and 
make little tweaks in preparation for the Penn Relays on Thursday.

Francesca Enea found out the 
Gators won their second straight 
regular-season Southeastern Con-
ference title from an unusual source: the team’s bus driver, Tony.
Enea heard him chanting “SEC 
champs” in the stands alongside the 1,679 fans who showed up at 
Tiger Park on Saturday for No. 1 
UF’s doubleheader sweep of No. 18 LSU.
“We were like, ‘Why’s he chant-
ing that?’ Everyone was like, ‘Be-cause we just clinched the SEC,’” 
Enea said. 
The Gators (46-3, 23-1 SEC) shut 
out the Tigers (27-13-1, 10-9-1 SEC) in the three-game set this weekend 
in Baton Rouge, La. 
UF put up just 4 runs in Satur-
day’s doubleheader, and first base-man Ali Gardiner’s two home runs sparked the Gators at the plate Sun-
day, pushing them to a 12-0 mercy-
rule victory in Game 3.
After the Gators took down the 
Tigers 3-0 in Game 1 — coach Tim Walton’s first win at LSU — UF’s 1-0 win in Game 2 clinched the top 
seed in the SEC Tournament.
“I don’t think we really needed 
any more motivation to compete with LSU at their field because 
we’ve had a long history of not be-ing able to do so,” Gardiner said. 
“For us to be able to come and not 
just pull out one game but to win all three, it means a lot to us.”
For a team that set its sights on a 
national championship in the pre-season, winning the regular-season 
conference title is only one step on 
the road to Oklahoma City.
“We’re just working goal by 
goal, and we accomplished our first one today,” Gardiner said.
The Gators started out hot at the 
plate Saturday, as Enea’s 2-run shot 
to left field on the first pitch she saw 
gave the team an early lead.
UF had just two hits in the rest 
of Game 1, but Stacey Nelson (27-3, 0.41 ERA) got the win, pitching a complete-game shutout while only 
allowing five hits and walking one 
batter. Center fielder Michelle Moultrie 
drove in Corrie Brooks with a sac-rifice fly in the fourth for the only 
other run of the game. 
Tigers pitcher Brittany Mack 
held the Gators to just five hits in Game 2, but Stephanie Brombacher 
(19-0, 0.87 ERA) only gave up two in her six innings of work. Nelson 
finished the game out, striking out 
two and earning her third save of the season.
“They were really tough to hit,” 
Walton said. 
“Both pitchers did a great job 
staying ahead the whole time, and we played great defense behind them.”
Nelson returned to the circle 
Sunday, striking out seven and giv-ing up five hits in five innings. 
Unlike in the previous two 
games, though, her offense lit up the scoreboard. The Gators scored 6 
runs in the first two innings thanks 
to Gardiner’s two longballs and an error by Tigers shortstop Juliana 
Santos on an infield hit by Kristina 
Hilberth.
“We talk about if we can get to 
5 runs, that’s the magic number,” Walton said.  “Once you get to 5, things change. You don’t have to 
fight as much, you start to swing 
a little bit easier, and I think that’s what happened today.”uf softBAllGators claim second straight SEC regular-season title

ing accomplishment,” Melanie Sinclair said. 
Given the circumstances, Sinclair said the 
team was happy just to finish as high as it 
did. 
With one-third of the team unable to com-
pete, the workload increased for UF’s eight available gymnasts. Maranda Smith, Court-
ney Gladys and Elizabeth Mahlich were all 
promoted to all-around roles, joining estab-lished all-around competitors Corey Har-tung and Sinclair.
Hartung, a senior, ended her UF career 
with an all-around score of 39.6 on Friday in the Super Six competition. She tied her college best on floor exercise with a 9.95 and turned in a 9.9 on vault. She finished third on floor Saturday in the individual event title competition.
“Feels good to end that way,” Hartung 
said. “I could never have ended with a bet-ter NCAA (Championship meet) under my belt.”
She said the team was fueled by the idea 
of proving its doubters wrong and was de-
termined to not fold despite injuries.
“We want to prove to everybody that 
we can still be the best gymnastics team out 
there with what we have,” Hartung said.
Sinclair trailed Hartung closely and fin-
ished with a 39.4 in the all-around category. She also qualified for the individual uneven bars competition and finished seventh. Teammate Alicia Goodwin, who qualified for the bars final with a 9.775 on Friday, claimed third in the event. She posted a 9.9, just .025 shy of her college best.
“That was great to 
see, especially for her. It’s going to continue to help build her confi-dence. Three and a half weeks ago, she couldn’t 
walk,” Faehn said, refer-
encing the sprained knee Goodwin suffered 
in practice the week of the SEC Champion-ships.
Smith, who was the Gators’ top perform-
er in Session 1 of the NCAA Championships on Thursday, contributed consistent scores in the Super Six, including a 9.9 on floor.
After falling twice during her floor rou-tine Thursday, freshman Amy Ferguson re-bounded with a 9.825 floor score Friday.
Gladys was another dependable scorer 
for the Gators in the Super Six, never leav-
ing the 9.8-9.85 range. 
Ashley Kerr, who also filled in because 
of injuries, provided a fallback score of 9.6 
on vault after Mahlich hiccuped on her vault routine and posted a 9.45. Mahlich scored a 
9.8 on bars and a pair of 9.825s on balance 
beam and floor.
It wasn’t a first-place finish, but it wasn’t 
a fully healthy team, either.
“This team, without a doubt, accom-
plished something far greater than it ever could have imagined,” Faehn said. “We definitely feel, as a team, that this was a win-ning championship season for us.”
UF considers fourth-place finish successful because of injuries
about was seeing UF run some 
plays from the I-formation, but with Moody, Hernandez and half 
the offensive line out, what’s the 
point?
Outside of the Powder Puff 
game and 40-yard-dash competi-
tion, there was nothing going on 
that couldn’t be seen at a regular spring practice.
I felt bad for Urban Meyer 
during the game. Knowing The 
Swamp would be about two-
thirds full and with a roster at the same capacity because of injuries, he was faced with a dilemma.
How do you get some produc-
tive work in for your team with-out adding to the injury list, all while making it semi-interesting for fans?“I don’t want to apologize be-
cause it’s not my job to apologize, but I just want to tell The Gator 
Nation that (the attendance) was 
something else,” Meyer said. “We average more per spring game than most schools average per home game.”
In all seriousness, I admire the 
dedication of the fans. They knew they wouldn’t be seeing much of a contest due to the Gators’ in-
juries, but they showed up any-
way. 
The spring game will always 
draw a crowd because this time of year, people are starved for 
football. So why not reward that 
dedication with a little fun?
My favorite parts of the game 
were watching the kickers try 
62-yard field goals, punter Chas 
Henry taking on kicker Jonathan Phillips in the “Circle of Life” hitting drill (it was a push), see-ing Aaron Hernandez run the 40-yard dash against students and 
watching receiver Frankie Ham-
mond Jr. embarrass cornerback Adrian Bushell en route to a 50-yard touchdown.
The 40-yard dash competition 
is interesting because it shows how talented the football play-ers are compared to the rest of us, and that idea could be expanded 
into a really fun day. 
Run a quick scrimmage for one 
half, and then go into some skills 
competitions to show off what these guys are good at. Make the 
Pouncey twins commentate it.
Have Tebow and Brantley go 
head-to-head in accuracy compe-
titions. Make them throw at flying 
dinner plates like former Georgia 
quarterback Matt Stafford did on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon (Note: Stafford was great at it, all while wearing a sport coat). Also, see if one of them can throw a 
ball out of the stadium.
Hernandez dunked over the 
field goal post in practice last 
week, so have a celebration/dunk contest. Also, more Circle 
of Life drills. And Tebow and 
Spikes have to go against each other. Society demands it.
Run some one-on-one drills 
with receivers and corners, and see if Henry can punt into a kid-die pool from 50 yards away. Or have him kick at blindfolded teammates.
Kickers always get a bad rap 
for messing up, so line up Tebow and some other guys to try extra points and punt. Conversely, let 
Henry play quarterback for a se-
ries.
The Carl-Moore-to-Deonte-Thompson pass was cool, so di-vide the offense into two teams and have a trick-play competi-
tion. Involve Percy Harvin some-
how. He could use the good pub-licity.
Finally, I love the 40-yard dash 
competition, but no one is going 
to beat Chris Rainey. I want to see 
him race a horse. Or a panther.
That format would allow the 
team to practice but still give the 
fans a good show. 
Also, it’s guaranteed airtime 
on ESPN. Not that the Gators re-
ally need it, as the five minutes I watched of Alabama’s televised 
game featured more Tebow/
UF talk than anything about the Crimson Tide, but it couldn’t hurt.
That would be something 
worthy of televising. And worth going to.GYM , from page 16

Entering the postseason fresh off 
its worst performance of the year, 
the UF men’s golf team needed to regain the swagger it once had as a top-five team.
It did just that in the Southeast-
ern Conference Championships over the weekend. 
The No. 7 Gators finished the 
event in third place with a team score of 1 over par.
Senior Billy Horschel shot 10 un-
der par in the tournament to claim the individual title. After Saturday’s second round, his score was atop the leaderboard, and nobody could overtake him in Sunday’s final 
round.
“I knew if I played well, they 
would have to come chase me,” 
Horschel said.
Coach Buddy Alexander was 
glad to see one of his seniors play well in his last conference champi-onship.
“Billy played terrific golf,” Al-
exander said. “He wants to win an NCAA championship ring, but at least he already has a ring from play-ing as an individual in the SECs.”
While Horschel has been a con-
stant all season, the fifth spot in the lineup hasn’t.
Senior Will Strickler stepped up 
in that position over the weekend. He showed resilience, as he started the tournament with a score of 5 over par in the first five holes of the weekend but shot 1 under par the rest of the way.
“I think we are pretty set on the 
five guys we are going to use in the postseason,” Alexander said. “Will 
is one of those guys that I thought 
did a great job in battling.”
Although UF seemed to answer 
its lineup question, it didn’t answer the Georgia question.
For the third time this year, the 
Gators and the No. 1 Bulldogs par-ticipated in the same tournament, and for the third time this year, Georgia finished ahead of UF.
“Georgia is a very good team, 
and in order to beat them you have to be pretty close to perfect,” junior Tim McKenney said.
UF will have until May 14 to pre-
pare for the NCAA Regionals.WOMEN’S TENNIS KNOCKS OFF SOUTH CAROLINA:  The South Car-
olina women’s 
tennis team has not defeated UF since before Cal Ripken Jr. began his record streak of 2,632 consecu-tive games. That was in 1982, the same year 
Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” was released and the computer was named Time Magazine’s “Man of the Year.”
Sunday’s match was no differ-
ent, as the No. 16 Gators beat the No. 20 Gamecocks 4-2 to clinch a first-round bye in the Southeastern Conference Tournament. It wasn’t easy, though. At least 
not in the beginning.
After dropping a doubles match 
on Court 3, UF (13-7, 7-4 SEC) was in danger of giving up the first point. Marrit Boonstra and Jo Mather were down 6-5 before rattling off three consecutive games, leaving Jessica Alexander and Anastasia Revzina to clinch the doubles point. 
The crowd, Thornqvist said, 
is always a factor in Gators home matches.
“It’s what they call the ‘12th 
Man’ in football — clearly — play-ing at home, because I see our level of play go up a notch,” UF coach Ro-land Thornqvist said. “We’ve done a great job holding our matches. In 
doubles, we were in trouble on both 
courts (1 and 2) there for a while and dialed the right number at the end of both.”
The freshmen were the standouts 
of the match. Alexander claimed the team’s second point, breezing by Natasa Vuckovic 6-1, 6-2. Mather rallied back after being down 3-0 
and then 4-1 to beat Dijana Stojic 6-4, 
6-0. Mather and Stojic, also a fresh-man, had winning streaks of eight 
coming into the match.
Mather broke Stojic’s serve and, 
eventually, her spirit.
“She started out playing pretty 
well, and I kind of made a few mis-
takes,” Mather said. “But once I got through them, I don’t think she wanted to be out there anymore.”
Boonstra ended the dual match 
with a beautiful winner that fell just behind a backpedaling Gira Schofield, who had rushed the net. Freshman Barbara Pinterova was ahead 6-2, 5-5 in her match but did not finish after the Gators clinched the victory. Pinterova was suffer-ing cramps in her right leg but said she’ll be ready for the SEC Tourna-
ment on Friday. 
Thornqvist has been impressed 
with the first-year players all year.
“It took a while for a couple of 
them to settle down because this is 
their first time going through this grueling schedule that we have,” he said. “Every time you play, you’re playing someone almost as good as 
you or maybe sometimes better.”
