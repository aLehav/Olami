The UF men’s club rugby team is heading 
to Philadelphia to compete against the top 
collegiate rugby programs in the nation this weekend.
The team will play in the USA Sevens Col-
legiate Rugby Championship. It will be broad-cast on NBC Sports, and UF’s team is sched-uled to compete against Life University, the University of Delaware and the University of Texas.“It’s the biggest chance we have to let peo-
ple know who we are and that we’re a serious contender nationally,” said 22-year-old UF journalism alumnus Stephen Sheehan. 
If UF’s team is one of the top two to come 
out of its pool, the team will continue into the championship round Sunday. Last year, the team walked away with the Challenger’s Cup.
“We felt we could win last year, and we 
know we can win this time,” said 21-year-old UF health science junior and team president Joseph Migliore.The style of rugby being played is called 7s, 
which is a hard-hitting, fast-paced game with two seven-minute halves and seven people per team. 
“I think the team we want to beat the most 
this year is Delaware because they beat us by one try last year in what we thought was a bad call,” said 20-year-old UF business junior Ryan Gilbert.
Migliore said each match will be tough. But 
the team has watched their competitors’ game tapes from previous years and practiced meth-ods to overcome them.
“Our camaraderie is probably our great-
est strength,” Gilbert said. “If the person next to you on the ﬁ  eld isn’t there to support you, you’re going to get hurt. So we depend on each other.” 
Twelve of UF’s most competitive players 
are going to Philadelphia for the champion-ship. Here in Gainesville, the team members practiced two and a half hours four days a

On Thursday, the Boy 
Scouts of America lifted a 
longtime ban and voted to al-low openly gay youths to join the association. 
But for many the decision 
was bittersweet — openly gay scout leaders are still banned.
“The resolution also rein-
forces that Scouting is a youth program, and any sexual con-duct, whether heterosexual or homosexual, by youth of Scouting age is contrary to the virtues of Scouting,” ac-cording to the news release. “A change to the current membership policy for adult leaders was not under con-sideration; thus, the policy for adults remains in place.”
Joseph Antonelli, 70, 
founder and president of Gainesville Community Al-liance, said allowing in gay youth is a step in the right direction, but forbidding gay adults sends the wrong mes-sage to children.
Antonelli said it was wrong 
for a scout to have to feel like his two gay dads are inappro-priate or not good enough to be scout leaders.
“I think that’s completely 
B.S.,” he said. “And I don’t mean Boy Scout.”
Although he was happy Gay Boy Scouts OK, 
but leaders notNBC Sports will broadcast it“Our camaraderie is probably 
our greatest strength. If the person 
next to you on the ﬁ  eld isn’t there 
to support you, you’re going to get 
hurt. So we depend on each other.”

Gainesville’s new mayor, Ed Braddy, took ofﬁ  ce at a 
special meeting of the City Commission on Thursday after-
noon.
Braddy defeated two-year incumbent Craig Lowe in a 
runoff city election April 16. 
Former Mayor Craig Lowe said he views his time in of-ﬁ  ce as positive and productive.
“Over the last two years I was in ofﬁ  ce, 
we deﬁ  nitely set Gainesville on a great trajectory in respect to equal opportunity, environmental protection and economic development,” he said. 
Lowe said he will continue investing in 
the community. 
“I will always be looking for ways to 
have a positive impact on Gainesville and 
the surrounding community,” he said. Braddy said his ﬁ  rst days in ofﬁ  ce have been low-key: 
The city was closed Friday and Monday for Memorial Day.
“There’s really been no business in the city,” he said. Braddy’s ﬁ  rst major acts as mayor will come Wednesday 
and Thursday at two meetings: one to address the Butler Plaza expansion and the other to discuss arbitration of the biomass contract. 
“Those will be the ﬁ  rst big meetings I have as mayor of 
Gainesville,” he said. “I think so far, so good. We’re only less than a week into it.”

Surgeons remove tiger’s basketball-sized hairball 
CLEARWATER — It’s 
not unusual for a cat to get a hairball, but a 400-pound tiger needed help from veterinary surgeons in Florida when he couldn’t hack up a basketball-size hairball by himself.
The 17-year-old tiger named 
Ty underwent the procedure Wednesday at a veterinary center in Clearwater. Doctors said in a statement that they safely removed the 4-pound obstruction from Ty’s stomach.The tiger, which is cared 
for by Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation in Seminole, was brought to veterinarians after not eating for nearly two weeks. Vernon Yates, whose nonprofit regularly assists law enforcement agencies with seized animals, said Ty is doing fine.
Police: ‘Thong Cape Scooter Man’ not breaking law 
MADISON, Wis. — A man 
who wears thong underwear and a cape while riding his scooter through Wisconsin’s capital city isn’t breaking any laws.
Earlier this month, staff at 
John F. Kennedy Elementary School called authorities after the man rode by while students were walking to a bus. 
Police spokesman Joel DeSpain 
said the Thong Cape Scooter Man admitted he used poor judgment in going past the school but said he did it unintentionally.
So it seems Thong Cape 
Scooter Man is free to ride on.

Gay Movie Night
On Friday at 7:30 p.m., the Pride Community Center at 3131 NW 13th St. will host Gay Movie Night with a showing of “Touch of Pink.” The movie is a comic clash of cultures, values and sexuality. Alim seems to have it all: a great career, a handsome boyfriend and a personal guide in the spirit of Cary Grant. And living thousands of miles from his mother Nuru and his family in Toronto, he can keep his lifestyle hidden. But when Alim’s conservative mom pays an impromptu visit, with the intention of dragging her son to a big, fat monsoon wedding and getting him matched up with a “nice girl,” the spirit of Cary Grant suddenly becomes indispensable. Gay Movie Night is a free service of the Pride Community Center of North Central Florida. A $2 donation is requested to cover the cost of snacks.  For more

about the progress, Anto-
nelli said the acceptance of gay adults by the historically conservative association will likely not come in the imme-diate future.
The Boy Scouts of America 
said its mission would not be sacrificed and there are no plans for further review on the matter.
“Going forward, our 
Scouting family will continue to focus on reaching and serv-ing youth in order to help them grow into good, strong citizens,” the news release said. “America’s youth need Scouting, and by focusing on the goals that unite us, we can continue to accomplish incredible things for young people and the communities we serve.”
However, Antonelli said if 
leaders are teaching the boys integrity, honesty and to be good people, it is time to come to grips with full equality.
Sterling Davenport, a UF 
alumnus and Eagle Scout, came out to his parents in 2012. He said he was sur-prised and happy about the lifted ban.
Because the Boy Scouts of 
America are funded largely by conservative organiza-tions, Davenport said it was a courageous decision. It takes effect Jan. 1.
Although he said the deci-
sion was a step forward, Dav-enport said the battle hasn’t been won.
“It’s a nice idea to let the 
youth in,” the 24-year-old said. “But to let them in and tell them it’s not okay once they turn 18 is not the right message to send.”
As a gay man, Davenport 
said he wasn’t the model Boy Scout in the eye of the associa-tion.
“I felt like I earned my rank 
and I wear it proudly, but I felt like I had to do it by hiding a part of myself,” he said. “I don’t want any other youth to feel like they have to hide who they are to learn lessons about doing service to others.”

and worked out in their spare time.
“The team is in better shape than 
ever before,” said Laurence Kidd, a 19-year-old UF international studies junior. ”We think that we’re peaking at the right time.”
In order for UF’s team to com-
pete in the championship, it needed to pay $10,000. Team members sold $35 tickets to help raise that money.
Head coach Ken Simmons said 
even though the boys only have four returning players to this year’s championship, the team stands a chance against Delaware and Life, which are two of the toughest teams in the country. 
“We’ve got the talent. We’ve got 
the tools,” Simmons said. ”Now we need the win.”

Residents and veterans stood among 
grave markers at Forest Meadows Cemetery 
on Southeast Hawthorne Road on Monday. Silent respect hung in the air as community members spoke in honor of fallen soldiers at a city-organized Memorial Day celebration where about 200 people attended. 
U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho, the keynote speaker, 
reminded residents about the roots of Me-morial Day, which was started in 1868 by Gen. John A. Logan to remember the fallen after the Civil War. 
“It is that service and sacrifice that you 
and all veterans have given to this great nation that has made the country what we have today,” Yoho said in his speech.
Other speakers included local Army vet-
eran Ray Davis, who wore a replica uniform and three-cornered hat inspired by a pattern worn by George Washington. 
“The people out here today that we are honoring are the backbone of this nation,” Davis said. “It’s the veterans that gave us the freedom of speech. It’s the veterans that gave us the freedom of press.” 
Students from the Milton Lewis Young Marines presented the colors at the ceremo-ny and laid a wreath on a tombstone memo-rial. 
Skylar Keller, who has participated in the 
program for five years, was one of them. 
Keller said she enjoys interacting with 
members of the military, and she joined the the program to feel closer to a family mem-ber in uniform. 
“My uncle was fighting in Afghanistan 
when I told my parents, ‘I wish I could be out there with him,’” she said.

A Newberry man was arrested 
just before 3 a.m. Monday after he 
was pulled over in his gray Nissan Altima for driving without his headlights on. 
When Jonathan McCloud, 28, 
stepped out of the car, he presented the Alachua County Sheriff’s officer with a Florida identification card, according to the report. 
In the car, the officer found a 
cellphone-shaped flask with peach vodka in it, rolling papers and “a little bit of weed” in McCloud’s center console.
McCloud was driving with a 
suspended habitual traffic offender license and said he had been smoking marijuana about an hour before, according to the police report. 
McCloud was 
charged with t h i r d - d e g r e e felony of a moving traffic violation, f i r s t - d e g r e e m i s d e m e a n o r of possession of marijuana less 
than 20 grams and first-degree misdemeanor of drug equipment possession.
A homeless man was arrested 
at about 10 a.m. Sunday when an ASO officer spotted him begging roadside.
He held a sign that read  “God 
Bless Vet Homeless Anything Helps” on Archer Road near the I-75 overpass, according to the report.
Edward Nielsen, 49, was charged with panhandling and solicitation and booked into Alachua County Jail that morning and was later released. 
A Gainesville woman was 
arrested Sunday at the Northeast 12th Avenue Super Walmart after leaving the store without paying for her items, according to the report.
Tywanna Wilson, 29, left the 
store with 14 items, valued at about $57, and was stopped by an employee trained to watch for shoplifters.
After she was read her Miranda 
Rights, Wilson said she “had never done anything like this before,” according to the report. 
She was charged with the 
misdemeanor of petit retail theft.

Peach vodka, panhandling and 
retail theft: the weekend in crimeMay 26, 1964
A two-month reel of pranks between UF and FSU 
ended when the flesh-and-blood Albert the Alliga-tor was returned to his home at the base of Century Tower. An alligator had been found chained to an FSU flag pole, covered in white paint and bearing a sign that read “Yeh FSU — Go to Hell Gators.” The Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission deemed the unidentified gator an Albert imposter and freed the gator. Shortly after, the commission was notified that the freed gator was in fact Albert.

Two Gainesville men were indicted for involve-
ment in a drug conspiracy, including supplying UF athletes with cocaine. An attorney said most of the athletes receiving drugs were football players. The drug conspiracy ring began in early 1987 and brought more than 300 kilograms of cocaine to Gainesville from South Florida.

Watermelon crops were late this year because of a season of staggering weather patterns. The fruit was in ample supply in South Florida by Memorial Day, but melon growth limped on in Gainesville. Consumer demand for cut-up melons in supermar-kets was steadily rising, according to a UF Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences professor. 
May 27, 2003Craig Lowe took office a week ago from this date 
and was still unpacking. He was the first openly gay man to be elected to Gainesville City Commission. Lowe was banking on the student vote to get him through the narrow election.
 
May 29, 2008A report revealed that UF had about $131 million 
of untapped funds at the end of the previous fiscal year. The bulky rainy-day fund could not be used to offset the nearly $47 million budget crunch due in the summer. The reserves were not used to prevent UF faculty and staff layoffs, but for other projects.

For its newest exhibition, the Samuel P. Harn Mu-
seum of Art is pulling from all of its artistic assets.
“Much Ado About Portraits,” which opens today, 
features more than 100 paintings, sculptures, photo-
graphs and other works from more than 2,000 years ago — all to show the importance and meaning of por-traits.
The exhibition is the first to incorporate works from 
all five of the museum’s main collecting areas, which include African, Asian, modern and contemporary art and also photography.
The exhibition also includes 14 loans from other pri-
vate collections and a video collection of works from high school artists in the five different counties in Flor-ida, said the lead curator of the exhibition, Jason Steu-ber.
To create a comprehensive exhibition of portraits, 
the museum had to first define “portrait.” 
Steuber said he found at least 60 definitions on the 
idea of portraiture, the art of creating portraits, in an art dictionary.
“We decided we just wanted it to be a portrait of the 
human being,” he said. “Our portraits deal with the hu-man body, which includes either the full body, a hand, a foot or the full face.”
Notable works in the exhibition include a photo-
graph by pop art pioneer Andy Warhol and a painting by Belgian surrealist René Magritte.
Steuber said portraits are an important part of ev-
eryday life, even if people don’t realize it.
“We want people to realize that you have photos 
on your phone, your computer and your license, and they’re all portraits, but they all have different mean-ings,” he said. “It’s simple yet complex.”
Richard Heipp, director of UF’s School of Art + Art 
History, has an airbrush painting featured in the exhi-bition. 
He said the exhibition’s wide scope is fascinating.“It certainly has expanded the way I think about 
portraiture,” he said.
“Much Ado About Portraits” will run through Sept. 
8 and include several events in June. Admission is free for all guests.Portrait exhibit

Cody Wilson, a contemporary revolutionary
Cody Wilson is a 25-year-old University of Texas law 
student, self-proclaimed market anarchist and co-founder of the arms manufacturing company Defense 
Distributed. The company has managed to set itself apart from other arms manufacturers because its fully functional handguns and semi-automatic rifle components are available for free to anyone with an Internet connection and access to a 3-D printer. With the advent of 3-D printable firearms and the mass distribution of them via Internet downloads, Wil-son has been dubbed one of the “15 Most Dangerous People in the World” by www.wired.com and National Security blog, Danger Room. The only people who should really con-sider Wilson and company dangerous are law makers and anti-gun enthusiast on Capitol Hill.
In wake of the 16 mass shootings that took place in 2012, 
President Barack Obama initiated 23 executive actions aimed at curbing gun violence, including universal background checks, increased regulation of large capacity magazines and a resurrection of the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban. Despite mounting evidence that gun laws do not curb gun violence, such as the Center for Disease Control’s dubbing of 51 con-trol initiates as “insufficient,” politicians still vehemently strive to violate the Second Amendment and destroy private property rights.
The way Wilson’s firearms are manufactured is the source 
of all the controversy surrounding them. Wilson and com-pany have utilized 3-D printers and thermoplastics to make fully functional, nonmetallic firearms available to anyone and are completely untraceable by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives since they can be manu-factured at home without a serial number.
Politicians such as U.S. Rep. Steve Israel proclaim that 
mass production of these nonmetallic firearms increase the likelihood of terrorists bringing these firearms onto planes and calls for an extension of the Undetectable Firearms Act that bans all firearms not detectable by metal detectors. Yet the Transportation Security Administration currently em-ploys Advanced Imaging Technology that can “safely screen passengers for metallic and nonmetallic threats” and is used in more than 160 airports nationwide, according to its web-site. Israel’s blatant ignorance and campaign against Wilson and De-fense Distributed is a testament to the states’ desire to legislatively thwart technological, societal and 
political progress.
While Republicans and Democrats spew age-old gun 
control rhetoric at one another, Wilson has managed to transcend the left versus right political paradigm and add a new dimension to the gun control debate. The idea that any new firearm legislation is initially void due to Wilson’s ac-complishments and the issue of intellectual property rights regarding the free distribution of firearms has opened a po-litical Pandora’s box.
Wilson has put the spotlight on the striking authoritarian 
similarities between the left and right and feels that Ameri-can politics have grown stagnant. In an interview with Glenn Beck, Wilson stated, “I don’t believe in Romney vs. Obama. I believe in real politics. That is a real political act, giving you a magazine and telling you that no one can take that away. That wasn’t true maybe two weeks ago.” 
Wilson has become the poster boy for the idea that we 
have not come to the final political paradigm and that the state cannot halt human progress. Technological advance-ment will always circumvent state-imposed prohibition and Defense Distributed in the personification of that idea.     
Defense Distributed has produced a multitude of firearm 
components and a fully functional handgun dubbed “The Liberator.” They have also produced 3-D printable 30 round AK-47 and AR-15 magazines nicknamed “The Feinstein” and “The Cuomo” respectively in ode to the two anti-liberty politicians.
Cody Wilson has successfully spearheaded the pro-liber-
ty movement, transcended worn out left wing versus right wing rhetoric and has brought about an international politi-cal shift. Wilson is the greatest example of a modern political revolutionary and has done more for political and techno-logical progress than any suit and tie in Washington.  
T. Emmett Ryan is a Santa Fe political science sophomore. His 
columns appear Tuesdays.On Wednesday, Attorney General Eric Holder made 
the Obama administration’s first public acknowl-edgement of the killing of American citizens by 
drone strike. 
This announcement, via letter, was sent out only a day 
before the president was set to give a speech on defense, specifically addressing drone use.
In the letter, Holder admits to Congress that four Amer-
icans have been killed by U.S. drone strikes since 2009. Three of these citizens were “not specifically targeted.” 
One of those killed, Jude Kenan Mohammed, was still 
on an FBI wanted poster even though he was said to have been killed in 2011. The FBI has since taken the poster down, having received “official confirmation.” 
None of the citizens mentioned in the letter received 
any due process. Though it may be interpreted as unconsti-tutional, Holder defended such conduct in his letter: “It is clear and logical that United States citizenship alone does not make such individuals immune from being targeted.”
Then, on Thursday, the president gave his speech. He 
announced that he would be restricting the use of un-manned drone strikes and handing over control of the drones to the military. He also announced in the speech that he would be making steps to close the military prison at Guantanamo Bay. 
The president, after every speech, can leave one with 
the feeling that he is genuine in his intentions and that he means well. Yet, we wonder if he knows what his legacy is shaping up to be.
Through his first term, many said the press was on a 
honeymoon with the president. Since then, the honey-moon is definitely over, and it seems like Obama’s major defense policy tools have been drones. As a matter of his-tory, Obama may very likely be remembered most strongly as the drone president. Despite his Nobel Peace Prize, he will almost certainly not be remembered as a president of peace.
Though this move with Guantanamo might be an indi-
cation of good things to come, we wonder if he will actually accomplish anything. As a candidate for president, Obama promised to close the military prison. Earlier this year, though, the president dissolved the office of the envoy for closing the prison. And now he has taken a renewed inter-est in Guantanamo, perhaps because of the hunger strike. Why is his word on closing the prison so much better the second time?
As for the moral repercussions of all of it, Obama may 
have a lot more than the lives of four citizens on his con-science if the next president decides to continue with the precedent of killing American citizens.Game of Drones: 
What will Obama’s 
legacy be?

becoming not a big deal. I mean, not a big deal with regards to news stories as a whole. For sports and LGBTQ communities, it’s a huge deal. This is a very interesting de-velopment.
With Rogers’ and Jason Collins’ 
announcements that made them the ﬁ  rst gay men in their respective leagues — Major League Soccer for Rogers and the National Basket-ball Association for Collins — the theme of those who didn’t like it was not clear and included unbri-dled bigotry for the most part. The battle cry of the resistance was, “I don’t want to hear it,” or “He should keep it to himself.”
This pleases me because it means 
pure hate is being phased out as unacceptable in any form. We’re improving as a society. When I use society, I mean both American society and global society. While we’re ﬁ  ghting hate against sexual orientation, the Union of Euro-pean Football Associations has adopted an anti-racism measure. That measure calls for quick and severe sanctions concerning racist incidents.
The Internet is also assisting 
on these fronts. To paraphrase a www.cracked.com column, the Internet community will not stand for injustice. Every incident has a chance to go viral if morals are ig-nored.
With sports being streamed 
over the Internet now more than ever, we have on our hands an incred-ible com-bination of tools to com-bat what 
we see as wrong. It’s like having a hammer and a screwdriver fused together in a functional way that also supplies its own nails and screws. Some will abuse this, but these people are like those who injure themselves as a result of not reading warning labels.
I’ve said this in previous col-
umns, but sports are meant to tran-scend the everyday world. They give us respite from our fears, fail-ings and ﬂ  aws. We live vicariously through these athletes, and some audience members even go on to follow in the athlete’s path.
Sports should be our utopia 
— not another breeding ground of problems. This is why despite not being a “big deal,” gay players coming out while active and get-ting a chance to play is a big deal.
Sects of American culture glori-
fy sports to the point of being reli-gious — case in point: college foot-ball anywhere in the South. How ﬁ  tting then that sports are acting like a benevolent god, gracing the people and helping us solve our problems.
The governing bodies of sports 
are run by people, though. They are not infallible and are even in-clined at times to stray from what we would consider a good path. Corruption is rampant. Cheating is overlooked.
We cannot expect something 
else to always be there for us — al-lowing us to engage in the least of activities. Couch potato activism on social media only goes so far. If we truly want to overcome the issues that plague us, we must be-come agents of change ourselves.
We’ve been given a spring-
board by these athletes. They can become catalysts as all of us work to improve the world we live in.
It’s a daunting task but so is 
Mike Foley’s reporting class. I in-tend to face both challenges head-on, unﬂ  inchingly. I ask that you join me in the undertaking of im-proving, if not reforming, any and all communities that we are a part of. From the online Dungeons & Dragons group of ﬁ  ve people to the entire global community, ev-erywhere and everything can be changed for the better.

A majority of Americans would 
rather take a financial loss than gain 
additional weight, according to a recent national study, and many Gainesville residents agree. 
A study released by the Inter-
national Food Information Council Foundation announced Thursday that, of the 1,000 people surveyed, more than half would rather lose $1,000 than gain 20 pounds. The sur-vey also found taste is the primary factor that influences people’s selec-tion of food and beverages, which contributes to weight gain. Nick Farley, a 23-year-old per-
sonal trainer with UF RecSports, said that Americans are more likely to choose staying slimmer over money because people are becoming aware of the long-term threats of obesity.  
“People are starting to see that, in 
the long run, gaining the 20 pounds is not worth it because it will take them longer to lose the weight,” Far-ley said.He said he tries to emphasize 
overall progress rather than num-bers when coaching clients. 
“I teach my clients not to focus on 
the superficial things like a scale and realize that losing weight is a long-term commitment that is required every day,” he said. 
Sarah Schmidt, a dietetic intern 
for the UF Student Health Care Center, said perhaps Americans expressed preferences toward not gaining weight because they feel held to a body image standard.
But healthy is different for every 
body type and age, she said. 
“There is a connection between 
healthy eating and body apprecia-tion,” Schmidt said. “Being healthy is a long-term lifestyle change that doesn’t include depriving yourself of the things you need.”

Gators are making Etsy orange and blue.
An online marketplace for crafty entrepreneurs, 
www.etsy.com, has UF alumni, football fans and Gainesville residents among its more than 7 million registered users. 
A search on Etsy for “gators” returns more 
than 8,000 items.
A search for “UF” gives about 1,500. Lynn Searfoss, owner of Dream Love Boutique 
on Etsy, found the website last year while helping a friend plan her wedding. 
The 24-year-old 2010 UF graduate and dental 
school hopeful has her Etsy shop concentrate on hand-painted quotes on canvas.
“I’ve realized that most people have that 
special quote they live by, and sometimes it’s hard to find that quote on a art piece,” Searfoss wrote in an email interview. “That’s what my shop does — brings to life your special quote, lyric or life motto so you can be inspired by it every day.”
Stina Roth, 23, and creator of Stina89c on Etsy, 
wrote in an email that she found Etsy to be a way to share everything that’s inspirational with her customers.
Roth, who has cystic fibrosis, was listed for a 
double-lung transplant and moved to Gainesville to be near UF Health Shands Hospital in October.
“I have always loved painting,” Roth said. “I don’t necessarily paint things I think will sell. I just paint my favorite things.”
On the other hand, being a local resident often 
benefits Gator-oriented shops on Etsy.
Kat, who sells products under the username 
GatorMade, wrote in an email that student purchases increase during the football season and graduation.
But she said she has sold her “To the Swamp” 
signs for customers in Germany, Hawaii and Australia. 
“The Gator Nation is everywhere,” she 
added. 
Etsy can also help students become small 
business owners.
“I used my store on Etsy as a trial run to see 
what it would be like to run my own business, and I am now work[ing] for myself as a full-time artist,” said owner of HowToUseArt, Tessa McSorley, 31. “If Etsy hadn’t been there when I was just starting out, I don’t know if I would be where I am today.”
McSorley graduated from UF in 2005 
with degree in studio art and an emphasis in printmaking. 
“I definitely think that recent UF grads and 
current students can benefit from opening a shop on Etsy,” McSorley said. 
She added: “It’s a great way to test the water 
and see if their handmade items will sell online, and it also gives them a sense of what it’s like to run a small business.”The Gator Nation is everywhere

Although the square plot of land 
near the intersection of 13th Street 
and West University Avenue is va-cant, it’s been stirring up dialogue among Gainesville residents for months. 
Miami-based development com-
pany the Swerdlow Group has been working with the City of Gainesville to legally amend the city’s compre-hensive plan to allow construction of a new multi-story residential development called University Cor-ners. 
Via two proposals, the compa-
ny asked Gainesville to adopt two separate ordinances to rezone the property to allow a taller building — something the current zoning wouldn’t allow. 
“Under current law, they could 
do the same project, but not quite as big,” said City Commissioner Thomas Hawkins. “Gainesville is going to grow. We’re trying to make it grow, but we only have a certain amount of space. We need to allow people to build taller buildings to accommodate for that.” 
A multi-story building would of-
fer more jobs and more opportuni-ties, Hawkins said. 
Because of the location and the 
number of people that could reside at the University Corners building, Hawkins said, costs such as trans-portation could be signiﬁ  cantly re-duced for residents. 
However, not all Gainesville residents are ready to support the project. 
Lisa Limpert, a 58-year-old 
Gainesville resident, said she does not support the proposed ordi-nance. 
Limpert, who has lived in 
Gainesville for 47 years, said the building, which could range from eight to 13 stories, will not only ruin the aesthetics of the area, but also would complicate trafﬁ  c and pedes-trian situations.
“The intersection of 13th Street 
and University Avenue has trafﬁ  c issues as it now stands,” she wrote in an email. “Adding a huge retail and residential complex on that cor-ner without considering the impact on trafﬁ  c is irresponsible.” 
Tom Rider, retired owner of  
Goerings Book Store, agreed the project would be a bad move for Gainesville. 
“I’m proud that I live in a neigh-
borhood that’s really come back af-ter years of neglect,” he said. “But I see this project as a step in the wrong direction.” 
It’s the wrong direction because 
of the parking garage included in the plans for the complex, Rider said. 
Adding the garage without a 
“careful look at the impact of park-ing structure on the trafﬁ  c that it generates” could interfere with traf-ﬁ  c patterns, he said.
The garage could also block 
sunlight from nearby buildings, he said. 
Because some ﬁ  nancing for the project would come through the city’s Community Redevelopment Agency, Rider said, the project could be risky for taxpayers. 
“It’s one thing for developers to 
decide that maybe something will work, but they’re not taking the risk,” Rider said. “They’re making sure it’s the city, and ultimately city taxpayers, that are taking the risk.” 
The City Commission must pass 
both proposed ordinances so the building can be constructed accord-ing to the developer’s plan.  
The commission hasn’t deter-
mined when it will vote on the or-dinances.
If the vote is not in favor of the 
two new ordinances, the developer must re-evaluate its building plans to comply with current zoning. 
But for now, the proposed proj-
ect remains in the negotiation stage. 
“We raised some concerns about 
sidewalks and building appear-ance, and (the developers) did a good job responding to requests,” Hawkins said. “We continued the ordinance, which basically means we give the developer time to talk to the neighborhood and come back to us later.”TUESDAY, MAY 28, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Just one week after experiencing 
devastating loss, survivors of the 
Oklahoma tornado will be able to take comfort in special visitors from Gainesville: three miniature therapy horses.
The horses of Gentle Carousel 
Miniature Therapy Horses, a volun-teer-based nonprofit charity, began their journey to Moore, Okla., in a truck and horse trailer. 
The group will be in Oklahoma 
for about a week, said Debbie Gar-cia-Bengochea, the education direc-tor of Gentle Carousel.
The organization was not plan-
ning to visit Oklahoma, she said, but less than two weeks after a group of horses returned from visiting New-town, Conn., calls came pouring in from families, government officials and first responders in Oklahoma. 
After the Oklahoma community 
proposed a therapy plan that would meet its needs, Gentle Carousel de-cided to make the trip. But Garcia-Bengochea said the team will also stay flexible to meet needs as they arise.
“Even though they’re setting up 
particular things for us, it’s all pretty fluid,” Garcia-Bengochea said. 
The horses will visit a makeshift 
shelter set up in a college gym to in-teract with survivors, she said. 
On trips, Garcia-Bengochea said, 
the horses typically dress up to visit families, sporting sparkles in their manes and tails.
She said she expects the horses’ 
visit to Oklahoma to help the heal-ing process for individuals in the community. 
One time, a child with a brain tu-
mor asked to see a horse. 
When the horse came into the 
child’s room, the child said, “She can see inside my soul.” 
Gentle Carousel started about 15 
years ago, originally working with severely abused children. 
The charity has been mentioned in a Broadway show by Hugh Jack-man, featured by CNN, USA Today and Time magazine, which named therapy horse Magic one of history’s top 10 most heroic animals. 
Ocala, Lake City and Gainesville 
are home for the horses when the charity is not traveling.
In February, they paired up with 
UF Health Shands Rehab Hospital, said Andrea Gilbert, a Shands Re-hab occupational therapist who set up the connection.
The partnership started on Val-
entine’s Day, and the horses’ first visit to the hospital was so success-ful it became a weekly occurrence, Gilbert said. 
During their visits, Gilbert said, 
the horses help patients, and the pa-tients help the horses. 
“There’s a correlation between 
what our patients are going through and what the baby horses are going through,” Gilbert said.
While extensive planning goes 
into coordinating the horses’ long trips, Garcia-Bengochea said she finds the process well worth the ef-fort.
“When you’re sick, to see a real 
horse — it’s a great thing,” she said.10, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, MAY 28, 2013

Teens are moving away 
from Facebook and toward 
other social media sites, ac-cording to a recent Pew Re-search Center study.
What does Facebook have 
that Twitter, Instagram and other social media sites do not? 
“Parents,” said Sharon Bik-
oundou, a guidance counselor at American Heritage School in Plantation. “And I think they just think it’s easier to just tweet something and hit sub-mit.”
The study also said teens 
are sharing more information about themselves on social me-dia sites than they have in the past. But teen social media us-ers were not concerned about people accessing their data. 
Instead, they blamed the 
excessive amount of adults invading their Internet space for their declining interest in Facebook. They also found the drama to be draining, the angst and inane details unap-pealing, and the constant rep-utation management stressful, the study showed. 
“Twitter just lets you write 
(a) small character amount … it just goes straight to the point,” said Shawn Humphreys, a lo-cal DJ and 21-year-old crimi-nal justice Santa Fe College student, “and (Instagram) pictures show a lot more than writing.”
The study’s results show-
ing a decline in Facebook us-age may prove bad news for businesses that rely on the website to communicate with their audiences.
“Facebook is the best way I 
think to promote yourself, pro-mote events and to get people to know your name,” Hum-phreys said. “I will always use Facebook. I don’t like (Twitter) because it gives you a limit.”
“When you’re sick, to see 
a real horse — it’s a great 
thing.”

UF Student Body President Christina Bonar-
rigo has on campus covered. Now, she’s going 
online.
Bonarrigo’s office has launched a Twitter ac-
count — @UF_SBPrez — and blog — www.stu-dentbodyprezuf.blogspot.com — for the newly elected 22-year-old. 
The goal, according to a news  release, is to 
give readers information about her work to im-pact the UF experience.
Bonarrigo said she started a blog during her 
Spring campaign and received more than 7,000 views the week it launched. But she wanted to change its focus to be more interactive.
“I thought, ‘Why not create a Student Body 
President blog where I could highlight what I do as Student Body President, what my role en-tails and also create a personal aspect to better connect with students?’” Bonarrigo said.
She said she meets weekly with her press 
secretary, Collin Thompson, to write the blog posts. Her blog will be updated on Tuesdays and Thursdays for now, but she hopes to in-crease that frequency by the time Fall starts.
“If it is something that students interact 
with and relate to ... we can definitely increase the number of times we do it per week,” Bonar-rigo said.
So far, she has posted three times: about 
Preview, the 2013 state legislative session and Summer A. Bonarrigo said the blog aims to merge her personal and political lives to en-gage students. 
UF nursing student Christine Farina, 22, 
said that goal is good.
“It depends on how hard she’s willing to 
work,” she said. “I know a lot of students are kind of frustrated with the way Student Gov-ernment is run.”

Hundreds of adoptable animals will be 
hoping for homes this weekend at the PetS-
mart on Archer Road.
Maddie’s Adoptathon 2013 presents the 
largest national free pet adoption week in hopes of sparking an interest in people to help animals in need, according to its web-site. 
Several partners with Maddie’s Fund, in-
cluding Puppy Hill Farm, Animal People Inc. and Helping Hands Rescue, will take part in Maddie’s Pet Adoption Days on Saturday and Sunday.
In Gainesville alone, the number of home-
less animals has begun to grow. Wendy Turner, 38, a volunteer for the nonprofit Ani-mal People Inc., said many owners do not spay or neuter their pets.
Some people do not have the funds or the easy access to fix their pet. Alachua County offers no mobile services for reduced rates or free clinics allowing veterinarians to come to the owner, but there are stationary clinics like St. Francis Pet Care. 
When animals are not fixed and end up 
having litters of newborns, owners usually are not equipped to handle large amounts of unplanned births. They bring them to shelters, or in some cases, leave them on the streets. A black Labrador, pointer and Rottweiler 
mix named Sadie gave birth to a litter of 14 puppies before the age of 2 and was put up for adoption by her owners. 
The puppies were adopted, leaving Sadie 
in the pound.
“Everyone wants a puppy,” Turner said. 
“Older dogs are harder to adopt out because they sometimes require extra care and have a shorter life span.”
Kristina Swanson, 23, a nursing student 
at UF, adopted Sadie from PetSmart in Sep-tember.
“I fostered Sadie for a week before decid-
ing to adopt her,” Swanson said. “I couldn’t stand the idea of not living with her or the idea of her being put back in the shelter and not being loved by someone.”
When animals are picked up from the 
streets, they are held for seven days. If they are not claimed within that time, they are put on the list for euthanasia if they are deemed “unadoptable,” said Luke Smith, a volunteer at Puppy Hill Farm Animal Rescue. 
“For every animal adopted from Puppy 
Hill Farm, it allows us to go to the pound and get one of the animals from the top of the eu-thanasia list to bring to our shelter,” said the 20-year-old UF animal sciences sophomore. 
Katie Ronzon, 21, a UF applied physiolo-
gy and kinesiology senior, said that breeders typically inbreed the animals, which causes problems down the road.
“In the long run, adopted animals tend 
to be healthier and have less medical issues than purebreds do,” Ronzon said. 
Ronzon adopted a 2-month-old American 
Staffordshire terrier and pit bull mix named Stella from the Jacksonville Humane Society.
Ronzon said that it’s a fulfilling feeling to 
save a life — but only for the right person.
“Don’t adopt if you are not ready for the 
commitment, regardless of the animal or the age,” Ronzon said.

Alligator Contributing Writer
Actress and film director An-
gelina Jolie — whose aunt died of 
cancer Sunday — recently created a buzz after she underwent a pre-ventive double mastectomy, and some Gainesville residents have reacted positively to the super-star’s decision.
In a New York Times article Jolie 
wrote last week, she explained that she decided to have the procedure after learning she carried a mutat-ed gene, BRCA1, that increases the risk of developing cancer. 
Lisa Brown, a genetic counselor 
at UF Health Cancer Center, said she applauds Jolie’s decision.“I think it’s 
great that An-gelina had the preventative  surgery,” Brown said. “The sur-gery itself can reduce breast cancer risk by 90 
percent, and being in the spotlight brings attention to a topic people otherwise would not have thought about.”            Branden Stanford, a 21-year-old 
UF food science and human nutri-tion junior, agreed that Jolie’s de-cision was positive, but he said it wasn’t heroic. 
“She did what she had to do 
to make sure she didn’t get it,” he said. “She is up there in age, so it’s better to do it now than to get it and go through chemotherapy when you’re 60.”
Donna Palmisciano, 46-year-
old architect and a contributor to the book “Just a Lump in the Road …,” which contains memoirs from young breast cancer survivors, said Jolie made the right decision by opting for preventative surgery.
“She has chosen to take con-
trol of this situation versus it tak-ing control over her,” Palmisciano said. “I feel by having a gorgeous lady in the public eye, she is doing the right thing to come forward, educate and encourage men and women to be tested for the gene.”

For the fifth time in six 
seasons, the Gators are bound 
for Oklahoma City.
No. 2 seed Florida (57-7) utilized strong pitching and defense to defeat UAB (40-19) 1-0 on Sunday at Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium, winning the Gainesville Su-per Regional and advanc-ing to the Women’s College World Series for the first time since 2011. UF’s appearance will mark the fifth time in the progam’s 17-year history it has reached the WCWS. 
“Very special feeling for 
these young players,” coach Tim Walton said of his team, which is comprised of 12 underclassmen, one junior transfer and only three up-perclassmen who have been to the WCWS.

This time last season, Florida had a berth in 
the NCAA Tournament locked up. The only 
question was who would come to Gainesville to face the Gators in the regional. 
A year later, they needed to wait until 
Selection Monday to find out if they would have an opportunity to play in June.
The NCAA selection committee picked 
Florida as the No. 3 seed in the Bloomington Regional on Monday.
“This team has worked awfully hard,” 
coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “We’ve had our ups, we’ve had our downs. This is a new season, and I know they’re awfully excited to play next weekend.”
Florida (29-28) will face second-seeded 
Austin Peay (45-13) in the first game at Bart Kaufman Stadium in Bloomington, Ind., at 1 on Friday. No. 1 seed Indiana (43-14) plays fourth-seeded Valparaiso (31-26) at 7.
“Everybody was 
really excited,” senior Cody Dent said. “We have a chance to play 
in the tournament and do something.”
Added junior Jonathon Crawford: “Every-
body’s bouncing around.”
The Gators played the Hoosiers in 
Gainesville in March, and Indiana took two of three from Florida.
Unlike last season, the Gators were on the 
bubble following losses in five of their last seven games, including a first-round loss in the Southeastern Conference Tournament to Texas A&M on May 21. 
But UF ended the SEC Tournament with 
the No. 2 strength of schedule in the country and the No. 26 RPI, which was enough to se-cure the team a bid.
“I definitely think Indiana and all the oth-
er teams aren’t very happy to see our name in the regional,” Crawford said. “We’re a young team, and we kind of build a lot off momen-tum … If we get that momentum, people are not going to like us.”
Florida has made the NCAA Tournament 
six straight years – tied for the longest run in the school’s history. 
“What we’re trying to do is build a pro-
gram here and develop some consistency,” O’Sullivan said. “This is an important year for us to get in. It wasn’t the prettiest season, but I’m as proud of this team as any team we had here.”

Today, the Florida men’s golf team 
hopes 13 is its lucky number as it begins 
play in the NCAA Championships for the 13th straight year.
The Gators are looking to build off of 
an impressive performance at the NCAA Regionals, where they finished second. 
The result was the best of the entire 
spring season for UF and was much need-ed after a disastrous 10th-place finish at the Southeastern Conference Championships. Thanks to their success in Baton Rouge, the Gators are confident about their chanc-es this week. 
“What happened at the SECs was a fluke,” senior T.J. Vogel said. “We’ve never played that bad, and it’s not going to hap-pen again. How we played at regionals is who we are. We’re that good. We can play with Alabama.”
The Gators are familiar with the Crim-
son Tide. The teams most recently faced each other in the Baton Rouge Regional, where the Tide came back on the final day and erased an eight-shot Florida lead by shooting 282 (-6) in the final round – 14 shots better than the Gators. Alabama won the regional by six strokes. 
“We’re going to be measured forever 
by what we do this week,” coach Buddy Alexander said. 
“No one remembers what happened at 
the Gator Invitational in 2004, but I can tell you what we finished in the NCAAs that year .” 
The competition will unfold from the 
Capital City Club Crabapple Course in Woodstock, Ga., a course that will chal-lenge Florida’s length. 
The course will play at 7,319 yards – 
619 yards longer than the Mark Bostick Golf Course, which plays at 6,700 yards. No Gator has competed at the Capital City Club.
“I don’t know much about this course,” 
senior Tyler McCumber said. “I know it’s in pretty good shape, I know it’s long and it’s going to be in championship condition. I think that favors our team. We’re good

JURNY DUTY
 When I came to college, it had been 
years since I was part of a team or group that really had an identity.
  I played on some good Little League 
baseball teams — the highlight of my not-so-memorable athletic career. Of all of my friends growing up, I was the only one not athletic enough to play a sport in high school.
  Here at UF, I ﬁ  nally found that sense of 
friendship again when I joined a fraternity. I believed that was all I needed. 
  However, I found that I was part of a dif-
ferent, yet equally passionate group on Feb. 21, 2012. 
  A day earlier, in an infamous incident 
that any student who is at least a junior-to-be would recall, members of the Unite Party threw away more than 250 copies of the Al-ligator. They did so because the paper ran a front-page story about Will Muschamp endorsing the Students Party’s vice presi-dential candidate, who happened to be one of his players. 
  As a second-semester writer, I hadn’t de-
veloped a deep connection to the Alligator yet. I knew I liked my fellow sports writers, and the students in the news department treated me well. 
But as one of just a few members of the 
Greek community on staff, the incident put me in an awkward situation. My employer was suddenly in the middle of a major con-troversy with the Greek-powered party.
  Despite the Alligator endorsing the Unite 
Party in the spring of 2011, most fraternity and sorority members I have talked to dur-ing my time in Gainesville think the paper has a personal agenda against Greek life.
  So on the 21st, the reaction from my 
Greek friends was that the Alligator was out to get them after the front page of the paper had a news story about the trashing, and both the sports and opinions sections ran columns criticizing the Unite Party.
  They didn’t seem to grasp that we were 
simply reporting the news based on the facts. 
I had friends who thought the Alligator’s 
journalistic standards were low enough to fabricate the entire thing, and I constantly found myself in arguments about this.  But I only grew 
prouder to be a part of a staff that continued to re-port on a story regardless of how unpopular it made the paper with a powerful seg-
ment of the student body — even if I had some uncomfortable conversations with my brothers. 
The staff could have viewed me and other 
Greek writers as outsiders not fully devoted to objectivity because of our involvement in other organizations. But it was never an is-
sue.
These people take their work too serious-
ly to make up a story about student govern-
ment just to start a controversy, and that’s what I love about them.
   When I describe to others what writing 
for alligatorSports entails, they can’t get over the fact that objectivity is such a high priority for us. But it’s that same commit-ment to fairness that every section of the pa-per displays when it reports on any story.
  As I wait for my ﬁ  rst post-grad job op-
portunity and worry whether or not a long-term career in journalism is in my future, I’ll always take comfort in knowing that I was a part of a team at the Alligator that took pride in its work, professionalism and com-mitment above all else.
  So thanks to Adam Berry for recom-
mending that the Fall 2011 sports staff hire me and to Tom Green for taking the recom-mendation seriously and giving me a shot.
  To Watts and Boothe: Thanks for making 
me a better writer last spring by giving me the toughest constructive criticism I’ve ever had.
  And thanks to Greg, Joe and even Pincus 
for making last football season the best ex-perience I’ve had in college.
  Without you guys and the rest of the Al-
ligator staff, I’d probably still be a writer, but a worse one for sure. 
  And I deﬁ  nitely wouldn’t have had the 
chance to be a team player.

MICHELLE PROVENZANO
Alligator Writer
After Florida dropped a heart-
wrenching semifinals match to 
Stanford, coach Roland Thorn-qvist had nothing but praise for his team.
“Our players were battling 
their hearts out,” Thornqvist said in a release. “It looked so grim for us, down 3-0, but somehow we found a way and gave ourselves a chance to win. That’s one thing about this team – they just never give up.”
The loss cost the reigning na-
tional champions a shot at their third straight national title, but it didn’t diminish a successful sea-son.
Florida finished the year with 
a 26-3 record, with 23 of its wins coming against ranked oppo-nents. 
The Gators now say goodbye 
to Lauren Embree and Caroline Hitimana – two seniors who were members of Florida’s back-to-back championship squads. 
Embree ended her career as 
ITA’s National Senior Player of the Year and the first three-time Southeastern Conference Wom-en’s Tennis Player of the Year in conference history. 
Embree completed her final 
season at Florida with an unde-feated 20-0 record before she fell to Stanford’s Nicole Gibbs in the NCAA semifinals. But her final match did not ful-
ly represent her time at Florida. Embree clinched the final points in the 2011 and 2012 NCAA Cham-pionship matches to grab Florida the title both years. 
“I have no regrets coming to 
college,” Embree said in a re-lease. “Honestly, they’re the best four years I’ve had of my life. It has really changed me in so many ways.”
Thornqvist added: “There’s not 
much more I can say about Lau-ren that I can say that I haven’t already. She’s a champion. She’s one of the greatest four-year col-legiate tennis players in history. She’s meant so much to our pro-gram on and off the court and her legend will continue on our future Gator teams who learned from her preparation and training.”
Although she is not as deco-
rated as Embree, Hitimana also made an impact at Florida.
The Waterloo, Belgium, native 
gave the Gators an edge in SEC play. She was the deciding factor in Florida’s final 2012 SEC Tourna-ment match, grabbing the Gators’ third consecutive SEC Champi-onship in a singles battle against Georgia’s Alina Jerjomina.
Hitimana leaves Florida with a 
73-18 career record. She went un-defeated in singles at 11-0 in her last season.
Despite the loss of a strong 
senior duo, Florida has impact players across the board in 2013-14. Sofie Oyen, Alex Cercone and Olivia Janowicz rise to senior sta-tus with impressive records under their belts. 
Oyen entered the 2013 season 
as ITA’s top-ranked collegiate tennis player, and she goes into her senior year with an 80-24 ca-reer record. 
Cercone developed her game 
this year, struggling in the fall but dominating the spring season with a 20-4 record. 
Janowicz stepped up in the lat-
ter half of the season to grab 16 straight wins – five of them com-ing in NCAA Tournament match-ups.
Freshman Brianna Morgan is 
another contender for Florida af-ter ending her inaugural season with a 20-3 spring record and five clinchers against ranked oppo-nents. 
But the season was not an easy 
one for UF. Doubles play was a weakness for the Gators this year. They lost 10 doubles matches, cul-minating in a loss to Stanford in the NCAA semifinals. 
“It’s been challenging because 
we haven’t had the doubles issues in the past like we did this year, but our players handled it with resiliency,” Thornqvist said. “We lost it more this year than any other year that I’ve been here. We found a way to still be competi-tive against top teams throughout the year. I’m just really proud of them.”

tee.”
McCumber has made a habit of 
coming up big in postseason play. He is one of three seniors in Florida’s lineup this week and enters the tour-nament with four top-three finishes in his last five postseason events. 
McCumber, Vogel and Tommy 
Mou will be making their final ap-pearances with Florida. Alexander added Mou to the lineup to replace freshman A.J. Crouch before the Ba-ton Rouge Regional.
Vogel had a strong performance 
in Baton Rouge, shooting 215 (-1) and tying McCumber for third at the tour-nament. 
“It’s bittersweet,” Vogel said. “I 
think I’m ready to go, but I’ve had such an amazing time here the last two years.”
One question mark remains for UF 
– the status of sophomore J.D. Tom-linson. 
The Gainesville native received a 
stitches in his toe after an accident at a pool.
“He cut … his big toe on his right 
foot,” Alexander said. “If it was any other toe, I think we’d be alright, but that’s the one out of ten toes that might be the most important for a right-handed golfer, because when he finishes [his swing motion], he finish-es with his weight on that right toe.
“Kind of a freak accident at the 
pool,” Alexander continued. “Just cut it on a piece of tile. Wasn’t necessarily 
horsing around; he was with his fam-ily.”
Tomlinson took 
full golf shots on Friday afternoon. 
But with his status unclear, Alexander will take six golfers with him instead of the standard five to Woodstock – the first time Alexander has ever tak-en more than a quintet to the NCAA Championships. 
Despite the uncertainty surround-
ing the back end of Florida’s lineup, Alexander is optimistic about the way his team is playing entering the tour-nament.
“They stepped up in a big way 
at the regionals when maybe a lot of people were counting us out,” Alex-ander said. “That’s a tribute to them and their resolve. Hopefully they can continue that this week.” Sophomore out with injury

Freshman first baseman brings 
in clinching run with double
“They don’t understand what they’ve ac-
complished in such a short period of time.”
UF will face seventh-seeded Tennessee 
(49-10) on Thursday at 2:30. 
Florida scored the game’s only run in the 
top of the fourth. Following a single from 
sophomore Lauren Haeger, senior pinch run-ner Ensley Gammel checked in and stole sec-ond with two outs. 
In the next at-bat, freshman Taylor 
Schwarz fought to a 3-2 count and doubled off the left-center field wall, recording a dou-ble and scoring Gammel.
“My hit was just a clutch hit, and it just so 
happened to be the only run we scored to-day,” Schwarz said. 
In the third, fifth and sixth innings, UF 
stranded a runner on third. After UAB pitch-er Lannah Campbell retired the side in the top of the seventh, Florida was three outs away from clinching the win.
After UAB’s Kristen McGrath grounded 
out, Anna Kimbrell doubled to left center with a line drive that fell only a few feet short of traveling over the fence. Then, Blaz-ers right fielder Chandler Orr popped up to second base for the second out.
Lauren Webster followed with a single 
down the middle past junior pitcher Hannah Rogers. But as Blazers pinch runner Hailey Glynn advanced to third and ran toward home, second baseman Kelsey Stewart dove and fielded the ball.
The freshman then tossed it with her bare 
hand to freshman catcher Aubree Munro, who tagged out Glynn to seal the win.
“I never had a doubt the ball was going to 
go through the infield,” Stewart said. “I was just laying my body out there, trying to get the ball stopped.”
Pitching her second complete game in as 
many days, Rogers fanned seven batters, al-lowed four hits and walked only two Blaz-ers.
The Gators, who were picked to finish 
seventh in the Southeastern Conference in the 2013 Coaches’ Poll, will now face a Vol-unteers squad they took to extras in three contests this year. Florida won two games in the March series.  
Walton said Sunday that he picked the 
Volunteers to win the national title during the preseason.
“I think they have one of the best teams in 
the country,” Walton said. 
“I’ve always thought that. Great pitching 
staff, great defense, great offense, great ath-letes. No surprise that they’re in the World Series. The surprise, I guess, is they’re the 7 seed and we’re the 2 seed.”
