� THE LOTTERY HAS 
ALWAYS SOLD OUT.

Danielle Duncan has never 
been to a gameday inside The 
Swamp, and she doesn’t really care to ever experience it.
The 18-year-old software en-
gineering freshman didn’t sign 
up for the student ticket lottery 
and isn’t planning on getting any tickets to spend her Satur-days in the student section of Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium.
She said she doesn’t like 
football and normally just claps when other people clap at a game. She doesn’t like the cramped environment, either.
And Duncan isn’t alone. For 
the ﬁ  rst time, student season tickets are not sold out yet, ac-cording to Mark Gajda, assis-tant athletics director with the 
University Athletic Associa-
tion.
Gajda said this year, the de-
partment is 1,000 tickets below its average 21,500 UF band and 
student tickets — about a 5 per-
cent decrease.
In the seven or eight years 
the lottery has been around, he said, this has never happened.
Gajda said students may not 
know to register for the season ticket lottery over the summer 
because they don’t check their Student football 
season tickets

HEAT WAVE
MICHAEL SCOTT DAVIDSON
Alligator Contributing Writer
Students who walked through the swel-
tering heat on their way to class this se-
mester can expect temperatures to dip back 
below normal by the end of the week.
The decrease in temperatures should 
mark the end of a heat wave that has af-
fected much of the U.S. since late June, ex-
perts say.Zaaron Allen, a lead forecaster with 
the National Weather Service in Jackson-
ville, said a slow-moving, strong ridge of high atmospheric pressure caused the heat 
wave. 
The ridge’s lack of movement caused 
heat to build from sinking air.
Even though temperatures in 
Gainesville did rise during the heat wave, Allen said, the city didn’t see a dramatic 
spike in temperatures.“Gainesville is at the very periphery of 
the conditions,” Allen said. “The humidity hasn’t been as bad as further north.”
In Gainesville, the average high this month is currently 94 degrees, about two degrees above normal, Allen said.
The heat index for Gainesville peaked 
at 105 degrees, three degrees shy of issu-ing a heat warning.
Allen said that temperatures and 
weather are forecasted to return to a nor-mal summer pattern by next week.
“The ridge of high pressure is weaken-
ing, so the heat is decreasing,” he said.Rising temperatures to return to normal this weekSEE TICKETS, PAGE 4

Would-be burglar gets tangled in 
window blinds
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Po-
lice say a would-be burglar was 
halted by unlikely obstacles — window blinds.
KRQE-TV reports that police 
found Thomas Molina on Sunday tangled in some window blinds at Central New Mexico Community Center spokesman Chad Camp-bell told the Winston-Salem Jour -
nal that someone reported see-ing the monkey in southwestern 
Forsyth County on Friday . But 
crews didn’t see the animal when they arrived. This particular type of monkey, called a macaque, es-caped from the Wake Forest Uni-versity Primate Center.
Campbell says searchers have 
set up humane traps and are play-ing baby monkey calls to lure the 
animal. Officials hope the monkey 
will respond to the calls because she is a breeding animal used in research.
The 16-year-old macaque is 
originally from Indonesia and has been in captivity since 2008.

Thieves bust through wall to 
steal hair extensions
CHICAGO — Three thieves 
battered through a wall, crawled 
close to the floor to dodge motion detectors and stole six duffel bags filled with human hair extensions 
from a Chicago beauty supply 
store.
The Chicago Tribune reported 
Saturday that the hair extensions were worth $230,000.
Store owner Don Shin says the 
criminals took his best merchan-dise. He thinks the culprits will try to sell the extensions on the street 
or to salons. The thieves broke 
through a wall from an attached empty storefront at about 2 a.m. Saturday.
Extensions can be made from 
artificial or human hair. They are used in salons to add length and volume to a hairstyle.
Shin says the thieves didn’t 
take any of “the cheap stuff” and 
“knew what they were doing.”
— THE ASSOCIATED PRESSCollege in Albuquerque after po-
lice received a call about a break-
in.
Police say the 38-year-old 
Molina told police he was look-ing for computer hardware.
Molina was arrested and 
charged with burglary and breaking and entering. He is be-ing held on a $10,000 bond.
It was unclear if he had an at-
torney.

AT&T drops legal fight over 
Mass. man’s $1M bill
IPSWICH, Mass. — AT&T 
Inc. says it’s dropping its legal 
fight against a Massachusetts businessman whose company was on the hook for a fraudulent 
million-dollar phone bill.
The telecommunications 
company said in a statement 
Monday it is no longer pursu-ing its claims against Michael Smith of Ipswich, “though we are entitled by law to collect the amounts owed.”
Smith said the offer depends 
on his dropping a countersuit. He’ll meet with his attorney about it on Tuesday.
Smith says someone hacked 
into his small manufacturing company’s phone system in 2009 and made nearly $900,000 in calls to Somalia. AT&T sued Smith for $1.15 million to recover the cost 
of the calls plus interest.
Smith told The Salem News 
he repeatedly asked AT&T to 
write off the bill. He said pay-ing it could force his business to 
close.

Students who have had enough 
of biology and calculus can put 
away the books and take up bar-
tending.
UF’s Leisure Course Program 
begins Monday for Summer B, 
offering hobby, music and sports 
classes to students and Gainesville 
residents.
The classes are not graded 
and do not appear on transcripts, said program coordinator Dianna 
Lampitt.   
Classes offered include guitar, 
tennis and ballroom dancing. 
The classes meet at the Reitz 
Union or other locations around 
Gainesville, depending on the subject. 
Prices vary for each class.Bartending is the most popular 
class and always ﬁ  lls up, Lampitt said.  
Some classes require no pre-
vious experience, and others are designed for people who want to enhance skills they already have.
About 85 percent of people 
who enroll in the classes are UF students, Lampitt said.
Twenty-two classes are avail-
able during Summer B.Fall and spring have the highest 
enrollment with about 500 people per semester.
“We want students to learn 
something they wouldn’t get in the classroom,” Lampitt said.
Registration for these classes 
began Monday. Registration runs until the end of next week, de-
pending on the class.  
Kim Tuttle, co-owner of Pofahl 
Studios, said she has been teach-
ing leisure program dance classes 
for about 30 years.
For Summer B, she is teaching 
ballet and hip-hop.
The classes, taught at her studio, 
are combined with classes Tuttle al-
ready teaches, she said.
She said the classes are perfect 
for students who want to dance but 
don’t have an outlet.
“As long as people want to 
learn, we’ll teach them,” she said.Students, non-students can now 
register for UF leisure courses  
Classes start Monday
“We want students to learn 
something they wouldn’t get

“The student population this 
year just didn’t come out as much as previous years,” he said. “I think 
fans are still excited. July to August 
are just summer doldrums.”
The incoming freshman class 
typically buys the most lottery tick-
ets because it’s the largest class by 
numbers, Gajda said. This year, the class distribution was normal.
Student season tickets cost $105 
for seven home games this year. Un-claimed student tickets cost $15 per game, according to the Gator Ticket 
Office.
Any remaining student tickets 
will be sold to the general public be-
fore each game this fall.
While Gajda said fans will buy 
tickets to fill the Swamp’s seats, he admitted there is “less demand than supply” regarding student season tickets.
Regular season tickets, though, 
have been up by a few hundred more tickets sold, Gajda said.Last season, three of seven home 
games were not officially sold out: those against Furman University , University of Alabama-Birmingham and Florida Atlantic University.
Gajda said the 2011 season was 
also the first time one-game ticket 
sales didn’t sell out at the end of the 
season.
Kimble McKay , a law student 
at Florida Coastal School of Law in 
Jacksonville, graduated from UF in 
2010. He said he was shocked that student tickets weren’t selling out.
He still tailgates home games 
at Lake Alice Field, a tradition he’s 
kept with his family since he was 10 
years old.
“Even though we haven’t done 
as well in recent years, I still go,” he said. “I think new students just have expectations so high.”
For some students, though, dol-
lars matter just as much as touch-
downs do.
Magdala Joseph, 21, said she 
would just rather pay her tuition 
bills than sign up for the student ticket lottery.
“It’s not as fun when the Gators 
aren’t winning,” the criminology and law and anthropology senior said. “If it becomes a season where games are worth watching, I’ll go. But I’m not motivated to go get un-
claimed tickets right now.”
Antony Rivera, a 19-year-old information systems sophomore, 
said he got the student ticket lottery his freshman year but only went to one game. He said his friends never 
went, he didn’t have much time and 
the Gators’ losing streak last season was a “turn-off.”
“I personally thought it was a 
bad investment,” he said. “If you’re there and your team is losing, you’re 
just sitting there and that’s never fun 
in any kind of event.”4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 10, 2012

About 40 UF researchers were among the thou-
sands of scientists who discovered what they believe 
to be the “God particle.”
The Higgs boson is a subatomic particle that can 
explain how matter attains mass. It interacts with oth-
er subatomic particles and slows them down.
The particle’s discovery was announced Wednes-
day, and it is believed to be the Higgs boson.
The discovery was made at CERN, a multinational 
particle physics laboratory in Geneva.
Andrey Korytov , a UF professor and team leader 
of physicists, said without this particle the Standard 
Model was not complete. The model, which is the best current explanation for how the universe works, is a 
set of elementary particles that make up the world.
The new particle holds a central role in the model.
A version of the Higgs particle could be a bridge to 
understand the 96 percent of the universe that is un-known, according to a CERN press release.
Paul Avery, another UF professor and researcher 
involved in the discovery , said the Standard Model now has its theoretical capstone. Scientists have been looking for it since the 1970s.The new particle was found by observing collisions 
of protons and looking at the smashed fragments, said researcher and UF professor Konstantin Matchev. 
Only a few thousand of the billions of collisions 
were the possible Higgs boson.
”It’s like looking at a needle in a stack of hay ,” 
Matchev said.
Two teams of about 3,000 physicists collected data 
from an underground tunnel 17 
miles wide. UF belongs to the CMS team.
The CMS team and the Atlas 
team independently found results of a new particle and believed it could be the Higgs boson.
UF has been involved in the re-
search for about 15 years. The team has collected data for two years.
The team will continue to study the particle’s prop-
erties and see if it is still behaving like the Higgs bo-son, Avery said.
Matchev said there was some indication last sum-
mer but not enough to confirm the particle.
“It’s good we found it, or we would have to throw 
away textbooks,” he said.

Shands Hospital. St. Cloud resident Phyllis Breisinger received a 
liver from a man who died in a North Florida traffic accident, after 
being diagnosed with liver disease in 1970 and waiting on nation-al donor lists since April. Breisinger died of pulmonary problems about 48 hours after the donated organ arrived at the hospital.

A homeless Gainesville man was ar-
rested Monday for kidnapping, sexu-
ally assaulting and forcing a woman into prostitution in a homeless camp.
Gainesville Police arrested Alphonso 
Perry Hinton, 41, for sexual assault, ag-gravated battery, forced prostitution and false imprisonment, according to Alach-ua County Jail booking logs.
In April, Hinton lured a 32-year-old 
woman, whose name wasn’t released, with force and threats to Tent City , where he imprisoned and sexually as-saulted her from April 24 to May 14, said 
GPD spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias.
Hinton beat and strangled the wom-
an, police said. He also repeatedly raped and sodomized her.
According to a GPD arrest report, 
Hinton also forced the woman into pros-titution for his own ﬁ  nancial beneﬁ  t. If 
she refused, Hinton would beat her until she complied.
Tobias said the woman was too 
scared to try to escape.
On May 14, the woman was able to 
escape and contact authorities, Tobias said. Police did not make an arrest be-cause Hinton was in the hospital at the 
time.
Police arrested Hinton on Monday at 
the Rush Lake Motel on Southwest 16th 
Avenue.
According to police, Hinton and the 
woman were in a relationship and have a child together.
As of Monday night, Hinton was in 
Alachua County Jail. Bond had not been 
set.

Gainesville was recently named the top 
city in the state for Forbes magazine’s 14th 
annual “Best Places for Business and Ca-reers.”
Gainesville ranked higher than 16 oth-
er Florida cities on the list to take the top spot.
Nationally, the city is ranked No. 101 
out of the 200 cities listed.
The magazine based the rankings on sev-
eral factors, including costs of living and doing business in a city, education of the labor force and number of highly-ranked colleges in an area, according to Forbes’ 
website.
Gainesville’s ranking came as no sur-
prise to city commissioner Thomas Hawk-
ins.
Hawkins attributed the city’s affordable 
living costs, small size and government services that helped Gainesville rise above other Florida metro areas on Forbes’ list.
Abhi Lokesh and his partner, Alex Theo-dore, founded the Gainesville-based photo company Fracture in 2009.
Lokesh, 24, said he chose to start the 
company in Gainesville because of the city’s affordable cost of living and tight-knit network of university professors and professionals.
“You mix that with a very hungry and 
a very talented student population, I think that is a very unique formula for success that not a lot of cities and municipalities can match,” he said.

Vendetta against 
drugs is misguided
On Monday, United States Senator Charles E. Schumer 
(D-N.Y.), officially won his battle against the now-infamous synthetic drug bath salts — the substance 
that supposedly caused Rudy Eugene to eat a man’s face on a causeway in Miami back in May.
Well, that’s the story everyone believed until a toxicology 
report revealed that the only drug in Eugene’s system was marijuana, which hasn’t been associated with violent activity since the debunked propaganda film “Reefer Madness.”
Still, the toxicology report didn’t stop Congress from pass-
ing a bill on June 27 banning bath salts nationwide, the same day the report was released. It also didn’t give pause to Presi-
dent Barack Obama, who signed this bill Monday.
Who’s against banning harmful substances, right? Drug 
prohibition always keeps it off the streets and out of the hand 
of criminals.
But the hysteria surrounding bath salts after the cannibal-
istic attack in Miami did not spur the push for this legislation. In fact, Schumer, who is known as a bit of a control freak for banning things like the alcoholic energy drink Four Loko, has been trying to push this legislation since January 2011.
However, the incident in Miami and the subsequent bath 
salt mania promoted by the police and local media helped the senator push through his ill-conceived legislation.
The sheer irresponsibility of the police and the local media 
outlets that caused this hysteria deserves serious ridicule.
The toxicology report indicates that police had absolutely 
no evidence to suspect that Eugene was using bath salts dur -
ing his attack. When the local media reported these unfound-ed police suspicions, it gave bath salts and other synthetic substances the national attention needed to add more useless 
layers to federal drug policy.
In fact, a quick look at Eugene’s record shows a severe his-
tory of violent behavior, a more likely explanation for his ac-
tions.
In 2004, a 22-year-old Eugene was arrested after threaten-
ing and attacking his mother. According to what Eugene’s mother told police, he threatened her by saying, “I’ll put a gun to your head and kill you.”
This incident was not Eugene’s only arrest (he was also 
arrested in 2008 for possession of marijuana), but it clearly shows that his violent streak did not begin on the causeway in Miami.
The incident involving Rudy Eugene reveals two very im-
portant truths.
First, it shows that unfounded hysteria can have serious 
consequences for public policy, especially when it comes to drug-like substances.
Second, the fact that a violent, perhaps mentally ill person 
like Eugene was involved in the black-market sale of mari-
juana shows the errors of federal drug prohibition.
Instead of providing protection, prohibition puts popular 
drugs in the hands of violent people.End the ‘Photoshop’ standard of beauty

Don’t know what for,You’re turning heads when you walk through the door,Don’t need makeup,To cover up,Being the way that you are is enough.”When I first heard their song “What Makes You Beauti-
ful” (hereinafter, WMYB), I wasn’t really buying into what they were saying. The whole song sounded like a vague at-tempt to flatter a girl just to get into her consenting pants.
(This is not a critique of boy bands’ lyrics. I’m sorry I ever 
heard Nick Carter sing “If you want it to be good girl, get yourself a bad boy” as a 6-year-old.)
Now, if we take WMYB at face value, and not at creep-
ily persuasive value, it’s sending a very strong and positive message to girls across the world. We don’t always remem-ber how hard growing up is now that some of us are on the other side of it.
Self-image and self-esteem are two incredibly important 
qualities that need nurturing basically forever. But it is much harder to keep a positive outlook on those traits when you’re a girl.
Pop culture is the biggest communicator of what’s cool 
or hip or “in.” So when magazines such as Seventeen and Teen Vogue are being asked to review their Photoshop pol-icy , that’s not OK. There should barely even be a policy to review, but whatever.
Seventeen magazine recently listened to a petition led by 
14-year-old Julia Bluhm.
The magazine released a Body Peace Treaty last week that 
vows to “never change girls’ body or face shapes,” “always feature real girls and models who are healthy ,” “be totally upfront about what goes into our photo shoots,” help read-ers “make the best choices” for their bodies, and help ensure confidence in everyone.These all sound like awesome 
rules!
So, why wasn’t the publication 
doing them in the first place?
This debacle reminds me of 
a decade ago when Barbie’s new waist and bust measurements were revealed.
Apparently Mattel didn’t make 
the change to teach a healthier lesson to young girls but did it to conform to the “reality of fashion.”
My reality of fashion is radically different from the hip-
hugger jeans Mattel wanted Barbie to wear.
Our reality shouldn’t be to shame girls into fitting fic-
tional standards of beauty. Our reality should be to embrace all body types while being compassionate about our differ -
ences.
Maybe the insecure girls One Direction sings about 
wouldn’t be so abundant if we showed them healthier ex-amples to follow.
A petition for Teen Vogue to adopt new policies had more 
than 22,000 signatures out of the necessary 25,000 at publica-tion time.
“It’s time for an end to the digitally enhanced, unrealistic 
‘beauty’ we see in the pages of magazines,” said Teen V ogue petition authors Carina Cruz and Emma Stydahar. “We are demanding that teen magazines stop altering natural bod-ies and faces so that real girls can be the new standard of beauty.”
I think there’s a time in every girl’s life when she sat down 
to compare herself to the images of women in mass media.
She’s then faced with the fact that she doesn’t look like 
any of the beautiful people.
It’s up to us to either be OK with that or to change our -
selves according to society’s rules.

In another era, the affliction of AIDS — a disease surrounded 
by fear, misinformation and lack of medical expertise — was a 
death sentence. Although we have since grown to understand 
this disease, there is still much to learn about possible unintended 
consequences of its treatment.
In a study by Dr. Daniel Klein at the Kaiser Permanente in 
northern California, higher rates of coronary heart disease have been found in patients with HIV . With already-high rates of heart disease, more research and policy must be directed toward these health initiatives.
From the baseline characteristics of Klein’s research project, 
“Contribution of Immunodeficiency to Coronary Heart Disease: Cohort Study of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected Kaiser Perma-nente Members,” a comparison between HIV-positive and -nega-
tive patients showed startling results. Klein found that individuals with HIV had a higher chance of smoking and abusing alcohol and 
showed higher rates of cardiovascular heart disease. Among those with HIV , higher rates of myocardial infarction were also linked. 
These rates were much higher than control subjects who did not 
have HIV .
What is it about HIV that can increase rates of heart disease? 
Some facts about the nature of HIV treatment should give us some 
hints.
HIV infections can cause inflammation, and antiretroviral 
therapy used to delay the progression of AIDS can increase heart disease risk. Some information from “The AIDS Beacon” in Au-
gust 2010 suggested that, “ … a person’s blood pressure and CD4 
count (white blood cell count) con-tributed most significantly to the 
risk of heart attack.”
There isn’t a consensus about 
the influence of antiretroviral therapy on the rates of heart disease 
in HIV patients. Dr. Georg Behrens presented his findings at the 
2010 International AIDS Conference. Antiretroviral medications 
used to treat HIV increase cholesterol levels and influence fat de-
posits in the body.
More specifically , fat distribution is more likely to be placed in 
the abdominal region. Multiple other factors could also contribute to heart disease, like smoking and alcohol abuse as discussed ear -
lier.
In Klein’s own words, “Over the last year, it has become clear 
that factors [such as changes in] glucose metabolism and dyslipi-demia [high cholesterol levels], and also … central obesity, induced 
by HIV therapy, contribute to … later cardiovascular disease.”
While the research has begun and should still be adequately in-
vestigated, there are measures already in place that can attack both 
HIV and heart disease independently.
In July 2010, the Obama administration launched its own pri-
orities for controlling the rates of HIV and AIDS infections. This 
program includes prevention efforts in communities where the disease is most evident, including minority groups, homosexuals, 
bisexuals, males, etc.
Increasing education and vigilance about HIV prevention is vi-
tal, along with community-level outreach, increased providers of 
clinical care services, and so on. A faithful attempt at coordinating efforts between the U.S. federal government and state, local and 
territorial governments can have a multiplier effect on coordina-
tion and prevention.
There is very little suspicion that most Americans are aware of 
the pervasiveness of cardiovascular illnesses. The findings from 
the Center of Disease Control’s publication “Summary Health 
Statistics for U.S. Adults: National Health Interview Survey , 2010” 
now suggests that more than 27 million adults have been diag-
nosed with heart disease. This is almost 12 percent of the U.S. adult population. In just 2010, the estimated cost of health care treatment 
in the United States was close to $444 billion.
It is frustrating when ongoing scientific research cannot find 
solutions to today’s problems, inflicting patients with debilitating 
illnesses. While the exact correlation between HIV and cardiovas-cular heart disease isn’t clear, there is a link.
Work still remains on the effects of antiretroviral therapy and 
its increased strain on the heart. Awareness is priority, and only through patience and research can we reduce afflictions of both HIV and heart disease.

Speaking OutIn its decision in National Federation of Indepen-
dent Businesses v. Sebelius, the Supreme Court ruled that the Commerce Clause does not give 
the federal government the power to force indi-viduals to purchase health insurance. In doing so, the Court very clearly indicated that the scope of the Commerce Clause is limited. Many people were 
taken aback by this decision. After all, the Court 
vastly expanded the scope of the Commerce Clause during the Great Depression. Didn’t the Depression prove, once and for all, that the federal government needs more power to regulate the economy than a 
pre-1930s reading of the Commerce Clause would 
allow?
The popular narrative of the Depression is rather 
straightforward. In the 1930s, free markets failed 
spectacularly, and as a result of the judiciary’s nar -
row interpretation of the Commerce Clause, the fed-
eral government did not have the tools needed to prevent the catastrophe. Only with a significant ex-pansion of its powers under the Commerce Clause 
was the federal government able to enact the policies 
that created and sustained the economic recovery.
But while this narrative may be convenient, it is 
nonetheless incorrect.
In fact, the Great Depression was primarily the 
result of a monetary collapse, not the stock market crash. The stock market’s nosedive can at most ac-count only for the acceleration of the economic de-cline at the end of 1929. Both the start of the econom-
ic decline in August of that year and the catastrophic 
meltdown that began in 1931 were due to policy er -
rors made by the Federal Reserve.
In 1928, despite the absence of inflationary pres-
sures, the Federal Reserve began to raise interest rates, which increased the cost of borrowing money. After Great Britain’s departure from the gold stan-dard in September 1931, people began to suspect that the U.S. might also abandon gold and began 
to withdraw dollar-denominated deposits en masse 
from American banks, precipitating numerous bank runs. The Federal Reserve could have prevented the wave of bank failures if it had acted as a lender of 
last resort. Instead, widespread bank failures caused 
the money supply and financial intermediation to collapse. By March 1933, prices and economic out-put had fallen by about a third since 1929.
The federal government possessed the tools 
needed to prevent the economic catastrophe — it has always had the authority to determine monetary and exchange rate policy. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve was set up in 1913 
precisely in order to pre-
vent the kind of financial panics that occurred from 
1931 to 1933. If the government had not committed itself to an unworkable system of fixed exchange 
rates and the Federal Reserve had fulfilled its role 
as a lender of last resort, the downturn would have been, at absolute worst, no more than a garden-va-riety recession.
The common belief that New Deal-era policies 
were responsible for the recovery is also mostly wrong. In fact, many “real business cycle” economists argue that the New Deal was responsible for making the Depression longer than it otherwise would have 
been. On the other side, many “New Keynesian” 
economists argue that two federal government poli-cies did contribute to the recovery. First, President Franklin Roosevelt ended the gold standard and explicitly committed to raising the price level to its 
previous peak, drastically increasing inflationary ex-
pectations and reducing real interest rates. Second, the federally directed rehabilitation of the financial system allowed financial intermediation — the flow 
of lending from savers to borrowers — to recover. 
However, most New Keynesian economists would probably also agree that the rest of the New Deal — the alphabet soup of new government agencies, policies to reduce competition in product markets, 
support for labor unions, higher minimum wages — 
were, at best, largely irrelevant to the recovery and obviously reduced the economy’s potential output in the long run. Put simply, the economic policies 
that contributed to the recovery only required pow-
ers that the federal government already possessed prior to the enactment of the New Deal.
Thus, prior to the 1930s, the federal government 
already had sufficient powers to prevent the Great 
Depression. Furthermore, those parts of the New 
Deal that did, in fact, contribute to the economic re-covery were already constitutional prior to the ex-pansion of the Commerce Clause.
Perhaps the federal government really does need 
more power than is granted by an originalist inter -
pretation of the Commerce Clause. But the Great Depression is not evidence in favor of this proposi-tion.

STAFF REPORT
    
 Although the 2012 season is over 
and the U.S. Olympic trials are ﬁ  nished, 
that didn’t stop three Gators from com-peting last weekend. Marquis Dendy, Jeremy Postin and Eddie Lovett all 
participated in the North American, 
Central American and Caribbean Un-der-23 Track and Field Championships in Guanajuato, Mexico.
  Freshman Dendy led the NACAC 
U-23 off for the Gators in the long jump Friday . He used a wind-aided jump of 7.68 meters to win the gold. His mark just edged out Team USA teammate 
Kendall Spencer by a half inch.
  Dendy’s win at the NACAC U-23 
brings his total to eight ﬁ  rst-place ﬁ  n-
ishes in 2012.  He is also the second Gator to win the long jump title after Christian Taylor won in 2010.
  After being the highest-ﬁ  nishing 
collegian at the U.S. Olympic Trials in the hammer throw, Postin, a ju-
nior, grabbed the gold Saturday at the 
NACAC U-23. Postin used a throw of 68.32 meters to earn his 10th victory of the year.
  In addition to 
his school records in weight throw (21.60 meters) and 
hammer throw (70.73 meters), Postin is also the ﬁ  rst Gator to claim a throwing title at the NACAC U-23.
  Sophomore hurdler Lovett was 
the ﬁ  nal Gator to compete at the meet. The All-American ran a 13.58 to ﬁ  nish fourth in the 110-meter hurdles.
  Dendy and Postin’s wins increased 
the number of titles won by Gators at the NACAC U-23 to 11.
  With the NACAC U-23 over, Flor-
ida will send ﬁ  ve competitors to Bar-celona, Spain to compete in the 2012 
IAAF World Junior Track and Field 
Championships starting today. The six-day championship will include All-Americans Ciarra Brewer (triple jump) and Taylor Burke (high jump). 
  The meet will also showcase in-
coming freshmen Arman Hall, Robin Reynolds and Shayla Sanders. Hall will run in the 400 meters as well as the 
4x400-meter relay. Reynolds will com-
pete in the long jump, and Sanders will run in the 4x100-meter relay and is an alternate in the 100 and 200 meters.  Florida 
wins three 
events at 
U-23 meet
THE ALLIGATOR AWARDS
  As part of The Alligator Awards recogniz-
ing the best in UF athletics during the 2011-12 season, columnists Joe Morgan 
and Corey McCall will debate two of the ﬁ  ve nominees in each week’s category. Vote for the winner online at alligatorSports.org.
  Joe: Baseball may no longer be America’s 
pastime, but it has always been mine, and Jonathon Crawford gave me one of my fa-vorite memories with my favorite sport. I had the good fortune of covering the sopho-more right-hander’s no-hitter against Bet-hune-Cookman in the NCAA Gainesville Regional opener on June 1. Crawford’s gem was the ﬁ  rst no-hitter I have seen in person, and it could very well be the last. Florida had many athletes go above and beyond the call 
of duty this season, but Crawford’s no-no 
stands above the rest. Not only did he domi-nate the Wildcats in his ﬁ  rst-ever postseason start, but Crawford delivered for the top-
ranked Gators on a national stage. Florida’s 
postseason run ended with a winless Col-
lege World Series showing — a development made all the more shocking considering how invincible the Gators looked with Crawford 
on the mound in their postseason opener.
  Corey: All this baseball talk is making me 
sleepy, “now back to the good part.” Remem-
ber back in September when Chris Rainey 
single-handedly ran Florida’s offense? Not only was he putting up stats to contend for the Heisman, but he even made people be-lieve Florida had a chance against Alabama. What a joke that turned out to be, but the reason it was even considered was because of Rainey. Everybody knew the defense was solid, but after that 2010 season, the offense remained in serious doubt. That all changed in one game: a 33-23 victory against a sur-prisingly strong Tennessee team, headlined by a “Time to Die” statement from the man himself. One game later, Florida was 4-0 and heading into the meat of their sched-ule with the No. 12 ranking and champion-ship dreams. Sure it turned out just like John 
Carter, but at least this version had a Liam Neeson cameo.
  Joe: Well, the “Time to Diesman” cam-
paign bit the dust once Rainey ran into a real opponent in the Crimson Tide. The Volunteers ﬁ  nished 5-7 last season. We are talking about a team Tennessee coach Derek Dooley compared to the confused German forces at Normandy during World War II. Meanwhile, Bethune-Cookman posed a for-midable threat to Crawford despite its No. 4 ranking in the NCAA Gainesville Regional. The Wildcats were coming off the heels of a seventh straight Mid-Eastern Athletic Con-ference title, and they had played the Gators close in an 8-6 loss Feb. 21. Besides, keeping an opponent hitless — regardless of stature — is very impressive. Even someone as un-talented as Pitbull records a hit every once in a while.
  Corey: I seem to have missed those hits 
Pitbull put out, and the ones that classify Bethune-Cookman as a “formidable foe.” Ranking 193rd in the country last year, the 
Wildcats dished out a whopping .269 team 
batting average, with only three people hit-ting over .300, one of which didn’t even touch the ﬁ  eld against Florida. On the other hand, 
Rainey led a less-than-mediocre offense to a 
crucial victory early in the season. Say what 
you will about Tennessee, but they had a sol-id defense, ranking in the top 30 nationally, even with injuries and depth issues plaguing 
them throughout the season. With this being 
the ﬁ  rst conference game, the Volunteers de-fense was at full strength, and despite it all,

  I don’t care about the Home Run Derby.
  Prince Fielder won last night’s slugfest at 
Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City, Mo., with 28 
long balls. I saw none of them.
  As much as I love baseball, the Home Run Derby 
is unwatchable. It is nothing more than a gloriﬁ  ed 
batting practice made all the more annoying with Chris Berman repeatedly barking, “Back, back, back, back, back!”
  You may like the Home Run Derby just ﬁ  ne, and 
I can respect that. Some folks enjoy the sheer display of power. Others liked baseball better with rampant performance-enhancing drug use.
  However, if you are not in attendance, your in-
terest fades faster than the longest home runs of the night. If I don’t have the chance to catch a souvenir, watching All-Stars hit batting-practice pitches into the seats holds little appeal.
  Despite my issues with the Home Run Derby, I do 
not believe it is beyond saving. Here are a few chang-es I would like to see in the mid-summer smashing contest:
Targets/Goals – Most All-Stars can mash batting-
practice lobs over the fences. At the end of the day , it’s just not that impressive. Let’s see some precision. Can Prince Fielder go to the opposite ﬁ  eld repeated-ly? How many times can a 35-year-old Carlos Beltran surpass 400 feet? Assuming home runs are worth one point each, hitting a target would earn batters addi-tional points. Quality over quantity, people.
Pitch limit – The last thing any baseball fan wants 
to see is Robinson Cano take a bunch of pitches in a 
row. Take the bat off your shoulder! Each batter gets 
10 strikes, and that is it. Use an umpire if necessary.
  Live pitching – Ozzie Smith could look like Hank 
Aaron in the right ballpark if you lobbed him beach balls all day. The derby needs live pitching. Facing a mix of fastballs and breaking balls would truly de-termine the game’s best slugger. MLB can determine who pitches. Perhaps auditioning free agents could get involved. Knuckleballers would be cool.
Intriguing locations – I know putting on the 
Home Run Derby is a big deal for the All-Star Game’s hosting city , but fans always see home runs in stadiums. Take a page from the Class-A South Atlantic League’s book and have the derby on 
the ﬂ  ight deck of an aircraft 
carrier. Other awesome lo-cations: the Grand Canyon, a mountain (Coors Field 
does not count), the Death Star.
  Compensation – Calm down! I know the All-Stars 
already roll in the dough, but hear me out. These guys play a grueling, 162-game schedule and truly deserve a mid-season break. Getting baseball’s best 
home-run hitters to compete in an ultimately mean-
ingless Home Run Derby may take a bit of cash. Trust me, they will likely give the money to charity . If not, sports fans love villains. Boo those men!
  Love my suggestions or hate them, I do not care. If 
you are completely satisﬁ  ed with how the Home Run Derby plays out each year, then I am happy for you. You probably had a great time watching last night’s broadcast.
  I believe the format is tired and outdated. My sug-
gested changes may never make it off this page, but something needs to be done to shake up the Home Run Derby.
  Otherwise, fans will “back, back, back, back, back” 
away from their television screens.

in the country, Bullard gives the Gators depth on a depleted defen -

Dante Fowler Jr. (St. Petersburg, Fla.) turned 
heads when he made his signing day flip from Florida State to Florida. He experienced a hiccup on his way to Florida though. The school accept -
ed the five-star defensive end the afternoon of July 2. Fowler is rooming with freshman running back Matt Jones. The third-ranked defensive end in the country is expected to participate in offsea -
son workouts. With the torn ACL to junior Ronald 
Powell during the spring game, Fowler will compete for playing time 
in the fall.
While Bullard and Fowler received good news, 
Dante Phillips  (Venice, Fla.) did not. The four-
star defensive tackle arrived in Gainesville only to learn he will not be able to attend Florida. The NCAA Clearinghouse declared him eligible, but the school denied Phillips admission. Phillips 
committed to the Gators back in 2010 under Ur -
ban Meyer. Now, Phillips is examining his options 
with Miami and Ole Miss rumored to be possible 
destinations. Unfortunately for Phillips, many schools already filled their recruiting classes.

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
  MIAMI — Ray Allen lingered on 
the court for a bit after his Boston 
Celtics lost Game 7 of the Eastern Conference ﬁ  nals to the Miami Heat last month, shaking hands and offer-
ing congratulations.
  A few minutes later, Allen made 
a vow about his future.
  “There’s still a lot of basketball 
left in my legs,” he said.
  The Heat apparently were listen-
ing, apparently agree — and will 
soon ofﬁ  cially welcome Allen to their club.
  Allen told the Heat on Friday 
night that he intends to accept their contract offer and leave Boston after ﬁ  ve seasons, even though the Celtics could have paid him about twice as much as the reigning NBA champi-ons will be able to next season. Mi-ami could only offer Allen the mini mid-level, worth about $3 million a 
year.
  Heat owner Micky Arison tweet-
ed the news just after 9:30 p.m. Fri-
day , or about 2:30 a.m. Saturday in Europe, where Arison has been for several days.
  “I was just woken up with great 
news,” Arison wrote. “Welcome to the family.” Arison ended the tweet 
by making mention of Allen’s jer-
sey No. 20, but didn’t mention the NBA’s leading 3-point shooter by name. No matter — Allen’s agent, James Tanner, conﬁ  rmed the plan to The Associated Press moments later.
  A person briefed on details of the 
decision told the AP that Arison got 
the word from team president Pat 
Riley , who made Allen the team’s top free-agent priority — especially in recent days. Allen, who will be 37 this month, arrived in Miami on Thursday for a visit, went to din-ner with Riley, coach Erik Spoelstra, team executive Alonzo Mourning and others Thursday night, then left Friday to presumably decide his fu-ture.
  Hours later, the choice was 
known. Allen, who made a career-
best 45 percent of his 3-point at-
tempts this past season, cannot ofﬁ  -cially sign until Wednesday because of the league’s moratorium.
  “HeatNation continues to grow,” 
Heat guard Dwyane Wade wrote on Twitter late Friday night. And Heat forward LeBron James, the league’s reigning MVP and Finals MVP , 
added “please welcome our new-
est teammate Ray Allen” with the hashtag of “Wow.”
  It’s the latest free-agency coup 
for Riley.
  During the blockbuster summer 
of 2010, the Heat convinced James, Wade and Chris Bosh all to take less money than they could have got-ten elsewhere in that offseason, so there would be enough room left to add players like Udonis Haslem and Mike Miller (who both also took 
smaller contracts) and Mario Chalm-
ers. Then last summer, Shane Battier accepted a deal that will pay him $3 million annually.
  The approach clearly worked.  Next fall, the Heat will raise a 
championship banner, and Allen will be with them for the title de-fense.
  Wade and James both were in-
volved on some level in the recruit-ment of Allen. James took to Twitter and Facebook in recent days to let his millions of followers know how much he wanted to see Allen in a Heat uniform, and Wade tweeted on Wednesday that the next day — the one where Allen was visiting 
— would be a big one for the fran-
chise.
  In the end, it appeared that the biggest push — again — came from Riley , who said before free agency started that Miami had identiﬁ  ed “ﬁ  ve or six” clear targets to add to 
the roster. He never speciﬁ  cally said 
Allen, and given how James was let-ting the secret out on Twitter any-way, Riley didn’t have to say any-thing else.
  New Orleans Hornets guard 
Jarrett Jack asked his followers in a tweet about an hour after the Allen story broke if he was “wrong for 
thinking ray allen is a traitor” for 
signing with Miami. Even NFL stars were reacting Friday night. Phila-delphia Eagles quarterback Michael Vick used the following hashtags on Twitter to describe his reaction to Allen’s decision: “loaded,” ‘’ﬁ  nal-piece” and “notfair.”
  There are probably more than a 
few people in Boston who would agree.
  Miami is still hoping to add at 
least one more piece through free agency , and is expected to meet this weekend with Marcus Camby (who would most likely have to be acquired through a sign-and-trade if he was to wind up with the Heat) 
and Rashard Lewis.
  Earlier this week, the Celtics re-
portedly agreed on a $15 million, 
three-year deal with shooting guard Jason Terry. But Boston also wanted to keep Allen, with general manager Danny Ainge quoted in recent days saying “we really want Ray to come back. Time will tell.”
  Allen has made an NBA-record 
2,718 3-pointers. He was mentioned in some trade possibilities this past season — a deal was nearly struck with Memphis — and Allen even-tually lost his starting job to Avery Bradley. Allen needed surgery ear-lier this offseason to remove bone spurs from his right ankle, though 
he said when the Celtics were ousted 
from the playoffs by the Heat for the second straight year that his playing days were not over.
  “It’s hard to say what can hap-
pen, what may happen,” Allen said after Game 7 of the East ﬁ  nals this year.  He said those words in Miami. 
Not even a month later, Allen — who helped the Celtics win the 2008 NBA title — decided to join the Heat. 
 Allen plans to leave Celtics, take less money to sign with Heat
“There’s still a lot of bas-
ketball left in my legs.”

David Carr / Alligator Staff
Sophomore Jonathon Crawford reacts after teammates threw a pie in his face following 
his no-hitter against Bethune-Cookman in the NCAA Gainesville Regional opener June 1.
Rainey put up Heisman-quality numbers. He 
led the team in rushing (108), receiving (104), and even added in a punt block and 21 punt-return yards to put his total at 233 all-purpose 
yards. Add a touchdown and you have the 
best individual performance this season.
Joe: I will grant you that Rainey domi-
nated Tennessee, but he had plenty of help 
from a staunch run defense. The Volunteers had minus-nine yards on the day, which kept their offense from doing much of anything for the first three quarters. Crawford does not hit, and he benefitted from stellar defensive play behind him — I’m looking at you, Casey Turgeon. However, Crawford controlled the game against Bethune-Cookman. He allowed just one base runner, Wildcats designated hit-ter Jake Welch, on a third-inning walk. Gators catcher Mike Zunino gunned down Welch trying to steal second soon after. Crawford, who was left off Florida’s 2011 College World Series roster, faced the minimum and fired first-pitch strikes to 20 of the 27 batters Bet-hune-Cookman sent to the plate. His control was sharp, and he registered at 98 mph on the radar gun in the ninth inning. Crawford is a great pitcher with a bright future, but his no-hitter was a once-in-a-lifetime performance. The last Gator to throw a no-hitter before Crawford was John Burke, who held Furman hitless in the 1991 NCAA East Regional. See-ing another performance like Crawford’s masterpiece is less likely than a Best Picture Oscar nomination for John Carter.
Corey: I’ll admit that no-hitter was im-
pressive, but if you had waited one more day you would have seen the College of Charles-ton come just short of a perfect game against Bethune-Cookman with two hits allowed in the sixth of an 8-2 win. A no-hitter may be tough to come by, but if I want to see one in my lifetime, all I need to do is wait until next season when UF plays B-CU again. Switch-ing back over, Rainey was able to account for 61 percent of the offensive production on the day. Tennessee may have had negative rushing yards, but their offense did enough to keep the time of possession virtually the same for either team. And where Crawford had one of the nation’s best defenses behind him, Rainey proved he could be part of the 
defense by blocking a punt. Seeing a perfor -
mance like that again is less likely than us not 
making more John Carter references.
Joe: Speaking of great performances, how 
about Taylor Kitsch in John Carter? Epic.
