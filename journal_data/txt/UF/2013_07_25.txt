UF’s Student Senate initially OK’d the 
2014-2015 Activity and Service Fee Budget 
on Tuesday — and it’s about $1.2 million less than this year’s.
The new budget totals $17,798,535. A reduc-
tion of that size hasn’t occurred in more than 20 years, budget and appropriations chairman Joseph Michaels said at the meeting.
The university did not ask for an increase 
in the student fee rate, which is $17.35 a credit hour. At the same time, Michaels said, there’s an anticipated decrease in the total amount of credit hours students will take — meaning less money.
“We wanted to make sure we were put-
ting the funding towards projects that would allow us to give students [things] that they would not have access to anywhere else in the nation,” he said.
For example, proposed cuts for RecSports 
included reducing gym hours and group fit-ness classes. But those were rejected, Michaels said, because they’re too important to stu-dents.
“We’re confident that this budget is going 
to serve the students,” he said.
Changes include Accent Speakers Bureau 
receiving about $34,000 less for its programs. Student Government Productions will get about $43,000 less. The newspaper readership program was eliminated.
Academic organizations will also receive 
about $75,000 less than in the 2013-2014 bud-get, but student organizations will see no change in funding.

Antonio Morrison is officially cleared.
State Attorney William Cervone issued a statement 
Tuesday announcing the state would drop two charges against the 19-year-old UF linebacker, who was arrested at about 3 a.m. Sunday after barking at a police dog.
Because the dog was sitting in the back of the police car on standby, Cervone wrote, it was not 
engaged in a police activity.
“The charge of interfering with a police 
animal requires malice, and none exists,” he wrote. “It also requires that the animal be engaged in some official duty.”
Based on a video from the patrol car 
dashboard, Cervone wrote, Morrison did not resist arrest but rather questioned the officers’ actions.
Morrison was not legally at fault, Cervone wrote, and 
as far as issues of Morrison’s and the officers’ conduct, he said he will defer to Coach Will Muschamp and Sheriff Sa-die Darnell. 
“I would expect that Morrison has learned that being 
out at that hour of the night under those circumstances is setting himself up for a situation where he could risk and lose a great deal,” Cervone wrote.
Morrison will be suspended for at least two games at 
the beginning of the upcoming season, Coach Will Mus-champ announced via Twitter on Sunday. Muschamp has not commented about whether he will change his decision because the charges were dropped.
The deferred prosecution agreement for Morrison’s 
June 16 arrest will remain the same, according to the state attorney’s statement.Antonio Morrison unleashed: State attorney drops chargesSHAFINA GHANIE

A city park will become 
a sanctuary for family and 
friends who have lost loved ones to suicide. 
Seven basalt columns will 
be erected at the new Survi-vors of Suicide Memory Gar-den at Cofrin Nature Park on Saturday from 8 a.m.-noon.
Six of the pillars will stand 
about 6 feet tall and represent people who are directly af-fected by a suicide, said Mar-shall Knudson, the director of the Alachua County Crisis Center. The columns will en-circle a shorter, broken pillar, which represents the person lost to suicide, he said. 
“For every suicide, there 
are at least six people who are significantly impacted by the death of a loved one,” Knud-son said.
Knudson said the design 
arranges the pillars symboli-cally in different groups. A cluster of three pillars repre-sents a family unit, a pair rep-resents a couple and the last one represents an individual person leaning toward the seventh broken pillar. 
Ashley Monaco, a 20-year-
old UF biology sophomore whose father committed sui-cide last year, said maybe the monument can help bring healing to others.
“It is heartening to hear 
about this monument because it is somewhere I can go to try and escape and heal,” Mo-naco said. “It’s comforting to know that I am not alone.”Memory garden to

Mini-cow born at Roy farm looks 
like panda bear 
ROY, Wash. — John Bartheld 
has been breeding miniature 
cows on his farm for seven years hoping to recreate black-and-white markings in the pattern of a panda to make a “panda cow.”
He succeeded on June 28 
when Peanut was born. From most angles, Peanut looks like the endangered Chinese bear with a big belt of white fur, a white face and black hair around the eyes.
Peanut never strays far from WHAT’S HAPPENING?
Gay Movie Night 
“Keep the Lights On” will be shown Friday. It chronicles an emotionally and sexually charged journey of love, friend-ship and addiction. In New York City in 1997, documentary filmmaker Erik and closeted lawyer Paul meet through a casual encounter and soon find themselves having a deeper connection. Over the course of a decade-long relationship de-fined by highs and lows, Erik struggles to define his personal boundaries and dignity, while Paul battles the demon of drug dependence. Gay Movie Night is a free service of the Pride Community Center of North Central Florida. A $2 donation is requested to cover the cost of snacks. The center is located at 3131 NW 13th St., Suite 62, in the Liberty Center. Check out www.gainesvillepride.org/gay-movie-night/.

Explore the archaeology of St. Augustine during a daylong trip with the Florida Museum of Natural History and Creative B on Aug. 3. Be one of the first his mom, Midget, who was artiﬁ  -cially inseminated. Another pan-da cow born July 3, a half-sister named Star, has similar markings, but not as well-deﬁ  ned.
Peanut is different and he 
knows it, Bartheld said.
“He’s got that cocky attitude. 
From the minute I laid eyes on him, I knew he was something special,” he said Friday.
Bartheld runs nine cattle and 
ﬁ  ve are registered miniatures. Two, Peanut and Star, are regis-tered with the International Min-iature Cattle Breeders Society and Registry, which is a division of Happy Mountain Farm in Coving-ton, Wash.
The four other cattle are full-
size cows sold as beef. The minia-tures are pets or novelties — “too expensive to butcher,” unless they grow too big.
“They butcher them all the 
time if they breed a miniature and it runs out 40- to 45-inches tall; it’s considered a mid-sized beef.”
Bartheld grew up around his 
grandparents’ dairy, and the farm, now 11 acres, has been in the fam-ily four generations. He has a full-time job with a concrete company in Tacoma, but “I always knew I was going to have cows.”

� ITS GOAL IS $15,000.
SAMANTHA SCHUYLER
Alligator Contributing Writer
If all goes according to plan, the 
familiar ticking whir of traditional 
projectors will soon be silenced at the Hippodrome Theatre.
On Monday, the theater 
launched an online campaign via www.kickstarter.com to raise $15,000 for a new digital projection system in response to the movie industry’s transition to a digital format.
Studios nationwide will discon-
tinue the use of 35-millimeter film reels starting in 2014. Cinemas that cannot accommodate the change will no longer receive a wide selec-tion of movies.
“Hollywood’s basically said, 
‘You go digital, or you go dark,’” said Hippodrome Cinema Direc-tor Alisha Kinman. “‘If you don’t make this change, you’re not go-ing to get the selection of films that we have.’”
While larger theaters have the funds to change immediately, Kin-man said the challenge for local, independent theaters like the Hip-podrome are small staffs and low budgets.
“You can’t really afford a 
$40,000 projector just out of pock-et,” Kinman said.  “I mean, that’s unrealistic.”
The Hippodrome will use 
$25,000 in grants for the transition, but intends to fund the rest using the Kickstarter website. Within about 24 hours of announcing the project, it had received about $1,000 in pledges.
However, Kickstarter cancels 
all pledges for projects that do not reach their funding goal within a specified time frame, which ends Sept. 20. 
Ryan Wolf, a 27-year-old ana-
lytical chemistry graduate student, frequently sees shows at the Hip-podrome and said he plans to do-nate online.
“I don’t want it to go away. 
They need help, and I’m in a posi-tion financially to support them,” he said. “So I will.”The Hipp kickstarts

A sign in front of Haile Village 
Bistro announcing the newborn 
Prince of Cambridge is Gaines-ville’s version of the traditional letter and easel in front of Buck-ingham Palace.
Prince George Alexander 
Louis was born to Britain’s Prince William and Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, Monday, and locals commemorated the occasion by popping Moët & Chandon cham-pagne, drinking tea and watching news updates.
The bistro, which holds about 60 people, was full of locals cel-ebrating with the former mother country Monday night.
Customers 
also gathered in the adjacent Queen’s Arms 
Pub to watch TV updates. 
“We’ve been 
waiting for this baby to come,” said Jayne Yaz-
di, co-owner of the bistro, 5323 SW 91st Terrace.
Inside, flag banners with pho-
tos of William and Kate hung from the ceiling. A second sign announcing the royal birth leaned against a set of china on a lace-cov-ered table. Paintings of the British royal family, loaned by local art-ist Barbara Tench, are displayed year-round at the establishment.
Marj Crago, a member of the 
Haile community bridge club, was at the bistro most of the afternoon, eating Welsh cakes and playing bridge.
The 16 bridge players and other 
customers applauded and cheered when they heard the news that George had arrived, she said.
“We’re not British, but of 
course we had been watching and waiting,” Crago said.

“I really kind of see a problem in that student 
organizations have double the budget that the aca-demic orgs do,” District D Senator Olga Rodriguez said. “We’re a flagship university, and we need to be providing the same amount of support to aca-demic orgs.”
College of Medicine Senator Jacob Burns said he 
thought academic organizations were using most of their money for travel. He said enabling travel is great but should not be “heavily budgeted for.”
One of the few gains in the budget was a rough-ly $53,000 increase in the salaries of Student Gov-ernment staff members. This is due in part to a state government mandate but also the addition of a marketing director position.
This, along with other changes, concerned Dis-
trict D Senator Daniella Saetta.
“[The budget] seems a lot like it’s very admin-
istratively-centric. It’s not student-centric,” she said. “We have cheaper options for a lot of these things.”
Senators will vote again on the budget at next 
week’s Senate meeting, which is scheduled for 7 p.m. Tuesday in the Chesterfield Smith Ceremonial Classroom (Holland Hall, Room 180).senA te , from page 1Prince George

� FHP RANKED NO. 4 IN U.S.
JEANNA ARROYO
Alligator Contributing Writer
In a national poll that asked 
1,000 people which state law en-
forcement uniform was the most attractive, Florida state troopers ranked No. 4. 
In the poll, taken by www.
uniformdating.com, Florida was bested by California, Texas and New York. 
All of the uniforms in the top 
five selections featured hats, ac-cording to the website. 
A news release about the sur-
vey results described the Florida state trooper uniform as warm and earth-toned with a “classic and smart” design. 
Lt. Jeff Frost, a Florida High-way Patrol public relations offi-cer, said the goal of the uniform is visibility and professionalism. 
“We have a distinctive uniform 
that easily recognizes us to the public as Florida Highway Patrol troopers,” Frost said. “When you look professional in uniform, it in-stills a sense of pride in the troop-ers and respect from the public.”
Some UF students, like 21-year-
old Santiago Alvarez, disagreed with the ranking. 
“The hat is foolish,” said Alva-
rez, a UF math student. “It’s like ‘You’re really giving me a ticket in that hat?’”
However, Rachel Reiss, an 18-
year-old UF political science stu-dent, said the uniform’s ranking could be a plus for the troopers. 
“I guess it’s an iconic way to 
bring attention to the defense sys-tem of the state,” Reiss said.FL: Where the temps are

For residents of apartment 
buildings, drinking water rates 
may be flooding to a new high.
Gainesville Regional Utilities 
is submitting a proposal to the City Commission suggesting an increase in drinking water rates for apartment buildings that share one water meter. The proposed hike would raise the price from $2.20 per 1,000 gal-lons of water to $3.75.
City Commissioner Thom-
as Hawkins said he isn’t sure when commissioners will vote on the proposal, but it is in budget and is being carefully considered. Because the city of Gainesville uses a tiered rate structure, Hawkins said, peo-ple who live in apartments and share one water meter are cur-rently at a disadvantage.
“Most apartment complexes, 
especially the older ones, only have one water meter,” Hawk-ins said. “People that live in an apartment pay a whole lot more for water than anyone else.”
Apartment buildings divide 
the water bill among the apart-ment units individually, Hawk-ins said.
But if people in some units 
consume more water than the residents they share a water me-ter with, they may be charged the lower rate that reflects their neighbors’ water usage.
Because the billing structure 
doesn’t penalize high water usage per unit, it discourages water conservation, Hawkins said.
The disadvantage of the 
hike, Hawkins said, is that it may discourage people from choosing to live in an in-town apartment complex, which usu-ally has a master water meter.
“If people are choosing from 
an in-town apartment complex that only has one meter, versus an out- of -town that has a me-ter for every apartment, it puts in-town lower on the list,” he said.
Gainesville resident John 
Fleming, the managing mem-ber of Trimark Properties LLC, shared similar concerns.
In an email to the city com-
mission, he wrote that the pro-posed rate increase would re-strict development citywide.
“Properties would be dis-
criminated against based on the meter type that serves them,” he wrote in an email. “All of our land use and zoning codes were developed to encourage denser development in the core of Gainesville … to combat ur-ban sprawl, traffic and parking issues … ”
GRU representatives were 
not available for comment.

The state’s department of health 
awarded UF with its ﬁ  rst Tobacco Free 
Florida Smoke Free Certiﬁ  cation on Wednesday.
UF’s residence halls and graduate 
apartment complex, The Continuum, received certiﬁ  cation through the pilot program, which recognizes buildings that establish non-smoking policies. 
“We’re honored that we have been 
chosen to be the beginning of this new anti-tobacco initiative in the state,” said UF president Bernie Machen.
Norb Dunkel, the UF associate vice 
president and director of housing and residence education, said designated smoking areas within buildings were established in 1985. 
In 1992, smoking was prohibited in all buildings but allowed outdoors. 
Eventually, UF declared the entire 
campus tobacco-free in 2010.
Although some people smoke on 
campus despite the rule, Student Body President Christina Bonarrigo said it’s rare and hasn’t been a major problem.
To enforce the no-smoking policy, 
UF prefers to rely on peer pressure rather than ofﬁ  cial regulation, said Florida Bridgewater-Alford, campus communications outreach director. If a person refuses to comply with UF’s policy, disciplinary actions can be taken. 
Bonarrigo said the tobacco-free 
program emphasizes the health risks of smoking and secondhand smoke.
“It’s no secret that Gators take pride 
in their achievements,” said Bonarrigo. “[The certiﬁ  cation] is in sync with our pursuit of excellence.”Tobacco Free Florida gives

A study by UF researchers will develop a program to help 
students with learning disabilities achieve academic success in 
science, technology, engineering and math ﬁ  elds. 
The study will match 50 undergraduate students registered 
with the UF Disability Resource Center to a mentorship team dedicated to help the students develop personally and profes-sionally. Researchers aim to implement the project this Fall.
UF received an $846,000 National Science Foundation grant 
for this project, according to a news release.
“Being potentially a student with a disability in a STEM ﬁ  eld 
is a feat within itself,” said Jim Gorske, director of the UF Dis-ability Resource Center and an investigator in the study. “The neatest thing is just the ability to help broaden the support to students with disabilities.”
The support team, which includes a Disability Resource 
Center counselor and STEM faculty member, will work with the students to improve their time management skills and help them communicate their needs to others.
Luis Zayas, a 19-year-old UF biology sophomore who was 
diagnosed with dyslexia and attention-deﬁ  cit disorder, said learning disabilities make it harder to get into STEM ﬁ  elds. But with hard work, people with learning disabilities can do the same things as those who do not have them, he said.Program in the works for STEM students with learning disabilitiesCAMPUS

We’d like to start off with an apology. OK, maybe a conces-
sion. Tuesday’s editorial about the new “Cosmos” series took a 
jab at Fox viewers in its closing line. As one online commenter rightly pointed out, we shouldn’t be creating walls when discuss-ing “Cosmos.” This isn’t reﬂ  ective of the spirit imparted by such a masterpiece. Carl Sagan said, “Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not ﬁ  nd another.” 
Now that that’s out of the way, our ﬁ  rst handout this week 
goes to an anonymous someone. In August of 1990, Danny Roll-
ing killed and mutilated ﬁ  ve students. These grotesque murders earned him the nickname of the “Gainesville Ripper.” For many years, a memorial for the deceased has been maintained on the 34th Street Wall. Every now and then, some person or group of people paints over the wall without knowing any better. 
That doesn’t mean it’s OK. The memorial, which once bore 
the names of the victims, is now splotched with white paint and bears something that looks like “MYA’O I LOVE.” For paint-ing over the 34th Street memorial, we give anon a for-wall-and-
country DART. 
Next, we would like to introduce you to a true champion. En-
ter Nada al-Ahdal, an 11-year-old girl with a passion that spread like wildﬁ  re on the Internet. In a YouTube video that recently went viral, al-Ahdal delivers the powerful story of her ﬂ  ight from her parents to avoid entering an arranged marriage. Her parents later threatened her with death, after which she reported them to the authorities.
“I’m better off dead. I’d rather die,” she said. For having the 
courage to pursue her dreams no matter what and setting an example for perhaps thousands of young girls like her who feel similarly oppressed, we give Nada al-Ahdal a you-know-to-
ﬁ  ght-for-your-right LAUREL. 
Back to Dartsville, a woman in Dubai was recently jailed af-
ter being raped. Norwegian interior designer Marte Deborah Dalelv recounted her story to the 10 or 12 police ofﬁ  cers —  all male —  who responded. After police took both her testimony and the alleged rapist’s testimony, she said they asked her, “Are you sure you called the police because you just didn’t like it?” “That is when I knew, ‘I don’t think they are going to believe me at all,’” she said. The 24-year-old was facing charges of having unlawful sex, making a false statement and illegal consumption of alcohol. She was pardoned three days ago, but this should never have happened in the ﬁ  rst place. We give the United Arab 
Emirates a DART, because women are human too.
For police injustice, we turn to Ofﬁ  cer Sean Christian of the 
New York City Police Department who seems to have forward-ed explicit photographs of  27-year-old Pamela Held from her phone to his own after Held’s possessions were conﬁ  scated. “It makes me sick,” said Held. “I don’t even want to think about what he’s done with them. The NYPD gets a DART for not 
bringing a pervert to justice.

Life’s story arc: From depression to resolution
“The Shawshank Redemption” has all the ingredients 
of a dismal movie. Its protagonist, Andy Dufresne, is hurled into a dark, dingy prison after being framed 
for murder. He spends years there battling anxiety and de-pression, not to mention fellow prisoners.
Yet the story as a whole feels happy because of what 
movie buffs call a narrative arc. The tension peaks half-way, when Andy feels hopelessly depressed, but it winds down into a conclusion, or epilogue, that lets you know he’s going to be happy.

prison, but thousands may identify with Andy’s internal struggle. A nationwide survey by the American College Health Association in 2011 revealed that about three out of ten students had felt “too depressed to function” in the year preceding the study.
Unlike movies, true stories about mental health often 
end too soon, without positive resolutions. In the spring of 2012, the UF community mourned for Michael Richard Ed-monds Jr., the journalism student who committed suicide by jumping from Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium.
True stories with happy endings can give hope to people 
who are depressed, but those who have them tend to keep quiet because of the stigma surrounding mental health is-sues. My story ended happily eight years ago, thanks to my supportive friends, family and a place called Castle. 
On the outside, the three-story Victorian home in Cam-
bridge, Mass., looked like a typical boarding school. About a dozen teenagers and I studied in the dining room and slept in bunk beds upstairs. In reality, Castle was a strict program for students with problems such as depression and substance abuse. Those who left without permission had to scrub ﬂ  oors and wash dishes for 15 to 25 hours.
A chain of events starting in elementary school led me 
there. In ﬁ  fth grade I began feeling lethargic, and it was increasingly tough for me to have fun or connect with friends. My mom tried sending me to a few therapeutic and disciplinary programs, but none improved my situ-ation.My outlook changed because 
of a series of people I met while at Castle, starting when I was 13. The school’s staff members — counseling students in their late 20s and 30s — were smart, friendly and relatable. 
The staff recommended that 
I start taking weekly walks with Ron Siegel, a therapist with a 
broad smile and a salt-and-pepper moustache. Ron, an as-sistant professor at Harvard Medical School, had a great sense of humor, and he naturally weaved his clinical knowledge into conversations without using jargon.
To fulﬁ  ll the school’s internship requirement, I worked 
as a ﬁ  lmmaker for a community cable station called CCTV. My then-supervisors, Jennifer Schmitt and Arthur Martins, became helpful friends and mentors. One of my ﬁ  rst mov-ies featured teens telling mom jokes. Being a 15-year-old boy, I was pretty sure it deserved an Oscar.
While I thank the staff at Castle, Ron and my friends at 
CCTV for improving my outlook, my mom deserves enor-mous credit for her generosity and patience. My mom quit her job so she could attend weekly meetings at Castle, and she brought me sushi each Tuesday.
Earlier this summer I had a dinner party for my former 
peers from Castle, and I was struck by how the group has evolved. Many of us now have healthy lifestyles, fun jobs and happy relationships with our partners and families. I stopped feeling depressed at 15, went to a regular high school at 16, then went to college.
As an angsty teen, I once compared Castle to Shaw-
shank because they seemed equally oppressive. Looking back as an adult, I realize the prison and the school were similar, but for a different reason. They were catalysts that transformed depressing circumstances into happy end-ings.

Juanita Frazier gently places a 
tiny porcelain box on her kitchen ta-
ble. The box, small enough to hold pennies or bobby pins, is painted with a swirl of flowers in vivid yel-lows, lavenders and greens. 
A single brush stroke is impos-
sible to detect. Frazier, who crafted the box herself, credits her precision to letting the brush do the painting for her.
“People come in and say, ‘I can’t 
even paint a straight line,’ ” she said. “No artist can paint a straight line. You let the brush do it for you.”
Frazier, 85, has managed Frazier 
Ceramic Shop, 8601 SW Williston Road, in Gainesville since 1971 after marrying her third husband and the shop’s founder, Ray Frazier, who established the business in 1951.  
She said she first became serious-
ly involved with ceramics in 1949 while living in Detroit. She started small, specializing in making jewel-ry and porcelain elves. In the early 1960s, she honed her ceramics skills in Texas under the tutelage of an in-structor in Fort Worth.
After the deaths of her first two 
husbands and years of travel, living in Michigan and Texas, she returned to Alachua County, her hometown. Then she connected with Ray Fra-zier, a friend of her mother’s.
“Ray was a bit of a psychic,” she 
said. “We were drawn together — we were soul mates.”
In January of 1992, Ray Frazier — a lifelong smoker — was diag-nosed with lung cancer at 79. He died that September, just short of 80 years old.
She said her upbringing on a 
farm in Lake City taught her to be especially adaptable to changes in life, including the deaths of her husbands. Farm life instilled in her a sense of self-sufficiency, and life after Ray Frazier, she said, had to keep moving.
“My first two words were ‘but-
terfly’ and ‘flower,’” she said. “So I guess I was just rooted in the soil.”
After her husband’s death, she 
became the primary shop owner and has since been a resource to Gainesville potters and sculptors of all skill levels. 
Her warehouse-style shop is 
filled wall-to-wall with glazes, clays, clay molds, unpainted sculp-tures and statues, brushes and oth-er specialty ceramics supplies. She also offers free art lessons.
In her decades of running the 
shop, she’s seen generations pass through rounds of art lessons. An influx of regular customers keeps the shop running, and she loves teaching new people the craft.
“Everyone is artistic,” she said. 
“You’re born with it. You just have to fertilize it.”

The last time I attended Mass I was 14 
years old. It was Easter Sunday. As we left the 
church and wandered cow-like into the after-noon sun, my family was overtaken by a mob of Stepford Catholics who wanted everyone to share what they’d given up for Lent that year. Answers were fairly uniform and equal in negligibility (chocolate, soda, dessert, soda, whiskey, chocolate, chocolate, ad infinitum). 
When it was my turn to recite what I ab-
stained from, I couldn’t remember — not that it mattered, because no one had been able to resist the formidable power of processed co-coa. It was experiences like this that led me to abstain from the Catholic religion, which I now count, ironically, as my longest running Lent streak.
Fast forward 11 years — yes, gross, I know, 
I’m 25 — where I work as a language assistant at UF’s English Language Institute, or, as it’s more commonly known, the ELI. At the start of each semester, I receive a new partner and batch of students who are so globally diverse they actually stretch the word “diversity” to the brink of its semantic margins. I’ve had students from Senegal, China, Turkey, Korea, Kuwait, Qatar, Russia, Japan, Iraq, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and the like. Roughly half of my students each year are Middle Eastern, and nearly all of the students from that region are practicing Muslims.
Though I have been with ELI for more 
than four semesters now, I have never before worked during the summer, which means I have never had to work during Ramadan. (Note: Ramadan rotates, so over time it takes place during every time of the year). Ramadan — for those who do not know — is observed through strict fasting, which means that from dawn until sunset there is no food and no drink — not even water.This year, Ramadan started on Tuesday, 
July 9, and on that particular day, this is what awaited me in class: the kind of moroseness typically reserved for a Monday when stu-dents are still in mourning over their lost week-end. All the Muslim students, chap-lipped and bleary-eyed, barely lifted their heads to acknowledge my horrible pun: “Jesus, what’s eating you guys?”
Now, while I may be an 
idiot, I am typically not stu-pid. However, my attempt to lessen the gravity of tradi-tion by making a pun about consumption with Jesus’ name sprinkled on top like a garnish was stupid.
Bad jokes aside, we moved through the 
day’s activity: a scavenger hunt where they literally ran from place to place trying to scrounge for data and statistics. Knowing they hadn’t eaten and couldn’t drink, I felt guilty for assigning what was essentially nothing more than a Scholastic-Olympic hybrid. I tried to empathize with them but could only conjure up the image of lax Catholics who laughed about lack of restraint in the face of chocolate.
“Starting tomorrow, I’m going to be fasting 
with you,” I said. One of my students looked at me like I was an idiot (and I clearly already stated that I’m not, remember?) and asked, “Why?”
“Traces of Catholic guilt,” I said. Crick-
ets. “Look. I know you guys are tired and thirsty and hungry, and so I’ll make you a deal. I’ll be tired and hungry and thirsty, too. That way, you have the security of knowing that I wouldn’t ask you to do anything that I wouldn’t do myself. And if I have to be up here doing my job, you have to be over there doing your job.” 
The class broke into murmurs of skepti-
cism, and I was given advice on how to best begin my fast. I ate dinner that night at 8:30, as instructed, went to bed early and set my alarm for 5 a.m. so I could eat before sunrise.
The next day, I would learn just how closely 
I toe the line between sincerity and stupidity.

This column is provided by Ariel Barnes, a 22-year-old major-
ing in international studies. Would you like to get some Me-
diocre Advice? 
Visit http://mediocreadvicegators.tumblr.com/askDear Mediocre Advice,
What’s the best compliment you can 
give a woman? Pretty, beautiful, hot, etc.?
Dear Friend,
Here’s the thing: There is a difference between women and girls. Girls care about 
being called pretty and probably still live under their parents’ roof. Girls think that 
guys who act like dicks but are at least good looking are oh-so-super cool and then chase after them. Women don’t care about that kind of crap and do not care about being called pretty. Looks are not the best thing she has going for her, and it’s not the best thing she can offer. It’s a petty compliment compared to being called funny, smart, sexy or remotely interesting. Women care about being able to impress and surprise you at times when you think they can’t. Personally, I want to keep you on the edge of your seat like you’re at a G-dd--n Cirque du Soleil show. Any minimal compli-
ment, like being called pretty, is not even going to get a woman’s attention.
Ariel Barnes
Dear Mediocre Advice,
Unfortunately, liking feet is considered weird to most people. What’s 
a non-creepy way to offer a foot massage to a girl whose feet hurt?
Dear Friend,
Just don’t go on Craigslist. You would probably get murdered or be the mur-
derer because I think that’s how that site works. Also, helping you get your foot 
fetish fill indirectly makes me an accomplice. Find a close friend who works long hours at a crappy job. This shouldn’t be hard if you still have friends get-ting their  undergraduate degrees. As long as you don’t walk up to random girls talking about how much you love feet — attached or not attached to their bod-
ies — I think you will only be considered mildly weird. Everybody wins!Dear Mediocre Advice,
Have you ever attempted to pee in a urinal?
Dear Friend,
No. My penis is too big to whip out in public bathrooms. I don’t like 
to startle people.
Dear Mediocre Advice,
Is it considered cheating if I’m at a club and I pay a guy in a man 
thong to rub his weiner on my face? Is it OK to like it? 
Dear Conflicted Fian cé,
I know what you’re thinking when you walk up to the dirty red carpet in 
front of a strip club and look up at the colorful neon sign reading some -
thing like “NUDE” or “DIX.” You’re thinking, “My mind is telling me no, but 
my body — my body is telling me YEEEAAAAAAH.” If you feel the need to go to a strip club and pay someone to rub his weiner on your face, you probably shouldn’t be in a relationship. Technically, it’s not cheating because you are not actually getting with the stripper, but it is definitely grounds for a break-up. If you like it, there is a whole new reason why you should reevaluate your relationship status. You certainly cannot have both. What is it going to be: your engagement or a man rubbing his wein -
er on your face through the thin layer of his sequined polyester thong?

We all know what employers 
want: high GPAs, dazzling letters 
of recommendation and  myriad extracurricular activities.
Arguably though, the most im-
portant section on a resume is the work experience.
Take advice from what several 
fellow UF students found as awe-some internship opportunities here in their own college town.
Law:Noa Marks, a UF business eco-
nomics major, works as a legal intern for UF’s Student Legal Ser-vices.
While at the office, Marks as-
sesses processed files in regard to property damage, housing and insurance.
After filing the information 
into the computer system, Marks generates statistics and important details that pertain to the incident so lawyers are able to decide on the proper course of action based on information from past, similar cases.
Marks said she has learned a 
lot from her internship. “What was really interesting about this is how many people truly believe their case is rare and they’re the only ones having their specific legal issues,” she said. “Students should never feel alone in that re-gard.” 
Business:Jerry Declasse is a psychology 
and business major at UF who ran into the CEO of the event app company, Feathr, at an Innova-tion Academy event.
Declasse works about 20  hours 
a week using “Twitter to increase brand presence and generate leads for the company.”
Declasse said he is excited 
about his internship. “I’m really into the start-up scene and en-trepreneurial spirit,” he said. He hopes to start his own business after receiving his college educa-tion, he said.
Journalism/Communications:Sophia Lee is a public relations 
major and director at HerMANu-al, an online women’s magazine devoted to empowering fellow fe-males in their love relationships.
Though HerMANual operates 
with a small, intimate staff, Lee said it has a broad international presence of about 41,000 visitors each  month.
Lee said she is responsible for “facilitating the internship pro-gram, creating public relations campaigns to expand our online presence and brainstorming ar-ticle ideas with the interns.”
In the grassroots stage of Lee’s 
internship, she was involved in the content development and lo-gistics of the women’s magazine startup.
Lee said 
she loves her internship be-cause of the people she gets to work with. “Our team is 
so close knit and respectful of one another, and it’s truly a unique experience that’s difficult to find elsewhere.”
Medical:Christine Adams is a pre-den-
tal student, biotechnology ma-jor and research assistant at Dr. Özlen Yilmaz’s lab at the Emerg-ing Pathogens Institute at UF.
At the lab, Adams is respon-
sible for daily tasks like cleaning labware and updating monthly expenditure reports, but she is also in charge of preparation, which includes testing samples, running experiments, and pas-saging bacteria.
“I really enjoy laboratory work 
and learning new techniques and seeing results that help the oth-er members of the lab,” Adams said.
Whether it’s researching legal 
cases, tweeting, writing up cam-paigns or running purity sam-ples, Gainesville certainly has a lot to offer in terms of internship opportunities. Check out UF’s Career Resource Center, listserv or hallway bulletin board the next time you’re looking for a resume booster.

After 24 hours and countless 
cups of coffee, the film teams ar-
rived at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts to see their mov-ies go from the computer screen to the big screen.  
Exhausted but proud, seven 
teams showed their work to a wel-coming audience at the UF Per-forming Arts 24-hour film compe-tition held over the weekend. The film teams — which ranged from first timers to competition veterans — were given a packet containing the competition’s theme and were allowed 24 hours to storyboard, shoot and edit a 5-minute film. All of the films were then shown Sun-day at an event free to the public.
The theme was “The End of the 
World as We Know It,” and inter-pretations ranged from crippling self-realizations to meteors that destroyed the earth. The film had to include an iconic part of cam-pus, and teams were awarded ex-tra credit points if they could work certain items like a Crock-Pot or a choreographed dance routine into their story.
Derek Wohlust, the education 
coordinator at the center, said he started the 24-hour film competi-tion in 2010 so the center could take part in Creative B, which is a summer program with the UF College of Fine Arts that gets stu-dents involved in artistic activities on campus. Wohlust participated in Gainesville’s Film Fiasco com-petition for years before the event stopped being held and thought another 24-hour competition would be a good thing for students and the community.
The first year, 
only two teams showed up. But as the competi-tion has contin-ued, more people have stepped up 
to the plate to take on the chal-lenge, and Wohlust said the results are always entertaining.
“I’ve never seen a boring film,” 
Wohlust said.
Team #deeppanther took home 
second place for its movie “Closed for the Apocalypse,” in which two friends travel to a gas station for beer as meteors destroy the world around them. The five group members said when they heard the theme, they wrote down all of their ideas on a whiteboard and figured out how much time they would need for each step of the project. The team worked through the night editing and adding ef-fects. By Sunday, the majority of the team arrived wearing the same clothes they had shot the movie in.
Still, they said, their efforts paid 
off.
“It was awesome seeing it on 
the big screen,” said Nick Cravey, a 23-year-old UF telecommunica-tion senior. 
“We had too much fun making 
it to not be proud of it,” said John Kelley, a 22-year-old UF criminol-ogy major.
About 50 people came to the 
Phillips Center on Sunday to watch the films. Three ushers sat in the back of the room with clip-boards and pencils; Wohlust had designated them the judges for the competition.
First place was a tie between the films “Contact” by Stray Train and “Dirty Love” by Pizza Money Productions. In “Contact,” people jumped to their deaths as they heard of an asteroid headed to-ward Earth, and in “Dirty Love,” a magical jester appeared in a public restroom to try to persuade a man to be a better person to his broth-er.Wohlust initially worried about 
giving the competition an overall theme, he said, but the films had such a variety that the theme didn’t end up being a problem.
“I was afraid that by giving a 
theme, everything would be pi-geonholed,” he said. “But there wasn’t one film that felt like any of the others.”

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
ATTLEBORO, Mass. (AP) — A judge on Wednesday gave 
prosecutors more time to present evidence to a grand jury in 
their murder case against former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez.
Hernandez was in court for what was supposed to be a 
probable cause hearing, but prosecutors said the grand jury is still considering the evidence against him.
Judge Daniel O’Shea considered defense objections to a de-
lay but decided to reschedule the hearing for Aug. 22. Hernan-dez will continue to be held without bail until then.
Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to murder in the death 
of Odin Lloyd, a 27-year-old Boston semi-professional football player whose body was found June 17 in an industrial park near Hernandez’s home. He had been shot five times.
Bristol County Assistant District Attorney William McCau-
ley said additional evidence includes boxes of ammunition found at a condominium Hernandez leased and a magazine for a .45-caliber Glock in a Hummer registered to him. Authori-ties say Lloyd was killed with a .45-caliber gun, though it ap-parently has not been recovered. McCauley said the ammuni-tion box had Hernandez’s fingerprints on it.
Hernandez attorney James Sultan objected to the delay, say-
ing his client has already been jailed for four weeks and that the district attorney could have waited to bring charges, but chose to go ahead last month.
“He made it sound like a slam dunk case,” Sultan said.Outside court, another of Hernandez’s attorneys, Charles Rankin, said he was “extremely disappointed” that prosecu-tors weren’t prepared to go forward and that he’s confident Hernandez will be exonerated.
Hernandez’s girlfriend, Shayanna Jenkins, was in court for 
the hearing — Hernandez mouthed “I love you” in her direc-tion before he was led out — but she did not respond to report-ers’ questions as she left the courthouse.
Members of Lloyd’s family also attended the hearing but 
did not comment.
Also Wednesday, O’Shea ruled in favor 
of media organizations, including The As-sociated Press, that were seeking access to more documents in the case, including two arrest warrants, additional search warrants and other materials. The records will be re-leased at 3 p.m. Thursday if no one appeals.
Sultan objected to the documents’ unseal-
ing, saying he understood the media’s “insa-
tiable appetite” but that the release of records is undermining Hernandez’s right to a fair trial.
Prosecutors say Hernandez orchestrated Lloyd’s killing be-
cause he was upset at him for talking to people Hernandez had problems with at a nightclub a few days earlier.
They say Hernandez and two associates, Ernest Wallace 
and Carlos Ortiz, drove with Lloyd to the North Attleborough industrial park. Authorities have not said who fired the shots, but documents filed in Florida — and released since Hernan-dez’s last court appearance — paint the former Patriot as the triggerman. According to the records, Ortiz told police that Wallace said Hernandez fired the shots.
Hernandez was kicked off the team within hours of his ar-
rest. New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick broke his si-lence Wednesday, saying the Patriots will learn from “this ter-rible experience,” and that it’s time for New England to move forward.
“We’ll continue to evaluate the way that we do things, the 
way that we evaluate our players and we’ll do it on a regular basis,” Belichick said. “I’m not perfect on that, but I always do what I think is best for the football team.”
Wallace and Ortiz also are facing charges. Wallace pleaded 
not guilty to a charge of being an accessory to murder after the fact. Ortiz has pleaded not guilty to a gun charge.
Warrants released Tuesday in Hernandez’s hometown of 
Bristol, Conn., show police found ammunition, a gun box and documents tied to Ortiz and Wallace at Hernandez’s uncle’s home.
The warrants were used to search that home, where Ortiz 
said he lived; an apartment also linked to Ortiz; and a rental car police say was used by Wallace and Ortiz to return to Con-necticut after the shooting.
The items seized from the home included clothes, Correc-
tion Department documents linked to Ortiz and Wallace, a plastic gun box and two boxes of .38-caliber ammunition.
Bristol police also have been investigating a possible link to 
a 2012 double fatal shooting in Boston, and earlier said they had seized vvan SUV wanted in that investigation from the uncle’s home. Court records say it had been rented in Hernan-dez’s name.

Joe: When the Gators reflect on their two 
national titles in gymnastics and men’s 
outdoor track and field during the 2012-
13 season, one word will come to mind: milestone.
Rhonda Faehn led the Florida gymnas-
tics team to its first national title after a heartbreaking second-place finish at the NCAA Super Six in 2012, and Mike Hollo-way’s Gators nabbed their second straight outdoor crown and fifth team national title since 2010.
Additionally, both squads dealt with 
significant adversity with NCAA champi-onships on the line. 
The track Gators entered the final day 
of competition in 11th place, and the gym Gators stumbled on balance beam to begin the Super Six. Neither wavered.
When forced to choose between the two, 
I’m going with the dominant gymnastics team. I’m not taking anything away from Holloway’s club, but Texas A&M flopped like a Ryan Reynolds star vehicle in the 4x400 relay to help Florida earn a share of the crown.
Adam: Although Florida had two title-
winning teams this year, I’m going to have to go with something out of left field.
The Gators softball team started the sea-
son ranked 14th and was predicted to fin-ish fourth in the division. Not fourth in the Southeastern Conference, fourth in the SEC East.
Injuries, dismissals and graduation deci-mated the Florida roster before the season even began. 2013 was going to be a rebuild-ing year to allow inexperienced freshmen to get their feet under them.Instead, the Gators bowled over their 
competition.   They started the season with 
a bang — beating No. 13 Arizona, No. 5 Or-
egon and No. 3 California in the first week-end — and never stopped, finishing with a 
58-9 record.
Florida swept the SEC regular season 
and tournament titles and made the trip to Oklahoma City for the Women’s College World Series for the fifth time in program history. 
The Gators were like Jeff Bridges — they 
put in a top performance, even as others floundered around them. 
Joe: There’s no denying the phenomenal 
performance by Tim Walton’s club in 2013. A WCWS berth was a great achievement for that team and a promising precursor to an-other championship run in 2014.
However, those Gators were not weighed 
down by the burden of expectation that they will face in a few months.
The Florida gymnastics team began 2013 
under the spotlight with a No. 3 ranking in the NCAA Coaches Poll after adding 2009 World All-Around champion Bridget Sloan and 2011 Pan American All-Around champion Bridgette Caquatto to an already deep roster of elite gymnasts, including All-Americans Kytra Hunter and Ashanée Dickerson. Which Florida team was the undisputed best in 2012-13?

“Don’t know why they call it a carwash we brought our plane (number sign) confused” 
Will Muschamp  UF coach (@CoachWMuschamp)  Alabama may have been No. 1, 
but it was title or bust for Florida. 
The Gators met expectations head on and delivered, claiming the ul-timate prize.
  But I can’t blame you for warm-
ing up to the softball team’s ability to defy the odds. After all, your be-loved Yankees are trying to make a playoff run with Lyle Overbay batting cleanup.
  Adam: Trying and succeeding, 
kind of. Fourth place isn’t so bad, especially when the disabled list has a better roster.
  But while the gymnastics team 
has a stacked roster, the softball team had to make do with several players who were off the radar before the season, such as Taylor Schwarz, Briana Little and Kirsti Merritt.
  They joined well-known play-
ers like Hannah Rogers, Lauren Haeger and No. 2 national recruit Kelsey Stewart to form a jugger-naut.
  The softball team had few, if 
any, stars.
  Rogers had a great season, but 
she wasn’t unbelievably domi-nant. She ﬁ  nished 35th nationally in ERA.  Stewart was a great addi-
tion at the top of the order, but she ﬁ  nished outside the top 100 in average.
  Without one player who 
absolutely dominated the league, the Gators needed to do better than the sum of their individual parts. 
And they did, to the tune of an 
.866 winning percentage.
  It’s a story that could warm 
even your heart, which has been left cold by two Yankee triumphs over your Braves in the Fall Clas-sic. 
  Joe: Well played, Adam. I ﬁ  nd 
it cruel and unusual for you to bring back those painful memo-ries, but I’ll soldier onward.
  I’m going to conclude my argu-
ment here with some math.  The UF 
softball team compiled an .866 winning percentage. Gymnastics won at an .882 clip. Advantage: gymnastics.
  Softball had two All-Americans. 
Six gymnasts tied a Florida record with a combined 16 All-America honors. Advantage: gymnastics. 
  Both teams won SEC champi-
onships. Draw.
  Gymnastics won the national 
championship. Also, Sloan won individual NCAA titles in all-around and beam while Alaina Johnson nabbed the uneven bars crown. Advan-tage: gymnastics.
  I admire your effort to 
argue on the softball team’s behalf. Those Gators had a great season and deserve recognition.
  But saying there was a Florida 
team better than Faehn’s national championship squad during the 2012-13 season is as hopeless as: A.) A-Rod actually ﬁ  nishing out his contract with the Yankees, B.) Zack Snyder making a good “Justice League” movie, C.) Wil-liam and Kate naming their baby “North,” D.) All of the above.
  Take it away, Maino!
  Adam: Gymnastics had 14 
meets and lost twice. Softball played more than 60 games and 
lost nine times. 
If Florida gymnastics replicat-
ed those results for 60 meets, they lose eight. I think that’s pretty even. 
Also, gymnasts can earn mul-
tiple All-American awards in dif-ferent events. Rogers isn’t about to win any accolades with the bat. Gymnastics was supposed to win and did. Softball was supposed to 
lose and didn’t. 
  But both teams were really 
good, unlike B.J. “The Lesser” 
Upton. But at least I don’t have to watch A-Rod play. Upton is in the lineup every night.

  THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
  
  TAMPA (AP) — Darrelle Revis is ex-
pected on the practice ﬁ  eld when the Tam-
pa Bay Buccaneers open training camp.
  The three-time All-Pro cornerback 
who’s the centerpiece of an effort to over-haul the NFL’s worst pass defense has been cleared medically to participate in some activities after missing most of last season with the New York Jets following surgery to repair a torn knee ligament.
  The Bucs obtained Revis from the Jets 
in exchange for the 13th overall pick in this year’s draft, then signed him to a six-year, $96 million contract.  Tampa Bay reported for camp Wednes-
day. The ﬁ  rst practice is Thursday, when Revis will be limited.
  “He’ll be out there tomorrow,” coach 
Greg Schiano said. 
“With all the injured guys, we have in-
dividual plans for them. Darrelle is going to do some stuff, but he isn’t going to do everything.”
  Tampa Bay was last in pass defense a 
year ago, coming within 38 yards of allow-ing the most yards passing in league his-tory.
  “He’s in good shape. We’re going to 
play him back into football shape. Cut-ting, moving with other guys — not just by himself,” Schiano said. “He’s a profes-sional. He knows what he needs to do to get ready, and we’re going to help him.”
  The Bucs haven’t determined how much 
Revis will play during the preseason. The goal is have him ready for the Sept. 8 regu-lar season opener against his old team.
