◗ TECH START-UPS WILL MEET SATURDAY.

The ﬁ  rst rule of BarCamp is that there are no 
rules. 
Or, perhaps, that there aren’t many — and that’s 
just the point. 
This Saturday, Gainesville will host its ﬁ  rst-ever 
“unconference” known as BarCamp, an informal get-
together of the city’s tech community.
The international conference has been bringing 
tech startups together for nearly a decade in cities across the globe. Now, it’s making its debut here thanks to an initiative from Grooveshark.
Unlike conventional conferences, BarCamp is 
free and loosely structured in order to allow guests to speak about their passions in any way they see ﬁ  t, 
said Grooveshark director of quality assurance Julia 
Anderson.
“I’ve been to BarCamps before where some guy 
talked just about bacon and served samples of ba-con,” Anderson said with a laugh. 
There won’t be bacon at Gainesville’s event — or 
there might be, who knows? — but it does promise talks on yoga in the workplace, self defense, using Amazon as a resource and women in technology. 
Sara Schuster, president of UF’s women in com-
puter science engineering club, will be hosting a talk with fellow vice president Killian McCoy on women in the male-dominated ﬁ  eld. 
Schuster said her speech will help “people realize 
that when you walk into an engineering class, what it feels like to be the only woman in the room,” as well as give suggestions on how to improve the state of women in the engineering ﬁ  eld. She said she is ex-
cited to hear from people outside the tech world too.
Guests will be able to circulate between four rooms 
from 10:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Depot Building – 201 BarCamp to host 
unique tech “un-confererence”

Donating blood this weekend could help 
save both people and pets.
Anyone who donates blood at Alachua 
County Animal Services on Saturday can ei-
ther adopt a shelter animal for free or spon-sor an adoption for someone else as part of its Heart 2 Heart Partnership Program with LifeSouth Community Blood Centers.
The blood drive will take place at the 3400 
NE 53rd Ave. shelter. Adoption coordinator Dory Rosati, 26, said she hopes the 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. event draws extra attention to the animals.
“It’s a nice way to help if you’re a college 
student,” she said, “so if you can’t adopt right now, it’s a great way to help someone else adopt.”
UF biology sophomore Tori Hall said she 
fostered ﬁ  ve puppies after volunteering at the Alachua County Humane Society.
“Really there’s no risk to you,” the 19-year-
old said. “All you have to do is take care of them, which is honestly the best part.”
The blood drive is the shelter’s ﬁ  rst time 
putting heartworm-positive dogs who have 
undergone treatment up for adoption. The 
No. 1 reason why dogs are euthanized is because they are heartworm positive, Rosati said.
“We’re hoping to raise funds and money 
needed to continue this program,” she said, “but we really want the whole community involved.”Donate blood and get a free pet Saturday at Animal ServicesARIANA FIGUEROA

Fuchs presented his goals for the 
university to the Board, including hir-ing preeminent faculty, expanding UF Online, developing curriculum for ﬁ  rst-year students and promoting graduate studies.
“There’s a real need 
for universities across 
the nation to be more successful in higher education,” Fuchs 
said. 
The Board also ap-
proved the appoint-

The local Jewish community is 
hosting its annual Mitzvah Day on 
Sunday.
The event starts at 9 a.m. at the 
Lubavitch Chabad Jewish Center, 
2021 NW 5th Ave. 
After an hourlong morning intro-
duction, the event will continue with 
diverse projects hosted at different Jewish centers around Gainesville.
For the ﬁ  rst time, the Jewish Council of North Central Florida is partnering with UF Hillel, Lubavitch Chabad Jewish Center and local temples for the national event to help Gainesville with more than a dozen different service projects.
“It’s an easy way for people to 
give back,” said Damien Boada, the community engagement associate for the Jewish Council of North Cen-tral Florida.
UF Hillel started its own Mitzvah 
Day six years ago, and Boada said the council followed suit the next year.
Boada said he hopes people will 
be inspired to go past just the one-day event and make the idea a daily habit.
Alexa Jacobson, a community 
service intern at UF Hillel, said she’s excited for this year’s Mitzvah Day because she has coordinated ﬁ  ve 
service projects for it since June.
Some of the service projects of-
fered at the event include baking 
cookies for children and families at the Ronald McDonald house, play-ing with animals from Alachua County Animal Services and play-ing outdoor activities with children in a ﬁ  eld day at the YMCA at 5201 NW 34th Blvd.   
About 500 people are expected 
to attend, Jacobson said, and volun-teers have the opportunity to choose what impact they will have.
Sloane Bochman, a 19-year-old 
UF ﬁ  nance freshman, is running a community service project for the ﬁ  rst time Sunday. She will be lead-
ing volunteers in creating care pack-
ages ﬁ  lled with T-shirts, food and water bottles for Israeli soldiers. She said she wants people to realize that the event is not so much religious as it is just meant to help others.
“You get your good feelings in 
for the semester,” she said.
Mitzvah Day is sponsored by 
the Jewish Council of North Central Florida Inc., UF Hillel, Lubavitch Chabad Jewish Center, Publix, Trader Joe’s, Panera Bread, Student Government, Jewish Student Union and local synagogues, according to a press release.
Volunteers who pre-register on-
line can get a complimentary break-
fast and T-shirt. Volunteers can use 
the hashtag #UFGivesBack during their service.

◗ HE IS A HOLOCAUST STUDIES PROFESSOR.
CHLOE STRADINGER
Alligator Contributing Writer
A UF professor helped declassify documents revealing 
that the U.S. employed more than 1,000 Nazi spies during 
the Cold War.
Norman J.W. Goda, professor of Holocaust studies, 
was part of an interagency group that looked at over 8 mil-
lion documents under the 1998 Nazi War Crimes Disclo-
sure Act.
With the release of a new book about the documents, 
the professor is in the national spotlight once again. In Oc-tober, the New York Times published an article adapted from “The Nazis Next Door: How America Became a Safe Haven for Hitler’s Men,” by Eric Lichtblau. The article quoted Goda on his knowledge of Nazis and U.S. intel-ligence.
The disclosure act required all government agencies to 
declassify documents relating to Nazi war crimes and the fate of war criminals after the war. It also put together the interagency group to look through the documents.
Goda worked on the declassiﬁ  cation team from 1998 to 
2010. He spent one year at the National Archives in Wash-ington, D.C., looking over the documents. Before coming to UF in 2009, he worked at Ohio University.
“As a historian, it’s a thrill to see new records that 
no one ever thought would be declassiﬁ  ed,” Goda said. “There are all kinds of secrets in there.”
The records provided new information on the Holo-
caust, what U.S. intelligence agencies knew and what Ger-man soldiers said conﬁ  dentially, he said.
The agencies processed records and sent them to the 
National Archives, where Goda and his team looked through them to ﬁ  nd gaps such as redacted information.
“The process as a whole was a big success,” he said.
Goda and the rest of the team who helped declassify 
the records wrote a book with the information they found 
called “U.S. Intelligence and the Nazis,” published in 2004. Goda later published another book, “Hitler’s Shadow: Nazi War Criminals, U.S. Intelligence and the Cold War,” in 2010.
American University professor Richard Breitman 
worked on the declassiﬁ  cation team with Goda. Breitman co-authored both books and said “a good number” of peo-
ple and historians now use the books as sources.
“That served as a way for other scholars to get into the 
records because there was so much in material,” he said.
Goda said the post-war trends they found in the docu-
ments were in line with what they expected, but they also 
found new, surprising information. For example, he said, after the war, the U.S. Army hired a man for counterintel-ligence who was second in command in the operation that gassed most of Poland’s Jewish population.
Jack Kugelmass, UF professor and director of the Cen-
ter for Jewish Studies, said Goda’s work is inﬂ  uential.
“Some of his work now has national and international 
consequences,” he said.UF professor’s quoted in new book for

Panelists discussed racial profiling 
at a forum held Thursday in the Reitz 
Union to discuss the misconduct of law 
enforcement officers within communities 
across the nation.
The forum, hosted by student orga-
nizations like the Institute of Black Cul-
ture and the Dream Defenders, discussed 
the death of Michael Brown and concern over a similar event happening in the lo-cal community. 
Panelists who attended the forum 
included Gainesville Police Chief Tony Jones, University Police Chief Darren Baxley and Santa Fe College Police Dep-uty Chief Ed Book. 
One of the first questions asked to the 
panelists was, “Is racial profiling an is-sue when it comes to the actions of an officer?”Panelists focused on the importance 
of transparency when dealing with any individual. 
Baxley said that individuals who come 
in contact with law enforcement should 
be polite and cooperative. 
“By policy, we avoid any racial stereo-
types or profiling,” Baxley said, “and if 
there is an issue with that, we take action to either fix that problem or remove the 
individual from our department.”
At one point in the night, GPD Lt. 
Will Halvosa asked the audience if they 
felt they had ever been unfairly profiled 
when being pulled over. 
Almost half of the room of about 150 
attendees raised their hands. 
Book said it’s important for police de-
partments to have a diverse staff to rep-resent a diverse population. 
“There are no sides in community po-
licing. There is only one side and that’s 
the community,” Book said. “(Our de-
partment) knows how to provide fair law 
enforcement services because we enforce it 24/7, 365.” 4, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 2014

A lobby of high ceilings, low-
hanging lanterns and floor-length 
curtains greeted voters at the Hil-ton Garden Inn Precinct-39 polling location Tuesday.
At first glance, fulfilling one’s 
civic duty seemed glamorous.
But past the guest couches and 
complimentary coffee, reality set in in the shape of a small sheet of paper taped crookedly to a metal pole, directing voters away from the check-in desk, around the cor-ner and to a back ballroom to cast 
their ballots.
Three volunteers waited to sign 
in voters. Another waited by the 
exit sign to pass out stickers. But traffic was unusually slow.
Tuesday’s election saw a nearly 
50 percent voting turnout, and though Alachua County Supervi-sor of Elections Pam Carpenter 
predicted voting lines wouldn’t be long with 18,000 early ballots cast, 
she said college students sometimes forget or wait to update their regis-tration, which can cause delays.
“We have a pretty mobile com-
munity here,” she said, attribut-
ing the frequent moves in Alachua 
County to its transient population. And with only one clerk at each polling station to approve changes-of-address, the time it takes to vote can quickly add up.
At Precinct-39, a line of students 
and young adults swelled behind the single clerk’s table to update 
their voter’s registration with new 
addresses.
First it was seven. The addi-
tion of 31-year-old Andrew Evans, 23-year-old Victoria Earnest and their 12-week-old daughter, Lillian, brought the line to nine. And in the next 30 minutes it jumped to 20.
“I just didn’t think it was nec-
essary to change your address,” Earnest said to Evans. “I’ve moved every year since I moved out of my 
parent’s house. And we’re about to 
do it again, too.”
Evans nodded while entertain-
ing little Lillian.
“They should have three people 
doing the change of addresses and one doing the check-in,” he said with a laugh while touching the infant’s tummy. “Daddy’s gonna 
starve to death in this line.”
As the line to update informa-
tion grew, the hotel’s chief engineer 
Greg Talley grabbed extra chairs. UF industrial engineering junior Paige Lesher sat in one. The 20-year-old said she too was waiting to update her address.
“I would’ve thought my parents 
would’ve given me a heads up,” she said. “This is kind of important.”
A group of three Santa Fe Col-
lege students sitting next to her in the makeshift line started laughing. Psychology freshman Mac Schel-strate donned a Bob Marley shirt.
The 19-year-old said he was in 
favor of Florida gubernatorial can-
didate Charlie Crist and Amend-
ment 2 — “legalizing. . . some-thing,” he said before trailing off.
Schelstrate said he drove both 
18-year-old freshman Brandon Taylor and 19-year-old psychol-ogy sophomore Jacob Nolen to the polls. The three moved in together in the Fall and were also waiting to 
update their addresses.  
“We always encourage everyone 
to keep their voting information current,” Carpenter said. “All they 
have to do is contact our office.”
Outside of the hotel, poll deputy 
Amos Reid greeted voters. He said he and his wife, married 54 years, have volunteered on election day for the last 10.
He noticed a flux.“A lot of students just walking 
in,” he said. “Lots of them, which is nice.”
In the ballroom, the three wom-
en manning the main desk were pa-tient. They had ballots, but no one to 
hand them to. And the registration 
line continued to grow. Soon more people were using voting booths to fill out their change-of-address forms than to fill out their ballots.
“This is really sad,” one volun-
teer said to assistant clerk Kathy Bolton.
“They don’t realize,” Bolton 
said in reply. She said it’s typical to have a few people procrastinate in updating their info, but 20 at once was odd.
“We’ve never had this many 
people,” she said. “I think it’s be-cause of what’s on the ballot,” she continued, hinting at Amendment 2, a medical marijuana initiative 
that saw a 66.1-percent approval in 
Alachua, though it ultimately failed to reach 60 percent of the vote need-ed to pass statewide.
Carpenter said the number of 
students who voted wouldn’t be available for another two weeks but reiterated Bolton’s comment.
“We’re very aware that the can-
didates and the issues drive people to the polls,” Carpenter said.

Registration to be a speaker opens at 9:30 a.m. and food trucks will be available for lunch starting at 1 p.m. 
Anderson said Grooveshark has been 
planning the event with local organiza-tion StudioCo.de for about a month.
“One of the things I think makes Bar-
Camp click is this is the perfect environ-ment for Gainesville,” Anderson said. “Gainesville is the grassroots kind of town.”Holly Marie Gibbs, one of the found-
ers of StudioCo.de, said she has battled with the issue of networking herself while working at tech company Mobiq-uity Inc.
“This is a really good chance to start 
that conversation,” Gibbs said. 
About 100 to 150 people are expected 
to attend and share a diverse set of ideas throughout the event, she said. 
“I really hope people feel like they 
are a part of a bigger community,” Gibbs said. “And we are getting together to do something that really matters.”High turnout of last-minute voters results in delays at polls
bArc Amp , from page 1About 100 to 150 people 
are expected to participateA Ph.D. program was terminated
The Board unanimously agreed for the ter-
mination of the Ph.D. program.
Glover additionally presented to the board 
reasons for limited access on the dietetics and 
nutritional science programs.
In order for students to gain a license as a 
registered dietitian in Florida, he or she must complete both the undergraduate dietetics cur-riculum and an internship under the supervi-sion of a dietetic, he said.
Only 87 internship slots are available in the 
state of Florida for students in the dietetics pro-gram.
The dietetics program seeks to limit access 
to students who earn below a 3.0 grade point average in core classes, while the nutritional program would require students to have a GPA above a 2.5.
Chairman Norman Tripp said the university needs a higher quality of students to be success-ful in both programs.
The Board agreed to limit access for the two 
programs.
Market rate for tuition costs for five UF grad-
uate programs were unanimously approved 
at the board meeting Wednesday as well. The 
programs included Master of Science in Mi-crobiology and Cell Science, Master of Arts in Medicine and Master of Science in Pharmacy Clinical Toxicology. 
For all five programs, UF will match the ex-
pected tuition cost to the market price, which can be lower or higher than the in-state tuition cost for out-of-state students.

◗ THINGS STOLEN INCLUDE CASH AND A 
BAR OF SOAP.

A Gainesville man was arrested Wednesday af-
ternoon after police said he broke into an occupied 
home and made out with $60 in cash and a bar of soap. 
Using an unlocked door, 46-year-old Charles Al-
len Green broke into Keith Scott Pariseau’s home. Pariseau was in his living room at the time and told police he could hear Green come in at about 12:40 p.m., according to a report. 
Pariseau confronted Green in the kitchen and told him to leave. Green refused and walked toward 
Pariseau — causing Pariseau to back into a corner. 
He told police he was afraid of Green’s size and thought Green might hurt him if he intervened. 
Green walked into Pariseau’s bathroom and 
used Pariseau’s soap to wash his face. He then snatched the soap, walked back to the living room, grabbed $60 in cash that was lying on the coffee 
table and left the house on foot — leaving behind 
a black jacket. 
Police found Green a couple blocks away from 
Pariseau’s home. As Green was being searched, po-lice found Pariseau’s bar of soap on his person. 
Green was arrested on a felony charge of un-
armed home invasion. His bond is currently set at $50,000. Home invasion suspect arrested

About 40 percent of campus facilities do 
not have feminine disposal bins inside the 
bathroom stalls, limiting women to leave the stall with their hygiene products and dispose of them publicly.
According to the UF Physical Plant Di-
vision, some of the women’s bathrooms in Hough Hall, Florida Gym and Little Hall do not have built-in disposal bins inside the stalls.They just have trash cans outside the stalls.
 “They should be everywhere on cam-
pus,” said Latisha Warren, a member of the custodial staff for Broward Hall, said of the feminine disposal bins.
Warren, 34, said that not having the 
sanitary boxes in the restrooms can be em-barrassing for women and is unsanitary. 
On a note inside a Hough Hall women’s 
bathroom stall, a student scribbled “please provide us with trash receptacles in the stalls.”   Dorie Josma, 19, said she avoids going 
into certain bathrooms because of the lack 
of feminine disposal bins. The food science 
and human nutrition sophomore said the 
lack of bins may date back to the history of the school.
“Since UF used to be an all-male school, 
that might have something to do with it,” Josma said.
About 60 percent of the facilities on 
campus do have feminine disposal bins, said Derrick M. Bacon, director of the 
Physical Plant Division.
The Physical Plant does not determine 
whether facilities should provide bins — it is up to the designers of the buildings, Bacon said.
Building codes do not require UF to of-
fer bins.
“It’s not something that the physical 
plant has made an active effort to change,” 
Bacon said.
Although the topic has been brought up 
to the Physical Plant Division from time to time, Bacon said that for change to occur, there needs to be more emphasis on de-mand for it.
But Bacon said if his daughters were in 
the same situation as female students at UF, they should “talk to their administra-tors and see if a change can be made.” Less than half of women’s bathroom stalls have dispensers

school, that might have something

Darts & Laurels 
Comedian and “The Daily Show” host Jon Stewart is 
known for his biting sarcasm and his critiques of elected ofﬁ  cials on both sides of the political spectrum. Unfor-
tunately, Stewart made a rare comedic misstep during an ap-pearance on CNN when he said he did not plan to vote in the midterm elections because he “just moved.” “I don’t even know where my thing is now,” he said. Stewart later apologized for his ﬂ  ippant and strange remarks. It’s clear from his apology that Stewart did not intend for his remarks to be taken seriously. However, believe it or not, Jon Stewart and his Comedy Central counterpart Stephen Colbert are two of the most trusted names in American media. When Stewart talks about not voting, many people — particularly American youth — might very well take him seriously. A rare-miss DART to Jon Stewart.
Stewart could probably learn a lesson from 97-year-old Min-
nesota resident Chenyi Pan. She immigrated to the U.S. in 2009 and obtained her citizenship a few months ago. The Hufﬁ  ngton Post recently proﬁ  led Pan’s preparations to vote in the midterm elections. In an interview, Pan said that she feels “honored to be a citizen and to be able to vote in the American election.” In a time when voter turnout is reaching all-time lows, it’s refresh-ing to see someone so enthusiastic about exercising her right to cast a ballot. A setting-an-example LAUREL to Chenyi Pan.
Conservative ﬁ  lmmaker and agitator James O’Keefe rose to 
prominence as a result of a video he created purporting to show voter fraud by ACORN, a now-defunct community organizing group. Despite the fact that the video was quickly revealed to be heavily edited and misleading, Congress actually voted to defund ACORN, which quickly led to the organization’s de-mise. In 2010, O’Keefe was arrested after attempting to wiretap the ofﬁ  ce of Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) Now O’Keefe is back with another video that supposedly reveals new examples of voter fraud. In reality, the video is just O’Keefe trying — and failing — to obtain a ballot registered to an “inactive voter.” Sorry, James — no matter how many fake videos you make, voter fraud in America still doesn’t really exist. A please-give-
up-already DART to James O’Keefe. 
On Tuesday, Florida voters rejected Amendment 2, which 
would have legalized marijuana for medical uses. Other votes on similar measures around the country demonstrate how far behind Florida is on this issue. Alaska, Oregon and the District of Columbia all voted to legalize marijuana for recreational use, not just in cases of medical necessity. Meanwhile, voters in Guam approved a measure similar to the one in Florida, mak-ing it the ﬁ  rst U.S. territory to legalize medical marijuana. Hope-fully, the Sunshine State will catch up to the rest of the country soon — but with Republican domination of the state govern-ment, don’t count on it. We’re giving a show-us-the-way-to-
legal-pot LAUREL to voters everywhere but in Florida.

Tuesday, for those living under a rock, was the day of 
the 2014 midterm elections — where Democrats lost control of the U.S. Senate. They were also defeated 
in a number of key governor’s races, including in the state of Florida. The Democrats took a thumping, a shellack-ing and a whipping, with a net loss of 13 House seats and seven Senate seats.
This huge wave of red left many Democrats angry, 
discouraged and pessimistic, which was evident through lengthy Facebook statuses and angry rants about why mil-lennials didn’t get off their bottoms to vote and the im-pending doom of Republican governance.
What many Democrats failed to realize is that while 
Democrats were losing seats, their initiatives passed by large margins.
Red states like Arkansas, Nebraska, Alaska and South 
Dakota have passed ballot initiatives to increase their min-imum wage over the federal level of $7.25.
This indicates that such measures, which have been 
gaining popularity since 2002, will become more and more popular even if Republican legislatures try to block them.
The state of Washington approved a strict gun con-
trol measure after a shooting took place at a Marysville-Pilchuck High School.
This measure, which requires background checks on all 
gun sales, could create a domino effect leading to other states using ballot initiatives to act on the public’s approv-al of gun restrictions.
The states of Colorado and North Dakota both rejected 
personhood amendments that would establish the notion that life begins at conception and expand human rights to unborn fetuses. 
It could be argued that these amendments would be 
unconstitutional because they would, by default, make abortion illegal. Regardless, voters across the country have rejected all ﬁ  ve personhood amendments since 2008.
Another area where the Democrats won out is mari-juana legalization. The District of Columbia, Oregon and even Alaska all legalized it by wide margins.
While the state of Florida re-
jected the medical marijuana measure, a majority of voters cast their ballots in favor of it.
Although these places do not 
yet have regulatory plans to put in place within the mari-juana industry, legalization advocates are over the moon.
The state of California approved a measure that would 
turn “non-serious, nonviolent crimes and drug crimes” from a felony to a misdemeanor, which will subsequently affect the sentences of one in ﬁ  ve prisoners, thus further cutting the prison population. 
It is important to mention that the Democratic Party 
has not formally endorsed marijuana legalization or ad-vocated for widespread prison reform. Democrats are just more likely to adopt such measures than Republicans are.
Americans are starting to favor progressive positions 
on important issues such as marriage equality, combating climate change, minimum wage increases and the legality of abortion. 
However, these attitudes did not translate in the results 
of Tuesday’s midterm elections. It is safe to say that the ballot initiative itself could grow in popularity all over the country if voters feel as though their legislators and Con-gress are not meeting their needs. It is a sad state of affairs when we see that ballot initiatives could be the only way to effect change.
Governance seems to be grinding to a halt in this coun-
try, and it is up to the voters to mobilize and vote on issues instead of politicians, because they don’t seem to be deliv-ering the way their constituents want them to.

Raise your hand if you’ve been per-
sonally victimized by Regina George. No? OK then, ladies, raise your hand 
if you’ve ever been personally victimized by any other girl.
Chances are, a lot of you probably mental-
ly raised your hands. Girl hate — you know, 
that feeling that you get when you inexplica-
bly hate another girl “just because” — is ex-tremely common.
It’s common enough that I got my most recent taste of 
it last week when I danced with someone’s ex-boyfriend. 
She ﬁ  rst talked to him about it, and then she turned to 
me.
Here’s what she said, except with a not-so-nice word 
replaced here with “kitten”: “You need to back the kitten 
off!” In that moment, I thought I was about to be slapped.
Good news: She didn’t slap me. I went on to explain 
how I didn’t want to do anything wrong and how I was 
all for girls supporting girls. At the end of the night, she apologized and told me the same.
But her ﬁ  rst outburst isn’t really anything out of the 
ordinary. The phenomenon of girl hate is ingrained into how we are raised and taught to treat other humans.
It’s probably been happening since cave-lady Susie 
called cave-lady Angelina a slut for wearing too short of an animal pelt.
But despite how often this happens, I’ll never under-
stand why. Ladies, why can’t you just support your fellow ladies instead of putting them down?
There’s a foundation for why girl hate occurs, but 
you’re not going to like the answer. Our society is found-ed on patriarchal beliefs that basically teach women that being a woman is the worst thing possible.
Girls are trained to put down other girls in order to 
elevate their own status and gain more attention.
There are outside factors that contribute to this too. 
Oftentimes, comments from men pit women against each other.
If you tell me, “You’re so cool, not at all like other 
girls,” you’re entering me into a competition against other women against my will. You’re totally right — I am really cool! But so are other girls, too.
There are a lot of commonly used phrases that subtly 
put down fellow ladies. If you say things like, “I’m not like other girls, I like books and video games, not shop-ping and makeup,” then you’re part of the problem.
Comments like that stereotype women and insinuate that you’re better than them. They often also value stereotypically “manly” activities more than feminine activities — which is basically 
saying that boys rule and girls drool.
I get it, the stereotypes against women 
suck. We’re supposedly superﬁ  cial, stuck-up 
and catty. When you say that you’re not like 
“other women,” it means you agree with the 
stereotypes and don’t want to align yourself with your fellow ladies.
Saying, “I only hang out with boys because girls suck 
and have too much drama,” is problematic, too. Girls are 
really cool and fun and awesome.
Have you hung out with boys? Not as cool and fun and 
awesome. And have you seen boys ﬁ  ght? They’re just as 
likely to have drama as girls are.
Even just small comments that you might make can be 
girl hate. This especially happens with girls you barely know  — “Do you see her talking to that guy? What a slut!” — as a form of reassuring yourself that you’re better than she is.
An article from Rookie explained it nicely with, “Girl 
hate is not hating someone who happens to be a girl, it’s hating someone because we’re told that, as girls, we should hate other girls who are as awesome as or more 
awesome than ourselves.”
If you’re reading this and panicking, thinking, “OMG, I 
never realized I was such a jerk!” then don’t worry. You’re 
not a jerk: You’ve just internalized a huge problem that society has as a whole.
Unfortunately, there’s not an overnight ﬁ  x. You’ll prob-
ably slip up. After all, you’re trying to get rid of learned behaviors that you’ve had for two decades.
There are a few things that you can do to make this 
world a better place for ladies, though. Stop looking for their ﬂ  aws. Stop calling girls nasty names. Smile at people. Give them compliments. In general: Just be a nice person.
If you can’t take my word for it, take the only good 
thing to come out of girl hate: “Mean Girls.” Ms. Norbury 
gave great advice when she said, “You all have got to stop 
calling each other sluts and whores. It just makes it OK for guys to call you sluts and whores.”
Girls have a rough time already, and putting your lady 
friends down just makes men think it’s OK for them to do it too.

opinions@alligator.orgIf you pay attention to federal politics for long enough, 
you might ﬁ  nd that what happens on the surface of things is far from mere chance. While the results of the 
2014 midterm elections might be puzzling, there was an architect who designed a plan to create this precise re-
sult.
That man is former Senate 
Minority Leader, and future Ma-
jority Leader, Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.
In 2008, President Barack 
Obama won a dynamic victory, carrying huge majori-ties among women, Hispanics and African-Americans. His victory inspired many Democrats who believed their 
newly elected champion would go on to establish a legacy 
that would be a gold standard for generations to come.
Six years later, it is hard to imagine such a narrative as 
Obama’s legacy, in large part because Republicans have fought tooth and nail to prevent it.
This claim is not partisan bluster. At a Republican re-
treat at the Library of Congress following Obama’s 2009 inaugural address, McConnell reportedly claimed, “There are enough of us to block the Democratic agenda as long 
as we walk in lockstep. As long as Republicans refuse to 
follow (Obama’s) lead, Americans will see partisan food ﬁ  ghts and conclude Obama failed to produce change.”
That statement, which makes the innocuous-looking 
McConnell sound more like a child throwing a tantrum, has been followed with a full commitment to that strat-egy. In the 2010 midterms, Republicans capitalized on reduced turnout from Democrats and took control of the House of Representatives. From that point on, gridlock 
was the goal.
House Republicans refused to pass the president’s 
nominees for judicial and executive branch positions and 
blocked legislation at each and every turn. By 2013, 81 ﬁ  li-buster motions were ﬁ  led against Obama’s nominees and 307 against legislation. In comparison, Democrats ﬁ  led 38 ﬁ  libusters on nominees and 130 on legislation against President George W. Bush during his entire presidency from 2000 to 2008. But it is the little things that cut into 
the Democratic agenda the most. By ﬁ  libustering so much 
legislature, controversial or otherwise, government near-ly stopped completely. All this culminated in the asinine decision in 2013 by House Republicans to reject a previ-ously agreed-upon budget proposal, which resulted in the government shutdown.
Frustrated by continual ﬁ  libuster, the Democratic Sen-
ate led by former Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. took what amounted to political retribution for the lack 
of statesmanship shown in the above political maneuver. 
Reid would go on to block nearly all of the legislation that passed the House, even when in opposition to Obama’s wishes. The president, desperate to leave a legacy deﬁ  ned by more than gridlock, has taken many steps to expand the power of the executive, for better or worse, using exec-utive orders like the Environmental Protection Agency’s new carbon emission standard.
Both Reid and Obama have given the GOP all the 
ammunition they needed this election cycle. They cam-paigned using the slogan “Fire Harry Reid,” painting him and his party as the cause of Washington gridlock. Media have eagerly snapped up the narrative of this election on a “Referendum on Obama’s policies” despite the fact that incumbents had a record of their own for voters to judge.
And now McConnell’s plan has ﬁ  nally come to frui-
tion. Vox called McConnell “arguably the sharpest mind in contemporary politics,” and his successful plan vali-
dates that claim. Now, the Republicans have regained the 
Senate, and the House is setting its sights on the presi-dency in 2016.
Perhaps when it comes to politics, the ends justify 
the means. For all those new Republicans in power, they won’t be complaining. But it seems to me that choosing to break the system until you get your way is a far cry from the kind of governing America deserves.

A Catholic school teacher was 
told to take a 21-day leave of ab-
sence when she returned from 
a mission trip to Kenya, even 
though the country is thousands of miles from the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak.
The school, St. Margaret Mary 
in Louisville, told religion teach-er Susan Sherman to take man-datory leave when she returned Oct. 26 because several parents 
were worried about the Ebola outbreak, said Sherman’s hus-
band, Paul, who had also been to Kenya.
On Thursday, Louisville Arch-
bishop Joseph Kurtz acknowl-
edged that was “not the right 
judgment.”
Kurtz said the parish and the 
school made the decision “in the 
midst of an awful lot of confusion 
at the time.”
Sherman resigned last week.The school said in a letter 
to parents that it apologized to 
Sherman, but “in light of the poor communication and all that had 
been transpired, she felt unwel-come and did not see how she could effectively continue as a teacher.”

ter, builds churches and distrib-
utes Bibles.

Caleb Lewis smiled big 
while talking about his ex-
perience with Wish Upon A 
Star — a campaign aiming to 
collect gifts for 1,000 neglect-ed children in North Central Florida.
Starting this week, stu-
dents, faculty and all of the Gainesville community can buy gifts for children living in shelter homes and bring 
them to Santa Fe College. The 
campaign will reach across 13 Florida counties.
Donors are encouraged to 
purchase each child two gifts 
that total about $50. Some 
children have received pres-ents totaling more than the average price, such as a bike 
or horseback riding lessons, 
said campaign spokeswoman Jen Petion.
Donors have until Dec. 1 
to purchase gifts and drop them off at Santa Fe’s Office of Civic Engagement and Ser-vice.
Lewis, a Santa Fe multi-
media sophomore, described last year’s Wish Upon A Star as a good experience and said he will be participating again 
this year.
The 20-year-old said the child he donated a gift to last 
year was about 5 years old.
“It was really fun shop-
ping for him because he re-
ally wanted a truck,” Lewis 
said, “and I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, I can actually do that.’”
Kimberly Buchholz, an Of-
fice of Civic Engagement and 
Service spokeswoman, said 
the office collected gifts for 73 children last year and this year hopes to receive gifts for 
more.
At the end of the month, 
she said the gifts are gathered 
and distributed at a neighbor-hood Catholic church.
Despite the season of giv-
ing, Santa Fe sports manage-ment sophomore Jeremy Bell said he thinks some people donate gifts to children sim-
ply because they feel obligat-
ed to do so.
“If they ain’t doing it with 
a sincere heart, then it really 
don’t mean nothing,” Bell, 21, 
said.
But Miranda Nichols, a 
dual-enrollment student at Santa Fe and a member of the 
Service Corps — the group 
helping with the campaign — said gifts can mean a lot to children on Christmas Day.
“I just know what it feels 
like not to have your parents around on Christmas,” Nich-ols, 16, said. “So just to have 
gifts that mean something to 
you, that can help  you have a good Christmas day.”Santa Fe collects

UF has no plans to pull its study abroad 
programs as national concern in the legisla-
ture for students abroad gains momentum.
A bill introduced to the House of Repre-
sentatives in September will require colleges 
and universities to provide reports on harm that occurs during students’ stays abroad.
The bill comes on the heels of a Connecti-
cut student who filed a $41 million lawsuit af-
ter she became seriously ill from a tick bite on a school-sponsored trip to China in 2007.
Some colleges see this as a reason to end 
programs in locations deemed too risky.
Andrea R. Kim, a study abroad adviser at 
UF’s International Center, said UF completes risk assessment of the programs it provides to students before recruiting participants.
The safety of students studying abroad is 
of vital importance to UF, she said. “This is why UFIC exists,” Kim said.The university complies with all travel 
alerts and warnings to make sure students are well aware of any safety concerns, Kim said.There are pre-departure sessions that all 
study abroad participants must attend before going overseas.
“Colleges are now hiring full-time risk 
management staff,” Kim said.
UF students going abroad must also ob-
tain health insurance before they are allowed to travel. Raychel Kinner, a UF industrial and 
systems engineering senior, said UF provides 
important information about study abroad.
“You don’t realize how different the rest 
of the world lives until you spend a long time living like a native,” Kinner, 22, said. Safety legislation threatens study abroad trips, but not at UF SAntA FE

A Gainesville native who served 
in Korea as a civilian U.S. military 
adviser for 18 years spoke at Santa Fe College on Thursday, incorporat-ing his life experiences to explain 
leadership traits for a conference the 
college hosted.
Before Robert Mounts made the transition to civilian service in 1996, he served in the U.S. Air Force for more than 25 years as a special agent, before retiring in 1994. During his service he negotiated the costs of sta-tioning U.S. forces in South Korea.
To a group of Santa Fe students 
and faculty, Mounts said he believed the core principles of a good leader 
include “a belief in the system, a 
belief in the process, a belief in the higher goals of our country.”“Adolf Hitler was a good leader, 
but his core principles were pretty bad,” he said, laughing. “A leader is 
supposed to set out the vision for the 
government or for the people and then to monitor to see how we’re making progress for the goals that he sets out.”
Victoria Swander, a Santa Fe 
anthropology sophomore who at-tended the conference, said Mounts seemed principled.
“He stressed being able to iden-
tify your personal morals and val-ues,” the 23-year-old said.
Noah Jones, a Santa Fe cogni-
tive neuroscience sophomore, also attended the conference and said Mounts’ speech was captivating.
“I would characterize Mounts as 
grandfatherly, soft-spoken and well-practiced in storytelling,” Jones, 21, said.
Mounts closed his speech by 
explaining the importance of an in-formed youth.
“Educated young people,” he 
said, following a moment of silence. “It’s one of the best things.”

◗ IT AFFECTS FIVE STATES.
THE ASSOCIATE PRESS
Breaking ranks with rulings 
from other federal courts, the 
6th Circuit in Ohio upholds gay marriage bans in four states, saying the courts aren’t the 
right place to legalize gay mar-
riage. 
The 6th Circuit ruling says 
limiting unions to being only between a man and a woman is a view shared “not long ago by every society in the world, shared by most, if not all, of our ancestors, and shared still to-
day by a significant number of 
the States.”
The judges acknowledge 
that gay and lesbian couples are capable of being in loving, committed relationships and effectively raising children. But those facts don’t mean states must suddenly believe gay marriage bans violate the con-stitution, in the opinion of the 6th Circuit.
The ruling suggests making 
gay marriage legal could open the door for others, such as po-lygamists, to claim their unions also constitute legal marriage. “If it is constitutionally irratio-nal to stand by the man-woman definition of marriage, it must be constitutionally irrational to stand by the monogamous defi-
nition of marriage,” it says.

Alligator Contributing Writer
A UF-led group of scientists and research-
ers across the Southeast have received nation-
al recognition for their outreach in reducing climate change.  
The Southeast Climate Extension project 
was awarded the National Institute of Food and Agriculture’s Multistate Efforts. The part-nership award recognizes groups and organi-zations for their contribution to the National Institute of Food and Agriculture’s mission to improve agricultural science.
The Southeast Climate Extension organiza-tion is a U.S. Department of Agriculture-funded climate extension project. It was founded in May 2011 at UF’s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. The group hopes to increase the 
awareness of climate sci-ence, develop and conduct 
workshops, and produce 
educational material across the Southeast.
Clyde W. Fraisse is an associate professor at 
UF and the program director of the project. He 
worked on the development and implementa-tion of AgroClimate, an information and deci-sion support system that helps the agricultural industry reduce climate risks in the Southeast.
Fraisse said the award should establish the 
project’s  leadership in climate and agricultur-al science in the U.S.
The project consists of 19 members from 
six universities: UF, University of Georgia, Florida State University, Auburn University, Clemson University and Florida Agricultural 
and Mechanical University. Nine of the mem-
bers are from UF. 
“I think my favorite parts are learning from 
farmers about their challenges and helping to find and promote the management solutions to deal with these challenges,” said Daniel Dourte, the project coordinator and a UF post-doctoral research associate.
Within the project, Dourte helped develop 
a web-based tool designed to give specific estimates of water consumed in agricultural production. Working long distance has cre-ated some challenges, including overcoming communication problems and finding ways for everyone to contribute, he said.
But he said the award will shed light on the 
significance of the researchers participating in the climate extension project.
“This is an emerging field, and I think it re-
flects really well on University of Florida to be home to this important project,” he said.

UF women’s tennis’ Austin advances at National Indoors
Freshman Brooke Austin was the lone UF representative at the USTA 
National Indoor Championships to win her ﬁ  rst-round singles match. Austin topped Virginia Tech’s Ilinca Andreea Stoinca in straight sets. Football team captains

Alligator Staff Writer @EricaAlyssa
They may be the reigning 
Southeastern Conference Cham-
pions, but the 2014-15 Florida bas-ketball team isn’t its predecessor. 
Florida ﬁ  nished its lone exhi-
bition game of the season with a 79-70 win against Barry  — an unranked, division II school — on Thursday in Gainesville.
“What I’m trying to ﬁ  gure out 
right now is: are we even talented enough to play defense?” coach Billy Donovan said. “I think we’re better than what we showed but 
we are not, we’re just not tough 
enough in my opinion.”
Redshirt junior Eli Carter end-
ed his ﬁ  rst game since Nov. 29 with 21 points, going 7-of-12 from the ﬁ  eld and making ﬁ  ve of his nine free throws.
“Knowing that all the hard 
work that I put in paid off,” Cart-er said. “It was a long process.”
Carter put the Gators on the 
scoreboard within the ﬁ  rst 30 sec-onds of the game, but Barry fol-lowed with a three-point basket in the nick of time with a 30-second shot clock.
Within the ﬁ  rst few minutes, 
the freshmen got their shot at the 
ball. 
First-year forward Devin Rob-
inson and senior forward Jacob 
Kurtz were subbed in for Carter and center Jon Horford. 
Freshman guard Chris Chioz-
za came off the bench shortly af-ter. But neither freshman scored in the ﬁ  rst half. Chiozza went 
0-for-2 and Robinson 0-for-6.
While Robinson struggled of-
fensively, he was stronger than 
Chiozza on defense. He made two rebounds in the seven minutes he played in the ﬁ  rst half and added one more rebound in the second half.
Chiozza’s ﬁ  rst points came 
during a fast break in the ﬁ  nal 10 minutes of the game. His layup off an assist from Horford pushed the Gators to a 62-46 lead.
Robinson’s ﬁ  rst points came 
on a three-point shot with less than six minutes left in the game, widening Florida’s lead to 69-56.  
A dunk from Robinson fol-
lowed by a fast break layup from Chiozza established the fresh-men’s  presence on the court. 
“I give Chiozza a lot of credit 
because at half-time I really got on him and he really responded,” Donovan said. “I thought he was much more in tune, engaged and did some very, very good things.”
At the end of the ﬁ  rst half, 
Florida had a solid grasp on Barry with a 14-point lead — a number equivalent to the points Carter had scored through the ﬁ  rst 20 minutes. 
While Donovan saw some 
positives out of Carter’s perfor-mance, he was looking for more from the redshirt junior who is supposed to take on a leadership role this season.
“Yeah, he did OK. It’s hard 
for me to say cause I think like Michael Frazier could have had a blow-out game,” Donovan said. 
“Eli made some shots, but that’s 
going to come and go in games. Certainly our balance wasn’t great. … I’m more concerned about his defense right now. Where his commitment level is over there.”
It’s a cold world out there, Gator fans. 
Temperatures dipped well 
into the 40s at one point this week in Gainesville — a rarity in Florida 
during winter, let alone early No-
vember.
And right when we start getting 
back into our comfort zone that is the low 70s, the alligatorSports road crew is on the heels of heading to Nashville to watch a bout under the lights between the Gators and the Commodores of Vanderbilt.
The high temp on Saturday will 
be a crisp 61 degrees, with it drop-ping as low as a chilly 35 degrees by the end of the night.
And we here at alligatorSports 
(except for maybe the cold-blooded Jordan) are internally screaming at this occurrence.
For those of you making the nine-
hour trek to Music City like us, em-brace for the chill.
Now onto the picks!
Alone at the top of the pack with 
a 38-40 record is the Orlando Senti-
nel’s Edgar “candy shop” Thomp-son, who handed out Reese’s peanut 
butter cups to all the younger report-
ers at Wednesday’s football media 
availability. Seriously, Edgar? All 
you’re missing is the broken down 
white van with video games in the back.
Standing in second at 37-41 is al-
ligatorSports staff writer Jonathan “Flat tire” Czupryn, who stumbled into the ofﬁ  ce late Wednesday night after some vehicular malfunctions earlier in the day. God, man. Be-
tween your passenger seat mirror 
hanging on by a limb, brown recluse spiders crawling all over the place and your tire popping, what else is going to happen to you?

Carter excels in exhibition win against Barry

Will Muschamp has seen a fair 
share of streaks snapped during his 
tenure at Florida.
For the ﬁ  rst time since 1990, the 
Gators failed to make a bowl game. For the ﬁ  rst time since 1979, the Gators recorded a losing record. For 
the ﬁ  rst time since 1988, the Gators 
lost to the Commodores.
On Saturday when Florida  faces 
Vanderbilt at 7:30 p.m. in Nashville, Tennessee, Will Muschamp can’t af-
ford to see another letdown.
The Commodores’ 34-17 victory 
against the Gators last year set the 
stage for this year’s Vandy squad to 
take two straight against UF for the 
ﬁ  rst time since 1955. But this game isn’t about history to Muschamp.
“It’s the 2014 Florida team versus 
the 2014 Vanderbilt team,” Mus-champ said.
That bodes well for the Gators.The 2014 Commodores don’t 
have James Franklin at the helm like the 2013 squad did. They don’t have the 30.1 points per game the 2013 team had. They don’t give up 24.6 
points per game anymore.
Instead, this year’s Vandy has 
ﬁ  rst-year head coach Derek Mason. 
It has an average of 19.9 points per game, which is an SEC worst. And 
they give up 32.2 points per game, 
also an SEC worst.
Still, Florida doesn’t want and can’t afford to take any chances. It has a 56-year streak on the line — not to mention a possible shot at an 
SEC East crown.
The Gators need to defeat both 
the Commodores and the Game-
cocks in the next two weeks in order to stay in the hunt for a division lead. 
But losing three of four earlier in the 
year set Muschamp and company back enough to where they must now rely on help to get in.
Because he can’t control the un-
controllables, Muschamp said he has put a “laser focus” on Vander-bilt this week in preparation for the conference matchup.
“If we don’t take care of our busi-
ness, nothing else matters,” Mus-champ said.
As for the 418 yard rushing at-
tack and the 18-point victory the Gators are coming off of, Muschamp said his players shouldn’t be getting a big head, especially heading into Saturday’s matchup.
“We don’t have anything to be 
overconﬁ  dent about,” he said. “I think that one of the things you talk to your players about is how you 
respond after a loss and how you re-
spond after a win. We need to form some consistency in what we’re do-ing.”
The Gators are looking for Treon 
Harris to step up and become more of an offensive weapon. The true freshman had just six pass attempts 
last week, but offensive coordinator Kurt Roper said the passing game 
should expand if Florida expects to reach Muschamp’s level of desired 
“consistency.”
“We’re going to ask him to do 
more,” Roper said of Harris. “He’s 
going to have to make plays in the passing game, but we all learn on Saturday.”
As for the rushing game, Ma-
son said he expects Florida to keep 
its identity on offense and continue 
giving the ball to Matt Jones and Kelvin Taylor.
He added that he knows the 
Gators want Harris to be more in-volved, but like Muschamp said, he’ll have to wait and see that until he believes it.
“I expect to see it evolve some, 
maybe see six or seven more pass-es,” Mason said. “But I don’t expect to see much more than that. They’re going to run the ball.”

UF coach Will Muschamp looks down the ﬁ  eld during Florida’s 38-20 win against Georgia on Satur-
day at EverBank Field in Jacksonville.
FOOTBALLFlorida heads to Vanderbilt with season still on the line
the second half of their exhibition game 
against Barry. We get it Landon, you want to play. But you need to face the facts that height alone doesn’t equal talent.
In fourth place at 36-42 is alligatorSports 
staff writer Morgan “Agriculture Hater” Moriarty, who admitted on our podcast on Wednesday that she wrote in Alabama of-fensive coordinator Lane Kifﬁ  n on her bal-lot for Commissioner of Agriculture. What were you thinking, Morgan? Clearly, Todd Gurley would have been the better choice.
Keeping steady at the middle of the 
pack with a 34-44 clip is 247sports.com’s Thomas “all hail the Aggies” Goldkamp, who was the only Picks columnist this week to pick Texas A&M (+21) to cover the 
spread against Auburn. Really, Thomas? 
You’ve been out of dead-ass-last for a little while now. Do you want to go back there?
Tied with Goldkamp for ﬁ  fth place is 
alligatorSports.org editor Richard “Brisket is the hands-down No. 1 seed” Johnson, who spent more time arguing his top-four seeds for his barbecue bracket than the en-tire playoff committee took to create their latest top-25 poll. We get it, man. And just like the playoff committee tabbing two SEC teams in its current poll, Richard pulled a similar tactic and has two different types 
of ribs in his bracket as well. Can you stop 
with the bias and put some pulled pork in your top four?
In seventh at 33-45 is Gator Country’s 
Nick “Don’t Call it a Comeback” de la Torre, who ﬁ  nally escaped the elusive dead-ass-last spot for the ﬁ  rst time in a month. Don’t get too excited, Nick. You’re still on pace to have a worse record than your Miami Dolphins. Now, if only your Tinder account had as much success as your picks column this year...
And in dead-ass-last with a piss-poor 
record of 32-46 is alligatorSports editor Jordan “McFear the Beard” McPherson, who is embracing his inner caveman this month as he takes part in the annual “no-shave November.” Make sure you don’t go into any family neighborhoods, Jordan. You’ll probably give kids nightmares.

Florida volleyball looks to 
stay unbeaten in Southeastern 
Conference play when it takes 
on Alabama (19-5, 7-3 SEC) 
tonight at 7 in the O’Connell Center.
After beating Tennessee in 
a 3-0 sweep on Sunday, Flori-da (18-3, 12-0 SEC)  continued as the only team in SEC play with no losses.
Coach Mary Wise credits 
Florida’s success to a strong back row, which is maintained by seniors Holly Pole, Maddie Monserez and Taylor Unroe.
“Dave (Boos) always calls 
us the veterans, that we’re try-ing to help the younger play-ers and stuff,” Pole said. “But it’s nice, we can help out the 
front row players a lot more 
than we have in the past. We know our positions but we also know other people’s posi-
tions.”
Pole, now Florida’s go-to 
libero, was named SEC Defen-
sive Player of the Week after picking up 17 digs and two 
service aces against Tennes-
see.
Florida will have to contin-
ue its dominance on defense 
if it wants to stay unbeaten 
against Alabama. The Gators hold a 39-0 record against the Crimson Tide and are 37-0 un-der Wise.
Alabama is the biggest of-
fensive threat in conference play that Florida will play un-til it faces Kentucky on Nov. 16.
The Crimson Tide have 
two of the best right side and 
opposite hitters in the confer-
ence in Krystal Rivers and Kat Hutson. 
Rivers is ranked second in 
the SEC and Hutson sits be-hind Rivers in fourth for kills per set.
Rivers spent her offseason 
battling Hodgkins Lymphoma, 
a cancer that affects the lymph 
nodes, and has returned to Al-abama to lead the team in kills (394) and service aces (32).
Hutson, a 6-foot-3 fresh-
man, will be the player to 
watch in a matchup against 
Florida’s 6-foot-4 middle blocker Rhamat Alhassan, who has had little trouble 
blocking other teams smaller 
outside hitters.
Though Hutson is a fresh-
man, she is doing well enough to sit second to Rivers in kills 
for the season with 333 and 
is fourth in the conference in kills per set (3.74). 
“As we move to this part 
of the season and the quality of teams that we have left on the regular season, you know we’re playing teams that are bigger, more physical, play 
higher above the net, serve 
tougher, hit harder, that’s what happens when you play experienced, physical teams,” 
Wise said. 
“And we got a bunch of 
those left on the schedule. So 
we’ll have plenty of opportu-nities to improve because of 
the high quality of teams we 
still have left to play.”
