Veterans for Peace displayed 6,400 tombstones along Northwest Eighth Avenue over the Memorial Day week-end in remembrance of the fallen American service members who have died in the wars in Iraq and Afghani-stan since 2001. This was the group’s sixth annual Memorial Mile. Each tombstone bore a soldier’s name, date of death, age, branch of service, rank and hometown.
STAFF REPORT
The perimeter of a 2,088-acre wildﬁ  re in northeast 
Gainesville was secured Saturday evening and held 
through Monday night, thanks to rain and slowed-down winds.
Five Alachua County ﬁ  res that started Friday spewed 
enough smoke for Florida Highway Patrol to block traf-ﬁ  c, and one of the blazes threatened ﬁ  ve buildings near County Road 1475.
The largest of the ﬁ  ve ﬁ  res moved west and devel-
oped two heads.
On Saturday ofﬁ  cials set up a roadblock on the street 
between Northeast 156th Avenue and CR 1475. The road was clear with no smoke by 10:30 a.m. Monday.
Ofﬁ  cials worried winds out of the west could push 
the ﬁ  res right into a large area of dry timber, and Bond speculated that enough wind could fan the ﬂ  ames into a 5,000-acre ﬁ  re.
The area accumulated at least 1.5 inches of rain, Fires, smoke

With budget cuts threatening art and mu-
sic programs across Florida public schools 
and universities, one Altamonte Springs par-ent ran 100 miles to support the arts.
Steve Wheeler, 53, completed a non-stop, 
28-hour ultramarathon from Orlando to Gainesville on Saturday afternoon to raise awareness about cuts by the Florida Legis-lature and its effect on the future of art pro-grams in schools.
“He thinks it’s crucial that they don’t 
cut these classes because they will beneﬁ  t 
someone in the future,” said Leslie Wheeler, 
Wheeler’s 22-year-old daughter and a UF alumna. “He doesn’t want art to be eliminat-ed from schools and not give kids a chance to explore their creative side.”Wheeler’s “Art to Architecture” ultra-
marathon reﬂ  ected how his daughter’s art education during elementary, middle and 
high school helped her graduate summa cum 
laude from UF’s architecture program on May 5. She will pursue a master’s degree in architecture at Washington University in St. Louis.
“My daughter was blessed with really 
great teachers who helped her get through the architecture school and graduate,” Steve Wheeler said.
His run began at 9 a.m. Friday in Alta-monte Springs, stopping at Spring Lake El-ementary, Teague Middle School and Lake Brantley High School, where his daughter attended school.
He also stopped at Bear Lake Elementary 
where his two sons, Price, 6, and Lance, 10, are enrolled.
By 10:30 a.m., Steve Wheeler was on 
State Road 441 running to Gainesville as his 
daughter drove a car that followed him dur-
ing the run.

Algae blooms now plague the Santa Fe River, blanket-
ing parts of the river in green.
“You can’t miss them,” Jim Wood, owner of the Santa 
Fe Canoe Outpost, said. “They’re everywhere.”
The Alachua County Health Department identiﬁ  ed al-
gae spreading from Highway 27 Bridge to upstream of 
Poe Springs.
One test sample taken by the health department showed a potentially harmful bacterium. This algae strain 
is known to produce a neurotoxin in Aus-tralia but has not been proven toxic in the United States.
The algae are only a symptom of a 
wider problem — extremely low water 
levels in north Central Florida.
Chris Bird, director of the Alachua 
County Environmental Protection De-
partment, said the springs that dot the 
Santa Fe River are now the river’s only sources of water ﬂ  ow. Since the spring water makes the river water extra 
clear, Bird said, it allows more sunlight beneath the sur-face, which helps algae thrive. This sucks up the river’s oxygen supply.
“That can kill the ﬁ  sh because they don’t have enough 
oxygen to survive,” Bird said.
Wood said he now has to drive his customers three 
miles down river to launch their canoes or kayaks.
“It’s a 180-degree difference,” Wood said. “It’s like a 
desert compared to an oasis.”

City of Pied Piper fame again 
faces rat problem
BERLIN — The German city 
of Hamelin may be in need of 
another Pied Piper — it seems 
the rats are back.
City officials say a popu-
lar fountain has been put out of service after the rodents 
gnawed through a power cable, according to the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.
The Lower Saxony city is 
where, legend has it, the Pied Piper led all the rats out in 1284 with his magic pipe into the Weser River, where they drowned.
But more than 700 years lat-
er, city officials say such dras-tic measures may not be neces-sary. The fountain was due to be permanently closed anyway 
because of the high upkeep 
costs.
And the solution in the fic-
titious Piper story isn’t practi-
cal anyway: Rats are actually 
pretty good swimmers.

Rest didn’t come easily for 
Jose Perez.
It was stiflingly hot on the 
Cruz del Sur tour bus, but for the 
19-year-old anthropology and political science junior and the six other UF students traveling with him, it was better than sleeping 
exposed to the near-freezing tem-
peratures of the Peruvian night.
The double-decker bus rested 
on a stretch of the Pan-American 
Highway in Peru, just north of 
the town of Chala. It was May 9, and the bus had barely moved during the last two days.
The students were a collection 
of Lombardi and Stamps Schol-ars. Their curiosity brought them 
to Peru more than a week be-
fore their Scholars in Peru study abroad program began, but a na-tionwide strike stalled their trip across the country.
On May 8, groups of indepen-
dent Peruvian gold miners set up roadblocks to protest recent 
government regulation of their 
trade.
Since then, the stationary bus 
had become a makeshift prison. 
Miners spray painted the bus and 
beat on its walls with their fists.
The students had been unable 
to shower, change clothes or use a real bathroom since they first 
boarded the bus on May 7.
Two days later, they had to 
decide whether to stay on the bus 
or try to make their way to Lima, 
the capital, on their own.
Chala was running out of food 
and water, but if the students left, 
they’d be exposed to a strike that could easily turn violent.
It wasn’t what they had ex-
pected when they left the United States.
On May 7, the seven UF stu-
dents flew into Lima at 1 a.m.
A bus took them south to 
Arequipa, where they planned to split into two groups. The stu-dents would reconvene in Cuzco on May 13. There, they would 
meet with their program director 
before the study abroad program began three days later.
Fewer than 17 hours after Tyler 
Benjamin arrived in the country’s capital, the 20-year-old journal-ism senior and his six companions boarded the tour bus. They’d be 
taking the Carretera Panameri-
cana, or Pan-American Highway, which stretches the length of the country’s west coast. The journey to Arequipa was supposed to last 
16 hours, and Benjamin was al-
ready anticipating hiking Colca Canyon as he drifted into sleep.
At 3 a.m. May 8, Benjamin 
awoke to other bus passengers whispering in Spanish.
The bus stopped about a half-
mile north of the town Yauca.
It was there the miners 
scrawled “Viva el Paro,” long live the strike, on the bus. But there were no roadblocks, and the southward trek resumed be-fore 6 a.m.
Three hours later, the bus was 
stopped outside of Chala.
About 100 vehicles lined the 
highway to the north and south, blocked by tires filled with burn-ing debris. To the west, a 200-foot 
drop off a cliff led to the ocean. 
Decrepit one-story houses and 
desert lay to the east.
The road ahead was littered 
with the blue hard hats of sleep-ing miners.
“They were literally every-
where,” Perez said. He estimated 
about 400 miners were present on May 8.
Outside, the scent of burning 
rubber, human urine and decom-posing trash began to fill the air.
Eventually, the student’s hun-
ger forced them from their shel-ter. They hadn’t eaten a full meal since their departure.
“I thought I could ration my 
Clif Bars and water,” Benjamin said. “But after a day or two, I re-alized that wasn’t going to hap-pen.”
In order to buy food in Chala, 
they had to cross the strike line.
Perez, who speaks fluent Span-
ish, acted as the group’s primary translator. He and the two other 
Spanish-speaking students gath-
ered information about the strike in town.
The Peruvian government was 
trying to force independent min-ers to work for private compa-nies. The miners didn’t want to be taxed for their work.
“We were literally caught in 
the power struggle of this gov-ernment that’s trying to cover up the strike,” Perez said.
By 6 p.m. the sun had set, forc-ing the passengers back on the bus.
“We were told the army was 
coming,” Benjamin said. “Then, nothing.”
The next morning, about 10 
police officers showed up with riot gear. They were outnum-
bered almost 60 to one.
The officers stood shoulder-
to-shoulder at the strike line, but 
soon retired to eat Popsicles in the shade of the buses, Benjamin 
said.
No one else came, and condi-
tions were worse for everyone 
trapped on the highway.
The holding tanks of the tour 
buses’ bathrooms were reaching their capacities, and drivers be-gan to empty them outside. Riv-ers of waste streamed down the highway, and trash cans over -
flowed.
The radio chattered with peo-
ple worrying about lack of sup-plies, and the students knew that could mean less food for every-one.
That night, a group of agitated 
passengers tried to remove the roadblocks, but the miners’ con-fidence and numbers had esca-lated, and they struck back.
Packs of 10 to 20 miners 
roamed among the buses, yelling at passengers and punching the sides of the students’ bus.
Inside, the students crouched 
in the middle aisle. They shield-ed their heads with food trays — Perez said it was the first time he’d ever feared for his life.
The miners eventually left, but 
the threat of violence pushed the students to act after two days and two nights.
Benjamin said he spoke to the State Department and the U.S. Embassy in Peru by cellphone ear -
lier that day. Neither was aware of the strikes or roadblocks, nor could they provide help.
If the students were going to 
leave, they would have to do it alone.
They’d heard that three more 
strikes lay between Chala and the 
students’ original destination of 
Arequipa. Backtracking toward Lima, though, would mean cross-
ing through the first strike they’d 
passed.
Either option would mean 
traveling by foot, unprotected.
By the morning of May 10, the 
strikers were acting as a militia, 
carrying sticks with nails driven through the sides.
That morning, Benjamin and 
another student were buying food in Chala when they saw a commotion on the highway.
“I saw people jogging back to 
their buses,” Benjamin said. “I hit [my friend] on the shoulder, told him we had to go and overpaid for the meal.  I just gave the wom-
an a coin and left.”
The travelers took shelter in 
their vehicles in case of a riot.  But 
like the night before, the distur -
bance ended without violence.
At 11:30 a.m., Benjamin and 
the other students decided to leave.
He collected his bags and be-
gan marching north, toward the end of a line of 50 buses.
At the end of the line, the 
students found two men taxi-
ing people to Yauca. The group 
pooled its money and bought two cab rides.
The taxi drivers dropped the 
students about a 45-minute walk south of Yauca.
Perez asked two Peruvian 
women if they were close to the end of the strike. They laughed.
“No, no, no, no,” one of the 
women said. “Lejos.” Far.
As the students approached 
Yauca, the damage from the 
strike became more noticeable.
Burned tires, electrical cords 
and rocks littered the way. After 
that, it was desert.
After nearly three hours of 
walking in the midday sun, Perez 
spotted a hopeful sign.
A car-carrier truck bearing a 
Brazilian flag sat unblocked on 
the service road that ran parallel 
to the highway.
Perez, who also speaks Por -
tuguese, found out the truck be-
longed to a father and son who had been making trips to Nazca for supplies.
If each student paid about $22 
— 10 times the normal cab fare in Peruvian cities — the Brazil-ians were willing to transport the group to Nazca.
“At this point, it just seemed 
like pennies to me,” Perez said.
The students arrived in Nazca 
that evening. There, they enjoyed their first showers and full meals in three days. They returned to 
Lima two days later.
On May 16 they began their 
study abroad program on sched-ule, spending the next week and a 
half building wood-fueled stoves in the highlands around Cuzco.
The students traveled to ex-
pose themselves to the world’s 
ills and wonders, and their three 
days on the highway had brought to life the gritty lessons they had only studied in the classroom.
“It was fantastic and roman-
tic and terrifying and uncertain all at once,” Benjamin said. “For so long we did nothing to help ourselves, expecting it would just get resolved. I learned I can make 
moves for myself in a foreign 
country, no matter what.”4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, MAY 29, 2012

Gay rights have been making national 
headlines, and some members of UF’s LG-
BTQ community think it’s about time.
In 2010, former Rutgers University stu-
dent Dharun Ravi used a webcam to view 
his roommate, Tyler Clementi, being in-
timate with a man. Ravi told friends and Twitter followers there would be another viewing.
The next day , Clementi jumped to 
his death from the George Washington Bridge.
Ravi was convicted May 21 of intimi-
dation as a hate crime and tampering with 
evidence, according to a New York Times 
article. He faced up to 10 years in prison but received 30 days and community ser -
vice.
Outgoing UF Pride Student Union 
president and English senior Ricky Carter, 22, said the LGBTQ community wasn’t pushing for the maximum sentence for Ravi.  
Carter said he thinks most members of 
the gay community are satisfied with the sentence. They didn’t want a witch hunt.
The trial sends a clear message that 
the justice system will take action when people are harassed and their privacy is invaded, he said.
“You cannot bully people,” Carter said. 
“You cannot harass people.”
Ravi’s sentencing trended on Twitter 
and was prominently featured on major news channels and online sites in the days before and after the verdict.   
UF’s Assistant Director of Multicultur -
al and Diversity Affairs, Lauren Hannahs, 27, said she thought coverage of the case brought much-needed attention to harass-ment of gay people, but the media were misguided in framing the issue as new.  
She said the media didn’t pay enough 
attention to the history of homophobic be-
havior or how deeply it is embedded in this 
country .   
“It’s socially accept-
able to be homophobic,” 
said Hannahs, who di-rects Lesbian, Gay, Bi-sexual and Transgender Affairs.  
In April, UF Student 
Senate President Aundre Price announced 
the Bias and Apprehension Committee to 
review university policy on hate crimes.
In the past, Hannahs said, universities 
typically handled student hate crimes in-
ternally . The Dharun Ravi case set new standards by taking the crimes to court.
President Barack Obama was recently 
featured on a May cover of Newsweek magazine with a rainbow halo as “The First Gay President.”
Hannahs said she thinks the high-
profile nature of Ravi’s sentencing is not strongly linked to Obama’s May 9 en-dorsement of same-sex marriage. Instead, she attributed media coverage to increas-
ing acceptance of the LGBTQ community .    
“I think it’s a trajectory of where the 
country is going,” she said.Media plays increasing 
role in gay rights issues

City should stay 
out of tobacco
A few weeks ago, the Gainesville City Commission 
passed a resolution discouraging businesses from sell-ing candy-ﬂ  avored tobacco products in the area.
Of course, like most government actions, it’s just “for the 
children.”
After the city commission researched the issue, it found 
that the products were allegedly being marketed to young people through the allure of different ﬂ  avors.
Andrew Romero, a tobacco prevention specialist, said one 
in six young people between 11 and 17 have tried ﬂ  avored tobacco in Alachua County.
Of course, Romero does not provide any statistics into 
which type of tobacco they tried ﬁ  rst, nor did he compare these statistics to other cities.
If this candy-ﬂ  avored tobacco is the ﬁ  rst thing these mi-
nors have tried, we might be able to make the claim that it entices them. However, if they already have tried tobacco in other forms before trying ﬂ  avored tobacco, then it’s really not any more harmful than regular tobacco.
Also, if the law already prohibits the sale of tobacco to peo-
ple under the age of 18, what could discouraging the sale of ﬂ  avored tobacco to adults possibly do to further the cause?   
While we do not explicitly advocate the use of tobacco 
products, we do not see how prohibiting or discouraging the sale of candy-ﬂ  avored tobacco will do much to curb the use of tobacco by teens.
Still, according to the University of Michigan’s Monitoring 
the Future survey, cigarette use among teens is declining sub-stantially from year to year across every age group.
Although the county has not yet proposed to ban this ﬂ  a-
vored tobacco, it is not unlikely that it eventually will.
All it takes is more pressure from anti-tobacco advocates 
such as Romero, as well as an appeal to the desires of politi-cians to “protect the children,” and we could see it banned in no time.
We strongly discourage the county commission from go-
ing further on this issue, for a few unintended reasons.
As in every case of prohibition, a ban on the sale of ﬂ  avored 
tobacco to adults will deﬁ  nitely lead to an underground mar-ket in the area for these products.
Then, because of the prohibition, the police will be tasked 
with putting people in jail for selling ﬂ  avored tobacco in the area. Do we really need to put more people in jail for engag-ing in voluntary commerce?
If we want to prevent minors from using tobacco, the last 
thing we want to do is make it illegal. Instead, parents and educators should explain the possible negative side effects of the product and talk to minors like they’re adults.
Treating minors like children through the heavy hand of 
the law and a resounding “no” will do little to inﬂ  uence their 
future decisions.
Let us hope that Gainesville does not follow other cities 
such as Miami and New York City in banning ﬂ  avored to-
bacco sales.UF should look to Montreal for example
It is no secret that in our gloomy economic times, one 
of the ﬁ  rst sectors to get hit is education. Due to these budget cuts, many universities, including our own, have 
resorted to tuition hikes. These tuition hikes are part of the dwindling spiral that is our economy.
You can open countless newspapers and read about the 
“generation of debt.” While our predecessors struggled from credit card debt, our generation is faced with crippling stu-dent loan debt far surpassing those of previous generations.
We are not only drowning in our debt, but our obstinate 
Congress couldn’t reach a decision on a bill that would keep down the current interest rate on our loans. Without an agreement, the current interest rate will double. This brings the average student further away from seeing the end of the debt-free tunnel.
Now we wonder, with so much talk regarding students 
and their future, where are the students?
Recently , our neighbors to the north passed their 100th 
day of protesting student fees. This past week, several thou-sand students in Montreal protested the rising tuition fees as well as a new bill meant to slow down the protests.
As a result, 518 demonstrators were arrested due to a bill 
prohibiting the freedom to publicly assemble without prior police approval (a planned route and a notice eight hours before the event).
Despite having one of the lowest tuitions in Canada, 
Quebec students still felt that the 82 percent tuition increase within ﬁ  ve years was not fair. These students have not backed down from the ﬁ  ght and are defending their right to a cost-effective education.
With the inspiration of our spirited neighbors, why hasn’t 
the ﬁ  ght been brought forward at UF?  
Barely a month ago the UF administration threatened to 
drastically cut the Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) department due to budget concerns. CISE students came together and, with several protests, were able to pressure the administration to change the pro-posed plan.
The Architecture and Fine 
Arts Library has been operat-ing under the threat of shut-down for two semesters. Yet, overwhelming student and faculty opposition has allowed the AFA library to survive an-other round of budget cuts.
However, the journalism 
and music libraries may not be as fortunate. Starting this fall, journalism and music majors might have to head over to the lovely and crowded Library West for pertinent materials.
UF has been hiking tuition since 2008. Still, Gator opposi-
tion has been pretty low. There’s no comparison to the out-cry experienced in Canada to similar measures.
When a bill that would have allowed UF and Florida State 
University administration to raise tuition to an uncapped percentage (as opposed to the previous limit of 15 percent), passed through the Florida legislature, student opposition was very low.
Fortunately , our usually disappointing governor vetoed 
the bill, and we live to see another year of a probably “low” 15 percent tuition increase.
It saddens me that the Gator Nation is standing by as 
these tuition hikes occur. On top of the hikes, we face a 5 percent increase of student fees for the Reitz Union renova-tions.
Despite the extremely tough economic times, our school 
is valuing renovations over our libraries, departments and students.
Gators, it’s about time that we say , “No!” Let’s take back 
our education and become a leading example in the struggle for fair education.
Our time is now. Gators, ﬁ  ght back.  Michela Martinazzi is an art history junior at UF. Her col-

On Tuesday afternoon, former U.K. Prime Minister Gordon 
Brown gave a lecture on the global economy in which he argued that the world is becoming ever more intercon-
nected and that many problems will need to be solved through greater international cooperation.
While Brown’s argument is true with regard to some pressing 
issues, further centralization of political power isn’t wise.
The first part of Brown’s argument is most certainly correct: 
“We are all part of an interdependent economy. What happens to us in one country affects all of us right across the world.”
This point was underscored yesterday at the Dartmouth Col-
lege economics department’s weekly seminar, where University of Michigan economist Jing Zhang discussed the impact of Chi-nese productivity growth on living standards in other countries.
The days of autarky and isolationism are long gone.Furthermore, it is true that this interdependence necessitates 
increased international cooperation on certain issues. Greenhouse gas emissions from one country affect not just the polluting coun-try but the entire planet.
Alleviating extreme poverty is not and should not be the sole 
responsibility of the countries in which the poorest citizens live.
However, in the interest of protecting individual liberties and 
for pragmatism’s sake, I strenuously disagree that further trans-
fers of power from local and state governments to national and 
international bodies is a wise course of action.
It is often much more difficult for a government to infringe 
upon the rights and liberties of its citizens if those citizens are free to move to another jurisdiction. Thus, in the interest of protecting individual liberties, political powers should be put in the hands of local and state governments rather than national or interna-tional governing authorities as far as reasonably possible.
Take health care, for instance.
Obviously, there are many health-related issues that are best 
addressed nationally and internationally. Successfully combating 
the spread of infectious and communicable diseases has often re-quired significant international cooperation.
Likewise, it often makes more sense for research to be funded 
by the federal rather than state govern-ments, as a discovery made in one state will likely end up benefiting people in multiple states.
However, it is wrong to assume that 
health insurance is within the proper jurisdiction of the federal government.
I have no problem with Massachusetts adopting an individual 
mandate or Vermont adopting a single-payer system. After all, if any of these states’ residents object to either of these policies, then these residents can always move to New Hampshire.
It is much more difficult, however, to move to another country 
if you object to a federal government policy.
The second problem with centralization of political power is 
more pragmatic — sometimes a policy that is entirely appropriate for one place is not at all appropriate for another. The Eurozone’s current monetary and financial mess is a case in point.
For more than half a century, many European leaders have 
worked tirelessly to improve economic integration and interna-tional cooperation among different European countries. In many ways, this has been a good idea.
I especially applaud the relative success of the European Com-
mon Market, which has greatly liberalized trade in goods and services within Europe, and the Schengen Area, allowing for the free migration of people throughout much of the continent.
However, the euro has undoubtedly been a disaster. With the 
enactment of a single currency, the countries using the euro left themselves susceptible to the kind of severe macroeconomic dif-ficulties they are currently experiencing.
Many economists on both sides of the Atlantic understood this 
possibility and thus recommended against the adoption of the 
single currency, yet the European political elites decided to forge 
ahead anyway. Ironically, Gordon Brown, who was the U.K.’s chancellor of the Exchequer in the early 2000s, clearly understood these potential problems, and he probably deserves much of the credit for keeping the U.K. from adopting the euro in the first place.
It’s true that the countries of the world are becoming more in-
terconnected and that there are many pressing issues that require increased international cooperation. However, we shouldn’t, as a 
general rule, centralize ever more power in the hands of national 
and international bodies.
Jonathan Pedde is a columnist for The Dartmouth at Dartmouth 
College.Did you know it is the year 2012?
Stacey Pritchard doesn’t seem to under -
stand what that means.
Last week on “Anderson Cooper 360,” journal-
ist extraordinaire Anderson Cooper interviewed 
people who had opinions regarding Pastor Charles Worley’s outrageous remarks about homosexual-
ity.
Worley said that we need to “build a great, big, 
large fence 50 or 100 miles long.”
Why?
“Put all the lesbians in there. Fly over and drop 
some food. Do the same thing with the queers and the homosexuals,” Worley said. 
“Have that fence electrified so they can’t get 
out,” he said. “You know what, in a few years, 
they’ll die out. You know why? They can’t repro-
duce.”
I’ll wait here until you do a YouTube search for 
this man and watch him say those words your -
self.
Crazy, right? Not entirely of sound mind and 
body, if you ask me.
So after those inflammatory remarks, Cooper 
took to interviewing some of Worley’s congrega-
tion and supporters. This is when we get to meet 
the aforementioned lovely Stacey Pritchard.
Bless her heart. She is certainly standing by her 
pastor and the words he said, but she also wants to make sure that he didn’t really want to put gay 
men and lesbian women behind an electric fence. 
Those may have been the words he said from 
the pulpit, but he didn’t really mean it, according 
to her.
Pritchard is under the impression that putting 
people behind an electric fence with the intent of 
killing them off eventually just isn’t done any-
more. 
Or that people couldn’t possibly be killed for 
their sexual orientation, so she didn’t see the 
problem with joking about it.
But as Cooper points out, “It’s happening right 
now in 2012 in Iraq and Iran.”
“This is a pastor that speaks the word of God,” 
Pritchard said. “Anybody can take it any way they want to. And if they 
don’t like it, they don’t have to. They can turn 
— turn around and go 
on.”
My problem is the 
fact that someone 
thinks the word of God 
is telling him or her to 
kill off an entire way of life. 
That’s rather scary and important to note.Like Cooper also said, “It’s called the Holo-
caust. It has happened. You said nobody is go-ing to kill homosexuals. Homosexuals are killed around the world.”
Homosexuality is clearly far away from becom-
ing a non-issue. Just as we need to stop mention-ing that women are funny now, we also need to stop bringing up the simple fact that someone is gay.
Because once we do, people might start to ac-
cept people who are “different” and stop trying to condemn them to a life behind an electric fence.
Columnist Bruce Sallan wrote that he believes 
the show “Glee” is “portraying a fantasy world 
with minimal consequences for the experimenta-
tion and sexual promiscuity these young people indulge in.”
Perhaps it is a fantasy world, Sallan. Maybe it’s 
slightly unrealistic to portray a healthy relation-
ship that also happens to be homosexual on tele-
vision.
(In full disclosure, I haven’t seriously watched 
that show in a while, but I’m at least sure that the infamous gay “plotline” hasn’t been happy-go-lucky and easy for the characters.)
Obviously there are a lot of things that go into 
forming the opinion of the public. Social struc-tures such as school, church and home have a big responsibility in raising people to be functional 
members of society. Let’s not ruin that by shoving 
our peers behind an electric fence.

Steve Wheeler, 53, runs on the sidewalk of Southeast 13th Street Saturday afternoon 
as he finishes his last leg of a 100-mile ultramarathon that began the day before in Altamonte Springs and ended in Gainesville. The 28-hour run was done to raise awareness about the cuts by the Florida Legislature and its effect on the future of art programs in schools.

RESEARCH
SAMANTHA BLOCK
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF researchers studying ways to less-
en liver damage have received a grant of 
nearly $1.3 million from the National Insti-
tute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney 
Disease.
The research team hopes to confirm 
that the liver’s ability to recover from isch-emia/reperfusion injury — the damage from a lack of oxygen and nutrients — is 
associated with the process by which cells 
remove damaged mitochondria.
The research is headed by principal 
investigators Christiaan Leeuwenburgh, 
chief of the biology of aging division in the 
department of aging and geriatric research, and Jae-Sung Kim, assistant professor of surgery in the UF College of Medicine.Kim and his research team disproved a 
previous study that found the autophagy process damages the liver during the ag-ing process and there was no way to use 
older livers.
The team has also been studying the 
link between impaired autophagy with 
diseases such as cancer and neurological disorders. Liver transplants can be very 
dangerous, especially on older individuals with cancer, Kim said.
Only about 30 percent of individuals on 
the liver transplant list receive a donor or -
gan, Kim said. He hopes to expand the do-
nor pool by including older individuals.
“Our team has found that even though 
a senior person has cancer, there is now a potential way to safely perform the op-eration to expand their life and quality of life,” he said.UF researchers receive $1.3M grant for liver damage research
Steve Wheeler has completed six other 100-mile ultramarathons
Steve Wheeler started running ultramara-
thons in his 40s, each race ranging from 50 to 
100 miles.
In 2010, he ran his first 100-mile race dur -
ing the Western States Endurance Run in 
California.
He said he has completed six other 100-
mile ultramarathons, including the 2011 Iron 
Horse Endurance Runs in Florahome.
To train for long-distance running, Wheel-
er runs about 20 to 30 miles several times a week through trails at the Wekiwa Springs 
State Park near his house in Altamonte 
Springs. He sometimes runs up to 70 miles in a session to build endurance.
During runs that could last several hours, 
Wheeler said he keeps his mind busy to maintain focus. He also said running helps 
him stay calm.
“I’m in real estate, and it’s stressful,” he 
said. “So going out and running is a great 
stress reliever.”
As her father battled fatigue, dehydration 
and the north Florida heat Friday afternoon, Leslie Wheeler made sure to have aid sup-plies ready.
She said throughout the ultramarathon, 
she stopped every two miles to give her fa-ther food and water to replenish his energy. Later in the run, her father was drinking a bottle of water per mile.
During the night, Wheeler ran past The 
Villages, Belleview and Ocala.
At around 11:30 a.m. Saturday, the Wheel-
ers approached the 90-mile mark at Paynes Prairie near McIntosh.
Smoke from brush fires covered the area, 
making breathing difficult for Steve Wheeler as he ran.
Leslie Wheeler drove her father 10 miles 
up the road until they escaped the smoke to continue the run.
At 2:30 p.m., after 28 hours and 100 miles 
of running, Wheeler arrived at UF near the architecture and fine arts buildings, symbol-
izing the end of his journey and his daugh-
ter’s undergraduate education.
Steve Wheeler’s run has drawn praise 
from UF faculty who support funding public school art programs.
“We in the art world are so grateful when 
someone individually decides to take up the banner,” said Margaret Mertz, associate dean of the College of Fine Arts.
Steve Wheeler said the Orlando-to-
Gainesville run was his toughest challenge to date due to blistering heat, smoke and hilly 
terrain.
“You just have to keep telling yourself to 
keep going,” he said on Saturday.
Leslie Wheeler said she hopes her father’s 
run garners more support from families 
and students to help save art programs in schools.
The Wheelers said they are currently seek-
ing donations for the Seminole County Pub-lic Schools and UF’s fine arts and architecture departments.
“It’s really important for a lot of people’s 
futures,” she said.RUN , from page 1Fires might have been intended
she said, and fire activity was minimal as of 
Monday night. Sunday night, five personnel, three brush trucks and three tractors stood by in case the blaze grew. Three personnel with brush trucks, one supervisor and two 
trucks observed the fire Monday.
Alachua County Fire Rescue, volunteer 
firefighters, Florida Forestry Services, Ala-
chua County Sheriff’s Office, Gainesville Fire Rescue, the Gainesville Police Department and the Red Cross had responded to the vari-ous fires.
Ludie Bond, district spokeswoman for 
the Florida Fire Service, said these fires mir -
ror fires set by an unknown suspect this weekend last year. They could be instances of arson.
“They seem suspicious,” she said.Police helicopters patrolled the fires dur -
ing the weekend to look for suspicious activ-
ity . 
No injuries have been reported.
But the fire could hurt more than just 
people.As the noon sun hung in the smoky sky 
on Saturday , brothers Leon and V ernon Fuller waited in two small tractors and looked out for more fire moving toward Leon Fuller’s 80 acres of mostly pine trees.
About half of the land burned overnight, 
said Leon Fuller, who worked for the Divi-sion of Forestry in the 1980s.
The brothers were up at 2 a.m. putting out 
fire by plowing containment lines with the tractors, Fuller, 65, said.
To keep fire from spreading, the Fullers 
and forestry workers plowed paths about 10 feet wide with tractors, knocking trees and debris away from the path.
“[Fire] won’t burn the bare ground,” Full-
er said.
Forestry workers widened the contain-
ment lines to 20 to 30 feet on Saturday in preparation for strong winds Sunday.
But rain during the second half of Me-
morial Day weekend quenched many of the flames and left the fire manageable. Bond said the status of the fire depended on the weather early in the week.FIRE  from page 1

Poll Question
Who should be Florida’s No. 3 starter in the 
postseason: Karsten Whitson or Jonathon Crawford? Vote online at alligatorSports.org.Help Wanted
Men’s tennis coach Andy Jackson resigned after 11 seasons. Women’s golf coach Jan Dowling stepped down after three years. Read more at alligatorSports.org.
Florida coach Kevin O’Sullivan is playing the waiting 
game and it’s time to stop. The Gators can no longer wait for Karsten Whitson to ﬁ  nd himself.
  In arguably his most important start of the season, 
Whitson lasted just 2.1 innings in an 8-6 loss to Vanderbilt in the Southeastern Conference Tournament semiﬁ  nals Saturday.
  Coming into this season, Whitson had high expecta-
tions after a stellar freshman campaign. He recorded a 2.40 ERA, a .235 batting average against and a 3.3-to-1 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 97.1 innings in 2011.
  This season, Whitson’s ERA is 
3.41  and his batting average against is .296 in 31.2 frames. His strikeout-to-walk ratio: 1-to-1.
  Whitson has pitched at least 
ﬁ  ve innings in only two of his 10 starts this season: once against Cal State Fullerton on Feb. 18 and again at Auburn on May 19.
  The sophomore right-hander has struggled with inju-
ries. A groin issue sidelined Whitson during fall practice 
and once he recovered, his arm wasn’t in shape.
As a result of his physical predicaments, Whitson’s 
lack of command — usually overcome by his velocity — 
has proven costly.� FLORIDA WILL HOST NCAA 
REGIONAL THIS WEEKEND.
  JOE MORGAN
 Alligator Staff Writer
    
 After a lengthy stay in Ala-
bama, the Gators will be home 
for a while.
  Coming off a semiﬁ  nal loss to 
Vanderbilt in the Southeastern Conference Tournament, Florida earned the No. 1 overall seed and 
will host Georgia Tech, Bethune-
Cookman and College of Charles-ton at one of 16 NCAA Regionals. UF will face BC on Friday night at 7 at McKethan Stadium.
  “We’re excited to be in it,” 
coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “We’re excited to be home.”
  The Gators earned the nation’s 
top seeding despite a ninth-in-ning collapse against the Com-
modores on Saturday. Leading 
4-3, Florida closer Austin Mad-dox surrendered ﬁ  ve runs and six stolen bases to Vanderbilt, 
including a successful triple steal 
with the bases loaded.
  UF brought the winning run 
to the plate in the bottom half of the ninth, but ultimately lost to Vandy 8-6.
  “We got exposed there in the 
ninth,” O’Sullivan said. “Nobody likes to lose, but I’m glad it hap-pened this week and not next. … I’m not going to let the ninth 
inning here determine how we 
played in this tournament.”
  While the Gators were gone, 
they rediscovered their hitting 
stroke. Before playing Samford 
on May 15, Florida had slumped in May with a .244 batting aver-age and just three runs per game.
  However, UF reversed its 
fortunes shortly thereafter. The UF falls in SEC semis, earns No. 1 seed

 STONY BROOK, N.Y. — 
The Gators missed two big opportunities in the Final 
Four on Friday night. How-
ever, only one of them was evident during their game.
  Top-seeded Florida 
squandered a golden op-portunity when it let a 12-5 lead with less than 12 min-utes remaining disappear in its semiﬁ  nal game against 
Syracuse en route to a 14-13 
sudden-death overtime loss.
  There were several chanc-
es to put the game away, but 
the Gators struggled to get 
possession down the stretch. Goaltender Mikey Meagher turned the ball over in the second-to-last minute of reg-
ulation with Florida up by 
one goal.
  But Florida not only 
botched its chance to play 
in the national champion-
ship game, they also missed out on the opportunity to do so against a team the play-ers felt they were capable 
of beating: Northwestern, 
which defeated Syracuse 8-6 in the national title game.
  Despite the disappoint-
ing end to the season, coach Amanda O’Leary empha-sized the enormity of what the team had accomplished.  “I’m proud of my team 
and proud of our season as this is just the third year of 
the program,” she said.
  On the last day of the reg-
ular season, UF captured its 
second consecutive Ameri-can Lacrosse Conference 
regular season champion-
ship with an 8-7 win over the Wildcats in Evanston, Ill., snapping Northwestern’s 20-
game home winning streak.
  Then, in Gainesville, on 
May 5, the Gators handed 
the Wildcats their worst loss in more than nine years, a 
14-7 blow-
out in the ﬁ  nals of the ALC Tour-
nament. 
  While it 
is no easy 
task to beat a team three 
times in one season, some Florida players made it clear just how hard it was to watch Northwestern advance far-
ther than they did.
  “The fact that northwest-
ern is going to the champi-
onship when we beat them TWICE this season just pisses me off, we should be playing 
them,” junior defender Sam 
Farrell said on her Twitter account (@goinSAM_) fol-lowing the Wildcats’ semiﬁ  - Florida squanders

  Mikey Meagher (5) defends a goal against Northwestern on May 5. Meagher, who made 15 saves in 
Friday’s loss in the Final Four, surrendered 10 second-half goals on 22 shots against Syracuse.   
Gators will return entire 
starting lineup next sea son
nal win over the Terrapins.
  Barring any transfers, the 
Gators are set to return every 
player from this year’s team ex-
cept for senior attacker Caroline Cochran, who missed most of the season after suffering a torn left 
ACL on Feb. 15.
  No other semiﬁ  nalist team will 
be as lucky as each loses multiple 
starters to graduation.
  The Wildcats will lose 2011 
Tewaaraton Award winner and the tournament’s Most Outstand-
ing Player this year in Shannon 
Smith along with goalkeeper 
Brianne LoManto, who are both seniors.
  Syracuse will graduate Sar-
ah Holden. The senior attacker scored seven goals in two games against the Gators this season in-cluding the game-winner on Fri-day.
  And Maryland loses its third 
and fourth leading scorers to graduation in Kristy Black and Kerri Ellen Johnson.
  Thus, the Gators have another 
big opportunity next year.
  “Getting here means every-
thing,” Meagher said.
“I knew we were going places 
when I stepped onto campus in 
Gainesville. It’s terrible that we 
lost, but we are deﬁ  nitely going places.” LAX , from page 13

Johnson named to All-SEC Tournament team as pitcher, DH
Gators have averaged 5.9 runs 
in their last eight games, includ-ing six contests with double-digit 
hits.
A notable contributor to the 
offensive outburst was Brian 
Johnson, whose effort in the bat-
ter’s box earned him the desig-
nated hitter spot on the All-SEC Tournament Team.Johnson hit .300 during the 
eight-game stretch away from home with seven RBI, including a .375 clip during the SEC Tour -
ney. 
“I’m just keeping things sim-
ple,” Johnson said. “Seeing the ball, hitting the ball. I don’t really think too much. I just hit it where it’s pitched.”
The junior southpaw also 
earned All-SEC Tournament team recognition as a pitcher for 
his outing against South Caroli-
na. Facing the defending national champion Gamecocks in an elim-ination game Friday, Johnson gave up just two earned runs in 
his first career complete game.
In May, Johnson has logged 21 
innings in three starts and posted 
a 1.29 ERA.
“I’m letting it all hang out,” 
Johnson said Friday. “I’m just throwing it with all I’ve got.”
Florida also received a boost 
from freshmen Justin Schafer and Casey Turgeon, who overcame their inexperience to garner se-lections to the All-SEC Tourna-
ment Team.
Turgeon batted .429 and 
knocked in four runs; Scha-
fer recorded a base hit in each 
game, and he totaled three RBI in 
Hoover, Ala.With solid production from 
the bottom of the lineup and a 2.38 ERA by the starting rotation, O’Sullivan believes the Gators’ best baseball lies ahead in the postseason.
“Our bullpen’s in good shape, 
we’ve been swinging the bat bet-ter,” O’Sullivan said. “I do like where we’re at right now.”

Allie Will’s run in the NCAA Women’s 
Tennis Singles Championships came to an 
end on Sunday when she fell to Stanford’s Nicole Gibbs in three sets.
Will came into the match ranked No. 1 
in the country but was unable to come back and defeat Gibbs after forcing a third set.
“Allie played her best match of the en-
tire tournament,” coach Roland Thornqvist said. “It was a great match against [Gibbs]. You have to give a lot of credit to [Gibbs], she found a way in the third set.”
Gibbs jumped out to a quick 3-0 lead 
and took the first set 6-2.
Will fought back in the second, break-
ing Gibbs twice and taking a 3-0 lead. Gibbs evened the match at 4-4, but Will broke back and was able to take the second set 6-4.
“Allie really made it tough and physi-
cal in the second set with some deep, big, heavy forehands in the second set and was able to wear [Gibbs] down a little,” Thorn-qvist said.
In the third set, Gibbs pushed ahead, 
getting an early break point.
Will wasn’t able to hold Gibbs off and 
fell behind 5-1. Will then won eight of the next 11 points and cut Gibbs’ lead to 5-3, but Gibbs put Will away and won the set 6-3.
“There was a pivotal game when 
[Gibbs] was up 3-1 and made it 4-1,” Thornqvist said.
“She found a way to get that game and 
that was the difference. 
If it had been 3-2, it 
would have been a dif-ferent match”
Will had dominated 
the singles competition until this match, winning her first four matches in straight sets.
In doubles play, Will and her playing 
partner, Sofie Oyen, fell in the first round to Baylor’s team of Ema Burgic and Nina Secerbegovic.
Will ends her junior season with a 26-3 
record, and a 109-13 mark for her career.Will advances to NCAA Singles 
semifinals, loses in three setsMEN’S GOLF
STAFF REPORT  
 
For the last 11 years the UF men’s golf 
team has made it to the NCAA Champi-
onships, and today they will mark their 12th consecutive appearance. Although the Gators finished runner-up at the NCAA East Regional, they are trying to stay focused to avoid getting distracted by the idea of win-ning the title. 
“Well I think anybody that’s going has to 
expect just to play as well as they can,” fresh-man J.D. Tomlinson said. “You can’t expect to win, but that’s the goal for everybody in the tournament.” 
Last season Florida finished first in both 
the Southeastern Conference Champion-ship and the NCAA Regionals. However, they fell apart in the NCAA Championships finishing 23rd. But at this year’s champion-ship in Pacific Palisades, Calif., Florida will be fielding three new players. 
Included in that group of first-year 
Gators is junior T.J. V ogel, who transferred to Florida from USC last summer. Accord-ing to Tomlinson, the team will be looking to V ogel for advice due to his prior experience on the course.
“I know where to miss, which is huge out 
there,” V ogel said. “The greens are going to be very fast and firm, so I know the correct spots on the greens where to miss. I know how certain putts break, and I just know where to be on that golf course because it’s very difficult.”
The Gators will play in three straight 
rounds, and then will advance to match play if they are one of the top-eight teams. 
Florida has had six top-three finishes in the last eight tournaments includ-ing two wins. 
Coach Buddy Alexan-
der hopes that the team’s constant improvement 
throughout the season will help them make it to the final day of play . 
“We knew this was going to be a rebuild-
ing year for us. We lost some great players, a first, second and third team All-American and replaced them with freshmen essen-tially ,” Alexander said. “But they’ve done a nice job, they’ve gotten a lot better and I’m proud of that.”Florida competing in 12th

Alexander
UF TennisMaegan Dennis /Alligator StaffO’Sullivan has been cautious with the 
No. 9 overall pick in the 2010 Major League 
Baseball First-Year Player Draft, but the 
excuses for Whitson’s struggles have worn 
thin.
Either Whitson is hiding an injury or 
he’s in a very dark place on the mound. 
Considering the care O’Sullivan has tak-
en with Whitson this season, the former seems unlikely. Therefore, I lean towards the latter.
Either way, it’s time for the Gators to 
find a new third starter, and the man for the job is Jonathon Crawford.In Whitson’s prolonged absence this 
season, Crawford has made 12 starts and 
thrown 62 innings.
His 3.34 ERA ranks second only to 
Hudson Randall for UF pitchers with at 
least six starts.
Compared head-to-head with Whitson, 
Crawford has been the better pitcher in 2012.
In roughly half as many innings, Whit-
son has 16 walks compared to Crawford’s 
22.
Whitson has six wild pitches compared 
to Crawford’s four, and Crawford has sur -
rendered one more extra-base hit.
In addition to his solid numbers, Craw-ford proved his worth in the SEC Tourna-
ment opener against Auburn on May 22. 
Crawford gave up just one unearned 
run in 5.2 innings and struck out nine bat-ters against the Tigers in a 6-1 Gators’ vic-tory.
Following Florida’s 8-6 loss to Van-
derbilt on Saturday, O’Sullivan summed up each of his starting pitchers in a few words.
Randall: “Hudson Randall has been re-
ally sharp for us all year long. Even when he’s not as sharp as he normally is, he still keeps you in the game.”
Brian Johnson: “Brian Johnson’s been 
throwing the ball as good — actually, he is throwing the ball as well as he ever has.”
Crawford: “Johnny Crawford’s been re-
ally, really good.”
Whitson: “Obviously, he’s been very 
good in the postseason.” 
While Whitson’s 1.89 postseason ERA 
from Florida’s College World Series run 
last year may tempt O’Sullivan to keep go-
ing to the Whitson well this time around, he shouldn’t.
Relying on Whitson to pitch any better 
than he did during the regular season is foolish.
Give Crawford the ball.Contact Joe Morgan at joemorgan@alliga-

Lanie Whittaker, Tony McQuay and Marquis Dendy will all be 
going to Des Moines, Iowa, to 
represent their team in two dif-ferent events.
“This meet is all about fin-
ishing in the top 12,” said coach Mike Holloway about the NCAA East Preliminary Round.
The weekend started off as 
Dendy qualified in the men’s 
long jump with a personal re-
cord. He then went on to have another record-breaking perfor -
mance on Friday as he qualified 
in the triple jump with a mark of 
15.55 meters.
“We knew Marquis was a dual 
threat when we recruited him, and he and Coach (Brian) O’Neal 
have been working very hard to 
see him develop through the sea-son,” Holloway said.“We don’t think he’s there yet, 
but we know his potential and I couldn’t be more pleased.”
Davis continued the momen-
tum on Friday by qualifying in the 100 meters, followed by the 200 meters on Saturday. 
“I’m so pleased with Darshay’s 
effort,” Holloway said.
“What a tremendous week-
end for her to qualify in both the 100 and 200. She’s really setting 
herself up for a special week at 
NCAAs.”
Dukes and McQuay qualified 
in the 4x400 meter relay on Sat-urday with a then-facility record-breaking time of 3:03.64. Earlier in the day, Dukes broke his per -
sonal record in the 200 meters to finish fifth and secured his first appearance at the NCAA Out-door Championships.
“I can’t say enough about De-
dric Dukes,” Holloway said.“In just his first season with 
us, having enrolled here in Janu-ary and just working with us for 
a few months, he’s qualified for 
NCAAs with a great race in the 200.”
On Friday, McQuay qualified 
in the 400 meters with a season 
best of 45.41. The reigning U.S. 
Champion will be hoping to grab his first NCAA title.
“Tony is Tony and he did what 
he always does, he competes,” Holloway said.
Like McQuay, Whittaker was 
able to qualify in both the 4x400 meter relay in addition to the 400 
meters. 
“With Lanie, I’m so proud 
of her making her first NCAA 
Outdoors on her own and can’t 
wait to see what she’ll do in Des 
Moines,” Holloway said.
The Gators will begin compe-
tition in Iowa on June 6 with the men looking to break their three-
year streak of top-three finishes 
and grab the title.
Florida has lost by a combined 
five points to three-time defend-
ing national champion Texas 
A&M in the last three seasons at the NCAA Outdoor Champion-ships.
