Members of the Micanopy Fire Rescue Department respond to a commercial building ﬁ  re outside of 
Café Risqué, 17035 SE County Road 234, after strong winds bent part of the building’s roof paneling on Monday. Employees reported seeing smoke coming from the roof of the building, but ﬁ  reﬁ  ghters responded in time to prevent a building-damaging ﬁ  re from starting. “That’d be my luck,” said a Café Risqué patron who asked to remain anonymous. “Getting a lap dance and a damn tornado hits.”

For Crystal Durham, not 
taking out a loan wasn’t an op-
tion.
Financial aid covered tuition 
and housing, but she had other 
expenses during her ﬁ  rst se-
mester at UF.
“I didn’t have any money to 
actually eat with,” she said.
She ended up taking out a 
loan for a little more than $2,000 during her ﬁ  rst semester at col-lege, and another for about $2,700 last spring.
Durham, a 21-year-old com-
puter engineering senior, is one of 7.4 million students who will beneﬁ  t from a bill approved 
by Congress on Friday that al-
lows the interest rate on student loans to remain at 3.4 percent instead of doubling.
In 2007, Congress made an 
agreement allowing the interest rate on Stafford loans to drop from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent over ﬁ  ve years.
If no additional agreement 
was reached this year, the loan rate would’ve returned to 6.8 percent effective Sunday . The deal will be renegotiated next summer.Congress passes 
bill to keep current loan interest rate

Gators could ﬁ  nd themselves on 
a better-connected campus soon.
On July 16, UF’s wireless net-
work will be updated so students 
can more efﬁ  ciently access the In-ternet on campus.
The Uniﬁ  ed Wireless Network is a part of the larger Uniﬁ  ed Net-work Project, which was developed to increase the efﬁ  ciency of Wi-Fi on UF’s campus, said Fedro Zazu-eta, the senior director of the Ofﬁ  ce of Academic Technology and a pro-fessor in the agricultural and bio-logical engineering department.
The network went into beta test-
ing on May 6, said Tracy Gale, com-munications manager for UF infor-mation technology.
The new network will require 
users to reconﬁ  gure their wireless devices, either automatically or manually, he said.
Zazueta said with the new net-
work, students will no longer need to repeatedly enter their GatorLink password to access UF Wi-Fi when moving from place to place on cam-pus.
Students will only need to log 
into the wireless network once. Then, students can access Wi-Fi anywhere on the university’s main campus, Zazueta said.
Now, when students log into a 
lone access point, their cache data is shared across multiple access points on campus. 
This means that when moving, a 
student’s device simply connects to the nearest access point.
However, if students do not 
have up-to-date security tools or ﬁ  rewall protection on their laptop or mobile device on July 16, they will be blocked from connecting to UF’s Wi-Fi, Gale said.

UF is ﬁ  nally getting what it asked for.
After an hour of haggling, storytelling and 
sidestepping on the last day of its meeting, the Board of Governors approved a 9 percent dif-
ferential tuition increase for UF.
A frustrated Gov . Tico Perez tried to keep 
the debate on track.As a former Student Body president, Perez 
knows tuition increases are a necessary evil.
“Fifteen years ago, [University of Central 
Florida] was known as ‘U Can’t Finish,’ be-cause you couldn’t get your classes,” he said.
He argued that “modest” tuition increases 
could alleviate that problem and help students 
graduate on time.
Although UF has raised tuition by the state 
maximum of 15 percent for the last ﬁ  ve years, UF President Bernie Machen announced to UF’s Board of Trustees earlier this month he would seek only a 9 percent increase this year to give struggling students a break.
Machen previously said a 15 percent in-
crease was necessary to help balance a $38.2 million bud-
get cut dealt by the state.
During the legislative 
session, Machen and Florida 
State University President Eric Barron lobbied Gov . 
Rick Scott to approve a bill that would have allowed UF and FSU to increase tu-
ition by more than 15 percent.Despite support from both universities’ 
Boards of Trustees and some members of the Board of Governors, the State University Sys-tem’s highest governing body, Scott vetoed it.
All 11 Florida public universities requested 
increases in differential tuition, which is an in-crease in base tuition set by the state according to the needs of each university.
At 9 percent, UF had the lowest request. 
Most other universities requested the maxi-mum of 15 percent.
The board was divided on the issue. UF’s Board of Trustees agree on a 9 percent tuition increaseSEE LOANS, PAGE 4

Four arrested after calling NC

SALISBURY, N.C. — Four

Pa. high school puts itself up for 
sale on eBay
LANGHORNE, Pa.  — For -
get magazine drives and candy 
sales. A cash-strapped high 
school near Philadelphia hopes 
to raise money by auctioning itself on eBay. The starting bid of just under $600,000 for The 
Learning Center in Langhorne, 
Pa., is designed to offset steep budget cuts. A tongue-in-cheek listing describes the alternative school for at-risk teens as “pre-
owned” and “slightly used.” 
The winner won’t own the 
facility, which is part of the Ne-
shaminy School District. But 
he or she will get a plethora 
of goodies, including a nam-ing opportunity, a free large pizza, a personalized school coffee mug and the chance to 
deliver a speech at graduation. 
Not to mention the satisfaction of “delivering an education to a group of kids who could re-
ally use it,” according to the ad. 
Neshaminy officials did not im-mediately return requests for comment Monday. 
The 7,000-student district 
has endured a pair of teacher strikes this year as the school board says it can’t afford to meet the union’s demands.
Learning Center Principal 
JoAnn Holland says she hopes the auction idea will draw the attention of a wealthy benefac-tor. Bidding ends Wednesday.
“I know it’s crazy,” Holland 
said in a statement. “But with the good The Learning Center does, it’s crazier not to do it.”
The idea came from recent 
graduate Casey Young, who knows a bit about unusual auc-tions: His dad, a writer, tried to sell their family on eBay in 
2003. The ad was eventually 
yanked because the company prohibits selling human beings, but the stunt received a lot of 
publicity.
“We did it as a lark,” father 
Steve Young told The Associ-
ated Press Monday. 
“Casey seems to have turned 
this into something that will re-sult in something positive.”

Naves arranged to meet

Reward offered for Montana 
truck stop dinosaur
MISSOULA, Mont. — The 
folks at Hi-Noon Petroleum in 
Montana have a new way to 
turn a dinosaur into gasoline.
They’re offering a $250 gas 
card for information leading 
to the safe return of Dino, a 
12-foot-long fiberglass Sinclair 
dinosaur that disappeared June 21 from the Crossroads Travel Center west of Mis-soula.
“We just wonder what 
happened to him,” Hi-Noon marketing manager Earl Allen said Friday. “It’s a little odd 
for him to just walk away.”
The 6-foot-tall green dino-
saur sat on a hill overlooking 
Interstate 90 for at least five years, Allen said, with occa-
sional appearances in Univer -
sity of Montana Homecoming 
parades.
“That was his home for a 
number of years,” Allen said.
Allen said taking the pre-
historic icon would have been a bit of a project.
“It’s not like you can just 
throw him in the back of a pickup,” he said.
Anyone with information 
on Dino’s whereabouts is 
asked to call Hi-Noon.

A flamingo chick is framed by adults as it flaps its wings at the Stone Zoo in 
Stoneham, Mass. on Monday.
The $6.7 billion deal will be financed 
by changes to federal pension insurance.
According to Tim Mason, president 
of Florida College Democrats, students 
with federal loans will save an average of $1,000 a year at the lower rate.
“It seems like Congress has realized 
that importance [of arriving at an agree-ment] and made it a priority,” he said.
The debate about whether to raise 
the interest rate was really a discussion about furthering higher education and helping students pay for their futures, Mason said.
“People ought not to have to mort-
gage their future to invest in it,” he said.Not all university students will be 
able to benefit from the loan deal.
A budget compromise passed last 
year included a provision disqualifying graduate students from receiving sub-sidized loans. Mason doesn’t anticipate movement on the issue.
Durham said she was relieved to hear 
about the loan rate staying at 3.4 percent for now.
She said if the rate doubled, she 
would worry about how to pay off her loans quickly. With the deal, she’ll pay at a steady rate, with less anxiety.
“There’s not as much of a sense of ur -
gency to pay it off,” she said.

Mouser lives in the lap of history , 
but he seems more preoccupied with 
his next meal. The cat naps through the summer surrounded by azaleas and in the shade of a 150-year-old 
house.
Most people in Gainesville prob-
ably haven’t met Mouser or heard 
of the Matheson Museum, where he spends his nights in an antique tool shed.
Struggling to preserve Alachua 
County’s history yet little known to local residents, the museum, located 
at 513 E. University Ave., works to 
make a bigger impact on the com-
munity .  
The Matheson includes the sec-
ond-oldest house in Gainesville, an exhibit hall with basement archives 
and a botanical garden.     
“Sometimes I think people 
drive right past us and don’t see us 
here,” said museum technician Allie Whalen, 24.
She said the Matheson is moving 
from small, private events to those reaching more people. The museum typically gets five to 10 visitors a 
day , often history buffs from out of 
town.       
Alicia Antone, the museum’s 
executive director, would like to in-crease those numbers.  
The museum is funded by mem-
berships, rentals and grants, she said.
City grants from the past two 
years allow the museum to give tours to schoolchildren.
“We do a lot of living history ,” 
she said.
The museum is hosting a theater 
program this month for kids to ex-plore the history of Alachua Coun-ty’s railroad, she said.
The museum’s second annual 
Civil War reenactment is scheduled for August, she said. The event will bring the 1864 Battle of Gainesville to life.
“I think it’s important to know 
where you’ve been,” Antone said.   
The museum’s current exhibit, 
“Pass It On,” highlights preserva-tion of information and architecture 
in Gainesville, she said.
Museum technician Odette Rive-
ra, 24, said she thinks it’s important 
to understand local history and feels the information should be more ac-cessible.
“If you’re interested in some-
thing close to home it might spark 
an interest in learning about places 
you’re not familiar with,” she said.
Some museum visitors are cu-
rious about the Matheson house, wanting to tour the rooms. Others come for information.
The Matheson Museum has a 
research library with books, periodi-cals, maps and photos from Gaines-
ville’s past.
Ryan Butler, a 21-year-old jour -
nalism senior, stopped by the mu-
seum to ask about archived UF foot-ball memorabilia. Butler, the sports editor at gamedayr.com, said photos of the items would add authenticity to the website.    
“I think any true Gator can defi-
nitely appreciate this stuff,” he said. “They just don’t know it’s here.”4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 3, 2012

They were first spotted in herds walking around campus 
during Summer A.
Newly admitted UF freshmen swiveled their heads while 
their lanyards swung across their chests and they surveyed 
their new home for the next four years, while parents walked 
proudly with them.
As Summer A ended, many students skipped town, which 
left a near-empty campus. And like a storm, waves of SUVs 
and minivans flooded Gainesville last week as parents helped settle their children in the dorms.
After a weeklong break, the upperclassmen returned to the 
city to find more cars on the road, families packed in restau-rants and teenagers decked from head to toe in Gator attire.These signs could only mean one thing: The freshmen inva-
sion had begun.
UF is anticipating about 2,200 new students taking classes 
this summer, said UF spokesman Steve Orlando.
After spending the week getting used to sharing a room 
with another person and showering in stalls, the time had come to begin exploring for the newest batch of UF students.
Freshmen emerged from their dorms Friday and Saturday 
night in packs. The new students trekked along Museum Road near Fraternity Row looking for a party, while others who live 
near West University Avenue wandered into Midtown. Some 
freshmen decided to take their own nighttime campus tours.
An upperclassman spotted the moving packs of baby Gators 
from his car and welcomed them to campus with some banter  on Museum Road Saturday night.
“Where is the party, freshmen?” he said.“I don’t know,” said a voice from the group. “How about 
you drive us there?”
Touché.Sunday was a day for preparation as freshmen mapped 
out where their classes will be on the first day and purchased school supplies. The weekend came and went, and Monday kicked off the start of Summer B.
Kristi Campbell said she had a stressful commute Monday 
morning from her apartment at Cabana Beach.
The 18-year-old health science freshman said she was scared 
her bus was not going to pick her up.
Campbell went to class wearing a UF shirt, like many fresh-
men on their first day.
“I almost didn’t wear Gator stuff just because I didn’t want 
to be called a freshman,” she said. “Now, I’m just proud.”

LOANS , from page 1Students will save $1,000 a yearUndergraduate fee will increase by $2 
“Today is about a family that has been go-
ing through a recession, and we have continu-
ously been beating on them,” said Gov. Mori Hosseini, who advocated for moderate tuition increases in the face of a sluggish economy.
Gov. John Temple, however, was of the 
opinion that Florida students don’t work hard enough and don’t need that break.
“I feel that there’s an entitlement mental-
ity in the state of Florida,” he said, referring to families that have the means to pay for college but still take Florida Bright Futures Scholar -
ships. “I think our focus is wrong.”
The board also approved the $2 per credit 
hour increase to the Capital Improvement Trust 
Fund fee for the expansion and renovation of 
the Reitz Union.
The fee, which hasn’t been raised in 30 years, 
will increase from $4.76 to $6.76 per credit hour for UF undergraduates.
UCF Student Body President and Board of 
Governors member Cortez Whatley said he saw no hesitation from Student Body presi-dents of other schools requesting an increase to their CITF fees.
The money from the fee goes directly into 
campus construction projects that benefit stu-dents, and Whatley said the fee is something students want.
Still, a few board members pushed back.Gov . Matt Carter maintained that raising 
any fees would put unnecessary strain on stu-dents, particularly those who have families to support.
“Now is not the time,” he said.All of the universities’ CITF funds passed in 
a block, 11 to four.
“I don’t think this one is that controversial,” 
Perez said just before the vote. “We’re talking about $2 per credit hour.”

The new UF&Shands Family Medicine at Main facility, 1707 N. Main Street, opened last week, replacing 
Family Medicine at Fourth Avenue. Development of the building began in September 2011 to replace the old center because it was becoming technologically outdated and had problems with plumbing.

In a close decision, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld 
the national health care plan pushed by President Ba-
rack Obama and Congressional Democrats.
Under the Affordable Care Act, U.S. citizens must 
purchase health insurance or face a penalty.
The law also lets states expand their Medicaid pro-
grams for sick and low-income Americans and sets up state exchanges for people to compare policies.
The Supreme Court upheld it after ruling the pen-
alty for not buying insurance is a tax.
The Court ruled that the mandate does not fall with-
in Congress’ power to regulate interstate commerce, a provision Chief Justice John Roberts required after that defense was presented.
“The Government’s logic would justify a manda-
tory purchase to solve almost any problem,” Roberts wrote in the Court’s majority opinion.
Florida and 25 other states filed the lawsuit.Gov. Rick Scott has said he will not expand Medic-
aid or set up a state health insurance exchange.
Allyson Hall, assistant professor and research direc-
tor for UF Center for Medicaid and the Uninsured, said she expects to see a push for Scott to reconsider.She said UF students benfit from adults younger 
than 26 being allowed to stay on their parents’ plans.
If a student’s parents don’t have health insurance, 
she said, he or she can shop for a policy or qualify for Medicare if the student is at up to 133 percent of the federal poverty line.
Hall said if Scott does not set up an exchange, the 
federal government will. She sees it as a step forward.
“I think it’s the best law they 
could’ve gotten,” she said.
UF College Democrats President 
Billy Farrell, a 20-year-old environ-mental science junior, called it “an 
amazing decision.”
But to 21-year-old political sci-
ence and telecommunication senior 
Katy Melchiorre, it means lost rights.
Melchiorre serves as chairwoman of the UF College 
Republicans. She and her peers expect negative effects and see the act as unconstitutional.
“I do not think it is the government’s place to re-
quire me to purchase a product or service and punish 
me with a higher tax if I don’t,” she said.

about a year ago, he said. The 
current building is not big 
enough to accommodate all of 
the students.
TutoringZone serves 5,000 
to 7,000 UF students each se-
mester, owner Matt Hintze 
said.
It’s in competition with 
Study Edge, another tutoring 
company in Gainesville.
In June 2011, nine Tutor -
ingZone tutors left to start Study Edge, according to Al-ligator archives.
Hintze said he feels he of-
fers competitive tutoring ser -
vices.
He said competition ben-
efits students by forcing both companies to provide better services.
Hintze tutors students in 
business classes about topics like competitive markets, fi-nancial planning and supply 
and demand.
“I think it’s critical that the 
students are always the win-
ners in this,” he said.
TutoringZone will stream 
its lessons live online, he said.
The study service is open-
ing recording studios in the New Horizons Computer 
Learning Centers.
“We are definitely going 
to continue to innovate with 
what we do online,” he said.
The company’s goal is to 
give students more learning tools online than they can get in a classroom setting, he said. 
However, students can still at-
tend lessons in person.
TutoringZone serves UF, 
Florida State University and 
Indiana University. Hintze mentioned plans to expand to another school in the fall but would not say which one.
The company’s expansion 
doesn’t include hiring more tutors, he said. It currently employs nine full-time tutors.
Hintze said students 
should try different services and then decide which service is best for them.  
“Competition’s good — 
everyone runs faster when they’re being chased,” he said.TutoringZone to move

Government in health 
care is nothing new
In a statement released after the Supreme Court’s ruling on 
the Affordable Care Act, President Obama’s signature health 
reform legislation, Republican South Carolina Sen. Jim DeM-
int said, “The Supreme Court may have failed to stop this gov-ernment takeover of health care, but the American people will not.”
Many Republicans and conservatives have expressed the 
sentiment that Obamacare constitutes a takeover of the health care industry by the government.
However, referring to Obamacare as a government takeover 
of health care completely glosses over all other previous inter-
ventions of government into the health care market.
In the 1940s, wage and price controls enacted by President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt made it nearly impossible for employers to lower or increase wages for their employees. Soon, employers 
were offering health beneﬁ  ts as a hiring incentive. In 1954, the Internal Revenue Service changed the tax code, making health 
beneﬁ  ts tax-free if provided by employers.
Of course, this change separated consumers from many of 
their subsequent health care decisions, limiting competition and 
market information while increasing costs.
In 1965, as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s Great So-
ciety, Congress created Medicare, a program providing health insurance to those 65 and older. Fast forward to today and the 
Trustees of Medicare have predicted that the program is “ex-
pected to remain solvent until 2024.” And that’s a conservative 
estimate.
The health care industry was further altered in 1973 by the 
Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) Act, signed by Presi-
dent Richard Nixon.
These HMOs were insurance companies designed to control 
rising costs in the health care market by acting as a liaison be-
tween patients and doctors to determine appropriate care.
Of course, this further removed patient and consumer choice 
while also mandating coverage of routine health care needs like 
primary care.
By mandating that companies with more than 25 employees 
offer an HMO option for health insurance, the number of work-ing Americans enrolled in managed care was more than 50 per-
cent by 1997.
Add to these interventions the creation of Medicaid, Medicare 
Part D and insurance mandates passed by state legislatures (for 
instance, Florida has more than 40 minimum individual cover-
age mandates), the health care market in the U.S. is far from free 
of government intervention.
Of course, all of these distortions have consequences, main-
ly in terms of rising costs. Senior research fellow Veronique de 
Rugy of the Mercatus Center found that “since 1984 annual price 
changes in medical care has exceed[ed] the average inﬂ  ation rate 
of all consumer prices in every year but one.”
In the end, Obamacare is simply a way for the government to 
try to ﬁ  x the problems it caused in the ﬁ  rst place.New health care bill deserves a chance
On June 28, everyone on Facebook suddenly be-
came U.S. Constitution wizards. Experts from the far right to the extreme left spouted their 
professional opinions and quoted the document like a Shakespearean scholar quotes Hamlet.
Did they all collectively earn a degree in American 
government? No, it was just that the Affordable Care 
Act, or better known as Obamacare, was upheld by the 
U.S. Supreme Court.
Many of these “constitutional scholars” fell back to 
the tried jab of calling our president “socialist,” or even worse, “communist.” I can’t help but laugh at the petty 
insults. As many know, socialism would endorse health 
care provided by a single payer, i.e. our government.
Unfortunately, hundreds of U.S. citizens haven’t re-
alized that Obamacare will not force the government to 
provide the masses with health insurance.
The Affordable Care Act enforces an individual man-
date. This means that every U.S. citizen needs to be cov-
ered by some form of health insurance. If citizens decide they do not want to purchase health insurance, despite 
being able to afford it, they will have to pay a tax.
This mandate is not socialism. This mandate just 
builds on the capitalist foundations upon which our 
country was created.
The health care system has been long overdue for a 
reform. The U.S. is one of the most powerful countries in the world, but severely lacks when it comes to caring for its citizens.
While we stomp around crying “Democracy for All!,” 
our health care ranks at a measly 37th worldwide. Our rank is not due to a lack of monetary funds. In 2010, the U.S. government spent nearly $2.6 trillion on health care. These numbers show that despite its best efforts, 
our country was in dire need of change.
Despite the necessity for reform, the issue of a gov-
ernment tax has gotten many in a constitutional rights ﬁ  t. I would like to explain 
why the tax should exist.
In our current health-
care system, 5 percent of patients account for 50 per-cent of all health care costs. When someone without 
insurance goes into a hos-
pital and receives care, someone with insurance 
ends up covering what the uninsured can’t pay. This tax would be the ﬁ  rst step to covering the shortfall that 
the uninsured create and would hopefully lead to a bal-
anced system.
There are individuals who don’t feel they need to ac-
count for others and show this through their distaste 
for social services. This is one social service that works 
in your favor. If you purchase health care and encour-age others to do the same, you will end up taking care of yourself. If you don’t purchase health care, you will end up allowing someone else to cover what you can’t 
immediately afford.
I’m also excited to be able to stay on my parents’ in-
surance until I’m 26. I’m excited I will never have to 
worry about the affordability of my medical needs. I be-
lieve this is the start to a healthier United States.
I encourage you to look at the positive aspect of the 
health care bill  before you promise to move to Canada. 
Our country is still so young and yet the unhappiness and debt continues.
There are many struggles and battles we need to 
ﬁ  ght. Is it really worth exhausting our energies on an act that would provide health care for everyone? I believe our willpower is better used toward the greater battles 
that are ahead of us.

A Gator Goes
As I end my time at UF, I would like to say the 
following words to my fellow Gainesvillians:
Thank you for being gentle with my fragile be-
ginning and gracefully accepting my exit. Thank 
you for giving me the music to twirl to late into the 
night. Thank you for showing me more evidence 
in support of an “It takes all kinds of people” phi-losophy. Thank you for letting me sit next to people who also don’t understand musical key every fall in The Swamp. Thank you for teaching me to be my own No. 1. Thank you for those summer nights that are too blurry to attempt to describe.
There is a lot I wish I could say I had done with 
my time here, but I have no regrets. Not even that 
OKCupid date with Kevin the “musician.” I’m 
not angry with anyone from my time here. I real-ized long ago that it wasn’t simply fair to claim a grudge on any ground.
It’s because of my time here that I’ve even got-
ten to see from the shoulders of giants and gained enough courage to write these words: My Title Town, you will forever be in my heart and in my family.
Farewell.

Have you noticed an archery theme in popular movies 
this year? From “The Hunger Games” to “The Aveng-ers,” bows and arrows are all the rage.
Now, take a look at Pixar’s “Brave.”It marks the film company’s first fairytale female protagonist 
and period piece. The main character, Merida, must undo a curse using her skill sets: bravery and archery.
I’m ecstatic that there’s finally an animated female lead char -
acter who kicks some butt while caring about her family. It’s so important for young girls to have a trailblazer they can look up to; independence and security are crucial traits to develop.
Film critics don’t feel the same way about Merida, however.Welcome to PopWatch, the pop culture blog of “Entertain-
ment Weekly.”
Writer/blogger Adam Markovitz published a piece titled 
“Could the heroine of Pixar’s ‘Brave’ be gay?” on June 24.
I’m not opposed to the idea of a gay character in a lead role, 
but let’s analyze his evidence to see where he’s coming from.
Merida “bristles at the traditional gender roles that she’s 
expected to play: the demure daughter, the obedient fiancée.” She enjoys “archery and rock climbing” and “hates the prospect of marriage — at least, to any of the three oafish clansmen that compete for her hand — enough to run away from home and put her own mother’s life at risk.”
The first time I read his article I had to put my head down on 
my desk and remember proper breathing techniques.
So, when a girl doesn’t want to be forced into marriage and 
enjoys outdoor activities, that means she must be a lesbian?
If Merida had actually ever expressed an attraction to women, 
then I might be more OK with Markovitz’s opinion. But all she did was buck traditional, stereotypical gender roles.
Sexual orientation doesn’t (and 
shouldn’t) matter. Chris Heller, an as-sociate editor for “The Atlantic,” listed these five ways to think about Merida’s sexuality (or lack thereof):
“Brave” is about a daughter-mother 
relationship, and sexuality would dis-tract from developments here.
She is gay , and “Brave” is Pixar’s subversive way to depict 
a lesbian.
Merida is a straight girl who likes to run, shoot and fight.She’s neither gay nor straight; she’s asexual. (This would be 
just as sexually radical — if not more so — than making Merida a lesbian.) The ambiguity is itself a message.
If Pixar wanted Merida to be more of an example for a partic-
ular cause, I’m sure it would’ve done so in a more obvious way.
“Ultimately , it doesn’t matter if Merida could be interpreted 
as gay ,” Markovitz said. “What’s most exciting is that she brings a new free-thinking attitude to the slightly staid club of Disney princesses, one that’s sure to appeal...to anyone who ever chal-lenged an identity that was pre-assigned to them.”
Merida, at the very least, is a role model for people who need 
to stand up for themselves. Perhaps it was good enough that the film made people open a sexual dialogue and a new discussion.
“At its core,” Heller said, “’Brave’ preaches acceptance.”Sami Main is a journalism senior at UF . Her column appears on 
Tuesdays.‘Brave’ is about acceptance, not sexualityColumn

When Joey Ziebelman woke up for work 
Wednesday morning, it was the first time 
he’d seen the sun in five days.
He was trapped inside his home in Jack-
sonville while Tropical Storm Debby formed in the Gulf of Mexico on June 23. On June 26, he drove to Gainesville with his wind-shield wipers on.
Like Ziebelman, many Gainesville resi-
dents and UF students didn’t fear the storm’s 60 mile-per-hour winds would put them in danger. Instead, about a foot of rainfall in several areas of the city caused concern.Weak steering currents kept Tropical 
Storm Debby from traveling along its origi-nal forecasted path toward Texas, according to the National Weather Service. Instead, it idled in the northeast Gulf of Mexico, result-ing in a continuous downpour in Gainesville during the first half of the week.
One measuring station in southeast 
Gainesville recorded 12.32 inches of rain from June 23 to June 26, according to the National Weather Service. On average, the city receives 7.12 inches of rainfall  during June.
Megan Wetherington, a hydrologist with 
the Suwannee River Water Management District, called the storm a “500-year rain-fall event.”
“It has a 0.2 percent chance of occurring 
in any year,” she said.
The heavy rain caused the Santa Fe River 
to rise 11 feet in one week. A measuring station near Fort White recorded the river peaking at 32.24 feet Sunday; the flood stage is 24 feet.
Wetherington, who works in Live Oak, 
said her car became trapped in her office parking lot for days after low-lying areas flooded. She said she still felt lucky because the office building didn’t flood.
“If the river hadn’t been so low, it would 
have been significantly worse.” she said. “And it’s pretty bad now.”Though the Santa Fe River hit its third-
highest peak since 1906, Wetherington pre-dicted the rain from Tropical Storm Debby wouldn’t improve dangerously low ground-water levels by more than a few inches.
“It’s not a dramatic improvement by any 
means,” Wetherington said. “But it’s a good start.”
She estimated it would take weeks for 
the rivers to return to normal levels, but it could be below flood stage as soon as next week.
For now, Alachua County has advised 
people to avoid swimming, tubing, kayak-ing or canoeing on the stretch of river bor -
dering Alachua County from O’Leno Rise west to Poe Springs. Several businesses, such as Ginnie Springs Outdoors, have dis-continued their water activities until further notice.SHELBY WEBB

There were splashes of bright 
paint in the lobby, each wall beam-
ing a different color. The DJ was spinning popular hip-hop songs as the smoothie machine buzzed in the 
background.
While the description fits a 
trendy eatery , this is the sight that 
greets employees of Student Maid almost every day.
“You know how you have the 
cool mom?” said Amanda Baltzegar, a 22-year-old human resources as-sistant at Student Maid. “We want 
to be the cool job.”
More UF students are deciding 
to plant entrepreneurial roots in 
Gainesville — building companies with the readily available student work force.
Four companies — Park Smooth, 
Student Maid, Pledge 5 and Study Edge — are all at different stages of 
maturity and provide case studies 
in how local student companies are benefiting from the endless supply of student workers.
Another benefit of starting a busi-
ness in Gainesville is the Santa Fe Center for Innovation and Economic Development, which has housed or assisted more than 80 new business-es. About 10 of its 40 current busi-nesses started by students or recent graduates.
CIED can provide startups with 
offices, classes and networking op-
portunities.
Bill Dorman, an entrepreneur-
in-residence at CIED, said although 
the businesses the center assists are eclectic, they tend to face the same problems.
“We’ve found common threads 
in their conversations,” Dorman said. “Not about their particular businesses, but about the state of their businesses, expenses and com-mon problems all small businesses face.”
To help the startups find solu-
tions, CIED hosts a weekly meeting with all of the businesses it’s sup-
porting. The meetings are similar 
to what you would expect to find at Weight Watchers — business own-ers discuss what’s working for them and what problems they’re facing and ask other businesses for advice.Matt Carroll, a 2012 UF graduate 
and CEO of Park Smooth, said the networking and advice he gets is al-most as valuable as having his own 
office in CIED.
“You get a lot of guidance,” he 
said. “The whole package is great.”
Park Smooth got its start in CIED 
in March.
Carroll described his website 
as an eBay for Gainesville parking, 
where residents with extra park-ing spaces can post availability and 
prices and be matched with inter -
ested drivers.
Users can also reserve parking 
spaces, including spaces in down-
town and midtown, in advance.
Right now, Park Smooth em-
ploys three UF graduates and two UF students.
Carroll said one major benefit of 
hiring students is that they are will-ing to work for a lower salary than a seasoned professional.
“They want a high salary, ben-
efits and things we can’t provide right now as a startup,” he said of more experienced workers.
However, hiring students does 
bring some challenges.Student Maid, which CIED also 
assisted, relies solely on students for its cleaning services.
The company sometimes has 
trouble with scheduling, especially around school breaks and finals.
Baltzegar said that although it can 
be tricky for some students to work at Student Maid around school and extracurricular activities, the compa-ny only hires students with at least a 3.5 GPA to ensure they are able to balance their schedules.  
“We understand that school 
comes first,” she said.
The 3.5 GPA not only reassures 
the managers at Student Maid, but also provides peace of mind to cli-ents who have their houses cleaned.
Elaina Nichols, general manager, 
said maid services typically don’t have good reputations. People often 
assume maids could steal valuables 
or damage their homes. But with students, clients tend to worry less.
“They’re more trustworthy ,” she 
said. “They’ll build personal rela-tionships with clients, and the client will want to help the students.”
Student Maid wants to help, too. 
They organize, participate in and donate to local charity events like Family Fun and Safety Expo, ben-efiting Big Brothers Big Sisters.
While Student Maid prides itself 
on its philanthropic efforts, another local student-run company makes a business out of it.
Pledge 5, best known for organiz-
ing Gator Stompin’, encourages stu-dents to give back to the community , sometimes with social incentives.
Jason Bowman, founder and 
director of Pledge 5 and 2010 UF 
Ph.D. graduate, said the nonprofit 
organization gets people to donate time, old clothes and blood, and also offers opportunities to educate the community through awareness campaigns and free testing.
“Pledge 5 gets people in the habit 
of giving back and does it in a man-ageable way,” he said.
In exchange for donations, Bow-
man said those who give will receive free or reduced prices on admission to social events. If you volunteer for five hours prior to Gator Stompin’, you’ll get a free ticket to the bar crawl.
All of the work, including pro-
motion, marketing, event organiz-ing, website design, advertising and public relations, is handled by about four staff members, almost all of whom are students, and five to 10 
student interns.
Bowman said he built his busi-
ness model around the easy access 
to interns and has been impressed with their abilities and work ethic.
“At the end of the day , we have 
some of the brightest minds in the nation,” he said. “They really can make a difference.”
Creating those bright minds can 
take four years of classes, which can prove a challenge for some stu-dents.
Though the classroom can lack 
in-depth explanations of complex subjects, Study Edge, a tutoring company , hopes to provide students with a better understanding of the 
material.
What started as study sessions 
held at the Hillel last summer be-
came a staple for UF students and expanded to Florida State Univer -
sity and the University of Georgia.
“The word ‘tutor’ has a bad con-
notation to it,” said Nicole Wampole, the chief operating officer. “It’s not 
easy to make it fun, which is why we 
hire young, fresh experts.”
Many of the “study experts” are 
graduate students, and two decided against medical school to continue teaching instead. Wampole, a 2009 UF marketing graduate, said Study Edge finds most of its teachers through the University Athletic As-
sociation’s tutoring programs.
“We want to give all students the 
opportunity to have what the UAA 
gives to athletes,” said Brittney Aus-tin, a UF senior and director of mar -
keting for Study Edge.
Undergraduate students also 
work to facilitate the behind-the-scenes work like public relations, 
scheduling and other office tasks.
Wampole said 95 percent of the 
company’s undergraduate employ-
ees are enrolled in the study classes and provide honest feedback.
The undergraduates are also bet-
ter at reaching out to other students.
“It helps me market to students 
because I am a student,” Austin 
said. “I don’t think a 50-year-old 
could connect with my interests.”

 Alligator Staff Writer
   
 For sprinter Jeff Demps, this year has been about making 
sacriﬁ  ces for the 2012 Summer Olympics.
It started about seven months ago when Demps an-
nounced that he was forgoing a career in the NFL to focus 
on earning a spot on Team USA as well as a professional 
career. 
  Then at the NCAA Outdoor Championships, he sat out 
of the ﬁ  nals because of a tweaked hamstring, which he 
didn’t want to injure further with the Olympic trials only 
two weeks after that meet. 
  Unfortunately for Demps, he is not one of the four cur-
rent and former Gators track and ﬁ  eld athletes who will be 
traveling to London for Team USA.
  Despite not making the team, Demps had arguably the 
strongest outing of any collegiate competitor in the 100 me-
ters. He ﬁ  nished fourth overall in the semiﬁ  nals with a time 
of 10.10, making him the only collegian to advance to the ﬁ  nals. In the ﬁ  nals he ﬁ  nished seventh overall with a time of 10.27.
  Florida will have four current and former track and ﬁ  eld 
Gators competing in London for Team USA. Junior Tony McQuay and Will Claye were the ﬁ  rst two to qualify.
  McQuay won the silver medalist honors at the Olympic 
Trials in the 400 meters, with a new personal record of 44.49. 
The three-time NCAA Champion beat his previous record 
of 44.58, which he set at the outdoor championships. 
  Like McQuay, Claye also grabbed the silver medalist 
honors at the trials. His leap of 8.23m/27 in the long jump 
gave him his ﬁ  rst spot on Team USA.

THE ALLIGATOR AWARDS
  As a part of The Alligator Awards recog-
nizing the best in UF athletics during the 2011-12 athletic season, columnists Joe 
Morgan and Corey McCall will debate two of the ﬁ  ve nominees in each week’s category. Vote for the 
winner online at alligatorSports.org.
  Corey: In retrospect, UF athletics put forth 
a historic year: the women’s lacrosse team 
making its ﬁ  rst-ever Final Four appearance, the men’s track and ﬁ  eld squad securing the program’s ﬁ  rst outdoor champi-onship and John Brantley graduat-ing, to name a few. 
But who were the 
best performers, who formed the Dynamic Duo, the Jordan and Pippen, the Cruise and Holmes? In a university rid-dled with talent, I say , hands down, Lauren Embree and Joanna Mather proved top 
of the class. The duo 
led the women’s ten-nis team to its second straight national title, 
and third-straight Southeastern Conference regular season and tournament titles, nuff’ said — cue dropped mic.
  Joe: Cruise and Holmes? Corey , you may 
have just cost yourself this version of The Rally right there. Before we simply award 
Embree and Mather the crown in the wake 
of the Gators women’s tennis squad’s second consecutive championship, look at the rest of the team. Soﬁ  e Oyen and Allie Will proved

FOR TEAM USA
  ADAM PINCUS
 Alligator Writer
   
 Rodney Adams wakes up every 
morning at 6:30 ready to take the 
ﬁ  eld for two-a-days.
  The Florida wide receiver com-
mit is spending the summer train-
ing and competing in Austin, Texas, 
representing Team USA for the IFAF Under-19 World Championship.  The top-ranked USA squad rout-
ed eighth-seeded American Samoa 27-6 in the opening round Saturday. Adams takes on No. 5 seed Austria in the semiﬁ  nals July 4 at 9 p.m.
  A self-described quiet guy , the 
four-star prospect is not shy about his goals.
  “My dream is to be very success-
ful in college, come out with my de-gree and be a top-10 draft pick,” he said.
  Adams couldn’t be happier for 
the opportunity of suiting up for 
the Gators a few hours from his St. Petersburg, Fla., home. The chance 
for his family to watch every home game in the Swamp was a selling point for Florida.
  “I’m very excited — going to a 
great school, great coaching staff, and they produce great players to the NFL,” Adams said. “It’s a very 
cool honor for me to be going to the 
University of Florida.”
  Adams plans on visiting 
Gainesville again for the annual Fri-day Night Lights camp July 27.
  Tight ends coach Derek Lewis 
and wide receivers coach Aubrey Hill are keeping in touch with the 6-foot-1, 166-pound playmaker.
  Since the summer started, Ad-
ams said no other school has been in contact with him as much as Florida. 
The Army All-American does hold 
10 offers from schools including Ala-bama and Florida State.
  Football almost didn’t happen 
for the player who calls himself “ex-plosive.”
  “When I was younger, my main 
sport was basketball until my dad forced me to play football,” Adams 
said. “After my ﬁ  rst year of playing football, I just started loving it more 
than basketball.”
  His love for the hardwood still 
exists today . The receiver with a 40.5-inch vertical jump plays basket-ball whenever he can.
  Adams, a LeBron James fan, took 
to heart how the three-time NBA 
MVP clinched his ﬁ  rst champion-
ship in June.
  “No one can bring you down,” 
he said. “Keep doing what you do best and follow your goals. Like [Robert Grifﬁ  n III] said, ‘Go catch your dream.’”

WASHINGTON — Bradley Beal’s birth-
day wish came true.
On the day he turned 19, the 6-foot-4 
guard from Florida was drafted Thurs-
day night as the third overall pick by the Washington Wizards, a franchise looking for an outside shooter and a return to the 
postseason.
During his freshman campaign, Beal 
averaged 14.8 points and 6.7 rebounds 
for the Gators last season. Now he joins a backcourt headlined by John Wall, the No. 
1 overall selection in the 2010 draft.
After working out for the Wizards on 
their home turf earlier this month, Beal 
said he felt the organization and the city 
“was the right place for me.” Before he left 
town, he implored Wizards coach Randy 
Wittman to have the team draft him. Two 
weeks later, Beal’s “prayers were an-
swered.”
“This is by far the best birthday that I’ve 
ever had,” Beal said on a conference call with local media. “This really beats all the presents my mom and dad ever got me.”
His outside scoring is welcomed by the 
retooling Wizards, who finished this past season with a 20-46 record, though a trade deadline deal for Nene sparked improve-
ment. Washington closed the season on a 
six-game winning streak, providing en-couragement for a franchise that missed the playoffs for a fourth straight cam-paign.
Team owner Ted Leonsis has no interest 
running the streak to five.
“I don’t want to be in the lottery any-
more,” Wizards owner Ted Leonsis said 
during a press conference before the draft. 
“I would find that unacceptable.”Considered one of the premier perim-
eter shooters in the draft, Beal made 8 of 19 attempts from beyond the arc during the 
NCAA tournament. Last season the Wiz-
ards ranked 28th in the NBA from beyond the arc, shooting 32 percent.
“We had some real good choices there - 
but yes, we were hoping he would fall to three,” Wizards President Ernie Grunfeld said of Beal.
“He can stretch the defense, is a very 
good three-point shooter and he knows how to play the game.”
With its second-round selection, the 
No. 32 overall pick, Washington drafted Tomas Satoransky of the Czech Republic. The 6-foot-7 combo guard spent the past three seasons playing for Cajasol Sevilla in the Spanish ACB and averaged 4.8 points 
in 34 games during the 2011-12 campaign.
The third consecutive Southeastern 
Conference freshman selected in the first 
three picks, Beal was also the Wizards third lottery selection in three seasons, fol-
lowing Wall and another Czech product 
Jan Vesely, the No. 6 overall pick in 2011.
Washington improved its frontcourt 
depth earlier this month, trading for center 
Emeka Okafor and forward Trevor Ariza. 
Add in Beal and expected improvement from those already on the roster and Wall has his owner’s back regarding that no more being in the lottery thing.
“Three years in a row is enough,” Wall 
said. “You have to find a way to get better individually as a team and I think we’re making the right steps.
Wall led the Wizards with 16.3 points 
and 8.0 assists last season, but connected on only 7.1 percent (3 of 42) of his 3-point attempts. The lightning quick point guard remains the team’s centerpiece entering 
his third professional season. Now he has 
more shooting help.
“I think he’s a great pick,” Wall said. “So 
many people wanted to get to him and I’m 
glad that we had the opportunity to pick 
him. He’s somebody that can make shots and he helps spread the court for you.”
Jordan Crawford rounds out the ex-
pected three-guard rotation. The Wizards 
second-leading scorer last season with 14.7 
points, Crawford took over the starting guard role opposite Wall following Nick Young’s trade to the Los Angeles Clippers 
as part of the deal for Nene.
Beal’s take on the future pairing shows 
he’s already in harmony with Wall.
Wall “plays fast and that’s the style of 
play I love to play,” Beal said. “Hopefully, I can be able to create space for him, be a 
decoy at times and hopefully be able to knockdown some shots.”14, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 3, 2012

� COACHES CAN MESSAGE 
RECRUITS DURING SUMMER
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
Kentucky’s outspoken men’s 
basketball coach John Calipari has 
long championed the talent and depth in the Southeastern Confer -
ence — even when the NCAA tour -
nament selection committee didn’t share his optimism.
And he’s even more bullish 
about the league’s future now that Missouri and Texas A&M have made the switch from the Big 12 to the SEC.
“Think about what happens 
now,” Calipari said during Mon-
day’s summer teleconference. 
“Now we start moving up a notch in where everybody is. I think sev-en teams in our league — half of our league — is going to be in the NCAA tournament. That’s what I believe.”
Perhaps that is overly optimistic. 
There’s little doubt, however, that 
Missouri and Texas A&M add some hardwood flavor to the football-cra-
zy SEC, which has been considered top-heavy on the basketball court during recent years.
Kentucky finished with a 38-2 re-
cord last season and won its eighth national championship, while Flor -
ida coach Billy Donovan has usu-ally kept the Gators in the national 
spotlight after back-to-back nation-
al titles in 2006 and ‘07.
But outside of those two pro-
grams, the SEC’s national repu-tation is tepid. Only four teams (Kentucky, Florida, Vanderbilt and Alabama) made the NCAA tourna-ment last year.
That’s where Missouri and Texas 
A&M can help. The Tigers, in par -
ticular, has a national pedigree in basketball that few programs in the SEC can boast. Texas A&M has also been good in recent seasons, mak-ing six straight NCAA tournaments before a down year in 2012.
Missouri figures to be competi-
tive immediately in the SEC and should also have one of the league’s best home-court advantages — 
15,000-seat Mizzou Arena.“We have a really good tradition 
here and we’re excited about what 
we bring to the table,” Missouri coach Frank Haith said. “I think that we have a really good fan base, a great arena and hopefully we’ll be very competitive in the league.”
While Missouri leaves behind 
some traditional rivalries — most 
notably its heated home-and-home 
series against Kansas each season 
— Haith said he’s 
intrigued by the possibilities in the SEC.
“We leave one 
power conference for another and 
I’m excited about 
the opportuni-ty,” Haith said. 
“I think being in the Southeastern Conference — obviously Mizzou is a national brand and we can recruit nationally — but I think there’s no question it does open some doors in the Southeast from a recruiting standpoint.”
The addition of Missouri and 
Texas A&M isn’t the only issue for the SEC, which will officially admit the two universities on July 1. Other topics on the summer teleconfer -
ence:
— The NCAA’s new rule 
changes for basketball were widely praised by the league’s coaches. The governing body de-regulated contact with recruits during the 
summer months, allowing for un-
limited calls and text messages.
“Any time you open up the lines 
of communication, that’s a healthy thing,” Florida coach Billy Dono-van said.
The NCAA also now allows 
coaches to spend eight hours per week on the court with players en-
rolled in summer school. For new 
coaches in the league like South Carolina’s Frank Martin, Missis-sippi State’s Rick Ray and LSU’s Johnny Jones, it’s allowed a little extra time to get familiar with per -
sonnel.
— Kentucky begins its quest for 
a second-straight national champi-onship with an almost completely overhauled roster. Stars from last 
year’s team — including Anthony Davis, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, 
Marquis Teague, Terrence Jones and Doron Lamb — have left for the NBA, but Calipari has reload-ed with some of the nation’s most highly regarded freshmen, includ-ing Nerlens Noel, Alex Poythress, Archie Goodwin and Willie Cauley.
“You won’t believe this, but we’re 
going to be really young,” Calipari deadpanned. “... What I’ll tell you is, I like my team. I think we’ve got good players, good kids.”
— Some SEC coaches believe 
the escalating number of Division I basketball transfers needs to be addressed. NCAA president Mark Emmert recently said that 40 per -
cent of all Division I players trans-fer before their junior season, the highest percentage of any sport.
Both South Carolina’s Martin 
and Auburn coach Tony Barbee said the problem begins before col-lege, when elite players often trans-fer between high schools and AAU programs. Barbee said a culture has been formed that allows players to “run from their problems” when 
there is adversity.
SEC men’s basketball coaches talk new members, rule changes“This is by far the best birthday 
I’ve ever had.”

Taylor edges former teammate Claye by .08 meters in triple jump
Claye will also be represent-
ing the U.S. in the triple jump. He 
used a personal best of 17.55m/57-7 inches to claim the silver once 
again.
In the triple jump, Claye was 
edged out of first by his former 
teammate, Christian Taylor. 
Taylor’s first attempt in the fi-
nals solidified his spot on the team. 
He used a season’s best mark of 
17.63m/57-10.5 inches. Both Tay-
lor and Claye jumped above the 
Olympic “A” standard mark of 17.20m/56-5.25.
The final Gator athlete to earn a 
trip to London was Kerron Clement 
in the 400-meter hurdles. The four-
time World Champion grabbed the third and final spot for the event 
with a time of 48.89.
Clement is the only former 
Gator to be making his second trip 
to the Olympics this year.
In 2008, he won the silver med-
al for Team USA in the 400-meter hurdles as well as a gold medal 
as a member of the men’s 4x400-
meter relay.
In addition to the four who will 
be competing for the U.S., Gen-evieve LaCaze and Kemal Mesic 
have also earned a trip to Lon-
don. LaCaze will be representing 
Australia in the steeplechase, and 
Mesic will be representing Bosnia 
in shot put.

just as valuable to Florida’s title run. Meanwhile, Billy Dono-
van’s backcourt proved a terrific tandem once again in 2011-12. Guided by the leadership of Erving Walker and Kenny Boyn-ton, the Gators advanced to their second straight Elite Eight ap-pearance in March. Now that’s an argument worth its weight 
in stolen tacos.
Corey: That would be a hefty weight considering it ended 
up costing him $301. But the fact that Walker and Boynton’s 
style would be a better fit in the WNBA — layups upon layups of impeccable form — makes that a clown argument, bro. On 
the other hand, Mather and Embree proved week in and week out that they were individually some of the best players in the country with national rankings of ninth and 21st, respectively . As double partners, their record speaks for itself. During the 
2011-12 season, they went a combined 24-1 as the No. 22 dou-
bles team in the country. Their career record now stands at 49-2, solidifying them as one of the best duos in the history of UF athletics.
Joe: As great as Mather and Embree have been both togeth-
er and apart, Boynton and Walker have helped engineer the resurrection of Florida basketball. After three up-and-down seasons following back-to-back national championships, the Gators have notched two straight trips to the Elite Eight largely 
on the strength of their guard play . Walker led UF in scoring 
(14.6 points per game) in 2010-11, and Boynton carried the of-fensive load in 2011-12 with 15.9 points per contest. However, they don’t just shoot. This year, the duo combined for a 2.1 as-sist-to-turnover ratio — a marked improvement from their 1.6 mark in 2010-11. Not only did these small soldiers give Florida steady experience, but they improved in their duties running an efficient offense. They may not have brought home a na-tional title, but they did their damnedest.
Corey: Well that just wasn’t enough; Florida had its fair 
share of role players on that team. And when it came time to step up in the tournament, Bradley Beal, the player with the 
least amount of experience, was the only one to do so — Beal 
led the team in five categories, including rebounds, scoring and three-point field-goal percentage. Embree and Mather, howev-er, were consistent enough to continue their success for three straight years and in two roads to a national championship. Oh, and did I mention Embree owned a 22-2 singles record this year? Mather’s 21-2 record wasn’t too shabby either. Together they were responsible for two singles points in the majority of the matches. And every time one of the other two doubles team scratched out a victory, that put the duo responsible for three of the five possible dual match points, guaranteeing a UF win.
Joe: Continuing to argue for my side would be the equivalent 
of convincing Walt Disney Studios that John Carter 2 is a worthy 
investment — it’s a horrid waste of time. The men’s basketball 
team has accomplished an impressive feat with back-to-back 
trips to the Elite Eight. However, Boynton and Walker’s back-court partnership yielded two fewer national championships than the Embree-Mather tandem. Gators women’s tennis is a national powerhouse, and the Embree-Mather duo is largely responsible for that reputation.
