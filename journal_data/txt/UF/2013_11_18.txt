COLUMBIA, S.C. — Down to 
its third-string quarterback and 
dealing with injuries to several other critical players, Florida had plenty of reasons to roll over Sat-urday night against No. 10 South Carolina. 
The Gators entered as heavy 
underdogs, had been eliminated from Southeastern Conference Eastern Division contention and  were already on the verge of ﬁ  n-ishing the season without making a bowl appearance for the ﬁ  rst time since 1990. 
Still, they fought. Yet again, 
they came up short. 
Playing in front of 83,853 fans 
inside Williams-Brice Stadium, the Gators let a late fourth-quarter lead and an opportunity for a dramatic upset slip away in a 19-14 loss to the Gamecocks. 
“We followed the script in what 
we felt we needed to do to win the game,” coach Will Muschamp said. 
“Extremely proud of the play-
ers who continue to ﬁ  ght in the game. There’s a lot of negativity out there, and these guys pulled together and showed you some-thing.”
With starting quarterback Tyler 
Murphy out for the game due to an injured shoulder, Florida (4-6, 3-5 SEC) turned to its third quar-terback of the season — redshirt freshman Skyler Mornhinweg, who was making his ﬁ  rst career start. 
With Mornhinweg under cen-
ter, the Gators employed a very clear plan: run, run and run some more, while depending on their defense to limit the Gamecocks (8-2, 6-2 SEC) offensively.
The strategy worked surpris-
ingly well in the ﬁ  rst half. 
Kelvin Taylor enjoyed a break-
out performance prior to halftime, ripping off a pair of long touch-down runs to ignite the UF offense. Defensively, Florida’s under-manned unit returned to its early season brilliance by pressuring South Carolina quarterback Con-nor Shaw and limiting big plays. 
Shaw, who ﬁ  nished the game 
14-of-28 passing for 213 yards and one touchdown, missed several throws down the ﬁ  eld, while run-ning back Mike Davis was held in check as Florida went into halftime leading 14-6. 
“That’s what we expected,” 
Mornhinweg said. 
“We expect that we are going 
to win, be physical and dominate every game.”

Last week, UF students were given 
the choice to opt in to a new email ser-
vice and a host of new technology.
The updated email service is avail-
able now for students, and includes an expanded 25 gigabytes of storage, an in-tegrated calendar function and access to a global address book, said Tracy Gale, communications manager for UF Infor-mation Technology. 
Gale said she expects the transition to 
be smooth because so many students are already comfortable with multiple email accounts. 
The new service has been tested on 
a variety of mobile devices, she said, in-cluding iPhone, Android and Windows devices. 
The universal address book is some-
thing Gale said she believes will be the greatest asset for students. Instead of searching for classmates’ and professors’ UF starts updating emailCRIME

Following a daylong search, Gainesville 
Police arrested a man Sunday after it was 
reported that he shot and killed his preg-nant ex-girlfriend.
Ofﬁ  cers arrested 33-year-old Alvin G. 
Thomas at Budget Inn, 4401 SW 13th St., at about 7 p.m. Sunday, said GPD spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias in a news release.
A little more than 24 hours earlier, wit-
nesses said they saw Thomas arguing with Caitlin A. Albritton, the mother of his 9-month-old daughter, at the Village Green Apartments, Tobias said. 
Police responded to the complex, 3101 
NE 15th St., after receiving calls that the 22-year-old had been shot.
Albritton was six weeks pregnant and 
died at the scene from a single bullet wound to her head, Tobias said. The pair’s daugh-ter is now safe with Albritton’s family.
Thomas then drove from the complex in 
a silver pickup truck, Tobias said. 
Police received multiple leads that of-
ﬁ  cers followed to the Budget Inn. GPD in-vestigators, with the help of the Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce and the North Flor-ida Fugitive Task Force, watched the hotel until they discovered he was staying in a room there, Tobias said. 
Ofﬁ  cials called him outside, where he 
was arrested without incident on charges of murder, armed burglary and possession Man jailed for Saturday murder

Cardboard boxes littered the 
concrete as people huddled in line, 
waiting to get their hands on a bowl of chili, a bottle of water or a cup of black coffee.
F.W. Buchholz High School stu-
dents were getting a taste of what it is like to be homeless.
On Friday, three Buchholz orga-
nizations kicked off the beginning of National Homeless Awareness Week by hosting the event One Night Without a Home. The event, which began at 9 p.m. and ran until 7 a.m., was held in a partially covered concrete area known as the mall.
Students spent the night loung-
ing on cardboard boxes without cell phones, electronic devices or other comforts, said Olivia Sanchez, Buch-holz senior.
About 90 students showed up 
and paid $10 to $20 to participate. The event raised about $3,000 for lo-cal organizations, said Ana Journey, student activities director.
“I think it really made the impact 
that there really are less fortunate people,” she said. “It’s about the ex-perience, about realizing you’re on the ﬂ  oor and not in a bed.”
Paula Costas, a 15-year-old Buch-
holz sophomore, said the number of people at the event surprised her.
“This shows how involved our 
school really is and that we’re not just leaving it to other people,” she said.
Gen Arandin, a 17-year-old se-
nior, said the event was about more than donations.
“It’s about instilling this value 
that you want to help people out,” she said. “We know what it feels like, to an extent, to know that it isn’t a great situation to be homeless.”
Guest speakers from Called To 
Action, Basic Life Support Inc., In-terfaith Hospitality Network and Alachua County Coalition for the Homeless and Hungry spoke.
Jamie Betz, the vice president of 
Called to Action, served the students chili and coffee similar to how his organization serves the homeless.  
He said he was impressed nearly 
100 students attended, but he chal-lenged them to keep being mindful of homelessness.
“You made the commitment to-
night,” he said. “Is it something you can do for the rest of your life?” MONDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 3

Ofﬁ  cials are working to resolve issues with the RTS app.
Some buses are not appearing on a scheduled route in the 
app. The app is also experiencing compatibility issues with the Microsoft Windows Phone 8.
“Not all of the ﬂ  eet is outﬁ  tted with GPS transponders,” 
said Chip Skinner, marketing and communications supervisor at the Regional Transit System. 
Some of the buses date back to 1995, Skinner said.“Next summer, we are hoping to get the systems and bring those buses up to date so that they are showing,” he said.
Priya Parikh, a 21-year-old UF agricultural and biological 
engineering senior, said she has experienced buses not show-ing up on the application.
“A lot of times in the morning they don’t have the tracker on,” she said, “so you don’t know where the bus is.”
Students must ﬁ  rst check the announcement section of the 
app to see if a certain bus has been canceled from running dur-ing the normal bus route schedule, Skinner said.
If the bus is not canceled from the normal route schedule, 
then students must refer to the paper schedule, Skinner said.
The application is through a third-party company that is 
working with RTS to make the app compatible with Microsoft Windows Phone 8, Skinner said.
“We’re actively working with the company to get it to sup-
port those phones as well so we have coverage for everybody,” he said.RTS working to resolve issue of buses not appearing in app

Eric Pheterson has been keeping a notebook of 
innovative ideas as long as he’s been in school. 
With his startup company Good Ol’ Original 
Design Inc., Pheterson and his colleagues have 
developed innovative new products with one goal: to help solve the world’s problems. 
They’ve published e-books, created license-
plate-messaging technology and are the leading frozen banana distributors in the state of Florida, Pheterson said. 
“I wanted to bring things out that I thought 
would add value to the world,” said Pheterson, a UF aerospace and mechanical engineering alum-nus.
Though a young startup, Gainesville’s GOOD 
Inc. has a few projects underway. 
An app called TXT TAG allows a user to send 
messages to a stranger, knowing only his or her license plate number. This comes in handy in lots of “annoying” traffic situations, Pheterson said.
Laura Johnson, a 19-year-old UF international 
studies sophomore, said she wished she knew about the technology a month ago.
“I got towed from my own parking complex 
at night and didn’t find out until the next morn-ing when I had to drive my mom to the hospital,” she said.
With the company’s GOOD Pet Feeder, a dog 
can retrieve meals from an automated machine. 
The pet feeder can tell owners whether a 
dog is eating or offer a dog a snack. Even when they’re away, owners of the pet feeder can inter-act with pets from a smartphone or tablet, Phet-erson said. 
As for the frozen bananas, Pheterson said the 
dessert brings good to the world by offering a de-licious treat that’s also healthy and affordable.
He and GOOD Inc. will take on a project as 
long as it answers yes to the following: Does it add value to the world? Is it going to be viable? And will it improve lives?  Gainesville startup’s projects vary

Rugby players at UF are ready to 
take on the defending national cham-
pions, but their wallets say otherwise. 
Through local fundraisers, as well 
as the assistance of alumni and fam-ily, the team has raised about $1,000 of  its $3,000 goal. Money will go to-ward travel, equipment and lodging expenses, said Ryan Gilbert, the 20-year-old treasurer of Men’s Rugby at UF and captain of the Rugby 7s team.  
The UF Rugby 7s sports club will 
be heading to Greensboro, N.C., to compete in the 2013 USA Rugby Col-lege 7s National Championship on Saturday and Sunday. Arkansas, the defending national champion, is in the same bracket as Florida.
Although the Rugby team is given 
about $7,000 from Student Govern-ment, it’s not enough to last the sea-son.
“If we don’t raise enough money 
we have to pull it out of pocket, which can be difficult on a college budget,” said the finance and sports manage-ment junior. 
An alumni donation page on go-
fundme.com was set up by an alum-nus to help the team, Gilbert said.
Rich McDonald, a 22-year-old civil 
engineering senior and vice-president of the club, said they are hoping for a monetary boost to help them realize their potential for success. 
A victory on the national level 
could help the team increase the awareness and help them recruit new players for future seasons, McDonald said.Rugby team asks for funds

Two local agricultural busi-
nesses hosted a festival Sat-
urday to celebrate local food, music and community and to bring in revenue.
The event, organized by the 
Citizens Co-op grocery store and Swallowtail Farm, attract-ed a crowd of about 500 people throughout the day, said Julie Matheney, a worker-owner at the co-op.
Festival activities and dem-
onstrations took place across the fields. Swallowtail farmer Noah Shitama took attendees on a hayride farm tour.
Workshops teaching skills 
such as tea blending and flower growing basics were scheduled during the day.
“We’ve worked really hard 
to create an event that would appeal to all kinds of people,” Matheney said. 
Humble Pie, Off The Grid-
dle, Daily Green and a food stand from the farm and co-op fed hungry attendees.
“Corn nuggets are the 
bomb,” said Alana Kiss, a UF economics freshman, as she sat with a friend eating a basket of the fried food from Off The Griddle.
Citizens Co-op will use its 
half of the funds to expand its bulk section and replace its pro-duce coolers with more energy-efficient equipment, Matheney said. Swallowtail Farm plans to use its money for infrastructural projects, adding more animals and growing more vegetables to be able to support more peo-ple, Shitama said. 
“It’s hard to rely just on the 
sale of vegetables alone,” Shi-tama said.Festival raises money

email addresses, they will all be available in the 
email service. 
Todd Williams, a system administrator and 
programmer with UFIT, wrote in an email that 464 UF students opted in to the new service in the first week.
In the coming semesters, students will gain 
access to cloud versions of all Microsoft prod-ucts, Lync, Sharepoint and Skydrive, which is similar to Dropbox.
Students will have the opportunity to use 
the video-calling service Microsoft Lync. Gale calls the service, “like a better Skype.” 
“There are applications for this that are so 
much more convenient and time-sensitive be-cause students have so many demands on their time,” she said.Gale said all students will be switched to 
the new email service by the end of the Spring 
2014 semester, followed by faculty and staff by Fall 2014.
Under the new system, users can no longer 
forward @ufl.edu messages to outside email 
services like Gmail, according to the website. 
The switch to the cloud service is part of 
UF’s move to update all aspects of the univer-sity experience for the upcoming debut of UF Online, which begins in January.
“Students coming to campus now have an 
expectation level of technology that is cutting edge,” Gale said, “and we need to meet that challenge.”

With the expansion of UF cam-
pus, the south door of the Smathers Library facing Peabody Hall was reopened. The door had been closed since 1958 for budgetary reasons. Too few students used the south door to justify keeping a book-checker there. The assistant director of readers’ ser-vices, Margaret Knox, said that they decided to reopen the door because more buildings were being built south of the library.
Nov. 18, 1977UF professors criticized a re-
searcher for doing experiments on things that go bump in the night. The anthropology researcher, who worked at Florida Technologi-cal University, used people who claimed to have psychic abilities to tell him more about his ancient ar-tifacts. UF anthropology professors wanted to make clear this practice wasn’t used at the university. “The attempt to use psychic phenomena for research is ridiculous,” Charles Fairbanks said.
November 22, 1986Anticrime group The Guardian 
Angels stopped in Gainesville on their way to the state prison in Starke to protest Ted Bundy’s third stay of execution. Members carried signs and covered themselves in ketchup-covered sheets to signify Bundy’s victims. They came in protest of what they considered a miscarriage of justice — Bundy’s continued life on death row. They also disapproved of the Florida court overturning all the capital punishment cases that had been presented to them.
Nov. 18, 1998A UF custodian supposedly

After that tip came up dry, he was ﬁ  nally spotted in Stein-hatchee, an hour and a half away from his home, a week later. What-ever adventures he had while he was missing, he kept them to himself.

Florida’s state parks have won another award 
for excellence. For many Gainesville residents, 
however, recognizing the beauty of local state parks is nothing new. 
The Florida Parks Service won its third Na-
tional Gold Medal for Excellence in October, ac-cording to a state press release. No other state has received more than one of the same award.
“With more than 25 million visitors at our 
parks last year, it’s clear that Florida’s state parks are among the best in the world,” Gov. Rick Scott said in a statement. “These parks pro-vide families with incredible opportunities to enjoy our natural treasures, and they create jobs for Florida families.”
Mark Jamison, director of the public utility 
research center and a UF economics professor, agreed the parks contribute to a healthy state economy.
He said they “attract money into the state, 
which employs people and builds our economy, so we can have our successful education sys-tem.”
The parks broke attendance and economic 
impact records, producing $1.2 billion in rev-enue in the past ﬁ  scal year and attracting about 26 million visitors, according to the release. The revenue primarily comes from tourism and park entry fees.
The success supports 19,104 jobs, and “for 
every 1,000 people who visit a Florida state park or trail, the total direct impact on the park’s local community is almost $47,000,” according to the release.
Lorna McCallister, a 20-year-old UF wild-
life ecology junior, said she enjoys visiting state parks in the Gainesville vicinity.
“Going to them is like a mini vacation from 
campus,” she said. “I always see interesting wildlife on every trip, and they are peaceful ar-eas that are good for stress relief.”
Matt Bledsoe, the assistant park manager at

"People want to see the gators, the bison, the

Obamacare woes 
aren’t just a fumble
For the ﬁ  rst time since 2007, non-economic issues are 
dominating the top two spots in the Gallup poll’s rank-ings of America’s most important problems. Dissatis-
faction with the government in general remains at No. 1 this month, while Americans’ concerns over high health care costs and poor health care jumped from No. 4 last month to No. 2 this month. It comes as no surprise since the Affordable Care Act has been plagued from the start by convolution, lack of transparency, poor planning and lack of accountability on the president’s part — until this past week. 
According to The Washington Post, “We fumbled the roll-
out on this health care law,” he admitted at Thursday after-noon’s news conference. “I am very frustrated, but I’m also somebody who, if I fumbled the ball, you know, I’m going to wait until I get the next play, and then I’m going to try to run as hard as I can and do right by the team.”
The feel-good football metaphor is wearing thin, however. 
Gallup results show President Barack Obama’s approval rat-ing has been falling steadily this year, and his disapproval rating is now at a whopping 53 percent — matching his per-sonal low. 
Perhaps the most unsettling news to surface from the 
Healthcare.gov debacle is that the people the Affordable Care Act was supposed to help are ignoring the health care exchange website. 
Gallup reported last week that only 18 percent of unin-
sured American adults have even attempted to visit a health care exchange website. 
According to Gallup, “The health exchange websites are 
not only fraught with the technical problems that have led to so much news coverage in recent weeks, but have also gener-ated relatively little interest or use among uninsured Ameri-cans — the primary target group for the exchanges. The majority of uninsured Americans are unfamiliar with the ex-changes and relatively few have tried to access them to date, even among those who say that eventually, they will most likely get their insurance through an exchange website.”
The results aren’t altogether surprising: What incentive do 
uninsured adults have to sign up on Healthcare.gov, a broken system with unclear guidelines and misleading promises? 
It’s difﬁ  cult to tell from here if Obama can smooth out the 
kinks of the health care legislation, but the damage may al-ready be done. Americans’, even faithful Democrats’, trust cache in Obama is near empty, and simply “waiting until the next play” won’t cut it anymore. 
Although his campaign was built on optimism — his oft-
quoted promises of hope and change — optimism can only take a president so far. 
Americans aren’t football spectators, and they don’t want 
to wait until the next play and hope for a recovery. 
Americans want an efﬁ  cient and transparent government, 
affordable universal health care, immigration reform, jobs and stable foreign relations. 
Early last week, baseball fans and Atlanta residents 
were shocked to learn that after just two decades of calling Turner Field home, the Atlanta Braves 
are moving to suburban Cobb County in 2017. 
Following the Braves’ move, the city of Atlanta — 
which owns Turner Field — will raze the stadium to make 
way for new development. 
The stadium will be just older than 20 years when it’s 
demolished.
For comparison, Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago 
Cubs, hits its century mark next year. 
America used to be a country that built and pur-
chased things to last. Cars, homes and personal elec-
tronics seemed to last longer than they do now. We didn’t need cell phone companies to set up a plan al-lowing you to upgrade to the latest gizmo after just one year, and baseball stadiums sure lasted longer than two decades.
Sure, there are a lot of factors behind the Braves’ 
move, and they admit that the stadium itself isn’t ready for the wrecking ball, but all too often, we toss things aside that aren’t ready for the trash. 
We’re now a country that barely puts value on any-
thing we own. 
Apple and Google make their new phones and tab-
lets as ﬂ  ashy as possible, giving customers the impres-sion that regardless of what they own, they  must buy the latest iteration. Now.
Moore’s Law states that computing technology dou-
bles in just two years. During the Technological Age, Moore’s Law is now our reality. Americans casually toss aside a perfectly functioning iPhone because Apple tells them the new one is faster, more powerful and will even brush your teeth.
OK, so I made the part about brushing your teeth up, 
but you get the point. We always want something new, exciting and ﬂ  ashy that will make us look like the cool-est person on the planet. 
Take the Braves, for in-
stance. It’s a good baseball team, averaging 93 wins per season during the past three years. However, its stadium is in a wasteland, the fans aren’t coming in droves as they did during the 1990s and baseball 
players are getting more expensive. 
Now, they’re asking Cobb County — and, subse-
quently, its taxpayers — and the team to shell out $672 million to feel and look better. 
There’s little difference between trading that iPhone 
5 for an iPhone 5s and the Braves trading a 20-year-old stadium for a new one. 
From the very wealthy to the struggling college stu-
dents, we need to end our disposable culture. We lose our value as a result, and it’s not helping this country recover from the struggling economy. 
As millions of Americans prepare to hit retail stores 
and spend oodles of money this holiday season on more junk we don’t need, let’s reﬂ  ect a bit on what we have. 
Whether it’s a palatial baseball ﬁ  eld or a lowly, out-
dated iPhone, do we respect the value of something be-fore we cast it aside as outdated or damaged?
We can change the disposable culture for the better 
and learn what our parents tried to instill: the value of a dollar and hard work. 
I’m not saying we can’t occasionally get something 
new, but we have to respect it. 
The Braves seem to share the values of far too many 
Americans: not treasuring something until it’s too late. 
Hopefully the team will learn its lesson before the 
wrecking ball strikes Turner Field.

We have more ways to com-
municate with each other than any generation before 
us.
We’re the most educated, too, ac-
cording to a recent rise in college en-rollment rates.
So why can’t millennials leave the 
nest? 
A new Pew Research Center analy-
sis of recent census data showed only around one of three adults aged 18 to 32 have left their parents’ homes. 
Forming a household may not be high on a col-
lege student’s list of priorities. You’re already out and living an independent adult life, aren’t you? Packing up your belongings and being dropped off on campus freshman year, you felt like a caged bird being set free, right?
Well, it may not be the last time you’re living in 
your childhood home with your parents. The Pew study showed that a record total of 21.6 million mil-lennials already do. Younger millennials, aged 18 to 24, are more likely than their older counterparts, 25- to 32-year-olds to be living with their parents — 56 percent compared to 16 percent, although both groups have seen a rising trend in taking back their places in their family homes. 
There’s a stigma attached to going back. After 
taking a semester internship abroad and coming back to live under my father’s roof, I felt relieved that I had to go back to college instead of staying there indeﬁ  nitely.
It’s easy to think that I had been gone for a long 
time and had my own way of living, but to parents, we are always children, and their rules will always be supreme law.
While I knew I was going back to school and 
hoped I could make my way to independent living when I graduate, I wondered what would happen if all my plans of taking off fell ﬂ  at. After four years of college, what would I do if I go back to the nest?
Would it be such a terrible thing?The advent of social media as a constant pres-
ence of “I want that” and “I have that” in our lives makes us the most self-aware age group yet. With so many opportunities available on the horizon, how would we feel going back to the living ar-rangements we had at 10 years old? Some would say it’s a deﬁ  nitive step back and a loss of indepen-dence.We’re so used to having the “lib-
erty” to be irresponsible that we feel like supervision and parental rules would take something away from us. 
But why does it have to?Renting a studio in the big city may 
seem like the logical next “grown-up” step, but it doesn’t necessarily foster any change. Having to “cope” with living with family again after college 
teaches lessons that 20-somethings might dismiss while living on their own. Millennials can do a lot of growing up just by chipping in for rent, taking care of household chores and being a helper in-stead of a burden.
We are four years into recovery from the Great 
Recession, but unemployment still hovers at 7.3 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economic conditions are a big reason why more young people are putting off getting a places of their own. 
But I don’t think it’s truly about the money. A 
lot of us have done the ramen diet in college, so to speak. Being ﬁ  nancially independent is not as glamorous as it sounds when there are bills to pay and an empty fridge. 
It’s appealing to have the chance to come home 
to mom’s cooking and know that if you fall behind on rent, you won’t be kicked out.
But I think it’s also about what deﬁ  nes our 
generation of ambitious, information-addicted, self-aware millennials. We have a wealth of pos-sibilities at our disposal, and it makes us afraid to commit to any one of those in particular. Choosing something becomes a rejection of everything else, and that is scarier to us than Twitter being down for more than an hour. 
As we seek to be less tied down and free to choose 
any opportunity that crosses our path, we let go of things our parents and grandparents thought were important. They wanted the white picket fence, the ring and the dog. We want the rented-out studio, the casual online dating ﬂ  ing and the backpacking trip across Europe. 
Although the numbers may suggest that millen-
nials are less independent by more of us living at home, I think it suggests that we have a different sense of what independence means. We own less, but we own it.

Moving home may not be step backColumn

opinions@alligator.orgNews broke in 
late October  that Jonathan 
Martin, a starting of-fensive tackle for the Miami Dolphins, had left the team because of emotional issues from bullying by teammates. 
This was a surprise to many 
people because Martin is a key part of the Dolphins, and grown men aren’t expected to bully others, es-pecially in a league as prestigious as the NFL. It’s bad enough to get bullied at all, but in a professional workplace where grown men are getting paid millions of dollars, this is inexcusable.
Martin was drafted in the sec-
ond round by the Dolphins in 2012. He is a 6-foot-6-inch, 320-pound player of biracial descent who attended Stanford Univer-sity. Martin went AWOL after a cafeteria prank by his teammates. 
A few days later, it was con-
ﬁ  rmed that Richie Incognito was a suspected bully. Voicemails and text messages to Martin began to leak out. Some of the messages contained racial slurs and other despicable threats. 
It appears the NFL has a major 
hazing problem, too. 
It is obvious that one reason 
Martin was targeted by teammates is because he was a rookie. Rook-ies are forced to do many things for veterans and have no choice in the matter. Dolphin rookies were handed the tab for a $30,000 team dinner. Some players have contacted the Miami Herald say-ing they are on their way to go-ing broke because they cannot say no to veter-ans.
Incognito has had a 
very troubling past. He 
was suspended from both Nebras-ka and Oregon football teams and has assault charges from college. Incognito was voted the dirtiest player in the NFL in a 2009 vote by his peers in the Sporting News. He was released by the Rams in 2009 after an argument with his head coach.
Every team he has played on 
has either suspended him or cut ties. Notably, Richie Incognito was bullied himself as a child.
There are many people to 
blame for this situation. One is head coach Joe Philbin. Philbin is a second-year head coach, and it appears he turned a blind eye to what happens in the locker room. The Dolphins named a six-person leadership council, and Incognito was on it. One of his responsi-bilities was to carry team issues up to the council. Martin never went to coaches and team leaders about the problems. He must have found it embarrassing to go up to other players in a professional and “tough guy” environment.
There are very few of us who 
walk this world without getting bullied.
The culture of the NFL needs 
to change because there is no need for bullying in any context.

Gainesville’s downtown sector was filled with tents, 
and pedestrians pushed strollers and walked dogs as 
they wandered through the 32nd Annual Downtown Festival & Art Show on Saturday and Sunday.
Although the art was the main draw of crowds this 
weekend, those who attended were surprised by other fixtures at the festival such as a flutist performing hyp-notizing melodies and a band set up at Bo Diddley Com-munity Plaza. 
Hannah Carr, an 18-year-old UF accounting fresh-
man, said she was happy to be viewing the exhibits for the first time this weekend. 
“Some people think you have to go to school in a big 
city to find art like this when really our campus is just a block away from some really amazing stuff,” she said.
Original art pieces ranged from photographs to jew-
elry. Sitting near their work, the artists acted as voices for their masterpieces and told the stories behind their work.
Mosaic artist Kevan Breitinger, who exhibits her work 
at about 30 shows a year, enjoys coming to Gainesville to display her art.
“The Gainesville community is great about support-
ing the arts,” she said. “It’s what’s had me coming back for five years now.” Art festival draws thousands downtown� IT SHOULD BE OPEN BY

Four months after opening 
Andaz Indian Restaurant, owner 
Parvesh Khirbat is hungry for a new venture.
About three months ago, the 
31-year-old purchased the empty space once home to Jolie Catering on University Avenue. He’s been remodeling the space to transform it into a banquet venue. Khirbat said he plans to schedule events from weddings and holiday dinners to corporate events and Sweet 16 par-ties. He expects it to be open by Thanksgiving.
“We’re just a couple (steps) 
away,” he said. 
As no event is complete without 
dancing, Khirbat said the new space will give customers options when setting up events. The space can ac-commodate about 200 seats without a dance floor or 150 seats to give pa-trons the opportunity to cut the rug.
Khirbat said Andaz will provide 
most of the catering, but it’s also will-ing to outsource. He said his cooks can prepare Italian, Mexican, Indian, Chinese and American cuisine.
“We have a pretty diverse staff in 
the kitchen,” he said. “It makes my job much easier.”    
Caue Ferreira, a 24-year-old UF 
chemistry graduate student, has dined at Andaz before and said he can see himself attending the new space when it opens.
“I don’t have any planned events, 
but if they bring in live music, I’ll be there,” he said. 
Despite the collaboration with 
Andaz restaurant, Khirbat said he is going to keep the original name, Jolie.
“It’s been there for about the last 
15 years in Gainesville,” he said.  “I want to preserve the history.” 
Although such a project can be 
overwhelming, Khirbat said he’s glad to bring more diversity to the community.
“At first, I was a little hesitant to 
take on a project this big,” he said. “But it’s next door, it’s convenient, and this is what I’ve been wanting to do for a long time.”

Innovative vending machines 
on campus are helping busy stu-
dents go green.
The organic, kosher, vegan and 
gluten-free snacks from the 2bU vending machines were brought to UF last year. Because of their success, more 2bU vending ma-chines could be scattered around campus.
The machines are working well 
with students, said Mike Cham-bers, an assistant at UF Business Services Division.
Chambers said UF is looking to 
add more machines to campus, but it is a matter of available space.He credits the success of the 
machines to recent cultural atti-tudes about food.
“I think there’s a trend toward 
people eating healthier,” Cham-bers said.
To promote this trend, the ma-
chines include an LCD screen so customers can view additional nutritional information about the snacks. The machines also use technology to maximize energy efficiency, including LED lighting and motion sensor dimmers when customers are not present, accord-ing to the company’s website.
Andrea Likens, a UF  telecom-
munication senior, said she pur-chases from 2bU machines once a week. She also said the items in the machines are healthier and better than the snack foods from regular machines.
Still, all these benefits come at 
a price. 
“It’s definitely on the more ex-
pensive side,” said Shannon Bra-dy, a UF anthropology junior. “I’m assuming because it’s healthier.”   
Vending items are priced from 
$1.75 to $3. 
Items in traditional vending 
machines on campus are priced from 60 cents to $2.50.

Gainesville Police arrested 
a group of locals after break-
ing up a fight Saturday night behind Gumby’s Pizza, 2028 SW 34th St.
Officers charged 25-year-
old Derek Melcolm and 26-year-old Sean Corcoran with simple battery, according to an arrest report. They also arrested Janette Friend, 39, on aggravated assault charges. 
At about 11:30 p.m., Corc-
oran called Friend, one of the employees, a “dirty whore,” said GPD spokesman Officer Ben Tobias. Friend threw two glass beer bottles at Corcoran in response. Corcoran then punched the owner and a res-taurant patron.
Soon, Melcolm began fight-
ing with employees as well. Officers arrived, and after Melcolm ignored commands to stop, they used a Taser on him, Tobias said. 
Officers booked the trio 
into the Alachua County Jail. They were released Sunday afternoon on their own recog-nizance.

The Alachua County 
Sheriff’s Office arrested a Gainesville man Friday morn-ing after deputies reported he sent almost 500 texts, emails and other messages to his ex-girlfriend.
Deputies charged Ray-
mond Robert Fenn, 35, with cyberstalking, according to an ASO arrest report.
Fenn began dating his girl-
friend in January until she broke up with him Sept. 17, telling him not to contact her again, according to the report. In the hours after the breakup, Fenn sent her 37 text mes-sages.
Since that day, he’s sent her 
189 text messages, 96 emails and 60 Facebook messages, according to the report. He also left her 87 voicemails and hand-delivered five letters. 
In the messages, Fenn told 
her he is “severely trauma-tized” by the breakup and that he had to see a doctor, ac-cording to the report. He also said he didn’t know why she ended the relationship and needed “closure.”
During questioning, Fenn 
told deputies he received his ex-girlfriend’s text message not to contact her again and admitted to the continued contact. 
Deputies booked Fenn into 
the Alachua County Jail Fri-day. He was released Satur-day afternoon after meeting bond. Weekend crime: pizza

COLUMBIA, S.C. — Add Will 
Muschamp to the injury report.
After punching a chalkboard in 
the locker room during halftime, 
bandages wrapped around the third-year coach’s right middle and index ﬁ  ngers while a shallow cut was visible on his pinky. 
He bore the brunt of another 
late collapse and another missed opportunity following a 19-14 loss to No. 10 South Carolina on Satur-day night.Florida played inspired foot-
ball, and “Coach Boom” made sure it wasn’t forgotten.
“You can say what you want 
to say and write whatever the hell you want to write, but it’s real. It’s frustrating. It’s frustrating for that locker room,” Muschamp said. “To hell with me, I worry about the kids. These kids fought their butts off. There’s a lot of negativity out there, and some of our fans need to get a grip. They really do. We have a bunch of kids in that locker room ﬁ  ghting their butt off.”
With another defeat, Florida 
(4-6, 3-5 Southeastern Conference) needs to beat both Georgia South-ern and No. 2 Florida State in or-der to preserve its 22-year bowl appearance streak. 
All this may have to happen 
without starting quarterback Ty-ler Murphy, who missed Saturday

Will Muschamp speaks at a press conference following Florida’s 19-14 loss to South Carolina on Saturday

PASSES ON SATURDAY.
ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
Alligator Staff Writer @alichtenstein24
COLUMBIA, S.C. — It was 
a storybook setting for Skyler 
Mornhinweg.
The stage was set for the 
redshirt freshman to make a grand entrance in his Gators debut. Florida was on the road in front of a hostile crowd as a two-touchdown underdog.
But the fairy tale did not 
come to be.
The redshirt freshman was 
limited during his ﬁ  rst career start in Florida’s 19-14 loss to No. 10 South Carolina (8-2, 6-2 Southeastern Conference) at Williams-Brice Stadium on Saturday, throwing only 13 times in the game.
“I told him to cut it loose 
and have fun,” coach Will Muschamp said.
 “We weren’t going to put 
a lot on him as far as asking him to do a bunch of different things.”
Mornhinweg — Florida’s 
third-string quarterback as late as the end of September — made little impact early in the game. 
The Philadelphia native 
threw only two passes in the ﬁ  rst half for a total of 8 yards. Multiple times, the second-year signal-caller lined up under center only to run out wide to allow a running back to take a direct snap.
Mornhinweg had more 
chances to air the ball out in the second half, completing eight of 11 throws after the second quarter.
The redshirt freshman 
completed several short pass-es but did not throw any deep balls. His longest pass of the day was a 28-yard screen to running back Mack Brown. Brown did most of the work on the play, taking the dump-off catch and turning it into a big gain.
“I feel like Skyler has a 
lot of poise about himself,” Brown said. “He did pretty good, man. He tried to.” 
But late in the game, Morn-
hinweg made a decision that cost Florida (4-6, 3-5 SEC) a shot at a comeback.
After the Gators got the 
ball at their own 26-yard line, Mornhinweg led Florida down the ﬁ  eld, completing passes of 15, 4 and 7 yards.
The redshirt freshman had 
time to throw after taking the snap from the South Carolina 48-yard line, and he rolled out to the right.
Mornhinweg targeted 
sophomore Latroy Pittman down the USC sideline, but Gamecocks defensive back Jimmy Legree picked off the pass, sealing South Carolina’s victory. 
“He hung his head a little 
bit, but he got right back up,” offensive lineman Max Garcia said. “He’s a young player and he’s going to make those mistakes.”
Added Mornhinweg: “I 
just got to make a better de-cision. Got to throw the ball away in that situation. That’s Mornhinweg limited 
in ﬁ  rst career startMuschamp defends undermanned UF
FIRE JOE MORGAN
COLUMBIA, S.C. — Brent Pease looked like a new 
man on Saturday night.
Actually, he looked like an old man — the guy 
who came from Boise State in 2011.
You know, the school with the blue turf that upset Okla-

(Pease wasn’t the offensive coordinator then, but he 
was part of the system as the wide receivers coach. But I digress.)Using a variety of backﬁ  eld 
shifts and heavy fronts consisting of as many as eight men on the line of scrimmage at a time, Florida ran wild during the ﬁ  rst half of a 19-14 loss to No. 10 South Carolina at Williams-Brice Stadium.
The Gamecocks eventually shut 
down the Gators’ new-look offense, but the performance was an eye-opener.With third-string quarterback Skyler Mornhinweg — 
and numerous other players — taking the snaps, Florida tallied 169 rushing yards in the ﬁ  rst half against a defense that entered the night allowing 145.3 yards on the ground per game.
The effort was not only shocking, but exciting.Although the Gators racked up only 31 more rushing 
yards on 19 second-half carries, the performance shone with potential. Pease shows promise in changed offensive approach

Florida’s ﬁ  ve-game losing streak program’s longest since 1979
Gators were likely the only ones who ex-
pected to come out with such success. Leads have been few and far between for UF, which had not led at any point in its past three games. 
Prior to Saturday, Florida’s last lead came 
early in the second quarter of a loss to LSU on Oct. 12 — the same day Murphy suffered a sprained AC joint in his throwing shoul-der.
“We were able to eat the clock and move 
the ball and follow the script, so to speak, of what we needed to do to be successful,” Muschamp said. 
A half away from snapping its four-game 
losing streak, the Gators had an opportunity to put themselves in ﬁ  rm position to poten-tially earn a bowl berth. 
With a win against South Carolina, Flori-
da would have needed to win just one of its remaining games against Georgia Southern and No. 2 Florida State. 
However, it was not to be. Now, the 
Gators have the daunting task of beating an undermanned FCS foe and a national-title contender that will likely be favored by at least two touchdowns entering The Swamp. 
UF’s downfall began early in the third 
quarter.Florida went three-and-out after receiv-
ing the football ﬁ  rst to open the second half. South Carolina responded by quickly marching down the ﬁ  eld. 
On third and 3 from the UF 32-yard line, 
Shaw ﬁ  nally found his touch and connected with Bruce Ellington, who had gotten be-hind Florida defensive back Brian Poole in the end zone. 
The touchdown cut the Gators’ lead to 
14-13 with 10:23 remaining in the third quar-ter while also jumpstarting the Gamecocks’ offense.  
“We gave up some plays that we 
shouldn’t have,” safety Cody Riggs said. “Lost our focus, I think. We should have won the game for the offense. They put us in a good position early in the game. We were up eight points, but we didn’t come through for them.” 
UF’s defense bent several more times in 
the second half, but it never broke.
The Gators held the Gamecocks to a pair 
of ﬁ  eld goals late in the fourth quarter, but their productive ﬁ  rst-half offense was re-placed by the punchless unit that has come to be expected. 
The biggest blow came from South Car-
olina tailback Shon Carson, who led the Gamecocks in rushing despite playing be-hind Davis, the team’s featured back. 
On ﬁ  rst and 15 from the USC 5-yard line, 
Carson ripped off a 58-yard run up the mid-dle of the ﬁ  eld to move the Gamecocks into Gators territory. 
Seven plays later, South Carolina took its 
ﬁ  rst lead of the game on a 22-yard ﬁ  eld goal by Elliott Fry.
Fry, who made four ﬁ  eld goals in the 
game, tacked on three more points with 2:16 remaining in the fourth quarter to extend South Carolina’s lead to 19-14. 
Forced to make a play in the waning min-
utes, Mornhinweg threw an interception on the ensuing drive to eliminate any chance at a comeback. 
He ﬁ  nished the game 10-of-13 passing for 
107 yards with no touchdowns and the one interception in his debut. 
“Somehow it worked out again,” South 
Carolina coach Steve Spurrier said. “First half, they had us a little bit on our heels, but our guys got tougher in the second half and shut Florida down pretty good.”  
Despite suffering their ﬁ  fth straight loss for the ﬁ  rst time since 1979 — a year Florida went 0-10-1, its most recent losing season — the Gators showed the type of ﬁ  ght Mus-champ hoped to see. UF’s third-year coach was satisﬁ  ed with the resolve of his players given the current circumstances the team faces.
Florida opened the game with its seventh 
different starting offensive line combination of the season, was missing 10 players who are out for the year and did not have corner-back Marcus Roberson, who became the sev-enth Gator to be suspended at some point this season when he violated team rules this week.
The setbacks have turned the team from 
a national-title contender to an afterthought. But with a long-term view in mind, Mus-champ supported his players.
“Guys, it’s not excuses. It’s real,” Mus-
champ said. “It really is. You can say what you want to say and write whatever the hell you want to write, but it’s real. It’s frustrat-ing. 
“It’s frustrating for that locker room. To 
hell with me. I worry about the kids. These kids fought their butts off. There’s a lot of negativity out there, and some of our fans need to get a grip. They really do. We have a bunch of kids in that locker room ﬁ  ghting their butt off.”

Kicking woes continue: The 
Gators continued to struggle kick-
ing field goals on Saturday.
UF attempted only one field 
goal against USC, but redshirt freshman Austin Hardin missed the 32-yard try.
“We’re a team that needs to capitalize on those opportunities,” Muschamp said.
Hardin is 4 of 11 on field-goal 
attempts this season. Other kickers are 6 of 7.
Last season, Florida had Caleb 
Sturgis as starting kicker. He made 24 of 28 field goals.
Roberson suspended: Cor-
nerback Marcus Roberson was suspended for Saturday’s game against USC due to a violation of team rules, UF announced before the game.
The junior was dealing with an 
ankle injury and would likely have missed the game had he not been suspended, Muschamp said.
Muschamp said after the game 
that he will meet with Roberson on Monday to discuss the suspen-sion. 
night’s game due to a right 
shoulder sprain.
To say this has been a tough 
year for Florida does not do it justice. Athletics Director Jer-emy Foley and University of Florida President Bernie Ma-chen voiced their support for Muschamp in a press release on Wednesday. 
“As athletic director, I’m a 
thousand percent convinced that Will Muschamp is the guy to lead this football pro-gram,’’ Foley said.
Muschamp fell to 22-14 in 
his head-coaching career af-ter Trey Burton was leveled on the game’s final play. An offensive attack of three runs and a first down turned into three runs and a cloud of dust once South Carolina adjusted in the second half.
The Gators gained just 31 
rushing yards after a first half during which the Wildcat ex-perienced a renaissance of sorts with quarterback Skyler Mornhinweg going in mo-tion and Kelvin Taylor taking two direct snaps for the only Florida touchdowns Saturday night.
The Gators’ chance of be-
coming bowl eligible took a significant hit after Florida held its first lead since UF led LSU 3-0 on Oct. 12. 
From the start, the Gators 
were playing with nothing to lose after a season in which it lost everything — 10 players to season-ending injuries, con-ference title aspirations and its national standing.
UF players took to Twit-
ter following the game. “So proud of my teammates man!! We keep fighting no mat-ter what! #GoGators,” Jaylen Watkins (@jwat14) said from his account.
Kyle Koehne (@King-
Kone64) went one step fur-ther: “All I can say is we played our hearts out. We left everything out there on the field. I hope Gator nation saw that as well.”
After the game, it was not 
just about the chalkboard be-ing an innocent bystander in a moment of impulse and pas-sion. It was about a coach who defended his players, a coach asking for trust and a coach looking to move on.
“I understand the passion 
and the disappointment,’’ Fol-ey said of UF fans on Wednes-day. “But at the end of the day, we’ve got great fans, they love the Gators and their pas-sion makes this place special. They are hurting, they want the program to be successful and we feel that hurt.”
That never rang truer than 
on Saturday night.Florida’s stagnant offense actually 
moved the football.
Direct snaps to Kelvin Taylor, sweeps to 
Solomon Patton and Valdez Showers and 
Trey Burton-run Wildcat plays that did not lose yardage gashed South Carolina’s de-fense.
Last season, Pease famously said, “Mass 
kicks ass.”
On Saturday night, during the first half, 
mass, as well as mass confusion, kicked ass.
Imagine if Jeff Driskel were healthy.Not only would the 6-foot-4, 239-pound 
quarterback be a potent runner in those sets, but he possesses the arm to balance the attack and keep the defense honest.
Many Gators fans rag on Driskel’s pock-
et presence and susceptibility to turnovers — two faults that overshadow the strides he seemingly made as a passer during the offseason.
Two bad throws that resulted in inter-
ceptions and a sack fumble overshadowed a stat line against Miami that included a ca-reer-high 291 passing yards by the Oviedo native.
Imagine a talented dual-threat quarter-
back like four-star commit Will Grier of Davidson (N.C.) Day High running this offense. He has amassed more than 5,500 yards of total offense and 82 total touch-downs as a senior this season.
Mostly, think of what Florida’s run-ning backs could do in this offense that only loses two starters along the offensive line in Jon Halapio and Jon Harrison while returning three injured starters in Chaz Green, D.J. Humphries and Tyler Moore next season.
Matt Jones, Taylor and Mack Brown 
would run wild. Taylor and Brown aver-aged 4.6 yards per carry on a combined 32 rushing attempts. Add in a bruiser like Jones and all bets are off to how much Flor-ida could run.
Pease has come under fire during his 
two-year tenure as Florida’s offensive coor-dinator and deservedly so. The Gators rank 113th nationally with 332.8 yards per game this season, a step back from last season’s No. 104 ranking of 334 yards per game.
The results are simply unacceptable and 
sufficient, and notable progress was most-ly absent — until Saturday night. As two-touchdown underdogs in front of 83,853 hostile fans, UF nearly pulled off the upset with an inexperienced redshirt freshman quarterback.
Regardless of whether you want Pease 
fired (based on my Twitter feed, many of you do) or you want to give him more time, you have to admit he was impressive on Saturday.
And if this season is it for Pease in 
Gainesville, the South Carolina game will always serve as an enticing and interesting case of “What if?”
And with a potentially bowl-less offsea-
son looming for Florida, there is plenty of time for “What if?” MONDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 2013 § ALLIGATOR, 15

� HE RECORDED 17 POINTS AND NINE 
REBOUNDS IN SATURDAY’S VICTORY. 
JONATHAN CZUPRYN
Alligator Writer @jczupryn
There was no red carpet rolled out for 
Dorian Finney-Smith on Saturday night. 
There was no standing ovation when he 
subbed in to a 3-3 tie against Arkansas-Little 
Rock, and there was no curtain call when No. 11 Florida walked off the court two hours later with a 30-point victory.
But in his 16-minute debut with the 
Gators, a sick and exhausted Finney-Smith showed Billy Donovan, his team and the O’Connell Center the grit that had been ab-sent from the squad so far this season.
Because the Virginia Tech transfer was 
bedridden all week, he had not picked up a basketball — let alone practiced — since Monday.
But with his suspension for violating 
team rules recently lifted, Finney-Smith said he was not going to let poor health get in his way of being on the court.
“Coach, I can go,” the redshirt sopho-
more told Donovan during shootaround on Saturday morning. “He was trying to hold me. He was thinking about it, but I’m just like, ‘I’m ready to go.’”
Finney-Smith, like the rest of the Gators, 
had a slow ﬁ  rst half. In six minutes of work, he had ﬁ  ve points and one rebound as UF struggled to bring the game to a 27-27 tie by halftime.
Without Finney-Smith, Florida was out-
rebounded in its ﬁ  rst two games of the sea-son for the ﬁ  rst time since 2007. The addi-tion of the 6-foot-8 forward was supposed to improve the frontcourt and provide the team with second chance opportunities.
But in the ﬁ  rst half, the Trojans had a 22-
15 edge on rebounds over the Gators despite Finney-Smith being on the ﬂ  oor.
“I was really disappointed,” Donovan 
said. “We gave up nine points on loose balls and offensive rebounds. I was happy (the score) was tied with the way we were play-ing.”
Finney-Smith said his chest and legs were 
burning throughout the game, but he added that it would have been wrong to play with-out giving maximum effort.
In the second half, Donovan and the rest 
of Florida saw that effort.
In 10 minutes, not only did Finney-Smith 
add 12 points, but he also grabbed eight more rebounds to bring his game total to a team-high of nine.
Donovan said Finney-Smith gave the 
Gators the spark they needed to pull away from the Trojans even though the redshirt sophomore was not at 100 percent in his ﬁ  rst game in nearly two years.
“I really didn’t know what to expect,” 
Donovan said.
“He hadn’t really picked up a ball since 
Monday. He really moved the basketball and made the extra pass. Because he can shoot it, put it on the ﬂ  oor and pass, he opens up a lot of other things for our guys.”
The only reward Finney-Smith wanted 
after the game was getting a chance to rest before Florida takes on Southern on Monday at 7 p.m.
Because of the quick turnaround, Dono-
van held Finney-Smith out of practice Sun-day in order to give him as much rest as pos-sible before the next game.Redshirt sophomore transfer
