A sold-out crowd packed the 
Phillips Center for the Performing 
Arts Monday night to watch the 2012 UF Homecoming Pageant.
Judges chose six ﬁ  nalists for 
the Homecoming Court: Charlie Cope, Matthew Davidson, Steven Gallo, Stephanie Etzig, Cecelia Hardwick and Auriel Rolle-Polk.
The opening number reﬂ  ect-
ed Homecoming’s “United We Growl” theme. The 40 women danced to Bruce Springsteen’s “Born in the U.S.A.,” wearing red, white and blue dresses, and the men sported Gator Growl shirts and blazers.
“It was a great experience,” 
Cope said. “I think the best part was just joking around with all the guys backstage and trying to perfect our dance.”
The judges panel included 
Carol Muschamp, UF spokesman Steve Orlando and Associate Vice President of Student Affairs Norb Dunkel.
The contestants and their 
sponsors were introduced during the Gator-gameday casual-wear phase. The women donned orange and blue dresses and were accom-panied by men wearing Gator gear from Pennington & Bailes.
Each contestant’s campus in-
volvement and life goals were described during the formal wear segment.
Rhythmic tap group STOMP 
performed before the special award winners and top 12 ﬁ  nalists were announced.
Haley Sasser was chosen by the 
contestants as Miss Congeniality, Tarin Moses won Miss Photoge-nic and Allison Banko won Queen of Hearts, which was sponsored by LifeSouth Community Blood Centers. Etzig and Gallo won the Florida Virtual School Academic Excellence Award.
“My mind is blown. It is a 
dream come true,” Hardwick said. “It was amazing for all of us to do this at the beginning of our senior year.”

BOCA RATON — Just feet away from 
Gov. Mitt Romney and President Barack 
Obama, people gathered at Lynn University’s soccer ﬁ  eld Monday to watch the ﬁ  nal Presi-dential Debate.
About 700 students, sponsors and invited 
guests gathered from 5 p.m. on to watch the live debate on three blow-up screens and two televisions.
Throughout the debate, attendees re-
mained consistent with their cheering for both candidates. The Romney fans were consistent-ly louder, and a few even screamed “liar” dur-ing Obama’s closing statements. But everyone came together to celebrate whenever Boca Ra-ton or Lynn University was mentioned.
Back in Gainesville, politically active stu-
dents were pleased with their candidates’ per-formances.“We had so many high moments,” said 
Gators for Obama co-chair and 20-year-old political science junior Rachel McGovern. “It was very exciting to see President Obama ba-sically fact-check Gov. Romney on the spot.”
UF College Republicans chairwoman Katy 
Melchiorre, a 21-year-old political science and telecommunication senior, said the debate’s dynamic seemed different than those of the other two.
“Romney laid out real plans and achiev-
able goals for our country . Obama spoke in a lot of political rhetoric and just attacked Rom-ney,” she said. “I thought that he acted more presidential than the president himself.”

While college is known to be a drain 
on students’ energy, UF graduates have 
less strain on their wallets.
A study released this month by the 
Institute for College Access and Suc-cess found that the average debt for students who graduated in 2011 was about $26,000, putting Florida near the bottom of the list.
The state with the highest graduat-
ing debt was New Hampshire, with about $32,000. Hawaii and Utah had the lowest, with about $17,000. Flor-ida had an average student debt of $23,000.
“Two-thirds of students nationally 
graduate with student-loan debt,” said Steve Orlando, UF spokesman, in an email. “At UF, two-thirds of students graduate without debt.”
Fifty-one percent of Florida stu-
dents who graduated in 2011 had debt from student loans.
Orlando said UF graduates have an 
average debt of about $17,000.
Students who choose to take out 
loans do so be-cause they don’t get enough money to cover their expenses from Federal Pell Grants and other 
scholarships.
Family, youth and 
community sciences junior Valerie Val-
court, 20, said she took out a loan once she started school because her scholar-ships didn’t cover food and housing.
She said she’ll graduate with about Florida listed among states 
with least graduation debt

Gay Movie Night: “Private 
Romeo”
This gay adaptation of “Romeo and Juliet” is set in a modern day military school. When eight male cadets are left behind at an isolated mili-tary high school, the greatest romantic drama ever written seeps out of the classroom and permeates their lives. Incorporating the original text of Shakespeare’s “Romeo and Juliet,” YouTube videos and lip-synched indie rock music, “Private Romeo” takes us to a mysterious and tender place that only Shakespeare could have inspired. Gay Movie Night is on the last Friday of each month at 7:30 p.m. and is a free service of the Pride Community Center of North Central Florida. “Private Romeo” will screen on Friday at 7:30 p.m. at Pride Community Center, 3131 NW 13th St. A $2 dona-tion is requested to cover the cost of snacks.

The difference between life and 
death for Brittany Taltos was a soft 
patch of dirt.
Taltos, a 23-year-old UF alumna 
featured on “Jersey Shore,” was sunbathing in her front yard Sun-day afternoon when her friend reversed his pickup truck into the yard and partially ran over her head.
Taltos said she was asleep in 
front of her house, located on the 300 block of Northwest 14th Street, before the truck backed into her.
“I woke up with half a tire in my 
face,” she said.
The tire trapped Taltos by her 
hair, pinning her to the ground, while the pressure on her head caused her ears to bleed.
“I thought I was going to die,” 
she said.
When Taltos screamed for help, 
the driver moved his truck forward and helped her with the bleeding.
Taltos’ roommate, Diego Ca-
brera, 21, called 911. An ambulance rushed Taltos, who was still con-scious, to Shands at UF for treat-ment, according to a Gainesville Fire Rescue news release.
At the hospital, doctors used an 
X-ray to scan her head and found no signs of brain or skull damage.
“They told me ‘You basically 
dodged a bullet,’” she said.
Doctors treated Taltos for minor 
injuries, which included bruises on her face, a cut on one side of her head and about 10 stitches on her left ear, she said. Taltos checked out from the hospital later that day.
GFR firefighters said there 
was “a noticeable depression in the lawn,” which may have been caused by the tire pushing Taltos’ head into the ground.
“It was very fortunate she was 
on softer ground where this oc-curred,” said GFR Lt. Tracey Hig-don. “The injuries may have been much worse, if not fatal.”

Tuition increased this year
$20,000 in debt.
“Once you get past the 20s, it 
gets really bad,” she said.
Orlando said the university 
encourages students to graduate 
in a timely manner to avoid extra debt.
“Our four-year graduation 
rate is 65 percent, and our six-year graduation rate is 83 per -
cent,” he said. “The more quickly you graduate, the less time you have to build up debt.”
Scholarships such as Federal 
Pell Grants are not providing students money for Summer terms. Only loans are available.
UF students have also seen a 
tuition increase this year.
Orlando said there has been 
an increase in the amount of student loan debt as tuition ris-es. But he said UF students still graduate with less debt than the national average.
He said more than 96 percent 
of UF freshmen qualify for Bright Futures.“UF’s tuition, $6,143 a year, 
is much lower than the national average for public universities of more than $8,200,” Orlando said.
UF sociology junior Luisa 
Jorge, 24, said she has not had to take out a loan yet because schol-arships have covered all her ex-penses so far.
Jorge works part time now but 
said because of the tuition raise, she expects to take out a loan for $2,500 next semester. More core classes mean more expenses and less time for her job, she said.
Political science sophomore 
Marine Robbins, 19, said she took out a loan, too.
“I chose to go to UF because 
the financial opportunity was better for me here,” she said. “Comparatively speaking, Flor -
ida is still a cheap state.”debt , from page 1
“The more quickly you 
graduate, the less time you 
have to build up debt.”
Steve Orlando
UF spokesman“They told me ‘You basi-
cally dodged a bullet.’”
Brittany Taltos
UF alumnaemeier, Christina Bonarrigo, 
Allison Archer and Victoria Hunter rounded out the top 12.
Each finalist answered 
what he or she thought was the most important quality UF’s next president should possess. Most said they want-ed the new president to rep-resent UF’s diverse Student Body and understand the value of academics and extra-curricular activities.
The score of each finalist’s response was added to his or her total interview, casual-wear and formal-wear scores, which narrowed the field to six. 
Those scores are the same 
used to determine the Home-coming King and Queen, which won’t be announced until Gator Growl on Nov. 9.
The pageant also served 
to get students ready for oth-er upcoming Homecoming events.
“It was super entertain-
ing,” said 20-year-old health science junior Brandi Ros-ier. “Everybody looked so thrilled.”

People in all fields now have the opportu-
nity to build model airplanes or create their 
own 3-D video game characters right on cam-pus.
The A² Fab Lab, located in Room 307 of the 
Architecture Building, recently expanded its capabilities to allow all UF students, faculty and staff to use its facilities.
“Once people see this technology in action 
and understand it, everyone will be blown away,” said lab manager Mat Chandler. 
“Their creative minds will be rolling to 
create the next big thing.”
The lab has been open for three years, he 
said, but until now, its audience has been pri-marily arts and architecture students. Users can experiment with 3-D printing, 3-D scan-ning and laser-cutting capabilities.
The lab will host an open house on Thurs-
day for students, faculty and staff to see live demonstrations, buy memberships and see work made from the machines. 
Discounted memberships are $75 until 
Nov. 1. The price will become $110 for the rest of the semester.Chandler said about 125 students current-
ly use the lab.
Taejin Kim, a 31-year-old doctoral student 
of interior design, hasn’t used the lab yet, but he said that he plans to work in the lab in the future.
“Knowing how to use this technology is 
very useful,” Kim said. “I need to use this equipment to have a leg up on others who are unfamiliar with this technology.”
In order to use the equipment, students 
must attend an orientation class, Chandler said. 
Lab assistants will teach students how to 
use software like AutoCAD and Adobe Illus-trator.
“This lab is going to create a wave of cre-
ativity throughout the university that is going to change the way we think about the making of objects,” he said.UF art lab expands access to 3-D resources for students

Internet campaigns 
try to take focus
Something sneaky’s going on behind our backs.
Because of the “trick” aspect to late October, both Mitt 
Romney and Donald Trump have some kind of surprises 
up their sleeves.
Well, one of the surprises is probably about Romney.
Last week, a new website was launched: OctSurprise.com.It stated: “One of your presidential candidates isn’t being 
honest with you. Stay tuned to ﬁ  nd out which one it is.”
Early speculation suggested that it was going to ﬁ  nally re-
lease Romney’s tax records, a point of contention during the re-cent months of the presidential campaign.
Politicker interviewed one of the developers of the site, Jeff 
Hopwood, to ﬁ  nd out what was really going on.
Hopwood said he actually knows very little about  what the 
site is for; he just helped build it. Additionally , it may not even be directly related to a political campaign.
“I tend to think it might be some type of marketing thing be-
cause of the way they contacted us,” Hopwood said, according to Politicker, and he added that he and the other developers put the site together in “like a half an hour.”
Great. Turns out the site was just an excuse to “Rickroll” 
thousands of people. What is this, 2007?
Way to get our hopes up there for a second. Though, to be 
fair, nothing can really beat the Democratic National Commit-tee’s website, RomneyTaxPlan.com, when it comes to political Internet hoaxes.
Trump’s announcement, whatever it is, will most likely come 
on Wednesday . He promises that it is “very , very big” and that it concerns President Obama directly.
He also said it will be “bigger than anybody would know,” 
and that Fox News anchors will “cover it in a very big fashion,” according to the Christian Science Monitor about his appearance on “Fox & Friends” on Monday morning. 
This is more than likely Trump’s way of trying to stay rel-
evant when he is no longer needed. So forgive us if we’re not on the edge of our seats for this one. Is this Trump’s way of at-tempting to get inside Obama’s head? Because it probably won’t work.
He made all of this hype about Wednesday’s announce-
ment on the day of the last Presidential Debate. Put yourself in Obama’s shoes: Would you even pay a pinch of attention to what anyone besides your family or your campaign team is tell-ing you? No chance.
The fact that Trump thinks he can weasel his way in any-
where is just a weird side effect of his “celebrity.” He’s not a political ﬁ  gure, but he keeps trying to make himself one. Just because you have a lot of money, Trump, doesn’t mean you can just barge in where you’re not wanted.
His birther conspiracy might have something to do with the 
announcement, but that will probably do more harm to him than good. Besides, the Obama merchandise website now sells copies of his birth certiﬁ  cate on mugs.
We’re past that as a country. President Obama won’t get dis-
tracted, and neither should we. Hopefully this won’t be another way to blare Rick Astley at us.Social media should not be slandered
The Associated Press created a new position: social me-dia and user-generated content editor.
Fergus Bell is now responsible for making sure the 
global news network takes heed of user-generated content on an international level.
Social media is everywhere, and it’s not leaving any time 
soon. In certain circumstances, I’ll check a social networking site before an actual news source for updates about some-thing.
I suppose people most enjoy the personalization inside 
each tweet, status update, photo upload or blog post.
Social media makes it possible to notify friends and col-
leagues of news stories and events with the click of a share button. From television programs to live events, I can log on to Twitter or Facebook and get a play-by-play of what is hap-pening and how people feel about various topics. The social media world going crazy with comments during each of the recent political debates is just one of many examples.
However, some disagree and think that social media is 
diminishing the value of personal communication between people.
Many complain that we are always “plugged in,” but is 
that necessarily a bad thing?
The sole purpose of social media is to offer more ways to 
connect with people.
We ﬁ  nd out about devastating situations in war-torn 
countries by these nontraditional means. Sometimes such information can only be shared through the posting of user-generated content to social networks.
Social media is also convenient.Television news stations and radio programs have off-
peak hours, while social media does not.
Some news organizations even designate employees to be 
responsible for updating the networks’ social media proﬁ  les all hours of the day with breaking news.
In my opinion, having constant access to news seems to 
keep people more informed by much easier means.
The number of social media networks is continually 
growing.
Different networks cater to different audiences and pro-vide various services, but each is successful in fulﬁ  lling its own speciﬁ  c purpose. Facebook, Twit-ter, Google+, YouTube, Pinterest and Instagram are just a few of the channels that currently see more popular use.
Even in the corporate world, a 
business isn’t fully catering to its customers if it doesn’t have pro-
ﬁ  les on at least a majority of the main social networks.
LinkedIn is a social networking site for professionals. 
Members of the working world can make a proﬁ  le comprised of their resumes, recommendations from references, links to portfolios and more. It’s crazy to be able to say that you got a job or internship essentially through the use of online social networking.
Some feel that social media has been taken out of hand 
and strongly advise against its use. It’s true that people have lost jobs over tweeting messages their supervisors didn’t ap-prove of.
People can also ruin many potential opportunities by 
having unfavorable social networking proﬁ  les.
Several have frowned upon social media use with trends 
such as cyberbullying reaching the public eye.
An optimistic quote says, “If anything can go well, it 
will.” If that’s true, then it’s also fair for pessimists to say , “If anything can go badly , it will.”  
However, I don’t believe social networks were intended 
to provide means for inappropriate behavior or deviant use.
Social media networks should be used for personal, pro-
fessional, political and recreational beneﬁ  ts.
They should have a better reputation. As long as people 
use social media in a responsible manner, it shouldn’t be to blame for some of the issues that will naturally come along with it.
If social media is good enough for the AP , it should be 
good enough for the world’s media consumers.

Since the third and final Presidential 
Debate occurred in Boca Raton last night, 
young people in Florida are wondering, “What about climate change?”
On the subject of climate change and 
clean energy, we’ve heard only silence from President Obama and Gov. Romney.
With new information just released on 
sea levels rising and threatening Florida’s economy (billions of dollars on expendi-tures to mitigate its effects) and  Florida’s communities, climate change is a top issue for Florida voters.
I am a young voter from Gainesville, 
and over the last few weeks, thousands of young people from Florida and across the country have been taking action to break the silence on climate change this election season.
Not only have we been engaging thou-
sands of young voters and getting them out to vote, but we will continue to demand that the candidates address climate change and promote clean energy solutions.
Last night, young voters from Power 
Vote at UF were at the Presidential Debate in Boca Raton to deliver our demands to President Obama and Gov. Romney, to de-mand action on climate change now.

As you may know by now, cyberbullying has 
led to another teen suicide. Amanda Todd was found dead in her home just a few 
weeks ago.
The 15-year-old Canadian was targeted through 
social media, with topless photographs of her being 
posted on Facebook, according to CNN.
Anxiety and depression became issues for the 
teen soon after. Her family relocated for a fresh start. Amanda eventually changed schools, but the photo-graphs still haunted her and reappeared online.
She began drinking and taking drugs. As her 
anxiety worsened, she start-ed cutting herself to cope with her pain.
Todd had attempted 
suicide before by drinking bleach.
She also made a YouTube video one month before 
her suicide. She told her story through flashcards.
While her death is under further investigation, 
cyberbullying is still playing a role in the lives of countless other children.
According to cyberbullying.org, one in four 
young people receive death threats online, and about half of all young Internet users have been vic-tims of cyberbullying. Ten to 20 percent of young people on the Web experience it regularly, accord-ing to bullyingstatistics.org.
The even scarier part is that only one out of ev-
ery 10 children tell their parents about being bullied online.
If you want to make sure the youngsters you 
know are safe, here are some things cyberbullying.org says you should do:
- Talk to children about cyberbullying, and let 
them know about the dangers it can lead to.
- Make sure children know they should talk to an 
adult if they are being cyberbullied.
- Explain to them that they should never share 
anything online or over the phone they wouldn’t want made public.
- Keep the computer in a family space and not in 
a place a teen could be alone with it.
- Make sure you regularly access their accounts 
and monitor their technology usage.
You can read more about cyberbullying at cyber -
bullying.org.
The most important thing we can take from 
Todd’s case is that the young people we know don’t have to share her fate. Make sure you’re involved in what your youngsters are doing online, and make sure they can talk to you about what’s going on. This is a horrible situation that should never be re-peated.

UWireNewsweek magazine has published its print edition 
every week since 1933. Last Thursday , it announced its last print edition will publish in December. Is this 
a reflection of print media in the modern era? Yes and no. But mostly no.
Yes in the sense that, obviously , the Internet was not a factor 
20 years ago and before. And yes in the sense that print media will never again be the biggest thing around like it was in a bygone era — much as radio will never again be the biggest thing around.
But no in the sense that this predominantly reflects on 
Newsweek itself as opposed to the state of print media.
Newsweek completely lost its way over the last few years, 
taking a sharp turn from respectable news to a showcase of sensationalism and controversial covers.
Would a trustworthy news source publish a magazine cover 
on “The 101 Best Places to Eat in the World” featuring a woman opening her mouth to eat a long piece of food in an obvious insinuation of oral sex?
Or their cover of the commander in chief with a rainbow-
colored halo over his head alongside the headline “The First Gay President?”
Contrast this with Time magazine, which has long played 
the role of Newsweek’s “older brother,” if you will. Time is also in some aspects a shadow of its former self: for example, add-ing a regular humor column by Joel Stein to a magazine that formerly never would have considered such an item.
But consider Kurt Andersen’s article “The Protester” from 
last December as Time’s selection for Person of the Year.
He spent two months traveling around the world nonstop 
working on this one story, with the result being perhaps the best journalistic article of last year. For all its faults, Time’s qual-ity never sunk as low as Newsweek’s. And the results showed: While virtually no print publication actually gained circulation over the past decade, Newsweek dropped 52.2 percent since 2000, while since 1997, Time only dropped 19.5 percent.
As a parallel, look at a similar situation from decades ago 
and closer to home: the Hartford Times ceased publication in 1976. Seemingly, if anything, the opposite should have hap-pened. This was right after Watergate, when newspaper subscriptions in-creased. And it was during that great middle era, when television was al-ready established and proven not to 
have killed the newspaper industry as once feared, but the Internet was still a ways off.
So why did the Hartford Times fail? The answer is complex, 
but the biggest reason is simple: The newspaper lost its way.
The Hartford Courant, which already did investigative 
reporting, doubled down on it during the immediate post-Watergate period. And, as occurred when capitalism works its magic, the Courant survived and the Times did not.
As I see it, a comparable situation is what happened with 
Newsweek. Is it partially the modern iPad, Internet and smart-phone environment? No doubt. I am a print media aficionado, but facts are facts.
However, there is also the critical factor that the quality of 
Newsweek started to drastically decline.
In fact, historically speaking, this is a relatively decent time 
for print newspapers and magazines. Many other periods were far worse. Television in the 1950s likely came closer to killing the print industry than the Internet has thus far. If people could see the news occurring visually for free, so the reasoning went, then why would they only read about the news at a monetary cost? Yet the industry survived. And throughout the 1970s and 1980s, many major cities went from having two or three major newspapers to just one.
In a perfect world, no company or product would ever go 
out of business and everyone would be happy . 
Since about 2000 or so, naysayers have said, “Just you see, 
this will be the year all print publications die!” And a few in-deed have, Newsweek among them.
But the death of print journalism is a myth. Some critics are 
quick to jump on the discontinuation of Newsweek as a sign of the death of print journalism. In fact, it is nothing more than the death of Newsweek.

◗ THE STUDY FOUND 
CRAMMING CAN BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.
AYANA STEWART

Austin Mayor watched 20 eco-
nomics lectures in three days.
The 18-year-old accounting 
freshman’s exam was days away, 
and his routine was set. He’d go to class, come home and watch four or five lectures straight.
“It’s what I’ve been doing since 
middle and high school,” he said.
But a recent study from the 
University of California, Los An-geles found that cramming before exams can be counterproductive to academic success. The study said less sleep led to more aca-demic problems.
Cari Gillen-O’Neel, a research-
er with the study, said students who assume all-nighters are ben-eficial might be wrong.
“That’s why they’re sacrific-
ing sleep, because they feel like it works,” she said. “Our data sug-gests the opposite.”
Mayor said he thinks his mem-
ory is good enough to cram right before exams, but he said it’s harder to retain the information he learns.
“Until it becomes a problem, 
I’ll keep doing what works,” he said.
GatorWell health promotion 
specialist Jane Emmeree said col-lege students often have to juggle multiple classes and a lot of dead-lines, which can lead to poor time management.
“They tend to focus on the im-
portant and urgent things,” she said. “They tend to underestimate how long it’s going to take to do something.”
Students should dedicate a few 
hours to studying every week, Emmeree said, even if they don’t have any impending tests.
“We have very bright students, 
and they know what they should be doing,” she said. “It’s just sort-ing it all out.”Study finds students should sleep more, cram  for exams less

Frankie Muniz performed 
in Gainesville on Sunday , but 
he wasn’t the star of this show.
College students may know 
Muniz best for his leading role and cowlicked hair on “Mal-colm in the Middle” in the early 2000s, but now the 26-year-old former actor and race car driv-er sits partially hidden behind the drum set of pop-rock band Kingsfoil. He’s matured since his Agent Cody Banks days,  donning shorter, spiked hair and a goatee.
“His attitude of working 
hard and being on the same lev-el we’re at on how he wants to do things, that sort of inspired all of us to even work harder,” lead vocalist Jordan Davis said.
Kingsfoil played a 40-min-
ute set to a roughly 90-person audience at 1982 on Sunday night.
Before the show, Muniz and 
the other band members chat-ted on the sidewalk of Universi-ty Avenue with students, door -
men and opening acts. It was their first time in Gainesville.
Selina Vargas and her two 
friends traveled two hours to see the band. The 18-year-old Orlando resident said she hoped the band would play her favorite song, “What Your Mother Taught You.”
Jacksonville-based acoustic 
opening act Samuel Sanders said he was impressed with the band’s sound.“It’s kind of rocky but still 
groovy,” he said. “Their melo-dies are super hooky, too.”
After the show, the four 
band members stood at the back of the venue. 
Muniz said he isn’t using  
money from his acting career to financially advance the band.
“We’re not taking any short-
cuts,” Muniz said. “The band right now is completely self-sufficient on its own, and that’s pretty cool.”
Right now the band stuffs 
its members, staff and equipment in a 15-per -
son van and trailer.
“Gas is 
killing us right now,” guitarist  
Tristan Martin said. “We’re only getting five-and-a-half to eight miles a gallon depend-ing on which way the wind is blowing. We’re ready to get out of the van for a while.”
Band members said they be-
lieved Muniz’s past fame from his acting career wouldn’t over -
shadow  the Kingsfoil name.
“Probably within 45 seconds 
of the show starting, they prob-ably completely forget about it,” Muniz said. “If I could hide behind a curtain or have more cymbals to cover me, the bet-ter.”

“By giving away tickets on Twitter, Facebook and 
Instagram, we can keep people in the know,” said SGP public relations vice chair Evan Galin, a 20-year-old public relations junior. “This is the most interactive cam-paign we’ve ever done.”Alex Povella, an 18-year-old biology freshman, won 
a RUB Facebook contest by posing for a picture with a dry erase board promoting the concert. His photo beat out 10 others and earned 133 likes.
RUB bands committee co-chair Izaura Spence, a 
20-year-old finance junior, estimated a total of 50 stu-dents entered the organization’s three social media con-tests. About 2,000 of the 3,000 Passion Pit concert tickets had been sold as of Monday, said SGP vice chair of mar -
keting Tova Miller, a 21-year-old journalism junior.
Four free tickets are still up for grabs. Two winners of 
SGP’s last contest, which references the Passion Pit song “Sleepyhead,” will be selected at 5 p.m. today. Students can enter by tweeting a “sleeping” photo to @UFSGP and including the hashtag #sleepyhead.SGP and RUB hold Passion Pit

Gainesville Police arrested a 
man early Sunday morning after 
officers found him sexually assault-ing a UF student in a field behind Midtown.
Police charged Daniel Hugh 
Moss, 40, of Starke, with sexual as-sault, a second-degree felony, ac-cording to a GPD arrest report.
At about 10 p.m. Saturday, po-
lice received a call from a Swamp Restaurant staff member about Moss leaving the building with an intoxicated woman.
Officer Warren Meek responded 
and patrolled the area for the cou-ple.
As Meek walked by O!O Garden 
Grille, a witness approached him, saying that a woman was “being raped by a guy” in the field at the corner of Northwest 17th Street and Northwest First Avenue.
Meek went to investigate and 
found the woman lying uncon-scious against an oak tree with Moss’ head between her legs.
Meek confronted Moss, who said 
he and the woman were “hanging out,” according to the report.
An ambulance rushed the wom-
an to Shands at UF for a sexual 
battery exam while Meek ques-tioned Moss.
Moss told the 
officer the wom-an approached him at Swamp earlier that eve-
ning, and the two began talking.
At one point, Moss said, the 
woman wanted to “get some air.” He escorted her out of the restau-rant and walked to the field where they began to “make out,” accord-ing to the report.
Moss said he took the woman’s 
underwear off and engaged in a sex act.
Moss added the woman told him 
she wanted to “go all the way” but said he refused because a GPD po-lice car was parked near the field.
Moss then pulled out the wom-
an’s underwear, which he had in his pocket, according to the report.
Meanwhile, GPD detectives in-
terviewed the woman at the hospi-tal.
The woman said she did not 
know Moss and that earlier in the evening, he proposed doing “nasty things” to her. She remembered leaving the bar but could not recall how she ended up in the field with Moss.
Police arrested and later booked 
Moss into Alachua County Jail at about 12:30 a.m. Sunday with a $100,000 bond. He was released later that day.

Matty Love’s classes require 
hands-on learning, but for him, this 
doesn’t just mean inside the class-room. In fact, it is not unusual for Love to bring his work home with him — literally.
The 19-year-old animal sciences 
sophomore is in the process of pre-serving a raw cowhide in his living room.
With a huge tarp covering the 
floor and Enya playing in the back-ground, Love began preserving his proudly purchased hide with a knife and some salt. It didn’t smell, so his roommates didn’t mind.
Love got hooked on the beef 
industry last semester after tak-ing a class called The Meat We Eat. He ended up changing his major from engineering. This Fall, Love is taking classes like Careers in the Livestock Industry. He works with pigs, sheep and cows from the mo-ment they walk in the “classroom” until they are slabs of meat being prepared for wholesale and retail buyers.
Earlier this month, Love’s 27-stu-
dent Meat class began their work with cows.
After the class watched instruc-
tional videos, read lab manuals and reviewed standard operating procedures, they suited up in their slaughter-day attire: old jeans, T-shirts and boots, waterproof aprons, two layers of gloves, a hair net and a hard hat.
Cows were brought in and 
stunned, making them numb to pain. Each was then hoisted up by its rear leg, and its carotid artery was severed to drain blood.
The groups of students removed their cow’s head, hide and organs and then cut it down the middle into two halves. After the spinal cord was extracted, they weighed, washed and sprayed the cow with an organic sanitizing spray.
“Since I heard about us doing the beef slaughter, I was really looking forward to the possibility of getting to tan and preserve the beefhide of my first cow,” Love said.
After his lab, Love asked Byron 
Davis, the manager of the meat-processing center, about purchas-ing the hide. About $25 later, Love wrapped his cowhide in a couple of bags and put it in his truck. He also picked up 150 pounds of salt.
Love had tried to preserve the 
sheepskin from his sheep slaughter lab as a test run a few weeks before, but raccoons and cats found the skin outside and soiled it with urine after only a few days.
This time, Love and a friend 
worked inside. They cut away the extra fat tissue and leftover meat. The two then smoothed salt over the surface, moving on their hands and knees to make sure it would preserve evenly.
Davis said selling hides to stu-
dents isn’t a regular procedure, but “because he is a student in the class, I made an exception.”
Usually the hides and meat are 
sold to predetermined buyers.
“For us to have the animals 
available to use in the class, we actually have to buy the animals,” Davis said. “They are university-raised cows, [and] in order to offset the price of the animals, we turn around and sell the meat.”
As for Love’s living-room pres-
ervation experiment, the hide is al-most ready. He’ll ship it out on Fri-day to Sebring Custom Tanning to have it professionally tanned.
“If all goes well, I’ll get it back 10 
months later,” Love said.
Then, he might have a more 
common reason for having a hide in his living room — he may use it as a rug.TUESDAY, OCTOBER 23, 2012 � ALLIGATOR,9

Florida hoops projected for second-place ﬁ  nish
A media poll released Monday predicts UF will ﬁ  nish second 
to Kentucky in the SEC. Kenny Boynton is on the All-SEC ﬁ  rst team, and Patric Young owns a spot on the second team. After missing the end of 2011-12 with an injury, Will Yeguete bulked up to prepare for time at center. See story, page 16.

Senior linebacker Jon Bostic (1) runs down South Carolina quarterback Connor Shaw during 
Florida’s 44-11 win on Saturday at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium. Bostic ﬁ  nished with four tackles. 
 �JON BOSTIC AND JELANI JENKINS 
ARE THRIVING IN THEIR SECOND SEASON UNDER DAN QUINN. 
  JOSH JURNOVOY
 Alligator Staff Writer
   
 Jon Bostic and Jelani Jenkins only 
needed to get comfortable.
  Prior to 2011, Florida’s veteran line-
backers had never played in the same 
system for more than one season.
  “This is pretty much the ﬁ  rst time 
we’re actually able to go into another year with the same defensive coordina-tor,” Bostic said. “Every year we’ve been running a new defense. This is the ﬁ  rst year we’ve actually been able to stay in the same defense.”
  When Bostic and Jenkins ﬁ  rst arrived 
on campus in 2009, Charlie Strong was the defensive coordinator. He left to take the head coaching job at Louisville the following season. 
  Strong was replaced by Teryl Austin, 
who left after one season when Urban Meyer stepped down.
  Will Muschamp was hired to replace 
Meyer, and he brought Dan Quinn aboard as the new defensive coordinator. Under Quinn, the unit ﬁ  nished eighth in the country in total defense in 2011. Bostic said remaining in the same scheme has allowed the linebackers to better address the few issues they had last season.
  “(We’re) able to improve and take 
things from last year,” Bostic said. 
  Muschamp said he has seen Bostic 
make signiﬁ  cant strides. 
  “Bostic is playing as well as any line-
backer in the country,” Muschamp said. “He’s playing really well, and he disen-gages on blocks. All the things we really presented to him last season of getting stronger, getting ﬁ  rmer with his hands in short-area contact where he’s got to get off blocks and shed.”
  The linebackers have not only im-
proved individually, but as a unit. Jen-kins missed two games earlier in the season due to a fractured thumb and said the unit is more cohesive when the entire group is healthy.
  “Me and Bostic being out there, and 
even Mike Taylor and Antonio (Morri-son), I think we all do a good job of com-municating,” Jenkins said. “When we’re able to communicate and know what each other are doing every play, it makes it a lot easier. Because sometimes we’re moving fast and sometimes we forget.”
  Bostic and Muschamp cited improved Linebackers beneﬁ  ting from experience in system 
  JOE MORGAN
 Alligator Staff Writer
   
 When Florida was ranked second 
in the initial BCS standings, coach Will Muschamp had one message for his team: ignore the polls.
  “I sat with them [on Oct. 15] 
and said ‘Let’s have a conversation about the BCS and the AP and the UPI and the USA Today and all the polls,’” Muschamp said after Satur-day’s game. “’Is any of that infor-mation going to help us win against South Carolina?’ They all agreed that it wasn’t going to help us.”
  After defeating the Gamecocks 
44-11 on Saturday, the Gators maintained their No. 2 BCS rank-ing. With a victory against Georgia, Florida will clinch the Southeastern Conference Eastern Division and move one step closer to a national championship.
  However, Muschamp again 
downplayed the big picture on Monday.
  “When there 
is obvious pos-sible distractions for your football team, you can stick your head in the sand and pre-tend everything’s 
OK, or you can 
address it with them, and that’s what I choose to do,” Muschamp said. “So, I address things and say, ‘All right, if we need to talk about it, let’s talk about it.’ And we’ll all agree that we don’t need to.”
    Muschamp does not expect to  Gators still downplaying 
hype of No. 2 BCS rankingTHE ADAM BOMB
Muschamp’s energy reviving UF SEE LINEBACKERS, PAGE 14
SEE NOTES, PAGE 14  At Auburn, he said 
“Boom, mother f#@%*!” on national 
television after his defense forced a punt in the third quar-ter. 
  At Texas, he began bleed-
ing from his ear after the Longhorns’ secondary made an early mistake in a 42-point blowout of Florida Atlantic.
  At Florida, he’s been crowd 
surﬁ  ng after big wins and yelling during halftime inter-views.
  Will Muschamp isn’t one to 
mess with.
  The Gainesville native ar-
rived at Florida two years ago expecting to turn around a program suffering a Tebow hangover and in need of new energy.
  After a season in which 
Muschamp’s ﬁ  ery ways couldn’t overcome a lack of physicality and depth, the Gators are one win away from clinching a Southeastern Con-ference title game appearance.
  Teams ranging from cellar 
dweller Kentucky to perennial power LSU have felt Florida’s wrath. 
  This team isn’t just good. 
They’re downright scary to play against, and the unpre-dictable ways of coach Boom are the reason why.
  Before Muschamp, Florida 
had Urban Meyer. Although he won two national titles at UF, there was something awry about Meyer’s last season.
  Meyer always seemed dis-
interested, often standing on the sidelines with his arms crossed. He left Florida due to personal reasons after an 8-5 season in 2010. The ultimate micromanager worked himself out of Gainesville.
  Meyer’s tenure is a touchy 
subject in the Gators locker room.
  Players don’t like talking about him, and there was nev-er a true answer about the rea-sons behind his departure.
  “[Muschamp] treats us as 
adults,” Buck linebacker Ler-entee McCray said on Aug. 6, 2011 regarding the difference between the two coaches. 
  Whether or not that’s true 
is an issue for another day, but what can’t be argued is the energy that came from players like Brandon Siler, Tim Tebow and Brandon Spikes.
    With the emotional leaders 
of the two national champion-ship teams gone, the Gators looked ﬂ  at in Meyer’s ﬁ  nal season.

Damien Jacobs (4) gets helped off the field during Florida’s 44-
11 win against South Carolina on Saturday in The Swamp.
Florida not likely to discuss rankings
address the BCS rankings with his 
team again, but said he is willing to do so if the seniors feel it is necessary. Becoming preoccupied with rank-ings is an unlikely problem for the players, especially considering their hesitation to address the implications of Florida’s de facto SEC East cham-pionship game against Georgia on Saturday.
“It’s another SEC opponent for 
us,” Jon Bostic said. “That’s how we’ve got to look at it. We’ve got to prepare the same way we’ve been preparing for pretty much every SEC opponent we’ve played this year. We can’t change our preparation.”
“If you lose, you don’t go any-
where,” Frankie Hammond Jr. said. “There’s conversations about this and that, where we can go, ranking and stuff like that. But (if) you lose to Georgia ... all of it falls apart.”
Christy earns SEC honor: Punter 
Kyle Christy was named the SEC Spe-cial Teams Player of the Week for his efforts against South Carolina. Chris-ty set a single-game school record by averaging 54.3 yards per punt. 
He recorded a season-best 62-yard 
punt during the first quarter against the Gamecocks.
“It’s been outstanding for our foot-
ball team this year,” Muschamp said. “He’s a been a guy that’s flipped the field, created momentum, (and) hung some punts up there.”
Injury update: Damien Jacobs did not 
practice on Monday, but Muschamp expects the defensive tackle to return to practice on Tuesday. 
Muschamp said Jacobs is “prob-
able” for Saturday’s game against Georgia.
Jacobs injured his hamstring on Saturday against South Carolina but told reporters after the game that he was “fine.”
Latroy Pittman returned to prac-
tice on Monday, but his status for Sat-urday remains in question. Pittman injured his ankle against Vanderbilt on Oct. 13 in Nashville, Tenn.
Matt Patchan (strained pectoral) 
and Cody Riggs (fractured right foot) will miss Saturday’s game.

depth in the group as an area of 
improvement. Neiron Ball, who missed all of 2011 while recov-ering from a congenital condi-tion, has seen significant time at Sam linebacker. Ball and backup Darrin Kitchens have combined for 17 tackles, including one and a half for a loss. True freshman Morrison filled in at the Will spot in Jenkins’ absence. Bostic said he sees his less-
experienced teammates getting better as the season progresses.
“Mike, and Antonio coming 
in as a freshman, both of those guys bring something different to the table and (are) only go-ing to get better,” Bostic said. “Each and every week, they’re learning from the mistakes that I make or Jelani makes. … They’re learning as they go and it’s only going to help them.”

After suffering growing pains in Muschamp’s 
first season, these Gators are a year older, a year healthier and have taken on the personality of their coach.
Florida is playing the smash-mouth, angry brand 
of football that brought them an unexpected BCS championship in 2006. In 2008, UF won on supreme talent.
“He’s a high-energy guy,” quarterback Jeff 
Driskel said of Muschamp on Saturday. “He’s go-ing to be there during practice, and he’s going to be there during games. He’s not going to change.”
In the locker room after defeating LSU on Oct. 6, 
Muschamp interrupted his own postgame speech by jumping on his players, who held him up in celebra-tion.
Muschamp tackled linebacker Jelani Jenkins on the sidelines after his second-quarter interception against South Carolina. The play was eventually called back due to an offside penalty.
During a local radio interview at halftime on Sat-
urday, Muschamp couldn’t control his emotions re-garding Florida’s 21-6 lead against South Carolina and some of the questionable calls that were made in the first 30 minutes.
“We just have to continue to capitalize on what 
we’re doing and OVERCOME THE ADVERSITY ON THE FIELD!” 
Yes, the capital letters are necessary. Muschamp 
almost took off interviewer Brady Ackerman’s head.
Who wouldn’t want to play for a guy who cares 
that much about his football team?
“He’s a players’ coach,” linebacker Jon Bostic said 
before last season. “He can relate to the players and get players going.”
The coach who used to attend Gator games as a 
kid has brought a swagger back into a football pro-gram that desperately needed it.

The Gators fired the lone under-
par score in the second round of the 
Isleworth Collegiate Invitational on Monday to move within four strokes of first-place California.No. 6 Florida struggled down 
the stretch in the first round of play but responded with a second-round 286 (-2) to leapfrog five spots into third place. 
UF overtook No. 3 Alabama 
and No. 8 Arkansas in the second round due largely to the collective efforts of Tyler McCumber, T.J. Vo-gel  and J.D. Tomlinson. 
“Today we had several good 
scores,” coach Buddy Alexander said.
McCumber was a driving force 
behind Florida’s surge, finishing the second round with a tourna-ment-low 68 (-4). McCumber start-ed strong, turning in two of his three birdies and an eagle through the first seven holes. 
He sits in a three-way tie for 
second place with a two-under tournament total. California’s Mi-chael Kim is in first at five-under.
Vogel followed suit, carding 
a 70 (-2) to move up 15 spots on the individual leaderboard. Vogel notched five birdies in the round, including four on the back nine. 
The Cooper City native has shot even-par through two rounds, good 
for a three-way tie for seventh place. He began the day tied for 22nd. 
Tomlinson was the third and fi-
nal Gator to finish at or under par for the round. He turned in a bal-anced round of 72 (E). 
“Our three best players really 
turned it up today,” Alexander said. “Tyler was terrific, T.J. had a great rally at the end and J.D. was solid, as well.”
Tommy Mou and A.J. Crouch 
rounded out the Gators’ lineup, turning in round scores of 76 (+4) and 78 (+6), respectively. 
“There is still a lot of golf left to 
be played,” Alexander said. “We are playing with some of the best teams out there and need to have five good scores tomorrow.”
Florida takes the course today 
to round out the fall season with the third and final round of the tournament.

After competing in 36 
NCAA singles matches, Flor -
ida junior Florent Diep won 
his first tournament champi-onship on Monday. 
Sixth-seeded Diep sealed 
the championship when he took down Georgia State’s Victor Valente 6-0, 6-3 on Monday to claim the 2012 USTA/ITA Southeast Re-gional Championships in Tal-lahassee.
Of his six matches in the 
regional tournament, 101st-ranked Diep won four in two sets. He won the first set five times. 
Coach Bryan Shelton said 
Florida’s ability to stay posi-tive and composed when faced with adversity was  one of the highlights of the weekend’s action. Diep was a prime example.
Diep and Shelton said the 
tournament victory was fu-eled not by Diep’s perfor -
mance in the semifinals or the finals, but by a clutch show-ing in the quarterfinals.
Diep faced his stiffest test 
against Georgia’s Hernus Pi-eters in the quarterfinals.
Pieters, ranked 36th na-
tionally, won the first set against Diep on Sunday af-ternoon, seemingly gaining a mental edge.
“I got frustrated, but I had 
to step back and take it a play at a time,” Diep said of the quarterfinals match.
Diep stepped up, upset-
ting Pieters 3-6, 6-4, 6-4.
“Everyone knows [Diep] 
can play at a high level,” Shelton said. “He is brilliant on the mental side of things. If he loses a point, he moves on to the next point, and if he wins a point, he will continue to do what he is doing.”
Shelton said Diep’s come-
from-behind win vaults him into a leadership position. 
“He is a great striker of 
the ball,” Shelton said. “He 
was mak-
ing good d e c i s i o n s and playing smart. He is growing in confidence after six sin-gles wins.”
As for 
Diep, he simply used the word “happy” to describe his feeling after the tournament win.
With the victory, Diep 
earned an automatic berth into the USTA/ITA National Indoor Intercollegiate Cham-pionships on Nov. 8-11 in Flushing, N.Y.
Shelton said he believes 
Diep can continue to succeed with the same mentality he had in the quarterfinals and the entire tournament: Focus-ing on the next shot rather than the finish line.Junior wins first singles

While the Gators were practic-
ing on the court before the NCAA 
Tournament, Will Yeguete was busy in the weight room. 
After missing UF’s final nine 
games last year with a fractured left foot, the 6-foot-7 Yeguete add-ed 16 pounds during the offseason to put his weight at 240. The ju-nior forward said he has dropped about 1 to 2 percent of his body fat since last season. 
Yeguete said he bulked up to 
prepare for minutes at center.
Junior center Patric Young saw 
the difference in Yeguete’s con-ditioning while guarding him in practice. 
“It’s a big improvement from 
last year,” Young said. “He doesn’t get pushed around any-more at all. He’s made his pres-ence very known, especially in the post offensively and defensively. It’s really hard to push that guy anywhere anymore.”
Yeguete attributes his im-
proved physique to the non-tra-ditional workouts of strength and conditioning coordinator Preston Greene. Throughout the offsea-son, Greene had the Gators push-ing and pulling trucks, flipping tires and running with 150-pound punching bags. 
“At the end of the summer, 
you’re like, ‘Wow, I really gained like 15 to 20 pounds,’” Yeguete said. “We just went through so much grinding every week. Pres-ton had us going really hard every single day.” 
Yeguete thinks his chiseled 
frame will help his post game. He averaged 4.4 points per game in 26 contests last season. 
Although his offensive reper -
toire is usually limited to dunks and layups, Yeguete shot 58.1 per -
cent from the field in 2011-12, the second-best clip on the team after Young (.618). 
Yeguete was one of Florida’s 
best defenders last season, av-eraging 1.2 steals per game and a team-high 11.5 rebounds per 40 minutes. He also drew nine charges, which was third best on the squad.
Although Yeguete is mostly 
practicing at power forward and center, coach Billy Donovan is ex-perimenting with Yeguete playing all three frontcourt positions.
“I’m willing to do anything for 
the team,” Yeguete said. “I per -
sonally think I can guard a small forward. If we want to try it out, I’d be willing to do that.”
Harris has surgery: Damontre 
Harris underwent successful surgery on Monday to repair a labrum tear in his shoulder. The 6-foot-10 center will be out of full-contact practice for four to six months, Donovan said. 
Harris, a South Carolina trans-
fer, suffered the dislocated shoul-der and labrum tear when a team-mate fell on him in practice more than a week ago. 
He begins his rehab today and 
will wear a sling for six weeks. Donovan hopes to have Harris back for non-contact drills in De-cember.

Kayla Lewis has had trouble 
staying on the court during 
her first two seasons with the Gators. 
As a true freshman, she 
missed 19 games due to multi-ple leg injuries. Last season, she appeared in just three games before suffering a stress frac-ture in her foot against Florida State on Nov . 17. She received a medical redshirt.
Lewis battled another injury 
during the summer, eventually undergoing surgery to repair a hernia.
On the court, Lewis has 
shown flashes of the talent that helped her become Miss Georgia Basketball in 2010. The problem has been staying healthy.
“Frustrating is one word that 
you could use,” coach Amanda Butler said. 
Lewis offered a more 
pointed view: “Injuries always suck.”
Her most recent ailment has 
been the most unusual. 
In late August, Lewis began 
experiencing discomfort in her abdomen. One day , her belly button appeared to pop out.
Doctors diagnosed her with 
a hernia. Surgery was one pos-sibility , but the oft-injured Lewis was hesitant to miss time during the preseason, so she considered playing through the injury . After talking it over with 
family and the coaching staff, she decided to undergo surgery early in September. 
“I was kind of bummed be-
cause it took me out for four weeks in the preseason,” she said. “But there was no upside to it. It could only have gotten worse.”
With the season less than 
three weeks away , Lewis has no limitations. 
She received a platelet-rich 
plasma injection following the surgery to help expedite her re-
covery.
Lewis is 
attempting to regain the form that made her the first true freshman to start a sea-son-opener 
for Florida since Sha Brooks in 2005. 
“Kayla makes such a differ -
ence,” Butler said. “Her length and athleticism is really some-thing that is impactful when she is on the floor.”
Freshman Sydney Moss 
received an up-close view of Lewis’ athleticism while play-ing pick-up basketball during the summer.
“I was guarding her, and 
I boxed her out and jumped to go get the ball,” Moss said. “She jumped right over me and grabbed it. 
“Having her is really going 
to help this team.”Sophomore healthy
