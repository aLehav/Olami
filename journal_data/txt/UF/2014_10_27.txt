Bats, pumpkins and thousands of fami-
lies traipsed through the fall air — but this 
wasn’t Halloween.
About 4,500 people swarmed to the 
Lubee Bat Conservancy’s 110-acre ranch for its 10th annual bat festival on Satur-day. Eleven different species and 200 indi-
vidual bats were on display at the ranch, 
located at 1309 NW 192nd Ave.
The most popular exhibit at the free 
festival was the bats, which hung off the top of their metal-wired cages like clothes 
hangers. Bat lovers of all ages lined up 
to “ooh” and “ah” at the enormity of the large ﬂ  ying fox, which can have a wing-span of up to six feet.
Among the other featured bat spe-
cies were the little golden-mantled ﬂ  ying fox and the Rodrigues fruit bat, which munched on hanging, fruit-ﬁ  lled pump-kins and kabobs that speared apple, ba-
nana and watermelon.
Bat keeper Jade Salamone said the con-
servancy is typically closed to the public throughout the year.
“It’s a really great opportunity for peo-
ple to come out and see what we’re do-
ing,” Salamone said. “Plus, it’s fun for the 
bats. They get to show off for people.”
This year’s bat festival celebrated Lu-
bee’s 25th year as a foundation. In 1993, 
Lubee began focusing on Old World fruit bat research and conservation, and since its founding in 1989, it has funded and conducted ﬁ  eld projects in 19 countries.
One successful endeavor has been the 
Lubee-funded programs in Rodrigues Island. In 1979, there were no more than 75 Rodrigues fruit bats worldwide. To-
day, more than 16,000 fruit bats live in the 
wild.
Director Brian Pope said this engage-
ment with the community will help with their mission. He said he’s seen the bat festival’s attendance grow from 60 to more than 4,300 people in its 10 years.  
“We want to show people all the posi-
tive things that we’re doing and that we’re making a positive inﬂ  uence,” Pope said.
One of Lubee’s new focuses is to en-
courage people to build bat houses in their backyards, Salamone said. These small bat houses are about the size of a newspaper stand and can house 50 to 200 bats at a time. Each bat can eat up to 1,000 
insects per hour, Salamone said.
“A lot of people have told me they

After two transgender Santa Fe 
College students were heckled leaving 
a school bathroom, followed through campus to their car and chased to a nearby Publix grocery store this Feb-
ruary, leading them to drop out of 
school, the incident ignited a ﬂ  ame that helped pass a protective measure for all students last week, regardless of race, gender or sexual orientation.
Rule 2.8 was three years in the 
making and passed in the Career Ser-vice Council last Wednesday after be-ing shot down in the same committee 
twice prior.
If approved by the college’s Board of Trustees this semester, the measure 
could defend students like the trans-gender couple against future cases of harassment and discrimination.
“The incident has put my school 
plans on the back burner,” one of the former students involved in the trans-gender harassment incident said. “It’s also motivated me to be more engaged with social justice issues.”
When the couple was initially 
catcalled, ridiculed and chased, the former student — who requested to 
remain anonymous — said they re-
ported the incident to Santa Fe Police. But after ofﬁ  cers ﬁ  rst checked security footage and failed to ﬁ  nd signiﬁ  cant Santa Fe College passes

Construction on the new 
undergraduate entrepreneur-
ship building, Inﬁ  nity Hall, 
has kicked off.
Gainesville Mayor Ed Brad-
dy and UF President Bernie 
Machen took part in the dorm’s 
groundbreaking ceremony on 
Thursday.
The facility, owned by Sig-
net Enterprises, is set to open by Fall 2015. Construction is ex-
pected to last through the end 
of July 2015, according to Chris Gregory, project manager of Brasﬁ  eld & Gorrie, a privately 
owned construction company 
headlining the project.
“We coordinate closely with the Housing and Resi-dence Education staff and the design team at Perkins + Will 
to ensure In-
ﬁ  nity Hall 
is consistent with the standards of 
H o u s i n g ’ s 
other new facilities as well as the 
entrepreneurship curriculum 
and lifestyle intended for In-
ﬁ  nity Hall students,” he wrote in an email.
Inﬁ  nity Hall will offer 308 
beds, and facility operations will be managed by Signet En-terprises.
The 92,000-square-foot proj-
ect will cost about $15.9 mil-
lion, according to a Brasﬁ  eld & Gorrie press release.
Across the street from the 
Innovation Square, the resi-
dence hall will be located two blocks from the university and 
six blocks from downtown 
Gainesville.
The new community will 
be the country’s ﬁ  rst entre-preneurial academic residen-
tial community. It will feature 
four ﬂ  oors of residential living space, team meeting rooms, space for the university’s en-
trepreneurship programs and 
a resident maintenance shop.

More than 5,000 people ﬂ  ocked to 
Ward’s Supermarket’s 63rd Anniversary 
Fall Food Festival on Saturday, where families and fresh foods packed vendor tents and lined the parking lot.
The festival was free to the public and 
featured local vendors like The Hyppo, Gville Sweets, Sweetwater and Shaw-nee’s Greenthumb Popcorn. Some busi-nesses traveled for the event, like Spring Head Ranch, which came from Lake City, Florida, and Fireﬂ  y Farm, which came from Brooker, Florida.
Local vendor Susan Niemann started 
her soap company, Thrive Handcrafts, about three years ago.
She said as a full-time mom, the 
chemicals and preservatives in soaps concerned her, so she came up with her own recipes. She used cold-pressed veg-etable oils, steam-distilled oils and other natural additives.
Her soaps are mostly vegan and 
vegetarian, with the exception of milk, beeswax and honey. For fragrances and ﬂ  avors, she uses natural ingredients like coffee and tea, as well as clay for color. 
“I wanted to make a pink soap for my 
daughter, so I asked her, ‘What should it be called?’ and she said, ‘Fairy Sparkle,’” Neimann said. “Fairy Sparkle is a mix of lavender, grapefruit and mint.”
UF psychology junior Christian Gar-
cia said it was his ﬁ  rst time going.
“I like that I can visit each tent and 
talk to the owners who are producing the food and making the products,” the 22-year-old said. “I don’t have to search the company online and read about them. Instead, I can ask the owner questions in person.”MONDAY, OCTOBER 27, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 3

A state law passed to allow universities to plan future 
development, as well as future conservation. The legislature awarded UF and nine other universities $4.3 million to create long-range development and conservation plans in compli-
ance with the statute. The “physical master plan” projected the 
university’s image for the following 10 years.
Oct. 30, 2001
A local woman led a slow-speed chase through a Wal-Mart 
and its parking lot, which ended with  a charge of strong-arm 
robbery and an employee with scratches on his left hand. Lola Mae Monroe, a 69-year-old Gainesville woman, was seen pock-eting $5 worth of makeup as she ﬂ  ed the store. The employee chased her out into the parking lot, wanting her to come back into the store. She hit and attempted to bite him, eventually throwing merchandise at his back.
Oct. 29, 2009As UF tested the UFAlert system — about a month after re-
leasing the Emergency Zombie Attack plan — a horde of zom-bies limped and moaned its way across campus. UF improv 
group Theatre Strike Force organized the ﬂ  ash mob, which in-
cluded about 30 zombies chasing the one human of the group. They wore face paint and tattered clothes, to the amusement of many passers-by. Skyler Kern, vice president of the group, played the human being chased by the zombies. He was de-voured outside of Library West.
Oct. 24, 2011The traditional antique cars drove down West University 
Avenue to end up on Bo Diddley Community Plaza for the Pride Parade. The Occupy Gainesville group watched on, re-naming itself at Occu-Pride Gainesville in honor of the occa-sion. “This Occupy ‘America’ is revolutionary,” said Joy Rev-
els, grand marshal. “In 50 years, we could be celebrating the 
taking back of our country. I would walk in that.” Another ﬁ  rst for the 10th annual parade was the addition of a U.S. Marine Corps tent, now able to openly recruit LGBT soldiers after the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.”
— KRISTAN WIGGINSvisual evidence, Police Chief 
Ed Book said the investigation came to a standstill.
Still, Student Government 
Senate President Jeremy Pierce, 
former SG Treasurer Kentucky 
Costellow and At-Large Sen. Wallace Mazon supported the students’ statements.
“I never went back to class 
after that day, and I dropped out,” the student said. “My partner never returned to cam-pus.”
The Career Service Council 
passed the protection measure last week with about 63 percent of votes — a progressive move for the typically conservative council, said Nina Trombi, the council’s chair.
The council is a self-govern-
ing, self-supporting organiza-
tion that represents the inter-
ests of Santa Fe, and Pierce said it has influence over different aspects of the college.
Trombi said she voted in 
favor of the amendment both times it previously failed but attributed its two initial failures to its wording rather than its 
implications.
“These people who voted 
against it were afraid of — say, 
someone was gender-fluid — that’s not necessarily something that’s specifically mentioned in any law or language, but if Santa Fe wanted to protect peo-ple who declared themselves 
gender-fluid, would people 
feel comfortable with that?” Trombi said. “And they said no because it’s not necessarily against the law to discriminate against those people.”
Trombi continued, adding 
that the council was leery about protecting a class of people that 
was not protected by the fed-
eral government.
“Regardless of whether it’s 
right or wrong, they were look-ing more at the law because it can be different,” she said. “But now it’s protected under the law.”
Trombi added that the Ca-
reer Service Council is now “very proud” the measure passed.
Pierce speculates that due to 
the nature of the measure, the reason the amendment was ul-
timately passed in the council is 
because “opinions evolve over time.”
“I feel like in the history, 
their opinions — as it relates to sexual orientation being part of the mission statement — hadn’t quite evolved,” Pierce said, “but obviously those opinions 
evolved, and I feel like (Santa Fe 
President Jackson) Sasser was a steward in helping evolve those opinions, reminding all govern-ing branches that the college’s goal is to become preeminent and remain preeminent.”
Mazon, the senator who 
wrote Rule 2.8, said when he 
heard about the incident in-
volving the transgender stu-dents, the 20-year-old Santa Fe philosophy sophomore decided to “keep shaking the bush” and pass the legislation.
Though it did pass and pro-
gressed to the board, Mazon still has his gripes.
“Santa Fe isn’t as progres-
sive as I’d like it to be,” he said. “It’s kind of sad when politics get in the way of bettering the campus for students.”
Still, he said the Career Ser-
vice Council’s most recent rul-ing was encouraging.
“Just seeing how this got 
passed makes me really happy that we’re taking the right foot-ing to making this campus the best it can be,” he said.
Santa Fe wants to make sure 
the college will not tolerate any form of discrimination, includ-ing that against transgender students, Sasser said. 
While the measure has yet 
to be passed by the Board of Trustees, Sasser said, “I trust they will see the value of it and support it.”want to do this,” she said. “It’s great because it can 
help make up for the loss of the bats’ habitats.”
Madison Surguine and her family traveled two 
hours from Clermont to see the bats. 
In a raffle at the festival, the 17-year-old won bat-
shaped chew toys and dog treats for her German Shepherd, Lyra.  “This event has actually made me decide that I 
want to volunteer at a place like this back home,” she said.
Jim McNabb, 72, drove from Orlando to see the 
bats with his 4-year-old granddaughter. He said he 
read a book about bats to his granddaughter Friday 
night to prepare her for the festival.
“I thought it was great,” McNabb said. “I’ve nev-
er seen bats as big as that.”4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, OCTOBER 27, 2014

Amber Rohlman felt her stom-
ach doing flips that she later rep-
licated out on the water on her wakeboard Sunday.
Rohlman, 22, competed in this 
year’s USA Wakeboard Southeast Regionals held at Lake Wauburg. Rohlman participated in the event with the Florida State University wakeboard team.
She said she was nervous on the 
dock but excited out on the water.
Rohlman was a part of one of 
eight teams who participated in the competition. Teams from UF, FSU, University of South Florida, University of West Florida, Rollins College, University of Central Flor-ida, University of Georgia and Uni-versity of South Carolina showed up at the lake at 8 a.m.
Dixie Smith, 20-year-old UF 
Wakeboard Club president, said the teams consisted of a male or female wakeskater, the four best men and the two best women of each team.
Smith, a UF biology senior, 
competed with the UF team in the Women’s A category alongside 
Rohlman.Rohlman won first place in the 
Women’s A division, and UF won 
the overall competition.
Judges scored the competitors 
out of 100 points according to am-plitude, style, level of difficulty and fundamentals of their tricks, Smith said. She planned five flips, includ-ing at least two backflips and a 180-
degree spin, for her routine.
Smith said her job as president included making the visiting teams 
feel at home.
“My No. 1 thought is always 
like, ‘I hope no one gets hurt and everyone’s happy,” she said.
The UF wakeboard team paid 
$200 out-of-pocket to cover the 
USA Water Ski, UF and Centurion 
insurance policies. Centurion, along with O’Neill and Rockstar Energy Drink, was one of the event’s main sponsors and provided all teams with the competition boat used to pull the wakeboarders.
To register, competitors paid $25 
in advance and $30 at the venue, 
but the event was free to the public. The UF Wakeboard Club funded 
the event with sponsorship money, but the registration fees served as a fundraiser for the team.
During the event’s downtimes, 
the local band Pompeii Gift Shop played an hourlong set and the an-
nouncers judged grape toss com-
petitions and oversaw a Cornhole tournament.
Patrick Volum, a 21-year-old 
FSU senior, said he could feel the camaraderie at the lake’s South Shore and had a great time all weekend.
“I feel surprisingly welcome,” 
he said.

berg said Sunday that the average for regular-grade gas is $3.08 per gallon, while midgrade averages $3.31 and premium $3.47. Retail die-
sel averages $3.67.
Lundberg said the price has 
dropped 65 cents since its peak in May and is 29 cents below what it was last year.
She said the drop has been driv-
en by a decrease in the price of crude 
oil.
In the lower 48 states, San Fran-
cisco had the highest average price at $3.45 per gallon, while Memphis, Tennessee, had the lowest average at $2.73.

A Gainesville man was ar-
rested early Saturday after po-
lice said he punched the owner of The JAM in the face as he was kicked out of the bar.
At about 1:45 a.m., Tarvell 
Marquis McRae approached a woman at the bar from behind and wrapped his arms around her without her permission. The owner of the bar, located at 817 W. University Ave., told McRae, 22, to leave. When McRae ignored him, the owner 
pushed McRae toward the exit, 
according to police.
Once outside, McRae repeat-
edly punched the owner in the face, causing the owner’s two front teeth to break, police said. The owner also had a bruise above his eye.
McRae was arrested on felo-
ny battery charges. His bond is set at $5,000.

A Gainesville man was ar-
rested Saturday morning after police said he hit and strangled 
the mother of his child.
The victim told police that 
Roderick Deon Watson, 31, got 
angry and began calling her a “whore” after he received a phone call at about 11:30 a.m., according to a report. The vic-tim and her two children — one of whom is Watson’s child — 
walked out of the house, locat-
ed at 1012 SE 10th Terrace.
Watson then followed her 
outside, told the children to go back inside and started shoving and hitting the woman in the face with open hands. He then started to strangle the woman, who told police she couldn’t 
breathe and thought she was 
going to pass out.
After Watson released his 
grip, the woman went inside to get her children. Watson fol-lowed the woman and contin-ued to yell at her.
The woman picked up Wat-
son’s child as Watson contin-
ued to hit her in the face, giving 
the woman a bloody cut on her lower lip, police said. The wom-an told police the child she was holding was scared and crying.
“Stop that crying like a little 
bitch,” Watson said to the child. “What you crying for?”
Watson left the house on 
foot, and the woman called po-lice. Officers found Watson a few blocks away at 900 SE Wil-liston Road.
Watson was arrested on two 
battery charges and one charge 
of child abuse. His bond is set 
at $35,000.
A 25-year-old man was ar-
rested early Sunday after po-lice said he pushed a woman pregnant with his child into a bathtub.
Joshua Ryan Palmer and 
the victim, who is eight weeks pregnant with his child, got into an argument over Palmer having a criminal record at about 12:30 p.m. Saturday, a re-port said. The victim found out Palmer was hiding marijuana in their house, located at 710 SW 16th Ave.
When she tried flushing 
the marijuana down the toilet, Palmer pushed the victim, caus-ing her to fall into the bathtub, which she said bruised her left arm and made her back sore.
Palmer told the woman he 
should “just hit her one good time, in the stomach and end 
her pregnancy,” according to 
the report. 
He left the residence before 
police arrived, and the victim filed a sworn statement.
After police investigated 
the incident, the victim called and said Palmer returned to the apartment at about 3:30 p.m. and took her TV, DVD player and laptop power adapter when she was not home.
Police found Palmer at his 
parents’ home, located at 1939 NW 32nd Place, at about 3 a.m. Sunday. They were able to see the victim’s TV and DVD play-er in plain view.
When officers went inside to 
get the stolen goods, they saw a bag with 0.1 grams of cocaine 
next to a rolled up $20 bill and 
Palmer’s Florida ID card. They also found a plastic baggie with two marijuana roaches.
Palmer was arrested on 
charges of aggravated battery on a pregnant female, grand theft, drug paraphernalia and marijuana and cocaine posses-
sion charges. His bond is set at 
$18,000.

Man wakes up to find stranger in bed with him
CLINTON, Conn. — A Connecticut man was arrest-
ed after police say he wandered into the wrong home 
drunk and got in bed with a stranger, who woke up 
startled and called 911.
Police say the incident happened early Saturday 
morning at an apartment complex in Clinton. Officers 
say 26-year-old Tyler Sullivan of Haddam told officers 
he thought he was at his mother’s apartment, which is in the same complex. A man in the home said he told Sul-livan to leave, but Sullivan refused. Police say Sullivan was still there when officers arrived.
Sullivan was charged with trespassing and disor-
derly conduct. 
Police: Regretful California robber returns cashEUREKA, Calif. — Police in northern California say 
a man robbed a gas station only to return hours later to give the money back and apologize.
Eureka Police Sgt. Steve Watson said Sunday that 23-
year-old Cyle Warren Abbott Jr. told officers he needed cash to leave town but then realized his mistake.Watson said Abbott first entered the gas station de-
manding cash with what the clerk believed was a semi-
automatic handgun.
The clerk gave Abbott some cash and Abbott left, also 
taking two bottles of beer, he said.
Watson said three hours later Abbott returned, 
giving back most of the cash and saying he was sorry. 
He said the weapon turned out to be a BB gun, which officers haven’t found.
Abbott was booked into jail on $50,000 bail.

overreactions 
form bad trend
On Tuesday, 18-year-old Shaquielle Olmeda was ar-
rested in Manatee County. According to the Braden-ton Herald, police “used patrol units, dogs and heli-
copters to set up a perimeter” and eventually apprehended 
and arrested Olmeda.
What crime did Olmeda allegedly perpetuate that required 
such a massive police response? The Manatee County Sheriff’s 
Ofﬁ  ce announced that Olmeda was arrested on charges of steal-ing a $4 pack of cigarettes.
Gross overreaction by police ofﬁ  cers to minor misdeeds is 
not a rare phenomenon. In fact, it is a growing national trend.Now more than ever before, police are using expensive, military-grade equipment as part of their normal arsenal. This is largely a result of the Department of Defense Excess Property Program.
The program “provides surplus DoD military equipment to 
state and local civilian law enforcement agencies for use in coun-ter-narcotics and counterterrorism operations, and to enhance ofﬁ  cer safety.” One of the most notorious pieces of equipment distributed by the Excess Property Program is the Mine-Resis-tant Ambush Protected vehicle — the MRAP.
Some of the recipients of the MRAP include law enforcement 
agencies in Justice, Illinois, — a population of 13,000 — and Mad-ison, Indiana, — a population of 12,000. It is unclear what sort 
of counterterrorism or high-level, anti-drug operations would 
be conducted in rural Indiana. Another recipient of the MRAP through the Excess Property Program is Gainesville Police.
“If we run into an extreme situation — like the school shoot-
ings we’ve seen around the country — we’ll run up here and grab the keys. Unless you’re an armed felon, you will never see this,” spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias told the Gainesville Sun.
However, there are abundant instances of MRAPs and other 
military equipment being deployed by law enforcement in non-
lethal situations. Most recently, police in riot gear armed with 
high-powered M4 carbines and ﬂ  anked by an MRAP intimidat-ed protesters in Ferguson, Missouri.
It is unlikely that most police departments would be as reck-
less as Ferguson police were in carelessly deploying this equip-ment in response to largely peaceful protests. However, the re-ality is that these police departments should not have access to military equipment in the ﬁ  rst place.
It seems today that the default response of many law enforce-
ment agencies is to heighten tensions through excessive shows of force. The militarization of our police through the Excess Prop-erty Program has only exacerbated this trend. In fact, a group of 125 ofﬁ  cers recently ﬁ  led a lawsuit in Seattle, claiming that laws against excessive force by law enforcement violate their consti-tutional rights.
The role of the police in America is to protect and serve, not to 
intimidate and terrorize. The gradual transformation of Ameri-ca’s law enforcement agencies into paramilitary groups tips the 
scale away from peaceful interaction and toward violence and 
mistrust.Capitalistic college sports must change
Recently, a decades-long academic scandal at Univer-
sity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill was uncovered. 
The systematic academic fraud was orchestrated by 
student services manager Deborah Crowder. Crowder 
has been accused of creating “paper classes” — register-
ing sections of fraudulent independent study credit and 
classes that never actually met because they never existed. One source states that more than 3,100 students beneﬁ  tted 
from these classes, receiving A’s and B’s for classes they 
didn’t take and preventing their GPAs from tanking. 
We’re all familiar with the perks extended to college 
student athletes: exclusive dining halls, private gym ac-cess, their own tutoring staff and more. In this instance, the paper class scheme was utilized by student athlete 
counselors to ensure their athletes remained eligible to 
play in their respective sports.
Besides dealing a damaging blow to Chapel Hill’s rep-
utation, this case opens the door for us to discuss the role that sports play in college culture and just how much im-portance our capitalist society places on college sports.
First, a look at the university. Universities aren’t just 
places of higher education. There are organizations, pro-fessional staff, bills and other programs that require large 
sums of money to exist on a university campus. USA To-
day reported that the SEC increased its total revenue to $314.5 million earlier this year. With that kind of money 
ﬂ  owing in, it makes sense that universities would want to 
be a part of the sports industry. People will pay for sports entertainment, and that beneﬁ  ts institutions of higher 
learning with robust athletic programs.
But given the nature of the capitalistic society in which 
we live, we have to ask ourselves: How much are we will-ing to sacriﬁ  ce for the sake of sports and sports-related 
proﬁ  t?
Obviously, Chapel Hill was willing to sacriﬁ  ce its ac-
ademic integrity. Those degrees made up of paper class transcripts will be forever recognized as illegitimate. Even students with degrees from UNC who were not involved in the paper classes could have their academic credentials more 
closely scrutinized because of the 
scandal.
In 2013, Florida State Univer-
sity prioritized sports and proﬁ  t over the safety of its students when Jameis Winston was al-
lowed to play on the team and 
win the Heisman and a national 
championship despite rape allegations against him. FSU 
faced heavy public scrutiny when news about there be-
ing “virtually no investigation at all” made headlines. Al-though America’s rape culture played a major role in the 
mishandling of the Winston case, FSU’s decisions were 
also likely driven by the ﬁ  nancial value of Winston’s ath-letic ability.
Our culture places a lot of weight on money and con-
sumerism. The quest for proﬁ  t often has a tendency to disrupt our moral compasses. When greed sets in and we 
prioritize proﬁ  ts over ethics, we send the message that 
sports matter more than students because of its respective ﬁ  nancial value.
By design, capitalism creates winners and losers. When 
schools prioritize sports and proﬁ  t over students’ rights — their right to a credible degree and their right to protec-
tion against sexual assault, in these cases — then students 
become the losers.
The long-term solution is to reform American capital-
ism and eliminate the winner/loser dichotomy.
The short-term solution is to stop giving student ath-
letes special passes at the risk of infringing upon the rights 
and privileges of others. There are plenty of student ath-
letes who don’t need paper classes to stay on the team. And if a star player needs to sit out a few games because 
of an ongoing investigation, that’s what the second-string 
players are for.

Early voting is now underway in 
Florida, and it is very important that everyone who is registered 
perform their civic duty and vote in this election.
One of the most important campaigns in Florida 
this year is the race for governor between incumbent Republican Gov. Rick Scott and Democratic challenger Charlie Crist. In a race between a guy who could pass for Voldemort and a guy who doesn’t know what he believes in, it may seem as if there isn’t a clear choice.
Florida voters should ask two questions about this 
race: “Who has better ideas and goals for the future of Florida?” and “Which candidate has a record that backs up his statements?”
If you direct these questions toward both candi-
dates, the choice couldn’t be any clearer: The front-runner who is destined to continue to do the best job for Florida is Scott.
I could focus my attention on how Florida’s econ-
omy has vastly improved. Under Scott, more than 650,000 jobs have been created in the last four years, compared to Crist’s loss of more than 825,000 jobs during his last stint as governor, according to Scott’s website. However, these comparisons aren’t com-pletely fair, given the fact that Crist governed Florida during the Great Recession, something over which he had no control.
I could focus my attention on their differing views 
on the Affordable Care Act, but this is really more of a federal issue that needs to be battled in Washington
Yes, Scott opposes the harmful Affordable Care 
Act law, but there is nothing he or Crist can do about it. As long as the Affordable Care Act remains the law of the land, Scott’s hands are mostly tied.
I have always felt that the best issue to compare 
candidates on is education. It is the most important responsibility state and local governments have. So, who has the best record and vision for education in Florida?
If you would have asked me four years ago, I would 
have never thought Scott would be the best candidate on education. In fact, back in 2010, the very first year I could vote, I voted for Bill McCollum in the Republi-can primary and then voted for Democratic candidate Alex Sink in the general election.
I was scared about what would happen to Flori-
da’s education system if Scott became governor, a fear that was confirmed the very first year he took office. Florida education spending dropped $1.3 billion. I’ve never bought into the delusion that only increasing spending will fix America’s education woes, but a decrease this large almost never has positive effects.
But then, some good things began to 
happen. Scott realized that education is 
an investment that needs to be prioritized, and he has begun to reverse his initial downward trend for edu-cation.
Florida’s education budget is now at its highest 
point ever, reaching $18.9 billion. To further improve upon this, Scott is pushing for next year’s budget to be $19.6 billion, which would set a new record for per-pupil spending in the state of Florida.
In 2011, Scott signed into law the Student Success 
Act, which bases teachers’ pay on a legislative analy-sis of performance (including student performance), allows new teachers the opportunity to earn higher salaries faster and hires teachers based on annual con-tracts and not life-long, impenetrable contracts.
This piece of legislation is highly controversial, but 
I think time will show that these reforms will prove useful to those they are intended to help: our state’s children.
It’s almost assumed now that because Crist is a 
Democrat, he is the candidate that supports education the most. However, this assumption is false.
Scott isn’t the only governor guilty of initially 
gutting education spending. Crist also cut education spending his second year in office by $800 million, and these cuts were never reversed.
In contrast, Scott’s administration is now spend-
ing more on education than any year that Crist was governor.
Crist had the opportunity when he was governor 
to enact a merit pay system for teachers but vetoed it to prepare to his switch as an independent in the 2010 Senate race. He put his ambitions above his re-sponsibility to Florida’s children, which is completely inexcusable.
Additionally, Crist is a big supporter of standard-
ized testing, a system that forces teachers to “teach to the test” and become bogged down by bureaucracy.
If you’re still undecided in this race, and education 
is one of your main selling points for a candidate, then the decision couldn’t be any easier.
When you vote, vote for education. Scott is the best 
candidate to improve upon Florida’s education system and continue reforms that are desperately needed.

Ever wonder if you 
are considered a “ba-sic white girl?” Well 
you’re not, and here’s why.
On Wednesday, Lindsay 
Alexander wrote an article in her opinion column titled 
“Basic white girls literally 
can’t even handle fall sea-son.” Alexander, indeed labeling herself as a basic white girl, decided to in-
form female readers of some 
“tips” women should follow as they dress for fall.
From the title alone, it’s 
obvious that Alexander lays out her advice in what she believes to be a humorous way. In no way did she mean it to be malicious toward 
women who dress the way 
she describes.
However, her opinion, 
which seems to mirror many 
others’ on campus, is dan-
gerous for all women.
The terms “basic white 
girl” or, as many others say, “basic bitch,” function as a 
new way to shame women 
for who they are. For those who are unfamiliar, it plays into the stereotype of women who are materialistic and lack an interesting personal-
ity.
And if you’re thinking 
that this idea is a bit ambigu-
ous, you’re right — every 
woman is prey to being la-
beled a basic bitch. Accord-ing to Alexander, a basic white girl could be a white woman who drinks flavored 
coffees, wears flannel or en-
joys fancy-smelling soaps.
In other words, indulging 
in simple pleasures or dress-
ing in ways that happen to 
be similar to other women is enough to reduce that wom-an’s personality to basic.
Seemingly normal choices 
in clothes and your lifestyle has the power to erase the complexity of your being to 
a category that is nothing 
more than average and not worth mention as a member of society.
As women, we are bom-
barded by conflicting mes-sages of how we are sup-posed to look. The media almost unanimously agree 
that we must be youthful, 
skinny and beautiful, while the more complex parts of our personality and charac-
ter can get left behind.Another thing we’ve 
learned is that we are sup-
posed to be sexy bombshells, but not in a slutty way where all men can access us. After all, we need to have a little 
more class.
We are given fashion 
trends that we find out we 
are only allowed to wear if 
we have a certain body type. 
Sure, we’re allowed to buy that pair of yoga pants and that crop top — we have free will after all. But then 
the moment comes when we 
wear these pieces out, and suddenly, our fashion choic-es become major sources of 
judgment of our character 
and our intentions.
I’m going to throw out a 
radical idea: Women dress the way we do because that’s 
the way we want to dress. 
We may be wearing the out-fit because we thought it fit our sense of style.
We might be wearing it 
because we think it feels 
comfortable (take it from me, 
leggings are really comfort-able.) Or, they might even be wearing an outfit for no real 
reason at all, besides the fact 
that we’re told we have to wear clothes.
Moreover, human bodies 
are sacred — women’s bodies 
are sacred. Every part of our 
bodies is sacred. Displaying different parts of our bodies is not a sexual invitation, and 
it is certainly not a judge of 
our character.
The point is, what one 
woman wears has everything to do with what they want to 
wear and nothing to do with 
anyone else. It’s important to understand that women do not exist for your viewing pleasure.
Women exist as people 
who have intelligence, who have personalities, who have complexity. Most of all, they are not basic. Having a con-
versation with any of these 
women will reveal individu-als with a rich past and rich life development who de-serve to be respected.

Three fight for lives after Washington 
school shooting
MARYSVILLE, Wash. — Three students 
fought for their lives in Seattle-area hospitals 
Sunday, days after being shot in the head dur-
ing an attack at a high school on Washington’s 
Puget Sound.
The close-knit community on the nearby 
Tulalip Indian reservation, meanwhile, strug-gled with the news that the shooter was a popular teenager from one of their more well-known families.
A tribal guidance counselor said no one 
knows what prompted 14-year-old Jaylen 
Fryberg to walk into a busy school lunchroom 
and open fire Friday.
“We can’t answer that question,” said 
Matt Remle, who has an office at Marysville-Pilchuck High School. “But we try to make sense of the senselessness.”
Churches have held vigils since the attack that killed one student and wounded four oth-ers, including two of Fryberg’s cousins, and gatherings were planned Sunday afternoon in the high school gym and at a tribal center.
In the nearby community of Oso, where 
a mudslide this spring killed dozens, people planned to gather to write condolence letters and cards.
Of the wounded students, only 14-year-old 
Nate Hatch showed improvement, though he remained in serious condition in intensive care at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. Fif-teen-year-old Andrew Fryberg also remained in critical condition in intensive care. Both are cousins of Jaylen Fryberg.
Meanwhile, 14-year-olds Shaylee Chuck-
ulnaskit and Gia Soriano remained in critical 
condition in intensive care at Providence Re-
gional Medical Center Everett.
The girl killed in the shooting hasn’t been 
officially identified.
Fryberg died in the attack after a first-year 
teacher intervened. It’s unclear if he intention-ally killed himself or if the gun went off in a struggle with teacher Megan Silberberger.
The Snohomish County medical examin-
er’s office said it was unlikely to have autopsy results before Monday.
Remele said he knew Fryberg and the other 
students well.
“My office has been a comfort space for na-
tive students,” he said. “Many will come by and have lunch there, including the kids in-volved in the shooting.”
They all were “really happy, smiling kids,” 
Remle said. “They were a polite group. A lot of the kids from the freshman class were close-knit. Loving.”
“These were not kids who were isolated,” 
he said. “They had some amazing families, 
and have amazing families.”
These factors make the shooting that much 
more difficult to deal with. “Maybe it would 
be easier if we knew the answer,” Remle said. “But we may never know.”Two DCF managers reassigned after Bell 
massacre
BELL, Fla. — Two managers with the 
Florida Department of Children and Families accepted lower-wage jobs after failing to stop a man within their office’s jurisdiction who killed his six grandchildren and their mother.
The Gainesville Sun reports  Amy Butler, a 
former regional manager, and Cynthia Speed, a former investigator supervisor, took new jobs with 50 percent less pay.
The reassignments come after an investi-
gation showed DCF failed to heed numerous warning signs, including a report just weeks before the Sept. 18 murder-suicide that Don Spirit was abusing his grandchildren.
Spirit killed all six children, ages to 3 
months to 11 years, and his daughter Sarah Spirit before turning the gun on himself.
DCF is also retraining investigators in the 
office that handled the case.

College professors butted heads over 
the medical marijuana issue during a dis-
cussion on the topic at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts on Friday.
Carl Hart, an associate professor of psy-
chology at Columbia University, debated with Harvard University professor Bertha Madras at the marijuana legalization panel hosted by the Florida Law Review.
At the event, Hart said medical mari-
juana should be legalized because the po-tential for abuse is equivalent to a legal pre-scription drug.
Madras, a professor of psychobiology, 
disagreed with Hart.
She said marijuana should be in the 
schedule 1 drug rating category, which in-cludes heroin.
“Marijuana is a plant with THC levels 
that vary between 1 and 15 percent, so you really can’t call that a medicine,”she said. “The FDA will never approve it until the therapeutic window, safety window and long-term consequences are known.”
Panelist Scott Teitelbaum, a professor of 
psychiatry and pediatrics at UF, sided with Madras in saying marijuana is dangerous and has addiction liability.
“You don’t smoke medicines, and you 
don’t vote on them to become legal,” Teitel-baum said. “The plant has over 400 chemi-cals, so it’s clearly not a safe medicinal op-
tion.”
Two other panelists at the discussion fo-
cused on the growth of efforts for medical 
marijuana legalization at the state level and where federal law comes into play.
Florida voters will decide on the legal-
ization of marijuana for medicinal purpos-es on Nov. 4.  
“We are in a new world now when it 
comes to marijuana research,” said panel-ist Beau Kilmer, a senior policy researcher at the Research and Development Corpora-tion Kilmer.
“I think we are going to get better infor-
mation about what people are consuming, and we will continue to make strides in sci-ence and the economy.”Professors speak on medical

Hungry customers crowded the 
area outside The Flying Biscuit Ca-
fe’s doors Sunday morning. A wait as long as two hours stood between increasingly impatient patrons and 
their breakfast.
To cut down on wait times and 
ease frustration, The Flying Biscuit, 
located at 4150 NW 16th Blvd., start-ed using QLess.
QLess is a wait management 
system that allows customers to use their mobile device to put their names on a virtual waiting list, elim-
inating the need to wait at the actual 
restaurant.When customers text “Flying 
Biscuit” to 310-494-2718, the system responds with automated real-time texts to secure their spot in line. It also provides an estimated wait time.
The system then allows custom-
ers to text certain commands: Tex-ting “S” prompts the system to send a status update, “L” lets you leave the waiting list and “H” means help.
Ernest Milian, director of op-
erations for The Flying Biscuit’s Gainesville location, said in a state-ment that the restaurant typically draws large crowds, especially dur-
ing football season, and the new sys-tem would help increase customer 
satisfaction.
The wait management system 
benefits both employees and cus-tomers, said T. Rodriguez, a man-ager at The Flying Biscuit.
“It puts the customer more in 
control,” she said. “It cuts down on the number of phone calls we get.”
Rodriguez said the few patrons 
who have used the new system have expressed their approval.
UF accounting freshman Nicole 
del Campo waited to be seated at The Flying Biscuit on Sunday morn-ing. The 18-year-old had not heard about the new system, but she said 
she would use it in the future.“I definitely would because 
we’ve been here for an hour almost 
already, and if we would’ve used that, we wouldn’t have had to wait here as long,” del Campo said.
The Flying Biscuit isn’t the only 
local business that uses technology for a smoother operation.
Humble Pie, a mobile pizzeria, 
uses the mobile app NoWait to text customers when their pizza is ready, owner Brett Ader said.
“That way, when we are at 
events, folks don’t have to wait around with their arms crossed,” he said. “At the Farmers market, which is always busy, they can order their 
pizza and walk around and go gro-cery shopping until it’s ready.”
Ader said he has recommended 
this new way of customer service to 
other food truck vendors. Customer feedback has been positive.
“People are surprised by it,” he 
said. “It’s a next-level thing. It’s not something you see all the time.”
UF microbiology senior Katya 
Zelaya, 22, said she likes the idea of having the freedom to wait wher-ever she wants to.
“Everyone always has their 
phone on them, so I feel like it makes sense to utilize that. Buzzers still kind of restrict you,” she said. “Now, I could just stay home until 
my table was ready.”

Washington School Shooting
A young woman kneels at the Grove Church in Marysville, Washington, on Friday. A memorial vigil was 
held for the shooting victims at Marysville Pilchuck High School earlier in the day. See story on page 8.

Cuba stalemate makes identify-
ing rafters difficult 
MIAMI — The bodies surfaced 
20 miles out from a popular South 
Florida beach: four men, still youth-
ful. Their remains were badly dete-
riorated, bitten by sharks, their faces unrecognizable.
One had a horseshoe-shaped scar 
on his head. Two bore tattoos: one of a spider, the other of a tiger with a flower. The fourth wore a pair of orange briefs and a gold-colored watch.
The Coast Guard delivered them 
to the Broward County Medical Examiner’s Office, where they re-mained for days, four more among the thousands who have died trying to cross the turbulent Florida Straits.
The remains of rafters that surface 
near the U.S. are often in such poor condition, they cannot be visually identified. Politics makes the pro-cess even more difficult with Cuban 
migrants: Because of the five-decade 
diplomatic stalemate between the U.S. and Cuba, pathologists can’t get matching dental records and DNA from relatives on the island.
“The standard means of identi-
fication aren’t going to work,” said Larry Cameron, operations director 
for the Miami-Dade County Medical 
Examiner Department.
Sometimes, relatives in the U.S. 
emerge and can provide a DNA match. Others remain unidentified, and because Florida law forbids their cremation, the bones are stored in morgues for years.
Identifying these bodies has be-
come a priority again for Florida’s medical examiners amid a 75-per-cent increase this year in the number of Cubans trying to cross by sea. At least 3,722 Cubans have been inter-cepted or made it to U.S. shores in the last fiscal year.
Florida orders 21-day monitor-
ing for Ebola 
MIAMI — Florida Gov. Rick 
Scott is ordering twice daily moni-toring for anyone returning from places the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention designates as affected by Ebola.
Scott signed the order Saturday, 
giving the Florida Health Depart-ment authority to monitor individu-als for 21 days.
Scott said in a press release that 
his administration had asked the CDC to identify risk levels of return-ing individuals from specific parts of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, requesting information specifically about the risk level for four people who had already returned. His of-fice said that the CDC had identified 
the four individuals who faced some 
risk but had not provided the levels of risk.
“Therefore, we are moving 
quickly to require the four individu-als who have returned to Florida already — and anyone in the future who will return to Florida from an Ebola area — to take part in twice- daily, 21-day health evaluations with DOH personnel,” he said.
Florida joins New Jersey, New 
York and Illinois in ordering the 
monitoring program.
There are no direct flights to the 
U.S. from West Africa. It was not 
immediately clear how many indi-viduals returning from the affected areas would end up in Florida.
Scott said the health department 
used the CDC’s web-based system 
to identify the four individuals.
Scott spokesman Frank Gonzalez 
said county health workers would 
visit those deemed at low risk and take their temperatures twice daily.
He did not immediately pro-
vide details as to how state officials would implement mandatory quar-antines.

UF students are using com-
mon technologies from smart-
phones to develop autono-
mous robots.
A team of UF graduate and 
undergraduate students at the 
Machine Intelligence Lab are 
creating an autonomous ve-
hicle system known as Propa-Gator.
PropaGator won the Inter-
national RoboBoat Competi-
tion in 2013 and placed second 
in 2014.
PropaGator is a fully auton-
omous surface watercraft that 
runs on sensors, motions and 
GPS systems that are similar 
to those used in common com-puters and smartphones.
Andrew Gray, a 30-year-
old UF first-year doctoral stu-dent in the electrical and com-puter engineering program, 
said autonomous robots like 
PropaGator are the future of 
technology.
“Who wouldn’t want to 
sleep on the drive to work?” 
Gray said.
The PropaGator team, led 
by Gray, has spent several 
hours at Lake Alice running tests on equipment and collect-
ing data.
The boat uses a sensor that 
indicates if the boat is level in 
the water, which is similar to a sensor used in most smart-
phones that senses when the 
phone is turned and rotates the 
screen, Gray said.
The boat “sees” with an in-
frared laser, much like the one 
used in desktop mouses. It also 
sends and receives information 
via a common wireless router.The team is also working 
to link the PropaGator with 
an autonomous helicopter that 
is powered by the processor from a Samsung Galaxy S3, Gray said.
Using 3-D printers, lathes 
and fiberglass molds, the team has created a fully autonomous surface watercraft.
The hull, for example, is 
made by laying pre-cut fi-
berglass pieces into a custom 
mold. Gray said the multiple triangular pieces give the boat a stealth-like shape, serving a 
completely practical purpose: 
ease of manufacturing.
“Imagine trying to make a 
peel that goes around an or-
ange,” he said. “How would 
you do that?”
Douglas Tom, a UF biology 
junior, said he is interested to 
see what progress comes from work with autonomous sys-
tems.
“You’ve got to step outside 
those bounds of security and comfortability to actually see 
change and make a change,” 
the 20-year-old said.
With the International Ro-
boBoat Competition coming up again this summer, the team 
is getting ready to reclaim the 
first place title.
But they are chasing more 
than a title. Gray said the stu-
dents are moving the passions 
and goals of everyone engag-
ing in autonomous systems forward.
“Everyone’s gonna go au-
tonomous,” Gray said. “Air-
craft, ground vehicles, all that, 
it’s gonna happen eventu-ally, hopefully during our life-time.”UF lab makes robots 
with common tech◗ THERE ARE THREE LABS 
ON CAMPUS.
MIKAYLA MOTT
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF’s 3-D printing labs are look-
ing to increase student use.
Marston Science Library, the 
Health Science Center Library and 
the A² Fab Lab, located in the Ar-
chitecture building, all have 3-D 
printers and scanners available for student use.
John Wheeler, intern at the digital 
fabrication lab and UF mechanical engineering second-year graduate student, said increased student use would bring in more funds.  
“We do a lot of fairs and different 
events on campus to reach out and get everybody aware that we exist,” the 22-year-old said. “We’re always trying to streamline our process and always trying to expand so there is more opportunity for students.”In 2012, the Fab Lab became the 
first printing lab in the area to allow students and residents to make 3-D prints, according to UF’s website.
Students can use the lab inside 
the School of Architecture for $120 a semester, where other students of different colleges pay $140, Wheeler said. Membership includes 24-hour access to the lab and the three laser cutters and file printing Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Marston Science Library and the 
Health Science Center Libraries have no membership fees. Instead, stu-dents pay 6 cents per gram of mate-rial and 2 cents per minute with a $3 minimum, according to the George A. Smathers Libraries website.
The Fab Lab houses five 3-D 
printers, one 3-D scanner and one three-axis CNC router, which is a 
controlled cutting machine.
Wheeler said that the lab keeps 
two consumer-grade printers, each 
costing about $2,000, one slightly larger printer that cost $7,000 and two professional 3-D printers rang-ing in cost from $50,000 to $80,000.
The Fab Lab and the libraries are 
taking steps to make the printers 
and scanners more user-friendly for 
students.
“They make it really easy for you 
to use (the machines). The hardest part is to make your models in the computer,” said 25-year-old Richard O’Donnell, a UF aerospace engineer-ing second-year graduate student.
The lab is planning on expanding 
in March, Wheeler said.
They are renting out four to five 
rooms in the Infinity Hall currently being built, which will be situated in the Innovation Hub. UF labs want more 3-D printer usage

EDEN OTERO
Alligator Staff Writer @edenotero_l
If depth were money, Florida volleyball 
would be rich.
On Sunday afternoon, the Gators (16-3, 
10-0 Southeastern Conference) continued their 
dominance in the SEC with another sweep of the Mississippi State Bulldogs (6-19, 1-9 SEC) in the O’Connell Center.
In its win, Florida played all but two players 
— defensive specialists Nikki O’Rourke and Lindsey Rogers — on its 17-player roster.
Coach Mary Wise attributed Florida’s abil-
ity to rotate more players into the game to the 
defense.
Florida libero Holly Pole and defensive spe-
cialists Taylor Unroe and Maddy Monserez to-
taled 29 of the Gators’ 41 digs for the day while 
also putting up four of UF’s eight service aces.
“In a match where we got to play a lot of 
different players, the key to us being able to do that was the play of our seniors,” Wise said. 
“Holly, Taylor and Maddy did such a good job in the back row. Serving, passing, defending: it 
allowed us to play any combination of players 
in the front row. That hasn’t always been the case, where we have the luxury to do that.”
Pole finished the match with two aces and 
11 digs. Unroe totaled 14 digs — the most for 
her since Florida’s five-set win over Oklahoma 
on Aug. 30 — and Monserez had four digs and two service aces.
With the defense’s ability to make solid 
plays, Florida utilized its depth to pull away from Mississippi State.
Freshman setter Abby Detering subbed in 
for Mackenzie Dagostino in the last seven plays of the first set, marking her first time compet-
ing in a match since facing Mississippi State on

Florida (13-4, 8-2 Southeast-
ern Conference) used a balanced 
attack to take down a struggling 
LSU team (5-12-2, 1-8-1 SEC)  on 
Sunday, defeating the Tigers 3-0 in Baton Rouge, La.
It was the Gators’ first shutout 
since a 1-0 win on Oct. 3 at Texas A&M and one of the team’s most complete performances of the season.
The Gators’ three goals were 
scored by three different play-ers, and because of the lead they built up in the first half, UF coach Becky Burleigh was able to give 
all 22 available players time on 
the field.
“I think that’s really impor-
tant,” Burleigh said about get-ting contributions from so many 
players. 
“We think that depth is an 
important part of our team. To 
see those players to get an op-
portunity to play and perform 
well is really important.”
The Gators were on the of-
fensive from the start, taking 13 shots in the first half while not 
allowing the Tigers to have a 
shot through the first 45 minutes of regulation.
Savannah Jordan scored the 
first goal in the 23nd minute, a scorching shot that went straight to the top-right corner of the UF soccer

LUIS TORRES
Alligator Writer @LFTorresIII
Maria Torres saved her best per-
formance of the fall season for the 
last tournament.
The sophomore fired a 1-under 71 
in the final round of the Landfall Tradi-tion in Wilmington, 
N.C., tying her low-
est round in the fall, when she shot the same number 
in the first round 
of the Landfall. 
Torres finished 
the tournament at even-par with an overall score of 216, good enough 
to finish in a tie 
for 11th place.
Florida finished the tournament at 13-over-par and in ninth place 
as a team. The Gators were 12 shots behind No. 16 Wake Forest, who 
held off Alabama and won by three 
strokes.
The Gators’ ninth-place finish 
is their best result in the fall. The team’s three-day score of 877 was 
also the best they have shot in the 
three events during the fall season.
Coach Emily Glaser was proud of the way Torres performed through-out the tournament.
“Maria had a solid event and a 
good closing round,” Glaser said in a release. “She continues to improve and we will look for her to be a lead-er for us this spring.”
The rest of Florida’s lineup didn’t 
fare as well in the final round of the tournament, as Torres was the only player to finish the round at even-par or better. Sophomore Karolina Vlckova completed her final round at 2-over-par and the three days 
of play at 3-over, which was good 
enough for a 24th place finish.
Freshman Taylor Tomlinson and 
sophomore Kelly Grassel each shot 4-over in the final round and fin-
ished at 5-over-par for the event. Ju-
nior Ursa Orehek struggled mightily

It was her 14th goal of the sea-
son. Jordan led the match with 
five shots and three shots-on-
goal.
Florida took a two-goal lead 
in the 42nd minute when Betsy 
Middleton sent a pass to the feet 
of a breaking Brooke Smith, who patiently took a touch and then put home her second goal of the season around the charging LSU 
goalkeeper. 
Florida took the 2-0 lead to 
halftime but wasted no time to 
start the second half.
Senior midfielder Havana So-
laun, who provided the assist on Jordan’s first-half goal, added a goal of her own in the 51st min-ute. 
Unassisted, she dribbled the 
ball around the goalkeeper and finished for her 5th goal of the season and the 26th of her career, 
which puts her in a tie for 11th 
all-time in UF history.
For the rest of the match, Flor-
ida held on to its 3-0 lead while inserting substitutes throughout 
the final half hour.
“We wanted to continue that momentum from our win on Fri-
day night, and I think we did just that,” Burleigh said. 
“I think it was big for us to get 
back to our winning ways (this weekend) and more importantly, just to get back to the way that we play.”
Even with the shutout, the 
Gators played both of their goal-keepers, keeping Taylor Burke from getting her school-record tying 27th career shutout.
Burke played the first half, 
and redshirt sophomore Valerie Tysinger was prepared to play the entire second half, but suffered a head injury about 15 minutes in 
and was forced to be taken out. 
Burke re-entered and finished 
the game.
Burleigh said Tysinger had a 
cut on her head from a collision with an LSU player, and although 
she had to be removed, the injury wasn’t serious.
Despite the limited playing time, Tysinger still recorded two saves in the match.
With the win, the Gators con-
tinue to hold their second-place standing in the SEC, trailing be-hind only Texas A&M in confer-ence standings.
Florida only has one regular season game remaining - Thurs-day night against Vanderbilt at 7 - before the SEC Tournament, which begins Nov. 3.

“I was very comfortable 
this time,” Detering said. 
“The first time I went in I was 
a little scared, you know you get those nerves when you first get on that court, but I 
think coming around the sec-
ond time I was very calm”
In the three sets the fresh-
man played — seeing limited time in each — she recorded 
eight assists and two digs.
Detering has played a 
total of five sets on the year 
but is expected to become the 
starting setter after Dagos-
tino, a junior, graduates. 
Detering was recruited 
specifically so Florida would have a two-year age gap 
between its setters to allow 
them to learn the system be-fore starting.
“Abby continues to amaze 
us in terms of her improve-ment and looked so good out there today,” Wise said. “The last time she played Mississippi State you could see the nerves got in the 
way. I don’t even think she 
remembered some of it, and 
it’s gonna happen as a fresh-man, her poise, the delivery, her choices, really nice job, she’s a player with a future.”
To add to the freshman 
lineup, Wise put freshman defensive specialist Sam Du-biel in for the last two sets of 
the match.
The freshman has only 
seen four sets this season — 
she last played in Florida’s 3-0 win over then-No. 19 
Texas A&M.
Dubiel, who is known for 
her float serve, only picked 
up one dig while on the 
court, but had the opportu-
nity to practice her serve.
“I started off with the 
jump float, but I couldn’t 
do it because of an ab in-
jury,” Dubiel said, “but I’ve 
been really trying to work 
on a shorter serve. Working around something that’s not as powerful but just really fo-cused on the location of it.”Detering, Dubiel

Gators don’t compete again until Spring
over the three days as she completed the event at 10-over-
par. 
“We hung in there very well for most the day, but had 
some mistakes coming down the stretch that hurt us,” Glaser said. “Overall, a better week with many more posi-tives than we’ve had all fall.”With the fall season wrapped up for the team, the Gators 
will have three months off before getting the spring season underway. Glaser expects the team to improve during the 
down time while understanding the importance of getting 
everyone back at 100 percent. 
“We are committed to working hard over the offseason 
to be prepared for the spring,” Glaser said. “In addition, 
we want to get the team healthy so we have a full roster of 
competition which will benefit our team.”golf , from page 13BEN MURPHY

For Florida sophomore Carlos 
Miranda, success has always been a 
part of his cross country career. 
In high school, Miranda was 
named the 2012 Naples Daily News 
Boys Cross Country Runner of the 
Year after winning FHSAA’s 3A Re-gion 3 three years in a row.
He was able to carry his high 
school momentum into his fresh-man year of college, where he was a starter and raced in all seven meets for the Gators. 
Miranda was tabbed the South-
eastern Conference Men’s Fresh-man Runner of the Week in three consecutive weeks and was named to the 2013 Cross Country SEC All-Freshman Team.
Miranda wanted to take last 
year’s accomplishments and bring them into the 2014 season.
“This year I just wanted to be a threat in cross country, be top three on my own team,” Miranda said. “Not just that but I wanted to run 24:10 and 24:15 right around there. You know I would just like to make it to Nationals again, be as consistent 
as I can and try to win SEC’s.”
But Miranda struggled early this 
season, finishing as the last Gator at 
UF’s home meet on Sept. 20. Coach Paul Spangler was relying on Miran-da being successful this season when deciding to redshirt seniors Jimmy Clark and Eddie Garcia. Fortunate-ly, things have started to click for 
Miranda recently, as he finished as 
one of the top two Gators in the last two meets.
Miranda knows his continued 
success is a key part in turning around the team’s season. 
“It’s tough, I have to step up 
more as a leader,” he said. “I’m only a sophomore and I have Coach tell-
ing me that I am a leader to this team 
now. But in the back of my head I know that I only have a year under my belt. I’m making the transition as well as I can, it has just been difficult to do that.”
Time is ticking for this Florida 
squad as the Gators finished out the 
regular season and are now prepar-
ing for the postseason. 
Next on the slate for the Gators 
will be the SEC Championship on Friday. Miranda is hoping to repeat on his success in this event last sea-son, when he set a personal best 8K with a time of 24:55.40 and finished as one of the top freshmen at the 
event.
He has lofty expectations heading 
into next weekend, to say the least.
“For SEC’s, obviously I want to 
do better than last year where I fin-
ished 29th,” he said. “I would like to finish top 10 and or even make the All-SEC Team. I want our guys to be focused and not let the races we’ve 
had in the past affect what is going 
to happen at SEC’s.”
Miranda seeks to return to freshman formcross country
