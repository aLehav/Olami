Firefighters prepare to enter the lower section of building AA at the Lau -
rels on Southwest 34th Street Sunday. The fire spread through the attic 
and destroyed several apartments before being contained.
Final budget plan calls for 58 layoffs, $42.2M in cuts� ONE WOMAN WAS TAKEN 
TO THE HOSPITAL WITH        MINOR INJURIES.

The cause of a fire at The Lau-
rels apartment complex that de-
stroyed five apartments and sent 
one woman to the hospital with 
minor injuries on Sunday night is still unknown.
After Monday’s investigation of 
the complex’s building AA, a fire inspector was able to determine that the fire started in apartment  AA142.
The apartment belonged to the 
woman who was hospitalized, said Alachua County Fire Rescue spokeswoman Carol Davis.
A 911 call at 7:29 p.m. reported a 
dead body in a Dumpster near the back of the complex, Davis said.  
When police responded they found no body but  saw building AA en-gulfed in flames. 
The Alachua County Fire Rescue 
Department and the Gainesville Fire Rescue Department were 
called to The Laurels, 4455 SW 
34th St., at  7:43 p.m. and had the fire contained about an hour and a half after arrival.
The fire rescuers were only able 
to save belongings in one of the apartments, Davis said.
As of Monday night, no foul 
play was suspected, but due to 
the nature of the emergency call 
further investigation is probable, Davis said.LOCALCause of fire still unknown
The body of Gainesville resident Barry Bernard 
was found Monday after a day of searching near the Matanzas Inlet in St. Johns County where he was last 
seen Sunday afternoon.
At around 1:30 p.m. on Sunday, Bernard, 25, and 
his friend Ashley Crandall were swimming with boo-
gie boards at Summer Haven Beach, 14 miles south 
of St. Augustine, said St. Johns County Sheriff’s De-
partment spokesman Kevin Kelshaw.
Kelshaw said the two were “pretty far out in 
rough, choppy waters.”
According to Bernard’s girl-
friend, Carolyn Kimbro, Bernard lost his boogie board when the 
board’s leash snapped.
Crandall, a trained lifeguard, 
tried to help him, but the two were separated by the rough waves.
According to Kimbro, who was 
at the beach at the time of the incident, it took Cran-dall 45 minutes to swim to shore because of the con-
ditions.
“She almost didn’t make it back because the cur-
rent was so bad,” Kimbro said in a phone interview 
Monday.
A search continued for Bernard until his body was 
spotted at around 11:15 a.m. Monday by a public ser-vice assistant.
Kelshaw said Bernard’s body was taken to a medi-
cal examiner to determine the cause of death.
Friends are planning to hold a memorial bicycle 
ride later this week in Bernard’s honor.
Bernard graduated from the  University of Central 
Florida in 2007.

UF will lay off 58 people and close four  
programs under its final budget cut plan, 
which was released Friday.
The university will have to cut $42.2 mil-lion from its budget in the next fiscal year, which begins July 1. The plan, however, only specifies how $30.6 million in cuts will be made, leaving almost $12 million in cuts up in the air.
Under the plan, nine faculty and 49 staff are 
slated to lose their jobs and an additional 150 positions will be eliminated. The eliminated positions include vacant positions from retire-ments as well as positions held by temporary 
employees whose contracts will not be renewed next year.
Five of the nine 
faculty layoffs in the plan are from the College of Journalism and Communications. Twenty-three of the staff layoffs are from the Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences.
UF President Bernie Machen said in an in-
terview Friday that the programs chosen for elimination were ones that the four senior vice presidents — UF Provost Joe Glover, interim

A man in a stolen car attempted to evade 
police Sunday afternoon by driving through the 
UF campus before crashing and being arrested. 
Auston T. Pearson, 19, of Ocala, was arrested 
around 3 p.m. after crashing into a woman’s 2003 Nissan on Southwest 34th Street, according to a Gainesville Police Department arrest report.
The man was noticed acting suspiciously 
near Toys”R”Us outside the Oaks Mall, said GPD spokesman Lt. Keith Kameg.
The officer, Jeffery McAdams, ran the tags on the car, which was stolen, Kameg said.
When McAdams tried to pull the car over, 
the man sped off. The officer did not attempt to chase the car but later caught up with the teen when he crashed, Kameg said.
Before the halting crash, Pearson hit a vehicle 
on Southwest 20th Avenue.
There were no injuries in either crash, accord-
ing to GPD. The vehicle, registered in Marion County, was reported stolen on Saturday.

US lawyers ask Afghan court 
to help Gitmo inmate 
KABUL (AP) — U.S. military 
lawyers asked Afghanistan’s 
highest court Monday to demand 
the release of a Guantanamo pris-
oner they say was only about 12 years old — not 18, as the military maintains — when he was sent to 
the detention center in Cuba.
Mohammed Jawad’s lawyers 
say they are enlisting Afghan 
courts because President Barack Obama’s decision to close Guan-
tanamo and reconsider how 
detainees should be tried has in-definitely stalled their case in the United States.
“We were in a winning pos-
ture in the trial, so to now come along and change the rules in the middle of the game, who knows what’s going to happen,” Marine 
Maj said.  Eric Montalvo, a Penta-
gon-appointed lawyer deposited the petition at Afghanistan’s Su-preme Court on behalf of Jawad.
While attorneys for many oth-
er detainees say the Guantanamo trials offered little chance of ac-quittal, a judge in the Jawad case had dismissed key confessions 
and the chief prosecutor resigned 
after arguing unsuccessfully for a plea deal that would release the Afghan after a brief period of re-
habilitation.
A ruling by Afghanistan’s 
judiciary system, beset with cor-
ruption and deep structural problems, would not have legal 
authority in the United States. 
But Jawad’s lawyers hope to cre-ate political pressure to move the case forward.
“It’s somewhat of an embar-
rassment to the American judicial system,” Montalvo said.The social-networking site 
has teamed with Reveille pro-ductions and Brillstein Enter-
tainment Partners to develop 
an unscripted series based on the popular site, which invites 140-character postings from members around the world.
The show would harness 
Twitter to put players on the trail of celebrities in an interac-tive, competitive format, the 
show’s producers announced 
Monday.
“Right now, Twitter is an 
incredible technological and cultural phenomenon,” said ex-
ecutive producer Amy Ephron, 
who created the TV show and took it to Twitter.
The producers call their pro-
posed series the first to bring the immediacy of Twitter to the TV screen.
“It captures what’s best 
about Twitter, and it’s a compel-
ling TV show in its own right,” 
said Noah Oppenheim, head of unscripted development for Reveille.
Like Ephron, he was tight-
lipped on any details about the show, its format, even its title. He said the partners are saving all that for their upcoming pitch 
meetings with networks.
Once a network deal is 
signed, “We’re ready to go into 
production,” Oppenheim said.
T.I. packs Atlanta arena 
before heading to prison
ATLANTA (AP) — Grammy-
winning rapper T.I. told fans he 
would stay optimistic when 
he heads to prison on a federal 
weapons conviction.
The 28-year-old rapper, 
whose real name is Clifford 
J. Harris Jr., performed for a 
packed audience Sunday night in Atlanta’s Philips Arena less than two days before he is to begin serving the sentence of a 
year and a day.
“I’m going to stand up tall, 
head up high,” he said. “Thank 
you for all of your support.”
Many in the packed crowd of 
about 16,000 people held up en-couraging signs, like one read-ing “T.I. We Will Miss U!”
He must report by noon 
Tuesday to the Federal Correc-tion Institution at Forrest City, Ark. He was arrested after pros-ecutors said he tried to buy un-
registered machine guns and si-
lencers from undercover federal agents in 2007.
During the concert, T.I. said 
he hoped that everyone learned 
from his mistakes. He brought 
his five children on stage, often LOCAL
New juice bar offers
health food alternatives
If his 1991 Toyota hadn’t bro-
ken down on Valentine’s Day 
en route to St. Augustine, Mark 
Ramirez might have never discov-
ered a “for lease” sign in the win-dow of a vacant Gainesville store.
Three months later, Ramirez 
transformed the abandoned space at 1109 W. University Ave. into Genesis Heaven and Health, a juice bar opening today at 10 a.m.
“This was a miracle for me to 
find this place,” said Ramirez, founder and co-owner of the store. “It was divine intervention.”
Genesis Heaven and Health of-
fers smoothies, salads, soups, pa-nini sandwiches and more. 
“It’s not health food,” he said. 
“It’s a health food alternative.”
Prices for smoothies range from 
$5.47 to $6.97, salads are $8.47 and panini sandwiches are $8.97.
Despite the current economy 
and diminished summertime stu-
dent population, Ramirez believes 
his store will prosper.
“I think a lot of college stu-
dents want to look and feel great,” Ramirez said. “It’s all about the 
visuals.”
Kelly Webster, a UF senior, 
agreed with Ramirez.  
“In summer, I think they have 
an advantage because everybody 
is trying to achieve that bikini body,” Webster said.
Genesis Heaven and Health 
is certainly not the first store in 
Gainesville to offer smoothies.  
Mariam Rose, who has worked 
at the nearby Smoothie Boost for 
nine years, doesn’t feel threatened 
by the new store. 
“Our location is better,” Rose 
said. “It doesn’t matter though. 
They are not competition.”

Parking in Midtown may now 
lead to a longer visit than motor-
ists intended.
Car boots have become a com-
mon alternative to towing at UF Plaza, 1702 W. University Ave., but several store owners in the area are unhappy about the change. 
The Gainesville City ordinance 
was amended to allow booting about six weeks ago, which has allowed the increase, according 
to Cpl. Kevin Clinton, who heads 
Gainesville Police Department’s towing department. Booting began in the plaza 
when Gainesville Real Estate Man-agement Co., which manages the property, contracted with Park-ing Solutions towing company to work the lot from 5 p.m. to 7 a.m.  
However, several business 
owners have complaints about the practice.
“The principle of booting is 
fine, but the practice isn’t,” said Ellie Baumgartner, manager of Copper Monkey Restaurant.
When a person is booted, they 
won’t call the company until they are ready to leave, which contin-ues to use up the space, she said.
Stan Forron, manager of Ulti-mate Towing Co., who has been 
towing for the UF Plaza parking 
lot for 20 years, also disagrees with booting. 
“Booting is punitive and a de-
terrent, and in the end doesn’t solve the problem,” Forron said.  
Baumgartner believes the 
signs in the parking lot should be changed to reflect the new prac-tice. “If the sign says tow, then tow, 
it says nothing about booting on the signs,” she said. 
Confusion also occurs because 
the signs read “Ultimate Towing 24/7.” While Ultimate Towing does work the lot from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Parking Solutions boots and tows at night, Baumgartner said. 
Cpl. Clinton will ask the two 
companies to update the sign, he said.
He has received calls complain-
ing about booting, but in every case the towing company was in the right, he said. 
“I think (booting) is here to 
stay,” Cpl. Clinton said. Rob Roche, owner of Pita Pit, Beer Pit 
and Relish Restaurant, dislikes 
customers blaming him for the booting. 
 “We have no control over the 
issue,” Roche said. 
Baumgartner feels that the 
practice of booting is not focused on helping the businesses in the area, she said.
“Parking Solutions isn’t in the 
business of opening spaces, they are in the business of making money,” she said. 
Gainesville Real Estate Man-
agement Co. was not available for comment, and Parking Solutions declined to comment on record.

Ordinance prompts booting increase in Midtown area
� ADOPTION CAN REDUCE THE    
NUMBER OF EUTHANIZED KITTENS.
By DANIELLE RUSHTON
Alligator Contributing Writer
Gainesville animal shelters are expected to 
crawl with kittens in the coming months.
Kitten season peaks during late spring and 
continues through the summer, said Eric Van 
Ness, associate director of Alachua County Humane Society.
With an estimated 36,000 stray cats in Ala-
chua County, local shelters will need the as-sistance of volunteers and foster homes, Van Ness said.A foster home provides a kitten with a 
temporary home until the kitten can be placed with a permanent family, he said.
The time kittens are in foster care can vary, 
but they are ready for adoption at eight weeks old. 
“At that point, we like to have them back in 
the facility so they can be adopted as soon as possible,” Van Ness said.
Alachua County Humane Society provides 
the food, supplies and vaccinations. All that is required from the foster parent is a commit-
ment of time and care for the kitten.
“We have a generous community and con-
tribution levels are still high, but we always 
have more kittens than foster homes,” Van Ness said. As shelters reach capacity during kitten 
season, some are left with no other option but  euthanasia.
Unlike other shelters in the area, foster 
care is not an option for its animals at Alachua County Animal Services.
Although the shelter’s staff hasn’t had to 
euthanize its animals in several months, if room runs short, they will be forced to euthanize older cats to make room for the new 
litters, he said.
According to Flagler, adoptions can help 
reduce the number of cats being euthanized, but it doesn’t get to the root of the problem.
“The solution is to reduce the amount of 
animals breeding by educating the communi-ty on the importance of spaying or neutering their pets,” Flagler said.
Operation Catnip is a local nonprofit orga-
nization that aims to reduce cat the population in Alachua County.
With the trap-neuter-return program, Op-
eration Catnip is able to capture all feral and stray cats so they can be spayed or neutered and returned to nature, said Shaye Olmstead, program coordinator for Operation Catnip. 
Operation Catnip has spayed and neutered 
over 26,000 stray and feral cats in the last 10 
years, Olmstead said.
Every month the organization holds a spay 
and neuter clinic at the UF College of Veteri-
nary Medicine. The next clinic will be held on June 14. Animal shelters prepare for influx of summer kittens

Two UF international students reported 
they were mugged and beaten by five to six men early Sunday morning.
The mugging was the second that eve-
ning in the Midtown area.
The two students had been drinking 
and were walking in the 1800 block of Uni-
versity Avenue after visiting bars, said Lt. 
Keith Kameg, Gainesville Police Depart-
ment spokesman.
“They were kicked and punched and 
one of the guys had a gold chain stolen,” Kameg said.
Nothing else was reported stolen, he 
said.
The incident happened 
around 3 a.m. but was not reported until about 8 a.m., 
likely because the students 
had been drinking, Kameg said. 
One student is a 22-year-old Polish 
man, and the age of the other male student was not identified.
 “Our criminals are looking for people 
that are either intoxicated or alone,” he 
said.
As a result of the recent robberies, GPD 
has increased its patrols in the area, he 
said.
“Unfortunately, we have some people 
in our community that they have now tak-
en to robbing people for sport,” he said.By SARA WATSON

After two tension-filled meet-
ings, the Student Government Sen-
ate’s Orange and Blue Party issued a press release accusing the Unite Party of attempting to appoint un-
qualified senators to cabinet posi-
tions.
The Orange and Blue senators 
opposed the confirmation of three Unite Party appointees to the po-sitions of Family Affairs Secretary, 
IMAGE Executive Director and Le-
gal Affairs Secretary, according to the release.
In last week’s meeting, problems 
arose when Sen. Ashton Charles re-quested that SG appointments be approved by block voting rather than individual voting to save time. 
Because senators from the Or-
ange and Blue Party had problems with the qualifications of the nomi-nees, Sen. Jonathan Ossip motioned for senators to vote individually.
After a long battle back and 
forth between Os-sip and Charles 
over voting pro-cedures, Ossip allowed the sena-tors to vote in block form.
In the release, 
Ossip, the Or-ange and Blue 
Party leader, said that the majority parties “used underhanded parlia-mentary tactics to push through the 
appointments as quickly as possible 
with little review or debate.”
“These actions show the con-
tinued cronyism and disregard for good governance that the Unite/Gator Party has decided to continue in the administration of President Jordan Johnson,” he said. 
In last week’s meeting, Orange 
and Blue Party members expressed frustration over the family and le-gal affairs secretary nominees be-cause neither appointment was ex-perienced, Ossip said.
Sen. Alan Yanuck said last week 
that he was concerned with the ap-pointment of Ankur Lakhani to represent IMAGE, an SG agency that videotapes senate meetings. 
Lakhani lost last semester’s 
video files, and a procedure to try to retrieve the files will cost about $750 with only a 60 percent chance 
of success, Yanuck said. 
Lakhani was eventually ap-
proved, as were the two other nom-
inees in question.

� ABOUT 500 PEOPLE 
ATTENDED THE SERVICE.

Amid the road trips, bar-
becues and department store 
sales that marked Memorial 
Day 2009, citizens paused at Forest Meadows Cemetery to honor the Women Airforce Service Pilots.
The women, who refer to 
themselves as WASP, spoke about their experiences as test pilots during World War 
II and were presented with 
certificates of appreciation.       Forest Meadows Cemetery started hosting the service in 2004, event coordinator 
Amanda Garrigues said.
“The audience turnout 
was amazing,” she said, esti-
mating that about 500 people 
attended the event. Three members of WASP 
attended the service with the aid of Wings of Dreams Inc., a 
nonprofit corporation focused on aviation history, to pay tribute to WASP members.
“Both of my brothers were 
pilots,” said Barry Vincent Smith, a WASP member of the sixth class of 1944. 
Her brothers encouraged 
her to learn to fly after the military began accepting women with 35 
hours of flight training.
“When there were prob-
lems with planes like the AT-10, mechanics would fix them,” Smith said. “The 
women would fly and test 
the planes to make sure they were safe for the men to use at war.”
WASP flew every plane in 
use at the time, including the B-29, the model of the plane that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima.
These women faced gen-
der discrimination and were disbanded by the United States military in late 1944, said Susan King, co-founder 
of Wings of Dreams Inc., who 
presented the pilots’ history at Monday’s service.
“We had very little,” 
WASP member Helen Snapp 
said. “We didn’t even have 
uniforms until soon before we were disbanded. We wore leather jackets with a WASP 
patch sewn on.”
The Forest Meadows Cem-
etery Memorial Day service 
is one cherished by veterans and non-veterans alike.
“We need to appreciate 
our veterans as much as we can,” Virginia Fettes, a mem-ber of the Daughters of the 
American Revolution and 
wife of a Korean War veteran. “Services like this bring tears to my eyes.”TUESDAY, MAY 26, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Gainesville residents strolled 
down a mile-long stretch of tomb-
stones labeled with the names of fallen soldiers on Monday, taking  in the Memorial Day display at 
Westside Park.          
A line of colorful banners la-
beled with the names of fallen 
soldiers fluttered in the wind and along Northwest Eighth Avenue.
“People want to ignore the war,” 
said Scott Camil, member of Vet-erans For Peace, “but this location won’t let them.”  
This is the third year the 
Gainesville Chapter of Veterans For Peace has put out the display.    
The tombstones were placed to 
show honor and appreciation to  American soldiers.
Joyce Thompson and her 
friend, Rebecca Aldridge, felt over-whelmed by the number of tomb-
stones.
“There are too many,” Thomp-
son said, “but I am glad I came out 
here to see it.”
There are more than 4,900 names 
on display, but the last four tomb-stones remain nameless.
“Those are for soldiers who were 
recently killed,” Camil said, “and we are withholding their names until the families are notified.”
For Thompson, Memorial Day is 
about remembering. 
“As long as people remember,” 
Thompson said, “that is the impor-tant part.”Veterans honor fallen

U.S. ideology does not include torture The word peculiar 
comes to mind when conjuring imagery of 
the sights and sounds found around the UF campus. 
From live alligators to 
the infamous creatures, err preachers lurking in Turl-ington Plaza, a walk around the home of the Gator Na-tion can prove to be a real eye-opener.
The latest? An on-cam-
pus police chase involving 
a stolen vehicle seemingly 
straight out of “Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.”
According to an article 
in The Gainesville Sun, the chase came to fruition at the Oaks Mall on Sunday afternoon when Gainesville Police Officer Jeff McAd-
ams noticed the suspect 
behaving suspiciously in the parking lot. Auston T. Pearson, 19, drove off in a white Dodge Charger and exited the mall property by turning onto Southwest 62nd Boulevard. Following Pearson, McAdams learned the vehicle was stolen by running the license plate. McAdams attempted to pull over the individual.
And the pursuit began. 
Realizing McAdams was 
closing in on him, Pearson 
ignored the officer’s sirens and attempted to thwart his impending arrest by mak-ing a left onto Southwest 20th Avenue and eventu-ally Southwest 34th Street.
After striking a car and 
making a series of U-turns on campus, Pearson’s not-so-funny joy ride came to an end when he returned to Southwest 34th Street and crashed his vehicle into an-other car.
Arrested at the scene, 
Pearson somehow managed 
to avoid any bodily injury 
in both of the accidents he caused.
His criminal record, 
however, is in shambles as he faces a litany of charges ranging from fleeing and attempting to elude to driv-ing without a valid license.No end in sight
Chicago youth faced with 
violence epidemic
Shockingly put on the back-burner by most of the na-tional media, the rough and tumble streets of Chicago continue to claim the lives of innocent city youth.
With 36 Chicago-area students killed in the current aca-
demic year, violence in the Windy City has reached epic 
proportions with seemingly no end in sight.
While school remains in session for another week, Chi-
cago can already stake claim to the dubious distinction of 
having the highest youth homicide rate in the entire coun-try. As guns and drugs ravage the working class sections of the city, the black community has suffered the greatest casualty rate by a two to one margin compared to whites. According to an article in The Washington Post, the mur-der issue is only a portion of the problem as nonfatal inju-
ries occur nearly 100 times the homicide rate.
The details are gruesome.
Take Alex Arellano, for instance. From being beaten 
with baseball bats to eventually being shot and burned, the 15-year-old’s body was discovered a few days after disappearing from his family’s home. Gang-related or not, Arellano’s life was cut short before he could even drive a car, go to prom or graduate from high school.
Sure the prospects of hosting the 2016 Olympics appear 
bright — not to mention being home to President Barack Obama, but the death of a child, one or 36, places an un-avoidable blight on any city. Undeniably, efforts are being made, but the troubling statistics continue to speak vol-umes of an issue that isn’t going away any time soon. 
Typically, I like the game of politics. I like the strategy 
and the plotting. I like a good fight.
When writing this column, I’ve sometimes failed 
to steer away from taking cheap shots at people whose ideology I don’t follow or whose sanctimonious political remonstration I find funny. I am human, and I’m neither the first nor the last.
There are some times of the year, though, that I just 
can’t bring myself to consider writing or even thinking of anything that dishonors the quiet dignity that our soldiers, current and past, fight to protect our national ideology and existence. Memorial Day is one of these times.
Growing up in a seaside resort town, Memorial Day 
signified the mourning of sleepy weeks lost to throngs of summer tourists that make their first pilgrimage to the snowy sands of Florida’s Emerald Coast. Amid cheers from 
children let out of elementary school and gleeful musings 
of adults escaping the confines of gray cities, it’s always been hard for me to fully contemplate the sacrifices made by thousands of men and women in our armed services.
But outside of the idyllic and worry-free world of pas-
tel-colored beach cottages, Memorial Day is a day where outdoor barbecues offer a small retreat from the horrors of war that haunt families.
In Washington, Memorial Day is a day of public mourn-
ing. President Barack Obama, like all of his recent prede-cessors, lays a wreath in Arlington National Cemetery. Songs are performed in the National Mall during Memo-rial Day concerts as an attempt to lighten up the mood after a mother of a fallen soldier tells the gathered crowd how 
her son died in Iraq.
Again, I do like political fights and arguments; the 
freedom to do so is what makes Memorial Day worth cel-ebrating. But lately, the arguments 
between the upper echelons of the Republican Party over whether 
water-boarding is torture, and 
even if it is, whether torture should effectively be outlawed, has left a sullen mark on our reputation.
Our soldiers have not, do not, 
and never should be instruments 
that memorialize America’s acceptance into the league of ordinary nations. We do not torture not because we ask others to follow international law, which itself forbids tor-
ture, and neither because we believe that by standing as a 
civilized role model to the world we stand in favor to dis-suade other nations from acting with such barbarity.
The United States of America does not torture because 
it debases what our politicians label as our soldiers’ sacri-fice.
When we torture, when we hold prisoners indefinitely 
and discriminately without due process on detention bases like Guantanamo, and when we take shortcuts with our 
Constitution and Bill of Rights, soldiers’ lives are no longer 
sacrificed; they are stolen. Stolen by the human slights of judgment that are never corrected but turned into politi-cal hot potatoes tossed between former unprincipled vice 
presidents and sly political operatives, all looking for pub-
licity to sweeten their own book deals.
Their lives are stolen when we steal away from our na-
tion’s principles. Their lives are stolen, and not sacrificed, when we dishonor our soldiers’ quiet bravery and im-
mense courage.

Letter to the Editor
Cash for Clunkers bill is a mistake
The United States Congress is 
making a critical mistake by in-
troducing the so-called “cash for clunkers” bill, which seeks to re-
strict the sale of two major replace-
ment parts: the engine and trans-mission. 
By continuing to be unsympa-
thetic to professional automotive recyclers, this environmentally “green” industry will likely experi-ence financial hardship as well as the end-user, the customer, who needs to replace an engine or trans-mission.  
Overall, automotive recycling 
serves as a $22 billion industry in the United States and employs over 103,000 people at more than 8,267 businesses around the country. By any estimation, these figures reflect a significant piece of our country’s economic pie.
An estimated 86 percent of 
automotive recycling companies feature full service and employ 10 or fewer people, with an annual payroll estimated to be about $3.3 
billion.
Professional automotive recy-
clers adhere to stringent environ-
mental regulation --  including the removal and reuse of engine oil, transmission fluid, gas and mer-cury-containing light switches and Anti-lock Break System assemblies. The direct cost to process a salvage 
vehicle ranges across the country from $400 to $600. 
Not allowing automotive recy-
clers to sell the engine and drive train components will result in de-
creased inventory and a net sales revenue loss of 50-60 percent per vehicle. A loss at such a rate would be nothing short of crippling for professional automotive recyclers everywhere.
At the expense of helping one 
industry, Congress should, at the 
very least, consider allowing pro-fessional automotive recyclers the 
ability to reuse quality Original Equipment Manufacturer automo-
tive components as replacement 
parts for consumers.
The automotive recycling in-
dustry is made up of professionals who are dedicated to protecting our environment and providing low-cost alternative replacement parts for the American public.

Holiday, Fla.
An employee is leisurely stocking 
shelves in the supermarket one day when a man with a gun busts in. The 
criminal shoots the stock boy and then flees the scene. Another employee rushes to the 
aid of our hero, eager to console him. The 
stock boy looks up at his friend and meekly says, “cleanup in aisle 7.” 
This joke, related to me by a friend named 
Phil Correa, is admittedly fairly corny. It does however function as a wonderful example of what is, in my opinion, one of the highest and most noble forms of humor: gallows humor.
The fact that humans handle stress in myr-
iad ways has been well-documented by psy-chologists for years. Situations of great stress, trauma or even life-threatening danger have occurred in the lives of all of us, and each per-son faces these moments in different ways. Gallows humor is one of these ways and hap-pens to be my personal favorite.
Part of what makes gallows humor so 
important is that it’s demonstrative of one of the higher traits of an otherwise lowly devel-oped society. Gallows humor almost always 
deals with an impending death—a moment 
of grave seriousness. The most cavalier and charming individuals agree that life is just a ride.
There are numerous instructive examples 
of gallows humor sprinkled throughout his-tory. Whether it were uttered by heroes or scoundrels, these lines represent a temporary transcendence into that state wherein man 
can laugh even at death.
Benjamin Franklin, one of the founders of 
this Republic, found himself in a room with 
extremely argumentative delegates immedi-ately after the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Aware of the danger hang-ing over their heads, thanks to what they had just done, Franklin said to the assembled crowd, “We must all 
hang together or sure-
ly we shall all hang separately.” Despite the word play, I like this one. The charge of 
high treason lay ahead of them, yet Benjamin Franklin was still able to crack foxy, as the saying goes.
Tallulah Bankhead, famous actress of 
Hollywood’s golden days, is somewhat no-torious in the cannon of cinema history for the drawn-out decline of her career and her substance addictions. You may know her from old “I Love Lucy” reruns where she played herself. Bankhead, whose last words are reputed to be a demand for more codeine and bourbon, had a definitively cavalier at-titude regarding her decline. When asked in her waning days if she was in fact Tallulah Bankhead, she would reply, “No, darling, 
I’m what’s left of her.”
These are just two examples of a common 
form of humor. We’ve all encountered gal-
lows humor before, and often, we’ve let it slip by without truly appreciating the forces at work. During times when darkness de-scends upon a person—when a storm rages ahead—and that person greets it with a flip-pant remark, then he or she is at his or her 
finest. It is this determination to get on with 
the fun of living optimistically, even fool-ishly, even against all better judgment, which makes a life worth living.

Gallow humor holds significant place in America’s historyColumn
Like you, I’m pretty hip to what’s happening in the world. 
I surf the Web, watch television 
and recently sold my soul to Steve 
Jobs and bought an iPod. My Fa-
cebook page is a thriving center of ideas and progress (I recently took a quiz on there and found out that if I was a drink, I would be a martini). However, despite being relatively connected to the latest trends, I just do not understand the appeal of Twitter. 
Twitter.com, the darling of me-
dia personalities, Hollywood actors, sports stars and thousands of others, sprang from nowhere and went on to dominate the Internet and popu-lar culture like a virus.
According to a March Nielsen.
com blog, Twitter.com grew by 1382 percent in the month of February 
2009 alone.
For people who have stronger 
wills than a dieter at CiCi’s Pizza and 
shunned any mention of Twitter, it is a social networking site. Founded in 2006, Twitter allows users to sign up and “tweet” small 140-charac-ter posts about anything going on in their lives. Usually these posts 
are incredibly mundane but sev-
eral media outlets, such as CNN or ESPN, and public figures, like Ash-ton Kutcher or even U.S. Congress m e m b e r s , have used the site and broadcasted its “cultural 
significance” to the world. 
A few months ago, I decided to 
set up an account, hoping to under-stand the draw. After one tweet of my own and a useless search to find anyone of interest, I resided to mere-ly following the always entertaining Shaquille O’Neal. Call me old fash-ioned (is Facebook already old fash-
ioned?), but I’am not sold on it. 
Now don’t get me wrong, there 
are several positive aspects of Twit-
ter. It has brought regular Internet users closer to the media and public figures while adding another option for the instantaneous transmission of information. 
For many, Twitter is great. It does 
not require the upkeep of a Facebook or MySpace account, and is more hip and high tech than shouting from a top of a soapbox or writing opinion columns in a local newspaper. How-ever, Twitter has simplified social networking to the lowest denomina-tor and, by doing so, made it much less engaging and expressive. 
The presence of so many impos-
ters and fake profiles on the twitter site has made searching for poten-tially interesting people almost use-less. Twitter has also caused an infor-mation overload and truly redefined media and mass information, often for the worse. The ability of thou-sands of people to post little details 
about their daily lives devalues the 
overall meaning of social network-ing and can get really boring. 
Perhaps my biggest gripe with 
the Web site is its undue popularity and the way in which the media has sold it as the new big thing. Howev-er, in the face of Twitter’s growing cultural importance, maybe I should 
just end my boycott. I’ll think about 
it and tweet you later.

Speaking OutBy STEVE JOHNSON

ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. — “The 
show must go on” was the theme of 
last week’s Florida’s First Coast Arts Festival as UF’s School of Theatre and Dance put on 11 shows in seven 
days, rain or shine.
Throughout the week, UF pro-
duced a variety of performances 
at the St. Augustine Amphitheater ranging from the comical acts of “The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged),” to the serious tones of “Pride and Preju-dice.”
“The weather has been a night-
mare,” said Kevin Marshall, pro-ducer of the festival. “It has rained every day since the 17th.”
Performances were held despite 
the rain, and although covered seat-ing kept audience members dry, ticket sales were still effected.
“They were disappointing,” 
Marshall said. “When The Weather Channel broadcasts from down-town St. Augustine on Thursday, you know you’re in trouble.”
The city had 14.2 inches of rain-
fall during the week of the festival, which is well above the 3.11-inch average for May, according to The Weather Channel’s Web site.
Marshall said the festival cost be-
tween $200,000 and $250,000. “All the productions have been 
marvelously received,” Marshall said. “I think it has really helped the visibility for The School of Theatre and Dance.”
Along with multiple performanc-
es, the UF School of Art and Art History held an outdoor exhibition at the amphitheater featuring eight sculptures from current UF students 
and alumni.
The amphitheater chose to keep 
the sculptures on display after the 
festival ended, said Anthony Cas-tronovo, adjunct assistant professor of sculpture at UF. 
The amphitheater was built in 
1965 to commemorate the 400th an-niversary of St. Augustine, which is 
the nation’s oldest European settle-
ment, according to the Florida’s First Coast Arts Festival Web site. 
The 4,000-seat venue is nearly 10 
times as large as the Constans The-ater at UF, which seats 415.
“I enjoy it because it challenges me,” said Nichole Hamilton, an ac-
tor in “Pride and Prejudice.” “It is a 
leap for an actor. You have to reach every member in the audience.”This is the first year UF has pro-
duced the festival, and it is planning to continue with dates set for May 15-24 of next year.“We have every intention of 
coming back,” Marshall said. “This will become an annual festival here on the First Coast.”STUDENT LIFE

Actors from UF’s School of Theatre and Dance perform “Grease” Sunday night at the St. Augustine Am-
phitheatre.
Natural Resources Larry Arrington, Senior Vice 
President for Health Affairs Doug Barrett and interim Senior Vice President for Administration Brian Beach — decided would have “the least impact on the overall mission of the university” 
if they were cut. Machen said the number of lay-
offs may be fewer by the time the new budget is implemented.
Though the Board of Trustees, UF’s highest 
governing body, will make the final vote on the plan today, Machen said he can continue to con-sider alternate plans, as long as they are for the same dollar amount, for up to 30 days after the vote.
Faced with the reality of layoffs, Machen said 
some administrators may change their minds.
“It’s one thing to send me a list of possibili-
ties,” Machen said of the budget cut proposals submitted by each unit at UF, “then when I call ‘em up and say, ‘We’re gonna do this,’ they say, ‘Wait a minute, maybe I’ll do something else.’”
The same thing happened last year, he said.UF’s budget plan last year called for 14 fac-
ulty and 118 staff layoffs. In the end, only eight faculty and 66 staff were laid off. Three faculty were later reinstated and two others were laid off in their place.
The reduction in layoffs was also influenced 
by unexpected retirements, new funding for some positions and the hiring of some soon-to-be-laid-off employees in other areas at UF.
In the plan released Friday, UF announced it 
will cut $30.6 million primarily by laying people off, eliminating positions and switching pro-grams from state to non-state funding.
Most of the remaining $11.6 million in cuts 
have yet to be determined and will be covered by stimulus money — UF is receiving $41 mil-lion next year — in the meantime.
However, he said about $2 million will likely 
be cut by diverting money that UF’s National 
Merit Scholars program was scheduled to con-
tribute to the Grad Alumni program. As for the rest of the cuts, he said administrators are still analyzing various possibilities and determining how much they could save.
For example, he said UF is considering plac-
ing a cap on the amount of money employees can collect from unused sick leave or vacation 
time when they leave UF and also creating an 
early retirement program, which he said should be available by July 1.
But it’s hard to know how much these mea-
sures will save, he said. For example, he said it is impossible to know how many people will 
sign up for the early retirement program, which 
would provide incentives for employees to retire early.
How UF will cut the remaining $3.6 million 
is even less clear. One proposal calls for consoli-dating some of the university’s communication 
offices.
In addition to these 
cuts, UF might have to take even more from its 
budget during the middle of the year to pay for raises for some employees. UF will likely spend 
about $2.3 million, Machen said, to cover merit-
based and promotion-related raises for faculty, which have not been factored into the budget yet. UF is not currently planning on offering across-the-board raises for faculty and staff. 
There is also the possibility of another mid-
year budget cut from the Florida Legislature, 
which is a big reason Machen has decided not 
to allocate all of UF’s stimulus money. Only $24 million of the $41 million has been designated. Another reason for holding off on using stimulus money, Machen has said, is that the federal gov-ernment hasn’t explained yet how the stimulus money must be spent.
Machen said when it’s time to decide how 
to cut the $11.6 million or more that still has to come out of UF’s budget, he will present the op-tions to the university community for feedback before making any decisions.
 “We will start the process over again,” he 
said.
This will likely happen around the middle of 
the next academic year, he said.
He also emphasized that UF will create a new 
list of possibilities for the next round of cuts in-stead of using the budget cut proposals submit-ted to UF in April.
“The list that was used to produce these cuts 
is now off the table,” he said. 
For now, though, the spotlight is on the 
Board of Trustees. They will vote on the budget in a telephone conference call today at 3:30 p.m. Members of the public who wish to listen can do so at 215C Emerson Alumni Hall.
Machen said the trustees are not likely to 
make any changes to the plan.
“My feedback from the trustees is that they’re 
comfortable with what we’ve done,” he said.
For the most part, he said, the trustees have 
let administrators determine how to make cuts.
“They have pretty much stayed out of the 
process until just about two weeks ago,” he said Friday.
“They were very much involved in the lob-
bying of the (state) Legislature, so they knew ex-actly how bad it was, but they decided to let us decide,” he said.
The trustees told Machen at their annual Lake 
Wauburg retreat in February that they wanted UF to shift its mission to focus more on graduate education and research. Machen said the restruc-turing envisioned by the board didn’t occur.
“I think we pretty much preserved the uni-
versity while shrinking it down to get this mon-
ey out,” he said.
He said it wasn’t clear back in February how 
big UF’s budget cut would be, which led some 
trustees to prepare for a worst-case scenario.
“In some people’s minds, I think, was the 
idea of whole colleges being removed and all that,” he said. “Certainly we didn’t do anything like that.”
Machen said he thinks the impact of the cuts 
on UF could’ve been much worse.
“I think we’re intact,” he said. “I think most 
of our colleges are gonna be okay. Our student body will not see their programs change.”
He said he worries about two things, though–
how UF will cut the remaining $11.6 million from its budget and about the slipping economy.
“My worry is… will there be another chapter 
to this thing?” he said.Machen: UF will create a new list of budget cut possibilities for next year

SEC TRACK AWARDSBy ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator.org
As Stacey Nelson walked 
from Katie Seashole Pressly Sta-
dium to postgame interviews, 
the senior ace asked coach Tim 
Walton a simple question.
“Stacey gave me a hug and 
said, ‘Coach, four years ago 
did you know that we’d be go-
ing back to our second College 
World Series?’” Walton said. “I told her, ‘Four years ago, I didn’t 
even know you were going to be 
this good and thanks for being that good.’”
Nelson (39-3, 0.41 ERA) was 
as good as she has ever been 
Sunday, leading UF to its second 
straight Women’s College World Series appearance following 
two wins over California in the 
NCAA Super Regionals.
UF will play Arizona in the 
first round of the WCWS on 
Thursday night at 9 in Oklaho-
ma City, Okla.
The No. 1 Gators (60-3) only 
put up four runs on seven hits in 
their doubleheader sweep of the No. 14 Bears (38-20), but Nelson allowed no runs in her 12 innings 
of work.
The right-hander pitched all 
seven innings of UF’s 2-0 victory 
in Game 1 and worked five in-
nings of relief in her team’s 2-1, 
Super Regional-clinching win.
Nelson struck out 19 batters 
between the two games, walked 
none and only gave up six hits.
Walton started sophomore 
Stephanie Brombacher in Game 2, but he went back to his ace to protect the team’s 2-1 lead. 
Nelson came through even 
after pitching a complete game earlier in the day, throwing five scoreless innings and starting a key, momentum-killing double play in the sixth after the Bears put together two consecutive hits.
“All the great ones have that 
ability. She just doesn’t buckle under pressure,” Walton said. “In relief today, she was the best she’s looked all year long.”
After the game, Nelson said 
she had “a little flash” before turning the critical double play 
and she just had a feeling she UF SOFTBALLGators sweep Super Regional to return to WCWS

UF center fielder Kim Waleszonia does the worm across home plate after the Gators clinched their second straight trip to the Women’s College World Series by defeating California in a doubleheader Sunday.
Touché, Nick Calathes.
Everyone was awaiting the UF 
guard’s decision between an NBA 
career and another year with the Gators, 
but he had other plans.
On Saturday, several news outlets re-
ported that Calathes signed with Greek 
powerhouse Panathinaikos, which has won two of the last three Euroleague ti-
tles. 
The Orlando Sentinel reported the con-
tract would be worth $1.1 million per year and include a home, car and tax credits, 
making the total package comparable to what a late lottery pick in the NBA Draft could expect to be paid.
It’s too early to tell how well this deci-
sion will work out in the long term for Ca-lathes, but in the short term, I love it.
He was predicted by many to be draft-
ed late in the first round, but it’s not hard to imagine him slipping into the second. I’m sure Calathes doesn’t agree with me, but I didn’t see him having a huge 
career in the NBA.
Playing in 
Greece, where he 
has dual citizen-ship, Calathes will 
be pulling down a 
great salary and in-
creasing his chances of making the Greek 
National Team, something he tried to do 
last summer.
He’ll be closer to his brother, Pat, who 
also plays in Greece, and he’s likely to be-come something of a celebrity while living in Athens.
Most importantly, he should have 
more early success than he would on our Calathes makes the right call By KYLE MAISTRI

HOOVER, Ala. — In order to win the 
Southeastern Conference Tournament, UF 
had to prove it was capable of beating ev-ery team in the eight-team field.
After Friday’s 10-7 loss to Arkansas 
knocked the second-seeded Gators out of the tournament, UF is unable to make such a claim.
The Razorbacks were the only SEC team 
to sweep the Gators during the regular sea-son, and UF’s 19-8 record against the rest of the conference seemed to matter little as the squads met twice last week in Hoover — Arkansas beat UF 8-5 in the tournament 
opener Wednesday. 
Despite bowing out of the double-elimi-
nation bracket in only three games, the No. 
11 Gators (39-20) found out Monday that they earned a national seed in the NCAA Tournament, which means they will play at home for a Regional and a Super Re-gional should they advance. 
UF was given the eighth and final na-tional seed and will host Bethune-Cook-man, Jacksonville and Miami in an NCAA Regional. The Gators will take on the Wild-cats at 6:30 on Friday night.
After Friday’s loss to the Razorbacks, 
UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan and third base-
man Brandon McArthur talked about refo-
cusing and correcting defensive mistakes before hosting the Regional.
“We came here to win, 
not to go 1-2,” McArthur said. “We’re not very ex-cited about this weekend, but we have to quickly put it behind us because now 
it’s the big tournament.” 
Luckily for UF, the Razorbacks won’t be in 
Gainesville this weekend.
Arkansas coach Dave Van Horn pen-
ciled in seven freshmen — including start-ing pitcher Drew Smyly — on the lineup card Friday, and his seventh-seeded Ra-zorbacks defeated the Gators for the 10th time in their last 11 meetings, including 
each of the last six.
“They certainly got our number,” UF earns national seed

Coach of the Year.18, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, MAY 26, 2009
Adam Carolla, whose podcast I listen to on 
a near daily basis, recently put a common occurrence perfectly into words.
He described opening up the refrigerator and 
discovering an unmarked jug containing a bever-
age presumed to be milk. You take the “milk” jug 
out of the fridge and take a swig expecting an ex-plosion of dairy goodness inside of your mouth. 
As soon as the liquid hits your lips, it becomes 
apparent that the original assumption was in-correct. Involuntarily, your face scrunches up as what was thought to be milk makes its way down your throat. 
After the initial shock of the mystery beverage 
passes, you take another sip to confirm what you already suspected: The mystery jug contained or-ange juice instead. 
The adverse reaction to some freshly squeezed 
O.J. came because you were expecting dairy and got citrus instead. Once you understood what you were actually drinking, the orange juice was just as enjoyable.
Everyone has endured this at one time or an-
other, and I was forced to experience this phe-nomenon with the sport of softball.
The Gators are heading back to Oklahoma City 
for the Women’s College World Series for the sec-ond year in a row, which means I will be covering the tournament for the second year in a row.
When I started covering the UF softball team 
last spring, I was expecting milk. 
Like many Americans, baseball is my favorite 
sport. I played it for over a decade growing up and I follow the MLB with an unhealthy fervor. The mistake I made that first day in the Pressly Stadium 
press box was assum-
ing I would be taking a swig of a sport that was supposed to taste like baseball. 
In fact, I disliked 
softball because it was 
never enough like baseball and so many of its ele-ments bothered me — the high fiving and mound 
meetings after every out, throwing the ball to the 
first baseman after a strikeout, the miniature field, the pitchers’ rubber arms and most of all, slap hit-ting. 
But after a season of watching more than 75 
games, I can tell you that softball can be just as refreshing as baseball. 
The pitching is far superior to that of college 
baseball, the action is infinitely faster-paced, the 
games between two good teams have a much 
higher likelihood of being close, the women are better than you think and slap hitting is actually an effective strategy against dominant pitchers who strike nearly everyone out.  
Starting Thursday, you will have a chance to 
indulge in some of the freshest orange juice you will ever drink in your life. 
Just don’t make the mistake of assuming it’s 
supposed to taste like milk.Softball enjoyable in its own right

kmaistri@alligator.orgwould get a groundball hit at chest-
level, make the throw to Corrie Brooks at third, who would then 
complete the play with a throw to 
first. It unfolded exactly as Nelson’s 
vision predicted it would.
“It’s tough to get to this point, 
and we know it’s tough,” Nelson said. “To finally be in the College 
World Series, it’s a great feeling of 
accomplishment. But at the same 
time, it’s (a feeling of) excitement be-cause we have another tournament 
to play.”
The team celebrated its victory on 
the field after the final out of Game 2, dead-set on ringing in this year’s 
WCWS berth the right way.
“We’d kind of been planning 
what we were going to do because 
last year we just kind of jumped up 
and down and didn’t really do any-
thing,” second baseman Aja Paculba 
said. “Then this year we were just 
like, ‘We’re going all out and doing this, we’re doing that.’ I think we 
had fun this way.”
Add sadness to the list of emo-
tions the Gators felt Sunday, as the 
team’s seven seniors played their fi-nal game in Pressly Stadium. 
With two outs in the bottom of 
the seventh inning, catcher Kristina Hilberth went to the circle to tell Nelson that they were about to play their last out in their home stadium.
“The last pitch, I started crying,” 
Hilberth said. “I was like, ‘I need to 
catch this pitch first before I start 
crying.’ Thank goodness it was a changeup.”
But the Gators won’t take too 
long to soak in the victories — Nel-
son said she’d focus on enjoying the 
wins until 5 p.m. Sunday (two hours after the game’s finish) as the team 
has yet to accomplish the goal it set 
before the season 
even started: win-ning a national 
championship.
To improve on 
last year’s semifi-
nals loss, UF will 
need its batters 
to come through 
more than they did Sunday.  The 
Gators went a combined 7 for 42 against the Bears, and the California pitchers retired UF in order in nine of 13 innings.
Paculba had all three of the 
Gators’ RBIs on the day, including a home run on the 14th pitch of the team’s first at-bat in Game 1.
“As the at-bat was going on lon-
ger, I was just like, ‘I am not getting out now after all this,’” Paculba said. “When I hit it, I knew I hit it hard but I didn’t think it was going over.”Offense sputters in victories

UF outfielder Jonathan Pigott tied the school record for most home runs in the SEC Tournament with 
three in three games. The junior had only hit two homers during the regular season. 
HOOVER, Ala.  Getting sent home is a lot easier to 
take when you know you’ll be stay-ing there for an NCAA regional.
Despite its 1-2 performance at the South-
eastern Conference Tournament, No. 11 
UF (39-20) earned the No. 8 national seed 
and will host a Regional next weekend and a Super Regional should the Gators advance. 
They have the potential to make it to the 
College World Series, but if they don’t make some improvements, they’ll be watching rather than hosting a Super Regional. 
“We can’t come out as flat as we did to-
day because these games are so valuable,” third baseman Brandon McArthur said. “Our goal is to get to Omaha, and we can’t sit back and let it slip by. We can’t give the other teams outs as the games go on. Two more losses and our season is over.”
To avoid those two losses, here are a 
few areas UF needs to straighten out:PiTChing DEPTh: Stephen Locke has 
become the team’s ace, and while he’s experienced and cool under fire, he isn’t the kind of dominant pitcher the Gators would like to have leading the way. He relies a lot on curves and changeups, and 
behind him, there are a lot of freshmen. 
Anthony DeSclafani and Nick Maronde are the current No. 2 and 3 starters, but neither of them go very deep into games. That has to change for UF to avoid wear-ing out the bullpen, and Patrick Keating needs to keep the momentum he created in two solid relief outings in Hoover.
SPrEaD ThE PowEr aroUnD:  The 
Gators need to have powerful hits 
throughout the lineup, and as it stands, 
there’s potential for that now. The real problem is that the best hitters on the team are seldom clicking at the same time. The postseasons of any sport are dictated by who gets hot at the right time. Avery Barnes, Jonathan Pigott and Preston Tucker are all on fire, and UF needs Josh Adams, Brandon McAr-
thur, Matt den 
Dekker and Buddy Munroe to step up and be more consistent in the coming weeks. If 
that happens, the Gators will have a formi-dable offense. If not, they’ll sputter.
LimiT ThE ErrorS:  As UF found out 
during the SEC Tournament, making 
errors is a quick way to kill momentum. 
The Gators lead the SEC in errors, and the six they committed in two games against Arkansas played a huge role in their de-mise. A lot of this falls on shortstop Mike Mooney, who made a few great plays in the tournament, but the routine plays and throws need to be automatic this time of year. They weren’t in Hoover.
TakE aD vanT agE oF ThE BrEakS: 
Sometimes the ball bounces your way, 
sometimes it doesn’t. In Hoover, the ball mostly bounced UF’s way, and the Gators 
didn’t capitalize. Arkansas was without its 
best hitter, an umpire was hit with what would have been an RBI single for the Razorbacks on Wednesday to save a run, and the Razorbacks shuffled their lineup to a freshman-heavy set for Friday’s game. A perfect example of how things went was when McArthur hit a deep fly to right on Friday, the right fielder flat-out missed 
it, and McArthur was thrown out at third 
after he tried to stretch the double, against third base coach Craig Bell’s call. When things go their way in the NCAA Tourna-ment, the Gators need to make the best of it.By ANTHONY CHIANG

Despite the presence of a talented group of 
seniors gunning for their first national cham-
pionship in their final season, UF’s junior golf-
ers might be feeling the most pressure heading 
into the final tournament of the season.
The No. 6 UF men’s golf team will send 
out the same five golfers that won the NCAA Southwest Regional to represent the Gators in the NCAA Championships starting today in Toledo, Ohio. 
Seniors Billy Horschel, Toby Ragland, Will 
Strickler and juniors Tyson Alexander and 
Tim McKenney will attempt to win UF’s fifth 
men’s golf national title. While this will mark the final event the seniors play in, the juniors might be feeling even more pressure than them 
as they realize they have a shrinking window 
of opportunity.
“I think the juniors feel a big sense of ur-
gency because they know they’ve got three pretty good players in Horschel, Ragland and Strickler that are not going to be part of this team next year,” Alexander said.
After the Gators’ first tournament win away 
from home since 2006 at the NCAA Southwest 
Regional on May 14-16, the team seems to be 
playing its best at the perfect time. 
From the outside, it appears as if coaching 
has a lot to do with that, but coach Buddy Al-exander made it clear that this is one aspect of team management that is beyond his control.
“I don’t really know how to make a team or 
player peak at the right time,” he said.Although Alexander can’t guarantee the 
impact his coaching has had on the team, one thing is for certain: The confidence the team has gained from finishing in first place at the 
regional tournament will prove to be invaluable this week.
“I know that winning 
will increase the team’s confidence, so I think this 
will have a pretty big effect 
on us,” Alexander said. 
The team has taken part 
in an event on the Toledo 
golf course, where the national championship 
will be played, for the past four seasons. 
The Gators’ best finish in the tournament, 
the Inverness Invitational, was in 2005, when they finished in first place. However, the 
team’s worst finish came in the fall, when UF 
finished in ninth place. 
Nonetheless, UF hopes its familiarity with 
the course will work to its advantage in its at-tempt to win its first NCAA Championship since 2001.
“We’ve got a little more knowledge on 
this course than you might see from the other teams,” Alexander said.
From the way the Gators handled the re-
gional round, Alexander is encouraged by his team’s postseason mind-set.
“In a regional, there is pressure because it’s 
a possible end to your season, and when you have the guts to come through in that situa-tion, you have to feel pretty good about your-self,” he said.UF MEN’S GOLFSeniors get one last shot at nC aa Championship

O’Sullivan said. “I thought we 
were in a good frame of mind today though, I really did.”
The teams committed a com-
bined four errors, which led to 3 
unearned runs for the Gators and 5 
for the Razorbacks. Smyly’s 3.2 in-nings pitched were the most logged by a hurler for either side, and 10 batters reached base via a walk or hit by pitch.
Though the game was sloppy 
on both sides, Arkansas freshman Zack Cox proved to be the differ-
ence, both in the batter’s box and 
on the mound.
After the Razorbacks fell behind 
3-2 heading into the bottom of the fourth inning, Cox hit the top of the scoreboard with a 2-run moon shot off UF reliever Greg Larson, spark-ing a 5-run inning.
“When he hammered that ball, I 
think there were a lot of guys say-ing, ‘Wow,’” Van Horn said. “If you hit one out of this ballpark, you hit it, and if you hit one off the top of the scoreboard, then you really hit it.”
The Gators found themselves 
down 8-3 heading into the seventh inning before they began to chip away at the deficit. With two outs, senior Avery Barnes chopped a ball to the shortstop, and an error by freshman Tim Carver allowed McArthur and Matt den Dekker to 
score for UF.
The next batter was junior Jona-
than Pigott, who crushed his third 
home run of the tournament to left-center field. Pigott, who hit two homers in the regular season and two in each of his first two seasons, tied the record set by Chuck Haz-zard in 1996 for most longballs by a 
Gator in the SEC Tournament.
“(Friday), I think we swung 
the bats the best we have all year 
against them,” McArthur said. “We thought we had the momentum, but we couldn’t hold on to it.”
In the bottom half of the inning, 
the Razorbacks pushed across two insurance runs, including an RBI 
single from Cox in his final at-bat of 
the day.
When it came time to protect the 
lead in the eighth, the third base-man moved to the mound. Cox, who pitched just 16 innings prior to this appearance, finished out the game without allowing a base run-ner.Gators knocked out of SEC Tournament after sloppy play leads to two losses against Razorbacks

side of the pond.
Now, it probably won’t be 
easy for Calathes to come back 
to the NBA after a few years overseas.
According to reports, 
Panathinaikos wants Calathes to officially withdraw from the NBA Draft, but his agent may try to keep his name in the hat.
The one thing he needs 
to avoid is giving pro teams the impression that he’s run-ning from the challenge of the NBA. That could be tough to overcome.
I don’t know what Nick’s 
life goals are, but if he just wants to play the sport he loves, win games and make a bunch of money doing it, he made a great decision.
European basketball is on 
the rise, and Calathes is the latest American import to hit the scene. The league can only get better from here, and there’s nothing but room for Calathes to grow.
On the flip side, there is a 
clear loser in the situation: UF. More specifically, Billy Dono-
van.
Things haven’t gone so 
well since the back-to-back 
national titles. 
The Gators missed the 
tournament two years in a 
row, lost Marreese Speights 
to the NBA and Jai Lucas to a transfer.
Alex Tyus threatened to 
transfer a few weeks ago, Al-
lan Chaney went through with 
it, recruits have withdrawn verbal commitments, and now the team’s best player is 
skipping off to Europe.
UF is looking more and 
more like a program in disar-
ray.
The message I’m get-
ting from all this is that these players aren’t happy under Donovan. Many of them came here with the notion that titles 
would keep raining down on 
the O’Dome, but as the strug-
gles have hit, Donovan and his players don’t seem to be connecting that well.
Calathes was always 
viewed as Donovan’s Gold-en Boy, but it’s obvious that 
wasn’t true. Calathes went 
against his coach’s wishes by 
playing in Greece last sum-mer, and now he is basically saying the Gators are pretty 
far down his list of priorities.
There’s absolutely nothing 
wrong with that, but it doesn’t 
reflect well on the status of the program.
If this string of events hap-
pened to a coach who wasn’t coming off an incredible few seasons, there would be talk of job security. Billy D doesn’t 
(at least he shouldn’t) have 
to worry about that now, but 
athletics director Jeremy Foley needs to make it clear that this can’t keep up.
Foley needs to back Dono-
van in public but tell him to regain control of the team. If he can’t do that in the next 
three years and the Gators 
keep struggling on the court, 
then it might be time for some re-evaluating.

No. 8 Marrit Boonstra made it all 
the way to the quarterfinals of the 
NCAA singles bracket before losing. 
Her championship run ended at the 
hands of Miami’s Laura Vallverdu. After dropping the first set, the junior bounced back, pushing the 24th-ranked player to a third set by taking a second-set tiebreaker. Vallverdu won the final stanza, closing the book on Boonstra’s season with a 6-1, 6-7 (9), 6-3 win. 
Boonstra started her run to the 
quarterfinals with a shaky 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (5) first-round win against California’s Bojana Bobusic on Wednesday. On Thursday, Boonstra defeated Georgia 
Tech’s Christy Striplin 6-1, 6-4. She 
continued her streak Friday by beating Stanford’s No. 7 Hilary Barte 7-5, 6-1.
 “I had to figure out her game, and 
after that it went pretty easy,” Boonstra said of Stanford’s Barte. “She is a great player, but she is half of the size of me, so I was trying to get the balls up high-er than her, and it worked.”
Boonstra and Jo Mather advanced 
to the second round of the doubles bracket before losing to the Arizona 
State duo of Micaela Hein and Kelcy 
McKenna 6-4, 1-6, 6-3.
The No. 25 tandem of Jessica Alex-
ander and Anastasia Revzina, along with the No. 16 men’s doubles team of Antoine Benneteau and Joey Bur-
khardt, suffered first-round defeats.No. 8 Boonstra falls in
