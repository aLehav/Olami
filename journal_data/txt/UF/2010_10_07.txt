CLEVELAND, Tenn. (AP) — Bradley 
County jail officials have been outfitting new 
inmates with old underwear worn by other prisoners, a practice they said is safe because the clothing is thoroughly washed. Bradley County Sheriff Jim Ruth talked about the policy during a discussion with county com -
missioners Tuesday.
Sheriff’s Department spokesman Bob 
Gault told The Associated Press on Wednes-day the jail has a longtime practice of issuing everything incoming prisoners wear and said the clothing is sanitized.
The Tennessee Corrections Institute in-
spects jails, and assistant director Peggy Saw-yer said reissuing underwear is allowed. She said her agency’s rules also require that pris-oner clothing be washed twice a week.
The Tennessee Department of Correction 
gives inmates new underwear. Spokeswoman Dorinda Carter said “when an inmate leaves, his underwear leaves with him.”

Imagine a world where all hopes, feelings 
and emotions are irrelevant. 
Hot and cold are just lukewarm. 
Colors are turned into a gray muddle, 
and conversations are nothing more than a 
string of words.
In the days following a winter earthquake 
that jolted the island of Haiti, this has become 
Sky Georges’ world.Two Worlds. One Heart. 
No Answers
Standing before a crowd of 400 at a vigil on 
an uncharacteristically warm night in Janu-ary, Georges, a criminology senior at UF, is no longer who he was a week ago. In the span of a few sunrises and sunsets, he has become a 
breathing shadow — barely recognizable.
As a pastor drones on about the need for 
hope in a time of great darkness, Georges’ 
mind wanders. He pictures the hospital where he was born and how it is  probably no longer standing. He sees the kids he played soccer with crushed under a pile of broken buildings, their  faces now gray and caked with debris. 
The pastor’s lyrics of “Lean on Me” give 
way to another wave of sniffles. Georges’ thoughts now pause on Monday , the day he last spoke to his father, who had flown to Port-au-Prince for his brother’s wedding.
“Have a good trip,” Georges told his father. 
“I hope you have fun.”
In the days following the Jan. 12 earth-
quake that left thousands of people dead and millions more displaced, Georges has not given himself any time to let the gravity of the situation sink in. There are meetings for newly formed response clubs to attend, 5K races to plan for and dozens more in need of a hug. No time for reality. It didn’t take long, however, for reality to find him. Like he had done throughout the past week, 
Georges took center stage, this time at First As-sembly of God in Gainesville. Just like all his other speeches he gave that week – solemn, yet hopeful – he speaks into the microphone with a slow but firm cadence. The sentences are like all the other ones spoken in the pre-vious days, but this time something different 
happens. A sudden rush begins to pull from 
within. He pays it no mind and continues. The pull becomes more powerful. It sparks with every reference to God’s love and heats up with every gaze at the teary congregation. Then comes a simple prayer of thanksgiving in Creole that, although foreign to some, is un-derstood by all in the pews. 
“Jezi merci deske ou fidel nan tout bagay 
mem nan trambleman tè ”—Jesus, thank you, because you are faithful even in earthquakes.
For the first time, in that span of several un-
certain days, Georges wept. 
The Long Flight Home
Eight months have elapsed since the tec-
tonic plates budged underneath Haiti. The streets, once strewn with the crushed bodies of the young and old, are now alive with the sounds of sputtering engines and shrill horns. 
Survivors continue to rise at dawn to milk the 
cows, feed the livestock and till a rough soil.  
Yet there is more work to be done beyond 
laying a few bricks or drilling a well that will yield water without poisonous microbes. A nation’s identity must be bolstered. Faith and hope can’t feed swollen stomachs or fund the education of children, many of whom cannot afford the steep tuition of $10 USD, but it may 
help spark a step toward resolution.
For the 12 people of First Assembly who 
will make a five-day journey down to the 
small Caribbean nation, this will be their mis-sion. The success or failure of their trip won’t lie in how much they open their wallets but by how much they open their hearts. 
For the Rev . George Dumaine, a pastor at 
First Assembly and the voice behind the mu-
sic at the January vigil, this will be a trip that 
has been in the making for generations. His 
ancestors, missionaries from V enezuela, came 
to Haiti at the end of the 19th century where

they mixed with the natives,  made 
a home for their sons and daughters and built a church that still stands. Currently , Dumaine has hundreds of uncles, aunts, cousins and dis-
tant relatives living in Haiti, many 
of whom he only knows as passing names spoken by family . 
Yet for Dumaine, a UF graduate 
whose family refers to him as “the little American,” his first trip to Haiti will not be one for family reunions. His work will leave him no time for visits. There are families without 
homes, children without food and 
some, possibly , without hope. 
“When the earthquake hit, I 
wasn’t concerned for my family because I knew people would look after them,” he said. “I was more concerned for the orphans and other people who didn’t have a family to look after them.” 
While the decision to go to Haiti 
and help his “other family” wasn’t a hard one, the preparation was an-other matter. Dumaine said he never doubted God’s existence in the face of tragedy but still  faced difficult moments when he couldn’t help but ask what God had in store for Haiti.
“It’s kind of like when a coach 
makes a call that you have no idea why he did and you’re left thinking to yourself ‘What’s the plan?’” he said.
In the weeks leading up to the 
trip, Dumaine spent hours alone 
reflecting on scripture and praying 
alone.  His pleas were not so much for personal safety but for strength to provide a positive effect on the lives of Haitians. He did not want to be viewed as another American 
getting in the way .  By the time he 
boards his flight to Port-au-Prince, Dumaine has no doubt that where he is going is where he needs to be.  
“I’m trusting that the coach 
knows best,” he said. 
Sitting alongside Dumaine on the 
flight is Sarah Fandler, a Gainesville resident and one of the 12 aid work-
ers. With a skin tone that would 
make Caribbean sun beams salivate and a “Leave it to Beaver” voice chipper and honed, Fandler looks more like a misplaced human maca-damia nut than a missionary . Yet for 
the housewife and mother of three, 
there is no one more qualified to go. Growing up, Fandler traveled to nu-merous Third World countries with her Christian missionary parents, encountering some of the bleak-est conditions a person could live in. While girls her age picked out dresses for the winter formal, Fan-
dler spent her time evangelizing in 
Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, where those living on $1 a day were considered “doing well.”  
“A lot of times it’s so overwhelm-
ing you don’t know how to be ef-fective,” she recalled. “Your heart’s going to break even if you have the Lord in your heart—you have to be 
pretty dead inside for it not to.” 
One would think that having un-
dergone those experiences at such a 
fragile age, and the prospect of rais-ing three children under the age of seven, would be enough motivation to stay away from anywhere resem-bling the Third World. But, it didn’t take long for Fandler to know what 
she had to do.
“I didn’t think I was being a good 
mother if I didn’t set an example for 
my children of sacrificing to others.”
Instead of facing a litany of com-
plaints and tantrums, her young family gave their blessing and more.
“Mommy , take me with you. I 
want to go with you,” pleaded Fan-
dler’s 6-year-old son Daniel. When 
she explained to him that a ravaged country festering with disorder wasn’t a place for little children, he quietly went to his room only  to return a few minutes later with his arms full of toys and clothes. 
 As the hours between Florida 
and Haiti passed, Dumaine and 
Fandler couldn’t help but feel a 
sense of anticipation at going to a new country . 
Georges had a different take. Having lived in Haiti until he 
was 12, Sky dreaded the thought of seeing his family’s homeland — his  homeland — reduced to rubble. He  heard the stories of families living in 
overcrowded, makeshift tents on the 
outskirts of cities and of children not going to school out of fear that roof and walls might cave in.
“I kept telling myself ‘I’m not go-
ing to Haiti;’ I’m not ready for this,” he said. “How do I relate?”
But there were children who 
needed him. These doubts, he told 
himself, were normal and would 
wash away once he saw the soccer games in the street and heard the traditional songs and dances that welcomed travelers at the airport. A clear sky and a busy airport 
filled with men in business suits carrying expensive luggage gave as-surances that all was well. Yet as he walked through the winding hall-ways, Georges couldn’t shake the 
feeling that something was off. 
As he made his way for the door, 
it hit him—the songs never came. 
Things, he thought, are going to 
be different.
Beaten but Never Broken
When a country has been sub-
jected to a never-ending onslaught 
of poverty, natural disasters, fam-ines and failed regimes, some argue that God chooses to conveniently get 
lost.  In Haiti, it  took Georges only a 
day to find Him.
For the village of Meilleur, a 
community 45 minutes outside of Port-au-Prince, Sunday is not just a day of holy obligation; it’s a day to celebrate life. Young children, who on any other day would be running in the streets with either no shirt or 
no pants, come to church wearing 
sharp black suits. Some fit, but most don’t. 
This — any other day a glorified 
wooden pavilion — is God’s house.      
“God is there as hope,” Georges 
recalled. “He’s the certainty that things will change.”
After the service, the Americans 
make the long journey by covered caravan into the capital city for a tour of the presidential palace. While the buildings grow taller as the caravan rumbles toward its des-tination, rows of overflowing tents and fallen houses pancaked on top of each other betray any appearance of metropolitan life. 
In the distance, a tall Haitian flag 
billows in the breeze, the embodi-ment of a faulty system of Haitian government juxtaposed with a sym-bol of  national pride that, with ev-ery whip of the wind, reverberates a heartbeat. 
As Georges and Dumaine make 
their way around the premises, they 
are approached by two professional 
beggars who poke and prod for change. Despite previous instruc-tions, they cave in, giving them mints and whatever else jingles in their pockets. After witnessing this, Pastor Samuel Lucien, an indige-nous Haitian  who accompanies the Americans, pulls the two aside. 
“We’re not wanting money ,” the 
pastor says. “We want development. You need to invest in us so the Hai-tian people can be self-sustaining.”
For the American travelers, these 
next four days will be all about in-vestment. Aside from providing  Haitians with basic humanitarian needs, they will also train teachers 
to better educate students, instruct 
natives on the nuances of business in an effort to jump-start a morbid economy and provide spiritual for -
mation and guidance that will help them confront these tall tasks. 
While teaching methods and 
micro-loans can only go so far in a short time, the Haitians’ confidence 
is far more advanced than any tech-
nology, especially among the youth.
“Here’s a group of people who 
have had every hardship thrown their way and they’re still laughing, still telling jokes,” Dumaine said. “That says something about the Hai-tian people.”But behind the smiles are stories 
that no punchline can undo. 
There’s the one about the girl 
who, during the earthquake, ran 
aimlessly with her eyes shut, hop-
ing to be spared from a grave of dry-wall and concrete. It was when she opened her eyes that she noticed she was covered in debris and drops of blood from other bodies.
But for the children, these are sto-
ries from the past. Their focus is now on building a “new” Haiti. Instead 
of throwing around words such as 
“rich,” “wealth” and “power,” they talk, always in terms of “we,” about a country with a sanitation system that will clean up the garbage swell-ing in the streets, a water supply free of E. coli and bacteria and a govern-ment that will provide basic health 
care to both the sick and healthy.
They want to be the ones to do it.
“How could I not like here?” 
one boy told Georges when asked if he liked Haiti and planned to stay. “Haiti is my home.”
 Some, such as Dumaine, share 
the natives’ optimism.
“Haiti is not a lost cause,” he says. 
“The Haitian people have what it takes to rebuild, and by the power of God, they will be a success story.”
Georges, however, remains un-
certain. 
High on the Mountaintop
Tucked away behind a winding 
streak of valleys and vegetation is a place that doesn’t get shown on CNN. Here, craftsmen line the un-paved dirt roads, whittling away on 
slices of timber to the soundtrack of 
singing tropical birds. 
All these things pay homage to 
the mountains. From its peaks, one can clearly see the scars of destruc-tion that cut through the raw earth. These scars, however, are powerless to the sea and sky that form the hori-zon before Georges and Dumaine. This, they realize, is a beautiful 
country . 
In less than 24 hours, they , along 
with the others they came with, will board a plane and leave for  a place far different than the one they have lived in for the previous days. 
Dumaine, whom the children 
playfully referred to as “white boy,” 
gained more than an understanding 
of his family’s roots. He has gained a new family . 
“It’s a miracle to see how much 
people love you,” he said. 
After a final meal laden with sto-
ries of the characters met during the trip, Georges and Dumaine make their way outside for a moment of 
reflection. Standing across from their 
house, they noticed, was a group of neighborhood youth ranging from 6 to 25 years old.
“We will be here when you leave 
tomorrow,” they told their Ameri-
can friends. “When you go back, 
please do not forget us.” 
They talk, mostly about light-
hearted subjects. Dumaine excuses himself for a few minutes, only to reappear with a guitar. 
The chords begin to form a 
rhythm, and the children begin to bob and sway back and forth.
Dumaine plucks the strings as a 
few voices begin to emerge, offer -
ing freestyle lyrics. The clapping becomes louder. And then the lyrics become one. 
Open the eyes of my heart, Lord 
(clap, clap) Open the eyes of my heart (clap, clap) I want to see you (clap, clap) I want to see you!
It was in those few seconds of 
reverent melody that Sky found what he had been seeking. Between those notes was a sense of accep-tance from two different walks of life. The connection he had for so long desired was alive.
The music had finally come back

Alligator Contributing Writer
The Dean of Students Office 
and Student Government held 
a town hall forum in the Reitz Union auditorium on Wednes-
day night to discuss student con-
cerns and complaints on campus, but something was missing.
No students showed up.
“Next time, we should sched-
ule a less confusing time that 
doesn’t conflict with Asian Kalei-doscope Month,” Student Body President Ashton Charles said.The meeting had been sched-
uled much farther in advance than the Kaleidoscope Month opening, which drew about 400 students and was held next door 
in the Reitz Union Grand Ball-
room.
Instead of a town hall meet-
ing, SG members used the time to discuss issues and areas where 
the group should be focusing its 
attention, such as extending the deadline for the drop-add policy and improving relationships 
between students who live on 
campus and their Resident As-sistants.
The group agreed that chang-
es should be made to the envi-ronment of Preview.
“When you’re there, it feels 
like you’re deciding the rest of your life, which you’re not,” Charles said. “It’s stressful. I’ve seen girls, and even guys, crying around me.”
SG members discussed how 
to better organize future town hall meetings as well as potential focuses, such as safety, identity, 
civility, tolerance and transpor -
tation. Students snub town hall forum

About 400 students got a little life lesson Wednesday 
night about what it means to stand out. 
The Asian Kaleidoscope Opening Ceremony in the Reitz 
Union Grand Ballroom opened with a welcome speech from 
Phillip Cheng, Asian Kaleidoscope Month executive direc-tor. 
He said the month-long celebration is meant to explore 
the histories, cultures and contributions of Asians and Asian-Americans. 
Cheng said the purpose of this opening ceremony was to 
serve as a grand kick-off of a new decade of Asian Kaleido-
scope months to come. 
The theme of this year’s Asian Kaleidoscope Month is 
“Hold the Hyphen,” which is meant to challenge the percep-
tion of “what it means to be hyphenated,” 
according to Cheng.
The hyphen between the words Asian-
American demonstrates the inability for a person to simply be American, he said.
Former NFL football player Esera Tu-
aolo, who is Samoan but was raised in Ha-waii, spoke about coming out of the closet.
Tuaolo was introduced and talked about 
a situation he had faced a few minutes be-
fore walking onto the stage. 
 “I went back there to wait, and a gentleman there was 
like, ‘You’re gay?’ I said yes. He’s like, ‘You’re a Christian?’ and I said yes,” Tuaolo began.
“I just wanted to bring that up because before, I used to 
run,” Tuaolo said. “I used to have anxiety attacks and run away from situations like that, but not anymore because when you live in your truth you find your strength to stand 
your ground.”
Spoken word artist Alvin Lau also performed during the 
second half of the opening ceremony.
Asian Kaleidoscope Month and New Student Programs 
paid a combined total of about $10,000 for both acts.Students celebrate

Today’s question: Should the   animals at SeaWorld be set free?
148 TOTAL VOTES77% YES23% NOWednesday’s question: Should marijuana be decriminalized?Consider this while fighting boredom
As mid-October and the first hint of cool air creeps 
into our city, students at the university find them-selves already preparing for midterm exams.
Understandably, the mid-semester monotony can be-
come overwhelming. Classes seem to get repetitive, and it seems harder and harder to convince yourself to make it to that 7:25 a.m. lecture.
If the thought of only being halfway through the semes-
ter is bringing you down, allow me to offer some perspec-tive and whimsical thoughts on the world to get your mind off the monotony.
Class may seem to be dragging on, but society is pro-
gressing at an exponential rate.
Consider the fact that the Wright Brothers made their 
maiden flight in 1903. It lasted all of 12 seconds. A mere 38 years later, planes were used to deliver bombs from Japan 
in a devastating attack on Hawaii. Only 28 years after that, 
humans landed on the moon.
It’s difficult not to get distracted by our cell phones while 
pretending to pay attention to the lecture. But consider that the technology in your cell phone has greater computing 
power within it than any of the Apollo missions did.
Speaking of space missions, America launched the Voy-
ager 1 into space 33 years ago, and by now it has traveled 
almost 11 billion miles. Currently it resides somewhere in 
the outer region of our solar system, and we are still able to 
communicate with it via radio signals.
And yet, how often do we all lose cell phone service 
when we walk out of class?
Do you ever accidentally touch the bottom of the desk 
while in lecture and immediately have a strong urge to wash your hands?
Interestingly, the human body contains anywhere from two to nine pounds of bacteria at any given moment. Our body constantly fights the massive presence of bac-
teria. At this point, your body has 
probably had 10 trillion mini battles with bacteria, yet you have won each of them as surely as you sit here and 
read.
Hunger seems to hurt the most as 
the last ten minutes of class shuffle by.
And when it comes to hunger and bacteria, we owe our 
ability to properly digest lunch to a small bacterium called E. coli. If one of these organisms were subjected to the prop-
er conditions and temperature, it could double in about 20 minutes. If this process persisted through the night, there would be one million of them. If the process were allowed 
to continue for a little less than three weeks, the bacteria 
could cover the earth, in a few months be larger than earth and in a few thousand years be larger than the known uni-verse.
Fortunately, we are keeping these organisms’ multipli-
cative tendencies in check.
Perhaps class isn’t so bad after all. Hey, at least you are 
alive. Fifty-four million of the planet’s  population will die within the next year.
You are a unique, independent and highly complex or -

Class may drone on, but the universe is a fascinating 
thing. Too bad the subject matter at hand isn’t always as 
entertaining.

every Thursday.Westboro Baptist idiots
An unpopular Kansas 
“church” reminiscent of our very own Dove 
wants you to know God is your enemy . 
As the Supreme Court 
heard arguments Wednesday in Snyder v . Phelps, the case involving the Westboro Bap-tist Church’s protests at sol-diers’ funerals (the “church” says God is killing soldiers for America’s radical tolerance of gay men and women), the 
highest court in the land was 
posed with a uniquely per -
sonal argument that could po-tentially redefine Americans’ First Amendment rights.
Let’s look at this objective-
ly, Gators.
We’re not God, so we 
won’t speak for the Man Up-
stairs. We really hate when the 
crazies do that. But we find it hard to believe God “hates fags,” as this “church” says. We find it hard to believe our creator would kill soldiers left and right because of some-thing completely unrelated as America loving its gay citi-zens. 
And we’ll go so far as to 
say the Westboro members, particularly the pastor, Fred Phelps, create nothing more than the festering pile of en-trails in which even most 
staunchly conservative Amer -
icans want to see devoured by 
parasites. 
Forever marring a griev-
ing father’s (Snyder) son’s fu-neral by protesting with such heinously misguided signs is despicable at best.
With that said, ruling in fa-
vor of Snyder and reinstating a previous court’s $5 million retribution in a case where free speech did not invoke physical harm would be en-tirely detrimental and con-trary to our rights to speech.
We must remember, re-
gardless of how much ha-
tred we might harbor for a 
misguided group of radicals, their speech is just as impor -
tant as our ability to voice our disdain for them.
Shamu is shaking his head. 
When a SeaWorld Orlando killer whale mysteriously 
fell fatally ill Monday evening, her death became the 
third killer whale death in just four months, and the 13th in 
the past 14 years. 
And that’s not to mention the death of SeaWorld Orlan-
do’s Dawn Brancheau in February when the 12,000-pound Tilikum drowned his 40-year-old trainer. 
And did we forget to mention Tilikum is also responsible 
for the 1999 death of another man and one of three whales responsible for killing another trainer in 1991 at Sealand of the Pacific? 
It’s shameful of us amid our amusement-seeking bore-
dom, smitten between our Shamu bars and fanny packs, to 
expect these marine behemoths to act as if everything were 
just splendid when confining a six-ton whale to one of Sea-World’s swimming pools is comparable to confining a hu-man to a bathtub its entire life. 
Of course, our hearts go out to the families of those Sea-
World employees killed as a result of company negligence.
But, then again, why should anyone be surprised when a 
killer whale attacks? It’s kind of in the name. 
The death of the 25-year-old killer whale Kalina on Mon-
day evening from a “sudden, mysterious” illness only further demonstrates that humans are not and will never be capable of properly caring and recreating a whale’s natural habitat.
And as the Orlando-based amusement park faces its 
toughest public scrutiny in its history, perhaps SeaWorld should realize that if it truly cares for its animals it should let its “family” swim free — in the oceans. Free Tilly

Letters to the Editor
Marijuana is a God-given right
Sean Quinn is mistaken when suggesting 
that Florida should decriminalize marijuana. 
It’s clearly time to completely re-legalize can-nabis for responsible adults.
Another reason to stop punishing and per -
secuting citizens for using the relatively
safe, God-given plant that doesn’t get men-
tioned is because it is biblically correct since God indicates He created all the seed-bearing plants, saying they’re all good on literally the first page (Genesis 1:11-12 and 29-30). The only Biblical restriction placed on cannabis is that it be accepted with thankfulness (see 1 Timothy 4:1-5).  Ending cannabis prohibition is one of 
the most important issues of our time.

Decriminalizing marijuana a good idea
Sean Quinn’s Wednesday column was 
right on the money, and for those readers who 
got that knee-jerk “Keep dreaming, stoner!” reaction,try to think rationally about the issue.
I do not use marijuana. But this doesn’t 
mean I’m blind to the problems and damages caused by prohibition and ignorance. 
We teach our kids in school that marijuana 
is as bad as cocaine, heroin and methamphet-amine by lumping these drugs together into one collective evil. 
When kids try marijuana, they recognize 
it is not a dangerous drug. Maybe the reason why marijuana seems to be an alleged “gate-way drug” is young people are discovering the government has been actively lying to us and not acting in our best interests by not pro-
viding transparent and clear information so 
we may make informed decisions.
If you do not use marijuana and believe 
you have no interest in this issue, think again. Not only are your taxes putting your nonvio-lent peers behind bars and out of jobs, you are
also paying the opportunity cost of redi-
recting the cash flow of marijuana sales from law-abiding citizens and government and into the pockets of drug dealers and cartels. 
So let’s drop the nuclear bomb and win this 
drug war. Decriminalize marijuana.

Cycling accident reminds us of safety
Alfredo Kiernan’s cycling accident with a 
pedestrian on Stadium Road should remind us that we all share our spaces.
Whether we are cyclists, pedestrians or 
motorists, we all become obstacles and threats 
when we don’t follow the law or we act in non-
predictable ways. This accident could have been avoided if the pedestrian had walked in the  crosswalk.  
Coming down the hill on Stadium Road, I 
have a hard time stopping suddenly when the stray pedestrian hops off the sidewalk without looking. On my clumsy , slow hybrid, I’d be 
lucky to hit 20 miles per hour. A cyclist 
wouldn’t be able to stop at all. So, I ride de-fensively. When a pedestrian steps out into the crosswalk, I have to anticipate where that pe-
destrian will be when I get there. Should I con-
tinue straight, slow down if possible, or veer? I have to assume the pedestrian will continue to walk. We all need to move predictably and de-liberately . Cars need to signal turns and stop before intersections, not over crosswalks. Cy-clists need to ride in the proper bike lanes and watch for errant pedestrians. Pedestrians need to look and continue walking when they step 
into the road.  If you stop like a deer in head-
lights, you might end up as road kill. No one wants that. We all just want to get to home, work, school or lunch safe and happy.

Reader supports pro-marijuana articles
I couldn’t agree more with Sean Quinn’s 
Wednesday column. Alcohol is a far worse drug than marijuana, and the fact that mari-juana is still illegal in most states and federally is absolutely insane. I would love to see the 
Alligator do an in-depth article on recent stud-
ies that have been done to support the idea of marijuana being legal.   I’m 30, and our gen-eration, which is soon to be in power, largely thinks marijuana is no big deal. And it isn’t.
This is a college town where a lot of people 
(not just students) smoke marijuana.I know people would love to see more anti-marijua-na-prohibition articles in your newspaper. 
There’s no doubt in my mind.

HR6156 good for Alachua families
Recently , Florida’s child-welfare system 
was given a 10-month extension to its Title 
IV-E waiver allowing organizations the flex-ibility to use federal funds to serve children in their own homes and reducing the number of 
children in foster care. 
In addition, the House of Representatives 
unanimously passed bill HR 6156 last week, 
authorizing all states to extend the waiver for five years with a five-year renewal. It is now time for the bill to go before the Senate, which, if passed, would be a giant step in helping chil-dren and families throughout the U.S.
Here, in north central Florida, the Title IV-E 
waiver helps fund prevention and diversion services to more than 1,000 families.
This enables agencies such as Partnership 
for Strong Families to assist families they pre-
viously would have been unable to serve. Not 
only does the Title IV-E waiver help to de-crease the number of children in care through the use of these programs, but it is part of a statewide initiative to redesign Florida’s foster care system as a whole, creating more hope for children and families. Research has shown children who enter foster care are at greater risk of juvenile delinquency , later mental 
health problems, teenage pregnancy and have 
an increased school dropout rate. The Title IV-E waiver will give our staff the chance to prevent these outcomes by providing family-centered, strength-based services with the goal of keeping the family safely together.
Just more than a year ago, Partnership for 
Strong Families partnered with the Alachua County Library District to open The Library 
Partnership. This locally-based program aims 
to provide preventative-care services to fami-lies in Alachua County by offering central-
ized social services through a neighborhood 
resource center combined with a full-service public library branch. It is not uncommon to see The Library Partnership filled with after-school youth working on computers, a Girl Scout troop meeting and supportive conver -
sations being held between patrons and staff. These typesof partnerships wouldn’t be as suc-cessful if it weren’t for the Title IV-E waiver.
At Partnership for Strong Families we 
strive to keep families together by providing family centered preventative and diversion services. The bill will not only provide hope for our children and families in Florida, but it will provide hope for children and families throughout the United States as they imple-ment the same model of care we have proven successful in our region.

From folk troubadour to electric jester to ev -
er-touring elder statesman of rock ‘n’ roll, Bob 
Dylan and his storied artistic career have filled books, movies and varying levels of philosophi-
cal discussions for years.
Friday evening, Dylan is bringing his music 
to Gainesville. It will be the fourth time in his 
career that he has made a pit-stop in The Gator Nation.
“He’s the voice of a generation,” said Kyle 
Calhoun, chairman of Student Government Productions, which organized the show.In July, Calhoun was looking for an act ap-
propriate for a Friday before a home game, a show that would bring generations together.
At first considering country acts, he caught 
wind of Dylan’s plans for a college tour.
After contacting Dylan’s representatives and 
learning that they were interested, Calhoun re -
alized the opportunity this would create.
“It’s definitely a once-in-a-lifetime experi-
ence,” he said.
Dylan, a native of Duluth, Minn., began 
his musical career as a folk singer, modeling his persona after Woody Guthrie and penning topical songs that were eventually popularized by Peter, Paul and Mary, The Byrds and Joan Baez.
At the 1965 Newport Folk Festival, in New -
port, R.I., Dylan famously brought an electric 
band to back him, simultaneously alienating 
his folk-purist fan base and revolutionizing the worth of songwriting in rock ‘n’ roll.
Since then, his legend has loomed larger 
than almost any other story in rock. Dylan has toured incessantly and released eight studio albums since the early 1990s.
The fall tours coincide with the release of a 
two-disc set of demos done for music publish-
ers in the early 1960s, “The Witmark Demos,” 
and “Bob Dylan – The Original Mono Record-ings,” a box set of his first eight albums in their original mono sound.
Dylan and his band will perform at the Ste -
phen C. O’Connell Center at 8 p.m. Doors open at 7 p.m.Welcoming a Legend“A lot of 
people 
can’t stand 
touring, but to me

I’m driven to do it.”

Loca
America’s favorite Colombian shows 
off her abundant assets in her music 
video for “Loca,” a song with fun, ﬂ  irty lyrics, 
replete with high horn riffs and drums. Set against 
a beautiful Barcelonian landscape, in the video the 
tanned pop star teases in her low, pinched and sultry 
voice: “I’m crazy but you like it ( loca, loca, loca).” And on a beach, she does what she does best — shake her hips while her long blond locks blow in the wind. Es muy caliente, Shakira.It’s Kind of a Funny Story
A lighter version of “One Flew Over 
the Cuckoo’s Nest,” this dramedy puts 
a positive spin on the place where most of us 
wish celebs like Lindsay Lohan would go and get help. In “It’s Kind of a Funny Story,” which hits theaters Fri-
day, 16-year-old Craig (Keir Gilchrist, “United States 
of Tara”) checks himself into a mental health clinic to de-stress and rejuvenate after being overwhelmed by teenage pressures and contemplating suicide. But in this wannabe “Juno”-style story, in as unlikely a place as a mental ward, he ﬁ  nds that companionship and laughter are the perfect antidotes. Also starring: Zach Galiﬁ  anakis  (“The Hangover”) and Emma Roberts (“Valentine’s Day”).

  Dear Jared,
Recently, one of my roommates 
has been seeing someone who, quite frankly, scares the shit out of my other roommate and me. He comes in at odd 
hours, has the creepy slasher-movie vo-
cals and a Columbine stare. I’m contact-ing you because they have sex so loud the walls shake like we’re in a war zone. The moans that come from that end of the hall can only be described as the kind Charles Manson must have had during his orgies. I’d talk to her about it directly, but she tells him everything.
What do I do if my roommate has a 
psycho friend with beneﬁ  ts? 
Sincerely, Not Wanting to be the Chick from 
“Psycho”
Columbine glare aside, it sounds like your roommate is having a bang-up good time. Walls shak-
ing? War zone-style foxholes? All that’s missing is a couple of Geneva Conven-
tion violations, and we’ve got ourselves 
a party. 
I’m sensing, though, your reasons for writing a letter might not be out of jealousy of their Operation Panty Freedom that you’re miss-ing out on but 
rather genuine 
concern this Hitchcock creep with a ﬂ  air for 
wall-shattering screams might unleash some serious Sharon Tate action on your ass. 
And having that awkward head-
board-rocking, squealing in ecstasy, ass-
smacking mantra night after night when 
you’re just trying to study pre-calc in the living room can be a tad irritating. 
This might be something your room-
mate and you have to combine forces and risk Manson-esque stab wounds to confront your roommate. No one likes the awkward ass smacks anyway.

Like he did in 1976 and then again in 1988, 
English professor emeritus Andrew Gordon will 
watch Bob Dylan take the stage on UF territory on Friday. But years before he witnessed Dylan rock The Gator Nation, he had a not-so-polite run-in with the folk legend in the Big Apple.
“It was an evening in the fall of 1964. I was 
on MacDougal Street in Greenwich Village in 
Manhattan, and I stepped into a bar next to a 
folk music club called the Kettle of Fish, strictly to use the men’s room. I was 19.
“... Inside it was dark, smokey, noisy and very 
crowded. I navigated through the joint to the rear, where there was a long table filled with peo -
ple. Standing against the wall next to the table were two guys. One burly, bearded man leaning against the wall was the folk singer Dave Van 
Ronk. The other I didn’t recognize: a short, pale, skinny, hawk-nosed young guy in a plaid outfit ... He was very drunk ... [and] blocking the corridor 
to the restrooms.
“‘Excuse me,’ I said. ‘I’m trying to get through 
here.’ At the interruption, he turned sharply from Van Ronk and started to curse me, roundly and very loudly. I edged past him.
“... As I was standing at the urinal, I had an 
epiphany: That was Bob Dylan.
“I pondered what to say on the way out: ‘Hey, 
I love your music?’ Or: ‘I’m sorry, but you were very rude to me just now when I was trying to get to the men’s room?’ As I stepped out into the corridor, I caught a glimpse of the crowd. Every -
one in the bar was busy with a drink and talking to one another, their backs to Dylan. They were playing it cool, doing the New York thing: studi -
ously ignoring the fact there was a celebrity in the room.
“So I, too, did the New York thing. I walked out 
of the bar, and I said nothing.”thursday, october 7, 2010   � ALLIGATOR, 11 10, ALLIGATOR � thursday, october 7, 2010

Musicians spanning across time — everyone 
from rockers like the Rolling Stones to more cur -
rent folk artists like Ray LaMontagne — have cited 
influences by Bob Dylan. Here, some of Gaines-ville’s freshest talents sound off about the song-writing giant and his contribution to music.
“My dad has always been a huge Bob Dylan 
fan. There’s a line in ‘Positively 4th Street’ that my dad really likes and pointed out to me: ‘I wish 
that for just one day you could stand inside my 
shoes. You’d know what a drag it is to see you.’ ... I love that Dylan was the first person to be really blunt, yet poetic, in his lyrics. That’s what I try to do now in my music. Our music is quite different, but he’s influenced my writing style.”
— Janna Pelle (vocals/keys) of Janna Pelle & 
the Half Steps
“I can honestly say – and I’m not going to try 
and be the punk musician that tells you I’m com-pletely enthralled with his music — but, I respect the guy ... I think he’s one of the coolest, most straight-forward dudes in spite of his success.”
— Nick Sessions (bass/vocals) of Assassi-
nate the Scientist
“Definitely just listening to Bob Dylan really 
helped me transition into being more open-mind-ed about music and to blues influences as well. He’s changed the way I feel about performing — the way I put my soul into it — because of his soul and his attitude.” 
— Amy Lobasso (guitar/vocals) of The Bo -
swellians
“The big lesson that can be taken from Dy -
lan’s work is that a song doesn’t have to be com-plicated or recorded perfectly to hit a chord with the audience.”

So much has been made of Bob Dylan’s songwriting: When he put hand to typewriter (as he 
liked to often do), his lyrics came out indelible, engrossing and timeless. Here’s the Avenue’s picks 
for the killer lines that send Dylanologists into convulsions.Everything you need to know before the Bob Dylan show 
“How many roads must a man walk down/ 
Before you call him a man?”
— From “Blowin’ in the Wind”
“I muttered something underneath my breath/ She studied the lines in my face/ I must admit I felt a little uneasy/ When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe/ Tangled up in blue”
— From “Tangled Up in Blue”
“God said to Abraham, ‘Kill me a son’/ Abe says, ‘Man, you must be puttin’ me on’/ God say, ‘No,’ Abe say, ‘What?’/ God say, ‘You can do what you want Abe but/ The next time you see me comin’ you better run.’”
— From “Highway 61 Revisited”
“‘Equality,’ I spoke the word/ As if a wedding vow/ Ah, but I was so much older then/ I’m younger than that now”
— From “My Back Pages”
“I see my light come shining/ From the west unto to the east/ Any day now, any day now/ I shall be released”
— From “I Shall be Released”Bob Dylan’s words of wisdom

Any Dylan set list is sure to please and dis-
appoint all over. Do you prefer “Blowin’ in the 
Wind” or “The Times They Are a-Changin’”? “Like a Rolling Stone” has to be in there, right? And what about some deep cuts, like “If You See Her, Say Hello” or “Isis”?
Everyone has their favorites, but here’s our 
picks for the songs we hope to hear Friday.
“Tonight I’ll Be Staying Here With You”Kick it off like you do on the fifth “Bootleg 
Series” record, Bob. It may not be like it was on the Rolling Thunder Revue, but the crowd would love for you to stay here.
“Maggie’s Farm”It’s the song he electrified for the first time 
in 1965 at Newport. Only this time, no one will be booing or threatening to ax the micro -
phone cable.“The Times They Are a-Changin’”
A classic that young and old will know. 
“I Want You”The best love song he ever wrote.“Tangled Up in Blue”His winding treatise on divorce — and 
some of the best phrases ever turned on wax.
“Things Have Changed”His Academy Award-winning tune from the 
soundtrack of the 2000 Michael Douglas ve -
hicle, “Wonder Boys.” 
“Mr. Tambourine Man”There’s a reason Hunter S. Thompson 
wanted this song played as a cannon blasted his ashes into the oblivion.
“Like a Rolling Stone”This song shattered pop radio’s 3-minute 
barrier, introduced snarky beat poet witti-
cisms to the electric guitar and changed rock 
music forever.Local bands: under the influencePlay this: Avenue dream set list I was cursed out by Bob Dylan

Happy birthday, Harn: 20 years of art and innovation
By MEG WAGNER
avenue contributing writer
Kerry Oliver-Smith remembers 
her first day at the Samuel P. Harn 
Museum of Art, 20 years ago.
She remembers being “in awe 
of the stunning architecture” of 
the building. She remembers Bud Bishop, the museum’s director 
at the time, and his “mile-high 
standards.” She remembers just how tidy the museum was: floors sparkled, art hung at just the right 
height and not a single particle of 
dust could be found in the build-ing.
“It was all so clean and perfect 
and professional,” Oliver-Smith 
said.
Now the museum’s curator of 
contemporary art, Oliver-Smith be -gan working at the Harn in 1990, shortly before its grand opening, as 
the curator of education.
As the Harn celebrates its 20th 
birthday this year, she says the mu -
seum remains just as put-together as it was in its infancy.
“Every day, I’m still blown away 
by the quality of our museum,” she said.
The Harn Museum opened on 
Sept. 22, 1990. The first exhibits displayed included art of Papua New Guinea, Pre-Columbian art 
from Peru, and Columbia and Flori-
da paintings by Herman Herzog. 
Just about everything about the 
museum has grown. 
When it opened, the building 
consisted of 64,470 square feet of space. 
Now, thanks to several addi-tions, the museum spans more 
than 82,470 square feet.
In 1990, the museum’s perma-
nent collection consisted of 3,000 
paintings, sculptures and other 
items. 
Today, the museum boasts 
7,300 works of art. The staff has 
doubled in size, growing from 25 
to 50 members over the past 20 
years. 
“We’ve certainly expanded over 
the years in the most tremendous ways,” said Tami Wroath, the mu -
seum’s director of marketing and public relations.
She said that through the years, 
the Harn has tried to broaden its 
audience to be as inclusive as pos-
sible. Hosting artwork from around the world, ranging from Southeast Asian to contemporary American works, the Harn’s collection is truly 
broad, Wroath said.
“Sometimes, museums can be 
perceived as stuffy and elitist, but 
there really is something for every -
one here,” she said. 
In celebration of its 20th birth-
day, the Harn is hosting a weekend worth of events. 
Friday evening, patrons are in-
vited to “20 Candles: Come As You Art!” a birthday party for the Harn. Ticket packages are available 
at tiered levels starting at $20, but 
everyone attending will be treated 
to cocktails, cupcakes and live mu -
sic.
All proceeds will help support 
the museum and its exhibitions.
On Sunday, the Harn will contin-
ue its celebration with an afternoon full of family-friendly activities. 
From 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., visitors 
can design birthday hats, decorate cupcakes and race through the mu-seum during a scavenger hunt.
Admission is free and open to 
the public.

against Penn State on Sept. 10, and she has recorded the 
eighth-most digs in the SEC with 163. However, her stats ap-pears to have more to do with the fact that the No. 2 Gators 
rank second to last as a team in digs.
“It’s a great story — she came here as a walk-on with very 
limited playing time and here she is start-
ing for a top-10 team,” Wise said.
Even though Fleming was a walk-on, 
her play suggested otherwise, according to Lauren Bledsoe.
“Even when she was a walk-on — peo-
ple kind of down that sometimes — she did 
really well,” Bledsoe said. “She should have been on a schol-arship and we all knew that.”
Fleming is still trying to fine-tune her game, specifically 
her eye sequencing, communication skills and serving. 
“I’m still learning,” Fleming said, “so that in December 
I’ll be ready in my position to help and contribute to the team as much as I can.”Fleming ranks eighth 
in the SEC in digs

After a solid showing Tuesday , Florida’s duo of Sekou 
Bangoura Jr. and Billy Federhofer lost in the final round 
of doubles qualifying at the ITA All-American in Tulsa, Okla.
The sophomores picked up two wins while playing 
together for the first time, but lost their match against 
California’s Nick Andrews and Jonathan Dahan (8-6) on 
Wednesday . 
Despite the loss, coach Andy Jackson was encouraged 
by their performances.
“They were very impressive for their first time togeth-
er,” Jackson said. “They haven’t even practiced together as a team.”
While Jackson described Bangoura as “one of the best 
doubles players in college,” he said Federhofer held his 
own despite his inexperience. 
“It opened my eyes to the level that Billy can play in 
doubles,” Jackson said. 
The pair still needs work, though Jackson said they got 
down early and played well to get back even, but the duo played too conservative at the end of the match. 
The last leg of the tournament begins Thursday, as se-
nior Alexandre Lacroix will compete in the singles main draw and team with junior Nassim Slilam in doubles. 
Jackson said the No. 9 Lacroix has a realistic shot at 
winning the singles championship.
However, he said playing in the main draw is tough 
because players have to win twice Thursday to move on 
to the next round. 
“It will be a shocking start to the tournament,” Jack-
son said. “Seventy-five percent of the guys will be out by 
[Thursday] night.” 
Lacroix also has to deal with the demand of playing in 
doubles, something that requires good conditioning and focus. 
Jackson thinks it would be a long 
shot for Lacroix to win both the singles and doubles championships, but it 
wouldn’t be the first time one of Jack-
son’s players has won both. 
While coaching at Mississippi State 
in 1992-1993, one of Jackson’s players, Daniel Courcol, was the singles cham-
pion in the ITA National Clay Court 
and All-American Hardcourt Champi-
onships, and the doubles champion in the All-American Championships and ITA National Indoor.
Lacroix hasn’t dominated college tennis to that degree, 
but he can still develop his doubles game and put on a good showing, Jackson said. 
“It’s not like he’s the Gators football team of last year 
where anything but undefeated is unacceptable,” he 
said.Pair of Gators fall in qualifying

TEEING OFF WITH MIKE McCALL HE IS NINTH ON THE TEAM 
WITH 13 TACKLES.

Several Gators said in the pre-
season they expected free safety 
Will Hill to have a breakout year after “rededicating himself” to the 
team this summer.
But so far this season, coach Ur -
ban Meyer and defensive coordina-
tor Teryl Austin do not think the junior is meeting his potential.
Hill, who missed Florida’s 
first two games when he “wasn’t ready to play,” surrendered a long touchdown pass in his season de-
but against Tennessee and missed 
multiple tackles last week against Alabama.
In three games, Hill has recorded 
13 tackles (ninth on the team), has broken up one pass and has forced one fumble. 
“He has the ability, really, to 
be an impact-type player,” Austin 
said. “He’s big, he has range, he 
can tackle. He can do all the things you want a safety to do, really all the great safeties around here have done. He hasn’t taken that step. We need him to take it.”
Meyer and Austin said Hill 
flashed potential during training camp to suggest he would be one 
of the team’s top defensive players. 
But since the season started, both coaches have noticed a regression in the safety’s play.
“I’d say, for his ability level, he’s 
been average,” Meyer said Mon-day.
Austin took Hill aside for a pri-
vate talk recently, and he expects Hill to improve. Austin said the safety is playing well in practices, something that hasn’t translated to actual games, perhaps because he is more focused on not making mis-takes than actually making plays.
“Sometimes as a player you start 
pushing and pressing, wanting to make things perfect and make things right all the time,” Austin said. “That’s really not going to happen in this game.”
Preparing for two QBs: The 
Gators’ defense has essentially game planned for two offenses this week while getting ready for Satur -
day’s meeting with LSU.
While Jordan Jefferson has start-
ed every game this season for the No. 12 Tigers, backup Jarrett Lee has appeared in all but one con-test. Jefferson poses a threat as a 
runner (189 rushing yards) but has 
struggled through the air, tossing six interceptions against two touch-downs.
 Lee, meanwhile, is a traditional 
pocket passer, throwing for 206 yards on 25 attempts.
Austin compared the duo to 
Florida’s own quarterbacks.
“It’d be like preparing for our 
guy — maybe John (Brantley) and then Trey (Burton) coming in the game,” Austin said. “You have a couple different things you have to be ready for, and so we’ve been working on both things this week.” 
Injury update: Meyer said run-
ning back Jeff Demps (sprained 
foot) will probably play this week 
despite practicing at full speed Tuesday. There was no update about how the junior fared Wednes-day.
Running back Mike Gillislee 
(bone bruise) has practiced at full speed this week, Meyer said. Gil-lislee was seen leaning on crutches 
in the second half against Ala-
bama.
Meyer added that the team’s 
starting offensive line is intact this week, and that Brantley (ribs) has practiced this week despite feeling sore.
And while he is happy with 
punter Chas Henry’s performance 
during field goals, Meyer said kick-
er Caleb Sturgis (back) need not worry about losing his job. Henry was 2 for 2 on his first career field goal attempts against Alabama.

Football players aren’t the only athletes 
who have to worry about getting knocked out 
of a game due to a concussion.
Believe it or not, volleyball players get their 
fair share of head injuries as well.
Take, for example, Florida senior libero 
Erin Fleming during the match against LSU 
on Friday.
“I ended up diving for a ball and the speed 
took me over the top of my head,” Fleming said. “I hit it pretty good.”Fleming played the rest of the match, re-
cording a match-high 20 digs.
According to coach Mary Wise, Fleming 
appeared to have sustained a mild concus-sion.
“They kept checking me during timeouts 
and making sure I could hear, could see ev-erything, that my smells were alright, that I wasn’t feeling nauseous,” Fleming said. “Af-ter the game I took a couple tests and I was 
really on that gray line.”
Fleming sat out the next day’s practice and 
took more tests in hopes of playing against Ar -
kansas on Sunday. Unfortunately for Fleming and the Gators, she didn’t meet the expecta-tions team doctors and trainers hoped for.
After sitting out her only match of the sea-
son, Fleming was cleared to 
practice Tuesday . And the 
senior is eager to start the 
second half of the season.
“It’s exciting and kind of 
sad also that we’re halfway 
through,” Fleming said. 
“We’re playing great as a 
team and I’ve accepted my 
role and trying to do it the best I can.”
Coming into the season, Fleming was giv-en the responsibility of replacing former UF 
libero Elyse Cusack. 
Cusack ended her career as the Southeast-
ern Conference’s all-time digs leader with 
2,138 — not an easy player to replace by some-
one who had never played the position.
“Not only is it her first year playing in the 
libero jersey but it’s the first time she’s ever 
played in that left-back position,” Wise said. “Previously she played right side early on in 
her career. It’s a whole new position for her.”
Fleming recorded a career-high 21 digs Fleming excelling as Cusack’s libero replacement

LSU’s Patrick Peterson has returned two punts for touchdowns this season 
and is averaging 16.6 yards per punt return.

Special teams can often be 
overlooked, even if a team is 
struggling in that facet of the game.
Florida’s recent turnovers and 
red-zone struggles have received most of the attention this week as fans recover from the team’s loss to Alabama. But coach Urban Meyer said he is more concerned with his team’s punt coverage.
With the Crimson Tide already 
ahead 10-0 early in the second quarter Saturday, senior Chas Henry booted a punt inside the Alabama 20-yard line. But Tide re-ceiver Julio Jones fielded the punt, ran past redshirt freshman Chris Guido and streaked down the left sideline until Henry pushed him out of bounds inside Florida ter -
ritory.
The 41-yard return set the 
Alabama offense up with a short field and, eight plays later, Florida trailed 17-0.
“That was disappointing,” 
Meyer said. “There was a lot of disappointments in that game — 
that might have been No. 1.”
The coach said fans can expect 
to see new players on the punt 
team if porous coverage contin-ues in practice. The unit does not have time to recover, however.
Florida faces the best punt re-
turner in the Southeastern Con-ference on Saturday in LSU’s Patrick Peterson, who leads the SEC and ranks fourth in the na-tion with an average punt return of 16.6 yards.
Peterson has also brought two 
punts back for touchdowns.
“That’s absolutely the No. 1 
concern of our football team right now,” Meyer said of containing Peterson.
Since Meyer took over in 2005, 
Florida’s punt coverage has been among the best in the nation, al-lowing just north of four yards per return in 61 chances. But, in four returns this season, oppo-nents are averaging 16.25 yards.
In fact, Jones’ return was the 
longest against the Florida punt team since Meyer became coach, yielding almost twice as many yards as the unit allowed all of last season (21 yards on five re-turns).
The second-longest return 
since 2005? Twenty-one yards by 
Kentucky’s Randall Cobb two 
weeks ago.
But with freshmen filling out 
46 percent of the Gators’ roster, special teams struggles should not be surprising. Meyer said ear -
lier this season that a lack of focus in that area is a sign of an inexpe-rienced team.
On Jones’ return, he said the 
Gators did not “net” the ball, or take proper lanes to converge at the same spot (wherever Jones happened to be running) to limit the receiver’s space to make cuts.
Until this season, Meyer has 
been the team’s unofficial special teams coach. But, in light of the health issues that nearly drove him to retirement last December, Meyer relinquished that role to D.J. Durkin. 
Meyer decided to maintain 
control of one unit this year, though: punt team. 
And so it will be partially up to 
his group to prevent LSU’s offense from receiving a gift-wrapped scoring chance.
“We got to come out, we got 
to win field position,” linebacker 
Jon Bostic said. “That’s one thing 
coaches always stress. This week, we got to get special teams right 
to where we win the field-posi-
tion battle.”
Bostic knows as well as anyone 
how important containing Peter -
son is. The linebacker first saw Pe-
terson run at a track meet before 
college, when Bostic attended 
Wellington High and Peterson went to Pompano Ely High.
“I know the kid can run,” Bos-
tic said.
