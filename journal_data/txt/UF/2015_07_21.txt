Oswaldo Reina takes the bus to 
work at the Rawlings POD Market 
at least three times a week.
“I’d rather ride a bus than buy 
a decal,” the UF construction engi-neering graduate student said.
With the Regional Transit Sys-
tem buses serving about 30 passen-gers an hour last July, Reina isn’t the only one opting to take the bus.  
This could be because Gaines-
ville’s public transportation takes 
about 18 minutes less than the na-
tional average, according to a re-port by the Associated Press.
Commute times in Gainesville 
are lower overall than the rest of the country, according to the AP report. Of the major Florida cities included, Gainesville has the short-
est time in the state. 
Whereas Gainesville residents 
spend an average of 31 minutes 
on public transit, those in the Or-
lando area spend an average of 51 
minutes, and those in Tallahassee spend an average of 45 minutes.
In Gainesville, there’s a mix of 
transportation methods, which al-leviates congestion on roads, said UF urban and regional planning 
professor Ruth Steiner.“We have the right options,” 
she said.
Although the university doesn’t always have available on-campus 
parking, Steiner said it makes up for it with a partnership with RTS.
The university’s RTS partner-
ship affects all commuters, even those driving and carpooling, said Marlie Sanderson, the director of transportation planning for the North Central Florida Regional 
Planning Council.  
When people ride buses, it takes 
cars off of the road, he said. This 
impacts the community as a whole, lessening trafﬁ  c on overcrowded 
roads like 13th Street, West Univer-
sity Avenue, Southwest 34th Street and Archer Road.
Compared to 10 years ago, 
Sanderson said more students are choosing not to ride their bikes, opting instead to ride the bus.
“Those people have better op-
tions with better bus service,” 
Sanderson said, explaining that 
buses run more frequently and ex-tensively now than they did a de-cade ago.
To solve the trafﬁ  c problems 
that arise, Sanderson said the city could widen existing roads and expand the bus services, which would alleviate trafﬁ  c problems. 
The city does not have the funding 
to do that, though. Last fall, voters didn’t pass a transportation sales tax.
For Reina, it’s easy to take the 
bus to campus, and he said he likes having the option to drive or use RTS. In his hometown, Caracas, Gainesville has shortest commute time in state

Former UF football player J.C. Jackson 
has been formally charged with four ﬁ  rst-
degree felonies stemming from a reported 
armed robbery in April.
Jackson, 19, has been charged with 
three counts of home invasion robbery 
while armed with a ﬁ  rearm and one count 
of burglary, according to Alachua County 
Court documents ﬁ  led Monday.
Each charge carries a 10-year minimum 
sentence, if convicted.
On April 18, Jackson reportedly led two 
men into an apartment at Canopy Apart-ments and robbed everyone inside, accord-ing to a Gainesville Police Department re-port. The men, one of whom was armed with 
a handgun, reportedly stole two gaming systems, marijuana and $382 in cash. 
The report stated one 
suspect pressed a gun to the face of one of the vic-tims while demanding to know where he kept his marijuana and money.
Victims told police 
that Jackson left the 
apartment to take a 
phone call while the two men committed 
the robbery, according to the report. Jack-
son was arrested, booked into jail and held on a $150,000 bond. 
At the time of his arrest, UF football 
coach Jim McElwain said the program was 
aware of the felony charges against Jack-
son. Ex-UF football player charged

The co-founder of Grooveshark Music 
was found dead Sunday evening.
Shortly after 9 p.m., the girlfriend of 
Josh Greenberg found the 28-year-old dead in bed at his home, located at 2005 NW 27th St., Gainesville Police Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias wrote in an email.
What was originally a medical call 
turned into a death investigation, Tobias said. 
However, neither the investigators nor 
the medical examiner — who performed an autopsy on Monday — suspect any foul play.
Tobias said it appeared as though 
Greenberg died a few hours before he was found.
The investigation is ongoing as police 
wait for the toxicology reports.
In November 2013, Eddy Vasquez, the 
director of international sales at Groove-shark, was shot twice in the stomach and killed in St. Petersburg, according to a po-
lice report. The shooter, Andres Rodriguez 
Torres, was charged with second degree murder.
Grooveshark faced a slew of lawsuits 
in recent years and ultimately shut down 
earlier this year. Multiple record compa-
nies sued the company for copyright vio-lations.  Co-founder of Grooveshark

If you met Albert the Alligator 45 years 
ago, you probably wouldn’t want to give 
him a hug or a high ﬁ  ve.
That’s because up until 1970, UF had 
live mascots, real alligators with razor 
sharp teeth and claws that were kept in a 
pen at the base of Century Tower, said UF 
spokesman Steve Orlando. 
The university would never be able to 
get away with that now, Orlando said.  
All that remains of UF’s live mascots is a 
skull, which can now be seen at the Florida Museum of Natural History’s new perma-nent exhibit, “Exploring Our World.”
“I didn’t know that UF actually used to 
have live mascots,” said Alex Craig, a nurse at North Florida Regional Medical Center, as he glanced at a picture of three women holding Albert on a leash. “He looked kind of fat, so obviously they were overfeeding 
him.” 
Albert’s skull, however, is just one of the 
many objects on display at the exhibit. In-
side the discovery drawers, which are locat-
ed on the right when you enter, visitors can ﬁ  nd the jaw of a sandbar shark, the carcass 
of an armadillo and the skull of a Florida panther, among other items.
“Exploring Our World” showcases dif-
ferent research initiatives led by UF and the Florida Museum of Natural History. It displays some of the museum’s earliest and latest collections as well as research videos 
produced by UF students. The exhibit also 
highlights the role these discoveries play in deepening our understanding of the world.
Since it is a permanent exhibit, the con-
tent will be updated monthly to quarterly, said Dale Johnson, the museum’s project manager. 
“We do try to feature stories that are in-
teresting to our visitors, but also provide a 
wide breadth of topics to represent the wide 
breadth of research at UF,” Johnson said.
The current exhibit is an expansion of an 
old exhibit called “The Library of Life.” It 
will continue to grow with the addition of 
a new, 2,000-square-foot discovery zone for children 8 years old and younger and their families. The discovery room is expected to open at the end of next year, Johnson said.
“This exhibit just allows us to show off 
as well, because a lot of people don’t know that we’re one of the top ﬁ  ve museums in the country,” said Kaitlin Gardiner, the mar-keting and public relations coordinator at the museum.The museum is open Monday to Satur-
day from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday from 1 to 5 p.m. Admission to the exhibit is free for all visitors.

Bill Cosby’s lurid, decade-old 
testimony about his philander-
ing could do more than damage what’s left of his fatherly image.
 It could very well be used 
against him in court by some of the women who accuse him of sexual assault.
Rocco Cipparone, a defense lawyer in New Jersey who is not connected to any of the legal ac-tion surrounding Cosby, said Monday that what the comedian said under oath could wind up hurting him in civil or criminal 
cases. 
This can be used against him 
if judges can be persuaded to rule 
the testimony admissible.
For Cosby to avoid being dam-aged by his own words, Cipparone said, “you’d have to navigate a virtual mineﬁ  eld.”
Dozens of women have come 
forward and accused Cosby of drugging and then sexually as-
saulting them in the last four de-
cades. 
However, few of the accusa-
tions have begun to play out in court. This is largely because the statute of limitations for criminal charges has run out in most in-stances.
Authorities have said one ac-
cusation is under criminal inves-tigation in California, and three 
others are part of a defamation 
lawsuit against Cosby in Massa-chusetts by women who say they were slandered by his representa-tives.Cosby has denied committing 
any crimes.
Earlier this month, a judge 
sided with The Associated Press and released small excerpts from a deposition Cosby gave in Phil-
adelphia in 2005-06 as part of a 
sexual-assault lawsuit against him that was later settled on con-ﬁ  dential terms.
Lawyers may try to use Cosby’s own words against himVenezuela, Reina said public tran-
sit is always overcrowded.
“It’s nice to have that opportu-
nity to come to work in different ways,” he said.
Natalia Neira also said she used the bus to get to class, but the property management company she worked for needed her to trav-
el all over the city, requiring her to 
drive.
Still, the UF urban and regional 
planning graduate student said she 
rarely had problems with RTS, and 
she liked how quick it was.“It took me longer to get to the 
(bus) stop than to actually get to campus,” the 25-year-old said.
Gainesville’s traffic is incompa-
rable to other cities, like her home-town, Miami, Neira said.
“Gainesville traffic is a cakewalk 
compared to Miami,” she said.By Elise Engle

UF students will get a change of scenery 
for their all-nighters this upcoming academ-ic year.
According to the George A. Smathers 
Libraries website, Marston Science Library and Library West will be switching hours in the Fall, with Marston taking on the 24/5 
hours Library West once had. 
Due to a contract agreement between 
Starbucks and the libraries, the coffee shop 
will be open during library hours, said Pat-rick Reakes, associate dean for scholarly re-
sources and services at George A. Smathers 
libraries.
Sara Wedemeyer, a 20-year-old replace-
ment senator representing the College of 
Liberal Arts and Sciences, said she sees an 
issue in the lack of student representation 
in the decision to switch the library hours.
She said although senators were in-
formed of the potential switch and asked for their opinions, she felt that library officials had already made up their minds.
“I think the smaller issues here are actu-
ally the big deal,” she said. “Why the ur-gency? Why over Summer?”
Nicholas Carré, UF Student Body treasur-
er, said he became involved in the discus-sion when he first reached out to the librar-ies at the beginning of his term in Spring. 
They responded with the idea of a switch.
“I was thrown off, because I wasn’t nec-
essarily reaching out to them to talk to them about any switches but the budget,” Carré 
said. “No one really knew about it.”
Carré said the issue is time-sensitive, and 
the switch can’t be made once the Fall se-mester starts because it would cause confu-sion among students and staff.
Although Student Government is not 
making the decision, Carré said he wants to make sure they are reaching out to students and getting their input.
He said results were almost split on a 
survey he sent to senators, which yielded about 20 responses.
Carré said SG funds the overnight hours, 
but the libraries could choose to no longer provide the services, so he said he respects their decision-making.
He said there are benefits to the switch, 
and Marston will have about 2,200 seats fol-
lowing renovations, while Library West has 
about 1,400.
Newell Hall will also be opening in the 
2016-2017 academic year near Marston, 
providing more study space and a safer area 
for night activity, he said.
Reakes said a log-on survey ran on li-
brary computers asking if students would prefer Marston or Library West.
He said about 5,000 students participat-
ed, and the results were not drastically in favor of one library over the other.
He said there will be more advertisement 
closer to Fall to make sure all students are informed of the switch.
“If we get to the end of this school year, 
and we get to next Summer, and the feed-back is, ‘Oh, we would still much rather 
have West,’ I’ll just switch everything back 
over,” Reakes said.4   ALLIGATOR    TUESDAY, JULY 21, 2015

WASHINGTON — Sen. John 
McCain said Monday that Repub-
lican presidential candidate Don-
ald Trump doesn’t need to apolo-
gize to him for remarks about his captivity in 
Vietnam,  
but should tell veterans he’s sorry.
Appear-
ing in a nationally broadcast 
interview, 
the Arizo-na Republican said, “When Mr. Trump says he prefers to be with 
people who are not captured, the 
great honor of my life was to be in the company of heroes.”
“I am not a hero ... I’m in the 
arena,” McCain said Monday on MSNBC, suggesting he’s fair game 
for criticism as an elected official.
In an opinion piece published 
Monday in USA Today, Trump 
said McCain has abandoned the 
nation’s veterans and made Amer-
ica “less safe” through his votes in Congress.The real estate executive also 
lashed out at fellow GOP presiden-tial aspirants who have criticized his remarks, calling them “failed 
politicians.” 
Trump said he did not need “to 
be lectured by any of them.”
The op-
ed comes as Trump is 
on the de-
fensive for dismissing 
McCain’s 
reputa-tion as a war hero because  
McCain was captured in Vietnam and, “I like people who weren’t captured.”
On a contentious appearance 
on the NBC’s “Today” show Mon-day, Trump took issue with the media’s reporting on his com-ments about McCain’s war record, made at a conservative forum in 
Iowa. 
Trump insisted in a telephone 
interview with anchor Matt Lauer 
that he had said “four times” that 
he respected those captured in 
war.McCain: Trump owes

If you’ve ever wondered if there would be 
an application like Tinder but for shopping, 
look no further. 
Created by a three-person team, benjamin 
is an application that will launch its ﬁ  nal ver-
sion during the ﬁ  rst week of August. The beta 
version, which is currently available in the app store, will continue to be free for all users. 
The app, using algorithms and connect-
ing to a social media site, uses a person’s ex-pressed interests online to narrow down the items shown, which are available for purchase. 
After linking your Facebook or Twitter ac-
count, checking off your interests and ﬁ  lling in 
your shoe and clothing sizes, you have a full 
minute to decide if you want to buy the item presented.
If you do, swipe right. If you don’t, swipe 
left to move on to the next item hoping to match with you.
“It’s personalized shopping meets Tinder,” 
said Corrine LaDrig, head of marketing for ben-jamin.
The app’s name, which is lowercased for branding, stems from references to the $100 bill, as well as the Big Ben tower, said LaDrig, 
a UF graduate with a bachelor’s in public rela-
tions and a master’s degree in global strategic communications.
The app will also keep all items under $100, 
LaDrig said, adding that the 60-second time limit lets customers shop on the go.
With benjamin, customers can shop for a 
few minutes while they head to work or have a gap of time, she said.
Andrew Chapin, founder and CEO of benja-
min, said the app is a solution to the problem of too many options on other shopping web-sites.
With the basic demographic information 
that benjamin collects, customers can have a personalized shopping experience, he said.
The app, which launched June 15, has part-
nered with brands like Ray-Ban, whose prod-
ucts are available in the beta version. Other 
possible partnerships include Adidas, Under Armour and Nike, he said.  
The app currently has several hundred 
active weekly users, meeting its initial goal, Chapin said.
The company charges vendors based on 
how many times their products show up on a user’s phone, not how many are sold, Chapin said. This way, vendors can lower prices for 
customers without having to give away a per-
centage of commission.
Renée Richter, a 19-year-old UF psychology 
sophomore, said she shops online way too of-ten, averaging about once a week.
From books to makeup to accessories, Rich-
ter said she usually shops on Amazon.com, which offers deals under $10.
“I don’t think I’d ever use (benjamin) be-
cause I’d buy too much,” she said. Richter said it’d be cool to see the app ﬁ  lter products by prices and brand.
Steven Kirn, executive director of the David 
F. Miller Center for Retailing Education and Re-search at UF, said convenience plays a big role in e-commerce.
The app is proof that retail is evolving, Kirn 
said.
The majority of customers still prefer to 
go to a physical store for most products, but the app could take online shopping to another level with the personalized experience, he said.
“Customers are expecting the ability to buy 
things anywhere, anytime they want,” he said. “The winners are going to be the ones that meet that demand in any way they expect.”Tinder for shopping? There’s an app for that

The sad state of the Democratic primary race
In the Democratic primary race, as of to-
day, there’s Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sand-ers and everyone else. While the coverage 
of Sanders’ campaign is exciting, what he 
doesn’t have is the idolization that a lot 
of people have for Clinton. Her supporters are willing to look past her flaws and assume good 
intentions. No amount of argument will con-
vince them there’s a possibility the emails that we should be most concerned about were not released to the State Department. 
It’s possible that what was ultimately Clinton’s 
downfall in 2008 could come back to haunt her again. She is just very detached. Roping off journalists and complaints of being “dead broke” after leaving the White House only makes this worse. She has to try to 
be likeable, carefully constructing her appearance. But 
this also works against her, making her seem fake and untrustworthy. 
For Sanders, it’s easy to appear likeable, but he’s un-
likely to win the nomination. 
He’s able to come off completely unrehearsed and 
talk to reporters, while Clinton must have taped inter-views and controlled encounters with reporters. 
The primaries are supposed to bring out better poli-
cies through competition, but Hillary isn’t really en-gaging with the other candidates because she is so far above their level in the polls. 
It might be good for her to at least pretend the other 
candidates are equals, especially for the debates. 
What fun is it to watch a debate where we all know 
who the winner is? 
On the Republican side, there are far too many can-
didates, but they are at least forced to talk to and about 
each other, fighting for coverage in the press. 
Clinton knows that whatever she does will be cov-ered by the press. 
In some ways, she is just as complacent 
as she was in 2008, which is dangerous for a general election. This election cycle’s Demo-
cratic debates are shaping up to be another one of Clinton’s speeches. 
The other candidates, besides Sanders, will 
not be very confrontational toward Clinton. 
Knowing that she will win the nomination, 
they are vying for vice president. 
Clinton’s election seeming inevitable could lead to 
lower turnout for her at the polls, allowing Sanders’ 
more passionate supporters to turn the tides in his fa-
vor, but Sanders will be unable to win the people in the middle that are so desperately needed to win a general election. 
The sad state of this primary race will doom the 
Democratic Party and be terrible for the general elec-tion because usually a primary would help shape up the 
candidate to face off against opposition. 
Primaries take candidates out of their comfort zone 
so that they are prepared in the general election. Clin-
ton, meanwhile, is too comfortable. 
Just as she was in 2008. 
Nicole Dan is a UF political science sophomore. Her 
column appears on Tuesdays.People must be 
willing to limit their 
own gun rights
Guns are a pretty hot topic. They shoot things. They 
often harm things. And they have a distressing habit of occasionally bringing harm to those we’d 
prefer stay safe.
Most recently, there was the shooting in Chatta-
nooga, Tennessee, that left five soldiers dead and has many 
state governors signing executive orders arming National 
Guard units and reevaluating security at military recruit-
ment centers. 
People who support arming service members have ar-
gued, understandably, that our soldiers should not be vul-nerable to attacks while on American soil.  
Conversely, the thought of armed security and soldiers 
walking around your local mall recruitment office doesn’t exactly sound like a welcoming atmosphere in a public quarter.
Frankly, improving security across the board on our do-
mestic shores has been a recurring discussion happening on a nearly annual basis with every passing shooting. 
It’s unfortunate, but despite years of discussion on the 
matter spurred by unstable individuals shooting up schools 
and movie theaters, we’re still getting reports of innocent 
people getting gunned down as they go about their daily business. 
Only this time, the innocents in question might have had 
the opportunity to defend themselves if they were given a fighting chance.  
While beefing up security and increasing surveillance 
seems to be the standard operating procedures after a shoot-ing, so maybe it’s time to look at things from a different 
angle. 
Our constitution guarantees a right to keep and bear 
arms, and it’s a right that many have staunchly defended as 
necessary to the personal security of a U.S. citizen. It’s also 
a right that was firmly established before the invention of 
assault rifles like the AR-15 and AK-47. 
Once again, many proud Americans like their guns, and 
certainly feel safer with the knowledge that they’d have a chance to defend themselves against an aggressor. How-
ever, how many of us really need an automatic assault rifle 
to defend our homes?
With the headlines constantly flashing with tales of citi-
zens gunned down, and schools riddled with bullets, one 
can’t help but wonder if the ability to freely purchase mili-
tary hardware may be a bit under regulated in light of mod-ern armaments. 
Perhaps it’s time to consider an alternative security mea-
sure: Citizens deciding of their own accord to regulate the 
hardware on the market. 
Fewer big guns on the market could feasibly mean that 
everyone has a chance of getting out of situations intact, 
but it’s not exactly an easy thing to tell people to limit their 
own rights.

RESEARCH
By Brooke Perry
Alligator Contributing Writer
 
Years of research are beginning to 
pay off for Anastasia Albanese-O’Neill.
The UF assistant professor recently 
received the 2015 Innovative Use of Me-
dia Technology Award from the Ameri-
can Association of Diabetes Educators.
Albanese-O’Neill’s research led to 
the development of a prototype mobile diabetes educational program, which was developed during her doctoral stud-ies. 
The program is called “mDAD: Mo-
bile Diabetes Advice for Dads” and was 
developed to deliver diabetes education 
on mobile devices like smartphones and tablets to fathers of youth with Type 1 diabetes.
The $3,000 grant awarded to Alba-
nese-O’Neill will go to help beta test the use of a mobile app to see if users like it before testing it in a larger study.
“Fathers who participated in ear-
lier phases of the research told us that they were enthusiastic about receiving diabetes education via mobile technol-ogy,” she said. “We think that involving fathers early on in the design of mDAD will help ensure it will be accessible and easy for them to use.”
Albanese-O'Neill said she never con-
sidered a career in health care until her 
daughter, now 14, was diagnosed with 
Type 1 diabetes at 16 months old.
Those with Type 1 diabetes do not 
produce insulin, so they have to check their blood sugar multiple times each day, count carbohydrates, calculate in-
sulin doses, carry supplies and always 
be prepared for emergencies that can be potentially life threatening.
“(My daughter) inspired me to get a 
Ph.D. in nursing and become a pediatric nurse practitioner so I could contribute in a meaningful way to research that will ultimately lead to improved treat-ments and one day a cure for the dis-ease,” she said.
Dr. Desmond Schatz, medical direc-
tor of the UF Diabetes Institute, served 
as a mentor for Albanese-O’Neill on the 
project.
“She’s not only improving the life 
of her child, but those everywhere,” Schatz said. “She is one of the most out-standing professionals I’ve ever worked with. To give up a career to help not only the child in her life but all children with diabetes is beyond words.”
The goal for Albanese-O’Neill is to 
give not only fathers, but anyone who cares for a child with Type 1 diabetes information in a convenient way.
“The fact that this organization 
chose my project as a technological in-novation is encouraging, and indicates its potential to change the way we de-liver diabetes education to our patients 
and their caregivers,” she said.UF prof. receives $3,000

NATIONAL
By The Associated Press
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Cuban nation-
al ﬂ  ag ﬂ  uttered in the Washington sun Mon-
day as the U.S. and Cuba formally ended more than a half-century of estrangement, formally re-establishing relations severed at the height 
of the Cold War. But the symbolism of an em-
bassy ceremony could not conceal deep, lin-gering conﬂ  icts between the nations.
In the sweltering July heat and humidity 
of America’s capital, Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez presided over the ﬂ  ag-raising ceremony just hours after an agreement to re-store diplomatic ties broken in 1961 took effect at the stroke of midnight. He later met with Secretary of State John Kerry, becoming the ﬁ  rst Cuban foreign minister to set foot in the 
State Department since 1958.
Kerry announced that he would make a re-
ciprocal visit to Cuba to dedicate the U.S. Em-
bassy in Havana on Aug. 14. 
Despite pledges of goodwill and mutual re-
spect, ghosts of past animosity hung over the events.
At the reopening of the Cuban embassy and 
again at a joint news conference with Kerry, 
Rodriguez repeated demands for the U.S. to end its 53-year embargo, return the U.S. na-
val base at Guantanamo Bay, stop efforts to change or reform Cuba’s communist govern-ment and pay compensation for damage done 
to the island and its people over the past ﬁ  ve 
decades.
On a more conciliatory note, Rodriguez 
thanked President Barack Obama for his con-clusion that U.S. policy toward Cuba was faulty, his steps to ease sanctions thus far and his calls for Congress to repeal the embargo.
Rodriguez noted that there are “profound 
differences” between the U.S. and Cuban gov-
ernments but stressed that “we strongly be-lieve that we can both cooperate and coexist in a civilized way based on due respect for these 
differences.”
Kerry, speaking brieﬂ  y in Spanish, said 
America wants to work with Cuba to improve conditions there. But he also acknowledged persistent differences over human rights, de-mocracy and reparations and ﬂ  atly rejected the suggestion that Guantanamo would be re-turned to Cuba anytime soon.
“We celebrate this day — July 20 — as a 
time to start repairing what has been bro-ken and opening what for too long has been closed,” Kerry said.
Grievances persist despite start of new era in US-Cuba tiesGainesville Throwbacks
July 21, 1987: Student leaders dis-
satisﬁ  ed with efforts by state Sen. George 
Kilpatrick’s English ﬂ  uency hotline took it upon themselves to monitor teach-ers and classrooms for English ﬂ  uency. UF Student Body President Jeff Jonasen makes tentative plans to enforce Flor-ida’s English Proﬁ  ciency Law, but isn’t sure how to go about it. UF President Marshall Criser said the problem was be-ing addressed. 
July 21, 1992: The attorney for ac-
cused serial killer Danny Rolling ﬁ  led a motion requesting that evidence from the August 1990 student murders remain sealed until his ofﬁ  ce had sufﬁ  cient time to review the remaining reports. In the motion, public defender Rick Parker said he was unable to review all of the ﬁ  les prior to the deadline because of budget and personnel problems and because he had been spending time gathering testimony from Rolling’s mother, Clau-dia, because she may die before his case would be able to make it to court.
July 20, 1997: Darrick Alphonso Car-
roll, 27,  bites a Gainesville Police ofﬁ  -cer during a routine trafﬁ  c stop. Carroll was stopped by Sgt. Paul Forsberg for an expired license plate when Forsberg discovered Carroll was wanted for a misdemeanor trafﬁ  c warrant. Forsberg called two other GPD ofﬁ  cers to assist in the arrest when Carroll struck out and bit Hayes on the right forearm. He escaped temporarily, but was caught by ofﬁ  cers.

Florida’s offense has been ane-
mic the last couple of seasons and 
it’s one of the reasons UF went in a new direction at head coach. 
The Gators were among the worst 
teams in the Southeastern Confer-ence at generating yards per game under the Will Muschamp era. Last year, Florida’s offense ranked 104th in the country in total yards (4,411), with only Vanderbilt (125th, 3,460) being worse in the SEC.
But ﬁ  rst-year head coach Jim 
McElwain is working to create more 
dynamic opportunities for the of-
fense.
“We need to create explosive 
plays. Obviously we need to be able to change ﬁ  eld position,” McElwain said at SEC Media Days. “Some of that might be we’ll need to take chances in the special teams situ-ations to maybe get a couple more 
possessions."
UF’s offense last year under Kurt 
Roper was shotgun heavy, but McEl-
wain, along with offensive coordi-nator Doug Nussmeier, has made it a priority to change the language in the playbook and open it up for more offensive formations.
“The play calling from last year is 
totally different you know we were shotgun really all game,” sopho-more wide receiver Brandon Powell said at SEC Media Days. “But now this year, we’re shotgun, under cen-ter, two wide, maybe go ﬁ  ve wide sometimes. You got a lot of variety and play calling so that’s going to help us out.”
Morrison and Thurman 
progressing:  McElwain conﬁ  rmed 
there is no timetable for linebacker Antonio Morrison’s return as he’s still recovering from a knee injury. Morrison injured his knee during 
Florida’s 28-20 win against East Car-olina in the Birmingham Bowl on 
Jan. 3. McElwain also said Morrison will be limited to no-contact drills when the Gators open up Fall camp on Aug. 6.
On the other side of the injury re-
port, McElwain said offensive line-man Trip Thurman will be ready to go for Florida once camp opens. 
Thurman, who started 10 games last year at left guard, missed all of 
Spring practice dealing with a shoul-der injury. It’s the same shoulder that he had offseason surgery on in 2013. Thurman is expected to make the transition to center this season.
New role for Jonathan Bull-
ard: Senior defensive lineman Jona-
than Bullard will be moving around on the defensive line. McElwain said that the Shelby, North Carolina, na-tive will be playing multiple spots along the line as Florida tries to use 
him in different defensive packages, 
similar to the role Dante Fowler Jr. took on last year. 
“We hope to move him around 
quite a bit,” McElwain said. “From an offensive standpoint, if you al-ways know where that guy is you can always slide your protection, chip a back, bump him with a tight 
end on the way out whatever that is.
“So what we try to do is make 
sure we’re putting him in different 
spots so it’s not as easy from an of-fensive standpoint to know where that guy is.”
Bullard started all 12 games last 
year and had 8.5 tackles-for-loss, third most on the team, and had 2.5 
sacks while recording 52 tackles.  
Freshman wide receiver 
making early impression:  An-
tonio Callaway has impressed his 
teammates since he’s arrived on campus. Callaway, a four-star wide receiver according to Rivals.com, 
stood out to Powell during the play-
er-run workouts.
“He’s going to be a good player 
for us this year,” Powell said. “He’s just one of those shifty receivers, one of those South Florida guys 
that (has) all the athleticism in the 
world.”  
Callaway was named to the 2014 
Class 4A All-State First Team and helped Miami Booker T. Washing-ton High to a state title last year.

Scottie Wilbekin has seen his bas-
ketball road go through twists and turns since his UF career came to a bittersweet end.
After leading the Gators to a Fi-
nal Four berth and receiving accolade af-
ter accolade in 2014, the point guard and 
Gainesville native found himself undrafted and heading overseas to continue his bas-ketball career that was hanging on by a thread.
But with his back against the wall, Wil-
bekin did what he does best: He stepped up.
Now, after a stellar year with the Cairns 
Taipans of Australia’s National Basketball League and a strong showing in his ﬁ  nal NBA Summer League, Wilbekin ﬁ  nally has his shot to compete in the NBA.The Philadelphia 76ers of-
fered the 22-year-old Wilbekin a four-year contract after he 
averaged 16 points per game 
and shot 44.1 percent from downtown in their ﬁ  ve summer league games in Las Vegas.
And frankly, it’s about time 
for Wilbekin.
He turned his life around in 
his ﬁ  nal year at UF, becoming a better all-around player, athlete and per-
son.
After his ﬁ  rst three years with the 
Gators — three years that almost saw for-
mer UF coach Billy Donovan kick Wilbekin 
off the team on more than one occasion — 
Wilbekin transformed into one of Florida’s rocks on and off the court his senior year, a leader among leaders on an upperclassman-heavy roster.
He led the Gators in average 
minutes (34.0), steals (1.6) and assist-to-turnover ratio (2.1:1) while also putting up 13.1 points and committing just 59 
personal fouls — the lowest 
among UF’s regular contribu-tors.
He made plays when needed.
Yet when the 2014 NBA Draft rolled 
around and his name went unannounced, 
his professional career in the United States 
looked bleak.
Teams didn’t want to risk seeing Wil-
bekin revert to his old ways once he moved 
away from the comfort of his hometown, 
his college team and his college coach who forced Wilbekin to make life-changing de-cisions to continue playing.
So Wilbekin moved overseas and played 
a season of basketball in Australia.
He proved his critics wrong.The 6-foot-2 Wilbekin led the Cairns 
Taipans to their ﬁ  rst playoff berth in four 
years while posting a team-best 15.2 points 
and 4.3 assists per game and ﬁ  nishing sec-ond with 1.1 steals per contest.
He played all 32 games for the Taipans 
— no suspensions, no injuries — and was 
on the court for a team-high 30.8 minutes 
each game.
Now he’s back in the U.S., looking to 
stay hot and ready to see his NBA career 
take off.
And his performance in his 10 NBA Scottie Wilbekin overcame struggles, setbacks to sign NBA contract with 76ersAndres Leiva  / Alligator Staff

“We are aware of the news 
involving J.C. Jackson, and he 
is currently dealing with a se-
rious issue,” McElwain said. 
“We don’t condone any of his actions, and it is not something that reflects on the expecta-
tions we have in the program. 
It is being handled accordingly due to the severity of his ac-tions.”
Jackson’s attorney, Christo-
pher Brown, said in April his client had no role in the shoot-ing and didn’t know the other two suspects. 
A trial date has been set for 
Oct. 11.
An Immokalee native, 
Jackson practiced with the first team defense during the 
Spring. The redshirt freshman was 
expected to provide depth in 
the secondary for the Gators. 
 Jackson, a four-star recruit 
and the No. 21 ranked corner-back in the 2014 recruiting class according to Rivals.com, 
played in Florida’s season-
opening win against Eastern Michigan last season before receiving a medical redshirt after re-aggravating a shoulder 
injury that required labrum 
surgery.JACKSON,  from pg 1His trial date has 
been set for Oct. 11

expectations we have in the 
program. It is being handled 
accordingly due to the 
severity of his actions.”
Jim McElwain
UF football coachSummer League games — five with the Or-
lando Magic and five more with the 76ers — definitely didn’t hurt his stock.
Wilbekin flat-out dominated, averaging 
12.8 points and 2.4 assists per game and sinking 42.4-percent of his three-pointers in the process.
He knows how to feed off his team-
mates.  
He knows how to make his own plays. And he knows he has what it takes to 
make it in the NBA.
All Wilbekin needed was an opportunity 
to prove himself, an opportunity the 76ers have given him. 
Still, the move is a gamble. Wilbekin had resigned with the Taipans 
for next season, but his contract included an 
NBA out clause. 
Although he has a contract, he’s no-
where near a guaranteed roster spot. There 
are countless obstacles he'll still have to overcome. 
Trades, last-second drops and straight 
up releases are all possibilities lingering over Wilbekin’s head. 
And the 76ers — a team seemingly in a 
constant state of rebuilding — could decide at any point to treat Wilbekin like an asset 
and move him. 
It’s up to him to make sure none of that 
happens.
The ball is in his court, and if the last 
12 months have proved anything, Wilbekin 
will take advantage of every second he has.TUESDAY, JULY 21, 2015   ALLIGATOR   15

Zach Johnson cradled the sil-
ver claret jug in his arms. Jordan 
Spieth let it slip through his fin-gers.
Spieth was right where he 
wanted to be in his spirited bid for the Grand Slam — tied for the lead with two holes to go in the British Open, right after making a 50-foot birdie putt that made it feel as though he were destined to win at St. Andrews for his third straight major.
And he was still there at the 
very end Monday, but only as a spectator.
The slam gone, Spieth gra-
ciously returned to the steps of the Royal & Ancient clubhouse to watch Johnson finish off a sterling performance of his own. Johnson rolled in a 30-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole that got him into 
a three-man playoff, and he out-
lasted Louis Oosthuizen and Marc Leishman to win the British Open.
Johnson described himself as a 
“normal guy” from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, when he won the Masters in 2007.
And now?“I’m a normal guy from Cedar 
Rapids ... with a green jacket that has something that most guys don’t get to drink out of right now,” Johnson said, smiling as he looked at golf’s oldest trophy with his name etched alongside most of the game’s greatest players.
Spieth was close to having his 
name on that jug. No one ever 
came closer to the third leg of the 
Grand Slam.
He fought back from taking 
four putts for a double bogey on No. 8 with back-to-back birdies. He rolled in that long birdie putt on the 16th for a share of the lead. After missing an 8-foot par putt on the tough 17th hole, Spieth need-
ed a birdie on the closing hole to 
join the playoff.
“Up and down for a playoff,” 
was the last thing Spieth said to caddie Michael Greller from about 90 yards away. It was too far right and quite hard enough, and it rolled to the edge of the Valley of Sin short of the green. His birdie attempt up the slope stayed inch-es left of the cup, and he tapped 
in for a 69.
“We gave it a great effort,” Spi-
eth said.
At least he was in elite com-
pany. Arnold Palmer, Jack Nick-
laus and Tiger Woods — the three biggest names in golf over the last 50 years — were the only other players to capture the Masters 
and U.S. Open in a bid to sweep 
the four professional majors in the same year. All came up short in the British Open. Spieth was the only one who had a share of the lead so deep in the final round.“I’m going to go home and re-
flect,” Spieth said. “It won’t hurt too bad. It’s not like I really lost it on the last hole, and 17 was bru-tally challenging. I just didn’t hit a great putt there, and I just picked the wrong wedge out of the bag 
on 18. I made a lot of the right 
decisions down the stretch and certainly closed plenty of tourna-ments out. And this just wasn’t one of those. It’s hard to do that every single time.
“I won’t beat myself up too 
bad, because I do understand that.”
It took a superlative effort from 
Johnson, who now has two ma-jors among his 12 PGA Tour vic-tories, an astounding record and a reminder that a good wedge game and a putter can still go a long way in this era of power.
Johnson was in tears when he 
was interviewed off the green.
“I’m grateful. I’m humbled. 
I’m honored,” Johnson said. “This is the birthplace of the game, and that jug means so much in sports.”
On a tense afternoon of shad-
ows and showers on the Old 
Course, Johnson closed with a 
6-under 66. He was the first in at 15-under 273.
Leishman, who considered giv-
ing up golf in April when his wife nearly died of a rare respiratory illness, fell out of the lead with a bogey on the 16th hole. He had a birdie putt for the win on the 18th 
that was wide left and gave him 
a 66. Oosthuizen made a 10-foot par putt on No. 17 to stay one shot behind, and he delivered a clutch moment of his own with a wedge to 5 feet for birdie and a 69 to join the playoff.
It was the first British Open playoff since Stewart Cink beat Tom Watson at Turnberry in 2009, and the first involving more than two players since 2002 at Muirfield, the year Woods failed in his bid for the third leg of the slam.
Johnson matched Oosthui-
zen’s birdie on the first hole and 
pulled ahead with another birdie 
on No. 2. Both made bogey on the 17th — Oosthuizen by missing a 5-foot putt to tie Johnson — and the South African had one last chance. Oosthuizen, who won the British Open when it last was at St. Andrews in 2010, had a 12-foot birdie putt to force sudden death. 
It touched the left side of the cup 
and kept going, and Johnson was introduced as the “champion golf-er of the year.”
Spieth showed guts over the 
final two hours, and class when his bid was over. He stuck around to hug Johnson before he walked over to get his trophy.
Just two weeks ago, Spieth 
went to Iowa to take part in a charity event for Johnson before playing — and winning — the John Deere Classic. He was ques-tioned for not coming over to St. Andrews to prepare for a rare oc-casion of attempting the Grand Slam. Spieth put that to rest with a 
performance that kept him around 
the lead all week.
It was the first British Open 
to end on Monday since 1988 because of a brief rain delay Fri-day morning and 10½-hour wind delay on Saturday. But what a show. With 14 players separated by three shots, no one seized con-
trol the entire day. Eight players 
had at least a share of the lead at one point. Most of them fell away.
Spieth kept a golfing nation in 
suspense until the very end. Now, he goes to the PGA Championship with a tiny piece of history left to chase. Woods in 2000 and Ben Hogan in 1953 are the only other 
players to win three majors in a 
year, and no one has ever swept the three American majors.
At 21, he can only hope he gets 
another shot at the slam. Palmer, Nicklaus and Woods never did.

Spieth sees Grand Slam hopes erasedTiger Woods needs to take some time 
away from golf and get his mind right if he ever hopes to compete in the sport 
he once dominated. 
While Jordan Spieth saw his pursuit 
of the Grand Slam fall short, unable to capture 
his third-straight major despite being tied for 
the lead with two holes to play, Zach Johnson 
displayed poise similar to his 2007 Masters Tournament Championship that made him a household name. 
Johnson defeated Louis Oosthuizen and Marc Leish-
man in a three-man playoff to capture the 144th British Open on Monday.
The wealth of competition in golf reﬂ  ects the resur-
gence the sport has witnessed over the past decade.
But more noticeably, it’s been during the decline of 
Woods, considered for years to be one of the greatest golf-ers in the history of the game. 
Woods was an afterthought at St. Andrews over the 
weekend. 
He missed the cut after a brief weather delay, ﬁ  nishing 
the tournament at 7-over-par.
It was the ﬁ  rst time in his career that Woods has 
missed the cut in back-to-back majors.
Woods is a shell of his former self. At just 39-years-
old, he doesn’t appear to be capable of regaining his pre-vious world-class form. 
There have been elbow, knee and, most recently, back 
injuries that have kept Woods from dominating in major competitions since 2009. 
This is the golfer who won the Masters when he was 
just 21 — a feat duplicated by Spieth earlier this year.
The consensus seems to be that Spieth is the best 
young golfer, yet Woods is the legend with the talent. I don’t think that will be the case much lon-
ger.
While Spieth currently ranks as the No. 2 
golfer in the world, Woods is no longer ranked in the world’s top 250.
It’s hard for Woods to admit that he’s de-
clined or fallen off.
“I felt like I was playing well enough to win 
this event,” Woods said. “I had my opportuni-ties, I just didn’t get the ball close enough. And 
then when I did, I didn’t make them.”
No, Tiger, you weren’t playing well enough to win. 
Your talent level is enough to keep you in contention, but you don’t ﬁ  nish holes well. 
For every fantastic drive down the fairway there’s a 
shot that induces a ﬁ  t of rage for Woods.
The saddest part about Woods’ decline? It’s all mental.The doctors have cleared Woods to compete and he 
claims his body isn’t the problem. Maybe the pressure of competing is too much for Woods to handle.
Woods loves golf, and he loves dominating the sport-
even more. But with his achievements came celebrity and fame, which brought with it the affection of women.
Woods’ reputation never quite recovered from his 
highly publicized divorce from Elin Nordegren, and I 
don’t think Woods himself was able to deal with the on-
slaught of public scrutiny and exploitation that followed. 
There isn’t a sole reason why Tiger Woods has de-
clined, but it’s obvious he has. 
He’s noticeably struggling whenever he’s on the 
course, and there’s no deﬁ  nite aspect of his game that’s 
holding him back. 
It’s only a matter of time until Woods takes another 
leave from golf. 
Except the next time could be the last time. 16   ALLIGATOR    TUESDAY, JULY 21, 2015
