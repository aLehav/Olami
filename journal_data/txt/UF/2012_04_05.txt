Erin Andrews speaks at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts on Wednesday night.

After ﬁ  ghting her way up the 
sports media ladder, Erin An-
drews brieﬂ  y climbed back down 
Wednesday to return to where her 
career started.
Accent Speakers’ Bureau and 
the Women’s Student Association 
paid Andrews, a UF alumna and 
ESPN sideline reporter, $15,000 to speak at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts.
Andrews’ bubbly personality 
raised many laughs from her audi-ence of about 500. 
She was forced to decline an 
invitation to a fraternity member’s 
formal and poked fun of a front-
row fan sporting an Indiana jer-sey.
“Why are you wearing that?” 
Andrews joked.
But her famous looks and Gator 
roots are not the only traits that at-tracted the crowds.
Telecommunication freshman 
Megan Gannon, 19, who waited in front of the Phillips Center for three hours to see Andrews, said she idolizes the reporter and wants to work alongside her one day.
“I like how opinionated she is,” Gannon said. “She speaks very 
well as a woman in a male-domi-
nated profession.”
Andrews graduated from UF 
in 2000 with a degree in telecom-
munications. During her time in Gainesville, she was a member of the Dazzlers, the ofﬁ  cial dance team for UF athletics.
Andrews said she knows she 
is one of the prominent females 
in her ﬁ  eld and it only makes her 
work harder to prove herself to her peers.
“I’m a huge sports fan,” An-
drews said, “and I’ve met the male 
sports fans that don’t know as 
much as I do. Every day, I try so hard to prove to people I belong.”
While Andrews has fought hard 
to earn her credibility, several male viewers said they don’t doubt her abilities.
“It shouldn’t matter whether 
you’re a man or woman,” said 
Alex Everett, a 21-year-old chemi-
cal engineering senior. “She’s a good reporter, no matter what.”Erin Andrews gets laughs, date invitation at Phillips Center

Shands Hospital for Children at UF 
received $23,000 in donations Wednes-
day, courtesy of a 7-year-old, his family 
and an online video of them dancing.
Gainesville’s Pence family won the 
money and placed second in the Prim-rose Schools Family Dance-off competi-
tion beneﬁ  ting Children’s Miracle Net-
work Hospitals.
Tyler Pence, 7, has been a patient at 
Shands since he was 3 months old. He has been treated for a cleft lip and a notch in his gum.
The family earned a $20,000 donation 
to Shands at UF and a $3,000 cash prize at a Wednesday ceremony from the Prim-rose Children’s Foundation. The family decided to give its cash to the hospital.
This year, 117 families across the 
nation submitted 30-second videos of 
themselves dancing. First place went to 
the Peetz family of Kannapolis, N.C., 
and third place went to the Froehlich 
family of Xenia, Ohio.
Nathan Pence, Tyler’s father, said his 
family is happy about winning second place and donating the prize money to Shands at UF.
“We actually looked at the videos of 
the other families, and we were secretly pulling for the Peetz family,” he said. “If 
we didn’t win it, we wanted them to win 
it.”

City and county ofﬁ  cials are pushing to 
lower the speed limit on a stretch of Inter-
state 75, and Florida Department of Trans-
portation ofﬁ  cials will conduct a study to see 
if the move would be possible and realistic.
In the wake of the Jan. 29 crashes that 
killed 11 people, Mayor Craig Lowe and 11 city and county commissioners asked the state transportation department to provide them with the criteria necessary to reduce the 70 mph speed limit to 55 mph.
While ofﬁ  cials are saying the change 
would make I-75 safer, some students said the move is an overreaction.“This would be adding more problems 
instead of helping,” said Christina Barker, a 26-year-old ﬁ  rst-year political campaigning 
graduate student.
She drives two hours from Pasco County 
to Gainesville three days a week and said 
drivers already slow down 
before the Gainesville exit. 
To lower the speed limit 
where the ofﬁ  cials want, between County Road 234 and State Road 222, would 
make trafﬁ  c even worse.
“I would hate that, ac-
tually,” Barker said.
The speed limit has never been changed 
in the area, said Gina Busscher, a transporta-tion department spokeswoman.

Police search for missing man
Police are looking for a 
Gainesville man who was re-
ported missing Tuesday night.
Roy Dillard, 69, was reported 
missing by his daughter, Samaria Dillard, when he didn’t return home Tuesday.
Dillard left his house, 321 NW 
21st Lane, at about 10:30 p.m. Tuesday to get a money order from Walmart, pay bills and go to his church in Fairbanks, said 
Gainesville Police spokeswoman 
Cpl. Angelina Valuri.
It is uncharacteristic for Dil-
lard not to return home, Valuri 
said. Dillard is a Type-2 diabetic, 
and at times he can become dis-oriented.
His daughters have looked 
for him at places he frequents: Big Lots, Publix, the Waldo Flea 
Market and Piccadilly.
Dillard was last seen in a ma-
roon Hyundai Sonata with Veter -
ans Affairs tag No. DV5890A.

Florida Sen. Bill Nelson met with his 
constituents Wednesday afternoon for a 
town hall meeting as part of his re-election campaign.
Nelson spoke to a crowd of about 30 at 
the Florida Innovation Hub, berating state election law and urging bipartisanship in all levels of the government.
Gainesville was one of at least 10 town 
hall stops the senator will make around Florida.
“Sen. Nelson and the city of Gainesville 
are certainly no strangers,” Mayor Craig Lowe said. “He checks in frequently to let us know what is going on in Washington 
and how that impacts us. We have a lot to 
thank him for.”
Nelson went on to rail against changes 
the Florida Legislature, which is mainly comprised of Republicans, made to the state election law. These measures include cutting early voting hours in at least half 
and disallowing voting on the Sunday be-
fore an election.
He said research shows that Sunday 
is the time when most African Americans and Hispanics vote.
“It’s hard for me to believe this is hap-
pening in 2012 in America,” Nelson said. “I thought we 
went through this in 
the right of access to the ballot during the civil rights battle.”
He expressed the 
need for bipartisan-ship.
Frank Ogborn, audience member and 
mayor of Archer, agreed.
“I’m a Republican. He’s a Democrat,” 
Ogborn said. “But, I’m here anyway be-cause we’ve got to work together.”

Florida senator discusses 
state election law at meeting � GROUP SAYS KEY DECISIONS 
WERE MADE IN PRIVATE.

A group of Gainesville residents are su-
ing Gainesville Regional Utilities to get a city 
power agreement thrown out.
Gainesville Citizens CARE Inc., a non-
profit organization created to protest the 
agreement, said the city violated state pub-
lic-meeting laws when signing an agree-ment to get power from a wood-burning power plant, according to a complaint filed Wednesday.
The Gainesville City Commission signed 
a roughly $3 billion contract in 2009 to buy 30 years of power from the new plant, which will be owned by American Renewables.
“This contract is void because of the way 
it was done,” said Jo Beaty, a board member of Gainesville Citizens CARE Inc. “The pub-lic process has been violated throughout the whole approval of this.”
City Commissioner Thomas Hawkins said the accusation is incorrect and each step was done through public meetings.
The complaint states the negotiations 
were not open to the public and the meeting notes were not available for residents to see.
It also states final changes to the contract, 
including changing the agreement from 20 years to 30 years, were made in private.
This isn’t the first time residents have 
been concerned about the agreement.
The County Commission is considering 
using another utility provider for its build-
ings because the wood-burning plant would 
increase its utility bills. Residents are also concerned about utility bill increases — a sentiment echoed by some City Commission candidates in the spring races.
Hawkins said any new power plant 
would increase rates. He said the wood-burning plant was the cheapest long-term option available to the city.
“Prices increase over time,” he said. “It’s 
something that we have to deal with, and the way we deal with it is we work every day to keep our rates low.”

The gentle clanging of cymbals 
and drums drifted through the 
farmers market tents, like the people sniffing scents wafting from nearby herbs and soaps.
Wednesday marked the 16th an-
niversary of the Union Street Farm-ers Market at Bo Diddley Commu-nity Plaza.
Charlie Lybrand, 62, director of 
the farmers market, said the vendors at the market know more about their products than some grocery store employees.
“There’s a whole feeling of com-
munity between the vendors and the customers,” he said. “It’s an ex-perience.”
Lybrand, who is also a beekeeper 
and sells infused honey , started the first Union Street Farmers Market in 1996 at the Sun Center plaza. Eight vendors and about 12 loyal families 
attended the market’s inauguration.
He said the market’s growth was 
slow until about four and half years 
ago, when it outgrew the Sun Center plaza and moved to the Bo Diddley Community Plaza. Once the market relocated to a more visible location, it took off.
Now, about 55 vendors sell ev-
erything from orchids to cheese to jewelry.
Lybrand said he wanted to start 
a Gainesville market after a county market became too restrictive, only allowing produce and vegetables to be sold. He wanted to open a market to bakers, farmers, artists and musi-cians.
“There’s a huge amount of talent 
in this community,” he said. “Some-times, that’s taken for granted.”
Ashley Helfrich, a 22-year-old UF 
early childhood education graduate student, was a first-time market-goer. She said she was surprised to find bread, ethnic foods and shaved ice.
“Now that I’ve been here and see what they have, I’ll probably come back next week to do some grocery shopping,” Helfrich said.
Jose Landrua, 23, hopes Helfrich 
will buy some vegetables from his farm, LaLa Land. He moved from Fort Lauderdale with his brother, Javier, 21, to start an organic farm in Alachua a few months ago.Landrua said the farmers market 
gives him another place to sell his produce and support his brother and himself.
“This is where my passion is,” he 
said.

week study to see how fast 85 
percent of people drive down the interstate, Busscher said.
After a series of meetings, 
the state transportation de-partment will have the final say in whether the speed lim-
it changes.
Lowe said the speed limit 
needs to be reduced to pro-
tect drivers from crashing when there are too many cars 
on the road.
The area between CR 234 
and SR 222 has become more 
urban, Lowe said, and in the 
past few years the number 
of cars on the interstate has spiked.
He said that type of con-
gestion can be dangerous 
when it’s dark outside or, in 
rare cases like the January crashes, if there is smoke in the area.
“Speed definitely factors 
into a reaction time, which factors into having an acci-dent or having an accident with a fatality,” Lowe said.

UF’s Entomology Club gave people 
something to buzz about Wednesday 
night with its second annual BugFest 
Open House.
About 500 students and Gainesville-
area residents gathered at Charles Stein-
metz Hall on the south side of campus.
The event aimed to promote ento-
mology — the study of insects — and to recruit students to the major.
“It’s a showcasing of the entomology 
department to get people to understand 
what entomology is and how it actually 
plays a great role in their lives,” said Al-yssa Porter, the event’s coordinator and a 22-year-old entomology senior.
Visitors were able to tour the depart-
ment’s research facilities, talk to ento-mology advisers and professors, partici-
pate in Hollywood-themed games and 
competitions, and witness a live butter -
fly release.
Games included cricket-spitting com-
petitions, a cockroach race to the Oscars 
and Hollywood Walk of Fame maggot 
art.
Live arthropods drew in visitors who 
held Madagascar hissing cockroaches 
and millipedes that can grow up to 2 
feet long.
Emperor scorpions and Chilean rose-
hair tarantulas were on display, but vis-itors were not allowed to handle them.
Chris Thomas, a 20-year-old graphic design junior, said the cockroach races were his favorite part.
“You have your cockroach on the ta-
ble, and you just guide them in the right 
direction,” he said. “I ended cutting the 
other cockroach off and came in for the win.”
The maggot art display maintained 
a crowd of about 20 people throughout 
the night. 
Attendees were able to dip live fruit-
eating maggots into paint, then watch 
them crawl around on star-shaped pa-
per.
The first 400 visitors to the free event 
received tickets to the Florida Museum 
of Natural History’s Butterfly Rainforest as well as a food voucher for pizza. 
Academic information was available 
to students and highlighted the degree tracks within the entomology major, such as ecotourism, basic science, pre-
professional and urban pest manage-
ment.
Thomas said one of his friends was 
able to get advice from a graduate stu-dent about what entomology class she 
should take next semester.
Porter said the pre-professional de-
gree track is a good option for students 
who want to go to medical, dental or 
veterinary school.
“It meets application requirements 
and can help make your application 
stand out from the hundreds of biology majors applying,” she said.BugFest promotes entomology, recruits new studentsReader response

Last week, the Supreme Court heard arguments on the 
constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Afford-able Care Act, more colloquially known as Obamacare. 
Now President Obama is using his office to inappropriately sway the court’s eventual ruling.
A large part of the controversy surrounds a provision 
called the individual mandate, which would force every 
American to purchase some form of health insurance.
Some of the comments made by Obama on Monday are 
unnecessary and worrying, especially coming from a former constitutional law professor.
Specifically, Obama said, “I’m confident that the Su-
preme Court will not take what would be an unprecedented, 
extraordinary step of overturning a law that was passed by a 
strong majority of a democratically elected Congress.”
He continued, “And I’d just remind conservative com-
mentators that for years what we’ve heard is the biggest 
problem on the bench was judicial activism or a lack of ju-dicial restraint — that an unelected group of people would 
somehow overturn a duly constituted and passed law.”
By referencing a possible overturning of this law as “an 
unprecedented, extraordinary step,” Obama is attacking the 
Supreme Court. By calling the nine most powerful judges in the world “an unelected group of people” who should ex-
ercise “judicial restraint,” he is negligently using his office 
in an attempt to sway what is supposed to be an unbiased decision.
Obama’s preemptive strike took the form of his usual 
political calculations — attacks disguised as commentary — easily defended later as a mere analysis but clearly a form of masked coercion.
It was a passive-aggressive attempt to inject his liberal 
viewpoint in what should otherwise be an objective decision 
based on the Constitution of the United States.
Mr. President, the fact that the Supreme Court is an “un-
elected group of people” is exactly what our Founding Fa-
thers intended. As Obama certainly must understand, it is the very spirit of our republic to vest the ultimate power to interpret the constitution in this “unelected” group — a group which he helped appoint.
This power is not given to 
Congress, and just because a “strong majority of a democrati-cally elected Congress” voted 
for the bill does not mean that it 
cannot be unconstitutional at the same time. 
The strength of the majority has nothing to do with the 
constitutionality of the law. It is inappropriate for the presi-dent to suggest otherwise.
Ever since Marbury v . Madison gave the Supreme Court 
the power of judicial review, the courts have struck down laws.
The president is worried. You can tell he is worried be-
cause he is saying he is “confident” that the Supreme Court will uphold the law.
In the backward world of politics, elected officials say 
one thing when they mean another. Obama would not have released such a strong-armed statement if he didn’t think it would reach the ears of the Supreme Court and affect its de-cision.
Don’t get me wrong, I fully believe that the individual 
mandate is well within the constitutional power of Congress. I fully believe that Obamacare is constitutional. I fully believe that if the Supreme Court overturns this law, it would be 
deeply rooted in politics and not in the court’s historic ob-
jectivity.
But I do not fully believe that politics should be used to 
help sway the court’s decision.
I do not believe it is appropriate for the president to inject 
such brash and inappropriate language to condemn an action by the court. And, perhaps most worrying, I do not believe that the president believes in what he is actually saying.

Supreme Court rules 
in favor of searches 
In 1907, Charles Evans Hughes, New York governor and 
eventual chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, said, “The judiciary is the safeguard of liberty ... under the Constitu-
tion.”
Alexander Hamilton, secretary of the treasury and an author 
of The Federalist Papers, wrote in Federalist 78 that the judicial branch “is equally requisite to guard the Constitution and the rights of individuals from the effects ... of occasional ill humors in the society.”
Though the Supreme Court of the United States is supposed 
to act as this safeguard of individual rights against majority rule and expansions in executive power, it does not always side with the individual.
On Monday, according to NPR, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 
“that guards may routinely strip search even minor traffic of-fenders when they are arrested and detained.”
When Albert Florence was pulled over by a state trooper in 
2005, his records showed that he had a 7-year-old outstanding arrest warrant for failing to pay a fine.
Although Florence had a receipt in his car indicating that the 
fine had been paid, the state trooper arrested Florence and took him to jail. The story by NPR says that Florence “was held in jail for seven days and strip-searched twice.”
Florence eventually sued, arguing that he was subjected to 
unreasonable searches as described in the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution.
Unfortunately for Florence, the majority disagreed. Justice 
Anthony Kennedy , who wrote the majority opinion for the court, argued that “the courts must defer to the judgment of cor -
rectional officials in order to prevent new inmates from putting lives at risk with weapons or contraband that they may ‘carry in on their bodies.’”
In his dissent, Justice Stephen Breyer countered that correc-
tional officials need to have a reasonable justification for con-ducting a strip search on minor offenders. He also noted that those charged with minor offenses probably did not plan on be-ing arrested and, therefore, would not have tried to hide contra-band in their body cavities.
One of Kennedy’s main arguments was completely asinine 
and illogical. He argued that the fact that Timothy McV eigh was pulled over and charged for a minor offense and turned out 
to be the Oklahoma City bomber shows how minor offenders 
could be dangerous criminals.
The chances of something like that happening on a regular 
basis are slim to none.
Finally, the majority was made up of conservative justices — 
the same justices who argued that the mandate in “Obamacare” requiring everyone to purchase health insurance gives the gov-ernment too much power. Can you see the contradiction?
The government’s police powers have grown tremendous-
ly since 9/11, and Fourth Amendment protections continue to 
shrink.
The Supreme Court, or this supposed “safeguard of liberty ,” 
has failed to live up to its role.

Where we’re going, we don’t 
need cable.
Coming soon to a computer 
screen near you is “Euston Prep,” a 
new Web series out of Los Angeles.
Kacy Bartleigh, the 23-year-old 
director of the project, graduated from the New York Film Academy last year and has never worked on a project like this before.
“So far, the workload has been 
very much a labor of love,” she said. “Everyone gets along so well and is incredibly talented.”
Executive producer and co-cre-
ator/writer Andrew Connor has had the idea for a series like this for a few years, ever since “V eronica Mars” began to dwindle from the airwaves.
“Annie (Liu) and I are both huge 
fans of ‘Sherlock Holmes,’ and mod-eling the characters after Doyle’s 
archetypes, but putting them in a 
different location, seemed interest-ing to us,” he said. “We figured, as members of the entertainment-lov-ing public, it would be interesting to others as well.
“I hope people will realize why 
we’re doing this — to tell a good story,” Connor said.
Annie Liu, executive producer 
and co-creator of “Euston Prep,” works around schedules and prob-lems in order to keep the project moving forward.
She said Connor is “more in 
charge of the story and writing it because his work schedule is more intense,” and with Bartleigh’s help, 
she has been “mostly in charge of 
actual production.”
“We’ve finished a pilot script, 
and we’re in the process of finish-ing up outlining the rest of the six-episode season because we have an overarching series-long story in mind,” Liu said.
“Our photographer, Jason Bou-
langer who did the promotional photo shoot with us, did it all as a personal favor,” Liu said. “I think that says a lot about the passion and interest for this project: People are willing to donate their time and ser -
vices to helping us making ‘Euston Prep’ a reality.”
The crew will need more than fa-
vors from friends to make this proj-ect available to the public. In order to make the 45-minute pilot a reality , the team created an “Indiegogo” do-nation page. Their goal might seem large — $25,000 — but all donations will cover basic expenses needed to produce a pilot episode.
None of the money raised will go 
toward payment of the cast or crew, so it’s a good thing they love their work. Liu said she knows it’s “a lot to ask for people to work for free, but in the end, we’re all doing this because we wanted to create oppor -
tunities for ourselves to tell a really good story.”
“It has been such a collaborative 
process so far with everyone be-ing so open and accepting of ideas, which is very rare,” said Chelsea Taylor, the actress who plays Char -
lie Reid on “Euston Prep.”
Noah Hunt, 21-year-old actor 
and musician, plays Declan Rhodes. He met Taylor in an acting class a 
while ago, and she got him involved 
with the Web series. 
“I want people to connect with 
it,” Hunt said. “This story is original and intriguing, so if they do [con-nect with it], we will obtain the op-portunity to bring this piece of art to a much wider audience.”
Due to the creators’ love of “Sher -
lock Holmes” and “Veronica Mars,” viewers should expect plenty of sur -
prises from the Web series.“‘Euston Prep’ will bring you 
a lot of mystery, intrigue, and sus-pense, but there will also be a healthy 
dose of comedy if I have anything to 
do with it,” said Matt Devine, who plays Noah Bailey.
Some of Devine’s previous proj-
ects (“The Wedding Dance” and “Break of Day”) have also used donation-raising websites such as Indiegogo or Kickstarter to help pay for costs.
“I am no stranger to Web-based 
productions,” Devine said. “There is a lot of talent in Los Angeles, and the Internet is making it possible for more of that talent to be seen.”
“The Indiegogo project is amaz-
ing because it allows us to spread the word on different medias to a wide array of people,” said Kat Bradley, a 24-year-old writer of the show.
She got started on the project 
when Connor asked for her input during the beginning stages, and she was eventually asked to be a 
member of the team.
“I hope people realize that we’re 
a group of people dedicated to mak-
ing a good show, and they’ll be able to expect an exciting episode week after week. I am confident we can deliver.”

show come to life, visit www.indi-

murder and comedy
SUMMARY
“Euston Prep” is about a teen -
ager named Noah who earns a 
scholarship to attend a presti -
gious boarding school. He meets his roommate, Declan, a political dynasty heir, and Declan’s child-hood friend Charlie, the grand -
daughter of a famous movie star.
Unfortunately for Noah, De -
clan and Charlie drag him into a world of intrigue, political con -
spiracies and mystery as some -
thing more sinister seems to be at play on the quiet grounds of Euston Prep, proving that maybe boarding school is quite literally murder.

One of UF’s youngest professors has re-
leased a new book. Ben Wise, a historian of 
modern America who focuses on Southern 
history, gender and sexuality and cultural 
history, recently published “William Alex-ander Percy: The Curious Life of a Missis-sippi Planter and Sexual Freethinker.”
In this biography, Wise paints the com-
plex picture of a man who is mostly known as a white supremacist, but also provides a unique perspective through his world 
travels and life as a queer male and sexual 
liberationist.
Published a few weeks ago through 
University of North Carolina Press with a cover designed by his wife, the book has been met with positive reviews from crit-
ics and historians. 
Although this biogra-
phy is Wise’s first pub-lished book, he has al-ready made a name for 
himself in the field. 
In 2009, he was award-
ed the C. Vann Wood-
ward prize for the best 
dissertation in the field of Southern his-
tory, and he has had several articles pub-lished since 2008.
At UF, he’s known as one of the “cool” 
professors of the young generation who 
does interesting modern readings of his-tory and culture. Two years ago, he was 
named a teacher of the year in the College 
of Liberal Arts and Sciences. 
This semester, he is teaching under -
graduate-level courses Race and Power in American Society, 1865 to 1920 and Ameri-
can Culture from 1880 to 1940, along with 
independent study, master’s and doctor -
ate courses.Young UF professor publishes historical biography of the South

Screenplay writer David H. 
Steinberg, of the iconic teen movies 
“Slackers” and the “American Pie” 
series, shows that 10 years after the 
movies’ releases, when it comes to playing out teen lingo, sex drives and self-deprecations, he still un-
derstands teenagers — all of which 
we see in his new book “Last Stop This Town.”
With the upcoming “Ameri-
can Pie Reunion” flick, those who 
grew up watching Jim and the 
guys grow from horny teens to col-lege guys, and now parents, may think, “Damn, the years sure flew.” 
But now it’s time for them to move 
over for the new teens in town.
“Last Stop This Town” brings 
in a new set of teens who are just as lovable. Think of the growing-
up storylines we’ve come to love from “American Pie” and the 
raunchy humor we’ve picked up from hits such as “Superbad” and “The Hangover.” Mix that into this 
coming-of-age story about four 
friends who are in limbo between high school graduation and college — an area no film or book has ven-tured into quite like this.
They do what most 18-year-old 
high school seniors would do in this situation: live life to the fullest — or at least try to.
Dylan, Noah, Warren and Pike 
are characters who make up the perfect teen entourage. Dylan is the frustrated leader of the pack, who gets a lot of the soon-to-be-classic 
lines. Despite his confidence, he is 
very unsure of where to take his life and how to make his dad proud. Noah, the Ivy-League-bound boy, 
has the perfect life, the perfect 
balance of book smarts and street smarts and the perfect girlfriend — until they break up.
Warren is the way-too-talkative 
guy who respects women so much 
that instead of talking them into 
bed, he bores them to death with his chatter of “let’s exchange emails” and “are you on Facebook?” catch-phrases. He’s the guy who, as Dy-
lan perfectly de-scribes, girls will like when they’re older because 
right now they 
don’t want re-spect, they want 
someone “to tip the scales of their precarious self-esteem by making 
them feel special.”
And of course, what would a 
perfect teen epic be without the 
stoner? Pike is a smart, mouthy, 
laidback guy, who at one point in 
the story is described by a potential hookup as “funny, good-looking (in 
a young Sean Penn kind of way).” 
It’s impossible to not reference Jeff Spicoli, of 1982’s “Fast Times at Ridgemont High” fame — after all, 
he is the epitome of teen stoner.
This foursome of troubles and 
trifles creates an interesting dy-
namic that spends its days in the suburbs of Hartford, Conn., doing 
the usual activities: hooking up 
and bribing homeless men to buy booze for parties (one of the home-less men ends up drinking his stash 
and throwing his fecal matter at 
them).
So, to end their high school years 
on a high, they decide to go to an underground rave in New York. 
The journey to the rave drives the 
story forward, and along the way, they live, learn and come to terms with their futures.
Steinberg keeps readers on their 
toes with his witty, film-worthy lines and unexpected turns of events. When you think things are becoming cliche and expected, he 
throws unexpected elements into 
the teen mix.
With pop-culture references 
spanning the `80s, `90s, `00s and 
today, the appeal is wide. Anyone 
who has been a teen in the last 30 years will enjoy the romp and raunchiness that effortlessly and realistically flows throughout the 
novel. 
This will surely become a time-
less teen story, and  possibly a 
movie, that will greatly define the 
zeitgeist of teen culture for this 
new decade.
In fewer than 200 pages, Stein-
berg covers a lot of ground and takes us through the ups and 
downs that come with being a teen, 
all while allowing the four young men to grow for the better as their journey comes to end — or the be-
ginning, as many would say.
“Last Stop This Town” is already 
out, and David Steinberg has up-
coming Q&A and signing sessions.� THE SHOW WILL START AT 6:30 PM.

Forget the gold. To celebrate its 50th anniversary, the 
VISA Talent Show is taking a trip around the world.
VISA, or Volunteers for International Student Affairs, 
hosts its final event of International Month on Saturday at 
the O’Connell Center. The show starts at 6:30 p.m. and is free to the public.
The Japanese Club, India Inc., CaribSA, Filipino Stu-
dent Association, Dancin’ Gators, Club Creole and Sabor Latino are all competing with 10-minute routines to grab 
the first-place trophy.
Advertising junior Monica Desai, this year’s talent 
show director, said VISA wanted to create its 50th annual 
talent show differently. 
The crew created an introduction to the show that dis-
plays dancing throughout the decades.
“It’s basically a journey through dance,” Desai said.The journey plays off International Month’s “30 Days 
Around the World” theme, which began March 11. Saturday’s talent show is the last stop.Each of the seven teams must incorporate their heritage 
into performances, Desai said, to take audience members around the world of their culture.
For Hispanic teams such as Sabor Latino, attendees go 
through countries in South America and Spain. CaribSA and Club Creole will bring in Caribbean moves.
The VISA talent show isn’t just any competitive show.
Teams make Saturday’s show a priority, and Desai said 
her favorite part is seeing how every group works toward 
winning.
“It’s really, really awesome to eventually see they’ve 
been practicing endless hours a day for this,” she said.
Each team expresses their creativity through integrated 
outfit changes and props in their routines.
“It’s not just a two-minute performance where you sit 
down and it’s over,” Desai said. “It’s 10 minutes of telling you a story — where they 
come from, what they do, how they dress — all while en-tertaining you.”
One aspect VISA has been working on is improving the 
show’s professionalism.
Desai was last year’s talent show stage manager, and 
she wanted to switch out of student hosts. That vision brought GLoZell, a UF alumna and YouTube comedienne, to the O’Dome.
This year, VISA is bringing actor-comedian Brian 
Dunkleman, who’s better known for co-hosting “Ameri-can Idol” season one with Ryan Seacrest.
The talent show’s professional image matches its grow-
ing attendance, Desai said.
The VISA Talent Show gets bigger annually, originally 
starting in the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts. Now, it’s in the O’Connell Center, where 3,000 to 4,000 students attend.
Saturday night, audiences can prepare to travel through 
Latin America, Southeast Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.
“It’s great that people can come out to a show like this 
for free and be entertained by organizations they’ve never heard,” Desai said. 
“You’re going around the world in one night.”“It’s great that people can come out to a show

An eclectic mix with a nostalgic sound is 
what South Africa natives Civil Twilight offer 
in its new album, “Holy Weather.”
This sophomore album contains a total of 
11 tracks, with three bonus tracks featured on 
iTunes, and a distinct opposition to their self-
titled first album.
What “Holy Weather” offers is a soothing, 
alternative tone that meshes well with vocalist Steven McKellar’s haunting voice, as opposed to the group’s darker, “grunge-esque” first al-bum.
Touching on some eerie styles similar to 
Brand New’s “Daisy,” “Holy Weather” con-
tains depth-filled tracks.
The single “Fire Escape,” featured on the 
album, is a more mainstream alternative song 
with an airy-sounding bassline that is easy for alternative lovers to get into.
“It’s Over” is the main ballad of the album. 
It incorporates emotional lyrics with soft gui-tars and simple beats.
The track lineup for “Holy Weather” gives 
listeners an introduction to Civil Twilight’s unique sound, starting off with more upbeat 
songs and progressing to more mellow ballads. How-ever, it comes full-circle, 
ending with energetic and enlightened tracks.
In an interview with 
Fuse TV , McKellar said that while the band was on the road, there was more pres-sure to get this album fin-
ished than the previous album.
“I love pressure; I love working under 
those situations,” McKellar said. “Usually that is when the most amazing stuff comes out, if you’re ready for it.”
McKellar, Richard Wouters and McKellar’s 
brother, Andrew McKellar, formed Civil Twi-light in their South African home, Cape Town, 
and found that coming to the U.S. has been a 
vital part of their career.
Once the group got to the United States, 
Civil Twilight started in Los Angeles but found its niche in Nashville, Tenn., immersing themselves into the Southern culture.
Due to their South African roots, the band’s 
style is quite distinct with an earthy sound and provides a unique branch of alternative for the 
U.S. audience.
The band signed with Wind-up Records, 
which produced its first huge hit, “Letters 
From the Sky.”
Civil Twilight’s albums can be purchased 
on iTunes, and “Holy Weather” is now stream-ing on the band’s website, civiltwilightband.com.Civil Twilight’s sophomore album features soothing, distinct soundmusic

� GAMEDAY DESIGNS FOR GFW
DANA BURKE
Avenue Writer
Among the people in Gators T-shirts, 
jerseys and frat tanks in the Swamp on 
football Saturdays, a few girls stand out 
from the crowd looking perfect in their 
gameday dresses — thanks to Jacquelyn Brooks.
Brooks, a Gainesville fashion designer, 
will be showing her creations as part of a Gainesville Fashion Week runway show on Saturday, April 14, at Villa East, located at 301 N. Main St. Her show will feature ready-to-wear pieces as well as formal 
wear.
Brooks got her start in design by sew-
ing clothes for herself in 
her early teens. She then 
pursued fashion in col-
lege, attending Florida State University to ma-jor in apparel design and technology.
After graduating from 
FSU, Brooks moved home to Gainesville to open her business, Jacquelyn Brooks De-signs, on University Avenue in Midtown, 
where she does both custom designs and 
tailoring and sews everything herself.
“My family was here when I got out of 
school,” she said. “Honestly, I didn’t think that I would be staying in Gainesville, but 
it kind of just ended up that way.”
With a location within walking distance 
from Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium, Brooks de-
signs a line of gameday dresses that come in diverse cuts while still staying true to orange and blue for Gator girls.“I have some styles that are geared to-
ward college students, and I have some 
that are geared toward professionals. It 
just really depends on the design because you know what one group likes, another group would like something else,” she 
said. “I kind of just design what I like and 
go from there. I don’t like to wear T-shirts to a game, and you kind of want to stand out in a crowd of 80,000, so a lot of girls really like to wear the dresses.”
Brooks doesn’t just design with the 
style of dress that her clients might like in mind. She also takes into consideration the weather in the Swamp.“I’ve designed a line so far that’s good 
to wear in hot weather,” she said. “Most of it’s knit, so it’s movable with the body. It stretches so you don’t feel constricted, 
and it’s breathable so you’re not dying in a 
100-degree stadium, but it’s still cute.”
She hopes to take her gameday line na-
tionally, creating different designs based 
on regions due to climate differences in 
different states, including long sleeves and maxi-dresses for northern schools, and maybe even branching out into separates.
“I think that’s the direction I’m going 
to go, and I can kind of launch that and take that to manufacturing doing gameday colors for every different school and have that as a base business while I expand on the stuff I really love to do, which is the couture line,” she said.
She describes her design style as “femi-
nine, classy but slightly trendy as well,” and prefers doing custom designs for her clients.  Last year, she designed a custom 
blue taffeta wedding dress that the cus-
tomer, and Brooks, loved.
“It was gorgeous, and basically she just 
gave me an inspiration — a picture to start from — and just let me run with it. She just 
loved everything I did, so that was great 
because she allowed me to be creative and (I) wasn’t stuck with a certain design,” Brooks said. “I really prefer if customers 
don’t come to me like, ‘Hey, can you copy 
this dress?,’ because for me that’s not de-signing; that’s just reproducing something somebody’s already made.”
Brooks is not just a designer, but also 
a philanthropist who founded the Run-ways and Rescues fashion show last year beneﬁ  ting Haile’s Angels Pet Rescue. This year’s event will take place on May 18 at 
the Haile Plantation Golf and Country 
Club.
To Brooks, the deﬁ  ning moment in her 
career has not been just one event, but a culmination of all the little things along 
the way.
“Last year, I got calls from ‘Fashion 
Star’ and ‘Project Runway,’ so those were 
two really amazing things that happened,” 
she said. 
“And then, you know, the charity 
fashion show, and it was my ﬁ  rst year at 
Gainesville Fashion Week, so I think all those little things kind of just keep the mo-
tivation going.”10, ALLIGATOR   THURSDAY, APRIL 5, 2012

Right-handed pitcher Karsten Whitson said he is looking forward to returning to the mound for a full 
start after missing more than a month of the season due to a strained muscle in his forearm.
�FLORIDA AND LSU BEGIN 
THREE-GAME HOME SET AT 7:30 P.M. 
BRYAN HOLT
Alligator Writer
 
It took 37 days, but Karsten 
Whitson finally appears to be done 
watching. 
The sophomore right-handed 
pitcher took the mound Tuesday 
night in Jacksonville for a one-in-
ning rehab start, ending more than one month of inactivity . 
Now he is back to being an op-
tion for No. 1 Florida (24-5, 6-3 Southeastern Conference) as it wel-comes No. 12 LSU (23-6, 6-3 SEC) into McKethan Stadium for a three-game series beginning tonight at 
7:30. Whitson’s name is being tossed 
around as a possible starter for Fri-day’s game. 
“That’s what me and (coach Kev-
in O’Sullivan) have kind of talked about,” Whitson said. “I’m definite-ly looking forward to getting back out there.”
Despite missing the majority 
of fall practice with a groin injury , Whitson entered the spring with gi-ant expectations. As a freshman, he struck out 92 batters in 97.1 innings, registering a 2.40 ERA and an 8-1 record. He was expected to slide up a spot in the rotation and serve as Florida’s Saturday starter.
His right arm wasn’t quite ready 
for the promotion. 
After “four or five” weeks of rest-
ing his groin injury , Whitson said his arm wasn’t in the shape. He got his first victory in a five-inning outing against Cal State Fullerton on Feb. 18 but didn’t look quite himself. His next start on Feb. 26 lasted 13 pitches, and Whitson was shelved 
for more than a month. 
“It’s hard when you take off the 
four or five weeks you’re supposed 
to take and you can’t just come back and assume you’re going to be 100 percent,” he said. ”It’s definitely a process and it’s been tough.” 
On Wednesday , O’Sullivan said 
Whitson had strained muscle in his 
forearm. For weeks, it had been de-
scribed as simple fatigue. The injury was one that took nothing more than time to heal. Whitson praised how protective O’Sullivan was of him, a quality the fifth-year Florida coach has become famous for. 
“It just shows why guys make 
the decision to come to Florida,” 
Whitson said. “It’s definitely com-
fortable knowing the coach has your best interests in heart rather than just trying to get you back out there and win a couple games.”
O’Sullivan said if it was up to 
Whitson, he would have been back Now healthy, Whitson primed for first full start since February

Sophomore tight end A.C. Leonard 
pled no contest Wednesday afternoon 
to a misdemeanor charge of simple do-mestic battery.
According to the Orlando Sentinel, 
Leonard appeared in front of Judge Denise R. Ferrero early Wednesday af-ternoon in the Alachua County Court-house and entered his plea of no contest to the charge stemming from a Feb. 15 arrest.
Leonard must pay $628 in fines and 
court fees, complete six months of pro-bation, continue counseling for anger 
management and open his medical 
records to the state attorney’s office. According to the report, Ferrero also ordered Leonard to not come in contact with the victim, his longtime girlfriend Nia V . Ruiz.
Leonard was arrested Feb. 15 for 
allegedly pushing Ruiz to the ground, pulling her hair and dragging her by her feet out of their apartment at the Polos 
complex on Williston Road during an al-tercation. Ruiz called police after Leonard, 20, locked her out of their apartment, where the two had been living together 
since January.
Following the ar -
rest, Florida coach Will Muschamp sus-pended Leonard indefinitely from team activities. Leonard was reinstated to practice and participate in team meet-ings on March 26, but his status for Sat-urday’s spring game is unclear.Leonard enters plea, must

The Gators traveled to Tallahassee on 
Wednesday, but Sami Fagan and Kelsey Hor -
ton went a little farther.
Fagan and Horton both homered in Flori-
da’s second trip through the order, powering 
the Gators to a six-run third inning. 
“It was big,” Horton said. “It always makes 
it easier for your pitcher to pitch when you’re 
up by five or six runs.”
Boosted by its early offensive outburst, No. 
6 Florida defeated No. 21 Florida State 9-1, im-proving its nonconference record to 20-2.
Already up 1-0 in the top of the third in-
ning, the Gators (32-4) got a leadoff single from 
Kasey Fagan followed by a bunt single from 
Michelle Moultrie.
Then, Sami Fagan sent Seminoles starting 
pitcher Monica Perry’s offering over the center-
field wall for her first career home run.
“Normally, we’d probably be in a bunt situ-
ation there,” coach Tim Walton said. “But Sami got a nice hit against Georgia the other night with two outs, a two-RBI double, so it just felt good. I felt like she could deliver with that.”
After a Lauren Haeger strikeout and a 
Cheyenne Coyle double, Horton smacked her team-leading 10th homer of the season to make it a 6-0 contest.
Aided by her long ball, Horton knocked in 
three runs against FSU (33-7), resulting in her 10th multi-RBI game of the season, a mark that leads UF.
Horton’s 3-for-4 performance at the plate 
marked her 10th multi-hit game in 2012.
“She hit a bomb [Wednesday], just got a 
hold of it,” Walton said. “(Horton) really did a good job. She went left-center, she went up the middle, she went opposite field, so she was re-
ally just spraying the ball around well.”
Florida ultimately won by the run rule 
thanks to Horton’s efforts with the bat and on 
the base paths in the fifth and sixth innings.
After hitting a one-out single in the top of 
the fifth inning, Horton took two bases on a Jess Horton, Fagan power No. 6 UF

Damico grounder because of an 
errant throw from FSU third baseman Briana Hamilton.
Horton scored the Gators’ 
eighth run when Hamilton 
mishandled a Katie Medina 
grounder with two outs.
In the sixth inning, Florida 
scored with two outs again thanks to a double off Horton’s bat, putting Florida up 9-1.
In addition to a solid night 
with the bats, UF was boosted by the efforts of starting pitcher 
Hannah Rogers (18-2).
Rogers tossed six innings for 
her fifteenth complete game, 
walking two and yielding one unearned run on four hits.
“She hits her spots really 
well every single game,” Fa-gan said. “We go against her in scrimmages and she’s tough to hit against then, so I have a lot of confidence in her. She did re-
ally good tonight.”
The nine runs UF pushed 
across on the road are its high-
est total since a 9-1 win against South Carolina on March 16. 
The nine-spot also marks 
Florida’s highest tally away from home since an 11-0 win against Illinois State during the 
season’s opening weekend.
“Coming off a tough last 
four games, I think our offense 
just felt a lot of confidence [Wednesday],” Horton said. “We just need to take that confi-dence and momentum into Ole Miss this weekend and keep on hitting.”

Saunders falling down depth chart
“As I stated last week, A.C. has 
a number of things he has to work 
through before his status for the fall is addressed,” Muschamp said in a statement released Wednesday af-
ternoon.
As a freshman, Leonard ap-
peared in nine games, hauling in 
eight catches for 99 yards.
Saunders needs improvement: 
After appearing in 12 games and starting nine as a freshman in Flor -ida’s secondary, De’Ante “Pop” Saunders wasn’t atop the depth 
chart at safety opposite Matt Elam 
when spring practice began.
Instead, Muschamp said Mon-
day, Saunders has been sharing time with Valdez Showers, Cody Riggs and Jabari Gorman, behind Elam and Josh Evans. 
Florida’s second-year coach 
added that Saunders, who recorded 
26 tackles, two interceptions and a 
forced fumble last year, needs to work on his overall consistency heading into next season. Mus-champ pointed specifically to the 
sophomore’s tackling ability as an 
area that needs improvement, add-ing that Saunders missed a couple of tackles in the secondary during the team’s scrimmage Saturday.
“(He has) got to get stronger,” 
Muschamp said. “(He has) got to get a better job finishing on some tackles. Again, you miss a tackle 
back there, it’s a big one.”

O’Sullivan: Being cautious right move
on the mound 10 days ago, but the Gators have bigger 
plans in mind than a late-March road trip. 
“Obviously we were probably more cautious than 
maybe some other people would have been, but I felt like it was the right thing to do,” O’Sullivan said. 
Nearly half a regular season and then postseason to 
remains, and Whitson is an integral part of that stretch. 
“I talked to him the whole time,” junior catcher Mike Zunino said. “I just wanted to reassure that there’s no rush. It’s a long season, and I didn’t want him to try to rush back too early because we do need him.”
If Tuesday was any indication, Whitson is ready. His 
fastball velocity was back and his slider was buzzing as he retired three batters in eight pitches. His two strike-outs were as many as he had in his first start. 
“I just had to make sure I was really comfortable,” 
Whitson said. “Definitely not 90 percent, I need to be 100 percent because that’s fair to my teammates and fair to myself.”baseball , from page 15softball ,
