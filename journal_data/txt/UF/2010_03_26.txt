Fla. tops list for
bicycle deaths
By KRISTEN BURKE "Thic StAttiC hAc A Int
Alligator Contributing Writer
Bicyclists and pedestrians
should look more than twice be-
fore crossing streets in Florida -
especially in Gainesville.
According to a recent study
by USA Today, the state had the
highest percentage of pedestrian
and cyclist deaths, 11.1 percent
and 17.4 percent respectively,
in 2008, the most recent year for
which federal statistics are avail-
able.
Gainesville had the most bicy-
cle-related accidents in the state
from 2004 to 2008, according
to Sgt. Joseph Raulerson of the
Gainesville Police Department
Traffic Safety Team.
"This statistic has a lot to do
with the sheer volume of bicy-
clists, but bike safety is still a big
issue in Gainesville," Raulersonto do with the sheer vol-
ume of bicyclists, but bike
safety is still a big issue in
Gainesville."
Sgt. Joseph Raulerson
Gainesville Police Department
Traffic Safety Team
Dakova Batey, the bicycle and
pedestrian program coordinator
for Gainesville, agrees that the
dynamic in Gainesville greatly
affects the safety for pedestrians
and cyclists because people feel
safer on campus, which has low-
speed zones and more law en-
forcement present.
"But the university creates a
high traffic level in a small area,
which can be very dangerous,"
Batey said. "There is an adjust-
ment when leaving campus-con-
trolled roads."-0ecya

0 THE STUDENT A CAPPELLA
GROUP SANG HIT SONGS.
ByCJ PRUNER
Alligator Staff Writer
Having Billy Joel, Miley Cyrus and Mi-
chael Jackson in the same room with a full
range of sound effects would usually take
studio executives and millions of dollars.
Thursday night, it only took 14 voices.
No Southern Accent, an a cappella
group of UF students, performed songs
ranging from Michael Jackson hits to
"Party in the USA" for about 145 people at
the Squitieri Studio Theatre in the Phillips
Center for the Performing Arts.
Group members relied on snaps, hums
and other sounds to carry their beat rather

in six years.
See Story, Page 15.than musical accompaniment.
The show was divided into two acts.
In the first act, members were dressed in
black and sang well-known hits such as
"Thriller." The second act was made up
of more suave songs such as John Mayer's
"Waiting on the World to Change."
For Mallory Zuckerman,

show was the culmination of much hard
work and dedication.
But she was quick to point out the joy

having the time of our lives up here," she
told the audience.

Senate divided on union
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Writer
Senators did not pass a resolution urg-
ing the creation of a Reitz Union Over-
sight Committee, which would work
with the Reitz Union Board of Manag-
ers to determine necessary repairs to the
building at a meeting Thursday.
The vote was split along party lines,
with the 23 Student Alliance party sena-
tors voting in favor of the committee
and the 59 Unite Party senators voting
against the committee.
Unite Party Sen. Ben Meyers said the
committee would be redundant because
it is the job of the Board of Managers to
address what repairs are necessary and
which ones take priority.
"This is essentially a committee on a
committee," Meyers said.

and he thinks the Senate should look into
these issues because the Board of Manag-

such as why there have never been funds
set aside for Reitz Union repairs.
"As a Senate, we have a responsibility
to look into this," Ossip
said.
Senators also dis-

However, members of the Unite Party
spoke against the resolution, saying that
a similar resolution already passed when
new senators were inducted.

An outdoor art installation
featuring seven plastic turtles
brought the issue of ocean
pollution out of its shell this
week.
The turtles, made entirely
of recycled plastic bottles,
lined the lawn on the Plaza of
the Americas from Tuesday to
Thursday.
They were brought to UF
as part of the Save My Oceans
Tour, an event designed to
help people understand the
issues associated with plastic
pollution, global warming and
overfishing.
UF is the first stop on the
turtles' 10-university tour,
which was organized as a so-
cial action campaign for Dis-

follow-up to its documentary,

The tour came to UF hoping

Gators Going Green was on
hand at the art installation to
encourage students to sign the
petition.

UF engineers discover new way to attack cancer cells
By MEREDITH RUTLAND
Alligator Contributing Writer
A UF team of particle engi-
neers has made a discovery with
explosive possibilities.
Vijay Krishna, Nathanael
Stevens, Ben Koopman and Brij
Moudgil discovered that certainmolecules burn when hit by a
low-wattage laser.
This discovery has more than
a dozen practical applications,
such as cancer treatment, explo-
sive detonation and satellite pro-
pulsion.
The paper about their research
was published in Nature Nano-technology's advance online edi-
tion on March 14.
Moudgil, director of the En-
gineering College's
On Particle Engineer-
Campus ing Research Center
where the research
took place, said the discovery
happened by accident.The team was working in Oc-
tober 2006 with molecules that
purify water, but they soon pur-
sued the new discovery.
"Finally, we saw the light, lit-
erally," Moudgil said.
Moudgil and Krishna, a post-
doctoral fellow in the Particle En-
gineering Research Center, said
the practical applications are the
most important and exciting as-
pect of the discovery.The molecules, called fuller-
enes, can attach to cancer cells.
When hit by a low-wattage la-
ser, the fullerenes heat the water
inside the cancer cells until the
cancerous cells burst, Moudgil
said.
The surrounding, healthy cells
are left unharmed, he said.
"It caused stress in the cells,
and after 10 seconds, we just see
the cells pop," Krishna said.
County investigates church
* OFFICIALS INVESTIGATED THE
CHURCH'S FURNITURE BUSINESS
FOR POSSIBLE TAX VIOLATION.

County officials investigated the Dove
World Outreach Center after receiving an
anonymous complaint the church was violat-
ing tax-exemption laws.
The anonymous tip sent to the Alachua
Country Property Appraiser claimed the
church wasn't paying taxes on part of the
building leased to TS & Company, a furniture
business run by Dove World Outreach Cen-
ter preachers Terry and Sylvia Jones.

LESSSheila Crapo, a property appraiser ad-

the church on Thursday, and the furniture
business was leasing 1,700 square feet of the
9,000-square-foot church.
Crapo said the building
could remain tax-exempt
as long as its predominate
use was for religious pur-
poses.
In a statement issued by
the church, the center said
it was operating in accor-

The investigation was not related to the

By MELINDA CARSTENSEN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Seven members of Protect Gaines-
ville's Citizens Inc. met Thursday at Wild
Iris Books to discuss their next move in
the 27-year-long battle for a cleanup of
the Cabot-Koppers Superfund site.
In early March, the environmental-
ist group applied for an Environmental
Protection Agency Technical Assistant
Grant in hopes of hiring one or more
technical advisers to assess the industrial
site on Northwest 23rd Avenue.
Kaya Ideker, 43, a member ProtectGainesville's Citizens Inc., said the site's
pollutants could eventually affect all of
Gainesville's drinking water if they seep
into the Floridian Aquifer.
Despite the potential for even more
harmful health effects, the site has been
overlooked by the EPA because local
groups "don't know how to speak their
language," said Kate Ellison, who works
at the Dragon Rises College of Oriental
Medicine located near the site.
Ellison and the other members of the
group hope communication with the
EPA will be facilitated if they receive the
$50,000 technical grant to hire advisers.

Turban Day spreads Sikh awareness
* 22 STUDENTS WORE TURBANS.
By ERIN O'DEA
Alligator Contributing Writer
rinn uea /ii"ga"r
Hardeep Saluja, a chemistry major, wraps a turban around Diana More-
no's head on Turlington Plaza on Thursday afternoon.A UF student organization unwrapped
the religion of Sikhism on Turlington Plaza
Thursday afternoon.
The Sikh Student Association wove col-
orful strips of cotton around the heads of 22
participants in honor of Turban Day, UF's
first Sikhism awareness day.
In Sikhism, a monotheistic religion that
originated in India and has more than 23
million followers worldwide, the turban is
used as a badge of identity, said Hardeep
Saluja, a Sikh Student Association member
who wears a turban.
Saluja helped the organization wrap
turbans for the entirety of the event, which
lasted from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. He was there
with other members of the association to dis-
courage stereotypes associated with turban
wearers and to inform the public about the
religion.
Students who participated agreed to
wear the turban for an hour. They signed a
contract saying they wouldn't cut their hair
while they wore the turban and would not
consume or handle alcohol, drugs or tobac-
co.
Students received a $15 gift certificate to
either Target or Starbucks for wearing the
turban.
UF freshman Jose Ceballos wore a red
turban.
"It's a lot different than what I thought
it was going to be like. It's warm," Ceballos
said.
Saluja, who also wore a red turban, said
Sikhism is the fifth-largest religion in the
world and has its own identity involving
a combination of strength and devotion to
God, he said.

6, ALLIGATOR U FRIDAY, MARCH 26, 2010
We're not sure about you, but it's been quite an event-
ful week here at the Alligator.
We've covered everything from a belligerent Student
Body president and angry, whiny Republicans to a diva-
esque "Saturday Night Live" comedian refusing to have
his picture taken and Gainesville's resident-crazies selling
furniture out of their so-called "church."
And as much as you hate to admit it, we know you
wouldn't go anywhere else for your weekly wrap-up. So
look out and get ready to be angered because here comes
this week's would-you-really-expect-anything-less-of-us
edition of.
Darts & Laurels
Because these things practically write themselves.
Speaking of stories practically writing themselves, the
Alligator was excited to hear that it'll soon have another
competitor.
Members of the Greek community, our biggest and
most loving fan base, have taken it upon themselves to
start Greek Weekly.
According to an e-mail sent out to students in UF's
journalism college, Greek Weekly will focus on event cov-
erage, sporting events and profiles of "the best and most
driven members of the school."
And we couldn't be more excited.
That's why we're going to throw a finally-there-will-
be-an-unbiased-group-out-there-to-cover-UF's-brightest-
gems LAUREL to the editors of Greek Weekly.
God knows they never get any fair coverage in this rag
-we only care about them when they're off getting DUI's,
hazing freshmen, making parodies of "I'm on a Boat" and
taunting SNAP drivers.
That's right, Student Body President Jordan Johnson,
unlike the University Police Department, we know who
you are (and we didn't have to Google you, either).
For those of you unaware, Johnson had a run-in with
the law after SNAP refused to take him to his off-campus
apartment Saturday morning.
He, naturally, responded by threatening to pull the
agency's funding.
Luckily, members of UPD were able to take a break
from writing speeding tickets long enough to check out
the situation.
When they got there, an officer asked Johnson to iden-
tify himself. Johnson replied, "You know who I am."
So we're mustering up all our anger and astonishment
and throwing a how-dare-you-not-know-he's-the-Student-
Body-president DART at the UPD.
And while we're on the subject of being offended, we
were personally offended when our photographer was
stonewalled from the Andy Samberg event.
We fork over our parents' hard-earned money so Ac-
cent can bring us the truly inspiring, enlightening speak-
ers we all know and love.
It's bad enough that the average student was forced to
sneak cell phone photos, but to deny the Alligator is just
outrageous.
Seriously. Doesn't he know who we are? Then again,
maybe he was just afraid that having his photo in the paper
would inspire the same response as the girls in his "Jizz in
my Pants" video. Either way, we're lobbing a you're-not-
that-important DART at Andy Samberg.
That's all for this week. We look forward to the slew
of nasty letters from the bright ones whom our sarcasm
escapes. Go forth and complain.

Band's evolution reflects columnist's
usic is a very important tool to measure whatkind of mood you are in over an extended peri-
od of time. It can be difficult when your favorite
band seems to betray all of its previous values in pursuit
of a more mainstream sound, making it more aesthetically
pleasing to the masses.
I'll admit it. I'm a music elitist. My favorite band is a local
Gainesville-based band Against Me!. I've been following it
and going to its concerts for years now, and while the con-
certs haven't lost their edge, the albums seem to have tapered
off into Green Day-esque mainstream pop-punk.
When the new Against Me! album, "White Crosses,"
leaked last week, I immediately downloaded and listened
to it. Looking at the names of the songs presented a dras-
tic change from its previous efforts. "We're Breaking Up"?
Really, guys? This, from the same band who came out with
"Baby, I'm an Anarchist," "Pints of Guinness Make You
Strong," and "From Her Lips to God's Ears," a politically
charged piece about Condoleezza Rice. It was nice to see an
acoustic song on the new record, though, something that
was missing from the extremely overproduced New Wave
album. But, "Ache With Me" represents yet another change
from anger to a sappy ballad about feeling bad for yourself.
However, after a few listens to the album, I realized I was
into it, and I really didn't want to be. I want to be able to have
my release, my escape, in Against Me!. I go to the concerts
and scream my lungs out to a terrific show, and then it's back
to everyday life. I grab my guitar and cover their songs. I'm
even in a band with my best friend, and we play acoustic
covers of, almost exclusively, Against Me! songs.
The reason why I'm so into it is because it represents me,
as I am now. In high school, when I would listen to their anar-
chistic songs about the evils of our government, I completely
agreed with them. I was the guy spouting off about how ter-
rible both sides of politics were, and how it's not even worth
it to vote because a 2000 election will always happen; and thePaul Murty
letters@ali gator orgperson who the powerful elite want to
be president will always win.
I recently got involved in politics.
And while I still despise many aspects
of the government, I see it as a neces-
sary evil. And that is the main con-
nection I can feel with the band right
now. We're both growing into the
same kind of mature understandings
of how the world works.
Sure, Against Me! and I will always have some aspects
of left-wing politics in common. The title track from its new
album is about seeing an abortion memorial in a church lawn
in St. Augustine and wanting to smash every white cross the
church put up to represent each aborted fetus. I can under-
stand where Tom Gabel was coming from when he wrote it,
but I also realize there are so many more important things to
provide social commentaries for in the world today.
I also feel a connection to "I Was a Teenage Anarchist" be-
cause, although I was never "ready to set the world on fire,"
I definitely remember the days when I was a big part of the
counterculture. Being surrounded by ultra-conservative rich
people in Catholic school provided a very easy opportunity
to be a part of the counterculture, as I was raised by my fam-
ily, who has very different views and values from those of
my former classmates.
What I take from the album at the end is from the song
"Bamboo Bones." "Push back with every word and every
breath. What God doesn't give to you, you've got to go and
get for yourself." I was recently considering giving up this
column, but the album makes me realize that I don't want to.
I enjoy writing for all of you. And even though many of you
hate what I have to say, I should still do what I want to do.
And that is why music is important. You can learn from it,
grow from it and gain a deeper understanding of yourself.

Letters to the Editor
Health care is only start of much
greater war for the United States
In the days following the signing of
the crown-jewel of Democratic domestic
policy, the Alligator's Editorial Board, its
gallery of columnists and other esteemed
members of the media have been touting
victory for the president in the 100 Years
War for universal health care in the United
States.
As a matter of convention, a war must
have at least two belligerents.
Who then, is to bear the standard of the
defeated?
One would be quick to suggest the Re-
publicans -remember that they hold an in-
consequential minority in the federal gov-
ernment. It then becomes clear.
The only other group that has offered
any sort of substantial opposition toward
congressional Democrats has been the
American people, as witnessed in the halls
of Congress, the streets of Washington and
congressional inboxes.
Though Democrats are quick to raise
their flag over "we the people," I offer this:
Health care was not the war but only a sin-
gle battle in the greater war for America.
And in the war for the preservation of
the United States, her people will win the
day.
No army whose foot soldiers comprisescores of distant politicians -each scram-
bling for the scraps from their commander
in chief's table -will be able to resist their
collective voice.
Obama continues to express his desire
to fundamentally transform America, but
Americans do not elect leaders to alter their
country.
They are elected as stewards, charged
with the singular task of securing the bless-
ings of liberty for ourselves and our poster-
ity.
To suggest otherwise invites despotism.

New bill will give enormous power to
American federal government
Mr. Will Penman,
Regardless of my political affiliation or
background, I would like to question you
on many of your assumptions about the
newly passed health care laws in our coun-
try.
You compare us conservatives to being
little kids who are afraid of the dark and,
according to you, afraid of social conse-
quences. I would like to know how much
you really know about this new health carelaw.
Perhaps the most common misconcep-
tion among uneducated and misinformed
liberals (unlike yourself, I'm sure) is that
the new law will provide access to health
care for all.
While the law is not as radical as many
European systems, as you pointed out,
its purely unconstitutional provisions are
nevertheless a legitimate source of "fear"
for us freedom-loving, liberty-craving con-
servatives.
Beginning in 2014, every single Ameri-
can will be required by law to hold a health
insurance policy.
These policies are not all going to be
government-provided; in fact, while the
umbrella for Medicaid-eligible Americans
will be expanded, the majority of Ameri-
cans will be paying for such policies out of
pocket.
If they fail to cover themselves and all
of their dependents, the Internal Revenue
Service has been expanded by this new law
to enforce the law on a monthly basis, col-
lecting ridiculous fines for those who are
not covered.
Talk about Big Brother.
For the first time in our nation's his-
tory, it will actually be required by law for
Americans to pay a fine to the government
for not doing something.FRIDAY, MARCH 26, 2010 U ALLIGATOR, 7
According to the 10th Amendment of
the Constitution, more commonly referred
to as the Commerce Clause, this is inevita-
bly unconstitutional.
It is for this exact reason that 14 state at-
torneys general have already filed lawsuits
against the feds.
I can step back from my partisanship
and say that there are many benefits in-
cluded in the law.
It has been long overdue to prohibit in-
surance companies from dropping or de-
clining coverage to sick American citizens.
It is also necessary that college students
be allowed to stay on their parents' policy
for a few more years because we all know
that graduation isn't always followed by
immediate success, and sometimes we need
a few years to get on our feet after college.
However, I think I can speak for all con-
servatives and many Americans when I say
that the "fear" you speak of is not without
reason.
It may be disguised as a simple moral
issue that every American has the right to
good health care, but this law means so
much more than that.
The health care reform law represents
an entirely new level of power for the fed-
eral government.

%o:Breath of Fresh Ar 3
By TOM GREEN
Alligator Writer
It was mid-February, and No. 4 Florida
was hosting then-No. 7 Georgia, the five-
time defending national champions.
The Gators hadn't beaten the Bulldogs in
Gainesville since 1990, and if that streak was
to end, it was going to come down to the per-
formance of a freshman.
Georgia had finished its last routine of
the night and led 197.150-187.325 with just
a floor exercise from Ashan6e Dickerson re-
maining for Florida.
Dickerson needed a 9.85 or better for the
Gators to win, and as she finished her rou-
tine, the crowd eagerly awaited the judges'
scores.
After a brief wait, her score was an-
nounced: 9.925.
The final tally read 197.250-197.150, and
the crowd of 6,421 in the O'Connell Center
erupted.
That performance was a lot to ask of a
freshman in a high-pressure situation, but
Dickerson and her classmates -the nation's
No. 1 recruiting class -are no ordinary
freshmen.
"Once we got everyone in and got a few
meets under our belt, we could really, as a
coaching staff, start to see the potential for
this class, and just how solid and aggressive
and confident they were," Faehn said.
Solid? The freshman class has accounted
for 122 of the team's 240 competitive routines
in meets this season, just more than 50 per-
cent of the Gators' performances.
Aggressive? Not only are the freshmen
filling the slots in the lineup, they're earning
them by competing at a high level. Thirty of
Florida's 52 individual event titles this sea-
son have been won by freshmen, including a
whopping 18 from Dickerson.
Confident? That's the one that really
shows during competitions.
Dali Lemezan, who walked on to the
team, has led off for the Gators on vault all
season and set the pace for the meets, espe-
cially at home, where vault is the team's first
rotation.
"Everyone tells me I set the tone, but I
didn't realize it until people asked me about
it," Lemezan said. "It's great to know every-
one has the same confidence in me that I have
in myself to be able to be put in that position
going first on vault."
But those characteristics, according to
Faehn, aren't the most unique thing about
her freshmen. It's their willingness to get on
the same page.
"Everyone wants to win," Faehn said.
"And in the past, everyone wanted to win,
but not every single one was willing to make
all the sacrifices to make that happen. We feel
that with the team this year, they are all on
the same page, and they are all individually
willing to make all the sacrifices and all the
things they need to do inside and outsideof the gym to put forth their best effort and
win a Southeastern Conference and National
Championship."
That willingness is a sentiment echoed by
all of the freshmen.
One of the things that has contributed to
the freshmen jelling has been their relation-
ship outside the gym.
"We all have our own personalities that
we bring to the group, so I feel like we all
click really well and we all get along so
great," Liz Green said. "We all just have dif-
ferent styles that come together to make a
great combination."
That mixture is a result of the gymnasts
hailing from different areas.Dickerson, from Jacksonville, dreamed
of being a Florida gymnast for most of her
life. She's the shy one of the group, but she's
also the fiercest competitor in meets, having
been named SEC Freshman of the Week four
times and SEC Gymnast of the Week for her
performance against Georgia.
Marissa King, another solid all-around
competitor, is the confident and experienced
member of the class who Faehn describes as
the most outspoken and vivacious.
She hails from England, where she was
an Olympian and competed in the Artistic
Gymnastics World Championships last Oc-
tober.
She has earned the last two SEC Freshman
Ana Goni-Lessan / Alligator Staff
Marissa King, left, and Ashan6e Dickerson wave to the crowd after winning first and
second in the all-around competition at the Gators' meet against Georgia on Feb. 19.of the Week honors, and three overall.
Green, a 17-year-old Texas native who
Faehn describes as a "cherub," is recognized
as one of the team's best beam workers de-
spite being the youngest.
She has earned four beam titles, including
three in a row.
Randy Stageberg is from Virginia and
came in as the most coveted prospect of the
class after three years on the U.S. National
Team. But after injuring her shoulder in No-
vember 2008, she has been working to get
back to the level she was before college.
All four of those gymnasts are capable
of performing in the all-around, and Faehn
expects them all to do so in their careers at
Florida.
Then there's Lemezan, the walk-on vault
specialist from St. Petersburg who was born
in Bosnia.
Faehn describes her as one of the most
positive-thinking members of the class.
"For her to walk on, make the lineup and
then to excel at that position, to be the lead-
off where we expect a great stuck vault every
time, she's done that," Faehn said. "She's de-
livered that week in and week out, just very
consistent, and she's done it with a great big
smile on her face."
That meltingpot of talentandpersonalities
has panned out well for the Gators in meets
this season, as they are ranked fourth in the
nation and in the top 10 in every event.
Even though they've had this much suc-
cess as freshmen, it hasn't gone to their
heads, and they still look up to the upper-
classmen who have helped them along the
way this year.
"The seniors have been a massive impact
on the freshmen," King said. "I know when
I came out here, I didn't know what to ex-
pect or what to do, so we looked up to the
seniors a lot coming into this. We've looked
upon them very highly and we've gained a
lot of knowledge and experience from them.
We hope that will continue to grow and we'll
learn a lot more with ourselves, as well as
having them there to support us."
Along with support from their team-
mates, the way the freshmen have meshed
and performed has brought in high praise
from Faehn, who compared them to her 2004
recruiting class that included Savannah Ev-
ans, Samantha Lutz, Chantelle Tousek, Katie
Rue and Breanne King, all of whom earned
All-America honors as freshmen.
"This freshman class, there is no limit,"
said Faehn, reverberating an opinion shared
by all five of the freshmen. "They're so tal-
ented, and they have so much potential that
they all could be All-Americans up on the
wall. They could be multiple time All-Amer-
icans. We told Ashane6 and Marissa they
have the potential to be an NCAA all-around
champion, as well, and an individual event
finalist. So there's just a lot of, a lot of poten-
tial. I can't wait to have them for three more
years.
Gators look for statement win against Ohio State
0 OSU WILL BE UF'S SEC-
OND CONFERENCE GAME.
By TONI-ANN MILLER
Alligator Writer
Defense has led the Gators (6-3,
0-1 American Lacrosse Conference)
to wins in their last three games,
but they will have a tall order to fill
when they visit Ohio State (5-3) on
Saturday in their second conference
game.
UF has not had success on theroad, especially against top-ranked
opponents -they fell 18-5 to No.
4 North Carolina and 16-8 to ALC
leader Johns Hopkins earlier in the
season.
The matchup in Columbus,
Ohio, will be a similar challenge for
the Gators because the Buckeyes'
three losses were close and came
against ranked opponents -No.20
William and Mary, No. 15 Stanford,
and five-time defending champions
No. 1 Northwestern.
UF coach Amanda O'Leary is
looking forward to the chance forher first-year program to prove it
belongs in the ALC.
"I think Ohio State has some-
thing coming to them," O'Leary
said. "We're really excited."
O'Leary said
shutting down
OSU's attackers
will be the key toLacrosse the match, a chal-
lenge goalkeeper
Cara Canington is ready for.
"This energy that we've had for
the past three games, we just want
to keep it up going into the con-ference and just get a win at Ohio
State," she said. "The most impor-
tant thing is just competing."
Statistics from the last three
games show that when Florida's
defense is on point, the offense
plays better too.
UF gave up just 11 goals in those
games, and the offense scored 47.
In the previous two games, both
losses, the Gators were outscored
29-19.
Midfielder Kitty Cullen said the
last three games, albeit against un-
ranked teams, were a good confi-dence booster for UF heading into
Ohio State.
"We're feeling pretty strong,"
Cullen said. "We know that we've
been playing well together, (and) if
we keep playing the same way, we
can hopefully win on Saturday."
Cullen said having already lost a
conference match, her team knows
what to do to avoid falling to 0-2.
"Now we know what we are upagainst, and we know that this is a
must win game, so we have to go
out there and give it our all," she
said.

Brombacher tosses perfect game in win over USF
U PERFECT GAME IS UF'S FOURTH EVER AND
ITS FIRST IN SIX YEARS.
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Writer
After having the worst performance of her pitching
career in their first meeting, Gators ace Stephanie Bro-
mbacher had without question her best Thursday night,
throwing a perfect game in a victory over USF.
.0@00,The junior needed only 56 pitches to retire all 15 USF
4_ -batters in order as No. 6 Florida (21-3, 4-1 Southeastern
Conference) earned a 10-0 win against the Bulls in a mer-
Zf- cy-rule-shortened five-inning game.
"I just went out there and I made my pitches, and I
hit good spots and obviously didn't make too many mis-
- * takes," Brombacher said.
Brombacher's perfect game was the fourth in UF his-
tory and the first since Jenny Gladding -now a UF as-
sistant coach -threw one on Feb. 7, 2004.
"It was really exciting," senior Francesca Enea said.
"I'm so happy for Steph. She deserves it."
While Brombacher struck out batters, she was also aid-
ed by a pair of notable defensive efforts.
In only her second start in left field this season, sopho-

Florida heads to Ole Miss

Alex Panteliodis' pitches died, and the
stats lied.
Florida's Friday-night starter hung
throws high in the strike zone last week
against Mississippi State, but good UF de-
fense bailed him out, and only five hitters
reached base.
"I've got to give it to my defense," Pan-
teliodis said after the game, a 7-2 win. "They
helped me out a lot."
Even if the sophomore struggles again
tonight at 7:30 when No. 2 Florida (17-3, 3-0
Southeastern Conference) travels to No. 17
Mississippi (17-5, 2-1 SEC), the seven play-
ers behind him are disciplined enough to
protect their pitcher.
Panteliodis' line last week (7.1 innings,
four hits, two runs) was on par with the
numbers he posted in his first four wins thisyear. But his strikeout rate was cut by more
than half, and most of the outs he recorded
came on fly balls and line drives.
Left fielder Tyler Thompson saved two
extra-base hits, including a home run, with
leaping catches in the third and fifth innings
-the type of catches UF
outfielders hope for the
chance to make.
"I enjoy when I'm out
there getting fly balls,"
center fielder Matt den
Dekker said. "We tell the
pitchers,'Get us work out
Panteliodis there and we'll run them
down for you guys."'
Through 20 games, the Gators' position
players have been more effective than in
2009. The team has committed 13 errors, al-
most half as many as at this point last year.
Florida also has 12 error-free games, in-

It won't exactly be a home meet for
No. 4 Florida, but it will be a homecom-
ing for freshman Ashan6e Dickerson
when the Gators travel to Jacksonville
for the 2010 Southeastern Conference
Championships.
Dickerson, a Jacksonville native,
leads the team with 18 individual event
titles this season and will try to help UF
(9-2, 5-1 SEC) win its first conference
title since 2007.
Dickerson said her family and friends
have been ordering tickets for the SEC
Championships since August. She said
her mom, Pattie Daise Dickerson, even
made fliers to hand out to support theteam, and she expects a personal cheer-
ing section of more than 200 people to
support her and the rest of the Gators.
"It's going to be exciting, not only
for Ashan6e to be back home, but for
the whole team because it's in Florida
and very close," UF
coach Rhonda Faehn
said.

Fontana leads improved defense
BASEBALL, from page 15
eluding three-straight perfect fielding perfor-
mances last weekend. But while the product on
the field has improved, the coaching and prac-
tice drills have stayed the same.
"We're not doing anything differently this
year than the first two years," said coach Kevin
O'Sullivan, who took over the Gators in 2008.
O'Sullivan said UF's drills are simple: field
ball after ball after ball. Assistant coach Brad
Weitzel hit between 200 and 300 ground balls
every day to freshman shortstop Nolan Fontana
before the season began.
Most of UF's recruits come in preoccupied
with the long ball, O'Sullivan said. He does not
know why players are undisciplined before
college, but their fielding improves when they
come to Gainesville. For the first time in many
players' lives, they spend as much time in the
field as the batting cage.
"This generation, as a whole, everybody
wants to hit," O'Sullivan said. "You go to the
field, and they hit. You ask a young player whathe wants to work on, and they want to hit."
Fontana is the rare exception. Hitting .343,
his offense is a pleasant surprise for the Gators
because he was recruited for his defense.
In 56 chances, Fontana has yet to commit an
error. Mike Mooney, last year's shortstop, made
an error about once in every nine chances.
"A lot of the bigger guys get caught
up in the hype of hitting the long
ball, trying to impress scouts with
their power."
Nolan Fontana
UF freshman shortstop
Fontana said most high school players focus
on hitting balls as far as they can. But at 5-foot-
11, he never had that option because he wasn't
strong enough to drive balls out of the park.
"A lot of the bigger guys get caught up in the
hype of hitting the long ball, trying to impress
scouts with their power," he said. "That's not re-
ally me. I'm kind of the hard-nosed player."UF will face four other top-10 teams

Arena.
A pro-UF crowd could help the
Gators' chances at taking home their
seventh SEC title, especially with
the meet's format of having a gym-
nast on each apparatus at any given
time.
But if the team hopes to come
away with the title, it will need more
than just a friendly crowd.
The SEC Championships will
showcase five of the nation's top-
10 teams, including defending SEC
champion and No. 1 Alabama -
which dealt Florida its only loss in
conference play -as well as five-
time defending national championGeorgia.
All seven SEC schools are ranked
in the top 25 nationally, so the pres-
sure will be on in Jacksonville.
While Florida's freshman class
has shined throughout the season,
Faehn hopes to be able to turn to
her experienced upperclassmen who
have been there before to set the ex-
ample for the rest of the team and
give them advice on the champion-
ship stage.
"I feel comfortable and I feel con-
fident with our freshman, because
they've had the experience so far this
year in difficult situations," Faehn
said. "That being said, it still takes
the whole group, and they will look
to our upperclassmen to see how
they respond."
