Students save
by renting books
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Writer
Students may be able to save some cash in coming se-
mesters with textbook rental programs offering an alterna-
tive to buying books.
The Florida Book Store revised its textbook rental pro-
gram this semester after experimenting with similar pro-
grams in previous years.
"I like that it was a lot cheaper, but I'm kind of
sad that I won't be able to sell it back and get
money back at the end of the semester."

Florida Book Store textbook department manager Mike
Bibbee said the store rents out about 10,000 books, or 25 per-
cent of its titles.
The store sends an e-mail reminder when the books are
due and charges the full price of the books if they are not
returned, he said.
Bibbee said the Florida Book Store rents the books out to
students until the last day of finals week.
He also said the program has some drawbacks.
Students cannot sell back the rented books and risk pay-
ing penalty fees, Bibbee said.

Young artists to display
their work
Some of Alachua County's
youngest artists will have a chance
to showcase their work at the up-
coming Alachua County Elemen-
tary Art Exhibition beginning Sat-
urday. Erin Friedberg, Gainesville
visual arts coordinator, said the
exhibition is designed to highlight
the creativity and talent of its el-
ementary school contributors.
A total of 87 pieces of artwork
were chosen by 26 participating
schools.
"It is just an extreme thrill for
[the students] to be featured at theThomas Center, like the high-
est art award that they could
receive," said Kristy Foster,
Idylwild Elementary School art
teacher.
The return of the event marks
a highlight for Idylwild Elemen-
tary School, where cutbacks did
not allow the school to partici-
pate last year, according to prin-
cipal Barbara Henry.
The annual exhibition will be
on display in the Thomas Cen-
ter Mezzanine Gallery from Sat-
urday to Jan. 31.

Students face shortage
of cold-weather gear
By ERICA JOHNSON
Alligator Writer
No hats, no heaters, no problem -until the
weather dips below freezing.
During a week of record low temperatures,
students seeking winter merchandise were
greeted by empty shelves.
Michelle Hart, a UF chemical engineering
sophomore, was one of the many glove-seek-
ers who had no luck at Wal-Mart, Target or
Ross Tuesday and Wednesday.
"I called Wal-Mart, and they said a new
shipment had come in but that, like, 20 people
had bought them in the last few minutes,"
Hart said. "By the time I got there, they were
gone, so I had to keep looking."
After repeated failures, she had success atKohl's on Archer Road.
Jennifer Lee, a UF political science sopho-
more, also had a difficult time finding gloves,
ending her search after repeated failure at
Forever 21, Express and Macy's in The Oaks
Mall.
Donna Spiers, a zone merchandise supervi-
sor at the Wal-Mart in Butler Plaza, said gloves
are not the only hot commod-
Local ity. Hats and heaters have also
News been disappearing from store
shelves.
Spiers said about 150 pairs of gloves have
been put out and sold each day, and hats and
heaters completely sold out Tuesday and
Wednesday.
"The heaters are selling as fast as we can get
them into the store right now," she said.NATIONAL
Beef: it's not for dinner
By MORGAN WATKINS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Hamburgers using beef courtesy of
Beef Products Inc. may come with pick-
les, onions, ketchup and a side of am-
monia.
The company, which supplies beef
to the federal school lunch program and
fast food chains like McDonald's, has
been using an ammonia treatment to
reduce levels of E. coli and salmonella
in its processed beef.
Chad Carr, assistant professor in the
UF department of animal sciences, said
while the use of these trimmings has
raised concern, the practice is safe.
He described ammonia as an anti-
microbial that can help alleviate the
problems of E. coli and salmonella con-
tamination in beef.
"I have all the confidence in the
world that the beef industry is trying
its best to have as safe a product as pos-
sible," Carr said. "The number one pri-ority is safety."
Beef Products Inc. reduced the levels
of ammonia to combat concern, but this
can diminish the treatment's ability to
fight pathogens.
John Gonzalez, a postdoctoral as-
sociate in the UF department of animal
sciences who previously worked in the
meat industry, said
there is no definite
way to eliminate E.
coli and salmonella
as a potential hazard.
Gonzalez said
that while the meat
industry's methods
Carr may not always work
perfectly, he expects
to see more changes in the future to de-
velop safer methods of fighting patho-
gens in beef.
"One of the things I never realized
until I got into the industry was that
you get inspected left and right, not
only by the government but by your
customers," Gonzalez said.
Audiences to gather in the O'Connell Center for horseplay

A different breed of athletes will perform
today at the O'Connell Center.
The World Famous Lipizzaner Stallions
will showcase their array of ancient maneu-vers at 3 p.m. and 7:30 p.m.
Tickets cost about $20 and can be pur-
chased at the University Box Office.
Michael Lashinsky, the marketing director
for White Stallions Production Inc., said the
Lipizzan was once the horse of nobility and
aristocracy.The Lipizzaner stallions perform stunts
once used in warfare.
Their "airs above the ground" maneuvers
involves a series of leaps and jumps originat-
ing on the battlefield, he said.
"Only stallions of the greatest strength, tal-
ent and athletic ability are chosen for trainingin these ancient maneuvers," Lashinsky said.
He said this year marks the tour's 40th an-
niversary.
Katie Profeta, a UF animal science junior, is
excited to see the stallions.
She said she has already seen the stallions
perform.
"Even if you have no interest in horses, it's
a very artistic show and interesting to watch,"
Profeta said.

DiStaola: UF Bookstores may have a rental program in the fall of 2010
TEXTBOOKS, from page 1
Junior Hayley Snedeker rented a textbook
for the first time from the Florida Book Store
this semester. She rented a $96 textbook for
$48.
"I like that it was a lot cheaper, but I'm
kind of sad that I won't be able to sell it back
and get money back at the end of the semes-
ter," Snedeker said.Other local bookstores are also consider-
ing the implementation of textbook rental
programs.
Elio DiStaola, the director of campus re-
lations for Follett Higher Education Group,
said UF Bookstores may have a rental pro-
gram in fall 2010.
Follett tested a textbook rental program
in seven universities across the country last
semester, including Florida State Universityand the University of North Florida, DiS-
taola said.
During that semester, the program al-
lowed students in those sevenLocal schools to save close to $2 mil-News lion, he said.
"It works great for students
who want up-front savings," DiStaola said.
Lynne Vaughan, director of UF Book-
stores, said she thinks a rental programcould be successful because it gives students
another option besides buying new or used
books.
Vaughan said students will save mon-
ey as long as they remember to return the
books.
Doby Gray, owner of Gator Textbooks
located on 3501 SW 2nd Ave., said he hopes
his store will have a rental program by this

Missionary completes journey
Available from Commercial News Providers
.w .0 JAMES TATE HAS BAPTIZED 23 PEOPLE
INTO THE MORMON CHURCH.
Editors' note: This is the final installment in a
four-part series. For the first three parts of the
series and additional details, see alligator.org.
By CJ PRUNER
Alligator Writer
A Soul Renewed
A faint rumble of excitement begins to build as
a herd of worshippers head toward the room at
the end of the hallway. James Tate and Marques
Schroeder, two Mormon missionaries stationed at
the UF campus, walk among them.
At first glance, the room offers nothing but blue
carpet and wooden doors. But behind the two
wooden doors, a large pool of water lies.
In a few minutes, Brandon Feldman, a UF aero-
space and mechanical engineering junior, will
wade into the water. After a few words of devotion
are spoken, he will be completely submerged.
When he rises out of the water, he will be the
newest member of The Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints.
For Tate, this will be his first baptism in
Gainesville, his 23rd overall.
Although this won't be first go-around, he can't
help but let the happiness of the occasion over-
come him.
"This feels like when you have something real-
ly amazing, and you get to share it with a friend,"
he said.
For Feldman, the road to the baptism has been
a long one. Raised in a Jewish household, Feld-
man wasn't the most religious teenager growing
up. However, he couldn't shake the growing voidhe felt inside.
Driven by a desire for something more, he be-
came a religious free agent, trying out different
denominations of Christianity, such as Baptist,
Lutheran, Presbyterian and Catholic.
Despite his list of options, Feldman felt empty.
That was when his friend, Alan, told him to try
out this new church that he had been visiting.
Skeptical at first, Feldman couldn't help but feel a
welcome when he visited the Mormon service.
"Everyone was so nice, it felt like home," he
said.
Eventually, he came in contact with Schroeder
and Tate.
"Whenever I would have doubts or questions, I
could call them up, and they were more than will-

ing to sit down and talk to me," he said. "They
took care of me."
For Feldman, the greatest lesson the missionar-
ies taught was compassion.
"In today's world, so many things are going
down the toilet. It sucks," he said. "They are an
example of what one should be like."
For the few seconds that Feldman is under wa-
ter, only the clicks of the clock can be heard. Be-
fore the swoosh of the waves can fully develop, a
flash of excitement overtakes the room as cheers
and applause erupt among the congregation.
Schroeder and Tate, each standing by one of the
wooden doors, break into beaming smiles.
From the waters, a saint has risen.

Student Body president vows to play more basketball
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Writer
UF leaders are kicking off their new year
with new resolutions.
Vice President for Student Affairs Patricia
Telles-Irvin said she plans to spend more time
with her family.
"I tend to stay here till around 6:30 p.m.,sometimes 7 p.m.," Telles-Irvin said. "I've de-
cided that it's time to have more dinners with
my son and my husband."
One of UF spokesman Steve Orlando's
resolutions includes doing more mountain
biking.
Orlando said he also hopes to boost the na-
tional media coverage of UF.
"Ultimately, I'd love to see a 1-A featurestory in The New York Times about the Uni-
versity of Florida," Orlando said.

U F President Jordan
Administration Johnson plans to
focus more on his
physical fitness.
"Over the course of my tenure as Student
Body president, I think that is one of the bal-ances in my life that I've neglected to keep up
with as much as I would like," he said.
He plans to play more basketball, which is
his favorite sport.
However, Johnson has more than just per-
sonal goals.
He also cited changes to Bright Futures and
a potential renewable energy fee that he plans
to deal with in 2010.

Welcome back to a new semester, a new decade and a
new onslaught of laughs, tears and things that'll just plain
piss you off brought to you by yours truly.
We do hope you rested plenty over the break and the
first week of classes wasn't too hard on you because the
lack of letters to the editor are really killing us. However,
we're going to let it slip just for today in order to bring
you the your-first-week-of-school-didn't-suck-as-much-as-
our-7:30-editing-labs edition of.
Darts & Laurels
And we're not the only ones willing to forgive and for-
get.
The Progress Party and the Orange and Blue Party an-
nounced Wednesday they have officially made amends
and decided to get back together. Party officials said rea-
sons behind the merger include wanting to give students
more of a voice and increasing transparency in Student
Government.
That's why we're giving a you-all-may-have-more-
drama-than-a-middle-school-relationship-but-we're-hap-
py-to-see-you-worked-things-out LAUREL to UF's indie
parties.
But love isn't the only thing in the air this week.
Along with the brisk winter cold comes the fear of be-
ing shocked, and we at the Alligator can't touch our cars,
desks or even one of our copy editors' girlfriend's fore-
head without fearing the wrath of static electricity. That's
why we have to throw a if-you-would-have-just-given-us-
snow-the-zaps-would-be-totally-worth-it DART at moth-
er nature.
And while we're complaining about nature, here, the
Editorial Board is flinging a couldn't-you-have-thrown-
us-a-bone-here DART at The Sunshine State (to be read
as whiningly as possible, please).
Shame on you, Florida, for getting our hopes up just
to snatch them cruelly away. For those of us who have to
brave the tundra to get to our first-period classes as our
frigid fingers threaten to break off of our mittenless hands
(thanks, glove shortage), the least you could do is toss
down a few flurries so we could take "OMG look at the
snow!" photos for our Facebook profiles.
But we're not the only ones complaining. According to
the latest Gallup poll, Obama's approval rating is at a mea-
ger 47 percent. Now, we understand that you expected
missiles and poverty to turn into rainbows and butterflies
the moment he was sworn in, but we're putting you all
in time out and pinning a now-think-about-what-you've-
done DART at 53 percent of the American public for giv-
ing up on our president so soon.
Whether or not he turns out to be more of a pain in our
asses than cheap tissues when you have a runny nose, it's
too soon to lose hope.
And because we're such left-leaning liberal lovers,
we're delivering -on a silver platter, of course -a we-
don't-care-what's-going-on-down-there LAUREL to Pres-
ident Barack Obama for making the first U.S. presidential
appointment of a transgender.
The White House displayed tactful reticence in declin-
ing to comment on her gender, and the Editorial Board
thinks everyone should do the same and ignore those who
seem to think it's important.
That's all for this week, folks, and if you don't like what
we said, stop by our open house today and prove you'd
be an asset to the Editorial Board (or just a write a letter.
please).

Obama faces tough
can't help but wonder why President Obama has received
so much more heat from certain members of the media
and from certain factions of the country than any public
figure I can remember. The recent attempted bombing by a
Nigerian terrorist has prompted those members of the media
to come out from the woodwork to -yet again -criticize
Obama. This time it is because he took 72 hours to publicly
respond to the situation, after consulting with security teams
from Christmas until Dec. 28.
Jon Stewart made a good point on the Jan. 6 episode of his
show -that those certain members of the media didn't say
anything when a similar situation happened in 2001. Former
President George W. Bush took not 72 hours but six days to
publicly respond to the infamous shoe bombing attempt by
Richard Reid. Even then, he didn't call a press conference to
talk about the issue as Obama did. So why is Obama being
criticized and almost blamed for the security issues on the
flight that led to the attempted attack?
Let's review some of the conspiracies about President
Obama and try to find a trend. First, there was the "birther"
conspiracy, perpetrated by the thankfully-retired-from-
CNN-and-definitely-not-a-racist Lou Dobbs, who stated that
the multiple birth announcements and birth certificates pro-
vided to the public were, indeed, fake. I would love to meet
the man who, in 1961, came up with the wonderful plot to
destroy America from the inside 47 years later using a black
child, conceived out of wedlock by an interracial couple (one
member of which was from Kenya). And this is 1961, when
"separate but equal" was considered OK in some places.
Moving on through the history of Barack Obama, you find
such scandals as Joe Wilson shouting "you lie" at a part of a
speech on health care that Obama most certainly wasn't lying
about. I can understand a Republican congressman disagree-
ing with what the president was saying, but never before had
I ever seen or heard someone shout out during a presiden-
tial address to Congress. You find the Rush Limbaugh storyN
/
er crowd than Bush
Paul Murty
letters@alligator orgabout how Obama's college thesis was
that the Constitution was "inherently
flawed," which Limbaugh found on a
Web site that labeled the story as a sat-
ire. You find comparisons to Hitler in
that the two were great speakers, only
to later find criticisms of his speeches
as president -all from the same chan-
nel. You find references to Bill Ayers,
to communism and socialism, to Hugo
Chavez, to Obama's role as either a Muslim or the apparent
Antichrist.
What you don't find, at least on Fox News' Web site, is a
detailed story about the effigy of President Obama that was
hanged in Plains, Ga. The only story I could find is a blurb
saying that the Secret Service is investigating the incident.
"Bush effigy burned," returned numerous results, the first of
which at least three times longer than the Obama story.
Plains, Ga., prides itself on being the hometown of for-
mer President Carter. This, at least somewhat, shows that the
town doesn't hate Democrats in general. They simply hate
Barack Obama, and that leads racism. Racism could explain a
number of the conspiracies listed above. Birthers don't want
to believe that a black man could be legitimately elected their
president, so he must not have been born here. Limbaugh
and his right-wing friends, including my old buddy from
Connecticut, shock-jock radio Glenn Beck (whogot in trouble
in his Connecticut days for making fun of an Asian caller on
his morning show), have said racist things about Obama on
multiple occasions. I have seen criticism of a president and
have taken part in criticism of President Bush. I've also lived
with my mom, who can't admit that Bill Clinton did any-
thing good for the country because she dislikes Democrats
so much (yet still loves me). But I have never seen outright
hatred for a president like I have seen with Obama.
Paul Murty is an English sophomore.

NOT -WWE STSS.Guest column
Capital punishment
inhumane, unethical
J ohn Walsh Needs to KeepHis Mouth Shut. It's not that
his crime-fighting endeavor
America's Most Wanted" hasn't
proven to be successful -it has,
most recently with the capture of
Jupiter massacre suspect Paul Me-
hinge -but rather that he, in his
position of influence as a popular
television host, should stop trying
to be judge, jury and executioner,
as he did recently when he called
for capital punishment for the
above suspect.
During Walsh's tenure as host,
AMW has directly led to the cap-
ture of about 1,100 suspects. This
is no small feat, and Walsh, along
with all of those involved with
the show's production, should be
lauded for their efforts. However,
Walsh needs to realize his influence
must be curtailed at capture.
In consideration of some of his
past opinions concerning the pun-
ishment of sex offenders (which
have touched on rectal explosive
devices, for example), it seems he
deems himself the ambassador of
justice for heinous crimes.
Moreover, he is regarded pub-
licly as an expert when it comes to
such matters, stemming from both
his position as host of AMW and
his son's highly publicized kidnap-
ping and murder in 1981.
However, neither he nor any
other indirect victims of such atroc-
ities are in any position to decide
the fate of the offender, as such acts
leave victims' families emotionally
compromised when it comes to re-
solving such an issue, hence the ex-
istence of a fair and just (in theory)
legal system as a more civil proxy
for self-administered justice.
If I've come off as callous, I won't
apologize, but it was not my inten-
tion. Rather, I'll take this opportu-
nity to throw in my two cents as aRyan Spencer proponent
Speaking Out of abolish-
ing the death
penalty.
It is inherently contradictory
to condemn someone for killing
and then subsequently kill them.
However, because the responsibil-
ity for such acts is diffused through
both the entirety of society and the
executioner-less means of capital
punishment, such policies are con-
sidered morally tenable or at least
deluded enough to be permissible.
That notion is an illusion: If the
laws upheld by a society are a re-
flection of it as a whole, then we all
share responsibility for such acts.
For those who brush off claims
of responsibility because such peo-
ple deserve to die, let me say this:
No one -not even those responsi-
ble for the most horrific things you
can imagine -deserves to die.
From a different angle: There is
no act a person can commit that is
terrible enough to merit their life
being ended by an ethical society.
Essentially, this has less to do
with the nature of their actions and
more so with the blood left on all
our hands from allowing such a re-
sponse to them.
Anyone who cites the "hu-
mane" way in which these people
are "put down" is naive to the fact
that softening and ritualizing kill-
ing with euphemisms and the legal
system is entirely sadistic.
My line of reasoning is explicitly
not an appeal to any metaphysical
moral code, but rather an assess-
ment of consequences, which sug-
gest we shouldn't hold our heads
so high when we speak of capital
punishment. But if we can live with
that, as we have, we do so at the ex-
pense of our ethical integrity.

senior.

UF WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Gators down Tigers in double OT
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
etorrens@alligator org
With the game forced into a
second overtime, Steffi Sorensen
was the least expected player on
the Gators to take a shot. Through
the game's first 45 minutes, So-
rensen had failed to score a single
point.
Then she hit a three-pointer.Then hit another. And another.
The senior rattled off three-
straight shots from beyond the
arc, despite missing her first six
attempts of the game, to start the
second overtime in a 71-68 vic-
tory over Auburn on Thursday.
"I was getting some open looks
and I wasn't hitting them and it's
something I've been used to all
season," Sorensen said. "There's
two ways you can go about it:

omore led UF with 21 points and 11 rebounds.stop shooting and play scared or
you can keep shooting, and that's
what I did."
The Gators (9-6, 2-0 Southeast-
ern Conference) seemingly had
the game won at halftime.
Using strong defense to hold
the Tigers to 18.5 percent field-
goal shooting (5 of 27) and forc-
ing 15 turnovers in the first half,
Florida stormed out to a 33-15
lead at halftime, allowing the
fewest points in a half since a
Dec. 28, 2006 game against Ala-
bama St.
"I was getting some open
looks and I wasn't hitting
them and it's something
I've been used to all
season. There's two ways
you can go about it: stop
shooting and play scared
or you can keep shooting,
and that's what I did."
Steffi Sorensen
UF senior guard
Auburn center KeKe Carrier
was held to two points in the
first half, while the Gators' of-
fense was led by Azania Stewart,
who finished with 11 points in
the opening period and finished
with a career-high 21 points to go
with 11 rebounds.
But the Tigers hardly let the
18-point first-half deficit faze
them, rallying behind Carrier
after intermission. The Tigers
went on an 11-2 run to start the
half, where Carrier scored every
point for them. She finished with
a game-high 24 points on 9-of-13
shooting.
The run brought the game
within single digits with 10:13 re-
maining in regulation for the first
time since UF led 18-9 early on.
It was a vastly different sec-
ond half for UF, which reverted
back to turning the ball over and
being dictated by its opponent.
It committed 11 turnovers in the
second period compared to just 6
in the first.

0 MEET GIVES TEAM FIRST LOOK AT TALENTED
FRESHMEN.

The UF gymnastics team opens its season on the road at
Norman, Okla., for its first meet of the season against No. 9
Oklahoma tonight at 8. With weather forecasted to be in the
teens at the time of the meet, the team can be thankful it gets to
perform indoors.
That doesn't mean the Gators' reception will be any warm-
er.
And with five freshmen who figure to make an immediate
impacts on event lineups, it may not take
the Sooners faithful long to single them
Still, UF gymnastics coach Rhonda
Gymnasti Cs Faehn is ready to start the season and see
if her freshmen will sink or swim, stick
the landing or stumble in their first college
meet.
"Most important thing, we have to get our feet wet, get that
first competition underway," she said.
Because the Gators are the away team, they won't have the
advantage of beginning on vault and ending with floor rou-
tines.
Instead, the order of events for UF will be uneven bars,
vault, floor exercise and balance beam, one more challenge for
the team's freshmen to adjust to.

Team looks to Parsons
to solve shooting woes
By ADAM BERRY

The Gators have spent plenty
of time working to get their three-
point shots falling again -extra
shots in practice, individual shoot-
ing sessions, breaking down film.
But if recent history is any indi-
cator, Florida's schedule might be
handing it the best chance to break
out of its shooting slump.
UF (11-3) will open its South-
eastern Conference schedule Sat-
urday at noon against Vanderbilt
(11-3) in Memorial Gymnasium in
Nashville, Tenn., where the Gatorsenjoyed a hot shooting day last
season.
The Gators blew out the Com-
modores 94-69 and shot 15 of 25
from three-
point range on
Jan. 25, 2009.

Despite low percentage, Donovan encourages players to keep shooting
HOOPS, from page 13
8 threes, shot 10 of 11 on the game and fin-
ished with 27 points.
This year, Parsons will head to Vander-
bilt coming off his miracle 75-foot game-
winner against N.C. State. But he said
neither his previous performances nor the
team's recent cold snap from beyond the
arc will affect how he shoots Saturday.
"I'm going to shoot the ball. Even if I
went 0 for 7 the game before or 7 for 7, I'm
going to shoot with confidence," Parsons
said. "I've had some success in Vanderbilt's
gym before, but they're the same team basi-
cally they were last year, just a year older
and a year better."
A repeat of last year's performance
would certainly boost the Gators' confi-
dence from beyond the arc, where they are
shooting just 29 percent on the year.
UF coach Billy Donovan has repeatedly
stressed the importance of having his play-
ers keep shooting, and the mood around
the team's practice facility is that the outside
shots will have to start falling eventually.
"I'm a little surprised," Parsons said. "If
you come in here and watch practice, these
guys are making shots all day. But it's not
like it's not going to come around. They're
gonna continue to shoot the ball and take
good shots and not force anything. I have
confidence that our guys can start making
them."
The poor shooting has been a differentexperience for Donovan, whose teams have
enjoyed tremendous success from the out-
side in the past. And while he isn't saying
his team will shoot as well as it has in previ-
ous years, he also doesn't believe the team's
3-for-24 performance against N.C. State is
an indication of its true potential.
"Time will tell," Donovan said. "We've
had some very, very, what I would call hor-
rific shooting games, where it's been 1 for
13 or 2 for 24, and we've had some games
where we shot the ball very well.
"Do I think that we'll
shoot 3 for 23 the rest of
the year? No. Do I think
we'll shoot 12 for 24 for
Men's the rest of the year? No.
Basketball It'll probably fall some-
where in between."
Whether or not Flor-
ida finds its stroke from long range any-
time soon, the Gators will enter their SEC
schedule this year looking to avoid a third-
straight disappointing end to the season.
UF finished 8-8 in conference play in
2007-08 and 9-7 last year, and both seasons
ended with NIT appearances.
"We feel like we deserve it," point guard
Erving Walker said. "I know we lost to some
subpar teams, but we also beat some good
teams. We know the SEC is a tough round,
and we just want to take it one game at a
time, but I feel like we can do it this year.
"Just seeing the other teams out there, I
feel like we can compete with anybody."
Stewart leads UF with 21 points
WHOOPS, from page 13
The Gators shot nearly a similar
percentage in both halves (35.3 per-
cent from the field in the first half and
36.4 in the second) but couldn't get to
the free-throw line in the second pe-
riod and scored 14 less points than be-
fore halftime.
By comparison, the Tigers made 15
trips to the charity stripe in the second
frame and Auburn outscored Florida
37-19 in the second half.
With 11 seconds left in regulation,
Sorensen missed the first shot of her
one-and-one, and after a timeout was
called by each team, Tigers guard Ni-
colle Thomas sped down the court and
drained a desperation three-pointer
with 3 seconds left to send the gameinto overtime.
"I knew I had to step up because I
wasn't going to lose that game," said
Sorensen, who said she never hesi-
tated on her first three-point shot in
second overtime.
Stewart, on the verge of fouling out,
continued to battle it out with Carrier
in overtime and after Carrier missed
two free throws that would have made
it a two-possession game, Stewart an-
swered with two free throws that sent
it into the second overtime, where So-
rensen broke the game open on UF's
first three possessions.
"I can't say how big of a win it is,"
coach Amanda Butler said. "It was
huge. There were so many highs and
lows, but the main thing is we're 2-0
(in the SEC)."Matt Tripp / Alligator Staff
season at Vanderbilt, forward Chandler Parsons hit 7 of 8 three-point attempts en
e to a career-high 27 points. UF has struggled from beyond the arc this year.
| Replacing Sinclair on bars a concern
GYM, from page 13
Florida's performance on bars will give
the team a quick look at how much Melanie
Sinclair will be missed. Last year, Sinclair
posted a perfect 10 on bars against Ken-
tucky, and her removal from the team due to
legal issues could impact the team's scoring
potential for the event.
"Bars, I'm not gonna lie -she would get
a 10 a couple of times and it was almost a
guaranteed 9.9," Faehn said about Sinclair.
"Our athletes know they just have to work
a little harder to gain maybe a quarter-extra
tenth for each athlete."
Freshmen, like Ashan6e Dickerson, will
be looked upon early to fill the gaps left by
last year's losses on every event -not just
bars -and could be all-around competitors.
Vault, the team's weakest event last year
due to lack of depth, should be better this
year.
If there's one event where the Gators ex-
pect to pull away from Oklahoma, it's the
floor.
"I think this floor team rivals the floor
team we had in 2007, which we felt we couldalmost field two floor teams," Faehn said.
Amy Ferguson, who last year was a sta-
ple of the floor lineup, has changed her rou-
tine to include more complex skills at a faster
pace to complement returning gymnasts
Maranda Smith and Courtney Gladys.
"We have solid lineups and a few more
on each event," Ferguson
said. "Floor, I definitely
think, is going to be a
strong event. We'll defi-
nitely go out with a bang
on floor this year."
' N r The last event, the bal-
ance beam, gave the team
Faehn trouble early last season.
This year provides a dif-
ferent challenge: 10 to 11 gymnasts who
could earn a spot are battling for six open-
ings. That would mean taking off gymnasts
who were doing double- and triple-time last
season, filling in on events for other injured
gymnasts.
"We do have more depth this year, and
that makes everyone feel a little bit more
comfortable," senior Amanda Castillo said.
"Ultimately, that will help us perform bet-
ter- we we'll have a bit more confidence."00# # a I

Spring at UF offers plenty of sports viewing options besides hoops

onto alligator-

casting your
vote.Now that you're free from footballseason's choke hold, it's time to
take some advice from Wu Tang
Financial and diversify your bonds.
Your sports bonds that is.
There's plenty of great smaller sports
to choose from during the spring semes-
ter, but if you can check out just one,
make it softball.
The games are quick -usually no
more than two hours, Florida is one of
the best teams in the country coming off
of back-to-back Women's College World
Series, and Katie Seashole Pressly Stadi-
um is a nice facility and a great place to
hang out with a few friends and maybe
even catch a few free T-shirts.
Slap hitting is the one part of the game
I will probably never fully come around
on, but luckily UF coach Tim Walton's
lineup is full of girls who dig their back
foot into the dirt and blast home runs.
Francesca Enea, who is already Flor-
ida's career home runs leader, Kelsey
Bruder and Megan Bush combined for
50 homers last season.
Preston Tucker led the baseball team
with 15 bombs a year ago, so not even
three Preston Tuckers would outdo that
trio.

And if you ap-
preciate good pitching, Stephanie Brom-
bacher is taking over for Stacey Nelson
this season in the circle. The junior is a
perfect 42-0 with a no-hitter to her credit
through her first two seasons.
No matter what you would like to
see in a game, watching softball is often
like taking all the best parts of a 210-min-
ute baseball game and squeezing it into
a 90-minute timeframe.
All the spring sports are a great
change of pace, but softball is without a
doubt my favorite.
Truth be told, you should probably
take not only my advice and go to a soft-
ball game, but take Bob's advice, too,
and go to a gymnastics meet, especially
if Georgia is in town.
After all, we're trying to diversify.

made the mis-
take of not wear-

to one and was
out for the nextJ ust because football season is over,doesn't mean your Gators clothes
have to stay in your closet until next
ugust.
There are still plenty of options for
you to cheer on your beloved Florida,
and it doesn't stop at men's basketball.
Most of the sports teams at UF are
among the nation's best.
For me there is a clear-cut choice for
which is the best to attend, and that's
gymnastics.
Sure the softball team is great and
will likely be playing for a national
championship again at the end of the
season. The baseball team keeps getting
better and has a top-10 team this year,
and for the ladies, there is not much
better than a baseball player. Lacrosse
is interesting because it's new and ex-
citing. The other sports are just niche
sports, and not many can stay inter-
ested in them.
The big problem with baseball and
softball is they take way more dedica-
tion and time than anyone should be
willing to spend on a small sport.
Baseball and softball have three
games almost every weekend and more
during the week. Also, it's outside so
you're going to have to deal with the

Gymnastics is in the O'Connell Cen-
