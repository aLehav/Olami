Even the UF Student Health Care Cen-
ter isn’t immune to ﬂ  u shot shortages.
In just two weeks, the SHCC ran out of 
ﬂ  u shots after vaccinating 4,000 students, 
faculty and staff. 
A new shipment is expected to arrive Friday, and ﬂ  u shots will resume Mon-day.
SHCC spokeswoman Catherine See-
mann said the increase in vaccinations 
wasn’t surprising after last year’s active 
ﬂ  u season received national media cover-age. 
September’s demand nearly doubled 
last year’s turnout of 2,565 doses admin-istered.
“We were not expecting to vaccinate 
that many people,” Seemann said. “That’s 
a huge jump for us.”
Nursing junior Sarah Aitchison, 21, couldn’t risk another day without an up-
dated vaccine; she spends two days a week working at a hospital. 
Although she prefers getting her ﬂ  u 
shots on campus, Aitchison went to CVS on Monday for her ﬂ  u shot. Without her 
insurance, the shot would’ve cost $31.99.
Flu shots will be available at the SHCC 
Inﬁ  rmary Building, Special Clinics depart-
ment or at the Health Science Center on a walk-in basis on Monday through Friday from 8 to 11:30 a.m. and 1 to 4 p.m.Cover that cough: UF out of ﬂ  u shots until Monday

The popular photo-and-
video sharing app Instagram 
recently announced it will 
be incorporating advertise-
ments, but it won’t make many UF students cut back 
on using it.
“It’ll be like any other 
app,” said 26-year-old sec-
ond-year UF linguistics stu-
dent Sarah Howard.
Howard said she uses 
Instagram “all the time.” 
She said the addition of ads might be a little annoying, but wouldn’t change her use 
of the app.
UF social media specialist 
Bruce Floyd said usage will 
be affected depending on how ads are displayed.
“They won’t get in the 
way if you can scroll past 
them, but if they do it like a 
pop-up and create user frus-tration, it may have a nega-tive effect on users,” Floyd said.
Floyd pointed out the ex-
ample of Facebook, saying ads have been there for a while in different styles, but 
the site is still widely used by 
its users.
“As long as connections 
are there, ads won’t deter them,” he said.
Some students don’t ap-
preciate the intrusion.

Now that a ﬁ  rewall at UF Health Shands has been re-
moved, people at any of the hospital locations can order 
food through Gainesville2Go — and the company will de-
liver it for free.
Originally, the hospital’s web system blocked the com-
pany’s website. In response, last week, Gainesville2Go began waiving the usual delivery fee for all food brought 
to Shands locations.
“Everything would work until customers got to the 
checkout page, so they had to use the iPhone app to get around it,” said Jackson Bodiford, Gainesville2Go man-ager. “We started the free delivery to thank our customers for continuing to order from us.”Even though the ﬁ  rewall is no longer an issue, Bodi-
ford said the free delivery should continue.
Alex Pierovich, a 20-year-old UF pre-nursing sopho-
more and a volunteer at the hospital, said the free food 
delivery could brighten the atmosphere.
“The ability to eat their favorite foods would … make 
the hospitalization seem less dreary,” she said.
Bodiford has not seen much additional interest in 
the service but said he expects that will change as word spreads.
Gainesville2Go also offers free delivery to police sta-
tions and ﬁ  re stations. Gainesville2Go food delivery to UF Health Shands now freeSEE INSTAGRAM, PAGE 4

Janet Yamamoto, a UF professor in infectious diseases, has discov-
ered a connection between feline AIDS and HIV that may lead to a vaccine for humans and a better vaccine for cats. 
JENSEN WERLEY 
Alligator Staff Writer jwerley@alligator.org
A UF researcher has found a 
link between “feline AIDS” and 
HIV that may lead to a vaccine for humans and a better vaccine for cats.
Janet Yamamoto, a UF profes-
sor in infectious diseases, discov-ered feline AIDS in 1986.
By comparing feline and human 
viruses, FIV and HIV, she was able to ﬁ  nd similarities in the sequenc-es, she wrote in an email.
Yamamoto said the feline vac-
cine, released in 2002, works specif-
ically with antiviral T cells that can 
kill the virus-infected cells without harming the normal cells. She said the study uses T cells from HIV-positive humans to see if they react with regions of the FIV protein to induce anti-HIV T cell activity.
The research found that the  
FIV protein stimulated human T 
cells to produce anti-HIV activity, 
which is why it could be used as a component to an HIV vaccine.
The vaccine won’t just beneﬁ  t 
humans.
“The by-product of this HIV 
vaccine work will be the produc-tion of improved second-genera-tion FIV vaccine,” she said. “Thus, 
our work will beneﬁ  t both humans 
and cats.”Students in the health science 
ﬁ  eld agree this discovery could be a step in furthering HIV AIDS re-search.
“For HIV AIDS, they have a 
treatment, but you can’t cure it,” 
said Bao Pham, a 20-year-old ﬁ  rst-
year pharmacy student. “If they ﬁ  nd a new way to treat it better, it’s really great.”
Yamamoto said the next step 
of her research is to test on at least two animal species before moving on to humans, as per Food and Drug Administration rules.
“The work described by Dr. 
Yamamoto has great promise as an approach to develop a vac-cine against HIV AIDS,” said John Dame, chairman of the depart-ment of infectious diseases and pathology, in a statement. “It is a very exciting, fresh new approach to solving this major world health 
problem.”‘Feline AIDS’ research

Gainesville Police arrested a 
Gainesville man Saturday after 
he threw a beer at another man 
and then stole his car. 
Ofﬁ  cers arrested Benjamin 
Franklin Cunningham, 24, on 
charges of aggravated battery 
and grand theft auto, according 
to a GPD arrest report. 
He is also serving time for 
violation of probation charges, according to jail records. 
At about 11 p.m., the victim 
parked his car on the side of Southeast 19th Terrace and left it running, according to the report.
Cunningham began arguing 
with the man and threw a beer can at the back of his head, according to the report. 
The man was knocked 
unconscious, according to the 
report. 
While he was out, Cunningham 
got in the man’s car and sped  
down the block.
Police stopped Cunningham 
in the car and arrested him, according to the report.  
Two witnesses saw 
Cunningham throw the beer at 
the man and watched him steal 
the car. 
During questioning with 
police, Cunningham said, “I’m ﬁ  ne; I’m ﬁ  ne; it’s whatever,” 
according to the report.
Ofﬁ  cers booked Cunningham 
into the Alachua County Jail at 
about midnight Sunday, where 
he remained Monday night with

More than 200 UF students will fast from 
sunrise to sunset today as a part of the Islam 
on Campus’ 11th annual Fast-a-Thon.
After sunset, all students are invited to at-
tend a free international feast at 6:30 p.m. in 
the Stephen C. O’Connell Center.
“We want everyone to get the experience 
of fasting and understand what it means in the 
Islam tradition,” said Sumrah Iqbal, 21-year-old UF mechanical engineering senior and IOC president. “By doing something small together we can make a difference on a global scale.”
IOC holds Fast-a-Thon every Fall in the 
hope of bringing students together in the ﬁ  ght against hunger, she said. 
IOC will donate the money it has raised 
through T-shirt sales this semester to Project Downtown and the United Nation’s World 
Food Programme, Iqbal said. Every student 
who pledged to fast will have money donated on their behalf to one of these organizations.
“By not eating for a day, you are feeding 
someone else for a day,” Iqbal said.
Iqbal said even students who opt not to fast 
are welcome to join the international feast.
There will be a keynote address by Ismail 
Ibn Ali, a former IOC president and UF alum-
nus who is now the current deputy executive 
director and an instructor of Quranic Arabic at Fawakih Institute.
“I encourage everyone to attend the event,” 
said IOC Fast-a-Thon chair Amana Abdulwa-keel, a 21-year-old UF microbiology junior. “It makes my heart smile to be a part of some-thing like this.”
This year, IOC amped up its advertising 
to promote its cause at a very real and human level, Abdulwakeel said.
Both she and Iqbal said they hope the new 
advertising strategy works and brings more service organizations to event this year. 
“Fast-a-Thon really showcases what being 
a Gator is all about,” Iqbal said. “It’s about actively participating in new experiences, get-ting involved in your community and making 
an impact wherever you are.”Today’s Fast-a-Thon to benefit organizations“I’m ﬁ  ne; I’m ﬁ  ne; it’s

UF Levin College of Law did not follow 
the national trend of cutting the size of its 
entering class this year.
More than half of law school admis-
sions ofﬁ  cers reported cutting their enter-ing law school classes this year, making this the second year in a row law schools 
reported cutting their entering class sizes, 
according to results of Kaplan Test Prep Survey released last week.
This year, UF Law enrolled a class size 
of 318, which is about 30 more students 
than last year’s class, said Robert H. Jerry, 
dean of UF Law.
“I think it’s because our applicant pool 
is so strong, and we are viewed as a very 
strong school,” Jerry said. Even with the increase in UF Law’s en-
tering class size, Jerry said he expects to see a decline in the average credentials of 
students accepted to UF Law — a median of about one LSAT point, which he said he expects will be on par with the national 
average.
He attributes this expected decline in 
student credentials to the decrease in law 
school applicants nationally. 
To offset the drop in credentials, Jerry 
said, some schools have been shrinking the size of their classes.
Kaplan reports law school applica-
tions have dropped from 602,300 in 2010 
to 385,400 in 2013. That’s the lowest level 
in decades.
Javier Gil, a 20-year-old UF psychology 
senior, is applying to UF Law. He said he thinks students not wanting to work hard 
is why there is a decrease in the number of 
applicants.’
“It’s a little bit strange,” he said. “I don’t 
like the idea of law schools dropping their 
standards, but it makes sense.”4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, OCTOBER 8, 2013

Many students will still use the app, but hope ads aren’t intrusive
Marks uses Instagram to stay connected after she stopped 
using Facebook.
“Ads are terrible,” Marks said. “Who wants to be bom-
barded?”
Twenty-year-old UF health education and human be-
havior junior Lexi Klym said she isn’t looking forward to the ads clouding her stream of photos, but her usage won’t change.
Klym said she wouldn’t mind ads geared toward her interests tracked through hashtags.
“It would be better than random ads,” Klym said.Advertisements aren’t the worst change Instagram 
could make, said UF economics and political science se-nior Victoria Dokken, 21.
“It’d be way worse to charge people,” she said.
For 19-year-old UF engineering sophomore Matt Burke, his future Instagram use will depend on the type of ads 
that are displayed. 
He said he typically uses Instagram about four times 
a month.
Burke said if it’s a banner, he’ll still use the app, but if 
it’s a video, similar to how YouTube advertises, he’ll use Instagram less.
Emma Roulette, a 19-year-old UF biology junior who 
said she doesn’t like Instagram, suggested the advertise-ments are a creative way for the app to get money.
“Maybe they’re struggling,” Roulette said. “But with 
no other alternative, people will still use the app.”INSTAGRAM , from page 1 “Maybe they’re struggling. But with no other

Wonder Bread is making 
a comeback, but the classic 
packaged in white plastic with 
red, blue and yellow polka dots hasn’t hit Gainesville 
stores yet. 
For the past year, the clas-
sic white sandwich bread was 
not on shelves after Hostess 
Brands ﬁ  led bankruptcy.
But now, Flowers Foods, 
which bought Wonder from 
Hostess Brands in July, is 
bringing it and three other 
bread brands — Merita, Home Pride and Butternut back — onto store shelves throughout 
the U.S., USA Today reported.
Local grocers say they 
haven’t heard much but ex-
pect distributors to stock the shelves when it becomes avail-
able.
Taylor Hennings, a 23-year-
old employee of the Stephen 
C. O’Connell Center, said her 
parents used to buy Wonder 
Bread when she was younger.
“I think I would try it at 
least once,” she said. “Just to see if it’s the same from when I was a kid.”
When Alyson Huber, a 21-
year-old advertising senior, 
thinks of Wonder Bread, she 
said she recalls the small sand-wich-shaped boxes she used to 
tote sandwiches in as a kid.
But now, as an adult, she 
isn’t brand-loyal.
“I don’t really buy any 
particular brand,” she said. 
“I usually always try to get whole wheat. It’s supposed to 
be better for you.”
But she said the bread’s 
marketing is positive and memorable. 
“The logo makes me think 
it’s a friendly, happy brand,” 
Huber said.
Wonder Bread is known to 
last longer than other brands before becoming moldy, but that just means it may have different preservatives, said Wendy Dahl, an assistant UF 
professor in the food science 
and human nutrition depart-
ment. 
She said white breads, in-
cluding Wonder Bread, usu-ally have less ﬁ  ber than whole-
grain breads, but it still counts 
as a serving of grains.
“It wouldn’t be the best 
choice,” she said. “We general-
ly recommend whole grains.”
The Wonder brand has 
been a part of the American food industry since 1921. It was one of the ﬁ  rst breads that was sold pre-sliced.
The bread’s comeback may 
invite members of a younger 
generation who are unfamiliar 
with the brand to try it, such as Caroline Carey.
The 18-year-old UF health 
sciences freshman said she 
usually buys whole wheat, but 
she is somewhat familiar with the brand.
“I don’t know that much 
about it,” she said. “I’d prob-ably buy it.”TUESDAY, OCTOBER 8, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 5

� ORGANIZERS HOPE TO 
RESTART THE PROGRAM WHEN THE SHUTDOWN ENDS.
HANNA MARCUS
Alligator Staff Writer hmarcus@alligator.org
As the days of government shut-
down add up, Alachua County pro-
grams have begun to feel the effects 
on a local level.
The county’s Foster Grandpar-
ent Program laid off all 92 volunteer 
“grandparents” and temporarily 
reassigned three staff members be-
cause it was unable to draw federal funds for the program.
The program matches volunteers 
more than 55 years old with children 
who have special needs in daycares 
and public schools around the coun-ty. The volunteers receive a non-taxable stipend payment of $2.65 
an hour, according to the Alachua 
County website.
It will be unavailable until the 
government shutdown has ended, said Minnie Rolark, a county pro-grams director.
The funding dry-up contradicted 
what the Corporation of National 
Services told county representatives. 
During a teleconference call last 
week, local ofﬁ  cials were informed 
the shutdown would not affect the Foster Grandparent Program, ac-cording to an email from Alachua 
County Manager Betty Baker.
“These grandparents are in over 
32 sites, in schools, after-school pro-
grams and daycares,” Rolark said. 
“That’s going to be missed.”
Barbara Perry, 72, has volunteered 
with the program for about nine 
years at Charles W. Duval Elemen-tary School. She said she was devas-
tated by the layoff, and children will suffer because of it.
“It’s hurt us all, including the 
kids,” she said. “Some children, they 
need a hug. They need to call you ‘grandma’ and know that grandma is there to love them and help them and 
support them in their education.”
Candie Nixon, director for 
CHOICES, said relaying the news to 
the volunteers and schools was dis-
heartening.
“The foster grandparents were 
shocked and surprised at being laid 
off,” she said. “Some of the volun-teers voiced concerns regarding the 
teachers’ and students’ ability to get 
along without their assistance.”
The program’s three permanent 
staff members have temporarily been 
reassigned to CHOICES, a program 
that provides health education to residents.
CHOICES will ofﬁ  cially end in 
December, said Rolark, and if the 
government shutdown is still in ef-
fect after then, the transferred staff members will be unemployed.
Baker said for the employees’ 
sake, she hopes the shutdown ends soon.
“Since it was a grant-funded pro-
gram, they would have been laid off on the very day the memo went out,” 
she said. “So we temporarily reas-
signed them with the hope this can be resolved before that.”
Though the program is not opera-
tional, Rolark said she is conﬁ  dent it will kick back into gear when the shutdown ends.
“As soon as we’re able to draw 
down funds to be able to pay volun-
teers and staff, we should be able to 
notify volunteers that the layoff sta-tus is over,” she said. “If volunteers are still interested in being foster 
grandparents, we’ll let them know 
when the program is back.”‘Grandparents’ laid off

Science of hitmaking 
is ruining the industry
In season ﬁ  ve of “Mad Men,” an AMC drama set in the 
1960s, there’s a scene where Don Draper — a sexy, suit-wearing ad executive, as portrayed by Jon Hamm — is giv-
en a copy of the Beatles’ “Revolver” record. In his sprawling living room overlooking the Manhattan skyline, he puts the record on the player, turns up the stereo and sits in an arm-chair. The trippy opening bars of “Tomorrow Never Knows” play over the speakers as Draper sips a glass of scotch and listens. 
To viewers in 2013, it’s a snapshot of a time when sitting 
down and listening to a record was an experience that en-
gaged all the senses. You sat in your living room, you poured 
a drink and you listened to an album. 
When the Beatles wrote “Revolver,” they weren’t attempt-
ing to effect cultural change or produce hits. Lennon, Mc-Cartney and the producers were experimenting with new 
sounds and an Indian inﬂ  uence. While we’re not condoning 
heavy drug use — LSD was instrumental in the song-writing 
process for the album — the Beatles weren’t operating under 
pressure from the record label to churn out a stream of No. 1 iTunes songs. 
These days, the art of crafting an album has been over-
shadowed by the music industry’s thirst for hits. 
This week, The New Yorker published a proﬁ  le of Lukasz 
Gottwald, a 40-year-old white guy responsible for co-writing 
and co-producing more than 30 top-10 singles since 2004 — 
including Miley Cyrus’s “Wrecking Ball” and Katy Perry’s “Roar.”
According to the proﬁ  le, New Yorker writer John Sea-
brook spoke to Gottwald about his technique for producing 
No. 1 songs. 
“(Gottwald said) ‘It’s a combination of artists, producers, 
top-liners, beatmakers, melody people, vibe people.’ Vibe 
people ‘know how to make a song happen, understand ener-
gy, and where music is going, even if they can’t play a chord 
or sing a note.’”
The album business has collapsed, Seabrook wrote, with 
album sales falling to a record low over the summer. 
While this isn’t bad news for established bands — if Radio-
head, for example, produced a new album and uploaded it to iTunes tomorrow, it would undoubtedly sell big — the death 
of the album is bad news for up-and-comers. Now, the secret 
to musical success for new bands lies in music publishing, or 
landing a song in a commercial, TV show or movie. 
Luckily, the resurgence of independent record stores’ 
popularity gives us hope for the fate of the album as an insti-tution. Listeners can do their part by supporting local music 
stores — for example, Hear Again Music and Movies and Ar-
row’s Aim Records in Gainesville. 
After all, wouldn’t you rather support an indie band rath-
er than a middle-aged white guy who goes by the moniker 
“Dr. Luke”?‘Sex and the City’ more than guilty pleasure
Most of us adore “Sex and the City,” but aligning 
ourselves with the show means characterizing ourselves as vapid, materialistic or at least na-
ive. Why is this series viewed as nothing more than a guilty pleasure?
For six years, “Sex and the City” dominated HBO, 
and yet somehow it has been deemed devoid of any 
merit. For avid viewers, Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and 
Samantha are versions of themselves who try on hypoth-eses about relationships like vintage Dolce skirts — ac-cepting or rejecting them by the end of the episode. They experiment with the pros and cons of sexual liberation 
versus marriage while critiquing these polarized views 
of love.
As Samantha once told Charlotte, sexual liberation 
can be characterized as “having sex like a man.” They 
believe men use women as sexual objects to prevent emo-
tional attachment. Samantha does the same for most of the series, presenting the pros of sexual liberation to the audience. Her foil is Charlotte, a traditional woman from old money determined to land a husband. She highlights 
the negative views of sexual liberation and the beneﬁ  ts 
of traditional monogamy through marriage, as well as old-fashioned courtship. Carrie and Miranda fall be-tween these two spectrum ends, sleeping with men but 
only as part of the process of ﬁ  nding monogamous love.
The characters act, think and say what their audi-
ence cannot — they cheat, sleep with exes and lament 
the challenges of balancing career and family. Charlotte even poses as a man for an oil portrait. Women are al-
lowed to experiment through the characters’ experiences 
without engaging in any risky behavior themselves, and for that, we thank them.
In the pilot episode, the four friends’ characters are 
quickly revealed. Soon they inhibit their complexities while still effectively representing four different types of women. Ultimately, each character shatters her given stereotype — and grows per-sonally and interpersonally in the process.
Carrie gives up Manhattan 
and her column, both crucial to her identity, to move to Paris with her artist beau. This results 
in a literal and ﬁ  gurative slap 
after she realizes she will never 
ﬁ  nd the perfect romance, even in the city of love. She accepts her imperfections and those of Big, and they re-sume their wonderfully imperfect relationship. By the 
ﬁ  nale, Charlotte is a converted Jew with an adopted 
daughter from China, shattering her WASP image but achieving her lifelong dream of a family. 
Miranda has a son and moves to Brooklyn, continu-
ously sacriﬁ  cing and tearing down walls to accept love. Samantha yields to monogamous love but with a young-er male model whom she manages, retaining her charac-teristic power while devoting herself to one person.
In season two, Carrie writes a love poem for a wed-
ding. She ﬁ  nds it challenging, because her career is based on writing about sex. It takes her multiple tries to pen the poem and still it isn’t perfect. Finally she accepts her work like she accepts her love with Big — for everything 
it is not. 
“Sex and the City” has merit as a strong series with 
four well-written, complex and fallible women at the 
helm.
“Sex and the City” was meant to explore, and beneath 
the femininity and the fashion lies a signiﬁ  cant inves-tigation into modern monogamy. By now we should know better than to ﬂ  ippantly dismiss any product of our culture, or we risk being what the fabulous Stanford 
Blatch once called “a judgy-wudgy bear.”

The federal government is being held 
hostage by a small cabal of the Re-publican Party whose popularity is 
on the decline. Rep. Ted Yoho is one of the 80 Republicans in the House of Representa-
tives who signed onto Rep. Mark Meadows’ 
memo to Speaker John Boehner calling for the Affordable Care Act to be defunded through the budget.
The health care legislation, passed through the House 
and Senate, was signed by the president and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. It is a law that was not passed using the backhanded tomfoolery we’ve seen this past week in Congress. If the House wishes to change the health care law, it should use the normal legislative pro-
cess. The tactics being employed by Rep. Yoho are those 
of a hostage-taker who is desperate to remain politically relevant.This shutdown is little more than an Affordable Care Act proxy war with the nearly 800,000 furloughed federal workers and more than 1 million unpaid essential staff as its collateral damage.
On his recent vote to shut down the federal govern-
ment, Yoho said, “President Obama and Senate Demo-crats keep insisting it is the House that is being unreason-
able, yet I don’t see a single provision voted on today that 
doesn’t have the support of a majority of the American people.”
The American people do not want the livelihood of the 
federal workforce or the services they provide to be shut down due to zealous politicking. Some re-cent polling proves Yoho and his cohorts are in the minority. A Quinnipiac University poll found 72 percent of Americans are opposed to shutting down the federal government to 
defund the health care legislation. The CNN/
ORC International poll found only 26 percent of Ameri-
cans approve of the GOP handling of the shutdown. The unpopular nature of this tactic is becoming more loathed as agencies and services are shutting down.
The Head Start program, which provides early educa-
tion to more than 1 million needy children, has started to close due to this shutdown. This has already affected more than 400 children in the state of Florida. The Wom-
en, Infants, and Children program, which helps ensure 
the nutrition of underprivileged families, is set to run out of funds any day. This will affect the nutrition of 9 mil-lion mothers and babies around the nation and more than 16,000 participants in the North Central Florida WIC Pro-gram. Yoho’s actions are literally taking young children out of schools and formula out of the mouths of babes.
This shutdown puts an unnecessary burden on our 
2.8 million federal workers and disproportionately hurts 
the most vulnerable among us. It’s time for Rep. Yoho to 
abandon this farce and do his job. After all, Yoho is one of the few federal workers still getting paid.
Jeremiah Tattersall is on the ﬁ  eld staff of the North Central 
Florida Central Labor Council.Rep. Yoho needs to help end shutdownGuest Column
Amateur hour is on full display in our nation’s capital — 
or, to be more precise, amateur week. The government remains in shutdown mode while the president refuses 
to budge on Obamacare, Republicans do not have an endgame in sight and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid name-calls and 
refuses to negotiate with the House.
The House continues to pass piece-
meal legislations that fund part of the 
federal government. These appro-priations fund speciﬁ  c areas such as national parks, veterans’ beneﬁ  ts and the National Institutes of Health.
While these areas are supported 
by both sides, the House refuses to 
fund some other areas of the govern-
ment. Why is this the case? When you look at some of the other areas of the government, you start to see why, and you begin to realize the many inefﬁ  ciencies of our federal government.   
Take a look at the cabinet departments. According to Gov-
ernment Executive, 95 percent of the Environmental Protection Agency, 96 percent of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, 98 percent of the Federal Communications Com-
mission and 95 percent of Department of Education employees 
were deemed to be “nonessential” during the current govern-ment shutdown. Is paying for such nonessential employees cost-efﬁ  cient when the government eventually opens back up?  
Ironically, the Department of Veteran Affairs deemed only 4 
percent of its employees “nonessential,” but it is one of the most poorly run departments in the federal government. Veterans ﬁ  l-ing their ﬁ  rst claims receive their beneﬁ  ts within 316 and 327 days. However, if they are in a major U.S. city, the number ticks 
up to more than 540 days. And the VA have been questioned 
about preventable deaths at medical facilities while ﬁ  nding the time and money to reward roughly $573,000 in bonuses to its employees. 
Safety net programs for the poor and disabled are also af-
fected by the shutdown. While caring for the poor and disabled should be a priority for everyone, many people neglect to talk about the effective and efﬁ  cient jobs local charities do.  
And let us forget about the many inefﬁ  ciencies of the Afford-
able Care Act.  
When you have a big government, its citizens have to entrust 
the many functions of the state to capable and able-minded politicians. Because of the ever-increasing size and scope of the government, the politicians are forced to deal with more and more issues on a consistent basis that must be addressed.
However, one would be wrong in their assumption of “ca-
pable” and “able-minded” politicians. In having a big govern-ment — whether you agree with this or not — you need to en-
sure that you have the ability to tackle one issue and move on 
to the next.
This is currently not the case. Take the government shut-
down, for example. Regardless of your political spin, we are in a government shutdown, period. And no side is budging, period. And no side is talking to each other, period.
The mentality in Washington is not, “Let’s get things done 
so we can solve another problem.” Rather it is, “Let us posture politically until it becomes too much of a political risk.”
A senior government administration ofﬁ  cial was quoted by 
The Wall Street Journal saying: “We are winning ... It doesn’t re-ally matter to us,” how long the shutdown lasts, “because what matters is the end result.”
Such is an unfortunate reality when the government tries to 
perform too many roles. The time and consideration for impor-tant issues is too often squandered for political points and spin.  
And let’s be perfectly clear; shutting the government down 
is not a smart idea, no matter what your political afﬁ  liation may 
be. But conversely, having a federal government that is run so 
inefﬁ  ciently is also not a smart idea. Though many government programs start with good intentions, they can — and will — be mismanaged and hurt us in the long run.
The debate that should be taking place is one of government 
substance: tax policy, regulation policy or immigration, for ex-ample. Instead, the debate about utter governmental dysfunc-tion is taking place — and no one is winning in that ﬁ  ght.

Student Government elections 
are pointless 
How amazing, the Swamp Party 
won the overwhelming majority of 
senate seats in this Fall’s SG elec-tions.
Can anyone say that they are 
surprised? Can anyone, without a restrained smirk, honestly say that they thought the Students Party had a chance?
My guess is that not a single soul 
in all of the 50,000 or so students that attend the University of Florida would respond “yes” to either of those questions.
This is neither good, nor bad. It 
just simply “is.” The Swamp Party regularly sweeps the competition with a combination of puppies, com-mands and just plain ol’ loitering.Full of frat stars and sorority 
queens, the Swamp Party, formed last year from the withered remains of the Unite Party, which was ru-
mored to have been thrown aside af-
ter numerous Greek scandals swept each respective “row,” has a history of furthering the Greek agenda while keeping a ﬁ  rm control over the stu-dent population.
Remember when you voted for 
the new construction on the Reitz Union? Yea, neither do I. The Greek-
controlled SG was again rumored 
to have pushed it through, even af-ter the majority of students voted against it.
Excuse me. I’m just a little bit-
ter I won’t be able to enjoy any fall lunches on the grassy steps behind the Reitz.So, all in all, what’s the point in 
having elections when the system continually leans to one side? I know that we “have” to have them in or-
der to resemble a fair college democ-
racy, but let’s be honest, when you have fraternity and sorority presi-dents telling every member of their house that they absolutely must vote Swamp, and do anything to con-vince others to vote Swamp, what’s the point? Greeks have control, and I don’t foresee a future where Greeks 
lose that control, unfortunately.
But hey, maybe it’s a good thing 
to have the SG controlled by people 
who value the number of keg stands they can do over actually listening to the student body, right?

Gainesville Police has partnered with Stop Children’s Cancer and added pink graphics to police 
vehicles to raise awareness and funds to help find a cure for cancer.

BEEN SPONSORED.

Alligator Staff Writer kvarn@alligator.org
Some Gainesville Police 
squad cars are doing more than 
patrolling for crime this month. 
Through the Cops for a Cure 
campaign, residents can donate money to paint lettering on GPD squad cars pink to coincide 
with the start of Breast Cancer 
Awareness month. 
The donations will go to Stop 
Children’s Cancer, which mainly benefits pediatric clinical trials 
at UF, said Julie Hill, executive 
director.
Donors can specify to 
contribute their money to decal 
a car, which is painted at a 
discounted rate by Signs by Tomorrow. 
So far, 12 cars have been 
sponsored, and more are in the works, Hill said.
“It’s pretty exciting, really,” 
she said. “It’s a real community effort.”
GPD spokesman Officer Ben 
Tobias said the show of support is in line with the department’s mission.
“Our job is to protect and 
serve, and this is a little bit of that 
serving,” he said The idea was sparked when 
Officer Amanda Cummings saw the Marion County Sheriff’s Office 
running a similar awareness campaign. 
She said implementing the 
campaign is a positive way to 
connect with the community. 
“Yeah we’re cops, yeah we 
carry around guns and badges,” 
she said, “but we’re people too. 
When we go home at night, we’re 
affected by the same things other people are.” 
Cummings’ car was one of the 
first painted for the campaign. 
She said in the first few hours, 
people were stopping her and asking to take pictures with the car. 
“No matter where you are in 
life, everyone’s been affected by cancer, so it’s something we can all get behind,” she said.‘Police’ goes pink on some GPD cars

Student organizations are 
pushing for UF to change uni-
versity laws that state undocu-mented students must pay out-of-state tuition — even if they 
live in Florida.
“I’m a documented immi-
grant, but it’s always been an 
issue,” said Chrisley Carpio, a 21-year-old UF history senior. “These people live here, some of them know English better than Spanish, and then they’re deported back to countries they 
barely remember. It’s definitely 
an issue.”
A student-led petition was 
recently created that proposes a change to UF’s policy on out-of-state tuition undocumented students have to pay.
UF student organizations 
including CHISPAS, the His-
panic Student Association, 
UF Students for a Democratic Society and the Institute of Hispanic-Latino Culture have been collecting signatures be-fore they present the petition to UF President Bernie Machen on Oct. 17.
Students can sign the peti-
tion at chn.ge/19vwWaG. As of press time, about 5,900 stu-dents have signed.
Janine Sikes, UF spokes-
woman, said the university cannot legally offer in-state tu-ition or in-state tuition waivers to undocumented students un-til Congress passes the DREAM 
Act or until Florida legislature 
passes a similar law.
“Right now, we depend 
highly on the Florida Board of Governors for any direction on this topic,” she said.Mariana Castro, an undocu-
mented immigrant from Peru, said she hopes to find direction from the government.
Castro, a 19-year-old neu-
robiological sciences freshman, said she was not anticipating the problems that would come 
after graduating high school.
“Once I started at UF, I re-
alized what a long way I had 
come, but I also realized how far behind I was,” Castro said. “Every credit hour I take is about $900.”
Castro said she is strug-
gling to pay for just one class 
a semester. A Bright Futures 
scholarship was awarded to her upon graduation from high school but was taken away once her undocumented status was taken into account.
“UF is supposed to be the 
flagship school of Florida,” Car-pio said. “This petition needs to 
pass through the university first 
before it can be passed through any state Senate. We will be go-ing to Tigert, no matter what.”
UF Student Government is 
sponsoring the UF Immigra-tion Reform Symposium on Thursday, which will feature a conversation with Sen. Darren 
Soto and Sen. Dwight Bullard 
about the importance of tuition equality for undocumented students.
“Right now, there is no 
policy regarding immigration or tuition equity for students,” said Liana Guerra, a 20-year-old political science and eco-
nomics junior. “It’s important 
to start at UF with this peti-tion, but ultimately, we want to make changes in the state legislature.”Groups push for UF

� SHE IS BEING SUED BY ZENAIDA GONZALEZ, 
WHO CLAIMS SHE WAS DEFAMED.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
ORLANDO — Casey Anthony’s attorneys are 
trying to block her from giving a deposition for a 
woman who claims the Florida mother defamed her.
Anthony’s attorneys filed a motion late last 
week asking a judge in her Tampa bankruptcy case to stop the deposition, claiming they weren’t properly given notice and that the woman’s claim lacks merit.
Anthony is scheduled to give the deposition on 
Wednesday to Zenaida Gonzalez’s attorneys.
Anthony told detectives that a baby sitter 
named Zenaida Gonzalez kidnapped her 2-year-old daughter Caylee while the detectives were 
investigating the girl’s 2008 disappearance. Anthony 
was acquitted in 2011 of murdering her daughter.
Gonzalez claims in a state lawsuit that she 
was defamed by those statements and should be considered a creditor in Anthony’s federal bankruptcy case.In the motion, Anthony’s attorneys claim 
Gonzalez is on a “quest for publicity” and that she is “a principal orchestrator of the media circus” surrounding Anthony.
Moreover, Anthony already has been deposed 
in state court and she would assert her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, her attorney, David Schrader, said in the motion.
“Although Gonzalez’ counsel has repeatedly told 
the press and other that his goal in this case is to ‘break Ms. Anthony’s story,’ he will not do so and should not be allowed to put Ms. Anthony through another argumentative and abusive proceeding ...” Schrader said.
Gonzalez’s attorney, Matt Morgan, said in an 
email that Anthony should be held accountable 
under the law like any other defendant in a civil 
lawsuit.
“We know she doesn’t want to answer, that 
doesn’t mean she shouldn’t have to,” Morgan said.Casey Anthony’s deposition debatedCAMPUS

The UF Model United Nations 
visited the Big Apple and came back 
with a big prize.
The eight-student UF MUN team 
took home Best Small Delegation 
and six individual awards at the 
Columbia Model United Nations in New York competition held last week.
The conference is one of the most 
competitive crisis-style conventions on the circuit, and UF’s team com-peted against more than 30 schools from all over the country, said politi-
cal science senior Christopher Joyce, 
22, UF MUN president. 
At the conference, the delegates 
simulated crisis scenarios while as-suming the role of fictional and his-torical characters. Joyce said attend-ing the conference is about $150 to $250 out-of-pocket for students, and Student Government reimburses a portion of that amount.
UF MUN beat the Florida In-
ternational University Model UN team, who won Best Small Delega-tion last year and was its biggest 
competition, said Troy Robinson, a 
21-year-old political science and his-tory senior.
“We were going into the compe-
tition with the express goal of com-ing back with a delegation award,” said Robinson, vice president of ex-ternal affairs. 
Joyce said Best Small Delegation 
is one of the most prestigious awards a traveling team can win. 
“We’re finally going to get some 
recognition on the circuit,” he said. UF Model UN wins

Some UF women could leave 
college with lower self-conﬁ  dence 
than they had as freshmen.
Despite high academic achieve-
ment among most of the female 
students surveyed at Boston Col-
lege, a weaker sense of self-esteem was reported, especially compared to many male students, including those with lower GPAs.
Some of the contributing factors 
to lower levels of self-conﬁ  dence mentioned by the female students included pressure to have a perfect body image, hookup culture rather than commitment culture and ﬁ  nd-ing roommates year-to-year.
Michael Murphy, a psychologist 
at UF’s Counseling & Wellness Cen-
ter, said he thinks the study is rel-
evant to colleges everywhere.
“One of the things that hap-
pens during the college years is that there’s a sense of developing that identity, and there’s a lot of pres-sure that goes along with that,” he said.
Murphy also said he thinks 
women are under an extra amount of scrutiny when it comes to their post-college plans.
“Women are expected to think of 
multiple things, and I would think that could be an especially daunt-ing task, especially if it doesn’t look like you’re going to get the job you wanted, or if you’re not paired off 
with somebody,” Murphy said.
The study gathered information 
from a survey administered at fresh-
man orientation and from a senior exit survey. Boston College’s Ofﬁ  ce of Institutional Research, Planning & Assessment was able to track spe-ciﬁ  c students over the course of four years and see how their responses to 
questions like “What do you think 
of your academic achievement?” and “How would you rate your drive to succeed?” changed.
But Courtney McKenna said she 
doesn’t relate.
The 20-year-old UF telecommu-
nication junior said she has used the social and academic pressures of 
college to her beneﬁ  t.
“I feel like since freshman year, 
my conﬁ  dence has grown more and 
more each year,” McKenna said. “I’m more conﬁ  dent as a person, as a student and what I want to do with my future.”Women

  Call Tyler Murphy a ‘game man-
ager.’ The redshirt junior is not of-
fended. 
  Neither is his coach, Will Mus-
champ. To them, the phrase “game 
manager” implies a quarterback who 
moves the football, converts third downs and puts his team in a posi-tion to win.
  “That’s one of the greatest compli-
ments you can have as a quarterback, ‘is a game manager,’” Muschamp said. “A guy that does what he’s sup-posed to do. I don’t know where that 
became a bad word in the coaching 
profession, but that’s what I think anyways.”
  Muschamp mentioned Tom Brady 
as a game manager while describing Murphy after No. 17 Florida defeated Arkansas on Saturday. Brady, who is likely a ﬁ  rst-ballot Hall of Famer, does what the third-year coach wants 
from all of his quarterbacks — main-
tain complete control of the game at all times.
  Since taking over for an injured 
Jeff Driskel during the ﬁ  rst quar-ter against Tennessee, Murphy has looked the part of Muschamp’s ideal game manager. He addressed the me-
dia on Monday wearing a gray Nike 
Dri-FIT shirt with “CONSISTENCY” written across his chest. Considering his play during the past three weeks, he could not have picked more ap-propriate attire. 
  Murphy has completed 72 percent 
of his passes while tossing ﬁ  ve touch-downs and just one interception. He 
is third in the Southeastern Confer-
ence in passing efﬁ  ciency behind LSU’s Zach Mettenberger and Texas A&M’s Johnny Manziel. 
  Alabama quarterback A.J. McCa-
rron, who Murphy said he attempts to emulate on the ﬁ  eld, is seventh in the conference in passing efﬁ  ciency. Murphy considers McCarron the per-fect game manager. 
PHILBUSTER
  One minute he is a teddy bear. The next he becomes 
a grizzly bear. 
  The juxtaposition of emotions shown by Dante 
Fowler Jr. is the most enjoyable part of the Gators this sea-
son. 
  Fowler, a sophomore Buck linebacker, became the lead-
er of Florida’s defense when Dominique Easley was lost for 
the season due to a knee injury suffered while practicing prior to a matchup with Kentucky. 
  All Fowler has done in the two games since the Gators 
lost Easley is total nine tackles, including three for a loss, and notch two sacks. 
For the season, Fowler leads the team with seven tack-les for a loss, three sacks and two forced fumbles. 
  But the most refreshing part of 
Fowler is his willingness to be can-
did with the media at all times. 
  Fowler was disappointed with 
his performance during Florida’s 
21-16 loss to Miami on Sept. 7. Rath-
er than cower from the press, he spoke openly and honestly about wanting to play better and live up to the expectations placed on him. 
  When he won Southeastern Conference Defensive Play-
er of the Week on Sept. 23 after thoroughly dismantling the entire Tennessee offense, he shared with us his joy in begin-ning to realize his immense talents. 
  Fowler is open and he is honest. He is breathtakingly 
gifted. And best of all, he’s enjoying it. 
  “Look at me, I’m smiling right now,” he said Monday. “I 
like to play around and stuff. I just turned 19, so I try to live life. I’m still a kid. I’m not 21 yet. My mom still washes my clothes and things like that.”
  Fowler’s playfulness is not just a joy to the media; he lifts 
the spirits of his teammates and coaches on a daily basis. 
  When Easley was injured and could no longer travel 
with the team, it was Fowler who ensured his Chucky doll Sophomore linebacker becoming most fun aspect of Gators

   Florida will face an explosive offense against LSU on 
Saturday in Baton Rouge, La.
  With offensive coordinator Cam Cameron at the helm, 
the Tigers rank third in the Southeastern Conference with 
45.5 points per game — a touchdown better than any other offense under Les Miles at LSU. Quarterback Zach Metten-berger ranks third in the SEC with 289.7 passing yards per 
game and leads the conference with 15 touchdown passes.
  Should Saturday’s contest simply come 
down to which team’s offense can put 
more points on the board, coach Will Mus-champ would be OK with that.
  “As long as we win, I don’t care,” the ﬁ  -
ery, third-year coach said. “Honestly. I got real caught up in all that stuff when I was a coordinator. When I’m a head coach, I 
want to win. If it takes 51-50, let’s go.”
  When asked if he could physically handle that signiﬁ  cant 
of a breakdown defensively, Muschamp began laughing.
  “Winning is all that matters,” he said.  Muschamp’s players aren’t so sure he would survive an 
offensive shootout. Buck linebacker Dante Fowler Jr. said winning a game like that wouldn’t make things much bet-ter for the defense.
  “I’d have nightmares,” Fowler said of the hypothetical. 
“I’d be scared. I don’t even know how he would physically handle that. I honestly don’t know what would happen. I wouldn’t want it, though.”
  Defensive tackle Darious “Bear” Cummings added: 
“We’re going to get chewed out about the 50 points. But a 
win is a win here.”
Revenge on their minds: The last time the Gators trav-
eled to Tiger Stadium, they left with their tails between their 
legs. The 41-11 defeat came on the heels of a 38-10 blowout LSU poses 
challenge to 
stout UF defense Murphy enjoying ‘game manager’ title
“That’s one of the greatest 
compliments you can have 
as a quarterback, ‘is a game 
manager.’”

 Alligator Staff Writer @chuckkingsbury
  With Week 5 of the NFL season in 
the books, we take a look at a few former 
Gators who made the most tangible im-
pact for their respective teams.  
  Brandon Spikes, linebacker: Even 
without the gap-eating Vince Wilfork commanding double teams, the New 
England Patriots are developing a successful defense. 
  That would not be possible without 
middle linebacker Brandon Spikes.
  The former All-American has seen 
an increased role with Wilfork side-lined due to an ACL injury. 
  Spikes is an excellent run defend-
er. He understands run ﬁ  ts well, and with his ability to stack and shed blockers quickly and efﬁ  ciently, he continues to be a force against oppos-ing running attacks.  
  In 2013, Spikes has totaled 25 
tackles, including two for a loss. But where he made the biggest impact on Sunday against the Bengals came in 
pass coverage. 
  Arguably his biggest knock enter-
ing the pros, Spikes has been a liabil-
ity defending the pass. He is often sidelined against multiple-receiver 
sets in favor of New England’s nickel 
defense or for a more agile, coverage-friendly linebacker. 
  But against the Bengals, Spikes 
shined in coverage, intercepting his ﬁ  rst pass of the season and adding   seven total tackles as the Patriots’ de-
fense surrendered just 13 points. 
Carlos Dunlap, defensive end:
New England has been touted for its 
play on the offensive line, but on Sun-day it failed to hold against a clearly 
superior, aggressive Cincinnati Ben-
gals defensive line led by Carlos Dun-lap.
  The Bengals put constant pressure 
on Tom Brady, sacking the quarter-back, pressing the pocket and forcing the veteran to throw from uncomfort-able angles.   But Dunlap’s impact was felt in 
the run game.
  The 6-foot-6, 280-pound defensive 
end ﬂ  ashed great disengagement to make tackles and made urgent plays when the Bengals’ offense failed to 
build steady drives. 
  In the second quarter of Sunday’s 
game, Dunlap forced a fumble on a 
would-be scoring drive for the Patri-
ots. 
  Not coincidentally, the Patriots 
failed to enter the end zone for the 
ﬁ  rst time since a loss to the Jets in 2009.  
    Joe Haden, cornerback: A week 
after getting the best of one of the league’s premier receivers, Cincinna-ti’s AJ Green, Joe Haden was equal-
ly dominant during the Cleveland 
Browns’ win over the Buffalo Bills on Thursday night. 
  Buffalo’s leading receiver, Stevie 
Johnson, was held in check by the for-
mer Gator, catching just two passes 
for 19 yards before exiting the game in the second quarter with an injury.  Rookie Robert Woods was the next 
man up in Johnson’s absence, and Haden shadowed the Southern Cali-fornia standout in man-to-man on oc-casion. 
Woods ﬁ  nished with ﬁ  ve catches 
for 64 yards. 
  Haden totaled just three tackles 
and a pass deﬂ  ection in the game but has been as suffocating as any other 
cornerback in the league through ﬁ  ve 
games. 
    News and notes: Eighteen former 
Gators were active Week 5 of the NFL season.
A few weeks after tweaking his 
ankle, San Francisco 49ers lineback-er Ray McDonald was dealt another blow. Playing the Texans on Sunday, 
the left defensive end injured his right 
biceps and missed the remainder of the game. 
Miami Dolphins rookie kicker Ca-
leb Sturgis missed his ﬁ  rst ﬁ  eld goal 
attempt of the season — a 57-yarder 
— that would have tied the game for Miami late in the fourth quarter.14, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, OCTOBER 8, 2013

 Silvia Colussi-Pelaez has been a Gator for fewer 
than two months, but she is already making world 
history.  
  Colussi-Pelaez, a Canadian and Spanish dual 
citizen, became the ﬁ  rst gymnast to successfully ex-ecute a sideways side aerial during a balance beam routine at the 2013 World Artistic Gymnastic Cham-
pionships in Antwerp, Belgium. 
For that, the skill will be named after her.
  “We give her a tremendous amount of credit for 
just sticking with this skill, as difﬁ  cult as it is,” coach Rhonda Faehn said. “It’s really exciting.”
  In the sideways side aerial, gymnasts land within 
the four-inch width of the balance beam instead of the lengthwise landing that is traditionally associ-ated with the balance beam jump. 
  To have a skill named after you, a gymnast must 
be the ﬁ  rst to successfully complete it at World 
Championships or Olympics. From there, the Fed-
eration of International Gymnastics review the skill and the gymnast’s choice of name for it.  
  Faehn said Colussi-Pelaez, who was competing 
for Spain when she completed the sideways side aerial, has been practicing the skill for the past year.
  Colussi-Pelaez returned to Gainesville Monday, 
but do not expect to see her signature skill in the 
O’Connell Center anytime soon. 
  “To be honest, I’m more conservative of a coach,” 
Faehn said. 
“If I didn’t let Cory Hartung (a 2009 UF graduate 
who practiced the skill), I probably won’t let Silvia 
do it as well … in college, our code is different, so it’s a little too risky.”  Florida gymnast

 Haden impressing as lockdown cornerback  “I try to copycat A.J. McCarron a 
little bit,” Murphy said. “He does a 
great job managing the game and tak-ing what the defense gives him. His third year being the starter, he’s mak-
ing a lot of plays and put the team on 
his back a few times.”
  McCarron returned for his senior 
season in pursuit of a third-straight national championship. At a school that has boasted quarterbacks Joe Na-math and Kenny Stabler, McCarron might outshine them all when his col-lege career is ﬁ  nished.
  He’s already the Alabama career 
touchdown leader and has a realistic shot at breaking most of the school’s remaining 10 passing records. 
  Murphy is in a much different 
situation than McCarron, but he has received plenty of support from his teammates. 
  “He’s doing an awesome job. He 
keeps a positive attitude on the side-lines,” senior Solomon Patton said. “If we come out without scoring, or a turnover, he deﬁ  nitely comes and com-municates with us and makes sure we don’t drop our heads and (makes sure we) stay on the right track.”
  Does Murphy ﬁ  nd it odd he is em-
ulating an opposing quarterback — one that stands as a likely obstacle to an SEC Championship? Not at all, he said. The results speak for themselves.
  “Any time there’s a guy with sev-
eral rings on his ﬁ  nger, he’s doing something right,” Murphy said. “A.J. has been doing a great job. Hopefully, 
I would like to be a national champion 
and win some SEC championships. He has been winning, so whatever he’s doing, he has been doing it right. I’m trying to ﬁ  gure out what he’s do-ing and copy what he’s doing well.” Murphy admires McCarron
continued making trips with the 
team to honor Easley, who is his 
teammate, but more importantly, 
his friend. 
  He even puts a smile on the face 
of coach Will Muschamp, who is generally known as the ﬁ  ercest man on the UF campus. But how could you not love Fowler, espe-cially when it’s not your backﬁ  eld he is blowing up. 
  “Dante has a great personal-
ity,” Muschamp said. 
“He’s a lot of fun to be around 
and coach. He’s a joy to coach. He’s always got a smile on his face.” 
  So how does a fun-loving 
19-year-old transform into a ter-rorizing ﬁ  gure with the mean 
streak of a junkyard dog on the 
ﬁ  eld? 
  “As soon as I wake up on Satur-
day, it’s game time,” Fowler said. “I’m locked in and focused.” 
  Through two seasons, a locked-in Fowler has become a bigger nightmare than the thought of 
facing Muschamp after missing a 
defensive assignment against an SEC opponent. 
  He is powerfully athletic and 
stunningly quick for someone who is 6-foot-3 and 266 pounds. His ability to read and diagnose plays in a split second is nothing short of amazing. 
  Next time you watch Fowler 
dominate an opposing offensive front, think about his mom still doing his laundry and his team-mates watching him tote that doll everywhere he goes.
  If we can enjoy Fowler even 
half as much as he enjoys being 
himself, everyone will be a little 
happier.  TUESDAY, OCTOBER 8, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 15

loss to Alabama and was the 
second of four straight losses for Florida in 2011.
  Several upperclassmen 
have redemption in mind for this weekend’s matchup.
  “It was deﬁ  nitely a low 
point in most of our careers here,” senior defensive back Jaylen Watkins said. “It was deﬁ  nitely a bad taste in our mouth.”
  Redshirt junior quarter-
back Tyler Murphy added: “It was tough. We really had a good week of practice, and 
we felt very conﬁ  dent. To 
come out with a loss, it hurt. Especially after losing to Alabama. I thought we gave a great effort. We probably 
didn’t execute the way we should have. But I thought 
we played hard.”
  Muschamp mentioned last 
season how he addressed the 
team following that 30-point 
loss to the Tigers in the locker room. He told his players not to forget the disappointment 
of the defeat. When Mus-
champ enters Tiger Stadium on Saturday, he’ll remember.
  “If you’re a competitor, 
it should,” Muschamp said of the 2011 loss serving as motivation. “And I know 
we have a bunch of competi-
tive guys in the locker room. Sometimes, some people don’t get motivated by nega-tives. They don’t want to think about negatives. They 
want to think about positive 
things. So, I think everybody 
is motivated differently, but 
most of the guys I’ve been around certainly will use that. I will.”

Loucheiz Purifoy was named the Southeastern Conference Defensive Player of the Week, the league ofﬁ  ce announced 
Monday. Purifoy returned 
his ﬁ  rst career interception 
for a touchdown, forced a 
fumble and recorded four 
tackles, three pass breakups and his ﬁ  rst career sack.
  “Purifoy is a playmak-
er,” Fowler said. “He’s just a baller overall. He’s a very good player. It was a long time coming for him to make plays like that.”

  Pamela Begic’s status is still unknown. 
After falling to the ground while scoring a goal against 
Auburn on Sunday, Begic’s health is still being evaluated, coach Becky Burleigh said at Monday’s All-Sports Press Conference.
  Burleigh said Begic’s goal was the best she has seen 
all season.
  “People were ﬁ  red up; I was really ﬁ  red up,” Burleigh 
said. 
“She pretty much launched herself at that ball. She 
knew she was going to get hammered when she hit that ball.”
  Burleigh said Begic is an example of what the team has 
to do on the ﬁ  eld going forward.
  “Even when she’s laying on the ground, players were 
coming up to her and being like ‘That was just so tough,’” she said. 
  “That is a pure demonstration of what we were just 
talking about. If we’re not willing to go after that ball, we’re not going to score a goal there. She was willing to do it, and that takes a lot of courage.”
  Ending the weekend with a 3-0 shutout against Au-
burn was the remedy Florida was looking for after a 2-1 
double-overtime loss against South Carolina on Friday.
  The Gators have gone “soft” in terms of toughness and 
aggression since Southeastern Conference play began, se-nior midﬁ  elder Caroline Triglia said Sunday.
  “We know that now we have to hold our future,” 
Triglia said. 
  “The destiny is in our hands. We can’t lose anymore. 
We can’t tie. [Sunday’s] win was huge and was neces-
sary.”
  The Gators ended SEC regular season play 11-2 in 
2012. Florida has two SEC losses already this season, the ﬁ  rst coming to Missouri on Sept. 29.
  “We know we can come back and win it,” freshman 
midﬁ  elder Liz Slattery said of the SEC regular season ti-tle. “This just pushes us forward. We got to go from now. We can’t lose again. We’re going to do it.”
  Burleigh said Begic is an example of how the team 
needs to play aggressively on the ﬁ  eld.
  She said communication is a given, but the importance 
lies on toughness and execution. 
“Those are two kind of opposite things,” Burleigh 
said.   “We’re asking to play a lot of emotion when we’re playing defense and being tough, but then we’re asking to play with a lot of composure on execution. Flipping that switch is where we’ve got to get to. We’re not quite there yet.”
  Sunday was the start of the direction the Gators are 
trying to go in, and Burleigh said they have talked about their ultimate goal. Now, UF has to turn those words into actions.
  “Talk is pretty cheap,” Burleigh said. “It’s about going 
out there and showing it.” 16, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, OCTOBER 8, 2013

� MANN HAS .531 HITTING PERCENTAGE.
  JONATHAN CZUPRYN
 Alligator Writer @jczupryn
  Chloe Mann’s name has been inked in the 
NCAA’s record books since her sophomore 
campaign. 
  Her .900 hitting percentage against LSU on 
Nov. 11, 2011, was the second highest clip in 
NCAA history for players with 20 or more at-
tacks in a match.
  Now a senior and two years removed from 
her breakout performance, Mann remains the go-to offensive threat for coach Mary Wise and the No. 2 Gators.
  The 6-foot-2 middle blocker hit .402 through 16 matches in 2012 en route to her 
ﬁ  rst Southeastern Conference Player of the 
Year award and All-American honors.
  Mann’s season average is currently .531, 
which is the second highest efﬁ  ciency in the nation.
  “She’s right in a situation where she may 
end her career with the best hitting percent-age of any Division I player,” Wise said. “In her position, her offensive numbers are elite.”
  During the weekend, the Gainesville na-
tive recorded 23 kills and no errors for a .697 clip. 
  On Sunday against Alabama, Mann’s .737 
hitting percentage helped then-No. 3 Florida record a .529 efﬁ  ciency, which was the third highest clip in a single match in program his-tory.
  With Mann leading the charge, the Gators, 
who are hitting .349 as a team, are on pace to break the .332 team record set in 2003. 
That year, Florida 
went to its ﬁ  rst and only national cham-pionship.
  “For Chloe Mann 
to be hitting over [.600] in two matches, it just 
isn’t done,” Wise said. “You’ve got to remem-
ber that hitting efﬁ  ciency is like baseball hit-ting percentage. If you get a hitter that was hitting .700 over two league matches, how impressive is that?”
  And while most of her teammates started 
playing volleyball before high school, Mann didn’t take the court until her freshman year 
at Eastside High.
  “Starting late, I thought it would put me at 
a disadvantage,” Mann said. “But I’m really 
happy with the progression that I feel like I made just based off my coaches, training and the help of all my teammates.”
  Although Kelly Murphy never played 
middle blocker while at UF from 2008-2011, Wise said the two All-Americans have one 
skill in common, which has made them two 
of Florida’s top volleyball players of all time.
  “One thing they do have in common is 
great hitter vision,” Wise said. “They see the block well and have the ability to hit balls around the block. As Kelly (left her mark), Chloe obviously will as well.”  Senior middle blocker pacing potent Florida offensive attack
