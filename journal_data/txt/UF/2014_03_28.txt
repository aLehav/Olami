David Carlson was ready to go 
to court.
His boss owed him $200 from his 
part-time job, but the 26-year-old UF 
law student said it was the principle 
that mattered: He and his ﬁ  ancee 
had worked for their money, and they didn’t have it. “I would still be working at Shar-
ab if they were paying me,” Carlson said. “It was a job worth having.” 
If the Alachua County Wage 
Recovery Program hadn’t helped, Carlson said he was prepared to 
try small claims. But it did, and he 
said his past few grocery trips were ﬁ  nanced by his old bouncer job at Sharab Lounge, a local nightclub on South Main Street. Three former employees, includ-
ing two UF students, ﬁ  led wage-theft complaints with Alachua County’s Equal Opportunity Ofﬁ  ce in Febru-ary after quitting Sharab and never receiving the money owed to them. 
Together, the debt totaled more than 
$2,000. Through the wage-recovery program, all employees have re-ceived their money, with the last complaint settled March 21. Shimal Patel, a supervisor at 
Sharab Lounge and the man accused of withholding the paychecks, said problems with workers stemmed from putting credit card tips on em-ployees’ paychecks. Before, every-
one got tips in cash at the end of the 
night.
The 28-year-old said he can’t call 
himself the owner — the club is run by his family and owned by the Bora Bora Club.
The complaints were settled by 
private negotiations through the of-ﬁ  ce. Patel said he vows not to give up on the business, and some cur-rent employees are still working 
to get “caught up.”  But his former 
workers have been “taken care of.”

As negotiations between 
Citizens Co-op management 
and workers who want to 
unionize continue, a licensed 
mediator was called in Thursday afternoon to help both sides cooperate. 
On the brick patio 
courtyard behind the grocery store, co-op board members as well as current and former employees sat in a ring 
around a long table. 
Jeffrey Weisberg, a 
mediator with River Phoenix 
Center for Peacebuilding 
in Gainesville, asked both 
parties what success would look like for them, and he asked them to identify the core issues at play in the 
situation.
Each of the ﬁ  red 
employees present at the 
meeting emphasized that 
they want to see the co-op 
succeed. 
Right now, management 
and workers just don’t see eye to eye on how to 
accomplish that.
Lisa McNett, the store 
general manager who made 
the recent decision to ﬁ  re the ﬁ  ve workers, was unclear about whether she would be 
willing to rehire them and 
acknowledge the union. 
For now, she said she’s 
looking for an apology regarding unauthorized 
emails sent from the co-op 
account to its members. 
She asked the group 
for “acknowledgment 
that perhaps it wasn’t the 
wisest decision,” and for clariﬁ  cation about some accusations made in the emails about bad business 
practices.
“I feel this week I’ve been 
under personal attack, and 
I don’t know how to move 
beyond that,” McNett said.
She said she was referring 
to a ﬂ  ier employees have 
been passing out that urges customers to confront 
McNett directly. 
She also cited more than

Tuition and baby Gators were 
among topics discussed in UF Board 
of Trustees committee meetings Thursday.
Although undocumented stu-
dents’ ﬁ  ght to qualify for in-state tuition has captured the attention of Florida residents and news outlets, the House and Senate versions of bill have caveats that could affect all UF students.
The tuition differential — the 
maximum amount tuition can be increased per year — could be re-duced from 15 percent to 6 percent, said University Relations Vice Presi-dent Jane Adams. That could mean less revenue for the university, but it’s not a major concern because the state is expected to give UF money for projects like the Newell Hall re-
vamp.
“President (Bernie) Machen’s po-
sition on tuition differential has been: 
It’s great to have it there, in case we need to use it, but the amount that we need to charge for tuition de-pends upon the amount of aid that 
the state gives us,” Adams said.
The state-mandated annual in-
ﬂ  ation adjustment — which raised 
tuition 1.7 percent last year — could also be eliminated.
In a separate meeting, Vice Presi-
dent for Enrollment Management and Associate Provost Zina Evans gave data about UF’s new freshmen. 
Decisions came out Feb. 14. 
UF admitted almost 13,000 peo-
ple. Their average GPA was 4.4 and 
average SAT score 1960. UF trustees talk tuition, admissions

� FANS FOCUS ON COMPETITION.
LYNNA LAWRENCE
Alligator Contributing Writer 
Putting money on March Madness 
brackets may make fans go a little bit mad-
der, experts say.
Betting on the games can reduce enjoy-
ment for spectators, said Yong Jae Ko, a 
UF associate professor in the Department 
of Tourism, Recreation and Sport Manage-ment.
The NCAA Tournament is one of the 
most popular tournaments in the sports gambling industry, he said. Many people create brackets that predict the matchup for each tournament game, the overall winner and the ﬁ  nal score.
But Ko said there is a difference be-
tween fans who watch for fun and fans who watch for competition.
“When you increase your betting mon-
ey, the enjoyment, fun aspect decreases,” Ko said.
Making brackets can lead fans to focus on the competition aspect rather than re-laxing and enjoying the game, he said. He recommended that students separate these dimensions while watching the Gators.
Jonathan Arnholz, a 20-year-old UF 
public relations sophomore, is the vice president of the Men’s Basketball Rowdies. 
He said that bracket expectations have al-
ready lowered with the ﬁ  rst two rounds of highly unpredictable outcomes and up-sets, so most are just participating for fun and hoping that their friends’ brackets are worse than their own.
“Everybody’s expecting their bracket 
to get busted,” he said.
Caitlin McVeigh, a 21-year-old UF ac-
counting junior, makes a bracket annu-ally to bet against her brother. Betting low amounts of money still allows her to enjoy the games, McVeigh said.
“I’m very risk-averse, so the more mon-
ey, the more scared I would be,” she said.
Ko said he is more interested in watch-
ing the games with his friends and family.
“Sport consumption is a social function, 
so winning and losing is not everything,” he said. “It’s all about the memories.”Brackets take fun out of gameLOCAL

This morning, cyclists will cruise around 
the corner of Southwest Second Avenue in a 
synchronized line toward Volta Coffee, Tea and Chocolate. By the end of their ride, cy-clists will be ready for a caffeine ﬁ  x.
The Swift-Volta ride will be every Friday 
through October leaving at 7:30 a.m. from Swift Cycle, 607 W. University Ave. The ride passes by Newnans Lake, returns following the Gainesville-Hawthorne Trail and ﬁ  nishes at Volta, 48 SW Second St.
Keith Richards, co-owner of Swift Cycle 
and an organizer of the ride, said the partner-ship was a logical one for many reasons.
“Really, bikes and coffee just go so well 
together,” he said. 
The ride spans about 23 miles, and the 
pace is about 15-18 mph, Richards said.
“We wanted something that had a little bit 
of distance to it but was still fairly safe,” he said, “and also short enough so it wouldn’t be intimidating to people who haven’t really done a lot of group rides before.”
The ride has a no-drop policy, which means if a rider has a bike issue or falls be-hind, some of the group will stay back.
“If someone isn’t able to keep up with the 
pace, we aren’t going to leave them some-where out in the middle of Hawthorne,” he said.
Cyclists on the Swift-Volta ride receive 
a 10-percent discount off their purchase at 
Volta.
“It is something to show we appreciate 
Swift Cycle choosing us as the location of the 
end of the bike ride,” said Kelsie Stewart, a 27-year-old Volta barista.
Arthur Rosales, 27, had an espresso after 
taking his Cannondale Caad8 road bike on the ride.
“Its nice to ride with a group of compan-
ions,” he said while eating a Volta quiche. “It wasn’t a super athletic ride. It was leisurely, and you could enjoy the scenery. It was peaceful.”Bicyclists ride together to

UF may be climbing the ranks to pre-
eminence, but Business Insider is now 
recognizing UF students at the national 
level as some of the brightest in the coun-
try.
On Monday, Business Insider released 
a ranking of the top 20 colleges with the 
smartest student populations. UF was 
ranked No. 20.
By using data put together by Niche, 
a college-ranking database based on stu-dent surveys and other factors, Business Insider combined the data of the smartest guys and girls to make its rankings.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando said that 
although he questions the validity of the surveys, he thinks UF has some of the best students in the country. He believes the numbers back it up.
For the incoming Fall class of 2014, the 
average GPA was 4.4, and the average SAT score was 1960.
Orlando said what separates UF is 
the “competitiveness factor.” This year, out of more than 29,000 applicants, only about 13,000 were accepted.
“We unfortunately have to turn away 
lots and lots of highly qualiﬁ  ed students,” he said. “The ones that are actually ac-cepted are the cream of the crop.”
Orlando said there are some great 
schools on the list, but he believes UF should be ranked higher.
UF at No. 20 and New College of Flor-
ida at No. 9 were the only two schools 
from Florida on the list. 
But Kevin Lin, a 20-year-old UF 
chemical engineering junior, said he was 
somewhat surprised that UF even made 
the list.
“I am a bit surprised, considering all of 
the very prominent and elite schools out 
there,” he said. “However, I think this is a good sign that UF is becoming one of the 
academically elite schools in the nation.”
Orlando said he didn’t think that this 
ranking would noticeably affect applica-
tions.
“Students and parents look at lots of 
different rankings, and there are lots of different rankings out there,” he said. “It sure can’t hurt.”UF students ranked among 
brightest in country

• It is important for students to learn how 
to combat stress and anxiety. A lot of it 
has to do with the student’s perception of the source of anxiety.• Students can do things like yoga and exercise to help keep stress and anxiety levels low. He also said that it is important for students to eat and get plenty of sleep.  “We unfortunately have to

The Norman Hall bike tunnel was graffiti-free — 
for less than 24 hours.
The bike tunnel, commonly known as the graf-
fiti tunnel, was whitewashed Monday evening by 
UF’s Grounds Department in the Physical Plant Di-
vision.
However, a new student organization, Humons, 
was one of the first groups of artists to paint the tun-nel’s wall.
Humons is a group that encourages people to ex-
press their individuality through their passions in 
things like art and music.
Danny Fry, president of Humons, and Tyler Burris, treasurer of Humons, spent about one hour 
painting. 
First, they painted a black background. Then they 
spray-painted white stencil letters: “Before I gradu-
ate, I want to…” They drew lines directly beneath the phrase for students to fill in with chalk.
“It’s the idea of using art for a purpose,” said Fry, 
a 22-year-old UF criminology senior. “I’d say it’s fostering imagination, creativity and spontaneity.”
Fry and Burris said Humons hopes to spread its 
theme of oneness at the college level through this 
street art.
“Honestly, these are our generation’s next bright-
est minds,” said Burris, a 22-year-old UF criminol-
ogy senior. “When you make an impression at this 
level, it’s going to last for decades.”FRIDAY, MARCH 28, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Mary Coursen said she let her 
fiance, David Carlson, do most of 
the talking. He’s “a lot bigger and scarier than me,” she said. 
The couple started contacting Pa-
tel to get their money since they quit in mid-December. Before Carlson found the Alachua County Wage Recovery program online, the two had faced a round of insufficient funds checks as well as ignored texts and phone calls that went straight to voicemail. Sharab Lounge owed her about $700, she said. 
Coursen, a UF graduate student 
in exercise physiology, worked part-time as a bartender.
She started out at Sharab in sum-
mer 2012, back when her former roommate, Misty, was bar manager and later, general manager. Opera-tions seemed normal, the liquor li-cense was up-to-date, and employ-
ees were given paychecks on time. 
But when Misty left in 2013, Patel 
and a friend took over — and later 
took the reins alone.  
For the first month, Coursen  
thought things would work out. But soon things got out of hand.
“It was an absolute free-for-all,” 
Coursen said. “You came when you wanted, left when you wanted. Peo-ple were wasted on the job.”
When the pay became irregular, 
she said she didn’t worry. Patel had a system. He wrote down all of the debts. He spoke of business ventures in the works. He told many stories, and Coursen said she believed them in the beginning.
By the end of summer 2013, her 
checks started to bounce, and soon, no checks came at all. If she made $300 in one night, she might end the night with $100 in her hand.
“They had to give us cash at the 
end of the night to keep us appeased, I guess,” Coursen said. “It was never what we were fully owed.”
Avery Bender, the final wage-
theft applicant, was owed about $1,500.
Bender said she has worked at 
places all over town, including Salty Dog, Mother’s and Boca Fiesta. The 27-year-old has clocked in seven 
years of experience in the field.She stopped getting paychecks 
in October 2012 but would get “$50 
bucks here or there.”
“They kind of play dumb, but I 
know that they know what they’re doing,” Bender said. “They’re just trying to keep something going that’s clearly not working.”
The Alachua County Wage Theft 
Recovery Program started in Janu-ary after the county’s wage-theft ordinance went into effect. Alachua County Equal Opportunity Manager Jacqueline Chung said the program has filed eight complaints so far, in-cluding Sharab’s. 
At the office, workers serve as the 
middlemen, Chung said. They alert employers of the allegations, and if they repeatedly don’t respond, the 
employee can request a hearing or 
go to small claims court.
For Sharab, a court process wasn’t 
necessary. They responded and worked out negotiations through the office without contact with the employees. 
The business has other troubles. 
Sharab Lounge has five complaints 
listed in MyFloridaLicense.com 
records starting in 2008 regarding inspection of its invoice, which is a record of what alcohol the club or-ders from distributors. Of the com-plaints, two resulted in no action, two resulted in a civil penalty and one investigation is underway.
Patel said at the lowest points 
money was tight, and he couldn’t afford to pay employees. He listed operating costs: rent, utility bills, in-
surance, Internet, cable. 
At a December staff meeting, 
Patel said he announced a return 
to the old system where employees got credit card tips at the end of the night. Things are looking up. 
But even after paying off former 
employees, Patel said he realizes a debt remains.
“They’ve been through the 
struggle with us,” he said. “This place wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for them.”shArAb , from page 1
� ALGEBRA NATION WILL EXPAND.
BRIDGET ANDERSON

A new teacher-development network is in the 
works at UF thanks to a $250,000 grant from the Bill 
and Melinda Gates Foundation.
This network will be an expansion of the UF 
Lastinger Center for Learning’s current Algebra 
Nation program, an online resource created in part-
nership with Study Edge to help Florida high school students pass the Algebra End-of-Course-Exam. 
The Algebra Nation teacher-development net-
work will feature videos of classroom instruction explaining math problems, discussion forums and lesson plans, according to a UF College of Educa-tion press release. 
Boaz Dvir, operations manager for the UF Last-
inger center, became involved with the center while working on a documentary he made, “Discovering Gloria,” about an innovative Gainesville teacher who inspired the center to craft its teacher-develop-ment programs.  
“I kind of fell in love with what they were do-
ing,” he said. “They were on the frontlines of edu-cation, helping to make a difference for high-need schools and high-poverty children.” 
Dvir was responsible for writing the grant pro-
posal to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and is focusing on the building and launching of the teacher-development network.
The Lastinger Center and Study Edge plan to 
launch the tool for teachers over summer and work to build the network during the following year.
Dvir said the No. 1 priority of the Algebra Na-
tion teacher program is to create a safe, easy-to-ac-cess virtual home environment for the teachers.
“They need a place that they can go to and feel 
safe, to interact with other teachers, to be able to ask any question they want,” he said.
Laura Bemis, a 20-year-old UF education junior, 
said it’s an honor to be a part of a college receiving a grant from such a distinguished foundation.
“Once I get in the classroom, I would definitely 
use a program like this,” she said. “I like how we would be able to share lesson plans and get ideas.”Teaching center gets Gates grantNext meeting is Sunday
to customer business accounts that she said got deleted through an 
employee email login.
“I don’t understand how any of that is in the best interest of the 
co-op they are supposedly trying to save,” she said. 
She said the criticism seemed to come out of the blue. Since she was hired as store manager in February, she would check 
in with employees and ask if everything was OK. 
She always got positive feedback — until she was handed a de-
mand letter from the unionized employees on March 11. 
The same morning, the first unauthorized email was sent out.Sylvia Arnold, a spokeswoman for the union who was recently 
fired, said “I think both sides have not been honest.”
Overall, workers and management agreed that they want to help 
the co-op grow in healthy ways, and they have that goal in common.
“I enjoyed the job, the place, many parts of the culture it cultivat-

Tensions rose this week when Citizens Co-op announced 
the ﬁ  rings of ﬁ  ve employees. According to Alligator reporting, 
the employees were dismissed after they used  the company’s email database system for personal reasons — more speciﬁ  -cally, in an effort to unionize. 
The company has seen a tumultuous past few years. Proﬁ  ts 
are down, and so a new general manager was brought in to re-vive the co-op. However, protesters of the co-op said the board hasn’t been forthcoming with information about how the new manager would be paid. They claim the workplace environ-ment at the co-op hasn’t been one of fairness and transparency, which doesn’t align with the organization’s image of a commu-nity-oriented service. On the ﬂ  ip side, the co-op’s leadership said the employees were laid off for various reasons, includ-ing their refusal to cooperate with an internal investigation of policy breach. 
A lack of communication seems to be present here. For that, 
the Gainesville Citizens Co-op receives a get-it-together-y’all 
DART this week. 
Speaking of communication: On Wednesday, a group of 
about 30 UF students along with more than 100 other Florida college students rallied in the Florida Capitol to lobby for stu-dent initiatives. 
We reported Thursday that UF students lobbied for tuition 
equity and funding for the renovation of Newell Hall, thus proving that millennials aren’t the hashtagging loafs the nation believes we are. 
A hooray-for-making-a-difference LAUREL goes to the UF 
students who rallied at the state capitol this week. 
“American Horror Story” fans were delighted this week by 
the release of information on the upcoming season “Freaks,” which will be set in the 1950s in Jupiter, Fla., a one-horse town just north of West Palm Beach. However, the show’s camp also announced that, though the show is set in Jupiter, it will be ﬁ  lmed in New Orleans. What the what?!
We get that New Orleans is a great ﬁ  lming location, but the 
real Jupiter area would be the perfect setting for AHS — and probably much cheaper to ﬁ  lm in. With so many creepy histor-ical landmarks — like the probably-haunted Trapper Nelson campground and old Dubois house — it’s practically criminal to choose New Orleans instead. 
Ryan Murphy and the AHS producers get a don’t-even-
think-about-creating-a-CGI-Jupiter-Lighthouse FLART for 
amping up South Floridians’ hopes and then immediately dashing them. 
But not all is lost. This week, the Hufﬁ  ngton Post released a 
much-better-than-Buzzfeed’s list of reasons why Florida is the best state in America. For that, we’re handing the HuffPost a 
y’all-betta-recognize LAUREL for its quality reporting. 
Go Gators!Goodbye, EndZone; hello, tidy tighty whiteys
Around the corner from my apartment, there’s 
an orange-and-blue building with mirrored windows I often use for taking selﬁ  es. By now 
you’re probably thinking, “Wow, an orange-and-blue building in Gainesville? You’ve really narrowed it down.” Or maybe you’re saying to yourself, “This girl must be so bold, just taking selﬁ  es in windows when 
there could easily be people with eyes on the other side. 
I wish I had her gall.”
Thank you, thank you very much — but actually, 
no.
Up until last month, the building that provides the 
reﬂ  ective glass was an EndZone; so needless to say, it was usually empty. Often, when I walked past, I’d won-der, “How the heck is this place still open?”
And then one day last month, while routinely joking 
that the place was being used for money laundering as I turned the corner at 12th Street and University Avenue, I saw that the header above EndZone read “closed.”
I don’t think anyone was surprised about the busi-
ness closing. Its Yelp reviews boasted bad fries and 
available parking even on gameday — a true testament 
of communal dislike, or at least avoidance — in a sports-crazed college town.
Even still, it made me kind of sad because I wouldn’t 
be able to tell my money-laundering joke anymore. It also got me thinking about what sort of establishment would occupy the space next.
And maybe it was the joke or the pile of dirty clothes 
I had waiting for me that evening, but the perfect thing 
came to mind. The former EndZone should be turned 
into a bar laundromat because that’s just what the area is missing.
When I signed the lease for my apartment, I com-
pletely overlooked the fact that the place I’d committed to living in for the next year had no washer or dryer. I ﬁ  gured I would deal with the problem when I ran out of clean clothes, and when that day came, I realized it was a much bigger problem than I 
thought it’d be.
The only laundromats I’ve 
visited in town are sketchy, 
rundown and completely out of 
the way for anyone who doesn’t 
own a car.
The space at 12th and Uni-
versity is in the perfect location. It’s between Midtown and downtown and in close proximity to campus. Not 
only would it be convenient for students but also for 
working professionals in the area. And because doing laundry is probably not the most popular thing in the world, I don’t think anyone would object to having 
drinks and food at hand as a pick-me-up.
Convenience aside, this kind of setup offers a ton of 
creative possibilities. Think names, decor and culinary 
creativity — and, obviously, the babes you would meet. 
Though I’m pretty sure the perfect bar laundromat 
name has already been taken by “The Bar of Soap” in Asheville, N.C., something like “Tidy Whiteys” or “Foam For Two” would work for the bar-meets-laun-dromat theme. 
I might be a little biased as far as my thoughts on 
the perfect use of the space since I don’t own a washer, but unless you belong to a nudist colony (in which case, I’m a little bit jealous), you’ll have to deal with washing clothes in public at one point or another, so we might as 
well make the experience as enjoyable as possible. 
If you’re reading this, feel free to move forward with 
the idea. You don’t even have to thank me; providing a 
quality establishment would be thanks enough. You’re 
welcome.

Rise to top 10
Hello Gators,
My name is Cory Yeffet,  
and I am the incoming Stu-dent Body president at UF. One of the things I hope to do 
as president is make Student 
Government as inclusive and transparent as possible. This coming year presents an ex-citing opportunity to achieve our goal of becoming a top-10 public institution, and I hope SG can continue to be part of UF’s rise to the top.
Since the election, I have 
been actively working to pre-pare for the coming year, and I am excited to announce the opening of applications for positions within the Executive Branch. During my time here at UF, I’ve seen a great num-ber of students make a lasting impact on campus, and I am looking for dedicated indi-
viduals who want to work to-
gether to strengthen the Gator Nation.
Applications can be found 
by visiting sg.uﬂ  .edu/ap-plications and clicking the “Executive” link. Position descriptions can be found by visiting sg.uﬂ  .edu/Govern-
mentBranches/Executive/
PositionDescriptions. Appli-cations are due April 4 by 4 p.m.
If there are any questions, 
feel free to reach out to me or stop by the SG ofﬁ  ce on the third ﬂ  oor of the Reitz Union.
Go Gators!
Cory Yeffet
UF Student Body presidentLetter to the EditorSometimes it’s all too easy to forget the amazing opportunities our campus and the surrounding areas of Gainesville 
have to offer. 
Case in point: A crowd gathered Monday 
at the University Auditorium to hear Laverne Cox speak as part of Pride Awareness Month.  
I wasn’t fully aware of how cool this was 
until after it already happened. Laverne Cox is a cast member on Netﬂ  ix’s acclaimed series “Orange Is The New Black.” I started the pi-lot episode a day after she spoke. Considering all the work I had to get done this week, that wasn’t a wise decision. 
The award-winning comedy-drama fol-
lows Piper Chapman, a woman who gets sen-tenced to 15 months in women’s prison for a crime she committed a decade before moving on to a quiet life in New York’s upper-middle class. It’s well known for its complex, multi-dimensional portrayals of diverse groups of female prisoners.
Laverne Cox plays one of the 
inmates. Her character is Sophia Burset, a black transgender ﬁ  re-ﬁ  ghter who ﬁ  nanced her gender 
reassignment surgery through 
credit card fraud. Even in a wom-en’s penitentiary, she struggles with others’ perceptions of her identity. Her character has been lauded for bringing an authentic portrayal of a trans woman to the screen.
Cox herself is a trans woman and advocate 
for transgender rights who’s noted for empha-
sizing important topics for the transgender 
community apart from gender reassignment surgery. Her success in acting, along with her writing and advocacy, has positioned her as an inspiring ﬁ  gure for black and transgender peo-ple — some of the most marginalized groups in society — and for anyone who believes in individual self-determination. 
She talked about her life and 
experiences as a black, trans woman and shared her hope for a society where people are free 
to deﬁ  ne themselves without the 
judgment of others, where peo-ple aren’t restricted to the limited labels they are given. 
“I am not just one,” she said, 
“and neither are you.”
Not only did she have an amazing story to 
tell and messages to pass on, she’s also a pop culture ﬁ  gure and a cast member on one of the 
most successful shows in the last year. And I 
didn’t go see her. 
The fact that I was unaware of Cox’s visit  
was entirely my fault. I didn’t see her because of my own ignorance. I wasn’t informed about what was going on around campus, and I didn’t know who Cox was until she spoke here.
We’re fortunate enough to go to school 
where more interesting things go on than homework, parties and Netﬂ  ix — not to down-play the importance of all of those things. 
On any given day, you can walk outside 
and be bombarded with information, events,  activities and weird things at a rate normally reserved for festivals and the world’s largest cities. 
Go to the Plaza of the Americas and see 
public relations representatives giving people free beef jerky and teaching them how to use lassos just a short walk away from Krishna 
lunch. Or set a world record for popping 
bubble wrap. Monday, an inspirational actress came to speak, and Thursday, so did Rob Sch-neider. This is a great place, full of wonders and opportunity waiting for you.

Rob Schneider is a long way from his 
“Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo” days.
Now that he’s older, he said, he notices 
commercials aimed toward adults more.
“What they’re all really saying is,” he said, 
“’Is your d**k no good? Try this.”
Schneider, known for his starring roles 
in “The Animal” and “The Hot Chick,” ap-peared at the Curtis M. Phillips Center Thurs-
day for the Inter-Residence Hall Association’s IRHAPalooza: A Night of Comedy. He took shots at everything from former President George W. Bush to the awkwardness of dirty talk to Florida’s terrifying swamps.
In Florida, Schneider said, you can visit 
your grandparents, go to an amusement park, see a space shuttle launch, get a hot dog served by a girl in a bikini and get eaten by an alliga-tor in a swamp.
“That’s a pretty strange combination,” he 
said.Perla Pimentel, a Phillips 
Center employee, said about 643 tickets were distributed for the show. IRHAPalooza: A Night of Comedy was the kickoff event for IRHA’s an-
nual Residence Hall Week.
“He did a good job com-
bining political issues with comedy,” said Daniella De-
Lucia, a 19-year-old UF anthropology sopho-more. “And he did a lot of jokes about Florida. Those were great.”“He definitely did his homework,” Sherry 
Matthew, a 20-year-old UF food science and human nutrition sophomore, added.
Students in the audience laughed and 
cringed as Schneider insulted the guns-rights proponents and the National Security Admin-
istration, delivered impressions of everyone 
from his Filipino mother to a Nazi. 
Before concluding his routine, he gave the 
audience some comic relief after a discussion of Zen Buddhism and the Big Bang.
“You can do it,” he bellowed into the mi-
crophone as students clapped and cheered.Rob Schneider talks Florida, dirty talk and growing olderCAMPUS

UF’s Wildlife Society chapter earned seven 
individual arts awards at Clemson Univer-
sity during the Wildlife Society Conclave last  weekend.
Nineteen UF students attended the event, 
where they participated in activities such as a knowledge-based team obstacle course, a quiz bowl, field trips, individual art project compe-titions and the opportunity to network with peers and researchers.They received four first-place awards in the 
categories of photography, free-form art, trail camera photography and orienteering.  
Team members also received two second-
place awards for drawing and manipula-tive photography and a third-place painting award.
Hunter Slade, a 21-year-old UF wildlife ecology and conservation senior, and Tiffany Oliver, a 20-year-old UF wildlife ecology and conservation senior, coordinated the event for 
the UF team.
Slade’s pottery sculpture of a turtle re-
ceived first place in free-form art.
“It was a pretty simple design, but it was 
painted well,” he said, attributing his success 
to his attention to lighting and detail in the glazing process.
The highlight of Oliver’s experience, she 
said, was a field trip that displayed nuisance-
animal trapping methods and solutions.“We got to watch a beaver dam blow up,” 
she said.
Justin VanGorder, a 26-year-old UF wild-
life ecology and conservation senior, said he 
enjoyed participating because he was able to display his knowledge in animal tracking. 
The team wore matching jorts and T-shirts 
during the team challenge event to mimic the stereotype placed on them by out-of-state stu-dents at last year’s conclave, Slade said.
“Other schools always make fun of Florida 
for our jorts and scooters,” he said. “We got a 
lot of looks, but it was just funny.”UF wildlife club wins seven awards at Clemson University

UF civil engineering students are 
participating in a regional competi-
tion to showcase the project they have invested hundreds of hours during the past year to complete.
The UF Steel Bridge Team is 
competing in the American Society of Civil Engineers’ southeast confer-ence in Tampa to qualify for the na-tional conference.   The team’s bridge, constructed 
entirely of steel, is 5 feet high and 17 feet long — one-tenth the size of an actual bridge, said team co-captain Andrew De Alba, a 23-year-old UF civil engineering senior.  
Designing the bridge took the 
group about five months, he said.
After crafting the pieces, the 
team practiced building the bridge in the fastest time possible. For two months, Kyle Willems, a 20-year-old UF civil engineering sophomore and assembly team member, practiced five hours every day. 
Last year, the team was penal-
ized for design choices that went against regulation, which kept them from qualifying for nationals. 
“We’ve put a lot of time into 
practicing, and everyone will be do-ing their best to avoid penalties,” Willems said.
De Alba said he is competing for 
a second year because it lets him ap-ply his knowledge from class on a real-life project.
“One of the most fulfilling things 
I’ve ever done is to design something on paper and see it get built exactly how I drew it up,” he said. “That is what a structural engineer does for a 
living, and having the chance to do it 
in school is incredibly rewarding.”UF bridge club competes in SEC

A new app launched last 
week could make communicat-
ing in the Swamp on gamedays a little easier. 
The new app — FireChat 
— in its “nearby” mode, does not need Internet access, Wi-Fi or Bluetooth and can exchange messages and files among users 30 feet to 100 feet apart. Anyone with an iOS 7-capable device can use the app, said Chris-tophe Daligault, vice president 
of sales and marketing for Open 
Garden Inc., the founding com-pany. The app can be used on iPhone, iPad and iPod devices, and tech websites are reporting that it’s getting 100,000 down-loads daily across the world.     
“It’s perfect for situations 
where connectivity is not great such as public transportation, outdoors, clubs, festivals and probably many campuses, too,” Daligault wrote in an email. “FireChat takes advantage of Apple’s Multipeer Connectiv-ity Framework, which is why 
iOS 7 is required.”
The app is available free on 
iOS 7 devices, and the company 
is developing a version for An-droid. 
Andrew Selepak, director of 
the masters of arts in mass com-munication in social media at UF, said the software is limited 
by the hardware.
“It’s going to be limited to 
just students with the new op-erating system,” Selepak said. 
“It’s a peer-to-peer network. The more people that can use it the better the network is.”
However, if something cata-
strophic happened, this type of  
communication can be useful, 
Selepak said — or even during a crowded game in the Swamp, where getting any kind of sig-nal can be difficult. 
A combination of Facebook 
fatigue, privacy concerns and poor connectivity on mobile de-vices is supporting the growth and success of FireChat, Dali-gault said.
“We originally designed 
FireChat for off-the-grid sce-narios, which could also in-clude emergency situations,” 
Daligault said. “...you don’t 
need to log in, messages are not stored anywhere, and when you leave the app, the message history disappears.”
Ethan Brown, a 19-year-old 
UF management freshman, said he would try the app, but only in addition to what he al-
ready uses.
“I would still use more typi-
cal means of communication,” 
he said.App allows chatting 
without Internet “We got to watch a beaver dam

Protesters march along the North Lawn Thursday demanding fair wages for Florida’s farmworkers. The group

LOS ANGELES — Arriv-
ing fashionably late, a Russian 
spacecraft carrying three astro-nauts docked with the Interna-tional Space Station Thursday 
evening 250 miles over Brazil.
The crew aboard the orbit-
ing outpost congratulated the 
latest members — Russians Alexander Skvortsov and Oleg Artemyev and NASA’s Steve Swanson.
“A ﬂ  awless approach, a 
ﬂ  awless docking,” said mis-sion control commentator Rob Navias.
The trio blasted off from Ka-
zakhstan on Wednesday local time aboard a Soyuz rocket for what was supposed to be a six-hour straight shot to the space 
station.
But an engine burn designed 
to ﬁ  netune the craft’s path did not occur as planned, delaying 
the docking.
Two rendezvous maneuvers 
were executed to put the Soyuz on course. 
The astronauts were never 
in danger. Jaunts to the space station used to take two days. 
Last year, engineers experi-
mented with a way to cut the trip down to six hours by com-pressing the number of times the Soyuz ﬁ  res its engines to raise its orbit to meet the space station.
Had the latest trip been on schedule, it would have been only the ﬁ  fth time that a crew 
would have taken the “fast 
track” route.
Engineers were investigat-
ing the snag but believe the burn didn’t occur because the Soyuz was not in the right po-sition.
The new crew, which will 
stay in orbit for six months, 
joined Japan’s Koichi Wakata, 
NASA’s Rick Mastracchio and Russia’s Mikhail Tyurin.
Since the retirement of the 
space shuttle ﬂ  eet, NASA has depended on the Russians to hitch a ride to the space station, paying nearly $71 million per seat.
Despite the frosty relation-
ship on Earth between the U.S. and Russia over the annexation of Crimea, politics has not af-fected the cooperation in space.
NASA has been working to 
develop its own space taxi to the orbiting laboratory through contracts with two private com-
panies including California-
based SpaceX founded by bil-lionaire Elon Musk.
SpaceX’s fourth supply run 
set for Sunday was postponed because of a problem at the Florida launch site. It was the second delay this month. The company said earlier it needed 
more time.
SpaceX’s unmanned capsule 
named Dragon will haul two 
tons of supplies and experi-ments. It will also deliver a pair of legs for the humanoid robot at the space station. Until now, the torso-only Robonaut has been stuck on 
a pedestal.Russian craft docks

Traditional antibiotics, it’s time 
to moo-ve over. 
UF researchers created a new 
treatment to help cattle ﬁ  ght uter-
ine diseases, which could go on to 
improve food safety.
Kwang Jeong, assistant profes-
sor in animal sciences and UF’s 
Emerging Pathogens Institute, said his team used chitosan mi-croparticles, a natural antibiotic antimicrobial material made of crustacean shells, to kill bacteria, including E. coli, a bacteria known 
to cause illness.
The cows treated had a uterine disease, which Jeong said was im-
portant because those cows cause a huge economic loss in the U.S.
“The estimated loss is about 
$600 million,” he said. “If the cows have a uterine disease, their meat 
or dairy products can’t be sold.”
Jeong’s team 
tested 10 cows. They wanted to compare the re-sults of the tradi-tional antibiotics and the chitosan 
microparticles 
on killing the E. coli.
He said the natural chitosan 
microparticles were as effective at 
killing the E. coli as were the tradi-tional antibiotics.
The problem with the tradition-
al antibiotics is that bacteria was becoming more resistant to the an-tibiotics, he said. With the chitosan microparticles, there are low odds the bacteria will become resistant.
Klibs Galvao, an assistant pro-
fessor at the College of Veterinary 
Medicine in the Department of 
Large Animal Clinical Sciences, said alternatives such as the chi-tosan microparticles has potential for treatment in humans. 
For now, the researchers are 
testing the microparticles on more cows to show the effectiveness among more animals, Galvao 
said.
“We want to make chitosan mi-
croparticles more speciﬁ  c to killing 
E. coli that affects humans,” Gal-vao said. “Then the cattle can be treated before they go to slaughter so they aren’t contaminated and it can improve food safety.” Gators ﬁ  nd cow disease treatment

MEMPHIS, Tenn. — In the midst of a 
shooting slump — one that saw him shooting 
2 of 10 against UCLA for much of Thursday 
night’s contest — Scottie Wilbekin did not 
panic.
As the Gators led 58-55 with 7:18 left and 
struggled for much of the second half to pull 
away from the feisty Bruins, the senior point 
guard refused to dwell on his missed attempts. Instead, he made three key shots down the stretch and sent UF to its fourth consecutive trip to the Elite Eight.
Wilbekin was the hero for No. 1 seed Flor-
ida, making his final three field-goal attempts to help it cruise past No. 4 seed UCLA 79-68 in the FedExForum in the South Regional semi-
finals.
“Just trying to keep attacking, stay aggres-
sive and take what they gave me,” Wilbekin 
said.
“My shots weren’t falling … in the first 
half, even in the beginning of the second half. So I just tried to stay the course and keep play-ing my game.”
Saturday at 6:09 p.m., UF will face 11th-
seeded Dayton — the Cinderella of this year’s tournament — for a spot in the Final Four. And much of why UF is where it is now is be-cause of Wilbekin.
In the game’s final minutes, Wilbekin 
proved why he is Florida’s seasoned leader — and perhaps its most valuable player. Af-ter shooting guard Michael Frazier II knocked down a jumper to give UF (35-2) a five-point 
lead, Wilbekin sunk a three from the right 
wing on the next Gators offensive possession to lift the advantage to 63-55.
Out of a UCLA timeout, Wilbekin kept 
the streak moving. Drawing a foul on UCLA 
guard Norman Powell, Wilbekin took it to the 
hole and made a circus shot off the glass. He sunk his free throw to increase the Gators’ lead to 11 points, tying its largest advantage 
of the contest.
From there, Florida held on.
With 2:38 on the clock and the Gators run-
ning an isolation play for Wilbekin, he drib-bled through two defenders, maneuvered 
his way around Travis Wear in the paint and 
sunk a hook shot over the UCLA forward to give UF a 70-63 lead.
“I was just trying to get a shot up on the 
backboard and at least give the bigs a chance to rebound, but it ended up going in,” Wil-bekin said.
Added coach Billy Donovan: “He got kind 
of put into a difficult situation. Wear did a 
good job on him a couple plays before that. 
We put four guys on the baseline when Wear got switched on Scottie and drove around him and got a layup.”
Wilbekin also helped his teammates thrive 
Thursday. Playing alongside freshman Kasey Hill for much of the second half, the senior shifted at the two spot as the younger point guard notched a game-high 10 assists.
“Scottie, for the most part, when Kasey’s 
off the floor, the ball’s in his hands,” Donovan said. “It takes a pretty mature player to say, ‘I’m going to slide off the ball. I’m going to give the ball to a freshman.’”
Frazier finished with a game-high 19 points 
on a 7-of-13 clip from the field and 5-of-8 three-point shooting. The sophomore helped UF to a 28-21 lead in the first half thanks to three early three-pointers. 
Freshman forward Chris Walker, who fin-
ished with seven points and three rebounds, also played a key role for UF in the first half. Checking in with about four minutes left in 
the first half, he scored five straight points to 
give UF a 36-30 advantage at halftime. Walker helped the thin Gators manage when Casey Prather and Patric Young battled foul trouble down the stretch, as each had four fouls.
“He’s getting better, and he’s growing,” 
Donovan said. “You know, it was really a game where I never felt Patric was ever in Florida advances to Elite Eight

The Gators defeated the top team in the 
nation Tuesday, but now they have to beat 
one of the best pitchers.
Ace pitcher Aaron Nola will take the 
hill for No. 4 LSU (20-5, 3-2 Southeastern Conference) against Florida (16-9, 3-3 SEC) tonight at 7:30 p.m. at McKethan Stadium.
“He’s arguably one of the best in the 
country, if not the best,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said.
Nola, the star pitcher of a Tigers staff 
that boasts an ERA of 1.85, leads the SEC with a 0.22 ERA, which ranks third in the 
nation. He also leads the conference in 
strikeouts (56) and averages more than a punch out per inning.
When he faced 
Florida last season 
in Baton Rouge, La., 
Nola tossed a com-
plete-game shutout, striking out three bat-ters while allowing only four hits in LSU’s 5-0 win on May 3, 2013.
“He threw pretty well,” second base-
man Casey Turgeon said. “He spots his fastball and he makes pitches when he needs to. A guy who can do that is usually pretty successful in college.”
Nola’s command is what allows him to 
dominate opposing hitters.
None of the junior’s pitches are usu-
ally rated above a 60 on the 20-80 scout-ing scale, but the 6-foot-1 right-hander has shown the ability to locate the ball and lim-it his walks. Through 40.1 innings this sea-
son, he has a 7:1 strikeout-to-walk ratio.
“The fact that he can locate multiple 
pitches for strikes (makes Nola effective),” Gators facing one of nation’s top pitchers in series openerJordan McPherson / Alligator Staff

UF point guard
See hooPS, PA ge 15
See bASe, PA ge 15left-handed pitcher Bobby 
Poyner said. “He can really locate the ball.”
Although his command 
and pitching skills takes him from solid pitcher to one of the country’s best, Nola’s 
pure “stuff” is nothing to 
sneeze at.
The junior’s fastball sits 
in the low to mid 90s, and he throws a strong changeup 
and slider.
“He’s got some dominat-
ing pitches,” O’Sullivan said. 
“He’s 90-94, he keeps the ball 
down, he locates No. 1 prob-
ably better than anybody in our league. He’s got a good breaking ball, a good chan-geup.”
If that wasn’t enough, No-
la’s arm angle makes it even more difﬁ  cult for opposing hitters to pick up the pitches 
coming out of his hand.
“I think it’s his slot and 
the sink on his ball,” short-
stop Richie Martin said. 
“It’s a little unusual. It 
comes like three-quarter, a little sidearm … It’s a differ-ent look.”
Up against Nola will be Florida sophomore Eric Han-hold (3-2, 3.18 ERA). Han-hold has made 12 appearanc-es this season but only two of 
those were starts. 
In his last outing, Hanhold 
went four innings against 
Texas A&M, surrendering ﬁ  ve runs (four earned) and 
picking up the loss.
O’Sullivan said he moved 
Hanhold to Friday night 
ahead of freshman phenom 
Logan Shore — who will 
start Saturday — in order to give Shore a rest.
“He’s thrown two games 
back to back 100 pitches,” 
O’Sullivan said. “Eric only 
threw 65 pitches or so last Sat-urday, so I thought it would be smart to do that. Just give 
Logan one more day.”
Hanhold will need to im-
prove upon his last start, be-
cause runs will certainly be at a premium tonight for the 
Gators’ offense. 
“We got to ﬁ  nd a way to 
chip away at him,” Martin 
said. 
“We can’t give any op-
portunities away. When we get runners in scoring posi-tion, we have to take advan-tage. It’s going to be a tough 
night.”FRIDAY, MARCH 28, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

The Gators’ road trip didn’t go quite as they had hoped.
No. 4 Florida (13-4, 5-2 Southeastern Conference) has lost 
two of its last four matches, defeating Tennessee and Auburn but falling short against then-No. 11 Georgia and No. 8 Ala-bama.
UF will look to improve its play against SEC opponents 
when it faces Arkansas (7-5, 2-6 SEC) today at 3 p.m.
A year after winning its last conference championship, the 
Gators are having a harder time of it this season. They have eas-ily handled the SEC’s weaker teams — Missouri, South Caro-lina and UT — but have been inconsistent against the confer-ence’s elite. 
In the SEC, that’s easier 
said then done. 
Alabama sits atop the 
conference and is currently riding an 11-match winning streak, its longest of the season. Two spots below Alabama rests Geor-gia, a team coach Roland Thornqvist openly declared as his “pick to win the national championship” in May. Both teams 
defeated Florida, although home-court advantage may have 
been the deciding factor. 
The Gators sit in sixth place in the conference, safely above 
the mediocre teams but hovering just underneath the SEC’s up-per echelon.
Despite its middle-of–the-pack standing in its own confer-
ence, UF is ranked fourth in the nation, moving up from last week’s No. 5 ranking despite losing to Alabama. In fact, the Gators have more losses then the No. 5 and 6 teams combined. Sophomore Brianna Morgan will be key to getting the team 
on track.
In the Gators’ last two matches, Thornqvist started Morgan 
above senior Olivia Janowicz on Court 1. It was a move that the coach hinted at earlier in the season. 
“[Brianna] had that little shoulder injury that set her back 
and she couldn’t train much over break,” he said. “When she trains for an extended period of time she could be one of the 
top three or four players in the country, no question about it… 
I still think we’re going to see the best tennis she has later on.”
In addition, Florida has a favorable schedule ahead. Four 
of its last six matches are at home and all are against SEC op-ponents. UF boasts a 187-1 all-time record against conference teams at home.
Perhaps a lineup change and a bit of scheduling luck will be 
enough to propel the Gators back atop the SEC, beginning with Arkansas today.Florida attempting to right losing streak in home match tonight

start against Nola to begin home seriesWalker helps Gators off of bench
the ﬂ  ow of the game at all, and I 
thought Prather’s fouls probably hurt us a little bit. So Chris coming 
off the bench gave us good, quality 
minutes.”
Now on a 29-game winning 
streak, the Gators head into a match-
up with the Flyers, who handled No. 10 seed Stanford 82-72 prior to 
the Florida-UCLA game.
Florida has a history of crush-
ing the hopes of Cinderellas under Donovan. Last year, UF knocked off No. 15 seed FGCU 62-50 in the 
Sweet 16 and in 2006 routed No. 11 
seed George Mason 73-58 in the Fi-nal Four.
But in order to make their ﬁ  rst 
Final Four appearance since 2007, the Gators must put their past Elite Eight failures behind them.
“Me personally, I don’t feel like 
there’s anything to enjoy,” Frazier said. “We’re trying to keep advanc-ing, and you can’t take a breath 
because every team now is a good 
team. So we can enjoy what we’ve done after the season.”

When No. 4 Florida starts its 
three-game series against No. 2 
Tennessee in Knoxville, Tenn., tonight at 6, it’s going to be a pitcher’s duel.
The Gators (31-4, 5-4 South-
eastern Conference) and the Volunteers (28-3, 5-1 SEC) are tied for second in the confer-ence with a 1.76 ERA. 
“We’re going to have to 
pitch well,” coach Tim Walton said in a release after UF’s 10-6 win against UCF on Wednes-
day. “We’ve got to go out and 
pitch well, set the tempo and gain that conﬁ  dence.”
Tennessee has three pitch-
ers with sub-2.00 ERAs with Ellen Renfroe (18-0) taking the bulk of the pitches. 
The senior right-handed 
pitcher is second in the SEC 
with a 1.34 ERA in 120 in-nings pitched and is holding 
opponents to a .167 clip at the plate. Her 8.3 strikeouts per game average ranks fourth in the conference and 45th in the country.
Renfroe, a two-time SEC 
Pitcher of the Week this season, 
has thrown 16 complete games 
— eight were shutouts.
Like Tennessee, a senior 
leads Florida in the circle. Right-hander Hannah Rogers (14-3) leads Florida with a 1.57 ERA — the ﬁ  fth-best mark in the SEC — while striking out 79 batters in 93.2 innings pitched 
this season. 
But unlike the Volunteers, 
the Gators have two other 
pitchers who have logged more than 50 innings in the circle this season.
Freshman Delanie Gourley 
has shown growth through her ﬁ  rst year, striking out 92 bat-
ters in just 80.2 innings. 
The Lakeside, Calif., native 
holds an 11-1 record and is 2-1 
against ranked opponents this season. Her only loss came against Alabama on March 21.
And while she has only 
pitched 11.2 innings since SEC action began, junior Lauren Haeger is still a valuable asset for the Gators on the mound. In 52.2 innings this season, the Peoria, Ariz., native boasts a 
1.73 ERA and is holding op-
ponents to a team-low .145 bat-ting average.
While UF’s pitchers strug-
gled during its midweek win against UCF — walking a sea-son-high eight batters and giv-ing up seven hits and six runs — Walton believes his pitch-
ing staff will rebound from its 
struggles when it faces Tennes-see.
“I think the pitchers are 
going to give the hitters con-ﬁ  dence and the hitters are go-ing to give the pitchers conﬁ  -dence,” Walton said. “When you play a good team like 
we’re getting ready to play, it’s 
going to come down to trying to score ﬁ  rst and limiting our opponent’s opportunities to score.”

The Gators have spent all but one of their 
three-round tournaments lingering around 
ninth or 10th place on the leaderboard.
Florida will have a chance to end the reg-
ular season on a high note when the team tees off this morning at the Bryan National Collegiate co-hosted by UNC Greensboro 
and Wake Forest in Greensboro, N.C. 
Florida takes on six other top-25 teams 
and two Southeastern Conference oppo-
nents at the Bryan Park Golf and Enrich-ment Center Champions Course.
This is a golf course that Glaser called 
“challenging but fair” in a release.
“We really don’t know what the weather 
will be like or what the course will be like,” Glaser said. “We have to mentally prepare for that.”
The Gators took ﬁ  fth last year with a 
score of 887(+23).
“It will be a good test of the work we 
have been doing,” Glaser said. “The goal is to trust it this week and be in the mix come Sunday.”
Following her season-best performance and top-ﬁ  ve place in the leaderboard at the 2014 Gator Invite, junior Ca-milla Hedberg leads the 
Gator lineup this morn-
ing. 
Hedberg is the only 
Florida player who has 
played the Greensboro 
greens in the past.
Freshman Maria Torres made the lineup 
with a 73.2 stroke average and a top-15 SEC 
ranking despite struggling in her ﬁ  rst home 
tournament. Fellow freshman Karolina Vl-ckova and junior Sarah Schober, who has a 
team-best stroke average of just under 73, will also play for Florida.
Redshirt sophomore Katie Mitchell also 
made the lineup, successfully competing in every single tournament during the 2014 season.
Elcin Ulu, the only senior on the team, 
did not make the lineup for what would have been her ﬁ  nal regular season tourna-ment as a Gator.
“This is a great event to close out the 
regular season,” Glaser said. “The team is 
excited.”UF aiming to come back from poor season in ﬁ  nal tournament
