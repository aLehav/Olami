Darius D. Phillips spent 
most of Wednesday in hand-
cuffs, but for about 11 of those hours he was a free man.
After running away from 
Gainesville Police in the middle of his arrest around 8:30 a.m., Phillips was caught on New-ell Drive on Wednesday night. Phillips, 20, was arrested on charges of domestic battery , grand theft auto and ﬂ  eeing police.
UF students received text 
and email alerts Wednesday morning warning that Phil-lips was last seen at the Hilton University of Florida Confer-ence Center on Southwest 34th Street. At about 7 p.m., an un-known person called 911 and said Phillips was near the New Physics Building, according to University Police Lt. Andy Wagner.
About eight members of 
UPD responded to the scene, and ofﬁ  cer Jordan Craven 
saw Phillips 
standing  near Mu-seum Road. Phillips was still in hand-cuffs, though they were covered by a shirt and 
now in front of his body.
When Craven approached 
Phillips, the alleged criminal bolted east. Craven chased after Phillips, and other ofﬁ  -cers joined. Ultimately, inves-GPD, UPD catch

The expansion and renovation 
of the Reitz Union is on the hori-
zon.
The UF Board of Trustees ap-
proved issuing $50 million in bonds Wednesday for the expan-sion only. 
The renovation of the current 
union will draw from $20 million set aside from student fees and $5 million from internal university funds.
Before issuing the bonds, Gov. 
Rick Scott must sign a bill that would grant an exception for the limit on the amount of student fees that can be used for building con-struction projects.
Dave Kratzer, interim vice pres-
ident for student affairs, said the project would get delayed if the bill met Scott’s veto pen.
As of late last week, the bill had 
not been presented to Scott.
If funding is approved, UF is ex-
pected to start construction on the 100,000-square-foot expansion next spring. 
Administrators plan to seek bids 
this summer and ﬁ  nd an architect in the fall.
The project is currently planned 
to be a three-story expansion where the colonnade is now, which would take a year, and a 75,000-square-foot renovation of the current union, which would take another year.
Kratzer said he wants students to be involved in designing the space, which will include dance studios, lounges and a new ballroom.
“The structure is really all about 
students,” he said.
Kratzer said staggering the ex-
pansion and renovation would al-low UF to keep part of the union open throughout the construction period.

The PNC Bank on Northwest 
13th Street was closed Wednesday after an armed robbery.
An unidentiﬁ  ed man in a ski 
mask walked into the bank shortly before 11:30 a.m. He ﬂ  ashed a hand-gun and demanded money , said Gainesville Police spokeswoman Cpl. Angelina Valuri.
Bank employees complied, but  
GPD would not reveal how much money was taken. The man then ran east on Northwest 18th Avenue as ofﬁ  cers responded to a 911 call.GPD set up a perimeter, and the 
Joint Aviation Unit looked for the man from a helicopter. However, as of 6:30 p.m. Wednesday, the suspect remained at large.
The man is about 5 foot 11 inches, 
and he was last seen in a black T-shirt and black pants, Valuri said.About six employees were inside 
the bank when the robbery hap-pened, but none were injured. There were no customers inside.
A woman in the ofﬁ  ce declined 
to comment Wednesday afternoon because PNC’s corporate policy for-bids employees from speaking to the media, she said.
The bank isn’t big. It only has 
eight available parking spots. From 1 p.m. to 3:30 p.m., 10 people drove by asking when they would be al-lowed inside. Some parked and used the ATM outside, others said they would use the other PNC Bank in town, located at 4340 W Newber-ry Road.
One man said he needed to get 
inside. The ATM swallowed his credit card Tuesday , and he needed to get it back.

In Wednesday’s edition of the Alligator, it was incorrectly re-ported that the Student Green Energy Fund will save UF about $600,000 a year. The story should have read that the fund will generate about $600,000 each year in funds that will be put toward student-proposed projects to lower UF’s electric-ity costs and thereby save the university money.How is social capital attain-

tigator Burton Parker caught       
Phillips at the bottom of the hill on Newell Drive, just north of the McKnight Brain Institute.
Campus police gave Phillips 
back to GPD officers at about 7:30 p.m., and they drove Phil-lips to the Alachua County Jail later Wednesday night. UF sent another alert at about 7:50 p.m. to notify students of the arrest.
Phillips was originally ar -
rested by GPD at about 8:30 a.m. in the 1400 block of South-west 42nd Street, but he ran away while being moved from one police car to another. He was sitting in the car of an of-ficer who was on the midnight shift, which was ending.
Police planned to move him 
to the car of an officer who was working the day shift, but as they escorted him to the other car, Phillips broke free and ran south, GPD spokeswoman Cpl. Angelina Valuri said.
Officers and ASO's K-9 Unit 
were unable to track Phillips on Wednesday morning, though one witness told police she saw Phillips climbing a fence in handcuffs near the Kensing-ton Apartments on Southwest 20th Avenue. Another witness said Phillips was near the Hil-ton, but he disappeared into the woods.
Phillips was previously ar -
rested on charges of carjacking, robbery , resisting arrest and driving without a valid drivers license, according to county re-cords.

A fire at an abandoned house 
on Northwest 13th Street caused 
about $10,000 worth of damage late Tuesday night.
There was no one in the two-
story house, located at 410 NW 13th St., said Gainesville Police Department Lt. Mike Schibuola.
The cause was still being de-
termined as of Wednesday night.
The old building is valued 
at about $70,000, according to a Gainesville Fire Rescue release.
It was built around the 1930s 
and is owned by Paradigm 413 LLC, according to county prop-erty records.
The company is registered to 
Nathan Collier, a Gainesville real estate owner and investor.
Krispy Kreme employees 
smelled the smoke from down the street and called 911 at 11:39 p.m. Tuesday. Officers were at the scene at 11:42 p.m.
Smoke was coming from the 
second-story windows of the resi-dence, but officers couldn’t see any flames, Schibuola said.
GFR firefighters walked 
around the second floor of the building, shining headlights across the room and out the open window.
“This one’s definitely weird 
because it’s all boarded up,” he said.
He said sometimes these types 
of fires start when homeless peo-ple make small campfires on cold nights. There were no obvious signs of entry.
He said a GFR investigator will 
decide if the fire was arson.

UF law professors weighed in on the roles 
of race and self-defense in the Trayvon Martin 
shooting at a Wednesday night discussion.
Six professors from UF’s Levin College of 
Law discussed Florida’s “stand your ground” self-defense law and racism. They also re-sponded to audience members’ comments.
The college’s Center for the Study of Race 
and Race Relations hosted the panel. About 130 people attended the event.
The panelists said George Zimmerman, who said he shot the teenage Trayvon in self-defense, should be arrested. They agreed, however, that he would probably be acquit-ted if brought to court.
Professor Monique Haughton-Worrell, 
who said she used to practice law in Sanford, was concerned that a jury might be racist.
“I don’t support any argument that there 
was not sufficient evidence for an arrest,” Haughton-Worrell said. “I would even make an argument that were Zimmerman a black man, Sanford Police would have made an ar -
rest.”
Professor Katheryn Russell-Brown also believed race was at the core of the case.
“While this does not involve a shooting 
by police, it’s been the San-ford Police Department’s response that has been the rallying cry for many across the nation,” she said.
UF law student Gen-
try Mander, 24, said she 
was curious about why Trayvon's death has got-ten more attention within 
the black community than the proportion of young black men in jail.After the event, she said she had wanted 
to see more discussion about the facts of the case.
Brenda Brown, an administrative assistant 
in the College of Dentistry, said she sees the faces of her brothers, father and 15-month-old grandson in Trayvon.
One of the first audience members to com-
ment, Brown was choked up as she spoke to the panelists.
“This touched me more so from a mother’s 
perspective,” Brown, 52, said after the event. “I think, ‘What is so scary about our black men that means they must be shot?’”

Becoming a lawyer might not be 
as popular as it used to be.
The number of Law School Ad-
mission Tests administered this 
year dropped more than 16 percent, and the UF Levin College of Law received 10.4 percent fewer appli-cations than last year.
This year, 129,925 LSATs were 
administered, as compared to 155,050 last year. The number has declined almost 25 percent since a record high of 171,514 tests were given two years ago.
UF Law’s decrease in applicants 
is just shy of the national average decrease of 14.4 percent, said Mi-chelle Adorno, assistant dean of admissions.
“UF is in line with what is hap-
pening nationally,” she wrote in an email.
In a good legal market, she said, 
about two-thirds of UF Law stu-dents have job offers by the time they graduate. In the current mar -ket, that number is closer to 50 per -
cent.
Although the college has no data 
to precisely ex-
plain the reason for the decline, Adorno attrib-uted the trend to “potential appli-cants becoming more educated consumers.”
Articles about increasing compe-
tition in the legal market, recently featured in newspapers such as The New York Times, have concerned potential applicants in recent years, she said.
Second-year UF Law student Ian 
Parry, 23, said he agrees the insecu-rity of the job market contributes to the decline.
“Now, with the bleak outlook as 
a lawyer post-graduation,” he said, “undergrad students do not have the same incentive to attend law school.”
The expense of law school is an-other deterrent, he said.
Parry, who plans to graduate in 
May 2013, said he doesn’t have a post-graduation job offer yet.
He thinks he made the right 
choice going to law school directly after completing his bachelor’s de-gree at Furman University, he said, and believes the UF college of law has given him the necessary tools to succeed.
“Nevertheless,” Parry said, “the 
declining job market is not some-thing I enjoy reading about.”

� COUNTY OFFICIAL SAYS 
A BAN WOULD REDUCE AMOUNT OF  HARMFUL SECONDHAND SMOKE.
BENJAMIN S. BRASCH
Alligator Writer
The Gainesville Public Safe-
ty Committee decided Wednes-
day night to recommend the City Commission ban smok-ing in Bo Diddley Community Plaza. 
The commission will vote 
on the issue at a later meeting.
A ban would reduce the 
amount of secondhand smoke, which is harmful up to 20 feet away, said Steven Pokorny, di-rector of health promotion for the Alachua County Health De-partment.
However, Commissioner 
Todd Chase said he thought the city should not put an ordi-nance into action if it is going to be too hard to enforce.
The committee also dis-
cussed candy-flavored tobacco 
and alcohol sales downtown.
Commissioner Jeanna Mas-
trodicasa, chair of the Public 
Safety Committee, said the committee is at a standstill in regards to whether the com-mission can ban the product in the city until the federal gov-ernment decides its stance on the issue.

Kelsang Chokyan, draped in yellow and red 
robes, closed his eyes and guided his four-per -
son class through a journey of healing through 
meditation.
A wave of relaxation fell over Chokyan’s stu-
dents Wednesday night as he softly described peaceful sceneries and feeling weightless.
Chokyan, 32, is a Buddhist monk traveling 
around Florida teaching Buddhism and the art of meditation to his students. He arrived in Gainesville about two years ago to share his lifestyle.
Growing up in a poor family outside Dal-
las, Texas, Chokyan said he was motivated to become a Buddhist monk after watching a movie about them in his ninth-grade geogra-phy class.
“I was really impressed with the fact that 
they didn’t kill anything,” he said.
After graduating from college, Chokyan be-
came a high school physics teacher and contin-ued learning about Buddhism by taking classes at the Kadampa Meditation Center Texas in Arlington, Texas.
For the next two years, Chokyan spent his 
time living at the center and working at Star -
bucks.
In 2004, Chokyan was formally inducted as 
a Buddhist monk. He then went to teach classes at the Parbawatiya Kadampa Buddhist Center in Tampa. For the last eight years, Chokyan has taught classes in several Florida cities.
Chokyan’s class in Tampa has about 30 stu-
dents, while his Gainesville class, which has been running twice a month since September, has about six students.
Chokyan said the students who attend his 
class range from prison inmates to working mothers.
Anna Davila, a 60-year-old Gainesville resi-
dent, said the class is a way for her to relax and apply her Buddhist beliefs.
“You forget about you and try to help other 
people,” she said.Traveling monk teaches meditation,

Fans of Harry Potter can now conjure 
the magic and whimsy of the wizarding 
world on e-readers.
For $57.54, readers can buy all seven 
books of the award-winning Harry Pot-ter series as e-books for their tablets, e-readers or computers.
Pottermore.com, J.K. Rowling’s on-
line expansion of the Harry Potter saga, is selling the e-book and audiobook ver -
sions.
The e-book versions of the first three 
books cost $7.99 per e-book, and the last four cost $9.99 per e-book.
The audiobook version of the first 
three books costs $29.99 per audiobook, and the other four cost $44.99 each.
Many people who are buying the 
e-books and audiobooks are fans who want to relive the magic, said Kenneth Kidd, UF associate professor of the Eng-lish department.
“The experience of listening can be 
really different,” he said. “It’s a differ -
ent dimension to the book.”
Some people, he said, find it easier to 
listen to audiobooks on-the-go instead 
of reading a book.
Kelsey Savery, a 
19-year-old UF chem-istry freshman, said she experienced the 
world of Harry Potter while walking around campus listening to audiobooks.
She said it took her 
two weeks to finish one book, and each chapter took her 30 minutes.
“This is a way where I can have the 
whole book as a movie,” she said.

Stephon Watts case   
deserves equal attention
In February, an African-American teenage boy was killed.
While we have been hearing news about Trayvon Martin, 
another shooting that was arguably just as troublesome has 
been virtually ignored by the media.
On Feb. 1, in Calumet City, Ill., police shot and killed 15-year-
old Stephon Watts in his home after the boy’s family called them 
to help subdue their son, who occasionally had fits of aggression due to a mental disability.
Stephon suffered from Asperger’s Syndrome, a high-func-
tioning form of autism.
According to CBS Chicago, “Police said he had cut one officer 
with a knife and was acting in a threatening manner, so officers shot him in fear of their own safety.”
Yet, according to Stephon’s family , his “weapon” was merely 
a butter knife.
The family had called police to the home 10 times since 2010 
to help when Stephon became aggressive. In those instances though, the family said they were able to subdue him with a stun gun.
For anyone concerned about justice, the facts of this case are 
cause for alarm.
While we might not know the full story , one has to wonder 
what factors in this case have not led to the same public outrage as the Trayvon Martin incident.
Perhaps it is because Stephon was wielding something more 
akin to a weapon than a bag of Skittles.
Still, if the blade in question is a mere butter knife, does this 
justify the shooting of an innocent, mentally disabled boy?
Perhaps it is because the incident in Calumet City involved 
police performing their regular duties.
But should police be given less scrutiny for wrongful killings 
than private citizens?
Police are given a lot of power; in some instances, they are 
given the authority to take a life. But shouldn’t this power come with more oversight and responsibility?
Perhaps it has to do with the fact that the officers felt threat-
ened after he allegedly cut one of the officers.
But surely the police had more options to subdue Stephon 
without resorting to lethal force, right?
We do not bring this up to say that the Trayvon Martin case 
should be dismissed, but shouldn’t both of these cases be given equal attention?
Of course, there has been outrage over this case. Members of 
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Peo-ple, local politicians and the Rev. Jesse Jackson have commented and led protests over this issue.
But the buzz from social media and national news outlets has 
not come close to the coverage and commentary surrounding the Trayvon Martin case.
Two African-American teenage boys are dead due to trou-
bling circumstances.
Both of these kids deserve equal attention.Social media creates shallow self-image
Facebook is essentially about two fundamental things: 
jealousy and exhibition.
Think about it, the only reason any of us posts 
anything on Facebook is because we want everyone else to see it. We upload a status about our recent internship because we want the recognition and “likes.”
We post Spring Break photos with the caption “be jeal-
ous” because we want our friends to, well, be jealous.
We tag our friends at Midtown with us because we 
want to prove we’re not alone on a Friday night.
We exhibit our lifestyles and expect envious commen-
tary.
While Facebook is, indeed, a great way to connect with 
friends and loved ones, there is a problem when you de-velop your sense of self-worth from the number of likes a status receives.
There’s a problem when you start taking pride in the 
fact that you got 40-plus likes on a mobile upload. There’s a problem when the ease with which you support a cam-paign is second only to the ignorance with which you click “like.”
According to an NPR article, researchers at the Univer-
sity of Waterloo recently published a study in psychologi-cal science, which determined that “people with low self-esteem posted far more negative updates than those with high self-esteem.”
Certainly, we all have those friends who broadcast their 
problems to the world or even those who post the cheer-ful highlights of their day. We all have Facebook friends who fit into crisp categories such as the following: the Bible-quoter, the dejected pessimists, the politically active, the song quoters, the arrogant, the self-picture-takers, the ambitious ones, the inspirational quoters, the social move-ment supporters.
It’s this last category that particularly troubles me. Es-
pecially recently, the rise of social media as a medium of political activism is founded upon — like most everything else on Facebook — a basis of envy and exhibition.
The exhibitionist environment 
of social media provides a forum by which people can express concern about a foreign genocide or even a local shooting with the mere click of the mouse.
Does merely clicking “share” 
on the Kony 2012 video change 
anything? Does expressing outrage at Susan G. Komen for the Cure’s decision to defund Planned Parenthood change anything? Does uproar over the shooting of Trayvon Mar-tin change anything?
Or are these actions merely a way to polish our online 
alter egos?
Indeed, the newest symbols of social currency are be-
coming hashtags, “at” signs, followers and a mini thumbs up. Users get recognized for their activist posts, and this instant gratification is the shot of dopamine to the reward center of the brain that tells them they’ve “done their part.”
They got all the accolades of acknowledgment and 
commentary without any of the work that went into actu-ally doing anything. No longer is life about doing some-thing, it’s about being someone.
But here I am being all cynical again. I mean, Susan G. 
Komen for the Cure did change its policy. The Trayvon Martin shooting is now being investigated.
Maybe Joseph Kony will be brought to justice because 
of this awareness campaign. Who knows?
However, we must walk the fine line between acceler -
ating awareness and perfecting persona.
I do know one thing, though. When I post this column 
to Facebook, all of my friends better like it.

From the looks of Francine Eliz-
abeth’s bedroom, she seems like a 
typical teenager.  A bulletin board covered with photos of her friends hangs above her bed; signed con-cert T-shirts line the red wall; and her rabbit, Pickles, hops around in her cage.
At 18, Elizabeth, a freshman at 
Santa Fe College, has accomplished more than most of her peers as a talented fashion and jewelry de-signer.
Her designs will be on display 
in a runway show on April 12 at Villa East, 301 N. Main St., as part of Gainesville Fashion Week.
This is Elizabeth’s second time 
showing off her creations on the runway.  Last year, she celebrated her 18th birthday on the first day of fashion week, making her just old enough to participate. This year, she turns 19 a week before her show.
Although Gainesville Fashion 
Week was Elizabeth’s first major exposure as a designer, she has been sewing since she was 7 and designing and selling jewelry since she was 5.
When she was 10, she won a 
competition with Sew Young Sew Fun. In return, A-1 Sewing gave her an embroidery machine that now sits in the workspace in her room next to her sewing machine and royal blue mannequin.
The first garment she ever 
made was a T-shirt with a bunny on a quilted square on it, which she says was “horrible.”
Elizabeth has come a long way 
from that bunny shirt, now design-ing dresses, skirts and tops for fe-males ages 14 to 30.  She describes her design style as “kind of sexy but still sophisticated.”
Her 26-piece collection for this 
year’s show is full of teals, golds, bronzes, blacks, khakis and silvers 
in a mix of sheer and solid fabrics with lots of bead-work, all made by hand.
“
It has an 
Egyptian feel to 
it,” she said.  
“There is a lot 
of different shapes, but the collec-
tion’s fairly cohesive with the col-ors and the textures.”
Elizabeth says she has to over-
come a lot of challenges regarding her age and level of experience as a young designer.
“People don’t take you serious-
ly unless you’re, like, over 30,” she said. “You just have to show that you can do it and prove yourself because the product is what people look at.”
Despite being young, Elizabeth 
works hard at her hobbies.  Just last week, she was accepted to the Savannah College of Art and De-sign for jewelry making, which she considers the defining moment of her career thus far, and she plans to attend starting next year.
“I just do it for fun,” she said. 
“It’s kind of a hobby that turned into selling stuff to people, and then it kind of just built up.”
Elizabeth’s fashion and jewelry 
designs are available for purchase on her website, thumperdesigns.com.
In her collections, she incorpo-
rates her jewelry with her fashion, matching the tones in the fabrics with beautiful, handcrafted ear-rings and necklaces.
“I do a lot of stuff with gem-
stones and different metals,” she said.  “Most of it is all beaded and woven together.”
Elizabeth says her talent stems 
from her artistic family, which includes musicians, goldsmiths, architects and art professors. She plans to keep participating in Gainesville Fashion Week as long as she is able to, and she hopes to end up in a creative profession.
“I want to have a big name for 
something, either jewelry or de-sign,” she said.  “I mean, I’ve al-ready come this far.”
Until then, she plans to be a reg-
ular college student in Gainesville, attending Taco Tuesday at Tijuana Flats, $2 burger Wednesday at Mother’s Pub & Grill, playing poker, attending rock concerts and hanging out with friends.Gainesville Fashion Week: Focus on Francine Elizabeth

Beer lovers, leave your standard six pack 
in the fridge, step outside your comfort zone 
and try some new brews that are made right in your own neighborhood.
On April 14, the first Hogtown Craft Beer 
Festival at Kanapaha Botanical Gardens will showcase craft beer made by Florida brew-eries and brewpubs as well as other local and regional varieties.
According to Alex Pries, a committee 
member for the Hogtown Craft Beer Festi-val, craft beer is produced on a smaller scale than largely recognized mega-brands like Budweiser and Coors.
“Craft breweries tend to have a very di-
verse portfolio and assembly of different types of beers,” Pries said. “For example, you’ll have a brewery that will produce a pale ale but they’ll also do a dark beer, like a stout.”
Pries said that with the increasing pop-
ularity of microbreweries in Florida, craft breweries and brewpubs are really starting to take off in Gainesville.
“They often have a lot more freedom to 
experiment and play with different styles and ingredients, but craft breweries are also very dependent on their local communities to thrive,” Pries said.
In addition to beer tasting, Pries said 
festival-goers will also have the opportunity to speak with a few of the professional head brewers from different Florida breweries af-ter a presentation on brewing in Florida and a homebrewing demonstration.
Some of the breweries featured at the fes-
tival will include Cigar City Brewing, Alliga-tor Brewing Company, Blue Moon Brewing Company and Swamp Head Brewery, which is located in Gainesville, Pries said.
Craig Birkmaier, the head brewer at 
Swamp Head Brewery, said this festival is going to be different than any other beer fes-tival Gainesville has seen before because the focus of the Hogtown Craft Beer Festival is all about the craftsmanship and supporting local breweries and other businesses.
“I want people to be entertained and 
have an enjoyable time in a nice venue where they’re not going to be too crowded and they’re going to have an opportunity to listen to music and drink a lot of different beers with great food pairings,” Birkmaier said.
Some of the local restaurants that serve 
food samples to correspond with the vari-ety of craft beers include Stubbies & Steins, Dragonfly Sushi and Blue Gill Quality Foods, Birkmaier said.
Beer is becoming just as popular as wine, 
and people should learn all of the different possibilities of craft beer, whether it be with food pairings or seasonal occasions, Birk-maier said, so they can walk away with a new appreciation.
“There’s hundreds of styles of beers: 
There’s dark beers, light beers, fruit beers, and they’re all different and appropriate for different kinds of occasions, like pale ales for the summertime and heavier sit-down-and-sip-type beers for the winter,” Birkmaier said.
Keeping with the local focus, all the pro-
ceeds from the festival, which is being or-ganized by Gainesville homebrew club The Hogtown Brewers, will benefit the Alachua Conservation Trust and St. Johns Riverkeep-er, Birkmaier said.
To buy tickets, which are $35 for general 
admission and $75 for VIP , and to find a full list of participating breweries, brewpubs and restaurants at the festival, visit www.hogtownbeerfest.com.
“As people learn all the things that are 
possible with beer, they truly begin to enjoy it,” Birkmaier said.

The mosh pit started just before midnight. 
A girl, no taller than 5-foot-2, lit a dirty, bro-
ken cigarette, gripped her beer bottle tight and disappeared into a sea of beards, tattoos and empty cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon. The air smelled of sweat and cheap beer. So did The Black Lips.
On Saturday, the Atlanta punk band, 
best known for its druggy, unfiltered lyrics and wild stage antics, lived up to its reputa-tion during a sold-out set at The Back Yard in downtown Gainesville. The group tore through the catchy, two-minute nuggets on its latest album, “Arabia Mountain,” and pillaged its back-catalogue for noisy garage cuts. They swigged whiskey. They made out a little.  
The small outdoor venue, nestled be-
tween Boca Fiesta and Palomino Pool Hall, is owned by punk veteran Warren Oakes and was packed with spectators waiting to see what the unpredictable foursome would do.
“You never know what to expect,” gui-
tarist Cole Alexander said before the show. “You might get pregnant, you might become a born-again Christian — anything can hap-pen.”
Described by Black Lips drummer Joe 
Bradley as “flower-punk,” the band incor -
porates a punk-rock style with blues, doo-wop and `60s psychedelic rock — sort of like if The Ramones and Buddy Holly had a lovechild, and that lovechild got kicked out of school and started smoking and drinking at a young age.
Bass guitarist Ian St. Pé said the group’s 
shows are largely dependent on the crowd’s energy.
“If they give off a party vibe, we’re going 
to party,” he explained.
The large group of moshers gathered, pushed, swayed, threw beer, stage-dove and crowd-surfed into the stiff arms of other moshers. At one point, a nimble crowd-surf-er headed straight for a crash with a pillar, grabbed onto the pole and shimmied down it like a spider monkey. There were no inju-ries during the show — none, at least, that couldn’t be dulled by adrenaline and booze. There were, however, many lost shoes and a few lost purses that scattered the floor in front of the stage.
“This is not a show — it’s a rumble,” said 
Pitchfork writer William Bowers, who at-tended the show.
The Lips are used to this. They have 
played past shows drunk and nude. They once got kicked out of India for “homosex-ual behavior.”
Gainesville got a liplock between Ander-
son and St. Pé during “Oh Katrina,” a raucous shout-er off their album “Good Bad Not Evil.” Other band members Bradley and Jared Swilley possessed a similar energy but refrained from any man-on-man action.
On “Arabia Mountain,” the band worked 
with big-time producer Mark Ronson on all except two tracks, which were produced by fellow Atlanta resident, Deerhunter’s Lock-ett Pundt. The result is a cleaner sound and 60s flavor that distinguish the album from its rawer previous entries.
“It took the longest it’s ever taken,” Alex-
ander said of the album, which he said took a year to make. The band recorded previous albums in Atlanta, sometimes in a bedroom, over the course of a few weeks.
Alexander said this time was different. 
They traveled to a Brooklyn studio to work with Ronson, who has produced albums for artists such as Amy Winehouse.
Gainesville punk promotion company 
Garage Mahal Presents brought in The Black Lips. Owner Vishal Agarwala said he had met them while working for Grooveshark and attending music festivals.
“They are incredible songwriters and 
phenomenal showmen,” he added.
The Black Lips hit many other towns in 
Florida, including Miami, Orlando, Tampa, Tallahassee and Jacksonville. The band’s van was vandalized in Jacksonville when some members of the audience took offense to an off-hand comment.
According to St. Pé, members of the band 
referred to Jacksonville as “below them.” St. Pé said they meant that Jacksonville was geographically south of Atlanta, but a few audience members thought the band im-plied that they were lower-class and took revenge via spray paint.
Despite having worked with an A-list 
producer, an appearance on Conan O’ Brien and having songs on soundtracks such as “500 Days of Summer” and “Dirty Sexy Money,” The Black Lips still seem to be the rebellious, liquor-swigging, dude-kissing-dude garage band that they have been since they formed in 1999.
“Yeah, we are still just as wild,” St. Pé 
said.8, ALLIGATOR §  THURSDAY, MARCH 29, 2012

The Black Lips haven’t changed too much since 1999; they’re still the same “rebel-lious, liquor-swilling, dude-kissing-dude” band.

Hollywood’s renditions of 
bestselling books “The Girl with 
the Dragon Tattoo” and “The Hunger Games” set a trend of strong female characters
With their recent roles in Da-
vid Fincher’s “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo” and Gary Ross’s “The Hunger Games,” Rooney Mara and Jennifer Lawrence, re-spectively, became the new Holly-wood “It” girls with their strong and unforgiving yet honest por -
trayals of two young women who are trying to survive in a world that tries to control them — grip-ping the audiences’ hearts in the process.
The tattooed punk Lisbeth 
“The Girl who Played with Fire” Salander and working-class girl Katniss “The Girl on Fire” Ever -
deen are without a doubt fiery characters who both garnered large fan bases since the trilogies were released. However, movie-goers’ new favorite female hero-ines in Hollywood’s renditions of the beloved books do a lot more than kick butt.
Fincher’s and Ross’ takes on 
the characters are a feminist’s dream: They have love interests and tender sides that never com-promised their strength. Both di-rectors drove the stories forward and revealed the dark aspects of society that are sometimes over -
looked, a trait that is surely rare in the male-dominated world of cinema.
This year’s Academy Awards’ 
Best Actress in a Leading Role category celebrated strong fe-male types, as the nominations, one of which was Mara’s role, were from films that featured ex-traordinary women who defied the odds. Even Oscar snubs like “Hanna” featured female charac-ters worth mentioning. In 2011, female characters dominated, and in 2012, Jennifer Lawrence continues the trend.
And as the “Twilight” series 
wraps up at the end of the year, these two characters are a fresh step forward from Bella Swan’s step back. Bella, dubbed a “femi-nist’s nightmare” in 2009, an-noyed the non-Twihards with her hyperdependency and total immersion into the mysterious Edward Cullen.
The ultimate disappointment 
is that her character did not en-dure any character change, aside from turning into a vampire, 
courtesy of her 
crutch, Edward. In other words, she pales in comparison to the strong and i n d e p e n d e n t Lisbeth and Kat-niss.
It’s great that the movies don’t 
stop there — both actresses, who are slated to reprise their roles, have two movies left in the re-spective series, so the fun isn’t over.
But behind the glitz and glam, 
Hollywood has brought these two series, there are several dark subjects from the books that the movies capture. “The Hunger Games,” while aimed toward a younger audience, does a great job introducing topics such as poverty, starvation, the effects of war and the killing of peers.
“The Girl with the Dragon Tat-
too,” on the other hand, is aimed toward an older audience. It has intense rape scenes and abuse that reveals to audiences the cor -
ruption in the government and authorities.
While the themes appear dif-
ferent, both trilogies capture the essence of oppression and the ef-fects it has on the innocent. Kat-niss and her family are let down by their world, as she’s thrust into a sick game to entertain a well-advantaged society. Lis-beth is physically and mentally tortured by authority figures for sexual pleasure.
Despite their hopeless, dark 
situations, both heroines refuse to feel sorry for themselves, even-tually rising against the odds and making fools out of the systems that mistakenly mess with them.Both characters develop in 
vastly different ways. To author Stieg Larsson, Lisbeth was an adult version of the unconven-tional Pippi Longstocking. Her damaged soul was inspired by a young woman, of the same name, whose rape he witnessed when he was 15 years old.
Katniss is a mashup of Su-
zanne Collins’ childhood feeling of loss while her father was in the Vietnam War and the Greek myth Theseus. The two young women, so similar despite their nine years apart in age, have appealed and inspired women and men around the world.
It’s easy for one to wonder 
why their appeal has been so strong, and the answer is simple: Both women take control.
This control grips the audi-
ence, both on print and in film, as they root for these two young women to make it out alive. And long after the credits roll, both heroines leave you sighing in re-lief. 
For now.

Mia Kelly is not one to keep with stereo-
types.
Yeah, she’s a girl, but she’d rather get dirty 
than go to a spa. Kelly could live in cutoffs 
and a tank top her whole life. Ever the fash-ion rule-breaker, she wore her prom dress to a sorority formal less than a year later. She doesn’t care. Dressing up has never been her favorite thing.
She was voted “Most Likely to do the 
Opposite of Every Sorority Stereotype” by her Phi Mu sorority sisters. They were right. After all, not every sorority girl wins a world championship before she’s old enough to start college.  Kelly, a UF freshman, won the gold medal 
in the 16- to 18- year-old category at the 2010 World Association of Kickboxing Organiza-tion’s Junior Championship in Serbia when she was 17.
She’ll hold the title of world champion un-
til September, when another girl will take that title in the junior division, which, at 18, Kelly is too old to compete in.Now that she’s in college, though, Kelly 
wants to be known as “Mia who kickboxes,” as opposed to Kickboxer Mia, she said.
One would never think that the redhead 
with a beaming smile and toenails polished a light pink could throw punches like she can.
Kelly is a more-than-meets-the-eye type of 
girl, anyway.
Kickboxing through college, Mia Kelly breaks the mold
see MIA, p Age 1010, ALLIGATOR §  THURSDAY, MARCH 29, 2012
Kelly is also a member of the Freshman Leadership Council
Her Team Full Circle kickboxing team-
mates, who have been first-hand witnesses to 
her skill in the ring, could never see her as Sorority Mia, the one who, despite her tom-boy-like tendencies, enjoys painting her nails, or Student Government Mia, the one who’s passionate about event planning.
“You’ll never meet anyone else like her,” 
said Dawn Roffey, who coached Kelly in the 2008 Junior World Championships in Italy. “Mia is enthusiastic. She’s self-disciplined, sure of herself, but never cocky.”
Kelly is not, indeed, the usual competitor. 
In high school, she managed to be, as Roffey describes, a “super-A student,” while being very involved in theatre and, of course, kick-boxing.
Despite her passion for kickboxing, Kelly 
has scaled back on training in order to get ad-justed to college life.
By day she takes classes in her major, psy-
chology, as well as in other areas she’s think-ing of pursuing, such as English and journal-ism.
By night, she works on internal event 
programming for the Freshman Leadership Council, a Student Government program-ming cabinet.
In the beginning of spring semester, Kelly 
also devoted some of her time to attaining a certification as a Group Fitness Instructor, with which she hopes to develop and teach a kickboxing group fitness class for the UF De-partment of Recreational Sports.
On top of it all, Kelly trained to compete 
in the Irish Open. This past Spring Break, she traveled to Dublin, Ireland, to participate in the 18- to 29-year-old category for women weighing less than about 140 pounds, where she advanced to the third round. This tour -
nament was one of the few she chose to take part in while she focused on college.
“I wish I could compete at the same level I 
was before, but I’m competing against wom-en who own karate schools and devote their life to training,” she said. “Kickboxing is their life, but I want more.”And while Kelly hasn’t decided exactly 
what she wants to do with her life, she knows that, even if she’s not competing profession-ally, kickboxing will always be a part of it.
For now, though, Kelly is just a college 
student trying to balance school, club in-volvement, kickboxing and a social life.
How does she do it?“She doesn’t sleep a lot,” her mentor and 
FLC Cabinet Director Chris Raleigh jokes. “But she’s handled everything per -
fectly. She’s very focused.”
Raleigh thinks it’s her 
kickboxing training that 
has helped Kelly manage it all. 
“When you fight, you 
can’t be worrying about 
what you did; you have to focus on the next thing and think two or three steps ahead,” he said.
Now that the Irish Open is over, however, 
Kelly’s workload has lightened.
“I woke up late today,” she said. She woke at 9:30 a.m. for the first time since she began training for the Irish Open. “It was wonder -
ful.”
Kelly has now been able to focus on her 
other passion: music.
This summer, Kelly is planning to attend 
the four-day Bonnaroo music festival in Ten-nessee with acts ranging from electronica, bluegrass, hip-hop and indie rock.
Kelly’s musical taste is just as broad as the 
Bonnaroo lineup. She’s been known to rap Drake’s “The Motto” to her teammates before a kickboxing match, and, if her iPhone were put on shuffle, it could easily go from Britney Spears’ “Toxic” to “Trapeze Swinger,” a song by indie rock artist Iron & Wine.
When asked to pick a favorite song, Kelly 
said it had to be a song by The Beatles or Jimi Hendrix, but then she switched her pick to “Three Little Birds” by Bob Marley.
After a few more favorite options, includ-
ing songs by Fleetwood Mac and John Len-non, the kickboxing world champion threw her hands in the air and said, “This is just too hard. I can’t do this.”

Breathe Carolina will co-headline 
a show with The Ready Set in down-
town Gainesville tonight. Hailing all the way from Denver, the band al-ready has three full-length albums under its belt, but its meteoric rise came just this past year. The single “Blackout,” released on June 14, was certified gold early last month and has spent 20 weeks on The Billboard Hot 100 chart peaking at No. 32.
Breathe Carolina started in 2007 
when good friends Kyle Even and David Schmitt formed the band after performing in other musical groups and began recording some songs for fun. Many fans know the story about how the band recorded a few songs on GarageBand, posted them on MySpace and got millions of hits, but few know just how dis-tinct the band is.
Breathe Carolina is not trying to 
fit into just one genre; rather, they are just writing songs to have fun, experimenting with their music and coming up with new sounds to keep things fresh. The band tries to make music that people can relate to as a part of their lives. In an interview, Even said the music his band makes is like an entire movie collection because its music covers all sorts of genres from horror, to comedy , to drama and even chick flicks. He says the wide variety of art is not just in the lyrics but the music as well.After having two albums under 
its belt and the strong hope to keep on growing, the band wanted to take a shot at radio. Their newest album, “Hell Is What You Make It,” was re-corded last year starting with their hit single, “Blackout.” Much to Even and Schmitt’s satisfaction, the single was their ticket into the mainstream. Even said he was glad “Blackout” 
ended up being a song that the label wanted to push, especially because the band had a blast writing it and only a few days with producer Ian 
Kirkpatrick to do so.
With their wild success becom-
ing reality , Breathe Carolina signed with Columbia Records in Decem-ber 2011. Signing with Columbia Records was a big deal for Breathe Carolina because the record label has signed famed artists such as Adele, J. Cole and MGMT. 
The band said being among the 
likes of these artists is a humbling experience. It thinks of itself as the “baby band” of the group and is stoked that people like what they do.
Still, after making it big and be-
coming a household name, the band stays modest. Even stated he and Schmitt have known each other for nine years, and he will try to stay 21 at heart forever and just have fun.
Tonight’s show will be the big-
gest show that Breathe Carolina has played in Gainesville; they have only performed at smaller venues before. The band said touring the nation is such a fun and exciting experience for them, and this tour, the Blackout Forever Tour, will continue until the end of April.
It was also recently announced 
that Breathe Carolina will be play-ing in the 2012 Vans Warped Tour starting on June 16. One of the lo-cal promoters of this event, Glory Days, also expects this to be a huge event, especially with Gainesville’s Warped Tour crowd. 
Another big promoter, local ra-
dio station KISS 105.3, plays songs by Breathe Carolina and The Ready Set frequently . Local sensation Of Valleys recently had a five-day streak on “Power Plays,” the radio station’s nightly call-in poll.

Florida coach Tim Walton walks back to the dugout after a team meeting during the Gators’ 4-1 loss to USF on Wednesday night. Freshman Lauren Haeger picked up the loss, allowing two earned runs. 
JONATHAN CZUPRYN
Alligator Writer
 
Lauren Haeger proved she 
was a fighter Wednesday night. 
Still, she came out beaten and bruised.
Florida (29-3) dropped its third 
game of the year, this time at the hands of a vengeful South Florida (30-5) team. The Gators marched into Tampa in early February to take every game of the USF-Fair -
field Inn & Suites Tampa North Tournament, including a 3-2 vic-tory in extra-innings against the Bulls.
Haeger started against USF on 
Feb. 12, but relied on sophomore Hannah Rogers to bail her out of a close game. This time around, coach Tim Walton left Haeger in the circle the entire game to take all the blows the Bulls dealt her in a 4-1 defeat.
“It’s important to me for (Hae-
ger) to understand, ‘You started it so finish it,’” Walton said. “If she would have backed out of that, then I might have lost a little bit for her but she was honest. She said she had enough to get out of it and prove it to me. Obviously I’m not happy with the outcome, but we showed some character and some guts.”
The Gators looked on as the 
Bulls loaded the bases on two walks and a single, quickly scor -
ing two runs in the first inning. 
After Haeger allowed two hits 
to start the third, USF put two more across the plate thanks to an error at second by Jessica Damico and a sacrifice fly.
“The first inning made me a 
little tight,” Haeger said. “Giving up two runs in the first inning is not what anyone wants to do.
“We just came out a little flat. 
(Walton) asked me if I could fin-ish out the game and I knew I could, and I needed that.”
When Florida’s offense did get 
the chance to reduce the deficit, it crumbled under the pressure. 
The Gators had trailed af-
ter one inning just twice before, including a comeback victory against No. 4 Tennessee on March 10. But there was no comeback Wednesday night as the UF bats remained silent nearly the entire Second-ranked Florida drops home game to South Florida

Amanda O’Leary wanted some un-
familiar faces to make big contributions 
Wednesday night.
The Gators provided that and much 
more.
No. 4 Florida (11-2) routed Fresno 
State (2-5) 29-0 in the most lopsided game in the program’s three-year his-tory. 
It was first time the Gators had ever 
shut out an opponent, and the 29 goals broke a UF single-game record of 23 set earlier this season against Siena.
“It was really about our people who 
haven’t really been needed to step up, really had to step up,” O’Leary said. “And I thought they did that.”
Junior attacker Kitty Cullen, Flor -
ida’s leading scorer heading into the game, did not play due to a concussion suffered in a 10-8 win at Ohio State on Saturday.
The Gators were also without two 
other key contributors as junior mid-fielder Brittany Dashiell, their fourth-leading scorer, and freshmen Shannon Gilroy, the team’s leader in draw con-trols, both missed the game with inju-ries that O’Leary chose not to disclose.
“I’m not allowed to talk about them, 
I don’t think,” O’Leary said of the inju-
ries. “Sorry.”
Those who 
did play were more than ef-
fective, scoring 17 goals on 23 first-half shots.
“We definitely filled their shoes pret-
ty well,” freshman midfielder Nicole Graziano said.
Graziano, who had just 10 goals and 
five assists prior to the win, shouldered her fair share of the scoring load with UF almost scores 30 in routSPRING FOOTBALL

Although much of the attention on the de-
fensive side of the ball this spring has been 
focused on creating more turnovers, Florida and defensive coordinator Dan Quinn are also looking for an improved pass rush. 
Last season, the Gators ranked 37th in the 
nation and sixth in the Southeastern Confer -
ence in sacks with just 28. Florida recorded only one sack against the conference elite of Alabama and LSU and just five during a four-game losing streak in October. Ronald Powell led the team with six, and no other returning player had more than three. 
Therefore, Quinn said he’s looking to 
Sharrif Floyd, who has been tasked with playing both inside and outside the last two seasons, and incoming junior college tackle Damien Jacobs to pick up the load. Quinn said Floyd, Jacobs and Powell have “pro-vided probably the most rush for us so far in this spring.”
“The turnovers are a team thing,” Quinn said. “Rush and affecting the quarterback — at times we’ll do it with pressure and at times we’ll do it with a four-man rush. We’ve been working hard at it, and I think we’ll see the benefit of that.”
Although Floyd has been playing outside 
at the end spot because of a lack of depth along the defensive line, Quinn said a move back inside to the tackle spot opposite Do-
minique Easley is possible once several incoming freshman arrive for fall camp. 
In this class, Florida 
has five defensive ends 
— Jonathan Bullard, Alex McCalister, Dante Fowl-er Jr., Bryan Cox Jr. and 
Quinteze Williams — that will arrive in Au-gust, and Quinn said they could contribute early depending on how quickly they prog-ress. Earl Okine, Kedric Johnson and Leren-tee McCray are also options, but they will also miss spring practice due to injury. Florida wants improved pass rush

contest.
Ironically, it was Haeger who prevented her team 
from being shutout for the second time this season. In 
the fourth, she launched a solo shot to put the Gators on the board.
The Gators could not handle the Bulls’ sophomore 
pitcher Sara Nevins, who ranks among the top-10 in the country in victories (17) and strikeouts (166) while leading all players in ERA (0.57).
Junior Kelsey Horton won the first game against USF 
this year with an eighth-inning home run off Nevins.
“She did a really good job keeping us off balance,” 
Horton said. 
“She was lefty, so it’s a little bit different of a look. 
She throws hard. ... We were playing a little tight [Wednesday], which is uncharacteristic of us. We came out flat and that’s the biggest reason we lost.”
The Gators threatened to make a comeback in the 
bottom of the seventh with two on and two out. Rep-resenting the tying run at the plate was Haeger, who 
could have tied the game with her sec-ond home run of the day. 
Instead, she struck out swinging.
“I got a little anxious at the end,” 
Haeger said. 
“I was swinging for the fences and 
I shouldn’t have. That’s the game. The game is made for you to fail. They came to win so they did. It’s hard to 
swallow, but I think it just gave us that fire that we needed to get our bats going and to prove to people that will never happen again.”“We’re counting on some players who are not par -
ticipating this spring to provide some rush for us,” 
he said. “That would certainly be one of the ways we could possibly go.”
Floyd will likely play both spots this season, regard-
less, because he has the ability to play multiple tech-niques effectively, Quinn said. Floyd will be used as an end in 4-3 sets on first and second down and switch inside to tackle for nickel situations on third downs. 
According to Quinn, Floyd can play both spots 
without it effecting his development at tackle, his natu-ral position and a spot Quinn said he would ultimately like to be able to move Floyd back to. 
“I’d like to put him there. I 
think he’s a good spot there,” Quinn said. “He adds value for me for our defense because I 
know he can do it at end. My goal, when we get every-body here with a mix of guys, let’s put guys in the best spot to help us win.”
Jacobs seems to factor heavily into the Gators’ plans 
for 2012, but he has also been the target of criticism for his inconsistency thus far in spring. There is an adjust-ment period that comes with the switch from junior college to the SEC, and Quinn said it was paramount Jacobs enroll early and be here for spring. 
“It’s a whole new system — that’s hard to learn in 
just a training camp, not just for a lineman and it’s not just necessarily the plays,” he said. “A lot of the big guys can learn the plays. It’s not rocket science exactly what we’re doing on the defensive line. But there is a lot of technical play.”

six goals on seven shots.
With Gilroy out, Graziano also 
contributed on the draw with a game-
high four draw controls. 
“I kind of knew how to do it a little, 
I guess,” Graziano said. “I didn’t real-ly know how to line up. … I definitely just tried to muscle it out to someone on my team so they could get the ball and, if it went up in the air, I tried to just box out the girl. Just mimic what Gilroy or Brittany would do.”
The injuries allowed players with 
limited playing time this season to see significant minutes against the Bull-dogs. Non-starters Colby Rhea, Erin Graziano, Krista Grabher and Taylor McCord combined for eight goals and three assists.
Florida was dominant from the 
outset, going up 10 goals less than 10 minutes into the game while not al-lowing Fresno State to get a shot off until more than 21 minutes into the first half.
Junior defender Sam Farrell gave 
the offensive players much of the credit for the shutout.
“When they were trying to clear 
the ball out, we got a lot of turnovers that way,” Farrell said. “That was the attack working hard after they lost the ball.”
Farrell said she and the rest of the 
defenders kept up their intensity for all 60 minutes, which helped limit the Bulldogs to just five shots on the night.
Freshman defender Mick Offit also 
saw her first action since March 17 against William & Mary, and O’Leary said all of the minutes non-starters re-ceived will be beneficial with the re-mainder of the ALC schedule ahead.
“The fact that we could put some 
new faces out there and they respond-ed very well gives me a good feeling that we can utilize them at any mo-ment in time.”
