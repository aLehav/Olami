MACHEN SUPPORTS THE ACT.

With the next session for the 
U.S. Congress looming, local sup-
porters of the DREAM Act stood 
on the steps of Tigert Hall to drum up support for legislation.
In a statement read by UF pro-
fessor Paul Ortiz, UF President 
Bernie Machen said he supports 
the legislation because everyone should have equal access to edu-cation.
“By supporting this federal 
legislation, we are acknowledging that education is a human right and that these students, regard-less of citizenship status, should 
have equal access to institutions 
of higher education,” he wrote.
City commissioner Jeanna 
Mastrodicasa spoke on behalf of 
Mayor Craig Lowe in support of the act, which would create a 
means for undocumented youth to gain citizenship.
Mastrodicasa, who is also an 
assistant vice president for stu-
dent affairs at UF, said the act will 
allow young people who want to contribute to society to be rec-ognized by the country they call 
home.
She also noted the increases in 
tax revenue that would ensue.
“They will work more and pay 
more taxes,” she said.
Local supporters introduced 
an undocumented 19-year-old 
Gainesville college student, who wished to remain anonymous, to 
publicly share her story for the 
first time.
An aspiring journalist who 
has been in the country for more than half of her life, she said she 
just wants the ability to follow her 
dream, as do many in her situa-tion.
“I think that they deserve to be 
called an American,” she said.
GOLDEN, Colo.  — A Denver-area man 
might have to go to court to keep city officials 
from tearing down an elaborate backyard treehouse local officials say is hazardous.
Sculptor Duncan Foss of Golden faced a 
deadline of 4 p.m. Monday to take down the treehouse or face legal action. Foss says he’s not taking down the hangout he built for his 11-year-old daughter.
City spokeswoman Karlyn Tilley says 
Golden’s chief building official will meet with the city attorney Tuesday. 
The city likely will issue a summons that 
could result in a fine.
Foss’s backyard structure consists of a 
rambling series of bright blue decks and el-evated boardwalks. 
Local building officials consider it a haz-
ard. Part of the treehouse burned in Decem-ber because of an exploding tiki torch.

As the temperature drops and the number of 
sniffles begins to go up, students are being urged 
to get their vaccinations in anticipation for flu 
season.
In an attempt to limit flu presence on campus, 
UF is giving free flu vaccinations to students.
Guy Nicolette, associate director for clinical 
services at the Student Health Care Center, said  
there was a significant interest in the vaccine last year due to the H1N1 virus. Because of this in-creased interest, Nicolette said, the school dou-bled the number of vaccinations ordered from 
5,000 to 10,000.
“We typically order about 5,000 doses per year 
and use almost all of them,” Nicolette said. “This 
year we ordered 10,000 doses as we planned a campaign to give the students free flu shots and expected a bit higher demand. So far, we have gone through about 5,000 doses.”
Nicolette said the flu is no more prevalent on 
UF’s campus than on any other college campus.  However, he still believes it is important for stu-dents to get the vaccine because viruses such as 
the flu spread rapidly in areas such as college campuses, where large populations of people are 
in close proximity to each other.
“The best way to protect yourself from this vi-
rus, because there are no antibiotics for this virus, 
is to prevent the illness from happening in the 
first place with the vaccination,” Nicolette said.
Places on campus that offer vaccinations in-
clude the Outreach Clinic, which will be at the Reitz Union Tuesday, Nov. 15 to Nov. 17 and Nov. 19 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., and at the Special Clinics at the SHCC. Vaccinations are given out at the Special Clinics Mondays, Tuesdays, Thurs-
days and Fridays from 8 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. and 
Wednesdays from 9 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. to 4 p.m.
The SHCC@Shands is open Monday through 
Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. for vaccinations, as well.  While vaccinations are free for students, employee vaccinations are available for $25.UF offers free flu vaccines

TALLAHASSEE — A man who trapped and killed an 
alligator so big it pulled his boat around a lake has snared 
what authorities say is Florida’s longest gator on record, 
exceeding 14 feet.
Wildlife officials say the gator caught by Robert Ammer -
man, a nurse who traps gators as a hobby, 
weighed 654 pounds and measured 14 feet, 3 1/2 inches. It was caught Nov. 1, 
the last day of Florida’s alligator harvest, in Lake Washington near Melbourne.
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Con-
servation Commission says the previous 
record was a 14-foot, 5/8-inch alligator 
trapped in 1997. The state’s heaviest ga-
tor on record was taken in 1989, weighing 1,043 pounds.
Ammerman said the gator thrashed and pulled his boat 
for about 45 minutes after being harpooned and took two hours to tow to dock.Gator sets record

For students looking to show 
their appreciation for the men and 
women who serve in the armed forc-es, Gainesville offers opportunities that extend from V eterans Day this 
Thursday through the weekend.
For Ed Van Buren, command-
er of American Legion Post 16 in 
Gainesville, a thank you is all it takes. 
“I simply want people to recog-
nize the sacrifices they [members of the armed services] have made,” Van Buren said. “A simple thank 
you is the most meaningful way.”
Van Buren was on active duty 
from 1969 to 1971 and was stationed 
in South Korea.
There will be community com-
memorative events at Kanapaha Park on Thursday beginning at 8:30 a.m. with patriotic music and an air -
plane flyover. The formal program, 
which begins at 11:00 a.m., includes 
poetry and a presentation by UF’s Air Force ROTC. Van Buren antici-pates that hundreds of veterans will 
be at the gardens for the celebration. 
Staff Sgt. Francisco Piquet, an 
Army recruiter, will be at the cel-
ebration with active duty members, reserves and cadets representing all military branches, he said. 
Freshman Jacob Prentis will be 
marching in uniform with the UF Air Force ROTC. 
“I believe that students should 
wear red, white and blue,” Prentis said. “They should come out and see the veterans there. Just see a veteran and thank them for what they have done.”
On V eterans Day , Piquet said he 
remembers fellow servicemen from his generation and past eras.
“We are all one big family,” Pi-quet said. “At the end of day we all work for the same thing: to protect the United States.”
Saturday’s football game is also 
designated as Military Appreciation 
Day . Soldiers will lead the football 
team onto the field, help with the coin toss and give a presentation on the field. There will also be ROTC cadets in semi-formal uniforms sta-tioned around the stadium.
On Sunday , Santa Fe College will 
host the All American Liberty Fest in celebration of V eterans Day . 
There will be events for all ages, 
ranging from a motorcycle ride to live music. The Liberty Fest will be-gin at 11 a.m. and last until 4 p.m. Both the Liberty Fest and the com-memorative events at Kanapaha are free and open to the Gainesville community . 
Many of the city’s restaurants 
will show their appreciation by pro-viding servicemen and women with free food.
“I’m going to hit up Hooters for 
lunch, Applebee’s for dinner,” Pi-quet said.Area events to honor Veterans

MONDAYS FROM 10:30 A.M. TO 4 P.M. ON THE PLAZA OF THE AMERICAS.
By SAMANTHA LIEBHABER
Alligator Contributing Writer
On Mondays joining the snooz-
ing sunbathers   on the Plaza of the Americas, there is a large pink couch, a coffee table and lawn chairs.
Asha Singh, a visiting intern re-
cruiter for The Washington Center, walked up to the couch and the stu-dents lounging on it.
“Is this like that Kleenex tissue 
commercial where people sit on the couch and cry?” she asked. 
Minutes later, Singh, 23, was sit-
ting and talking to students about her job, life and childhood.
“I’m literally slouching and curs-
ing,” she said. “I can’t do this on the job.”
Her casual chat was part of Cam-
pus Crusade for Christ’s Couch Talk, a new program every Monday from 10:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.
The inspiration for the program 
came from the concept of a “reversal confessional” from the book “Blue Like Jazz” by Donald Miller. A “reversal confessional” is the 
opposite of normal confessional, in which a person confesses to a min-ister.
The club took the new religious concept and implemented it at UF about a year ago with just two chairs and one member listening to stu-dents.
Catholics complained that the name of the program, “reverse con-fessional,” was offensive, said Nate Schweigert, the club’s outreach team leader.  
As a result, the organization changed the name of the program, added a couch and made the experi-ence more casual.
Schweigert said members take 
hourly shifts sitting on the donated couch to listen to students talk about their feelings, experiences and lives.
The goal is to show people on 
campus that there are people who care for them, he said.
He added that people love to 
sit down and talk about things like their day, a test and sometimes spiri-tuality.
“We’re not there to only talk 
about religion,” he said. “We want to talk about life.”
Member Jose Vasquez, a linguis-
tics sophomore, said the program has evolved past spiritual conversa-tions.
“People want to talk about them-
selves, and we provide that outlet,” he said. 
A homeless man sat down and 
talked about his travels one time, 
Vasquez said. 
Member Aria Davison, a public 
relations sophomore, said she likes 
Couch Talk because it helps to estab-lish relationships between people.
“There are so many people here,” 
she said. “I want to know who I’m on campus with.”4, ALLIGATOR  TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 2010

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
WASHINGTON — Scientists say they have 
for the first time tracked how certain nontoxic 
elements of oil from the BP spill quickly be-
came dinner for plankton, entering the food 
web in the Gulf of Mexico.
The new study sheds light on two key ques-
tions about the aftermath of the 172 million-
gallon spill in April: What happened to the oil 
that once covered the water’s surface and will it work its way into the diets of Gulf marine life?
“Everybody is making a huge deal of where 
did the oil go,” said chief study author William “Monty” Graham, a plankton expert at the Dauphin Island Sea Lab in Alabama. “It just became food.”
The study didn’t specifically track the toxic 
components of the oil that has people worried. It focused on the way the basic element carbon moved through the beginnings of the all-im-portant food web. Graham said the “eye-open-
ing” speed of how the oil components moved 
through the ecosystem may affect the overall health of the Gulf.
Michael Crosby of the Mote Marine Labora-
tory in Florida didn’t take part in the study but said what fascinated him was that the carbon zipped through the food web faster than scien-tists expected. That in itself isn’t alarming, but if the nontoxic part of the oil is moving so rap-
idly through the food web, Crosby asks: “What 
has happened to the toxic compounds of the released oil?”
Graham said it was too hard to study the 
toxins in tiny plankton, which are plant and animal life, usually microscopic. So he had to go with an indicator that’s easier to track: the ratio of different types of carbon in microbes and plankton around and even under the BP oil slick. That important ratio jumped 20 per -
cent, showing oil in the food web.
By late September the carbon ratios in mi-
croscopic life had returned to normal, Graham said.
Graham emphasized that the results of his 
research don’t mean the plankton, the fish that feed on it or the people who eat Gulf sea-food are at any risk. What he found, he said, is merely a biomarker that shows the movement of spill-related carbon through the food chain. 
Much of the plankton he studied was “swim-
ming around and doing great” and in equal or higher numbers than before the spill, he said.
Graham’s study, released 
Monday, is published in En-vironmental Research Let-ters. It was mostly funded by 
the National Science Foun-dation, with additional mon-
ey from the state of Alabama 
and BP’s Gulf Research Ini-tiative, which distributed 
money through the Northern Gulf Institute in 
Mississippi.
For Graham it’s noteworthy how voracious 
the oil-munching bacteria were: “The microbes 
came to the rescue.” After they snacked on the surface oil, other microscopic sea life ate the 
microbes and were, in turn, chomped on by 
zooplankton, tiny animals.
Larry McKinney, director of a Gulf research 
institute at Texas A&M University in Corpus Christi, said the study confirms what scientists 
had expected. The big question is will it affect 
eggs and larvae and next year’s production of shrimp, crabs and fish, McKinney said.Study: Gulf oil is in the food webPHILANTHROPY

UF students will raise money to 
help children who can’t help them-
selves Tuesday night.
The UF Invisible Children chap-
ter will host a benefit concert Tues-day at 9 p.m. at The Vault to raise money for Ugandan children affect-ed by  rebel war.
Briana Banos, Invisible Children 
director of events, said she joined the organization because she was searching around campus for a 
cause she really loved.
Banos planned Tuesday’s benefit 
concert.
Invisible Children aims to have 
one benefit concert during the fall 
and spring semesters.
This concert will have perfor -
mances by local artists Chad Papa, The Sedoctaves, Jesse Lash and Sue-liPop. Each artist or singing group will donate their time and perfor -
mance to the concert to benefit the Ugandan children.
“It’s the best way to make the 
biggest profit with one event,” Ba-nos said. “It’s a way to not only help local artists but spread awareness in a fun way.”
Banos and other members are 
pre-selling tickets to the event for $5, and tickets at the door will be $6 for those over 21 and $8 for those under 21.
In past concerts, the organization 
raised almost $2,000 in spring 2009 and about $1,200 during the fall 2009 event.
Belinda Smith, UF Invisible Chil-dren president, explained the reason the chapter is hosting the benefit concert.
The Awere Secondary School in 
Gulo, Uganda, is the sister school for the UF chapter, meaning funds raised go to benefit Awere.
The school was destroyed during 
the war and has been displaced for 18 years. The girls’ and boys’ dormi-tories and science wing still need to be completed, but the school is func-tional, according to Smith.
Because education in Uganda 
beyond middle school must be paid for, the UF chapter works toward 
raising funds to help the children.
“A lot of times it gets really cool 
because we try to add some sort of 
education out of it,” she said.
Edward Bennett, the UF Invisible 
Children vice president, said he is looking forward to the Sedoctaves’ performance because they take re-quests and it becomes really interac-
tive.
He said there is always a different 
line up, which makes it interesting.
“Nice we can enjoy ourselves 
while helping our cause,” Bennett 
said.Benefit concert to help

Wozniak, who wore an iPod Nano on his right wrist, 
spoke to a crowd of 1,724 and was paid $70,000 to 
speak.
A mutual friend introduced Wozniak and Jobs. 
Wozniak said Jobs was the businessman and he was the engineer. But he said some people found Jobs hard to work with.
“He’s kind of abrasive,” he said. “That’s how he is.”
Wozniak said Jobs convinced him to sell the Apple I. 
He said that Jobs said, “It doesn’t matter if we make 
a profit. The two of us will have a company, something we’ve always wanted.”
Before he knew it, they had a $50,000 offer for their 
computers. They bought the chips on credit and got paid for the computers upon delivery.
But he said he never wanted the success that Apple 
brought, and he strove to make sure the success didn’t 
change him.
Wozniak said he completed his degree at the Univer -
sity of California at Berkeley — he said he used the fake 
name Rocky Clark — and taught fifth grade for eight years.
“One of the most important things in life is knowing 
who you are,” he said.
Richard Brooks, a mechanical engineering major, said 
he feels that he can identify with Wozniak.
“He’s like a living legend to me,” he said. “Where 
I’m at now was kind of where he was at before he made it big.”

A can of Dr Pepper is about $1, but much more than chump 
change is at stake for UF student Kevin Parza.
A prize of $123,000 looms between Parza and the giant Dr 
Pepper can he’ll throw footballs into for a scholarship if he ad-
vances past a preliminary contest against four semifinalists. 
The Dr Pepper Million Dollar Tuition Giveaway will chal-
lenge two finalists at the Southeastern Conference Champion-ship Game in Atlanta on Dec. 4 to throw the most footballs into the oversized can, located 5 yards away . “I practice throws three times a week for one hour,” Parza 
said. “I feel a bit of pressure, but I’m just thankful either way. Plus, I get two tickets to the SEC game, which is wonderful.” 
If Parza makes it to the football-throwing standoff and loses, 
he’ll still be awarded $23,000. But if he wins, the 19-year-old pre-med student said the lump sum will help him pay for med-ical school. 
Parza’s entry was chosen from thousands of Dr Pepper-
themed videos submitted to Dr Pepper and judged by a panel that included ESPN college football analyst and Hall of Fame head coach Lou Holtz. 
“Kevin rapped about Dr Pepper, and his creativity made 
him stand out,” said Jason Genthner, a spokesman for Dr Pep-per. “The entries were judged on a range of criteria, such as impact of tuition and their inclusion of the Dr Pepper theme.”
 Genthner said the challenge of throwing footballs into a 
nearby target only seems like an easy feat. The contestants have been given six weeks to train.Student to toss footballs into giant can for money

Determined to keep the curtain from fall-
ing on William Shakespeare, a new thespian troupe called Shakespeare in the Swamp will perform two free, local shows a year.
“With the economy in question, we 
thought it was only fair to bring this aspect of culture to the Gainesville community,” said Michael Cormier, president of Shakespeare in the Swamp. “Plus, we’re not even in a theater. We’re bringing it to you.”
As an opening venture, Shakespeare in 
the Swamp will partner with the Acrosstown Repertory Theatre for a production of “The Tempest.” Auditions will be held Nov. 14 at 3 
p.m. and Nov. 16 at 6 p.m. at the ART.
According to Ted Lewis, Buchholz High 
School drama director, there is a definite de-
sire for Shakespeare in Gainesville. He charg-es minimal admission to Shakespeare shows and has seen as large an audience for them as large-scale musicals.“I think there’s a new awareness begin-
ning to emerge,” he said. “We haven’t seen enough Shakespeare in Gainesville in a really long time.”
As much as he enjoys it now, Cormier said 
his relationship with Shakespeare did not start with love at first sight.
“I, like every other American high school 
student, pretty much didn’t like it,” he said.
Cormier changed his mind when his dra-
ma department put on “Romeo and Juliet.” He said he was lucky to be a part of the pro-
duction because his director taught him to 
use tone and body language to convey the meaning behind the lines. 
“Reading it, it’s confusing,” he said. “It 
doesn’t really make sense. When you per -
form it, it makes sense.”New theater troupe seeks

Beginning today and lasting through-
out  November, the organization Global 
Nomads will be collecting donations for its project, Support a Pregnancy, on Tur -
lington Plaza from noon to 4 p.m. 
A $15 donation will sponsor one 
pregnant woman in Bangladesh for checkups, the hospital stay during the actual delivery of the baby and neona-tal care. The donation also contributes to child care education for the women, provided by the nurses. 
Mahmuda Akhter, the president of 
the Global Nomads, hopes the organiza-
tion  will be able to sponsor at least 100 
pregnancies by passing on all money di-rectly to the women with no administra-tive costs.
“There’s no amount of money that 
can equate to a human life,” Akhter said. 
“A pregnancy here costs so much mon-
ey . But just because over there it takes a small amount of money , it doesn’t mean 
they’re worth any less.”
Some Bangladeshi women remain 
under extreme stress during pregnancy 
because of lack of food, abusive hus-bands and other critical problems that people in the U.S. might not always con-sider or face, Akhter said. Bangladesh does not lack medical training, but the 
country’s poverty rate is 
so high that doctors of-
ten leave due to a short-age of medical supplies, endangering the lives of 
the pregnant women.
Sanjida Shahalam, vice president of 
Global Nomads, agreed to raise money for the impoverished pregnant women as soon as Akhter pitched the project. 
“At the end of the day , someone 
needs your help,” Shahalam said. “We always say we want to change the world, but you realize that you can. We can do something tangible.”

Domestic troubles follow 
Obama on Asian visit
We don’t blame him for getting the heck out of 
here on the first plane out east. 
Following the midterm election bloodbath 
that washed the nation in red, President Barack Obama took a much-needed trip to Asia, where on Sunday he spoke in India about India’s love-hate relationship with Pakistan, peacemaking efforts abroad and, what else, but 
the Republican domination back home. 
Not even here, thousands of miles away in New Delhi, 
is the commander in chief immune to prods about how he 
plans to get anything done in Washington now. Not even here is our president safe from the notions of seemingly 
inevitable failure during the next two years.
But the discussion of how Obama plans to play outside 
party lines didn’t come from a Washington reporter. 
Rather, an Indian college student wanted some clarifi-
cation on how the leader of the free world plans to rule 
sans supermajority.
And as our president travels through Asia during the 
coming days to focus on peacekeeping efforts in heavily Muslim areas, including the largest Muslim nation of In-
donesia, and to address the nuclear relationship between 
Pakistan and India, there’s one thing Obama has already learned: There’s no escaping the troubles back home. 
Team America
In a move that can only be labeled as an attempt to become the super-
exclusive “Mean Girls” of Capitol Hill, GOP-elected officials rallied behind an agenda Sunday based largely 
on bullying their boss: Mr. 
President. 
Riding their wave of sup-
posed voter anger, Republi-can officials united in their 
determination to force these 
great United States into a massive two-year traffic jam. 
Mainly saying they would 
only agree to work with the president on their terms, Re-publican lawmakers left little room for doubt on how they (don’t) intend to compromise 
and on their full intentions 
to force the country into a standstill until 2012, when they hope to oust President 
Barack Obama and bring in a 
“better Senate.” 
We’re all for getting what 
we want and fighting for what we deserve, but this just 
isn’t going to work, America. Although we fully ap-
plaud the GOP’s public ef-
forts to repeal the historic 
health care bill that allows 
college students to remain on their parents’ insurance plans until they’re 26 and that man-
dates Americans cannot be 
denied health insurance for having a pre-existing condi-tion, it just isn’t going to hap-pen.
We’re far from swearing 
in the new members of Con-gress, and we’re already tired of the bickering.
This isn’t one big Amer -
ica-sized version of Team Kristin vs. Team LC. This is Team America. 
But when Rep. Eric Can-
tor, in line to become House majority leader, says things like, “First and foremost, we’re not going to be willing 
to work with [Obama]...,” we 
realize the nation might have just been better off when the Dems had a supermajority.
At least then we got stuff 
done.Supreme Court should leave video games alone
The Supreme Court has agreed to hear several cases that will further define the freedoms of speech that are protected by the First Amendment, but only 
one case prominently involves Arnold Schwarzenegger and the tenuous link between Mortal Kombat and par -
enting skills.
Schwarzenegger v. EMA, which came across the 
court’s docket last week, examines a California statute that puts real teeth behind the voluntary video game ratings system by slapping thousands of dollars in fines 
on stores that sell inappropriate games to minors.  
Forget for a moment that most of the studies linking 
violent video games to violent behavior are inconclu-
sive at best. 
And forget that, as lawyers arguing against the Cali-
fornia law so eloquently put it in Supreme Court testi-mony last week, violent crime has plummeted in this country since “Doom” first graced computer screens. 
It would take a great deal of persuasion to convince 
me that a law rising from the steaming pile of wreckage that is the great state of California would be a piece of legislation that the rest of the country should emulate, let alone a law curbing the amount of violent content in media that bears the name of former action star Arnold 
Schwarzenegger.
Perhaps I would consider a law from California that 
requires parents-to-be in hospitals to successfully navi-
gate a video game in order to access certain state pro-
grams, but even then I would be dubious.
The game would have to be narrowly tailored to es-
tablish a minimum baseline for what is expected of par -
ents in society today, allow for equal access and have a 
range of language options.
Wait, I see this law coming together before my very eyes.
“Call of Duty: Parenting 2K10” 
would be a digital representa-tion of a short trip to the grocery store and back home, with points awarded for avoiding the pitfalls 
of everyday life and a score given 
at the end that presumably corre-sponds to your relative fitness as a 
parent.
Mom and Dad would each have to navigate their 
way to and from the store without crashing their simu-lated car or stopping off at a friend’s house to buy meth. 
Once at the grocery store, a purchase must be made that 
would provide at least one nutritional meal (including at least one serving of vegetables and/or fruit) and does not include any ingredients that are commonly used in 
the production of methamphetamines.
The more I think about it, the more absurd this all 
seems. 
A video game is no way to determine how someone 
would function as a parent, and fining the store who 
sold your kid an unsavory game is not going to make you any less culpable for the actions of the little person you are supposed to be keeping an eye on.
Try as we might, we are unable to legislate good par -
enting. 
When it comes to whether or not American moms 
and dads are guiding the next generation with a watch-ful eye, I humbly borrow the sentiments of old-school Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart.

 Our generation is one of change and 
progress. We revolutionized the Inter-net. We elected a black president. And 
we are legalizing same-sex marriage. Now, we are beginning to reshape another age-old 
custom of our society: the American diet. Our 
generation deserves more than just Happy Meals. We deserve healthy meals.  
  One way to easily promote healthy meals is 
a Meatless Monday campaign, which Gators will be happy to know just began this week at UF.
  It’s no secret that eating your veggies is 
healthy and better for the environment, but 
the economic beneﬁ  ts of plant-based diets are 
often overlooked. In fact, the research stacks up overwhelmingly in favor of vegetarians. 
  As a result, Meatless Monday can be a tool 
not only to educate the public of the health beneﬁ  ts of plant-based diets, but also to real-ize the enormous economic implications of dietary choices in general.
  For starters, replacing that steak with 
whole grains is simply cheaper. Walk into any grocery store across America and the price comparison is evident. And more than that, a plant-based diet is far cheaper than just the few dollars saved at the market. If we add all the indirect subsidies the meat industry receives, the difference becomes substantial. Consider the fact that taxpayers spend more than $5 billion per year in subsidies to corn 
and feed producers in order to reduce the cost 
of raising an animal for slaughter. In addition, 
factory farms rely on government grants to manage widespread pollution and disease.  
  In just one example from last year, the fed-
eral government bought $150 million worth of H1N1-infected pork. 
  Regardless of any government’s or farmer’s 
actions, it still takes 15 to 20 pounds of grains to create a pound of meat, a ﬁ  gure that hasn’t 
changed since the of the Agricultural Revolu-
tion some 10,000 years ago. As such, there is no debate the most economic way to obtain our calories is to cut out meat.
  Beyond direct costs, let’s also consider the 
indirect economic implications of eating plants instead of animals. 
  A human’s chances of a future of heart 
disease, obesity , diabetes and many forms of 
cancer are  vastly decreased when following a 
vegetarian diet. 
  America currently devotes 16 percent of its 
GDP to health care, which begs the question: What would our health care costs be if we re-duced those diseases by eating less meat? As our country is already on a spending binge to stimulate the economy, why not be cognizant of how something as simple as changing our dietary choices can have huge payoff?
  Let’s use health care costs again to put this 
opportunity in perspective. 
  In 2010, total medical costs will exceed $2.3 
trillion. Heart disease alone will cost roughly $316 billion.  Every day in the media, we hear of difﬁ  cult budget cuts. Yet, we never hear how something as simple as modifying our diet can have massive effects on our nation’s budget or even on our own personal budgets.
  I realize it’s romantic to picture a vegetar-
ian nation, but I do believe strongly in our 
generation’s potential, especially student lead-
ers like the ones at UF who have succeeded in persuading UF to encourage a Meatless Mon-day. UF’s initiative to bring Meatless Monday to campus should be commended because this important initiative teaches a simple truth. As we further educate ourselves about what is possible, we can create signiﬁ  cant change and progress in our society.
  Naturally, Meatless Monday won’t elimi-
nate health care costs, reverse climate change or balance a school’s budget. But any small step toward positive change is surely worth taking.

Speaking Out Engineering student 
supports block tuition
  In response to Chris 
Moody’s Monday letter ad-
dressing the seemingly uni-
versal engineering student 
opposition to block tuition, I support block tuition. 
I am a senior in the mate-
rials science and engineering program, and for the past six fall/spring semesters, I have taken 15 credits or more. 
For the majority of those 
semesters, I was taking 17 to 18 credits, as well as being in-volved in research within the above-named department. 
  Although it may seem 
strange, I also had a large amount of free time. 
I don’t know what world 
people live in when they think 
12 credits somehow takes up 
their entire lives. 
  For some reason, no one 
seems to consider the beneﬁ  ts 
of block tuition for those who 
want to take more than 15 credits. 
  Are these people that much 
of a minority? Certainly not 
from what I’ve seen. 
I know many people who 
take 15 or more credits and 
would either be unaffected by 
block tuition or would   beneﬁ  t 
from it.
  If moving at your own pace 
through college means signing up for the minimum credits to 
be considered full time, then 
your pace is too slow.

 Scientists at Harvard and the University of California, San Diego, 
have provided evidence for the ﬁ  rst time of a gene that plays a role in shaping an individual’s political beliefs.
  The study, published last week in the October issue of The Journal 
of Politics, analyzed data from over 2,500 adolescents and found that 
a speciﬁ  c variation in a dopamine receptor gene normally associated 
with novelty-seeking can lead to more liberal political ideologies in an individual.
  However, the variation in the gene known as DRD4 only displayed 
an association with political liberalism if the subjects had an active so-cial life while growing up, according to the study.
  The principal author of the study and Professor of Medical Genet-
ics and Political Science at UC San Diego, James H. Fowler, explained novelty-seeking can lead to highly individualistic behavior.
  “If you also have an active social life, with people with different life-
styles and world views, you are much more likely to develop liberal views,” he added.
  Fowler emphasized that the results of the 
study show a combination between one’s envi-ronment and one’s genes determines political 
ideology, not simply one or the other.
  “We studied the gene because we have already been studying the 
environment ad nauseam,” Fowler said. “This way of thinking assumes we are all blank slates, and that’s just not true.”
  Fowler and his team members ﬁ  rst drew on psychological studies 
indicating that among the ﬁ  ve domains of personality — openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and stability — liberals tend to score high on openness. 
  Fowler emphasized that this study is just the tip of the iceberg.  “We are only explaining one half of one percent of the variation in 
political ideology,” he said. “This is not the only gene that matters.”

In 2000, only two students from Miami 
Carol City Senior High School were ac-
cepted to UF. 
Ten years later, that number has risen 
to 22. 
The rise can be attributed to the help 
of the UF Alliance, an outreach organiza-tion that helps six struggling Florida high schools improve its educational standards 
and college acceptance rates.
The Alliance celebrated its 10th anni-
versary Monday evening with a reception 
at the Rion Ballroom in the Reitz Union.
The program engages parents and 
school personnel to do more to help stu-dents at these schools to prepare for col-lege.
“The Alliance program helps kids from 
high-poverty areas of our state raise their sights so they will work hard while they’re 
in high school so they get to come to the University of Florida or universities like 
the University of Florida,” said UF Presi-
dent Bernie Machen.
The six partnered schools, located in 
Duval, Miami-Dade and Orange counties, are largely minority schools, according to Diane Archer-Banks, interim director of the Alliance. 
“This is another way we can ensure that the student body of Florida represents the diversity of our state,” Machen said. 
The program was started as a response to race no longer being considered on col-lege applications, Archer-Banks said.
Stephen Backs, a world history teacher 
at Miami Carol City Senior High School, was one of the first teachers approached 
to help with the  program and to select 40 
freshman students to take part in the first 
UF Alliance campus tour. 
Before the Alliance came to the school, 
Backs said, there were only two or three 
students who were accepted into UF. 
Miguel Mejia, a 19-year-old elementary 
education major, said his journey to UF be-gan as one of the students selected for the freshmen campus visit in 2005.
 Mejia eventually graduated from Mi-
ami Senior High School and was accepted 
to UF.
“I didn’t even know what UF looked 
like, or what a college itself looked like,” 
he said.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
MARJAH, Afghanistan — In the 
first two months of a seven-month 
tour, U.S. Marine Cpl. Chuck Martin has been in 16 firefights.
He’s done laundry twice, mailed 
five letters and received two. He’s spent 378 hours on post and 256 hours on patrol. He’s crossed 140 miles (230 kilometers) of thorny bomb-laced farmland and waist-high trenches of water on foot.
Along the way , he’s ripped eight 
pairs of pants, ruined two pairs of boots, and downed 1,350 half-liter bottles of water. His platoon has killed at least eight militants in battle and nine farm animals in crossfire. The rugged outposts he’s lived in have been shot at 46 times.
“Tiring would be the best word 
to describe it,” the lanky 24-year-old native of Middletown, R.I., said, summarizing his time in the insurgent-plagued southern Afghan district of Marjah so far. “There’s no downtime. It’s a constant gruel.”
Martin’s list, stored on spread-
sheet on his laptop, offers a snapshot of American military life in this rural battlezone, where a new generation of young troops are growing up thousands of miles from home.
Since arriving in mid-July , troops 
from the 2nd Battalion, 9th Marines’ 
Echo Company have spread out 
across 13 small, spartan outposts in northern Marjah, a vast patch of fields and ancient hardened mud homes without running water or electricity that one company com-mander likened to “200 B.C.”
At one outpost called Inchon, a 
droning generator provides power for laptops loaded with movies and iPods, and just two lights — one for the Americans, the other for their Afghan counterparts. Troops have knitted together several shaky chairs from the metal fencing of discarded 
Hesco barriers.
At many bases, Marines sleep 
outside on cots inside hot-dog 
shaped mosquito nets. There are no toilets — just “wag” bags, no show-ers — just pouches you can fill up with water warmed by the afternoon sun. Fleas are such a problem, many Marines have taken to wearing flea 
collars made for cats or dogs around 
their wrists and belts.
“It’s definitely a culture shock,” 
Lance Cpl. Benjamin Long, 21, of Trussville, Ala. said of life for in-coming troops. “Some people come here and they think we’re living like cavemen.”
For Sgt. Jeffrey Benson of Me-
dina, Ohio, the hardest part is being away from his wife and two-year-
old son.
“Every time 
I call home, I feel like I’m 
missing something, missing another milestone,” said Benson, 34-year-old squad leader.
On the front, Benson said, his big-
gest fear is of making a decision that will lead to one of his Marines get-ting hurt. He said he worries about varying routes and patrol patterns to avoid insurgent attacks.
“I’m constantly double-checking 
things,” he said. “Marines want to get into gunfights. But it’s the small 
details — running into an ambush 
or running over an IED (bomb) — that I worry about most.”
The dangers of Marjah became 
apparent shortly after the Marines touched down. On one early patrol, six of them were wounded when guerrillas sprayed machine gunfire down a canal they were moving through.
The first time Benson led troops 
outside the wire, a Taliban fighter set off a fragmentation charge that blew up an Afghan soldier and wounded 
his radio operator. A few minutes 
ago, he was squatting in the same spot as his squad passed by.
Lance Cpl. Patrick Cassidy re-
members bullet rounds kicking up dust just six inches from his head during a morning firefight — after he had already hit the ground to take cover at the start of an ambush.
“Some days it sucks, but I can’t 
complain,” said the 23-year-old na-tive of Stroudsburg, Penn., after lug-ging around a mortar tube for hours on a patrol that thankfully turned out quiet. “I signed up for it. I knew what I was getting into.”
At one patrol base, a dinnertime 
conversation turned to this: is it bet-
ter to be blown up or shot?
The two American Marine bat-
talions deployed in Marjah since 
this summer have lost 20 men so far, according to a Facebook page that tracks casualties.

and the other is a 39-yard catch-and-run.
Now, no one can really tell if you’re actually good. 
You certainly haven’t met expectations or been much of a 
threat at any point in the season, but some of that is due to 
the square-peg-in-a-round-hole offense you’re running.
Your friends and family are supportive, but no one can 
deny this isn’t going well. 
On top of all that, you have to talk to reporters three 
times a week about it, and now there’s a borderline quar -
terback controversy brewing because of that tight end, Jordan Reed.
How would you handle that? What would you say?Would you gush over Reed’s play against the Commo-
dores, even pointing out that Reed threw his touchdown without a warm-up pass?
Would you talk about how much you respect your line-
men for having to deal with those blitzes that, more often than not, end with someone in your face?
Would you support the three-quarterback system and 
talk about how sharing your position with two other play-ers is fine as long as you win? 
I wouldn’t, but these are all things Brantley has said in 
the past few days.
He doesn’t bristle at questions from the media, and he 
never throws anyone under the bus, even when they can’t catch, snap, block or call plays well.Sure, it’d be nice to see some of the fiery confidence 
that made Tim Tebow a fan favorite, but this is the way Brantley leads. And in a season held together by bubble gum and toothpicks, his attitude is invaluable.
“It would be different if some other things were going 
on that would be more manageable for what he is perfect at doing. His objective is to help Florida win,” UF coach Urban Meyer said. “That tells you the character of him and his family because I am sure he is just taking shots across the bow.”
Brantley deserves some of those shots for the way he’s 
played this season, but he also should be applauded for taking this in stride — in a way befitting a true role mod-el.
 CROWDER ACCUSED McCLAIN OF 
SPITTING IN HIS FACE SUNDAY.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
DAVIE — The Miami Dolphins are un-
willing to shrug off low expectorations.
Coach Tony Sparano said Monday he 
wants the NFL to investigate the Dolphins’ 
complaint that Baltimore Ravens fullback Le’Ron McClain spat in the face of line-
backer Channing Crowder.
McClain denied spitting intentionally, 
and Ravens coach John Harbaugh absolved 
his player of wrongdoing. But a video re-play from WFOR-TV in Miami appeared 
to confirm the incident, and Sparano said 
he verified it.
“I have enough evidence,” Sparano 
said. “It’s upsetting to me.”
Crowder didn’t talk to re-
porters Monday, one day after a disappointing 26-10 loss at Baltimore dropped the incon-sistent Dolphins to 4-4. Mc-
Clain conceded saliva flew, but only acci-dentally.
“He said stuff to me I didn’t want to 
hear. I said stuff he didn’t want to hear,” 
McClain said. 
“Spit came out of my mouth when I 
said something to the dude, and that was 
it. It wasn’t on purpose. I’m not that kind of player.”
The Dolphins weren’t buying that ex-
planation. 
Linebacker Karlos Dansby said Mc-
Clain, a Pro Bowl fullback, should be sus-
pended for the rest of the season.
“As a man, you spit in somebody’s face, you crossed the line,” Dansby said. “Where 
I’m from, that’ll get you killed, straight up. 
That’s around the world, period.”
Crowder is widely considered one of 
the league’s foremost trash-talkers, so it 
was no surprise to see him and McClain 
facemask to facemask trading taunts dur -
ing a timeout, with an official trying to 
separate them.
The video shows the conversation end-
ing when McClain rears his head back be-
fore thrusting it forward.“That’s just me talking,” McClain said. 
“You can’t see spit coming out of my mouth or anything.”
Crowder then waves his left hand in 
front of his face, as if trying to intercept 
the spittle, before the two players are sepa-
rated.
Harbaugh found McClain innocent.
“I talked to Le’Ron,” Harbaugh said. 
“I’ve seen the videotape of it. It didn’t happen. I don’t believe for one second it 
happened.”That’s for the league to decide, Sparano 
said.
“There are a lot of things that go on 
in this game from a trash-talking stand-
point,” Sparano said. 
“I’m standing there on the sideline 
yesterday, and I had a player talk trash to me from the other team, and I didn’t say one word to the guy. That being said, that’s part of the game. I get it. Whatever floats your boat. I don’t think it’s part of 
the game, but to some of them, that’s what 
gets them going.
“But this whole deal here about spit-
ting in somebody’s face — nowhere in this 
game do I see any place for that.”
After the game, Crowder was so upset 
he mixed up his historical figures, com-
plaining the officials who missed the spit had eyesight comparable to Stevie Wonder 
and Anne Frank. 
When reporters confused by the refer -
ence to Frank further queried Crowder, 
it became clear he meant Helen Keller in-
stead.
“Is that the blind girl?” Crowder said. 
“Helen Keller? I don’t know. ... I’m mad 
right now. I’m not as swift as I usually am.”
None of Crowder’s teammates saw the 
incident, either. Dansby quickly became aware of it and said his linebacking part-ner deserves credit for his restrained re-
sponse.
“He had to weigh his options,” Dansby 
said. 
“He asked me on the sideline, ‘Should 
I go whup him?’ I’m like, ‘Yeah, go whup him.’ Then I was like, ‘Man, I need you. If 
you do it, you’re going to hurt your team.’ So he had to pull back.”the national championship.
“We’re very disciplined,” SEC 
Freshman of the Year Taylor Tra-vis said. “It’s not a party and we need to stay focused. This is 
where we’ll take the next step 
past others teams.” 
While surprised at a possible 
snub of a No. 1 seed, captain McKenzie Barney said the Gators 
were appreciative of what they 
did get and just happy to play at home. 
“We’re very motivated,” she 
said. “We had a couple of goals this season and we’ve got two out of the way. This season is far from over.”
Burleigh echoed Barney’s 
sentiments: “I’m just happy to be at home,” she said. “We’ve been on the road for a couple of weeks now, and the SEC Tour -
nament is a really long haul, so 
being at home is really exciting. 
It’s always a good thing carry-ing momentum forward into the NCAA Tournament and certainly 
winning the SEC Tournament did 
that for us.”
The Gators, one of three SEC 
teams to qualify, will make their 14th appearance in the NCAA Tournament and will host a round for the first time since 2008.
South Carolina and Auburn 
were the only other SEC teams to qualify, something that disap-pointed Burleigh but didn’t sur -
prise her.
“It’s a really competitive field 
this year, and it was going to be tough for [the SEC] to get more than three (bids).”
The Bears will be a familiar foe 
for the Gators.
“Mercer is a team we play ev-
ery spring and we have a lot of respect for their program,” Bur -
leigh said. “They’re going to bat-tle. We know that. They’ve had a good season and did a good job to win their conference tourna-
ment.”TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 2010   ALLIGATOR, 13

The Gators brought in two five-star de-
fensive tackles in their 2010 recruiting class. 
One was named the defensive player of 
the game by Urban Meyer for his perfor -
mance Saturday. 
The other didn’t travel with the team to 
Vanderbilt. 
Sharrif Floyd, who has consistently 
drawn praise from defensive line coach Dan 
McCarney for his work ethic, was second on the team with five total tackles, including 2.5 
for a loss, against the Commodores in the 
most productive game of his short career. 
Meanwhile, Dominique Easley did not 
even make the team’s travel roster. 
“He’s still with the team, but he has got to 
do things we ask him to do to be involved,” Meyer said. 
Demps healthy: If Meyer is looking for 
an edge heading into Saturday’s matchup 
with South Carolina, he can hang his hat on 
Florida being as healthy as it has been since the beginning of the season. Meyer said running back Jeff Demps 
(foot), who saw limited playing time against Vanderbilt, will return to his usual role this week. 
“Demps will play,” Meyer said. “We’ll 
know more later in the week, but he had a good day (Sunday).”
Defensive tackle Jaye Howard is also ex-
pected to return this week. Meyer called his recovery progress “promising.”
Kicker Caleb Sturgis (back) is still out, 
and offensive lineman Matt Patchan (wrist) 
is going to see a specialist and likely won’t 
play again this season. 
McCray makes impact: Hybrid lineback-
er/defensive end Lerentee McCray made an impression on UF coaches and fans for 
perhaps the first time in his career during 
Saturday’s blowout win at Vanderbilt. 
The sophomore saw extended playing 
time in the lopsided victory and forced a 
fumble on running back Zac Stacy that led 
to a Terron Sanders scoop-and-score in the second quarter. 
Defensive coordinator Teryl Austin 
pointed to McCray as a young player that 
stood out to him immediately following the 
game, and Meyer said he hopes McCray can build on this effort and see a more signifi-cant role for the rest of the season. 
“I made a comment to our staff, ‘If you 
don’t capitalize on this great push by a young guy then you failed as a coach,’ so we have to capitalize on that,” Meyer said.
McCray, who battled back and ankle in-
juries early in his career, was used frequent-
ly in pass rush against the Commodores.

While some teams held view-
ing parties to celebrate their se-
lection to the NCAA Tournament, the No. 7 Gators did what they usually do on Mondays: practice.
Despite the NCAA Women’s 
Soccer Committee announcing the field of 64 yesterday after -
noon, Becky Burleigh’s squad went back to work. 
Fresh off the regular season 
and tournament Southeastern Conference Championships, Florida’s eyes now lay on the ul-
timate prize: a national champi-
onship.
The Gators, an automatic 
qualifier after winning their con-
ference tournament Sunday, were 
selected as a No. 2 seed and will host one of the East Regionals. 
Florida will challenge the 
Mercer Bears, the Atlantic Sun 
Champs and first-time NCAA 
qualifier, Friday 
night at 6. 
The Gators prac-
ticed on Monday, skipping the selec-tion show that aired 
on ESPNU. Florida only found its tournament fate after practice. 
The dedication and commit-
ment to the ultimate prize is one reason Florida is among a hand-ful of teams capable of winning Gators earn No. 2 
seed, host regionalThis season not gone the way you want-
ed?
Try being John Brantley.
No one has had a tougher go of it because 
of the Gators’ struggles — not even Urban Meyer’s esophagus or heart. Brantley has handled it in a fashion that dwarfs his play 
on the field.
Put yourself in his shoes: You grow up 45 
minutes from Gainesville, son of a UF quar -
terback and nephew of an all-time great Flor -
ida linebacker. You dreamed of following in their footsteps, a dream you made a reality 
by being one of the nation’s best high school quarterbacks.
Then, you sit behind Tim Tebow and have 
to deal with being The One After The Chosen One. 
You finally take the reins amidst lots of 
hype about your skill as a drop-back passer, only that’s not the offense you get to run.
And in your debut, your center thinks he’s 
playing “Monkey in the Middle” with the ref-eree (you’re the monkey) so you get off to a terri-ble start. Turns out, your 
team kind of sucks and 
in a four game stretch, you lose three times and throw five interceptions 
without a single touch-
down.
Through all this, the 
offense never changes 
to suit your strengths, you get pounded by 
linebackers because your teammates treat 
stopping blitzes like a Rubik’s Cube, and you have to split playing time with a freshman. 
Then, a tight end gets in on the act and 
throws a touchdown on his first career pass — on that play your team always used to run with the quarterback you had to watch from the bench.
Sure, you throw two touchdowns against 
Vanderbilt, but one is a lucky underthrow Brantley making most of tough situation

AUSTIN, Texas — Texas coach Mack 
Brown says he didn’t pull quarterback Gar -
rett Gilbert during his five interception game 
against Kansas State because he didn’t want to send a message that he was giving up an already wretched season.
Gilbert’s first two interceptions led to 10 
points by Kansas State, and his third killed a scoring drive near the end of the first half. His 
fourth, on the second play of the third quar -
ter, set up a touchdown that put the Wildcats 
ahead 31-0.
His fifth came on Texas’ next possession 
and the Longhorns (4-5, 2-4 Big 12) soon after had their fifth loss in six games.
Gilbert’s backup, freshman Case McCoy, 
the younger brother of former Longhorn Colt McCoy , hasn’t played since the first game of the season, a win over Rice.
Pulling Gilbert early against Kansas State 
would have devastated a quarterback with a lot of potential, Brown said Monday . And later in the game, Brown wanted Gilbert to 
finish a scoring drive in the 39-14 loss.
“We thought about taking Garrett out, 
and if you do, you’ve crushed him and you’re 
sending a message that we’re giving up, which is a bad message to a potentially great 
young quarterback,” Brown said.
Gilbert’s bad game was a big step back-
ward a week after he played well in a 30-22 
loss to Baylor. Against Kansas State, he tried 
to force several throws into tight coverage.
“I didn’t give my team a very good chance 
to win,” Gilbert said. “You just can’t do that.”
Gilbert has thrown just seven touchdowns 
against 14 interceptions and his spotty play has made him the target of frustrated Texas 
fans who watched Colt McCoy win 45 games from 2006-2009.
Gilbert was one of the highest-rated quar -
terback recruits when he signed with Texas in 2009 and was almost immediately handed the backup job as a freshman. He took over for an injured McCoy in the BCS championship game earlier this year and had five turnovers 
in a 37-21 loss to Alabama.
Gilbert’s best game as a starter this season 
was a 20-13 win over Nebraska (No. 8 BCS, 
No. 9 AP) in which he ran for 71 yards and 
two touchdowns. He completed just four 
passes but had no turnovers against the Corn-huskers.
Turnovers have plagued Gilbert all season 
and they tend to come in bunches. He had 
three against Texas Tech and four against 
Iowa State. The five interceptions against Kansas State tied a school record last accom-plished by Bret Stafford against Oklahoma in 1987.
“Garrett gives you the best chance to win 
out because of the experience he’s had. He’s shown the ability to win the game,” Brown said. “Case hasn’t played ... You’re in a little 
bit of a bind that you don’t want to send a 
message to your players that you’ve quit and that it’s all about next year. That’s not fair to your seniors and in my estimation not fair to your team. “
The Longhorns must win two of their final 
three games to avoid their first losing season since 1997. Their next game is Saturday night against Oklahoma State (No. 10 BCS, No. 12 
AP) (8-1, 4-1), which is still alive in the race for 
the Big 12 South.
Brown acknowledged McCoy should get 
more snaps in practice to help him prepare in case he’s needed.
“We have to look at Case. He is doing bet-
ter in practice,” Brown said.
“In the spring you always open up every 
position. Garrett has a chance to be a great player. We’ve seen that,” Brown said.
Gilbert said he feels comfortable in a Texas 
offense that has dramatically dropped off in 
scoring this season. The Longhorns are aver -
aging 22 points. Texas had averaged at least 
34 points every year since 1998.
“Obviously I feel like I can get the job 
done,” Gilbert said when asked if he would 
mind if McCoy got more snaps. “I still feel 
confident, but that’s up to the coaches to do what they think is best.”TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 15
Sure, Luck’s been 
good all season. But he’s played as well in the last four games as any quarterback in the 
nation, Cam excluded. He’s com-pleted 75 percent of his passes and recorded nine touchdowns 
against just two interceptions 
during that stretch. And Luck 
deserves love for his mobility, too. 
He’s gained more rushing yards than any quarterback in Stanford history.
Justin Blackmon did not need long to remind 
fans why he should be the ﬁ  rst receiver invited to New York since Larry Fitzgerald in 2003. Blackmon caught a 5-yard touchdown in the ﬁ  rst quarter, and he extended his streak to eight-straight games with 100-plus 
receiving yards in Oklahoma State’s 55-28 win against Baylor. Blackmon added another highlight-worthy play to his 2010 resume when he scored a 69-yard rushing touchdown 
on an end around to start the second half.
The Broncos used a no-huddle attack 
Saturday against Hawaii, making Boise State’s score-ﬁ  rst, ask-ques-tions-later offense even more explo-sive. Moore ﬁ  nished the ﬁ  rst half with 322 yards. And in the third quarter 
he connected with Austin Pettis and Titus Young 
for 43- and 83-yard touchdowns. Of course, Hawaii 
ranks 81st nationally in pass defense, but anything north of 500 yards is good enough for us.
Until further notice, the Heisman 
chase is kind of a one-horse race. But James continues to keep pace slightly behind Cam, gaining 121 yards and scoring three touchdowns as Oregon dominated Washington on Sat-
urday. Including the Ducks’ bowl game, James, who is averaging 166.4 yards per game, is on pace for about 2,000 yards this season.
The jury is still out, but if Cam did take 
$200 thousand, the Tigers would 
be paying about $6 thousand per touchdown — and that’s assuming he (a) doesn’t score again and (b) took the money. It’s still too early to predict if 
Cam goes the Reggie Bush route, but Kim Kardashian deﬁ  nitely took note of his latest performance: 341 total yards, 5 touchdowns, 16 minutes on the ﬁ  eld.

Junior college transfer Lanita Bartley will likely be UF’s starting point guard when 
the team begins its season against UCF on Saturday. 
� SHE IS A JUNIOR COLLEGE TRANS -
FER FROM SANTA FE.
By MATT WATTS
Alligator Writer
 
Questions surround coach Amanda But-
ler’s inexperienced squad entering the 2010-11 
season. But with the opener less than a week away one of the most glaring concerns seems to be answered. 
Two newcomers to the program in junior 
transfer Lanita Bartley and freshman Jaterra Bonds have been competing for the starting point guard slot. And on Monday, Butler named a winner.
“I will be surprised if we don’t end up start-
ing Lanita,” Butler said at her weekly press conference. “We’ve found [playing Bartley is] the best way for us to start ball games.”
Bartley is the first player named to a start-
ing rotation that likely won’t be finalized until 
tipoff on Saturday, when Florida plays host to 
UCF in the Preseason Women’s National Invi-tation Tournament.  
Butler said Bonds’ versatility allows her to 
play as a combo guard off the bench, subbing in at either point guard or shooting guard.  
“I’m really confident with either one of 
them because of the way they compete,” Butler said. “They’re going to do whatever it 
takes to win, and I think those are the type of 
people you want setting the tone for the rest 
of your team.”
Butler and her staff has emphasized the im-
portance of quality minutes from all positions throughout offseason practices, and her reluc-tance to name starters echoes that sentiment.
Florida will need strong play from the 
guards against UCF on Nov. 13, as UF will be up against a veteran team. Central Florida returns four senior guards from a squad that created a positive turnover ratio and averaged 9.8 steals per game last season.And the Gators are coming off a scrimmage 
with South Florida on Sunday in which Butler 
said the team struggled to hold on to the ball.
“We’re really aggressive and I like the way 
we’re attacking the basket, but we’ve got to 
value our possessions a little bit more,” Butler said. “I think if we do that, we have a chance to be very good sooner than maybe we thought 
that would happen.”
Ball handling and making smart decisions 
will be addressed in film sessions before the 
attention turns to game-planning for UCF, 
Butler said.  
Although the Knights’ projected starting 
lineup features five upperclassmen, Butler 
said some of the preparation is guesswork be-cause this will be the first action of the season for both teams. Thus, the Gators will focus on 
themselves in addition to game-planning for 
UCF.
“The best thing for our team is to be more 
concerned with Florida and 
how is Florida improving every day than to get too caught up in our opponent,” she said. 
In their practices and 
scrimmage sessions, the 
Gators are transitioning to an up-tempo style, which is something Butler wants to see carry over into competitive action. That run-the-floor, fast-break style begins by establishing a strong presence in the paint, meaning UF will need center Ebonie Crawford to contribute. 
Crawford, who suffered a concussion in 
practice two weeks ago, was held out of the 
scrimmage against USF as a precaution. But 
she practiced at full speed and should be ready to go Saturday. 
Freshman forward Deaundra Young has 
also been a full participant despite not com-pletely recovering from offseason surgery.
With so much uncertainty at each position, 
it’s possible both could see time in the post against UCF.Butler leaning toward
