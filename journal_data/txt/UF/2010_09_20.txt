KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — Urban 
Meyer thought he found Florida’s 
identity last week.
With an experienced offensive 
line and a new quarterback, the 
Gators were going to thrive on 
the ground. Dominate the line of 
scrimmage. Pound defenses.
No. 9 Florida stayed true to 
that strategy in its 31-17 win Sat-urday at Tennessee. But while 
they were pleased with the end 
result, the Gators did not confirm Meyer’s previous hunch, leaving fans wondering if the offense is 
good enough to win the South-
eastern Conference.
Florida (3-0, 1-0 SEC) carried 
the ball 49 times, 12 more than its previous season high. But the 
team only managed 150 yards, 
3.1 per attempt.
“That’s not good enough,” 
Meyer said. “This offense, minus 
[former quarterback Tim Tebow], 
you’ve got to find ways to run the ball because we’re going to be a physical team. I was not overly 
pleased with the way we ran the 
ball in this game.”
Florida continued to plan the 
offense around running back 
Jeff Demps, giving the junior a 
career-high 26 carries. But he couldn’t match the 139 yards (on 11 carries) he reeled off last week, as Tennessee held him to just 73 
yards.
Limping on his right leg af-
ter the game, 
Demps said he could tell a dif-
ference between Saturday’s con-test and those of the previ-
ous two weeks, 
when Florida 
faced less-respected programs in Miami (Ohio) and South Florida.
For the third game in a row, 
the Gators fell behind early. 
Facing a 3rd and 1 on their 
second drive, running backs Em-manuel Moody and Mike Gillislee 
were stuffed at the line on back-
to-back carries, and the turnover on downs led to a Tennessee field goal.
Florida responded with a 42-
yard touchdown drive, highlight-ed by quarterback John Brantley’s 37 passing yards. But Tennessee (1-2, 0-1 SEC) silenced Florida 
until halftime, holding the Gators 
to just 94 yards of offense.
“That’s kind of who we are 
right now,” Meyer said. “I was very disappointed in the first 
half.”
Florida’s offense was much 
improved after the break, scor -
ing on its first three possessions and taking a 24-10 lead. But the 
team looked one-dimensional at times. In his first career road start, Brantley was held to just 167 yards passing.
Billed as a pocket passer, 
Brantley has yet to throw for more than 200 yards in a game this season. Part of that, he said, 
was because of the team’s game 
plan, which called for more than twice as many running plays as passing plays.
“We trust our offensive line,” 
Brantley said. “I love those guys. We trust Jeff Demps and all the UF offense still a mystery

Say goodbye to Paynes Prairie’s roaming 
herds.
Most of the American bison, Spanish 
cracker horses and shrub cattle that roam 
Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park will be 
removed by Dec. 31, according to an inter -
nal e-mail sent out June 9 by David Jowers, 
manager of Paynes Prairie. 
Jowers has been planning to cut back the 
bison herd since 2008. 
In a memo sent to Donald Forgione, di-
rector of Florida Park Service, on Sept. 23, 2008, Jowers said the bison herd should be decreased because the herd has grown too 
large over the years and could be a security hazard. 
“Paynes Prairie Preserve’s boundary has 
much denser human and domestic animal 
populations,” Jowers said in the memo, “increasing the likelihood of escape onto surrounding roads and properties, creating risk of injuries.”

About 30 people spent their Saturday 
morning in class.
Former Gainesville Mayor Pegeen 
Hanrahan was one of three speakers at 
the event.
The speakers talked to students about 
how to improve communication skills in 
the political arena at a workshop hosted 
by the Bob Graham Center for Public Service. 
“We’re trying to promote civil dia-
logue about today’s issues,” said Brit-tany Fox, president of the Bob Graham Center Public Service Council. “We’re teaching a new generation of leaders to speak up about what they believe and 
listen to other points of view.”
She said that the conference wasn’t 
just for students who want to be in-
volved in politics. 
“It’s applicable to anyone,” she said. 
“You’re always going to encounter peo-
ple in life that disagree with you.”
Hanrahan spoke about media rela-
tions and discussed the importance of 
returning phone calls and establishing good relationships with reporters. 
Bruce Barcelo, a political adviser, 
spoke about the political division and the importance of overcoming the polar -
ization of today’s political landscape. 
“We’re seeing politics as theater, 
brought to us 24-7,” he said.
He also discussed the role of televi-
sion and visual imagery in influencing 
how voters think. 
“If I’m going to change the air you 
breathe, I’m going to change the pictures 
in your head,” he said.
After lunch, Naniette Coleman, a 
World Bank consultant, gave a presen-
tation featuring interactive exercises 
that stressed the importance of working across party lines in political settings.
Jeff Rood, a member of the public ser -
vice council, said he came out because 
he attends almost all the Graham Center 
events. 
“Seeing role models, like the former 
mayor, inspires me and makes my future 
goals more attainable,” he said. “I’m con-
stantly surprised how helpful, humble and approachable the prestigious and experienced guests are.”

public service council memberabout 40 bison to about eight female 
bison, which means the smaller herd won’t be able to reproduce. The horse herd will be cut back similarly. The e-mail did not say how many of the 
cattle would be removed from the 
roughly 40 that graze at Hickory Ranch, the park’s cattle ranch.
The bison and horses would be 
given to people who submitted re-quests for the animals by June 30. According to the internal e-mail, the preservation would provide “all labor, equipment and material 
to remove 45 American bison alive 
(including all males).” People with approved requests would be able to catch and keep the park’s bison and horses. The e-mail did not say if the preserve would sell or give away the animals.
The bison and horses currently 
roam on more than 21,000 acres of 
land owned by the preserve.
The remaining bison, horses and 
cattle will be confined to a smaller 
area south of the park’s visitor center observation tower so guests will have a better view of the animals, accord-ing to the internal e-mail.
“When you look outside and 
you look over the fence, they aren’t there,” Forgione said.
He said that another reason the 
park is removing most of the live-
stock is to stop inbreeding. 
Forgione said the Florida Park 
Service believes this is the best course 
of action after consulting with UF ge-neticists and the National Bison As-sociation, a non-profit organization that matches bison sellers to meat buyers.
Jim Matheson, assistant director of 
the National Bison Association, said he did not know if the Florida Park Service was selling any bison through the association. The Florida Park Ser -
vice was not registered to sell the ani-mals at the association’s annual bison auction.
In the 2008 memo to Forgione, 
Jowers mentioned the possibility of 
letting the bison herd die out.
“By eliminating the reproduction 
of the herd we can more easily choose 
to maintain, expand or let the herd go extinct,” the memo stated.4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 2010

UF alumni Cameron MacMillan 
and Joey Sasvari plan to transform 
charity work, one iPhone at a time. 
Their company, New Charity Era, 
brings together charity and social gam-ing. The company’s first product, an iPhone application entitled “Raise the Village,” will be available at the end of 
October or early November. 
The application combines the struc-
ture of “FarmVille” with the business 
model of Toms shoes, a company that donates a pair of shoes to under -
privileged children for every pair pur -
chased.
“‘FarmVille’ is a popular game, and 
they make tons and tons of revenue 
through the purchase of virtual items,” 
Sasvari said. “In this game, you have a full village that you have to take care of, and all the items that you buy for your villagers in the game, we buy in real life.”Users can purchase a variety of ne-
cessities, including food, water, cloth-ing and medical supplies. The virtual purchases will be donated to the 1,400 people living in Kapir Atiira, Uganda. 
After the supplies are distributed, 
users will be able to see photos of the delivery that will show the impact of their donations. 
“People are sick of donating mon-
ey and not seeing where it goes,” MacMillan said. “We want [the 
game] to be a portal for people to give. We want people to feel like they trav-eled to Africa and handed these gifts off themselves.”
The pair found the village with the 
help of Diko Evarist, a fellow UF alum-nus and Uganda resident, who will oversee the deliveries. 
In March, MacMillan and Sasvari 
traveled to Uganda where their idea to reform charity became a reality.

More than 500 students got their hands 
dirty Saturday during Gator Plunge, a stu-
dent-organized community service event that took place all over Gainesville.
Students and members of various stu-
dent organizations, including Catholic Gators, First-Year Florida and Theta Alpha Christian sorority, worked throughout Gainesville, weeding flower beds, picking up trash and sorting through thrift store inventories at local schools, churches and non-profit businesses.
Volunteers gathered on the Plaza of 
Americas at 8 a.m. and were put into 
groups according to where they would be 
helping out for the day.
Gator Plunge is an event to give UF stu-
dents the opportunity to volunteer with a community service project, said Lauren Taylor, director of Actions service orga-nization within the Center for Leadership and Service. 
“The purpose is to get as many students 
as possible involved in service projects,” Taylor said.  “Hopefully it serves as a cat-alyst in getting them involved in service projects on their own.”
For James Occiano, a fourth-year soci-
ology major, service projects are a chance to see Gainesville.    
According to Occiano, he’s done a ser -
vice project every year since he’s been in Gainesville.
“I like to be aware of what’s available 
in the area,” Occiano said.  “I don’t get a chance to see volunteer opportunities 
when I’m stuck on campus.”   
Latrice Bouie, a peer mentor with the 
Office of Academic Support at UF, volun-
teered with Habitat for Humanity for the day.
Bouie said that students wishing to vol-
unteer at Gator Plunge should be open to doing whatever is needed at whatever lo-cation they are assigned.
“It’s best for the community and it’s a 
personal benefit,” Bouie said.Students get dirty for cause

PAYNES , from page 1THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico — 
The largest newspaper in Ciudad 
Juarez asked the border city’s war -
ring drug cartels Sunday for a truce after the killing last week of its 
second journalist in less than two 
years.
In a front-page editorial, El Dia-
rio de Juarez asked the cartels what they want from the newspaper so it can continue its work without fur -
ther death, injury or intimidation of its staff.
“Leaders of the different orga-
nizations that are fighting for con-trol of Ciudad Juarez: The loss of two reporters from this publishing house in less than two years rep-resents an irreparable breakdown for all of us who work here, and, in particular, for their families,” the editorial said.
“We ask you to explain what 
you want from us, what we should try to publish or not publish, so we know what to expect.”
It was the newspaper’s second 
f r o n t - p a g e editorial since gunmen at-tacked two El 
Diario photographers Thursday — 
one a new employee and the other 
an intern. One died and the other was seriously wounded as they left 
for lunch in Mexico’s most danger -
ous city.
In 2008, a crime reporter for El 
Diario was slain outside his home 
as he was about to take his daugh-ters to school.
The editorial Sunday said drug 
gangs in the city across from El Paso, Texas, are the de facto au-thorities, and criticized both the Chihuahua state government and President Felipe Calderon for their 
lack of protection for journalists.
“We don’t want to continue to be 
used as cannon fodder in this war because we’re tired,” Diario’s edi-
tor, Pedro Torres, told The Associ-ated Press.
He said the staff felt great rage, 
helplessness and despair after burying new employee Luis Carlos 
Santiago, 21, on Saturday.
“Burying the body does not bury 
the impunity or pain,” Torres said. 
“There is a feeling of great anxiety and impotence surrounding this situation.”
Mexican journalists are increas-
ingly under siege from drug cartels seeking to control the flow of infor -
mation, and many media outlets, especially in border areas, have stopped covering the drug war. Un-til Sunday, El Diario was not one of them.In a front-page editorial Friday, 
El Diario said journalists have no-where to turn for protection be-cause of the inability of Mexican security forces to solve most attacks on the media.
The Committee to Protect Jour -
nalists, a New York-based watch-dog group, said in a recent report that at least 22 Mexican journalists have been killed since December 2006, when Calderon intensified a crackdown on drug cartels by de-ploying tens of thousands of troops and federal police across the coun-
try.

has killed nearly 5,000 people in

� INDEPENDENTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 
RUNNING THEIR OWN CAMPAIGNS.
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Staff Writer
Twenty-four of the 88 candidates running for a Student 
Senate seat in the Sept. 28-29 Student Government elections 
are campaigning independent of party affiliation.
Neil Gundavda, an independent student senator and 
leader of the Independent Coalition of Students, said many of the independent candidates chose to run against the exist-ing parties because they want to be able to move forward with their own ideas for their constituency, rather than being 
responsible to a party.
“If you give the candidate a lot more leeway, it’s a better 
election strategy,” Gundavda said.
Supervisor of Elections Amanda Griffin said, as of Fri-
day afternoon, the Unite Party has 50 candidates running for 
Senate seats and the Progress Party has 14.
Student Alliance party spokesman Yevgen Sautin said his 
party will not be participating in this election cycle. 
Gundavda said each independent candidate will be re-
sponsible for raising their own campaign funds, producing 
campaign materials such as fliers and T-shirts and promot-
ing their individual platforms.
He said all the independent candidates agreed upon

U.S. loses when parties play games
George Washington tried to warn us about the evils 
of political parties in America during his farewell address 214 years ago. However, since this is Amer -
ica, no one listened.
Now we are at a point where the sectionalism caused by 
these factions is hurting our great country. It reared its ugly head again when a couple of Republicans spoke at a rally 
about effectively shutting down parts of the government 
because of theoretical budget issues if Republicans gain a majority in the House after the midterm election.
What they were talking about is the possibility of a 
Republican-controlled House not allocating funds for pro-
grams like Obamacare and other projects they disagree 
with. Of course, Obama would veto the legislation, creating a legislative stalemate.
And as we all know, because this is America, nothing 
can function without money.
The idea that a possible quarrel between two sects of one 
government could mean things like Veterans Administra-tion hospitals and national parks shutting down is atro-cious.
And the blame falls on both parties when both are guilty 
of igniting pointless feuds. Remember, it would be Obama’s almighty pen striking the veto if this were to occur.
As those Republican representatives point out, techni-
cally only the president can shut down the government.
It seems like neither party can agree on any issue recent-
ly, whether it’s a Supreme Court justice nomination or the Small Business Jobs Act.
Things that need to get done don’t get done because of 
division caused by political parties in our country. Even when things eventually do get passed, like the Small Busi-ness Jobs Act, which is expected to go through the House after barely passing in the Senate, it gets done months after it is needed because of the gridlock.
The worst thing about it is the 
way it divides our country.
The rift even divides the media, 
with MSNBC for liberals and Fox for 
conservatives.
Sometimes the best ideas come 
when people with different beliefs come together to form 
one solution. But more often than not, our elected men and women in Washington choose to stay separate and avoid 
the tawdry task of listening to one another. We saw this 
happen with the health care legislation when neither side would listen to the ideas of the other.
Instead of working together for the common good, these 
individuals who represent our country are fighting like children over a toy.
While we will most likely never rid our crippled govern-
ment of political parties, that doesn’t mean we can’t have the parties and still solve this issue.
There are quite a few politicians who are occasionally 
willing to sit down with members of the other faction to solve our problems, and their example should be followed. Maybe one day red and blue will be able to work together 
on every issue to do what is really best for America and in 
a timely manner.
That would be some change I could believe in.But for now, this is America, where our leaders put 
the good of the country in the backseat to win their little 
games.
Chris Dodson is a first-year journalism and finance major. 
His column appears every Monday.Stoned and released
Iranian President Mah-
moud Ahmadinejad thinks we’re just as good 
as The Onion.
Which is great if you saw 
the keepers of modern satire last week on campus, but not so great if you want the truth.
The not-so-warmly-wel-
comed Iranian president said Sunday that media out-lets “made up” news about an Iranian woman who was 
to be stoned to death after 
being convicted for adul-tery.
Although we wouldn’t 
go so far as to say the news was conjured up in a news-room somewhere by editors who have nothing better to do than piss off a coun-
try that may or may not be 
storing massive amounts of uranium, we’re glad to see Ahmadinejad label the apparently-never-happened public stoning concept as an “ancient method that needs to change.”
We’re glad in the year 
2010 some governments are finally speaking out against public stoning.
There’s never a bad time 
to publicly denounce death by stoning, especially when you’ve flown to New York City like Ahmadinejad did 
this weekend for a United 
Nations conference.
And we’re also glad to 
see Iran has made a “huge humanitarian gesture” by releasing one of the three al-leged spies who have been detained for more than a year in connection with es-
pionage charges.
Maybe now Iran will re-
lease the other two prison-
ers convicted as spies.
And if not, we’re sure the 
U.S. government has a few sanctions left up its sleeve it can use to force Iran’s hand behind its back.Goofy governor
Crist calls expense 
report a “sham”
The happiest place on Earth just got a little sour for our 
sun-kissed sweetheart in the governor’s mansion.
Gov . Charlie Crist accused the Republican Party of 
Florida of producing a “sham” report Saturday that suggested he spent thousands of party-donor dollars at Disney World during a personal vacation.
Crist denies the report, but imagine how adorable he would 
look with a felt Mickey Mouse hat with a nice, cursive, Florida-funded “Charlie” stitched on the front.
And a chocolate-coated Mickey Mouse tastes even sweeter 
when you aren’t the one paying for the ice cream running down your chin.
To bolster his claims, Crist released a counter report stating 
his wife paid nearly $5,000 for the very same summer 2009 va-
cation to Goofy’s backyard.
But an independent consulting firm released its report, say-
ing ousted Florida Republican Party Chairman Jim Greer, a 
close pal of Crist, charged more than $13,000 to the party ac-count for a four-day vacation with the Crist family.
Most importantly, we don’t understand how Greer or Crist 
could spend this much money , Florida-funded or not, at Disney World.
Didn’t either one of them have a Florida two-day pass?Interestingly, the report Crist released leaves out some minor 
expense details, such as park tickets. Perhaps that can explain why Greer’s bill was a little higher than the one Crist released.
Who needs a two-day pass when voters are paying your 
bill?
Bad news, Charlie. We hear Mickey Mouse votes Democrat.

With the November elec-
tions rapidly approach-ing, it is becoming clear 
the Republican Party’s focus during the 2010 campaign season seems to be government spending, jobs and the repeal of health care reform. While government spending and job creation are familiar territory for the GOP, health care issues are proving to be choppy political waters for the party to navigate.
Since President Obama signed 
the bill in March, there was a move-ment throughout the Republican Party to repeal the health care re-form bill dubbed “Obamacare.” The party stood together in opposition of the bill and was quick to find vague wording members could manipulate 
to their advantage for talking points 
and commercials. It all appeared to 
be going so well for the Republicans — that is, until the benefits of the new bill proved to be just what some 
states needed.
Common sense would dictate if 
someone is running on a platform 
against health care, it is not a good idea to also put a hand out to receive 
the benefits. Common sense aside, if 
Obamacare is really unconstitution-
al because it threatens state and in-dividual rights, then why are seven of the states involved in the lawsuit taking advantage of this allegedly unconstitutional bill?
Health care opposition states Ar -izona, Idaho, Indiana, Loui-siana, Michi-gan, Nebraska 
and Nevada have recently had their requests approved to get subsidies for covering retired state govern-ment employees with health insur -
ance before they can get Medicare. 
Regardless of constitutional in-
terpretation of the health care re-form, the outward campaigning of these GOP members against the bill and their private filing for benefits is hypocrisy best exemplified. I agree these states should take every ad-vantage of the health care bill. Bills of this magnitude are supposed to be passed with the sole intention of benefiting the American people. 
To those in the GOP who feel it’s 
OK to call Obamacare “evil,” refer -
ence death panels and employ scare 
tactics to keep conservative voters confused and against a bill that most 
will stand to benefit from, I applaud 
your conviction and political pos-
turing.
But to those who sign up for the 
bill’s benefits while opposing the bill 
for political gain, I say good luck in 
your upcoming election season. You 
can’t have it both ways, and once the light is shed on your dirty little secrets, it will be interesting to see how many voters stand behind you.

UWire IN 2009, 32.3 PERCENT OF THE 
COUNTY WAS IMPOVERISHED.
By JOLIE SHAPIRO
Alligator Contributing Writer
Newly released statistics show one out of 
seven Americans are now living below the poverty line, and the poverty rate in Alachua County and Florida are even higher than the national average.
The newest statistics, for 2009, show the 
U.S. had a record 14.3 percent poverty rate, and Alachua County was far ahead with 32.3 percent living below the poverty line. 
UF economics professor Kenny Lawrence 
said part of the reason for Alachua’s high rate is because there is no adjustment of the pov-erty line to account for cost of living. 
For 2009, the federal poverty line was 
$10,830 for an individual and $22,050 for a family of four. 
Lawrence said it’s the same in Gainesville as in New York City , which  makes southern 
states or states with low costs of living appear 
to have a higher poverty rate.
He also said it’s high because there aren’t 
any high-paying major corporations in the Alachua County area. 
“The only resources of major income 
Gainesville has are the University of Florida, 
Nationwide and the hospital complex,” Law-
rence said.
The county’s high poverty rate is creating 
new challenges for local charity organiza-tions.
“The economy’s bad so we don’t have 
enough money to build houses and there aren’t enough people to purchase a house 
from us,” said Jan Luc, a volunteer for Habitat 
for Humanity . 
The St. Francis House, the only year-round 
operational shelter in the tri-county area, is also feeling the effects. 
“Since the economy fell, the number of 
people seeking assistance has increased by 50 
percent, the majority from Alachua County , primarily from a loss of total income,” said 
Kent Vann, the executive director of St. Fran-
cis. “Lately our organization has been strained 
by an excessive amount of people looking for 
shelter and food. We have to turn away people every day from the shelter.”
The shelter’s main priorities are families 
and children, like Bryon Smith and his two 
sons, Isaac, 13, and Ernest, 12. 
“The school bus picks them up right out-
side of the shelter,” Smith 
said. “It’s not the best situ-
ation, but at least we’re all 
together.”
Despite the strain, St. Francis still maintains 
a program to find jobs and shelters for the 
homeless, while feeding them with donated 
food. 
“We get cans and Chef Michael Roblez 
works his magic,” said Alan Boles, a 57 year-old Macy’s part-time employee and St. Francis 
resident. 
Even the administrators of the shelter have 
experienced problems in the rough economy . Gerry Martello was laid off due to budget cuts for a year and a half before she returned to St. 
Francis as a case manager. 
“I practice what I preach. I always tell the 
clients I kept my house because I saved,” Mar -
tello said. “Our goal is to help them become 
self-sufficient.”    
The residents are grateful for one of the 35 
beds in the shelter.
“I’m glad I’m here. In here is better than out 
there,” said Leslie Mears, a 52 year-old recep-tionist for American Director’s Group.    
“Out there” refers to the eastern side of 
Gainesville, the deep woods, and a place com-
monly referred to by Gainesville residents as “tent city.”
Kenny Bess, a St. Francis House resident, 
has almost completed the work program, and 
on Oct. 3, he will be moving into an apartment 
on the east side of Gainesville. 
he’s moving out, but he’s still worried. 
“Right now people are just one paycheck 
away from where we’re at. In this economy it 
doesn’t take much.”8, ALLIGATOR  MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 2010
About 40 vendors set up booths on the downtown plaza’s sidewalks
Gainesville’s Hispanic commu-
nity.
“It’s the only festival of its 
kind that I know of in northern Florida,” said David Ruiz, the 
event’s director.
Ruiz explained that the fes-
tival always occurs during His-panic Heritage Month, which 
runs from Sept. 15 until Oct. 15. 
He said the event is a way to 
showcase Gainesville’s Hispanic community.
“You don’t have to be Latino 
to enjoy yourself here,” he said. “We welcome everyone.”
Ruiz stressed that the festival 
seeks to display the diversity of cultures represented in the Latino community.
Each differnent Hispanic 
country’s society brings its own unique flavor to the community, he said.
UF’s Hispanic Student Associ-
ation welcomed the crowd at the front of the plaza and offered face 
painting to children. 
Inside the plaza, about 40 ven-
dors set up booths on the side-
walks. 
Local restaurants sold tama-
les, churros, guava pastries and other Hispanic delicacies. Mer -
chants displayed colorful jewelry and trinkets.
Nonprofit and community 
groups handed out information-
al fliers. The Regional Minority 
AIDS program under the Alach-ua County Department of Health administered free HIV tests. Re-
sults were provided in as little 20 
minutes.
A cross section of residents 
joined in the festivities. 
Children, students and adults 
of all backgrounds picnicked on the lawn of the Bo Diddley plaza and browsed the vendors’ offer -
ings.
 “The food, the music and the 
culture are all so authentic,” said Humberto Barboza, a junior in-dustrial and systems engineering major.Originally from Venezuela, 
Barboza said the festival remind-
ed him of home.  
“This is what I’ve been miss-
ing,” he said, holding a freshly 
made empanada.
Nilsa Ramos danced on the 
plaza’s lawn. 
A charm of the Puerto Rican 
flag hung from her neck and jin-gled as she turned in circles and 
swayed to the music.
Ramos has attended the festi-
val every year since she moved to 
Gainesville from North Carolina 
in 2004. 
She said the crowd grows each 
year, but the culture of the event 
remains the same.
“I wish we could get together 
like this not only once a year,” she said. “It’s nice for the community to come together as one.”LATINO , from page 1

TEEING OFF WITH TYLER JETT alligatorSports.org UF FOOTBALL THE CALL LED TO A GA -
TORS TOUCHDOWN.
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Staff Writer
achiang@alligator.org
 
KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — With 
momentum on Tennessee’s side 
in the third quarter, one play 
swung it the other way.
After the Volunteers scored 
a touchdown to tie the game 
at 10, their defense stood up to 
the test and forced the Florida offense into a fourth down. But the effort wasn’t enough to take the ball back.
Instead, UF coach Urban 
Meyer decided it was time to take a chance and called a fake punt.
Thirty-six yards later, wide 
receiver Omarius Hines proved Meyer right.
Hines took the snap and used 
his 6-foot, 219-pound frame to 
rumble all the way to Tennes-
see’s 25-yard line and give his offense a new set of downs.
“He looked better than a full-
back,” Meyer said. “We have been working on that since the beginning of the year, and we try to just get numbers and we had numbers. They executed 
well.”
Meyer called the play after a coach in the booth noticed a 
tendency in UT’s punt return 
formation. The Gators had an 
advantage with three blockers to the Vols’ two defenders on the left side of the line. 
Jon Bostic, Terron Sand-
ers and Omar Hunter were the three UF blockers who helped open the hole for the big run.
Hines didn’t flinch when he 
heard the play call.
“We’ve been practicing on it 
every day in practice, and that was my chance to get the first down,” he said. “That’s all I wanted to do — get the first 
down.”
Meyer has attempted eight 
fake punts in his time at UF, 
and all of them have resulted in 
a first down.
But this one — the longest 
of Meyer’s tenure — was one 
of the most important because Trick play swings game in Florida’s direction
Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
UF wide receiver Omarius Hines recorded two catches Saturday, and he gained 36 yards when the Gators 
ran a fake punt in the third quarter.
Here’s all you need to know about 
Tennessee: The Vols ran a flea-flicker to throw the ball to a tight 
end on an out route.
Every 9-year-old with two friends and 
a Nerf ball knows you don’t break out that trick unless you’re taking a shot at a big 
play, and the moment will be my lasting 
memory of UT’s likely awfulness this sea-son.
But while I left Knoxville convinced 
2010 will be a long season for new coach Derek Dooley and the Vols, I was also im-
pressed with the framework surrounding 
them.
Few football schools have as much to 
offer as Tennessee. 
Neyland Stadium, with its 100,000-plus 
seats and riverfront location, is one of the best in the nation.As a city, Knoxville has more going for 
it than most SEC towns, and the Vols are the biggest program in their state, bring-
ing along a huge fan base and what should 
be an easy sell to in-state recruits. 
And UT has the well-known traditions 
— ‘’Rocky Top,’’ the checkerboard end 
zones, players running through the T be-
fore games — to keep it relevant on a na-tional stage.
All these things, along with recent reno-
vations to the facilities, make Tennessee a powerhouse-in-waiting.
And there’s the problem. UT is dor -
mant.
With a law degree and famous SEC last 
name, Dooley’s an intriguing guy, and 
maybe he’ll restore the Vols to their right-
ful place as perennial contenders.
But it’s baffling to think the keys to this souped-up sports car were handed to a guy whose only head-
coaching experience 
is a 17-20 record at Louisiana Tech.
A large reason 
why that happened is 2009 coach Lane Kiffin’s hasty depar -
ture for USC, which former UT coach Phil 
Fulmer blasted on the CBS show “College 
Football Today” this weekend.
“[Kiffin] left Tennessee with basically 
his hat in his hand and a bunch of NCAA 
compliance questions,” Fulmer said. 
“Many in our community are glad that he 
is gone. He never really embraced the tra-ditions, the values of the program or the community for that matter. And often his arrogant attitude turned people off.”
But before that happened, Kiffin re-
energized a fan base that had been slump-ing. 
He didn’t leave the cupboard stocked 
with talent, but he did put the Vols back 
on the map with all his trash talk and self-
promotion.
Whether Dooley can capitalize on that 
remains to be seen, but how did he — and even Kiffin, whose only experience as top man was going 5-15 with the Oakland 
Raiders — end up on Rocky Top?
Tennessee is better than botched flea-
flickers, experimental coaches and punch 
lines. 
And if the Vols ever get the ship right-
ed, Florida will have a tougher road, and a rival, again.Tennessee’s program struggling despite having so much to offer

WITH AN SEC-LEADING 272 RUSH-ING YARDS.
By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmccall@alligator.org
 
KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — When asked this 
week about how he planned to stop the South-
eastern Conference’s leading rusher, Florida coach Urban Meyer made his strategy clear.
“We’re going to have some big people on 
the field,” he said.
The plan worked.The Gators leaned on a five-man defen-
sive line to stymie Tennessee tailback Tauren Poole, holding him to 23 yards on 10 carries in a 31-17 win. 
Entering Saturday , Poole led the SEC 
with 272 yards and three touchdowns in two 
games.“We knew he was an outstanding back and 
really the focal point of their offense,” UF de-fensive coordinator Teryl Austin said. 
“This week, we made a conscious effort to 
be really gap sound, do a great job running to 
the ball, corralling him and tackling him. Our guys did a great job.”
In a rivalry where the team with more 
rushing yards has won the last eight contests (UF ran for 150), stopping the ground game was the top focus. The results were as good as 
Florida could have hoped for.
Not counting the Gators’ six sacks for 34 
yards, they held the Vols to 63 yards on 17 car -
ries. Of the 15 combined rushes between tail-
backs Poole and David Oku, nine went for less than four yards.
“We definitely went into this game know-
ing they had some great running backs and a big offensive line, and we had to really pride 
ourselves in stopping that run,” defensive end 
Justin Trattou said. “We went out and played our gaps really hard, and we were success-ful.”
Austin’s scheme to stop Poole revolved 
around using three defensive tackles and two ends. 
Defensive end Duke Lemmens and his 
backup, freshman Ronald Powell, played from a standing position alongside the four down linemen and often dropped into pass coverage.
Lemmens led the group with five tackles, 
and he and Powell notched a sack each.
“We definitely wanted to get 
our biggest guys in there,” Trat-tou said. “Duke and Powell are right in between, that hybrid position. They both played real 
well today , and I think that package is going to 
end up being successful for us.”
Hammond, Hill make impact in return:

Hill, two players suspended for the first two games, made their presence felt against Ten-nessee.
Hammond snagged a seven-yard touch-
down in the third quarter, and Hill bounced back from his blown coverage on a fourth-quarter Tennessee touchdown by forcing a fumble.
Hammond said the catch made him feel 
like he’d fully returned from the absence that began with his DUI arrest this summer.
“It makes you forget about it because with 
football you don’t really think about it.,” he said. “You’re out there, and you just get away and play ball.”
“I’m not going to say it didn’t happen or 
that nobody is ever going to come up to me again and ask about it, but I made a mistake.”
There’s more mystery surrounding Hill’s 
suspension, and he did little to clear it up after 
the game.
“I just wasn’t ready (to play),” said Hill, 
who denied his suspension was due to a failed 
drug test. “[Urban] didn’t think I was ready to play, so he sat me out.”14, ALLIGATOR  MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 2010

running backs. We’re just sticking with 
our game plan and just doing what we’re good at.”
  Unlike its ﬁ  rst two games of the season, 
the Florida offense didn’t have any big of-fensive plays to boost its stats. Demps — who broke runs of 72 and 62 yards against 
Miami and USF — had a long of 18 yards, 
and the deepest pass went for 24.  The team’s longest play from scrim-
mage came on a third-quarter fake punt, 
when receiver Omarius Hines rushed for 
36 yards to set up a go-ahead touchdown.  Hines said the offense needs more ex-
plosive plays, and he notices differences 
between how the unit looks in practice and 
in games, a factor of the team’s youth.
  “I don’t see anything missing,” he said. 
“I really just don’t know. We just got to keep practicing, chipping (away). Eventu-
ally, we’ll get it.” 
  For now, though, the team will have to 
be content with grinding out wins. Meyer 
said last week he wants Brantley to throw for more than 200 yards each game, and he admitted the offense is still a work in 
progress.
  But, regardless of their offensive statis-
tics, the Gators are scoring about 34 points 
a game and remain unbeaten.
  “Are we good enough to win at Ney-
land Stadium? That’s all I’m worried about,” Meyer said. “Can we beat Ken-tucky at home? I don’t know yet. Flip the coin, man.” FOOTBALL , from page 1UF VOLLEYBALL

 There should be little doubt as to 
who is currently the best volleyball 
team in the Southeastern Confer-
ence.
Prior to the season, SEC coaches 
picked Tennessee to win the confer-ence over Florida.
But UF had something to say about 
that Sunday.
  The No. 3 Gators (8-1, 2-0) ﬁ  n-
ished their tough SEC road trip in 
Knoxville, Tenn., with a 3-1 (28-26, 
25-23, 19-25, 25-17) victory over No. 18 Tennessee (9-2, 1-1).  
  Setter Kelly Murphy and right 
side hitter Tangerine Wiggs came up 
big for the Gators, hitting .410 and 
.400, respectively.
  Murphy recorded her third triple-
double of the season, and 18th of her 
career, after a performance of 19 kills, 
25 assists and 14 digs. Wiggs helped out with a career-high 10 kills.
  Cassandra Anderson added to 
the right side’s production, hitting a 
team-best .556 with ﬁ  ve kills on only 
nine total attacks. Three of her kills came in the fourth set.
  “I thought our setters, both Kelly and Chanel [Brown], did a great job 
of getting the ball to the right side,” 
coach Mary Wise said.
  Brown continued to play less like 
a freshman after a match-high 29 as-sists.  
  Callie Rivers and Kristy Jaeckel 
rounded out the four Gators to ﬁ  nish with double-digit kills. Rivers and Jaeckel ﬁ  nished with 10 and 12 kills, 
respectively.
  Although Rivers only hit .182, she 
made up for her low percentage with 
a match-high 17 digs. Jaeckel, who did not do much better, hitting .226, 
had nine digs and four blocks.
  “Our middles might not have 
been big point scorers offensively, 
they were huge in terms of block-
ing,” Wise said. “We won that match 
blocking balls.”
  Middle blocker Lauren Bledsoe 
hit .000 for the day against the Vol-unteers after recording just four kills 
on 15 total attacks. However, Bledsoe 
was the match’s best defender, re-cording eight blocks and even serv-ing an ace.
  After the Gators hit .372 and .303 
in the ﬁ  rst two sets, the team per-formed poorly in the third set, hitting 
.000 on nine attack errors — the com-bined total of their ﬁ  rst two sets.
They turned it around in the 
fourth set, hitting .471 as a team with 
just one attack error.
   “This is one of those matches 
where you can look down the roster and see the contributions out of ev-eryone,” Wise said. “From the back-
row play of Callie, to the blocking 
of our middles, the triple-double by Kelly, the offense of Tangerine Wiggs and the great libero performance by Erin [Fleming], this will go down as a 
total team effort tonight.”
  Florida held Tennessee — a team 
coming into the weekend hitting .302 
— to just .170 after blocking the Vol-
unteers 14 times.
  “It was an epic Tennessee-Florida 
battle,” Wise said. “It was good stuff 
going toe-to-toe. It was high-level volleyball for this early in the sea-
son.”
  The win over the Volunteers came 
two days after Florida opened SEC 
play with a 3-1 (18-25, 25-19, 25-13, 
25-20) victory over No. 22 Kentucky 
in Lexington, Ky., on Friday night. The Gators are now 20-0 in SEC open-ers under Wise.
  A radio broadcast contributed to this 
report.  Gators ﬁ  nish ﬁ  rst conference weekend unbeaten
“Can we beat Kentucky at home? 
I don’t know yet. Flip the coin, 
man.”

7 for 10
Brantley completed seven of ten passes on third 
down, all of which resulted in UF ﬁ  rst downs.8 tackles; 1 interception
The middle linebacker played a big part in helping UF limit Tennessee running
back Tauren Poole, who came into the game as the SEC’s leading rusher, to just 23 yards on the ground. Bostic led the team with eight tackles and picked off his second pass of the season when Tennessee was on the Florida three-yard line in the second quarter. His knack for getting those interceptions at the middle linebacker spot reminds us a little of Brandon Spikes, who recorded six at UF.
14 of 23, 167 yards, 1 TDThe Gators’ air attack was clearly not the key to their offense Saturday, as Brantley only attempted 23 passes while the team ran 49 times. But, when they called for him, Brantley proved to be clutch. On the Gators’ ﬁ  ve scoring drives, Brantley completed 11 of 16 passes and gained 121 of his 167 yards. He completed 5 of 7 passes on third downs on those drives, all of which were long enough to move the chains. While Brantley has been criticized for the passing game’s shortcomings thus far, he has yet to throw an interception.
26 carries, 73 yards rushing; 3 catches, 34 receiving yards; 2 kick returns, 
70 return yards
While he didn’t match his highlight-reel performance of last week, when he accounted for 255 total yards, Demps became the centerpiece of the Florida offense Saturday. He was limited to only 73 yards on a career-high 26 carries, but he still broke runs of 16 and 18 yards in the second half. Really, the biggest difference between this week and Florida’s ﬁ  rst two games was Demps’ inability to slip past the defense for one long run. But he still ﬁ  nished second on the team in receiving yards and catches, and his 43-yard kick return, along with a Tennessee facemask, set up the Gators’ ﬁ  rst touchdown.Frankie Hammond 
Jr. caught a ﬁ  ve-yard 
touchdown pass in the back of the end zone to put the Gators up 17-10 in the third quarter.
Jeremy Brown  
intercepted a pass in the third quarter to take the ball back just six plays after UF took a 17-10 lead.
Jon Bostic  helped 
prevent a Volunteers touchdown with an inter-ception near the goal line in the second quarter.
After Tennessee tied the game at 10 in the third quarter, the Gators’ offense failed to get a ﬁ  rst down on their 
ﬁ  rst three plays. But on fourth down, coach Urban Meyer called a fake punt and Omarius Hines ran for 36 yards to pick up the ﬁ  rst down and more. Florida eventually cashed in and scored on that drive to take a lead it would never relinquish. Steven H. Keys / Alligator Staff
  UF setter Kelly Murphy picked up her third triple-double 
of the season against Tennessee on Sunday.  
of what the Gators’ offense did after 
Hines’ run.
Quarterback John Brantley connected 
with wide receiver Frankie Hammond Jr. for a seven-yard touchdown in the back of the end zone just six plays later to put Florida up 17-10 and gain a lead 
it would never relinquish.
“When momentum shifts, you have 
to get it back somehow,” Meyer said. 
“When you have expe-
rienced offensive play-
ers, you don’t have 
to do that stuff. But 
when you have inex-perienced players, you 
have to somehow cre-
ate a play. Somehow someone has to make a 
play and get it back.”
The Vols were never able to take that 
momentum back, as the Gators went on to outscore them 21-7 after the fake punt.
Not many people were happier after 
the play than defensive coordinator Ter -
yl Austin, who saw his defense allow a 49-yard touchdown pass one drive ear -
lier.
“I was fired up,” Austin said. “It 
was great watching Omarius rumble 
through there … and it really got our 
side charged. It was a great call.”16, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 2010

It was an ugly ending to a hard-fought game for the Gators.
No. 5 Florida logged its first loss of the season Sunday , falling 
2-0 to two-time NCAA defending champion North Carolina.
Florida played very close with No. 1 UNC the entire match but 
couldn’t hold off the strength and athleticism of the Tar Heels. 
“The best part about this game is our team is mad that we lost,” 
coach Becky Burleigh said. “We should be. We weren’t trying to survive this game; we were trying to take it to them and I like that attitude of this team a lot. Our players never backed down. I thought they physically stepped up to the challenge and that’s a good sign.”
However, the Gators’ tough, persistent play was overshad-
owed by an unnecessary discrepancy when the officials waited too long to stop play after midfielder Tahnai Annis was t-boned by a Tar Heels defender and remained down on the pitch for more than a minute. The scuffle led to a late red card for Florida associ-ate coach Vic Campbell and a yellow card for Burleigh.
“There was no attempt to play the ball by the UNC defend-
er whatsoever,” Burleigh said. “The referee wouldn’t stop play which led to Vic and I getting booked when we were just trying to 
protect our player.”
North Carolina capitalized on scoring opportunities in the 
second half. The Tar Heels scored their first goal off a shot from 
UNC’s Alyssa Hawkins, which appeared to be saved by UF de-fender Kat Williamson but was ruled in by the line judge.
“I don’t think they had one legit goal all game,” senior Ashlee 
Elliott said. “I think they were all fluke goals, and we really pre-vented them from getting in the box. We all did really well with staying connected and communicating, but I think we handled 
them really well.”
Florida finished a very choppy first half with nine fouls and 
had more offside calls than shots on goal. North Carolina’s back 
three did a superb job at closing gaps and limiting scoring op-portunities for the Gators. The Tar Heels’ defense shut down UF’s leading scorer and captain McKenzie Barney, holding her to zero shot attempts.
“As soon as we started to stay composed I think we gave UNC 
a run for their money ,” Elliott said. “We kept them on their toes the 
whole game and considering we had a double-overtime game on 
Friday I think we did well coming back against the No. 1 team.”
But the Gators know they need to put the loss behind them with conference play looming.
 “Next weekend is ultimately more important than this one be-
cause we start SEC competition,” said Burleigh “As great as this weekend was for us, we just have to take what we learned from it into SEC play, but these are the games where the hardware is on 
the line.”
