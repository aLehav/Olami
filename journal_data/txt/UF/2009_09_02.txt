Growl band selected
By ANDREW NORRIS and
THOMAS STEWART
Alligator Writers
Of A Revolution, better known as O.A.R.,
will be the musical act at this year's Gator
Growl, organizers announced Tuesday.
The band will be paid about $90,000, event
producer Matt Sloan said.
Comedian and former "Saturday Night
Live" cast member Dana Carvey will also per
form at this year's event on Oct. 16.
Carvey will be paid about $90,000 as well,
Sloan said.
O.A.R. follows in the footsteps of Steve
Miller Band and Lynyrd Skynyrd, the last two
bands to play at Growl.
In a poll taken earlier this year, O.A.R. was
the top pick among students, beating out ThirdEye Blind, ZZ Top and Sugarland in a poll of
about 500 people, Sloan said.
O.A.R. should be a much more student-
friendly performance than prior acts with a re-
cent show that sold out Mad-
ison Square Garden, the top
10 hit "Shattered" and music
directed more toward a col-
lege audience, Sloan said.
"We're really fortunate to
have such a student-friendly
band want to come play at
Carve Gator Growl," Sloan said.
"We really want to put on a
show that the student body will be proud of."
This year, Sloan said organizers aimed to
spend more on talent, spending about $20,000

SG reveals records policy

By CAROLYN TILLO

Students may have the
chance to catch a better glimpse
of what their elected represen-
tatives are up to after Student
Body President Jordan John-
son revealed a new policy in
Tuesday night's Student Sen-
ate meeting.Johnson introduced a
waiver that, if signed, would
allow previously unavailable
Student Government records,
such as vot-
Student ing records
Government and video
recordings
of meetings, to be made public
to students.
"Tonight I come here to
challenge each and every one
of you to join me in signing
this," Johnson said as he held
his signed waiver up to the
Senate.
Johnson said the waiver,which is voluntary, was hand-
ed to all student senators Tues-
day.
"This is by far not the limit
of the things you can give up,
as I said earlier you don't even
have to sign the sheet at all,"
Johnson said.
Progress Party leader Dave
Schneider said he approved of
Johnson's new policy.
"We're thrilled that Presi-
dent Johnson is doing this," he
said. "I guess the only question
is, 'What took him so long?"'

Commissioner Lowe announces plan to run for mayor
Hanrahan's term ends in March
By JARED MISNER
Alligator Contributing Writer
City Commissioner Craig Lowe is mov-
ing on up -or at least he hopes to.
On Monday, Lowe, who received his
master's degree in zoology from UF, was
the first person to announce candidacy for
Gainesville mayor.
Mayor Pegeen Hanrahan's term will ex-
pire in March after six years on City Com-
mission and six years as mayor."Gainesville's a very special place,"
Lowe said. "We've put in programs that
have been a model for the rest of the coun-
try. During these hard economic times, we
need to make sure we keep Gainesville
Gainesville."
Fellow City Commissioner Jeanna Mas-
trodicasa spoke about Lowe's decision to
run.
"It's definitely been a goal of his for a
long time," she said.
Lowe was first elected to represent the4th District in the Gainesville City Com-
mission in 2003 when the commission was
expanded to include seven members. Lowe
was re-elected in 2004 and 2007.
"He's a very skilled policymaker."
Jeanna Mastrodicasa
City commissioner
Lowe said his foremost campaign is-
sues are developing economic and energy
plans that focus on the future.
He was instrumental in developing the
nation's first solar photovoltaic feed-intariff program in Gainesville earlier this
year.
"We need to constantly be refining and
improving and looking for opportunities
to move ahead," Lowe said.
Mastrodicasa said Lowe's greatest asset
as a candidate is his ability to make com-
promises.
"He's a very skilled policymaker," she
said.
Lowe expects the coming year to pres-
ent a challenging budget but not one that
is impossible to handle.

UF looks to inrease alternative transportation efforts
* 1,800 PEOPLE JOINED IN
LAST YEAR'S CHALLENGE.
By MOLLY LARMIE
Alligator Contributing Writer
The second annual Alternative
Transportation Fair, sponsored
by UF's Office of Sustainability,
revved into action Tuesday with
aims to promote the One Less Car
Challenge, which began on Aug.
24.
City and campus organiza-
tions held demonstrations and
passed out fliers on the Reitz
Union North Lawn from 9 a.m. to
2 p.m. while representatives from
the Office of Sustainability took
questions and helped students
register for the challenge.
Stephanie Sims, a program
assistant who helped coordinate
the event, stood at a booth and
instructed students on how to
register for the challenge.
Last year, almost 1,800 people
participated in the One Less Car
Challenge, according to Sims.
During last year's challenge,
participants avoided more than
48,000 automobile trips and pre-
vented more than 245 tons of car-bon dioxide from being released,
she said.
This year, the Office of Sus-tainability is looking for even Car Challenge will encourage
higher results. new members of the campus com-

great success of last year," said
Anna Prizzia, director of UF's Of-
fice of Sustainability.
Representatives from about 10
booths answered questions and
handed out pamphlets about the
different services offered around
Gainesville.
"Now, they need to build
some more bike racks."

UF senior
Justin Smith, an environmen-
tal engineering senior who par-
ticipated in the fair, said he's no-
ticed a large increase of bicycles
around campus.
"Now, they need to build some
more bike racks," he said.
Smith rides his bicycle to
most destinations or takes the
bus when it's raining. He said he
did not buy a parking decal this
year.
Smith offered advice to stu-
dents who will now be commut-
ing to campus.
"Wear a helmet because it's
dangerous out there," he said.

Readers upset over Sun ad
0 SOME CANCELED THEIR SUBSCRIPTIONS.
By PATRICK ANNESTY
Alligator Staff Writer
pannesty@alligator org
An advertisement in Monday's edition of The
Gainesville Sun has drawn criticism from some readers.
The advertisement began with "Barack Obama and
the Democrats did not inherit the bad economy; they
caused it and made it worse."
Some subscribers went as far as canceling their sub-
scriptions, The Gainesville Sun reported Tuesday.
According to the Web site of U.S. Citizens Associa-
tion, the group that purchased the ad, the organization's
goal is to halt "the slide to socialism that America is on
course for today."
Though the ad went on to make claims about the
Obama campaign's policies, some readers were more
concerned with the layout of the advertisement.
"There's a tiny disclaimer saying 'advertisement' at
the top of the page, but it looks like a news story," saidTom Miller, a 43-year-old Gainesville resident.
"It is difficult to distinguish what's news and what
is not."
Though Miller said he understands newspapers are
struggling to stay in business, he said they also "have
a responsibility to make sure there is
some sense of accuracy" when run-
ning advertisements that could be
"suspicious or misleading."' , He added he is concerned that
"anyone with money can put any-
gthin they want in the paper."
Mike Foley, former executive edi-
Foley tor of the St. Petersburg Times and
master lecturer at the UF College of
Journalism and Communications, said he was surprised
the font of the advertisement was so similar to the style
used for news stories. He also said he was disappointed
that the text identifying the page as an ad was so small.
Requests for comment from the publisher were re-
ferred to the advertising department, which did not im-
mediately return calls.
STUDENT LIFE
Rental site offers textbooks
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Writer
Students can add another com-
pany to their list of textbook provid-
ers.
Chegg.com, a textbook rental site,
helps students save 65 to 85 percent
off the list price of textbooks, wrote
Tina Couch, the vice president of
public relations, in an e-mail.
"With the economy the way it is,
parents and students are being a lot
more cost-conscious," Couch wrote.
Couch wrote Chegg.com, which
houses more than 2.4 million books
at its Kentucky warehouse, is free to
join. Students can opt to rent books"With the economy the
way it is, parents and stu-
dents are being a lot more
cost-conscious."
Tina Couch
Chegg.com VP of public relations
for a semester, quarter or summer.
Sophomore Shakara Lawrence
said she heard about Chegg.com
from a classmate during sum-
mer session and a "Good Morning
America" segment.
Lawrence said she used the site
because it's inexpensive, and, unlike
other students, she does not have toworry about bookstore buybacks.
But Kenny Roberts, owner of
Orange & Blue Textbooks, said stu-
dents do not have time to wait for
the books they ordered online.
He said his bookstore offers pro-
motions that online services don't,
like 30-day deferment, free movies
and free drinks, to help offset book
prices.
Lynne Vaughan, the director
of UF Bookstores, said UF might
eventually offer a textbook rental
service.
Vaughan said Follett Higher Ed-
ucation Group, which manages the
UF Bookstores, is testing rental ser-
vices at other schools this fall.

portray city life
By MEREDITH RUTLAND
Alligator Contributing Writer
Local residents will get a chance to showcase their talent
in the city's first photography contest.
The contest, titled "The Gainesville Way of Life," is open
to anyone 18 or older. While the photographer doesn't have
to live in Gainesville, the photo must be taken within city
limits. Entries can be submitted through Oct. 18 to the city
of Gainesville photo pool on Flickr.com, accessible at cityof-
gainesville.org.
Doug Whitaker, president of the Exposure Photography
Club at UF, said photos can be especially powerful when fo-
cused on a distinct location because they help reveal the iden-
tity of the town and its residents.
Around John Kaplan, UF professor of photo-Gainesville journalism and two-time Pulitzer judge,
said the key is to immerse oneself in the
topic in order to empathize with the subject.
"As I tell my students, if it looks good in the viewfinder,
take one step closer," he said. "It may look even better."
John Freeman, UF associate professor of journalism, said
the best photos will be of residents at work and play but
should not be of landscapes unless they use creative light-
ing.
He said judges will look for novel approaches to the sub-
ject: "A scene from an unusual vantage point. A different time
of day. Unusual lighting. A special moment or emotion."
Whitaker said photography can become very personal
and may not make sense if explained in another medium.
As a senior mathematics and statistics major, Whitaker
said he understands how classes leave little free time for
amateur photography but will use this contest to return to
his hobby.
"Anything that motivates people to go and take more pho-
tos is good, both because you practice your technique and are
usually challenged to take pictures of new things that you
haven't considered before," he said.

SAA boxes go green
0 THEY WILL BE SENT TO
TROOPS OVERSEAS.
By JARED MISNER
Alligator Contributing Writer
When UF won its most recent
college football championship
in January, Steven Garces flew
a Gators flag proudly like most
Gators fans.
Except Steven Garces was sta-
tioned overseas in Afghanistan.
Now in a separate deployment,
Garces wants a few UF posters to
hang in his tent at Fort Huachuca
in Sierra Vista, Ariz.
In an effort to support American
troops domestically and abroad,
UF's Student Alumni Association
has introduced a program this year
that asks all members to bring back
their gift boxes when they are fin-
ished and fill them with toiletries
and non-perishable food items for
Gators soldiers everywhere.
"If we can get these boxes in
Gator hands overseas, that's really
our goal," said Laura Lentz, asso-
ciate director of membership and
marketing for the Florida Cicero-
nes.
The idea of shipping the SAA
Box, a gift for all members that
includes Gators memorabilia and
coupons for local businesses, to
American troops actually blos-
somed out of a sustainability dis-
cussion, Lentz said.
"We're using soy ink, 100 per-
cent recyclable materials, the print-
er used to print the boxes uses windpower and all that happy jazz,"
Lentz said.
In addition to the sustainable ef-
forts used to create the box, SAA's
goal is to keep it out of landfills by
reusing the totes to send to Ameri-
can troops around the globe.
The new design of the box
doesn't use laminated materials
and cuts one-third of the overall
expense, Lentz said. SAA is able to
use those savings and apply them
to the postage used to mail each
box.
Some UF students are unaware
of the program, however.
Victor Rosado, 23, didn't know
about the pro-
International gram, but he
News expressed in-
terest in the
new sustain-
ability efforts of the box.
"Last year, all the boxes ended
up in landfills as litter. Now, SAA
is reusing and recycling," Rosado
said.
Boxes filled will be sent to troops
approximately every three months,
according to the UF Alumni Asso-
ciation's Web site.
Since the initiative's beginning
during this summer's Preview,
SAA has received approximately 30
boxes, most of which were returned
during the first week of school.
"The idea is that every soldier
gets a box or just something to
open. It's like a gift," Lentz said.
Non-perishable food and toi-
letry donations can be dropped off
at Emerson Alumni Hall located at
1938 W University Ave.Lowe to focus on economy, energy
MAYOR, from page 1
He also spoke about the
rising tuition at UF.
"That issue is relatively
out of my hands, but I would
be concerned if some of our
residents were being priced
out of getting their full four-
year education at the Univer-
sity of Florida," Lowe said.
During his near-seven-
year tenure on the commis-
sion, Lowe has consistently
been an outspoken supporter
for equal opportunities for all
citizens, most recently with
his adamant opposition to
Gainesville's proposed Char-
ter Amendment 1 this year.
The proposed amendment
failed in March.
Lowe, who initially re-
ceived his bachelor's de-
gree from the University of
Georgia, said that UF's re-
lationship with the city of
Gainesville is crucial.
"The role UF plays in de-
veloping the character of
Gainesville cannot be over-
stated," Lowe said. "Our des-
tinies are intertwined."
Mastrodicasa had only one
piece of advice for Lowe dur-
ing his mayoral candidacy.
"He has to tone down that
Georgia Bulldog pride dur-
ing football season," Mast-
rodicasa said.
Mayoral elections will be
held March 16.Courtesy of Craig Lowe
City Commissioner Craig Lowe announced Monday he will
run for mayor of Gainesville.

Bad Ad
Sneaky advertisements
compromise credibilityBuried inside the Monday edition of the Gainesville Sun
was a full-page ad purchased by a political advocacy
group. The ad claimed, among other things, that Dem-
ocrats caused the subprime mortgage crisis and that Obama
was a socialist.
Stealth ads are nothing new. In April, the Los Angeles
Times went under fire for running a PR piece about an NBC
pilot on its front page. The piece had an NBC logo on it and
"advertisement" written on the top, but the ad was desirable,
according to the president of entertainment marketing for
NBC, because it had "editorial voice."
Newspapers are in trouble, no doubt. But running adver-
tisements that pose as articles is not an acceptable answer to
declining revenues.
Giving even a semblance of "editorial voice" to corpora-
tions is just as much, if not more, of an abomination.
If print news is going to compete against blogs and online
news sites, its biggest asset is established credibility. Ads that
blatantly attempt to deceive readers will not be appreciated,
and making money off of a single ad is not worth the risk.
Desperate times call for desperate measures, usually.
However, when a newspaper is desperate, it shouldn't resort
to losing its integrity. When newspapers become soapboxes
for television networks to peddle their mindless products or
for whack jobs to pay for the publication of alarmist view-
points, they are no longer newspapers. Killing something for
the sake of saving it does not make sense.
Busted for Caps
As communication andinscription technolo-
gies become increas-
ingly digitized and "neti-
quette" is now expected to be
second nature, it is important
to exercise caution.
No, we aren't talking
about the Facebook picture
you took with your fellow
Tri Delts this week (who ap-
parently don't know what the
"Eiffel Tower" stance means),
although those can jeopardize
your jobs, too. We're talking
about a New Zealand accoun-
tant who was fired for send-
ing e-mails in all caps.
Everyone knows that writ-
ing in all caps is one of the
biggest Internet offenses that
can be committed. Not only
do capital letters not have any
ascenders or descenders, ren-
dering them difficult to read,
they are widely regarded as
the online equivalent to yell-
ing.
But firing a woman for
sending out e-mails in all caps
because they caused "dishar-mony in the workplace"?
Wouldn't a simple e-mail (in
all caps, so she got the point)
be a better solution?
We agree that you're not
allowed to type in all caps
unless you're someone com-
menting onYouTube about an
Aaliyah video (RIP), a LOLcat
or talking to SmarterChild
on AIM. However, the fact
that some people managed
to miss the memo on proper
caps-lock usage indicates that
there should be Internet train-
ing courses in elementary
schools to teach kids that on-
line actions can put their jobs
on the line in real life.
Granted, the woman was
an accountant and not a certi-
fied wordsmith, but everyone
should be held accountable
for the wrath he or she can
unleash on readers' eyeballs
with an impression on that
dreaded button. And, ev-
eryone should be aware that
their online persona can come
back to, ahem, cap them in
the ass.

Passing judgment is healthy behavior
C onfession: I'm judging you.I consider this fair warning. If at any point you
walked by a redhead on campus with a dispropor-
tionately raised eyebrow, that was probably me, and you
were probably wearing/doing/saying something I consid-
ered questionable.
If you walk into class wearing a skirt as a dress, I judge
you. If your Facebook status updates are only about how
much you love your boyfriend, I judge you while blocking
you on my newsfeed. If you happen to state in your newspa-
per design class, "I don't know why I have so much trouble
in this class. I designed my apartment, and it's really cute!"
-Boom. Judged.
If you're the guy who was in the journalism school last
Wednesday wearing an Ohio State University shirt, I'm re-
ally judging you. I also wonder if you have a death wish.
Face it. Everybody makes judgments about everybody
else based on superficial things or first impressions. My
worldview was validated at age 10 when my mom forced
me to read "The Phantom Tollbooth" after I refused because
the cover looked stupid. I hated it.
Judging gets a bad rap. That said, my judgments are
pretty flexible. I might openly think a girl's headband is ri-
diculous, but I won't stop being someone's friend because
she wears leggings as pants. And I realize that the judgment
street runs both ways. As Jane Austen wrote in "Pride and
Prejudice," "For what do we live but to make sport for our
neighbors and laugh at them in our turn?" (Yeah, that was
kind of pretentious. Feel free to judge.)
I've also found judging helpful in situations beyond peo-
ple-watching at bars. Some decisions that your friends make
are really stupid and deserve judgment.
Excessive drug and alcohol use fall into this category, as
does staying in an abusive relationship. Everyone needs a
friend at times like these, but no one was ever helped by his
or her friends reserving judgment on self-destructive behav-
ior. The world might be a better place if we were all morehonest about what we thought of oth-
ers' actions.
Making judgments about people
can save you from bad relationship
decisions, too. Does he seem sketchy?
Does your friend seem untrust-
Hilary Lehman worthy? If it's a judgment based on
ette rs@a Iligator org more than clothing or taste in music,
it's probably valid.
I've heard the argument that if
you make a judgment too soon, you can miss out on getting
to know someone great, and I won't say that's untrue. Maybe
that works for you. But I'm going to make a judgment and
guess that you've never been seriously hurt by someone you
had refused to judge despite ample evidence. If you've been
through that and can still believe in human nature enough to
avoid making character judgments, more power to you. You
have more faith than I do.
I know I've got a platform here from which to judge, so I'll
even the playing field.
I love Fleetwood Mac. I'm not sure I've ever broken a
10-minute mile. I used to watch "Charmed" reruns in the
morning with some regularity. I can quote portions of "The
Lord of the Rings" movies at length. I had a rolling backpack
in high school. I think Sam Bradford is more attractive than
Tim Tebow.
Feel better?
It's actually pretty freeing when you realize that people
make both positive and negative judgments about you ev-
ery day, no matter what you do. But in the end, we're all
too consumed by self-judgment to spend too much time on
other people.
Unless you're the girl I saw twice last week with a hair-
style apparently inspired by Cindy Lou Who. I dropped
what I was doing and judged you. Both times.

Guest column
Public 'shaming' detracts
from compassion, love
s posing nude shameful?
Two weeks ago at the Teen
Choice Awards, Dane Cook called
out Vanessa Hudgens (the girl from
"High School Musical") for leaking ex-
plicit camera-phone pictures of herself
online. "Girl," he said before present-
ing the Choice Hottie award, "you gots
to keep your clothes on! Phones are for
phone calls, girl."
It was a pretty light rebuke. Any time
you say someone "gots to" do some-
thing, you can't be completely in attack
mode.
But people reacted as if he had gone
too far: The crowd booed him; the clip
was cut from the final show and pages
of YouTube comments called the quip
unfunny. That's quite a surprise consid-
ering people usually love denouncing
slutty celebrities.
I think the difference is that Cook
wasn't making fun of Hudgens. He was
shaming her. Society thinks that por-
nography is wrong. And when one per-
son publicly tells another person on be-
half of a group that something is wrong,
that's shame.
Hudgens knew she was being
shamed. As soon as Cook finished, her
face withered from that endearing look
that says "I'm cute and modest about
being singled out for special atten-
tion" to a blank stare where she felt the
alienating disapproval of thousands of
people.
All the teens who are riled up about
the comment are really just angry be-
cause shame is uncomfortable. When
they hear Hudgens being shamed for
taking her clothes off, they hear their
own fathers berating them in front of
friends for staying out too late, wearing
immodest clothes and having too many
boyfriends. Everyone's a little bit of an
outcast.Will Penman That's the
Speaking Out problem, I think,
with shame. It
doesn't change
people's attitudes, just their behavior.
It's possible Hudgens will never go top-
less again. But if she does, this strategy
of shame will only further ingrain in her
a sense that she can't live up to expecta-
tions.
Shame is the voice of the group con-
vincing the individual to get in line.
As modern Americans, though, we
don't really believe the group deserves
a voice. "The Scarlet Letter" scares us.
Action motivated externally by public
opinion is cheap.
I'm not saying we should just sit back
and approve. Cultivating lust through
pornography prizes passion over self-
control and self-absorption over sacri-
ficial love.
In a world where I'm just as capable
of child abuse or of walking out on my
wife as the next guy, self-control and
sacrificial love are important.
It's just that the deeper the prob-
lem is, the less surface treatments like
shame will be effective. How should
we respond to Hudgens? I can think
of several solutions. We could destroy
all camera phones. We could finance
Obama's health care plan with a sin tax
on porn, settling for physical well-be-
ing at the expense of moral health. We
could ignore her. But looking away isn't
always sufficient.
Best of all is to remember that you
can love people even when they're
wrong. Love encourages; shame tugs
with the disemboweling hook of social
disappointment.
And with that, our conscience re-
lieved, we can get back to the winner of
the Choice Hottie award.

SG discusses $14M budget
SENATE, from page 1
The $14 million 2010-2011 bud-
get was a hot topic of debate, when
an hourlong discussion ensued
over senators' questions about how
students' money was planning to
be spent.
The budget is comprised of stu-
dents' activity and service fees and
is used to fund SG-sponsored orga-
nizations. It will be voted on during
next Tuesday's meeting.
Student Body Treasurer Maryam
Laguna said SG will hire a consult-
ing firm to evaluate the needs of SG
and how to make SG more efficient
for the student body. SG is allocat-
ing $15,500 for this project, and the
firm has not been chosen yet.
But Orange and Blue Party
Sen. Ben Cavataro questioned
why SG was spending so much
when it could hire Gators.
Laguna said that a firm, unlike UFstudents, has experience working
with other student governments
across the country.
"We're students, " she said. "No
one has enough time or energy to
commit to something like this."
Laguna announced the rein-
statement of The New York Times
readership program at the cost of
$60,300.
She said she received legitimate
suggestions from the student body
about how the program would im-
prove the student experience.
Orange and Blue Party Sen. Jon
Ossip said almost 2,000 students
joined a Facebook group to keep
the paper on campus, he said.
"These are the people that saved
The New York Times," he said.
Senators also dished out about
$2,230 to four different organiza-
tions, including Doctors without
Borders, Hope for Haiti, Invisible
Children and Amnesty Interna-
tional.Matt Tripp/ Alligator Staff

more for the band and comedian than they did last
year. Organizers also plan to announce another
surprise act as early as next week, Sloan said.
He said organizers had to get creative in pro-
moting the show and recruiting sponsors this
year, asking for help or trading services with
the Gainesville Area Chamber of Commerce,
UF's Alumni Association and Gator Domino's.
Some students are pleased with the results so far.
"I am very excited about having O.A.R. at Gator
Growl this year," UF accounting sophomore Ethan
Latinsky said. "They are an awesome band and one
that I have always wanted to hear live."
Aside from appealing to a college audience,
Griffin said O.A.R. was also chosen because of the
band's philanthropic background.
Growl is now in its 86th year and is being pro-
moted as the largest student-run pep rally in the
world, with more than 500 student volunteers.
The theme of the show, "Legends of the Swamp,"
is meant to honor the football greats who have
passed through the Swamp over the years.

cost $25.

UF FOOTBALL
Running back trio set to take pressure off Tebow
By BOBBY CALLOVI
Alligator Staff Writer
bcallovi@alligator org
Tim Tebow can finally rest his
legs some.
Although the quarterback will
still play a large role in the run-
ning game, Florida feels comfort-
able with its three running backs
heading into the season.
For most of the last two sea-
sons, the Gators had no one they
could trust to hand the ball off to
so that Tebow wouldn't have to
carry the ball the majority of the
time.
By the end of last year, fresh-
men Chris Rainey and Jeff Demps
emerged as viable options in the
backfield to take some of the load
off from Tebow, who carried the
ball 176 times last season.
The two speedsters along with
junior Emmanuel Moody, who is
now healthy enough to contrib-
ute, have earned the confidence
of coach Urban Meyer this off-
season, and will be counted on to
take most of the carries.
"I've been very critical of that
position and deservedly so,"
Meyer said. "We have not had theDivision I-A, highest level of col-
lege football level tailback.
"We have been at receiver, we
have been at quarterback, but we
are getting close. I'm not as wor-
ried about handing off as I used
to be."
Rainey and Demps showed
plenty of big-play potential last
year, both averaging 7.8 yards
per carry on their way to more
than 600 rushing yards each, but
neither had more than 85 carries
on the year -Rainey finished
with 84, and Demps had 78.
Besides Tebow, the Gators re-
lied heavily on wide receiver Per-
cy Harvin in the run game. Har-
vin carried the ball 70 times for
660 yards and 10 touchdowns.
To prepare the trio of backs
for increased roles in the offense,
running backs coach Kenny Cart-
er worked on making the three
players more well-rounded.
"We worked on all the minor
details of the position that really
separate you from others like be-
ing efficient in movement, being
really technical when it comes
to pass protection," Carter said.
"All those things are critical of

Gators respond to loss of Elliott
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
etorrens@a IIigator org
From orange soccer cleats to metallic crutch-
es.
Ashlee Elliott's senior season came to a
screeching halt when she tore her left ACL in
the 16th minute of Florida's soccer match against
USF on Sunday.
Elliott had the ball and was waiting for a team-
mate when the ball got caught up under her feet.
She tried to move her upper body but turned too
far on her left knee.
"It didn't even hurt, it was just like a shock,"
Elliott said. "I was like, 'Man, did I just do what
I think I did?"'
She started walking and figured immediately
it was a torn ACL. She got an MRI during half-
time and received texts detailing the game she
had left.
Elliott said Tuesday she didn't want to red-
shirt and was still planning on graduating in De-cember and trying to break into Women's Profes-
sional Soccer in the spring.
Some of her teammates didn't realize the mag-
nitude of the injury when Elliott went down.
Goalkeeper Katie Fraine figured Elliott
wouldn't even need a substitute.
When midfielder Lindsay
Thompson heard it was Elliott's
knee, she immediately assumed
an ACL injury, which would meanSoccer the end of Elliott's season.
Midfielder Tahnai Annis, who
scored the winning goal against
South Florida, called the ordeal "surreal."
"It's definitely a reality check for everyone,"
Annis said.
Elliott's absence eliminates one of the team's
most sure-fire offensive weapons.
Annis said Elliott was an integral part of the
attack -a target at forward who could post up
or face up and go.

triguing and far more than "a bit
of a mismatch," as one reporter
put it to UF coach Urban Meyer
in a press conference on Mon-
day.
In that same press conference,
Meyer reiterated a point he has
made time and again throughout
the offseason: It is not the Gators
goal to play the toughest sched-
ule in the nation.
Furthermore, it's probably not
their goal to play a tough sched-
ule at all.
Call him conservative, scared
or even elitist.
I'll call him smart.
Unfortunately, thereisnoplay-
off in college football. The way the
current BCS system is construct-
ed makes it beneficial for pow-erhouseslike UF to

If the ultimate goal is to watch

Debose's unusual injury slows decision
* LB DUSTIN DOE WILL
MISS THE CHARLESTON
SOUTHERN GAME.
By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmccaIl@a Iligator org
Receiver Andre Debose's
first year at Florida is in lim-
bo.
Coach Urban Meyer said
he would meet with Debose's
parents and doctors Tuesday
night to discuss whether De-
bose needs surgery to repair
tendon damage in his ham-
string.
Meyer stopped short of
saying that surgery would
mean a redshirt for Debose,
but he would miss a large
chunk of the season at the
least.
"It's an unusual injury,"
Meyer said. "Coach [Mickey
Marottil told me they found
[a specialist] somewhere who
has more information. Once
again, I'm not in the medical
profession, but what doctors
do is, if they have experience
with it, there's no issue.
"If they don't have experi-
ence with it, they call around
and talk to colleagues. He has
one of those unusual ones,
and our training staff has not
dealt with this before."
Meyer should make anannouncement regarding
Debose's treatment plans
Wednesday.
DOE SUSPENDED FOR
OPEN E R: Meyer said seniorlinebacker Dustin Doe is
suspended for the Gators'
opener against Charleston
Southern on Saturday.
Doe was arrested in July
after repeatedly driving witha suspended license and re-
cently rejoined the team.
Meyer added that he will
consider Doe's status on a
week-to-week basis, and he
could miss more games.

Thompson moves to forward
Andrew Stanfill / Alligator Staff
UF sophomore Lindsay Thompson (18) will be counted on to help replace Ashlee Elliott up
front. Thompson played midfield as a freshman.
UF may utilize two-back sets
FOOT, from page 14
what you need to do in this of-
fense as a back."
Not only will the three be re-
lied on to take more carries, but
they will also be key in pass pro-
tection.
Last year, the Gators used
Kestahn Moore to block for the
quarterback from the running
back position.
With Moody the only one of
the three who weighs more than
200 pounds, pass protection has
been a major focus in practices.
For Rainey, it wasn't just his
on-the-field shortcomings that
needed work this offseason.
Carter sat him down after last
season and warned him that if he
did not start studying the plays
more, he would not play in the
fall.
"The pressure was turned up
this summer, and he knew heneeded to take ownership and re-
ally bear down and do more than
just train," Carter said. "I told
him. The head coach told him.
The Pounceys told him. It was a
no-brainer. He bought in."
Rainey has pleased the coaches
with his new dedication, but him
and Moody will
start the game on
the bench watch-
ing Demps, who
Football Meyer named the
starter.
Neither are like-
ly to wait long especially with UF
using two-back formations this
season.
The three will be counted on to
take some pressure off Tebow in
the running game, but they will
be aided by having each other to
share the role.
"With a group of guys, like
the running backs we got, it's
nice because you've got security
behind you," Demps said.SOCCER, from page 14
Thompson, who rotated with Elliott
against the Bulls on Sunday, may now be
relied upon more than she anticipated.
While Thompson plays more with
speed, she can't possibly match the size
-or experience -Elliott provided.
Thompson didn't play forward last
year so she is still getting used to it.
"It's definitely more offensive orient-
ed," Thompson said. "You hardly have
any defensive responsibilities."
And while Elliott may have been a pri-
marily offensive player, Fraine will miss
her downfield target.
"(Elliott)'s always a target on goal
kicks and punts and stuff like that just
because of her amazing ability to win
balls in the air," Fraine said. "I'm going to
have to find a new target player. Jessica
(Eicken) can do it, Lindsay (Thompson)
can do it.
"It's just that (Elliott) definitely stands
out in a crowd."
While Elliott is powerless to help the
team on the field, she can be just as ca-
KYLE, from page 14
the top dog, and Meyer knows that.
What I find interesting is that line of thinking
is in sharp contrast to that of college basketball,
a reasonable sport with a performance-based
system for determining a champion.
The UF men's basketball team is taking on
Michigan State, Syracuse, NC State and Xavier
in its nonconference schedule this year, and
those games can only help them -the polar
opposite of college football.
If the Gators lose those games it's no big deal
-only a few more losses on the resume.
But if they win, suddenly they've bolstered
their NCAA Tournament resume and stand to
make the field of 65 and possibly earn a high-
ranking seed.
Billy Donovan's goal should be to make the
toughest schedule in the nation, because in the
end you're only rewarded for it.
There's many arguments for why the NCAA"She's going to help everybody

the sidelines, that's for sure."
Lindsay Thompson
UF sophomore forward
pable as ever off of it.
Whether it's her work in rehab or pro-
viding an extra pair of eyes to hold peo-
ple accountable on the field, Elliott can
still be an invaluable aid to the team, as
well as being one of the most enthusiastic
cheerleaders for the team.
"She's going to help everybody and
you're going to hear her on the sidelines,
that's for sure," Thompson said.
Elliott's injury comes as a surprise, but
in the world of sports such an injury is
commonplace.
And while injuries are liable to hap-
pen any time, any place and to anyone,
Elliott's teammates can't afford to let their
inhibitions tame their play.
"If you're out there playing afraid to
get hurt, you're not going to play your
best," Fraine said.
should install a playoff system in college foot-
ball and this one should be at the top of the
list.
Fans get cheated out of sweet potential
matchups, like Florida-Utah, because one loss
can cripple your chances of winning a national
championship.
March Madness is the single greatest post-
season sporting event, and I can only imagine
what an end-of-the-year tournament would do
for the college football environment.
Not only would the tournament be wildly
entertaining and crown a worthy king of col-
lege football, it would allow coaches like Meyer
to keep the Charleston Southerns and FIUs of
the world off their schedule.
For now, the Floridas and Ohio States of the
world will continue to schedule cream puffs be-
cause that's what will help them win a champi-
onship within the BCS formula.
College football fans might be the most pas-
sionate and rabid fan base there is, and they de-
serve better than I-AA tune-up games.
