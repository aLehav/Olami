The BP oil spill leak may have been capped, but 
the fight to reclaim the waters of the Gulf of Mexico 
is far from over. 
Former U.S. Senator and Florida Gov. Bob Gra-
ham spoke to a crowd of more than 170 people at 
Pugh Hall on Thursday evening about his research 
on the largest oil spill in U.S. history and measures that could prevent a future disaster.
As co-chairman of the National Commission on 
the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling, Graham worked on a 380-page report that delved into the causes of the spill, its effects and potential solutions. Many members of Congress oppose measures that would involve the federal 
government in corporate oil interests, but Graham 
doesn’t see this as a purely private-industry issue. 
The Gulf of Mexico belongs to all U.S. citizens, 
Graham said. Citizens are the landlords of those waters, and companies like BP are the tenants. 
“You don’t want your tenant to be trashing your 
property,” he said.
UF sophomore Julia Slayden, an environmental 
engineering major, was surprised when Graham discussed how offshore oil drilling is still consid-ered by many to be a viable option.
“We really need to focus on stopping the re-
surgence of interest in offshore drilling,” she said. “You would think [that would have ended] after the oil spill in April.”
The BP spill commission will complete its work 
in mid-March, but members may create a nonprofit organization to support further research and advo-cacy on the issue, Graham said in a later interview.  
Company pays $10K for agriculture commissioner’s daughter’s cake at auction
LAKELAND — A 9-year-old girl’s cake 
brought in a lot of dough in Florida.
Cash, that is — $10,000 to be exact. A 
fertilizer company paid the sum for Abigail 
Putnam’s cake at the Polk County Youth Fair. 
Abigail’s father, Adam Putnam, is the 
state’s agriculture commissioner. He says even she knew a cake isn’t worth $10,000 and donated $9,000 of her money back to the fair.Fair officials tell The Ledger of Lake-
land that the company, Mosaic, typically buys many things from the students who sell livestock and baked goods at the an-nual event.
Mosaic spokesman Russell Schweiss 
says an employee had been given a lump sum to buy items at the fair. 
He says the company is investigating 
the pricey cake purchase.

Geta.
It’s a noun. The English pronunciation for a 
wooden shoe from Japan. 
But for 15 long, slow seconds in the Kirby 
Smith Center, ‘geta’ was the only thing that mat-tered for Pierce Tolar. 
He didn’t even know what a ‘geta’ was. But as 
he spelled it in his head, he knew he had it.
“G-E.”The excitement bubbled up inside him.“T.”
He paused again. Focus.
“A.”The room of about 150 parents and grandpar -
ents erupted in applause. Pierce sighed, smirked and sat back in his chair.
The Alachua County School District had found its champion speller — a home-schooled 
12-year-old.
The breakfast of this champion: waffles and a 
glass of milk.
Pierce was one of 37 elementary- and middle-
schoolers from the district who were whittled 
down by 15 rounds of spelling Thursday.
Round one started with “easy” words such 
as “capillary” and “bombastic.” Some students 
grimaced through the tough parts 
like the “ph” in “peripheral.” The 
shrill ring of a service desk bell played off competitors for their 
misspellings.
Between rounds, parents waited like boxing 
trainers on their children, offering them water and calming advice. But Pierce’s dad, Mike Tolar, sat back in his seat.
Up next for Pierce is the regional competition, 
which will be held February in Jacksonville. Victory is spelled G-E-T-A

n THE PLUTO DECISION IS 
JUST ONE PART OF HIS DISTINGUISHED CAREER.
By KAT BEIN
Alligator Staff Writer
Bo Gustafson learned as a child 
there’s never one answer. Ask him a question and he’ll smile, knowing there’s no such thing as a simple, concise response.
“I concluded there is no answer, 
there is more than one answer,” he said. “I decided that it’s very im-portant for you not to remember the answers to any question, but to work them out through reason-ing.”
Since then, he’s dedicated his 
life to searching for answers to questions that only lead to more questions.
For the past 30 years, Gustafson 
has taught students about the plan-ets, stars, galaxies and everything in between.
In his down time, he’s searched 
for the foundation of our universe in places like the rings of Saturn and the atmosphere around Jupiter and the Sun. 
But the one question that he just 
cannot shake — why, Professor Gustafson, did you kill Pluto?
A few years back, Gustafson was 
one of about eight chosen by the In-ternational Astronomical Union to write proposals to finally pin-down the definition of the term planet. The final result left little Pluto out in the cold.Gustafson has heard all the com-
plaints. Friends and students won’t 
leave him alone about it. How could 
he actually take away a planet?He thinks they’re just getting 
caught up in the details.
“For some reason, there is a lot 
of emotional interest in Pluto,” he said. “I would say it’s not an issue worth debating whether Pluto is a 
planet because the planet is just the 
label.”
Born in Sweden, Gustafson 
spent hours studying physics in local libraries, determined to learn 
more than the repetitive lesson 
plans his teachers asked students to regurgitate.
In college, he stunned professors 
by inserting himself into scientific 
debates and composing thesis pa-
pers that contradicted the facts they taught. 
But his thirst for knowledge and 
habit of rejecting face-value conclu-
sions only made him stand out.  In 
1977, he left Europe for the United States to work with NASA.
Three years later, he came to UF 
to create the Laboratory of Astro-
physics. His goal was to strengthen 
the state’s involvement in space-
related research.
Throughout his career, he’s 
played a role in many of NASA’s 
exploratory missions, such as the 
Ulysses satellite to the sun, the 
Galileo mission to Jupiter, and the 
Cassini mission to Saturn.
His latest project has him devel-
oping smaller, low-cost space crafts 
which he believes could help in the 
challenge to solve global social is-
sues caused by resource inequali-
ties. 
And he still questions every-
thing.

n SHE IS THE ONLY COUNTY 
COMMISSIONER TO DONATE.
By MEREDITH RUTLAND
Alligator Writer 
Fresh off an election cycle, Ala-
chua County Commissioner Susan 
Baird is not hesitant about stepping 
into the world of campaigning.
Baird is making her support 
known, contributing money to four candidates in the Gainesville City 
Commission race: Rob Zeller, Don Marsh, Robert Krames and Todd 
Chase.
She donated between $100 and 
$200 to each candidate. So far, she is the only Alachua County Commis-
sioner to donate to a candidate.
She said she always sets money 
aside for charities, and this year she used some of that money to support candidates who will create jobs.
“I think the best charity right 
now is jobs for a lot of people,” Baird said.
Krames said he appreciates Baird’s support. 
“I agree with Susan on a vast ma-
jority of issues,” he said.
Two of the candidates she sup-
ports, Robert Krames and Todd Chase, are running against each 
other for the District 2 seat.
“I don’t care which one of those 
wins,” she said.  “They’re both great. 
Just give me one.”
None of the candidates Baird is 
endorsing is currently in office. Baird said she isn’t supporting the current commissioners because they’ve vot-
ed for tax increases, the fire assess-
ment fee and other measures that she doesn’t agree with.
“It’s not that I don’t like them,” 
she said. “I just don’t believe in their philosophies.”Baird donates to 
several candidates
He could win $100,000 to build a children’s hospital in Gainesville
ship with UF and Shands at UF to build a children’s hospital 
in Gainesville. The foundation was named after the founder’s 
3-year-old son who died in 2007 after an accidental medical 
overdose. 
“Children’s needs are more unique; they aren’t little adults,” 
said Linda Michalisin, a spokeswoman for the foundation.
Michalisin said a pediatric emergency room will open in 
July in the old Shands emergency room, which will lead to a full hospital in upcoming years.
“It’s a project that has come from a dream to a reality ,” she 
said.Since the organization launched shortly after Sebastian’s 
death, it has raised more than $7 million. 
MIchalisin said that with the help of Donovan and support 
of the community, cases like Sebastian’s will be prevented.
“To be able to take a tragedy and turn it into a catalyst for 
positive change is amazing,” she said.
The 14 teams were selected based on ESPN’s 
“Game of the Week” schedule, according to Ray Daniels of Infiniti’s product communications.
Infiniti, which is sponsoring the event, is a partner with 
NCAA men’s basketball. 
This is the first year the Coaches Challenge has happened.
Fred Demarest, assistant athletics director for communica-
tions for men’s basketball, said it is a great opportunity for the University Athletic Association to make a positive impact and 
to continue helping the community.
He said Donovan has been involved with the foundation 
and respects what it stands for.
“It is something he was happy to bring awareness to the lo-
cal and national levels,” he said.
Donovan was in the lead as of Thursday night with 42 per -
cent of the vote. He had an eight percent lead on John Calipari, coach for the University of Kentucky.
“We’re Gators,” Michalisin said. “We can’t lose to Ken-
tucky.”

The integration of a new automated 
system will allow the Student Night-
time Auxiliary Patrol to run more ef-ficiently and decrease students’ wait time.
The system allows students to re-
quest a ride online, via text or over the phone working with an automated 
system, said Officer Pablo de Jesus Jr.,  
SNAP’s head supervisor.
The new system will hopefully be 
in effect within the next few months, he said.
According to University Police 
Capt. Jeff Holcomb, ideally students will program their own profiles into the system, and it’ll keep track of all 
your requested rides on campus.
“We’re hoping to be able to utilize 
the system and increase efficiency at a 
lower cost,” Holcomb said.
The biggest issue students seem to 
have with SNAP is the wait time.“Sometimes it takes them a while, 
so in some cases my friends and I have decided to walk instead of waiting,” said UF freshman Nicole Thommes.
The new system will give callers an 
estimated wait time, Holcomb said.
“If the van’s coming to pick you 
up, the system will call you back on the phone you called in on, letting you know that ride’s coming,” he said.
At some point, they might be able 
to make it so that students can locate SNAP vans like they can with Regional Transit System buses, he said. Kaitlin Buickel, a SNAP driver, said that de-pending on the night, students might 
have to wait from about 10 minutes 
to 40 minutes. The system will allow people to know when their van is close or on the way, she said.SNAP updates system

Israel is using green technology to 
help itself both economically and diplo-
matically, an Israeli official said at the Re-itz Student Union on Thursday night.  
Deputy Consul General of the Israeli Consul-
ate General to Florida and Puerto Rico Paul 
Hirschson spoke Thursday in the Matthews Suite at the Reitz  as part of “Israel Goes Green: Israeli Leadership in Green Technology .”  
He discussed various environmental ad-
vances Israel has made in recent years in sus-tainability and other environmental challenges facing the country.
The event was sponsored by Gators for Is-
rael and several other student organizations including Gators for a Sustainable Campus, the Jewish Agency for Israel and the Geogra-phy Club.
Rafael Yaniz, the president of Gators for Is-
rael, said Hirschson decided to make the trip to UF after Israeli Consul General Ofer Bavly encouraged him to do so.  
“When we saw Hirschson’s background was in the high-tech sector, we decided to have 
him speak on Israeli environmental develop-
ments,” Yaniz said. 
One of the sustainability practices Hirsch-
son  spoke about was water reclamation, or water recycling.  Hirschson said Israel is utiliz-ing the process to a much greater extent than any other country in the world.
He said the process in its simplest terms 
entails collecting the wastewater rather than 
letting it soak into the ground.  The reclaimed water can be used for several purposes, including replenishing bodies of water and 
drip irrigation.
Jamie Schindewolf, the president of Gators 
for a Sustainable Campus, said if America adopts some of the same practices that are prevalent in Israel, it would see great progress 
in sustainability.
“We have a history of water problems in 
Florida, and it would be great if we could work 
towards a water structure like Israel’s,” Schin-dewolf said.  “They have grabbed an oppor -
tunity and ran with it, and that is a model we should work toward.”Israeli official speaks at UFCAMPUS SAFETY

Today’s question: Could a 12-year-old spelling bee champion outspell you?
106 TOTAL VOTES44% YES56% NOThursday’s question: Is 100 flavors of soda in one machine excessive?Obama selling image through address
So, who watched the State of the Union show this week? Did anyone really think that Snooki would actually lay off the booze?
Oops, my bad, that was “Jersey Shore.” It’s easy to get 
all these pop culture phenomena confused.
And confused is exactly what President Obama once 
again proved himself to be Tuesday night during his sec-ond State of the Union address. He ascended to the presi-dency in 2008 not with his policy stances but with his im-age. Not with his qualifications but with the brand name of Barack Obama. With charming charisma and vague no-
tions of hope and change, he transformed himself into a 
pop culture icon who took the nation by storm.
However, the electorate lost its hope once it saw the 
change — change that ushered in a larger and increasingly 
intrusive government. This led to the massive defeat of the 
Democrats we witnessed in November.
On Tuesday night, we again caught a glimpse of the 
populist image that President Obama so successfully pre-
sented during his campaign. On the heels of November’s stinging results, he attempted to shift to the center in the perception of the American public. Although the speech had leftist agenda items liberally scattered throughout, Obama inserted key words and phrases that made him sound patriotic, open-minded and even conservative at times.
Apparently taking cues from his perception of the elec-
torate’s concerns, he said that we need to eliminate the deficit. We need to secure our borders and enforce our laws. We need to strengthen our relationships with allies and get tough on terrorism. We need to cut the corporate tax rates and reform the tax code.
Yet among the populist rhetoric was one glaring omis -
sion. The issues he did tackle all were, to some extent, on the minds of the voters last fall; but the election as a whole was a refer -
endum on big government. Intru-sive, domineering, out-of-control, Big Brother government.
The American people do not 
want to be told what kinds of light-bulbs we can buy. We do not want to be told which cars we can or can-
not drive. We do not want the Internet regulated, and we do not want to be patted down at airports.
President Obama did nothing to assure the American 
people that government was going to scale back on its in-trusion and control in the lives of the average citizen. On the contrary, his speech was full of proposals to increase the size of government beyond the point to which he now 
has brought it.
His proposals to steer the free market with research 
incentives, control the prices within the medical field, in-
troduce new “safeguards” to protect the American citizen, and regulate the insurance industry doomed his speech as an attempt to demonstrate a centrist (or even populist) mentality.
With this speech, President Obama has reinforced what 
we already knew — the Democratic Party is the party of big government. It is now up to the Republicans to help the Democrats maintain ownership of this agenda. Despite President Obama’s call for bipartisan support of his pro-posals, the electorate will remember, come next election, any Republican who was involved in efforts to increase government intrusion. Any notion to the contrary is about as realistic as what is depicted on “Jersey Shore.”

You may not realize it, but Student Government slating 
starts today. That’s right, our semiannual circus is back in 
town, ready to pitch its tents and set up the same old plat-
forms.
As we reflect upon our experiences with SG, we present 
you with the somehow-we’re-not-excited-to-watch-the-
same-election-play-out-every-year edition of...
Darts & Laurels
If the election isn’t in full swing, the bickering and 
name-calling sure is. 
Maybe we’re deluded to think tomorrow’s politicians 
will pride themselves on civility, but after receiving some obviously untrue letters to the editor, we’ve decided our publication won’t become a forum for insults and lies this semester. 
So we’re chucking a how-about-criticizing-your-oppo-
nents’-platforms-instead-of-calling-them-names DART to 
SG zealots.
Take a deep breath and step away from the libel.Heck, even Congress took a minute to stop its bickering 
for the State of the Union address. 
Political rivals sat together, giving the appearance — 
however feigned — that the country can still unite beyond party lines. 
For that hour of forced smiles and intense clapping, 
we’re giving we-wanted-to-spray-paint-them-red-and-blue-but-that-would-defeat-the-purpose LAURELS to Re-
publicans and Democrats for being a civil and respectful audience. 
Their attitude beats the discourtesy and outbursts the 
nation witnessed during last year’s speech. 
While we’re at it, we’re also giving a we-don’t-buy-all-
of-your-talking-points-but-we-like-the-way-you’re-think-
ing LAUREL to President Obama for using a conciliatory 
tone that’s been missing from Washington for a while.
Though we doubt the president’s goals will all be ful-
filled, we’ve got a success story on our hands at UF. 
For setting a noble goal, meeting it, then promising 
to do even more for the downtrodden, we’re throwing a 
way-to-show-The-Gator-Nation-is-indeed-everywhere LAUREL to Gators United for Haiti. 
The group surpassed its $50,000 goal and is aiming 
higher to help victims of the 2010 earthquake, and every-one can respect their commitment.
But enough with the niceties. We’ve got a grudge to handle.Imagine you’re without power for hours, sitting inside 
on a rainy day without the ability to check your email or type up a document. 
Imagine you’re also putting together a newspaper in an 
office, and you’ve got a deadline to meet. 
Now you’ve got a pretty accurate picture of what hap-
pened to us Tuesday night.
For helping us bring our electricity bill down in the 
most undesirable way and giving some of us a crazy story to tell at job interviews, we’re launching a you-must-have-
forgetten-to-check-your-calendar-because-it’s-not-hurri -
cane-season-yet DART to the weather.
That said, at the risk of looking as arrogant as Napo-
leon crowning himself, we’re awarding our newsroom a 
you’re-welcome-for-turning-out-a-paper-under-apoca-
lyptic-conditions LAUREL. 
Honestly, we think we deserve a pat on the back for 
that one.
Until next week, Gators, play nice.

and 8:53 a.m., there was just an eerie calm. When I look back on it, I want to say I 
knew. I knew that those voices yelling outside were firemen’s, and my building was on fire; 
I knew that I grabbed all my belongings, in-
cluding my cat, and heroically ran outside to help. It didn’t happen like that.
I was wearing sweatpants and a T-shirt 
when my eyes opened. I looked at my watch to see how much longer I could sleep in. I noticed the frantic noise outside, but it didn’t register. I opened my bedroom door and called for Mitch, my cat. He usually comes 
running. He didn’t. That was weird.
I walked to the bathroom, directly across 
from the front door. I used the restroom in my 
apartment for the last time. I got two steps from the door when I heard the yelling (first) and the pounding (second).
“Fire Department! Get out, now! Fire! 
Now!”
Still didn’t register. I was half-asleep. There 
was no time to think — I went into autopilot and fumbled with the door lock. I felt like he would kick down the door for sure.
“OK, OK I’m coming; it’s OK I’m going to 
open it.”
At this point it’s like being thrown into 
a pool from behind with no warning while wearing a tuxedo and holding a martini glass.
“There’s a fire; I 
need you out! Out! Now! Go!”
“Can I get some shoes? I have a cat in there 
too! Can I get my cat?”
“No! Out! Go! Out! Now! Move it!”This was Monday morning — it’s about 
20 below zero. I moved to New Hampshire to work at the Valley News from Florida. I’ve been here three weeks. Now I’m standing barefoot on my porch, and to my right, flames are licking a slatted door that leads to the 
basement. My landlord, Paul Adley , is nearby 
and firefighters are running around but not yet fighting the blaze. It takes two seconds to start shivering uncontrollably. I couldn’t go anywhere on account of the barefoot thing. And I couldn’t make sense of it.
My apartment was behind me and I saw 
Adley’s van in front of me next to a fire truck, a few feet away.
I was told to get into the back of Adley’s 
van. I had to jump quick across the snow. There was nowhere to sit; it was full of tools 
and boxes. I had to maneuver on top of two of 
them and pull my feet up to my chest to have room. The windows were open and I was shaking, hard. Adley got in the front seat.
“My cat is in there. Could you go tell them 
my cat is in there?” I said.
Adley got out of the car and told the fire-
men that there were cats inside. They told him to get back into the car and move his vehicle 
up the street. When he got back in, I told him 
I was (expletive) freezing and could he please close the window.
“How did this happen?” I asked.Adley is an older man, grandfatherly , with 
a thick New England accent.
“I did it,” he said.
“Wait. You started this fire?”
“I was thawing a pipe with a propane 
blowtorch. It caught fire and when I went to use the hose it was just a block of ice. I should’ve checked it first.” 
He handed me two winter hats to put over 
my feet. He gave me his jacket. We were sit-ting in the car across the street watching ev-erything I owned smoke and burn and sizzle.
He hadn’t called his wife yet. I think he 
was putting it off, but I needed shoes, bad. He took a breath before he did. On the phone he sounded old and broken.
“I was thawing a pipe…”He kept repeat-
ing that phrase.
He drove me to his house and gave me a 
pair of socks, some brown, faded Rockport dressing shoes and a feminine white sweater. 
I thanked him. When we drove back he asked 
a cop about the cats. He said they’d keep an eye out. The Adleys got me into another place 
that night. I don’t own much, but I’m alive, 
and the city has been exceptionally kind to me. This evening, I heard my cat is alive. A neighbor had found him wandering around — a nomad cat wearing a Florida tag.
I’ve learned that life is sometimes sharp 
but people are kind, and they can dull the rough edges. In quiet, lonely moments I’m sad, but I’m alive and I’m blessed.

Speaking OutCorporate model a detriment 
to academia
I read with dismay the article 
“Students band together to save professor’s job” in your Jan. 25 is-sue. I do not know lecturer David 
Small, who, after 11 years, is being 
unaccountably dismissed from his 
post in UF’s department of com -
puter and information science and 
engineering. Evidence suggests 
he is an excellent educator who is 
much appreciated by his students. 
Such stories have become com -
mon in higher education, which 
has widely embraced an amoral 
corporate management model that 
shamelessly exploits a growing 
underclass of academic “temps” 
receiving negligible benefits and protections. My respect for UF is 
greatly diminished by such deci-
sions. Others contemplating aca-
demic careers are advised to think 
twice about stepping on the temp treadmill. It typically ends badly 
for teachers and hurts students 
seeking references after a favorite 
professor has mysteriously disap-
peared from the faculty.

UF GYMNASTICS
  By ALLISON BANKO
 Alligator Writer
   
 Looking through rose-colored 
glasses can turn a routine gymnas-
tics meet into something bigger. 
  Tonight, the Gators will trans-
form their rosy vision into a heart-warming reality.   
  When the Florida gymnastics 
squad takes on No. 13 North Caro-lina State and No. 23 Penn State in its annual Link to Pink meet at 7 p.m., typical splashes of orange and blue will be swapped for pink to raise awareness for the ﬁ  ght against breast cancer.  
  The entire competition is dedi-
cated to ﬁ  ghting the illness, and survivors will be honored and the 
crowd is encouraged to join the 
Gators as they go pretty in pink for 
the cause. 
  Gators coach Rhonda Faehn 
said the effort is special to the col-
lege gymnastics community , as the 
NCAA designated one home “Pink” 
meet for each college that carried a gymnastics squad after one of its own became a victim in 2003. 
  Faehn said that Talya Vexler, a 
23-year-old gymnast at the Univer-sity of Georgia, was diagnosed with breast cancer during her last year of eligibility . 
Since then, the college gymnas-
tics realm decid-
ed to do its part to 
raise awareness. 
  “It really 
has taken on a 
life of its own,” 
Faehn said. “We 
felt that, being a women’s sport, we really should 
take responsibility for our places in 
the community and things that we can do as a program to be able to 
raise awareness for the ﬁ  ght against breast cancer.” 
  V exler is a survivor, and now an 
assistant coach for the University of 
Iowa gymnastics team. 
  But the disease’s impact hasn’t 
slowed down, even touching two 
current Gators gymnasts’ lives. 
  Senior Alicia Goodwin’s aunt 
and freshman Mackenzie Caquat-to’s grandmother have both been successful in defeating the disease. 
  “It really hits home,” Goodwin 
said. “Breast cancer affects so many 
people and families. Personally having someone in my family who 
went through that, and even still today, there’s always the chance it could come back.”
  Caquatto said she told her grand-
mother over the phone she would be wearing pink for her tonight. 
  She said the older gymnasts told 
her the crowd that shows up in sup-
port of the meet is amazing. Last 
year, the meet pulled in an audience 
of more than 9,000 — the Gators’ third highest gymnastics attendance in history.
  “They told me that you look up 
and it’s a sea of pink,” she said.  Gators to promote breast cancer awareness with meet

 FLORIDA WILL FACE NO. 7 
TENNESSEE ON SATURDAY. 
  By JOHN BOOTHE
 Alligator Writer
   
 For the past ﬁ  ve years, there has been 
one constant on coach Gregg Troy’s team: 
at least one Fraser brother in the water.
  Saturday marks the ceremonial end to 
Brett and Shaune Fraser’s record-setting run at UF. The two Cayman Island Olym-pians have combined for 40 All-American accolades during their collegiate careers, 
making them two of the most proliﬁ  c sib-
ling swimmers Troy can remember.   Shaune, who graduated from Florida 
last year, will be in Gainesville with his parents to see Brett, a senior, and 13 other swimmers and divers compete in their last dual meet at the O’Connell Center Natato-
rium on Senior Day against No. 7 Tennes-
see at noon.
  “They’re highly dependable; they 
weren’t erratic very much,” Troy said of 
the Frasers. “You could always count on 
them in dual meets cause they’re good rac-ers and tremendous relay swimmers, so it does make a little of a void.”
  Replacing the last of the brothers looks 
even more daunting with 12 additional seniors heading toward the end of their stint on the No. 5 men’s side. Four of the Gators’ top ﬁ  ve race winners this season are seniors, including Conor Dwyer, the 2010 NCAA Swimmer of the Year. 
  The lone senior on the No. 8 women’s 
team is diver Monica Dodson.
  Troy thinks he might 
get the best effort from 
those seniors who have 
fewer accolades and 
more to swim for in their last several op-portunities competitively racing in the pool.
  “There’s a couple where this will be 
their last dual meet — might even be their last meet,” he said. “Some of them might not make the conference meet.” 
  After losing to Auburn last week, when 
the Tigers’ seniors were honored, the Gators know how the pageantry and sen-timent of the day can swing in the home team’s favor. Florida’s men’s and women’s 
teams haven’t lost a meet on Senior Day in 
seven years.
  Before the meet, the athletes have a 
team dinner with their parents and family 
as guests. Troy said most of them get up 
and say a few words.
  “It’s a little more emotional, and there’s 
a little more sense of importance for some of them,” he said.  Fraser family dynasty to reach its end on Senior Day

QUOTABLE BLAKELY UNDERGOES SURGERY ONLINE INSIDESaj Guevara  / Alligator Staff
Florida point guard Lanita Bartley helped key an 11-2 Gators run 
to lift UF to a 70-64 home win over Alabama on Thursday night.
Twenty years ago, I darted down a Dublin 
hospital corridor.  
I spotted three Irish nurses sharing a 
smoke. I glanced again at the paper with my cousin’s room number and asked for direc-
tions.
One green-eyed colleen exhaled smoke 
from her cig and pointed her finger toward a 
long hallway.
The trio stood under a “no smoking” sign. I 
laughed and said, “Wow, no smoking in hospi-tals any more, huh?”
Bridget took another drag and said, “Yeah, 
it’s awful really, a real nuisance. Next, they’ll 
be forbidding it in pubs.” 
The curly-haired blonde nurse laughed and 
said, “Talk sense, Bridget, talk sense.”
Back then, most Irish shared her sentiment, 
including law enforcement, who often flouted 
and rarely enforced the smoking law.
A similar attitude toward gambling laws 
prevails in the United States. We must seem schizophrenic to foreigners. 
Gambling is mostly illegal, but there’s a 
lotto in every state and all kinds of gambling 
in Las V egas, Reno and Atlantic City . Most good-sized towns have off-track betting. 
Churches decry gam-
blers as being of weak character yet sponsor 
raffles and weekly bin-
go. 
Gambling is “bad,” 
but getting a box in a Super Bowl pool is an American tradition. Of-
fice workers, policemen, stockbrokers, doctors, teachers, priests — everyone wants a box. 
Americans follow Super Bowl lines closer 
than presidential elections. Super Sunday cre-ates a commercial payday for bars, beer dis-tributors and supermarkets.
Bookies fear that miserable day . All the action rests on one game. V olume 
can’t compensate for the edge bookmakers 
have when a full schedule overloads wagers 
on five games. 
On Super Bowl Sunday , old-school bookies 
juggle the lines to balance money, but our big-gest fear was getting busted. On Super Sunday , we wrote four times the number of our usual slips. One regular customer in a bar might call in bets for 12 friends.
No other day generates more action, and 
cops are hungry for the big bust ... and the big headlines.
Law enforcers crave publicity. District attor -
neys, police captains and others want the pub-Nothing worse

When the clock struck zero on the Florida wom-
en’s basketball team’s first win in almost three 
weeks, point guard Lanita Bartley tossed the ball 
skyward in a moment of jubilation.
While Bartley’s display is one usually reserved 
for championship festivities, Florida had plenty rea-son to celebrate. After dropping games they were in 
position to win against Kentucky and Georgia, the 
Gators (13-9, 3-5 Southeastern Conference) were fi-nally able to close out an opponent. 
 “Our team was really emotional,” Bartley said 
of her postgame excitement. “I was just happy that we won, bounced back and put (those) other games in the past.”
Bartley’s aggressiveness keyed an 11-2 UF run to 
start the second half that helped propel the Gators to 
a 70-64 win over Alabama (11-10, 0-8 SEC) Thursday 
night in the O’Connell Center. 
But, like most Florida games this season, it wasn’t 
pretty. 
UF hit just four of its first 20 looks from the field 
and seemed content to chuck it up from long range early on. And after turning it over only five times in the first 15:14, Florida had three miscues in the final five minutes of the first half that led directly to six 
Alabama points. 
“We’re not afraid of ugly,” coach Amanda Butler 
said. “We just want the result. … When we’re play-
ing our best, it’s not free-flowing and this pristine 
image of basketball.”
Florida was down by five midway through the 
first half then rallied with 22 points in the next 10 Gators secure close win, halt skid
UF FOOTBALL

Florida coach Will Muschamp chose 
to retain Stan Drayton as the running 
backs coach on his revamped staff, but Drayton didn’t stick with the Gators for long.
Drayton, who is also UF’s recruit-
ing coordinator, officially accepted the wide receivers coaching job at Ohio State, the Buckeyes announced Thurs-day.
The timing of Drayton’s departure 
is certainly not ideal for UF, as Na-tional Signing Day is Feb. 2, one day after Drayton starts with the Buckeyes. Muschamp will now have to fill the role of running backs coach and select a new recruiting coordinator. 
“Our focus will always be on the 
staff that are here, our current players 
and the prospective student-athletes we 
are recruiting,” Mus-champ said regard-ing the move, with no mention of Drayton.
A native of Cleve-
land who grew up an Ohio State fan, Dray-
ton has had a rocky history with the Gators. He served as Florida’s running 
backs coach from 2005 to 2007 and took the same position at Tennessee in 2008 
after being fired by Urban Meyer.
Following a one-year stint with 
Syracuse, Drayton returned to UF last season and became one of three Meyer 
assistants, along with D.J. Durkin and 
Brian White, to remain on Muschamp’s staff.
“Stan Drayton first and foremost is 
a fine person and family man. He is a Buckeye born and bred and will add a tremendous dimension to our football family,” Ohio State coach Jim Tressel said in a statement. “We are fortunate to gain one of the finest coaches in America to serve our kids, school and 
community.”

UF TRACK AND FIELD

Alligator Writer
 
The Gators will head to Col-
lege Station for the Texas A&M 
Challenge, a Big 12/Southeastern 
Conference meet, today and Sat-urday.
The eight-school affair will 
feature six top-25 schools on the 
men’s side and four on the wom-
en’s side.
However, the only perfor -
mances that will concern Florida 
coach Mike Holloway this week-
end will be by those wearing or -
ange and blue.
“The big thing for us is just 
trying to put our athletes in a 
position to get better,” Holloway 
said. “I haven’t really paid atten-tion to the format. 
“I just look at the events and 
see where I can put my athletes and help us get better so we can be ready for the conference and national meets.”
While Holloway said he will 
keep an eye on the scoreboard, he won’t get too caught up in which team wins the early meets.
The men’s team, ranked No. 
1 in the preseason, fell to No. 2 this week. The women’s squad remains unranked.
“I know they’re keeping score, 
but the only two scored meets we 
worry about are the conference 
and national meets,” Holloway said. “So, if the Big 12 wins the meet this weekend, then kudos to 
them.”UF focused on itself
minutes and trailed by only two at the break.
The Gators came out fast in the second 
and established a seven-point lead. Then, the turnovers started to come in bunches, and it 
appeared Florida was ready to hand another game away. 
Eight turnovers in a five-minute span cut 
the lead to one with less than 11 minutes to go, but Butler said she wasn’t worried about another collapse. 
“We talked very honestly about that after 
the Kentucky game,” Butler said. “Tonight, 
we were playing to win. We weren’t playing 
to not turn the ball over; we were playing to make the play.”
Florida had zero turnovers in the final five minutes and connected on 9 of 9 from the charity stripe to put the game away.
Forward Jennifer George and guard Jaterra 
Bonds tied for the team-high with 12 points.
Bartley — who also added five assists, four 
rebounds and three steals — and forward 
Ndidi Madu were both one 
shy of double-digits with 
nine points.  
Junior guard Deana Al-
len, the team’s leading scor -
er in conference play, also 
dropped nine while grab-
bing seven rebounds.
“I felt relieved once we got the win, so we 
can put that losing streak behind us,” Allen 
said. “Not one time did we give up. … This is the start of a winning streak for us now.”Florida turnover-free in final five minutes

lic to know the lengths they go to protect their 
citizens — nice on promotion or re-election résumés also. 
So, on Super Sundays, cops love to break 
down doors and haul off the ticket writers who 
only give the public the action they crave.
After cops seize betting slips, they add up 
the amount of action then multiply the total by 
365. Then they release statements such as the following: 
“The district attorney’s office has just shut 
down an illegal $12 million gambling opera-tion.”   
Everybody takes a bow. Great story for the 
local paper, job well done by the D.A., citizens feel relief.
Meanwhile, the bookie is shell-shocked. He 
couldn’t write $12 million worth of action if he had 40 clerks, a printing press and operated out of a warehouse. 
Here’s how our operation out-slicked the 
local gendarmes.
My partner “Blinky” was fierce smart, a master of organization. When we first set up 
shop, he insisted we rent an apartment in the 
most drug-ridden, crime-infested section of the Bronx — two blocks from where I lived. 
We threw the superintendent $500, so no 
names were exchanged. The apartment’s rent was cheap, and the cops were busy with stab-bings, shootings and drugs. No time for us.
The apartment was a five-floor walk-up 
in a dingy tenement. We “decorated” accord-
ingly.
The living room had two old couches and a 
cheap television. In the bedroom, opposite the 
bed, sat two folding tables. Above those tables hung a wall-sized whiteboard and a clock. Sit-ting on the tables were four rollover phones and a tape recorder.
Rollover phones were necessary. We sup-
plied our customers with an 800 number. The 
number was free, Blinky’s idea — anything to 
make access easier. If one phone was busy , the call rolled over to the next. Most Sundays, all four phones rang off the hook.
Each call was written on a different betting 
slip. The slips were 3-by-3 duplicate forms.  Later, they were torn and given to my part-ner and I to take home to calculate. Separate 
locations insured “the work” was accurate. If 
mistakes were made in the player’s favor, the bettor wouldn’t say shit.
Any discrepancies my partner and I had 
were rechecked before Monday night’s action. Monday night, we’d tell the caller his weekly figure.
Any discrepancies the players brought up, 
we’d say , “Call back after the game starts and 
we’ll go over the work.” 
Nine times out of 10, the players were 
wrong. If a bettor insisted he didn’t make the 
bet, we played him back the tape. Once the “figures” were correct, the hard part came — collecting.
As Super Bowl uneasiness approached, 
Blinky got a brainstorm. Let’s rent the apart-ment directly across the hall. Move our “fur -
niture” there and leave one phone on the floor of the empty apartment. Then have the aban-doned phone’s number call-forwarded to cell phones across the hall. 
San Francisco played Denver. The action 
poured in. Two hours before game time, a loud pounding started. It sounded like an oil drill. 
“Bam, bam, bam” rang throughout the 
building. “Red” sprang from his chair to the door’s peephole. He turned quick, holding his index finger to his lips. Blinky and I yanked the phones off the hook.
Red spied through the peephole at our old 
“office.” The twin locks gave way and six cops exploded into the empty apartment. Then, the expletives started. 
The language the frustrated cops yelled 
was louder than the break-in. Stunned, I stared at Blinky the way a cow looks at a meadow: wide-eyed.  
We won our battle two hours before kickoff. 
Shaking like the Olsen twins at a spelling bee, Red and I voted Blinky our MVP . We hoisted his trophy, a bottle of Rémy Martin, and con-tinued to lift it again and again and again.

UF MEN’S BASKEtBAll

Alligator Staff Writer

Once the Gators leave Gainesville, 
their entire focus changes. 
Everything becomes simplified as 
the distractions of a spirited college 
town are left behind, and the team directs all its attention toward bas-
ketball. 
This shift has vaulted Florida (16-
4, 5-1 Southeastern Conference) to a 
7-1 record away from home, a mark it will look to improve upon as it 
travels to Starkville to face Missis-
sippi State (10-9, 2-3 SEC) on Satur -
day at 1 p.m.
“When we’re on the road, we’re 
focused,” senior forward Chandler Parsons said. “There’s a pattern to what we do.”
Last season, the Gators struggled 
when they had to play on the road, 
going just 8-9 in games away from 
the O’Connell Center. 
Florida entered many of those 
contests lacking effort and focus, 
something that has not been a prob-
lem this season. 
“On the road, it’s a lot easier to narrow your focus,” coach Billy Donovan said. “Because you’re out of town, because you’re in a hotel, you’re totally focused as a group. There’s a lot of unity and together -
ness there.”
The Gators also attribute their 
road success to maturity. The current starting five has been together for 
more than a season and a half, and 
with every game, their understand-ing of how to handle the hostile envi-ronments improves.  
“As a group, we weren’t connect-
ed as a team as we are now,” junior guard Erving Walker said. “I feel like we grew up, and now we understand what it takes to win on the road.”
With each passing contest, Flori-
da’s starters become more desensi-tized to the mocking trash talk row-dy SEC fans hurl their way. 
“It’s ridiculous,” Parsons said. 
“They say some things that are out of this world. Being a senior, I think it’s kind of funny what they say, but I can’t imagine being 18 years old and 
going in there.”
While road crowds present an 
entirely different environment, the differences leading up to the game 
affect UF the most. 
Playing in an unfamiliar city 
forces the team into a regimented schedule featuring a night at a ho-
tel, a pregame meal, film sessions, a 
shootaround and little else. 
Games in Gainesville are much 
easier and more relaxed, according 
to Walker.
Donovan feels the pregame ritual 
of road contests forces his team to 
avoid distractions and have a greater focus on the game. 
For this reason, the coach opted 
to have his players spend the night in a hotel before their blowout win over Arkansas last Saturday in 
Gainesville. 
With his team in one location, Don-
ovan was able to host film sessions 
Friday night and Saturday morning, which would have been difficult un-
der normal circumstances. 
“If we practice on Friday and then 
all of a sudden you go back to the

gy,” he said. “One of our goals this season is to advance to the Indoor Championships in Seattle, and we have to beat Santa Barbara to get there.”
The Gators will be led by senior 
Alexandre Lacroix, who is ranked No. 4 in the ITA’s singles rankings, and No. 28 Sekou Bangoura Jr.
Also emerging for the Gators is 
freshman Andrew Butz, who was named the Southeastern Confer -
ence Freshman of the Week on Wednesday. 
“Andrew had his first taste of 
success at this level, so now his 
challenge is to back it up,” Jack-
son said.

State (2-2) will play at 1 p.m.
