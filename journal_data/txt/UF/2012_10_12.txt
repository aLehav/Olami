Gainesville residents Jessica Canterbury, 24, left, and Shane Russell, 24, right, participate in a candlelight vigil 
for missing UF student Christian Aguilar on the corner of Southwest 13th Street and West University Avenue. Aguilar went missing on Sept. 20, and numerous police and volunteer led searches have turned up nothing.

As early evening trafﬁ  c bustled 
through the intersection of South-
west 13th Street and University Avenue on Thursday night, doz-ens of ﬂ  ickering candles illumi-nated the northeast corner of UF’s campus.
About 30 people, most of whom 
had never met 
Christian Agui-lar, crowded around a make-shift memorial. Two banners, each featuring a picture of him smiling, hung on 
a brick wall.
The Rev. William H. Russell Jr., 
from the United New Testament Church International, initiated the evening vigil with a prayer.
Despite the trafﬁ  c making him 
hard to hear, people packed tightly around Russell, 51, to listen as he spoke about Aguilar, the 18-year-old UF freshman who went miss-ing Sept. 20.
Russell said he has never met 
Aguilar, but from what friends and family have told him about the for-mer Miami resident, he described Aguilar as someone “I would have been proud to have known.”
Russell’s brief speech centered 
around a common theme: instill-ing hope of ﬁ  nding Aguilar.
“Chris has not been forgot-
ten,” Russell said. “Chris will be found.”
But at this point, nearly a month 
after Aguilar went missing, police and many volunteers have shifted their focus to recovering his body.
Pedro Bravo, an 18-year-old 
Santa Fe College student, was recently indicted by an Alachua County grand jury on murder and kidnapping charges. He remains in the Alachua County Jail.

Lauren Munsey wrote “Love is Love!!” in 
black marker on a door Thursday. She’s het-
erosexual, but her sister is gay.
“Straight against hate,” the 19-year-old 
public relations junior said.
Munsey was one of about 120 people who 
participated in a UF- and Pride Student Union-sponsored National Coming Out Day event on the Plaza of the Americas.
People could write on a white door or take a 
picture in front of it with a sign declaring their sexual orientation or gender identity. Organiz-ers had pre-printed signs, but in order to create an inclusive environment, they also gave the attendees the option of writing in their own identities, said event director Shawn Janetzke.
Sexual orientation is typically deﬁ  ned as 
what characteristics someone is sexually or romantically attracted to, and gender identity refers to how people view their own gender.National Coming Out Day started in 1988, 
and it is always held on the anniversary of the National March on Washington for Les-bian and Gay Rights, according to the Human Rights Campaign website.
This is the ﬁ  rst year at UF that students 
were able to sign a door to emphasize they are “coming out of the closet,” Janetzke said.
The 19-year-old criminology and psychol-
ogy sophomore came up with the idea of hav-ing people sign the door after seeing it online. He said he wanted something visual and con-crete.
Andrew Garcia, Pride’s internal vice presi-
dent, said the day is about people ﬁ  rmly es-tablishing that they are out and proud. The 18-year-old art history, Eastern and Central European studies, and sociology sophomore said it’s also about showing those who might not be out yet that they have a community that supports them. 
He said he came out as gay two years ago.Students celebrate National

Artists and art lovers alike will 
ﬂ  ock to Gainesville this weekend for 
the city’s 31st annual Downtown Fes-tival & Art Show.
The festival, which will be from 10 
a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday, is among the most popular city-hosted events and is expected to draw about 100,000 people, said Linda Piper, city events coordinator.
“This is something that is highly 
anticipated each year,” Piper said.
To kick off the two-day festival, the 
city will host a concert at 8 p.m. today on Bo Diddley Community Plaza.
Gainesville’s annual arts festival is 
Florida’s third-best art festival based on art sales, Piper said. 
She said the festival is also ranked 
as the 13th-best ﬁ  ne arts show in the country.About 600 artists apply to be a part 
of the festival, and less than half are selected, Piper said.
“We end up with 250 of the na-
tion’s best artists,” she said.
Artists will be showcasing their 
work, including photography, paint-ings and jewelry.
“Nothing can be better than the 
Downtown Arts Festival to do just that,” she said.
The event will extend from the 
Hippodrome State Theatre to City Hall. There will be three stages for live performances, including a blues concert starting at 7 p.m. Saturday.
“This festival started out very 
small and just got bigger and bigger each year and has brought the com-munity together,” Piper said. “Now it’s like throwing a party for 100,000 of your closest friends.”Annual art festival returns

to the Aguilar family —  her 19-year-old son attends 
college in Oklahoma.
Joyner said she doesn’t usually follow missing 
person stories, but the Aguilar case was different. 
“This one really spoke to me personally,” she 
said.
The search party has a Facebook group — now 
about 14,000 members strong — and with each old picture of Aguilar they post, his personality seems to shine through the screen, touching people like 28-year-old Alisha King.
“You feel like you missed out on somebody be-
cause he was someone who you really wanted to know,” she said.
The vigil was one of three simultaneous gather-
ings scheduled for Thursday. 
Angela LaPiana, a 19-year-old political science 
senior, said about 200 people attended the vigil in Doral. A third was held with Aguilar’s extended family in Cali, Colombia.
Back in Gainesville, a supporter taped an Iron 
Man picture onto the wall, a tribute to Aguilar’s fa-vorite superhero, LaPiana said.
“He’s been able to touch so many lives,” she said. 
“He’s not a superhero, but a super human being.”

Bobby Brito signed “5 years out

“It’s a huge weight lifted off your 
shoulders,” he said.
Jessie Pincus, who is the director 
of Pride Awareness Month, said the day is about awareness.
“It’s not necessarily a day to come 
out, but celebrating those who have come out and those who will come out, and our allies that support us,” said the 22-year-old advertising se-nior.
Pincus came out freshman year 
but said she was nervous because she is a member of Alpha Epsilon Phi so-rority.
“But everybody responded posi-
tively,” she said.

Feeling the moon’s gravitational 
pull or bonds between water mol-
ecules is now within grasp — liter -
ally.
By combining haptics and nano-
technology, the Digital Worlds In-stitute in collaboration with Curtis Taylor, a UF professor of mechani-cal and aerospace engineering and a nanotechnology expert, has made it possible for people to feel these reactions.
The project, called HAPNAN, 
was showcased Thursday night at the Harn Museum’s “Art in Engi-neering” event.
Haptics refers to the ability to 
feel a force or texture in a virtual environment, according to an email from James Oliverio, director of the Digital Worlds Institute. Nanotech-nology refers to research, develop-ment and manufacturing activity with matter and processes that are too small for the eye to see, he said.
Oliverio said he, Taylor and 
Digital Worlds’ graduate students worked on the project and hope to use the technology to enhance learn-ing in middle school classrooms.
Oliverio likened HAPNAN to a 
“serious video game.” For example, students can use the mouse to pull a cowbell-shaped object off the moon’s surface and then pull the same object off the Earth’s surface, in order to compare the planets’ gravitational pulls.
Patrick Terry, a 20-year-old ma-
terials science and engineering ju-nior, said he thinks the technology has potential to help students make sense of ideas he learned from text-books.
“Trying to find a new way to 
get people to understand things is always great,” Terry said. “I can imagine that it definitely has poten-tial to be a helpful medium to learn those concepts.”
Oliverio said the project will 
initially be implemented in local schools, but because the National Science Foundation funded the prototype development, HAPNAN should eventually make a national impact.
“Humans can often learn more 
in a multimodal context than a sin-gle mode like reading alone,” Oli-verio said. “When more than one sense is involved in the acquisition of knowledge, we can learn more deeply.”

Shands at UF will hold its first Pink 
Pumpkin Fest — an event that includes 
the Pink Pumpkin Pedal-Off, the Pink Pumpkin Painting Party and other fes-tivities — Saturday on the lawn of the Cancer Genetics Research Complex, at the corner of Archer Road and Gale Le-merand Drive.
Proceeds will benefit the Shands at 
UF Triple Negative Breast Cancer Re-search Fund.
“When you think of the homegrown 
movement, buy local movement, this is a great extension of that,” said Lindy Brounley, the event coordinator and communications director for the UF Shands Cancer Center.
Last year, the Pink Pumpkin Paint-
ing Party attracted 500 people, and there was one table setup for the event. This year, more than 1,000 people are expected to attend, and there will be 17 exhibits, Brounley said. Breast, cervical and ovarian cancer screenings will be available at the Florida Department of Health exhibit.
The purpose is to raise awareness 
about early detection of breast cancer through mammography and once-a-month self-breast exams, Brounley said.
The American Cancer Society esti-
mates one in eight women will receive a diagnosis of breast cancer in her lifetime, and each year about 40,000 women die from it, according to its website. 
An estimated 30 percent of these 
deaths could be prevented if women older than 50 received annual mammo-grams, Brounley said.
Lizzy Jenkins, an 18-year-old health 
science freshman, said she was inter -
ested in participating in the Pedal-Off. She used to do charity events in high school.

A Gainesville man connected to 
a rape earlier this week was arrested 
Wednesday night.
Gainesville Police arrested John 
Henry Boyd III, 32, on sexual assault and robbery charges, according a GPD arrest report.
GPD spokesman Ben Tobias, Sgt. 
John Nabet and the arrest report gave the following account:
At about 7 p.m. Tuesday , Boyd 
and a 36-year-old woman were drinking beer together in the woods behind the Elk’s Lodge building in the 500 block of Southwest Fourth Avenue.
The two are acquaintances and 
have been known to drink together.
Boyd gave the woman a pill and 
told her to swallow it with her drink. After hanging out for a while, Boyd wanted to have sex with the woman. She refused.
Boyd punched the woman in the 
face, knocking her onto the ground. He then raped her in the woods.
When GPD officers arrived to the scene, they found the woman, who was intoxicated and unable to remember her name or what hap-
pened to her.
An ambu-
lance rushed her to Shands at UF while officers can-vassed the woods, where they found the woman’s bi-cycle and bag.
At the hospital 
later that night, the woman told de-tectives she was raped by a man she knew only as “J.B.” and identified Boyd through a six-person photo-graph lineup.
Police received information that 
the woman and Boyd go to St. Fran-cis House, a homeless shelter on South Main Street, frequently.
A shelter employee told detec-
tives Wednesday that Boyd and the woman were in the building early Tuesday afternoon and knew Boyd’s girlfriend, Tia Morton.
Detectives interviewed Morton, 
35, and mentioned Boyd’s alleged rape.On Wednesday , Morton found 
Boyd on Bo Diddley Community Plaza and called police. Boyd fled, and police established a perimeter around the plaza.
An officer contacted two women 
in the French Courtyards Apartment complex, saying that Boyd was hid-ing in one of their apartments.
Police arrested Boyd and booked 
him into Alachua County Jail at 8:28 p.m. As of Thursday night, Boyd re-mained in jail with a $70,000 bond.

Remember our editorial this week about weird stuff that 
happens in Florida? Gov . Rick Scott is one of those things. Our governor gave the phone number to a phone sex hotline instead of the phone number to the health department during a press conference about the meningitis outbreak. We give a nice-try-but-Voldemort-can’t-trick-us-that-easily DART to Gov. Scott. 
It’s like the time the Internet believed that Rick Santorum had the app for Grindr on his phone. Only this time, it’s real. 
Kudos to Netﬂ  ix who, due to a court case, will place caption-
ing on every video it streams. The settlement, and Netﬂ  ix, are being heralded as “a model for the streaming video industry” by the National Association of the Deaf. All of its content will be captioned by this time in 2014. We give a what-a-cool-milestone-for-technology LAUREL to Netﬂ  ix. High ﬁ  ves all around. 
Is it illegal to be a complete, ignorant fool? Because, if so, we’d 
like to charge Mitt Romney with like a million counts of idiocy. That’s an exaggeration. This week, however, he said in an inter-view with The Columbus Dispatch: “We don’t have people that become ill, who die in their apartment because they don’t have insurance.” Earlier in September, he said, “We do provide care for people who don’t have insurance. If someone has a heart at-tack, they don’t sit in their apartment and die. We pick them up in an ambulance, and take them to the hospital, and give them care.” We give a why-don’t-you-have-a-clue-as-to-how-the-world-works DART to Mitt Romney. 
Y’know what’s cute? Little animals. Y’know what’s cuter? 
Little animals that sing. Apparently mice have the ability to learn and mimic songs. “We think mice are intermediate in this ability between a chicken and a song bird or even a non-human primate and a human,” said Dr. Erich Jarvis, who was in charge of the study. We give a one-step-closer-toward-an-actual-”Cinderella”-situation-here-folks LAUREL to cute mice. Keep 
up the cute work, fellas. 
Sometimes former politicians are offensive and not in a Todd 
Akin kind of way. This week, Sarah Palin said words again. She called the Associated Press “absolute jerks” and “biased.” Why? Because they released a photo of Mitt Romney that was “unﬂ  at-tering and looks ridiculous,” in the words of Fox News’s Megyn Kelly when she interviewed Palin this week. Quite frankly, Palin can probably speak to the effect of unﬂ  attering photos, but not every photo is an object of media bias. We give a stop-doing-the-words-thing-and-just-shush DART to Sarah Palin. It’s not 
because she’s a woman in politics, it’s because she’s the worst. 
Canada might have done something right-ish! About 400 
years ago, Justin Bieber, Ryan Gosling and Avril Lavigne were all related. They all have ancestors that date back to some of Quebec’s earliest settlers. We give a that-just-makes-us-love-him-more LAUREL to Ryan Gosling. It’s Friday, live a little.
Have a safe weekend, everyone, and go Gators!
Public media should be treasured, supported
Although it debuted before my time, so to speak, I 
have fond memories of watching “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” as a young child discovering the 
wonders of television in the living room of our tiny Orlando apartment.
Later on, I loved the “Mighty Morphin Power Rangers” 
and “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” as much as any grow-ing boy whose ﬁ  rst formidable doses of testosterone were being pumped into his blood.
But “in my younger and more formidable years,” as Nick 
Carraway put it, I was constantly glued to “Mister Rogers” and “Sesame Street” — learning to speak and read English, think critically, and most importantly, learning the impor-tance of love and caring for others.
In 1969, President Nixon sought to cut a federal grant to 
PBS by 50 percent. In response, the late Fred Rogers, the cre-ator and host of “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood,” gave an impassioned testimony in front of Congress in defense of federal funding for PBS: 
“I give an expression of care, every day to each child to 
help him realize that he is unique. I end the program by say-ing, ‘You’ve made this day a special day by just your being you. There’s no person in the world like you, and I like you just the way you are.’ I feel that if we and public television can only make it clear that feelings are mentionable and manageable, we will have done a great service for mental health.”
With his speech, Mr. Rogers outlined the primary dif-
ference between public broadcasting, which aims only to provide a public service, and for-proﬁ  t broadcasting, which aims only to, well, turn a proﬁ  t. This isn’t to say that all pri-vate media are evil. But it’s essential to understand their mo-tives.
For-proﬁ  t broadcasters don’t care whether our children 
are learning.
They don’t care if our children are developing their read-
ing or math skills. They only care if our children increase their ratings by staying tuned in. They ensure this by lull-ing our youth into a zombie-like stupor resulting from the bewildering idiocy radiating from the teen sitcoms aired on the Disney Channel or the reality television aired on MTV .
The reason I bring all this up, 
as you might imagine, is because of Mitt Romney’s profoundly fool-ish comments about PBS at last week’s presidential debate, dur-ing which he took advantage of former “PBS NewsHour” anchor Jim Lehrer’s presence as modera-
tor to target PBS and Big Bird as recipients of big-govern-ment subsidies that must be put on the chopping block: 
“I’m sorry , Jim, I’m going to stop the subsidy to PBS. I’m 
going to stop other things. I like PBS, I love Big Bird. Actu-ally like you, too. But I’m not going to — I’m not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for. That’s number one.”
First of all, the government doesn’t directly fund PBS. 
It directly funds the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, created in 1968, before PBS existed, after support for public media was noted “of appropriate and important concern” to the country (for all the reasons I just mentioned). The CPB, in turn, supports PBS.
Secondly, funding for PBS from the CPB accounted for 
only 12 percent of PBS’s revenue in 2010, as they mainly rely on private donors and grants.
Third, and most importantly, federal funding for CPB 
amounts to less than one one-hundredth of 1 percent of the budget! 
At a time when the United States spends more on the 
military than the next 13 nations combined and sweeping tax cuts are gift wrapped with shiny bows for millionaires and billionaires, how can anyone suggest cutting an impor-tant public service — especially for children — that amounts to 0.01 percent of the budget as a deﬁ  cit-reduction measure and keep a straight face?
Come to think of it, Romney’s s--t-eating grin was pretty 
creepy ...

Letter to the Editor
Gator Corner: How about some news?
A restaurant is a place to eat; a universi-
ty cafeteria is something more. Gator Cor-
ner Dining Center can be compared to the taverns of the revolutionary period, where politics were discussed, ideas were reﬁ  ned and news was spread. Unfortunately, man-agers take for granted what they decide to put on the eight TV sets that are the focus of the main dining areas. Often, every TV will be set to a sports channel, or worse, ESPN’s “SportsCenter.” College students need news!In less than a month, students will elect 
the next United States president. Gator Corner, a university institution, should do its best to support a politically conscious Student Body. Upcoming election aside, students should always be encouraged to keep up on current issues, both domestic and foreign. The news inspires thoughtful conversation. It’s easier to talk about the news than it is to talk about “The Dress-maker of Khair Khana.” The beneﬁ  ts of following the news cannot be disputed, so I won’t keep on about it. I would rather stress the fact that college students are all about convenience.
Newspaper racks around campus pro-
vide free issues of The New York Times and the Alligator. When the papers run out early in the morning, there’s no more con-venient access to news. Busy college stu-dents don’t have time to search for news. I would greatly appreciate it if I could walk into Gator Corner and kill two birds with one stone — my appetite and Anderson Cooper.
Once I gave the manager the old com-pliment sandwich; “Hi, the food here is great. I just think you should put the news on. The service here is good, too.” For a short time, Gator Corner had CNN on one TV , and people appreciated it. Then, things went back to “SportsCenter.”
To the managers of Gator Corner, please 
be conscious of your institution’s role as a political center at UF. Put the news on. And I like the food.

Our generation has some amazing potential.
We have tools that our parents and grandparents 
could only dream of, and groundbreaking technology 
seems to be at our ﬁ  ngertips with newer, smarter gadgets com-
ing out one after another.
This is all grand — but there is a catch. The current genera-
tion may not have the social skills to create a connected, inter-woven society.
We have many options to take the easy way out in commu-
nication, which eliminates the need for face-to-face conversa-tions.
Email has replaced the need to make phone calls. There is no 
need to dial a number when an individual can answer at their own convenience via the Internet. If an immediate response is required, text messaging is the perfect solution, as many people today always have their cellphone in hand.
However, these methods eliminate the personal touch that 
may play a key factor in getting a message across.
Penmanship of all forms will be lost within a decade. There 
will no longer be a need or demand for cursive, print or any handwriting because all messages will be typed on a keyboard or audio recorded. There is no telling if children will know how to address an envelope in years to come. Bills can be paid on-line, and more families are opting for e-Christmas cards, so it seems that stamps are quickly fading out of fashion.    Crossing campus, it is hard to spot a student not using his 
or her cellphone, whether texting or talking. In class, students sit with laptops open, but not with Word documents up and ready to take notes. Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest screens ﬁ  ll lecture halls.
Hours in class are not well spent on social media networks. 
Even with these sites at our ﬁ  ngertips at all times of the day , many students still opt to browse through them at the expense of missing information given in class.
Whatever happened to living in the moment?In the world of technology, the “here and now” may not ex-
ist. Constantly checking the latest news feed and tweets doesn’t count.
And neither does texting; although it may be instantaneous, 
it still doesn’t have the “here” factor.
On a college campus, we live in a bubble.This is not the same type of bubble that sheltered children 
exist in, but rather one where the only news and information we care to know about is what is happening within a three-mile radius.
Social media has only expanded this bubble into a virtual 
world, where being friends with someone is only ofﬁ  cial once they’ve accepted your request.
It is no one’s fault that the world is continuing to evolve 
just as it has always done. Traditions and customs in societies change, but it is a shame that people will not have the same level of social connectedness in years to come.
Daily interactions can be avoided 
with online classes and other outlets, as we now can avoid having to im-merse ourselves in seas of people.
As long as we use these tools for 
the good that they were created in-stead of distractions from boredom, 
studying or awkward social encounters, it is perfectly accept-able to invite the latest technology into our lives.
Young people constantly think that we are too busy to use 
traditional methods of communication. Frantically running from one thing to the next, I am not excluding myself from this generalization.
There are always just a few too many reasons why we are 
unable to hold meaningful conversations with our neighbors or reach beyond a text to talk to a friend.
Technology is progressing faster than most can keep up, 
and society is inevitably changing. As our world continues to progress, make eye contact, remember strong handshakes and continue adhering to social guidelines.

Jaylen Watkins saw right through the raw numbers.
Throughout the 2011 season, the Gators defense 
was the only unit not to fall short of expectations. Flor-ida finished seventh in the nation in pass defense and eighth in yards allowed per game. 
However, the junior cornerback knew the unit was 
lacking in two vital areas: tackling and toughness.
Watkins said he has seen improvements in the de-
fense in its second year under defensive coordinator Dan Quinn.
“Last year, I don’t think we took tackling as serious,” 
Watkins said. “We didn’t really realize how much a missed tackle can hurt the game. This year when we’re doing our tackling drills, we actually lock in and take it serious.”
Florida’s defense has addressed the weaknesses and 
hopes the progress will continue on Saturday, when the No. 4 Gators (5-0, 4-0 Southeastern Conference) complete the road portion of their conference schedule against Vanderbilt (2-3, 1-2 SEC).
Florida held LSU 33 points below its season aver -
age in last Saturday’s 14-6 win in the Swamp. In Baton Rouge, La., in 2011, the Tigers scored 41 points against the Gators. Watkins cited sound tackling as the primary reason for the turnaround.
“Last year we had 10 missed tackles in the game in 
the secondary,” Watkins said. “This year we had two as a team, so we did a very good job of tackling.”
Watkins showed his tackling ability on LSU’s first 
drive of the game. On a third-and-10 play from Flor -
ida’s 21-yard line, J.C. Copeland, the Tigers’ 6-foot-1, 272-pound fullback, caught a pass in the right flat and was brought down by the 187-pound Watkins and 231-pound linebacker Neiron Ball 3 yards shy of a first down.
The improved tackling can be attributed to the de-
fense’s increased toughness, which Watkins said The alligatorSports crew will 
pile into the car today for a road trip to Nashville, Tenn., 
to watch Florida take on Vanderbilt. While we’re on the road to the “Mu-sic City,” what better way is there to pay homage to the county seat of Davidson County than by putting together a killer playlist for the ride? We could always crank up a little El-vis as we make detour to Graceland. Perhaps we’ll all sit in stony silence as “Party in the U.S.A.” plays on the radio while secretly freaking out in our minds. Nashville native Miley Cyrus is still hip, right? And then, who knows? We’ve been on the road at all hours of the night cover -
ing this beat like a bunch of “Ramb-lin’ Men” and “Midnight Rider(s),” just like the Nashville-based Allman Brothers Band. There will be music, and there will be football. Nashville seems like a nice place.
Now, onto the picks...
Lubbock, Texas, will be almost 
heaven for West Virginia (-3.5) be-
cause...
This song is a one-note tune: 
Geno Smith! Geno Smith! Geno Smith! Geno Smith! Geno Smith! Geno Smith! Geno Smith! And, uh, Geno Smith! Forget football. 
- GREG LUCA
Texas Tech (+3.5) will take West 
Virginia into the “Ring of Fire” on Saturday because...
West Virginia doesn’t believe in 
defense. The Mountaineers allow 35 points per game — double what the Red Raiders have given up. Al-though West Virginia has Heisman frontrunner Smith, they continue to “Walk the Line” of potential upset with a defense softer than a slice of Picks

For Taylor Burke, Tex-
as A&M was a wake-up 
call.
In the five games pri-
or to the Gators’ match against the Aggies, the sophomore goalkeeper had seen only 20 shots. Of those 20, only six were on goal.
But when Florida 
traveled to College Sta-tion, Texas, Burke faced a bombardment of shots. Texas A&M took 19, in-cluding nine on goal.“It was just really fun 
to be involved more,” Burke said.
Luckily for the Gators, 
Burke stepped up to the challenge, allowing only one goal.
“She saved our butts,” 
senior midfielder Erika Tymrak said. “She made some really big-time saves.”
Burke will have to be 
on top of her game again this weekend when No. 12 Florida (10-3-1, 7-1 Southeastern Confer -
ence) hosts No. 14 Mis-souri (12-2, 7-1 SEC). The Tigers’ lineup fea-
tures three players who have six goals this sea-son. By comparison, the 
Gators’ lead-ing goal scorer is sopho-more  Havana 
Solaun, who has five.
“Missouri is a very 
potent offense,” coach Becky Burleigh said. “They’re going to come after us. They’re athletic, and they’re aggressive. We have to really, really focus on being composed in this game, because we don’t want to get into their style of play.”
Burleigh said she was 
disappointed with the team’s composure ear -
ly  in the game against Texas A&M. The Gators allowed the Aggies to take a lead in the 22nd minute.
Unfortunately for 
Missouri, Burke kept her composure against Texas A&M.
“We’re just seeing her confidence grow and her getting better and better,” Burleigh said.
Burke made several 
key saves against the Ag-gies offense, including one late in the first half when she punched a high shot over the crossbar to preserve the Gators’ 2-1 lead.
“She’s just so athlet-
ic,” Burleigh said. “I kind of would have been dis-appointed if she hadn’t made that save, but at the same time, it’s a very spe-cial save.”

begins with Matt Elam.
The junior safety won SEC 
Co-Defensive Player of the 
Week honors after his seven-tackle performance against LSU. He said he makes a con-scious effort to ensure his ef-fort rubs off on his teammates.
“I always tell my team, I 
give it all for them,” Elam said following the win against LSU. “I did what I had to do for us to be victorious. Everybody 
on defense, all the backups, us starters, we all gave good ef-fort and [were] victorious.”
Quinn said Elam is not 
alone in bringing a strong at-titude to the defense.
“We certainly count on 
some energy from Dominique Easley,” Quinn said. “He’s one that provides a lot of tough-ness and effort and finish and that kind of attitude for us. I think Lerentee McCray is cer-tainly one of those guys.”The defenders will have to 
exert their newfound tough-ness against Vanderbilt’s pass-ing attack. The Gators narrow-ly escaped an upset against the Commodores in The Swamp last year with a 26-21 win. Vanderbilt quarterback Jordan Rogers threw for 297 yards, and wide receiver Jordan Mat-thews caught nine passes for 170 yards. 
Sophomore Chris Boyd is 
second to Matthews on the team in receiving yards this season. The duo has combined for 53 catches and 854 yards.
Watkins says the wideout 
tandem will be a good chal-lenge for the UF secondary.
“They’ve got two great re-
ceivers that we played against last year that gave us a little bit of trouble,” Watkins said. “Last year, the pass defense struggled. We’re looking at it as another challenge we’ve got to take care of this week.”

DEFENSE , 
from page 13“Country Pie.” West Virginia will fall victim to the “Death 
and Hell” that awaits visitors in Lubbock, Texas.
- ADAM PINCUS
Leading the pack with a 29-19 record is Rivals’ Bryan 
“Richard Simmons is my homeboy” Holt, who thought it was a good idea to follow up a morning jog with a pep-peroni pizza from Domino’s. No wonder you’re only bag-ging the beefy babes.
Sporting a 26-22 record is The Miami Herald’s Matt 
“Too old for Gainesville” Watts, who has decided at 27 that his lackluster nightlife career is over. Watts has re-sorted to long, crazy nights of Netflix and cuddling with his cat. It’s sad to see. We already miss his welcoming frown and generally pissed-off nature. OK, not really.
Tied with Watts at 26-22 is The Associated Press’ Mark 
“Chris Prosinski will start vs. Oakland” Long, who has decided to keep tweeting about the Jaguars even though nobody gives a crap. Just cut it out, man. The tarps can’t follow you on Twitter.
Rounding out the winning crowd at 25-23 is The Palm 
Beach Post’s Jason “Do it! You won’t” Lieser, who was pumped to stir up some mischief when a colleague left his phone unattended at a recent interview session. Unfortu-nately, the best fake tweet Jason could come up with was “Just ate a whole jar of mayonnaise. Feeling really sick.” Uhhh, good one!
Right at .500 with a 24-24 record is alligatorSports edi-
tor Greg “I love a good latte!” Luca, who was way too excited when a barista at Karma Cream suggested he or -
der a coconut caramel latte. Instead of asking for a latte suggestion, how about you ask for her number next time? Man up!
Sitting at 23-25 is alligatorSports writer Adam “I can’t 
find it!” Pincus, who came into the office with his fly open and could not locate his, uh, his friend Richard. Let’s not be too hard on the guy. He always struggled with those “Where’s Waldo?” books. Sometimes, you just need a magnifying glass.
Also at 23-25 is alligatorSports writer Josh “Look at my 
hands!” Jurnovoy, who always makes gestures while talk-ing — even on the radio. I guess it’s healthy. He’s got to do something with his hands besides type, eat and play with his joystick.
And in dead-ass last with a piss-poor record of 21-27 is 
alligatorSports assistant editor Joe “I still can’t believe its over” Morgan, who has spent most of this week staring at the Chipper Jones page on Baseball Reference. He got through the “anger” phase when he threw out a friend’s Cardinals hat and berated Major League Baseball through every form of social media, but the sadness lingers. It’s OK, bud. You’ll get through this.Burke has been a ma-
jor part of Florida’s cur -
rent seven-game winning 
streak. In those seven games, she held oppo-nents to a goals against average of only .571. Of the four goals she did surrender, only two came when the game was tied, and none were allowed when the Gators were losing.
With five games re-
maining before the SEC tournament, the Gators control their own future in the chase for the regu-lar-season crown. To win the title, Florida will need to defeat its major com-
peti-tor in t h e S E C 
East, the Tigers.

Midterms are just around 
the corner, but Agata Strausa 
and the Florida cross country team are preparing for a dif-ferent kind of examination.
“It’s kind of a test — the 
last test in a way , and also the first chance to see where we’re at,” Strausa said.
Both the men and women 
will be let loose for the first time this season as they head to Pre-Nationals in Louis-ville, Ky., on Saturday.
UF has opened the sea-
son with three consecutive first-place finishes.
The first few races repre-
sented a feeling-out process, as coach Paul Spangler nar -
rowed the team to a travel-ing squad.
On the men’s side, Phil 
Duncan picked up an indi-vidual victory at the Saint Leo Invitational, clinching the seventh and final roster spot.
The race for the last spot 
on the women’s side is still up in the air. The women will have eight runners com-pete at Pre-Nationals to try to sort out the roster.
“We’ve got a good prob-
lem right now, in that, we don’t know who our No. 1 runner is,” Spangler said. “We don’t even know who our top seven are. Every day it seems like in practice, somebody steps up and real-ly has a breakthrough work-out. It’s a good problem to have.”
At the same time, the 
race will mark the Gators’ 
first true 
test. Flor -
ida faces nine op-p o n e n t s r a n k e d in the top 30 on the m e n ’ s side and 
eight top-30 teams on the women’s side.
Pre-Nationals will be the 
first competition in nearly a month for UF’s top runners. 
“We haven’t really been 
able to race all-out,” junior Mark Parrish said. “So that’s a nice change of pace. We’re just going to get cut loose and go run as hard as [we] can.”
The weekend will also 
serve as a preview of the course the NCAA Cham-pionship meet is run on. If UF ultimately qualifies for the national meet, seeing the course in advance will pro-vide an advantage.
“If you can see yourself 
out there running that Na-tionals course, it’s going to be a lot easier to work to-wards that goal,” Parrish said. “Once everyone real-izes like, ‘Hey , we can get out here, this is what it looks like,’ everyone’s going to work really hard to get back there and make Nationals.”FRIDAY, OCTOBER 12, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 15

The No. 11 Gators are atop the Southeast-
ern Conference at the midway point of the 
regular season partly because the communi-cation on the court has improved from previ-ous years, Betsy Smith said.
The redshirt senior said her conversations 
before points with fellow middle blocker Chloe Mann  have helped Florida (13-2, 7-0 SEC), which faces Ole Miss (8-8, 2-5 SEC) on Friday at 7 p.m. in the O’Connell Center.
“This is one of the better years because the 
middle group has been through the program for the longest amount of time,” Smith said. “There just has to be a lot of communication. Make sure everyone is clicking on the same cylinders so we can defend the best we can.”
Coach Mary Wise said she depends on both 
Smith and Mann to point out the opponent’s strategies just before the ball is put in play.
“They’re reminding the young players, 
who need reminding, just who’s in the front row, what rotation they’re in, what are the tendencies in this rotation and what we’re go-ing to do defensively,” Wise said. “It’s actu-ally kind of going through page by page of the scouting report, just in a real condensed form.”
Because Florida has five freshman outside 
hitters and a transfer setter, Smith said effec-tive communication has never been more im-portant than it is now. Back when All-Amer -
icans Kristy Jaeckel and Kelly Murphy were on the outside, communication was not as critical.
“Jaeckel was a great blocker on that pin, 
so we didn’t have to remind her; she knew what she was doing,” Smith said. “But these 
times, it’s just the constant reminder.”
Throughout a match, Mann will point out 
a specific player on the other side of the net to help her teammates remember what to expect. Mann said there has been confusion in previ-ous years with the younger players, which is why communication is critical to Florida’s success.
“We work really hard in it every day in our 
gym, making sure that we’re talking to each other,” Mann said. “That makes sure that no player gets kind of fallen behind. Whether you’re a freshman or a senior, everyone’s on the same page.”UF veterans vital to communication

Through two tournaments, 
Florida’s Emily Bastel has lived 
up to the hype.
The Gators women’s golf 
coach, described as a “diamond in the rough” by athletics direc-tor Jeremy Foley, has not disap-pointed. 
“She doesn’t say things to fill 
the air,” senior Isabelle Lendl said. “She isn’t a diva, and she’s not go-ing to pretend that she has never hit a bad shot. She’s a very good listener and communicator.”
In the wake of Jan Dowling’s 
resignation, Bastel has achieved a slew of notable results. 
Three weeks removed from 
their season-opening win at the Cougar Classic in Charleston, S.C., the Gators have vaulted to No. 2 in the most recent World/WGCA Coaches’ Poll, a seven-spot jump. 
“It’s definitely very gratifying 
to be able to make the decisions for the team and do what you think is best for the team and to build those relationships with the girls,” Bastel said. During her time as a player at 
Michigan State, Bastel’s competi-tive nature fueled her success. She was a four-time All-Big Ten selec-
tion and earned A l l - A m e r i c a 
honors in 2002. 
Bastel also 
played on the LPGA Tour from 2005-06 and in 2008, experienc-ing firsthand the level of focus 
needed to consistently compete at a high level.  “There is really no substitute 
for that competitive golf experi-ence, and that translates into be-ing able to speak to my players and lending my credibility,” Bas-tel said.
“When they’re on the golf 
course dealing with various emo-tions of being a player and what it takes, those are the things I can really relate to them on.”
Bastel has taken a methodi-
cal approach on the fairways this season. Florida continues to make steady improvements with each tournament.“When we went into the Cou-
gar Classic we wanted to do a good job of worrying about our -
selves, playing our own game, staying in the present and playing one shot at a time,” Bastel said. “That was our philosophy then and it worked, so I think we are going to stick to that game plan throughout the whole year.”
The Gators have just two tour -
naments remaining in the fall and will take the course today for the Tar Heel Invitational in Chapel Hill, N.C. The tournament is set to run through Sunday.
