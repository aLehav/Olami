82/62� GATORS WON 68-58.

 PHOENIX — Marquette slapped, 
pushed and attempted to manhan-
dle Florida; Florida defended, frus-trated and outhustled Marquette.
In the end, hustle and defense 
won.
The No. 7 seed Gators (26-10) 
have played their way into a second straight berth in the Elite Eight after 
defeating the third-seeded Golden 
Eagles (27-8) 68-58 on Thursday 
night in Phoenix. Florida advances to play No. 4 seed Louisville on Sun-day at 4:30 p.m. for a chance to make 
a trip to the Final Four.
In the buildup to the game, Mar-
quette forward and Big East Player 
of the Year Jae Crowder questioned UF’s ability on the defensive end, 
and that proved to be a mistake.
Florida allowed an average of 
47.5 points in its ﬁ  rst two tourna-
ment wins against Virginia and Nor-folk State, and the team continued 
its defensive dominance against a 
high-scoring, fast-paced Marquette 
squad. The Gators held the Golden Eagles to 30 points on 31.4 percent 
shooting in the ﬁ  rst half, and a game 
total just one point more than their 
season-low of 57 on 30.8 percent shooting.
“We knew we could defend 
these guys because they weren’t 
recreating the wheel when it came 
to offense,” Patric Young said. “We knew we could stop these guys and it wasn’t like they were a high-or-
ganized offense that could just run 
their stuff around us. … We knew 
what we could do; I’d rather them think we can’t guard them so they’re surprised.”
A frenetic ﬁ  rst 4:26 saw Marquette 
establish a quick 9-4 lead with a sig-niﬁ  cant physical presence inside and ability to get up and down the ﬂ  oor — attributes that made the Golden 
Eagles a savvy Final Four pick even 
before Missouri and Michigan State 
were upset.
“We were a little nervous,” 
Young said. “When you know what’s on the line, it’s one-and-done if you can’t come away the victory, you get kind of nervous because there’s so much pressure on you.”

Saturday Night Live’s “Weekend Up-
date” anchor and head writer Seth Meyers 
performed standup at UF Thursday night 
and made jokes at the Student Body’s ex-
pense.
Meyers spoke to an audience of about 
3,100 in the Stephen C. O’Connell Center at the event sponsored by Accent Speakers Bureau and Jewish Awareness Month.
A line spanned the sidewalk from Gate 1 
to Gate 2 at 6 p.m. An hour later, it stretched 
to Stadium Road. 
The show began at 8 p.m.
Cassidy Howell and Lauren Bawer said 
they and a group of six friends took two-
hour shifts waiting in line since noon.
“We absolutely love SNL,” said Howell, 
an 18-year-old anthropology freshman.
Bawer, a 19-year-old applied physiology and kinesiology freshman, said she and 
some of her friends are obsessed with the 
show and Meyers in particular.
“I thought there’d be more people here,” 
Bawer said.
Accent paid an agency representing 
Meyers $50,000 for the ap-
pearance, said chairman Corey Portney.
Although the event 
was billed as a combina-
tion event hosted by Ac-
cent and Jewish Aware-
ness Month, Meyers said he is not Jewish after an 
audience member asked.
“I think this is as bad as Jewish Aware-
ness Month could go,” Meyers later joked. “Who were your speakers? Oh, Seth Mey-ers and Mel Gibson.”SNL anchor Seth Meyers drew 
about 3,100 to O’Connell Center

UF withdrew its proposal Thursday 
for an undergraduate enhancement fee 
after the Florida Board of Governors vot-ed against the measure Wednesday.
The fee, which would have cost un-
dergraduates $6.76 per credit hour, was meant to supplement graduate assistant stipends.
The stipends increased 3 percent last 
year, but graduate assistant fees were also raised 16 percent.
Only one board member voted in fa-
vor of the undergraduate enhancement fee.
During the 2010-11 academic year, 
UF employed about 1,500 graduate as-sistants who taught one-third of under-graduate classes.  
UF President Bernie Machen told 
UF’s Board of Trustees in December that adding the fee would be an investment in the futures of both the undergraduate and graduate programs.
So far, there’s no word on whether UF 
will seek another way to supplement sti-pends or replace the fee.
“We have no further plans at this 
point,” UF spokesman Steve Orlando said.
The Board of Governors also com-
mended UF and Florida State University for leading the state in their efforts to identify and prevent hazing.
UF and FSU are currently the only 
schools in the State University System 
that provide professional staff training 
in hazing prevention strategies, accord-ing to information from the Board of Governors.
FSU is the only university with a ded-
icated anti-hazing website.

� HE SAID HE WAS INSPIRED BY 
ITALIAN FUTURISM.
SUZETTE COOK
Alligator Contributing Writer
Jay Rosen was listening to Frank Zappa 
when he first started painting a horse in 
his living room last summer.
“First it was Zappa, then it was Miles 
Davis,” Rosen said. He painted 27 fiber -
glass horses that will be auctioned off to-night in Ocala.
Rosen, a 21-year-old fine arts junior, is 
the only UF student whose idea was ac-cepted by the jury of Horse Fever. Three-hundred applicants vied for a chance to paint the life-sized horses.
Horse Fever is a nationally recognized 
auction sponsored by the Marion Cultur -
al Alliance, a nonprofit organization that benefits the arts in Marion County.  
Rosen said his sculpture professor sug-
gested he enter the contest, which is the first charity event he has participated in.
According to Laurie Zink, MCA board 
of directors member and co-chairwoman 
of Horse Fever, applications came from 
artists throughout Florida and beyond.
“The top artists in the state all submit-ted this time,” she said. “It’s serious art this year because the jury was really look-ing at a serious art show.”Zink referred to “Iris” as “The Jackson 
Pollock” horse because of Rosen’s style. He said he was inspired by Italian Futurism and painters like Georges Seurat — “the way they paint and use energy and color,” Rosen said.
He remembers dancing around the 
horse, posed with her head down as if grazing in a pasture, and painted for three minutes on each side.
“I’m a drawing major, so I don’t really 
paint anymore,” he said. “Now I’m work-ing on how light affects our senses and how we perceive the inner world with color.”
Rosen chose her name because, he said, 
it means “goddess of the rainbow and 
movement of the wind.”
Ten years ago, the Horse Fever auc-
tion netted $800,000, Zink said. This year 
she expects MCA to exceed its goal of 
$250,000.
The combined funds will be used to cre-
ate an endowment that will benefit local 
art and art schools.
“I would like to see our opening bids at 
$3,500,” Zink said.
Rosen hopes College of Central Florida 
will win his horse. He studied there for two years.
“One of the judges from CF said they 
would like to put it in front of Webber Gal-lery,” he said. “I learned to paint there, and they said they would like to have my horse since I am an alumnus.”4, ALLIGATOR §  FRIDAY, MARCH 23, 2012

Art student Jay Rosen, 21, hopes his horse art “Iris” will earn thousands at the Horse 
Fever auction to be held at Live Oak Plantation in Ocala tonight. Rosen is one of 27 artists chosen to contribute to the event, which will benefit the arts in Marion County.
UF art student chosen to paint life-size horses for charity auctionAccent paid $50,000 
for Meyers’ appearance
Meyers performed stand-up 
for the first hour and answered 
audience questions for the last 
20 minutes.
He covered topics such as 
his different levels of Las Vegas 
drunk, women taking pictures 
with friends and the Republican 
presidential candidates.
He also read jokes that were 
banned from being aired on “Weekend Update.”
“According to a study, col-
lege students put on 6 to 9 pounds during their freshman year because of beer drinking 
and lack of physical activity,” 
he said, “which means the rest of your freshman 15 is probably a baby.”
Andrea Fershtman, a 21-year-
old economics senior, said she didn’t know what to expect because other Accent speakers have done Q&A sessions, but she was pleased with the show.
“I loved it,” she said. “Espe-
cially when he called the people 
out for inviting him to Jewish 
Awareness Month.”
Meyers was born in Evan-
ston, Ill., and graduated from 
Northwestern University. 
He hosted the 2010 and 2011 
ESPY Awards on ESPN, and in 
2011 he was the keynote speak-er at a White House Correspon-
dents Association Dinner.

UF’s Relay for Life could be moving outdoors next year.
During the past few years, Relay For Life has grown, and 
space has become limited at the usual venue, the Stephen C. 
O’Connell Center, said Allison Barkett, Relay at UF’s event chairwoman.
Bringing the event outside will allow more people to par -ticipate.
Both the American Cancer Society and the UF Relay For 
Life team want to move the event to an outdoor venue, Bar -
kett said. Most Relay events across the nation are held out-doors.
“We’ve mapped it out, and we can fit about 16 more 
campsites on Norman Field,” she said. “We can fit even more on Flavet Field.”Stephanie Rolon, a 20-year-old health science junior, will 
attend her fifth Relay event this weekend.
“I think it would be a lot of fun, and it would be open to 
new fundraisers,” she said of changing venues.
The move would require some adjustments.The O’Connell Center gives Relay for Life a discounted 
price to use the venue and provides help with equipment 
and access to bathrooms and water fountains.
Despite the adjustments, Barkett said she believes a lot of 
benefits could come from the change.
“Awareness is one of the key things we are trying to 
achieve,” she said.Relay For Life could move outside next year due to growth

About 20 people were pied in 
the face Thursday night, and it 
was all for the kids.
Dance Marathon hosted a kick-
off celebration on Flavet Field Thursday evening. Attendees paid for two hours worth of dinner, 
music and shoving pie in people’s 
faces.
Dance Marathon staff sold 
about 1,000 tickets, and all pro-ceeds will be added to the annual 
event’s donations, said spokes-
man Eden Joyner.
Dance Marathon at UF raises 
money for the Children’s Miracle 
Network at Shands Hospital. Par -
ticipants ask for donations, and 
they stand for 26.2 hours.
This year, participants will 
stand from 11:48 a.m. on March 31 
to 2:08 p.m on April 1 at the Ste-
phen C. O’Connell Center, said Joyner, a 22-year-old public rela-tions and political science senior.
Garrett Chappell, a 20-year-old 
advertising junior, was pied in the face by Brandon Corsentino, a 20-year-old marketing sophomore. Corsentino works on the Dance 
Marathon marketing team under 
Chappell, the marketing director.
“I do it all for the kids,” Chap-
pell said.
The kickoff was supposed to 
end with Overall Director Alex 
Spratt lighting a 2-and-a-half foot 
tall electronic candle. However, Joyner said that because people 
left and the sky was still light, the 
candle will be lit at the opening ceremonies March 31.
Spratt spoke to the crowd about 
when a child leaves the hospital and cuts off his or her hospital band. Attendees were given bands to to wear until Dance Marathon.
Twenty-one-year-old finance 
junior Lindsay Taylor, a commu-nity events captain, said she will keep her band on throughout Dance Marathon.
“It signifies what the miracle 
children go through while they’re in the hospital,” she said.

With an economy in flux, 
Gainesville still has an unemploy-
ment rate of 7.4 percent.
To combat that statistic, a UF 
club has organized a job fair to help put unemployed adults back into the workforce.
The UF chapter of Students in 
Free Enterprise will host a free job fair from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday at the Center for Innovation and Economic Development, located at 530 W University Ave.
Travis Wright, project manager 
for the club, said the job fair, which will include resume critiques, 
practice interviews and legal ad-
vice, was set up because students felt drawn to helping others suc-ceed in the job market — students who will hit the same market soon 
enough.
In 2009, the unemployment rate 
in Gainesville was 6.6 percent. In 
2008, it was 4.1 percent. In 2007, it 
was 2.9 percent, according to the 
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate in February 2012 was 7.4 percent for the city.
“When people go back into 
the workforce, 
they are helping themselves, and they are helping the community as a whole,” said 
Wright, a 19-year-
old finance soph-omore. “In col-
lege, we have so many resources to 
pull from. This event is for people 
who haven’t worked in a few years and don’t really know how to get back into the workplace.”
Mayor Craig Lowe and Joe 
Johnson, director of business ser -
vices for Florida Works, will be at the fair to talk about the job market in the city.
Lowe will talk with partici-
pants about unemployment in the 
city, Wright said. Johnson will talk 
about Florida Works and give in-terviewing tips.
“Some people are at a cross-
roads,” Johnson said. “They are at a job and don’t know what to do. We are here to help them.”
He said he is happy to see stu-
dents reach out to their commu-nity, even though some students 
feel like Gainesville is a temporary 
home.
“When you get the students 
here and helping, it exemplifies that UF students are involved in 
the community,” he said. “The 
resume opens the door, but the in-terviews close it on the way out,” Johnson said.

Pi Kappa Phi is back.
The fraternity is returning to UF after 
its Alpha Epsilon chapter received a four-year ban for hazing in 2008. Staff from its national office will be on campus until 
April 6 to recruit new members.
The chapter wants to build a base of 30 
to 50 upperclassmen so it has leadership 
going into fall, said national Director of Expansion Tyler Johansson.
Then, Pi Kappa Phi will join the Inter -
fraternity Council and participate in rush.
“This time around, we’re going to re-
cruit the guys that we know want to be 
different,” Johansson said. “We want 
them to challenge the fraternity stereotype that you see in pop culture.”
Ryan Montgomery, a 19-year-old psy-
chology freshman, accepted one of the two bids extended so far. His dad was a member of the fraternity at UF in the ’80s, but the service aspect of the fraternity is what attracted Montgomery.
Pi Kappa Phi’s philanthropy, called 
Push America, supports people with dis-abilities.
Montgomery hopes to help lead the 
chapter in the fall. He’ll be a sophomore 
recruiting freshmen, which he said could 
build stronger bonds.
“The age gap doesn’t make me feel 
like I’m [an] elder and I deserve more,” he said. “I want to see everyone as equals in this fraternity.”Fraternity reinstated after 
being shut down for hazing� CERTIFIED HYPNOTIST RECIEVES 
DOZENS OF CALLS EACH WEEK.
CODY NED ROMANO
Alligator Contributing Writer       
To help UF students overcome stress, Car -
ol Perrine hypnotizes them.
“Your mind is like a blank Microsoft 
Word document,” she said to an audience at 
a public library in downtown Gainesville this 
week. “You can impress upon it anything you 
want.”
The certified hypnotherapist receives doz-
ens of calls from students and Gainesville residents every week.
One recent caller, a student in UF’s Col-
lege of Dentistry, wanted help overcoming a phobia that caused her to faint every time she saw sharp dental tools. After a few sessions 
with Perrine, the student was able to perform 
a root canal without flinching.
Part of the demand for hypnotherapy may 
be due to the fact that levels of stress and anxi-ety among students reached an all-time high this year.
In January, the University of California, 
Los Angeles, published a study revealing that about half of all college students felt dissatis-fied with their emotional health. At the same time, students reported feeling more pressure to succeed in school.
“I feel like I barely have time to go to class-
es and finish all of my homework,” said Erin 
Harris-Parks, a 22-year-old anthropology and 
geology senior.
Perrine, 57, alleviates stress through work-
shops and personal hypnosis sessions.
Perrine, who has a bachelor’s degree in 
psychology from UF, used metaphors to jux-tapose conscious and unconscious thought during her library lecture. When the mind wasn’t a Word document, it was a piece of 
software, ripe for hacking, or a double-decker

Darts & Laurels
This week, we’ll start off by throwing a few darts and 
end with some more pleasant laurel-giving.
First, we throw a contrary-to-any-implication-I-didn’t-
do-it-I-counseled-Jason-not-to-do-it-he-agreed-I-thought-
I-acted-very-responsibly DART at the 56 senators in Stu-
dent Government who voted to approve Katie Waldman for chairwoman of the allocations committee.
Apparently, repeating the same phrase over and over is 
enough to convince people that unethical actions are sud-denly acceptable.
Next, we toss a there’s-a-difference-between-what-is-
ethical-and-what-is-legal DART to former Unite Party 
spokeswoman Christina Bonarrigo.
After Tuesday’s senate meeting, Bonarrigo told the Al-
ligator there was nothing wrong with Waldman remaining silent about Tiemeier throwing away newspapers.
Of course, it’s not illegal to refrain from reporting a 
crime.
However, saying that it’s ethical to withhold informa-
tion shows her completely distorted worldview.
During the whole fiasco, Bonarrigo told the Student 
Press Law Center that the Alligator fabricated the story about Tiemeier throwing away newspapers.
One would think that Waldman, the vice chairwoman 
of the Rules and Ethics Committee, would be the first to 
bring forth information about the incident if she knew who 
was involved.
Instead, Waldman remained silent. How is that not un-
ethical?
For some good news, we give a make-it-stop LAUREL 
to the Florida Board of Governors committee that rejected 
a proposed undergraduate enhancement fee that would have added 5 percent to the total cost of undergraduate tuition.
Although this fee might have been blocked, it does not 
mean that the cost of attendance will not increase. Keep your eyes peeled for more news about this issue.
We also would like to give a good-luck-in-the-Big-Ap-
ple LAUREL to Tim Tebow, who will likely be playing for 
the New York Jets next season. We know many Gators fans were hoping he would come back to Florida, but don’t be surprised to see more Jets jerseys around Gainesville.

Soldier should be punished for murders
Disbelief and outrage quickly spread across Af-ghanistan as well as in the U.S. last week when Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales went on a vicious 
killing spree that resulted in the deaths of 16 Afghan civilians. Both nations were left wondering what led to this deadly outburst from an active member of the U.S. military.
A great deal of controversy quickly surrounded the 
issue. Some condemn the soldier for his crime and de-mand punishment. Others blame post-traumatic stress disorder, among other mental conditions, and claim he is not at fault. Despite the raging debate among the pub-
lic, I believe Bales deserves punishment for the crimes 
he committed.
The events occurred on March 11, when Bales alleg-
edly snuck off his post in the middle of the night and 
moved from house to house, shooting and burning in-
nocent villagers in their beds. Nine of the 16 he killed were children. He then returned to his post and turned himself in. This senseless crime cannot be excused or explained, and the repercussions of his fatal attack are 
serious.
According to The Associated Press, the Afghan mi-
litia called the attack a “blood-soaked and inhumane 
crime” and the attacker representative of “sick-minded 
American savages.” The Taliban vowed to seek revenge 
“for every single victim with the help of Allah.” There have been many news reports expressing the Afghan threats of retaliation against Bales’ family, and many people fear for his neighborhood in Bonney Lake.
Additionally, the slayings, which are collectively 
said to be among the worst atrocities committed by U.S. forces during the Afghan war, happened amid the deepening public outrage prompted by last month’s 
Quran burnings. Contributing to the growing distrust 
between Afghans and U.S. forces, this recent incident has caused U.S. officials to openly doubt our country’s ability to accomplish its mission in Afghanistan.
Despite the disturbing nature 
of his crime and the severe reper -
cussions the entire nation will feel because of his attack, many argue that Bales cannot be blamed for what he did. They speculate he may have suffered from PTSD 
and “his 11-year Army career had stalled with a missed 
promotion, and four deployments had taxed his family and finances,” according to an article in USA Today.
Yet this argument has an obvious flaw. Thousands of 
men and women who serve in the military experience 
the same pressures and stress that Bales felt, and none 
of them intentionally shot and killed more than a dozen innocent civilians. All of these courageous citizens dedi-cated their lives to serving their country by their own 
sacrifice and expense, and have watched as the image of 
the U.S. military is soiled by another soldier’s devastat-ing decision.
I know I have never spent a day at war fighting an 
enemy who wears no uniforms and hides among civil-
ians to use them as shields. I have not endured multiple 
tours of duty or experienced the thankless nature of this war while the ability to really see any success evades me. I have not walked in Robert Bales’ shoes. However, 
no mental condition or amount of stress could justify 
Bales’ heinous crimes.
The bottom line is Bales killed defenseless men, 
women and children in cold blood. He undermined a 10-year mission, endangered his family and dishonored 
his country. He now awaits his fate in a cell in the mili-
tary jail in Fort Leavenworth, Kan. When his court date arrives, Bales should not be able to hide behind excuses but instead deserves to pay the price for the crimes he 
committed and the damage he caused this country.

Letters to the Editor
Alligator should apologize to Sen. 
Waldman
I am writing on behalf of Sen. Katie Wald-
man.
I have carefully read the various articles 
appearing in the Alligator, including those au-
thored by the Editorial Board and by reporters such as Clare Lennon and Samantha Shavell. 
The articles are biased and portray Waldman 
unfairly. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the March 12 article by your “Guest Colum-nist,” Jason Tiemeier, only mentioned that Waldman was walking with him “around 
campus.” At no time did Tiemeier state that 
Waldman was in any way involved with his misconduct, directly or indirectly. Indeed, Ti-
emeier said that “I let my sense of competi-
tion get in the way of integrity . . .”
Conspicuously absent was any implica-
tion that Waldman engaged in misconduct or even contemporaneously knew of Tiemeier’s 
actions.
Waldman’s only public commentary in re-
spect to this matter was that, upon Tiemeier 
advising her of his actions, she promptly 
counseled him not to do so again. Never -
theless, the Alligator’s repeated and public 
attacks upon Waldman are unnecessarily 
inflammatory and accusatory. Further, Wald-
man has devoted substantial hours to worthy 
student causes in her capacity as a senator, in-cluding expanded library hours and security.
It has not gone unnoticed that the Alliga-
tor’s Editorial Board supported the minor -
ity party in the student elections last month. 
Moreover, we are aware that the Alligator’s 
Editorial Board was publicly displeased with 
the Unite Party’s public campaign (including social networking sites) to balance the nega-
tive publicity heaped upon it by the Alliga-
tor.
It should also be noted that our Student 
Government, under which the Unite Party 
has been in majority control by the will, and 
vote, of the student population for more 
than four years, has collaboratively decided 
to substantially reduce the amount of fund-ing for advertisements in the Alligator and, 
instead, utilizing those savings for purposes 
more beneficial to the Student Body. We un-
derstand that these actions by the Unite Party have frustrated the Alligator, thereby explain-
ing its own behavior with regard to the Unite 
Party and Waldman.
For these reasons, the Alligator’s Editorial 
Board and reporters have unprofessionally 
lashed out at the Unite Party in general and 
Waldman in particular. Under the circum-
stances, the Alligator should now apologize to Waldman based upon her manifest inno-
cence in this matter.
Brittney Austin
Former senator
In view of our nation’s tragic history of segregation and discrim-
ination, lawmakers realized that action was necessary to correct the many wrongs done to blacks and other minorities during 
this period. Their solution, called affirmative action, entails giving minority citizens preferential treatment for college admission and 
scholarships. At the time, this reverse-discrimination was exactly 
what the nation needed, and it served as an apology to those citi-zens whose lives were hurt by prior policies. However, continuing affirmative action in modern society has become more of a plague than a benefit. Abigail Fisher v. University of Texas, a new discrim-ination case against UT, is going to the Supreme Court. The court should take Fisher’s side and abolish affirmative action in college admissions once and for all.
The biggest problem with affirmative action is simple. Using 
discrimination to combat discrimination encourages racial hatred in our society. When discriminated against, whites and Asian-Americans may feel resentment toward those races that have been selected as the most elite of the disadvantaged. In turn, African-Americans and Hispanics could feel inferior because the govern-ment is essentially telling them that — for no reason other than the color of their skin — they need special assistance to put them on par with their peers.
Ideally , we would like to reach a state in which society does not 
judge its members based on the color of their skin but rather on the content of their character, as the Rev . Martin Luther King Jr. said. If he could see how his speeches are being interpreted and where the direction of racial equality is going in our nation today , he would 
surely roll over in his grave. Revers-ing the direction of inequality does not bring anyone closer to equality.
Perhaps what is most foolish 
about affirmative action is that it 
doesn’t directly target the problem 
it tries to solve. It assumes that because African Americans and 
Hispanics are typically more economically disadvantaged than whites and Asians, African Americans and Hispanics should re-ceive extra support. However, it would seem to make more sense to give the economically disadvantaged more support, regardless of race. For example, who needs a scholarship more: a black child from a family of doctors and lawyers or a white child living in a slum with a single parent working as a janitor? Financial data does 
a much better job predicting financial need than skin color. If schol-
arships and admission procedures aim to help the disadvantaged, they should target the disadvantaged. It makes no sense to simply target a race and assume that race will be disadvantaged.
Affirmative action supporters point to the racial gap in socio-
economic equality. While they point to valid statistics, they have somehow come to flawed conclusions in their goal to help level the playing field. It is true that African Americans and Hispanics represent the impoverished at higher rates than the general popu-
lation. But by taking a socioeconomic approach to the problem, the 
government can avoid racist policies to fix it.
Good arguments can be made for factoring financial need into 
scholarships. And, while more of a stretch, factoring socioeconomic position into college admission criteria could have benefits. How-ever, race has no place in either criterion. Though this may seem to be a complicated issue, it all boils down to a single underlying question: Should it be legal to discriminate against people based on the color of their skin? Answer that, and you’ve answered whether 
we should continue affirmative action.
Stephen McGarvey is a columnist for the Daily Texan at the Univer-
sity of Texas.Affirmative action 
no longer necessaryUWire
In his 2008 book, “In Defense of Food: An Eater’s 
Manifesto,” Michael Pollan advised people to re-
store simplicity to food practices. Pollan’s message, 
“Eat food, mostly plants,” resonated strongly with the 
myriad of groups and differentiated movements that 
have morphed into “the food movement.” In empha-
sizing simplicity, these recent efforts at food reform 
differed from their predecessors by moving past the 
politics of food production, regulation and inspection. 
They focus instead on the diverse ethical, cultural, en-
vironmental and health implications of food. Yet, de-
spite that broad focus, the recent food movement is in-
herently political. By challenging us to slow down and 
carefully consider the consequences of food consump-
tion and creation, the movement and its crisscrossing 
components challenge us to rethink the role of govern-
ment in the new “politics” of food.
Though the movement often strives for simplicity in 
food practices, its debates hardly have narrow scope. In one subset of food politics, health and lifestyle con-
cerns drive efforts to change America’s “food culture” 
and render its defining practices more sustainable. 
This has given rise to campaigns promoting garden-
ing, composting, healthy cooking and food literacy. 
Likewise, as Americans continue to struggle against 
diet-related illnesses, government health experts are tasked with balancing the country’s needs for greater 
access to quality food and limiting unhealthy food in 
programs such as school lunches. This debate is central 
to efforts to reform the food-stamp program, to which 
ensuring positive health outcomes is more important than ever, given that one out of every seven Americans 
uses the program. In these in-
stances, the food movement has stressed the importance 
of fostering positive relationships with healthy food.
Elsewhere, there is concern about how governments 
impact agricultural practices. From subsidies in the U.S. Farm Bill to preferential trade policies for European ag-
ricultural producers in the EU’s Common Agricultural 
Policy, debates continue as to which crops should be 
supported and what effects those preferential policies 
have on developing foreign markets. Genetically modi-
fied crops and their potentially controversial environ-
mental effects are also included in this discussion. Fur -
thermore, political moves to support agriculture at the expense of natural resources have recently come under fire, as with the Florida Everglades.
Ultimately, moves toward sustainable, grass-grazed, 
cage-free and organic foods, as well as improved food 
access and culture, form the backbone of the modern 
food movement. 
Still, as China’s example shows, oversight is still nec-
essary, particularly with regard to the deceptive food-
marketing tactics of corporations in the developing 
world. If there is one overarching goal that everyone in the food movement agrees on, it is avoiding exporting 
past mistakes of the United States’ unsustainable and 
unhealthy food practices abroad.

Review at Harvard University.Sustainable food movement

Florida fans need to cherish every mo-
ment of this NCAA Tournament run, because it’s the last time they’ll get to 
see Brad Beal in a Gators uniform. 
As the season has gone on, Beal has be-
come one of the best players in all of college basketball, and there’s almost no chance he comes back for a sophomore season to play in a system that is nothing like what he’ll run at the next level. He is yet to offer any definitive com-
ment on his future, but the writing is on the wall. 
Besides, what more does he have to 
prove?
In UF’s 68-58 win against Marquette 
Thursday night, Beal was nothing short of dominant. He scored 21 points on 8-of-10 shooting, driving through the lane for ac-robatic finishes while hitting 3 of 5 shots from long range. He grabbed six more rebounds, coming up just shy of his team-leading aver -
age of 6.7 per game. 
He even notched 
four assists  with only two turnovers, 
highlighting how far he’s come in terms of protecting the ball. After struggling with giveaways early in the season, he’s figured it out down the stretch, averaging just 1.4 per game over UF’s last eight contests. Not bad for a freshman averages a team-high 34.2 minutes per game. 
Beal has even gotten it done on the defen-
sive end, where his ability to match up with everything from guards to power forwards 
After impressive tourney run, Beal should be one and doneJOHN BOOTHE

PHOENIX — Before the Gators 
could beat Marquette, they had 
to talk Butler.
In a film session prior to trav-
elling to U.S. Airways Center in Phoenix, Billy Donovan rehashed the memory of last year’s 74-71 
overtime loss to the Bulldogs, 
specifically the Gators’ inability to grab loose balls and their fail-ure to make hustle plays down the stretch.
Against a team like the No. 
3 seed Golden Eagles, Donovan knew repeating the same melt-down could stamp a final death 
sentence on the seventh-seeded 
Gators’ season.
While most of the blame Flor -
ida’s coach heard last year after the Elite Eight defeat to Butler 
concerned both Kenny Boynton’s 
and Erving Walker’s shot selec-tion, Donovan felt the criticism was unwarranted. 
“What we didn’t do is we gave 
up the  last eight minutes of the 
game something like 13 points off of loose ball situations,” Donovan said on Monday. “In my opinion 
that’s where the game was won 
and lost.”
On Thursday night in the 
Sweet 16 against the Golden Ea-
gles, there was no bowing out of 
the NCAA Tournament again for the Gators due to a lack of hus-tle. 
Instead, Florida became the 
aggressor and buckled down on defensive end to beat Marquette 68-58. For the second straight year, the Gators advance to the 
Elite Eight and will play Satur -day against No. 4 seed Louisville at 4:30 p.m. 
With the Gators shooting 25.9 
percent from three on the night, 
senior guard Erving Walker said 
the foundation for Florida’s run 
began on the defensive end in the opening 20 minutes.“Our defense was the key,” 
Walker said. “Obviously, we struggled shooting the ball. Brad (Beal) made some great shots for 
us today but defense was what 
won it for us.”
 Coming into the game, Dono-
van said Florida would be over -
coming mental mistakes against Marquette’s defense, which aver -

Austin Maddox flinched 
when the contact came. 
He looked uncomfortable 
from the moment he stepped 
out of the bullpen before 8,242 booing fans, but now it reached an uncharacteristic crescendo. 
Pinch-hitting freshman Kyle 
Martin ripped an RBI single down the right-field line and Florida’s Southeastern Con-ference road opener was de-
flated. Two batters later, Erik 
Payne tore a two-run double to right-center field and the mis-ery continued while Maddox’s 
night ended. 
South Carolina still has 
Florida’s number. 
“It was a great ball game. 
We just kind of let the seventh inning slip away from us,” UF 
coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “It’s just one game and obvi-ously we’ll come back tomor -
row ready to go.”
The No. 8 Gamecocks (17-
5, 1-3 SEC) defeated the No. 1 Gators (20-2, 3-1 SEC), 9-3, to snap Florida’s school-record 
18-game winning streak and 
get a jump on the three-game rematch of last year’s College 
World Series finals. 
Entering the game having 
lost four of its last five — in-
cluding a sweep at the hands 
of No. 16 Kentucky and a 
Wednesday night loss to Wof-ford — the Gamecocks were ready to throw everything they had at the Gators. 
Staff ace and consensus 2011 
All-American Michael Roth got the start for the Game-cocks and worked 6.2 innings of four-hit ball, leaving with 
the game deadlocked at two. 
It was where South Carolina went from there that got the sellout crowd buzzing. 
Matt Price, the Gamecocks’ 
dominant closer last season and current No. 2 starter, pitched the game’s final 2.1 innings despite being slated 
to start tonight’s contest. Price 
walked three but did not allow a UF hit. 
Florida’s first conference 
road game 
of the season 
was nothing 
like its first 21 games of 
2012. 
Right-
h a n d e d 
starter Hud-
son Randall loaded the bases 
with no outs in the first before 
striking out three batters in a row. It was a common theme as Randall went on to break his 
career single-game strikeout 
high with 11 over 5.2 innings — a two-run Adam Matthews homer his only major blemish. 
“He competed his tail off,” 
O’Sullivan said. “We’ve just got to do a better job there in the last two or three innings.”Gamecocks halt

motivation for the Gators’ Sweet 16 matchup against Marquette.
sEE GREG, p AGE 15sEE HUs TLE, p AGE 15UF to face Louisville nextThe Gators entered the game leading the nation in fielding 
percentage at .985, but committed two errors against a Game-
cocks offense that sputtered in recent losses. 
One error led to the benching of freshman left fielder Justin 
Shafer, as Florida continues to search for a defensive remedy after the loss of senior center fielder Tyler Thompson to a torn ACL. 
After dropping a routine fly ball in the third, Daniel Pigott was 
moved back to left from center and junior Cody Dent was insert-
ed in center. It was the first time Dent has played outfield in his collegiate career. 
“We just wanted to shore up the de-
fense a little bit,” O’Sullivan said during 
an in-game interview with ESPNU announcers.
But no downfall was more sudden than that of Maddox. Af-
ter walking no batters all season, Maddox surrendered walks to the second and third batters he faced before ultimately getting 
charged with three earned runs. He entered the road trip with a 
0.49 ERA in 18.1 innings.

JONATHAN CZUPRYN

Year after year, the Southeastern 
Conference proves to be one of the 
most daunting leagues in college softball  — at least for teams like Ar -
kansas. 
For No. 4 Florida, playing in the 
SEC comes with challenges from 
schools like No. 1 Alabama, No. 11 Georgia and No. 12 Tennessee. However, the Gators have had no problem breezing through most of the league, putting up a 238-95 (.715) record in league play against every-one other than Alabama and LSU .
Coach Tim Walton and company 
visit Fayetteville, Ark., for a three-game series against the Razorbacks starting today at 8 p.m. Walton said his team’s attitude is a key factor in its SEC success, and with 12 straight wins against Arkansas, UF seems to be on the right track.
“If you have any doubt, you’re 
going to lose,” Walton said. “You have got to maintain your confi-dence. You can’t fear what’s happen-ing in front of you; you can only con-trol what’s happening right now.”
Against the Razorbacks, the 
Gators have notched 32 wins and 
surrendered just 10 losses.
Junior Ensley Gammel said it 
was more fun for the pitchers to play 
against SEC teams because the de-sire to win rises dramatically when facing a familiar foe.
“They react like it’s fun (pitching 
against SEC teams),” Gammel said. “It’s you against the batter. It’s even 
more of a compe-
tition, so you re-ally want to win and prove you are the best.”
Even when 
Florida goes on the road, like it will against Ar -
kansas today , it 
has proven to have just as much suc-cess as at Katie Seashole Stadium.
The Gators are 14-5 at Bogle Sta-
dium, and are 4-1 on the road against SEC opponents this year. 
“It’s always a little bit tougher to play on the road,” junior Kelsey Horton said. “But that’s why they call it home-field advantage. There will be a lot of fans there, but hope-
fully we can just stay relaxed and get 
three wins.”
In Florida’s eight SEC games, the 
Gators have outscored their oppo-nents 32-12. Freshman Lauren Hae-ger has performed even better at the plate against SEC teams, hitting .114 points better than she hits against nonconference opponents.
Last year, the Gators went 21-7 in 
league play , which was good enough for Walton to capture co-SEC Coach of the Year honors. It was his third time winning the award after win-ning it in consecutive years in 2008 and 2009.
Hannah Rogers knows the secret 
to UF’s success against SEC foes.
“I just try to prepare myself men-
tally,” Rogers said. “I don’t think too much is this hitter going to be better than me or not. We have some of the best players in the SEC and in the country . So I just stay confident in my team and myself.”

UF Baseballmakes him Florida’s best and 
most valuable defender. 
His greatness has me con-
ditioned such that when Ju-
nior Cadougan was sprinting 
down the court for an appar -
ent transition layup, I instinc-tively looked for a trailing Beal. I was rewarded with a flying swat sure to find it’s way on to a few highlight reels, as Beal’s right hand sent Cadougan’s shot flying. Beal’s second block was his 31st, one more than Patric Young has this season. 
Beal’s shown scouts ev-
erything they need to see. DraftExpress.com has him as the No. 7 overall prospect, and ESPN’s Chad Ford ranks him No. 4. Both peg him as the No. 1 guard. 
There are a few reasonable 
arguments as to why he could come back. Although he’s curbed the turnover problem of late, his 77 giveaways are still tops on UF’s roster. An-other year as Florida’s best player would give him plenty of opportunity to work on his ballhandling. As recently as Sunday’s game against Norfolk State, Beal was en-trusted with point guard du-ties against a bigger, stronger opponent, and that trend should continue into next season when point guard Er -ving Walker will no longer be 
on the team. 
He might also be con-
vinced another year could 
help his outside shooting touch. Even after Friday’s 3-for-5 showing, he’s still shot just 33.7 percent from outside this season. 
He was expected to be the 
next Ray Allen, but the results from the perimeter haven’t matched. With another year to perfect his stroke, he could enter the NBA after his soph-omore season without a hole in his game. 
But that’s not enough to 
keep him around. Not when he’s being asked to do so much that he’ll never have to worry about again. 
As an NBA two-guard, he 
won’t be relied on to crash the boards as often as he is at UF. More college experience isn’t likely to hurt Beal, but how much will that experi-ence really help when it’s out of position in a three-happy, four-guard system totally for -
eign to the NBA ranks?
Beal already has all of the 
smarts, instincts and feel for the game that talented play-ers make a pit stop in college to learn. 
UF fans need to be ready to 
say good bye, because Beal’s out as soon as the Gators are.

Murphy’s 10 boards lead team effort
the first half with its rebounding, pulling down an 9-5 advantage on the offensive glass which was good for 13 second-chance points com-pared to just two for Florida.
“We knew we had to do a bet-
ter job there,” coach Billy Donovan said. “I told our guys at halftime, with Marquette, they’ve had a lot of comeback victories. They keep com-ing and they keep coming.”
But the Gators fought back, es-
tablishing a team-wide identity for pulling down the rebounds as seven players had three or more rebounds. Florida closed the half on a 9-0 run to establish a 36-30 lead at the break, finally pulling away for its biggest lead of the half thanks to five points and an assist from Brad Beal and a breakaway from Kenny Boynton.  The Gators outrebounded the Eagles 6-2 during the span.
“It’s a team effort when it comes 
to rebounding,” Young said. “That was huge because they had so many points and second-chance opportu-nities coming out of the first half that we had to limit.”
Marquette got back into it with 
six straight points to cut the lead to 48-40 while holding Florida scoreless for more than four minutes. But Erik Murphy , who finished with seven 
points and 10 boards, ended the 
drought with a tough inside bucket 
— the type of uncharacteristic play Florida made all game, and the type of play that made the difference.
“Murphy’s just aggressive on 
both ends of the floor (during the tournament),” Beal said. “Coach has been on his butt about rebounding in practice and it’s just carried over 
into the game.”
Shots weren’t falling all night for 
Crowder, who finished 5 of 15 for 
15 points. He dealt with foul trouble throughout and had multiple shots rattle in and out, as did the entire Marquette team, which took 21 shots from three despite attempting just 16.9 per game entering the game.
Marquette made a late run to 
bring the game as close as 58-52 with 3:18 left, but a three from Erv-ing Walker over Todd Mayo with 2:07 remaining extended Florida’s lead to nine and put the finishing touches on the team’s 26th and most important victory to date.
“One more game to that Final 
Four and to put up another board in our practice facility ,” Young said. “We’re right there. We have to get this next one. We have to.”

After traveling more than 2,094 miles to Boise, Idaho, 
to wrap up the indoor season, the Gators will have a 
short trip this weekend as they travel to Orlando for their first meet of the outdoor season.
Although Florida is coming off an indoor national 
title win for the men and a ninth-place finish for the 
women, both teams will need to put celebrating acco-
lades aside to focus on the UCF Invitational this week-end.
The top-ranked Gators men open their outdoor sea-
son with  Anthony Amodio on pole vault, while the No. 11 women debut with Claire Spurling and Caitlin Schuessler on the pole vault. 
“We can’t get excited about what we did indoors and 
let that keep us from doing what we’re capable of doing 
outdoors,” coach Mike Holloway said.
This is the third consecutive year the men enter the 
outdoor season as the preseason No. 1. However, each 
of the previous two years the men have fallen short of 
finishing the season No. 1, coming in second in 2010 and 
third in 2011 at the NCAA Outdoor Championships.
After winning the Southeastern Conference Indoor 
title and having a top-10 finish at the NCAA meet, the women look like they are heading toward a better finish 
for outdoors than last year’s tie for 34th.
“Hopefully the women recognize what my staff and 
I recognize, which is that we are one of the elite teams in the country ,” Holloway said. 
In addition to having a better start this year with 
the indoor season, the women’s team also features 12 
nationally ranked athletes including Darshay Davis 
(ranked 18th in the 100-meter sprint and 17th in the 
200m), Ebony Eutsey (ranked eighth in the 400m) and 
Brittany Harrell (ranked 11th in the 
heptathalon).
Along with the women, the men’s 
team has 13 nationally ranked ath-letes, including Jeff Demps (100m), Tony Mcquay (400m) and Omar 
Craddock (triple-jump), each of 
whom won individual indoor titles 
earlier this month and enter the out-
door season ranked No. 1 in their respective events.
“When you look at what’s going on here with re-
cruiting over the last few years, we got a great group of 
athletes on both sides,” Holloway said. “What we can’t 
do is say ‘Well we’re going to do well because we’ve got 
great athletes.’ We got to keep coaching; we got to keep training hard.”UF opens outdoor season at UCF

Gators rebound from 
turnovers, mistakes
ages 16.6 forced turnovers per 
game. 
When the Golden Eagles were 
able to hamstring the Gators into one of their 11 giveaways, it usually didn’t take long for the UF player responsible for 
the turnover or one of his team-
mates to right the error.
In a tied game with less than 
five minutes to play in the first 
half, the 5-foot-8 Walker re-
sponded from a carrying call on offense by hauling in a de-fensive rebound on Marquette’s ensuing possession over 6-foot-
1 guard Junior Cadougan. 
Walker was also fouled on 
the play and made a pair of free 
throws at the other end to give 
Florida a 27-25 lead with 4:49 
left in the opening half.
“Against Marquette they’re 
going to turn you over some-
times and there’s going to be 
mistakes in the game,” Walker said. “That’s how they like to play but you’ve got to cause them to make mistakes and just move on to the next play when 
it happens.”The trend spilled over into 
the second half when the Gators 
held a 54-44 lead with 5:47 left to play. During a Marquette possession, Florida withstood 
two offensive rebounds and 
two missed shots by the Gold-en Eagles in a frenzied 20 sec-onds before Beal blocked the third attempt by MU senior Jae 
Crowder.
F l o r i d a ’ s 
Patric Young 
came up with 
one of his nine 
rebounds off the block and opened up a 
fast break op-portunity for Beal at the oth-
er end. 
“Just got in there,” Young 
said. “We knew how great of a loose ball, rebounding team they were and the last few games we have been doing a re-
ally good job rebounding. Our 
guards have been getting in there. I finally got in there and almost got 10.”

� JUNIOR CORNERBACK FOCUSING 
ON FORCING MORE TAKEAWAYS.

 Jaylen Watkins spent his offseason re-
ﬂ  ecting on what he did wrong.
  During a season in which the Gators ﬁ  n-
ished 7-6, Watkins started eight games. He 
ﬁ  nished ninth on the team with 34 tackles and third with ﬁ  ve passes broken up. 
  Still, coaches challenged him because he 
wasn’t physical at the line of scrimmage; they wanted him to become stronger.
  Despite decent numbers, Watkins 
struggled at times in coverage, most nota-bly against Georgia.  
That game, he was beat for a touchdown 
on a fourth-down fade route in the third quarter and then ﬂ  agged for pass interfer-ence on a crucial fourth-down play in the 
fourth as Florida capped a four-game skid 
and fell to .500.
  “My low point was probably the Geor-
gia game,” Watkins said. “I could have made a few better plays that could have 
put us in a better situation in the game, but 
I didn’t.”
  While Watkins came on strong toward 
the end of season — he pointed to a four-
tackle effort in the Florida State game that 
included a tackle for a 12-yard loss as his best performance of the year — he said it was tough trying to adjust to a new defen-sive scheme under coach Will Muschamp 
and defensive coordinator Dan Quinn at 
the beginning of the season. 
  Watkins said the learning curve made 
him a step slower and caused him to think 
too much on defense, at times affecting his 
performance.
  So Watkins spent his offseason in the 
ﬁ  lm room studying tape of 2011 and in the weight room trying to add muscle and be-
come the physical cornerback Muschamp 
wants him to be.  “I’m trying to separate myself as far as 
being physical and trying to create turn-overs,” Watkins said. 
“Those are my two biggest things that 
I didn’t do last year. At times, I wasn’t 
physical, and at times I was right there and 
didn’t make the play. That’s all I focus on now, and it’s starting to turn out good for me.”
  Indeed it has.  Through the ﬁ  rst week of spring prac-
tice, Watkins has stood out to coaches and teammates. 
He also impressed spectators during the 
Gators’ only two open practices of the off-season. During the weekend sessions, Wat-kins intercepted passes and made plays while jamming receivers at the line in an 
attempt to separate himself in a crowded 
secondary that includes sophomores Cody Riggs and Marcus Roberson.
  “That’s what we need is a corner,” safe-
ty Josh Evans said. “We need a shutdown 
corner. Florida is known for cornerbacks, 
so yeah, [Watkins] deﬁ  nitely has the po-tential to do that.”
  Watkins said he is trying to distance 
himself from other defensive backs by fo-cusing more on takeaways, and he isn’t the only one.
  Despite ranking eighth nationally in to-
tal defense, the Gators forced just 14 turn-
overs (eight interceptions and six fumble 
recoveries) in 2011, which ranked tied for 112th out of 120 FBS teams.
  “We watch plays from last year, and it’s 
kind of disappointing when the ball is hit-ting us right in the hands and we’re drop-ping it,” Watkins said.
  Florida’s coaches have put an added 
emphasis on takeaways this spring after 
lackluster results last season.
  According to Evans and Watkins, the 
results are showing when they watch ﬁ  lm, 
as they see every defender trying to reach 
in and strip the ball on any given play. 
Wide receiver Andre Debose added that the defensive backs have been “pests,” constantly trying to rip the ball and force a fumble.
  “When you watch ﬁ  lm all you see is 
guys trying to rip the ball out because that 
was our biggest problem last year,” Wat-kins said. 
“I don’t think we’ve ever had a year 
that low in turnovers.”
