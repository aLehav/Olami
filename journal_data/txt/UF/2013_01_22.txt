Jessa Carpenter sat in a small, 
white-walled room reading “The 
Little Soul and the Sun” to six 
adult males. Two of her listen-
ers rocked back and forth as she spoke.
One frequently pierced the sto-
ry with shrieks. A nurse standing nearby tried to calm him when he repeatedly slapped himself on the head.
Still, Carpenter read on: “You 
are a being of such utter perfec-tion.”
Carpenter, a 26-year-old UF 
student personnel and higher 
education graduate student, was 
one of about 25 students who vis-ited an adults-with-disabilities care center as part of a Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration.
Throughout the city, hundreds 
of Gainesville residents and stu-dents celebrated the holiday by volunteering for local nonproﬁ  t organizations and participating in city-sponsored events.
The Martin Luther King Jr. 
Commission of Florida Inc. or-ganized a series of events down-town, beginning with its annual 
hall of fame enshrinement in the 
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memo-rial Garden near City Hall.
UF’s Center for Leadership 
and Service, Gator Wesley Foun-
dation and Santa Fe College 
planned 12 morning service des-tinations for student volunteers.
The service projects included 
taking care of dogs and cats at the humane society, revitalizing an on-campus reﬂ  ection garden and assembling baskets of food for needy families at the Bread of 
the Mighty Food Bank.

About 20 students involved with Gators 
for Obama packed their bags with winter 
jackets for the president’s inauguration in 
Washington, D.C., this weekend.
Gators for Obama co-chairwoman  
Rachel McGovern, a 20-year-old UF 
political science junior, said the students 
had been thinking about attending the inauguration since Obama was re-elected.
“It’s a nice end to volunteering and 
working so hard,” she said. “It’s been on 
people’s minds since November 6.”
McGovern said she grabbed a ticket to 
the inauguration when her friend’s mom 
bought them. 
She bought the ticket for $60 from 
Ticketmaster.
She said some people ﬂ  ew, and some 
drove up to Washington. McGovern went  in a car with four other 
people about 7 p.m. Friday and drove 
through the night.
While in Washington, D.C., students 
saw the White House, the Capitol and the setup of the inauguration, as well as 
embassies.
On Monday’s crisp morning, an 
estimated 800,000 people ﬁ  lled the 
National Mall for the president’s second inauguration. McGovern woke up at 6 
a.m. to be checked into the inauguration 
two hours later. 
She said she had a clear view of the 
Capitol Building.Gators for Obama travel to presidential inauguration

Caroline Stone compared 
hashtags to parentheses.
“If we’re talking about writing 
… I would say this is honestly like a new type of punctuation,” said the 29-year-old UF doctoral student in media studies.  She said when one writes and uses 
parentheses, it’s used as a side 
thought.
“The hashtag, for a lot of 
young people, is used that way,” 
Stone said.
“Hashtag” was voted as the 
word of the year during the 
American Dialect Society annual voting session earlier this month.“From a societal and cultural 
standpoint, I think it’s a perfect word of the year,” said UF jour-nalism instructor Steve Johnson. “It represents more than just a 
single word.”
The ﬁ  rst high-proﬁ  le hashtag 
appeared on Twitter in 2007, ac-
cording to the Poynter Institute website, and categorizes for the dual function 
of ﬁ  ltering and searching.
Daniel Har-
rison, a 19-year-
old UF mechan-
ical engineering freshman, dis-agreed with the 
ranking of “hashtag” as word of 
the year.
“I really don’t think it’s the 
word of the year — maybe the word of 2010. It’s a little late 
to the game,” he said. “YOLO 
should have been the word of the 
year because it blew up and died down in 2012.”
The word of the year does not 
have to be brand-new, but it has 
to be newly prominent in the past 
year, according to the American Dialect Society’s website.
Word of the year runners-up 
included YOLO, ﬁ  scal cliff, Gang-nam style and marriage equality.Americans vote Twitter term #hashtag as word of the year SEE MLK, PAGE 4

the homeowner on top of a 
nearly naked London on the driveway.The homeowner said he discovered London going 
through his kitchen cabinets

house was vacant, and he had 
used the sauna there in the past.

As a native Floridian, Glenn Stein often 
gets asked how he came to be a polar his-
torian.
“It does seem something of a contradic-
tion,” he said.
Stein, a 1985 UF College of Journalism 
and Communications graduate, spoke in front of 61 people Sunday at the Florida 
Museum of Natural History about the 
2014 Imperial Trans-Antarctic Centenary Expedition, or ITACE.
Stein, who is the United States liaison 
for the British project, said the expedi-tion would be an attempt to recreate Er -
nest Shackleton’s famous failed Antarctic 
crossing of 1914.
“Shackleton was one of the finest ex-
plorers of the Heroic Age,” he said. “After 
all these years, we hopefully will complete what he started.”
During the free event, he spoke for an 
hour about the challenges of the upcom-ing expedition.
The six members of ITACE will attempt 
to cross about 2,000 miles on skis while pulling supply sleds weighing about 330 pounds. During the journey, they are ex-pected to face below-freezing tempera-tures and ice-veiled crevasses hundreds of feet deep.
“Out there, you come face-to-face with yourself,” Stein said.
Another challenge of exploring Antarc-
tica is its isolation, with no permanent hu-man residents, Stein said.
“Antarctica is the only such landmass 
on our planet where human beings have gone and not found our own kind,” he said.
Despite the dangers, 
Stein said Antarctica can also be a place of “un-imaginable beauty.”
The expedition, 
which will cost about $1.5 million, is being funded by private do-nations, Stein said.
Although the expe-
dition won’t embark until fall 2014, those involved are busy with preparations and promotion, he said. The expedition team will also travel to Norway for two weeks 
of training.
Tiffany Ireland, an education assistant 
at the museum, said she thinks ITACE is 
an exciting opportunity.
“They’re pushing the human race far -
ther into discovery,” she said.
Though the expedition will use modern 
equipment and survival techniques, Stein said it would stay true to its historic roots.
“The expedition will breathe new life 
into Shackleton’s family motto,” he said. “‘By endurance, we conquer.’”UF graduate presents on

President Barack Obama receives the oath of office from Chief Justice John Roberts as first lady Mi -
chelle Obama and his daughters, Malia and Sasha, look on at the ceremonial swearing-in at the U.S. 
Capitol during the 57th Presidential Inauguration in Washington on Monday.
They also attended an inaugural ball
During his speech, Obama spoke on behalf of 
the current American generation and its journey 
through the past four years.
“This generation of Americans has been tested 
by crises that steeled our resolve and proved our resilience,” Obama said. “A decade of war is now ending. An economic recovery has begun.”
The speech, which was 15 minutes long, touched 
on health care, the national deficit and gay rights.
Musicians Kelly Clarkson and Beyonce sang at 
the event. 
Richard Blanco, the first Hispanic, openly gay  
inauguration poet, recited his poem “One Today” about the country’s landscape and referenced the Newtown shootings.
“One sky: since the Appalachians and Sierras 
claimed their majesty, and the Mississippi and Colorado worked their way to the sea,” Blanco said. “Thank the work of our hands: weaving steel into bridges, finishing one more report for the boss on time … or the last floor on the Freedom Tower 
jutting into a sky that yields to our resilience.”
Nineteen-year-old UF political science and sustainability studies junior Maria Martinez 
described the experience of standing with thousands of people during the inauguration Monday morning 
as surreal.
“When it really got down to it, it was all really 
worth it once we saw him get [sworn] in,” she said. 
“The cold and the lines were really worth it.”
Martinez said the experience was fulfilling for 
everyone.
“There were tears and laughter and applause, 
and it was really overwhelming,” she said.
McGovern and seven other people attended the 
black-tie Commander-In-Chief Inaugural Ball at the Washington Convention Center. 
The group saw President Obama and first lady 
Michelle Obama dance to Al Green’s “Let’s Stay Together.”
They also watched Vice President Joe Biden and 
his wife, Jill Biden, dance together.
She said the group enjoyed the performances by  
Stevie Wonder, Brad Paisley, Jennifer Hudson and 
Mexican band Mana.
“It’s been more like a concert,” she said.
The group plans to return to Gainesville late 
Tuesday night.

The celebration ended with a gospel program at the MLK rec center
randomly assigned to one of the 
nonprofits, where they worked for about two hours.
Carpenter carpooled along 
with other students to Tacachale Center, located at 1621 NE Waldo Road, to interact with some of the 
35- to 85-year-old disabled adults 
who reside there.
Carpenter and Danielle 
Lespinasse, who both alternated reading sections in the book, 
weren’t phased by the tumultu-
ous story time.
“It was a little challenging 
to read with the interruptions,” said Lespinasse, a 26-year-old  UF clinical psychology graduate student. “You just had to push 
through the screaming and the 
hitting.”
Adam Gerstenfeld stood 
across the hallway in the music 
room, playing chords on an elec-
tric keyboard as an elderly resi-dent swayed back and forth in his chair.
Gerstenfeld, an 18-year-old 
telecommunication freshman who plays clarinet in the UF Fightin’ Gator Marching Band, said he doesn’t know how to play 
the piano but was willing to tin-
ker with the instrument to bring enjoyment to the residents.“I like being around these peo-
ple,” he said. “It’s relaxing.”
Holly Spence sat at a table in a 
next-door art room. 
She helped a resident brush 
a white canvas cowboy hat with bright green paint.
“I love green,” the resident 
said, looking fondly at the hat. “I’m going to wear it when the paint dries.”He abruptly stood up and be-
gan performing a rendition of a hula dance and transitioned into 
Michael Jackson’s Moonwalk.
“You know more dances than I 
do,” Spence, 20, exclaimed.
Willingness to reach out is the 
key to thriving in a volunteer 
situation like Tacachale, Gersten-feld said.
“You kind of have to let your 
guard down and not be afraid to 
test your boundaries,” he said.
The celebration ended that 
afternoon after the King Celebra-
tion Annual Commemorative 
March with a gospel program at 
the MLK Multipurpose Recre-ation Center, located at 1028 NE 14th St.
Volunteering Monday gave 
students and residents a chance 
to break out of their comfort 
zones in the spirit of King.
Brittany Hronek, a UF health 
science sophomore, said people 
shouldn’t only volunteer on spe-cial occasions. But she said the hol-iday helped students get out and participate.
“I think it’s good to do com-
munity service in general,” the 
19-year-old said. “I think it’s 
good to give back to the com-munity, especially on a holiday when we don’t have school.”

There’s a new “boobment” 
sweeping across universities. 
Honing in on football and 
sexual fantasy, a new twitter 
account, @UF_Boobs, is leav-
ing football players and fans 
panting.
The trend started as #ku-
boobs at the University of Kansas. Other schools soon jumped on the bandwagon, including UF, to show some cleavage.
“Representing the best 
boobs in the SEC,” according to the account, the new page has tweeted about 3,600 times and has gained about 2,900 followers who want to catch a glimpse.
Another account associ-
ated with the Gators, @Gator -
boobs, has also sprung up on 
the Web, posting pictures of 
women to its 1,000 followers since Jan. 15.
Schools with similar ac-
counts include the University of Alabama, Auburn Univer -
sity, University of Arkansas, Vanderbilt University and Florida State University. 
Although other accounts 
post pictures of anonymous women from the neck down sporting school logos, @UF_Boobs posts pictures of women with their faces while 
they wear outfits that some-
times don’t adorn the Gators orange and blue.
@UF_Boobs declined to 
comment via Twitter.
Dana Fletcher, a 20-year-
old UF psychology senior, said she thinks girls who sub-mit photos to the account are 
“looking for approval and in-
stant gratification.”
“They are not thinking 
long term,” she said.Hannah Becker, a 21-year-
old UF political science and 
psychology senior, agreed.
Becker, who is applying 
for graduate school, said it’s 
important to know what will be the first thing employers and schools see when they Google a person’s name.
“Girls have the right, but 
I think it’s bizarre to want to 
post this,” she said.
Considering how popular 
Twitter is, she said, the fol-
lowing will grow.
UF social media specialist 
Bruce Floyd said social me-dia makes pictures or posts very easy for people to share, which could catch on unex-
pectedly.
“Suddenly your potential 
boss sees it, or your parents 
see it,” he said. “Just because you are posting to friends doesn’t mean it will stay amongst friends.”
Floyd said any image on 
the Internet has the potential 
to go viral. 
“You are what you tweet,” 
he said. “Once you post on-
line, it’s there. Even if you get rid of it, it’s still out there.”
Derrick Ross, a 21-year-old 
UF mechanical engineering senior, said he heard of the trending “boobment.” 
Ross said although the 
account could be all in good fun, he wouldn’t take part.
Dan Harcha, a 23-year-old 
UF mechanical engineering 
senior, shared the same views 
as Ross.
Harcha said people have 
to think before posting pic-tures of themselves online.
“You need to think of 
the consequences,” he said. “Things will follow you.”

As Sweetbay supermarkets 
across Florida prepare to close in 
February, Gainesville’s store re-
mains in business.
The Tampa-based supermarket 
chain announced Wednesday it 
will be closing 33 underperforming 
stores across the state, as well as 
the pharmacy at its Bonita Springs location, in mid-February.
“Those stores just weren’t meet-
ing sales expectations,” said Sweet-
bay spokeswoman Nicole LeBeau.
All of the company’s 105 stores 
operate in Florida. The remaining 
72 stores will stay open after the 
statewide closing, which will lay off about 2,000 workers, according to a company press release.
LeBeau said the closures will 
help the company’s portfolio and 
accelerate shareholder value.
As a publicly held company, 
Sweetbay doesn’t release sales fig-ures, she said.
Although the company encour -
ages employees to apply for open 
positions at remaining stores, Le-
Beau said it would pay severance for unemployed workers.
She could not provide further 
details about the pay due to the “sensitivity of the issue.”
Employees at the Gainesville 
store, 2002 SW 34th St., made the cut. The store’s 24/7 schedule of-
ten comes in handy for students 
living nearby.
Arnold Sullivan, a 19-year-old 
UF electrical engineering sopho-more, lives close to Publix, but 
when he needs to go grocery shop-
ping in the middle of the night, he goes to Sweetbay.
“It seems pretty popular when-
ever I go there, even at 2 a.m.,” Sullivan said. “If they were both 
equidistant, I might go to Sweet-
bay more.”TUESDAY, JANUARY 22, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 5

have chosen to live on campus as in prior years, wrote Carolynn Komanski, assistant director of administrative services for UF’s Department of Housing and Residence Edu-cation, in an email.
“Our residents enjoy options and the free-
dom to self-select their housing and having the opportunity to live in a different commu-
nity if they choose to live with us again,” she 
wrote.
The housing department does not require 
any student to live on campus. Students who chose to recontract  for the 2013 - 2014 school 
year, beginning in August, will be able to 
start choosing a room Wednesday, according to the housing department website.
Noa Marks, a 19-year old accounting 
sophomore, will be living in a residential hall for her third consecutive year.
She said many students choose to remain 
on campus because they find organizations to become involved in during their first year. They feel they can be a more integral part of 
those activities if they live on campus.
Jennifer Garrido said on-campus living 
provides a much more social atmosphere.
“The residence halls are great to meet new 
people,” the 18-year-old exploratory fresh-
man said. “I live in Jennings this year, and 
I have met so many amazing people by just 
walking around the lobby or watching TV in the common areas.”Room-choosing begins Wednesday for on-campus renewals

101 TOTAL VOTESGun control debate: Murder is avoidable
In the debate over gun control, one of the ideas I keep see-
ing come up is that in homicide situations, the weapon is 
often a moot point.
If a person was intent on killing another person but 
didn’t have a gun, he or she would just use another weapon, like a knife, instead. The idea of trying to keep guns out of 
the hands of certain people is a useless tactic in trying to 
cut down the murder rate, because the person would simply turn to other means.
Leaving the rest of the gun control debate, I’m here to 
make the argument that a person having easy access to a 
gun makes all the difference. But to do this, I am going to 
make a parallel case to another situation: suicide. Stay with me here. I’ll explain.
Now, admittedly , the acts of homicide and suicide have 
little to do with one another, except we could all probably 
agree we wish neither of those groups had been in a situa-
tion necessary to commit either.
When civic groups lobby a city to put a suicide barrier on 
its bridges, opponents of the plan say the barrier is a moot 
point. They say that instead of jumping off a bridge, suicidal 
people will just ﬁ  nd other ways to end their life. They argue that although the barrier may prevent suicides off that par-
ticular bridge, the overall suicide rate won’t go down. 
It’s a good thought, but studies and situations have 
proved it wrong. 
One of the most dramatic examples is the British coal gas 
story.
Before the 1970s in Britain, ovens were powered by coal-
derived gas that produced a lot of deadly carbon monox-ide if there was an open valve. To stick your head in the oven and run the gas became the most common method of 
suicide (remember Sylvia Plath?), with numbers upward of 2,500 deaths a year.
But in the 1970s, the British government changed out coal 
gas with natural gas, and a funny thing happened. Suicide 
rates plummeted by a third and have stayed around that 
level since. 
This was all because an easy means to death was taken away. People couldn’t end their 
lives impulsively without second 
thoughts. If they still meant to go through with it, they would have 
to ﬁ  nd a harder way, and judg-
ing by the numbers, it’s clear that 
most never bothered to.
By removing a means to an 
end, Britain effectively reduced the end result, and this process 
has been aptly titled “means reduction.”
Taking means reduction back to accessibility to guns, I 
need to make a couple of things clear.
Gun control will never prevent  homicides by people ex-
tremely determined to commit them. But in cases of sponta-
neous impulse and anger, not having an extremely straight-
forward, extremely lethal tool in a person’s hand could save 
lives in the end. We have to look at this “intent creates the 
weapon” logic backward.
What if having guaranteed access to a weapon gives 
more determination to the intent?
It could be argued that New York adopted a means re-
duction strategy by passing some of the most restrictive gun control laws in the nation.  
This year, New York’s police commissioner said, “We’re 
taking 8,000 weapons annually out of the hands of people 
we stop, 800 of them illegal handguns. We’re preventing 
crimes before someone is killed and before someone else has 
to go to prison for murder or other serious crimes.” 
Controversial?
Ridiculously so, but it didn’t stop New York from hav-
ing the lowest reported number of murders this year since 
1963. 
Whether you agree or disagree, I hope these thoughts 
give you a new perspective when someone says murder is inevitable regardless of the weapon.
Lauren Flannery is a business administration sophomore at 
UF. Her column runs on Tuesdays.Party 24/7: 
Our leaders are the 
coolest dudes
Joe Biden is a national treasure, and please don’t ever for-
get that.
He is exactly like everyone’s crazy Uncle Joe, the guy who 
stays too long at family parties but still tells pretty funny stories 
at the dinner table, so you let it slide. He’s the waiter at a nice restaurant who checks up on you way too often but then draws a caricature of you on a napkin. He’s that one animal at a petting 
zoo who pays too much attention to you but then it does a really 
cool trick anyway.
This week, President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe 
Biden took their inaugural oaths, signaling the start of their sec-ond term. Let that soak in, because those two are a pretty cool team of world leaders.
After Obama ﬁ  nished the ceremony on Sunday, he said to his 
daughter Sasha, “I did it.”
“You didn’t mess up,” she said, according to ABC News.
What a cool family . The relationship Obama has with his 
wife and daughters is honestly inspiring. We hope those girls 
are growing up as normally as possible. It’s probably difﬁ  cult to have a normal childhood when your home is the White House and a ton of people hate your dad for no reason.
We guess their lives are basically nothing like the plot of “My 
Date With the President’s Daughter,” an oft-forgotten Disney Channel movie. Maybe in a couple of years.
They also get to hang out with, we hope, their own crazy 
Uncle Joe. Biden lets biker chicks sit on his lap in diners on the  campaign trail. He uses curse words on national television. He’s the coolest.
This week, he personally used his Twitter account to interact 
with The Onion’s parody version of the VP . The tweet read: “Q for @reddit AMA with my @TheOnion pal: A Trans-Am? Ever look under the hood of a Corvette? #imavetteguy –VP”
Not only did he write the post himself, something we imag-
ine his team of advisers rarely allows him to do (if they’re smart), 
but he correctly wrote it. He tagged the other users and even 
made his own hashtag. The original tweet included a picture of the vice president looking at a shiny, red Corvette.
“Diamond Joe” is often featured on The Onion as an ex-
tremely caricatured version of Biden. We just imagine it’s the true Biden coming out.
Sure, Diamond Joe was only doing an AMA (“Ask Me 
Anything”) on Reddit to promote The Onion’s new book “The President of Vice: The Autobiography of Joe Biden,” but can you 
blame them? 
Who wouldn’t want to parody Biden in such an accurate 
way?
We’re not sure if the vice president necessarily conducts him-
self in a way that earns him a lot of respect, but we do know he’s 
the dude a heartbeat away from the presidency.
Whether it’s your crazy Uncle Joe, Diamond Joe or Mr. Bro 
Biden, we should take some time to admire a leader who is goofy and who still gets stuff done. He can crack jokes on Twit-
ter (when he’s allowed) and sort of push through important leg-
islation.
Kudos, Joe.

The U.S. government is just like a profes-
sional wrestling production.
Let’s get some terms out of the way . 
In wrestling, a “face” is a good guy , a “heel” is a bad guy , a “mark” is someone who thinks 
the production is real, a “smart” is someone 
who knows it’s fake, a “smark” is a combina-tion of smarts and marks who know it’s for en-tertainment and watch for the spectacle, and a “push” is when the production tries to solidify a wrestler. 
As I listed those terms, some people prob-
ably thought of their own politicians. Marks compare with those who vote purely on party 
line without researching issues, smarts vote 
based on as much of the information they have at hand, and smarks will probably do research but vote on party ideals. Campaigns and ral-lies are pushed by the party to get its candi-date into ofﬁ  ce.
Some politicians even have wrestling coun-
terparts.President Barack Obama is the govern-
ment’s John Cena, performing as the long-term face of the production in contests where the public cheers not for him or for his oppo-nent but merely in support of or against him.
Ronald Reagan is The Rock — a superstar 
in his prime but now just a gimmick for those who were fans back in the day to parade as 
one of the best.
Lobbyists as a whole can be Ted DiBiase, 
Vince McMahon or any other heel whose en-
tire shtick is being a jerk with money.
The dreaded ﬁ  libuster is a chair shot, or a 
bone-jarring move that kills almost every at-tempt to pass legislation. An impeccably per-formed speech can be a ﬁ  nishing move, effec-tively ending a race for ofﬁ  ce.
The different ways to handle a veto can be 
called the Five Moves of Doom.  The Fiscal Cliff? Easily a pay-per-view title. We can even borrow the WWE’s Million-Dollar Champion-ship.The presidential election? WrestleMania, 
and the main event is a tag-team contest. A moderator, who abused his or her power in a debate, is getting a referee involved.
A senator’s tweet put him in a compromis-
ing position? It’s like a superstar getting sus-pended for a wellness policy violation.
Wrestling and politics even intersect some-
times. Jesse V entura went from wrestler to commentator to mayor, culminating in a stint as governor of Minnesota. Linda McMahon built WWE, alongside the rest of the McMa-hon family, but she lost two bids to become a Connecticut senator.
Back in 2008, during the Democratic pri-
maries, WWE got into the game when it aired parts of a video-game-simulated match be-tween Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. The “Smackdown Your Vote!” initiative was a push by WWE to get young voters involved in politics.
The problem is wrestling is scripted, and the results usually don’t affect the rest of the world out-side the squared circle. The decision on who gets a title belt doesn’t impact a promotion in Ja-
pan. Our politics are 
greatly inﬂ  uential to 
the rest of the world, which is why it’s embar-rassing to see our government reduced to a male-oriented soap opera.
I’m a huge fan of wrestling, and I thor-
oughly enjoy politics, too. I shouldn’t like them both because they’re the same thing. At this rate, we’re going to see Joe Biden take on 
John Boehner in a steel cage.
And I would pay money for that.

Thirteen-year-old Michael Sayeski sat in front 
of a blank canvas with tubes of purple and brown 
paint. He painted inside the lines of an ice cream cone outline.
Sweet Dreams hosted a Dance Marathon fund-
raiser at its new location, 1040 E. University Ave., Monday from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m.
About four families came to the Gainesville ice 
cream shop to participate in creating ice cream- themed artwork. Pieces will be hung in Sweet Dreams and auctioned off starting at $15 until March 20.
Nicole Martinez, a UF advertising junior and 
the public relations overall chair for Dance Mara-
thon, said all the artwork’s proceeds and 20 percent of Sweet Dreams’ proceeds sold during the event 
will go toward Dance Marathon, a 26.2 hour event where more than 800 students stay on their feet to raise awareness for Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals.
Michael was diagnosed with a brain tumor at 
age 2. At 4 years old, he began chemotherapy for four hours each week. Michael’s mother, Eileen Sayeski, 47, said he benefitted a lot from the games that Dance Marathon provided to the hospital.
“These young adults are amazing,” she said. “It’s 
great that they want to get involved in something that’s bigger than themselves.”
This will be Michael’s eighth year attending 
Dance Marathon.
“We want to give them as much of a normal 
childhood as we possibly can,” Martinez, 20, said.

Focused on his education 
at Tulane University, Lt. Lin-
coln Schneider tucked away his interest in joining the Navy , believing it was a missed op-
portunity.
Now, more than 10 years 
later, Schneider, a 2010 UF 
Levin College of Law gradu-
ate, is being recognized as one of the Navy’s 2012 Recruiters of 
the Year.
This month, the Navy Re-
cruiting Command honored 13 of their top active and reserve 
recruiters from around the world. Among them is 32-year-old Schneider, the Active Offi-cer Recruiter of the Year, who has helped about 48 students get jobs during his career.
“It’s an amazing honor,” 
Schneider said. “It’s great to 
be a — hopefully — good rep-
resentative of the Navy and all the wonderful leaders and mo-tivators we have throughout the fleet.”
Through a recruitment 
email he received while at Tu-lane, Schneider was presented with an opportunity he didn’t know was available. He joined the Navy in 2001.
Knowing the impact that 
email had on him, he takes pride in helping fellow Gators get jobs in the field as a UF re-cruiting officer, focusing on recruiting for areas such as the Navy Medical Corps, Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program and Judge Advocate General’s 
Corps.
Dubbing himself a “double 
Gator,” Schneider is working 
on earning his Master of Public Health degree, hoping to work in the Navy’s hospitals when he graduates in May 2014. 
“[The Navy] is a culture of 
leadership,” Schneider said. 
Schneider has an office 
downtown and in the College of Engineering, where he meets with recruitment candidates four days a week for physical training.
Currently , he is working 
with nine selected collegiates to ensure they graduate on time 
and earn their full tuition. 
“He’s very hands-on — you 
can tell he cares very much,” 
said Jason Roberts, a past colle-giate who graduated in 2012.
Roberts, a 23-year-old UF 
mechanical and aerospace engineer graduate, said that Schneider has not had a single 
candidate who has not made it 
through to officer.
“He does a really good job 
with the program and manag-ing us all, making sure none of us fall behind,” Roberts said. “He always wants to keep in touch and know how we’re do-ing.”
Most of his past recruits 
have brought him their com-mand, or challenge, coin from candidate school, a tradition in the Navy as a way of honoring someone. 
“It’s something that I’ll carry 
with me forever,” he said.Gator named one of

 � HOME-GAME TICKETS ARE ON SALE.

When Gainesville residents jot down items 
to buy at Walmart, they can now include 
Gators basketball tickets on their shopping lists.
As of last week, tickets to all of the Gators 
men’s basketball home games became avail-able in-store. Customers can print out the tick-ets at a Ticketmaster kiosk in the electronics department and pay for them at the register.
The Walmart-Ticketmaster partnership has 
been offering discounts on tickets to events such as concerts since last year, said Walmart corporate spokeswoman Veronica Marshall.
Marshall said the men’s basketball tickets 
purchased through Walmart are in a reserved block in the Stephen C. O’Connell Center. Customers can buy individual tickets to any 
of the home games. For the Jan. 30 and Mar. 
6 games, customers can purchase a bundle of four for $36.
Because UF students have free access to games with a Gator 1 Card, Dean Maassen, a 22-year-old biochemistry and botany fresh-
man, said the Walmart ticket option is of no 
consequence to students.
Shamica Douglas, a 27-year-old lab analy-
sis tech at Shands at UF, said the Walmart op-tion caters to the group of people who would actually benefit from the kiosk — families who are already in the store buying everyday ne-
cessities.
“It’s a family package — very convenient,” 
she said.
Mark Gajda, the assistant athletics director 
for the University Athletic Association at UF, 
said the Walmart-Ticketmaster partnership isn’t hurting business for UF. 
In fact, he said, it is working with the ticket 
office to bring in a broader audience.
“We are trying to bring new fans who may 
be living in outlying areas into the O’Dome to watch a basketball game,” said Gajda.Walmart now selling men’s basketball tickets using kiosk

The 2013 Nonprofit Expo, which  
took place Sunday at the Hilton UF 
Conference Center, taught people  about local nonprofit organizations and opportunities to better the com-
munity.
Armed with Kit Kat bars and Re-ese’s, Ashlynn Davis and her moth-
er, Carlarta Baskin, told passers-by about the Pink Wish Foundation.
With a purple bow in her hair, 
Ashlynn, 9, explained to attendees how the organization improves the 
lives of young women and girls in 
school through different programs.
Baskin said it was their first time 
at the expo.“We have met a lot of people,” 
she said. “It has been a great net-working opportunity.”
Attendees learned about vol-
unteer opportunities from about 27 organizations, including Haven 
Hospice, No More Homeless Pets 
and Cinema Verde.
Kari Brill, director of business 
and program development at the Nonprofit Center of North Central Florida, said she was excited about the amount of people who showed up.
“The people attending are very 
passionate and are taking the time to volunteer,” she said. “There have been a ton of students.”
Maddie Camp, a 21-year-old 
UF sociology senior, said she went to the expo to look for a chance to volunteer. 
After walking from table to 
table, she said Habitat for Human-ity was the first organization she noticed but wanted to explore other options.
“I’m excited to learn more about 
all of them,” she said.
With the success of the expo, 
Brill said she would like to hold the event every January as a way to 
educate the public about local non-
profits.
“There’s a ton of great organiza-
tions that people can learn about,” she said, “and we want to bring awareness to them.”Nonprofit Expo showcases local volunteering opportunities“It’s a family package — very

Researchers may have found 
a way for people to eat sweet 
food without adding sugar.
Linda Bartoshuk, the direc-
tor of Human Research at UF’s 
Center for Smell and Taste, dis-
covered the secret to sweetness is not sugar but volatiles. They are compounds of flavor that can be sniffed, like perfume.
“People love sugar,” Bar -
toshuk said. “My interest is in getting people to eat healthier di-ets. But it’s very hard to acquire a 
taste for vegetables.”
Bartoshuk worked with to-
mato expert Harry Klee and pro-
fessors David Clark and Charles Sims.
Lately , tomato growers have 
not been emphasizing flavor, Sims said. Bartoshuk said toma-toes are composed of volatiles, sugars and acids. Tomatoes have about 60 different volatiles, and 
about six of them are significant-
ly sweeter than the rest.
The researchers evaluated 
79 types of tomatoes, using sta-tistical analysis to compare the chemical makeup of the fruit against the sugar and volatile content. Tomatoes high in sugar were not necessarily tastier.
Essentially , the answer to 
making any tomato better was to make the good volatiles more in-tense and take the bad ones out.
The team is now testing its re-
sults of volatile-enhanced sweet-ness on strawberries.
Bartoshuk said these sweet 
volatiles can be added to other 
foods to make them taste sweet 
without adding sugar.
“As far as we can tell,” Bar -
toshuk said, “this is about as safe a way to add sweet as you could imagine.”UF researchers

World-renowned peace activist 
the Rev. Joan Campbell spoke to 
about 100 students, faculty mem-bers and Gainesville residents at Santa Fe College’s Fine Arts Hall 
on Friday night.
Humanities and foreign lan-
guage department chair Bill Little 
gave an introduction before Camp-bell took the stage. He presented a two-minute video featuring stu-dents and faculty of SFC speaking about the Charter for Compassion in 17 languages.
In her speech, Campbell, who 
co-authored the charter, explained how Karen Armstrong, another co-author, came up with the idea.
In 2002, the Chautauqua Insti-
tution covered aspects of Islam for nine weeks.
After its members encountered 
prejudice in the study due to the 
9/11 terrorist attacks, Armstrong 
decided that something needed to change. The charter was created, and its focus was compassion.“The principle of compassion 
lies at the heart of all religions,” she said Friday, “ethical and spiri-tual traditions, calling us always to treat all others as we wish to be treated ourselves.”
Campbell also recounted her 
experiences working with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. decades 
earlier.
“His witness to nonviolence 
was life-changing for many and in 
my own case, completely changed my life,” she said. “He was, in my life, the essence of a compassion-ate life.”
Campbell’s speech concluded 
with a prayer she wrote. She also asked the audience to sing along to a part of “America the Beauti-ful.”
SFC President Jackson Sasser 
was invited on stage to become 
part of about 90,000 people and organizations that have signed the 
Charter for Compassion.
“I think this has been a signa-
ture moment in the life of this in-stitution,” he said.
There was a 15-minute Q-and-
A portion afterward. 
One attendee asked Camp-
bell whether she believed King 
thought he would die in his work.
She said yes.
The night before he died, King 
told her and the rest of the group that if he did not make it, they should continue the fight for civil rights, Campbell said.
“The hardest questions that re-
porters always asked me was if I 
thought he had to die in order for 
the civil rights movement to make the progress it made,” she said. “My answer was yes, his sacrifice is what saved it, I think.”
Afterward, the audience 
stepped out to have a meet-and-greet with Campbell.
“We’re in a very divided time, 
so my hope would be that some-how by understanding the Charter of Compassion,” she said, “they would see the possibility of people working together, instead of being in their own little turf and always working against each other.”Activist shares civil rights compassion
“The hardest questions 
that reporters always asked 
me was if I thought he had 
to die in order for the civil 
rights movement to make 
the progress it made.”

Is the Florida men’s basketball team worthy of the nation’s top ranking?

 Scottie Wilbekin recorded 13 points and 
10 assists on Saturday for the ﬁ  rst double-
double of his college career, but the junior 
point guard’s lockdown defense on Missouri 
guard Phil Pressey drew more attention.  
  Wilbekin limited Pressey, the Southeast-
ern Conference Preseason Player of the Year, to two points on 1-of-7 shooting as the No. 8 Gators (14-2, 4-0 SEC) cruised to an 83-52 
win against the No. 22 Tigers. Wilbekin and 
Florida’s big men took the 5-foot-11 Pressey out of his comfort zone, eliminating his pick-and-roll options and lanes to the basket. 
  With the 6-foot-2 Wilbekin breathing 
down his neck, Pressey committed a career-high 10 turnovers.
  “Every time I’m playing against some-
body who’s obviously a well-known, good 
player, it’s a personal challenge for me,” 
Wilbekin said. “But it’s also a challenge for the rest of the team, because we don’t just play one-on-one defense. … When I’m 
guarding guys on the pick and roll, [center 
Patric Young] and (forward) Will (Yeguete), they’re one of the best in the NCAA at hedg-ing on screens and giving me help if I’m beat.”
  Over the past month, Wilbekin has lived 
up to the “Basketball Honey Badger” label Young gave him earlier this season.
  During UF’s 68-47 victory against Texas 
A&M on Thursday, Wilbekin held Elston Turner to four points on 1-of-10 shooting. In 
Turner’s previous outing against Kentucky, 
the Aggies guard scored 40 points on 14-of-19 shooting. 
  In games Wilbekin has played this season, 
the Gators have contained opposing starting guards to only 34.1 percent shooting. 
  “He’s made our defense a lot better, be-cause he has really good feet and he can move his feet and keep people in front,” coach Billy Donovan said. “He’s a physical 
guard where he’s a hard guy to screen. If he 
does get screened, he’s got a great ability to get around off contact and get back on the ball.” 
  After completing his junior year of high 
school, Wilbekin enrolled at Florida and played his ﬁ  rst two seasons at Florida as a backup to starting point guard Erving Walk-er, UF’s all-time assists leader. 
  Wilbekin began the 2012-13 season on a 
sour note, as Donovan suspended him for three games due to undisclosed reasons. But Wilbekin has rebounded since his rough 
start. 
  Wilbekin has started in nine of 14 con-tests, averaging 8.3 points, 4.9 assists and 1.9 
steals per game. He tallied 2.5 points, 1.6 as-
sists and 0.8 steals per game in his ﬁ  rst two 
seasons.
  This year, his shooting percentage is at a 
career-best 44.9 percent. 
  “I think, a lot of times, some of the great-
est growth and development outcomes through when you have setbacks or make mistakes,” Donovan said. “Because of that, I think it has made him a better player. It 
forced him to maybe look at life and his bas-
ketball career playing here at Florida, being here at Gainesville, maybe a little differently than he ever had before.”
  Wilbekin’s teammates also notice his de-
velopment — especially on the defensive end. His improvement has even generated national buzz.
  “He’s probably the best point guard de-
fender in the SEC,” said ESPN analyst Jim-my Dykes, who called Saturday’s contest. “Your defense starts at that spot.”
  Following Saturday’s game, Young, who 
played two seasons with Walker, called 
Wilbekin the best point guard he has ever 
played with. Senior forward Erik Murphy shared Young’s sentiments.
  “It’s unbelievable,” Murphy said. “The 
guy just comes out and guards relentless. I don’t think I’ve ever played with a guy who can guard on the ball like that at any level — 
high school, AAU or college.” 
  
  Prather out: Casey Prather, who suffered a 
high left ankle sprain in a 74-52 win against LSU on Jan. 12, will miss Florida’s road 
matchups against Georgia on Wednesday 
and Mississippi State on Saturday. 
  The junior forward took off his walking 
boot and began rehab Sunday. Donovan said 
Monday that Prather would be reevaluated 
in about six days.
  In 10 games this season, Prather has 6.8 
points and 3.3 rebounds, both career bests.

END OF GREGULATION
  While mostly meaning-
less until the end of the season, the AP poll is a 
solid test of media intelligence. 
  Are the voters smart enough 
to base their decisions on ad-vanced metrics and quality of 
play? Or are they just going to 
put the teams with 15 wins ahead of the teams with 14 wins and call it a day?
  Monday’s latest poll release 
gave us an answer, and it wasn’t pretty. Florida checked in at No. 8.  Because of what they’ve ac-
complished in terms of efﬁ  cien-cy, quality losses and dominant wins, the Gators deserve to be No. 1. 
  Florida leads the KenPom 
rankings by a wide margin.
For the uninitiated, statisti-
cian, Ken Pomeroy ranks teams based on their efﬁ  ciency — 
points scored or allowed per 100 
possessions on both offense and defense — and then adjusts those values to reﬂ  ect each team’s level of competition.In my eyes, his ranking system 
vastly outpaces every traditional method.  
  This season, Florida is cruis-
ing. The gap between UF and second-place Louisville is bigger than the gap between Louisville 
and KenPom No. 5 Michigan.
Nationally, Florida ranks No. 
1 in defensive efﬁ  ciency and No. 
2 in offensive efﬁ  ciency.  
  The Gators have a lot of season 
left to play, but only one team in the past 10 years has ﬁ  nished in the top 3 in both offensive and defensive efﬁ  ciency. In 2008, na-
tional champion Kansas placed 
ﬁ  rst on defense and second on offense. 
  Detractors cite Florida’s two 
losses — road tilts against Ari-
zona and Kansas State. 
  After losing 65-64 to Arizona 
on Dec. 15, Florida dropped from 
No. 5 to No. 8 in the AP poll. Ari-
zona jumped from No. 8 to No. 
4. 
  The Gators took the lead with 
17:31 remaining in the ﬁ  rst half and held it until Mark Lyons hit a layup with 7 seconds  
left in the 
game.
Flor-
ida led 
by six 
and had 
a 98 percent chance of victory with 56 seconds remaining before three turnovers and a missed free 
throw proved costly.

Poll Results
Will Kenny Boynton break the Florida 
school record for career points?63% YES
37% NO
58 total votesThe odds of any team all sea-
son coming that close to win-
ning a game without getting the 
job done are very, very low. And 
Florida did it on the road against a top-10 team. As first pointed out by Pome-
roy on Twitter, 64 of 65 AP voters ranked Arizona ahead of Florida in the next poll, basically saying home court advantage doesn’t exist. 
To me, losing such a close 
game to such a good team on the road is the same as a win. Florida’s other loss is less ex-
cusable, but Kansas State is solid. KSU’s only two losses are away from home against Gonzaga and Michigan, both of which are le-gitimate Final Four contenders. 
Florida missed some shots it 
normally hits, and Kansas State made some shots it normally misses.
The Wildcats’ pressure pushed 
the Gators into a few bad shot choices, and Kansas State got hot from outside. It happens. 
After all, nobody is undefeat-
ed. No. 1 Duke lost on the road to N.C. State. No. 2 Michigan lost at Ohio State. Co-No. 3 Kansas lost to Michigan State at a neutral site. 
Co-No. 3 Syracuse lost to Temple 
at a neutral site. No. 6 Arizona lost on the road to Oregon.
Are any of those losses really 
that much more respectable than 
UF’s loss to Kansas State? 
The other teams ranked ahead 
of Florida — No. 5 Louisville and 
No. 7 Indiana — have two losses. 
The Gators really set them-
selves apart through their domi-nant wins. None of Florida’s 14 victories have come by less than 13 points. UF has six wins against 
teams in the KenPom top 100. 
The Gators’ average margin of victory in those games is an as-tounding 24.8 points. 
Each of the teams ranked 
ahead of Florida in the AP poll has at least six top-100 wins, and all but Indiana have more. Kan-sas leads the way with 10, and 
the Jayhawks also lead the AP 
top seven with an 18.9-point av-erage margin of victory in those wins. But Kansas’ eight-point 
win against Iowa State on Jan. 9 
came in overtime, so that skews the numbers a little bit. 
Knock Florida’s top-100 win 
total if you want, but UF can only play the teams on its schedule.  
To this point, the Gators have 
been more dominant in those games than any other team in col-lege basketball.

Florida shot a season-low 
29.8 percent from the floor on 
Sunday , but the cold shooting 
was not what fired up coach 
Amanda Butler.
Butler was annoyed with 
her team’s inability to efficient-ly battle on the boards with a physical No. 19 South Carolina 
team.
Coming into the game, South 
Carolina was the best rebound-
ing squad in the Southeastern 
Conference, outrebounding 
opponents by an average of 11.2 boards per game. 
The trend continued Sun-
day. 
The Gamecocks used a 59-41 
advantage on the glass to notch a 52-44 victory in the O’Connell Center, denying the Gators an 
important conference win and 
leaving Butler exasperated with her team’s performance. 
“You have to give South 
Carolina a lot of credit,” Butler 
said. “They played very tough. 
Obviously , it was their No. 1 agenda item to outrebound us, and they did that and then some.”
Butler spent the week pre-
paring for South Carolina by urging her team to play with increased toughness and use better decision-making. 
Florida turned the ball over 
just nine times, yet Butler was still displeased with her team’s indecision to play aggressively , particularly following missed 
shots. 
“We gave up 26 offensive 
rebounds, so I think there’s a 
lack of toughness,” Butler said. 
“Some of the times, it was poor 
decision-making. I think, of-fensively , our problems were very similar to our rebounding problems — we just weren’t physical enough.”
The Gators played without 
senior Jennifer George, who missed the game due to lin-gering effects from two dislo-cations of her right shoulder 
suffered during the past two 
weeks.
George’s 13.4 points and 8.5 
rebounds per contest lead the 
team. 
South Carolina coach 
Dawn Staley was pleased to 
see George out of the lineup. In two matchups against the 
Gamecocks last season, George 
averaged 16.5 points and 10.5 rebounds per game. 
Staley was well aware of the 
void in Florida’s lineup.
“I was kind of happy she 
wasn’t able to play because she gets double-doubles on us ev-ery single time we play them,” Staley said. “We did feel like 
we did have the advantage in-
side.” 
Sophomore Aleighsa Welch 
paced the Gamecocks with 12 
rebounds. Eight of those came 
on the offensive end, includ-ing a critical rebound following Ashley Bruner’s missed free throw with 31 seconds remain-
ing in the second half and South 
Carolina leading 46-42. 
The Gamecocks shot a desti-
tute 23.4 percent from the floor 
and finished just 17 of 33 from 
the foul line but benefited from their dominance on the glass.  
“[Welsh is] the best in our 
league at getting offensive re-
bounds,” Staley said. “She’s 
got great timing, and she’s re-lentless.” Butler was less satisfied with 
the performance of her players, offering pointed criticism at Vicky McIntyre and most of the 
team after the game. 
McIntyre replaced George 
in the starting lineup, scoring 
four points and pulling down 
six rebounds in 17 minutes. 
She reiterated Butler’s re-
marks, expressing frustration 
with her inability to better im-pact the game.
“Obviously not happy with 
my performance, and it wasn’t acceptable,” McIntyre said. 
“They’re a very physical 
team — probably the most physical in the paint we’ve played thus far. That’s not an excuse at all, but it’s something we didn’t do well adjusting 
to.”

Elizabeth Beisel tried to swim her way into history against FAU.
She was on pace to break a 25-year-old UF record in the 1650m free, held by 
Tami Bruce, but came up short. Bruce’s time of 15:50.86 is still standing after Beisel’s 15:53.22.
Though Bruce’s record remained, Beisel still won the event.
The No. 9 Gators women’s swimming and diving team followed suit, emerg-
ing victorious against the Owls by a score of 169-106. Senior Jamie Bohunicky 
grabbed a win in the 200 Butterfly, ahead of three other Gators who rounded out 
the top four. 
“Coming in we knew it’d be a pretty fun meet,” Bohunicky said. “We all 
worked together. We all fed off each other, and overall, we all raced really tough.”
While most of the men’s team stayed behind to face 
FAU, nine members were in Dallas for the SMU Classic.  
Following the first day, No. 7 Florida was sitting in 
third with 153 points. No. 1 Michigan led the pack with 166 points, followed by No. 5 USC with 162 
points. Junior Sebastien Rousseau notched a victory 
for UF  in the 400 IM. Junior Marcin Cieslak also gave the Gators a win when he 
posted a time of 47.78 in the 100 Fly.
Rousseau clocked in with a personal-best time of 4:17.53 to win the 500 Free. 
He would go on to take the 200 Fly. 
By the end of competition on Saturday , the Gators remained in third with 
318 points.  USC took the meet with 330 points, and Michigan ended in second with 327. 
The remaining portion of the men’s team who stayed in Gainesville also 
pulled out a win, knocking off FAU 178-111 with 10 individual victories. 
FAU did end the day on a high note, as both the men and women pulled out 
victories over the Gators in the 200 freestyle relay . 
Associate head coach Martyn Wilby was pleased with the effort his team 
gave. 
“Technically , things like our starts, our relay starts, our turns were a lot better 
than they were in the fall (semester),” Wilby said. 
The Gators will travel to Auburn, Ala., on Saturday to face senior Kyle Ow-
ens, and junior Olivia Scott — the defending Southeastern Conference men’s and women’s swimmers of the week — and the rest of the Tigers, who have not lost a meet this season.

Gordon Watson graduated early from 
Naples First Baptist Academy in December 
2011 and was promptly redshirted. After  watching Florida compete during his first dual-meet season in 2012, Watson got his 
chance.
In his first dual meet as a Gator, Watson 
started and finished the match strong, help-
ing No. 12 Florida (1-0) defeat Miami (1-1) 5-2 on Saturday at Linder Stadium.
“Gordon, I thought, continued his form 
from [the Three Oaks Shootout on Jan 11-13],” coach Bryan Shelton said. “It seems like he’s getting better each outing. I’m ex-cited about where he’s going with his game. He has an idea about how to play the game 
now, how to serve his way out of trouble 
at times, and he’s looking to get forward to the net and make plays.” 
Watson got the Gators off to a good start 
when he teamed up with Billy Federhofer in doubles. With the game at 40-15, Watson returned a shot to the top right corner of Miami’s service box to give Florida its first doubles victory in an 8-1 win against UM’s 
Omar Aly and William Albanese.
Florent Diep and Michael Alford 
clinched the doubles point for the Gators 
four minutes later in an 8-2 win. The final doubles group did not finish due to a new NCAA rule, which only lets the final match play out if both coaches agree.
“We want to play aggressive doubles,” 
Shelton said. “We’re trying to be very ac-tive at the net and make things happen rather than being passive and letting them happen. … That’s our style of play and something we’re just going to continue to work on to get better at as we go along.”
Florida carried its strong start over into 
singles. Alford grabbed the first point by defeating Aly 6-0, 6-3. Two minutes later, 
Stephane Piro won 6-3, 6-1 against Miami’s 
Wilfredo Gonzalez.
Still, Florida needed Watson to secure 
its first win of the year. After dropping two straight games in the first set, the redshirt freshman regained the lead. Watson went on to beat Miami’s Victor Mauz 6-4, 6-3 to get the final singles point that the Gators needed in a 4-minute time span.
“[Watson has] improved so much from 
fall,” Alford said. “You expect sometimes 
for the freshman’s first match to not go 
well, but it went really smoothly.”

◗ FLORIDA BEAT MISSOURI 
197.3-194.625 ON FRIDAY.
  CHUCK KINGSBURY
 Alligator Writer
   
 Mackenzie Caquatto achieved 
perfection on Friday night in the 
O’Connell Center.
  Anchoring the Gators at the 
back end of their uneven bars ro-tation, Caquatto’s technique was mechanical.
The All-American notched her 
ﬁ  rst career score of 10 — the sev-enth in uneven bars in program’s history.
  “When I set the dismount, I 
knew it was one of the best rou-tines I’ve done,” Caquatto said.
  Florida welcomed Missouri to 
the Southeastern Conference by 
posting its highest team score of 
the season in a 197.3-194.625 win in front of a crowd of 5,453.
  “I loved that [the team] took 
last weekend’s competition very 
seriously and turned it around in 
our training and had a different attitude of ﬁ  ght [Friday night] for everything,” coach Rhonda Faehn 
said.
  Caquatto became the ﬁ  fth 
Gator to claim a perfect 10 on 
uneven bars —  a feat that hasn’t been accomplished since former Florida gymnast Melanie Sinclair, 
who turned in three 10 marks on 
from 2007-2009.
  Caquatto’s full-out dismount 
was considered an “E-level” skill — or exceptionally difﬁ  cult.
Her score capped an impressive 
showing by the Gators on bars, as they set the ﬁ  fth-highest total in 
program history with 49.60.  
  “[Caquatto] is such a huge tal-
ent,” Faehn said. “It was almost 
excruciatingly painful as a coach 
to watch her frustrations and her 
struggles with her injuries that were signiﬁ  cant.”
  Caquatto hasn’t been the 
healthiest gymnast positioned in 
Faehn’s ever-changing lineups.
  The Naperville, Ill., native 
sprained both ankles at a ﬁ  nal selec-
tion camp for the 2011 U.S. World Championships team. The injuries sidelined her for Florida’s ﬁ  rst 
two meets during her sophomore 
year.
  “ I t ’ s 
nice to be out 
there and be able to walk without 
pain,” Caquatto said.
  Another Florida All-American, 
Ashanee Dickerson, fell short of a 
perfect vault routine by the slim-mest of margins but set a college-best score of 9.975.
She went on to claim the eve-
ning’s ﬂ  oor title, her second of the season with a 9.9. 
  Following last Friday’s loss 
to LSU, Dickerson was conﬁ  dent a stern approach to the team’s weekly training would serve its purpose against Missouri. 
  “We fought through every-
thing,” Dickerson said.
“[Faehn] was telling us in the 
gym from last week (that) we 
didn’t ﬁ  ght as much and this week 
,I felt that we fought a lot more for landings and tried not to make many mistakes.”  Gymnast earns perfect 10AGOSTIN RATIONAL
  At the 2012 NCAA Championships in Du-luth, Ga., Kytra Hunter 
ﬁ  nished her ﬂ  oor routine with a nearly ﬂ  awless double back tuck tumbling pass. Her score of 9.925 put Florida ahead of 
UCLA by .025. 
  The Gators were in ﬁ  rst 
place, but the moment was 
short-lived. 
  Seconds after Hunter ﬁ  n-
ished, Alabama’s Ashley Priess performed a career-best routine on beam. Priess’ 9.950 put the Crimson Tide on top to give 
Alabama its second straight na-
tional title. 
  Despite falling .075 short of 
winning its ﬁ  rst NCAA cham-pionship, the Gators should 
return home from Los Angeles 
with the crown this season.
  UF did everything it could to 
win the ultimate prize in 2012. 
  Even with Ashanee Dicker-
son’s uncharacteristic fall and last-place 9.2 score on uneven bars — Florida’s only miss during the meet —  the Gators 
covered up the mistake by av-
eraging a 9.885 on the event to 
record their highest score at the 
NCAA Championships.
The collective 49.425 on bars 
also ranked second among all 
six teams, falling only to UCLA by .05.
  Florida had all the tools to 
get the job done and a wealth of experience on its roster in 2012. 
    UF entered the national 
championships ranked ﬁ  rst in 
bars and beam, fourth in vault 
and seventh in ﬂ  oor, while boasting a 17-1 record. That one loss came against Alabama at the beginning of a long season during which coach Rhonda 
Faehn focused on preventing 
injuries, something that hin-dered the Gators from advanc-ing to the Super Six in 2011.
  The Crimson Tide just had 
a better day at the champion-ships. However, Alabama’s reign in college gymnastics has come to an end. 
  Florida only loses Nicole 
Ellis and Amy Ferguson from its second-place NCAA team. Each gymnast competed in 
only one event at last year’s 
national title meet. Ferguson’s 9.85 on ﬂ  oor tied with Marissa King and Dickerson as Florida’s lowest score for the event, and, 
had it not been for Dickerson’s 
fall, Ellis’ 9.85 on bars may not have counted.
  The Crimson Tide, on the 
other hand, lost their anchor, Geralen Stack-Eaton, to gradu-ation. 
  The all-around competitor 
led the way for Alabama dur-
ing the 2012 NCAA Champion-
ships. Stack-Eaton had the top 
score for the Crimson Tide in 
vault, bars and ﬂ  oor. Beam was 
the only event where Stack-Eaton’s teammates outshined her.
  Still, she came up big with a 
score of 9.9. 
  Alabama will try to ﬁ  ll Stack-
Eaton’s spot with Carley Sims and Lauren Beers. Beers has participated in only two events 
— both during a 196.45-192.025 
win against Missouri on Jan. 11 — and Sims has yet to com-pete for the Crimson Tide. 
  While the No. 3 Gators re-
turn all of their top gymnasts, they also add Olympian Bridget Sloan, 2010-12 U.S. Senior Na-tional Team member Bridgette 
Caquatto and 2010-12 Canadian 
National Team member Bianca Dancose-Giambattisto. 
  While Florida has the title 
within its reach, there will be 
another down-to-the-wire ﬁ  ght. 
However, this time it will be with No. 4 UCLA. 
  The Bruins fell to the Gators 
at the national championship by .025 — the smallest mar-gin in gymnastics. And while UCLA did not lose nearly as much talent as Alabama did, 
it does lose Aisha Gerber and 
Elyse Hopfner-Hibbs, who all contributed in the Bruins third-place ﬁ  nish.
No. 1 Michigan and No. 
2 Oklahoma may also pose a threat for Florida, but both fell short of the Super Six in 2012. 
  Florida still has to make it 
through the season injury-free, but if Mackenzie Caquatto’s performance on bars Friday night is any indication of how
