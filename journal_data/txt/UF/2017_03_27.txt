Brian Dassler could rattle eight lines of 
poetry in 30 seconds.
He had the poem “Good Enough,” often 
recited at the leadership camps he attend-ed, memorized as a teenager. 
Nearly two decades later, Dassler car-
ried its message with him: “Good enough” was never enough.
Dassler used the philosophy to help fel-
low Gators, inspire students at a Fort Lau-
derdale school and start a charter school 
for residents of New Orleans devastated by 
Hurricane Katrina.
Dassler, a three-time UF graduate with a 
bachelor’s, master’s and doctorate degree, 
died Tuesday from a blood clot in his lung, 
called a pulmonary embolism, said Chuck Vones, Dassler’s cousin. Dassler was 38 
years old.
Emma Humphries, who saw herself as 
one of Dassler’s mentees since they met in 1999, still pictures him reciting the ﬁ  -nal lines of that poem: “Good enough is neither.”
“Brian was good, and Brian was enough, 
but Brian would not let ‘good enough’ de-ﬁ  ne his life,” Humphries said. “Florida’s perfect son, that’s what he was.”
A service for Dassler will likely be held 
at UF, along with one at Tallahassee.After graduating, Dassler taught at an 
inner-city Fort Lauderdale high school.
Teddy Joseph remembers Brian assign-
ing his class to read “I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings,” by Maya Angelou. 
Joseph didn’t take the assignment seri-
ously at the time, but in the wake of Das-sler’s death, he said he wants to give the book another chance.
Joseph said Dassler pushed him to pur-
sue college as he received one rejection af-ter another.UF grad who set up school after Hurricane Katrina dies

Florida’s March magic ran out Sunday.
Two days after his miracle three-pointer 
lifted Florida to the Elite Eight, UF guard 
Chris Chiozza tried to save his team again. 
He made a last-ditch drive to the basket, 
down by ﬁ  ve points with under 20 seconds 
left. The ball never made it to the hoop. 
South Carolina defender PJ Dozier 
stripped and ﬂ  ipped the ball ahead to a wide-open teammate for a dunk and a celebration.
The No. 7 seed Gamecocks came back 
from a seven-point halftime deﬁ  cit to beat 
No. 4 seed Florida 77-70 in New York. South 
Carolina advanced to its ﬁ  rst Final Four in school history, while Florida’s season ended in the Elite Eight.  
The Gators carried the momentum from 
their Sweet 16 buzzer-beating win over Wis-consin into a polished ﬁ  rst-half performance against South Carolina. 
The Gators’ offense had its best start in 
the NCAA Tournament with 40 ﬁ  rst-half points, shooting 56 percent from the ﬁ  eld. After trailing South Carolina 24-20 at one 
point, the Gators made ﬁ  ve straight three-
pointers from four players as part of an 18-6 UF run. South Carolina cut Florida’s lead to seven points heading into halftime, 40-33. 
“Obviously happy we made some shots 
to put us in this position,” UF coach Mike White said at the half.
The second half was different. Florida was 
in foul trouble fast, committing seven fouls 
in ﬁ  ve minutes. The Gamecocks attempted 
28 second-half free throws to Florida’s eight. 
UF’s offense broke down, too. After 
making 7-of-12 ﬁ  rst-half three-pointers, the 
Gators didn’t make a shot from beyond the 
arc in the second, going 0-for-14 from three- After remarkable run, Gators lose in Elite Eight

A Doorway to the Divine: Islamic 
Bodies and the Sufi Saints as 
Connecting the Living to the 
Dead
A historian of the Islamic world, France and medicine from 
McMaster University will give a 
free public lecture April 6 at 5:30 
p.m. in Smathers Library, Room 
100. Ellen Amster will discuss the role of the bodies of saints in 
healing the living in precolonial 
Morocco. For Muslim pilgrims 
visiting the tombs of the saints, these holy bodies offered cures by linking heaven and Earth. 
These traditions and beliefs were challenged by French colo-nialism and notions of science in 
the late 19th century and early 20th century. This event is the 
seventh in an eight-part series 
called “Death: Confronting the 
Great Divide,” during which in-
ternationally renowned scholars 
and filmmakers explore unique 
cultural and historical confron-
tations with death. This event is free and open to the public, and 
it includes time afterward for 
questions and discussion.

Throngs of UF students were giv-
en vastly different options for enter-
tainment Friday night.
At 9 p.m. inside the Reitz Union 
Grand Ballroom, a clean-cut standup 
comedian told jokes about swatting 
mosquitoes, his peanut allergy and turning 40.
Two hours later, inside a slightly 
smoky Reitz Rion Ballroom, a raun-chy 25-year-old rapper recited bass-heavy ballads, mostly about money and women, as some students ap-peared to smoke marijuana.
The performances, by Demetri 
Martin and Young Thug, respective-
ly, were a part of the fourth annual 
Big Orange Festival, hosted by Reitz Union Board Entertainment.
Martin, who visited UF for the 
second time, was paid $30,000, and Thug, making his first appearance, was paid $68,000, according to Al-ligator archives.
Although Martin told the crowd 
of about 800 students that his wife was a UF alumna, and that she loved Krishna lunch, he sarcastically thanked the university for hosting him. At one point, he stomped on the stage and complained about its lack of curtains, before asking what 
students even used the ballroom for.
Then came the signature one-lin-
ers and self-deprecating humor audi-
ences knew him for during his time on TV and at comedy clubs through-out the country.
“I think Jesus was probably one 
of the first scarecrows,” he said, reading from a book of “facts” he 
brought on stage.
In a navy sweatshirt, jeans and 
grey New Balances, the comedian 
told the crowd he has always been just a bit too awkward.
“I’m not a person who exer-
cises unless I’m being chased,” the 
43-year-old said.
AJ Ariondo, 21, sat on the edge of 
his seat in the front row of Martin’s 
show. He said seeing Martin live was on his bucket list after watching his standup since 2004.
“His dry humor is incredible,” the 
UF history junior said.
As Martin’s show wrapped 
up, students a floor above snaked through hallways in the Reitz wait-ing for Young Thug’s performance. When the doors opened, students raced toward the barricade, and the room hit capacity at about 700 stu-dents. 
Thug came on at about 11:20 
p.m. with tied-back red-purple hair and a shimmering microphone. 
Puffs of smoke floated above the 
crowd as students sang the chorus of his expletive-laden songs.
Arren Richter, a 19-year-old UF 
economics sophomore, said while he was squished in the densely packed crowd, it was worth it to see one of his favorite rappers for the first time. 
“I like the way he raps,” he said. 
“He has his own unique, mumbling sound.”

A new beer at First Magnitude Brewing 
Company is designed with butterflies in mind. 
The local brewery debuted the Miami Blue 
Bock, a specialty golden lager, on Friday at a special launch party. The beer, which took about three months to develop, was designed to help support the conservation of the Miami blue butterfly.
Scientists at the Florida Museum of Natural 
History partnered with the brewery, located at 1220 SE Veitch St., to help launch the beer and raise awareness about the butterfly’s status. Five cents from every can will be donated to the museum’s conservation effort, said assis-tant brewer Simon McClung. 
“Our message has been spring conserva-
tion since we opened,” McClung said, noting that the beer will also be sold at Disney’s Ani-mal Kingdom Theme Park.
The cans are equipped with augmented 
reality features — an industry first, McClung said. Participants can download the free Li-braries of Life app, point it at the beer can, see a 3-D rendering of the butterfly and learn 
more about its biology. 
“What’s better than butterflies, beer and 
augmented reality?” said Jaret Daniels, the 
program director of the Florida Museum’s Mc-Guire Center for Lepidoptera and Biodiversity.
Daniels said the museum is doing a number 
of different research projects on the butterfly. 
“We’re looking at the survivorship on both 
plants, because that will dictate where we decide to reintroduce the butterfly,” he said, 
adding that as of now, the butterfly is only 
found on a few small islands to the west of 
Key West. 
The brewery said it hopes to start a series 
of butterfly-themed beers, with every can of-
fering augmented reality. This is the second 
time First Magnitude brewed a beer to help 
conservation efforts of an endangered but-terfly, Daniels said, after raising more than $2,500 for the Schaus swallowtail butterfly in 
September 2016 with the Schaus Stout. 
“First Magnitude is a fantastic partner,” 
Daniels said. “It’s a true collaboration.”First Magnitude debuts new

Dassler won the Broward County 
Teacher of the Year award for his time 
at the school. 
Today, Joseph runs his own per-
sonal training center and graduated from the University of West Florida. He looks back fondly at Brian’s impact on his life.
“He was very, very important in my 
life,” Joseph said. “He still is.”
Dassler’s desire to help others led 
him to New Orleans. 
In 2010, Dassler started KIPP Re-
naissance, a charter school for high schoolers, which now helps 450 stu-dents.  
Florida’s Commissioner of Educa-
tion Pam Stewart said in a statement that Dassler couldn’t turn his back on those suffering after Hurricane Katrina. 
“He inspired others to go the extra 
mile and believe they, too, could make a difference,” Stewart said.
When Linda Eldridge walks her 
miniature schnauzer Susie at night, she thinks through her day. 
On Wednesday, she thought about 
Dassler.
She thought about how he stayed 
in touch after leaving her doctoral pro-gram, where she was the chairperson of his dissertation committee. 
“I’ll miss ... hearing from him and 
being aware of what he’s up to,” El-dridge said. “I think the world was his future.”
To honor Dassler, UF’s College of 
Education along with Leadership Flor-ida, where Dassler was a counselor, will start a memorial scholarship, El-dridge said.
“He was so bright, and so good at 
what he did,” she said. “It is such a sad loss for all of Florida.”

The Chemistry Lab Building was 
cleared for a chemical leak after a 
student discovered an open con-tainer with a potentially explosive liquid Saturday afternoon, ofﬁ  cials 
said. 
Steven Locicero, a UF chemistry 
graduate student, was working in a 
lab Saturday afternoon when he saw a damaged container of trichlorosi-lane, a chemical that could explode if exposed to water. He said he was concerned the exposed chemical could be a danger and reported the chemical at about 5:20 p.m. 
“I just wanted to be sure it was 
safe,” the 28-year-old said.
University Police shut down 
Buckman Drive for more than an hour until 6:45 p.m. and blocked off foot trafﬁ  c near the building. 
Lt. Kristy Sasser said UPD as-
sisted Gainesville Fire Rescue and evacuated the lab building.
GFR District Chief Joseph Hill-
house said Locicero placed the con-tainer in an over-pack container, which would block any leaks, be-fore he evacuated the building.“(The chemical) doesn’t play 
well with others, and we have to be safe about this,” Hillhouse said. 
The hazardous materials team 
went into the building and used air monitoring devices to see if the chemical was airborne but did not detect anything, Hillhouse said. He said the container could have erupt-ed at any time, and the chemical may have already dissipated. 
The lab where the chemical is 
found is used to make solid materi-als, Locicero said.
Hillhouse said the chemical no 
longer presents a hazard. GFR clears UF chemistry building

With laptops in hand, people gathered in the Harn 
Museum of Art on Sunday to increase representation of 
female artists on Wikipedia. 
The second annual Wikipedia Edit-a-thon: Art + 
Feminism was held to represent women and artists in 
other minority groups. The Gainesville event, hosted by 
the Harn and UF’s School of Art + Art History, was one of many held around the world, said Melissa Hyde, the director of graduate students for UF’s School of Art + Art History. 
About 40 people sat in the museum’s auditorium, 
editing or creating articles about artists for about four hours. 
Hyde said by increasing the number of women who create and are the subjects of Wikipedia pages, the web-site would more accurately represent artists. 
“It’s such an important source for us now, it’s like the 
ﬁ  rst stop for everybody when you want to look some-thing up,” she said.
Ninety percent of Wikipedia’s content is produced by 
men, said Eric Segal, the director of education and cura-tor of academic programs at the Harn. 
“The content itself tends to skew towards male inter-
ests,” Segal said. 
Jennifer Canals, a UF art history junior, said she want-
ed to attend Sunday’s event after participating last year. 
“We have a long history of being misrepresented as 
women and especially as women artists,” the 21-year-old said. “I think that it’s really great that we’re giving recognition to artists that otherwise would not be getting recognition.”  Harn hosts Wikipedia-editing

When Noah Barnes blew out 
11 candles on his birthday cake 
Sunday, he wished for a cure for diabetes.
That’s what he told a crowd of 
150 friends, family members and strangers after the group walked in Noah’s March For a Cure 5K, a 5,000-meter walk, early Sunday. 
Noah, a resident of Jupiter, Flor-
ida, who has Type 1 diabetes, re-turned to Gainesville for the walk, taking a break from walking across the country to raise awareness for 
the disease.
Noah and his father, Robert, are 
three miles away from downtown 
Atlanta on their way to Blaine, Washington, said Noah’s mother, Joann. The pair originally started in Key West on Jan. 1, but they drove back from Atlanta for the weekend’s 5K.
The purpose of the event was to 
raise awareness for the resources and research for diabetes at UF, said Carly Barnes, the assistant di-rector of the UF Diabetes Institute, who has no relation to Noah’s fam-ily. 
“The main goal is to bring peo-
ple together and make a commu-
nity around diabetes,” she said.
The walk started in the Com-
muter Lot at 8:30 a.m. with the 
sound of a police siren. Families and individuals walked south on Gale Lemerand Drive, turned right onto Mowry Road and circled back around Lake Alice and Flavet Field.  
Gina Aulisio, 21, a community 
health and engagement coordina-tor at the UF Diabetes Institute, greeted participants after their walk and directed them to the post-run party at the Clinical and Transla-tional Research Building, where Noah celebrated his birthday a day early. She said her mother was di-agnosed with diabetes as an adult 
and still struggles with balancing 
her blood sugar levels.
“It’s something you constantly 
have to be thinking about,” the UF health education senior said.
Vendors at the post-run party 
offered participants fruits and other healthy snacks. Free screenings for diabetes, funded by the National 
Institute of Health, were offered 
to family members of anyone who has been diagnosed. The UF Dia-betes Institute gave out prizes and birthday cake.
Dr. Desmond Schatz and Dr. 
Todd Brusko, who work with the UF Diabetes Institute, said the dis-ease needs greater national atten-
tion.
“For all of us who take care of 
diabetes patients, this is 24 hours,” 
Schatz said. “There is no vacation.”
Noah is meeting with Georgia’s 
governor and the American Diabe-tes Association this week. He said he is enjoying his hike.
“I get to meet interesting people 
and see awesome stuff,” Noah said. “My life is awesome now.”On cross-country trek,

The importance of a generation of problem solvers
Last Thursday, standing among more than 
100 fellow students and poster boards at UF’s Undergraduate Research Symposium, 
I presented my research project, which 
aimed to understand and evaluate Com-
mon Core — the guidelines that have helped shape our current educational system. Across 
from me, one student explained her research on 
autism. Across the room, another expounded on her analysis of French literature. Through the vast ballroom we populated with our projects, images of microscopic cell scans and medical il-
lustrations bumped up against statistical analyses and com-
parative charts: A metaphorical handshake between the science, technology, engineering and mathematics ﬁ  eld and the humanities came to life.
Looking around, I couldn’t help but feel both a sense of 
pride and surge of optimism, but not for or because of my-self individually. Of course, I felt very thankful to be there with my peers, relaying our research to small audiences and learning from each other. But that wasn’t quite where 
the pride came from. It all seemed to come together after 
our provost, Joe Glover, spoke about his experience with research and where it can take us. It boiled down to this: We are a generation of problem solvers.
Before any baby boomers think I’m simply hoisting up 
millennials out of spite, please hear me out. I don’t mean that other generations have dropped the ball by neglecting issues in the sciences and humanities and leaving it all up to us. Glover joked about this, saying how much work we 
had left to do across all ﬁ  elds of research. What I mean is 
that now, as society is at its greatest technological peak yet, we have the lens to spot more problems than ever before. 
We can see new issues to address in how the environ-
ment and society have developed with time; we can more clearly understand past problems and potentially tackle them with renewed force. This generation is one of problem solvers because we can stand on the shoulders of giants and look to the future with a stronger tele-scope. As we get older, as technology continues 
advancing with our innovations, that telescope 
will strengthen. Once we reﬁ  ne our research problems, we can get closer to achieving solu-tions — some research avenues are simply wait-
ing for a researcher to take up the call.
What I saw last Thursday was not just one 
student heeding that call, but hundreds — so 
many that Anne Donnelly, the director of UF’s Center for Undergraduate Research, remarked 
proudly that this was the center’s largest symposium yet. This was also the source of my pride and optimism: Not only was I proud of so many of us for taking on such a wide range of research questions and ﬁ  elds, but I also felt an 
overall feeling of hope. If one group of students from one 
university in one country in the world can start tackling national and global issues now, imagine the potential if we worked together with the best resources we’ve got.
Many people outside the millennial generation do amaz-
ing, productive and fascinating research, often with real-world applications and overall improvement to society in ﬁ  elds ranging from medicine to philosophy. Their work continues to make waves, devise inventions and improve 
current processes. They also motivate more young people 
each day with their passion for the truth and the quest one must embark on to get there.
My message is not to discard or discount anyone. In-
stead, I just want to emphasize the enthusiasm and work 
ethic of young researchers who might one day, and even 
now, discover life-changing results and better our world. Personally, I think seeing this generation work is inspiring. 
Let’s vow to keep it up.
Mia Gettenberg is a UF criminology and law and phi-
losophy junior. Her column appears on Mondays.Let them play golf
We’re all familiar with the infamous Marie Antoi-
nette line, “Let them eat cake,” but for those not familiar with the story, it goes something like this: While lounging on cushions in a lavishly decorated French Rococo parlor room, the then-
queen of France was approached by an adviser who ex-claimed that the common people of France had no bread to eat. To that, Marie Antoinette replied with, “Let them eat cake!”
This story did not happen. In fact, versions of it circulat-
ed for years before Antoinette was queen. It’s not so much who said it that’s important though. The French people in the late 1700s were suffering, and they saw how lavishly the aristocrats lived. It was appalling that the people sup-posedly in charge of the country could live so luxuriously while the common folk were starving. This story is used to illustrate how out of touch the ruling elite are with the needs of the common people.
It still rings true today.In a modern-day scenario, things are going to be adapt-
ed. There are struggling people all over our country. Some are starving in the street, some are struggling to get meals on the table, some are senior citizens who are homebound and some are children whose only meals come from free school lunches. Some are out of work, looking for jobs or live in areas that are not doing well economically and can-not afford to move. All these people are looking to those in charge to do something about it, and since this is the 21st century and not the 18th, they’ve elected a president who stands for the people.
Instead of reshaping the programs that would help these 
people, the person in charge decides to cut a lot of said programs, and then take vacations. Twelve of them, in fact, each costing about $3 million. Which means $36 million of taxpayer money have been spent on security for President Donald Trump as he swings his golf club in Palm Beach County and at his other Trump-branded golf courses. Thir-ty-six million dollars that could go to many of the programs facing impending budget cuts or elimination. 
We imagine the situation went something like this: While 
lounging on a leather couch in a lavishly decorated Mar-a-Lago resort room, the president is approached by an adviser who exclaims that there are people with no work or food. To that he responds, “Well, let them play golf!”
Now obviously, as with Marie Antoinette, this is just a 
story. But we tell it to drive a point across: There is a huge discrepancy between how the people in power live and what decisions they make for those who depend on them. It happened in 18th century France, and it is happening now. 
We’re not saying presidents aren’t allowed to have free 
time, but if Trump keeps up this trend of frequent golf trips, he’ll be spending about $120.5 million on vacations in this year alone, compared to the $96 million Barack Obama spent over the timespan of eight years. This, additionally, is coming from the man who criticized our former president every time he played golf. As recently as last year, Trump made tweets about how Obama was out playing golf while the country was falling apart. The money and time spent on these indulgent golf trips could be used to help the people.
For Marie Antoinette, the story did not end happily. But 
this is the 21st century, so things are going to play out dif-ferently — right? We won’t get ahead of ourselves.

Let’s think about what the ﬁ  gure 0.003 
percent means. Imagine taking a test with 1,000 questions on it and get-
ting three questions correct. That’s 
pretty awful, right? It’s bad enough 
you only got three questions right, but at least you got something. Now imagine you 
got three questions right, but then you 
wanted to retake it. You were hoping to get maybe four or ﬁ  ve right this time. Nothing too crazy, but a small improvement would be nice. Instead, you get the test back to 
see you didn’t get any questions right. Out 
of 1,000, not even one. 
Think about this, but instead imagine you 
didn’t take a test at all. Imagine you are a 
government agency relying on funding, and 
you only receive 0.003 percent of the bud-
get. Then imagine your portion is out of your control, but you hoped maybe you could at least keep your tiny, tiny slice of the pie. In-
stead, you discover you’ve been eliminated 
completely. 
This could happen to the National En-
dowment for the Arts. Last year, according to The Washington Post, 0.003 
percent of the federal budget was allocated to this agency, and 
now the Trump administration is 
proposing cutting funding com-pletely for the next ﬁ  scal year.
The National Endowment for 
the Arts describes its role as giv-ing Americans the opportunity to "participate in the arts, exer-cise their imaginations and develop their creative capacities." This, dear readers, is 
what the people need. I am not arguing that 
we don’t need the services provided by the agencies that would potentially receive the reallocated funds. We need a military, 
education and health care. I would never 
try to diminish the importance of these.I will, however, argue that the arts are also important and de-serve attention. It saddens me to 
admit that money is sometimes 
the best way to give attention, but in this case, it just might be. In the grand scheme of a multi-
trillion-dollar budget, 0.003 
percent is negligible. But for an agency, 100 percent of their 
funding is not negligible. It is not a major loss for this country to fund the arts. It is 
an immense loss for this country to cut all 
funding for the arts.
Now more than ever, we need to main-
tain our ties to humanity. We live in a 
country divided, and arguing until the end 
of time is not going to bring us back to-gether. 
I am all for the debate and analysis of 
ideas, but ﬁ  ghting is not the route to unity. 
The route to unity is lined with that which 
makes us human: art, music, invention, creativity and expression. These are the things that bring us together. The attempt to eliminate any part of this from our cul-ture should serve as a red ﬂ  ag. Getting rid of any aspect of art may contribute to us 
forgetting about human connection. With-
out connection, why should we care about anyone but ourselves?
Dear readers, this is an outrage. With-
out the arts, we lose. Sure, we may get some more money in another area, but so what? What difference does any of this make if expressing how we feel is no lon-ger important? 
Our creative minds are being stiﬂ  ed. Our 
desire for beauty and deeper understand-ing of life is being shoved aside. What can we do about it? Create, think and love. Re-
late, express and understand. There may 
come a time when all of this becomes hard to do. I beg you, whatever happens, don’t let it stop you.

Doctors didn’t expect Mateo 
Hernández to live more than a few 
days after being born. 
But in May, Mateo, who re-
ceives treatment at the UF Health 
Congenital Heart Center for a heart 
condition, will turn 3 years old. During the closing ceremonies of UF’s Dance Marathon, the toddler stood with his family and looked out at the more than 800 students who raised money for children like him. 
Mateo’s father, Mauricio, and 
the rest of his family were the ﬁ  nal miracle family to take the stage af-ter the 26.2 hourlong Dance Mara-thon. Hernández said the dancers gave him hope. 
“We’re proud of these kids, it’s 
just amazing,” Hernández said. “We told them, ‘If you guys need anything, from now on, you’re 
stuck with us.’” 
At the end of the event, Dance 
Marathon organizers held up 
signs announcing students raised $2,724,324 for Children’s Miracle Network, which donates to pedi-atric hospitals. About $2.4 million was raised in Spring 2016, accord-ing to Alligator archives. 
Jacob Daniels, a 19-year-old 
UF psychology freshman, shaved “FTK,” which stands for “For the Kids,” and “DM” into the sides of his hair prior to the event. Daniels 
said he met the child his team sup-
ports, a 1-year-old named Reilly, twice. 
Reilly has hypoplastic left heart 
syndrome, a birth defect that leaves half of his heart underdevel-oped. Daniels said meeting Reilly made the experience worth it. 
“To meet the child you’re mak-
ing a difference for, that is the highlight of it,” he said. “Our feet are killing us right now, but you think of Reilly and you think of the miracle kids, and it’s like you’re doing it for them.”
Dasani McLeod-Geohagen, a 
16-year-old student at Seminole Ridge High School, said she at-
tended the UF event to support 
the dancers and celebrate her high school raising $41,000. 
McLeod-Geohagen said when 
she was 14 years old, she was di-agnosed with craniopharyngioma, a type of brain tumor. She received treatment at the Miami Children’s Hospital and UF Health Jackson-
ville.
In the future, she said she 
wants to get more involved with 
Dance Marathon to help children who went through serious medical experiences like hers. 
“You don’t want any other 
child to go through that,” she said.

Florida swimming ﬁ  nishes season strong 
The Gators men's swimming and diving team placed third — behind T exas 
and California — at the NCAA Championships over the weekend. For a full recap, go to alligator.org/sports.Brooke Austin and the Florida 
women's tennis team picked up a pair of very different wins over the weekend. Read the story, pg. 15By Ethan Bauer
Sports Writer
Nelson Maldonado turned, took 
two steps and stopped. He’d seen 
this before, and he knew there was 
nothing he could do. 
Playing in right ﬁ  eld earlier in the 
eighth inning, he’d already watched a no-doubt two-run homer sail over his head. Later in the inning, he’d 
watched another one rocket over the left ﬁ  eld wall. And now, two batters 
later, he watched as another ball — and the lead — ﬂ  oated over his head once again.
It was that ﬁ  nal home run that 
completed the total implosion of No. 13 Florida’s bullpen and gave No. 4 LSU its ﬁ  rst lead. From there, the 
Tigers only added on in their sweep-
avoiding 10-6 win over the Gators on Sunday at McKethan Stadium. 
“We just have to do a better 
job competing,” ﬁ  rst baseman JJ Schwarz said. “Whenever you get 
the chance to sweep on an SEC 
weekend, you’ve gotta take advan-tage and have that killer instinct.... We didn’t have it today.”
Coach Kevin O’Sullivan called 
the loss “disappointing,” but it didn’t 
look disappointing early. Aside from 
a ﬁ  rst-inning error from shortstop Christian Hicks, the Gators (16-9, 2-4 
SEC) largely dominated the Tigers 
on both offense and defense. 
The offense was led by Schwarz, 
Maldonado and third baseman Jona-than India, who all picked up RBIs. 
In addition to watching 
home runs travel over the fence,  Bullpen implodes in Florida’s loss 
Chris Chiozza: 
The swish heard 
‘round the garden. The sound the ball made go-ing through the hoop 
was the least-satisfying 
aspect of Chiozza’s buzzer-beating three-point ﬂ  oater in overtime vs. Wisconsin. 
Devin Robinson:After nearly leaving for the NBA 
draft last season, this cocky forward came back to give Gators fans more 
than a few acrobatic alley-oops and 
our most memorable Mike White-Migos meme, #PipeItUp. 
Kevarrius Hayes: Toughened by his military mom, 
this backup center ﬁ  lled John Eg-bunu’s very large shoes after he went down for the year with an ACL tear. YouTube also captured Hayes yelling 
“Gimmie that sh-t!” while swatting a 
Wisconsin layup on Friday.
Schuyler Rimmer: Despite not getting much time on 
the ﬂ  oor this season, Rimmer made the most of it when he got his time to shine: walking out to the Pokemon theme song with his parents on Se-nior Night. 
Keith Stone: 
After spending a year redshirting/
becoming the perfect basketball cy-borg, Stone exploded for 17 points in an overtime matchup against Geor-gia. Not bad for a freshman. 
Gorjok Gak: 
Gak wasn’t even cleared to play at 
the beginning of the season. But after 
riding the bench for games at a time, 
Gak averaged more minutes in the postseason than the regular season. 
John Egbunu: After being Florida’s defensive an-
chor for the ﬁ  rst half of the season, Egbunu didn’t get to take part in the Gators March Madness 
run. But he did ﬁ  n-
ish the season with a 100-percent mark from three-point range, tak-ing and making his only long ball in the closing seconds of a loss vs. FSU. 
Canyon Barry: 
It’s hard to mention 
Barry without bringing up his dad, 
his underhanded free throws, his 4.0 GPA in nuclear engineering, his ability to solve a Rubix Cube in under a minute, his mom’s sports career, his surﬁ  ng, his guitar playing, or his giant ﬂ  ip ﬂ  ops pedalling a beach cruiser bicycle around campus, so I 
won’t. 
Eric Hester: 
I’ll remember Hester for two 
things this season: the game he went a perfect 5-for-5 from three-point range against LSU and the face of dis-approval he made after overhearing Canyon Barry say the word “homie.”
Justin Leon: 
Leon had one scholarship offer 
out of high school 
— to a community 
college in rural Illinois. On Sunday 
he led Florida’s offense, scoring 18 points in the Elite Eight. 
KeVaughn Allen: 
A lot of people know KeVaughn 
Allen scores a lot. Fewer people 
know that he doesn’t like to talk much. Even fewer people have seen him smirk and moonwalk out of the room when accidentally walking in on a teammate's interview. 
Kasey Hill: Kasey Hill is the owner of the big-
gest post-airball smile I’ve ever wit-nessed. He jokingly tried to play it off like a pass during Florida’s rout of Virginia in the NCAA Tournament’s Round of 32. Memorable moments from  
each Gators basketball player
AFTER WINNING ON 
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY, 
UF GOES FOR THE SWEEP 
TONIGHT.
By Skyler Lebron 
Sports Writer 
After four innings of no offense 
for the Auburn Tigers, Kasey 
Cooper ﬁ  nally made solid contact. 
Her line drive ﬂ  ew over the head of Gators ﬁ  rst baseman Kayli Kvistad and rolled into right ﬁ  eld. The hit gave Auburn some hope, and ended Kelly Barnhill’s bid at a no-hitter. 
Barnhill responded accord-
ingly, retiring the next three bat-ters and earning her seventh and eighth strikeouts en route to a sea-son-high 16 strikeout night. 
“I didn’t even know it was 16 
until someone told me earlier,” Barnhill said. “I just try to go bat-ter by batter. It’s awesome that it was 16. Strikeouts are fun.”
The No. 2 Gators rode Barn-
hill’s hot arm and spurts of offense to take Game 2 of a three-game 
series against No. 4 Auburn by a 
score of 7-0.
Barnhill retired 21 of the 25 
batters she faced. 
The sophomore’s strong per-
formance was her seventh dou-ble-digit strikeout outing on the 
season. Despite owning an ERA of 0.23, good for second lowest in the nation, Barnhill was able to improve on that mark. 
“At about the third inning I 
said, ‘Man, I’m glad she’s on our 
team today,’” Florida coach Tim 
Walton said. “When she’s pound-
ing the zone like she was today, it’s pretty fun to go out there.”
Chelsea Herndon got the scor-
ing going early in the game for 
Florida. In the second inning, the 
senior knocked a roller into center ﬁ  eld that brought home Aleshia Ocasio and opened the scoring.
In the bottom of the fourth in-
ning, Herndon utilized her bat a bit differently, hitting a ball high 
to left ﬁ  eld and bringing home Oc-
asio yet again. The sacriﬁ  ce gave the Gators a 2-0 lead. 
Consistently solid pitching from 
Barnhill throughout the ﬁ  rst ﬁ  ve 
innings put Florida in the driver’s seat offensively.

Sophomore Tigers pitcher 
Makayla Martin couldn’t ﬁ  nd an 
answer for Florida’s offense in 
the bottom of the ﬁ  fth. The Gators 
ripped off ﬁ  ve runs in the inning. 
Herndon proved to be re-
sourceful again, bunting a ball 
that brought home Jaimie Hoover. 
After some miscommunication on the throw for Auburn, Ocasio ran for the plate a third time, this time crashing into the home plate um-
pire and touching the plate just in 
time to expand UF's lead for the ﬁ  nal time. 
“I just really tried to stay fo-
cused,” Herndon said. “Not mess up in my head too much or think too much. If I saw a good pitch, just take a hack at it.” 
With the win, Florida has won 21 games in a row and shut out 20 opponents on the year. 
The Gators also won their sec-
ond straight against the Tigers af-ter losing their previous two last season by a combined score of 7-5. 
Barnhill moved to a perfect 
11-0 on the season and has only lost one start of her 27 career games.
“That’s one of the best perfor-
mances I’ve seen,” Walton said. 
“Especially when you look at the 
caliber of team she faced. To be able to neutralize their bats says a lot about her stuff today.”
This match clinches the series 
for Florida, but the Tigers will seek revenge to close out the series tonight at 7 in Gainesville.

Maldonado also hit one, holding up 
his index ﬁ  nger in triumph as he 
trotted toward ﬁ  rst base. The other 
two run producers, meanwhile, each notched two RBIs. 
India’s pair came on a bases-
loaded, two-out, full-count single that gave the Gators a ﬁ  ve-run lead enter-ing the sixth inning. At that point, it looked like the Tigers were done with 
the way UF starter Jackson Kowar was pitching. 
He’d seen some close calls earlier 
in the game — like when he faced runners on second and third with one 
out in the fourth inning and struck 
out two consecutive LSU hitters to 
close the frame — but he’d always 
found a way out. 
That changed in the sixth inning. Kowar left the bases loaded and a 
5-0 lead for sophomore Michael By-rne, who came on in relief. Byrne al-lowed a two-run single that got LSU 
(18-7, 4-2 SEC) on the scoreboard. 
Two innings later, it was Byrne 
who began the implosion of UF’s bullpen when he surrendered a two-
run homer to LSU’s Josh Smith. 
He got pulled in favor of senior 
Frank Rubio, who hit the ﬁ  rst batter 
he faced before surrendering another two-run homer. 
He got pulled for freshman An-
drew Baker, who — wait for it — hit the ﬁ  rst batter he faced. He was then pulled for freshman Kirby McMullen, who surrendered another two-run 
homer, leading to celebratory grunts, shoves and chest thumps from LSU’s 
entire bench. 
Kowar, who went 5 and 2/3 in-
nings and allowed two earned runs, said he blames himself for LSU’s comeback and called his performance 
one of the worst outings of his career. 
“I’ll have to ﬁ  gure it out,” he said, 
“or I won’t be pitching much more.”
UF has to shake off the loss quick-
ly with a date against No. 14 Florida 
State looming on Tuesday in Jackson-
ville. But despite the loss on Sunday, 
the Gators do have some positives to 
take into their next game. 
They won a series against a top-
ﬁ  ve team, had a productive offense on Sunday even though they lost and have already beaten FSU once this 
season. 
Nevertheless, O’Sullivan wasn’t 
pleased with his team choking away 
a winnable game. 
“We had a ﬁ  ve run lead,” he said. 
“That should be enough.”

Two very different teams played each 
other at Florida’s Ring Tennis Complex on 
Sunday when UF faced off against SEC ri-val Vanderbilt.
The No. 12 Gators (12-6, 5-1 SEC) came 
into Sunday’s matchup on a three-match win streak. Florida’s top-ranked player, sophomore Alfredo Perez, went undefeat-ed in singles play during the streak and en-
tered Sunday’s match fresh off of a victory 
over the nation’s sixth-ranked player in his last outing at Arkansas.
The Gators also entered the home 
match with a week of rest, last facing Ar-kansas in Fayetteville a week prior.
Meanwhile, the No. 41 Commodores 
(10-11, 1-7 SEC) entered the match on an 
SEC road trip. They came to Gainesville 
following a loss to No. 23 South Carolina in Columbia on Friday.
Vanderbilt was also forced to play 
without one of its best players, Cameron Klinger, who’s out with an injury.
The differences between the two 
squads showed up in the match.
Florida took care of Vandy in every as-
pect of competition, shutting out the Com-modores with a 7-0 win.
“I felt like today we had one of those 
performances that we’ve been working for,” UF coach Bryan Shelton said. “We always talk about playing better as the match goes on, and I think the scoreboard was indicative of just that.”
Play opened with hard-fought doubles 
action. All three matches were close, but the Gators earned late breaks in two con-tests to edge out the point.
Then the match transitioned to singles, 
where the Gators dominated.
UF quickly secured the match due to 
the performances of its upperclassmen.
“The seniors did their job today,” Shel-
ton said. “I really thought it was a com-plete performance… Our guys kept their composure when things were tough and were very resilient when they needed to be.”
Elliott Orkin, a senior and team captain, 
was the ﬁ  rst to capture victory for Florida, 
defeating Billy Rowe in two sets 6-3, 6-1.
The conclusion of Orkin’s match was 
closely followed by a win from junior 
Chase Perez-Blanco in the second position. Perez-Blanco defeated the Commodores’ Baker Newman, also by a score of 6-3, 6-1.
Maxx Lipman clinched the team vic-
tory for Florida when he defeated Panu Virtanen by a tally of 6-4, 6-3.
As for the Gators’ underclassmen, Per-
ez took care of his opponent in two sets, downing Danny Valent on Court 1 by a score of 7-5, 6-1, while freshmen Johannes Ingildsen and Joseph Guillin were able to cap the Gators’ shutout by winning match-es in third-set tiebreakers.
UF will look to extend its win streak to 
ﬁ  ve when it heads to Tuscaloosa on Thurs-
day for a matchup against Alabama.

WOMEN’S TENNIS

The Gators women’s tennis 
team had seen this before. Late 
in singles play with the match on the line against an SEC opponent, it all came down to one tiebreaker 
set. 
In a match that lasted more 
than four hours, Brooke Austin 
won her ﬁ  nal set in singles 7-6 to clinch a narrow 4-3 victory over No. 18 Arkansas on Friday. 
For the ﬁ  rst time this sea-
son, Florida saw a very differ-ent doubles lineup to start the 
match. With Kourtney Keegan out, Florida put Ingrid Neel and Anna Danilina on Court 1, Josie 
Kuhlman and Belinda Woolcock on Court 2 and Austin and Spen-cer Liang on Court 3. Neel and Danilina were off the court ﬁ  rst as they dominated Shannon Hudson 
and Giulia Pairone 6-1. 
Then competition tightened. 
After Austin and Liang lost their 
match, Kuhlman and Woolcock went to a tiebreaker set to win the doubles point for the Gators with a 7-5 victory over Arkansas’s Ana Oparenovic and Mia Jurasic. 
Despite losing the doubles 
point, Arkansas didn’t let up in singles play. Oparenovic tied the match after beating Neel 6-2, 4-6, 
6-3. Kuhlman put the Gators back 
up by beating Leolia Jeanjean 4-6, 6-1, 6-3, but not long after that the game was tied again after Danilina lost on Court 4. 
Woolcock put the Gators back 
in the lead after winning a long two-game match against Hudson 6-4, 7-6 (8-6), but Arkansas’s Natsuho Arakawa beat Liang 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 to tie the match again. 
It came down to Austin’s tie-
breaker set on Court 5 as she won 6-4, 1-6, 7-6 (7-5) over Pairone.
On Sunday, the Gators won by 
a much broader margin. After be-ing delayed by rain and then hav-ing to move the match indoors, 
the Gators routed Missouri 4-0. 
Returning to their normal doubles lineups, Kuhlman and Woolcock were off the court ﬁ  rst after beat-ing Mizzou’s Clare Raley and Kadi Fauble. The Tigers then split 
the doubles set as Bea Machado 
Santos and Amina Ismail beat Austin and Keegan 6-3. Neel and Danilina put the Gators on the board by winning 6-4 over Tate Schroeder and Cassidy Spearman.
Singles play against the Tigers 
was much less contested, as the Gators won on Courts 1, 2 and 3 to get the win. Singles lineups saw slight variations as Neel did not play. Instead, Josie Kuhlman moved up to Court 2 where she put the Gators up 2-0 after domi-nating Spearman 6-0, 6-0. Next, it was Danilina’s turn to give Flori-da another point as she easily de-feated Schroeder 6-2, 6-2. 
In the closest match of the day, 
Woolcock was next to score for UF, beating Machado Santos 6-1, 7-6. 
With Sunday’s win, Florida 
improved to 16-1 and 6-1 in the SEC. UF sits second in the SEC standings behind Georgia.

point range. 
“I’m embarrassed to say I 
didn’t know we were 0-for-14,” 
White said after the game. “I know we were really struggling to 
make a shot. I didn’t know how 
bad it was.”
Florida senior Justin Leon 
was the only Gator to make more 
than four shots, finishing with 18 points on 7-of-15 shooting in his last game for UF. 
Even Leon couldn’t explain 
Florida’s inability to make shots 
in the second half.
“Maybe they just weren’t go-
ing in, because we still got the same looks that we got in the first half,” Leon said. “Tonight just wasn’t our night to win.”
The Gators’ leading scorer 
on the season, KeVaughn Allen, shot 4-of-12 from the field for 13 points. 
As a team, the Gators shot 11-
of-35 from the field in the second half, about 31 percent. 
The only thing that didn’t 
change in the second period was the play of South Carolina guard Sindarius Thornwell. The SEC’s Player of the Year scored 26 points, shooting 8-of-13 from the 
field, 9-of-10 on free throws and 
pulling in seven rebounds. 
Florida finished with a 27-9 record, finishing second behind 
Kentucky in the SEC standings 
and earning White SEC Coach of the Year honors in his second season at UF. One year after the 
Gators lost the NIT quarterfinals, 
they lost in the NCAA Tourna-ment’s quarterfinals with their best regular-season record since 2013-14. 
For White, UF’s season and fi-
nal loss were a testament to the strength of the SEC. “I’m not going to sit here and 
tell you it’s the best league, but it’s building, it’s talented, it’s quick, it’s fast, it’s strong, it’s well coached,” White said, prais-
ing South Carolina coach Frank 
Martin. 
“He’s one of those guys — I’m 
glad he’s going. I would rather have gone than Frank, but I’m 
happy he’s going.”
