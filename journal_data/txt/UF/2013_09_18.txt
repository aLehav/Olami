Detective Rob Concannon, Detective Matt Goeckel and Sgt. Greg Armagost load computers marked for evidence in a truck 
Tuesday. Gainesville Police raided Gators Hot Spot Sweepstakes, an Internet cafe, after a judge issued a search warrant.

Gainesville Police raided a local Internet cafe Tues-
day after an investigation showed it could have been op-
erating in violation of a recently passed Florida law.
At about 1:30 p.m., detectives gathered inside Gators 
Hot Spot Sweepstakes, located at 2109 NW 13th St. 
Two hours later, they loaded more than 50 comput-
ers into the bed of a pickup truck to investigate for a possible violation of Florida Statute 849, which recently banned paying to play games for cash prizes at estab-lishments such as Internet cafes. 
After several weeks of investigation, detectives gath-
ered enough information to bring a case before a judge, who then issued a search warrant, said GPD Lt. Will Halvosa. 
Ofﬁ  cers didn’t make any arrests Tuesday, Halvosa 
said. However, the business owners could face two fel-ony charges — keeping a gambling house and playing prohibited lottery — as well as charges of playing games by chance and operating illegal slot machines, both mis-demeanors.
About a week before the warrant was served, man-
ager Stacey Westbrook, 24, explained to the Alligator how the business operated. Patrons would pay for Inter-
net access, which came with free entries to play games 
installed on the business’ computers, similar to how the cafe operated before the law.
The key differences post-statute, Westbrook said, 
were that each game revealed how much money a player would win on the next turn and that the winnings were Internet cafe

� MANY STUDENTS HAVE 
GOTTEN $52.50 TICKETS. 
TIANA DRISCOLL

An increase in pedestrian-related 
accidents last year and earlier this year 
forced Gainesville Police to step its 
enforcement efforts up — starting with 
jaywalking tickets.
Accidents in late 2012 and early 2013 
caused GPD to send ofﬁ  cers to several 
different locations speciﬁ  cally looking 
for pedestrian violations. One of those locations includes West University Avenue, where many students have 
received $52.50 jaywalking tickets.GPD spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias 
said running the trafﬁ  c safety initiative 
is part of a grant-funded program. 
GPD receives about $30,000 each 
year  from the Florida Department of Transportation to prevent pedestrian and vehicle violations, he said.
Tobias said that because the 
Department of Transportation gives 
GPD money to conduct the intiative, it 
has the funds to send ofﬁ  cers looking for violations about twice a month.

About half of the 2,000 free student member-
ships offered by the Samuel P. Harn Museum 
of Art and funded by a Student Government 
grant have been grabbed.
The museum started offering the free mem-
berships on Sept. 6. So far, more than 1,000 stu-
dents have registered.
All activity-fee paying students can register 
for their free annual membership by logging on to Gator 1 Central and ﬁ  lling out a form. With the free membership, students will have dis-counts at the Harn Museum of Art store, invi-
tations to member-only pARTies and access to 
more than 800 museums nationwide.
Allison VanDenend, annual giving coordi-
nator for the Harn, said the museum will be 
issuing student members digital membership 
cards through a smartphone app. Students will be able to receive push notiﬁ  -
cations when they are near any of the museums that accept their memberships.
Christina Bonarrigo, 22, UF Student Body 
president and management graduate student, said SG is excited to partner with the Harn in the membership giveaway.
Eugenia Martinez, 34, an art history Ph.D. 
student, is thrilled about the free membership 
giveaway. She said she tries to go to the Harn 
at least once a month.
“Harn museum is a well-rounded museum, 
and has great programs. As a poor college stu-
dent, the free membership is a huge blessing,” 
Martinez said.UF students quickly claim free

This is the lock screen for the iPhone iOS 6.1.4 software 
system, the last update prior to the iOS 7 release.SEAN STEWART-MUNIZ 
Alligator Staff Writer
sstewart-muniz@alligator.org
Apple iOS7 comes out today, 
but think twice about updating 
without backing up your data.
Ross Newman, founder and 
CEO of iHospital, said backing up phone data is always impor-
tant, whether a phone is stolen, lost, or just updating to a new 
operating system.
Newman said it’s rare for an 
update to cause data loss, but with any major change there are 
kinks in the system that have to 
be worked out.
He said to minimize the 
chance of corrupting a phone’s 
data, restore it to its factory set-
tings after backing up data and then update the software.
“We always see people when 
there’s new software coming out 
who have accidentally wiped 
their phones,” he said. “Un-less they have a recent backup, they’re in trouble.”
Riley Richards, an 18-year-
old UF English freshman, said she used to only back up her data every few months until she tried updating her new phone.
“I guess I pressed the wrong sync button and everything was just gone,” she said. “It was 
pretty stressful.”
Megan Raitano, a 21-year-
old UF anthropology senior, 
said her phone has been wiped several times, but she still only 
backs up her data once a year at 
most.
“My photos are automatical-
ly backed up to Dropbox,” she 
said. “Everything else is pretty 
unimportant to me.”WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 3

The Hippodrome State Theatre 
reached its goal of $15,000 to fund a 
transition to digital film presentation so it can continue showing movies.
Proceeds from the Kickstarter 
campaign, which began in July, will go toward upgrading projector tech-nology inside of the Hippodrome. Small theaters across the country are raising money to make the switch as the national movie industry discon-tinues 35 millimeter film reels.
Now that the Hippodrome has 
the funds, the upgrades are expect-
ed to begin within the next couple of 
months, cinema director Alisha Kin-man wrote in an email.
The Hippodrome reached its 
goal two days before the deadline and plans to raise additional funds to support further improvements, such as adding cupholders to the-ater seats, she said.
Kinman attributed the cam-
paign’s success to working with an arts-driven community.
Alison Hassell, a 20-year-old UF 
marketing junior, said she enjoys at-tending events at the Hippodrome and is excited to see the updates.
“It’ll probably attract more peo-
ple to the theater because they know the quality of the feature presenta-tion will be better,” Hassell said.
The updates will enhance the 
theater’s appeal, especially to the student community, Hassell said.
Kinman agreed.“We thrive on the concept that 
you will not just leave our movie theater with a ticket stub,” Kinman wrote. “You will leave with an expe-rience.”4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 2013

speak at UF on Sept. 26. 
Daniel Landesberg, ACCENT Speaker’s Bureau 
chairman and 21-year-old UF telecommunication se-
nior, said Donilon was a great choice to cover the recent 
controversy.
“We thought it was a pretty exciting opportunity for 
students to spend the evening with the man that briefed 
the president of the United States every morning,” Landesberg said.
He said having a speaker who was so close to con-tentious issues is a rare opportunity. Many figures are imprisoned or in dif-ferent countries. Donilon is fresh out of office.
The talk will be in the Phillips Cen-
ter for the Performing Arts. Doors open at 7 p.m., and the talk will start 
at 8 p.m. Admission is free and open 
to the public. Student tickets will be  
available for pickup Sept. 25 and gen-
eral admission at 5 p.m. the day of the event.
Chris Tabares, a 20-year-old food science and human 
nutrition transfer student, said seeing such an important figure in politics would be too interesting to miss.

A Gainesville man was arrest-
ed early Monday after he was ac-
cused of burglary and said he’d been running on a trail.
Officers found a 13-year-old 
boy hiding in some bushes near Creeks Edge Condominiums, ac-cording to a Gainesville Police ar-rest report. Then, they saw a man later 
identified as 19-year-old Kyeem Wilson running from a dark tree-
line.
When officers found Wilson, 
his shin was bleeding, and he 
had dirt and plant matter on his shoes, according to the report.
Wilson told officers he had 
gone for a run near Gainesville High School and had jogged down a trail, according to the re-
port.
But the statement raised offi-
cers’ suspicions.
“Going for a run through a 
dark wooded trail minutes be-fore midnight is not usual for 
law-abiding individuals,” wrote arresting officer Aaron Stemen.
Later, the 13-year-old said 
he and Wilson went into an un-locked apartment and took a laptop off the couch and an MP3 player from a car, according to the report.
Officers found the computer 
in a duffel bag. 
So far, no victims have come 
forward, according to the report.
Wilson was arrested on a 
charge of loitering and prowling and taken to the Alachua County Jail, where he was later released.Man arrested for loitering, prowlingLOCALHippodrome reaches

Many regulars just played to keep busy
predetermined by the game’s pro-
gramming, thus taking the chance factor out of the games.
“You’re gonna get what you’re 
gonna get,” she said, comparing it 
to the popular McDonald’s lottery 
game, where restaurant patrons pull tabs off menu items and collect the pieces to win prizes.
The games also don’t involve 
skill. To play another turn, patrons just click a button on the bottom cor-ner of the screen. 
But, “people love it,” Westbrook 
said. 
As she explained the games, pa-
trons sat with their faces bathed in a bluish glow, clicking to play the next round, buying more Internet access or switching games.
“It’s just a mindless gesture,” 
said 52-year-old Donna Libby, play-ing Aqua Splash, one of the newest and most popular games.  
Libby said much of the excite-
ment accompanying the game came 
from the gambling aspect when she 
didn’t know how much she would win. However, she said, she still en-joys playing — that it’s something to do on a slow afternoon.
Just before the detectives came 
out with stacks of confiscated com-puters Tuesday, Libby drove up, cellphone in hand. She predicted 
many of the cafe’s regular patrons 
will do what they did in the hiatus between the law going into effect and the opening of Gators Hot Spot: catch a bus south to the Seminole Hard Rock Casino. She was one of many who drove 
cars, rode bikes and walked up to the business hoping to use computers on 
the day of the raid. They gathered in 
the parking lot with their windows down, yelling back and forth to de-cipher the story and phoning their friends to share the news. 
Roger Scott, 48, had ridden his 
bike to the cafe, prepared to redeem his access card which had $10 left over from his last visit. 
But Lt. Halvosa said police won’t 
deal with patrons’ outstanding cred-it.
“It’s something they’ll have to 
handle with the business,” he said.
Aside from losing some money, 
Scott agreed with many other regu-lars that the cafe was an outlet away from home.
“It was something to keep you 
out of trouble,” he said. “People got to have somewhere to go.”

Gainesville Police’s goal is to stop jaywalking, keep people safe
“A cop flashed his lights, and his siren 
went off, but I thought he was just pulling a 
car over,” Tulande said. “I think it is effective 
in the sense that I won’t ever jaywalk on 
University again.”
Tobias said the goal is to prevent 
jaywalking on University Avenue.
“Whether they do it elsewhere or what, 
we’ve at least corrected that particular problem,” he said.
Tulande said she suspects GPD is simply 
trying to make money off of students.
But Tobias said the tickets are not for 
revenue building.“If it hits you in your wallet, and it hurts a 
little bit, you’re less likely to make that same mistake again,” he said.
One student took his ticket to court.Donovan Triplett, a 20-year-old UF 
advertising senior, was walking on the crosswalk when an officer wrote him a jaywalking ticket.
The officer had traffic stopped both ways, 
so Triplett said he assumed he could walk 
across. Triplett, with his headphones in, said he 
felt the officer pull his backpack and tell him 
he was not allowed to walk.
Triplett brought his case to court and lost. He had to pay his jaywalking ticket and 
take a driver’s improvement course.
Tobias said whether commuters are 
pedestrians, drivers or bikers, they usually think they have the right of way.
“We’re just trying to keep everyone safe,” 
Tobias said.WALK , from page 1Donilon

Sen. Paul O’Quinn voices his concern for pulling $20,000 from Student Government reserves to 
fund a campus veteran memorial. The memorial will go on to the second reading next week.
� IT WILL COST $84,509.  
COLLEEN WRIGHT
Alligator Staff Writer cwright@alligator.org
The Reitz Union might get one 
more project tacked on to its con-
struction to-do list.
While four other bills unani-
mously sailed onto a second read-ing at Tuesday night’s Student Senate meeting, one bill supply-ing funds for an improved cam-pus veterans memorial simmered in the Senate chambers.
Senators Michael Filipelli and 
Joseph Michaels proposed an al-location of $20,000 of reserve Stu-dent Government funds to reno-vate the current Veteran Memorial at Liberty Pond. The updated memorial will include 11 gran-ite monuments engraved with enough space for 1,200 names of UF attendees who have fallen as soldiers.
The whole project costs $84,509. 
The remaining cost is planned to be included within the Reitz Union construction project budget.
Although he was in favor of the 
project, Sen. Paul O’Quinn was concerned about pulling from the reserve funds and suggested sav-ing the project until the next fiscal year.
“This is an expense that can be 
planned in advance,” he said. “I feel the reserve is an emergency fund.”
Sen. Elliot Grasso defended the 
proposal, explaining that pulling from the reserve funds would not hurt funds for student organiza-tions.
“This is a great use of funds,” 
he said. “It’s something that every Gator can benefit from.”Memorial could become

Anger is the most influential 
emotion on social media, a recent 
study shows, and negative online reactions to the Miss America pag-eant results seem to reinforce the 
findings.
Angry and racist responses to 
the crowning of Nina Davuluri, a 
24-year-old Indian American from New York, seem to follow the pat-tern identified by the study con-ducted by researchers at China’s Beihang University.
The study found anger to be the 
most influential emotion on social media.
Anju Kaduvettoor Davidson, 
assistant director of the UF Center 
for the Study of Race and Race Re-

“There’s some racism related to 
9/11 or terrorism, and people are uneducated about where people are from,” said Davidson, an Indian American. “I think people end up 
using that information to general-
ize, and they take out some of the anger about other things and apply it here.”
According to study results 
published in an MIT Technology Review on Monday, the research team focused on the way messages labeled with certain emotions influ-
enced people on the same network.
The study observed Weibo, a 
Chinese social media platform sim-
ilar to Twitter, to gather its data.
The researchers concluded that angry messages were more likely to be reposted up to three degrees from the original user — this in-
cluded angry responses to the origi-
nal message.
A few factors might attribute 
to this behavior, said Andrew Selepak, director of UF’s online master’s program specialization in social media.
“The first is the anonymous 
aspect of social media,” he said.  
“People think they have the ability 
to say anything, and they can hide behind a username and believe that no one can find them in real life.”
Carlos Soria, a 32-year-old UF 
mass communication graduate stu-dent, agreed social media makes it easier to share angry emotions. 
“The power of social media has 
given users a mask to spew hatred online, and it continues to have a major impact on the way we anony-mously communicate,” he said.
Davidson said she wonders if 
the people tweeting angry remarks would act differently if they didn’t have a cyber mask to hide behind.
“People feel they have more of 
an outlet to be heard on something like social media,” she said. “It’s semi-anonymous, but would these people say it outside of this cy-ber world? If she was in the room would they still say it?”

HAS A GOAL OF $10,000.

Local inventors are going live with 
their online campaign to fund produc-
tion of a device designed to cool bever-ages in seconds.
Trevor Abbott, a UF mechanical en-
gineering senior, and Ty Parker, a UF mechanical engineering alumnus, de-
signed Spin Chill, a cylinder that uses a 
drill to spin a can of beer or soda in ice and cools it within 30 to 60 seconds.
Abbott and Parker came up with the 
idea for Spin Chill while they were par-ticipants in the HackerHouse program for entrepreneurs. Abbott said eight cadets lived in a house downtown for 
three months to plan their inventions.After finding a warm case of beer in 
an RV, they decided to create something 
that would make the beer cold. Abbott said after spending hours in Walmart, he and Parker found a Black & Decker drill, ripped it apart and threw together their new invention.
Abbott said the 30-day Kickstarter 
campaign has a goal to raise $10,000. If Abbott and Parker do not reach their 
goal, they will not receive any of the 
pledges.
The two inventors have been spread-
ing the word about Spin Chill and their campaign by visiting gameday tailgates and posting on social media.
Reed White, a 22-year-old UF me-
chanical engineering senior, said he was impressed with Spin Chill’s con-
cept.
“I think it’s a great idea, and I’m ex-
cited to see what will come from it,” he 
said.Locals try to kickstart

With campaign season in 
full swing, political parties are 
back on campus with posters, flyers, pledge cards, buttons and T-shirts.
Members of the Students 
Party and the Swamp Party stood on Turlington Plaza and at the Reitz Union on Monday and Tuesday to gather ideas to form their platforms for the upcoming Fall elections, which are on Oct. 1 and 2. Both parties will release their platforms later this week.
Students Party volunteers 
had students write their ideas on poster placards. Sugges-tions included covered bus stops, transparency in Student Government spending and late-night food options.
Public health management 
and policy graduate student Kattyana Adrien, 22, suggest-ed tutoring sessions for classes other than science and math.
“What you’ll see on our 
platform are tangible ideas that students can be a part of,” said party campaign manager Helie Dharia.
The Swamp Party filled six 
poster boards of ideas. Among them were: more parking on campus, a puppy room and healthier food options.
“Right now it’s important 
for candidates to meet hope-fully future constituents,” said party spokesman Joseph Michaels.
UF public relations gradu-
ate student Bridget Robinson, 25, stopped by the Swamp Party table near the Reitz Union and checked off previ-ous suggestions.
She said she felt graduate 
students are often forgotten among undergraduate orga-nizations.
“We’re still a part of the 
campus,” she said. “We can play a big role in the election depending on which party we vote for.”

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgTuesday’s question: Do you like 
OneRepublic? Today’s question: Do you jaywalk?Know your Title IX 
rights; hold schools 
accountable
Believe it or not, Title IX is about much more than protect-
ing women athletes. A new student-run grassroots organi-zation, “Know Your IX,” seeks to educate students about 
their rights under the law and their school’s responsibilities to comply with Title IX’s stipulations.
Title IX protects students — whether they’re in high school 
or college — against sex-based discrimination in education. It protects pregnant students, women pursuing degrees in STEM ﬁ  elds and victims of rape, sexual assault, intimate partner vio-lence and stalking. And it’s not just for women. Men may also ﬁ  le Title IX complaints if they are raped, sexually harassed or discriminated against. 
One of the most important tenants of Title IX includes which 
actions universities are required to take to ensure that a victim 
may continue his or her education free of discrimination and 
violence.
“Along with issuing a no contact directive to the accused, a 
schools must ensure any reasonable changes to your housing, class or sports schedule, campus job, or extracurricular activity and clubs are made to ensure you can continue your education free from any ongoing sex discrimination, sexual harassment or sexual violence,” states the Know Your IX website.  
Filing a Title IX complaint against schools that mishandle 
rape and sexual assault cases is imperative. Now that more stu-dents are coming forward with their stories, our nation is faced with a hard truth: Universities are not well-equipped to handle sexual assault cases. 
In a Chronicle of Higher Education article published last 
week, writer Casey McDermott addressed the conﬂ  icts universi-ties faced when dealing with sexual-assault cases. 
“While colleges are generally equipped to handle infractions 
like theft or plagiarism, they often lack the tools for dealing with 
sexual violence as the law demands,” McDermott wrote. 
The U.S. Department of Education announced in February 
it contacted state school chiefs requesting they tighten up their 
efforts to reduce sex-based discrimination and violence in their schools. Although this is a step in the right direction, more pres-sure — and consequences for schools that don’t comply — is needed from the federal government to affect change. 
“Colleges wrestle with endless questions,” McDermott wrote. 
“Who should ﬁ  eld sexual-assault reports, and who should inves-
tigate them? What skills should those people have? How much 
would it cost to hire or train investigators? How can the process balance the rights and sensitivities of accusing and accused stu-dents, both before and during a hearing?”
“And if a student is found responsible for misconduct,” Mc-
Dermott wrote, “then what?”
While colleges search for solutions to improve their ap-
proaches to investigate campus sex crimes, the best thing stu-dents can do is continue ﬁ  ling Title IX complaints to the Depart-
ment of Education Ofﬁ  ce of Civil Rights. To learn more about 
your rights under Title IX, visit knowyourxi.org.‘Fahrenheit 451’ lesson: Read the Quran
Terry Jones’ insatiable hunger for the media’s spot-
light was brieﬂ  y fed last week when news of his arrest broke. 
He got busted with thousands of kerosene-soaked 
Qurans at a Mulberry park. 
As a Muslim columnist, here’s the response — rooted 
in the Islamic tradition — to Jones’ antics. 
For us, all religious scriptures are revered. The He-
brew Bible and Gospels are sacred texts. No sane Muslim could ever disrespect the Torah, the Psalms or the New Testament.
The Quran is similar — with only one exception. All the famous prophets of the Biblical tradition came 
with miracles. Without Jesus’ healing hands or Moses’ sea-parting staff, how could their communities know if the men were legit? In Islam, Muhammad is the ﬁ  nal prophet sent to humanity. God couldn’t give him a gim-mick that would last only a few years, so, according to tradition, Muhammad received the divine Quran, piece-meal over a period of twenty-three years.
Neither prose nor poetry, the Quran claims itself to be 
“a Book whose verses are perfected and expounded from the One.” The unique elegance and universal relevance of the text has led to readers, like the “Life of Pi” author, Yann Martel, saying, “When you read the Quran there’s a certain voice there where you feel the hot breath of God in your ear, a great intensity.”
Thomas Jefferson used to study the book, Mahatma 
Gandhi used to recite its verses and Edgar Allan Poe’s longest poem is entirely based on the Quran. 
Whether it’s the spiritual force or the personal touch, 
some elements of the Quran have always resonated with open-minded folks. For 1.6 billion people today, the words of the Quran are words directly from God.
As a curious atheist probing the translation, author 
Jeffrey Lang recalls, “You cannot simply read the Quran, not if you take it seriously. You either have surrendered to it already or you ﬁ  ght it. It attacks tenaciously, directly, personally; it debates, criticizes, shames, and challenges. From the outset it draws the line of battle, and I was on the other side. I was at a severe disadvan-tage, for it became clear that the Author knew me better than I 
knew myself.”  
With the Quranic reminder — let there be no compul-
sion in religion — echoing in my head, don’t mistake my message for a thinly veiled proselytizing attempt. 
My request is actually very simple.Most of us are familiar with Ray Bradbury’s “Fahr-
enheit 451,” the classic American novel about a totalitar-ian society where “ﬁ  remen” suppress ideas by burning books. Terry Jones is widely ridiculed when he takes the role of a present-day “ﬁ  reman.”
But here’s the problem: “There are worse crimes than 
burning books. One of them is not reading them,” Brad-bury said. 
My request to you is the same as the ﬁ  rst word re-
vealed in the Quran: “Read,” in this case, an English translation of the Quran. 
Once you’ve gently broken this scriptural virginity, 
the Muslim pain over Terry Jones’ behavior will make some sense. 
By drowning ignorance with a quest for knowledge, 
the curious reader will realize why the Quran continues to be so dear to the  hearts of so many. 
As Johann Wolfgang von Goethe said centuries ago: 
“Can the Quran from Eternity be? ‘Tis worth not a thought! I believe, as a Muslim ought, that wine from Eternity must be.”

Response to Richard Vieira’s Friday 
column
In response to Richard Vieira’s article 
on U.S. intervention, I wish to reiterate 
that self-determination for the Syrian peo-
ple doesn’t equate to a regime change by the U.S. or any other foreign government. 
Also, his mention of Hezbollah being a terrorist group is meaningless when the 
state department labeled Nelson Mandela 
and African National Congress a terrorist 
organization until 2008. 
It’s not surprising that an anti-imperial-
ist group that has the hearts and minds of 
the people resisting domination would be 
classiﬁ  ed as a terrorist group by the U.S. and Israel. 
He also described the Christian popu-
lation without any mention of the attacks 
they have faced at the hands of the Free 
Syrian Army where the Assad government serves as their only protection against eth-
nic cleansing. 
To end, his notion that Syria must be Balkanized shows his lack of understand-ing of the how disastrous that would be 
for the Syrian people. Why are Americans 
being used as pawns to support a group 
that has elements of al-Qaeda and waves a colonial French mandate ﬂ  ag?

Last week, Yeezus Tour tickets for Kanye West 
and Kendrick Lamar performances came out. Here are a couple of things you probably had 
to go through to get them.
1. Peer pressure. Before attempting to purchase 
your tickets, you probably had a lot of your friends 
telling you, “YOU CAN’T NOT BUY THEM. IT’S BOTH OF THEM. AND US. AND MAYBE EVEN NORTH WEST.” And after hearing different ver-sions of this, you probably succumbed and went to the ticket website immediately.
2. The refresh button. If you have spent many a 
night trying to be the ﬁ  rst one to click the “Buy Tick-ets” button for a special concert, you know how this feels. Who knew that one button could have #allthat-power?
3. Stressful internal debates about ticket prices. 
You probably had some real mental struggles when you realized you had to resort to spending more than double the original price you were going to have to pay. You probably told yourself, “Well, I’ll 
just starve for the next month” and went ahead and 
spent that extra $100. You probably felt guilty, but the thought of K and K being in the same room as you was enough to make you go through with it.
4. Realizing that you paid more than you should 
have. After all the beautiful fantasies of yourself jumping into swimming pools full of liquor with Yeezy and Kendrick — and using those dreams as your validation for buying tickets — you may or 
may not have realized that you 
could have paid a lot less than you already did. It’s 
OK. We’ve been there.
5. Excessively listening to Kendrick and Kanye. 
You and your fellow concert-goers probably cre-ated a new Yeezus Tour playlist on Spotify that you shared with each other and have been listening to in between classes, while you’re studying, before you go to sleep, when you wake up in the morning, while 
you’re using the bathroom, while you’re working 
out and while you’re getting #turntup.
We hope you were happy with your ﬁ  nal deci-
sion. If you’re concerned about the ﬁ  nancial aspect of it, remember that you can always sell your ticket! There are tons of Kanye and Kendrick fans around you on this hip and happenin’ campus, so don’t worry too much. 
And if you decide not to sell your ticket and that 
you’re gonna get down, girl, go ‘head get down, then all we have to say to you is, “See you there!”

California Berkeley’s student newspaper, The Daily Cali-fornian. This piece originally appeared on UWire.How you felt buying Yeezus ticketsUWire

 Since the enact-
ment of the Af-fordable Care 
Act, President Barack Obama’s signature 
health care law in 
March 2010, Repub-licans at all levels of government have made every effort to weaken and sabotage the law.
The Republican-controlled 
U.S. House of Representatives has voted a staggering 40 times to re-
peal some or all of the legislation. 
They have held these repeal votes despite the fact that the propos-als stand no chance of passing the Democratic-held Senate or being approved by the president.
At the state level, many Re-
publican governors have refused funds provided by the federal gov-
ernment under the act to expand 
Medicaid, the popular state-based program that provides health care to the poor. As of June, governors of 13 states, mostly in the South, had publicly stated their refusal to cooperate in the Medicaid expan-sion. Gov. Rick Scott of Florida initially refused these funds be-
fore he relented and agreed to the 
expansion in February under pres-sure from health care advocacy groups.
The latest Republican attempt 
to sabotage the Affordable Care Act relates to individuals known as health care “navigators.” These “navigators” are employed by 
community health organizations 
and other social service groups and are tasked with helping unin-sured Americans ﬁ  nd the best and most affordable health insurance possible.
Many of the people who will 
beneﬁ  t the most from the Afford-able Care Act have never had ac-
cess to health insurance and there-
fore need the assistance of trained professionals to ﬁ  nd appropriate and affordable coverage.
Republican state ofﬁ  cials across 
the country have placed severe re-strictions on these navigators. In Georgia, the state insurance com-missioner issued a requirement 
that the navigators pass the same 
exam administered to insurance brokers, despite the fact that fed-eral law clearly separates the two positions.
At least 16 states have issued 
some kind of regulation restricting the ability of the navigators to do their jobs and enroll individuals in 
new health insurance plans.
Gov. Scott’s administration re-
cently joined in on the trend of at-
tacking the health care navigators.  A directive issued by the Florida Department of Health bans the outreach activities of navigators hired to help uninsured Flor-ida residents sign up for health insurance.
A spokeswoman 
for the Florida De-partment of Health, Ashley Carr, wrote that “Navigators are 
not acting on behalf of the [Flor-ida] Department of Health and this program has raised privacy concerns due to the consumer in-
formation that will be gathered for 
use in a federal database.”
Although much of the Re-
publican opposition to the health care law stems from concerns about government intrusion, the concerns Florida ofﬁ  cials have expressed about the creation of a federal health database are com-
pletely unfounded.
“Contrary to Gov. Scott’s state-
ments, consumers will never be 
asked to provide their personal health information to the market-place, whether through a naviga-tor or not,” U.S. Department of Health & Human Services spokes-woman Joanne Peters told the 
Hufﬁ  ngton Post. “There is no such 
database of American’s health in-formation, and multiple indepen-dent fact checkers have debunked this claim.”
Ironically, by imposing these 
burdensome and harsh regula-tions on the navigators, these Re-publicans are engaging in the same 
kind of unnecessary government 
overreach they claim to oppose. The restrictions on navigators is-sued by the Scott administration represent a reﬂ  exive and harmful opposition to Obama’s policies, regardless of the beneﬁ  ts they pro-vide to the people of Florida.
According to the U.S. Census 
Bureau, nearly 3.8 million Floridi-ans — about a quarter of the state’s population — are uninsured, giving Florida the third-highest rate of uninsured residents in the country. Florida would therefore be one of the states to beneﬁ  t most from the services of the naviga-tors.
Regardless of whether Repub-
licans support the health insur-ance framework the Affordable Care Act creates, the role of these navigators is simply to help con-sumers ﬁ  nd the best coverage for them. Gov. Scott and his fellow state-level Republicans should get past their strident and thoughtless 
opposition to the Affordable Care 
Act and focus instead on helping their constituents.

Jayson Blaire said he wanted 
to join a fraternity before 
entering college — until he 
realized drinking heavily was 
one of the requirements to be accepted.
“It’s really not that 
uncommon,” said the 18-year-old UF family, youth and community sciences freshman. “Everyone does it. What’s crazy is that it’s bad in college, but in 
high school it was even worse.”
A study published Monday 
confirms the norm Blaire 
experienced, finding that one 
in 10 high school seniors are 
extreme binge drinkers. The study, which was published in JAMA Pediatrics, a Journal of the American Medical Association 
Network Publication, defined 
extreme binge drinking as consuming 10 or more drinks in one sitting. 
It found that the percentage 
of high school seniors who report binge drinking has decreased from 22 percent in 2005 to 18.1 percent in 2011, but 
the percentage of extreme binge 
drinkers has remained virtually the same.
Young adults who binge drink 
can experience consequences, 
said Dollicia Green, a registered 
nurse who works on the neurosurgery floor at UF Health Shands Hospital.
“There’s a lot of damage 
that happens,” Green said. “It physically changes the brain and thins the prefrontal cortex. Really, you’re losing brain 
cells each time you do it. It’s 
important to understand that these are real-life effects. It’s more serious than we tend to 
think.”
Social drinkers who begin 
consuming alcohol at an early 
age have increased chances of addiction, said Maureen Miller, 
director at GatorWell Health 
Promotion Services.
“There’s been quite a bit of 
research that says that the brain 
is continuously developing well 
into the 20s,” she said. “So the issue of potentially becoming 
addicted even at a young age is an important psychological 
effect that comes into play when dealing with binge drinkers.”
But there isn’t a magical 
answer to getting young adults 
to slow down, Miller said.
“The environment — the 
culture we live in — promotes 
the message that teen drinking is OK,” she said. “It’s a billion-
dollar industry. Think about 
the accessibility of alcohol. It’s cheaper than buying a bottle of water in some cases, and it’s right across from campus.”
Given the popularity of 
alcohol among a younger crowd, Blaire said, some things don’t change after high school.
“It’s like, if you didn’t drink 
you weren’t cool,” he said. “People wouldn’t invite you to parties. You were just weird. In high school, it was like that, and 
it’s like that now in college.”8, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 2013

Three local groups have teamed up to 
launch My Gainesville Map, a community 
project where residents can create person-alized maps of the city.
The project is a three-way partnership 
between KHH Consulting, IndieGaines-ville and the Gainesville Community Re-development Agency.
Residents are asked to draw over a 
blank outline of the city, filling the space however they see fit.
The project is an intersection of map-
ping, community building and citizen art, said Katherine Henderson, head of KHH 
Consulting and adjunct professor at UF’s 
College of Design, Construction & Plan-ning.
The idea for the project was inspired by 
the book “Mapping Manhattan” by Becky Cooper, which is a collection of personal-ized maps of Manhattan made by locals. 
Henderson, who helped come up with 
the project, said she wondered what kind 
of maps Gainesville residents would cre-
ate.
Henderson said the maps are meant to 
be a personal interpretation of the city.
“People could use their map as an op-
portunity to write down things they miss,” she said. “They could use it as an oppor-tunity to talk about something they think should change.”In fact, the Gainesville Community 
Redevelopment Agency hopes to use the maps to see what the citizens want out of the city, said Sarah Vidal-Finn, senior analyst at the agency and one of the other founders of the project.
The maps would open a conversa-
tion between the citizens and those who 
can change the city, Henderson said. The 
maps are an opportunity to express ideas for the city with a lot of people listening, including the redevelopment agency.
The maps can be downloaded from 
www.mygainesvillemap.com or picked up at Gifthorse Clothing, Persona Vintage Clothing & Costumes or at the Gainesville Community Redevelopment Agency. 
Maps will be posted on the website, 
and once enough maps are collected, Hen-derson said she hopes there will be a pub-lic showing.
John Fechtel, a 23-year-old UF archi-
tecture and sustainability and the built en-vironment junior, said he would be very interested in creating a map of his own.
Seeing the maps other people create 
would also be a great way to discover parts 
of Gainesville he never realized existed.
“I mean, I just discovered Burrito 
Brothers for the first time last semester,” 
he said. “There’s a lot more than meets the eye in Gainesville. You get a much more complete picture of Gainesville when you get a collective experience.”Residents, agencies

11 OUT OF 15 FOR IMPORTANCE. 
BAILEY MULLINS 
Alligator Contributing Writer
With the 40th anniversary of the Endan-
gered Species Act approaching, a new UF 
Institute of Food and Agricultural sciences survey has found that Floridians are making protecting endangered species a priority.
The online survey of 499 Floridians found 
that respondents ranked the importance of endangered species 11th out of 15 public issues and were strong supporters of legal protections for endangered species. 
 “The survey was conducted basically to 
assess where Floridians are at with respect to endangered species,” said Tracy Irani, direc-tor of the Center for Public Issues Education 
in Agriculture and Natural Resources.
Not only are Floridians strong support-
ers of the Endangered Species Act, but also  
66 percent of respondents felt it should be strengthened, even if that means infringe-ment on personal freedom and fines for vio-lators.
The act was created in 1973 to protect 
plants and animals that have declined in 
numbers usually due to human activity, said 
Dan Evans, technology and research special-ist at the Gainesville-based Sea Turtle Con-servancy.
The act has some loopholes — many due 
to enforcement, said Evans.
“It is very difficult to prove that someone 
has harmed or harassed an endangered spe-cies in a court of law,” he said.
Florida has 47 endangered animal spe-
cies and 44 endangered plant species. The biodiversity in Florida puts environmental issues high on Floridians’ radar, according to Irani.
“I think it’s the nature of the state,” she 
said, “we are in the natural habitat a lot more.”
However, 23 percent of respondents said 
they were likely to actively protect the en-vironment through activities like joining a conservation group, while 55 percent said they were more likely to avoid doing any-
thing harmful.
Evans said the biggest way to engage 
people in conservation activities is through 
education.
“It’s sort of a cliché,” Evans said, “The 
biggest thing is letting people know easy steps they can take to be proactive, rather than big, colossal, life-changing things.”
Evans said when environmental issues 
impact people personally, they are more likely to take action.
“My mother-in-law lives in Central Flor-
ida and is becoming more aware of water issues because of the sinkholes,” Evans said.
The survey was one of four public opin-
ion panels the UF Institute of Food and Agri-cultural Sciences will conduct this year, Irani said. The institute hopes to continue to con-
duct the surveys annually.Endangered animals a priorityEmily Cochrane / Alligator

Alachua County Public Schools 
teachers and employees are now 
featured artists at the Thomas Cen-
ter Gallery this season.
A new exhibit opened Friday 
titled “The Artist in All of Us,” 
which showcases a variety of piec-
es created by Alachua County art 
teachers and other employees.
The show is scheduled to run 
through Nov. 16 and is located in the Thomas Center’s Mezzanine 
Gallery, located at 302 NE Sixth 
Ave. 
This is the ﬁ  rst year the coun-
ty schools’ staff exhibition was 
opened up to all employees of the 
county schools, not just the art teachers, said Debbie Gallagher, an Alachua County Public Schools curriculum specialist.
“We came in with open arms 
and invited everyone to participate this year,” she said.
The exhibit features about 50 
pieces from more than 20 artists including paintings, drawings, col-lages, sculptures, mosaics, textile works, photographs and furniture, according to a news release. 
One of the custodians does 
graphite sketches that will be fea-tured in the gallery, too, Gallagher said.
The pieces were chosen for the 
gallery by a committee of city and county ofﬁ  cials who reviewed dig-ital submissions of the artwork in the spring and narrowed it down to about 50 entries, Gallagher said.
Diane Brody, a recently retired 
Alachua County science teacher, will have three oil paintings de-picting nature scenes displayed in 
the exhibit.
“I was passionate about pass-
ing on what I knew as a teacher,” 
Brody said. “Now I’m passionate about painting the environment to remind people how special and 
fragile it is.”
Brody worked as a teacher in 
the state of Florida for 24 years and 
in Alachua County for seven.
“I’m an environmentalist,” she 
said. “That’s what drives me as an artist.”
A reception for the exhibition 
will be held Oct. 4 from 5:30 to 8 
p.m. at the Historic Thomas Cen-
ter.WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 9

along Northwest 16th and 23rd Avenue, one business owner is trying to take matters into his own hands. Rob Pruitt, the owner of Father 
Phil’s restaurant in Millhopper Square, said 
the weeds are bad for business. 
He sent an email to David Cerlanek in the 
Alachua County Public Works Department offering to take on the median maintenance himself. But in return, he asked for supplies including a push mower and a weed eater. 
“I can tell you without a doubt I can do ev-
erything cheaper than a government bureau-
cracy,” Pruitt wrote in the email.
Cerlanek responded to Pruitt, saying me-
dian work can be dangerous. He said the 
medians are currently maintained by inmates and funded by the county. Heavy rainfall and declining resources cause delays in the main-tenance, he said.
“Your excuse for lack of funding and 
weather as reasons you cannot maintain the roadways in this city is just more bureaucratic BS,” Pruitt responded later. 
Pruitt isn’t the only one concerned with the 
median’s appearance. 
“The road is one of the worst in town,” 
wrote resident Becky Hoover in an email to city commissioners.
Regardless of how it gets done, Gillies 
Marllart, of On the Spot Dry Cleaning located in Millhopper Square, agreed more rigorous 
maintenance would be better for business. 
“Your business does better when the area is 
more inviting,” he said.Messy medians spark complaint
� IT WILL RAISE MONEY FOR 
GATORS MARCH FOR BABIES.
NICOLE EARLY
Alligator Contributing Writer
Collier Companies will host its ﬁ  rst 
food truck rally to beneﬁ  t Gators March 
for Babies and the March of Dimes at the Enclave apartments on Thursday from 5 to 9 p.m.  
Ten percent of all sales will go di-
rectly to the charity, said Jennifer Cowie, Enclave marketing manager.
Vendors conﬁ  rmed for the event in-
clude Charlie’s Snow Shack, Go Go Stuff Yourself, Humble Pie, Off the Griddle and Sherri’s Pop Up.
Kyle Croft, local director for Gainesville March of Dimes, said Collier Companies is one of the organization’s biggest sponsors, and Gators March for Babies is the No. 1 collegiate walk in the country. 
The fundraising team that raises the 
most money will receive the Collier cup 
trophy, Cowie said. 
Because the rally will be held at the 
Enclave apartments, parking will be 
ample and it will allow more people to attend, Cowie said.
At the event, patrons can check in via 
social media and be entered to win a $50 gift card. 
Brett Ader, the owner of Humble Pie, 
said these events tend to be a success for both vendors and residents. 
 “A lot of these events are so well-at-
tended that they sell out,” he said. Food truck rally Thursday“I was passionate about 
passing on what I knew as a 
teacher.”

Senior wide receiver Trey Burton runs down the field during Florida’s 21-16 loss to Miami on Sept. 7 in Sun Life Stadium. 
ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
Alligator Staff Writer @alichtenstein24
A year ago, Trey Burton was on 
top of the world. 
The junior running back rushed 
for 91 yards and two touchdowns 
against one of the Gators’ biggest 
rivals.
Burton’s second touchdown — 
an 80-yard carry — was the first of 
four unanswered Florida scores in 
the second half against Tennessee 
in Neyland Stadium as the Gators 
defeated the Volunteers 37-20. 
“You know, we were down at 
halftime and we came back in the 
second half and played really well 
as an offense,” Burton said.
But Burton has not replicated 
that success on the ground since that night in Knoxville, Tenn.
Both of the senior’s touchdown 
runs against Tennessee last year were out of the Wildcat package, where Burton lines up at quarter-
back and takes snaps. The forma-tion is designed to confuse the defense so Burton can break off a 
big gain. 
It worked against the Volun-
teers but has seen only mixed re-
sults since then.
Since that game, Burton has 
rushed 27 times from the Wildcat 
package for a total of 95 yards — 
an average of 3.5 yards per carry.
Offensive coordinator Brent 
Pease said Tuesday that he be-lieves the package is generally suc-
cessful, working a majority of the 
time. But when Burton rushes out 
of that package, he usually fails to 
gain much ground. 
Six of Burton’s 27 rushing at-tempts have gone for negative yards since UF played UT last 
year. When Burton did advance 
the ball on the ground, it was often 
only for a modest gain. Thirteen of 
those 27 rushes went for gains of 5 
yards or fewer.
Despite the lukewarm results, 
Pease said the Gators will stick 
with Burton in the Wildcat. Other 
Gators believe the package can 
continue to be successful, too.
“I really, really enjoy [the Wild-
cat],” Burton said. 
“I think it works really well. I 
think we wouldn’t do it if it didn’t work.”
Added defensive lineman 
Damien Jacobs: “It’s going to be a mismatch for a lot of people, be-
cause Trey just has a nose for the 
end zone.”
The mismatch did work occa-
sionally in 2012 aside from Ten-
nessee. Burton managed three 
runs of 10 or more yards, includ-
ing a 24-yard carry against Florida 
State that helped lead Florida to a 
Caleb Sturgis field goal.
“I think we’re always trying to 
see where in the open field, where 
in the red zone we can put him in that situation and make some 
plays,” Pease said. 
Florida has had more success when other players get their hands 
on the ball out of the Wildcat. 
For the rest of the regular sea-
son following UF’s win against 
UT, when Burton lined up at quar-
terback and handed the ball off, 
ball carriers averaged 8.2 yards 
per touch. Former wide receiver 
Omarius Hines averaged 10.8 
yards in the Wildcat; former run-
ning back Mike Gillislee averaged 
5 yards out of the formation.
Both of those players are gone. 
The two players who received touches from Burton who are still 
on the roster are wideout Solomon 
Patton and tailback Matt Jones. 
The two combined for 20 yards on 
three rushes.
“I think it’s a big plus with Sol-
omon with so much speed,” Jacobs said. 
“[He and Burton] can make big 
plays on that all day.”
Burton has moved around the 
offense since he came to Florida. Originally a quarterback, he has 
had limited opportunities to throw 
out of the Wildcat.
Since the Gators played the 
Volunteers last season, he has thrown four times, completing 
three passes for 4 yards. His last 
pass attempt was an incompletion 
directed to his brother, tight end 
Clay Burton, against Florida State.
The Wildcat is primarily a run-
ning package, but depending on Pease’s play calls, Burton may get 
a chance to relive his past exploits 
— whether it is his long runs from last year or his passes from high 
school.
“We’ll find out on Saturday,” 
Burton said.Wildcat providing mixed results for UF
� FLORIDA SCORED NINE POINTS ON 
SIX RED-ZONE TRIPS AGAINST MIAMI.
JOE MORGAN
Alligator Staff Writer @joe_morgan
Still looking for a scapegoat to take the 
fall for Florida’s red-zone struggles in its 
21-16 loss to Miami in Sun Life Stadium on 
Sept. 7? 
Brent Pease will take the blame.
The second-year UF offensive coordina-
tor put the Gators’ failures inside the 20-
yard line against the Hurricanes squarely 
on his own shoulders Tuesday.
“Me, in particular, I have to do a better 
job,” Pease said.
Florida enjoyed an efficient game offen-
sively under Pease’s direction, racking up 413 yards of total offense against the Hur-ricanes. 
But the Gators turned the ball over 
five times and came away with only nine points in six red-zone trips during the five-point loss.
Quarterback Jeff Driskel, who threw for 
a career-high 291 yards, received heavy criticism following the game after ending two red-zone possessions with intercep-tions. 
Pease said Driskel’s miscues were a re-
sult of how he handled the junior signal caller.
“We’ve all got liabilities,” Pease said. 
“I’ve got to do a better job of maybe limit-
ing or controlling what we give him. The 
options. He’s mature enough. He’ll handle things.”Pease also admired Driskel’s maturity 
off the field in handling criticism follow-
ing the loss. The offensive coordinator 
said accepting a disproportionate share of blame for losing is just part of being a quarterback.
“Jeff’s a strong kid. 
I don’t think anybody deserves all the blame,” Pease said. 
“He understands when 
he makes a mistake, but 
he’s a competitor. He’s never going to just give up. You’ve got to appre-
ciate him at some point in time on that.”
Halapio to return: Coach Will Mus-
champ announced Monday that Jon Hala-pio (partially torn pectoral muscle) will start at right guard against Tennessee on Saturday at 3:30 p.m. 
Florida is excited to get Halapio back, 
but the team acknowledged it may take the redshirt senior time to adjust to game speed.
“He might just have to knock the rust 
off the hinges a little bit,” center Jon Har-rison said. 
“Knowledge-wise, his competence is 
there. Just like the physical part about it, 
of course, he’s missed a little bit of football 
now, so there’s just going to be that little acclimation period.”
Even if Halapio needs time to adjust 
to the physicality of a game, Harrison be-
lieves the return of the Gators’ right guard 
will help the offensive line’s communica-

trying to see where in the

zone we can put [Burton]

some plays.”

Last season, Florida dropped the 
first two sets to Florida State and lost 
any chance at a comeback by digging itself  a 4-0 hole to begin the third set. 
The Gators ended up losing their 
first match to the Seminoles in 18 years.
On Tuesday, No. 4 Florida picked 
up where it left off, letting No. 17 FSU jump out to a 4-0 start at the O’Connell Center.
“It’s definitely scary when you play 
a team like Florida State and you get down 0-4 and you’re like, ‘Oh crap,’” 
Taylor Unroe said.
But behind timely service runs by 
the junior libero and a tightened front-
line defense, the Gators (9-1) came back to win not only the first set, but the next two as well to sweep the Seminoles (6-4)  in three sets  (25-20, 26-24, 25-23).
Coach Mary Wise said the match 
proved to be a much tougher challenge 
than what the box score will show. 
“I think people across the country 
may see 3-0, but that’s not a reflection 
on just what a hard fought match it was,” she said. 
“It was interesting. It was kind of a 
reverse of a year ago.”
In the 2012 matchup between the 
in-state rivals, Wise said her squad did 
not put any pressure on the Seminoles 
from behind the service line or with front-line blocking.
But after seeing UF’s service runs 
force FSU out of its system for much of the match, and an improved defensive effort by Alex Holston and Gabby Mal-lette, Wise said it was those weaknesses from a year ago that transformed into 
strengths for the Gators.
“The serve and the blocking was the 
big difference maker,” she said.
Just three days after what Wise 
called a “mono-focused” offensive 
performance by Mallette, the 6-foot-2 sophomore outside hitter contributed 1.5 blocks, including the final stuff in the third set to close out the match.
Holston added another two blocks, 
while middle blocker Simone Antwi led all players on the court with 3.5 of her own. 
In total, the Gators recorded nine 
stuffs to the Seminoles’ seven.
“They have a lot of combo plays that they run, so for us just to talk about it at the net ... we got more used to it and just started working more on block-ing,” Holston said. “(We were) focus-ing on jumping in and taking risks with our hitters in blocking the ball.”
Wise said the Gators’ aggressive 
serves took the Seminoles out of their element, preventing them from get-ting the ball to their offensive weapons as much as Florida State would have liked. 
“It’s great for our team to play a 
team like this,” Wise said. “... When we came out of the locker room, we had the 
mindset of no messing around, foot on 
the gas pedal, bring you’re ‘A’ game. ... That’s what we did.”

Gators avenge loss, sweep Seminoles UF vs. FSU Through the YearsCHUCK KINGSBURY
Alligator Staff Writer @chuckkingsbury
With Week 2 of the NFL season in the 
books, here are a few former Gators who made 
the most tangible impact for their respective teams. 
Jordan Reed, tight end: The Washington 
Redskins selected Reed in the third round of 
the 2013 NFL Draft despite already having three players at the position. That depth did not stop Reed from showing flashes of athleti-
cism and playmaking ability against the Pack-
ers on Sunday. 
The former Gator took advantage of his 
few opportunities, hauling in three catches on three targets for 18 yards and a touchdown — his first NFL score — that came in the fourth quarter. 
Reed’s statistics were not especially memo-
rable, but he demonstrated an ability to both 
run and pass block —  a criticism against the 
tight end coming out of Florida. After a strong showing from the rookie — particularly in the 
red zone — Reed could earn  more snaps as 
the season progresses. 
Riley Cooper, wide receiver: Cooper has 
proven to be a good fit in Eagles coach Chip Kelly’s up-tempo offense but had only a mod-est showing in the Eagles’ 33-30 loss against the Chargers on Sunday. 
The 6-foot-3, 222-pound wide receiver 
caught two passes for 25 yards and a touch-
down despite being targeted just three times. 
Cooper made an impact on several other 
plays — especially when Kelly dialed up bub-
ble screens outside the formation — serving as a formidable blocker on both the edge and perimeter. 
Although he may not be on the receiv-
ing end of many plays other than a few deep crossing patterns, Cooper can certainly act as a box-clearing decoy for the run game or as an effective interior blocker to spring the likes of DeSean Jackson and other Eagles playmakers in 2013.
Carlos Dunlap, defensive end: Dunlap 
and fellow Cincinnati Bengals defensive end 
Michael Johnson had little trouble pressuring 
opposing quarterbacks in 2012, combining for 17.5 sacks on the season. 
The duo’s success has not changed two 
weeks into this season. 
Dunlap has recorded five tackles and half 
a sack in 2013. Cincinnati ranks seventh in the 
NFL in total defense, surrendering 300.5 yards 
per game. 
Dunlap’s contributions can go largely un-
noticed because he isn’t a box-score hero. But his discipline, sideline-to-sideline speed and ability to rush off the edge stand out on film. 
If the Bengals are going to win the AFC 
North this year, Dunlap, along with their front seven, will need to be sound. 
Notes: 49ers’defensive lineman Ray Mc-
Donald suffered an apparent right leg injury in the fourth quarter versus the Seahawks when an opposing player inadvertently fell onto his leg on the line of scrimmage, accord-ing to KFFL.com. Dolphins’ kicker Caleb Sturgis recorded six 
points on Sunday against the Colts, including a career-long 54-yard field goal — the third-longest made attempt in the NFL in 2013. 
An eight-tackle performance against the 
Minnesota Vikings gives safety Major Wright a total of 17 tackles, good for 22nd in the league. 
Twenty-two former Gators suited up for 
NFL teams during Week 2.

morale.
“On the field, you know, he 
gets worked up,” Harrison said. 
“Say we’re in practice and the 
offense has a couple unsuccessful plays. He gets worked up, gets 
the offense worked up and the 
next thing you know, the person in front of him is doomed, really.
“It gets everybody pumped 
up. It gets everybody going. We 
really need that as a team. His 
leadership is really important.”
Defense aims for perfection:  
On Monday, Dominique Easley made known the tough weekly goal of Florida’s defense, which ranks third nationally with only 208.5 yards allowed per game.
“Our goal is not to let an of-
fense score, period,” Easley said. “So once we manage to get that stat, we could say we have one of the best defenses.”
Easley’s teammates have an-
swered the call and are on board with his philosophy.
“The past few games, we had 
good games on the defensive side of the ball, but we give up a big play here or there,” defensive lineman Damien Jacobs said. 
“So he’s just talking about cor-
recting the little stuff to make us become a great defense.”
Linebacker Neiron Ball added: 
“Like he said, it’s the standard. It’s not really any pressure. It’s just you have to. There’s no ques-tion you have to get to perfec-
tion.”noteS , from page 13

Pamela Begic’s hair is gone.
Not just an inch. Not just a few inches. 
But every blond strand that once hung from her head.
The freshman midﬁ  elder said she had 
wanted to cut her hair for more than a year. She found the opportunity to make it happen during the weekend. 
“I never really had the guts to do it,” 
Begic said. “I thought it was the perfect time to do it, and I just did.”
She said the humidity played a small 
role, as the hot, sticky Florida weather was an obstacle for her when she ﬁ  rst moved 
here from Slovenia.
Begic said she ﬁ  gured making the cut 
meant she could escape some of the heat 
while donating it to those in need.
With soccer dominating the majority of 
the weekend, Begic said it became a team bonding experience.
“Everyone wanted to do a little snip, 
so I just let them,” she said. “We just went 
crazy.” 
Sophomore defender Brooke Smith 
helped Begic style her hair after most of her 
teammates took turns cutting a strand. 
“I have to give credit to Brooke Smith,” 
Begic said. “She perfected it.”
The new hairdo got a great reaction out 
of teammate Savannah Jordan, who did not realize Begic had it cut.
“She shocked me last night,” Jordan 
said. 
“At 12 o’clock, she came to my room, 
[because] I room with her, and she had a towel on her head from the shower. She pulled it off and I was like, ‘Alright; OK.’”Coach Becky Burleigh found it to be a 
bold move.
“I like it,” Burleigh said. “She looks 
good, very brave. Not sure I would have had the courage to do that.”
The courage Begic has goes much deep-
er than her shocking hair cut.
The former Southeastern Conference Freshman of the Week has made huge strides while adjusting to college soccer in the U.S.
Burleigh noted earlier this season that 
the team had struggled both defending and ﬁ  nishing opportunities on set pieces. 
But Begic caught on quickly and led the 
Gators to their ﬁ  rst points off an offensive set piece this season.
It took only four games for Begic to ﬁ  nd 
the back of the net in her ﬁ  rst season with the Gators, scoring on a header from a cor-ner kick in the 54th minute during a 4-0 victory against Florida International on Sept. 1. 
Then, Begic followed it up with another 
goal off a header from a corner kick in the 
9th minute against Oklahoma on Sept. 6.  
Begic has taken nine shots, ﬁ  ve of which 
have been on goal. Her ability to score 
from set pieces is just one advantage the Gators get from their rather large pool of raw, young talent. 
When Alabama steps foot in James G. 
Pressly Stadium on Friday night at 7, it will see a much different team than the 
one it beat 1-0 last season. 
With core newcomers Begic and Jordan, 
along with the added experience of juniors 
Havana Solaun and Annie Speese, the Gators have offensive threats on the ﬁ  eld throughout the roster. 
“I think the non-conference portion of 
the season tells you a lot about all players, and especially the freshmen because it’s 
your ﬁ  rst real look at the them,” Burleigh 
said. 
“But you start the SEC, and that’s a little 
bit of a different animal. It steps the game up a little bit.”
As far as Begic’s new haircut goes, Bur-
leigh believes it could be a blessing in dis-guise.
“She’ll be able to get everywhere on 
time because so much (more) low mainte-nance,” Burleigh said. 
“Maybe she’ll be intimidating to [op-
ponents].”16, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 2013
