Community shaken by earthquake in Haiti
* TWO UF STUDENTS WERE
IN HAITI WHEN THE
EARTHQUAKE TOOK PLACE.
By ELIZABETH BERHMAN,
KATHERINE FINNEY and
KIMBERLY CARPEL
Alligator Writers
UF graduate students Roman
Safiullin and Jon Bougher were
due to return from Haiti Tuesday.
But after an estimated 7.0-mag-
nitude earthquake shook Port-au-
Prince Tuesday, their whereabouts
had yet to be determined Wednes-
day.
"Everybody is trying to fig-
ure out where they might be,"
said profes-International sor Churchill
News Roberts, their
adviser.
Roberts said he spoke with the
families of the two students and no
one has been able to get in contact
with them after Tuesday's disas-
ter.
Safiullin and Bougher were in
Haiti filming a documentary about
an organization building a school
at an orphanage.
The film is part of their thesis
work in The Documentary Insti-
tute at the College of Journalism
and Communications.
The organization, Planting
Peace, was founded by Aaron Jack-
son and John Dieubon.
Roberts said he was able to get
in contact with some friends andcolleagues of Dieubon, and they
told him Dieubon was unhurt dur-
ing the earthquake.
"We think because our two stu-
dents are with this guy that they're
OK too," Roberts said.
Roberts said the students, who
had been in Haiti since Sunday,
were staying five to 10 minutes
away from the airport in Port-au-
Prince.He said he heard the airport Other UF students are also wait-
did not suffer as much damage as
some other structures in the area
and hopes the students were lucky
enough to escape major harm.
"We're all hoping for the best,"
Roberts said. "We are all quite anx-
ious and concerned. We won't rest
until we've heard the definite word
that they're OK,butwe [didn'thear]
any bad news [Wednesday]."ing for news of their families and
loved ones.
Perp6tua Ch6ry, a UF junior,
heard news about the earthquake
Tuesday at 5 p.m. and has been
trying to contact her family since
then.
She learned the condition of her
grandfather in Haiti from a cousin
in France.

People search for survivors under the rubble of a collapsed building Wednesday after an earthquake
struck Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on Tuesday. The 7.0-magnitude earthquake flattened the president's pal-
ace, the cathedral, schools, hospitals, the main prison and whole neighborhoods."This is really frustrating,"
Ch6ry said, "Since we're having
difficulties getting communication
with Haiti."
She was still awaiting news on
the rest of her family Wednesday.
An e-mail sent by UF President
Bernie Machen Wednesday said
two UF faculty members in Haiti,
Florence Sergile and Ed Hanlon,
are safe.
UF organizations and local Red
Cross and Salvation Army chap-
ters are asking students to donate
money.
Del Villasane, an emergency
services intern at The American
Red Cross's chapter in Gainesville,
suggested students make monetary
donations so charities can effective-
ly use the money to meet the food
and medical needs of Haitians.
Steve Dick, development direc-
tor for The Salvation Army of Flor-
ida, agreed with Villasane.
"At this point, because of the
chaotic situation, they are still try-
ing to determine people's needs,"
Dick said. "The most quick and
efficient way is monetary dona-
tions."
Student Body President Jordan
Johnson said he wants students to
know Student Government will
support and assist any students
and student organizations want-
ing to help.
He said the tragedy in Haiti has
personally touched many students'
lives, and he encouraged them to
be there for one another and make

By KATHERINE BEIN
Alligator Staff Writer
A warrant has been issued for the arrest
of former Gators linebacker Dustin Doe
after he failed to complete court-ordered
community service hours.
The warrant was issued Jan. 5, four
days after Doe helped push the Gators tovictory in the Sugar Bowl.
According to court documents, Doe was
found guilty of driving with a suspended
license last August.
Doe was sentenced to 29 hours of com-
munity service and six months of unsuper-
vised probation.
According to Alligator archives, Doe
pled guilty to driving with a suspended li-with a sentence of a year
of unsupervised proba-
tion, a $300 fine and 16
hours of work detail.
The second charge re-
sulted in six months of
Doe unsupervised probation,
another $300 fine and an-
other eight hours of work detail.Doe, who has played for the Gators for
three seasons, was temporarily suspended
from playing with the Gators in July and
from participating in the first game of the
2009 season, according to Alligator ar-
chives.
Doe paid all of his fines but failed to
complete his service hours in the time al-
lotted, according to court documents.

Floridians to get tax holiday for first time in 2 years
* TAX BREAK COULD COST
THE STATE ALMOST $44M.
By CINDY TAVERAS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Two years ago, Gov. Charlie
Crist and state legislators nixed the
back-to-school tax-free holiday be-
cause state revenues were low.
But now, as state revenues areprojected to rise, they are trying to
reenact the 11-day tax break.
According to the latest execu-
tive summary of the Office of Eco-
nomic & Demographic Research,
Florida's revenue is predicted to
be about 6.6 percent more than it
was last year.
But reviving the tax break could
cost the state nearly $44 million.
Fandre Miron, an executive
manager of the Softlines clothing
line for Target on Archer Road,said she looks forward to the tax
holiday.
"I think it's a
great idea, espe-
cially for parents
who have more
than one kid,"
she said.
But not every
Crist store gets to en-
joy the advantag-
es of the back-to-school tax break.
The general manager of TheFlorida Book Store, Nandy Fergu-
son, said college bookstores don't
benefit as much as stores that cater
to high schools, middle schools or
elementary schools.
"It's always a week or two too
late for our students to take advan-
tage of it," she said.
During a press conference Jan.
4, the governor and state legisla-
tures said that they want to restore
the tax break because it will gener-
ate economic growth in the future.However, UF economics pro-
fessor Mark Rush doesn't agree.
Although he hasn't seen the
study yet, he said he thinks only
some of the state revenue loss will
be recouped in the future.
He also thinks the governor
and legislatures could have ulte-
rior motives for restoring the tax
break.
"It's popular with the voters,
which makes it popular with the
politicians," he said.

Professor discusses criminal-identification technology
By MINCH MINCHIN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Scientists will never have spi-
dey senses.
Simon Cole, a professor of
Criminology, Law and Society at
the University of California, Ir-
vine, said new technologies, such
as DNA analysis, offer false hope
that crimes can be stopped before
they happen.
Cole spoke about criminal
identification technologies to an
audience of about 100 at Pugh
Hall Wednesday night.
"People now want to predict
crime with a 'crime gene,"' he
said.
However, he warned the au-
dience that using technology to
catch criminals before they com-
mit a crime is something that only
happens in fiction.
He said movies such as Tom
Cruise's futuristic thriller "Minor-
ity Report," in which police watch
crimes occur before they happen,
help to promote the idea that
crime prevention is possible.
This idea has been around for
nearly as long as crime has been
around, he said.
In the last 10 years, he said,
people have turned to DNA anal-
ysis to find characteristics thatwould indicate whether certain
people are more prone to commit
crimes than others.However, he advised the peo-
ple in the audience not to get their
hopes up about the discovery of acrime gene or any technology that
would identify future criminals.
"It's never worked in the past,"
inamas rIeVIK/ migazor
Simon Cole speaks to an audience at Pugh Hall on Wednesday night about the history of DNA identifica-
tion, fingerprinting and other criminal identification technologies.he said.
At different times in the last
120 years, scientists believed that
eugenics analysis, racial charac-
teristics and fingerprinting would
also help to catch criminals be-
fore they acted, he said. None of
these methods worked to prevent
crime, and many attempts led to
gross civil rights violations, Cole
said.
"I hope I've conveyed a healthy
skepticism," Cole said, adding
that technology is not infallible.
Oscar Molina, a sophomore
psychology and criminology ma-
jor, said he was impressed with
the lecture.
"What I learned was that the
field of criminal identification is
evolving," Molina said. "We had
fingerprints at one time. Now we
have DNA. What will we have in
the future?"
The Center for the Humanities
and the Public Sphere sponsored
the lecture. It was the first speech
of the Caleb and Michele Grimes
Conference on Liberal Arts and
Public Affairs.
Bonnie Effros, director of the
Center of the Humanities and the
Public Sphere at UF, said four
more lectures about criminal iden-
tification will be given in coming
months.

Robberies inspire crackdown
By DANIELA ABRATT
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Gainesville Police Department is revamp-
ing its security measures in the wake of two home
invasion robberies.
GPD is set to release a full report, including
plans and statistics, next week.
"We have two overarching goals: Reduce
crime and improve customer service," said GPD
Capt. Ed Book.
The new initiatives came in response to several
factors, including increased crime levels last year,
Police Chief Tony Jones' installation and recent
arrests within the police department.
The reorganization began Jan. 4, the same day
Stacey Brown, 20, of Gainesville, was shot and
killed in a home invasion robbery.
Just a few weeks earlier on Dec. 22, Meng Mu
Shin, a 36-year-old UF doctoral student, was shot
twice in a similar robbery.
Due to a high correlation between drug use
and sales and home invasion robberies, Book said
GPD is reaching out to apartment managers in or-
der to identify potential drug dealers.
Last fall, GPD placed an additional 30 officerson the street. Now, officials are debating how
many of those should return to their previous ad-
ministrative positions.
"We have two overarching goals:
reduce crime and improve customer
service."
Ed Book
GPD Captain
GPD is using information and recommenda-
tions from the National Organization of Black
Law Enforcement Executives alongside its own
internal committees to create these proposals.
The Alachua County Sheriff's Office said it
is not making any significant changes to its task
force.
"We haven't had a recent surge in crime like
the city of Gainesville has had," Sheriff Sadie
Darnell said. "I'm very satisfied with our level of
work."
University Police Lt. Robert Wagner said
changes will have no effect on UF's policies.
"The numbers are what they are," Book said.
"We need to be an effective, ethical organization,
and we need to be accountable."Gainesville residents
to root for Arbor Day
By ROXANNE FRASER
Alligator Contributing Writer
On Thanksgiving, people unite
to give thanks.
On New Year's, people unite to
set resolutions.
But on Arbor Day, it's a little
different.
"We plant a tree," said city ar-
borist Meg Niederhofer.
Today at 11:45 a.m., another
tree will be planted to celebrate
Arbor Day at the Kirby-Smith
Center, 620 E University Ave.
The 13-foot live oak is the last
of 52 trees to be planted in honor
of Gainesville's 26 years as the Ar-
bor Day Foundation's Tree City
USA.Niederhofer said the city of
Gainesville plants about 1,000
trees a year, two for each one it
removes.
Attendees can count on taking
part in the planting.

Around ally, everyoneGainesville picks up a gold-
en shovel and

Anita Spring, chairwoman of
the City Beautification Board, said
the tradition unites the commu-
nity.
"If everyone picks up a golden
shovel and everybody puts a shov-
elful of dirt around the tree, it sort
of feels like their tree," she said.

Keep the change
Crist's tax holiday
too little, too late
7Fe Editorial Board would like to respectfully tell Charlie
Crist he can keep his tax-free holiday.
Just like we can see through his spray tan to the pasty
white guy underneath, we noticed he chose an election year -
the year he happens to be vying for a U.S. Senate seat -to be-
stow this generous gift upon his adoring constituency.
OK, we admit that those 11 days of saving 7 percent feel nice
and can really help out parents shopping for school supplies for
their kids.
Someone spending $500 on new clothes, shoes, etc., for a few
children could save about $50. But the point is, the holiday nev-
er should have been taken away, punishing Florida residents
for state budget cuts over which they have no control.
We know, we know: Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.
But this gift horse has creepy, chemically whitened teeth, and
we don't want him to think our votes can be bought for 7 cents
on the dollar.
And while we can't promise we won't buy anything that
week next fall, you won't see us maxing out our credit cards at
Banana Republic while Crist rides his greasy slide to the U.S.
Senate.
From the sports deskIt's the beginning of the
semester, which means
spending an inordinate
amount of time consulting
ISIS, deciphering syllabi and
griping about Rec Sports' in-
tramural department.
There has to be a mind on
this campus brilliant enough
to make the proper changes
to the repetitive captains'
meetings and brutal signup
system.
The meetings are a bit
of a necessary evil, but they
frequently run as long as 45
minutes and contain the same
information for every sport.
If you decide to be a captain
for three sports that semester,
you're committing over two
hours to browsing the Web on
your BlackBerry while tuning
out the difference between a
default and a forfeit.
Rec Sports' biggest crime
against the intramural world
came Tuesday night, when
they scheduled the basketball
captain's meeting on the same
night as the Kentucky game in
the O'Connell Center. Just the
biggest basketball game of the
year, that's all.
When we called, hours in
advance, to explain that our
entire team was going to be at
the game and unable to attend
that same meeting we've beento 100 times, the Rec Sports
guy explained that the game
was starting at 9, and the
meeting at 7, leaving plenty of
time to get there.
Obviously, he's never been
to a Kentucky game.
Despite our best attempts
at logic, it was made clear
-no meeting, no signup.
Thanks, guys.
After figuring out how to
get a teammate to the meet-
ing, we thought of a hypo-
thetical signup strategy.
For registration the next
day, everyone who shows up
by 7:30 a.m. at Southwest gets
a number, and the start of the
line is pulled out of a hat to
ensure no one camps out for
a better spot.
Now tell us, what would
be the difference with that and
opening registration online at
7:30 a.m. instead? Besides the
freezing cold weather, lost
hours of sleep and a few un-
comfortable RTS bus rides, of
course.
Don't get us wrong, we're
grateful to be able to play in-
tramurals every semester, but
we wish we hadn't spent a
fourth of our college experi-
ence in the Reitz Union's Rion
Ballroom listening to the same
speech about proper athletic
wear.

Jersey Shore': The new Roman Empire?
uch has been made of the fall of the RomanEmpire in the media over the last few years,
especially as our own American empire has
come under deservedly intense scrutiny.
Television watchers who have witnessed the revela-
tions on MTV's "Jersey Shore" with a keen eye toward
history will clearly see that the fall of the Roman Empire
was due to an acute shortage of hair gel.

depicted in "Jersey Shore" are leading us all into a brave
new world constructed atop the rubble of old Rome.
According to venerated Roman custom, those giving
false witness shall be subjected to capital punishment.
These latter-day Roman thinkers seem to have a tenu-
ous grip on the finer points of Western common law,
but the spirit of the ancient Romans and the eternal val-
ue of truth are reinforced with every sloppy drunken
haymaker.
Italians proud of their unique representation of cul-
tural heritage, our Jersey Shore denizens were made for
the digital age -they are like crack cocaine for cable TV
and the Internet.
Blown-out hair gelled with half a bottle of industri-
al-grade coagulants and skin shining like a new penny,
these Roman gladiators do battle against their natural
physical state instead of a foreign enemy. Like any com-
pelling accident, we are powerless to stop them from
attracting our attention.
Harkening back into ancient history and murky pan-
Mediterranean lore, the braying and feisty Snooki brings
immediately to mind the grand mythos surrounding
Helen of Troy. Snooki has the face that launched a thou-sand fists. Her eminently punch-
able mug may be the source of
inspiration for centuries to come,
provided we still cherish chunky,
orange-colored girls who know
their way around a big pan of ziti.

DJ Pauly D, whose own spectacular hair far outshines

can show you how to be a better person in as little as 25
minutes, provided you lack a soul and love the feeling
of hairspray coating your lungs.
While Romans of lore virtually taught the Western
world how to think, those at the apex of the new Roman
Empire prefer the deep thoughts of Ed Hardy. A phi-
losopher fit for our times, Hardy reminds us all that the
human heart is as fragile as our standing on this mortal
coil. Tune in tonight and witness the rise of the new Ro-
man Empire, and wonder along with me to the eternal
question of our age -does Ed Hardy make a toga?

Torture never justified in war
here are a good number of people whobelieve in the hypothetical situation
that torture is justified in the ticking
time bomb scenario. That is, a nuclear or bio-
logical weapon is about to detonate and kill
thousands, maybe millions of people.
This is presented as a no-brainer -sacri-
fice one to save thousands. What's not as ob-
vious to the casual observer is that this is little
more than a fairytale used to justify the aban-
donment of American principles and morals.
Let's look at what would be needed to make
this scenario plausible. First, we have to capture
a terrorist with all the pertinent information.
Second, the capture has to happen in that nar-
row window of opportunity before the attack
occurs. Third, we need to know about the plot
and know this terrorist, this person, has the in-
formation we need. Fourth, we need to know
enough about the plot to anticipate and identify
those responsible, but for some strange reason,
we are missing several key details that we can
only obtain by torturing this person.
For those who still think this scenario is a
possibility or even probability, let us look to
our own experience with terrorism. If we had
caught one of the Sept. 11 hijackers just prior to
the attacks, should we have tortured him to get
him to give up information? If you support the
ticking time bomb scenario, you would. I might
not believe in torture, but there is a very power-
ful part of me that still wants those men to suf-
fer as much as possible and for us to do what
ever we can to prevent that attack.
The only problem is we did catch one of the
hijackers- Zacarias Moussaoui. The FBI fieldNick Miner supervisor in Minne-
Speaking Out apolis went as far in his
warning as to say that
he was "trying to keep
someone from taking a plane and crashing into
the World Trade Center." Moussaoui was re-
leased because there wasn't sufficient evidence.
This is the ticking time bomb scenario. We
knew al-Qaida was planning something and we
arrested a terrorist with the pertinent informa-
tion. Yet we didn't know it. Hindsight is 20/20,
and in the covert underworld of black ops and
terrorism, nothing is known for certain. Our in-
telligence agencies are not omniscient.
We can't operate from the position that we
can kill, torture and imprison the world's ter-
rorists. Torture is designed to win battles, not
wars. Think of the past great powers that relied
heavily on torture to wage war: The Nazis, the
Soviets, the Japanese, the French in Algeria,
America in Vietnam. How did those wars go?
The blowback effects of torture were
summed up perfectly by journalist Mark Dan-
ner. In November 2003, he asked a young Iraqi
from Falluja about the rising resistance to the
U.S. presence. The Iraqi said: "It is a shame for
the foreigners to put a bag over their heads, to
make a man lie on the ground.This is a great
shame for the whole tribe. It is the duty of that
man, and of that tribe, to get revenge on this
soldier. Their duty is to attack them, to wash
the shame. The shame is a stain, a dirty thing
-they have to wash it. No sleep -we cannot
sleep until we have revenge. They have to kill
soldiers."

"Every little bit counts," John-
son said. "This certainly is a major
tragedy."
Aleks Bacewicz, president of
the Global Haiti Initiative at UF,
believes it is important to raise
awareness of Haitian issues, espe-
cially now that the current crisis is
brought to the forefront.
Jose St. Louis, a UF sophomore
who has family living in Haiti, was
immediately affected by the earth-
quake.Because communications sys-
tems are down, there is no way of
ensuring their safety.
"With Port-au-Prince being the
most populous city and the death
toll estimated in the hundreds of
thousands, it's inevitable that my
family would know some of the
people who have been affected,"
St. Louis said. "This has really
made me sit back and be thankful
for what I've got because I real-
ize how many small things fell in
place in order for me to be here
right now."

Haiti has recently suffered many
other natural disasters, including
Hurricane Hannah and Tropical
Storm Ike, both in Septemember
2008. It is the poorest country in
the Western Hemisphere.

Matt Kurz One sings, plays all for show at The Atlantic
By JON SILMAN
avenue writer
Matt Kurz is a busy man. He's the lead sing-
er of the Matt Kurz One. And also the bassist,
guitarist and keyboardist. Kurz sings scratchy,
intense punk funk songs with a fiery slant remi-
niscent of The Who and James Brown.
He'll be playing at The Atlantic on Saturday at
10 p.m. Tickets are $6.
Wouldn't it just be easier to be in a band
and not have to do everything?
Bands can be a real drag. I was in a couple
bands that did really well, but right at the pay-
off period they disbanded for what I found to
be really, really dumb reasons-considering the
amount of work we had put in to getto that point.
I've always been interested in being a one-man
band, and since I turned 17 I've been in nine or
10 incarnations of what I am today.
How did you get started?
I lived in Richmond, Va., for a year, and that
year was pretty sad and amazing at the same
time. I didn't know anyone or have any friends,
so I pretty much just locked myself in the attic
of the house I was living in, and that's where Itaught myself to play the bass with my foot and
stuff like that.
Didyou have an epiphanymomentwhenyou
figured out you could tape drumsticks to the
head of your guitar and play the keyboard?
Pretty much everything I figured out how to
do was complete, stupid coincidence. First, I
started bashing the headstock of the guitar on
a keyboard set to drum noises -- that's how I
played the cymbal. I figured out I could bash a
high hat instead, but I started chipping my guitar,
so I taped a drumstick to it. Eight months later it
occurred to me, 'Hey dummy, you can play notes
instead of cymbal noises (on the keyboard)!"
What about playing the bass with your
foot?
I was playing guitar one day, and I laid the
bass down precariously on the floor in front of
me. I happened to look down, and the bass was
just where it is when I play it now (at shows). I
was like, "No way," and I just started hitting my
foot on it and it worked.
And the sock, necessary or not?
You just don't want blisters and calluses on
the underside of your big toe, and it also keeps
my foot warm. There are so many good reasons
for the sock.Is there a reason you don't use effects ped-
als or pre-recorded tracks when you play live?
To me that kinda feels like cheating. If I fell
back on those things I might not have ever
achieved my goal of being a full one-man band
that I set for myself when I was 14. Also, I'm one
of those people that if I touch small electronics,
they explode and freak out.
What do you say to people who automati-
cally assume you're doing some kind of gim-
mick?
That kinda stuff drives me. If there weren't as
many naysayers I'd probably be a lot less active. I
love that it's a fight. I love turningthe crowd.
Is this your life's work? Is there a legacy you
want to leave behind?
Life's work is not a bad way to describe what
I'm doing. I'm barely getting by on this thing, but
it's worth it to me. When I'm eating Ramen noo-
dles and worrying about my dishwashing job at
home, the kinda solace I give myself is that, like,
14-year-old Matt Kurz would be stoked about
what I'm up to right now. The idea was never to
make a million dollars or sell out stadiums. The
idea was, 'I'm going to be able to do that one
day.' And I am able to do that, so as far as that's
concerned, I am satiated.

avenue writer
Gainesville, it's time to groove. Groovaloo, a
28-member dance company known for throwing
caution and choreography to the wind, is perform-
ing tomorrow night at the Phillips Center for the
Performing Arts.
The company head-spun its way into America's
hearts after jaw-dropping performances on NBC's
"Superstars of Dance," as well as on the live finale
of this season of "So You Think You Can Dance."
But when you catch a performance by the
Groovaloos, expect the unexpected. Traditional
choreography is considered a foreign concept,
and the dancers aren't afraid to test the laws of
gravity.
Based out of Los Angeles and founded in 1999,
the Groovaloos have created an artistry that sets
powerful beats to the personal stories of the per-
formers. The shows are themed around trust and
courage, as the performances are directly based
on the struggles and triumphs the dancers have
experienced.
"The best way to describe our show is visually
stunning," said Bradley "Shooz" Rapier, the found-
er of the Groovaloos. "We break the stereotype of
what people think hip-hop is."
Rapier's own entrance into the hip-hop world
was unexpected. Growing up in Canada, he was
the only African-American in his school and was
never really introduced to the concept of formu-
laic dancing. Rapier finally discovered a passion
and skill for movement in 11th grade at his high
school dance when he was invited to join a street
dance group.
Originally on a career path to becoming a doc-
tor, Rapier decided to move to Los Angeles and
find dancers who shared the same fire for move-
ment. After holding 'weekly jams' at his house and
bonding with fellow dancers, the Groovaloos were
born.
"I formed the Groovaloos so I could be sur-
rounded by dance at all times," Rapier said. "Iwanted to create not only a dance community but
also a dance family."
In 1999, the Groovaloos found success after
winning first place at the American Street Dance
Championship and have since found national
fame.
The group is now touring nationally in order
to share its street dance culture. The group's
performances use voice-overs to share the per-
sonal experiences of the dancers and integrates
words with a unique form of movement. When the
Groovaloos perform, you hear what you see.
"It's a true story of our group and how we jour-
ney individually," Rapier said. "The spoken word
of our show explains what you're seeing. It might
K-
00ri@® 9be funny, touching or traumatic, but you see our
experiences lived out on stage."
In every movement or action, the Groovaloos
use a mantra to help explain their inspiration to
the audience: "Life isn't always choreographed.
sometimes you have to freestyle."
"We use this as a metaphor for life," Rapier
said. "You don't always know what is ahead of you,
but you have to keep going and find a purpose.
That's what we try and share with the audience."
The Groovaloos will spin into the Phillips Cen-
ter Friday at 7:30 p.m. Tickets can be purchased
at the Phillips Center Box Office or any Ticketmas-
ter location. Student tickets can be purchased for
$10.50.
Hats off!
Did you know about 10
percent of total body heat
is lost through your head?
That's why, for this particu-
larly cold winter, hats are a
necessity. But instead of
that ragged old beanie your
grandma knitted for you, go
for something more fashion
forward.
Left, senior Meredith Worley
models four of the hundreds
of styles of hats that will
keep your head warm and
your outfit stylish.
Top off your ensemble with
a chic chapeau as an acces-
soryor simply a solution for
an oh-so-bad hair day.
You can find these hats
everywhere in stores like
Goodwill, Urban Threads or
Macy's.THURSDAY, JANUARY 14A, 2010*4ALLIGATOR, 11

Alligator Statf
Winter ale tingles taste buds
By RICHARD 0. STEHLI
avenue writer
Like many micro breweries, Sierra Nevada releases
four seasonal beers every year. Its offeringfor the win-
ter is Celebration Ale, a perfect pairing with the chilly
weather.
As far as winter beers go, you might be surprised to
learn that Celebration Ale is an India Pale Ale, a style
associated with hotweather. Sierra Nevada sticks with
its standard Cascade hops, which give the beer its dis-
tinctive fresh, citrusy aroma and bitter taste. Beneaththe blast of hoppy bitterness, however, the beer has
a rich, mellow undercurrent, enhanced by the subtle
spiciness of hops that really hits home for your cold-
weather cravings.
The strong taste of pale ales can force you to take
your beer one sip at a time, so sip slowly. Less is more
in the world of pale ales, and one Sierra Nevada will
satisfy your hunger in ways that a whole case of bland,
tasteless light lager never will.
Celebration Ale is available in grocery stores and
bottle shops in Gainesville, but hurry! Once a seasonal
sells out, it won't be back until next year.Chris Brown deserves
a second chance
By MICHELLE PROFITS
avenue writer
We're all familiar with the clas-
sic celebrity catastrophe: Celeb is
clean-cut. Celeb makes fatal mis-
take. Celeb apologizes. But what
comes after that is a bit hazy. As
the adoringfans, we either hold our
grudges until the celeb morphs into
a has-been, or we forgive and for-
get. I'm here today to make a case
for a current crossroads the public
has arrived at: Either forgive Chris
Brown or condemn him to Pop Cul-
ture Hell.
As a female with strong femi-
nist inclinations, I am not condon-
ing what he did or forgetting the
mistakes he made. I'm only offer-
ing reasons to give him a second
chance.
Let's first look at his music.
Not only was he just 16 when he
became the first male solo artist
to release a single ("Run It") that
shot straight to the top of the Bill-
board chart, but Brown was never
one to sing about topics such as
sex or drugs, like some of his con-
temporaries. Rather, his music has
always been.well, pretty clean.
One of his major hits "Forever" is
about -gasp- dancing! And not even
the booty-dropping, all-up-on-you,
let's-make-this-as-dirty-as-possible
kind. The lyrics speak for them-
selves: "Feel the melody and the
rhythm of the music around you."As far as I'm concerned, that could
be a line straight out of a song per-
formed by Big Bird.
And now, he is imploring us to try
and find space in our hearts for him
once more. In fact, he's groveling.
No, really. His latest single is called
"Crawl," and it's basically one giant
apology put to a catchy beat and
performed with soaring vocals. His
opening lyrics:"Everybody sees it's
you, but I'm the one who lost the
view." That says to me that he is
acknowledging his mistakes. He's
saying that he will crawl right up to
whoever needs him to and begfor a
second chance. I am by no means
validating what he did and strongly
believe that domestic violence is
inexcusable. However, as a profes-
sional, Brown's career continues to
thrive. He currently occupies num-
bers 35, 78 and 173 on the iTunes
Top 100 with "I Can Transform Ya,"
"Crawl," and "Forever," respective-
ly. Clearly, I'm not the only one out
there still listening to his music.
So here we are at this cross-
roads again. To keep listening or to
turn that radio dial off. I've shared
my reasoning behind my choice,
but now the decision is yours.
Editor's note: The Alligator does
not support domestic violence. If
you or a loved one is a victim of do-
mestic violence, contact Alachua

Crisis Center at 866-252-5439.
Leave the Gaga clothes at home for Career Showcase
By ASCHELLE MORGAN
avenue contributing writer
Sloth off the sweatpants and
break out the lint roller: Ladies
and Gentlemen, the Career Show-
case has arrived. Although I'd love
to tell you your replete resume and
perfected Gator chomp will have
any employer banging down yourdoor, the reality is you have about
six seconds to impress. To help you
out, here's how to make a rockstar
first impression:
For the ladies.
DO leave the statement outfits
to Lady Gaga. I'm sure you look fab
in your platform pumps, but now is
the time to get back to the basics.
Think a professional black, navy
or gray suit and closed-toe shoes.Although a crisp button-down is al-
ways a safe go-to, spice it up with a
colored silk blouse. If you are con-
tacting a work placeFashion with a more casual
%m m vibe, replace the suit
jacket with a cardi-
gan and top it off with a cinched
skinny belt.
DON'T overdo the jewelry, make-
up and hair styling. Less is morein the professional world. Stud tuxedo, so go gray or navy. Pair it
earrings, neutral tones and sleek
pulled back hair are the perfect
complement to any professional
outfit. After all, you want them to
focus on your skills, not wonder if
you're wearing a Bumpit.
For the gents.
DO take a hint from "Entou-
rage's" Ari Gold and opt for a well-
fitted suit. Black can look like awith a pressed button-down and a
coordinating small print tie.
DON'T ruin your suave suited
look with athletic socks. Opt for
darker colors that complementyour
suit rather than distract from it.
The career showcase is Tuesday
and Wednesday in the O'Connell
Center. For more information, visit
crc.ufl.edu.
Secret screwing is a necessary evil in the
By JARED MISNER and AMELIA HARNISH
avenue writers
She says.
As a girl who has found herself in the posi-
tion of the cheater, the cheated on and the no-
torious "other girl," I have an educated opinion
on adulterous activities.
Cue the Pat Benatar.
Yes, being cheated on blows. From what I
haven't blocked out, I remember it as one of the
most painful things I've ever experienced. But,
as they say, what goes around comes around -- I
ended up getting retribution by cheating on him
three different times.
Although cheating back probably wasn't the
most humane way to handle a breakup, it got
the job done. The result was realizing that as
much as we thought we wanted to be together,we just weren't right for each other, which led
to outside "interests" amid attempting to keep
us alive.
I'm sure there are some of you thinking, "I
would never cheat." But trust me, unless you're
all-knowing and all-seeing or you're one of those
weirdos who are sober all the time, chances are
that one day you'll be bored enough to do some-
thing cruel yet delicious, like getting humped in
a hammock at that party your boyfriend was too
tired to attend.
Cheating is one of those things that happens
to almost everyone in some capacity. Some of
us are lucky enough to meet and marry our
soul mates early on, escaping the world of dat-
ing and singledom unscathed. But most of us,
me included, have a harder road ahead, one
full of bad decisions and broken hearts for all
involved.
In the dating game, cheating, like war, issometimes a necessary evil.
He says.
Carrie Underwood could probably kick my
ass. Thankfully, I don'tthink she'll ever be forced
to carve her name in my leather seats.
But I can't promise I haven't slow danced
with someone else's bleached-blond tramp be-
fore we got frisky.
Thankfully, I've never been on the receiving
end of Ms. Underwood's, nor any other base-
ball-bat-wielding spouse's temper, when he or
she found out I was "the other girl."
Mainly because no one except a certain
bleached-blond tramp and I knew about how we
got frisky. But I'm really not sorry.
And all of you who have the chance to score
with someone as hot as I did should feel proud
rather than guilty. Sure, you might have just
thrown any hopes of monogamy out the window
with a teeth-gnawing tear of a condom wrapperdating game
and a liquor-laced evening, but Pat Benatar said
it right: "Love is a battlefield."
A dirty, bedsheet-sticking kind of war where
friends spend more time taking the knives out
of their backs than worrying about the rules of
war.
It's not every day you get seduced by a pair
of icy blue eyes forcingyou into bed with the hot-
test thing you've seen this decade.
And you wanted to decline the ever-so-gra-
cious invite to one sinful evening all because of
a few monogamous mechanics?
When our world of love and sex is a constant
game of finders keepers, relationships often be-
come more centered around finding than keep-
ing. Bedrooms become a a battle where lovers
are in a constant search for the antidote to mo-
nogamy. And that's just the way it is.
So, the next time you cheat, I can only hope
it's with me.

Gators prepare for Summitt, No. 4 UT
* THE VOLUNTEERS ARE 38-3 ALL-TIME
AGAINST THE GATORS.

The rumblings of the thunderous locomotive you will
hear tonight belong to Tennessee and its women's basket-
ball program.
Coach Pat Summitt, the NCAA's all-time leader with
1,019, is the architect and conductor that has been driving
the program since 1974 and is rolling into Gainesville to
pit her No. 4 Volunteers (14-1, 2-0 Southeastern Confer-
ence) against the Gators (9-7, 2-1 SEC) at 7 tonight in the
O'Connell Center.
It may be just another SEC game, but even the Gators
can't ignore the heightened media attention that follows
Tennessee.
T"Because it's Tennessee, it motivates us a lot more,"
senior Sharielle Smith said. "It gets us basically in the
mindset of 'OK, this is Tennessee. We've gotta step up our
game.' Our intensity has to be there the entire game for us
to succeed."
Last season, UF pulled off a 66-57 upset over the Vol-
unteers in Gainesville, but Tennessee has dominated the
all-time series 38-3.
"They're super talented," UF coach Amanda Butler
said. "They've got the best coach in the history of ever.
Are they the standard by which we all measure ourselves?
Absolutely."
Coming off a sub-par year, where they exited the
NCAA tournament in the first round, the Volunteers have
a sophomore-dominated team, led by preseason All-SEC
First Teamers Angie Bjorklund -averaging 16.5 points
per game and draining 49 percent of her three-pointers -
and Shekinna Stricklen, who is second on the team with 14
points per game to go with her 6.6 rebounds per contest.
Sophomore Glory Johnson compliments them with 12.7
.4 points per game and 8.0 boards a game.
With a lineup that features every starter at least six
Harrison Diamond/ Alligator Staff feet, Tennessee poses an immediate size problem for the
Tennessee women's basketball coach Pat Summitt watches the ac- smaller Gators, whose only such starter is center Azania
tion from the bench during the UF-Tennessee game in the O'Connell
Center on Feb. 8, 2009. SEE W-HOOPS, PAGE 19
UF looks to improve performance on bars
Event was team's worst in opener
By TOM GREEN
Alligator Writer
Struggles on the uneven bars cost the
Gators their season opener against Okla-
homa in Norman, but the team is not
dwelling on last week's results.
Despite a total score of 48.175 on the
bars -by far the team's lowest-scoring
event of the meet -Florida feels confi-
dent moving forward with the season.
The biggest issue the team had on the
bars, which was their first event of the
meet, was with handstands, an area theyhave been working on this week.
"We didn't hit any of our handstands
and had two falls," UF coach Rhonda
Faehn said. "If you're going up against
a top-10 team on the
road, you can't expect
to win like that."
Gy m The Gators strug-Gymnastics gled getting completely
vertical on handstands,
and that's one of the biggest things the
judges look for on the bars.
"It's not that hard, but you have to re-
ally be focused on it," Faehn said.Faehn said the team wasn't as aggres-
sive as they should've been in warm-ups.
That lack of aggressiveness may have
been the key factor in the team's rough
performance to open the season.
"We were just holding back a little bit,"
said senior Amanda Castillo, who scored
a team-high 9.8 on the bars. "But we're
very talented and have a lot of room to
grow.
With 13 of the team's 24 routines being
performed by newcomers, it's no surprise
UF has room to improve.
One of those newcomers, freshman Liz
Green, led off for the Gators on the bars,

POLL QUESTION
U Who's to blame for Lane Kiffin leaving
Tennessee for USC?Don't blame
Kiffin; blame
the rules
Lane Kiffin left Tennessee high
and dry.
He rumbled into town 14
months ago looking like the man
for the job of returning the Vols to
national prominence.
He was young and brash, a to-
tal change of pace from former UT
coach Phil Fulmer.
He put together an all-star staff
and hit the recruiting trail hard,
and most Southeastern Confer-
ence fans ex-
pected to see
Tennessee
back in the4> title race in
the coming
Mike McCall seasons.
McCallin' It Then, al-
Like I See It most out of
mmccall@alligator org nowhere,
he skipped
town for USC, leaving an angry
mob of students behind.
He bailed on all those players
he brought in and made promises
to, he bailed on the season ticket
holders and he bailed on the pro-
gram at a very vulnerable time.
Good for him.
Kiffin didn't do anything espe-
cially slimy, sleazy or scuzzy. He
did what plenty of other coaches
have done and will continue to do
in the future.
His dream job came open, he
wanted to take it, and he did.
Don't like it?
Change the rules.
Coaches are being paid outra-
geous sums of money to bring in
talented teenagers, who do the
majority of the work for no pay
and less glory than the coach ulti-
mately receives.
Then, the coach can up sticks
and hit the road without warning,
and the environment those play-
ers signed up for is gone.
Don't get me wrong. Coaches
are important, and a great one
will bring a lot of wins and mon-

ey to his program, but something has to
change.
Maybe a portion of a coach's buyout
clause could go to the players he leaves
behind.
Or force coaches to make an announce-
ment that they're open to taking another
job at least one calendar year before they
sign with another program. Any coach
who breaks this rule gets hit with a multi-
million-dollar fine.
It's a tough situation to fix, but it's not
fair to the players.
In this case though, I think the move
is good for the Tennessee program in the
long run.
In his FanHouse column on Tuesday
night, Clay Travis -who wrote a book
about the Vols' 2008 season -detailed
how Kiffin had ruffled some players'
feathers by abandoning Tennessee's tra-
ditions.
Citing senior center Josh McNeil, Tra-
vis wrote about how Kiffin frequently
showed the team highlights of USC play-
ers rather than Vols legends, didn't want
to take part in the custom of reciting Gen-
eral Neyland's maxims before games,
brought in the Trojans' chants and at one
point said, "Well, whatever Tennessee's
been doing isn't working anymore, so
we're coming up with something new.
Get used to it."
After a lifetime of living in the South, I
feel it's safe to say Tennesseans wouldn't
take too kindly to a fast-talking city-slicker
from California doing that sort of thing.
The UT program is a proud one, which
makes Kiffin's jump to a bigger pond all
the more maddening, but the Vols de-
serve and need a coach who will embrace
them and their traditions.
In the short term, of course, this is ter-
rible for Tennessee. A hire has to be made
fast to avoid a signing day disaster, and
there aren't a ton of good candidates out
there. Depending on who's hired, this sets
the program back a few years.
Kiffin robbed the cupboard of bigtime
assistant Ed Orgeron and his father, de-
fensive mastermind Monte Kiffin, leaving
the Vols in shambles and giving USC a
quick rebound after Pete Carroll's depar-
ture.
There's not much of a downside for
the Trojans, unless Alligator photogra-
pher Harrison Diamond's prediction that
Monte will "die of dysentery on the wag-
on ride to California" comes true.Vols' height causes matchup issues for Gators

Stewart.
Unable to match the Volunteers' size,
Florida will have to play its best for 40
minutes, relying on keeping the ball and
getting Tennessee out of sync offensively
in an effort to score transition points.
The Gators come in averaging more
steals per game (9.9) than their oppo-
nents and will have to play tough de-
fense to slow a team that averages 79.6points.
Turnovers have been a hindrance for
the team all season. UF
averages 19.4 per game
-nearly six more than
Tennessee-andhad 16
Women's in the first half against
Bask aI Georgia on Sunday.laSfleLaI "That can't be an is-
sue this game because
the majority of the time when we turn
the ball over, that's extra points for them
-it's like we're spotting them points,"Smith said. "With Tennessee, you can't
afford to have those."
For a team that outscores its oppo-
nents by an average of 22 points, the Vol-
unteers won't need any extra help from
the Gators to gain a big lead.
Otherwise, UF will be notch No. 1,020
in Summitt's belt.
"For us as a team that's trying to get
to the top, there's only one way to get
there," Butler said. "You've got to go
through people like that, you can't go
around them."
Florida needs to work on handstands for better scores

scoring a 9.675 to try to set the tone for the
team, but admitted she was nervous going
into her first collegiate meet. That's a feel-
ing junior Alicia Goodwin said the team
needs to overcome.
"Don't be timid, just go aggressive,"
Goodwin said. "We're not looking back;
we're just looking forward and focusing a
lot on handstands and little details."
Although the team struggled in its first
event, Faehn said she was proud of how
her team rebounded and tried to dig itself
out of the early hole and to regain momen-
tum as the meet progressed.

UF senior Amanda Castillo scored a team-high 9.8 on the uneven bars against
Oklahoma. The Gators are working to improve their bar routines."The season is long, and it's a
matter of making sure that each
competition we're growing and
getting more confident."
Rhonda Faehn
UF gymnastics coach
Faehn is confident the team's early is-
sues will get worked out as the season
continues and said her team will get to
where it needs to be through more num-
bers in practice and more repetitions in a
competitive setting.
The Gators have been honing their
handstands, as well as their dismounts,
in preparation for the next meet Friday
against Arkansas, the team's home open-
er.
The most important thing, according to
Faehn, is to use the Oklahoma meet as a
stepping stone and to focus on correcting
all the minor details they made mistakes
on.
"The season is long, and it's a matter of
making sure that each competition we're
growing and getting more confident,"
Faehn said. "It just takes a little while for
them to get comfortable, and confident
and cohesive as a group."( ) r I in I 'N f I f 0 ( 4 11)
