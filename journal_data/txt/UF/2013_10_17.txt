An Alachua County Jail inmate was found 
trying to hang himself with a bedsheet in his 
cell Tuesday, making it the second time in about two weeks a jail inmate has tried to commit suicide.
Ofﬁ  cials found Miguel A. Hernandez, 20, 
hanging unconscious in his cell during a rou-tine check, said ASO spokesman Art Forgey. Staffers cut him down, and he was taken to UF Health Shands Hospital, where he re-mained in critical condition as of press time.
Hernandez had been in jail with no bond 
since Sunday afternoon on an Illinois war-rant for failing to register as a sex offender, Forgey said.
The other attempted suicide occurred 
Sept. 28 when ofﬁ  cials found Austin Dionne, 22, in his cell, hanging from a bedsheet as well. Dionne was in jail on a $1 million bond after an investigation alleged he shook a 3-week-old child several times Sept. 19 when he got upset while playing Xbox.Dionne was released on 
his own recognizance Oct. 8 and passed away soon after, Forgey said. Forgey  said he was unsure of the cause of death.
So far this year, 15 Ala-
chua County inmates at-tempted suicide, which is seven more attempts than 
in 2012, according to jail records.
Forgey said he’s not sure why there’s been an increase. However, deputies have noticed a rise in the number of people being Baker Acted. The act allows law enforcement to place a person involuntarily into a mental health facility.
“Jail puts added stress on a person,” 
Forgey said, “but we’ve seen it out on the road, too.”
Dionne didn’t show any mental-health 
red ﬂ  ags, Forgey said, but Hernandez did. He was placed under close observation in

The Alachua County Health 
Department recently an-
nounced the year’s ﬁ  rst case of locally acquired West Nile virus has been conﬁ  rmed in a 64-year-old man.
Paul Myers, administrator 
for the health department, said he couldn’t disclose the man’s exact condition, but he said it is a serious case of the virus.
“We certainly hope that no 
more human cases show up,” he said. “However, the threat is still out there.”
Mosquitoes commonly 
transmit the virus to humans, according to  the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-tion website.
Symptoms include head-
aches, fever, altered mental states and confusion. Children and the elderly are more at risk for developing the virus.
Vaccines for the virus aren’t 
available, but over-the-counter painkillers can be used to sup-Year’s first local

A new sign hangs in the store-
front window at 1023 West Uni-
versity Ave., conﬁ  rming that Bel-la Donna’s has ofﬁ  cially closed.
The Italian restaurant an-
nounced the closing in a Face-book post Tuesday.It thanked customers for their 
support and for “an amazing roll-er coaster ride” in the two years the business has been open.
The post stated they had “ex-
hausted” the location and are “looking for a new home.”
Owner Jodi Fuelner said she 
wants to try to reopen the restau-rant elsewhere.
“We would like to reopen,” 
she wrote in a Facebook message. “And it’s all about location, loca-tion, location! We have come this far and anything can happen!”
Some residents are disappoint-
ed that Bella Donna’s is closed.
Marcus Ball, a UF computer 
science junior, said he doesn’t know why Bella Donna’s closed, but he thinks the location may have contributed to it.“If I were to speculate, I’d 
guess they just didn’t receive enough customers to maintain that location,” he said. “I think just not enough people knew about them. I really hope they re-open someplace soon.”
Christelle Genis, a 20-year-old 
UF junior, said she used to fre-quently eat at Bella Donna’s on Sundays.
“The food really is the best 
Italian I’ve had,” she said. “It was nice to go to a mom-and-pop place where you knew you sup-ported people who really cared about your business.”

� HE WAS DIAGNOSED IN 
SPRING. 
KRISTI CAMARA
Alligator Staff Writer kcamara@alligator.org
Christopher Abeleda spent most 
of his first semester at UF playing 
basketball with his friends. He spent the entirety of the following semes-ter in the hospital.
Abeleda, nicknamed Hopper, 
was diagnosed with leukemia at the beginning of Spring. Now, he is in clinical trials for a cancer treatment pill and is being honored as a hero for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society at the Light the Night Walk this evening.
The 19-year-old UF psychology 
sophomore was playing basketball with his brother and cousins on New Year’s Day and when he began to feel weak at the start of the game.
“Within the first two seconds of 
the game, I started seeing stars and felt like fainting,” Abeleda said.
A visit to the doctor and a few 
blood tests later, Abeleda’s diagno-sis was confirmed: He had Philadel-phia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Abeleda’s sister, Mara Abeleda, a 
24-year-old UF alumna, was in New York when she heard the results.
“As soon as we found out, I went 
straight home,” she said.
Their brother, C.J. Abeleda, also 
stopped his job search after gradu-ating from the University of South Florida to join his family.
Abeleda said the diagnosis didn’t 
really bother him.
“To me, I’m just sick,” he said. “I 
told my doctor, ‘To me, it’s like hav-ing the flu.’ I’m confident I’m going to be OK.”
Abeleda received his chemo-
therapy treatments at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Orlando, where his medication intake gradually pro-gressed.
“My hair stayed on for like three 
months,” Abeleda said. “I was de-termined not to lose it, even though it ended up falling.”
Regardless of the aggressive che-
motherapy Abeleda was receiving, his optimism never diminished, and it never failed to show.
“Christopher was famous on his 
floor with all the nurses because he’d always be playing piano,” Mara Abeleda said. “Nurses were always happy to have him.”
A few months into treatment, 
Abeleda and his family received news that he may only live for two more years unless he underwent a bone marrow transplant. C.J. was found to be a perfect match. The family made preparations, knowing the operation was a risk to Abeleda’s life. It was the only option.
It was then that advancements in 
clinical trials for a drug called Spry-cel were released. Abeleda’s oncolo-gist informed him the risk of dying from a bone marrow transplant was much higher than it would be if he ingested Sprycel while continuing chemotherapy.
Now that Abeleda is in remission 
and the transplant is not currently necessary, he has returned to UF while still undergoing treatment. He has a full head of hair — usually covered by a beanie.
In the midst of Abeleda’s treat-
ment, his sister received a call from Caroline Kim, a 21-year-old UF biol-ogy senior and the liaison between UF and the Leukemia and Lympho-ma Society, a nationwide nonprofit that funds cancer research.
When Kim learned of Abeleda’s 
battle, she asked him to be one of the  honored heroes of the Light the Night Walk, taking place at 6:30 p.m. at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. Also honored will be Chris Rakacvky, a recent UF alumnus. Participants will carry illuminated balloons, honoring cancer patients and those affected.
“I would never even have thought 
that (Abeleda) was suffering,” said Kim. “I can’t even say if he’s suffer-ing because he’s so normal.”
Upon hearing about the event, 
Mara Abeleda and her family start-ed a team called Hope for Hopper. So far, the team has raised more than $5,000.
Abeleda still has two years of 
chemotherapy remaining, but he said he tries to maintain a normal lifestyle. Mostly, he aims to return to the basketball court.
“I missed intramurals last year 
with all my friends — I was really looking forward to it,” Abeleda said. “I finally get my chance, hopefully.”

the jail’s medical pod. The suicide attempt oc-
curred in between cell checks.
In the case of jail suicide attempts, Forgey 
said there are separate investigations conducted by two departments.
The criminal investigations division works to 
verify the act was a suicide and creates a time-line of the incident, he said.The office of professional standards checks to 
make sure the incident was handled correctly. It also recommends protocol to prevent similar incidents.
In the case of the two most recent suicides, 
Forgey said the office could recommend sub-stituting paper sheets to beds or completely re-moving sheets.
“We will look at the way we do business and 
see if we can make some changes to improve it,” he said.4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, OCTOBER 17, 2013

Reitz Union Board Entertainment 
will present its biggest free concert of 
the Fall tonight with electronic musi-cian XXYYXX.  
The show is free and open to the 
public and will be held at 8 p.m. in the Reitz Union Rion Ballroom. Doors open at 7:30 p.m., and wristbands will be distributed on a first-come, first-served basis, beginning at 7 p.m. outside the ballroom. No backpacks are allowed.
XXYYXX, née Marcel Everett, is a 
17-year-old electronic musician and producer from Orlando signed to the Relief in Abstract record label. Fel-low Relief in Abstract artists Marble and Fortune Howl will open for XXYYXX.
Alyssa Broderick, a 20-year-old 
UF advertising junior and RUB En-tertainment bands director, said his music is very sample-based.
“He sampled Beyoncé songs and 
Amy Winehouse, and he’ll pitch up the vocals so you can’t really tell what the sample is,” he said. “It’s re-ally awesome.”
Abigail Gruspe, a 19-year-old UF 
food science and human nutrition junior and RUB Entertainment bands director, said the group focuses on indie music and is excited to bring XXYYXX to UF.
RUB Entertainment is funding the 
event, but the directors would not disclose information about the cost.
Broderick said they had been talk-
ing to the agents back and forth since July and expect about 500 people to attend.
Ambar Mejia, a 21-year-old lin-
guistics and journalism senior, said she considered skipping class for the show, but her professor canceled class. Mejia first heard of XXYYXX at a Hundred Waters concert at High Dive last year. Since that day, she tried to see him perform again.
“There’s moments of my life 
where I just loop XXYYXX,” she said. “Definitely hoping he plays ‘Good Enough.’”XXYYXX to sample

press symptoms, according to the 
CDC. People with severe cases may be hospitalized.
Myers said 70 to 80 percent of 
people infected with the virus are asymptomatic, meaning they don’t show signs of the virus. Symptoms are based on the individual in terms of the severity and progression of the disease.
“Personal barrier precautions are 
the most effective way to prevent infection from mosquito-born dis-eases,” he said.
Myers said people should wear 
long pants and sleeves if they are outside, use insect repellent, drain standing water around homes and avoid being outside at dusk and dawn.
“You take into consideration that 
it only takes one tablespoon of water to breed up to 200 mosquitoes,” he said. “It doesn’t take very much wa-ter to create a problem.”
Walter Tabachnick, director of 
UF’s Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory in Vero Beach, described getting infected with West Nile virus as winning the lottery in reverse.
He said there are between 20 and 
100 cases of the virus a year in Flori-da. The more people are exposed to mosquitoes, the more likely they are to be one of those cases.
Alachua County has a surveil-
lance system for mosquitoes, includ-ing light traps, sentinel chickens and reports from veterinarians and phy-sicians.Tabachnick said it is unlikely a 
substantial number of cases will oc-cur after this case because it’s toward the end of the virus season. 
He said there’s no reason to be 
alarmed because of the single case.
“The virus is circulating in a lot 
of places in Florida,” he said, “and unfortunately, this individual won the lottery ticket — the ticket that nobody wants.”

An unidentiﬁ  ed detainee sits outside one of the four properties authorities were investigating 
Wednesday evening. Ofﬁ  cers simultaneously executed four search warrants on Northeast Third Avenue and Northeast Third Place as part of a narcotics investigation.
� NO ARRESTS WERE MADE 
WEDNESDAY. 
KATHRYN VARN
Alligator Staff Writer kvarn@alligator.org
After a yearlong narcotics investiga-
tion, the Gainesville-Alachua County 
Drug Task Force carried out four search warrants Wednesday evening in East Gainesville.
The Gainesville Police and Alachua 
County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce SWAT teams kept at least three people at the scene, which included properties located at 1934 NE Third Ave. and 2021 NE Third Place, as well as two in the 2000 block of Northeast Third Avenue.
Task force detectives conﬁ  scated 
street-level amounts of cocaine and marijuana at each location, according to a news release. 
No arrests were made, but multiple 
charges are pending as a result of the in-vestigation, which began last year with an anonymous tip. Wednesday, neigh-borhood residents gathered around the block of properties, standing in drive-ways near squad cars with lights ﬂ  ash-ing. One of them was 53-year-old Sharon 
Hale, who recently became a member of Gainesville Police’s Black on Black Crime Task Force.
“I’m frankly glad they’re busting 
every drug house that’s standing,” she said. “I’m really tired of seeing my peo-ple on drugs.”
Hale said she didn’t know the people 
involved, but she said she was suspi-cious of the block because she used to see cars coming and going at strange times.
Down the road, relatives of a resident 
of one of the houses stood and watched.
Lucille Shurelds, 78, said her grand-
daughter lived in one of the searched homes with her boyfriend and four chil-dren between the ages of 3 and 15.
Shurelds said she didn’t think her 
granddaughter was involved in the drug activity. In fact, she said she spoke with her granddaughter Wednesday morning. Then, the granddaughter said she thought her boyfriend was up to something, and she was going to kick him out if he was up to no good.
“She said she was going to talk to 
him,” Shurelds said, “but I guess it’s too late.”Ofﬁ  cers conﬁ  scate pot, coke after yearlong investigationALEX HARRIS

A Texas magic act left UF stu-
dents gasping, laughing and pray-
ing.
The act, called the Maze, was 
organized by Campus Crusade for Christ, said CRU intern Chris Schrum. The act was chosen be-cause of its entertainment value and was promoted by random acts of magic on campus  Wednesday.
Later, the illusionist performed to a full house in the University Au-ditorium at about 8 p.m.
Jim Munroe, the 34-year-old 
psychological illusionist, said CRU contacted him about a year ago for  the event. He calls himself a magi-cian and a skeptic, not a Christian magician.
The illusionist dazzled the au-
dience with a variety of tricks and talked about his personal thoughts on culture and society.
“The maze is the world you walk into when you leave this room,” said Munroe. “How you deal with it — love, money or religion — is up to you.”
Halfway through the show, Mu-
nroe took a moment to tell the au-dience the second half of his show involved his religious beliefs. He said he wanted to make sure the au-dience didn’t “feel tricked into com-ing to a Christian magician show.”
A few people left, but most 
stayed to hear Munroe share his ex-perience with a rare form of blood cancer from which he was cured by an experimental bone marrow transfusion procedure called DNA pairing. He said his only match in the registry was a young girl.“(The show) was entertain-
ing and also inspiring at the same time,” said Hugh Graham Jr., a 21-year-old UF criminology and law junior.
Sky Ross, an 18-year-old UF me-
chanical engineering freshman, said she thought the event was great.
“I think people are hesitant to 
come to events that have to do with Christ, but I think by using magic,  it draws people in,” she said. “It makes it believable.”

taken a screenshot of a Snapchat?Today’s question: Do you believe in magic?Gov. Scott’s ‘Project Integrity’ is a sham
Integrity is an important ideal in a democracy. Politi-
cians should have integrity, and laws should be up-held and applied by the same standard. It’s no wonder, 
then, that Gov. Rick Scott is rolling out Project Integrity.
Unfortunately, politicians in the United States often 
engage in a dirty habit of doublespeak.
Political buzzwords should make every constituent do 
a double take. Unfortunately — but not surprisingly — Scott’s new plan has nothing to do with integrity.
Instead, Scott aims to remove noncitizens from the vot-
ing roll, disproportionately affecting Hispanic voters. The policy uses racial proﬁ  ling for Scott’s electoral advantage, singling out a demographic that typically votes blue.
Let’s talk about how much integrity our governor has.It’s not the ﬁ  rst time he’s tried this tactic to beneﬁ  t 
the GOP in the ballot box. According to the Miami Her-ald, the previous voter purge began with a list of 182,000 names of suspected noncitizens. As time went on, that list dwindled to 2,600 names. Just before Election Day hit, only 198 names were left.
Although Hispanic people made up 13 percent of the 
11.3 million active registered voters, according to the Her-ald, they made up 58 percent of the list.
The list was so shoddily put together that one Cuban-
American woman named Manoly Castro-Williamson was threatened that she may lose her voting rights even though she hadn’t missed a vote in years. 
In Hillsborough County, the purge was abandoned af-
ter several people proved their citizenship.
Florida Sen. Bill Nelson also pleaded with Scott to 
heed the voice of reason and stop an unnecessary cam-paign. Citing reports from the Associated Press, Nelson blasted the governor and compared his campaign with a similar purge in 2000 that most likely won the election for George W. Bush.
The purge didn’t stop until the Department of Justice 
stepped in.It violated the Voting Rights 
Act of 1965, a law protecting mi-norities, and the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, govern-ing voter purges. 
The latter law prohibited re-
moval of “the names of ineligi-ble voters from the ofﬁ  cial lists of eligible voters” within 90 days 
of a federal primary or general election.
The Voting Rights Act outlawed the practice of redis-
tricting areas historically most affected and was motivated by racism to do so without approval from the Department of Justice. And conveniently for Scott, it was overturned by the Supreme Court earlier this year.
In 2014, Scott is up for re-election, and he knows he 
needs all the help he can get. 
While he spent almost ﬁ  ve times more than Alex Sink 
in the 2010 election, he won by a little more than 1 per-cent.
This time around, he wants to solidify his win. And 
because it’s more than 90 days away from the election and the Voting Rights Act is gone, he knows a voter purge can go on with little legal opposition. And don’t forget that a purge like this will affect minorities — and thus Demo-crats — at a higher rate.
Scott’s last attempt at a voter purge was staunchly op-
posed by election ofﬁ  cials, a senator and citizens. It mar-ginalized Florida’s largest immigrant population, and it was stopped because it violated not one but two federal laws.
Project Integrity shows Florida that its governor has 
none. Scott is spitting in the face of Florida voters by us-ing legal technicalities for his own advantage. Don’t let him.

Workers’ wages unfair
The phrase “fast-food worker” stirs up images of high 
school kids working an after-school job at Taco Bell to save up for college or a car. However, Marc Doussard, a profes-
sor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who co-authored a recent study on fast-food workers who receive public assistance, said this is not the case.
According to a University of Califorina, Berkeley, news re-
lease about the study, Doussard said, “More than two-thirds of core frontline fast-food workers across the country are over the age of 20, and 68 percent are the main wage earners in their families.”
The median wage for front-line workers at fast-food restau-
rants nationally is just $8.69 per hour. For families whose main breadwinners are fast-food workers, this presents an obvious problem — especially considering most fast-food jobs are part-time. Even for those working 40 hours or more at a fast-food restaurant, $8.69 per hour isn’t a livable wage.
Because of this, many families of fast-food workers rely on 
public assistance from programs such as Medicaid, the Chil-dren’s Health Insurance Program and the Supplemental Nutri-tional Assistance Program — more commonly known as food stamps, according to NPR. The analysis co-authored by Dous-sard found that 52 percent of fast-food workers or their families are enrolled in these programs. According to the study, taxpay-ers pay $7 billion to fund public assistance for fast-food work-ers.
According to the news release from UC Berkeley, “This is the 
public cost of low-wage jobs in America,” UC Berkeley econo-mist Sylvia Allegretto, co-chair of the Center for Wage and Em-ployment Dynamics, said. “The cost is public because taxpayers bear it. Yet it remains hidden in national policy debates about poverty, employment and public spending.”
The news release was funded by Fast Food Forward, a New 
York City advocacy group pushing for higher wages for food-service workers. The group, according to NPR, is campaigning for a raise from the $8.69 average to $15 per hour for workers.
Conservative economists, however, don’t believe this would 
alleviate the $7 billion Americans spend annually on assisting fast-food workers. NPR quoted Michael Strain, a “center-right” economist who said raising minimum wage would cause fast-food companies to lay off workers. NPR also interviewed Ken Jacobs, another co-author of the Fast Food Forward study. He said In-N-Out Burger is an example of a very successful, very proﬁ  table chain that pays its workers higher-than-average wages. He also argued that higher wages would result in less employee turnover, which is costly. It’s no secret companies thrive when they pay their workers wages that are higher than the national average. Costco, for example, has a starting pay for employees of $11.50 to $12 hourly and has a turnover rate of just 10 percent — much less than the national average of 67 percent of part-time workers in the U.S.
The numbers don’t lie, guys: Higher wages for part-time 
workers beneﬁ  t everyone from taxpayers to CEOs.

Creeping from our worst night-
mares, a “Big Ass Spider!” will 
be released in a theater near you, crushing buildings with its hairy legs, spitting skin-melting acid and making people laugh.
For one night, Gators 4 Cinema, 
located at 6741 W. Newberry Road near the Oaks Mall, will show “Big Ass Spider!,” a B-roll, indepen-dent, horror spoof about a 50-foot-tall creature that breaks out of a military lab near Los Angeles. The film starts at 10 p.m. on Friday, and admission is $7. It will also be released that day worldwide on video on demand.
The film, directed by Mike 
Mendez, started getting a lot of attention after it was screened at the South By Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, and quickly became one of the most talked-about films shown there this year.
The buzz from that “is really 
what got me going on it because I realized that this wasn’t going to be a piece of crap. It’s going to be something good,” said Jason McNeal, UF’s English department film and equipment manager, who is responsible for bringing the film to Gainesville.
“I know that people are not go-
ing to have an opportunity to see it on the big screen,” he said. “I like people to see different kinds of movies if they can, and seeing it at home on your television set is not the same.”
Ryan Hopewell, a 29-year-
old UF anthropology senior who works at Video Rodeo, laughed after he saw the trailer and said the film looks fun.
“Nobody is going to go see ‘Big Ass Spider!’ and expect that they are going to be horrified. They are going to go to laugh and just enjoy themselves because that’s the style of movie — an over-the-top horror movie,” he said.
Although she doesn’t like scary 
movies, 21-year-old UF sculpture senior Marla Rosen said “Big Ass Spider!” is something she would be interested in seeing because it looks funny.  
“I think that 
this movie is very Gainesville-appropriate,” she said. “It’s great 
that they are bringing it here for only one night because it makes it into a cool experience. It makes it special.”
In a recent film review, Crave 
Online said, “There is indeed a ‘Big Ass Spider!’ you should be aware of it, and you should be sup-porting exactly what this movie is doing with the low budget sci-fi  monster genre.”
If the film does well on Friday, McNeal said he can potentially run it again if more people are interest-ed in seeing it. He could also show other indie films in the future, making it into an event of sorts. There’s “definitely other stuff that I have my eye on,” he said.
For more information about the 
film or to see the trailer, check out its website at bigassspider.com.

An MTV cast member who breaks down 
“Guy Code” and “Girl Code” on the net-
work’s popular shows will now be laying out dating code.
Andrew Schulz rolled out his new show, 
“The Hook Up,” on Monday night. The se-ries lets singles background potential love interests using social media.
Each single goes through a three-act pro-
cess. In Act I, he or she listens to pitches from four contestants who tout their good qualities.“I’m going to let them build themselves 
up in the first act,” said Schulz, of New York, in a phone interview.
In Act II, Schulz brings up the contes-
tants’ social media accounts to “dig up the dirt” on them.
Act III forces contestants to “admit em-
barrassing details” when confronted with their social media evidence. 
In one episode, for example, Schulz said 
a guy ‘fesses up to wearing Scooby Doo un-derwear.
But it’s not all embarrassing.Schulz noted a moment from the show 
when a male contestant admitted he liked Medieval-style live-action role-playing games, and the girl reacted with delight be-cause she was into Renaissance fairs.
“Some of that stuff is adorable,” Schulz 
said. “We’re trying to show you who some-body really is before you go out on a date.”
If the single chooses 
one of the contestants to go out with, Schulz said the show will send them on a “really sick date” in Hollywood including awesome restaurants, clubs and shows.
For Schulz, the thrill of 
the fast-paced, unscripted show is jabbing contestants.
“I just want people’s good dirt,” Schulz said. “When I agreed to do the show, [I said], ‘I’ve gotta be able to roast them.’”
He said the show should connect well 
with audiences because using the Internet to vet potential dates is commonplace — and effective.
“It’s like Yelp for dating,” he said. 
“There’s a review of your guy right there.”
Schulz said he doesn’t expect “The Hook 
Up” to compete with other shows that in-volve a social media aspect such as “Cat-fish” because his show focuses on using social media to vet love interests before feel-ings develop.
“This show is almost like how to not get 
catfished,” he said. “Before you get to the love stage, I want to show you who they are.”

I sat down with up-and-coming, 
Brooklyn-based group Snowmine 
after its ﬁ  rst show in Florida on Tuesday night in Tallahassee.
Chatting with the group was as 
smooth as the sounds that blared through the speakers earlier that night and made me long to be driv-en down an open road in the West on a cool, sunny day.
The band’s sound is hard to clas-
sify under any one existing genre, but its Instagram bio describes it as ambient psych pop.
Grayson Sanders, lead vocal-
ist and guitarist, said the members’ musical backgrounds heavily inﬂ  u-ence their work. Sanders studied classical composition at New York University, where he met bassist Jay Goodman.
The two quickly re-enacted the 
experience of passing each other in the hall when Goodman, who stud-ied jazz performance, was holding a bass guitar.
“I was like, ‘Hey, you play the 
bass?’”
“I do.”“You wanna start a band?”“I do.”Since meeting about eight years 
ago, the two have started multiple bands. In the process, they met gui-tarist Calvin Pia, who studied music technology at NYU, guitarist Aus-tin Mendenhall and drummer Alex Beckmann.
Snowmine has been together for 
almost two years, and they’ve been touring for about a year, Sanders said.
The members’ camaraderie and 
love of food have kept things run-ning smoothly on the road.
They keep notes about the res-
taurants they visit, so if they’re ever in the same area, they know where to stop for food.
The Scrambled Diner in Dyer, 
Ind., is a Snowmine favorite. All ﬁ  ve members of the band raved about the Monkey Cakes, a stack of pancakes topped with dark choco-late, bananas, peanut butter, bacon, whipped cream, syrup and butter.
“Get them for everyone: you, 
your mom, your cousin,” Pia said.
The band released its ﬁ  rst album, 
“Laminate Pet Animal,” in 2011, and it received a lot of attention on the Internet.
Tuesday night’s crowd sang lyr-
ics back to the band, and Sanders ex-pressed his gratitude to everyone for being so energetic during the set.
“You feel like people are ready 
for you to play your ﬁ  rst note,” Goodman said.
The audience cheered loudly with 
both hands in the air when Sanders announced Beckmann was going to take a picture for Instagram.
Until now, the band has done 
its own promoting, but the group agreed it’s ready to take the next step with its second album.
“Rome,” Snowmine’s ﬁ  rst single, 
was released Monday and will make its radio debut next week.
The band members agreed they 
would jump, giggle and “hug it out” the ﬁ  rst time they hear their single through radio speakers.
“I’ll deﬁ  nitely order the nearest 
guacamole from the nearest per-son,” Pia said.

Dear Mediocre Advice,
My cat stares at me with disdain every single time I sit on 
the toilet. Why is he doing that?
Dear Friend,
Cats do not understand us Homo sapiens because of the weird things we 
do. This is what your cat is thinking on a regular basis: “You poop in the same 
liquid you drink and bathe in. Why would you do that? That’s poo you’re put -
ting in there! That water goes in my bowl, too! Why won’t you let me sit on that warm box thing that you stare at for hours? You act like it’s the end of the world every time I try to walk across it. Sometimes you talk to me like a baby, but I know that’s not your real voice. You shake and moan when you touch yourself, and I don’t know what’s happening, so I just stare at you. Should I call for help? What are you doing? I like to watch you shower, and you try to swat me away, but it’s OK for you to look at me when I lick my butthole? Don’t act like you haven’t done it before. Now feed me, you hairless, spaghetti-armed alien. My bowl is only half-full.”Sip, slash and sashay  your way

The waffle cone on the Daily 
Green’s menu is what separates 
the restaurant from any other in town.
The concept provides patrons 
with the option to stuff fresh veg-etables and other health foods into a waffle cone, served up regularly at Daily Green, where the restaurant owners like to do things differently.
Eddie Cromer, who prefers 
the title "master and chief," said he wants to be different.
“I want to make things you 
can’t get anywhere else,” the kitchen manager and part owner of the restaurant said.
Daily Green, a new lunch spot 
at 436 SE Second St., opened Aug. 12.
Teamwork and a mutual love 
for waffles are what inspired owners Cromer, John Arana and Adam Reinhard to create the waffle cone and other menu items like the falafel waffle.  
Arana said they are still 
healthy options because nothing is deep-fried, and all of the in-gredients that go into the waffle cones are fresh. They also serve vegan and gluten-free versions of the popular menu item.
“We felt that there was a need 
in Gainesville for the kind of food we wanted to provide,” Arana said. “It’s important for us to eat healthy food, and we feel it’s healthy for the environment. Or-ganic food is produced in a more sustainable way.”
The restaurant offers 100-
percent-fresh organic juices. Aside from the juice bar in Earth Origins, it is the only other fresh juice bar in Gainesville, Cromer said. 
Arana said the uniqueness of 
the menu items — buffalo meat, waffle cones, cornbread waffles — and the fact that everything is made in house and from scratch are what set Daily Green apart from Designer Greens or Salad Creations. 
Fernando Jaramillo, a 22-year-
old UF telecommunication senior and a former Salad Creations employee, said his previous em-ployer gets some of its dressings delivered and refrigerated. Oth-ers, like its raspberry vinaigrette, are made in-house daily. At Dai-ly Green all of the dressings are guaranteed fresh.
Arana said starting the restau-
rant and getting it going has been a lot of work. 
The owners have tried to cre-
ate a place that will offer the healthy alternative a lot of people in Gainesville have been looking for.
“It’s brought the joys of cre-
ating a team of employees that work together to deliver (healthy foods) and start a little family,” Arana said.
Cromer said Daily Green is 
different because it’s not a chain restaurant. He said there are places that claim to be healthy but aren’t. 
“Phonies,” he said.

Pumpkins and nutmeg get all of the 
attention this time of year, but there 
isn’t any reason we can’t show some fall love to a year-round favorite: chick-en. This recipe makes a great entree for any fall festivities you plan! It’s fast, easy and will make your guests want to keep coming back for more. As college students, it’s sometimes hard to make enough time to cook a full meal, but you can pair this chicken with mashed potatoes or rice for a well-balanced and kidney-friendly meal.
What you need:2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil1 ½ tablespoons butter with canola  1 teaspoon minced garlic1 ½ cups apple cider1 organic Granny Smith apple½ white onion2 bay leavesGround thyme1 teaspoon black pepper1 tablespoon all-purpose flour4 boneless skinless chicken breasts
What to do:
Heat half the oil and half the but-
ter in a deep pan large enough to fit all four chicken breasts. 
While the oil is heating, chop the onion into small pieces and dice the ap-ple. Rub the chicken with the rest of the oil and the pepper, rubbing each piece with equal amounts oil and pepper. 
Cook the chicken 
on medium heat for about seven minutes in the pan, flipping frequently to ensure an equal cook on both sides. Remove the chicken from the 
pan, and set it aside. 
Put the onions, apples, garlic, thyme 
and bay leaves into the pan, and cook on medium-high heat until the onions become translucent and the apples change color slightly (about five min-utes). Sprinkle the rest of the butter and the all-purpose flour evenly in the pan, and mix it in well before placing the chicken back into the pan. 
Place all four chicken breasts back 
into the pan with the onions, apples and spices, and add the apple cider. Surround the chicken with the apples and onions, and bring the mixture to a boil. 
After boiling for about 2 minutes, 
reduce the heat to a simmer, and cover the pan to allow the chicken to cook through. 
After about 10 minutes, turn off the 
stovetop and let the chicken sit for a minute or two before serving. Fall for chicken by cooking 
with apples — for the kidneys

You’re done with being the same ol’ cli-
ches for Halloween. Why not use this year 
as your chance to branch out and create a costume with more relevance? Chances are there won’t be anyone in your group with these costumes. You’ll be the talk of the cos-tume party — and not because you drank too much punch.
� What could be more 
meaningful than dressing up like a pregnant real-ity star? The question here isn’t “why?” but instead, “why not?” A preggers Kim K is sure to catch some attention. 
I’m thinking Kim’s Met Ball floral dress 
is the best option for this. It won’t take much sifting through the thrift store or Grandma’s closet for the perfect floral dress. Make sure you have some extra room for the necessary baby bump, which can be achieved with a pillow and a belt.
� Or answer a burning question with your 
costume: What does the fox say? If you’re not 
sure of the answer, don’t worry — Norwegian duo Ylvis doesn’t know either. 
For girls, a black skirt or shorts with a white button-down and a skinny black tie will give you the base of your outfit. Guys, you get the same deal but with black pants. 
The fun comes with the hat and your 
makeup. Make your own fox hat or find one at a party store. Draw on some whiskers and paint your nose, but make sure you go for a foxy look and not too catty. Attach a tail to your behind for an added touch. 
Possibilities for the answer to what a 
fox says and more costume inspiration can be found in the music video for Ylvis’ song “What Does the Fox Say?”
� If you’re a dude, why not go as Repub-
lican Sen. Ted Cruz? I’d say this is pretty 
relevant. Plus it gives you a reason to wear a suit, and guys love to wear suits, right? Slap on a Cruz name tag, and there will be no question about who you are. Feel free to 
read parts of “Green Eggs and Ham” and talk 
about “Star Wars” throughout the night.
� Remember the wreck that was Amanda 
Bynes? Go as the tragic faded starlet this Hal-loween. People may confuse you for Miley, but the long messy hair should clarify. Part all your hair to one side if you don’t have a messy wig. Dress more revealing than usual. Glue jewels on your face to imitate random facial piercings. Carry around a small stuffed dog in your purse, but I don’t advise starting any fires in driveways.Foxy, pregnant politicians?

The latest season in the disturbing an-
thology “American Horror Story” has all 
the elements of a successful Disney Channel original movie or cult CW series. “Coven” has young adults, an evocative boarding school, magic and a sense of danger. Except, unlike the attractively cast whim-indulgent shows of teenage TV, “Coven” does not portray a fantasy you want to vicariously live through. Rather, it is your worst night-mare.
Like its predecessors, the third season 
of “AHS” does not fail to shock our moral sensibilities and leave us craving more. If the opening credits are any foreshadow-ing of the upcoming season, we can expect dark allusions to slavery, lots of voodoo, mythical creatures and anything “Hocus Pocus”-related (cats, levitation, potions, pentagrams).
The premiere follows Zoe Benson, played 
by Taissa Farmiga, and her story as to how she ends up in the boarding school with the other “gifted girls.” She is like Harry Pot-ter when he is still living with the Dursleys, except instead of a Hogwarts letter, Zoe discovers her power through more explicit means.
Zoe is the descendant in a long line of 
witches with a rather creative and bizarre ability that sometimes skips generations, but obviously not hers.
She is quickly swept off to school, 
but instead of a burly but lovable Hagrid-type, she is transported by silent men in suits who look like they are part of the Secret Service.
Zoe is dropped off alone in New 
Orleans outside Miss Robichaux’s Academy for Exceptional Young Ladies — a smoke screen for its actual purpose as a school for young witches, which is run by headmaster Cordelia Foxx, protrayed by Sarah Paulson.
Cordelia traces the history of the house 
as a safe haven for witches, which she says are a dying breed. The headmaster stress-es the dangers of being supernatural in a black-and-white world and the importance of controlling one’s powers or risk being burned at the stake.
But like the Xavier Institute in “X-Men,” there is some tension between teacher and student about assimilation versus fighting back. Other than Zoe, there are only three other students at the academy: a clairvoy-ant named Nan played by Jamie Brewer, a human voodoo doll portrayed by Gabourey Sidibe, and an arrogant telekinetic movie star named Madison played by Emma Rob-erts.
The antagonist to conscious 
Cordelia is her less-restrained moth-er, reigning Supreme witch Fiona Goode, protrayed by Jessica Lange, who believes the young witches need to maximize their power in order to be invincible against hu-mans.
Fiona is like a wicked version of one 
of the Ya-Ya sisters. She dances around in a sheer black robe, reciting spells one mo-ment and reaping her vengeance in another. Fiona is reaching her final quarter of life, and she has a dangerous obsession with im-mortality.
I expect this theme of vanity will be a 
recurring one, seeing how the show opens with a barefaced Kathy Bates painting blood on her face with a makeup brush in order to stay young. If that wasn’t enough of a haunting image, I instantly flashed back to her as a psychotic Annie Wilkes hobbling her captives’ feet in “Misery.”
Bates plays Madame Delphine LaLaurie 
in “AHS,” the lady of the household, who is based on a controversial past New Or-leans resident. And while everything seems Southern-proper to the outside world, in-side and up in her attic, Madame Delphine keeps slaves to mutilate and torture. Show creator Ryan Murphy is known to allude to sensitive historical events as with the Holocaust last season, and this season, I would expect no less. Like the cruel count-ess Elizabeth Bathory in the legends, Ma-dame Delphine harvests blood and organs because she believes they will give her eter-nal youth. She also has some kind of sick fascination with mythology as she affixes a hollowed-out bull’s head on her restrained manservant Bastian and proudly proclaims she now has her very own Minotaur. Think of the Doomsday Killers Four Horsemen re-enactment in season 6 of “Dexter.”
If “AHS” is anything, it is shocking. Some 
of the surprises are plot twists, and some are just so abrasive to our regular percep-tion that we recoil. In a one-hour episode, the audience is confronted with racial injus-tice, gang-rape, murder, sadism and perse-cution, and this is just the beginning.
“AHS” is a horrible show, and we are 
horrible people for watching it.

SEC Basketball Media Days

Even before he caught his first pass for Missouri, Dorial 
Green-Beckham was lauded as the Southeastern Conference’s 
next great receiver. 
After a freshman season filled with mixed results, Green-
Beckham has taken a step toward realizing his potential and has helped Missouri create a prolific passing offense in the pro-cess. 
“They’ve got a prototype they recruit,” Florida defensive co-
ordinator D.J. Durkin said. “Those guys are all rangy. They’re big. They’re obviously a tough matchup.”
Green-Beckham, a 6-foot-6, 225-pound receiver, came to 
Missouri facing enormous expectations. 
He capped an incredible high school career that saw him 
set national preps records for career receiving yards and touch-downs by hauling in 119 passes for 2,233 yards and 24 touch-downs as a senior. 
Rivals.com rated him the nation’s No. 1 overall prospect. 
ESPN was only slightly lower on him, ranking Green-Beckham the third overall recruit in the country. 
With his immense talent came an equally large persona. 
Green-Beckham became known as D. G. B. on campus and quickly drew comparisons to former standout receivers A.J. Green of Georgia and Julio Jones of Alabama. 
But the results were not as quick to come. Green-Beckham finished his freshman season with a mod-
est 28 receptions for 395 yards and five touchdowns as Mis-souri stumbled to a 5-7 record during its first year in the SEC.
Through six games as a sophomore in 2013, the results have 
been significantly better for both Green-Beckham and the Ti-gers. No. 14 Missouri (6-0, 2-0 SEC) is undefeated and coming off a shocking 41-26 victory on the road against No. 15 Geor-gia. 
“We earned a little more respect,” Missouri coach Gary Pin-
kel said. “The respect level just went up a couple notches.”
Green-Beckham was already widely respected. Now his 
production is matching his potential. The sophomore has al-ready surpassed his receiving yardage from last season and needs just one reception and a single touchdown to match his production as a freshman. 
A matchup with the No. 22 Gators on Saturday at 12:21 p.m. 
in Columbia, Mo., provides the biggest test of the season for Green-Beckham and the Tigers’ receiving corps. 
Missouri will be without starting quarterback James Frank-lin, who is expected to miss 3-5 weeks after suffering a shoul-der injury against Georgia. With Franklin at the helm, Green-Beckham and L’Damian Washington were seventh and fifth, respectively, in the SEC in receiving yardage as Missouri passed for an average of 276.3 yards per game. 
Without Franklin, the Tigers will turn to redshirt freshman 
Maty Mauk at quarterback. Mauk, who is mostly untested, completed all three of his passes for 23 yards in relief of Frank-lin against Georgia. For the season, he has completed 5 of 6 passes for 41 yards.“We were confident with him on Saturday,” sophomore 
center Evan Boehm said of Mauk. “He drove us down the field and scored a touchdown. That’s something special to do after sitting on the sideline all game.”
Establishing a connection with Green-Beckham and the rest 
of his receivers against Florida’s talented secondary will be critical for Mauk.
“We know what he’s capable of doing,” Green-Beckham 
said. “We just have to see it from him when he goes out there.”

Cody Riggs remembers practice on 
Sept. 24. That is when the injury bug struck 
again. 
While defending a screen pass in prepa-
ration for a game against Kentucky, defen-sive tackle Dominique Easley suffered a torn right ACL. 
For Riggs, like many other players on 
Florida’s defense, Easley’s injury hit close to home. 
Riggs and Easley arrived together at UF under coach Urban Meyer after earning spots at the Under Armour All-America game coming out of high school. 
Now, they will never 
play another snap to-gether on defense. 
“I was on the field the 
same time he got hurt,” Riggs said. “I was just like, ‘How does that happen?’” 
That question has become all too famil-
iar for the No. 22 Gators. 
Florida lost running back Matt Jones to a torn left meniscus Saturday against No. 6 LSU. 
Jones became the seventh Gator to suf-
fer a season-ending injury this season. Florida lost its top defensive tackle, start-ing quarterback and starting running back in a span of three weeks.
“I’ve never been on a team with this 
many season-ending injuries,” Riggs said. “But we have a lot of guys that have stepped up, so at least we have the depth to make up for it.”
Tyler Murphy has filled in for Jeff 
Driskel, and the Gators have used a rota-tion of defensive linemen to help fill the void left by Easley. 
Redshirt junior Mack Brown will replace 
Jones and make his second career start on Saturday in Columbia, Mo., against No. 14 Missouri. 
Brown gained 112 yards on 25 carries 
starting in place of Jones during Florida’s season opener against Toledo on Aug. 31. 
“I played ball for like 16 years and 
I’ve never seen nothing like this before,” Brown said. “You have got to step up and do our jobs. It’s not over yet. Just got to

Gators go under knife: Coach Will Mus-
champ announced Wednesday that Easley 
would undergo surgery today on his right knee in Pensacola with renowned surgeon Dr. James Andrews. 
Jones underwent surgery on his left knee 
Monday. 
As the Gators lost two players to season-
ending procedures this week, another is waiting for his return to the ﬁ  eld.
Redshirt junior Ronald Powell has 
missed the last three days of practice due to an ankle injury he suffered in Florida’s 17-6 loss on Saturday. Muschamp said he did not know the extent of the injury dur-ing Wednesday’s weekly SEC coaches me-dia teleconference. 
Florida’s third-year coach expects to 
know by game time whether Powell will be able to play. He missed all of last season due to two knee surgeries repairing a torn right ACL. 
Early start time in Columbia: There will 
not be any nature walks this weekend. 
Offensive coordinator Brent Pease helped 
his quarterbacks pass the time awaiting a 7 p.m. kickoff in Lexington, Ky., by taking them on an educational stroll around their hotel.
However, with a 12:21 p.m. kickoff at 
Missouri, Florida will be playing its earliest game of the season and will not have time for any additional activities.
 “Personally, I like the early games just 
because you wake up and you just go out there and play,” right guard Jon Halapio said. “The night games, you’re just waiting around the hotel the whole day and watch-ing the other games and just very anxious.”16, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, OCTOBER 17, 2013
NOTES , from page 15Powell misses 
practice after suffering ankle injury SaturdayTHE RALLY
Each week, two alligatorSports col-
umnists will debate the biggest looming matchup in college foot-
ball. Today, Adam Lichtenstein and Joe Morgan preview No. 5 Florida State’s showdown against No. 3 Clemson in Clemson, S.C., on Saturday at 8 p.m. on ABC.
Adam: FSU-Clemson has essen-
tially served as the Atlantic Coast Conference championship 
game for the past several seasons. The actual title game in De-cember between the conference’s division champions is nearly irrelevant, as the winner of this game has been the pre-eminent ACC team. The last four winners of this annual matchup have won the Atlantic Division, and the last two victors have won the conference.
Saturday’s matchup between top-ﬁ  ve teams in the other 
Death Valley will be no different. But unlike last season, Clem-
son will come out as the team to beat in the ACC and, arguably, the nation.
The Tigers already have big wins under their belts. They end-
ed last season with a bowl victory against LSU and rang in the new season with a 38-35 win against then-No. 5 Georgia. 
Clemson has shown that it can beat top teams from the top 
conference in the nation. This weekend, it will show that the pre-mier ACC team actually borders the Atlantic.
Joe: Well, I hate to burst your bubble right off the bat, Adam, 
but the states of Florida and South Carolina both border the At-lantic Ocean. Learn your geography, man!
When it comes to this weekend’s game, I’m putting all of my 
eggs in Jameis Winston’s basket because, well, he’s Jameis Win-ston.
On second thought, the whole egg thing is too much Easter. 
It’s October. I need to get my mind right. I’m putting all of my Halloween candy in Winston’s Trick-or-Treat bag. 
The freshman leads the ACC in passer rating (213.9), comple-
tion percentage (73.2) and touchdown passes (17). Granted, he hasn’t faced a pass defense better than Nevada’s 51st-ranked unit, but his numbers are straight out of a video game.
Dealing with Clemson’s secondary shouldn’t lead to a dra-
matic drop-off.
Adam: Tallahassee is much closer to the Gulf of Mexico. The 
panhandle is barely Florida. We drove through there last week-end, and yeesh, it’s just miles of nothing.
But you already brought up a point I would have made — 
“Famous Jameis” and the Seminoles have not faced any kind of real competition.
Congratulations on your big win against powerhouse Bet-
hune-Cookman, FSU.
The only decent team Florida State has played is an overrated 
and overmatched Maryland squad in front of 75,000 scream-ing, chopping ‘Noles fans. The Terrapins aren’t even receiving votes in the AP or Coaches’ Polls anymore! 
For as impressive as Winston has 
been this season, the fairy tale has to end sometime. It is ridiculous that people are saying that he might be the best quarterback in Seminoles history ﬁ  ve games into his career. 
This is a school that has two Heis-
man-winning signal-callers.
If you want to talk quarterbacks, talk Tajh Boyd. The senior has already thrown for 3,800 yards twice in his 
career. He’s a proven commodity on his way to the best season of his career.
Boyd is going to show Winston what it means to be a quar-
terback in the ACC on Saturday. All the freshman needs to do is sit back and watch.
Joe: I’m sure Boyd has plenty to offer in terms of experience 
to a young guy like Winston, but he’ll have even more to offer FSU’s secondary.
Boyd averages nearly 31 throws per game, giving the ‘Noles’ 
second-ranked pass defense 31 chances to make something hap-pen.
Faced with an efﬁ  cient offense that ranks third nationally 
with 53.6 points per game and fourth nationally with 549 yards per game, Boyd has little margin for error against a ball-hawking defense aiming to add to its total of six interceptions this sea-son.
Meanwhile, Winston will add to everything but his intercep-
tion tally of two. Clemson has faced only one passing offense ranked among the nation’s top 50 and that was Georgia.
If the Bulldogs had any kind of defense this season, Aaron 
Murray’s 323 passing yards would have been enough to beat the Tigers.
Adam: The Seminoles may have a top pass defense, but have 
they faced a receiver anywhere near as electric as Sammy Wat-kins?
The junior is one of the best receivers in the nation (and is 
Florida defensive back Jaylen Watkins’ half brother). Boyd and Watkins have combined to be one of the most dynamic duos in the country, and they are going to put FSU’s defense to the test.
Expect the Seminoles’ pass defense to fall a few spots after 
Saturday.
Joe: They may fall a few spots, but the Seminoles won’t drop 
too far. Florida State isn’t ranked second against the pass for nothing. But even if this game devolves into a shootout, I still like the Seminoles’ chances.
I’m more conﬁ  dent that Florida State’s top-10 defense can 
make a critical stop than Clemson. The Death Valley crowd can-not and will not intimidate “Famous Jameis.”
If you thought the Winston hype was insane during the sea-
son’s ﬁ  rst seven weeks, brace yourself for the aftermath of the freshman’s ﬁ  rst signature win for the Seminoles.Who will win the FSU-Clemson game?
