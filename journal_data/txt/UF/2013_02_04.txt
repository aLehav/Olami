Players representing UF 
Student Affairs raised $5,000 
for a local elementary school 
renovation project after win-ning a charity kickball tourna-ment in southwest Gainesville 
on Saturday.
The daylong contest pit-
ted UF Student Affairs against 
more than 40 local businesses and organizations during the 
seventh annual Alachua Coun-
ty Emerging Leaders Champi-
ons for Charity kickball tourna-ment at Diamond Sports Park, 
located at 4000 SW 122nd St.
The tournament collected 
$11,600 in sponsor money and 
entry fees.
UF Student Affairs won 
the tournament for the second 
year in a row, defeating the 
Gainesville Health and Fitness Center’s Balls & Dolls 7-0 dur-ing the championship game.
The team’s winnings will be 
donated to Project Makeover, a volunteering project that has renovated local needy elemen-tary schools since 2008.
Kevin Johnson, a 29-year-old player for the UF Student Affairs team, said the event was a way to bring people to-gether for a good cause.
“I don’t think anybody can 
come out here and say this wasn’t a success,” he said.
Newberry Mayor Bill Con-
rad praised the arrangement Newberry and Gainesville have in managing Diamond Sports Park, which Newberry operates within Gainesville city limits.
The tournament began at 
about 10 a.m. with the teams lining up on the main ﬁ  eld. The opening ceremony started with addresses from Alachua County Emerging Leaders President Andrew Romero, Gainesville Mayor Craig Lowe and Conrad.
Lowe later said Saturday’s 
tournament was the ﬁ  rst time he’s attended since being elect-ed mayor almost three years ago.
“It’s great to see people 
from various companies and organizations come together for charity to make our com-munity a better one,” he said.

Stop, drop and roll shouldn’t be the 
newest dance craze.
A deadly ﬁ  re at a Brazil nightclub 
last week cast ﬁ  re safety into the spot-
light, but students and local residents 
can feel secure in that Gainesville clubs 
must uphold rules set by Gainesville Fire Rescue.
Brazil’s Kiss nightclub had expired 
ﬁ  re and municipal licenses, only had one exit and was over capacity by hun-dreds of people. That, in addition to a pyrotechnic display , are thought to be the causes of a deadly inferno that took 
the lives of nearly 240 people.In Gainesville, though, all clubs are 
required to undergo an annual inspec-
tion from the ﬁ  re department in addi-tion to unannounced night inspections from department ofﬁ  cials, said JoAnne Rice, assistant ﬁ  re chief at Gainesville Fire Rescue.
During night inspections, ofﬁ  cials 
check if the club is keeping track of how many people are coming in and out and if bouncers know what their occupant load is. They also check if all emergency lighting works and if all ex-its are accessible.
Clubs are also required to train their 
employees through the ﬁ  re department 
to become crowd managers. Crowd Gainesville clubs always

To celebrate Black History Month, Maya An-
gelou and Kendrick Lamar will both be appear-
ing on campus.
Lamar, a rapper known for platinum-selling 
song “Swimming Pools,” will be performing at 8 
p.m. Feb. 25 at the Stephen C. O’Connell Center.
Student tickets are $20 for the ground and 
ﬁ  rst level, and $25 for general admission. For the 
second and third ﬂ  oors, student tickets are $10 and $15 for general admission.
Ticket sales begin Feb. 7 at the University Box 
Ofﬁ  ce.
Evan Galin, vice chair of public relations for 
Student Government Productions, said tickets 
can also be purchased on Ticketmaster.
Galin said SGP collaborated with the Black 
Student Union to select the artists, and they re-
ceived Facebook input requesting Lamar.
“I’m excited about seeing the variety of stu-
dents that are going to come,” the 20-year-old public relations junior said. “Celebrating Black History Month is important for everyone.”
Angelou, a Pulitzer Prize nominated poet, 
will be performing through Accent Speakers’ Bureau. She will be performing at 8 p.m. Feb. 27 at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts. Tickets are free.
Galin said it was important to have Lamar 
and Angelou perform in the same week because it represents the past and the present.
Satcha Sanon, a 20-year-old industrial and 
systems engineering sophomore, said she will get a ticket to both.
“Front row, if possible,” she said.Sanon said to hear Maya Angelou was com-
ing to UF was a shock.
“I’m excited to see her,” she said. “Maya An-
gelou is really inspirational in that I know that 
she will impact people of all colors when she 
comes to speak.”

Year of the Dragon was so 2012. 
This lunar new year is the Year of 
the Snake, and the Chinese American 
Student Association brought it in 
by hosting a Chinese New Year celebration.
About 500 people showed up to 
bring in the new year, along with about 10 different Asian-American organizations, to celebrate Chinese culture and Asian-American unity.
In a blend of traditional and modern 
culture, the event showcased many facets of Chinese-American students’ talents. 
There were several classic dances 
such as the Umbrella dance and the Water Sleeve dance. 
Students showcased their modern 
talents such as a rendition of Mariah Carey’s “Hero” and a rap group, 
“Beauty and the Beats,” which sang, 
beat boxed and rapped two songs. 
Before the intermission, the 
association took the time to discuss 
their philanthropy, Room to Read, 
which helps the Half the Sky movement empower women by ending oppression, in this case, by helping them read. 
Two special guests came to the 
event, Samuel Wang, the creative director of fashion brand Akufuncture, and hip-hop artist Jason Chu, who had the crowd cheering for children raised by “Tiger Moms,” or strict Chinese parents.
When the show wasn’t going on, 
different Asian-American interest groups had activities for attendees at their information booths.
Jason Liu, a 19-year-old sociology 
sophomore, helped organize the event and had been doing so since November. 
He said that the goal of the event 
was to “keep it fresh” so that freshmen who were there for the first time and seniors who had come to cultural events before could still see something new.
Kevin Nguyen, a 19-year-old 
telecommunication sophomore, is president of the Vietnamese Student Organization. 
He said that the event was a 
celebration of everybody.
“It focuses on Chinese culture,” 
he said, “and shows the talents of not only Asian-Americans but of UF.”

Feb. 8, 1966: A ‘Go Gators’ sign was stolen, and 
the owner offered a $10 reward to anyone with in-
formation. The sign rode around the stadium and campus during the football season on top of a car. Carl Heishman, cheerleader and owner of the sign, 
believed the sign was stolen and mutilated. He found 
the remnants of the sign and glitter near his car. The sign was worth about $110.
Feb. 6, 1989: A university pageant spurred an anti-
pageant protest. The 1989 Miss University of Florida Scholarship Pageant drew 18 contestants, about a thousand spectators and a half-dozen protesters who wanted the event eliminated. “A whole class of people, namely women, are being oppressed on the UF campus,” said Campus National Organization for 
Women president Jenny Brown.
Feb. 4, 1997: An asteroid was named after a UF 
astronomy professor. The International Astronomi-
cal Union named the asteroid, which orbits the sun between Mars and Jupiter, after professor Heinrich Eichhorn for his work in astrometry , the science of measuring celestial bodies. He had recently devel-oped a new mathematical technique to measure dis-tances between stars.
Feb. 5, 2003: UF researchers aimed to improve 
space shuttle technologies. This followed the space shuttle Columbia accident Feb. 1 that resulted in the death of all seven crew members. One of the projects was UF’s Institute for Future Space Transport. It was part of a $15 million alliance between seven univer -
sities developing a replacement for NASA’s shuttle fleet.

It looks like an oasis at the edge of the 
278-acre Morningside Nature Center in 
east Gainesville.
Inside the green building where three 
small tables line the front window and cof-fee steams on a side counter, Louis Lee is hard at work in the kitchen.
Lee wanted to open his own restaurant 
for a long time. His dream became a reality Saturday morning with the grand opening of LL’s Bar-B-Que, a classic southern bar -
becue restaurant located at 3807 E. Univer -
sity Ave.
Lee is no stranger to cooking. He has 
worked as a chef for UF’s Pi Lambda Phi 
fraternity since 1981 and spent his sum-
mers in Maine cooking for a camp.
He said he was inspired to open his own 
restaurant from the positive feedback he’s received over the years for his cooking.
“Everywhere I go, people like my food,” he said. “So I figured, let me try it.”
LL’s Bar-B-Que is open from 6 a.m. to 
7 p.m. Monday through Saturday and is closed on Sundays.
Lee said he takes an old-fashioned 
approach to cooking barbecue: He uses only wood and a smoker instead of gas to 
cook.
For breakfast, he serves up egg sand-
wiches (starting at $1.65) and omelets 
(starting at $2). Later in the day, he serves everything from burgers ($4.50) to fried 
chicken (starting at $2.99), ribs ($11 for a 
half slab) and — Lee’s favorite — the pork calzone ($4.99).
Shreya Patel, a 20-year-old UF business 
administration junior, works as a cashier at LL’s Bar-B-Que.
“I want to work here because LL is like 
a pillar in his community,” she said. “This is just what he wants to do, and I just want 
to be here to watch it lift off the ground 
and be a success.”
Will Knapper, a 21-year-old UF mechan-
ical engineering senior and Pi Lambda Phi 
brother, attended the grand opening along 
with pledges and brothers to show sup-port for his fraternity’s chef.
He said Lee is the most respected per -
son in his fraternity house.
“He’s just been through so much, and 
he’s such a hard worker and a dedicated person that I just can’t see this place not doing well,” he said. “And he makes great 
food, so that helps, too.”
was rusty because he hadn’t held a 
kickball in more than 40 years.
The Champions for Charity kick-
ball tournament has raised more than $45,000 since 2007.
Romero said Alachua County 
Emerging Leaders raises awareness of local, young professionals in the city and throughout Alachua County.
He added his organization and 
events, like the kickball tournament, are needed to support the local com-munity.
“We’re trying to make this commu-
nity a livable place for young people,” he said. “There’s a lot of youthful cre-ativity here — young people who are doing stuff — and I kind of see our organization as one of the connecting forces between all of them.”  
Lowe couldn’t resist using word-
play to commend the Alachua County Emerging Leaders.
“They really do step up to the plate 
to come together for the entire com-munity,” he said.4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 2013

Just hours after a new Walmart Su-
percenter opened Friday , Gainesville 
Police arrested a man for shoplifting.
Police charged Charles R. J. Jackson, 
21, of 1055 SW 62nd Blvd., with petit theft, according to a GPD arrest report.
The incident started at about 3:30 p.m. 
when Jackson walked into the Walmart, located in the 5700 block of Northwest 34th Boulevard, according to the report, and took an MP3 player, priced at $79.38, from a shelf.
A loss prevention officer saw Jack-son take the MP3 player and go into a bathroom. A few minutes later, Jackson 
walked out of the bathroom toward the 
exit, according to the report.
The officer found the MP3 player’s 
packaging in a trash can, according to the report.  Loss prevention staff stopped Jackson before he left the store, and offi-cers later arrested him.
During questioning with police, Jack-
son said he stole the MP3 player because he didn’t have enough money to pay for it. Jackson added he wanted to give it to his little brother.
Police booked Jackson into the Ala-
chua County Jail just after 4 p.m. Friday with a $10,000 bond. He was later re-leased at about 4:30 p.m. Sunday.

The UF Supreme Court voted Friday to 
uphold the Election Commission’s decision 
to not order a cease and desist on Swamp 
Party campaign activities.
The Students Party appealed to the Su-
preme Court after the Election Commission 
ruled that Swamp Party presidential candi-
date Christina Bonarrigo’s candidacy an-
nouncement was within the allowed time period for campaign activity.
The court voted 4-2 and held no specific 
reason because the justices had different 
views on the wording of the election codes.
Supreme Court Chief Justice Matt Michel 
said the justices disagreed with the limits 
placed on campaigning and how the limit 
applied to the university versus federal and 
state laws.
Students Party counsel Christian Chess-
man pushed for the court to order an imme-diate cease and desist to the Swamp Party and Bonarrigo to end all campaign activi-ties.
“My party needs to be protected from the 
comparative speech advantage,” Chessman said.
In order to issue a cease and desist com-
plaint, the Students Party must prove the 
Swamp Party had a strong likelihood of a 
violation, and the campaign material must 
irreparably harm the of-fended party or candidate.
Swamp Party counsel 
Ryan Gilbert moved for sanctions against Chessman for frivolous complaints.
“The Swamp Party acted 
in good faith and tried to stay within the compounds 
of code,” Gilbert said.
Due to time sensitivity, the court will hear 
four other complaints Wednesday at 8 p.m. in the Martin H. Levin Advocacy Center.

managers are taught how to plan and execute 
an evacuation in case of an emergency while also handling people in the club.
“In case of an emergency, we want people to 
be able to get out – it’s imperative,” Rice said. 
“Overcrowding leads to imminent danger.”
Rice said once the club has 50 people pres-
ent, it needs a crowd manager. An extra crowd 
manager must be present for every additional 250 people.
In a nightclub or bar the ratio is one person 
per seven square feet. When sitting at a bar, the ratio decreases to one person per 18 square inches, Rice said.
Simons Nightclub general manager Mike 
Paper said Simons is undergoing a construction project to broaden the passageway and add an additional room, raising the club’s capacity by 200 people.
“Some of our decisions here were affected 
by the Brazil disaster,” Paper said.
Establishments are required to have a mini-
mum of two exits. Larger clubs like Simons have more than 10 exits to accommodate crowds.
Spannk and 2nd Street Speakeasy, both 
owned by Danny Robinson, have at least two outdoor exits, along with a hallway that con-nects the two clubs.
Additional fire safety precautions include an 
approved safety plan by the fire marshal. Ev-
ery six months, the clubs are fire treated, which 
makes fabrics inside the club fire-retardant.

With the conclusion of the five-day quali-
fying period Friday, the race for the March 
city elections is on.
As of Sunday night there were six may-
oral candidates as well as three District 4 City Commission candidates, according to the Ala-chua County Supervisor of Elections Office.
In the mayoral race, former Gainesville-
Alachua County Regional Airport Authority board member Peter Johnson, Donald Shep-herd Sr., Mark Venzke and former city com-missioners Ed Braddy and Scherwin L. Hen-ry are challenging incumbent Mayor Craig Lowe.
In the City Commission race, UF building 
construction junior Alfredo Espinosa, former City Commissioner W.E. “Mac” McEachern and incumbent Commissioner Randy Wells are vying for the District 4 seat.
There had been some concern about 
McEachern’s eligibility to run because his ad-dress no longer falls within District 4 bound-aries after redistricting in December. How-ever, according to the Supervisor of Elections 
Office, he’s still considered qualified to run.
“Qualifying was a bit unusual because of the last-minute changes they made in [re-]
districting,” he said. “The qualifying process 
was more of a distraction. I don’t think it’ll 
have any effect on the campaign now.”
In the mayoral race, Henry said he looked 
forward to this year’s elections.
“For me, the race hinges on who can best 
lead,” he said.
Johnson said he wanted 
to run for mayor to help ease partisanship in Gainesville.
“I thought I could bring 
people of different views to-
gether,” he said.
Braddy said his primary 
concern is the cost of living in Gainesville.
“City Hall has turned a deaf ear to [citi-
zens’] concerns about affordability,” he said.
Four candidate forums are scheduled dur -
ing the campaign. The first, hosted by the Af-rican American Accountability Alliance, will 
take place at 6:30 p.m. at the Alachua County 
Health Department, located at 224 SE 24th St.
Elections will be held March 19. All registered voters living in Gainesville 
can vote in the mayoral race, while only 
District 4 residents can vote in the District 4 
race.Mayoral, city commission

OPINIONS EDITORBlunder Mifﬂ  in: 
How will 
‘The Ofﬁ  ce’ end?
The show “30 Rock” ended last week. 
Forever. Seven seasons of TV gold met with mediocre 
fanfare just over and done with.
Yeah, we were sad to see it go. How could we not be? Tina 
Fey’s brainchild helped us get through high school and college; 
those can be some pretty delicate times for young ladies.
Another comedy titan is coming to an end soon, too. “The Ofﬁ  ce” has its ﬁ  nal season this year.Arguably, it lost a lot of its fans with the departure of Steve 
Carell, who played the lovable and stupid Michael Scott. Many fans were upset that the driving forces behind the show, Scott’s antics and the chemistry building behind a Jim-and-Pam ro-
mance, were resolved too early on in the show’s run.
But don’t forget about it just yet.
No, it hasn’t helped move along a weirdly suggestive phe-
nomenon like “That’s What She Said” in a while, but that doesn’t mean it’s uninteresting.
Also, everyone has different tastes in comedy . Fun fact: Nearly every comedic show on NBC we’ve shown 
our parents has not gone over well. They don’t even smile dur-ing “Parks and Recreation,” and that’s one of the most joyful 
shows on television right now.
You should maybe start getting prepared for “The Ofﬁ  ce” to 
shock you. There’s already a gay politician on there; it’s ready to 
take us to some real emotional places. 
Jim and Pam could get divorced. This is just a theory , but we 
wanted to prepare you for the possibility, just in case it’s true.
“Slowly realizing that locked in by their growing responsi-
bilities, Jim and Pam are both going to work at Dunder-Mifﬂ  in until they die,” wrote Molly Lambert for “Grantland” back in 
Sept. 2011.
As that was written more than a year ago, we think the path 
“The Ofﬁ  ce” has planted for Jim and Pam is one that won’t work.  
Jim’s new job in Philly combined with Pam’s recent frustrations in the ofﬁ  ce don’t leave us feeling easy about their relationship.
This series, by the way, has been a documentary/mocku-
mentary the whole time, and you should also remember that point right about now. 
The fourth wall is going to be broken more than it already 
is.
“‘The Ofﬁ  ce’ has always balanced out its humor and absur-
dity with insight into the bleakest depths of human nature,” said Lambert. “If anyone could pull it off, they could.”
“With Jim’s budding startup job in Philly and the Halperts’ 
budding interaction with the documentary crew,” said Megh Wright in a “Splitsider” article this month, “it’s likely that the Philly situation will play a huge factor in the series ﬁ  nale come May.”
Why couldn’t the show have started some of that intrigue 
earlier, closer to when Carell left the cast? The Grantland article was written in speculation of how the show could continue without him.
Now that it’s almost over and no one cares, the show might 
get more creative to spite us all.
Today’s question: Will you go see Maya Angelou speak?
65% YES
35% NO
90 TOTAL VOTESFriday’s question: Have you ever had the 
chickenpox? 
Facebook lies, and the rest of the Internet isn’t much bet-
ter.
For example, I found an interesting quote by Lord 
Rama today.
I won’t quote the whole thing here because it’s long and 
sounds like it was written by a 16-year-old girl, but it starts out, “Find a guy who calls you beautiful instead of hot, who calls you back when you hang up on him…”
Now, I’m not saying I don’t believe Lord Rama actually 
said that, but seeing as how he was the seventh incarnation of the Hindu preserver god Vishnu, and he legendarily lived before 5000 B.C.,  he probably didn’t know too much about telephones or modern American slang.
That’s just the tip of the iceberg as far as quotes falsely at-
tributed to famous people on the Internet go.
One of my friends on Facebook the other day posted 
some old chain email purporting to consist of Bill Cosby talk-ing about how lazy everyone is and how he’s 83 years old, and he’s so tired of having to pay taxes to support a bunch of straw men.
The quote itself didn’t piss me off — it was just another 
reiteration of a conservative philosophy that’s become more and more exaggerated as the ideological divide in our coun-
try grows larger and larger.
Whether it’s right to think that way is neither here nor 
there. What concerns me is this quote was attributed to Bill 
Cosby, reposted as such and presented as truth.
With a very minimal expenditure of Google-chakra, I was 
able to ﬁ  nd the true attribution in about ﬁ  ve seconds. Turns out a retired Republican state senator from Massachusetts named Robert Hall is the one who’s 83 or 76 and tired.
Bill Cosby is very much untired and in fact distanced him-
self almost two years ago from the “ugly views expressed” by Hall’s post. That changes things a little bit, doesn’t it?
When you’re reading something, your perception of it is 
altered imperceptibly by your impression of the author.
The way I read this quote when I thought it was said by 
a comedian whose humor is based on making funny faces and talking about Jell-O is a lot different from the way I read it once I realized it was written by an “Old Jarhead” whose blog also contains gems of wisdom like, “Islam — because even heart-less barbarians need religion.”
Let’s move past this example.Both of these quotes demon-
strate one of the more interesting dichotomies the Internet presents us with.
On the one hand, the Internet is 
an entity of enormous knowledge 
and truth potential. Just like I was able to ﬁ  nd the truth about that quote within seconds thanks to the magic of Google and Snopes, you can almost always ﬁ  nd the truth on the Internet if you dig long enough. (About facts, that is — I don’t recom-
mend trying to use the Internet as a path to enlightenment.)
The Internet has immense power to connect people and 
spread information. However, some of those people are 
dicks who hang out on 4chan.
They use the Internet to spread hilarious misattributions, 
ﬂ  at-out lies and other things that are more subtly untrue and much harder to detect because of that subtlety.
Wikipedia trolling is the best example I can think of this 
ﬁ  ctionalizing power the Internet innately possesses. People 
(including me because it’s fun, and I’m a dick) go on Wikipe-
dia and edit in false facts. Some of them are easy to catch — in high school, we used to edit the page for our hometown with obscenities about the poor quality of life there.
But some are harder to catch. And some, like the urban 
legend about Mr. Rogers the Marine sniper, become near-ubiquitously accepted parts of our realities without our even questioning their truth.
That is why , in this age of the Internet, where truth and 
lies do battle while traveling at a million miles an hour far above our heads in space, it is more important than ever to heed the words of Socrates: “The highest form of Human Ex-cellence is to question oneself and others.”

opinions@alligator.org MONDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 2013 § ALLIGATOR, 7
Last week in Student Senate, Swamp Party 
treasurer and Student Government Budget and Appropriations Committee chairman 
Joey Michaels was publicly asked to step down from one of those positions for the sake of the students.
Students have a right to support whoever 
they choose in the upcoming SG election without being afraid their organizations will lose money because of it. 
When the person in charge of distributing 
roughly $17 million also happens to have his 
name on every Facebook post, shirt and flier for 
the Swamp Party, that right disappears.
Michaels has made no effort to resign from 
either position and has yet to address this 
unethical situation, which could mean any of 
three things.
1) Joey Michaels may be completely ignorant 
of the situation he puts student organizations in when he tells them how they can spend their 
money while also telling everyone on campus 
who they should support in the election.
He may be so incredibly out of touch with the 
average student organization he does not see this 
blatant problem, and if that’s the case, he should 
either resign, or the Senate should relieve him of the responsibilities he is showing he cannot handle.
Student organizations deserve a budget 
chairman they can turn to, who actually understands their needs and concerns, not one so far removed he doesn’t see basics.
2) On the other hand, Michaels may understand 
the tight spot he puts students in, but he’s so hungry for resume lines he does not care about how uncomfortable he makes the students feel.
It is well known that SG positions are a 
springboard into Florida Blue Key, and maybe 
Michaels just isn’t willing to wait another 
semester for that coveted “tap” and wants to get it out of the way now.  
Students deserve better than a budget 
chairman who is only concerned with himself and his own selfish ambitions; if he won’t step down, the Senate should impeach him and put someone in charge who actually makes students a priority.
3) Then again, Joey Michaels goes to UF, so 
he’s probably a smart guy. This means he knows 
exactly what’s going on here.
In that case, he’s using 
this position for the sole purpose of intimidating 
student organizations into voting for his party.
Like any tyrannical leader, he’s using his 
power to hold the students’ money hostage in 
exchange for votes, and unfortunately for the 
students, it’s already working.
A student organization that, for obvious 
reasons, wants to remain nameless admitted they 
were afraid of the power Michaels held over the 
budget and, as a result, is not participating in the campaigning process.
But Joey Michaels is just one corrupt and 
uninformed man in a party full of hundreds more 
just like him.
Elliot Grasso is currently in the exact same 
situation, serving as the Swamp Party spokesman 
and as the auditor (treasurer) in the Inter-
Residence Hall Association, blatantly ignoring 
IRHA’s own rules against showing preference toward a political party and likely making other residence hall leaders afraid for their own funding.
Clearly, blurring the lines between ethical and 
unethical is not unique to Michaels and his fellow party members.
The Swamp Party knew who they were 
putting in charge of their thousands of dollars of unreported funding. 
They knew how it would be perceived. They knew the anxiety it would cause student 
organizations. 
They knew the effect it would have on free 
speech. 
They just didn’t care.The Swamp Party wants you to feel afraid to 
go to the polls. 
They want you to think that if you don’t 
support them, they will come after you.
Don’t give in to their oppression, don’t let UF 
SG become a pack of self-serving, self-righteous, 
underhanded Tammany Hall wannabes.
We are 50,000 Florida Gators, and we deserve 
better student representatives than Joey Michaels 
and those like him.

Speaking OutMost of us eat blindly . On a 
late Tuesday night, sitting in our college apartments 
with “Girls” on the laptop and hun-ger pangs setting in, the majority of 
us are not looking to make a com-
mentary on modern day commodity food culture. 
Dinner comes down to “Where 
do you want to eat?” and the in-
evitable reply, “I dunno. Where do 
you?”
But times are changing. 
Health food movements in recent 
years have already begun to increase transparency and force us to consid-er what makes up what we eat. 
The fact is, most of us have no 
idea where the food on our plates actually comes from and how it was produced. 
Many people are so far removed 
from the process of food production 
that they have little to no knowledge 
of the efforts required to harvest and transport these goods halfway around the world and into our shopping carts, much less the envi-ronmental and social implications. If you don’t know that a french fry comes from a tuber grown in the ground, it’s a good bet that the tons 
of fossil fuel it takes to produce, pro-
cess and refrigerate those potatoes isn’t crossing your mind either.
The average food item on a su-
permarket shelf in this country has traveled farther than the average family goes on a yearly vacation. But it’s not just the travel time — there are a myriad of fundamental prob-lems that come with our industrial-ized agricultural system. 
The mechanization of farming 
has increased yields tremendously but not without a cost: The introduc-tion of ecologically harmful synthet-ic fertilizers, pesticides and the use of monoculture and heavy irrigation has transformed farming into a cor -
porate production system and has uprooted us from familiarity and contact with our food.
Many activists call for the scaling down of our agricultural system and an emphasis on locally 
sourced goods and services. Local food movements in Gainesville are aplenty and growing fast. 
Many groups, such as Slow Food 
Gainesville, Grow Gainesville and Florida Organic Growers have dedi-cated followings and are represented every week at the downtown farm-er’s market, along with local farms 
in the area, including Swallowtail 
Farm, and Kurtz and Sons Dairy . 
Groups such as these are work-
ing tirelessly within the community to increase awareness and access to sustainable food. However, efforts pushing for a focus on local sources have yet to gain large-scale accep-tance and support and are still some-
what marginalized movements.
Recently , I went to a graduation 
dinner of a friend held at the Jones 
B-side, an offshoot of the popular Eastside eatery that specializes in sustainable, locally grown food. An acquaintance of mine was loudly surveying the menu, announcing that “this organic crap” was garbage 
and that he was “going to Checkers 
after this to get some real food.”
The apathy of our generation is 
a serious problem. To blithely know nothing about the way the world works and, furthermore, to rally be-hind simply not caring, is an excuse to not take on responsibility for our own lives and the choices we make. 
Local food is more than the cari-
cature of a seminal (and hilarious) “Portlandia” episode. It calls into the 
forefront the integrity of our nation-
al agricultural system and the level of involvement we have in how our food is produced. 
It would do us all good to start 
the thinking process and begin to confront the food on our plates. 
It is “food,” not the dying-out cry 
of “YOLO,” which should become 
the buzzword of our generation.

Many people might not know 
who helped discover the North 
Pole or when Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech. But Alachua County sixth- 
through 12-graders participating in 
the Santa Fe College Center of Excel-lence’s Brain Bowl county-regional competition did.
Three teams of five participants 
and two alternates faced off Sat-urday , answering questions about black history and culture. The Pre-cious Pearls, sponsored by the Mu 
Upsilon Omega Chapter of Alpha 
Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc., placed first, which means its members will compete in the state championship for a chance to win scholarships.
“It is about learning our history , 
but it is also about getting money to go to college and furthering your ed-ucation,” said Precious Pearls coach Sarah Richardson.
Every year, the Florida Education 
Fund hosts the annual competition to help expose students to African-American history and culture, said John Cowart, community liaison for the Santa Fe College Center of Excel-lence.
The teams were asked questions 
from the Black Heritage Trivia Game and from books like “The Color of Water” by James McBride.
Although the Great Achievers 
and Springs teams won’t move on, Harriet Stafford, director of the Cen-ter of Excellence at Santa Fe, said each participant deserved recogni-
tion for their efforts.
The Precious Pearls won the state 
championship last year. Now, the 
team is hoping for another win.
“We will begin practicing for 
state immediately because if we win state, we can get full scholarships,” said 16-year-old Amanda Tinker, team captain of the Precious Pearls 
and a junior at F.W. Buchholz High

Local residents have a new area to 
explore after a nature preserve south of 
Gainesville opened Saturday morning.
About 200 people gathered at the 
Barr Hammock Nature Preserve, located 
south of Lake Wauburg, to celebrate the 
opening of Alachua County’s newest na-ture area.
The preserve is about 5,700 acres, and 
Alachua County Forever, a land preser -
vation group, opened the north side of the property, about 1,500 acres, to the public.
Ramesh Buch, Alachua County For -
ever program manager, said he was ex-cited about the 200-person turnout.
“I think that this shows that this is 
a piece people had their eyes on since we’ve acquired it and have been sort of waiting for us — some patiently, some impatiently — to have it open and avail-able,” he said.
Alachua County Forever purchased 
the preserve in parts between 2006 and 2010 using grants from the North Amer -
ican Wetlands Conservation Act and  
Florida Communities Trust as well as 
donations from the original owners.
One of the parts was the 3,200-acre 
Levy Prairie Preserve, which was pur -
chased for $4 million. About 1,500 acres of it are now available to the public.
Buch said his organization plans to 
expand the preserve’s recreation area, which will include 25 additional miles of 
hiking and equestrian trails.
“It cost the people of Alachua County 
nothing,” said Mike Byerly , chair of the 
Alachua County Board of County Com-missioners.
Irma McLaughlin, a 66-year-old re-
tired county employee and outdoor enthusiast, said she looked forward to riding her bike and bird watching in the 
preserve when the weather is warmer.
“I’m hoping someday a whooping 
crane will come decide to visit here,” she 
said. “That would be great.”Preserve now open to public

With 40 seconds until race time, 
participants scurried to line up be-
hind a UF College of Medicine stu-dent who incurred brain damage in a car accident in June.
The Sunday morning 5K Race 
for Ray brought about 200 people and $3,000 to support Ray Brown, an army veteran who finished two years of medical school with the class of 2014 before his accident.
Before the starter’s pistol was fired, Philip Gilbo, 25, academic chairman of the College of Medicine class of 2014, prayed aloud and told Brown everyone came to support him on his new journey.
“It’s a way to show Ray , ‘Hey , 
we’re with you, and we’re with you on this journey,’” Gilbo said.
Brown, who turns 32 today, com-
pleted most of “the boot,” a loop around Lake Alice, in his wheelchair with his mother, brother, sister-in-law and physical therapist.
A cheering section welcomed 
Brown to the final stretch.With help from his physical ther -
apist, John Cagan, 42, Brown stood and used a walker to complete his race. The cheering got louder.
Brown was injured while com-
ing home from visiting a friend in Nashville, Tenn., said Ray Brown’s brother, Tom Brown, 33. He lost control of his car and collided with a semi truck.
Ray Brown has been home in St. 
Augustine with his family for about two weeks after months of treat-ment. He is working with speech, occupational and physical thera-pists.  
Tom Brown said his brother is 
improving at a good pace.
Kristy Brown, 30, Tom Brown’s 
wife, said the race was uplifting for her brother-in-law.
“It’s amazing the spirit of people 
when there’s a time of need,” she 
said.
She said strangers have donated 
money and commented on the blog, Pray for Ray, that was set up to pro-
vide updates.
Dr. Richard Brazell, 47, an obste-
trician and gynecologist at North Florida Regional Medical Center, was the first to pass the finish line. He didn’t know Ray Brown before the run, but he said this race is about hope.
Brazell said it’s typical of patients 
with critical injuries to feel isolated and alone.
Ray Brown said his favorite part 
about the race was all the people. Supporters sang “Happy Birthday” and signed the “Race-Day Registra-tion” sign, which went home with Ray Brown.

At street corners all over the county, cross-
ing guards stop traffic as they help school chil-
dren safely cross the road, and on Friday, as part of School Crossing Guard Appreciation Day, it was their day to be thanked.
At the Martin Luther King Jr. Multipurpose 
Recreation Center, located at 1028 NE 14th St., local crossing guards were honored during Alachua County’s sixth annual School Cross-ing Guard Appreciation Day Ceremony.
The ceremony included a catered break-
fast from Eastside High School’s culinary de-partment followed by an awards ceremony that honored more than 50 guards from the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office as well as 
Gainesville, High Springs and Waldo police 
departments.
During the ceremony, Alachua County 
Sheriff Sadie Darnell spoke to the crossing 
guards. She reflected on the importance of 
their work.
“We don’t take time to pause and recognize 
that they are the rare and precious music to the ears and lives of our children,” she said.
Gainesville Police Chief Tony Jones also ad-
dressed the crossing guards, saying they make a positive influence on children.
“It starts with you all,” he said. “Your job is 
so critical. You’re a role model for these kids.”
Julia Barlow, an ASO 
crossing guard, was named 
the Alachua County Cross-
ing Guard of the Year.  She received a plaque in her honor and will be automati-cally nominated for Cross-
ing Guard of the Year for 
the state of Florida.
Florida Department of 
Transportation representatives also honored Trevor Elliott, a crossing guard for Lawton M. 
Chiles Elementary School.
“I think it’s fabulous because as crossing 
guards, sometimes, we get taken for granted,” 
said Elliot, 61. “It takes a lot of dedication to get up and come to work and stand on the 
street corner, but we do it for the kids. It’s al-
ways nice to be needed, and the recognition 
keeps you going.”Crossing Guard Appreciation Day 
honors more than 50 workersj

Late in the first half, Ole Miss guard 
Marshall Henderson grabbed a pass from 
forward Jarvis Summers.
Seconds after Scottie Wilbekin began 
guarding Henderson, Braxton Ogbueze, who was sitting on the Gators bench at the time, ended up with the ball. 
Wilbekin forced Henderson to turn the 
ball over four times and took away open looks from him.
But even against Wilbekin, Hender -
son’s talent still shined through on Satur -
day night.
Henderson led the Southeastern Con-
ference with 19.3 points per game prior to Saturday’s matchup. He finished the game 
with 25 points on 8-of-15 shooting, one 
assist and one steal in 38 minutes on the court.
“Henderson made some shots to kind 
of dig into our lead a little bit,” coach Billy 
Donovan said.
“Overall, I thought Scottie did a good 
job defensively and our guys played pret-
ty well.”
Henderson’s high scoring night wasn’t 
enough for the Rebels. No. 4 Florida (18-2, 8-0 SEC) won 78-64 against No. 16 Ole Miss (17-4, 6-2 SEC) on Saturday in the O’Connell Center. 
Henderson’s game-high 25 points came 
on 7-of-11 shooting from behind the arc, 
making him the only Rebel to hit a three 
against the Gators. 
But Henderson’s success on the court 
did not result from a lack of coverage by 
UF. 
Of Henderson’s 12 shots during Wil-
bekin’s time on the floor, only three were 
open looks. 
“It was tough guarding him,” Wilbekin 
said.
“I was trying my best on defense, and 
he still got up and shot. I have respect for him that I didn’t have before the game, 
and he’s a good guy, too.”
Senior forward Erik Murphy added: 
“[Henderson is] going to get his points. 
He’s going to get his shots up. He’s go-ing to get to the free throw line, he’s really 
good at that. He’s crafty. We just wanted 
to limit his open shots, and I think we did a pretty good job of that.”
Wilbekin wasn’t the only one busy on 
defense Saturday night. 
Murphy, who had a strong night offen-
sively with a team-high 19 points on 7-of-8 shooting, was sound on the defensive end as well.
Murphy held Ole Miss forward Mur -
phy Holloway to 15 points on 5-of-16 shooting. 
Murphy didn’t allow the 6-foot-7 senior 
to take a single three-point shot.

Florida had shut out two opponents 
before facing Furman. 
UF made it three on Sunday. 
The Gators cruised to a 7-0 win 
against the Paladins, improving their 
record to 5-0.
UF came out firing in doubles, set-
ting the pace for the rest of match.
“We came out and played pretty 
well in the doubles,” coach Bryan Shel-ton said. “I thought we made some good adjustments today with how we 
attacked and looked to be really active. 
Whether we faked and stayed, wheth-er we poached, we were a little more decisive today in the doubles and that 
kind of set the tone for the day.”
Senior Billy Federhofer and fresh-
man Gordon Watson breezed past 
Alex Christ and Matt Browne at No. 1 doubles, giving Florida the early ad-
vantage in the match. Freshman Luke Johnson and junior 
Michael Alford clinched the doubles 
point with an 8-4 win over Furman’s 
Richard Casagrande and Jacob Behal. 
Johnson said it was vital for him 
and Alford to step up their play to give 
Florida the early lead.
“I knew it was close between mine 
and [Alford’s] court and [Bob van Overbeek] and [Stephane Piro’s], so it 
was actu-ally nice to 
serve out 
and get the 
win,” Johnson said. “It’s great for our momentum going into the singles.”
Piro, a junior, and the senior van 
Overbeek’s match was stopped after the doubles point was clinched, but they led 7-4. 
Piro used that momentum from 
doubles to give Florida a quick point after defeating Christ 6-1, 6-1 in only fifty minutes. UF blanks Furman in winWomen’S bASketbAll

Poor shooting and slow starts have plagued 
Florida during Southeastern Conference play . 
Freshman Christin Mercer helped change that, ending the Gators’ five-game losing streak in the process.
Mercer was inserted into the starting lineup 
for the fourth time this season and responded with her top performance. She scored a career-high 18 points and pulled down 11 rebounds as Florida (14-9, 3-6 SEC) cruised past Ala-bama 87-54 in the O’Connell Center. 
“I’ve been slacking on the aggressive part, 
so I tried to turn a new cheek,” Mercer said. 
During UF’s five-game skid, the Gators 
were troubled with poor first-half efforts. Flor -
ida fell behind by double-digits prior to half-time in each of the past four contests, deficits that proved too much to overcome.
Sunday , it was Mercer and the Gators who 
took command early in the game. 
Following a free throw by Jasmine Robin-
son on Alabama’s opening possession, UF re-sponded with an 11-0 run during the next 2:42. Mercer played an integral role, scoring 8 of her 18 points during the span. 
“[Mercer] really showed a lot of growth 
in our Georgia game,” coach Amanda Butler said. “We’ve really been challenging her to 
bring that consistent energy and drive. She’s 
been practicing really , really well, so it’s not surprising to see her play this well.” 
The Gators held the 
Crimson Tide to 19-of-74 shooting in the game. Ala-bama (12-10, 2-7 SEC) made just 10 of its 41 attempts in the first half. 
Meanwhile, the Gators 
benefitted from their stron-gest offensive performance during conference play . UF 
shot 58.3 percent in the contest, including con-necting on 6 of its 12 threes.
Junior Lily Svete led the Gators behind 
the arc, connecting on 4 of her 6 tries from the three-point line. 
“A very big win,” Butler said.“Not just

Florida senior Lauren Embree snagged 
her 99th career singles match victory against 
Baylor on Saturday, but winning was no easy 
feat.
The fifth-ranked college tennis player in the 
country found trouble in No. 16 Ema Burgic.
Embree finished the first set without much 
trouble from Burgic, sealing the win with a 
break in the final game and a 6-4 score.
Burgic retaliated with increased pressure 
and aggression against Embree on the court in the second set.
The Bears’ sophomore held serve in the be-
ginning, while Embree was caught in the re-ceiving end of Burgic’s power, falling behind 5-2.
Though Burgic’s short hits and sharp 
spikes near the net gave Embree some trouble, the Gators senior came back to win four con-secutive games and changed the score in her favor at 6-5.
“[Burgic] had a really good back hand 
and anything I gave her short there she kind of punished me and kept pushing me back,” Embree said. 
“The toughest thing for me was to try and 
stay up on the base line and not have her be so aggressive where I’m running so much.”
However, Burgic still held serve advantage 
and matched up score to make game point.
The two players fought back and forth for 
the point, but Burgic held on her game-point opportunity to force a tiebreaker.
Embree led Burgic 4-1, but the Baylor play-
er fought back to tie the score. 
Burgic broke through for a 7-6 win, hold-
ing serve and forcing a third set.
“I don’t like to lose,” Embree said.The two battled in a 10-point match that 
would clinch the overall win, and Embree stepped up to the challenge.
But they went back and forth again. Embree tallied three points, and Burgic fol-
lowed suit. Embree gained serve advantage and put up a 7-4 difference. 
Burgic rallied to close the gap, pulling 
within one point at 8-7. 
“You would have thought the team score 
was tied at 3-3 with the level of intensity in that final match,” coach Roland Thornqvist 
said. 
Embree sealed the win with two powerful 
shots near the net, and clinched the seventh 
point for the team’s 7-0 victory. 
“Anything can really happen when you 
just play 10 points,” Embree said. “I just kept fighting out there, and [Burgic] stayed tough, too.”
Thorn-
qvist added: “You have to give Bur -
gic a lot of credit, because there were four or five times when I thought she was going to go 
away and she found a way to battle back into 
the match.” 
In addition to grabbing her 99th win in sin-
gles on Saturday, Embree had a historic day 
in doubles. 
Embree paired up with junior Sofie Oyen, 
and the two defeated Baylor’s Kiah Generette 
and Burgic 8-5 to give the senior her 100th ca-reer doubles victory.
The win also clinched the doubles point for 
the Gators.
“Lauren is just the best in the business 
when it comes to close matches at the end and 
today was no different,” Thornqvist said. 
“She has the heart of a warrior.”

Senior earns 99th career singles victory, 100th doubles win
UF W omen’s T ennis“They’re tough, no question,” Murphy said.
“But every game we just try to play as hard 
as we can.”
Saturday’s 14-point win is the closest contest 
the Gators have played against an SEC foe this 
season.
Florida’s aver -
age margin of victory in conference play 
dropped from 28.3 to 26.5 with the victory against Ole Miss.
UF is averaging a 22.9-point margin of vic-
tory this season, which ranks first nationally.
The win extended the Gators’ winning streak to 10 games, the longest streak since the 2008-09 season.
UF remains the only unbeaten team in SEC 
play.
“I think [the Gators] will contend for the na-
tional championship,” Henderson said.
“We have seen how they have been blowing 
people out. They execute perfectly. They make 
open shots and good teams make open shots. 
And then they make tough shots.
“They’re a really good team. That’s why 
they’re ranked No. 4 and will probably move 
up. I see them being No. 1 in the country by the 
end of the season.”

Building off of Piro’s perfor -
mance, Federhofer earned a vic-tory as well with a 6-0, 6-2 win at No. 5 singles. 
Watson clinched the victory for 
the Gators after defeating Browne 6-1, 6-3. 
“We talk all the time about ex-
ecuting plays,” Shelton said. “For us, we were able to execute more often today. I felt like our guys 
were playing more offensively 
and looking to set up points based on their strengths. I was happy to see us finish at the net multiple times in multiple matches today.”
Florida will travel to Tallahas-
see to play Florida State on Satur -
day in the latter school’s first road match of the season. 
“The more we are able to 
make the plays and execute, the better we’re going to be, and you want to be able to do it in the 
matches,” Shelton said. “Hope-
fully, it’ll help us as we prepare for Florida State this coming week.”

TRACK AND FIELD
GORDON STREISAND

Steady improvement and solid outings seem to be themes 
for the Gators track and field team this season.
Personal bests fueled Florida to one of its most complete 
performances of the season at the Frank Sevigne Husker Invi-
tational in Lincoln, Neb.
Sophomore sprinter Dedric Dukes, who was named the in-
vitational MVP , had the most impressive race. Dukes, a natural outdoor runner, set a Husker Invitational record in the 200 me-ters with a time of 20.95, breaking the previous record of 20.96.
“I’m very proud of Dedric and his performances this week-
end,” coach Mike Holloway said. “He executed two good races this weekend, and he’s just getting started. He’s continuing to become accustomed to running indoors, but it’s foreign to him.”
Youth continues to be the driving force 
behind the Gators’ consistent success. Fresh-men sprinters Arman Hall and Shayla Sand-
ers each set personal bests this weekend. 
Hall set his in the 400 meters while Sanders 
set hers in both the 60 and 200 meters.
“I’m very proud of Arman and Shayla 
but not surprised,” Holloway said. “They’re 
never satisfied, and it’s that desire to stay hungry that will keep them focused heading into championship season.”
Despite its youth presence, Florida’s upperclassmen put on 
a solid performance. 
Juniors Lorraine Graham  and Ciarra Brewer had standout 
performances for the Gators during the weekend. Graham and Brewer placed second and third in the long jump, respective-ly.
For freshman sprinter Kyra Jefferson, the upperclassmen 
have been a beacon for what to expect at college meets.
“They’ve helped me with some of the ins and outs about 
meets and tracks and how it’s going to be when we actually go,” Jefferson said last week.
Florida managed to win three events this weekend. Dukes 
took the 200 meters, Hall won the 400 meters, and sophomore jumper Ciarra Brewer earned the title in the triple jump.
“I’m very proud of the team as a whole,” Holloway said. 
“We had lots of personal records and season bests this week-end. We just have to keep remembering how we got to this point. We’re getting into the championship portion of our sea-
son and with hard work and a lot of effort, those efforts will 
lead us where we want to go.”Gators achieve three personal bests during Husker Invite

convincing fashion in a way this 
team knows that they’re capable of winning games.” 
Florida led 43-23 at halftime fol-
lowing a 13-0 run to end the first 
half. 
After struggling to limit the 
SEC’s top three-point shooter three 
days prior — Missouri’s Morgan Eye connected on four threes in a 69-64 victory — the Gators regrouped to slow another of the conference’s top three point threats. 
Shafontaye Myers, whose 27 
threes in conference play equaled Florida’s team total, was held to 1-of-
11 shooting from the three-point line 
and finished with just five points. 
“We did a great job on defense,” 
Butler said. “A great victory for us to 
have held them defensively the way that we did because they challenge you in a lot of ways.”
After finishing January just 2-6, 
Mercer said the team made a con-certed effort to bring a changed out-look into February . The results paid off on both ends of the floor. 
“We had a changed mindset,” 
Mercer said. “I honestly came out their with the mindset that we were the No. 1-ranked team and played ball.”
Butler hopes the renewed mind-
set and better result will be a catalyst for improved play in the final month of the season. Three of UF’s seven remaining opponents are ranked. 
“We wanted to snap the losing 
streak however we could,” Butler said. “For it to look like this is cer -
tainly best-case scenario. I think we 
played one of our most complete 
ball games.”

Coach Rhonda Faehn used three 
all-around gymnasts against Arkan-
sas to help Florida register its highest 
balance beam and floor marks of the 
season. 
Freshman Bridget Sloan and All-
Americans Ashanee Dickerson and 
Marissa King were featured in each 
of the four events on Friday.
The trio helped the Gators post 
season-high scores of 49.45 on beam and 49.275 on floor.
The season-high scores on the 
beam and floor helped No. 1 Flori-da defeat No. 22 Arkansas 197.575-196.175 at the Barnhill Arena in Fay-
etteville, Ark. 
Prior to their matchup with the 
Razorbacks, the Gators ranked fourth 
in the NCAA in balance beam and seventh in floor with average scores 
of 49.056 and 49.169, respectively.
With Dickerson and Sloan com-
peting together for a second consec-utive week, Florida improved both 
event scores. 
Against Auburn on Jan. 25 in the 
O’Connell Center, UF improved its beam score by .10 and floor by .025 
from its meet against Missouri on 
Jan. 18. 
With Dickerson and Sloan com-
peting all-around again against Ar -
kansas, that improvement nearly 
doubled with scores of .175 and .050. 
Injuries to Kytra Hunter (foot) 
and Alaina Johnson (sore back) have 
proven challenging for Florida’s 
depth early. 
Despite having an injury, Hunter 
still competed on Friday. However, the normal all-around competitor was limited to just the bars. 
But the lineup combinations put 
forth by Faehn have helped UF battle through with an injury-ridden ros-
ter. 
“No matter what is thrown at 
them, no matter what the circum-stances, no matter what the lineup, 
everyone is capable of going out and doing a phenomenal job,” Faehn 
said. 
Florida’s next five opponents 
will be No. 5 Alabama, No. 8 Geor -
gia, No. 16 Kentucky, No. 10 Min-
nesota and No. 9 Utah. Last season, the Gators held a 6-1 record against those teams. 
If the Gators expect to contend for 
a national title again this year, they’ll have to carry the same energy used to beat the Razorbacks. 
“Ashanee had our word of the 
meet, which was passion,” Sloan said. “We really showed how much passion we had for each other and for the team.”
