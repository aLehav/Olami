A 37-year-old man was shot and killed Sunday 
morning at an apartment complex off of Southwest 
20th Avenue, and the suspect is still missing.
At about 6 a.m., ofﬁ  cers responded to multiple 
reports of a shooting at Southern Pines Apartments, at 4125 SW 17th Place.
Samuel Hamilton was found dead in an apart-
ment in the complex with a gunshot wound in his head. Multiple witnesses identiﬁ  ed the shooter as Larry Whitehead Jr., 26.
According to a Gainesville Police Department 
news release, an investigation showed that White-head forced his way into the apartment, argued with Hamilton and shot him. Because a K-9 unit search of the area yielded no results, police believe Whitehead 
left in a car. 
GPD spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben 
Tobias said police think the two men knew each other. 
“At least they had a mutual 
female friend. That may be what this was over,” Tobias said. “[Whitehead] had a mission to go after this guy. It’s a horrible case, but it’s a very simple case.”
Whitehead has not yet been located, and the 
weapon used has not been found, according to the release.Suspect missing after Sunday killingALEXA VOLLAND

It only took two words to 
put the nation in a frenzy: not 
guilty.
After three weeks of testimo-
ny in Sanford, a jury of six wom-en found George Zimmerman not guilty of the second-degree murder and manslaughter of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.
Martin’s death and Saturday 
night’s verdict have revived the racial proﬁ  ling debate and sparked protests all over the country — and in Gainesville, 
too.
On Monday, 
UF Dream De-fenders and other commu-nity organiza-tions marched from the Bo 
Diddley Com-munity Plaza 
to the U.S. Department of Justice Gainesville ﬁ  eld ofﬁ  ce to de-mand justice for Martin. About 50 people attended the march.
Jeremiah Tattersall, 27, who 
has worked with UF Dream De-fenders and UF Students for a Democratic Society, said he was shocked when he heard the ver-dict.
“It really just took the wind 
out of us,” he said.
Tattersall said the continued 
tragedy is that Martin is not the ﬁ  rst or last man to die because of cultural racism. The current laws — including “stand your ground” — convicted Martin of his own murder, he said, and these laws need to change.
“Today is about taking that 
angst and raw emotion and try-ing to direct it to something meaningful and lasting for change for the better,” Tattersall said about the march.
The Gainesville protesters 
joined thousands of people na-tionwide in expressing their dis-satisfaction with the verdict. 
Celebrities like Miley Cyrus, 
John Cusack and Judy Blume took to Twitter. Beyonce stopped a concert to hold a moment of silence for Martin. President Barack Obama released a state-ment saying the United States is a nation of laws, and the jury had spoken.
Chrisley Carpio, lead orga-
nizer for UF Students for a Dem-ocratic Society, experienced the public’s reaction ﬁ  rsthand. She heard the verdict while standing in a designated area for protest-ers outside the Sanford court-house.
“People burst into tears. There 
was outrage,” said the 21-year-old UF history senior. “But there was more grief than anything else.”

UF students no longer have to call the Student Health 
Care Center to schedule appointments. Patients can now 
schedule, cancel and view appointments online through the new Student Health Care Center Web Portal, said spokes-woman Catherine Seemann.
“It’s been something that students have requested for a long time,” she said. “We’ve ﬁ  nally been able to get out a test version.”
Students can still call and make appointments if they pre-
fer. If a student calls to make an appointment, he or she can usually be seen that same day, Seemann said. But with on-line scheduling, students usually cannot get an appointment the same day, she said, so it is best to call ﬁ  rst.
UF history senior Bubba Silcox, 20, said the ease of the new 
system means he’s more likely to make an appointment.
“It’d be simpler, easier and quicker,” he said.Seemann said a soft launch of a pilot version of the portal 
started July 1. The web portal can be accessed at www.shcc.uﬂ  .edu/appointments.
“We’re hoping that it enables students to ﬁ  t in health care 
into their lives more easily by ﬁ  nding an appointment time that works for them,” Seemann said.UF Student Health Care Center opens online appointment booking

A piece of city woodlands 
may soon be up for sale, but for 
residents and city leaders, reaching an agreement about the issue has been no walk in the park. 
The Gainesville City Commission 
is considering designating about 5  acres of Loblolly Woods Nature Park as surplus land so a private individual may buy it.
The public parkland would be 
sold to Nathan Collier, owner of The Collier Companies, for about $1 million.
The commission previously 
voted 4-3 to move forward with opening the property to public bid. 
Although selling the land would 
mean reducing the size of Loblolly Woods, City Commissioner Thomas Hawkins said the sale would be a wise decision.
“I think it’s a net win for people 
that live in Gainesville,” he said. “It would mean a tremendous amount of revenue for the city to invest back into the land.”
However, he said, no final 
decision has been made, and the commission voted to get more information before negotiating details.
“We’re considering all 
viewpoints in making a decision,” Hawkins said. “People’s input matter.”
So far, Hawkins said, most of 
the feedback about the proposed purchase has been passionately for or against it.
Melissa Elliott, media contact 
for  the local group Save Loblolly Woods, said if the commission agrees to declare the land surplus and allow the sale, it could start an unhealthy trend. 
“The impact is that it would set 
a precedent for the entire state of Florida that the city will sell off any land that’s set aside for parkland to a private individual just because he wants it, “ she said. “It would throw up a road map for other developers on how to develop and buy parkland.”
Kelli Brew, co-founder of Green 
House of the Gainesville Catholic Worker, said many residents disagree with declaring the land surplus.
“A number of Gainesville 
citizens feel that they have acted hastily and wrongly in deciding to designate it as surplus based on a wealthy individual’s desire to buy it for himself,” Brew said.  “I think it’s a shame — on them, the city and the buyer.”
Brew said that while she 
appreciates the commission’s effort to do the right thing, selling one piece of land to get revenue to buy another is unethical.
“This land was protected 
because it was valuable to the city beyond its price,” she said. “What other land might be considered desirable to a private citizen who has the means to offer a huge price?”
The commission will meet again 
to decide on the issue in August.

from the protesting area.
“They prevented the commu-
nity from coming together,” she said.
Carpio said she was devastated 
by the outcome and was anticipat-ing Zimmerman being convicted.
Despite the trial’s results, 
19-year-old Gainesville resident Billy Hill said he still has faith in the justice system. He said Zim-merman will “live with this for the rest of his life.”
Jesse Smith, a 19-year-old 
Florida State University sociology sophomore and Gainesville resi-dent, said she was not surprised by the verdict.
“My whole family cried,“ Smith 
said.
Smith said she came to Mon-
day’s march to help evoke change.
“We’re the ones living in an un-
just world,” she said, “and if we don’t stand up to it, nothing’s go-ing to happen.”4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 16, 2013

An education at UF is just as good as going to an Ivy League 
school, according to one website’s college guide.
The guide, called “4 Top Colleges Just As Great As the Ivy 
League Schools” and written by Justin Douglas for PolicyMic, 
looked at the cost of tuition, freshmen retention rates and grad-uation rates as criteria. California Polytechnic State University, the State University of New York at Stony Brook and the Uni-versity of Virginia joined UF on the list. 
Douglas wrote in an email that his intention was for stu-
dents and their parents “to consider public universities as great schools.”
He also said public universities typically offer greater sup-
port for students from diverse racial and class backgrounds. 
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said university officials were 
proud the school was included in the list.
“The bottom line is we absolutely believe that is correct,” 
Sikes said. “We have a great program and provide a great value to our students.”
Logan Goede, a 17-year-old business administration fresh-
man, said he has only been a student at UF for a week, but he applied believing it was the best school in Florida. 
“It just is the best,” Goede said. “Everybody knows it.”UF ‘just as great’

Caraline Stephens said having a 
baby  was going to be fun.
Her husband Patrick Duke said it 
was going to be an adventure.
But four months after baby Chloe 
joined the family in September, Ste-
phens, a 25-year-old UF mass com-munication graduate student, said she still wasn’t sure what she owed UF Health Shands Hospital for her delivery.
She was tired and distracted in 
the beginning, but as Chloe’s feed-ing and sleeping habits became more regular, Stephens said she be-came more aware of the bills.
According to an article from The 
New York Times, the average cost for a hospital delivery in America is more expensive than it would be anywhere else in the world. A stan-dard delivery averages $9,775. 
In Florida, the figures are close 
to this national average. The low-est statewide average for a standard hospital delivery is $9,008, accord-ing to the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration   ’s website. 
Rossana Passaniti, a UF Health 
spokeswoman, said the average hos-pital bill is about $11,000 for a stan-
dard delivery at UF Health Shands Hospital.
She said about 4 percent of UF 
Health patients are not covered by commercial insurance or Medicaid. 
For patients with insurance, bill-
ing can be a lengthy process. 
“It’s really confusing how you 
get charged,” Stephens said. “Ev-erything ends up being billed sepa-rately. The doctor visits are separate. The delivery and hospital stay are separate. Then, the pediatrician who sees your baby after delivery is a dif-ferent bill.”
Stephens and her husband paid 
about $1,200 in out-of-pocket ex-penses by the time they received all of the bills. It was manageable, she said, but sometimes she wondered if she should have brought her own Motrin to the delivery room.
Kristen Phillips, co-owner of 
the Birth & Wellness Center of Gainesville, said birth in the United States is probably more expensive because hospitals itemize every ser-vice. 
 “In a hospital setting, you get 
itemized for the toilet paper you 
use,” Phillips said.
  After she found out about the 
high costs of birth and high frequen-
cy of cesarean sections at hospitals, Gainesville resident Kerri Audette said she decided to give birth to her first child at home with the help of midwives.   Audette, 29, said her insurance 
covers the method but raises her deductible. The additional cost is worth it to her, she said, but she un-derstands the confusion birth costs can cause.

Plans are underway for the design of a new 
bike and pedestrian trail that would connect 
Southwest Archer Road to Southwest 34th Street through the UF campus.
The project, called the Cross Campus 
Greenway, is funded and designed by the Florida Department of Transportation, said Linda Dixon, the associate director at UF Fa-cilities Planning & Construction. It has an es-timated total cost of about $2.2 million, and construction companies will begin bidding August 2014.
The two-mile project is expected to extend 
from the UF Hilton on 34th Street following Hull Road and Mowry Drive, crossing Gale Lemerand Drive and Newell Drive and con-necting to Southwest Archer Road near UF Health, Dixon said.
“It will help us really in a lot of our sustain-
ability goals and in encouraging people to bi-cycle and walk,” Dixon said. “You know how hard it is to park and drive around campus, so people really are relying on biking and walk-ing.”
Myrna Widmer, a project manager of Dis-
trict Two of the Florida Department of Trans-portation, said the trail is primarily an “en-hancement project.”
Widmer said the trail’s design should be 
completed by April 2014 and is about 60 per-cent complete, but the final plans, as well as total budget, have not been cemented. 
Most of the trail will be made of asphalt and concrete, and emergency phone stations and lighting will be installed along the trail, Widmer said.
Gina Buscher, a spokeswoman for the De-
partment of Transportation, said no scooters would be allowed on the path. The project was originally on the UF Campus Master Plan in 2005 and was also on a list of recommended projects as a part of a larger cross-county bi-cycle facility being constructed from the city of Archer to Hawthorne, Dixon said.
However, construction is already under 
way on a small section of the trail near the Chemical Engineering Building, said Marlie Sanderson, the director of transportation plan-ning at the North Central Florida Regional Planning Council. Other segments of the trail will be funded separately and will see con-struction in 2015.
Dixon said the trail will connect campus 
areas that are densely populated and places like parking lots and the hospital area, which receive heavy foot traffic.
“Out on Hull Road ... there is a bit of a 
sidewalk and a very skinny asphalt path with some paved shoulders,” Dixon said, “but re-ally, they’re not good facilities.”

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgFriday’s question: Do you think Broward 
needed renovations?Today’s question: Do you agree with the Zimmerman 
verdict?Bill should eliminate agricultural subsidies
Though lawmakers in Washington argue about how 
best to manage the agriculture industry, it seems the best way for them to manage it would be to not 
manage it at all. Agricultural subsidies have created a drag on our economy, encouraged poor farming practic-es and have given politicians an excuse to try and imple-ment tax penalties on food items they deem unhealthy.
Any person in favor of continuing agricultural sub-
sidies is, in essence, in favor of massive government handouts to wealthy farm owners.  According to the Environmental Working Group Farm Subsidies website, the federal government has spent $292.5 billion on farm subsidies from 1995 to 2012, and $84.4 billion was speciﬁ  -cally for corn farmers.
Corn farmers are the biggest beneﬁ  ciaries of corpo-
rate welfare in the agriculture industry, and this explains why products made with high-fructose corn syrup are so inexpensive. These massive government handouts to corn farmers have enabled them to overproduce and sell their products at an artiﬁ  cially low price. Products con-taining high amounts of high-fructose corn syrup have been linked to diabetes and obesity, and their low prices have made these products readily available to us all.
Yet the same government that dishes out money 
hand-over-foot to corn farmers now feels that we are all becoming too fat and unhealthy due to our consumption of products containing high-fructose corn syrup. In fact, Richard F. Daines, the former commissioner of the New York State Department of Health, urged New York to tax soft drinks in order to help ﬁ  ght obesity and unhealthy lifestyles. But wouldn’t the obvious answer to curbing obesity be to stop subsidizing the farmers who produce unhealthy food products?
Subsidies have also promoted poor farming practices. 
Some of these practices include overuse of marginal farm-land, overproduction and negligent cost-control proce-dures. Farmers who receive these massive subsidies are less likely to use effective cost-control measures because they know the federal government will cover their losses. For some strange reason it seems the public is OK with bailouts for wealthy farm own-ers but not wealthy bankers — despite both of these measures being one and the same.
Many people seem to oppose 
the idea of ending all subsidiza-tion of the agriculture industry for fear of food shortages and putting people out of work, but the actual consequences of such 
measures yield results contrary to common misconcep-tion. The actual results are more resilient farming prac-tices in the long run.
For example, in 1984, New Zealand ended all farm 
subsidies and still managed to have a vibrant farming industry. Although there were rough spots and many farmers went out of business, the industry survived and many farmers in New Zealand today feel they are better off without subsidies. Dean Kleckner, the former presi-dent of the American Farm Bureau, has stated that he “never met a farmer who wanted to go back to subsidies” in a New York Times op-ed regarding farm subsidies in New Zealand.
Using taxpayer money to prop up private business of 
any sort is a triumph for crony capitalism and a complete drag on our economy. Imagine if the billions of dollars used to encourage wasteful farming practices were not taken in the ﬁ  rst place. That would mean billions of dol-lars spent by consumers in industries of their choosing, creating jobs and spurring our economy in the process. And even if the money were not spent, savings for large investment projects would increase and interest rates would fall due to inﬂ  ated bank reserves.     
The farm bill is nothing more than politicians argu-
ing over how to best squander taxpayer money, bailout faulty business and thwart possible economic growth. The United States should follow the New Zealand model for agricultural subsidies by stopping them completely.

 Is our state a model 
for bad governance?
For many, hearing the Zimmerman verdict was a sobering 
slap in the face. When Zimmerman — a clearly unstable and maybe even sociopathic man who killed a kid — is 
allowed to walk our streets as a free man, you know something is very, very wrong.
Zimmerman’s case isn’t the ﬁ  rst in Florida to garner national 
attention only to make us look like fools. The Casey Anthony trial in 2011, with its shocking “not guilty” verdict, caused many to really wonder whether the justice system in the United States is broken.
Perhaps the justice system as a whole is not broken, though. 
Maybe it’s just a Florida thing.
Has Florida become the joke of the nation? Florida’s follies 
don’t end in the courtroom.
Earlier this year, the Florida legislature and Gov. Rick Scott 
approved an insane ban on bongs. Just imagine the view of real-ity they must have in order to spend as much effort as they did in passing such utterly useless legislation.
If that isn’t enough to convince you how out of touch the 
folks in Tallahassee are with reality, then it might surprise you to hear that computers in the state have been banned. Earlier this month, in an attempt to ban slot games and Internet cafes, Scott and the Florida legislature accidentally banned all computers.
This state has problems. Society is riddled with them, yet the 
state thinks it’s a better allocation of time and tax dollars to wor-ry about pot and slot games. Meanwhile, true dangers to society like Zimmerman are given a free pass.
While our afﬂ  ictions aren’t all equal in source or solution, we 
can at least agree there are many ways in which the state is doing an awful job and sometimes even making things worse.
Fortunately, the people have a lot of power — at least in prin-
ciple. Every resident has a role to play in both the creation of problems and ﬁ  nding solutions to those problems.
How can we ﬁ  x Florida? The ﬁ  rst step is to inform ourselves 
about what’s going on. The next step is to learn about the ap-propriate solutions to the societal problems we perceive. The last step is to actually put the solutions into action.
The Internet helps us by making these steps easier to follow 
than ever. Commit to informing yourself every day. It is frus-trating and exhausting to hear about the problems we face, but they’re bound only to worsen if we plug our ears.
Then, inform yourself about the ideas people have about ﬁ  x-
ing the problems. While there are disagreements among intel-ligent people, we can agree that not thinking and just continuing down the road we’re already on is not what we want. An edu-cated population debating the issues is far more desirable than a sleeping population.
The last step is probably the trickiest. Sometimes good solu-
tions arise from novel ideas, like taking the initiative to start a group. Sometimes protesting and having your voice heard is the solution.
If nothing else, make sure to always cast a protest vote: Vote 
only for people who agree with what you think the role of the state should be.

With Zimmerman’s acquittal came 
shock, rage and celebration. Ac-tivity spiked across social media 
as everyone weighed in on whether justice was served. Friends turned on each other, relatives engaged in feuds, and others lashed out against complete strangers in fury.
Regardless of what people think trans-
pired on the fateful Feb. 26, 2012 night, jus-
tice was served in some degree.
The justice served was not in relation 
to Zimmerman or Trayvon Martin. It was not justice in relation to how media outlets swayed their audiences. The justice served lies in how Florida’s justice system, for the second time — the ﬁ  rst being the Casey An-thony trial — worked as it was supposed to.
I believe Zimmerman deserved punish-
ment for provoking the ﬁ  ght that led to Mar-tin’s death by following him after a police dispatcher instructed Zimmerman not to. I believe Anthony murdered her child.
I also believe that the prosecution in both 
cases was not able to prove Anthony or Zimmerman’s guilt beyond any reasonable doubt to an unbiased jury.
Defendants are presumed innocent until 
proven guilty. That’s one of the most basic tenets of our justice system. Verdicts are not delivered as “guilty” or “innocent.” Ver-dicts are read as “guilty” or “not guilty.” The bur-den of proof falls upon prosecu-tors. The defense isn’t required to prove innocence. Zimmerman’s at-torneys knew and 
used this, just as Anthony’s did.
Part of why the burden of proof fell ex-
clusively to the prosecution in this case was because of the terribly worded and horri-bly conceived “stand your ground” law, in which the primary imperative to ﬂ  ee poten-tially dangerous situations if possible to do so safely is removed.
As The Wall Street Journal reported: “De-
fense attorney Mark O’Mara urged jurors not to make assumptions in a case riddled with uncertainties. ‘You can’t ﬁ  ll in the gaps,’ he told them. ‘You can’t connect the dots for the state attorney’s ofﬁ  ce.’” 
In short, because of the laws in effect, and 
the lack of undisputed evidence, an acquittal was pretty much the only verdict that could be fairly reached when “fairly” applies to the functions of the legal system.

As gray clouds rolled over 
Flavet Field, eager concert-go-
ers crowded in front of the band shell for Swampfest, hoping the weather would hold.But it didn’t, and Matt and 
Kim never played.
Rhythm-and-blues group 
AHMIR opened the show with-out incident. 
By the time Cults came on, 
people stood shoulder to shoul-der, swatting at bugs and wip-ing sweat from their necks.
At 8:45 p.m., a Swampfest 
representative announced that Matt and Kim would be post-poned until at least 30 minutes after the most recent lightning strike.
Some people left, but others 
stuck it out. As it began to rain, and then pour, people started to seek shelter in their cars, under umbrellas and under tents.
“Some creative people went 
as far as to take the cardboard trash bins and make a make-shift shelter,” said 21-year-old UF mechanical and aerospace engineering senior Brandon Chandra.
University ofﬁ  cials and po-
lice canceled the concert for safety reasons at about 9:30 p.m., Student Government Productions Chairman Daniel Levin said.
UF biology junior Michael 
Bank, 20, traveled from Boca Raton to see Matt and Kim.
“I’m grateful that they tried 
to bring Matt and Kim, but at the same time it was kind of ir-responsible to do it in the sum-mer,” he said. “Everyone knows there are frequent thunder-storms, but ... that’s just part of putting on an outdoor concert.”
At about 9:45 p.m., Matt and 
Kim offered a meet-and-greet for those who waited in the rain. 
“They really wanted the fans 
to know that it wasn’t their fault that they couldn’t play,” Levin said. “They were really bummed.”
Matt and Kim are still being 
paid in full. 
SGP would not disclose the 
amount.8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 16, 2013

Miss Florida is a Gator — 
again.
Myrrhanda Jones, a 20-year-
old UF telecommunication ju-
nior and UF Delta Delta Delta sorority sister, won the Miss Florida Scholarship Pageant Saturday night. 
She was crowned by Miss 
Florida 2012, Laura McKeeman, who graduated from UF. Jones will compete for the Miss Amer-ica title in September.
“I’m so proud to represent 
the Gator Nation,” she said.
She went to Miss Florida this 
year as Miss Palm Coast  and competed against 46 other wom-en from all over the state. The contestants competed in four categories: private interviews, swimwear, evening gowns and talent performances. 
Jones wore a black jersey-knit 
gown with minimal rhinestones chosen by her dad.
“It was the image I wanted 
to portray for myself for Miss Florida,” she said.
Delta Delta Delta member 
and UF political science junior Kelsey Torgerson, 20, said it’s an honor to be Jones’ sister.
“We’re just so proud of her 
and all of the positive images she’s going to bring to the state,” she said.
Jones started participating in 
pageants in 2009, so she could perform baton twirling on stage and potentially win scholarship money. 
Last week that dream was re-
alized when she won a prelimi-nary talent award and $21,300 by the end of the week.
“It meant the world to me 
that I ﬁ  nally had won a talent award,” she said. “At that mo-ment, I didn’t care about what happened on Saturday. I didn’t care about ﬁ  nals any more.”
Jones also won the communi-
ty service-based Quality of Life Award for her work with Com-fort For Kids Inc., the nonproﬁ  t she founded.
When she was 12, Jones was 
in an accident that took the life of her younger sister, whose favorite stuffed animal was a monkey named Clarice.
“I started passing out stuffed 
animal monkeys to get through my grieving process,” she said. 
In the pageant, each con-
testant was required to have a platform — an issue in America she cares about and wants to address. Jones’ was Comfort For Kids Inc.
She never lost sight of that 
mission.
Saturday night, the compe-
tition narrowed down to Jones and Kalen Dennis, who was Miss River City 2013.
“I was so at peace in that mo-
ment, and then they said, ‘And the ﬁ  rst runner-up is Miss Riv-er City,’” Jones said. “My ﬁ  rst thought was ‘Thank you, Jesus.’ I was left on this earth for a very good reason, and I feel like I’m ﬁ  nally doing what I’m supposed to be doing.”
Jones said her goal for the 
year as Miss Florida is to recruit sponsors for the Miss America Organization and to raise aware-ness about the Everglades.UF junior awarded

State Rep. Keith Perry will host a 
town hall meeting at the Millhopper 
Branch Library, 3145 NW 43rd St., Thursday at 5 p.m.
At the meeting, which is the first 
of a series, Perry said he will give an overview of what happened during the spring legislative session, high-lighting changes that will affect UF as well as the city. The meeting will also include time for questions from residents, he said.
The event is important for stay-
ing in touch with constituents, Perry said.
“It really is helpful for me because 
we all get into our own world, our own professions,” he said.
However, he said students typi-
cally haven’t shown up at similar events in the past.
“Typically, we haven’t had stu-
dents at them,” he said. “A couple high school students last year but no college students.”
He may schedule a town hall 
meeting on campus in the future.
Caroline Anderson, Perry’s dis-
trict secretary, agreed that while the town halls are “helpful for meeting people where they’re at,” they don’t always reach students.
She said Perry is trying to speak at 
more student-friendly venues.
He spoke at Santa Fe College af-
ter the legislative session ended, she said, and a UF student intern is cur-rently working to strengthen student relations at UF.
“We are doing things to go to stu-
dents instead of expecting them to go to us,” she said. “[Perry] does really want to go and reach out to the stu-dents.”Perry to host public forumsLOCAL

Fourteen-year-old Earl Gardner spent his Sun-
day morning learning the ins and outs of a fire 
truck.
“Does that thing move?” Gardner asked, 
pointing to the ladder on top of the truck.
“Yes, it does, actually,” answered Edward Ev-
ans, a driver operator for Gainesville Fire Rescue.
Evans pointed to the top of the truck.  “That right there oscillates ... and we can con-
trol that from right there,” he said.
Gardner gazed at the ceiling as if he were 
imagining the ladder at full extension.
“It’s fun,” Evans said with a grin.Gardner was one of 42 children headed for 
Camp Amigo, a camp for North Central Florida burn survivors between the ages of 6 and 18.
Some of the children, like Gardner, stopped at 
Fire Station 2 on Southwest Archer Road on Sun-day morning to await a charter bus that would carry them to their destination: the Billy Jo Rish State Park in the panhandle.
Joyce Welch, the Gainesville coordinator for 
Camp Amigo, said the camp experience builds confidence and self-esteem in the children.
“They get a chance to see other kids that have 
been burned,” Welch said. “It’s just a real eye-opener for them.”
Gardner, who was burned as a first grader in 
2007, has attended Camp Amigo for the past four years.
He said he’s kept in contact with three friends 
since last year’s camp and is excited to see them.
The camp provides a place to spend time with 
other children who have been through similar situations, said Tracey Higdon, the president of Gainesville Professional Firefighters International Association of Fire Fighters Local 2157.
“It’s nice to see something positive come from 
something that can be so traumatic,” he said. “Some of these kids have scars, and when you go to a regular school, sometimes kids are mean. And for this week, they don’t have to worry about that.”Child burn victims head to camp

 I  remember the worst night in All-Star 
Game history well.
  I tuned in to the 2002 contest, excited 
to see six of my favorite Yankees play, in-cluding the entire New York inﬁ  eld (which blew my 9-year-old mind).
  The game dragged on into extra innings, 
and because both managers wanted every player to get an opportunity to play in the game, both teams ran out of players to pitch by the 12th frame.
  Commissioner Bud Selig decided to end 
the game, causing the ﬁ  rst tie since 1961, when the game was called due to rain.
  Ending the game in a tie was an embar-
rassment for both Selig and Major League Baseball, but the way the league tried to remedy the problem presented another is-sue.
  Now, the All-Star Game “means some-
thing.” The winning side gets home ﬁ  eld advantage in the World Series.
  But adding the home ﬁ  eld advantage in-
centive doesn’t make the game more inter-esting, and it makes no sense come playoff time.
  What incentive does Jose Fernandez, the 
sole representative from the woeful Mar-lins, have tonight? Miami needs the angels from “Angels In The Outﬁ  eld” to even get out of last place. They don’t care who gets home ﬁ  eld advantage.
  Fernandez likely has one thing on his 
mind at Citi Field tonight: I hope I don’t get hurt.
  And why does a player like Fernandez 
get to impact the playoffs that he almost certainly won’t be a part of?
  If the Pirates storm into the World Series 
with 115 wins under their belts, they de-serve home ﬁ  eld advantage.
  But if they play a Rays team that limped 
in with 85 wins, and the American League wins tonight, then Tropicana Field will be hosting a major-ity of the World Series games.
  How is that 
fair?
      Why does the 
All-Star Game 
need to have playoff implications?
  The players don’t seem to care as much. 
There isn’t a major rivalry between the two leagues. The game might “mean some-thing,” but I don’t think Robinson Cano is going to bowl through Yadier Molina Pete Rose-style. They have their all-star bo-nuses. They just want to have fun and stay healthy.  
  I almost enjoy the Home Run Derby 
more. You know why? There’s no pres-sure.
 Each game from April through Septem-
ber has pressure. Pennant races last un-til the last day of the season. The All-Star Game should be a time to relax and enjoy ourselves.
 Maybe something should be done to 
make the game easier to follow.
 Players shufﬂ  e in and out of the lineup 
so quickly that it’s hard to keep track, even though almost all the players are house-
hold names.
  But hey, maybe the game hasn’t changed 
and I did. Maybe I’m just older and more 
cynical.
  But I know the addition of home ﬁ  eld 
advantage hasn’t helped the All-Star Game at all. I’ll tune in, but not because it will matter in October. I just want to watch some baseball.

  What Billy Donovan hoped to 
be a developmental year for Da-
montre Harris turned out to be the opposite last season.
  Harris, a 6-foot-10 center who 
transferred from South Carolina, knew he would be ineligible to play during the 2012-13 season because of NCAA transfer rules. But injuries and illness prevented the junior from practicing for the majority of the year. 
  “I really feel bad for Damon-
tre because I really felt like last year was a wasted year for him,” Donovan said Wednesday. “He really needed a year of individual instruction, player development, those kind of things.”
  Donovan hoped Harris would 
be the perfect practice opponent for starting center Patric Young, but that never came to fruition.
  In October, Harris dislocat-
ed his shoulder and suffered a labrum tear when a teammate fell on him during practice. 
  He underwent surgery a week 
later and did not participate in any full-contact drills for about four months. Donovan said Harris lost a signiﬁ  cant amount of weight be-cause he could not partake in any weightlifting. 
  Harris was cleared to return 
to practice on Feb. 28, but he suf-fered a high ankle sprain less than a week later. 
  In addition, Harris battled strep 
throat last season. Doctors ini-tially thought they would have to perform surgery on him because they believed he had an abscess in his throat. Instead, Harris went on antibiotics for about six weeks to treat the condition. 
  Harris also dealt with legal is-
sues. He was arrested the morn-ing of Feb. 20 for failing to appear in court on a trafﬁ  c citation stem-ming from last July, according to Alligator archives. 
  With ﬁ  ve-star forward Chris 
Walker’s academic eligibility still in question, Florida hopes Harris will provide depth in the front-court next season. 
  As South Carolina’s starting 
center in 2011-12, Harris aver-aged 6.8 points and 5.5 rebounds per contest. He ﬁ  nished tied for second in the Southeastern Con-ference with 2.3 blocks per game, trailing only Kentucky’s Anthony Davis (4.7). 
  Harris is currently participat-
ing in Florida’s workouts, which take place two hours a week dur-ing the summer. According to the team’s updated roster for the 2013-14 season, Harris is back to his previous weight of 228 pounds.  
  “He’s doing much, much bet-
ter now,” Donovan said. “We’re trying to maybe make up for some lost time right now.”

 Mike Gillislee grabbed headlines at 
last year’s Southeastern Confer-ence Media Days after predicting 
that he would rack up 1,500 yards and 24 touchdowns in 2012.
  OK, they were goals, not predictions. But 
for the sake of this column, just bear with me.
  Although Gillislee fell short of both 
marks, he enjoyed a successful season as a ﬁ  rst-time starter, becoming the ﬁ  rst Florida player to rush for 1,000 yards in a season since 2004.
  In the spirit of Gilly’s conﬁ  dence and 
ambition last year, I will make some bold predictions regarding how the SEC will play out this season ahead of this week’s SEC Me-dia Days.
  And just like Mike, I’ll also probably fall a 
little short. So, uh, cut me some slack.
  I’ll go with eight predictions because 
that’s the number of consecutive national titles the SEC will have won at the end of the 2013 campaign.
  1. South Carolina’s Jadeveon Clowney 
will sack everyone and everything. Even you. Nobody is safe. Why are you still sit-ting there? Run!
  2. Johnny Manziel will ﬁ  nally come 
around — again! — and realize Gators coach Will Muschamp was right all along. Col-lege Station is a bad place to be, especially considering that the Heisman Trophy win-ner has nowhere to go but down. (Also, the nearest Zaxby’s is 72.3 miles away in Spring, Texas. Wait a minute. There are two Zaxby’s in Spring! What the hell is he still doing in College Station? Also, Josh Beckett and Jim Parsons are from Spring.) 
When Manziel tweeted his desire to leave 
Aggieland in June before promptly deleting the post, he was likely ﬁ  nally beginning to feel the pressure. You can only ride the kind of high he’s been living on since December for so long before everything evens out. 
Losing Kliff Kingsbury and Luke Joeckel 
(Go Jags!) will hurt, and it doesn’t help that the biggest target in college football is paint-ed on Johnny Football’s back. Good luck in Round 2 against those SEC defenses. You’re going to need it.
  3. Georgia quarterback Aaron Murray 
will represent the SEC in New York at the Heisman Trophy presentation in December. Murray will shine 
in his senior season surrounded by a variety of playmak-ers such as Todd Gurley, Malcolm Mitchell and Keith Marshall. There’s 
no telling how the Bulldogs’ new-look de-fense will fare in 2013, but the Murray-led offense is poised to put up numbers as big as  Clowney’s hit on former Michigan running back Vincent Smith.
  4. Clowney will also be in New York 
come December. He’ll either be up on stage with Murray or emerging from New York Harbor Godzilla-style and wreaking havoc on the Big Apple. I lean toward the latter. Actually, I’ll be running from it.
  5. The Gators are a year away from Atlan-
ta. There’s plenty to like about their incred-ibly talented defense, but I believe the group needs a year to come together and mature under the leadership of new defensive coor-dinator D.J. Durkin. As for the offense, the rushing attack will be one of the SEC’s best, thanks to a much-improved offensive line and a bevy of talented ball carriers. As for Jeff Driskel and the pass-catchers, I’ll believe it when I see it.
  6. LSU will win 10 or more games. Also, 
death and taxes.
  7. James Franklin will leave Vanderbilt 
after an eight-win season to take a better job in another conference (Texas should wise up and grab him before USC kicks Lane Kifﬁ  n to the curb). Franklin has been scary good with limited resources at Vandy, earning back-to-back bowl berths and winning nine (!) games last season. He’s too good to stay in Nashville much longer.
  8. Alabama will win its third straight 
national title. He might be Satan himself (What’s up, Tim Davis?), but Nick Saban is simply the best. After the Crimson Tide wins the crystal football, people will debate whether the SEC is actually the nation’s best conference or if the league merely earns its prestige as the home of a modern dynasty. Of course it’s the former, but Skip Bayless and Stephen A. Smith need something to yell about.
