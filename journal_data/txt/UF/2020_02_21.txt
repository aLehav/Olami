When a Gainesville 
woman hired an inspector 
to assess her home for 
repairs Monday afternoon, 
she was surprised when 
police, not the inspector, 
showed up at her door. 
“As soon as we told 
her why we’re there, she 
immediately remembered 
that those things were 
under the house,” said Gainesville Police 
spokesperson Jorge 
Campos.
“Those things” were six 
to eight large plastic jars. 
Their contents — multiple 
preserved human tongues.
When the inspector 
was taking a look under 
the crawlspace of the 
house near Northwest 16th 
Avenue on Monday, he 
stumbled upon the jars, 
unscrewed the lid off one 
and peered in, Campos 
said. 
Police say the inspector 
recognized the contents of 
his discovery as human remains and called 911 
before taking off.
The jars belonged to 
Ronald A. Baughman, the 
former owner of the house 
and UF professor emeritus, 
Campos said. Baughman 
and his ex-wife divorced 
in 1992 when he left her, 
the house and apparently a 
few tongues behind.
Baughman could not 
be reached for comment.

All across campus, Mr. 
Two-Bits ties were plastered 
over the red brick exterior of 
campus buildings. The iconic 
accessory is easily recognized 
and hard to miss.
The timely campaign 
featuring the orange and 
blue striped banners of the 
late George Edmonson’s 
tie showcased UF’s second 
annual Giving Day. In its second year, more than $23 
million was raised for UF 
colleges, programs and clubs. 
It doubled last year’s amount 
from $12.6 million, the ﬁ  rst 
year of the fundraising event.
Giving Day is a 24-
hour fundraising effort  is 
spearheaded by the UF Alumni 
Association in conjunction 
with the UF Foundation, 
which, according to its 
website, is the “fundraising 
and gift fund management 
arm of the University of 
Florida.” Together, they 
strive to inform donors with 
decorations like Mr. Two-
Bits’ ties, Gator Day at the Florida capitol building in 
Tallahassee and various on-
campus booths and activities. 
According to Giving Day’s 
website, the main purpose 
behind the event — which 
started at midnight Thursday 
and ended that same day at 
11:59 p.m. — is to increase 
alumni donations in support 
of “UF’s far-reaching work 
and our drive to the Top 5 of 
public universities.”
Despite these efforts, 
some students didn’t entirely 
know what the event was.

Ethan Irvin, a 19-year-old UF mathematics sophomore, juggles on Turlington Plaza Feb. 12. Irvin said he’s been juggling 
for more than two years and loves doing it. “It’s a good stress reliever, ” he said.HE PERFORMS AND 
TEACHES OTHER

Pamphlets passed 
around by students and 
strangers are not the 
only “ﬂ  yers” you can see 
on Turlington Plaza.
A trio of red and 
blue marbled balls cycle 
through the air every 
Monday, Wednesday and 
Friday from 11:45 a.m. 
to 12:35 p.m. Slender 
ﬁ  ngers pluck the egg-
sized juggling balls back 
out of the air as they fall 
toward the ground and 
send them ﬂ  ying again.
Ethan Irvin, a 19-year-
old UF mathematics 
sophomore, spends his 
afternoons juggling in 
front of an empty table on 
Turlington. But instead 
of standing alone, dozens 
of students observe his 
skills in the crowded 
plaza every day. Some 
have also come to him 
for juggling lessons.
“It’s not only a cool 
trick. It’s a good way to relax at any moment,” he 
said. “I use it to destress 
before class.” 
Irvin used to juggle 
last year outside of Little 
Hall and Library West, 
but he went to Turlington 
this semester to put his 
free show on for a larger 
audience. 
Liza Adler, a 20-
year old UF advertising 
sophomore, said she 
was fascinated by 
his performance and 
couldn’t stop watching.
“It’s kind of 
hypnotic,” she said. “I 
can’t help but watch him 
for a bit on my way to 
class.”
Irvin said he taught 
himself how to juggle 
during his senior year 
of high school. He was 
inspired to learn the 
skill by a clown named 
Fritzy the One Man 
Circus, whom Irvin 
said he met when he 
volunteered at Christmas 
Lane, a month-long 
Christmas light festival 
at the Florida Strawberry 
Festival grounds. UF student takes juggling group to new heights

FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 2020   ALLIGATOR   3 “He was on a 12-foot-tall unicycle juggling 
pins,” he said. “It was the first juggling trick I 
saw anyone do.”
Back then, he said he knew he couldn’t 
replicate the clown’s tactics of eating fire and 
doing unicycle tricks, so he picked up juggling 
instead.
“He said he learned to juggle when he was 
young,” Irvin said. “If he could do it, I knew I 
could do it.”
Irvin, however, isn’t restricted to juggling 
balls — he has used pins, rings, sandwich subs, 
bananas, apples, footballs and basketballs since 
learning the basics. He sticks to balls and fruit 
when juggling on Turlington, though. 
Sometimes Irvin hears jeers and gets negative 
feedback whenever he drops a ball, but he is 
happy to know people are interested in his 
hobby.
“Several physics professors have asked me 
to come to their class to juggle to show their 
students it’s a thing that people actually do,” 
he said.
Like Fritzy inspired Irvin to juggle, Irvin is 
returning the legacy to UF students by inspiring 
them to learn the practice. He’s now teaching 
almost 10 people how to juggle. 
Abram Nedou, a 19-year-old physics 
sophomore, started taking free lessons with 
Irvin after seeing him juggle.
“Everyone at Turlington was with their clubs, 
fraternities or groups calling people over, but 
Ethan was just juggling,” Nedou said. “He did 
a lot of cool tricks I didn’t know were possible.”
Nedou became interested in learning juggling 
so he could pick up a party trick, he said. He has 
gone from struggling with one ball to juggling 
three with ease since the lessons started five 
weeks ago. 
Ethan’s juggling did not just attract novice 
jugglers. Twenty-year-old Devin Pryor, a UF 
aerospace engineering sophomore, had been 
juggling for three years before he noticed Ethan 
on Turlington.
Pryor said he began juggling during his 
senior year of high school when Hurricane Irma 
knocked an avocado tree onto his home’s power 
lines. He was left without power for a week and 
the tree’s avocados had littered the yard. 
“I was using the avocados to juggle. It was 
the easiest thing I had at the time,” he said.
Devin said he used to be a member of Objects 
in Motion, a juggling club that was disbanded 
last year due to the graduation of most of its 
members. He said he is glad he found someone 
else to juggle with.
“It’s a great break from class, and there are 
tricks that are meant to be done by more than 
one person,” he said.
The group calls itself the “UF Juggling Guys” 
and meets every Tuesday at 5 p.m. on the Plaza 
of the Americas. Juggling balls and equipment 
are supplied by Irvin, and he said anyone is 
welcome to watch or join.
Irvin said he hopes to grow the group into a 
student organization, which must consist of at 
least 15 members, three officers and a faculty 
adviser. He’s waiting to see if he can get enough 
students interested by continuing the juggling 
performances that got him to where he is now.
“It’s inspiring to see the amazing tricks 
people can do with just a little practice,” he 
said. “If someone wants to give it a try, I am 
more than willing to get them performing tricks 
on their own.”FEATURE FRIDAY

JUGGLING,  from pg. 1‘It’s kind of hypnotic’4  ALLIGATOR    FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 2020
UF art history junior, “kind of” had 
an idea as to what Giving Day was, 
saying he thought it had something to 
do with donations to the school.
“Tuition is expensive,” Lay said. 
“I already give the school money, so 
students giving more money is an 
interesting question.”
Luke Anderson, the UF Foundation 
spokesperson, explained that 
advertising Giving Day on campus 
was strictly to show students that 
they have a strong network of alumni 
supporting them in their collegiate 
efforts.
When asked how she felt about 
Giving Day, Isha Verma, an 18-year-
old UF biomedical engineering 
freshman, explained that she feels 
conﬂ  icted about the idea of UF asking 
students for money.
“We’re already paying so much to 
the university, but I also do understand 
because I was at Marston today and 
they were asking for money to help 
other students get textbooks,” Verma 
said. ”I see that as a good cause, but 
then I’m also like, doesn’t my tuition 
and state funding cover this?”
After receiving more than 11,000 
donations in that time span last year, 
the university’s 2020 goal was set 
at 15,000 donations in one day. It 
received 16,772 donations. Currently, 
UF  is tied for No. 7 in the US News 
& World Report rankings of top public 
universities. In order to break through 
the top ﬁ  ve, the university decided to 
focus on increasing alumni giving.
But according to how the US News 
& World Report ranks universities, 
alumni giving is tied for the category 
with the smallest weight. The other 
tied category is social mobility. Alumni 
giving only makes up 5 percent of what goes into a school’s national standing. 
Other factors include graduation 
and retention rates at 22 percent, 
undergraduate academic reputation 
at 20 percent,  faculty resources at 20 
percent and others. 
Alumni giving is deﬁ  ned by US 
News and World Report as “the 
nonweighted mean percentage of 
undergraduate alumni of record who 
donated money to the college or 
university.”
This ﬁ  gure is used as a measuring 
stick for student satisfaction with a 
university. If students enjoyed their 
time in school, they are more likely 
to donate money to their alma mater, 
according to the report. 
Other universities ranked in the 
top 10 hold their own versions of 
giving days throughout the year. No. 
2 University of California, Berkeley, 
has Big Give on March 12, which 
its website describes as their annual 
24-hour “fundraising blitz.” No. 3 
University of Michigan held its most 
recent Giving Blueday on Dec. 3. 
According to Anderson, the 
organization uses “many of these 
(merchandise, banners, etc.) items 
year-over-year to save costs.” 
However, there are costs — like food 
and a D.J. at IBC and La Casita on 
Thursday — that cannot be reused or 
paid for once.
When asked about how much 
was spent on advertising for Giving 
Day this year, Anderson said that the 
organization did “not have budget 
numbers.” 
In its 2018 990 tax return — 
before the ﬁ  rst Giving Day — the UF 
Foundation reported $13.38 million 
in total fundraising expenses and  
revenue of $3.6 million.

night, he told an Alligator 
reporter that he didn’t have 
time and hung up. 
He worked at UF as a 
faculty member within the 
College of Dentistry, said UF 
spokesperson Steve Orlando. 
He published research studies 
in the 1970s and ’80s and 
retired in 2002. He has not 
worked with the university 
since. 
“All indications so far 
is that the specimen didn’t 
have anything to do with the 
university,” Campos said.
Baughman’s ex-wife told 
police the tongues were part 
of Baughman’s pathology 
research, Campos said. She 
and her ex-husband had 
forgotten all about them, but 
it didn’t take much to jog her 
memory. 
Dates from the 1960s and 
the word “Virginia” were 
written on a jar, Campos 
said. Baughman’s ex-wife 
told police the specimen 
came from the University of 
Virginia.
It is still unknown how 
many tongues were found, 
Campos said.
Baughman told police the 
tongues belonged to donated 
cadavers and were used for 
thyroid and neck research. 
Campos said Baughman 
decided to slip the tongues 
under the house because 
its cool climate made for a 
convenient storage spot.
This is not the ﬁ  rst time 
a Gainesville researcher 
decided to bring human 
remains home from work, 
Campos said. Plastic seems to be the container of choice.
“With the number of 
researchers that we have in 
this area, it’s not frequent, 
but it’s not uncommon for 
us to come across specimens, 
whether it’s animal or 
human,” Campos said. 
In 2002, a UF neurology 
professor was found storing 
heads, brains, arms and other 
body parts in Tupperware 
containers throughout his 
home, Campos said. Joseph 
James Warner was ﬁ  red from 
the university and arrested 
for the illegal storage and 
preservation of human 
remains.
Campos said that both 
Baughman and his ex-wife 
have been cooperative in the 
investigation and say they 
have paperwork to prove 
where the jars came from and 
why Baughman had them.
“We have nothing to 
indicate they were trying 
to hide anything from us or 
anyone,” Campos said.
Baughman’s dental 
license expired on Feb. 28, 
2008, and he does not have 
a current practice location 
in Florida, according to 
the Florida Department of 
Health. No public complaints, 
disciplinary or emergency 
actions were found.
The jars have been handed 
over to the medical examiner 
and are currently under 
investigation, Campos said. 
Whether or not the jars will 
be returned to Baughman after 
the investigation completed is 
unknown.

STUDENTS WHO PAID A DEPOSIT 
WILL BE REIMBURSED
By Jessica T orrente
Alligator Contributing Writer
Students whose study abroad trips to 
China were canceled still have a chance to 
travel elsewhere or get a refund. 
The UF International Center had a meet-
ing Friday to ﬁ  nalize the decision to cancel 
the programs because of the coronavirus 
outbreak, said Leonardo Villalón, the dean 
of the UF International Center. The formal 
announcement was made Monday. 
Students who paid a deposit for the 
study abroad fee will be reimbursed if they 
don’t travel. However, the center is giving 
some students the opportunity to relocate 
their trip or ﬁ  nd a new program, Villalón 
said. 
“It’s been a tough time to manage and 
monitor these things,” he said. “At the 
same time, safety and health have to be 
our ﬁ  rst concern.”
A total of 143 student applications to 
study in China during the Summer were 
withdrawn, said Maria Selezneva, the 
study abroad adviser for Southeast Asian 
countries, but only 51 of those applications 
were formally completed. At least ﬁ  ve stu-
dents consulted with Selezneva about ﬁ  nd-
ing an alternative program, she said.Villalón said only programs to China 
will be canceled, not those in nearby coun-
tries. However, he said his team are closely 
watching what could happen elsewhere.
“The spread of the virus is mostly due 
to the people moving,” he said. “So if we 
need to, something will change, but at the 
moment we are planning on going through 
with plans for other countries.”
Jenna Waterous said she was disap-
pointed when her study abroad trip to 
China was canceled. The 21-year-old UF 
marketing senior said she was supposed to 
attend a one-week global immersion expe-
rience to learn about business in Shanghai. 
The UF Warrington College of Business 
relocated her trip to Slovenia and Croatia 
instead.
“I’m more understanding than upset, 
but I’m lucky since they basically made a 
new trip for us,” she wrote in a text. “You 
just got to be understanding in situations 
like this. The health of students comes be-
fore anything else.”
Waterous said she paid for her ﬂ  ight, 
the program deposit and her visa to China. 
Her visa was refunded and the deposit was 
applied toward the new program fee. The 
university offered to pay the fees for the 
ﬂ  ight change.
“I don’t know when I’ll get the chance 
to go again, but I’m sure I’ll get there one 
day,” Waterous said.Study abroad to China canceledChristina Morales // Alligator Staff
These new signs on 13th Street are meant to help students map out 
the campus. The ﬁ  nal design for the signs is still being decided on.
OWNER BROUGHT 
ANIMALS 
TO TRUMP’S 
INAUGURATION
By Sarah Mandile
Alligator Staff Writer
Of all the things Lind-
say Watkins thought she 
might see on her way back 
from a concert in downtown 
Gainesville Tuesday night, a 
llama wasn’t one of them.
The 23-year-old ﬁ  rst-year 
UF musicology graduate stu-
dent received a call from one 
of her classmates to walk 
over to see the llama. Initial-
ly, she was confused when 
she ﬁ  rst saw it.
“I thought, ‘Why is there 
a llama in Gainesville?’” 
Watkins said.
Thaddeus the llama has 
traveled all over the country. 
He travels with Ethan Ab-
bott, also known as Ethan 
the Farmer, a man who uses 
animals to start a conversa-tion about social issues in-
cluding mass incarceration, 
prison slavery and homeless 
laws. 
“I show up with a llama 
and that pretty much creates 
an event all by itself,” Abbott 
said.
 Abbott also brings other 
animals around the country, 
including two alpacas, six 
dogs, chickens and pigeons. 
Abbott said he took all of 
these to President Donald 
Trump’s inauguration.
In 2000, Abbott was 
a farmer in Colorado. He 
started using llamas to spark 
conversations about where 
people’s food comes from.
When he was farming, 
Abbott raised llamas and 
alpacas. He soon realized 
that they were trainable and 
smart. The ﬁ  rst llama he 
raised was Thaddeus’ sister. 
Eventually, this relationship 
inspired him to travel with 
Thaddeus. 
Abbott and Thaddeus 
visited Miami, Fort My-ers, Sarasota, Tampa and 
Ocala. They left Gainesville 
Wednesday. 
Abbott transports his 
animals in a gutted van that 
he ensured was suitable for 
them. 
Thaddeus may return 
to University Avenue next 
Spring. Abbott said he hopes 
he was able to inspire stu-
dents he spoke with to 
change the world. 
“Turn off the TV. Get off 
the couch. Get in the street 
to actually start taking action 
to be the change,” he said.

THE TEMPORARY SIGNS 
COST $21,000 TO BE 
DESIGNED, FABRICATED 
AND SHIPPED
By AJ Bafer
Alligator Contributing Writer
Some UF signs could take a 
new direction.
Four new signs have been 
installed on UF’s campus. 
Two of them are located on 
Southwest 13th Street and 
point out the locations of UF’s 
hospitals, Innovation District and 
administration, while the other two signs are in front of Tigert 
Hall.
UF spokesperson Steve 
Orlando said the signs are mock-
ups and part of a plan to help 
map out the university and bring 
clarity to these UF properties. The 
temporary signs vary, and a ﬁ  nal 
design will be decided on. 
Creating the four mock-ups cost 
$21,000 for the design, creation 
and shipping, Orlando said. The 
project began in November 2018, 
and the signs were installed in 
January by UF Facilities Services. 
The design plan for these signs 
should be ﬁ  nished by May, and 
these are the only signs planned, he said.
The project is managed by 
UF’s Planning, Design and 
Construction Division and is 
overseen by Charlie Lane, UF’s 
senior vice president and chief 
operating ofﬁ  cer, said Linda 
Dixon, the division’s director of 
planning. 
Dixon said the signs will 
probably come down this week 
or next, but ﬁ  nal designs will 
be selected before the signs are 
removed. 
“We’re not ﬁ  nished with that 
development process, but those 
are some of the mock-ups that 
we’re considering,” she said.UF installing new signs on campus6   ALLIGATOR    FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 2020
STUDENT GOVERNMENT ELECTION
THERE WERE 11,128 
BALLOTS CAST
Alligator Staff Report
Student Body President-elect 
Trevor Pope’s face flushed red as 
he gripped his running mate Vice-
President-elect Lauredan Official 
when they were announced 
as election winners. The pair 
jumped, held each other and 
screamed. It was the ending they 
wanted. 
Pope, Official and Student 
Body Treasurer-elect Jessica 
Jesurajan were enveloped with 
hugs and congratulations. 
“I’m feeling like this is a 
dream, honestly,” Jesurajan said. 
“Yeah, I actually honestly can’t 
believe that just happened. It is a 
dream come true.”
Gator Party won its first 
executive ticket since its 
inception in Fall 2019 Wednesday 
night. There were 11,128 ballots 
cast on Tuesday and Wednesday, 
said the UF Student Government 
Supervisor of Elections Stephanie 
Siler. Tuesday had the second-
highest first-day turnout in the 
last decade.
Pope and Official won with 
6,309 votes or 57.3 percent. 
Jesurajan won with 6,336 votes 
or 57.86 percent. 
Students voted on candidates 
for Student Body president, vice 
president and treasurer and 50 
Senate seats. Despite a promising 
start for Inspire Party when it 
won 26 Senate seats in Fall — a majority — Inspire couldn’t hold 
onto its success. 
Gator delivered this semester, 
winning the majority of Senate 
with 30 seats. This election’s 
Senate seats were divided by 
college and school year. Senators 
and executives serve one-year 
terms. 
Students also voted not to 
pass an amendment with 24 SG 
constitutional revisions to the 
Student Body constitution. If 
passed, it would’ve changed parts 
of SG’s governing document.
The constitutional amendment 
was not approved, largely 
because the votes from people 
who selected to abstain were 
counted as “no” votes. 
If the amendment had passed, 
constitutional amendments — 
like this one that was voted down 
— would not count those who 
abstained as a vote for no.   
The revision also would have 
made it easier to get future 
amendments to pass by lowering 
the percentage of “yes” votes 
required to pass legislation. 
Many Gator senators-elect 
were previously affiliated with 
the former majority party, Impact 
Party. 
Last semester, Inspire’s 
Student Body presidential 
candidate co-filed a resolution 
to impeach the current Impact-
affiliated Student Body President 
Michael Murphy after emails 
surfaced of his communication 
with a campaign official about 
bringing Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle to campus.
Both parties focused on 
student safety in its platforms 
after students marched last 
Fall down Fraternity Drive, the 
only area on campus without 
blue lights, demanding UF SG 
and administration install the 
emergency phones there. Inspire 
said it supported the movement 
after speaking with student 
organizers and included blue 
lights on its Fall platform.Before results were announced, 
Nick Meyer, a Senate candidate 
for the College of Liberal Arts and 
Sciences, said no matter what, 
Gator gave its all this campaign 
season. He said he was feeling 
cautiously optimistic before the 
results were announced. Meyer 
lost his candidacy for a Senate 
seat, and all seven Liberal Arts 
and Sciences seats went to 
Inspire.
“They have wonderful 
candidates on their side; we 
have wonderful candidates 
on our side,” Meyer said. “No 
matter what happens tonight, 
our university will be well 
represented.”
Now that he’s been elected, 
bipartisanship is one of the first 
things Cooper Brown said he 
wants to work on as a senator 
representing the UF College of 
Agriculture and Life Sciences. 
Brown and two other Gator 
members won seats from the 
college.
“Real bipartisanship comes 
when we just put all the politics 
aside and sit down and have 
conversations with each other,” 
Brown said. “That’s when real 
change and real ideas get to 
happen.”
Even before Inspire’s Matthew 
Barocas lost the treasurer seat, 
along with the others on his 
executive ticket, he was teary 
eyed. His roommate and best 
friend Angelo Sciabarassi won 
a Senate seat to represent the 
UF Herbert Wertheim College of 
Engineering with Inspire. The 
minority party won three out of 
the four engineering seats. 
Matthew Diaz and his running 
mate Emily Hyden, a leader in 
the blue lights protest, also lost. 
Diaz and Hyden received 4,646 votes or 42.19 percent. Barocas 
got 4,573 votes or 41.76 percent. 
Barocas has known Sciabarassi 
since kindergarten. He said 
he felt more emotional about 
Sciabarassi’s win than his own 
loss.
“I’m doing OK. I’ve been 
through this before,” he said, 
referring to when he lost the 
Senate seat to represent Hume 
Hall in Fall 2018. 
He said he knew he wasn’t 
going to be the future treasurer 
seat when Inspire lost all the 
seats representing sophomores.
Earlier in the night, members 
of Inspire gathered around the 
pond at the Reitz Union. Some 
danced while they waited. Others 
finished homework and quizzes 
as they watched Gator chant 
“G-A-T-O-R, Gator Party that’s 
who we are” and march into the 
union.
Diaz, the Inspire Presidential 
candidate sat a few levels down 
from the congregation before 
the election. He ate a Subway 
sandwich, his first meal after 
campaigning all day.
“Food is the first thing to go 
for me when I get really stressed 
out,” he said.
Diaz said he would continue 
to advocate for campus safety 
measures and racial and gender 
equity. 
“It’s always sad to see when 
there’s so much optimism going 
into something, and then it kind 
of gets crushed out,” he said.

Guard Nina Rickards scored just six points in a road loss to 
Alabama Thursday night.
WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
By Graham Marsh 
Sports Writer
It was 57-53 in favor of the Gators. 
UF guard Lavender Briggs knocked 
down a trey to put Florida ahead by four 
with 5:08 to play in the fourth quarter. 
It appeared to be a similar finish to last 
year’s matchup, when coach Cam New-
bauer’s group edged the Crimson Tide in 
a two-point victory. 
But after that Briggs three, Alabama 
finished the game on a 16-5 run, and sud-
denly the narrative was entirely different. 
The dominant surge by the home 
team, spearheaded by guard Jordan Lew-
is, left the Gators frazzled late and with 
an additional tally in the loss column. 
The Crimson Tide defeated Florida 69-
62 in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, on Thursday 
night to improve to 15-11(5-8 SEC), while 
UF fell to 14-11 (5-8 SEC). 
Despite the loss, Briggs was brilliant 
all night for the orange and blue. Seem-ingly nothing the Crimson Tide tried 
worked against the Provo, Utah, native as 
she dropped 21 points on 8-of-15 shoot-
ing. She sunk three of her five three-point 
attempts and tacked on five rebounds 
and two assists. Her only struggle of the 
night was free-throw shooting, as she got 
to the charity stripe seven times only to 
knock down two. 
She was not the only Gator struggling 
to make her free shots count. As a team, 
Florida shot a woeful 8 of 21 from the 
free-throw line. The Crimson Tide were 
not particularly impressive in that cat-
egory, shooting only 13 of 23 themselves, 
but it was enough to be a key difference 
in this contest.
But more problematic than missing 
free throws, was the lack of contribution 
from anyone not named Briggs wearing 
a black jersey. Point guard Kiara Smith 
barely scraped double-figure scoring with 
11 points, but it was only off of a 4-of-11 
shooting night from the field. Freshman guard Brylee Bartram, who 
had a career game last time out against 
Missouri on Sunday with 18 points off of 
six threes, could not have been less effec-
tive in Tuscaloosa. Through her 12 min-
utes of action, she only shot two threes 
and missed both. 
Florida won the rebounding battle 
(38-36) and the turnover battle (13-15), 
but UF was uncharacteristically beaten in 
the paint.
Alabama forward Jasmine Walker had 
13 points while Florida forward Zada 
Williams had just six. Williams typically 
dominates inside for the Gators, and the 
lack of that winning presence tonight 
made things difficult down the stretch for 
the Gators. 
Florida will have to get over this tough 
loss quickly, as it heads home to play Ar-
kansas on Sunday at 4 p.m.

SWIMMING & DIVING 
By Ainslie Lee
Sports Writer
A first-place finish, a No. 2 spot in SportsCen-
ter’s Top-10, a three-body-length lead and a 
4:06.32 swim. 
The mathematician is Florida sophomore 
Kieran Smith and the sum of the equation is an 
American and NCAA record. 
At the SEC swimming and diving champi-
onships in Auburn, Alabama, Florida’s men’s 
team is competing for its eighth consecutive 
conference title, and Smith is certainly helping 
in the Gators’ quest.
In day one of the five-day meet, Smith and 
the other members of the Gators’ men’s 800 free relay team snatched a gold medal after its 
performance broke school and conference re-
cords.
Composed of Smith, Gerry Quinn, Khader 
Baqlah and Clark Beach, the quartet of Gator 
swimmers touched the wall in 6:09.91. 
Smith, who jumped off of the blocks first for 
Florida, set a SEC Championship record, a UF 
record, a new personal-best and the fourth fast-
est 200 free swim ever with his split of 1:30.11. 
On day two of the action, Smith returned to 
the pool for the 500 free event. 
In the Ridgefield, Connecticut, native’s 
record-breaking swim, he beat the previous 
American record by nearly a full second. 
The fastest time was held previously by Zane Grothe with a time of 4:07.25. Smith’s 
swim of 4:06.32 etched his name into the re-
cord books. 
Prior to the SEC Championships, Smith’s 
best time was 4:18.13. He managed a 4:14.55 
during Wednesday morning’s prelims. 
“It’s special. Going into the meet, we knew 
we could be around 4:08’s maybe, but 4:06 was 
(an) incredible swim,” Smith said of his record-
breaking performance in a release. “Lights out. 
It just felt really, really good throughout the 
whole time.” 
As it is, Smith and the Gators are maintain-
ing a second-place spot in the meet’s field of 
11 teams. Texas A&M leads the pack with 438 
points. The Gators are on the Aggies’ heels with 395 points. 
The conference champion will be crowned 
on Saturday night. But Gainesville already has 
a champion of its own. 
The women’s squad had a conference-best 
13 swimmers qualify for Wednesday night’s fi-
nals. Sophomore Vanessa Pearl won the 200 in-
dividual medley after a swim of 1:54.80 — good 
for the seventh-best time in the NCAA. 
As of Wednesday night, Florida’s women 
were also second in the conference champion-
ships with 356.5 points. Tennessee leads the 
women’s field of 12 teams with 385.

LACROSSE

Sports Writer
Neither Buffaloes nor Terrapins have been able to stand 
in the way of the No. 3 Gators’ path this season. 
Saturday, Florida will have another top-ranked matchup, 
with No. 10 Loyola-Maryland traveling south. And though UF 
is fresh off its upset victory against then-No. 2 Maryland, the 
No. 10 Greyhounds will present a third-straight challenge. 
“They’re super well-coached,” coach Amanda O’Leary 
said. “They’re great cutters, so it’s something we haven’t 
seen thus far from other teams. Colorado and Maryland were 
more one v. one drivers, this is more of a cutting team so it’ll 
be a true challenge to us.”
Last year in Baltimore, Florida lost 12-15. To beat the Grey-
hounds at home, it will take a near-flawless effort against a 
Loyola defense featuring goalie Kaitlyn Larson, whose .564 
save percentage is tied for tenth nationally, and All-Patriot 
League Second Team defender Kaitlyn Larsson.“Their goalie is very aggressive; comes out of the cage, 
plays really high in her crease, so that will be a little bit 
different for us,” O’Leary said. “They provide a lot of chal-
lenges.”
To counter a Greyhound defense that plays man but reads 
like a zone, Kavanagh says the Gators have been copying 
that tactic in practice to exploit its flaws. Other areas of im-
provement include cleaning up the team’s tendency of com-
mitting fouls and turnovers. 
“We don’t want to give them eight-meter shots,” said 
redshirt junior midfielder Brianna Harris. “We don’t want to 
give them free position shots. I’m hoping against Loyola, it’s 
going to be a lot cleaner.” 
Though young, this team is proving to be well-rounded. 
Though they lost the program’s leader in saves and second-
best point scorer in program history, they are two goals be-
hind last year’s two-game mark. 
That’s in part because of the combined play of their upper 
and underclassmen. Junior midfielder Shannon Kavanagh currently leads the team in points scored with 12 while Har-
ris is second with 11. 
Third on the list is sophomore Hannah Mardiney with 
four points; fourth features a three-way tie between redshirt 
freshman Emerson Cabrera and freshmen Emily Heller and 
Kaala Puglisi with three, respectively.
Cabrera and junior defender Kaitlyn Dabkowski both lead 
the team in caused turnovers (three) while senior defender 
Cara Trombetta shares the team’s lead for ground balls (six) 
with sophomore Emma Wightman. 
It’s that abundance of talent from top to bottom that has 
proven pivotal to the team’s success this far into the season. 
It’s what could push them ahead going forward too. 
“I can’t emphasize enough how talented everybody is,” 
Harris said. “Every single day we’re learning and every single 
day we’re growing and I think Maryland really showed that.”

BASEBALL
By Dylan O’Shea
Sports Writer
The Gators will go from walk-off win-
ners to walking into the eye of the storm 
against the Hurricanes.
No. 2 Florida and No. 3 Miami will 
play a three-game set at Alex Rodriguez 
Park at Mark Light Field this weekend.
Both teams enter this weekend’s se-
ries with about as impressive of an early-
season resume as possible. Florida (5-0) 
and Miami (4-0) have laid waste to their 
competition, each winning their games by 
more than six runs on average.
Both teams’ offenses are on fire to start 
the season, and it will take elite starting 
pitching to extinguish the flames.
UF’s ace Tommy Mace (1-0) will toe 
the rubber for Florida tonight against Mi-
ami’s high-octane offensive attack. The 
junior right-hander gave up two runs in 
six innings pitched in Florida’s season-
opener against Marshall on Feb. 14.
The Gators will send out junior Jack 
Leftwich (1-0) on Saturday but have yet 
to announce a starter for Sunday’s match-
up. Last week’s Sunday starter, Nick 
Pogue (1-0), allowed five runs on six hits 
through three innings.Florida will face redshirt senior Brian 
Van Belle (1-0) to open the series. Van 
Belle matched Mace’s six innings pitched 
in his first start but didn’t allow a single 
run in Miami’s Feb. 14 win against Rut-
gers.
Miami’s projected starters for the rest 
of the series are junior Chris McMahon (1-
0) for Game 2 and sophomore Slade Cec-
coni (1-0) for Game 3.
Florida still has a good chance to cause 
damage to Miami’s undefeated pitch-
ing corps. Through its first five games, 
UF has 51 runs, the third-most in coach 
O’Sullivan’s 13-year tenure with the 
Gators. The only seasons in which the 
Gators had more were in 2008 (58) and 
2015 (54).
A huge reason for Florida’s run-scor-
ing surge are hot starts from Jud Fabian, 
Austin Langworthy and Kirby McMullen.
Fabian leads the Gators with 10 hits, 
two home runs, seven RBI and nine runs 
scored through five games. The sopho-
more centerfielder has taken the early 
leap that coach O’Sullivan said he expect-
ed, making much more contact than in his 
freshman season, which he finished with 
a .232 batting average.
Langworthy has been a solid contribu-tor to begin his senior season in left field. 
UF’s leading returning home run hitter 
from a year ago has six hits, one home 
run and five RBI so far.
McMullen leads all starters with a .467 
batting average. The senior third baseman 
has tacked on seven hits with six runs 
scored and four RBI.
Miami has an arsenal of dangerous hit-
ters as well. Adrian Del Castillo and Gabe 
Rivera are supergiants in Miami’s star-
studded lineup.
Del Castillo has seven hits, two home 
runs, eight RBI and five runs scored in 
just 12 at bats. The sophomore catcher 
has been the Hurricane’s leading offen-
sive force so far.
Rivera has also been a major catalyst 
for Miami over its first four games. The 
junior outfielder has six hits, one home 
run, five RBI and four runs scored in 13 
at bats.
Florida trails in the all-time series 
124-130-1, and is 46-80 against Miami in 
Coral Gables. The Gators are 12-3 against 
the Hurricanes over their last 15 games, 
though, and have won the past five series.

SOFTBALL
By Payton Titus
Sports Writer
A labyrinth is a meandering, but meaning-
ful, maze designed to test the navigators and 
push them to their limits. The schedule this 
weekend will do just that for the Gators.
Florida (12-1) flew to Palm Springs, Califor-
nia, for the Mary Nutter Collegiate Classic early 
Thursday morning. It will spend its weekend 
in the softball equivalent of a labyrinth, slated 
to face four top-25 teams including No. 1 UCLA 
(11-0) and No. 5 Arizona (9-1).
The weekend begins with two games today 
against Arizona and No. 25 Northwestern (4-
5). On Saturday, Florida plays No. 16 Arizona 
State (9-2), followed by a matchup against de-
fending national champion UCLA. The week-end will wrap up with UF’s only unranked op-
ponent of the tournament in Nebraska (5-4) on 
Sunday.
“Designing a schedule the way we design 
a schedule, I want to see...how we respond to 
playing the No. 1 team in the country,” coach 
Tim Walton said about the weekend slate.
Arizona will head into this invitational fresh 
off its near-victory in exhibition against Team 
USA Tuesday night, in which designated hit-
ter Jessie Harper hit two home runs in back-
to-back innings — one was a three-run homer 
— to earn the Wildcats all four of their runs. It 
wasn’t until the Women’s National Team put 
Monica Abbot in the circle that the red, white 
and blue clinched the victory.
Step one to successfully navigating the 
labyrinth is to enter with a calm, cool and col-lected demeanor. According to junior Natalie 
Lugo, Florida can check that off its list.
“I think we’re just going to keep doing what 
we’re doing and hopefully our bats are work-
ing the way they’ve been working,” the pitcher 
said. “If I can’t get the whole game in, then I 
know I have my pitching staff behind me to 
pick me up.”
Once the navigator makes his of her way to 
the center — a feat in and of itself — he or she 
has a monster to conquer in the center and, if 
they survive, must still find their way out. This 
weekend’s journey will offer up the same chal-
lenge and opportunity for the Gators. They will 
venture toward their own center as a program 
and back out again to take on the remainder of 
their 2020 schedule.
The monster in the middle is one Florida has seen before, but, according to Walton, it 
has been ill-equipped to take it on in recent 
years. The Gators are 7-6 all-time against the 
Bruins, having lost their last three matchups. 
UCLA has started its season off with com-
manding statistics, outscoring opponents 102-
13 in the first 11 games. 
“They’re No. 1 in the country right now for 
a reason,” Walton said. “We didn’t play very 
well against them last year at all. Very talented, 
very athletic, they’re very confident, they’re 
very well prepared.”
The first pitch of the weekend for Florida is 
scheduled for 3:30 p.m. EST against Arizona.

GYMNASTICS

If you were to ask any member of the 
Gators gymnastics team, they would tell you 
that every Friday night in the O’Connell Cen-
ter is special.
There was one common theme that came 
out of the team this week, however.
This meet is not a normal meet, both in 
terms of the uniforms and the impact.
On Friday night, No. 2 Florida will host 
No. 8 Alabama at the O’Connell Center. The 
meet will kickoff at 5:45 p.m. and will be 
on the SEC Network. It is the only meet this 
weekend between two top-10 schools.
The difference in uniforms is the leotards 
the teams are wearing. Both schools will put 
aside their primary colors of orange and blue 
and crimson and white to wear pink.
This is the 14th annual “Link to Pink” 
event for the Gators. In last season’s event, 
UF defeated Auburn in dominating fashion 
(197.850-196.700).
“Link to Pink” aims to create awareness for breast cancer prevention and research,  
and it has a special place in the heart of 
many UF gymnasts and coaches.
“A lot of the girls have links to breast can-
cer,” senior Sierra Alexander said. “It means 
a lot to be able to go out and show off our 
skills in support of those brave women.”
It is especially personal for freshman Pay-
ton Richards, who has family members who 
have suffered from breast cancer.
“This meet, I am thinking about doing my 
best for my family and the others who are 
dealing with breast cancer,” she said.
But there is more that makes this meet 
different.
An SEC title is also on the line.
Heading into this weekend, the Gators (7-
0, 5-0 SEC) are the only undefeated team in 
the SEC. Right behind them is the Crimson 
Tide (4-3-1, 3-1 SEC). A UF win tonight will 
clinch its second-consecutive SEC regular 
season title.
Florida only has one more conference 
meet after Alabama on Feb. 28 against Geor-
gia.The Gators are coming off their best road 
performance of 2020, putting up a road sea-
son-high (197.875) in their demolishing of 
Auburn. This tied Florida’s second-highest 
score of the season.
Sophomore Trinity Thomas scored her 
second 10 on the beam in as many weeks 
and racked up her fourth-straight SEC Gym-
nast of the Week honor. Richards set a new 
career-high in vault (9.95) and won her first 
vault title. In total, four gymnasts equaled or 
set new career highs.
The Tide are coming off a two-meet 
homestand that saw it beat then-No. 21 Mis-
souri and then-No. 14 Arkansas. Its score 
against the Tigers (197.55) is a season high. 
Junior Lexi Graber’s all-around score (39.55) 
leads ’Bama’s all-arounders this season.
“Alabama is a tough competitor, always 
on their A game,” Rowland said. “We’ve got 
to go in and work hard and not take anything 
for granted.”

Rarely is a matchup between Florida 
and Kentucky meaningless. 
For much of the 2000s and 2010s, the 
two schools battled for SEC basketball su-
premacy. 
The Gators and the No. 10 Wildcats will 
renew the rivalry on Saturday in Lexing-
ton, Kentucky, with the SEC regular season 
crown potentially at stake. Kentucky (21-5, 
11-2 SEC) currently sits atop the SEC stand-
ings, with Florida (17-9, 9-4 SEC) a couple 
games behind. 
But with just ﬁ  ve games to go and an-
other game against each other in Gainesville 
on March 7, there is, somehow, still a path 
for the Gators to move up in the standings. 
Both teams come into this tilt in solid 
form. Florida has reeled off three straight 
double-digit wins since an ugly loss to Ole 
Miss and has won ﬁ  ve of its last six. The 
Wildcats have won ﬁ  ve in a row. 
On paper, an unranked team walking 
into Rupp Arena doesn’t bode well, but it 
was just two years ago when an unranked 
Gators team toppled then-No. 18 Kentucky 
66-64.The Wildcats’ rank indicates a normal 
year for the traditional powerhouse, but 
that hasn’t quite been true beyond that 
and the win-loss record. 
According to KenPom, this is a match-
up between the No. 28 (Kentucky) and 
No. 34 (Florida) teams in the country and 
the two best teams in the SEC. 
If the season ended today, that would 
be UK’s worst KenPom ﬁ  nish since it was 
55th in 2013. It’s been enough to be the 
best team in the SEC, but this is still a rela-
tively vulnerable UK team. 
Kentucky’s adjusted defensive ef-
ﬁ  ciency has slipped from eighth in the 
country last season to 53rd this season. 
Opponents’ ﬁ  eld-goal and three-point per-
centages have decreased from last season, 
but the Wildcats have been unable to force 
turnovers all year. Both their defensive 
turnover percentage and steal percentage 
are 303rd in the country, according to Ken-
Pom.
Despite the turnover issues, though, 
Kentucky has the best ﬁ  eld-goal percent-
age defensively in the conference at 38.5 
percent. 
Three of the seven best three-point 
shooters in the conference will be on the ﬂ  oor between guard Noah Locke (.445) 
and forward Keyontae Johnson (.391) 
for Florida and UK sophomore Immanuel 
Quickley (.391). Quickley is Kentucky’s 
leading scorer at 15.2 points per game and 
shoots over 90 percent from the charity 
stripe. 
For the Gators, coach Mike White likes 
what he has seen from Johnson, who 
has registered double-digit points in nine 
straight games. 
“The game has slowed down a little bit 
for him,” he said. “The other thing is he’s 
playing more minutes because he’s earn-
ing more minutes, because he’s defending 
and rebounding at a higher level.”
UF is currently 35th in the NET rank-
ings with three Quadrant 1 opportunities 
on the schedule to close the season (both 
Kentucky games and at LSU). The Gators 
seem likely to make the NCAA Tourna-
ment at this point, barring a total collapse 
to end the season, but they will have plen-
ty of opportunities down the stretch to im-
prove its seeding.
