The inside of the Hub may 
seem a little less crowded.
To keep students from aim-
lessly searching for a table with 
Chick-ﬁ  l-A in hand or sitting on the ﬂ  oor with an Einstein’s bagel, the exterior of the Hub is getting a facelift with some additional seating.
Chandler Rozear, project man-
ager of architecture/engineering with the UF Physical Plant Divi-sion, said the $350,000 renova-tion to the Hub will be better for trafﬁ  c ﬂ  ow and offer easier access into the Hub.
The redesigned plaza area will 
offer additional covered seating, a handicap ramp, tables and a covered bus shelter in front of the Chick-ﬁ  l-A entrance.
The area will no longer have 
the pavement or cement tables there previously. In addition to the changes, the plaza will have brick wall seating around each oak tree.
“This should make for very 
pleasant seating,” he said. “It will be very nice.”
Rozear said the initial plan to 
improve the area started about a year ago, and workers broke ground May 6. The project should be completed by the middle of Summer B, he said.
Rozear said one of the inter-
esting things about this project is that students will be able to watch the progress daily from in-side Chick-ﬁ  l-A.
Angelica Polley, a 19-year-old 
chemical engineering sophomore at UF, said she has been one of those people who has had to eat lunch on the ﬂ  oor in the Hub be-cause there was nowhere to sit.
Having additional space out-
side will be a good thing, she said.
“Even though there is a ton 
of seating inside, it still gets packed,” she said.
Eric Salaices agrees.Seating outside is limited, and 
having extra space will be useful, said the 21-year-old UF biology senior.
Salaices said he was glad that 
the construction was being done during the summer so that stu-dents would be able to enjoy the seating during the cooler months.
Because the Hub was the uni-
versity bookstore until 2003, UF spokesman Steve Orlando said changes are being made to ac-commodate students in such a centrally located area. 
“The function of that building 
has changed over time,” he said.

Gainesville’s third Original Food 
Truck Rally will take to the streets Sat-
urday with more vendors and more sounds.
The event will be hosted on the park-
ing lot of High Dive, 210 SW Second Ave., and will begin at 5 p.m.
Eleven vendors will sell food, in-
cluding three new vendors: local food truck Gotta Have It, Popcraft Artisan Popsicles of Alachua and Kona Dog, a Hawaiian-style hot dog vendor from Orlando. 
“What we’re trying to do is create a 
good mix of local vendors and feature some out-of-town vendors that you can’t see on a daily basis,” said Pat La-very, who helped found the rallies and handles promotions for High Dive. 
DJs from local radio station Grow 
Radio will set the mood outside, and live music from the Partials, Pilly Wete and Leela & the Rams will begin inside Food truck rally returns to High

After several complaints from residents, 
Gainesville Police launched a criminal in-
vestigation of the city-contracted Advantage Towing Company earlier this month.
Ofﬁ  cer Jeff McAdams, Gainesville Po-
lice’s towing administrator, said the investi-gation is ongoing. Three complaints that all pointed back to Advantage Towing Com-pany sparked the investigation, he said. Two complaints involved scooters that residents reported as stolen to GPD, he said, and the other complaint involved a car belonging to used car dealer Southeast Car Agency.
The car “somehow ended up on Advan-
tage’s lot after being towed,” McAdams said. He said the company, owned by Susan C. Forron, has operated in Gainesville under different names for more than 20 years. 
Police searched the ofﬁ  ce for evidence of improper lien or title transfer, improper or il-legal tow and grand theft auto. The company previously faced scrutiny when 10 separate cases were ﬁ  led April 18 against Forron for violating “prerequisites to towing vehicles parked on private property.” She is set to 
appear before a judge on noncriminal infractions May 30.
City Manager Russ 
Blackburn said the com-
pany could face conse-quences pending the re-sults of the investigation.
“The city’s ordinance 
would require sanctions 
for either of the events if deemed a violation of the ordinance,” he wrote in an email. “At the conclusion of the investigations, staff will take action based upon the results.”

Deer smashes bus wind shield, 
takes short ride 
JOHNSTOWN, Pa. — A deer 
has taken a ride on a western 
Pennsylvania bus.
The Johnstown Tribune-
Democrat newspaper reports the white-tailed deer crashed through the windshield of a public bus being driven Tuesday evening in Johnstown, about 65 miles east of Pittsburgh.
The deer hopped around 
frantically near the driver before jumping on empty seats and running in circles in the aisle.
Authorities say the driver 
stopped the bus and opened the door and the deer got off. Cambria County transportation spokesman Josh Yoder says it “just walked off the bus.”
The bus was carrying one 
passenger, who was seated in the back far from the deer. No injuries have been reported.
The bus has been taken to a 
maintenance facility for repairs.
There’s no word on what 
happened to the deer.
Man charged in overnight feast at 
supermarket 
MOUNT WASHINGTON, Ky. 
— Authorities in Kentucky have 
charged a man who officers say had an overnight feast in a closed supermarket outside Louisville.
The manager of a ValuMarket 
says he found 57 empty whipped cream cans in the garbage when he arrived Monday morning. WAVE-TV in Louisville reported 30-year-old Trevor Runyon was charged after he was found in the ceiling of the store.
Surveillance video from the 
store showed that Runyon cooked and ate six steaks, washed them down with beer and then topped off his meal with shrimp and birthday cake.
Police say Runyon slipped into 
the store and hid while employees closed it for the night.
Bullitt County Detention 
Center records show Runyon is from Shepherdsville, Ky. It wasn’t clear whether he has an attorney.
Ohio State awaits bloom of stinky 
corpse flower 
COLUMBUS, Ohio — 
Researchers at an Ohio State 
University greenhouse are awaiting a rare second bloom by a rainforest plant known as a corpse flower because of its unpleasant odor.
The university says the nearly 
6-foot titan arum is expected to open this week, releasing another round of its rotting-flesh smell a little more than two years after it first flowered.
A second corpse flower opened 
briefly at the greenhouse last May.
A university spokeswoman 
tells The Columbus Dispatch cultivators are lucky to have three blooms in three years. Each brief telegram, now displayed at the 
restaurant in Prague. “Major Hendrix connoisseurs are aware of it. It would have been one of the most insane supergroups. These four cats certainly reinvented their instruments and the way they’re perceived.”
The telegram raises more 
questions than it answers. It advises McCartney to contact producer Alan Douglas (whose first name is misspelled in the cable) if he could make the session. But it’s not clear if McCartney was even aware of the unusual, apparently impromptu invitation to rush from his London base to New York for the planned session.
Beatle aide Peter Brown replied 
on McCartney’s behalf, telling Hendrix the following day that McCartney was on vacation and not expected back for another two weeks.
The invitation came at an 
extremely awkward moment for the Beatles’ bassist. It was sent the same day a prominent New York City radio station gave wide exposure to a rumor that McCartney had died in a car crash and been replaced by a lookalike. 
It is not clear either how 
McCartney’s melodic, subtle bass playing would have made its presence felt in a band that included Hendrix’ guitar and Davis’ trumpet.
“At first, though, it sounds 
really weird and off the wall. But on second thought it makes perfect, Hendrix-type sense to chuck in someone who’s a great musician but comes from a different tradition,” said Hendrix biographer Charles Shaar Murray. “I regret this never actually took place. ... it would have been magnificent.”

NYPD officer tries to help cat in 
tree, gets stuck 
NEW YORK — Authorities 
say a New York police officer 
who went after a cat stuck in a tree got caught himself and needed a little help getting back down to the ground.
The Fire Department of New 
York says it happened Monday afternoon in Queens.
A call came in that a man 
attempting to get a cat out of a tree had gotten stuck. Fire department personnel used a bucket ladder to get the man and the cat down.
The fire department says the

1969 Hendrix telegram: Can 
Paul come to play?
LONDON — Miles and Jimi. 
Jimi and Miles. Fans of the late 
trumpet and guitar masters have long known that Miles Davis and Jimi Hendrix had been making plans to record together in the year before Hendrix’s sudden death in 1970.
But less attention has been 
paid to the bass player they were trying to recruit: Paul McCartney, who was busy with another band at the time.
This tantalizing detail about 
the super group that never was — jazz standout Tony Williams would have been on drums — is contained in an oft-overlooked telegram that Hendrix sent to McCartney at The Beatles’ Apple Records in London on Oct. 21, 1969.
“We are recording and 
LP together this weekend in NewYork,” it says, complete with typographical errors. “How about coming in to play bass stop call Alvan Douglas 212-5812212. Peace Jimi Hendrix Miles Davis Tony Williams.”
The telegram has been 
part of the Hard Rock Cafe memorabilia collection since it was purchased at auction in 1995. Still it has only generated attention in recent months with the successful release of “People, Hell & Angels,” expected to be the last CD of Hendrix’s studio recordings.
“It’s not something you 
hear about a lot,” Hard Rock historian Jeff Nolan said of the TODAY FRIDAY SATURDAY SUNDAY MONDAY

the club at 9 p.m. At the previous two ral-
lies, Lavery said, music was played from an iPod. 
UF alumnus Doug Trovillion, the 
owner of Kona Dog, said he decided to join the rally after hearing about the suc-cess of the March rally.
“The environment is ripe for people 
from larger areas where there are a lot of food trucks,” said Trovillion, who got inspiration for his food truck menu after being stationed in Hawaii with the Ma-rine Corps.
The long wait times that marked the 
first rally in January will be “a thing of the past” due to more vendors and an earlier starting time, Lavery said.
On the city level, Commissioner Lau-
ren Poe said the community develop-ment committee is considering reducing restrictions on mobile food vendors with-in city limits due to the popularity of the rallies. He said research into the impacts on established brick-and-mortar restau-rants in the area and traffic flow concerns will be considered in the discussion.
“It’s obviously something that’s been 
popular in the community,” Poe said. 
Lavery agreed that residents are back-ing the concept of making food truck ral-lies a regular event.
He said the rallies have created a wid-
er acceptance of food trucks in town and have inspired others to start their own food trucks locally. 
“This is a really cool thing that 
Gainesville wants,” Lavery said. 
Staff writer Kelcee Griffis contributed to 
this report.
“And the need for seating areas have 
changed as well.”
Regardless of the Florida heat, Or-
lando said he thinks students will make good use of the space.
“It’s become a really popular gather-
ing spot for students, mainly because of all the dining options in that vicinity,” he said. “And having outside seating gives students the option of enjoying the outdoors and fresh air.”

Students at UF are getting their 
money’s worth.
UF ranked 25th on a list of af-
fordable colleges with a high re-
turn on investment released by www.affordablecollegesonline.org. The website reviewed 875 fully accredited colleges with a total four-year tuition cost of less than $40,000.
The only other Florida school 
to make the top 50 was Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, which has a campus in Daytona Beach.
To calculate return on invest-
ment, the website subtracted the cost of each institution from the expected 30-year salary earned with a degree from the institu-tion. UF’s return on investment was $351,000.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando 
said the value of a UF degree stems from the idea that UF stu-dents are seen as invaluable in many industries. “A lot of companies look for 
UF graduates because they are well rounded, innovative and hardworking,” he said.UF has been recognized for its 
value before. 
In January, Kiplinger’s Per-
sonal Finance magazine ranked UF third in value for in-state stu-dents.
UF mathematics freshman Robert Taylor, 19, said although the list’s results were impressive, he wasn’t too surprised.
“We definitely don’t have a 
reputation of being a degree mill,” he said. “I feel like a degree here is actually worth something.”

A Gainesville man was ar-
rested Tuesday after he alleg-
edly took his girlfriend’s car keys and physically restrained her from leaving his house.
Christopher Lee Holtz, 18, 
was arrested on charges of sim-ple battery and false imprison-ment related to dating violence.
At about 8 p.m. Tuesday, 
Holtz and his girlfriend of three years were arguing in his front yard in the 1600 block of SE Third Ave., according to the report. 
Ira Keene, 49, who lived 
at the house with Holtz, said the couple was arguing about money and a credit card. He said Holtz had “deleted” the woman’s bank account. 
Just before 
the girlfriend 
arrived at the house, Keene said, he ques-tioned Holtz r e g a r d i n g some bor-rowed stereo equipment Keene said 
Holtz couldn’t account for. 
“He was in a bad mood,” 
Keene said.  
When Holtz’s girlfriend 
tried to leave in her car, Holtz grabbed her keys and refused to give them back, according to the police report. She continued to try to get into her car, but Holtz repeatedly blocked her path.
When she started kicking 
Holtz, he wrapped his arms around her and forced her in-side his house. He said he didn’t want the argument to disturb the neighbors, according to the report.
Holtz’s girlfriend tried to 
escape several times, but Holtz prevented her from leaving.
Keene was in the backyard 
when he heard the sound of glass shattering. The woman had broken a window next to the front door in an attempt to leave the house, according to the report.
Holtz was arrested at about 
9 p.m. and booked into the Ala-chua County Jail, where he re-mained as of press time with a bond of $20,000.

UF Performing Arts recently an-
nounced it will put on 76 performanc-
es during its 2013-2014 season lineup.
The season will feature six musi-
cals, including “Mamma Mia!” and “Hello, Dolly!”; banjoist Bela Fleck; a cappella group Straight No Chaser and a UF alumna’s new opera, The Red Silk Thread, according to UFPA’s website.
The selection process began about 
two years ago, UFPA Director Michael Blachly wrote in an email. Contempo-rary, pop, jazz, rock and blues artists book in a shorter time, Blachly said, so UFPA is still looking to add those genres to the season.
UF students respond well to Broadway musicals, dance companies and world performances, public rela-tions associate Todd Taylor wrote in an email.
“We also think students will be 
excited about Straight No Chaser and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy,” Taylor said.
Blachly said 28 of the 66 artists are 
repeat visitors to UF.
Students can purchase a single tick-
et to each UFPA event for $10, exclud-ing musicals. Tickets for musicals are $20 each for students.
UF education sophomore Shantall 
Pirie, 19, said she has attended perfor-mances for class and liked them.
“I would go on my own,” she said.For the full schedule, visit www.

Facebook users who declare their love on-
line may have a harder time getting over a 
breakup. 
Steve Whittaker, a psychology professor at 
the University of California, Santa Cruz, head-ed a team of researchers that found one-third of people cannot bring themselves to delete relationship photos from their proﬁ  le, causing them to suffer for a longer period of time.The study involved interviews with 24 
people who went through “valued digital and physical possessions that related to a recent breakup,” Whittaker wrote in an email. He then evaluated their coping strategies.
The study also found those who decide 
to delete digital memories from their proﬁ  les often regret it because they may want to look back on them. Still, some worry if their exes come back around, they may not forgive them for removing the pictures.
“A relationship change is one of those mile-
stones featured on Facebook, and though it’s painful at the time, if the relationship ended nicely, you may want to cherish it and learn from it,” said UF social media specialist Bruce Floyd. “But I can see there are certain circum-stances — such as an abusive relationship — where you may want to get rid of it.”
Some of the participants in the study ad-
mitted to immediately deleting their ex in or-der to cope with the sudden heartbreak.“I know a lot of friends who have to de-
lete their ex off their Facebook because it hurts to see them out living their life all happy . . . while you’re all sad and depressed,” said Genesis Lara, a 21-year old UF history junior.
Researchers proposed an application that 
could automatically detect anything related to a relationship and delete it — or at least store it away just in case of a second chance. 
“If Facebook creates some sort of delete 
application, I think there should be an undo function that remembers those changes so that they can get those memories back,” Floyd said.

OPINIONS EDITORIt’s been almost a whole month since our last edition of 
Darts & Laurels. We at the Alligator newsroom love to throw flowers at the do-gooders and little shafts of metal 
at the not-so-do-gooders. So, without further ado, we pres-ent our we-can-hardly-hold-back-any-longer edition of:
Darts & Laurels
Last month, the American Civil Liberties Union went to 
bat for Issak Wolfe, a transgender male high schooler from Pennsylvania. Although he applied to be prom king, the ballots listed him with his birth name under candidates for prom queen.  
Wolfe, partnered with the ACLU, has started a petition to 
present to the school board. “I want to make sure that future transgender students are not humiliated and disrespected the way I was,” he said.
Most of us don’t give too much thought to our gender 
identity. We’re born with boy or girl parts and the psycho-logical equipment to match. Some of us aren’t, though, and this is a confusing notion for those who don’t understand.
The Alligator stands in solidarity with those who have 
faced prejudice as a consequence of their gender identity. For this reason, we give our first-laurel-of-the-semester LAUREL to Issak Wolfe.
In other news, Mike Jeffries, CEO of Abercrombie & Fitch 
clothing stores, came under heavy fire this month for com-ments made in 2006. “We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don’t belong [in our clothes], and they can’t belong,” said Jeffries, emphasizing the necessity of maintaining a pristine, “cool kid” image for his brand. 
Now, you may be thinking the Alligator is going to jump 
on the bandwagon and chuck a dart at Jeffries. But we’re not. Instead, we’ll dispatch one DART into Greg Karber, who 
uploaded a video to YouTube this week chronicling his at-tempt at rebranding A&F clothes by handing them out to homeless people. We know you mean well, Greg, but the homeless don’t deserve such harsh treatment. Give A&F clothes to low-IQ jerks instead. Oh, wait.
This week, the head of the Associated Press filed a formal 
complaint with the Department of Justice for having its pros-ecutors secretly collect the records of calls made from tele-phone lines belonging to the AP as well as collecting records of calls made by AP journalists on their home phones. 
The press grilled White House spokesman Jay Carney this 
week, too. One reporter even asked Carney how the presi-dent feels about being compared to President Nixon. On the seizure of the phone records, Carney said, “The president is a strong defender of the First Amendment.”
We’ll see about that, Jay. We carefully hand an if-we’re-
not-careful-we’re-next DART to President Obama and the 
Department of Justice.
The last victim in our flinging-fest is Orlando’s favorite 
alternative newsweekly, the Orlando Weekly. Last month, they published an edition titled “Orlando Weedly” with a big image of a marijuana leaf on the cover to match. We award a massive, ganja-shaped LAUREL to the Orlando 
Weekly. Because legalized pot is the new black. Also, be-cause pot should be treated as a health issue rather than a criminal issue. 
Stay classy, Gators!
If you’re a freshman at UF, you might be able to buy a self-
driving car soon after you graduate. Google co-founder Sergey Brin predicted last fall that his company’s autono-
mous vehicles would be available to “everyday people” by 2017. The smart cars, guided by advanced software and un-dulating infrared lasers, have driven more than 300,000 miles without crashing. This could entail greater safety and conve-nience for UF students, including the ability to nap as your vehicle ushers you home from a late-night study session at Library West.
Liberated from the chore of driving, students in Gainesville 
would also have more freedom to consume visual interac-tive media. As part of a senior thesis, I spent four months researching how the cars might change the way we chat with our friends, follow the news and participate in our communi-ties. My interviews with technologists, advertisers and mass media historians revealed the following three takeaways.
First, self-driving cars might eliminate what I call “dead 
time”: several hours per week when we can’t consume media other than radio because our eyes are — or, at least, should be — glued to the road. Pew Research Center trends suggest students would spend at least some of the time using laptops and smartphones. Peter Stone, a Texas-based com-puter scientist who has studied self-driving vehicles for over a decade, told me existing gadgets could be integrated with Web-connected touch screens in cars. Eliminating dead time also means exposing new battleground in the war to capture commuters’ attention. Advertisers value the commuter audi-ence because it’s large, diverse and captive.
My second takeaway concerned mobility. If you’ve ever endured a weed-out course for your ma-
jor — like reporting or thermodynamics — you know it can shrink a student’s world. Between wresting and hitting the books, some find it hard to travel for social events like Gator games. Self-driving cars will facilitate shorter, cheaper com-mutes that let you travel without flunking your exams. Us-ing a combination of sensors, cameras and digital maps, they can select the fastest route in real time. Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt described it as “Google 
Maps on steroids.” 
Meanwhile, they permit radical changes to the traffic sys-
tem. In one simulation, Stone and his colleagues removed stoplights from an intersection. What ensued was a tech-nological ballet; computer-driven vehicles used sensors to swerve gracefully around each other without stopping.
Third, people who communicate for a living can use self-
driving cars to make their target audiences act. Consider Tur-lington Plaza, for example. As I walked through the area one afternoon, someone handed me an ad for a health-related study. Although I wanted to participate, I ended up trashing the handbill because I lacked time and energy to heed the call to action, even though the message resonated with me.
Slamming shut the gap between awareness and action is 
one of the greatest challenges facing strategic communica-tors, UF public relations professor Ann Christiano said.
Self-driving cars are unique in that they can expose a 
viewer to an ad, then ask her if she wants to be transported to a location specified by the advertiser. The tactic could help groups like the Red Cross appeal to volunteers, for example, or assist a bipartisan get-out-the-vote campaign in register-ing more citizens. Professor Clay Calvert, an expert in media law at UF, said in-vehicle touch screens might even feature a visualization of Republican and Democratic households, al-lowing canvassers to focus on like-minded constituents. 
Of course, none of these predictions can be cast in stone. A 
litany of legal and political issues remain, making it hard to tell if Gator alumni five years from now will be able to release their grip on the steering wheel. 
Yet one thing appears certain: The technology is poised to 
revolutionize how UF students engage with media.

We all know the drill. You see an acquain-
tance from afar. You don’t really feel like talking to him, so you pull out your cell-
phone and feign interest in it. You keep your eyes glued to the screen so you don’t make eye contact with the person you’re avoiding. Once you’re at a safe distance, the relief sets in that you’ve dodged the proverbial bullet that is face-to-face interaction. 
I’m guilty of this action on a daily basis, but upon 
reflection, it really is quite disturbing. Using a cell-phone as a crutch for avoiding human interaction is simply unhealthy.
Our minds seem to be reprogramming themselves 
to require visual stimuli beyond what is physically in front of us. If a real conversation pauses, it has be-come a knee-jerk reaction to pull out our phones and look at them until one of us thinks of something else to say. Cellphones have gone from an accessory for communication to our main mode of communication — a fact that I believe to be a problem.
We are forgetting the importance of real, live 
conversation. True, unscripted and genuine convers-ing is going by the wayside while text messaging is becoming our main tool for communication. Think about the last time you said something you regret-ted in a face-to-face conversation, even if it was just something like a you-had-to-be-there story that no one found interesting. If you’re anything like me, it probably wasn’t too long ago that you said some-thing you wish you could take back. 
These conversational flubs occur because talking 
in person is real, spontaneous and rich. In my opin-ion, you only truly find out who someone is when you have an abundance of real, live interaction. Real conversations leave no time for editing, deleting or molding the perfect statement. All of these perks to texting are likely reasons why most of us prefer to use this electronic method to verbal communication.
People aren’t sacrificing their cell phones to have 
actual conversations with the people around them. Regional Transit System buses are filled with heads looking down at screens. And if, God forbid, some-one does try to strike up a 
conversation, we’re likely to assume that that person is either crazy or must have forgotten his or her cell-phone at home. Couples at dinner spend more time scrolling through their Facebook news feeds than carrying on conversation with one another. 
It is time for a change.Throughout our lifetimes, the technology of digi-
tal devices has expanded from practically nonexis-tent to a simply unavoidable commodity. Through the accessibility of these devices, we have created a world of screens. Our obsession with, and perhaps even addiction to, cell phones and Internet access has created an environment where so much is said, but very little is heard, and our real life relationships are suffering because of it. Use your phone as a tool for communication, an accessory to your arsenal, not a crutch for avoidance.
Next time you go out to eat with friends or a 
significant other, try leaving your phone in the car. Your phone is not a baby. You’re allowed to leave it alone with the windows up, I promise. Check your Facebook once in the morning and once at night, re-gardless of how boring the people around you may seem. If you see an old acquaintance, don’t pull out your phone to avoid the conversation. Just say “hel-lo.” Seriously, try it — it’s really not that scary. Use Facebook, Twitter and text messaging to schedule face-to-face interaction — just don’t say “face-to-face interaction,” or people will think you’re strange, and they probably won’t show up. And finally, be sure to stop and smell the roses — you don’t always have to Instagram them.

In one month, the Supreme 
Court will decide Fisher v. Uni-versity of Texas, a case that has 
the potential to dramatically alter the college admissions process. In 2008, Abigail Fisher was denied ad-mission to the University of Texas at Austin. She now argues that her rejection in favor of less qualified minority applicants violated her 14th Amendment rights. The Uni-versity of Texas appealed to prec-edent: in 2003, the Supreme Court deemed that racial profiling of ap-plicants in university admissions was permissible in the name of pursuing diversity. However, that decision may soon be overturned. Even if the Supreme Court does not overturn its past ruling, the underlying question still remains: to what extent should race and eth-nicity be considered in college ad-missions, if at all?
Does a difference in appear-
ance directly indicate different and unique ways of thinking? Probably not. I would argue that two individ-uals from the same socioeconomic background are much more similar than their racial differences may suggest. To achieve a truly diverse student body, admission prefer-ences should instead be given to applicants who strive to succeed in the face of socioeconomic dispar-ity. This sort of inclusiveness lends itself to both cultural and socioeco-nomic diversity and to social mo-bility, while u p h o l d i n g racial and ethnic equal-ity.
Some have argued that the sud-
den exclusion of racial and eth-nic categorization may result in a harmful demographic redistribu-tion of college students. When the University of California was forced to stop using affirmative action, this initially led to a large increase in the number of Asian students and a decline in the number of other minority students. However, as of late, the numbers have shown the reverse: under this meritocracy, all minority groups have seen in-creased enrollment. It is clear that meritocracy actually benefits the pursuit of racial and ethnic diver-sity and equality. A meritocracy evaluates character, not color.
Race and ethnicity should not be 
blanketing characteristics in college admissions. To foster diversity, ad-mission preferences should only be given in cases of socioeconomic disparity; race itself should never differentiate applicants. The cur-rent evidence suggests that there is injustice within the system, but a correction to this may come as soon as June.

Spring cleaning is a phrase 
that most dread hearing, but for 
Gainesville residents, the process can now be completed in an effi-cient, “green” way.
In an effort to provide an envi-
ronmentally friendly cleaning ser-vice to Gainesville, Mary Moore decided to create Green Clean Homes.
She noticed Gainesville locals 
bringing reusable bags to grocery stores and residents using bicycles instead of cars. After reading some articles on an entrepreneurship website, she realized Gainesville didn’t have a green cleaning ser-vice. So, she opened her unique business to reflect this sentiment.
Moore decided Green Clean 
Homes would be a service that offers environmentally friendly cleaning practices along with a lux-urious experience.
“With everyone wanting to go 
green, I thought it would be a need here (in Gainesville),” Moore said.
Moore explained that she had 
been doing her part to help the environment long before it was the popular thing to do. Living in St. Augustine, she would take a weekly trip to the St. John’s River to pick up trash. Nowadays, Moore encourages people to reuse water bottles, carpool when possible and pay closer attention to water and light usage.
“Starting (this business) has 
sort of regenerated my passion for wanting to be environmental-ly friendly and to be as green as I can,” she said.
Moore got the idea in early 
April, and by April 24, it was an official business. Four steps were completed for this to happen.
“The first step was making the 
decision to do it,” Moore said. “After I debated for a couple of weeks on if I should do it and if it would work, I finally made the deci-
sion.”  
The second step for Moore was 
researching trademarked names in a Florida database to make sure there wasn’t another business that went by the same exact name. After that, she went on www.sunbiz.org to purchase the name. The fourth step was going to the City of Gainesville and registering Green Clean Homes as a business. Reporting the opening to the local newspaper is a requirement by the city, and from there a website was started, along with the creation of business cards and other methods of advertising.
Green Clean Homes cleans of-
fices and residences in Gainesville, Jonesville, Newberry and Alachua counties.
Employee Maisie Johnson, who 
also works for Moore’s Aloha Pet Sitting and Dog Walking compa-ny, is excited to work for a busi-ness that is the first of its kind in Gainesville.
“(It is) pretty neat that I get to 
experience this first hand with her,” Johnson said. “I had never heard of green cleaning businesses before, so I think this is a really great idea for the area.”
The company uses eco-friendly 
products to clean, but that is only part of what it does to stay envi-ronmentally friendly. In addition, Moore says recycling and avoiding paper usage is important, too. That is why her employees use recycled newspapers to clean mirrors and other glass surfaces. Moore’s busi-ness provides extras such as aro-matherapy oil diffusion and turn-down service on linens. Organic chocolates are placed on pillows as a finishing touch. The service costs $60 per hour for a two-person team; a two-hour minimum is re-quired per appointment.
“It is a resort-style luxury,” 
Moore said, “like staying in a five-star hotel in your own home.”

Summer is a time for movies and a time for love. This 
week’s What To Watch movie combines them both.
Directed by the over-the-top Baz Luhrmann, “The Great 
Gatsby” is as visually stunning as you’d expect.
Unlike the next few weeks’ upcoming releases, it’s the 
perfect summer date movie.
And in what seems like a Hollywood miracle, the movie 
seems to follow the book quite well.
The highlight of the movie is the rap-filled soundtrack. 
It seems weird for a movie set in the early 1900s where jazz 
ran rampant, but it works.
Especially in the hotel scene with Myrtle: The bass drop 
seems 100 percent on target.
The soundtrack brings something for the guys, while the 
movie’s story will draw in all the females.
Running at two hours and 22 minutes, “The Great Gats-
by” is rather long. The last hour of the movie drags on to the point where you realize the producer could have cut about 30 minutes and there would still be a complete story.
With that being said, “The Great Gatsby” is a worthy 
way to kick off your summer moviegoing.What To Watch

Dear Mediocre Advice,
Since guys have an orgasm during most sexu -
al encounters, how does a woman know if she’s 
truly good at sex and her skills are up to par?
Dear Friend,
There is no way to know how good you are in bed. 
Surprise! Everyone has lied about the quality of his or 
her sexual encounters at least once. Women fake or -
gasms and men fake interest. With all of this pretending it is difficult to know how good your sexual skills truly are. Unless he flat-out tells you how well or poorly you scored, there is no way to know. Even if he does con -
fess that you rocked his world —  leaving a permanent void in his little soul knowing he could never find another woman to top you — you would still have to trust that opinion. Trust your gut and don’t overthink this. You’re not a stripper or a show dog. Do what you want in bed, and if there is no chemistry between you and whomever 
you’re boning, then hit it and quit it.Dear Mediocre Advice,
My “partner” and I have been 
going out a lot lately, but he still won’t call me “his.” This has been going on for months. What should I do to let him know this 
bothers me?
Dear Friend,
Call him out on it. Don’t pretend to be 
OK with something you’re not, because it will come back to bite you in the ass. You’re not asking for too much: You need to be selfish about some things in your re -
lationship. Whether this is a deal-breaker situation or something you can come to a compromise on, you need to commu -
nicate with him. If you don’t come to a negotiation, don’t settle. Do not sacrifice your happiness by molding yourself to fit another person’s needs.Dear Friend,
Your friends lied. Being the nice 
guy is a bad thing. Nice guy refers to someone you like, but are in no way romantically interested in and proba -
bly never will be. This cursed name is only used to soften the blow of rejec -
tion, but guys aren’t complete dum -
mies. Guys know being called nice means they have no shot with the person who deems them nice guys. In return, they mistakenly take this for “I’d like you if you were more of an asshole.” You don’t need to be an as -
shole; you just have to accept the fact that not every girl you like will recipro -
cate the feeling. Dear Mediocre Advice,
A lot of my girl friends say 
I’m a “nice guy” and I get de-fensive. They say it’s not a bad thing, but how can it be a good thing?

The summer is the time to relax, start 
a job or internship or take a couple of 
classes. After ﬁ  nals, it can be hard to move back home and readjust to our typical di-ets. Most of us go through phases  of what we eat on a daily basis, but now is the time to try something new (and not the cookie butter at Trader Joe’s). We’ve come up with three ways to adjust our diets to the summer, starting with the best: drinks.
Drinks
Mojitos: Whether you’ve been work-
ing in an ofﬁ  ce from 9-5 or have spent the day by the pool,  nothing beats a sweet, refreshing mojito after a hot summer day. The key to a great mojito is  having just enough of each ingredient – sugar, rum, club soda, mint and lime – and the right  tools – a muddler and shot glass. Instead of sugar, I make simple syrup with two parts sugar and  one part water (either on the stove or in the microwave) so that it dissolves into the drink. I also  use Rose’s Lime Juice in addition to fresh lime.  
Juices: I have to admit I don’t know 
much about juicing, but I do know fruits and vegetables will always be good for you and, when in season, always delicious. The possibilities are nearly endless, but I love using carrots, oranges and apples.
Fruits
Now’s the time to take advantage of 
what’s in season, especially fruits. Watermelon, which 
is about 90 percent wa-ter, is mildly sweet and incredibly juicy. When I was  younger, we would dip chunks of watermel-on into the ocean and eat them. It also goes well in 
a  salad mixed with feta cheese and home-made vinaigrette.
This is the time to get Florida avocados. 
Usually, when you think of avocados, you think of  guacamole. But there are so many ways to incorporate the fruit into break-fast, lunch and dinner. 
Skip the mayonnaise on sandwiches 
and instead spread some avocado on them. Or, serve avocado slices on  top of curry chicken, homemade soup or fresh tacos.Starfruit can be candied, used in drinks 
or added to a summer salad. It’s slightly sweet (or sour  when unripe) and a vibrant addition to any dish you prepare this sum-mer.
GrillingVegetables: Have you ever had grilled 
vegetable  kebabs? Zucchini, mushrooms and sweet onions are best seared on the grill, no seasoning  necessary.
Meat and ﬁ  sh: Instead of roasting a 
chicken or defrosting frozen mahi-mahi, why not try searing and  roasting on the grill? Recently, my dad and I tried roasting a leg of lamb on a charcoal grill. We seared the lamb on hot coals, moved the coals aside to add more coals and a drip pan, and covered the grill for about two hours.Changing your diet for summer: don’t fall prey to bad habitsReboot12, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, MAY 16, 2013

World of Beer is the newest bar in Newberry that boasts 
more than 500 bottles and 40 drafts from around the globe. 
After its grand opening Monday, May 6, this watering hole was christened into, and perhaps now leads the ranks of, the top places to satisfy a thirsty, variety-craving beer palate.
Courtney Girgis, a 27-year-old third-year UF art history 
graduate student, was more than impressed by the World of Beer scene.
“I cannot believe how many beers they have to offer here,” 
she said, nearly shouting through the loud volume of Satur-day night’s copious crowd. “The menu is page after page long of beers I had never, ever heard of — I’m so glad they give descriptions of almost all of them!”
Girgis certainly was not exaggerating, for even the most 
critical craft beer snob will surely be challenged by the delec-table selection of pale ales, lagers, malts and pilsners served. Combine this spread with a stage for live music, an outdoor patio and an abundance of flat screens broadcasting sporting events, and World of Beer nails the atmosphere for a perfect hang spot.
World of Beer is located about seven miles west of campus 
in the Tioga Town Center. Never fear, this only adds to its charm — a close yet clean break from the Midtown and down-town shenanigans is well worth a cab fare. Impressive turnout on Saturday night at new World of Beer Beer

In honor of American Craft Beer Week from May 13-19, this is for those of you in need of a solid beer-
hopping guide that lends world-class variety while keeping you closer to campus. The following list should 
provide a good start for such ventures. One thing to note: locals in Midtown, the two swelteringly scuzzy blocks of debaucherous ground near Library West, are missing. Let this land reign as the destination for ultra-domestic, albeit inexpensive, taps and bottles.
House of Beer
19 W. University Ave.
Located on the same block as Stubbies 
& Steins, HOB offers more than 40 taps and 
has great deals throughout the week.  Hoggetowne Ale Works

ing your own brew? The folks at Hoggetowne Ale Works have all of the supplies and insight you’ll need.       Best local spots to grab a beer

Cottonmouth still holds as

Stubbies & Steins
9 W. University Ave.
More than 10 years old and dubbed 
“Gainesville’s premier destination for beer,” Stubbies & Steins offers substantial competi-tion to World of Beer’s selection, with nearly 400 bottles and 24 draft choices available. They also offer eclectic art painted on the walls, as well as kickass fries that are oh so good at the end of the night.    Hogan’s 
2327 NW 13th St. and 5156 SW 34th St.
Hogan’s offers some of the best sub sandwiches you’ll ﬁ  nd anywhere. 
They also have an international beer club: Complete your punch card

Tipple’s
2440 SW 76th St. #110
Tipple’s is a store that offers tastings. A deﬁ  nite must if you want to 
bring the best bottle to the next BYOB.
Brass Tap
3833 SW Archer Road, Building B
This spot opened within the year, and offers a great atmosphere 
similar to that of downtown. Worth a visit if you need a change of scen-ery. Parking is limited, and the surrounding areas are notorious for tick-eting, though, so be prepared to park and walk.
The Queen’s Arms Pub
5323 SW 91st Terrace
I love this spot. Nestled in the village of Haile Plantation, the 
Queen’s Arms Pub reincarnates a traditional Mediterranean pub environment—think of it as a mini Euro retreat.    Tall Paul’s

The Gators will soon have a 
chance for revenge.
The No. 1 Florida women’s ten-
nis team goes head-to-head with 
No. 15 Duke at 10 a.m. on Friday in the NCAA Round of 16 in Ur-bana, Ill.
The Blue Devils swept the 
Gators 4-0 in the regular season, making it one of Florida’s only two losses during the 2013 season.
Despite Florida’s loss to Duke 
in February, coach Roland Thorn-qvist said facing Duke’s lineup for the NCAA match will be a differ-ent challenge. 
“The fact that Duke is in the 
Round (of) 16 is just a remarkable achievement,” Thornqvist said. 
“With four scholarship players 
and a soccer player [Nicole Lipp] in the lineup… I know how diffi-cult it is to be down two points al-most before the match even starts, so the fact that they’ve made it this far is just really impressive. We’ll have to be ready for a powerful, yet short Duke team.”
2012 ACC Player of the Year 
Beatrice Capra was expelled from Duke earlier this spring due to an academic violation. Down a vet-eran player, the Blue Devils’ ros-ter continued to take hits. Junior Rachael Kahan and sophomore Monica Turewicz are both out for the rest of the season due to injuries. Duke’s roster now only contains five healthy players. The Blue Devils will have to forfeit a singles match and may give op-ponents going forward a lead in before match play.
Thornqvist said the possibility 
of gaining the 1-0 lead won’t give the Gators any greater chance to win.
“They give us a lead going into 
it, but it is what we make it to be,” Thornqvist said. “If we’re up 1-0 before the match even starts, that’s great, but that doesn’t mean that we cross the finish line any-time sooner.”
Florida has done well histori-
cally against Duke, leading 35-5 in the all-time series, sweeping the Blue Devils in NCAA Champion-ship matchups, 6-0.
Thornqvist said the key for the 
Gators’ success has always been to remain calm against tough op-ponents.
“This team, with the five re-
turning players, has shown that in the past we’ve been able to han-dle our nerves, and that has re-ally separated us from some other teams,” Thornqvist said. “Now, that’s a great thing to have in your back pocket.” 
After grabbing two doubles 
match victories in the NCAA first and second rounds, Thornqvist said his team is better in doubles after working on playing inside the service box. He said the Gators are as fit and ready as they can be.
“I think everyone feels relief 
that they know we’re ready for it,” Thornqvist said. 
“That’s what you try to urge 
or tell your team. When you get to this point, you want to feel like you’re prepared, and then you can live with whatever happens.”

The Florida men’s golf team will tee off postsea-
son play today when it competes in the Baton Rouge 
Regional of the 2013 NCAA tournament. 
The regional will pit the Gators against some fa-
miliar foes. Of the 22 teams invited to Baton Rouge, five other squads are from the Southeastern Confer-ence. However, coach Buddy Alexander does not think familiarity will be a factor in the tournament.
“It doesn’t matter that you’re familiar with some 
SEC foes,” Alexander said. “That’s the nature of golf, you kind of focus on what you’re doing instead of what your opponent’s doing.”
Florida will compete against several ranked SEC 
teams, including No. 2 Alabama, No. 17 LSU and No. 24 Mississippi State. Each of the Gators’ five golfers will play with a member of the Crimson Tide in their first-round groupings, as well as a member of the Tigers, who are playing on their home course.
“I think we’re ready to play,” Alexander said. “We 
haven’t played in a while, and last time we played we didn’t play particularly well. I think there’s been a little more intensity in the effort they’ve put into it.”
The intensity and effort will be needed to cor-
rect some of the issues that led to Florida shooting a combined 40 over par for a 10th-place finish at the SEC tournament on April 21. Another problem is the team’s lineup going into the tournament, which Al-
exander is shaking up.
“We’re going to play Tommy 
Mou instead of A.J. Crouch,” he said. “A.J.’s a freshman, and he didn’t play particularly well in the SEC tournament. I think Tommy’s 
more consistent.”
Crouch shot a team worst 21 
over par in the SEC tournament, 
and Alexander hopes Mou will add the stability needed to advance past the regionals and onto the finals. 
Mou will start things off for the Gators in the 8 
a.m. group. He will be followed by sophomore Eric Banks at 8:10, sophomore J.D. Tomlinson at 8:20, se-nior T.J. Vogel at 8:30 and senior Tyler McCumber at 8:40.UF golf to begin NCAA Regional

Johnny Magliozzi has been 
Florida’s most consistent 
pitcher in 2013. But with one series left in the regular sea-son, his role still has not been defined.
The right-hander has 
pitched 26 times this season, but recently, coach Kevin O’Sullivan added Magliozzi to the rotation with promising results. The sophomore tossed seven innings against Auburn on Saturday and surrendered three runs in Florida’s 5-4 win.
O’Sullivan announced his 
starters for the Gators’ (28-25, 13-14 Southeastern Confer-ence) first two contests of a three-game set against Geor-gia (19-30, 5-18 SEC), tabbing junior Jonathon Crawford and sophomore Bobby Poyner for Game 1 and 2, respectively. O’Sullivan left the Saturday spot open – a job Magliozzi might fill.
“If we get in a situation 
where we need to close him on Thursday, we’ll use him in that role,” O’Sullivan said. 
“If we get in a must-win 
situation … we’ll probably start him.”
Magliozzi’s solid starts 
have added consistency to a pitching staff that has nine pitchers who have made a start this season. He went Closer juggles rolesRyan Jones/Alligator s taff

Connecting our donors to our patients�HORTON HIT HOME RUN 
OFF SEC PITCHER OF THE YEAR. 
  LANDON WATNICK
 Alligator Staff Writer
 
  With Florida down 2-0 to Mis-
souri in the bottom of the second 
Saturday night, senior outﬁ  elder Kelsey Horton came to bat with a chance to even the score.
  Sophomore Lauren Haeger 
was on second base as Horton stepped to the plate against Chel-sea Thomas – the Southeastern Conference Pitcher of the Year. Thomas had not allowed a home run for 32 consecutive innings, dating back to April 7 against Alabama.
  But Horton sent Thomas’ ﬁ  rst 
pitch of the at-bat past the center-ﬁ  eld fence.
  Her two-run blast tied the 
game at 2 and was Florida’s ﬁ  rst hit of the contest. The Gators then piled on nine hits – two of them home runs – to cruise past the Ti-gers 10-4 for their ﬁ  rst SEC Tour-nament title since 2009.  
  “It of course improves my con-
ﬁ  dence,” Horton said. “But how I got there – just thinking about myself and not worrying about pitchers – that’s what I want to keep doing moving forward.” 
  Added coach Tim Walton: 
“We were clutch. To get clutch hits – runners on second base with two outs – you’ve got to ﬁ  nd a way to score runners. And that was the biggest difference, for me, in our team’s success over the weekend.”
  During Florida’s ﬁ  nal two 
games of the conference tourna-ment, Horton racked up three RBI on two hits and drew one walk 
  Now, Horton – one of UF’s 
two seniors – will be tasked with leading a talented but young Gators squad with 12 under-classmen into its NCAA Tourna-ment regional, where it will host Hampton on Friday at 6 p.m. at Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium. 
  USF and Georgia Southern , 
winners of the Big East and South-ern Conference tournaments, respectively, are also in second-seeded Florida’s regional. Hamp-ton won the Mid-Eastern Atlantic Conference Tournament.
  “A lot of times, you say, 
‘Wow, this is going to be one of those regionals where it’s really dangerous because of those three teams winning conference cham-pionships,’” Walton said. “But we also won a conference cham-pionship, so I think it’s going to be a great tournament.”
  UF was seeded No. 5 national-
ly in 2012 but fell to Florida Gulf Coast and USF in the Gainesville Regional. Florida dismissed three starters from the team hours be-fore NCAA Tournament play due to an off-ﬁ  eld incident. 
  Florida’s freshmen, who hit a 
combined .333 last weekend, were not a part of its disappointing ﬁ  n-ish last year. But Horton’s ready to provide Florida with postsea-son experience in the middle of 
its batting order.  
  “It’s exciting to be a national 
seed, and we’re excited to be No. 
2,” Horton said. “But we know that it’s going to be tough no mat-ter what seed you are.” 
Merritt earns honor: On Tues-
day, freshman Kirsti Merritt was named the Louisville Slugger/National Fastpitch Coaches Asso-ciation Division I National Player of the Week. Merritt earned the distinction after a strong show-ing at the SEC Tournament in Lexington, Ky., last weekend. 
  “This is very exciting, but our 
success last weekend was a team effort,” Merritt said in a release. “Everyone really stepped up in the SEC Tournament, and we had a lot of fun in Lexington playing the game we love.”
  During the conference tour-
nament, Merritt batted .455 and notched a team-high seven RBI, including ﬁ  ve in UF’s 8-4 quar-terﬁ  nal win against Alabama on Thursday. She also knocked two homers. 
  This season, Merritt has hit 
.305 with eight doubles, four tri-ples, six home runs and 29 RBI. 
  “Kirsti played a huge role,” 
Walton said in a release. “She had a lot of clutch RBIs and hits – several with two outs and two strikes. This honor is an exclama-tion point to how fun she was to watch play last week.”

Sophomore more effective in relief
more than five innings in both of 
his starts. With the exception of outings from Crawford and Ma-gliozzi, the Gators had only 10 starts of five innings or longer this season 
However, while Magliozzi has 
been solid in the rotation, he has been better out of the pen.
In his 12.2 innings as a starter, 
he has an ERA of 4.26 and aver-aged 5.9 strikeouts per nine in-nings pitched.
But in his 24 outings as a reliev-
er, Magliozzi’s ERA is 1.54, and he averages nearly eight strikeouts per nine innings.
“Whatever coach wants me to 
do, I’ll do,” Magliozzi said. “I’ll have to close, I’ll have to start; I just want to pitch.”
Magliozzi has locked down the 
late innings of games when in the closer role. The sophomore has all 11 of Florida’s saves and has an ERA of 2.29 in the ninth inning. He has given up only one ninth-inning run since March 19.
If Magliozzi does stay in the rotation, the Gators would need other arms in the bullpen to fill in at closer. One candidate would be sophomore Ryan Harris, who has the second-best ERA on the team at 2.65 – .47 higher than Magliozzi.
“The later half of the bullpen 
will step up,” Harris said. “We’ll be just fine without him in the back of the bullpen.”
Magliozzi said he added a 
new pitch to his repertoire that might add to his effectiveness, and O’Sullivan said he has no problem with the sophomore throwing it in a game situation.
“I started throwing a little cut-
ter,” Magliozzi said. 
“I haven’t really thrown it in 
a game yet. I’m trying to get it to go into lefties, pretty good outside pitch to righties.”
Added O’Sullivan: “If he’s con-
fident with it, I’m confident with it.”
Gators fighting for playoff 
spot: With three games left in the regular season, Florida remains on the bubble for a bid in an NCAA Regional. The Gators square off against a struggling Bulldogs team with a chance to gain momentum going into the SEC Tournament and vault themselves into a better position for the national playoffs.
“The bottom line is we got to go out and play a little bit better than we have,” O’Sullivan said. 
At three games over .500, Flori-
da still has an opportunity to reach the NCAA Regionals. In 2012, four teams that finished three games over .500 or worse made the NCAA Tournament.The Gators have not missed the 
NCAA Regionals since 2007, when Florida finished 29-30.
“We put ourselves in posi-
tion to control our own destiny,” O’Sullivan said.

� JUNIOR APPLYING FOR WAIVER TO 
PLAY IN 2013-2014.
PHIL HEILMAN
Alligator Staff Writer
After announcing his intent to transfer 
to Florida via his Twitter on April 30, for-
mer Rutgers guard Eli Carter gave his of-ficial notification to the school on Friday.
Carter, who played two seasons at Rut-
gers and averaged 14.3 points in 56 games (46 starts), is attempting to receive a waiver from the NCAA that would allow him to play for the Gators at the start of next sea-son. Carter transferred to Florida in the wake of the Mike Rice scandal at Rutgers.“I’m excited to get down to Florida,” 
Carter said in a release, “and I can’t wait to start gelling with the team and the coach-es.” 
Carter is the second former Rutgers lead-
ing scorer to transfer to Florida in the past four seasons. The first, Mike Rosario, led UF in scoring with 12.5 points per game last season -- his second in a Gators uniform. 
But Florida center Patric Young believes 
Carter will prove to be a different type of player than Rosario despite their similar backgrounds. 
While Rosario was better known for his 
three-point shooting — he was second on the team with 166 attempts last season — Carter’s greatest offensive strength is his ability to get to the rim. 
“Some people might 
say Mike Rosario was a little insane at time with the shot selection that he took,” Young said dur-ing an interview at The 
Players Championship on May 8.
 “I don’t think we have 
to worry about that with [Carter].
“He will come in and be able to get to 
the basket a lot better than our guards have been able to in the past and just change the whole dynamic of our team.”
As a freshman in 2011-12, Carter turned 
heads in a matchup against the Gators on Dec. 29. He scored a game-high 31 points on 12-of-24 shooting during an 85-83 Scar-let Knights double-overtime victory. 
Florida saw seniors Rosario and Kenny 
Boynton graduate. The two guards were two of the Gators’ top three scorers in 2012-2013 and combined for an average of 24.5 points per game.  
Carter joins a backcourt led by Scottie 
Wilbekin and Michael Frazier II. In addi-tion to Carter, the Gators will bring in five-star recruit Kasey Hill.
“I’m really excited about him,” said 
Young, who hosted Carter during his visit to UF. “He’s just a great kid.”

Although it has existed as a program for 
fewer than four years, Florida has already 
developed an out-of-conference rival in Syra-cuse.
They’ve played each other in an NFL stadi-
um, a college football field and in UF’s Donald R. Dizney Stadium.
However, when the teams meet on Satur-
day at 2 p.m. with a trip to the Final Four at Villanova on the line, the Gators will be play-ing in completely new conditions -- indoors
“I hear it’s a wonderful venue,” coach 
Amanda O’Leary said of Syracuse’s Carrier Dome. “It’s beautiful. Other than that, I don’t know much about it.”

and lost to the upstart Gators, 16-11.
Last season, Syracuse won on the road in 
double overtime 12-11 and again in double overtime in the national semifinals in Stony Brook, N.Y., 14-13.
Florida (18-2) evened the series in March 
with a 14-10 win in Miami at Sun Life Stadi-um.
Syracuse (17-3) plays some of its games at 
SU Soccer Stadium — where O’Leary visited when she coached at Yale — but when it ex-pects a bigger crowd, games are moved into the Carrier Dome.
“It’s not a big deal,” midfielder Brittany 
Dashiell said of playing in a dome for the first time. “We’re excited to play in the dome. We’ve never been there. It’ll be a different set-up for us, but we’re excited to take it on.”
Assistant coach Erica LaGrow played in 
the Carrier Dome in 2008 when she was a midfielder at North Carolina. LaGrow said the different environment requires a few ad-justments.
“It’s harder to hear in the dome,” LaGrow 
said. “Obviously, it’s a turf surface. We’ve been playing on natural grass for the last five months. That’ll be an adjustment for our play-ers.”
The UF players will be able to communi-
cate with each other on the field, but LaGrow said the dome’s acoustics make it hard to hear coaches in the flow of the game. To compen-sate for the difficulty in hearing from the side-lines, the Gators have developed a system of non-verbal communication for getting play calls from the coaches to the field. 
LaGrow also said the artificial turf in the 
dome speeds up the pace of the game, but also causes the ball to bounce faster, which could challenge Florida goalkeeper Mikey Meagher.
“You run a little bit faster on turf,” LaGrow 
said. “The ball bounces a little bit differently on turf, so Mikey is going to be seeing some different shots than she would [at Donald R. Dizney Stadium].”
The Gators travel to Syracuse today so they  
can have an extra practice to get acclimated to the dome. LaGrow said the differences in turf, lighting and acoustics shouldn’t be an issue af-ter the practices.
Meagher added that the climate itself might 
be a more comfortable one to play in.
“I don’t think we’re going to let it affect us 
that much,” Meagher said. “We play out in the heat every day, so maybe it will be nice to get out and get underneath the dome.”
O’Leary said the 2012 national semifinal 
loss — in which the Gators let a 12-5 lead slip away — has no bearing on Saturday’s game because the teams have evolved and matured.
There will also be one key difference from 
the teams’ March matchup in Miami. Senior attacker Michelle Tumolo led the Orange with four goals in the loss while none of her team-mates scored more than two. Tumolo suffered an ACL tear in her left knee in Syracuse’s 16-4 win against Cornell on April 16.
At the time of her injury, Tumolo was sec-
ond on the team in scoring with 22 goals and 24 assists. 
Even without Tumolo on the field, Meagher 
still expects to be challenged by the Orange’s attack.
“They were made up of more than just Mi-
chelle Tumolo,” Meagher said. “They have a great firepower of offense out there. We still have to be prepared for everyone who could score a lot of goals and I think we’re ready for that challenge.”
