NEW YORK (AP) — The Black Widow of 
eating contests gobbled up nearly 181 chicken 
wings in 12 minutes, devouring the national championship record in Buffalo on Sunday.
“I’m so happy!” said Sonya Thomas, who 
ate 4.86 pounds of chicken wings to win the contest, besting world eating marvel Joey Chestnut at the ninth annual National Buffalo Wing Festival. Chestnut came in second after eating 169 chicken wings, or 4.55 pounds.
This was the first time Thomas and Chest-nut faced off in a chicken wing eating con-test. Thomas, who’s 5 feet tall and weights 105 pounds, calls herself the Black Widow because she often defeats bigger male com-petitors — Chestnut is 6-foot-2 and weights 230 pounds — in eating contests. She set the previous wings record in 2005, when she ate 174 in 12 minutes.
She also previously set eating records for 
oysters, hard-boiled eggs, cheesecake and ja-lapeno peppers.

Nobody expected the RedHawks 
to keep up with the Gators.
But then again, nobody expected 
a team with 13 yards of total offense 
to go into halftime with a 15-point 
lead like Florida did.
No. 4 UF (1-0) escaped a disas-
trous game, committing three turn-overs and fumbling the ball eight times in its 34-12 victory against Mi-ami (Ohio) (0-1).
“It was not that shocking that 
we didn’t play well, it was shock-
ing that [so many] balls were on the 
ground,” coach Urban Meyer said.
With fumbles in each of their 
first three drives, the Gators allowed the RedHawks to stay in the game early .  
The first was caused by a bad 
snap from Mike Pouncey , who made his first career start at center Satur -
day after playing guard last season. He struggled with numerous off tar -
get snaps, keeping quarterback John Brantley off balance all game. 
“The ball just kept slipping out 
of my hand,” Pouncey said. “I don’t even know how the hell, it just kept slipping out. We’ll have it fixed by next week.”
Pouncey met with Brantley Sun-
day morning before practice to ad-dress the actual snap, his grip on the ball and Brantley’s focus on the snap.
“We watched film and did some 
snapping together,” Brantley said. “It was just us two. We are just try-ing to clean some stuff up and make 
sure that doesn’t happen again.”
Miami took a 
3-0 lead into the second quarter before cornerback 
Janoris Jenkins 
jumped a short route, intercepted a pass and didn’t 
look back until he reached the end zone 67 yards later.
The interception gave the Gators 
a lead they wouldn’t give up, but UF still struggled. 
Fourteen of Brantley’s 17 com-
pleted passes went for 10 yards or less. The Gators ran various ineffec-tive screen plays and short routes, Gators overcome fumbles to win opener

Student volunteers raced across 
campus Sunday afternoon picking up 
trash as part of Alpha Phi Omega’s Campus Cleanup Extravaganza. 
The coed service fraternity spon-
sored the campuswide cleanup in or -
der to get people involved with service 
projects, beautify the campus and get 
the word out about its fall recruitment starting Tuesday, said Lindsay Web-
ber, service vice president. 
 “We are a service fraternity; we do 
service all the time,” Webber said. “We want to share with other people how fun it can be, while reaching out and giving back to our campus.”
A group of about 80 gathered to 
help out, and about 35 of them were members, meaning most of the volun-
teers were from outside the fraternity , Webber said. 
V olunteers could 
form teams before the event or join one once 
they arrived. 
“We invited a lot of 
different organizations from around campus,” Webber said. “We encour -

On a day most students use to sleep in, 
about 20 students were on the Plaza of the 
Americas early Monday morning arranging 
this year’s memorial honoring the vicims of the Sept. 11 attacks.
Members of UF’s chapters of Ameri-
cans for Prosperity, Network of enlight-
ened Women and College Republicans ar -
ranged almost 3,000 flags for the memorial 
in the grass just a few yards north of Union Road. 
Each flag represented a life lost in the at-
tacks.The weeklong display comes in advance 
of a vigil at 7 p.m. Saturday, which will commemorate the nine-year anniversary of the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City.
The flags, which form “9-11” with a frame 
around it, were donations by American Le-gion Auxiliary Unit 155, of Crystal River, American Legion Post 16, of Gainesville, Sept. 11 victims honored

KABUL, Afghanistan — Hundreds of Afghans 
railed against the United States and called for President Barack Obama’s death at a rally in Kabul on Monday to denounce an American 
church’s plans to burn the Islamic holy book 
on Sept. 11.
The crowd in Kabul, numbering as many 
as 500, chanted “Long live Islam” and “Death to America” as they listened to fiery speeches from members of parliament, provincial coun-cil deputies, and Islamic clerics who criticized the U.S. and demanded the withdrawal of foreign troops from the country. Some threw 
rocks when a U.S. military convoy passed, but 
speakers shouted at them to stop and told po-lice to arrest anyone who disobeyed.
The Gainesville-based Dove World Out-
reach Center announced plans to burn cop-ies of the Quran on church grounds to mark the ninth anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, but has been denied a permit to set a bonfire. The church, which made headlines 
last year after distributing T-shirts that said 
“Islam is of the Devil,” has vowed to proceed with the burning.
“We know this is not just the decision of a 
church. It is the decision of the president and the entire United States,” said Abdul Shakoor, an 18-year-old high school student who said he joined the protest after hearing neighbor -
hood gossip about the Quran burning.
The U.S. Embassy in Kabul issued a state-
ment condemning Dove World Outreach Cen-ter’s plans, saying Washington was “deeply concerned about deliberate attempts to offend members of religious or ethnic groups.”
Protesters, who gathered in front of west-
ern Kabul’s Milad ul-Nabi mosque, raised placards and flags emblazoned with slogans calling for Obama’s death, while police looked on. They also burned an effigy of Dove World Outreach Center’s pastor Terry Jones.
Muslims consider the Quran to be the 
word of God and demand that it, along with any printed material containing its verses or the name of Allah or the Prophet Muhammad, be treated with the utmost respect. Any in-tentional damage or show of disrespect to the Quran is considered deeply offensive.
In 2005, 15 people died and scores were 
wounded in riots in Afghanistan sparked by a story in Newsweek magazine alleging that interrogators at the U.S. detention center in 
Guantanamo Bay placed copies of the Quran 
in washrooms and had flushed one down the toilet to get inmates to talk. Newsweek later retracted the story.
Also Monday , NATO said an American 
service member was killed in fighting in the country’s turbulent east on Sunday.
No other details were given in accordance 
with standard procedure. The death was the 
fifth among U.S. troops in Afghanistan in Sep-
tember, following the deaths of more than 220 American troops over the past three months.
This year is already the bloodiest for Amer -
ican forces in Afghanistan since the 2001 inva-sion, with at least 321 killed so far.
Violence is increasing with the infusion of 
30,000 additional U.S. troops that brings the total number of foreign forces in Afghanistan 
to more than 140,000. Stepped-up operations 
ahead of next week’s parliamentary elections and an ongoing campaign to drive the Taliban from its southern strongholds are also boost-ing the numbers of dead and wounded.
Taliban insurgents on Sunday vowed to 
attack polling places during the Sept. 18 vote and warned Afghans not to participate in what it called a sham election. The insurgency 
aims to topple the government in Kabul and 
drive foreign troops from the country.

CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. — 
Police have accused a high school 
teacher of holding teenagers at gunpoint after he found them ghost-hunting in a Tennessee graveyard.
The Hamilton County Sheriff’s 
Office says deputies went to Ship-ley Cemetery, outside of Chatta-nooga, on Saturday night after a complaint of shots fired.
Police say they confiscated 
an assault rifle from 45-year-old Stacey Swal-lows.
S e v e r a l 
teens, ages 16 to 19, told deputies they had gone to the 
cemetery after reading an online ghost story about it. They say as they were leaving, 
Swallows blocked the road with his vehicle, pointed the rifle at them and told them to stay until police arrived.
Swallows teaches diesel me-
chanics at Sequoyah High School in nearby Soddy-Daisy. 
Swallows was being held on 
$180,000 bond Monday, charged with nine counts each of aggra-vated assault and false imprison-ment.
Teacher arrested in cemetary� UF HAS NO OFFICAL POLICY ON CURSING.
By ANDREW PANTAZI
Alligator Writer
Romantic literature tends to deal 
with the seedier things in life, but 
UF freshman Jamie Chute doesn’t see why her English professor needed to drop F-bombs in class.
Chute, who was home-schooled 
and dual-enrolled at Daytona State College for two years before com-ing to UF, said she’s heard profes-sors curse before. Nevertheless, she thinks that there are better ways of expressing the material.
“I don’t want to come off as a 
prude, but it didn’t need to be said 
that way,” she said.
But, under a clause, UF profes-
sors have the right to teach how 
they see fit, and this may include language that some would see as less than conventional.
“It’s my classroom,” said Mer -
edith Cochie, a former UF professor in the College of Journalism and 
Communications, “and that’s how 
it goes for me.”
Cochie, who now teaches at Full 
Sail University, said curse words come naturally to her. The 26-year-old has been in newsrooms since she was 14, and cursing, she said, is part of life in the newsroom.  
“I talk how I usually talk,” she 
said about her teaching style. “And that’s with curse words.” 
Although there are no rules at 
UF specifically dealing with foul language, there is a rule about pro-fessors’ responsibility to respect their roles as teachers, mentors, re-searchers and counselors.
Academic Provost Joe Glover 
doesn’t remember ever hearing someone complain about profan-ity, just bad behavior. He said there are appropriate instances where in-
structors may curse, such as using 
profanity for academic reasons.
“If a student complains, we 
would look at the situation and as-sess it to see if the professor crossed the line,” Glover said. “You could have a professor who crossed the line or a student who is just unrea-sonably sensitive.”
Of the 120 students who filled 
out evaluations of Cochie at the end of the semester, three thought it was unprofessional of her to say words like “shit” in class.
“Nobody’s ever come up to me 
face-to-face or after class and said, ‘I’m uncomfortable with your lan-guage,’” she said. 
UF freshman Helen D’Avanza 
thinks cursing is a method of expression.
“There are lucid, 
intelligent people who just swear, man,” she 
said. “It is what it is, and who cares if an F-bomb is dropped.”
 But D’Avanza, who went to a 
public high school in Tampa, said she doesn’t want her professors to curse all the time. 
“I want more respectful pro-
fessors,” said Kramer Leitman, a freshman who went to a private Christian school in Jacksonville. “I want moral professors because in high school I really looked up to 
some of my teachers.”
Ombudsman Tommie Howard 
agrees. He said that if it were up to 
him, cursing would be banned for professors.
In the end, D’Avanza said it’s 
not a big deal how professors talk.
“I will listen to my professors 
no matter what, even if I am of-
fended.”Opinions vary about 
professors cursing

  Natalie Ford, left, and Jessica Gordon tap ﬂ  ags into the ground Monday morning. The ﬂ  ags are part of a 
9/11 memorial on the Plaza of the Americas. 
and UF’s Pro-Life Alliance.
  Political science graduate stu-
dent Jean Morrow, coordinator 
of the project and member of the 
local American Legion Post, said she was happy to see people vol-unteer their time during the holi-
day.
  “I am impressed because it 
was Labor Day,” she said.
  She has put in four years of 
work to put the memorial to-gether. 
When she learned of a similar 
memorial at the College of Cen-
tral Florida, in Ocala, she was 
compelled to bring the memorial 
to Gainesville.
  “It was something that I need-
ed to do,” she said. “It’s like a calling.”
  Linda Spears, a UF parent vis-iting Gainesville for the week-end, said she felt the memorial 
was an appropriate reminder of 
the attacks for students and local residents.
  “We tend to forget too easily, 
too quickly,” she said.
  Morrow said the memorial is 
placed on the plaza so that stu-dents and community members alike can see it, whether they are 
walking or driving.
  She added that the display is 
not meant to be seen as political.
  “This project is all about get-
ting people to remember the vic-
tims,” she said.
The solemn memorial is a con-
trast to another planned event in on Sept. 11.

Team that collected the most trash won medals, Starbucks gift cards
with other people.”
  After the cleanup, everyone met at Flavet 
Field for a celebration of free food, drinks and 
prizes.   The grand prize, Olympic-style medals and gift cards to Starbucks, was for the team 
that picked up the most trash. Other prizes were for the most spirited, best dressed and 
the team that found the strangest object.
This year’s strangest was an old, rusted 
road sign.
  Two fraternity brothers, David Wolfe and 
Alvaro Salkeld, took the idea of best dressed 
very literally and went home with the prize. 
  “Last time, lots of people came in costumes and had team chants,” Salkeld said. “When 
we heard there was a prize for best dressed, 
we instantly thought of suits be-
cause this way we count as spir-
ited and also ﬁ  nely dressed.”
  The two Tuxedo Trashmen 
brought extra suits from Goodwill in order to recruit other team members.  By the end of the day , the teams picked up 
more than 20 bags of trash and about 10 bags of recycling. 
   “It was a very huge success,” Webber said. 
“We’re planning on doing it again at the be-ginning of next semester, and hopefully we’ll 
get an even bigger turnout since it won’t be 
football season.” CLEAN , from page 1

As if Gainesville didn’t 
have enough news to write about with its 
international coverage of the  gem of Christianity’s planned 
burning of the Muslim holy 
book, our football team pops out to play.
And, no, we’re not talking 
about the ugly win Saturday . We’re talking about, um, big-ger things. 
Brandon Spikes, former 
defensive star for the Gators 
and current New England 
Patriots rookie, found himself in a sticky situation last week when an 11-minute, better-than-Paris-but-worse-than-Colin-Farrell-quality Chatrou-lette sex tape surfaced. 
No stranger to contro-
versy , the alleged (but not 
really) Spikes shows us his 
multifaceted talents in being tight end, wide receiver — we could go on for days — as his Kardashian look-alike partner commits her own personal fouls as she  roughs the passer — seriously , days. 
Jokes aside, this spread 
formation — OK, last one — could prove a little less jolly than one imagined from sim-ply getting his jollies off.
Reebok has reportedly 
chosen to not finalize Spike’s $60,000 endorsement deal fol-lowing the viral rounds of the video where more is being blown than Spikes’ cash. 
Following Pittsburgh 
Steeler’s Ben Roethlisberger’s acquittal of sexual assault and subsequent suspension of four 
games, we can only imagine 
what kind of booty Spikes will be missing out on from a lack of playing time after his naughty boy punishment.
But above everything, 
we’re just surprised Spikes’ generally agreed upon great-est weakness is his slow-poke 
pace despite the fact he has 
three legs. Keep the crazy coming, Gators.

Dems in trouble come 
November 
We wouldn’t call it a forfeit, but it’s the first word that 
comes to mind.  
After realizing a generous portion of Americans 
are a bit peeved with the bigwigs they sent to Washington to sort through the Bush-era wreckage, Democratic officials are re-
organizing and reloading their troops for November’s red-and-
blue bloodbath that’s expected to send more asses to the cleaners than elephants.  Telling media they plan to redirect resources to candidates running in solidly blue districts, Democratic officials are quickly letting Americans in on their dirty little not-so-secret secret: We’re in trouble.  
What happened to that whole “Yes, we can!” rah-rah crap? 
Was that just a big tease, Dems? We realize you’re tired from, you know, ending the war in Iraq, enacting historic social wel-
fare legislation providing health care to millions of poor Ameri-
cans and some other unimportant things, but you’re going to need to pull your asses together if you’re at all hopeful.  
Only needing 39 seats to gain control of the House, Repub-
licans are stepping up their A-game as they sit high atop their tuffets savoring their curds and whey and bask in the biggest Tea Party the nation has ever seen. 
And a ballot without a chance of electing the nation’s first 
black president with a smile that never quits spells sour for 
Democrats who fear even their own want a sip of the tea.  
But the truth is our nation is different now than it was two 
years ago. It’s the American way. Midterm elections are no 
stranger to incumbent-party slaughter, and this November should be no surprise when we see those fancy interactive elec-tion maps turn redder than an Arkansas native’s neck.  
At a time when the D.C. has become so politically segregated 
into blue guys in the front of the bus and red guys at the back, perhaps a change can help mend some of these differences.
Don’t be duped by Dove World dimwits
At first glance, the plan by Dove World Outreach 
Center to burn copies of the Quran on Sept. 11 seems like an easy target. 
 Chalk it up to the all-too-familiar notions of bigotry and accessible blasphemy, dressed up with a local flair by a bunch of apple-cheeked simpletons eager to 
flaunt their newfound infamy.
Dig a little deeper, though, and you find yourself 
scratching the surface of a global furniture trafficking ring cloaked in quasi-religious secrecy and abetted by a 
misplaced tax status and a small cadre of mouth-breath-
ing white slaves.
Islam isn’t the real target of the Dove center’s mis-
placed hate. 
The real enemy of our disgraceful Gainesville breth-
ren is low-priced furniture manufactured in Asia and sold across this great land.
If they stayed true to their ideological roots, Dove 
World members would don T-shirts bearing the slogan, 
“Particle board is of the devil.”
“Pastor” Terry Jones and his wife Sylvia aren’t too 
keen on letting this little secret out of the bag, but their 
entire spread is completely financed by selling vintage furniture — the good stuff, mid-century pieces bought 
in Europe and shipped over here where it can be sold 
for a princely sum.
On eBay.com, Craigslist.com and other web out-
lets under the business name “TS & Company,” Dove 
World’s outreach pretty much consists of securing a 
good price for its used furniture and shipping it across the country using the free labor provided by its pitiful army of duped dopes. 
Dove World disciples, for their undying and un-paid devotion to a cause as noble 
as freight shipping, get to live 
rent-free in the Jones’ crumbling duplexes in the Phoenix and Pine Ridge subdivisions and eat what-ever scraps of food Terry Jones and 
his wife drop off on their dinner 
table.
That the Internet can both sup-
port a clandestine furniture business cloaked in de-
pressingly popular hate mongering, and also expose its 
inner workings, is a testament to, and indictment of, our information superhighway.
Sept. 11 will never be a day that any American can 
ever consider “normal,” and each of us will remember 
the day in a way that brings us a small amount of per -
sonal tranquility birthed from the dust of a cowardly act 
of terrorism.
Instead of wrapping yourself up in the fanaticism 
and discrimination of the Dove World dimwits, perhaps a quiet day spent shopping for furniture at one of our many reputable and honest furniture stores would be time better spent. 
I’m sure the hardworking salespeople could use the 
extra commissions.
Far be it from me to impugn the purity of an act as 
brave as book burning, but it seems the controversy sur -
rounding the actions of Dove World Outreach Center 
is little more than a sophisticated viral marketing cam-
paign spearheaded by a used furniture salesman with a flair for prejudice.

Secular government better for America
I have come to expect ignorant claims 
that  America is a Christian nation from 
the uneducated fundamentalist, but I was 
very surprised to read it in Thursday’s Al-ligator from a UF law student. Although after reading further I realized Bryan Grif-
fin knows his belief has no evidence to sup-
port it, and a belief no matter how sincere and strong is not necessarily true without evidence to support it. Some readers may have noticed that when speaking of the 
Declaration of Independence, Griffin uses 
no quotations. That’s because he makes a claim that does not actually appear in the 
Declaration of Independence. The true 
wording of the document is, “We hold 
these truths to be self-evident, that all men 
are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable 
Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty 
and the pursuit of Happiness.” 
Anyone who has even the most el-
ementary education of our Founding Fa-
thers knows by “Creator” they meant a 
deistic naturalist god, and not the God of 
the Bible. This misrepresentation is noth-ing less than dishonesty and a complete 
lack of intellectual integrity. 
However, if Griffin wishes to discuss 
some of our early documents, allow me to 
quote the Treaty of Tripoli, drafted under George Washington and signed by John Adams.
The treaty states in Article 11, “As the 
Government of the United States of Amer -
ica is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion.” How could our found-ers be any clearer than this? 
However, neither of these documents 
is our governing document, which, of course, is provided by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Anyone who has read the Constitution should know any references to religion are purely exclu-
sionary. Any person with even the small-
est amount of knowledge and integrity would realize America and the Consti-
tution were not shaped by Christianity 
or any other religious philosophy. In his 
column, Griffin makes a brief mention of 
the movement that shaped America but does not elaborate on the Enlightenment 
because it was a movement not based on 
Christian philosophy, but rather on rea-son and secularism, which are the very 
ideas he is attempting to discredit! 
The fact is, no matter if you’re a reli-
gious person or not, everyone should be 
proud of and support the secular govern-ment set up by our founders, because a 
government that remains neutral on mat-
ters of religion is good for the theist and 
atheist alike.

8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 7, 2010
� FLORIDA’S SENATE RACE 
IS UNPREDICTABLE.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
WILMINGTON, Del. — In the 
turbulent year of the tea party, Re-
publican Rep. Mike Castle of Dela-ware set out to jangle no nerves as he ran for a Senate seat long held 
by Vice President Joseph Biden. 
It’s the way Republican strategists originally envisioned 2010, a roster of seasoned politicians pointing the party toward significant gains in the Senate.
“He brings our style of civility 
and independence to Washington and works to develop solutions,” is 
the soothing, even quaint message 
on the 71-year-old lawmaker’s cam-paign website, which shows him in a suit and tie, working alone at his desk. Experience “is hugely impor -
tant,” he said in an interview.
After two terms as governor and 
nine as the state’s lone congressman, Castle appears better positioned 
than other veterans who faced a tea 
party-backed challenge this year. If he prevails over Christine O’Donnell on Sept. 14 — he and GOP officials have launched a fierce counterattack — he would join more than a half-dozen other veteran Republican of-ficeholders on the ballot in Senate 
races.
In matters of style as well as pol-
icy and political experience, they are 
the polar opposite of Rand Paul of Kentucky, Sharron Angle of Nevada and Ken Buck in Colorado, all of whom tapped into an anti-govern-ment sentiment, espouse politically risky positions, won primaries over 
establishment candidates, and now 
face particularly difficult races in the fall.
No matter the blend of can-
didates that Republicans end up with, a persistently weak economy and voter anger add up to enough competitive races to give them at least an outside chance of winning 
Senate control. Already, a constella-
tion of outside groups is spending heavily on television in Senate races, including more than $5 million this summer for two groups backed by former George W. Bush political ad-viser Karl Rove.Republicans need to capture 10 
seats to win a majority , and as many as a dozen held by Democrats ap-pear competitive, as well as at least five currently in the hands of the GOP .
Ironically, as the primary sea-
son draws to a close and the fall campaign dawns, both parties try to straddle politically inconve-nient facts that underscore broader trends.
Democrats are loathe to concede 
their majority is at risk. “I don’t think there are” enough competitive races 
for that to happen, said Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey , head of the 
party’s Senate campaign commit-tee. Yet the party’s strategists issue a stream of statements saying that many tea party-backed challengers in tight contests are “too extreme” 
and will cost the GOP its chance of 
gaining control. And the DSCC is making a quick check to see wheth-er it has a late, low-budget opportu-nity in strongly Republican Alaska, where tea party-backed challenger Joe Miller defeated GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski in a recent primary.
Senate Republican leader Mitch 
McConnell and others in his party 
tried repeatedly to defeat tea party-
supported challengers in Kentucky , Colorado, Florida, Nevada and else-where in recent months, privately expressing fears they would prove unelectable.
Now, after compiling a mixed 
record in the primaries, the cam-paign chairman, Sen. John Cornyn 
of Texas, says the fall is “an opportu-
nity for Republicans, independents libertarians and disgruntled Demo-crats to come together around a fis-cal responsibility message and one that says the government can’t grow itself out of this problem.”
Other veteran Republicans on 
Senate ballots this fall include GOP 
Rep. John Boozman of Arkansas, 
whom party officials say needed some coaxing to run. Now he leads Democratic Sen. Blanche Lincoln by significant margins in public and private polls.
Already , Democrats have tacitly 
written off a seat in North Dakota, where former GOP Gov. John Ho-
even, initially a reluctant candidate, is favored to succeed retiring Sen. 
Byron Dorgan.
Former Sen. Dan Coats is ahead 
in the polls as he tries to win back an Indiana seat he voluntarily gave up a dozen years ago.
Next door in Illinois, Republican 
Rep. Mark Kirk is in a tougher race with Alexi Giannoulias for the seat President Barack Obama once held. He, too, was courted heavily by Cornyn and others.
Republican veterans also are on 
the ballot in key Midwestern races where GOP senators are retiring. 
In Ohio, former Rep. Rob Portman, 
who served in two Cabinet-level po-sitions in the Bush administration, polls ahead of Democratic Lt. Gov . Lee Fisher and had a multimillion-dollar cash-on-hand advantage in the most recent fundraising report.
In Florida, former House Speaker 
Marco Rubio is a rarity , a tea party 
favorite who is also an accomplished 
politician. The three-way race with Democratic Rep. Kendrick Meek and Gov . Charlie Crist, a former Republican running as an indepen-dent, is one of the most unpredict-able in the country.
Tea party or establishment, GOP looks to gain seats

yards, 1 TD  
Everybody had high expectation for Jenkins coming into the season and he didn’t disappoint Saturday. With the Gators facing a 3-0 deficit, he jumped in front of a short route, intercepted a pass and returned it 
67 yards for a touchdown to give his team a lead it wouldn’t give up. His 
interception would be the first of four for the UF defense. Jenkins was all over the field with five solo tackles and even stopped Miami (Ohio) running back Thomas Merriweather for a four-yard loss in the first half.
12 tackles, 1.5 tackles for loss, 1 int., 40 int. return yds.Since the departure of Brandon Spikes, the Gators have looked to 
Black as the defense’s leader. He said he approached Saturday’s game 
different than he had any other at Florida, keeping the defense focused as the offense struggled. And, statistically, Black’s on-field performance was perhaps the best in his college career. He led the defense with a career-high 12 tackles, and his second-quarter interception led to Florida’s third touchdown. SWAMP STUDS

Howard recorded both of the Gators’ sacks Saturday and was named the SEC Defensive Line Player of the Week. The team entered this season with unanswered questions about its pass rush after losing 39 combined career sacks with the departures of Carlos Dunlap and Jermaine 
Cunningham. But Howard’s play showed he is ready to contribute on a 
rebuilt unit after recording three total sacks in his two previous seasons. 
The front four also helped the defense hold Miami (Ohio) to just four rushing yards. The Gators’ offense had already committed three turnovers 
and Miami (Ohio) had a 3-0 lead. But in the second quarter, cornerback Janoris Jenkins intercepted a pass in stride and returned it 67 yards for a touchdown. The interception gave UF a 7-3 lead and momentum as it scored two more touchdowns before halftime.TURNING POINT

� THE GATORS WON ALL THREE OF 
THEIR MATCHES THIS PAST WEEKEND.
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Writer
gluca@alligator.org
 
The Gators football team wasn’t the only 
orange and blue squad winning ugly Satur -
day. 
Despite hitting a season-low .179, No. 
4 Florida (5-0) was able to claw its way to a 
3-1 (25-22, 25-19, 25-27, 25-21) win over Colo-
rado State (5-1) to complete its sweep of the 
Campus USA Credit Union Invitational after straight-set victories over Albany and Bowl-ing Green on Friday.
Although they committed a 2010-worst 25 
attack errors, the Gators pulled out a victory behind aggressive serving and full-throttle ef-fort. 
“We need to clean it up a little bit more, 
but volleyball is a grind-it-out type of sport,” senior Lauren Bledsoe said. 
“Not everything is always going to be pret-
ty, but I think that shows just how hard each team is working.”
Both teams were able to keep the other out 
of an offensive rhythm by utilizing aggressive serving, highlighted by senior Erin Fleming’s four aces to just one service error. 
Florida’s powerful serves made life difficult 
for the Rams’ attackers, as they were guilty of numerous overpasses and were forced to take a number of attacks from the back row. 
This, combined with another strong block-
ing performance from UF, led to CSU hitting just .151.
“When Colorado State is in system they’re 
a very good team,” junior Kelly Murphy said. 
“So we knew that serving would be a big part 
of our game and we just tried to go back there and get a good serve in.”
CSU came into the match with a similar 
plan. Despite committing 13 service errors and 
just three aces the tactic was successful. 
The Gators were forced to play a multitude 
of attacks from behind the attack line.
Colorado State’s strong serves forced 
Florida into a bevy of offensive scrambles, highlighted by a point in which Fleming and 
Kristy Jaeckel made diving plays to keep the 
ball alive before Murphy was able to play it across with an over-the-shoulder bump from 15 feet behind the baseline. 
“As the match wore on, we knew we had to 
win those effort points because those are a big part of momentum,” Murphy said. 
When the Gators actually did manage to 
get in rhythm they found themselves having 
to generate opportunities for players other 
than their outside hitters, who hit a combined .000 on the day. 
Stepping up to fill the void were right-side 
hitters Murphy and Tangerine Wiggs, who provided 13 and six kills, respectively. 
Also giving the Gators an offensive lift 
were the middle blockers, as Cassandra Anderson chipped 
in eight kills and Bledsoe add-
ed 10 of her own.
“The good news is on a 
night where our pin hitters 
were having a tough time 
getting kills we were still able to win,” coach 
Mary Wise said. “So often it’s all about how good are your left sides, and our left sides did so many other things for us, they just had a 
harder time killing the ball. But we won that 
match because of all the other things they do for our team.” 
Chief among those things were digs, as 
Jaeckel logged a team high 14 with Callie Riv-ers checking in just behind her at 13. 
UF swept Albany and Bowling Green on 
Friday. Jaeckel racked up a combined 17 kills in the two matches and the Gators finished 
with a nine-block advantage over the Fal-
cons. UF sweeps through tourney
On a cool Tuesday night in November, the most memo-
rable speech this side of “The Promise” was issued in 
The Swamp. 
UF offensive coordinator Steve Addazio talked reporters — 
and by proxy , fans — off the proverbial ledge after Florida’s offense sputtered to a 27-point output against Vanderbilt in the 
ninth game of the season. 
Plenty of Gators fans are again finding themselves danger -
ously close to jumping after watching John Brantley take infield practice from center Mike Pouncey in UF’s 34-12 win against Miami (Ohio) on Saturday.
Despite Florida’s offense only mustering 212 yards — 25 
heading into the fourth quarter — I’m going to try to talk fans down from that ledge, with a little help from the master. 
“I know where the warts are, and like every year, you’re trying to fix warts, right?” 
Right, Steve. No wart was as offen-
sively ugly as Pouncey’s 13 mishandled or bad snaps, and the coaches know that. Urban Meyer couldn’t keep the 
team from looking like the “Bad News 
Bears” out there, despite his best efforts, because Pouncey failed to keep a stiff 
wrist or keep a good grip on the ball, and 
Brantley took his focus off the snap, ac-cording to Meyer. Pouncey and Brantley 
met at the football facilities Sunday morning to work on the problem, and it would be shocking to see something like that happen again. 
“If you try to be something you’re not, sometimes that fails.”Besides being great life advice, that statement speaks to how 
the coaching staff is trying to distribute the touches. There was 
a lot of talk about how Brantley was a good runner and there 
would still be plenty of opportunities for him to move like Tebow in 2010, but we saw none of that against the RedHawks. 
And that’s a good thing because Brantley is not Tebow. Could 
there have been more down-field throws? Absolutely. But the receiving corps is inexperienced and, at times, unreliable (see: 
Thompson, Deonte), so the best game plan is to get the ball to 
the stable of running backs. That didn’t go well because the of-fensive line was shuffled like a deck of cards due to injuries to 
Matt Patchan and Xavier Nixon. Both are expected to be back 
for USF, meaning the linemen don’t have to try to be some-thing they’re not for a second straight week. Ten months later, Addazio’s wisdom still holds true for struggling offenseVolleyball

UF SOCCER
By JAIME MANHEIMER
Alligator Writer
 
UF alumni returned for a record-
setting night Friday, as sophomore 
McKenzie Barney now sits tied for the school record after scoring a goal in her seventh-consecutive 
home game.
Barney scored her record-
setting goal five minutes into the 
second half off of a well-timed cross by outside defender Jazmyne Avant, which left Barney with an easy one-on-one situation, and she finished a well-placed shot to the far-right post.Barney was one of six Gators 
with a goal as No. 7 UF (5-0) beat Jacksonville 6-0.
“Anything tied with (current 
record holder) Abby Wambach means a whole lot to me,” Barney said. “She’s a soccer god, and to be tied with her is an amazing accom-plishment.”
Barney struggled in the first 
half, but the Gators still led 3-0 at the intermission. 
“In the big picture of the season 
the solid bench play is very impor -
tant,” coach Becky Burleigh said. “For them to get this experience is good as we move down the road.”Junior Lindsay Thompson put 
in the first goal of the game off a through ball from Erika Tymrak. 
“It felt good scoring,” Thomp-
son said. “It seems like after 
that everything fell into place and I was glad I could do that for 
us.”
For the first 
20 minutes, the 
Gators used 
their outside defenders, Avant and Nicky Kit, to advance the ball and draw defenders away from the playmakers up top.
The strategy caused Jackson-
ville (2-3) to focus on stopping the defenders, which opened the mid-dle and allowed UF to overwhelm the center of the field with some quick give-and-go plays. The crisp passing allowed freshman Maggie Rodgers to score her first career goal in the closing seconds of the 
first half.
“My mom told me she had a feel-
ing I would put one away tonight,” 
Rodgers said. “It was an amazing feeling. I was ready for another kick off and everybody else started to run inside. I didn’t even hear the clock counting down.”
UF now starts a tough five-game 
road trip, as it travels to in-state ri-val No. 5 FSU and No. 1 North Car -
olina. The Gators are 4-0 against in-state opponents heading into their matchup with the Seminoles.
“We just want to be progress-
ing as a team,” Burleigh said. “Last week we didn’t really feel like we 
were progressing. I’m really happy 
with the shut out, I think it says a lot about our teams defense, and I’m really happy with the way we finished. This game really helps us and shows that it’s a step in the right direction.”
Barney ties record in Gators’ win against Jacksonville
Burleigh
“We didn’t just fall off the pickle boat and all 
of a sudden we showed up 9-0.”
Not sure exactly what this means. And 
this time around, we’re only one game into 
the season, not nine. But one can assume 
Addazio was saying the Gators had the record they did because they were doing 
something right. And though there were 
plenty of new faces starting on offense Satur -
day, they’re on that field for a reason. By gar -
nering significant playing time at, perhaps, 
the nation’s top football school, it’s safe to 
assume those guys are pretty darn talented. 
Brantley hadn’t started a game before this 
weekend, Chris Rainey had never played 
wide receiver, Omarius Hines had never 
played tight end and Maurice Hurt had nev-er played tackle. But give this group a little 
time to play together as a unit. They can only 
go up from here. Some of them may not have shown it against Miami, but most of those 
guys were big-time recruits for a reason. 
“At the end of the day, you’re fighting to make 
sure you have the best play that you can have within your structure. But at the end of the day, 
what do you want to do? Win. Win. You want to win, and that’s the goal.”
It’s unclear as to exactly which thing is 
more important once the clock strikes 12:01 
a.m., but once again let’s take a leap of faith. 
Vince Lombardi, a far less talented orator 
than Steve Addazio, once said (or didn’t say, 
depending on who you believe), “Winning 
isn’t everything, it’s the only thing.” As poor 
as UF’s offense played against Miami, the 
team still came away with a victory . There 
is no doubt that if the Gators have a similar 
showing against a more formidable foe, they 
should expect to lose. But for now, cheer up, 
Gators fans. At least your team (Ole Miss) 
didn’t give up 49 points to Jacksonville State or score three points (Kansas) against North 
Dakota State. 
As Addazio succinctly said with South 
Carolina looming, “I’m just saying, so let’s 
– we gotta go, man, we gotta have a great week this week.” The same is true for the impending matchup with the Bulls. If the 
offense sputters again, I don’t have enough 
hands to catch all the fans who will be ready to jump.KYLE , from page 15M. Jenkins to miss six weeks
and the RedHawks drew within nine 
points early in the fourth quarter.
The receivers didn’t help Brantley. 
Deonte Thompson dropped a per -
fectly thrown ball in the end zone, and 
Carl Moore did not record a catch. Tight end Omarius Hines and wide receiver 
Chris Rainey both caught touchdowns, 
though. 
UF failed to make use of its depth at 
the position – something Meyer noticed after the game.
“I didn’t realize at the time, but De-
onte Thompson and Carl Moore played every snap, and that’s the first time that 
has ever happened here at Florida,” 
Meyer said Monday. “You have to get a rotation in there.”
However, the offensive strategy 
seemed to shift in the final frame, when Brantley completed his only three passes beyond 10 yards and UF gained 187 of its 212 yards.
“I’m glad it happened in this kind of game, a game that we could have just went out there and won,” Pouncey said. 
“But if we do it next week (against South 
Florida), we won’t win the game.”
Gators reloading for USF: Despite 
Saturday’s sub-par performance against 
the RedHawks, Meyer delivered some 
good news in Monday’s press confer -
ence.
Safety Will Hill and offensive line-
man Carl Johnson are ex-
pected to play against the 
Bulls this Saturday. Both players were held out against Miami because 
they “weren’t ready to 
play.”
Wide receiver Frankie Hammond, Jr., 
who was also suspended last week, will 
see action Saturday, Meyer said.
Also, Meyer is hopeful left tackle 
Xavier Nixon (knee) and tight end Jordan Reed (knee) will suit up against USF. 
However, cornerback Moses Jenkins 
will miss six weeks with a hyperextend-ed elbow.FOOTBALL , from page 1
