JACKSONVILLE — The Gators faced a daunting task.
Unranked Florida traveled to EverBank Field for its an-
nual matchup with Georgia, the No. 11 team in the ﬁ  rst edi-
tion of the College Football Playoff rankings.It’s a series Florida coach Will Muschamp never won in 
seven tries — losing four times as a safety for UGA and 
thrice more as UF’s head man.
But with the odds against them and their backs against 
the wall, the Gators pulled off the unthinkable by coming away with a 38-20 win against the Bulldogs on Saturday in front of an announced crowd of 83,004.
“For the guys to pull together against a good football 
team, … to come together and understand what’s at stake as far as our season’s concerned, as far as three-in-a-row, as far as sending our seniors out the right way, all of the 
things that are really critical and really important about 
this rivalry and our guys understood it,” Muschamp said. “We were able to make the plays when we needed to in the game.”

This was a big win for Florida (4-3, 3-3 Southeastern 
Conference).
It was UF’s ﬁ  rst win against UGA (6-2, 4-2 SEC) since 2010 
and its ﬁ  rst victory against a ranked opponent since beating No. 10 FSU on Nov. 24, 2012 — a span of 19 games.
But for Florida’s seniors and redshirt seniors who hail 
from the Peach State, the victory may have meant a little bit more.
“It was great to get a victory,” said starting linebacker 
and Atlanta native Mike Taylor. “Finishing 1-3 is a lot bet-ter than 0-4.”
Outside of redshirt senior Neiron Ball — who played 
on special teams in UF’s 34-31 overtime win against UGA on Oct. 30, 2010 — none of the seniors had taken the ﬁ  eld 
against the Bulldogs and came out victorious.
That changed Saturday.
“This (was) my last chance at them,” said center Max 
Garcia, who spent his childhood in Norcross, Georgia, 
watching the annual game between the Gators and the 
Bulldogs. “I wanted to leave my mark on this game, and I wanted to do whatever I could to come out as a winner. So yeah, just looking up at that scoreboard at the end of the game I had tears in my eyes just because we were able to 
do it.”

A man from High Springs tried to drown 
himself in a jail cell toilet after he was arrested 
Saturday night for ﬁ  ghting at The Fest 13, ac-cording to police.
Jeffrey Scott Hubler, 47, was intoxicated 
on Bo Diddley Community Plaza at about 8:30 p.m., and Gainesville Police spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias wrote in an email that he fought with security staff and bit one of them on the shin.
While waiting to be booked, Tobias said Ja-
cobs put his face in his jail cell toilet and tried 
to drown himself. His bond is set at $5,000.

A man from Chieﬂ  and was arrested Thurs-
day evening after police said they found mate-
rials used to make crystal methamphetamine inside his car.
Police received a tip regarding a black Nis-
san Titan with materials used to make crystal meth, according to a report. At Paradise Trail-er Park shortly after 5 p.m., ofﬁ  cers spotted the truck with Shawn Thorp, 37, and Jennifer Thorp sitting inside. At one point, the woman 
was seen moving a car door back and forth as 
if she were trying to air the vehicle out. 
About an hour-and-a-half later, ofﬁ  cers ap-
proached the car, at which point the man told police he had the end of a marijuana joint in-side his truck. The two were then handcuffed.
When ofﬁ  cers opened the truck, they saw a 
small Butane gas tank on the ﬂ  oor and called the Alachua County Drug Task Force. The task force found about 5 grams of a brown, grainy substance, which tested positive for metham-phetamine. He was also found with a knife.
The woman told police she knew the meth 
was being cooked but said she did not use it.
Shawn Thorpe was arrested on charges of 
possession of methamphetamine, possession of drug paraphernalia, keeping and main-taining a public nuisance and possession of a weapon by a convicted felon. His bond is set at 
Police roundup: attempted suicide; meth; grand theft; break-in

“When I say ‘Hula,’ you say 
‘Ween,’” sang the man in a rain-
bow unicorn outfit.
“Hula,” he said.“Ween,” roared the crowd.
The Suwannee Hulaween 2014 
music festival, held at The Spirit 
of the Suwannee Music Park in Live Oak from Oct. 31 to Nov. 2, attracted about 15 percent more people than it did the first year in 2013, according to marketing di-rector Teena Peavey.
The event featured more than 
50 musical performers, as well as yoga and hoop dance workshops, visual artists, food vendors, a disc golf tournament and a Ferris wheel.
“People are here from all over 
the country,” she said. “Over the weekend, we’ve had an average of 25,000 people at the park, all 
who come in search of different 
things.”
To Jenni Thompson, a 23-year-
old live painter from St. Peters-burg, Suwannee Hulaween is simply “home.”
“There’s a power in the ground 
here,” she said as she added paint to her brightly colored abstract painting. “It just draws you — makes you keep coming back.”
Quinten Finnell, who assisted Thompson with the painting, said he agreed.
“I just love Suwannee and the 
familiar feelings it gives me,” the 26-year-old from Tampa said. “This was my first Hulaween, but I’ve been to Suwannee four times so far just in this past year.”Peavey said although there is 
a large part of the crowd from 
Florida and its surrounding cities, 
many of the attendees are from other states.
Gabe Morgan said he didn’t 
think twice about driving from Il-linois to satisfy his hunger for the lights and acoustics of The String Cheese Incident.
“I couldn’t miss String Cheese. 
They’re amazing. Everything about this place is amazing,” Morgan said. “The sound system, the people — It’s all f*****g amaz-ing.”
Olivia Rayner, a stilt walker 
with the Amazing Giants from Columbus, Ohio, said she would 
describe her first Hulaween expe-
rience as “beautiful,” saying the festival has one of the best crowds she has seen.
“We had never been to the mu-
sic park before, but we had heard great things,” she said. “Now we’re here and have seen first-hand. The energy is just so high.”
Peavey said that the energy 
and excitement for Halloween celebration is really what makes Hulaween stand out from other music festivals.
Kirsten Bonnin, a 30-year-old 
mother from Pensacola, said she thinks the weekend is a great place to celebrate Halloween right.
“It’s a place where everyone 
is dressing up and celebrating and enjoying,” Bonnin said as her 5-year-old daughter Gretchen, who brought eight costumes for the weekend, danced to the music around a lit hula hoop. “The way I think about it is that at home, Halloween is just an hour and a 
half of trick-or-treating, but here 
you get to really go and experi-ence it.” Suwannee Hulaween attracts more people than last year

UF’s College of Education 
has received a $1 million grant.
The Jim Moran Foundation, 
a philanthropic organization 
named after an automobile in-
dustry billionaire, provided the 
grant, which supports the de-velopment of the latest teaching tools for Florida’s 55,000 early learning educators.
The grant is expected to 
boost UF’s Early Learning Flor-ida program, a unique online professional development sys-
tem, said Donald Pemberton, 
the director of the Lastinger Center for Learning, which is in the College of Education.
“This grant and the profes-
sional learning system that it will develop further cements UF’s reputation as the preemi-nent leader of online learning,” he said.
Pemberton said UF also re-
ceived funding from three oth-
er foundations, the Stranahan 
Foundation, the Lastinger Fam-ily Foundation and the Helios Education Foundation.
UF early childhood educa-
tion freshman Kelly Martin, 19, said she is excited to see fund-ing put to good use.
“This is a great benefit to the 
college of education,” Martin said. “I’m glad that my college is receiving the funding they deserve, and hopefully the students will be rewarded as well.”
The grant will be paid over 
three years, Pemberton said.
“It has provided the nec-
essary financial resources to complete the design and build of the professional learning sys-tem for Florida’s early learning educators,” Pemberton said.4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 2014

When Beth Thompson walked through the 
Plaza of the Americas, she attracted stares.
Among the masses of students walking to 
and from class, Thompson was easy to spot in 
her homemade plastic breast costume.
Thompson, a 21-year-old UF economics se-
nior, decided the best way to catch attention and raise money for breast cancer research was to walk through campus wearing a plas-tic breast.
“When people come up to me or giggle at 
me because, obviously, I have this huge boob costume,” she said, “I want to let them know what it is about and what they can do to help. I really wanted to raise money because that’s the biggest way we can help.”
Thompson has a long history of cancer in 
her family.
“The big thing about breast cancer, and can-
cer in general, is that people buy pink things and try to celebrate it,” she said. “I think it’s really important that people know what breast cancer awareness really means. It’s that you actually take action.”
Thompson, who is the event chair for the 
2015 UF Relay For Life, has been taking action since she was in the seventh grade when she 
first became involved with Relay For Life.
Her family’s history of cancer propelled 
her to wear the costume for breast cancer at 
UF. She raised $500 in three days from wear-ing it around campus.
“The deal was I wasn’t allowed to take it off until I raised $500,” she said. “I would get donations online from people I didn’t know. When someone says every dollar counts, it re-ally does count.”
Curious students approached Thompson 
to ask her about her costume, she said. Once Thompson shared her mission, students would donate to her cause. She also asked family members to contribute.
Steven Rose, the community representative 
for the American Cancer Society at UF, said he 
is always excited to see a volunteer show ini-tiative to raise money.
“It’s definitely a very unique way of fund-
raising,” he said. “It’s also one that works for 
our campus Relay For Life.”
In April, the American Cancer Society 
raised $400 million nationwide and $150,000 on campus, Rose said.
About 61 teams for the UF organization 
have raised about $10,000 for the 2015 Relay For Life.
Thompson plans on moving to Chicago 
in May to begin working at Macy’s Executive Development Program for store management. 
She said she is determined to continue her in-
volvement with the organization.
“I think I am so incredibly lucky that I am 
a part of something that makes me feel so good,” she said. “It makes me feel like I am re-ally making a difference.” Student wears breast costume on campus to get donations

A nonprofit gym that offers gymnastics 
and sports classes for children with disabilities 
is back in action after closing for renovations.
Balance 180, located at 6527 NW 18th Drive, 
underwent renovations in early June after the 
cheerleading company that originally occu-
pied the building moved out.The organization’s co-founder and director 
Krista Vandenborne said about 70 volunteers helped with the renovations. They cleaned and painted and added a reception desk, col-orful cubbies and updated equipment.
The renovations cost $3,500, which was 
funded through donations.
“I think what I’m most excited about is not 
anything specific but the fact that we had the community come together and do something so generous for all the kids,” said Vandenborne.
The gym offers eight 
classes to children of all abil-ities and backgrounds. One class for those with physical and mental disabilities pre-
pares participants for the Special Olympics. It focuses 
on kicking, rolling, jumping 
and throwing.
Balance 180’s co-founder and current presi-
dent, Carsten Schmalfuss, said the goal is to 
teach kids to balance sports with life.  “I thought that this was a great cause that 
needed support, so here I am and here we are, all of us,” Schmalfuss said.
Schmalfuss said there are more than 100 
volunteers who work at the gym, and many of them are students.
Julie Walter, a 16-year-old Buchholz High 
School junior and Vandenborne’s daughter, volunteers with Balance 180. Walter said the 
organization stands out because it’s different 
than the competitive gymnastics gyms she grew up in.  
“It’s just really homey,” she said. “There’s a 
family vibe, and everyone is really happy.”Nonprofit Balance 180 reopens after summer renovationsFoundations invest“I want to let them know what it

A Gainesville man was arrested 
Friday after he took an unattended 
pair of keys from a Tallahassee gym 
and used them to steal a car.
Jason Evan Barr, 34, was pulled over at about 1:30 p.m. for speeding in the parking lot of the Malcolm Randall Veterans Affairs Medical Center, located at 1601 SW Archer 
Road, according to a report. Officers 
ran a vehicle registration check and found the car was reported stolen to the Tallahassee Police Department on Wednesday.
After he was read his rights, Barr 
— who does not have a driver’s li-cense — told police he saw the pair of keys at the YMCA in Tallahas-see and clicked the button until he found the car. He told police he then 
drove the car to Gainesville because 
he needed a ride.
Officers found a 3 1/2-inch knife 
in Barr’s pocket.
He was arrested on charges of 
grand theft, carrying a weapon and driving without a license. His bond is set at $24,000.

A Gainesville woman was ar-
rested Sunday after police said she 
smashed the window of an apart-
ment and tried to punch a woman.
Shortly before 3 a.m., police saw 
24-year-old Deasha Janell Jacobs trying to get inside of the 5415 NW 20th Court residence. A woman and three children were inside, accord-ing to a report.
Jacobs shattered the living room 
window. With her torso hanging over the windowsill, she tried to 
punch the woman inside before po-
lice pulled her out and arrested her as she ignored their commands.
Jacobs was arrested on charges of 
burglary on an occupied residence, attempted battery and resisting an officer. Her bond is set at $30,000.

Two years ago, Darryl was 
waiting to be euthanized. A large 
hole rested in the roof of the stray 
cat’s mouth, making it difficult to 
eat and drink but easy to contract infections.
On Wednesday, the 8-year-old 
Siamese mix had a metal plate im-planted surgically into Darryl’s mouth — something that had nev-er been done before by UF.
It was the first type of proce-
dure that combined the UF Col-lege of Dentistry and College of Veterinary Medicine.
Darryl was on the euthaniza-
tion list when UF veterinarian Dr. Julie Levy found him during one of her volunteer shifts at the Ala-chua County Humane Society.
“When I met Darryl, I started 
thinking of how we might be able to help him at the vet school,” Levy said.   
Some cats are born with a small 
hole in their mouths, but it’s a mystery to how Darryl received 
his injury. His defect was so se-
vere, it needed to be treated with surgery.  
“We suspect he had some kind 
of trauma to his skull that we’ll never know about,” Levy said.
She needed to find a way to 
cover the hole in Darryl’s mouth. Levy decided to contact UF Health 
Shands Hospital’s dental surgeon 
and prosthodontist Dr. Fong Wong.
Wong then made Darryl an 
acrylic cast for the roof of his mouth.
For two months, the acrylic cast 
enabled Darryl to eat, drink and groom normally, but it was only 
temporary. For a more perma-
nent solution, Wong made a metal prosthesis for Darryl. 
Within hours, his anesthesia wore off, and Darryl was eating food and grooming himself again.
The surgery was a success for 
both colleges, Levy said.
“This was groundbreaking, 
and I’m hopeful that other animals that could not have this opportu-nity in the past can be saved now,” 
Levy said.
Wong said she enjoyed the chal-
lenge of creating a metal plate for 
Darryl, and she was glad to help.
“With this approach, it will im-

Fireball Cinnamon Whisky was recalled 
in Europe last week for containing traces of 
a chemical found in antifreeze, but the an-
nouncement hasn’t frozen local sales.
The ABC Fine Wine & Spirits on South-
west Archer Road sells about 10 to 15 cases 
of the cinnamon whiskey per week, said 
manager Charles Fleenor, and even after 
news broke of the whiskey’s use of propyl-ene glycol, he said he hasn’t seen sales dip.
“That’s just on an average week,” he 
said. “That’s not even including when we 
have home games.”Fleenor said the store typically sells 
about five or six cases of Jägermeister and 
about 12 cases of Jack Daniel’s whiskey per week in comparison, but Fireball appeals to 
a younger crowd.
“When everyone found out it was in 
Europe, they kind of chilled a little bit,” he 
said. “If it had been recalled here, trust me, there’s no way we would still have it on the 
shelf.”
According to Fireball’s website, a ship-
ment intended for North America was ac-
cidentally sent to Europe, which does not 
allow more than 1 gram per kilogram of 
propylene glycol in the whiskey. Fireball recalled the wrongly delivered batches and plans to have the correct batches back on European shelves within three weeks.
Andrew Pentland of Gator Beverage Inc. 
said the local liquor store on the corner of West University Avenue and 12th Street hasn’t seen a drop in Fireball sales either.
“When I first heard about it, my thought 
was that people would definitely say some-thing about it, even if they were still go-ing to buy it,” the 22-year-old said. “But I haven’t heard any customers mention it.”
According to the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration’s website, propylene glycol can be ingested over a long period of time in large quantities without causing health hazards. The chemical is actually common 
and found as an additive in a variety of 
food items, including salad dressing, ice cream and beer.
Yet, while the FDA recognizes the chem-
ical as safe, UF senior James Martingano said people should proceed with caution. 
“When something says FDA-approved, 
it’s not immediately like, ‘Oh, OK, this is a 
good item to put into something you con-
sume,’” the 21-year-old psychology stu-dent said.
Dylan Sobien, a 28-year-old food and re-
source economics senior, said the media is 
partly to blame for the sensationalism.
“I feel like people like to blow it out of 
proportion,” he said.Fireball Whisky sales not affected in Gainesville despite recall

Nancy Ward voted alone 
for the first time last year. She 
tapped a screen, chose candi-dates and proudly stuck an “I Voted” sticker onto her chest.
In the past, she needed the 
help of poll workers because of her disability, but not this year.
Juan Gilbert and his Prime 
III voting machine made her dream of voting independently into a reality.
Gilbert, a UF researcher and 
professor, created the first uni-
versal voting machine in the 
world. Gilbert’s machine al-lows all voters to tap screens, speak, or blow into a micro-phone if they can’t articulate a name, hear audio instructions through headphones and see pictures to vote.
Gilbert said Ward and other 
voters with disabilities tested his machine successfully in 2013.
The machine and software 
have been used in elections in Wisconsin and Oregon, and they will be used in New Hampshire’s election Tuesday. 
“We were the first to do 
this in a time that people said it couldn’t be done,” said Gilbert, the 45-year-old developer.
It took more than a decade 
for the final version to be built, and it all started with a speech.
Gilbert and his team lis-
tened to an expert in the field of human-centered computing say a universal voting design was not possible.
“I thought that wasn’t ac-
ceptable,” Gilbert said. “We work on things that fix societal issues, so we went back to the lab and began working.”
Since then, the machine has 
been tested on thousands of people, including the blind, deaf and elderly, he said.
“The diversity of our testing 
covers the broadest area of test-ing I’ve ever seen,” he said.
In the November 2012 elec-
tion, turnout among people with disabilities was 5.7 percent 
lower than people without dis-
abilities, according to Rutgers University.
Gilbert said there was a large 
increase in voters with disabili-ties when Prime III was used in Oregon.
“Just in terms of equality and 
voter participation, it is revolu-
tionary,” said Beth Rosenson, 
a UF political science associate professor.
Gilbert used a $4.5 million 
grant from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission to de-velop the Prime III technology.
He said he has reached out 
to election supervisors in Flor-
ida about using the machine in 
the future.
“We developed and tested 
it everywhere,” Gilbert said. “Now it’s in our own backyard, so why don’t we test it here in 
Florida?”First universal voting

inability to reach voting machines • 
basic mobility issues • 
location issues • 
difficulty operating machines •

trust me, there’s no way we would 
still have it on the shelf.”

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgFriday’s question: Are you dressing up 
for Halloween?Today’s question: Do you think the Gators will beat the 
Seminoles? Street harassment: problem for all races
Last week, the website Hollaback published a video on New York City street harassment that quickly went viral. The video featured a woman, who ap-
peared to be white, walking around New York City while a hidden camera captured all of the harassment she en-dured for 10 hours. The problem with the video, as many viewers online have already pointed out, is that it strange-ly leaves out almost all of the harassment perpetrated by white men.
The ﬁ  nal scene of the video is a text presentation that 
stated  the street harassment involved “people of all back-grounds.” But it seems that the only instances that made the cut during the video-editing process were times when the woman was being bothered by young men of color — black and Latino men, speciﬁ  cally.
This video took the very serious issues of street harass-
ment and women’s inability to exist in peace publically and added a racial element to them. Rob Bliss Creative, the ﬁ  rm that worked on the video with Hollaback, responded to the criticism that only people of color were made to appear as street harassers. A representative stated even though “a fair amount of white guys” also made unwant-ed passes at the woman in the video, they don’t appear in the video because “a lot of what they said was in passing or off camera.”
A majority of women in our society experience street 
harassment at the hands of men of all backgrounds. A few weeks ago, I went out with friends, and six members in our group of eight people were women. As we walked down West University Avenue to and from our destina-tion, our group was catcalled from people in passing cars a whopping six times. And each time, the car was full of young, white men.
The issue with that Hollaback video is because white 
men were left off camera, white men are being left out of the street harassment narrative. I’m not sure how difﬁ  cult it would have been to turn the camera so that more exam-ples of those white men ended up on the video, but my gut tells me it couldn’t have been all that hard.
Meanwhile, because young 
men of color are the ones shown in the video, they will continue to be seen as the main perpetrators of this behavior. The Hollaback 
video added to a collection of media that has been grow-ing for centuries that tells women to fear men of color. It is why women don their most disinterested face — common-ly called “resting bitch face” — when they walk by men of color. For years, they have been receiving the message that they will be harassed and need to brace themselves.
This narrative that tells women to fear men of color 
does a disservice to almost all parties involved. Black and Latino men are stereotyped and feared. Women leave themselves vulnerable to harassment and attacks by white men because they’re conditioned to keep a watchful eye on men of color, not white men.
The truth is that men of all kinds can be street harassers. 
A video showing primarily men of color in plainclothes as the guilty party, when in reality white men and men in business suits engage in just as much harassment, is either a poorly done video or a video with a racial agenda. If we want to see a society without street harassment, we need to stop thinking of perpetrators as a single group of men and understand that all men need to be educated on the role they play in ending this epidemic.
For starters, men could take a stand when they witness 
street harassment happening. If you feel comfortable and safe enough in the moment to do so, letting other men know that street harassment is not OK is a small step in the right direction.
TehQuin Forbes is a UF sociology junior. His columns ap-
pear on Mondays.Alachua County is currently facing a massive shortfall in 
funding for road repairs and other transportation spend-ing. According to The Gainesville Sun, the county faces a 
$550 million backlog of road repairs, transit improvements and other transportation projects.
The County Commission approved the placement of a mea-
sure on the ballot to address Alachua County’s lack of adequate transportation funding. The proposal, Moving Alachua County Forward, would institute an eight-year, 1-cent increase to the sales tax. The measure would raise about $30 million per year for a total of about $250 million over the eight years.
Unlike 2012’s Fix Our Roads initiative, which was rejected by 
Alachua County voters, the new proposal addresses other trans-portation concerns beyond road repairs. About 40 percent of the 
funding would go toward transit, and another 5 percent would 
be spent on improvements for bike riders and pedestrians. This funding distribution appropriately reﬂ  ects the diversity of Ala-chua County’s transportation environment and the need for across-the-board improvements.
There are some legitimate concerns about whether the pro-
posed sales tax is overly regressive and unfair to Gainesville’s low-income residents. However, the surtax will not apply to many of these individuals’ most basic purchases, such as grocer-
ies. In addition, projections indicate that a large portion of the 
total revenue collected from the surtax — as much as 30 percent — will be paid by visitors to Gainesville and Alachua County, rather than local residents.
Gainesville’s low-income residents would also strongly ben-
eﬁ  t from the approval of Moving Alachua County Forward. Part of the proposal includes a plan to extend bus service to ease the workday commutes of Alachua’s low-income workers.
The creation of an advisory board to oversee the new trans-
portation projects is another important component of the pro-posal. The advisory board, which will include representation of Gainesville, Alachua County and the outlying municipalities, will help ensure the funds are spent in a responsible manner and in ways that truly serve the best interests of Alachua voters.
Although the initiative is a good ﬁ  rst step toward ﬁ  xing Ala-
chua’s transportation funding gap, it is not enough. Raising the sales tax is more politically expedient than raising property taxes. However, the $250 million the new proposal would raise is not 
nearly sufﬁ  cient to address all of the improvements that must 
be made to Alachua’s transportation infrastructure. A property tax increase will undoubtedly be a tough sell politically, but it is likely the only way to bring the county’s transportation budget up to the necessary level.
The longer Alachua County voters wait to approve new 
sources of transportation funding, the more the costs of improv-ing the county’s infrastructure will grow. The new proposal is not perfect, but it is good enough to deserve public support. The Alligator encourages a vote of Yes on the Moving Alachua 
County Forward proposal.New transportation

President Barack Obama killed the political ideal-
ist.
I expect that the campaigning for the 2016 
presidential election will be lackluster in the public’s eye compared to 2008 campaigning because American voters have witnessed the dwindling of an uplifting campaign from the Obama administration.
Obama relied heavily on 
hope and change as part of his political message and, under-standably, could not deliver the change he promised.
For radical change to happen, it requires a lot of time 
and patience.
If anything, the Obama administration has laid the 
groundwork and foundation for change to happen. The 
purpose of government is to primarily maintain what 
already works, such as the U.S. Constitution, the Fed-eral Reserve and the Constitutional Budget Office.
As New York Times opinion columnist David Brooks 
pointed out, “the politics of the last few years have 
made you disappointed, disillusioned and cynical.”
People had high hopes, aspirations and expectations 
when Obama took office in 2008. Although Obama has 
done great things in both of his terms, it’s not enough 
to satisfy what the nation expected.
At the next election, American voters will be looking 
for a resilient world leader. Americans won’t be look-
ing for the seemingly perfect political candidate who can be expected to do no wrong.
No longer are we looking for a savior. We want a re-
alist who understands that government consists of core functions that counteract negative actions.
People also vote for the candidate who promises the 
biggest impact. Over time, when the winning candidate fails to deliver the promised results, people become dis-appointed, and it becomes a cycle of highs and lows.
Although Obama failed to deliver the promise for 
large-scale change, the current administration has seen 
a massive improvement following the Bush administra-
tion.
The Huffington Post outlined several reasons 
“Obama is one of the best presidents ever” and listed 
reasons such as his advocacy for equal rights, peace, 
environment and education.
In addition, Washington Monthly listed the top 50 
accomplishments of the Obama administration. Most of these accomplishments fall under the economy and the 
end of the war in Iraq.
I believe most people will be concerned for econom-
ic growth, foreign policy and affairs in the coming elec-
tion.
Voters are going to look toward a leader with ex-
tensive experience in politics — beyond anyone else in recent years. I expect the candidates will continue the work and progress made by the Obama administra-tion.
Like many political issues, health care and education 
reform will take many years before coming into effect, which is something that voters fail to understand.
When the nation demands that these types of chang-
es happen, they’re often met with disappointment.
This disappointment has impacted many Americans 
who will come into the next election with a more cyni-cal belief toward politics, and there’s absolutely noth-ing wrong with this view.
America’s voters need to be more realistic about cur-
rent affairs and the approach to solutions. The political idealists will have to lower their ideals when they vote in 2016.

UWireInstagram has been busy this week with people 
posting pictures of gas stations with low prices, something that most would deem a miracle. Here 
in Florida, everyone is ecstatic that prices are falling below $3 a gallon, which marks a four-year low for the state.
Lower gas prices are a positive thing for most peo-
ple. Consumers are able to save money and increase their disposable income for other goods and services, such as going out to eat more or seeing an extra movie or two at the theater.
A common belief held by most economists suggests 
that for every 1-cent decrease in the price of a gallon of gas, there is an additional $1 billion increase in nation-wide household consumption. This shock to the econ-omy is definitely welcome in these uncertain times.
Consumers aren’t the only ones who rejoice at 
paying less for gas. Typically, with decreased energy costs, we also see businesses able to increase their profits, which can mean possible job creation or more investment and growth in the economy.
The interesting thing about economics is that when-
ever something is supposedly only a positive, there is almost always something negative that follows.
How can lower gas prices possibly be bad for any-
body? Higher gas prices might squeeze most people at the pump, but it’s great for the energy boom that America has enjoyed over the last few years. Accord-ing to the Wall Street Journal, “high oil prices in re-cent years drove the energy boom by making costly 
drilling techniques like hydraulic fracturing economi-
cally feasible. Now, oil-rich states could see slow job growth. Producers would see profits tumble. And in-vestors are already retrenching from one of the hottest 
sectors of the expansion.”
North Dakota, one of these oil-rich states with the 
profitable Bakken shale, was able to bypass most of 
the devastating effects that came with the Great Reces-sion. In fact, the state had the fastest-growing econo-
my in the country last year, enjoying a growth rate of 
9.7 percent and an unemployment rate of 2.8 percent. If the price of a barrel of oil continues to drop below its average price of $85 right now, it could see slower, 
and possibly reversed, job growth.
These reductions in gas prices also mean lower 
profits for big oil companies, a situation that doesn’t 
upset some people who see them as greedy and de-structive. This characterization is debatable, but what 
these lower gas prices certainly do mean is something 
that should concern everybody: decresed investment into alternative energy sourc-es.
Anthony Perl, a professor 
at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, said, “The 
incentives for conservation and alternative energy will be reduced in the short term.” This could mean 
less advancement toward research and development 
toward new sources of energy, an endeavor that has constantly dealt with the problem of making strides and then hitting the brakes.
Deeper issues reside with lower gas prices. Some-
times it’s an indication of an impending recession or negative shock. Gregg Laskoski, senior oil analyst at GasBuddy.com, said, “We are all somewhat pleased to see prices going lower at the pump, but I’m not 
sure it’s cause for celebration. It’s still an indication of 
much deeper problems in our economy.”
The decline in prices has already affected the stock 
market. Last Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped nearly 500 points in one day, follow-
ing with the move of lower gas prices, according to 
Fortune magazine. The stock market and oil prices are connected, and both rely upon confidence and stabil-ity to remain healthy and grow.
Although oil prices are pretty much set by world 
demand and supply and by OPEC, there are some things that our policymakers could do to help.
As previously mentioned, the stock market and oil 
prices prosper from clarity and confidence. Currently, 
investors and business owners experience confusion 
and instability when we don’t have a clear trajectory for our federal deficit and tax code.
When we confuse our policies and play political 
games, we hurt economic growth and increased in-vestment. In a dream world, Congress would begin to reduce the federal deficit drastically and replace our complicated tax code with something ever-changing that isn’t filled with loopholes — something like the 
FairTax.
All of our wallets might be a little thicker right 
now, which is a great start to the holiday season where 
people might be more inclined to spend this extra cash 
instead of just holding onto it.
However, be wary about what these prices also 
bring: less investment in alternative energy and a pos-
sible transition from recovery to recession.

This morning marked the 
exodus of Gainesville’s visiting 
punks.
The three-day music festival 
that took over downtown for 
the 13th time left Fest-goers with 
memories of friends and their fa-
vorite bands.
Punk veterans the Descen-
dents drew a crowd of about 
4,000 when they performed 
on Bo Diddley Communi-
ty Plaza as Fest freshmen 
Saturday night, kicking 
their set off with the 
classic “Everything Sux.”
Famous for 
their fast-paced drumming, hard-hitting 
lyrical delivery and an exploding 
energy on stage, lead singer Milo 
Aukerman gave a shoutout to 
Volta Coffee, Tea & Chocolate for 
keeping him pumped throughout the set.
“It’s so great to be back in 
Gainesville,” he said. “Although, 
why is it so f*****g cold?”
He wasn’t the 
only one asking 
that question. 
Temperatures on 
Saturday hit a high 
of only 57 degrees, with 
gusts of wind from 25 to 
30 mph, and a low of 42 
degrees, but that didn’t keep 
fans away.
“The wind sucked, 
but seeing the De-
scendents was, 
like, magi-
c a l , “ said Jeremy Smith from Harts-
ville, South Carolina. “It’s like 
seeing the people who are the 
best at what they do in the uni-
verse.”
He and three friends drove six 
hours to Gainesville for his first Fest, a trip they had been plan-
ning since the summer.
“I’ve been to Gainesville a few 
times before, but never for Fest,” 
he said. “It’s been really awe-some.”
Fans hailed from all 50 states 
and 24 countries, including Lat-
via, Singapore and Costa Rica. Several international bands per-formed as well.
“My favorite part was actually 
seeing the bands from Mexico,” 
said Michael McKiernan about 
Dolores, a group that played 
at Durty Nelly’s Irish Pub 
on Friday. “They really 
care, and they’re really into it. Some don’t even 
speak English, but they 
work hard, and they’re 
out, and they feel it.”
McKiernan and his friend 
Jim Cox drove from Tampa 
to catch some sets this week-
end after attending Big 
Pre-Fest in Little Ybor 
last week. For 
McKiernan, this 
is his ninth Fest; 
for Cox, his sev-
enth. They and other Fest veterans were ex-cited about the expansion to the 
plaza.
“I like it,” McKiernan said, “es-
pecially compared to the Florida 
Theater: It wasn’t the right place, especially considering the staff. 
Early on, the venue was great, but 
when it became a dance club, the 
staff didn’t understand who we 
are, so it was really awkward.”
The expansion not only 
pleased the fans, but the organiz-ers. Jason Rockhill, who kept tabs 
on Bo Diddley, said all three days 
ran well and that he is looking forward to seeing what they can do with the space next year.
“I was excited about the pros-
pects, and it’s exceeded my ex-
pectations.” he said. “It’s gone so smoothly.”
Other venues around town 
experienced similar success, with fans packing :08 on Sunday night 
during Philadelphia-emo-band 
Modern Baseball’s set and The Atlantic for Canadian-punk-
band Single Mothers on Sat-urday.
A love of music was 
not the only love cir-culating downtown this weekend. In the middle 
of indie-punk Lemuria’s Fri-
day-night set, a man proposed to his girlfriend on stage, and she said yes.
“Lemuria is kind of adorable 
in that way,” Rockhill said. “A certain kind of emo boy would propose to his girlfriend during a 
Lemuria set.”
Aside from a single reported 
arrest Saturday, Gainesville Po-
lice Lt. Brian Helmerson said the 
weekend went “phenomenally.”
Helmerson said the Fest orga-
nizers put a lot of effort into their preparation and organization of 
this year’s festival, and as of Sun-day night, there were no reported noise complaints.
“They took care of it all in 
preparation and coordination 
with the police department and other entities in the city,” Hel-
merson said. “They also followed all the recommendations for pub-
lic safety and public cleanliness. 
They did a great job.”

UF students experienced 
their own personalized organ 
recital in the University Audi-torium on Saturday.   
At the biannual UF Pipe 
Organ Demonstration, stu-dents and alumni sat on the auditorium stage to listen to songs from composers, such as Johann Sebastian Bach, played from the 89-year-old pipe or-gan. About 20 UF students and alumni gathered at 1 p.m. to learn about the organ’s near 
5,000 metal pipes.
“The organs were one of 
the first things here, and I 
think it’s an important invest-ment,” said Laura Ellis, a UF associate professor of music. 
Scott Ziegler, a UF first-
year organ performance grad-uate student, performed at the demo for the first time. Ziegler said while complex, the organ is a fascinating instrument.  
“A lot of people don’t re-
ally know how it works,” 
Ziegler, 23, said, “so it’s nice 
to open up our doors and get people in and explain how the instrument works.”
Ellis said the demonstra-
tion is a different experience each time.
“What’s interesting about 
these is that the studio mem-
bers, compositions and litera-
ture change every time,” she said. “but they still keep the same talking points.”UF holds biannual

Andrew Ragsdale said his 11-year-old 
son quit baseball to play ultimate.
His son is just one of many Gainesville 
children who will play in Gainesville’s new 
youth ultimate league, organized by UF’s men’s and women’s ultimate club teams and the local ultimate community.
Ragsdale, one of the league’s organiz-
ing members, said the league was created to give local middle school and high school students an organized way to play and 
teach them about the game.
“It’s an investment in our future,” said 
men’s team vice president Billy O’Bryan, 
a UF nuclear engineering sophomore. “In general, ultimate is a small sport, so we all 
want it to grow.”Students can play in the league from 
noon to 1:30 p.m. at Citizens Field each Sunday until Nov. 23. Boys and girls of all 
skill levels are encouraged to attend.
The men’s and women’s club teams 
will help teach the players how to throw discs, run defense drills and set up offen-
sive plays, Ragsdale said. In December, the 
teams will host a tournament for all youth participants.
On the league’s first day of play, Oct. 26, 
O’Bryan said about 50 students played on three full fields.
“It was really cool to see,” the 19-year-
old said. “Some of these kids were a lot bet-ter than I expected.”
The men’s club team won national cham-
pionships in 2006 and 2010. Ragsdale said they’ve been great mentors to the youth participants.  
“It’s fantastic,” he said. “They really are 
a great group of individuals. A lot of these 
kids don’t realize they have the cream of 
the crop teaching them.”
One of the sport’s main draws to youth 
is it only requires a disc and field to play, 
Ragsdale said. His goal is to grow the fast-
paced sport to every local middle and high school so students don’t have to travel across the city to play. UF ultimate clubs help organize Gainesville youth league
“They really are a great group of 
individuals. A lot of these kids don’t 
realize they have the cream of the 
crop teaching them.”

UF coach Paul Spangler’s 
cross country team had a subpar outing at the SEC Championships. Read more: alligatorSports.org.Fun Fact
After Florida rushed for 418 yards against Georgia on Saturday, the Bulldogs rushing defense dropped from 13th in the country to 48th.UF soccer lands ﬁ  ve players on All-SEC teams Sunday
UF forward Savannah Jordan, midﬁ  elder Havana Solaun and defenders Tessa Andujar and Christen Westphal were named to the All-SEC ﬁ  rst team. Defender Claire Falknor was named to the All-SEC second team.JORDAN MCPHERSON
Alligator Staff Writer @J_McPherson1126
JACKSONVILLE — Heading into his ﬁ  -
nal season with the Gators, redshirt senior 
Mike McNeely contributed mostly on special teams.
At the end of fall practice before the 2014 
season, UF coach Will Muschamp — a former walk-on himself when he played at UGA from 1991-1994 — had two of his 85 scholarships available. McNeely earned one of them.
“Mike has been a fantastic special teams 
player and just a wonderful young man and has done everything we’ve asked him to do,” Muschamp said on Aug. 22, less than an hour after awarding McNeely his scholarship. “He 
will be a huge contributor on special teams.”
But during Florida’s 38-20 win against No. 
11 Georgia (6-2, 4-2 Southeastern Conference) 
on Saturday at EverBank Field, McNeely pro-vided the biggest contribution of his career.
On fourth and 9 in the ﬁ  rst quarter with 
the Gators (4-3, 3-3 SEC) trailing 7-0, kicker Frankie Velez trotted out to the ﬁ  eld with Mc-Neely as his holder — a ﬁ  rst this season for the 
wide receiver.
After receiving the ball from long snapper 
Drew Ferris, McNeely ran to his right. Mc-
Neely sprinted to the endzone unscathed for a 21-yard touchdown to tie the game.
“It opened right up, it was the perfect play 
call. The guys blocking up front did a tremen-dous job,” McNeely said. “All I had to do was run. I’ll never forget this for the rest of my life. It was a great call.”
Added Muschamp: “He’s earned his schol-
arship now. But he’s a hard-playing, fast, 
quick, good athlete. I mean he can line up 
and play receiver as well as some of our guys. That’s the type of guy he is.”
The Gators practiced the fake ﬁ  eld goal 
throughout the past week, and Muschamp knew players needed to be committed in order for the play to be a success.
“A little bit of it is the element of surprise,” 
Muschamp said. “We coach hard with our 
guys about being excited about ﬁ  eld-goal 
blocks. They didn’t come to Florida to be on ﬁ  eld-goal blocks. … A lot of guys take those downs off. We felt like we had a chance to ex-ecute and make a play and gain some momen-tum. And we did.”
The last time Florida had a successful fake 
ﬁ  eld goal was during its 20-17 win against Texas A&M on Sept. 8, 2012, when holder 
John Crofoot threw a three-yard completion to 
tight end Clay Burton on fourth and 1.“We take situations in every game that we 
have things up, whether it’s punts, ﬁ  eld goals — it’s all about the look,” Muschamp said. “We got the look we wanted and it was a fan-tastic job by our players.”
Muschamp takes pride in McNeely be-
cause of his work ethic on and off the ﬁ  eld. In addition to his special teams role, the 5-foot-8 receiver also works as a part-time bagger and 
cashier at a Gainesville-area Publix.
Still, McNeely found out about two weeks 
ago that his career path will extend beyond football or being a self-proclaimed “bashier.”
On Oct. 15, McNeely learned that he was 
accepted to UF’s medical school.
“I know that I have a future,” McNeely 
said. “God has blessed me so much and I’m 
just so thankful.”
Added Muschamp: “I use him as an ex-
ample for some of our guys all the time. ‘You guys complain about the food. You guys com-
plain about this. Why don’t you … go do what 
he does.’ The guy’s unbelievable. He’s a great kid.”

No. 11 Georgia on Saturday at EverBank Field in Jacksonville.
McNeely sparks Florida with fake field goal touchdown
JOHNSON’S JOURNAL
JACKSONVILLE — Will Muschamp’s eyes seemed to 
well up with tears at the podium as he spoke of a man who died in May — a man he wished would have been 
in the stands Saturday at EverBank Field to share the vin-dicating 38-20 victory over the No. 11 Georgia Bulldogs.
He said that man, his father Larry, was on his mind as 
the seconds ticked down in his ﬁ  rst ever victory against 
the Bulldogs as a head coach. 
Muschamp didn’t say much about his father. He said 
he didn’t want to get started because “I’ll get emotional,” 
but it was clear everything about the victory over the ri-vals meant more than the normal ones.This was Georgia. This was different.Florida won Will’s way Satur-
day, the style that prompted him to boast after the 2012 win over Florida State “You better learn how to ﬁ  t the power and the 
counter when you play Florida.” 
Florida ﬁ  nished with 418 rush-
ing yards — the ﬁ  fth-most in school history and the sec-
ond most Georgia has ever given up to an opponent in the history of its program. UF earned its rushing yards on 60 carries, the fourth-
most in school history, against only six passes.
They imposed their will on offense and stiﬂ  ed Georgia 
on defense, allowing the Bulldogs only 38 rushing yards in the ﬁ  nal three quarters after being gashed in the open-ing stanza by running back Nick Chubb. 
After one quarter of play, Georgia had 167 yards of to-
tal offense with 103 of them came on the ground and 101 coming from Chubb.
It looked like business as usual in the early going, like 
Florida would lay down and be run over again, especially Muschamp remembers father in ﬁ  rst win over Georgia

after only running 11 plays at a 
measly 3.8 yards per play.
Then with 8:25 left in the sec-
ond quarter everything changed. 
The most unlikely of heroes 
gave Florida an adrenaline shot when receiver Mike McNeely 
scampered 21 yards untouched 
on a fake field goal to score and tie the game at seven. 
McNeely bags groceries at the 
Westgate Publix every Sunday to 
keep the job he’s held since 2008. 
Muschamp uses the former 
walk-on as an example to schol-arship players with silver spoons 
in their mouths not to take what they have for granted.
Muschamp knows the feel-
ing. He was a walk-on during his playing days at Georgia. 
He wore jersey No. 30 — the 
same one McNeely wore until 
this season.
The Gators never came down 
from the high McNeely gave them 
and carried the energy through the rest of the afternoon.
They leaned on the Bulldogs, 
and even recovered a fumble, the second time anyone’s done that all season to a Georgia team that 
is on pace to break a school re-cord for turnover margin. 
Andre Debose returned a punt 
for 38 yards against a team that 
allowed only 1.86 yards per re-
turn coming into the game. 
Matt Jones ran for a career 
high 192 yards, and Kelvin Taylor 
chipped in 197 in the same build-ing in which his father’s name 
hangs in the Jacksonville Jaguars 
ring of honor.
The red-clad east stands emp-
tied before the clocks hit triple 
zeroes and there were hugs all 
around on the stadium’s oppo-site side doled out by Muschamp. Players, fellow coaches, through my binoculars it looked like he 
even gave an embrace to Com-
munications Director Steve Mc-Clain, happiness for a program that hasn’t had much in a few 
weeks.
He entered the pressroom say-
ing that it was time for him to lift 
the monkey off his back, giving the assembled media one less 
thing to write about. 
He stopped a reporter who 
looked like he was about to ask 
a question during his opening 
statement to “hold on a second 
Robbie, I’ve been waiting a long time for this.”
The talk of firing him won’t go 
away, the calls for a more aerial based attack won’t either. Mus-champ even acknowledged that saying “we actually did have a plan to throw some passes. I 
know I’ll still disappoint a bunch of Florida fans with that.” 
But for one afternoon, he didn’t 
disappoint, for one afternoon the 
outside noise didn’t matter.
Muschamp wouldn’t say what he thought his dad would tell him if he were still alive. 
He didn’t have to, because I’d 
imagine Larry would have been 
pretty damn proud of Will today.� HE LOST TO THE NO. 1 SEED 
PLAYER IN THE TOURNAMENT.

One Gator made it to the semifinals 
in the 2014 USTA Collegiate Clay Court 
Invitational at Walt Disney World this weekend. 
Freshman Chase Perez-Blanco 
dropped to No. 1-seed Clemson’s Hunt-er Harrington (5-7, 6-3, 6-4), though winning his first set in Saturday’s semi-finals match. 
Perez-Blanco defeated fellow Gator 
and No. 5 seed junior Diego Hidalgo (1-6, 6-4, 6-4), stopping Hidalgo in the quarterfinals earlier Saturday morning.
The other two Gators, senior Rich-
ard Brej and freshman Jordan Belga, fell short Friday morning in the tourna-ment.
Brej dropped straight sets in the sec-
ond round to Clemson’s Harrington ( 6-4, 6-0) but won in singles consolation Friday to Auburn University’s Petar Tomic 6-3, 6-4.
Belga lost Round 1 Thursday to Flor-
ida State University’s Marco Nunez, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4. In singles consolations, he lost to Virginia Tech’s Florian Nicoud, 7-6 (6), 6-3.
The Gators tandem Belga and Perez-
Blanco fared well in the “A” doubles. The pair dropped in the semifinals Sat-urday to Florida State University’s Lock and Marco Nunez, 6-0, 6-4.The Hidalgo and Brej tandem in “B” 
doubles dropped in the second round to University of Southern California’s Rob 
Bellamy and Eric Johnson Friday, 8-5.
Though less than half of the Gators 
headed south to represent their No. 23 
ranked team, only 13 schools competed last weekend in the smaller-scale tour-nament.
Ranked No. 37 Florida State Uni-
versity hosted the third annual tourna-ment at the ESPN Wide World of Sports 
Complex. Following UF and FSU, is No. 
55 Miami and No. 69 Central Florida.
Earlier in the tournament: Perez-
Blanco defeated University of Miami’s Wilfredo Gonzalez, 4-6, 6-1, 6-1 in Round 1 and Georgia Tech’s Carlos Benito in Round 2, 6-2, 4-6, 6-4 on Friday.

Florida State University’s No. 4-seed 
Benjamin Lock, 3-6,6-3,6-1
Hidalgo defeated University of South 
Alabama’s Juan Troglia in straight sets, 
6-1, 6-2. The Ecuador native won on Friday against Penn State’s Matt Barry, 6-2, 3-6, 7-6(4). Friday Hidalgo defeated Auburn’s Marko Krickovic (6-4, 6-3) be-fore dropping to Perez-Blanco in quar-terfinals.
Brej defeated Virginia Tech’s George 
Cartledge after dropping second set in Round 2 on Thursday, 7-6(4), 3-6, 6-1.

Over the course of the last month, Flori-
da’s volleyball team has been rolling.
It’s a stretch that has included wins over 
LSU, Texas A&M and Ole Miss — three of the 
Southeastern Conference’s best teams.
Tennessee is not one of them.
The No. 8 Gators out-hit, out-blocked and 
out-played the struggling Volunteers on the 
road, sweeping them in straight sets (25-9, 25-13, 25-18) to earn their thirteenth consecutive victory and twelfth straight conference win.
Florida (18-3, 12-0 SEC) received a major-
ity of its offensive output from sophomore right side hitter Alex Holston, who finished the match with a team-high 17 points, 14 kills and two service aces.
Tennessee (8-17, 1-10 SEC) struggled to 
keep up with Florida, as no UT player had more than seven kills. As a team, the Volun-teers hit just .128 from the floor.
“I thought our team did a really great job 
maintaining their focus, staying to the game plan the entire match,” coach Mary Wise said.
Florida opened up the match with an 8-3 
run, and limited the Vols to just six points for the remainder of the first set. The next set held more of the same for the Gators, at one point jumping out to a 20-8 lead before securing the second set and taking a 2-0 advantage.
UF completed the sweep with help from 
junior Ziva Recek, who came off the bench to finish with six kills and a .545 hitting percent-age, and freshman Rhamat Alhassan, who had nine kills, five total blocks and one ser-vice ace.
“You can just see with Ziva how hard it is for her when she comes off the bench… (but) 
as the set went on she got into a good groove,” 
Wise said. ”But the number I’m most happy about is (Rhamat’s) five blocks. For us to beat the elite teams, it’s going to take both her and 
Simone (Antwi).”
The Vols are one of the youngest teams in 
the SEC — they have only one senior on their 
roster and twelve total underclassmen — and on Sunday they played five freshmen.
As Florida built large leads in its three 
set win, Wise frequently subbed in her younger players to gain experience 
against the rebuilding Ten-
nessee program.
Among the reserves who 
played early in the match was freshman setter Abby 
Detering, who relieved ju-
nior Mackenzie Dagostino.
Dagostino finished with 29 assists while 
Detering had six. 
“In those two sets that Abby played I 
thought her sets to Alex were equally as good 
(as Dagostino’s),” Wise said. “She had some really good setting choices, delivery and tem-po and I think one of Alex’s best swings was 
one off of Abby.”
Next, Florida will travel back to Gainesville 
to host Alabama, which will likely pres-
ent the stiffest competition UF has faced in 
weeks. The Tide are riding a three-match win 
streak and are fresh off a victory against No. 23 Texas A&M.
“(Alabama is) physical, they play high 
above the tape, they’re a very good serving 
team. We will play one of the best right side 
players we’ll play all year,” Wise said. “I think it’ll be an awesome match.”Florida sweeps Tennessee

UF coach Will Muschamp (right) speaks with CBS sideline reporter Allie LaForce following Florida’s 38-
20 win against No. 11 Georgia on Saturday at EverBank Field in Jacksonville.

dying Florida offense.
Each had a career night against 
Georgia, with Taylor running for 
197 yards and Jones tallying 192 of 
his own. 
Each had 25 carries and two 
touchdowns on the ground.
“We knew we were going to 
pound them and pound them and were going to keep pounding them,” Taylor said. “We weren’t going to be denied. We just kept 
running hard, and everything else 
happened.”
Jones and Taylor became Flor-
ida’s ﬁ  rst duo of tailbacks to both 
gain 100 yards in a game since Jeff 
Demps and Chris Rainey accom-
plished the feat in Florida’s 48-10 
win against Kentucky on Sept. 24, 2011. 
It was the ﬁ  rst time in program 
history that the Gators had two players with at least 120 rushing yards apiece, let alone have two 
almost crack the 200-yard barrier.
The Gators’ 418 rushing yards 
were also the ﬁ  fth-most in pro-
gram history and most since Flor-
ida put up 466 as a team and Em-
mitt Smith laid out a single-game program-best 316 yards against New Mexico in 1989.
“I feel like we should have been 
able to run the ball more success-fully all year,” Muschamp said. “For whatever reason, we’ve got-ten away from some things.”
UF’s offensive line set the 
seams for Florida’s ground game to be successful against a Georgia team that had the 13th-best run-ning defense in the nation head-
ing into the game.
Starting left tackle D.J. 
Humphries attributed Florida’s 
success in the trenches to having 
a stronger will to win.
“We just knocked the ﬁ  ght out of them,” Humphries said. “After 
we came out in the second half 
and took it down on them, they 
were done.”

The Gators are riding high.For now, their season has been 
salvaged.
And even though the odds are 
slim, a trip to Atlanta and the SEC Championship game is still in 
reach.
In addition to needing wins 
in its ﬁ  nal two conference games 
against Vanderbilt and South Car-olina in the next two weeks, Flori-
da needs Georgia to lose one more 
conference game and Missouri to drop two SEC contests. 
One of those two has to be 
against SEC East bottom-dweller Tennessee in order for the Gators to claim the SEC East crown.
While the Gators don’t have 
control of how the Bulldogs or 
the Tigers handle their slates, UF still needs to hold up its end of the 
bargain.
And even with the win against 
Georgia, Florida still has room to improve.
It needs to get quarterback Tre-
on Harris and the passing more involved in the game plan.
Harris, who became the ﬁ  rst 
true freshman to start a game for UF since Chris Leak in 2003, had 
as many pass attempts as he did 
rushes — six.
He gained more yards on the 
ground (37) than he did through 
the air (27).
“Offensively, we actually did 
have a plan to throw some passes 
in the game,” Muschamp said. “I know I disappointed some Gator 
fans (Saturday), but why stop run-
ning the ball when you’re able to gain yards running? We were very successful all night.” 
The Gators secondary — which 
was without starting safety Keanu Neal for the bulk of the game after he suffered a high ankle sprain — 
allowed UGA quarterback Hut-
son Mason to throw for 319 yards and go 7 of 9 for 94 yards on third down with ﬁ  ve of those comple-
tions moving the chains.
Florida pressured Mason 
throughout the day with ﬁ  ve dif-
ferent Gators recording eight quarterback hurries, but the pass 
rush tapered out as the game pro-
gressed.
“I wish we had played better 
down the line in terms of cover-
age,” Muschamp said. “We were a 
little loose on some things. … We got tired pass rushing. It’s one of the most exhausting things you can do.”
But for now, Florida is going to 
soak in the win.
“I’m just really happy for 
my players,” Muschamp said. 
“There’s nothing more fun than a 
victorious locker room.”Matt Jones, Kelvin Taylor each rushed for more than 190 yards

With UF down 7-0 in the second quarter, 
it was fourth and 9 from UGA’s 21-yard 
line. Frankie Velez lined up for a ﬁ  eld 
goal attempt, with wide receiver Mike 
McNeely as the holder. The coaching 
staff called a fake ﬁ  eld goal, and Mc-
Neely ran untouched for a 21-yard touchdown.
KEY STAT: 418
Florida rushed for 418 yards on Saturday, which 
is the second-most yards Georgia has given 
up on the ground in the program’s history. 
Georgia’s defense came into the game as the 
second-ranked rush defense in the SEC.
It was also the highest rushing total in an SEC 
game for the Gators since 1975.

TURNING POINT
With about ﬁ  ve minutes left in the third quarter, 
UGA running back Nick Chubb exploded on a 
36-yard run into UF territory, but nickelback 
Brian Poole forced a fumble, which Florida 
recovered, stopping Georgia momentum. 
Taylor was Florida’s leading 
rusher on Saturday, with 197 
yards on 25 carries. He had 
two career-long rushes Sat-
urday — a 44-yard run in the 
second quarter which he later 
surpassed with a 65-yard touchdown run over the 
right sideline. That touchdown sealed UF’s victory by 
putting them up 25 points late in the fourth quarter. 
 A Georgia punt following a three-and-out 
late in the third quarter was returned 38 
yards by Andre Debose to give the Gators 
the ball on Georgia’s  26 yard line. Five 
plays later, Matt Jones scored a touch-
down to put Florida up 31-7 . 
Fowler was consistent with 
the pass rush throughout 
Saturday’s game. He ﬁ  nished 
with six total tackles, 2.5 
tackles for loss, a quar-
terback hurry and sacked 
Hutson Mason for a loss of 
six yards on third down late in the third quarter. 
On fourth and goal on Florida’s 2-yard 
line with a little more than ﬁ  ve minutes 
left in the fourth, Georgia’s Hutson 
Mason threw to Michael Bennett in the 
end zone. It appeared to be caught, but 
safety Marcus Maye made an impressive 
play on the ball and stripped it from Bennett’s hands.
Morrison didn’t have a 
standout spectacular play, 
but he quietly led the Ga-
tors with 15 total tackles 
for the day. That was seven 
more than the second lead-
ing tackler, Vernon Hargreaves III, who had eight.
