A 20-year-old Gainesville man 
was killed early Saturday morn-
ing when he was hit by a car while crossing Southwest 13th Street on 
his scooter. 
Matthew Taylor was turning 
north from Southwest 21st Avenue when he was hit by a northbound Mercedes sedan at about 2 a.m., according to Cpl. Tscharna Senn, spokeswoman for the Gainesville Police Department. 
According to witness reports, 
Taylor and his scooter fell under the car, which eventually caught fire. Members of the Alachua County Fire Department, a secu-rity officer from Shands at UF and 
numerous GPD units arrived at the 
scene following several witness calls reporting the accident, Senn said. It is unknown whether Taylor was wearing a helmet.
Taylor was pronounced dead at 
the scene, and northbound traffic on Southwest 13th Street remained blocked until 6:45 a.m., she said.
Fault has yet to be determined, 
and the crash remains under in-vestigation by GPD officers, Senn said. 
Taylor described himself on Fa-cebook as “a joker at heart … i give alot and will always back anyone up who needs it.” He said hard 
work made him who he was.
According to Facebook, Taylor 
worked as an assistant manager at 
Gator Domino’s and was looking forward to marrying his fiancée, Ashley Haire, whom he’d dated since November of 2006.
Taylor’s Facebook wall displays 
messages from friends, telling how he will be “infinitely missed.” There will be a memorial service for Taylor on Thursday at 11 a.m. at the Williams-Thomas Funeral Home.
Groom challenges bride to cake eating contest 
JACKSONVILLE (AP) — Let them eat cake. The wedding 
cake eating contest may have been a bit unconventional, but what else would guests expect when the groom is one of the world’s top competitive eaters.
Hall Hunt, who can down 63 Krystal burgers in eight min-
utes, and Emily Wright served burgers at their wedding recep-tion in north Florida last month in a nod to Hunt’s past time.
The civil engineer has eaten his way to $60,000 in the past 
five years. The world’s No. 1 competitive eater, Joey Chestnut, was a wedding guest. The bride, groom and Chestnut competed in a cake eating contest at the reception. The bride won.

� BARS ARE HOSTING SHAVED-LEG 
AND HIGH-HEEL NIGHTS.
By ALEXANDER KLAUSNER
Alligator Contributing Writer
It used to be that on certain nights, if you 
wanted a free drink, all you had to do was be 
a lady. 
Now, for some bars, all you have to do is 
wear high heels or shave your legs. 
With the city’s recent talks of discouraging 
ladies nights in Gainesville, a few area bars 
have come up with some creative ways to cir-
cumvent legal problems. But is the effort worth the trouble?
According to city commission candidate 
Ozzy Angulo, contrary to popular belief ladies 
nights in Gainesville are not illegal.
While the Gainesville Office of Equal Op-
portunity is fielding complaints related to discrimination regarding ladies nights around 
town, law enforcement officers are not bang-
ing down bar doors trying to shut anything down.
Under current Gainesville codes, if some-
one were to complain that he or she felt dis-criminated against because a local bar held a 
ladies night, then the Office of Equal Opportu-
nity would investigate that bar. 
Although the threat of complaint is remote, some bars aren’t taking chances. Lux Bar, 211 
W University Ave., has done away with its 
ladies night promotion and switched to new promotions, like their high-heels night.
Many of the bars that have changed their 
promotions are doing so because they don’t want to deal with the hassles of possible com-
plaints and subsequent investi-gations, Angulo said.
Lux owner Steve Nichtberg-
er, like other local bar owners, 
has not heard any complaints about ladies nights in Gainesville. 
“I’ve never heard of a guy complain 
about ladies night and feeling discriminated against,” he said. “Usually they’re happy they don’t have to buy the drinks.”
Other bars, such as Mars Bar and Laser Tag, 
haven’t changed anything at all. Although they are opening themselves up to the pos-
sibility of investigation, they are still offering 
ladies night promotions on Thursdays.
Mars owner Melissa Del Valle said police 
stopped by her establishment to ask if she was aware that ladies nights could be a violation of the city’s ordinance code. 
“Everyone keeps talking about it,” Del 
Valle said. “I hear that Midtown bars are tell-ing them ‘Oh don’t worry guys. We’re not do-
ing ladies night,’ but it really isn’t illegal, so I Gainesville bars skirt ladies night restrictions

Truck containing body parts 
blocks Rhode Island street 
PROVIDENCE, R.I. — It’s an 
innocent enough looking tractor-
trailer, except for the fact that it’s blocking a street in downtown Providence. But what’s inside may 
give the heebie-jeebies to some.
A spokesman for medical in-
strument maker Smith & Nephew 
told The Providence Journal the truck contains human body parts as well as body parts models the company’s using to demonstrate it’s endoscopic surgery instru-ments at the American Orthopae-
dic Society for Sports Medicine 
meeting at the Rhode Island Con-vention Center.
The body parts, mostly isolated 
joints, are used so surgeons can get a feel for the company’s instru-ments, or sharpen their skills.
The truck has been parked in 
the street with permission from the 
city since Tuesday and is sched-
uled to leave Friday.

Palin makes blunder in 
Facebook post
CONCORD, N.H. — Sarah 
Palin incorrectly calls Alaska’s 
Kodiak Island the largest island in America in a Facebook post endorsing a Senate candidate in 
New Hampshire.
The Big Island of Hawaii is 
about 440 square miles larger 
than Kodiak, where Palin and her family were headed Monday.
In endorsing Republican can-
didate Kelly Ayotte, Palin strayed a bit from the facts in praising her for having “won” a case before

As state attorney general, Ay-

� SHANDS WAS IN THE TOP 
50 NATIONALLY IN 8 AREAS.
By MICHAELA TRIMBLE
Alligator Contributing Writer
Shands at UF was ranked in 
eight adult specialties by U.S. 
News & World Report’s 2010-2011 edition of America’s Best 
Hospitals.
The rankings, announced pub-
licly on Thursday, analyzed 4,852 
hospitals in 16 specialties. Each 
hospital was ranked in the four 
areas of reputation, death rate, patient safety and care-related factors such as nursing and pa-
tient services. 
Shands was one of 152 hospi-
tals out of the 4,852 surveyed that 
performed well enough to rank among the top 50 in any of the 
specialties. 
Shands was the highest-ranked 
Florida hospital in four special-
ties. It ranked 32nd nationally 
in heart and heart surgery, 40th 
in kidney disorders, 29th in pul-monology and 25th in urology. 
Shands also ranked 29th na-
tionally in cancer care, 39th in 
neurology and neurosurgery, 39th  in geriatrics and 41st in gas-
troenterology.
Shands was the only Florida 
hospital ranked in pulmonology, and, for the third consecutive year, the state’s highest-ranked hospital in urology, the surgical 
specialty treating diseases and disor-ders of the urinary tracts of male and 
females and the reproductive system of males.
Dr. Johannes Vieweg, UF de-
partment of urology chairman, said he owes much of the success 
in the survey to the recruitment of new faculty.
Vieweg said his department 
would like to reach out and open 
up to more areas, extending prac-tices beyond the Gainesville area to become a provider throughout the state and even the country. 
He said he sees patients visiting 
from other states for the quality care Shands offers.
“Patients really seek out the 
top-ranked programs,” Vieweg said. “I think this will positively reflect on Shands.” 
Dr. Carmen Allegra, chief of 
the division of hematology and 
oncology for the department of medicine, said he owed part of 
his department’s recognition to 
excellent faculty as well.
“We’ve had a tremendous 
number of new faculty join us 
within the last year or two,” Al-legra said. ”Many of them have 
national and international repu-
tations.”
Shands Children’s Hospital 
also received recognition in the 
best children’s hospital rankings. 
The pediatric center ranked 12th in diabetes and endocrinology.

plete list of rankings can be found

NEW YORK — Toyota Motor Corp. said 
Monday it has settled a years-long dispute 
with a U.S. company that had claimed the Japanese automaker used its technology without permission in its hybrids. The deal 
ends a squabble that had briefly threatened 
to block the Prius from being sold in the U.S.
Toyota and Paice LLC said they have set-
tled their patent dispute and agreed to have all lawsuits between them dismissed. The terms were confidential, the companies said. No financial details were disclosed.
“After six years of litigation, we are 
pleased to reach a settlement with Toyota,” said Frances Keenan, chairman of the Paice board, in a statement.
Paice, based in Bonita Springs, had 
claimed that popular Toyota hybrids like the third-generation Prius and the Lexus HS250h contain technology that violated Paice’s patents for hybrid engines.
Paice first sued Toyota in 2004 claiming 
infringement and filed a second lawsuit against the automaker in 2007. Paice asked U.S. trade regulators to block the import of the vehicles to the U.S. Last October, the International Trade Commission, the Wash-
ington, D.C.-based body that investigates 
claims of trade violations, agreed to open its own investigation into the patent dispute.
A trial had been scheduled to begin 
Monday. If the ITC had sided with Paice, a number of penalties could have followed, 
including a possible ban on the import of the 
hybrids using the patented technology.
Toyota and Paice say they have agreed 
that although Toyota’s hybrids contain tech-nology equivalent to that made by Paice, Toyota developed its hybrid technology in-dependently.
On Friday, Paice said it reached an agree-
ment to license its hybrid vehicle technol-
ogy to Ford Motor Co. U.S.-listed shares of 
Toyota fell 43 cents to close at $71.18.Toyota settles patent issueNATIONAL

ELECTIONS
By TARA WIND 
Alligator Contributing Writer
 
The voter registration deadline for 
the fall election is rapidly approaching. 
Voters must register for the Aug. 24 
primary elections by Monday, which 
is also the last day for voters to change party affiliation.
Some of the offices voters can expect 
to see on their ballots are U.S. senator, governor, attorney general, county com-missioner, county judge and school board.
Pam Carpenter, Alachua County su-
pervisor of elections, said it is important 
for everyone to vote.
“It’s our opportunity to have our 
voice be heard, and to choose candidates 
who are going to represent us in the way we want to be represented,” she said.
Registration forms are available at 
VoteAlachua.com, she said. Forms can 
be filled out online but must be printed, 
signed and mailed or brought to the su-pervisor of elections office, located at 111 
SE First Ave.
If a form is mailed, it must be post-
marked by Monday for the voter to be eligible to participate in the primary election.
Recently, voter registration levels 
have been slowly increasing, Carpenter 
said.
She said she wants students to re-
member they must vote in the precinct of their residency.
If students change their residence to 
Alachua County, they need to register here, she said. If students  aren’t chang-ing their residence, then  they need to re-quest an absentee ballot so they can vote while they are in school. 
Dayna Firth, a 
21-year-old political science major, said stu-dents should vote be-
cause she believes it’s 
their most fundamen-tal right as Americans.
She said students 
should register to vote 
to “ensure that your voice makes a dif-ference in the future of our nation.”
Firth is the secretary for the UF Col-
lege Democrats and the vice president for the Florida College Democrats. 
“It is our duty to protect our interests 
as students, locally and nationally,” she said.Voters have less than

Ten Gators have built a self-navigat-
ing submarine.
A team of nine UF engineering stu-
dents and a professor spent about a year 
and hundreds of hours in the lab to con-
struct, test and perfect their model of 
the submarine.
They did not make it to the final cut, 
however, at the 13th annual Interna-tional Autonomous Underwater Vehicle 
Competition in San Diego last week.
 “The difference between victory and 
total failure is very small,” said profes-
sor Erik Schwartz, a consultant for the 
project.
The event invites teams from univer-
sities from all over the world to show 
the abilities of their submarines, which are entirely independent from any hu-
man control. 
The first-place winner this year was 
Cornell University. 
UF has competed since 1996 and was 
the first-place winner in 2005, 2006 and 
2007.
The team’s submarine, called “Sub-
juGator,” weighed between 50 and 60 pounds and included two cameras, two 
computers, six thrusters, two shooters, 
one grabber, a compass and a thermom-eter among other mechanics, said Ce-dric Adam, a mechanical engineering 
student who worked on the project.
The submarine’s basic mechanical 
core was the same as the one used in the 
past three years, but each year students make significant improvements on the 
software and motors.
The competition requires the sub-
marines to locate, shoot at and pick up 
objects. 
During the competition, the UF team 
was doing well until the final round, when the cir-cuits moving the propellers malfunctioned. The sub-
marine went around in circles until the students gave up and pulled it out of the water.
“A fish with only one fin can only 
swim in circles,” Schwartz said, describ-ing the SubjuGator’s dysfunctional mo-tor driver. 
On their way home Monday, the stu-
dents were already discussing ways to 
improve their submarine model for next 
year. UF sub breaks at event

Today’s question: Did you wait 
until you were 21 to drink?Thursday’s question: Would you 
visit a Christian night club?
152 TOTAL VOTES21% YES
79% NOThe city may have hammered the last nail in the coffin 
for ladies night months ago, but that’s not stopping 
local wells from walking on the razor’s edge to get 
around the now-illegal, yet oh-so-common, promotion.
Rather than mourn the death of free booze for broads, 
bars like Grog House and Rue Bar have gotten proactive. 
Introducing the new specials, which are the same as the old 
specials. Whether you name it “shaved-leg night,” “high-
heel night,” or exactly what it is—loophole abuse—it’s just 
a clever way for our favorite dives, clubs and haunts to get 
around the law.
Theoretically, you don’t have to be a member of the 
fairer sex to get one of those bottomless, white plastic 
cups—any Tom, Dick or Harry with milky smooth calves 
could get away with drinking for free at Grog House on a 
Wednesday night. But paying for that pitcher of Natural 
Light is probably preferable to explaining all those nicks 
and cuts on your thighs to your bro friends.
We understand why bars want to keep the status quo—
getting a bunch of girls to patronize a college sweatbox is 
a surefire way to get guys to come in and slap their paper, 
or plastic, on the bar and join in on the fun. Plus, if the 
drinks are free for the ladies, then guys have to spring for 
the good stuff to turn any heads.
But the problem with ladies night wasn’t discrimina -
tion, it was  something much bigger: binge drinking.
Sure, it stings a little having to pay for drinks when you 
see how effortlessly teenag—uh—20-somethings get their 
umpteenth, free vodka-cranberry, but it’s not hard to get 
over. What is hard to get over is enabling and encouraging 
young women to drink as much as they want or can in an 
environment filled with strangers who can’t wait to sidle 
out into that alleyway behind Midtown and facilitate some 
bad decisions.
We aren’t trying to weave a horror story here, but if 
we were we wouldn’t have to tread too far from reality to 
prove that bad things can happen when a lot of free booze 
is involved. 
That’s why the law was made in the first place. Maybe 
there is some sort of discriminatory aspect to ladies night, 
but the ban had a secondary objective to curb binge drink -
ing. The solution: fight fire with fire. Or in this case, fight 
loophole abuse with loophole abuse.
Bars exist because they are profitable. It wouldn’t be 
hard for any local well to make bank at 4 a.m. on Easter 
Sunday if it were  allowed to be open. It would be hard 
to make Wednesdays and Thursdays a boon to their bot -
tom lines if everyone walking in had shaved legs and heels 
though.
Maybe it would be a little embarrassing for guys to ask 
for free drinks on the basis of their legs being freshly shav -
en, but we worked out the alibi for you: Just meet all those 
condescending looks from bouncers and bartenders with a 
quick story about how you decided to take up professional 
swimming. 
It might seem a little too unbelievable at first, but trust 
us—after a few free drinks, you won’t really care that much 
at all. Just be vigilant about keeping those legs smooth—
nobody likes those second-day pricklies.Drinking

Guest column
If you asked me why I waited until my 21st birthday to 
drink, I could tell you a number of reasons. For one, my 
big sister waited until her 21st, so that’s what I thought 
you were supposed to do. She has always been my role mod -
el. Two, I’m stubborn, and I had told people a while ago that 
I was waiting until my 21st birthday to drink. I had made up 
my mind, but they doubted me or told me I’d go wild once I 
arrived at college. This fueled my fire even more to keep my 
word. And three, it doesn’t sit well with me to think of doing 
anything illegal. I’m just one of those people who is para -
noid of getting in trouble for no good reason. I’d get nervous 
when an officer would walk by me in the halls when I was 
in middle school—palms sweaty, heart racing, the whole 
deal—and I never did anything wrong. I guess you could say 
I’m a stickler for rules, and I’m OK with that.
So, at the handful of house parties I’ve been to in my three 
years at UF, and during the many nights out dancing at clubs, 
I just got used to saying, “No, thank you. I don’t drink,” when 
an offer came my way. I’d hold my cup of water, and some -
times people wouldn’t even realize I wasn’t drinking.
But not being 21 began to get annoying when my sister hit 
the big mile marker two years ago. Being denied from many 
clubs, bars and even restaurants made me want to scream, 
and I’m not an angry person. It became a blockade in our 
friendship, a limit on our outings and a separation of sorts. 
Once, we got all dressed up and went to the Hard Rock. I 
think we approached the doors of about 10 places and were 
turned away. “I don’t even want to drink,” I’d say. “I just 
want to come in and sit with her.” No dice.
After recently being turned down from the Starlight 
Room night club in our hotel on a family trip to San Fran -
cisco, and then more recently by Market Street Pub in down -
town Gainesville, I had about had it with being underage.
But last Wednesday it all ended, and I awoke a free bird, 
a woman with access. I turned 21. That night, I went to Mid -
town with 21 friends for one of the most fun nights ever. We 
started with dinner at The Swamp. Appropriately, my sister bought me my first drink. The wait -
ress didn’t ID me - after all, I was 
wearing a tiara and a “21 Things” 
sign - but I flashed my license at her 
anyway. What once was my ticket to “no” now became my 
all-access pass. Finally, I would unveil the beloved world 
of booze. I would learn what Grey Goose, peach schnapps, 
black raspberry, pineapple and Sprite tasted like together. I 
would be allowed into 101 Cantina and Salty Dog and Balls 
when I arrived in the coming hours. And, yes, I would be that 
loud, obnoxious freshly 21-year-old girl stumbling through 
Midtown in stilettos with a giant sign around her neck.
I enjoyed a few shots with funny names and kept describ -
ing a warm sensation in my face and throat. I enjoyed sipping 
shots because they were so flavorful, much to the chagrin of 
the people who bought them for me who expected me to kick 
them back in one gulp.
I danced, I met people and talked excitedly. I laughed a 
bit more than usual. And I was overly nice — telling people 
how nice their eyes were or that they had a big heart.
I taught someone how to belly dance, collected 21 phone 
numbers, had an intellectual conversation, dined with a 
stranger, made a speech, called the 21st person in my phone 
and braided the hair of a male stranger, among other equally 
crazy things listed on my sign. A few minutes after 2 a.m., 
after walking out of Balls cheerful but tired, I proudly an -
nounced to the world I completed the 21 things on my sign. 
If you ask me if I would have enjoyed my 21st as much 
if I had started drinking years earlier like many kids do, I 
couldn’t tell you. But my guess would be that I wouldn’t 
have. The excitement and anticipation of tasting my first 
drink, of trying different liquors, of being initiated into the 
drinking world, could not have been nearly as great if I had 
taken all those opportunities to get used to it. I had built up a 
curiosity, and waiting made me appreciate the discovery.

Ticket policy is unfair for sick students 
If you are a student and need to go to 
the neurology, oncology, or any of the 
other important ‘ology clinics at Shands 
Medical Plaza: beware. 
The parking “officers” are waiting to 
prey on your sick, wasting, contempt -
ible body. I’ve been ticketed the last three 
times I have gone for legitimate doctor’s 
appointments. There is nothing you can do 
to protect yourself.  
As a patient you are required to park in 
the attended lot. If you are a student and 
they find you, you will get a ticket. It’s that 
simple. The burden is on you to convince 
UF Transportation and Parking Services you were there legitimately. Don’t believe 
it? Allow me.
Unlike parking in front of the Student 
Health Care Center, you do not get a tag to 
put in your windshield to show you are a 
legitimate visitor.  
Instead, when I asked the “officer” 
who gave me one of my tickets what I did 
wrong he simply replied: “I ran your tag 
and it showed you were a student.” What 
a racket.
Here is the de facto policy as it stands 
now:
1. Assume any student parked in the 
garage is there illegitimately and ticket 
them.2. Place the burden on legitimate stu -
dent patients to prove through the appeals 
process they were sick.
3. Profit.

Florida should not follow Arizona’s law
I am disappointed to have read this 
week that Florida is backing the Arizona 
immigration law that basically allows ra -
cial profiling. 
It is not only offensive that hardwork -
ing legal immigrants there will henceforth need to have proof of citizenship with 
themselves at all times, but it is offensive 
to me as an American. 
This country is turning into the exact op -
posite of the principles it was founded on. 
The history lesson shouldn’t be necessary 
here for you to understand that point. 
Now this country is turning on those 
very beliefs. It may not be considered flat 
out racism, but as far as I see it, it is, since 
the only basis for question would be race. 
These states backing Arizona and the 
people supporting them as well need to 
learn to coexist with people.

“Congress shall make no law respecting an es -
tablishment of religion, or prohibiting any 
free exercise therefore.”
This establishment clause in the First Amendment 
of the United States Constitution has been the basis for 
hundreds of past and current arguments worldwide. The 
concepts behind separation of church and state have been 
touchy subjects, even before this great nation was colo -
nized.
Our parents, schools and nation teach us to idolize in -
dividuals like the Puritans who came to the New World 
looking for religious freedom but, in actuality, set up a 
society that was more dependent on religion than their 
former homeland. This was especially true in the New 
England colonies where the basic society was structured 
on an ultimatum. Visitors could either follow their form 
of ecclesiastical law or risk being socially ostracized or 
even executed.
Just recently Kenneth Howell, a professor at the Uni -
versity of Illinois, did not have his contract renewed after 
he allegedly gave a “hate speech” toward homosexuality to select students in his Introduction 
to Catholicism and Modern Catholic 
Thought class. The quotation marks 
encompassing “hate speech” give in -
sight to my opinion about the subject, that is not the point 
of making this reference.
Instances like this issue show that religious factions 
and the government are at war every day in America. Our 
Founding Fathers knew this was going to be an issue for 
centuries to come, and that is why they set up our Consti -
tution the way they did. Statements such as “our creator” 
and “Nature’s God” appear several times in our Declara -
tion of Independence, but they are left very ambiguous to 
leave interpretation to any god.
Critics of this historical data may argue that certain 
American traditions were established by our Founding 
Fathers, such as “In God We Trust” imprinted on our cur -
rency or “one nation under God” in our Pledge of Alle -
giance.
But these critics are mistaken.
“In God We Trust” was not added to our currencies until a religious rally happened with the close of the Civil 
War and President Lincoln’s death.
“One Nation Under God” was not added to the Pledge 
of Allegiance until the communist scare of the 1950s. This 
phrase distinguished Americans from our “godless” com -
munist rivals.
Every day, we hear complaints from the far right and 
their media that America is departing from the original 
intentions of our Founding Fathers. In reality, our Found -
ing Fathers lived during the Enlightenment Era in which 
religion and the church were scrutinized and not trusted. 
The motto of the Enlightenment Era was reason over re -
ligion. In our current time, many people are now fight -
ing for just the opposite: religion over reason or, at least, 
religion over the separation of church and state. I am a 
religious individual, and I do believe that the Bible offers 
powerful insight into truth. But, like our Founding Fa -
thers, I realize religion can blind a state from doing what 
is best for its people.

Guys seeking out a free drink may take advantage

Those looking to add some-
thing new to their garden should 
consider butterflies.
The Florida Museum of Nat-
ural History holds a butterfly-
friendly plant sale every Friday to Sunday as part of a series of 
plant sales. The sale’s proceeds 
will benefit the museum’s butter-fly rainforest.
“What we try to do is feature 
the plants that we know will work for the butterflies because we see what works out there in the exhibit,” said Michael Boul-ware, who specializes in living 
exhibits at the museum. 
The plant sale, located outside 
of the museum’s front entrance 
near the picnic area, features an assortment of plants, and the list of plants available changes with 
each weekend’s sale.
There are two types of plants 
sold in front of the museum: the 
plants that caterpillars eat and nectar plants that the butterflies feed off. 
Boulware, a former organic 
farmer, found that if organic food crops are produced correctly, they will then attract butterflies, 
which can be viewed as a posi-tive or a negative depending on the gardener. 
“I’ve got a butterfly garden 
growing at the house and it’s the 
coolest thing to watch them,” said Jerri Sullivan, a volunteer. 
While some of the plants are 
brought in from local nurseries, most of the plants were grown in the museum. 
One type of plant hasn’t been 
selling better than the rest be-cause people pick plants to suit their gardens, Sullivan said.
“I would say a lot of people 
are very native-plant conscious,” Boulware said. “If it attracts a butterfly that’s great too, but they 
want to buy some-
thing that’s going to 
look good.”
Plant prices are 
about half of  what customers would pay at a nursery, Sullivan 
said. Plants are priced depending on pot size. 
Four-inch pots sell for $3, one-
gallon pots cost $6 and three-gal-
lon pots cost up to $18.
The plant sales will be held 
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays and 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Sundays. 
The museum will feature 10 
plants each week, along with at least one additional unan-
nounced species, according to the 
museum’s website.

KISSIMMEE — The federal gov-
ernment will spend $89 million to preserve almost 26,000 acres of wild ranch land in a northern swath of 
the Florida Everglades in one of the biggest expenditures of its kind, of-
ficials said Monday.
Under the plan, the federal gov-
ernment will acquire the right to protect wetlands in the Fisheating Creek watershed located in Florida’s rural Highlands County, although the four ranching families who own the properties will keep title to the land. The outlay represents a quar-
ter of what the federal government 
will spend this year as part of its Wetlands Reserve Program. It also is one of the largest contiguous ease-ment purchases of the program.
The program was set up 20 years 
ago to encourage private landown-
ers to retire land so that wetlands can 
be restored or protected, and it typi-cally makes purchases of around 250 acres a year per state. However, that average is around 1,700 acres a year in Florida, said Kathleen Merrigan, deputy secretary at the U.S. Depart-ment of Agriculture.
“This is huge,” Merrigan said. “It 
is extremely significant in what we do. ... It’s a big piece of our national effort.”
The four ranching families and 
companies that own the properties have powerful political and eco-nomic ties.
They are Westby Corp., which 
is controlled by the Finn Caspersen 
family of Venice; the Doyle Carl-
ton family, which has produced a Florida governor and state senator; the Blue Head Ranch, which is con-trolled by the family of state senator J.D. Alexander, whose grandfather was Ben Hill Griffin Jr., one of Flor-ida’s most famous land barons; and the H.L. Clark family.
The landowners will still be able 
to graze cattle on the land, although they now will need certain permits from the government.
The Fisheating Creek watershed 
was a top priority for protection and 
restoration because it drains into 
Lake Okeechobee, which then con-tinues to flow into the southern part of the Everglades. The new acquisi-tion will form a conservation corri-dor stretching from central Florida down to Everglades National Park in South Florida and improve water quality in Lake Okeechobee and the 
Everglades, Merrigan said.
“You can’t repair the lower Ever-
glades without repairing the north-
ern Everglades,” said U.S. Rep. Adam Putnam, R-Fla.
There also are 19 different spe-
cies that will benefit from the acqui-sition, including the Florida panther and the bald eagle, Merrigan said.
The entire Everglades once cov-
ered more than 6,250 square miles, but that figure has shrunk by half. The land has been replaced with homes, farms and a 2,000-mile grid of drainage canals.
In South Florida, water managers 
have developed a plan supported by Gov. Charlie Crist to pay $536 mil-
lion for 73,000 acres of U.S. Sugar 
Corp. land in an effort to restore that part of the Everglades. TUESDAY, JULY 20, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 9

� MCCOLLUM AND SCOTT HAVE 
LAUNCHED ATTACK ADS.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
TAMPA — The dirt — specifically dirty 
diapers — is flying in Florida’s race for gov-
ernor.
In one television commercial, newcomer 
Rick Scott suggests his GOP primary oppo-
nent, the state attorney general and a former 
congressman, should be thrown out like a baby’s dirty diaper. “Bill McCollum’s record stinks,” a female narrator says over an image of a squirming infant’s swaddled bottom.
In response, McCollum criticizes Scott 
for the record settlement his former hospital company paid to settle Medicare fraud charg-es. McCollum claims his opponent was “rip-
ping off taxpayers.” He looks into the camera in his ad and addresses Scott as if he were in 
the room: “You put profit over principle, and that’s wrong.”
Floridians can’t watch television for very 
long this summer without seeing one candi-
date tear down the other. Wealthy tea party 
favorite Scott has spent more than $20 million of his own fortune so far on campaign adver-tising. McCollum and his allies, determined not to let the criticism go unanswered, are fir-ing back.
The use of attack ads in the Florida con-
test as well as races in Arizona, Nevada and a handful of other states raises questions can-
didates and campaigns have struggled to an-
swer for decades: Are negative commercials effective in defining an opponent or do they cost the sponsor of the ad as well by turning off voters?
As a rule, political operatives believe neg-
ative ads work. But they are aware of the pit-falls and often use humor or a soothing voi-ceover to take the edge off an ad’s tone.
“They’re making each other look really 
bad,” said Terry Bishop, a 58-year-old retired oil field worker and registered Republican 
who lives in Gulf Breeze. “They’re not defin-
ing themselves, they’re defining each other, and you don’t know what to believe.”
David D. Perlmutter, director of the jour-
nalism school at the University of Iowa and 
an expert on political commu-nication, sums it up: “Negative is the new normal.”
He compares the evolution 
of attack ads with movie audiences who have come to expect more exciting action sequenc-es and better special effects each time they walk into the theater.
“Last year’s level of negativity is almost 
not enough,” he said. “It’s almost like you have to raise it up a notch each time.”The effectiveness of the ads depends on the 
attack, Perlmutter said. A claim that is plau-sible and at least based in truth is more likely to get traction. And at a time when many vot-ers are angry at the government, outsiders 
are logically going hard after the records of 
incumbents and established politicians.
In Florida, Scott entered the race in April 
after McCollum had already been anointed by the state GOP establishment to succeed Gov. Charlie Crist. Scott’s immediate and fre-quent presence on TV commercials and anti-establishment message helped him surge ahead in the polls in the spring.
Absent from the Scott-McCollum com-
mercials is any talk of the likely Democratic nominee Alex Sink, who is locked in a close race with both Republicans in recent polls. That could be a good thing for Sink, Florida’s chief financial officer, whose campaign is just starting to get some traction.

  THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
 WASHINGTON — National Guard troops 
will head to the U.S.-Mexico border Aug. 1 
for a yearlong deployment to watch for illegal border crossers and smugglers and help in 
criminal investigations, federal ofﬁ  cials said 
Monday.
  The troops will be armed but can use their 
weapons only to protect themselves, Gen. Craig McKinley, chief of the National Guard Bureau, told a Pentagon news conference. The troops will undergo initial training and be fully deployed along the nearly 2,000-mile southern border by September.
  The announcement provides details on how 
the government will implement President Ba-rack Obama’s May decision to bolster border security and comes as drug-related violence has escalated in Mexico, where several people died over the weekend in a car bombing and in a separate massacre at a private party. It also comes as the U.S. debate over illegal immigra-tion has intensiﬁ  ed in an election year.
  “The border is more secure and more re-
sourced than it has ever been, but there is more to be done,” said Alan Bersin, commis-sioner of Customs and Border Protection, part of the Homeland Security Department.  The 1,200 troops will be distributed among 
four border states, with Arizona getting 524; Texas, 250; California, 224 and New Mexico, 
72. Another 130 would be assigned to a na-
tional liaison ofﬁ  ce.
  Bersin also said the Homeland Security 
Department will provide six more aircraft, including helicopters, to the border. He said at least 300 Customs and Border Protection agents and inspection ofﬁ  cers would be sent to the Tucson area, along with mobile surveil-lance vans and additional technology.
  “It will help,” Arizona Attorney General 
Terry Goddard, a Democrat, said Monday in Santa Fe, N.M., where he was attending the annual meeting of the Conference of Western Attorneys General. “Manpower clearly has been deﬁ  cient. Technology has been some-what deﬁ  cient, and they’re bolstering that.”
  Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, 
said the deployment isn’t enough “nor tied to 
a strategy to comprehensively defeat the in-
creasingly violent drug- and alien-smuggling cartels that operate in Arizona on a daily ba-sis.”
  U.S. Reps. Ann Kirkpatrick and Gabrielle 
Giffords, both D-Ariz., separately called the announced actions welcome but insufﬁ  cient.
  “This is the kind of action we want from the administration — not suing the state,” Kirkpatrick said, referring to the Department of Justice’s challenge to the new Arizona im-
migration enforcement law. “However, we 
should continue to move forward with a much larger commitment of National Guard troops right away and with an expansion of the Border Patrol to strengthen security for the long run.”
  Texas Gov. Rick Perry also criticized the 
troops as “grossly insufﬁ  cient” for the border in a letter to the administration last week.
  President George W. Bush deployed 6,000 
National Guard troops to the border in June 2006, also a midterm election year. The troops were part of his effort to persuade the Repub-lican-led Congress to pass his immigration reform proposals that included a pathway to 
citizenship for illegal immigrants. The troops’ deployment ended in July 2008.
  McKinley said even though the four bor-
der states are contributing 54,000 troops to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, they still have 
a sizable number available for other deploy-ments or disaster response. More can be de-ployed at state cost if governors wish, but the 1,200 are being paid for by the federal govern-ment, he said.
  “Right now I cannot see a case where we 
would be overextending the National Guard for this effort,” he said.
  Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
also is beeﬁ  ng up its presence in Arizona, said John Morton, the Homeland Security Depart-ment assistant secretary overseeing the agen-cy.
  Morton said ICE is opening a new ofﬁ  ce in 
Ajo, Ariz., to focus exclusively on cross-border crime and to deploy a specialized investiga-tive team in Douglas, near where an Arizona 
rancher was shot and killed while surveying 
his ranch on the border.
  Also, the agency will send ICE lawyers to 
U.S. attorneys ofﬁ  ces to help prosecute felons who illegally re-enter the country after depor-tation. It also will increase the number of ICE agents in Mexico to 40, making it the largest of ICE’s 63 ofﬁ  ces in 44 countries.

NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
MIAMI — LeBron James will play some point guard for 
the Miami Heat. So will Dwyane Wade, as he has through-
out his NBA career. Mike Miller will likely do some ballhan-dling as well.
Thing is, none of them are true point guards.
And that means this Heat summer of change still has 
some things left to address — particularly finding a starter 
at the point spot.
Mario Chalmers is under contract, Carlos Arroyo is ex-
pected to re-sign with the Heat and there’s some talk of a 
possible Miami reunion with 2006 title-team point guard Ja-
son Williams. Whomever it is, the next starter for the Heat 
will inherit the keys to what could be one of basketball’s most dynamic offenses with Wade, James and Chris Bosh.
“It’s going to be a lot of fun,” Chalmers said.
Maybe for him. Probably not for other clubs.
Take what happened in this past season’s playoffs as an 
example. Wade faced the Boston Celtics in the first round, 
James faced Boston in the second round. Both saw virtually 
the same defensive scheme from the Celtics, who kept run-
ning multiple people against them in waves.
It worked. The Celtics won both series.With Wade and James on the floor together — with an-
other ballhandler — the same approach likely wouldn’t be as successful in the 2011 postseason. And that’s already cre-ating some concern for Heat opponents.
“We tried to just make them see a lot of guys,” Celtics 
point guard Rajon Rondo said Sunday at a charity event Wade hosted. “It’s going to be difficult with both those guys on the court, because you can’t really load to one particular 
guy because the other one’s on the opposite wing. It’s going 
to be fun. I’m going to enjoy the matchup. I’m probably not 
going to be checking either of those guys.”
Throughout their seven seasons in the league, both 
Wade and James have regularly taken over the point-guard 
duty, especially down the stretch in close 
games.
Each will continue doing the same in 
Miami, though likely not as much as in the past. And even though the notion has been 
floated that Miami could line up this sea-
son without a true point guard — a hybrid 
lineup of Wade, James, Miller, Bosh and 
newly re-signed center Joel Anthony, per-
haps? — Wade himself doesn’t see it happening regularly.
He thinks, for now anyway, the job is Chalmers’ to lose.“Of course, you’ve got to go through training camp and 
you have to go through practices to see what happens,” 
Wade said. “But right now, as I look at it, I think that would 
be the plan. I would like to play (shooting guard), at least in the starting lineup. I think I’ve done OK there. But you never know.”Miller said Monday that he likes the idea of handling the 
ball at times, especially if that gets him on the floor with 
Wade and James more.
“I see no problem with that,” Miller said. “Obviously, 
Dwyane and LeBron are two of the best in pick-and-roll 
situations and in the open court. So it’s all about defense 
and rebounding at that point. ... It’s definitely an option, for 
sure.”
So far this summer, Miami has added or retained players 
along the perimeter (Wade, James, Miller and James Jones, 
who completed his expected re-signing on Monday), power 
forward (Bosh and Udonis Haslem), and center (Anthony, 
Zydrunas Ilgauskas, Jamaal Magloire and rookie Dexter 
Pittman).
No true moves at the point yet, though that will change.
Could Miami play without a point guard? Wade doesn’t 
want it happening, and Rondo doesn’t see it happening.
“That’s probably one of the hardest positions to play,” 
Rondo said. “It’s not an easy position. They’ll find some-
body. Chalmers is a great young point guard coming up.”
Chalmers said earlier this summer that he had designs on 
being Miami’s starting point guard again. He had the job in 
all 89 games, including playoffs, of his rookie season, then 
lost the role early in 2009-10 and played behind Arroyo and, 
at times, Rafer Alston.
“I think Mario is someone we’re going to depend on a 
lot,” Wade said.Heat plan to address roster options at point guard

UF FOOTBALL
By KYLE MAISTRI
Alligator Staff Writer

According to a story first re-
ported by ESPN.com’s Pat Forde, 
UF and the NCAA are investi-gating a potential rules violation 
committed in December, before 
the Gators’ 51-24 Sugar Bowl vic-tory over Cincinnati, involving former offensive lineman Maur-kice Pouncey.
Florida is in the process of 
investigating an allegation that a representative of an agent paid Pouncey $100,000 between UF’s 
loss to Alabama in the Southeast-
ern Conference Championship game and the Sugar Bowl. Flor-ida alerted the NCAA when they became aware of the potential in-cident, according to Forde.
UF athletic director Jeremy 
Foley released the following statement to ESPN.com on Mon-
day morning:
“We were made aware of 
some information in early June 
that we reported to law enforce-ment and we then shared with the NCAA and the SEC. At this time we have no information that has indicated that there are any compliance issues for the 
University of Florida.”Maurkice Pouncey was draft-
ed with the 18th overall pick in 
the 2010 NFL Draft by the Pitts-burgh Steelers after his junior season with the Gators.
If the allegations hold up, the 
NCAA could rule Pouncey retro-actively ineligible for the Sugar Bowl, and Florida could have to vacate the victory.
Mike Pouncey, Maurkice’s 
twin brother, elected to return to UF rather than turn pro after his junior season and is slated to 
represent the Gators at SEC Me-
dia Days, which takes place July 21-23 in Hoover, Ala., along with Ahmad Black and Justin Trat-tou.
A UF official said that there 
are no changes in the school’s Media Days’ plans, meaning that Mike Pouncey is still expected to 
make the trip.Maurkice Pouncey at the center of NCAA probe

tive sometime between the 2009 Southeastern Conference Championship Game and the Sugar Bowl.
The monster that is college sports is be-
ginning to rear its ugly head, which for a long time has been hiding behind a veil 
of amateurism.
This summer college football, just one of 
the many faces of the college sports monster, has been masquerading behind news of con-ference expansion and possible realignment. 
But that façade was smeared by sanctions 
resulting from improper benefits received by athletes and investigations of possible rules vi-olations regarding illegal contact with agents – all because the NCAA doesn’t pay its athletes.
It’s getting out of hand, really.
First, there were the sanctions handed 
down to Southern California by the NCAA 
regarding its findings that former Heisman winner Reggie Bush and his family accepted nearly $280,000 in improper benefits, as did former Trojans basketball standout O.J. Mayo.
Just last week, news surfaced that the 
NCAA is investigating UNC’s football pro-gram, coached by Butch Davis, for possible 
rules violations. In the wake of that report, 
South Carolina also announced it was being probed by the NCAA for potential rules viola-tions, with multiple outlets claiming the alle-gations revolve around Gamecocks tight end Weslye Saunders.
While the NCAA has not officially dis-
closed what each of those investigations is about, it is believed that both of them also deal 
with improper benefits and illegal contact 
with sports agents.
When ESPN’s Pat Forde reported Monday 
that UF was also under NCAA investigation for allegations surrounding former offensive lineman Maurkice Pouncey possibly receiving $100,000 in benefits from an agent, the issue seemed to come to a climax and the makeup continued to run down the monster’s face.
If found to be true, all of these allegations 
are serious and should be dealt with appro-priately. However, this wouldn’t even be an issue if college sports weren’t treated as ama-teur athletics.
It’s time the NCAA lifted the veil of ama-
teurism that has been draped over the face of college athletics and revealed it for what it tru-ly is: professional sports in a college setting. 
These athletes made it to where they are be-
cause they were gifted with a certain skill set, but more importantly, because they worked hard and dedicated themselves to that skill to be as good as they are.
It’s a travesty 
that what they do at universities brings 
in ample money to 
their institutions – especially the larger sports like football, which practically fund the athletic 
programs – yet these student-athletes don’t get paid for it.
Sure, you can argue that they get a full ride 
through college with their athletic scholar-ships, but hey, plenty of people earn scholar-ships that help them through college, myself included. 
Just like athletes on scholarship, I use my 
scholarship money to pay for fees, books and food. The same goes for plenty of other college students out there.
The difference though, is that while I work 
and get paid in order to supplement my funds, these athletes – for whom training, practice and games take up most of their time – aren’t getting that same extra cash for the work they are doing on the field.
To say that college athletes aren’t profes-
sionals is a sham, because they are training year-round and putting in the work to better themselves and their team, all while bringing 
in more money to the schools they represent. 
The fact that these players don’t get paid 
because of the way the system is formatted 
doesn’t excuse any possible violations regard-ing improper benefits, but the NCAA needs to stop kidding itself and pay its athletes.
Of course, the logistics of payments due 
to the athletes is a whole other issue, particu-larly with Title IX requiring women’s sports to 
be given the same funding as the men’s pro-
grams.
Figuring out how much payment to allot 
to each sport, and more specifically, to each athlete, could pose quite a problem for the schools, and for the NCAA. Coming up with a solution to that issue, though, is better than having the NCAA misrepresent college athlet-ics as amateurism.
It needs to face reality and accept college 
athletics for what it truly is, instead of present-ing it as something it’s not.
It’s time for the NCAA to remove that veil.
NCAA needs to rethink amateur status given to college athletics

UF athletic director� TCU’S DEFENSE GAVE UP 12.8 
POINTS PER GAME LAST SEASON.

Even though TCU made it to their first BCS 
bowl game in school history, they ended their 
2009-2010 campaign on a sour note.
After an undefeated regular season, TCU 
fell to Boise State 17-10 in the Fiesta Bowl.
But the Horned Frogs will have another 
opportunity to compete for a national title this year as they come in at No. 6 in the alligator-Sports’ college football preseason rankings.
Despite critics maintaining that TCU’s 
weak schedule is the main reason for its suc-cess, the Horned Frogs have won 11 games in four of the past five seasons.
If they want to make it five out of six, they 
will have to find a replacement for two-time All-American defensive end Jerry Hughes, who racked up a team-leading 11.5 sacks last year. The Indianapolis Colts selected him 31st overall in the NFL Draft.
However, the Horned Frogs should have 
plenty of candidates to fill the void as seven starters return from a defense that allowed 12.8 points per game last season.
TCU will look upon senior defensive end Wayne Daniels to anchor the defensive line. He piled up 50 tackles and finished second on 
the team with 5.5 sacks last year.
The front seven will be important, as many 
expect a drop off in TCU’s secondary from last 
season. Two first-team All-Mountain West Conference cornerbacks, Rafael Priest and Nick Sanders, graduated last season. 
The Horned Frogs’ offense should provide 
their defense with ample support, however.
TCU’s offense finished fifth in the nation in 
scoring and it will return nine starters, one of them being MWC Offensive Player of the Year quarterback Andy Dalton. He threw for 2,756 yards and 23 touchdowns last year. 
Dalton’s top four receivers, in terms of 
yardage, will be back. Seniors Jeremy Kerley (44 catches, 532 receiving yards), Jimmy Young (33, 517) and Bart Johnson (33, 410), and junior Antoine Hicks (23, 478) will provide Dalton 
with plenty of options in the passing game.
The offense will be without leading rusher 
Joseph Turner, who graduated. However, the 
backfield will be in good hands.
Sophomores Matthew Tucker and Ed Wes-
ley each ran for over 600 yards last season be-hind Turner.
Dalton will help with the ground game, 
too. He gained 512 yards with his legs last sea-
son, giving the offense an added dimension.
Tucker, Wesley and Dalton combined for 
1,826 rushing yards last year, and the depar-ture of Turner should open the door for even 
more production from the three.
Last season’s TCU team made history after earning the first BCS bowl berth in school his-tory, but this season it has even higher aspira-
tions – win a national championship.20, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 20, 2010

ESPN’s Pat Forde first reported Monday that the 
NCAA and UF are investigating possible rules viola-
tions regarding former Gators offensive lineman 
Maurkice Pouncey. The 18th overall pick by the Pitts-
burgh Steelers this year, is alleged to have accepted 
$100,000 in im-proper benefits from 
a representative of an agent. The news comes as other schools, such as North Carolina and 
South Carolina are 
under inspection for 
similar violations.

Former six-time NBA Finals MVP Michael Jordan 
made headlines last weekend when, after a celeb-
rity golf tournament in Nevada, he said he wouldn’t 
have done what LeBron James did by joining fellow 
superstars Dwyane Wade 
and Chris Bosh in Miami. 
“There’s no way, with 
hindsight, I would’ve ever 
called up Larry (Bird), called up Magic (John-son) and said, ‘Hey, look, 
let’s get together and 
play on one team.’ ... I 
was trying to beat those guys,” he said.
