For the second-annual Flor-
ida Loves Israel conference, UF 
Hillel has partnered with Ac-cent Speaker’s Bureau to bring Carl Bernstein to campus.
The Pulitzer Prize winner 
known for covering the Wa-tergate scandal in the ‘70s will speak at Hillel on Saturday.
The three-day conference 
is from Friday to Sunday, said Joshua Kahn, Jewish Agency Israel fellow to UF Hillel. Tick-ets for the conference are $25 for UF students. the Bernstein event is free and open to the public. Bernstein will talk about American politics and its effect on Israel and journalism. 
Accent is paying Bernstein 
$15,000 to come to Hillel, Ac-cent chairman Josh Holtzman 
said.  
Tickets can be picked up at 
Hillel from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. to-
day through Friday and then up until the event on Saturday. Bernstein will speak at 8:30 p.m. Doors open at 8 p.m. 
Holtzman said Bernstein 
was chosen to speak because of his present voice in Israel.
“Carl Bernstein is one of the 
great journalists of our time,” said the 22-year-old history and political science senior, “but he is less known to the general public for his work done in Is-rael.”Carl Bernstein to

Students will no longer stand in lines swirling around 
the Reitz Union Colonnade for tickets.
The University Box Ofﬁ  ce will close June 30.
Brian Brasington, assistant director for business ser-
vices at the Reitz Union, said the box ofﬁ  ce revenue has been on a decline for the past three to ﬁ  ve years from the ticketing industry moving online.
Brasington said the Reitz Union, which runs the Uni-versity Box Ofﬁ  ce, is making arrangements for individual venues to have box ofﬁ  ces. He said the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts might use its own box ofﬁ  ce. Tickets for its events are already available on Ticketmaster.
The Stephen C. O’Connell Center and Constans Theatre 
will have to come up with business plans to sell tickets.
Brasington doesn’t know if there will be an option for 
buying tickets online for on-campus events.
He said the box ofﬁ  ce currently employs one full-time 
staff member and about 12 student employees. He said opportunities for student employees will be available in other areas of the Reitz Union.
Megan Wicks, a 19-year-old theater and marketing 
sophomore, said ticket sales to student performances are likely to decrease.
“It upsets me only because now people won’t be able 
to come to a show and buy it there that night,” she said. “It will require people to think way ahead, so some might not come altogether.”

UF has been a tobacco-free campus for 
ﬁ  ve years.
In honor of the anniversary, the UF Tobac-
co-Free Task Force is sending out reminders of UF’s tobacco-free policy and promoting free cessation services to anyone who wants to quit.
The policy bans the use of cigarettes and 
other tobacco products everywhere on cam-pus, including parking lots and vehicles.Jane Emmeree, a co-chairwoman of UF 
Tobacco-Free Task Force, said the policy is important for creating a healthy environ-ment.
“Someone who is walking around on 
campus who chooses not to smoke cigarettes really doesn’t appreciate having secondhand smoke blown in their face,” she said.
On Tuesday, the UF Tobacco-Free Task 
Force set up tables in the Gator Corner Din-ing Center, at the Shands at UF Atrium and on the Plaza of the Americas.
The tables offered information for people who wanted to quit smoking and for those who might know someone who smokes. It also advertised free counseling for students, faculty, staff and Shands at UF’s patients and families.
This year’s slogan is “Gators don’t chew. 
They chomp!” Created by students, it is a way to remind people all types of tobacco are prohibited on campus.
Kathy Nichols, a co-chairwoman of UF To-
bacco-Free Task Force, said it is a joint effort to make sure this policy is imposed and UF remains a healthy place to work and learn.
“We are all responsible to support the pol-
icy by asking people to put out and dispose of any cigarettes or any type of tobacco that’s on campus,” she said.

Volunteers needed for Clean 
Water Campaign
The UF Clean Water Campaign will hold periodic storm-drain marking events in April and during the summer to help raise awareness of water quality on campus. Most runoff water that falls onto UF roads, parking lots and buildings eventually makes its way into Lake Alice and may be polluted by careless activities. Round, 4-inch vinyl discs, which read “No Dumping: Drains to Lake Alice” (or another UF water body), will be placed at the curbs of street-level storm drain inlets around campus to alert people to keep trash, pollutants and other debris out of the water. For information on how to be a Clean Water Campaign volunteer for this and other activities, please visit www.soils.ifas.ufl.edu/campuswaterquality/ or email the Clean Water Campaign program coordinator, Italo Lenta, at italo@ufl.edu.

Gainesville Police arrested a man 
early Monday after an officer found him 
with a mouth full of marijuana.
Finnex Dorian Comic Jackson, 21, of 
Cross City, Fla., was arrested on pos-session with intent to sell a controlled substance and tampering with physical evidence charges, according to a GPD report.
At about 2 a.m. Monday, an officer 
stopped a car in the 2900 block of South-west 13th Street for a tag light violation, according to the report. After he pulled the car over, the officer questioned Jack-son, who mumbled his answers, accord-ing to the report.Because the officer smelled marijuana 
on Jackson and saw remnants of the drug in the car, he asked Jackson to get out to be searched, according to the report.
During the search, 
Jackson spit out six small plastic bags of marijuana and a few unpackaged pieces of the drug onto the 
hood of the officer’s car, weighing about 7.2 grams in total.
Jackson was 
booked into the Alachua County Jail at about 2:30 a.m. Monday. He was released at about 10 p.m. after he met bond.

Peter Hirschfeld is the new UF 
Teacher-Scholar of the Year for 2012-
2013. Hirschfeld, a 55-year-old phys-ics professor, was chosen for his per-formance in teaching and  scholarly activities.
“I’m touched and astonished,” 
he said.The award, which started in 1960, 
is granted to one UF faculty member each year by the Award Committee.
Hirschfeld, a Princeton Univer-
sity alumnus, became part of the UF faculty in 1988.
“Peter Hirschfeld is a superb 
physicist,” wrote UF President Ber-nie Machen. “He’s a great research-er, a great teacher and a true asset to UF.”In conjunction with the award, 
Hirschfeld will receive $5,000. He said he wants to put the money to-ward his children’s college tuition.
Yan Wang, a 28-year-old phys-
ics fifth-year graduate student, said he took Physics of Solids II with Hirschfeld last Spring.
“His teaching is very clear,” he said. “The class is very welcome to the discussion.”
Wang said Hirschfeld deserved 
the award because of his dedication to his students and his research.
Hirschfeld received his doctor-
ate in 1985. His research focuses on superconductivity. This happens when two electrons, both of which have a negative charge, pair up in certain materials, allowing electric-ity to flow through. The pairing of two electrons is abnormal. Typical-ly, an electron will only pair with a proton, which has a positive charge, Hirschfeld said. His research focuses on why this phenomenon occurs.
“It’s like something moves with-
out any resistance,” Hirschfeld said. “How can that possibly happen?”
Hirschfeld said his graduate stu-
dents help with his research.
“I’m grateful for a lot of people 
that did a lot of work on my behalf,” he said.
Wang said he is happy to help 
Hirschfeld.
“He’s definitely one of the most 
significant scientists studying in the research area,” he said.

Look no further for outlets in Marston Sci-
ence Library.
The Student Senate unanimously ap-
proved funding Tuesday night for 15 re-
chargeable battery packs to be available for rent at the library by finals week.
The XP18000A rechargeable battery pack 
can charge up to three devices at once, in-cluding laptops. Each pack costs $179.99.
The Senate’s Allocations Committee Chair-
man Elliot Grasso said the battery packs are a short-term solution for students’ concerns about the shortage of outlets in Marston.
“This is a good, creative, out-of-the-box 
way to address these issues,” Grasso said af-ter the meeting. “Majors from all over will be able to use these.”
Grasso said the rechargeable batteries are 
a pilot program exclusively at Marston.
Each pack contains different charging tips 
for devices. The batteries have a warranty of three years. The renting system is similar to renting a netbook at the library.
If students respond positively to the re-
chargeable battery packs, Grasso said the li-brary can buy more.
Senate President Lauren Verno commend-
ed the Allocations Committee on finding a short-term solution for the lack of power outlets in Marston.
“It’s a great solution for something that 
didn’t seem feasible and is now a great op-portunity for students,” she said.

A Gainesville woman helped police catch 
the man who burglarized her house.
Rudolph V. Smith, 45, of Waldo, was ar-
rested on burglary charges after Sandy Flory, 
36, saw Smith biking down the road near her house, located in the 700 block of Southwest 21st Avenue, with a backpack that looked like her husband’s.
Flory was driving home when she spotted 
Smith with the book bag, she said. She rushed home to check on her house. She saw her bed-room had been ransacked, and the screen out-side her window was bent.
Flory called police while she drove out of 
her neighborhood. She saw Smith when she got to Southwest 13th Street and followed him onto Southwest 16th Street, then onto South-west Archer Road. Flory continued following Smith until police arrived. Officers arrested him near The Bartram Apartments, she said.
Police recovered the book bag, which 
contained two laptops, some coins from for-eign countries, a pocketknife, a watch that belonged to Flory’s husband and a remote-control red Mustang car Flory’s 5-year-old son had bought with his own money.
“I’m just thankful nobody got hurt and that 
I wasn’t here when he was here,” she said. “And we got our stuff back.”
Officers booked Smith into the Alachua County Jail just before 3 p.m. Tuesday, where he remained Tuesday night with no bond.
Smith has been in and out of jail on numer-
ous burglary and grand theft charges, accord-ing to the Florida Department of Corrections website.
GPD spokesman Officer Ben Tobias said 
Flory helped catch a criminal, and she handled the situation well.
“She was a perfect example,” Tobias said. 
“She hung back. She didn’t try to engage. She did everything exactly right.”

In the final debate before the 
April 16 mayoral runoff election, 
candidates Ed Braddy and Mayor Craig Lowe discussed a proposed downtown conference center, trans-portation and the biomass plant Tuesday night.
The forum was held at Oak 
Hammock at UF retirement com-munity. About 90 people attended.
Throughout the debate, candi-
dates landed on opposite sides of every major issue.
Both candidates supported 
bringing a conference center down-town but differed on the right way to build it. Braddy said he wouldn’t support a tax-funded center, while Lowe said he supports tax incen-tives to make the building a reality.
“I think it would be a good thing 
to use incentives in a judicious man-ner,” Lowe said.
Regarding the city’s biomass 
contract, Lowe said he supports the contract, adding that biomass will diversify Gainesville’s fuel mix for electric generation.
“It will provide … financial se-
curity in the long haul when com-pared with other fuel sources,” he said.
Braddy disagreed, saying a mo-
tion he made during his term as District 2 city commissioner would have saved residents money.
“Had the City Commission fol-
lowed through on the motion I made … we would be saving $260 million,” he said.
The candidates agreed the city’s 
transit needs aren’t being met, but they proposed different solutions to the problem.
Lowe said bus rapid transit is the 
answer, while Braddy said Lowe’s proposal would be too costly.
“We have better uses of $300 
million,” Braddy said.
The candidates also differed on 
how to fund road maintenance.
Lowe said the city’s looking for 
additional funds.
Braddy said 80 percent of the 
city’s gas tax revenue is being di-verted to uses other than road maintenance.
“I would support more propor-
tionate use of existing revenue to help maintain the roads,” he said.Both mayoral candidates debate conference center, biomass plant“I’m just thankful nobody got hurt 
and that I wasn’t here when he was

The Reitz Union Grand Ballroom 
teemed with laughter and applause 
Tuesday night as Alfonso Ribeiro spoke about his experiences in show business.
The former “The Fresh Prince of Bel-
Air” actor talked to about 475 people, said Inter-Residence Hall Association president Severin Walstad, a 21-year-old UF public relations senior. 
IRHA sponsored the event.Best known as the rich, intelligent and 
preppy Carlton Banks on the ‘90s sitcom, Ribeiro emphasized the important roles hard work and luck play in breaking into the business.
“You work hard. You work tirelessly,” 
he said. “Every day, you do something to help yourself.” 
The actor, director and television host once starred in a Pepsi commercial with the late Michael Jackson.
He later landed the 
title role in the Broadway show “The Tap Dance 
Kid,” which jump-started his career.
Ribeiro also spoke 
about his “Fresh Prince” role.
He expressed admiration for former co-
star Will Smith.
“I felt like [Smith] had something that 
was amazing,” Ribeiro said. “He had that charisma.”
Upon audience request, Ribeiro 
performed the famous Carlton Dance.
The crowd erupted in cheers.Ribeiro said as of now, there are no 
plans for a “Fresh Prince” reunion.
Carina Seagrave, a 22-year-old 
journalism graduate student, said her favorite part of the event was when Ribeiro talked about his cast experiences throughout the years.
“Growing up, I felt like I was part of the 
Banks family,” she said. “I really like that he keeps that tradition going.” Carlton actor says no relaxing all cool in show business

A southwest Gainesville steak house 
had to evacuate about 80 people Tuesday 
afternoon after a gasoline leak occurred at a neighboring construction site.
Texas Roadhouse, 3830 SW Archer 
Road, was closed from about 12:40 p.m. to 4 p.m. while a Gainesville Regional Utili-ties crew replaced the leaking pipe.
Contractors were installing pathway 
lighting when they struck a gas line while drilling for the new Pollo Tropical that will share a parking lot with the steak house.
Greg Jasinski, Texas Roadhouse man-
ager, said all of the kitchen equipment stopped working when the pipe burst. GRU and Gainesville Fire Rescue were called while restaurant customers and staff evacuated.
GFR Lt. Todd Ellis said even though a 
fire didn’t erupt, eight firefighters and a paramedic responded as a precaution.
Although the gas leak was contained to 
a 3-foot-deep hole, Ellis said if a fire were to occur, the hole would have functioned as a chimney, funneling out flames.
Shawn Smith, 42, a gas worker for GRU, 
said when the drill hit the gas line, dirt went into the pipe.
If the dirt had not been removed, it 
could have gotten into the kitchen appli-ances at the steak house, Smith said.
“That wouldn’t be good for steak, I 
imagine,” he said.

Today’s question: Have you ever smoked on campus?
100 TOTAL VOTES81% YES
19% NOTuesday’s question: Is UF a party 
school?Florida silences doctors’ speech on ﬁ  rearms
When a physician asks a patient if he or she owns 
ﬁ  rearms, is that doctor violating the patient’s Sec-ond Amendment rights?
In July 2010, when Ocala pediatrician Chris Okonkwo 
asked Amber Ullman if she had guns at home, she report-edly contacted her Florida legislator to tell him about this “assault” on her Second Amendment right to bear arms.
This incident, along with several related anecdotes of doc-
tor-patient disagreements, served as a catalyst for the Florida Firearms Owner’s Privacy Act, which passed the state legis-lature in April of 2011 and was signed into law by Gov. Rick Scott.
Drafted with the help of the National Riﬂ  e Association, 
the law states physicians “shall respect a patient’s right to privacy and should refrain from making a written inquiry or asking questions” about whether a patient owns a ﬁ  rearm.
Other attempts by the NRA to curtail doctor-patient 
speech about ﬁ  rearms occurred in other states including Alabama, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee and West Virginia, all of which failed to pass their respective state legislatures. Earlier this year, Kansas and Missouri con-sidered similar legislation.
But these states are likely waiting to move forward with 
their legislation until the courts decide whether Florida’s law is constitutional. In June 2012, a federal judge in Miami per-manently enjoined the law, preventing its enforcement on the grounds that it violated the First Amendment freedom of speech rights of doctors.
Now the law awaits a decision by the 11th U.S. Circuit 
Court of Appeals in Atlanta.
The supposed justiﬁ  cation for the law — that posing a 
question about whether someone owns a ﬁ  rearm violates his or her Second Amendment rights — falls short for various reasons.
First, it is absolutely absurd to justify restricting the ability 
of doctors to ask potentially lifesaving questions in order to protect the sensibilities of patients who might feel uncom-fortable with such questions.
Particularly when it comes to pediatric care, evidence 
abounds that improperly stored ﬁ  rearms in the home can im-pair the safety and can threaten the lives of children. A study by the Children’s Defense Fund found more than 116,000 chil-dren and teenagers were killed by guns between 1979 and 2009. 
An article in the conserva-
tive-leaning Wall Street Journal even pointed out accidental gun 
deaths among children have “grown worse since 1999.”
Second, there is simply no way a doctor asking questions 
about ﬁ  rearms can abridge someone’s right to bear arms. When patients leave the doctor’s ofﬁ  ce after being questioned and counseled about ﬁ  rearm ownership, their guns will still be there waiting for them when they get home.  
And even if patients feel as though they have been ha-
rassed by a doctor asking these types of questions — the Sec-ond Amendment — or any amendment for that matter, does not protect us from feeling uncomfortable or offended.
Furthermore, the Bill of Rights was written to protect us 
from interference by the government, not from private indi-viduals like doctors.
Finally, there are clear First Amendment interests at stake 
in this case because the government is telling doctors they cannot speak to patients about ﬁ  rearms.
The constitutional protection of free speech, at its core, is 
about the discussion of important public issues, the discov-ery of truth and the ability of people to ﬁ  nd self-fulﬁ  llment.
No one can deny the speech regulated under this law ﬁ  ts 
all of the above categories. 
When the stakes surrounding whether doctors can coun-
sel patients about ﬁ  rearms safety involve matters of life and death, there is no compelling reason why such speech should be curtailed.
The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals should strike 
down Florida’s law and set a precedent that doctor-patient speech of this manner must be protected.

Beloved by students 
and thieves 
Hold on, we’re going to do one of those journalism ledes that describes an item to you before making you guess what we’re actually talking about:
You can dip pretzels in it. You can slather it on cookies. It 
makes a great sandwich when paired with banana slices. Nu-tella. Thanks for humoring us. We’re not the only ones obsessed with the chocolate-hazelnut spread. College students and inter-national thieves are as well. Let us explain.
Last month, the Columbia University’s college newspaper 
reported an interesting fact about the spread.
“It seems like undergrads have a sweet tooth — and it’s cost-
ing Dining $5,000 per week in Nutella,” said an article in the Columbia Spectator. “Since Dining started offering the sweet spread in Ferris Booth Commons last month, administrators have observed a high demand for Nutella — up to 100 pounds per day. But that seemly sum could be due in part to students stealing the chocolate-hazelnut topping.”
“And before you could say chocolate-covered Nutella marsh-
mallow cookies,” joked an article in the New York Times last month, “the council member, Peter Bailinson, heard from Vicki Dunn, the executive director of Dining Services. The subject was how much Nutella students were taking back to their dorms, or wherever they were taking it, and how much all that Nutella was costing.”
“People take silverware, cups and plates, and that adds up 
over the course of a year to a lot of money,” Bailinson said, ac-cording to the article. “With Nutella, it added up much more quickly. Where Dining might have to spend $50,000 to replace silverware and cups, they were spending thousands of dollars on Nutella in one week.”
Is there regulation within Columbia dining halls?“The mundane fact, according to the University’s Division of 
Dining Services, is that the weekly cost of the Nutella supply is actually less than 10 percent of the amount originally reported on a student blog and quickly picked up by other media,” said Columbia ofﬁ  cials in a press release.
But what about the international thieves you promised us in 
this editorial?
“At some point over this past weekend, a group of unidenti-
ﬁ  ed thieves broke into a parked trailer in central Germany and made off with more than ﬁ  ve tons of Nutella,” said an article by Time magazine, sourcing an Associated Press report.
“It is not yet clear how the chocolate-and-hazelnut heist was 
carried out. The culprits would have had to ﬁ  nd a way to ab-scond with more than 6,500 jars of the stuff, according to some back-of-the-envelope calculations by The Atlantic Wire,” contin-ued the article. “The value of the pilfered condiment is believed to be about $20,000.”
Is there something nefarious you can do with or to Nutella? 
Because some group of thieves, maybe the same ones, also took energy drinks with them. “According to the English-language German news site The Local,” the Time article states, “a trailer-full of coffee and several tons of Red Bull went missing a few weeks ago in the same town.”
Fill us in on the Nutella secret, y’all.

A group of UF students is looking ahead to 
Fall, when they hope to pass the Student Green 
Energy Fund.
The money from the fund will go toward 
specific operations that will reduce UF’s carbon footprint. It will benefit UF’s goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2025, said Heather Dean.
James O’Connell, the director of internal 
and external affairs for Gators Going Green, said UF would raise the money by adding 50 cents to each credit hour.
“For a normal semester, it adds up to about 
two Starbucks drinks,” the 20-year-old envi-ronmental engineering junior said.
Dean, a 22-year-old political science senior 
with a sustainability studies minor, said the specific uses of the money would have to be approved by a committee of faculty, adminis-tration and students.Even though students become hesitant 
when adding tuition fees, Dean said, she has received positive feedback so far.
“They understand that this is something 
that is going to positively affect the campus for generations to come,” she said. “They want to invest in UF and make it a better place.”
The students missed the deadline to pass 
the fund this semester.
“We are kind of doing everything so that 
next Fall, everything can just be started right away and push through really quickly,” Dean said.
First, student petitions must be signed to get 
a referendum on the Student Government elec-tions ballot. Dean said about 500 students must sign the petitions.
“The first step is to have the students ap-
prove it so that the university knows that this isn’t something that’s being forced on stu-dents,” she said.
The petitions would gain UF’s approval, 
and then it would have to go to the Board of Trustees and the Florida Board of Governors.
O’Connell said other Florida universities 
have already passed a similar fund.
“This is an example of something that we 
can do that makes our campus better and makes our university stronger,” he said.UF group hopes to get green
◗ THE COUNTY IS EDUCATING 
RESIDENTS ON CONSERVATION.

Alachua County teamed up with lo-
cal governments across the state to de-
clare April Water Conservation Month.
The event includes education op-
portunities, reminders to use irrigation systems properly and an initiative to get county employees to conserve wa-ter and energy, said Stacie Greco, water conservation coordinator in the Alachua County Environmental Protection De-partment.
“We all use water, and we all need 
water,” she said. “I think everybody is part of the problem, so we’re all part of the solution.”
In Florida, April combines dry 
weather with grass greening and flowers blooming, Greco said.
“People get really tempted to ramp 
up their irrigation,” she said.Activities for Water Conservation 
Month began in March with radio ads reminding residents to maintain their ir-rigation systems.
The ad campaign, which is set to run 
through April 21, also promotes a rebate for properly maintained in-ground ir-rigation systems offered by Gainesville Regional Utilities, Greco said. The rebate covers $50 for maintenance and $25 for a rain sensor per system.
The county will also visit local schools, 
churches and homeowners associations.
“Basically, if anyone want to learn 
more about water, we’ll come talk to them,” Greco said.
Greco said UF students can help con-
serve water by taking shorter showers or turning off the faucet when brushing their teeth.
Nicholas Papaianni, a 23-year-old UF 
aerospace and mechanical engineering senior, said he feels water conservation is very important.
“Water is a finite resource,” he said. 
“It’s better to make do with less now than to go without later.”Conserve water this month

People are usually surprised when Mar-
cus Knox tells them what he wants to do 
when he graduates. The 20-year-old UF el-ementary education sophomore is studying to be a middle school teacher.
After graduation, Knox will join a hand-
ful of men pursuing a career in teaching young students.
According to a United States Bureau of Labor Statistics 2012 household data report, women make up about 81 percent of elemen-tary and middle school teachers nationwide.
In Alachua County, men make up 15 per-
cent of the elementary and middle school teaching population, said Jackie Johnson, spokeswoman for Alachua County Public Schools.
Karen McCann, president of the Alachua 
County Education Association, attributed the lack of male teachers in elementary and middle schools to low salaries.“We are seeing less and 
less people go into teach-ing because there is less of a financial incentive,” she said.
Dorene Ross, a profes-
sor in UF’s College of Ed-ucation, said there is more societal pressure for men to be the breadwinners.
“It’s very hard to support one’s self, let 
alone a family, on the salary that a teacher earns,” she said.
Johnson said because more women are 
graduating with degrees in education, they make up most of the applicant pool.
At UF, the disparity between the number 
of males and females studying to become teachers can be seen in enrollment numbers.
According to UF’s 2009-2012 final head-
count enrollment for the College of Educa-tion, 252 men were enrolled. 
The number of women enrolled in the 
college was 1,479.

◗ AVOID BRIGHT LIGHTS 
BEFORE BED.

When exam week rolls around, 
it can be hard to tell what’s normal 
when it comes to sleep.
“I usually sell coffee from the 
brewer, what seems like twice as much, during exam weeks,” said 22-year-old history senior Cody Tal-cott, a morning cashier at the Pugh Hall Chomp & Go.
What makes the difference be-
tween cramming and having a real sleep disorder? The answer lies in circadian rhythms, said Dr. Mary Wagner, a pediatric medical and sleep disorder specialist at Shands Medical Plaza. Circadian rhythms essentially regulate the timing of pe-riods of sleepiness and wakefulness throughout the day. Adolescence brings on a change in circadian rhythms that makes it hard to feel comfortable falling asleep before 11 p.m.
“[In healthy subjects] if you let 
them sleep when they want to, they’re fine … People that have insomnia have problems sleeping even during their preferred time,” Wagner said.
Symptoms of insomniac behav-
ior can be alleviated by exercising regularly, avoiding caffeine close to bedtime and relaxing before bed.
“Avoid irregular sleep onset and 
offset,” Wagner said.
Certain cues in the environment 
help to train the regulation of cir-cadian rhythm. She recommended avoiding bright lights like laptops or cellphones before bed to regulate sleep rhythm. Also, try to nap for only short periods during the day, Wagner said.
“For patients who are motivated, 
[the Shands at UF Sleep Disorders Center] has a very good recovery rate,” Wagner said. In many cases, only one overnight stay is necessary to diagnose and treat problems, ac-cording to a Shands at UF Sleep Dis-orders Center pamphlet.

  TALLAHASSEE — No one deserved to 
catch the ﬁ  nal out of Florida’s 4-3 victory 
against Florida State on Tuesday night more than Harrison Bader.
  Fueled by its speedy outﬁ  elder, Florida 
(16-18) upset No. 7 Florida State (27-6) in a comeback victory at Dick Howser Stadium in front of the ﬁ  fth-largest crowd in FSU history. Bader ﬁ  nished 2 for 4 at the plate, robbed a home run and scored three runs in a game the Gators needed to win in order to avoid a season sweep against the Semi-noles. 
  With the score knotted 3-3,  Bader led off 
the ninth inning by reaching second on a throwing error to ﬁ  rst by Florida State third baseman Jose Brizuela. Bader advanced to third after an errant pickoff attempt by clos-er Robby Coles. Josh Tobias, the next bat-ter, drove Bader in on a sacriﬁ  ce ﬂ  y to right ﬁ  eld. 
  Bader erased a one-run deﬁ  cit in the sev-
enth inning thanks to his awareness on the base paths. The freshman reached base on a single — his second hit of the game on an 0-2 count. He then stole second and advanced to third on catcher Stephen McGee’s throwing error.
  “Probably his best game he’s played this 
year to be honest with you,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said of Bader’s performance. “He’s had a tough go of it recently. I thought he stayed on the ball really good at the plate tonight. Made a nice play in left ﬁ  eld (and) ran the bases aggressively.”
  Florida embraced its small-ball identity 
against Florida State. Bader served as the poster child. The Gators put a runner on base in every frame from the third inning on, allowing them increased freedom to take chances. 
  Cody Dent ended the third inning when 
he was thrown out trying to steal third on a double steal. Richie Martin advanced from ﬁ  rst to third in the eighth inning on a Justin Shafer base hit to left ﬁ  eld. The Gators, who entered Tuesday three games under .500, do not have time to waste with one month re-maining.
  “I know it’s not textbook baseball and 
it’s not something you want to do, but we’re at a point now where we got to take some gambles,” O’Sullivan said.
  Left-hander Bobby Poyner matched a 
career-high with four innings in his ﬁ  rst start this season. Right-hander Ryan Har-ris and left-hander Daniel Gibson held the Seminoles scoreless during the ﬁ  nal three innings. With closer Johnny Magliozzi in the starting rotation, the two have embraced their late-inning jobs.
  The bullpen locked down Florida’s sec-
ond one-run win in nine tries.
  “Great atmosphere even though it’s hos-
tile coming in here,” Bader said. “It’s great to play here. It’s a lot of fun. Huge win for us.”

END OF GREGULATION
  College basketball has issues, but Monday’s national 
championship game showed everything that is right with the sport. 
  Louisville’s win against Michigan was one of those crazy 
games in which nearly every moment was packed with ten-sion. The outcome was in doubt until the ﬁ  nal 12 seconds. We saw Trey Burke prove why he’s player of the year, we saw freshman Spike Albrecht grow up before our eyes, and we saw Most Outstanding Player Luke Hancock hit big shot after big shot. With the exception of the standard ofﬁ  ciating blunders, the game was perfect. 
  And now it’s time for us to be moving on. Back to the 
slow, monotonous grind that so many have learned to hate.  
  Monday’s game won’t change the trajectory of college basketball, but it at least showed that the game can still be a lot of fun in its current incarnation. 
  Coming into the season, many 
fans felt like the sport was slowing down and becoming boring. The proof is in the numbers: Games averaged 67.7 possessions in 2004. That number has steadily dropped 
all the way down to 65.9 this season — the lowest it’s been in 11 years of KenPom data. 
  Fans hate to see the game break. They long for the days 
when it was fun and free-ﬂ  owing. Now, coaches want to mi-cromanage each possession, squeezing every last bit of ef-ﬁ  ciency out of every spot they can. 
  Bo Ryan’s Wisconsin teams have become emblematic of 
this style of play. Whine all you want, but it works. The Bad-gers have reached the NCAA Tournament in each of Ryan’s 11 seasons. 
  The slowing tempo is also a contributor to the increased 
parity in college basketball. A team facing a supreme talent disadvantage — which will inevitably exist in a league with 347 rosters — is best off keeping the possession count low. That increases the team’s chance of an upset in the same way a single elimination playoff will lead to more upsets than a series. Slower tempos give those pesky, small-school ankle biters an opening.

got to take some gambles.”
Kevin O’Sullivan
UF coachWhen Louisville and Michigan 
— the teams with the NCAA’s two 
best backcourts — take the same floor, those issues don’t exist. Both teams believe in their talent, and both want to play their up-and-down style. The result is a game as great as Monday’s. But most teams don’t have a Trey Burke, Russ Smith, Peyton Siva or Tim Hard-away Jr., so they have to do things differently. 
People want to view former 
Florida Gulf Coast coach Andy En-field as a counterpoint to this argu-ment — some kind of last hope for reviving the game. 
Ain’t it fun to watch point guard 
Brett Comer throw alley oops all over the court? Aren’t we all guilty of daydreaming about those thun-derous slams? People will remem-ber how well that up-tempo at-tack worked in upset wins against Georgetown and San Diego State, but Part II of the story is equally important. Florida grounded FGCU and forced 20 turnovers, in-cluding nine from Comer. The lobs didn’t connect. What was once la-beled “free-flowing” was labeled “reckless.” The Eagles lost by 12. 
Before long, Enfield will be 
alone. The slowing trend will probably continue far into the fu-ture. Whether it’s realistic or not, coaches will chase their dream of removing their players’ personali-ties, making them all cogs in an ef-ficient, well-oiled machine. 
For a time, I hated the change. 
But I’ve learned to appreciate it, and I’m not angry anymore. 
Think of it like NASCAR. 
Watching the drivers go extremely fast in their cars at the Daytona 500 is awesome, but the short-track races can be just as entertaining. The speed isn’t the same, but slow-ing things down gives viewers a greater opportunity to enjoy all the nuances, as long as they’re willing to look. 
Monday was a holiday — an 
occasion and a game worthy of celebration. But even when next season rolls around and the pace grinds to a halt, there’s plenty of reasons to still be into college bas-ketball. At the very least, fans can be on the lookout for those rare occasions when supreme talents clash to produce the type of game we saw on Monday.

Freshman Bridgette Caquatto was held to-
gether by tape all summer long.
Caquatto arrived at Florida following 
shoulder and knee surgeries, as well as two 
stress fractures in her shins. She did only re-hab and conditioning until Thanksgiving. 
Now at full health, Caquatto — along with 
her fellow freshmen — is playing an integral role in Florida’s postseason success. 
“Our freshman class has done a really 
great job up to this point,” coach Rhonda Faehn said. “Just very consistent and also very personable, loud and enthusiastic.”
With senior Randy Stageberg out with a 
dislocated shoulder she suffered during prac-tice on March 29, Florida’s depth has been tested. It had to replace an anchor on both balance beam and floor. 
During the NCAA Regional Champion-
ships, freshmen Bridget Sloan, Bianca Dan-cose-Giambattisto and Caquatto stepped up to fill the void. 
Caquatto, who had only performed exhi-
bition on two events since March 1, assumed the sixth spot in Florida’s floor rotation. She was fluid in her tumble passes en route to a career-best event score of 9.925 on the floor.  Dancose-Giambattisto, who has earned 
high praise from Faehn as a “tremendous bar swinger,” has been a consistent producer on uneven bars since making her debut in the rotation during Florida’s 197.65-196.025 win against Auburn on Jan. 25.
She ranks 30th in the NCAA on the event 
with a 9.875 average, and she executed on Saturday. Dancose-Giambattisto led off the rotation for the first time in 2013, recording a 9.85 and springboarding a lineup that pro-duced a 49.6 — Florida’s sixth-highest total in program history. 
“Bianca going first on bars — I mean, any-
one going first — having that in your mind that you’re first up could probably scare any-one,” Kytra Hunter said. “It might’ve scared me.”
Meanwhile, Bridget Sloan, the Southeast-
ern Conference Freshman of the Year, has reveled in high-pressure situations. Sloan’s performances have paid dividends for the Gators. 
Sloan ranks in the top two nationally in 
two of four events, including a first-place spot on uneven bars with a 9.955 regional qualify-ing average. Sloan, like UF’s other freshmen, has been a mainstay in Faehn’s lineups. Sloan has competed in every meet this season, in-cluding nine all-around performances. WEDNESDAY, APRIL 10, 2013 § ALLIGATOR, 17

� VAN OVERBEEK WENT 
46 DAYS WITHOUT A WIN.
CHRIS KIRSCHNER
Alligator Writer
Senior Bob van Overbeek is 
returning to form near the end 
of a rough 2013 season. 
After a 46-day stretch with-
out winning a singles match, van Overbeek experienced victory again with a 6-3, 7-5 win against Alabama’s Becker O’Shaughnessey on March 22. But his losing woes continued two days later in a 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 loss to Auburn’s Lukas Ol-lert.
Coach Bryan Shelton 
benched van Overbeek for the next two matches, and the move paid off.
Since returning to Florida’s 
singles lineup against Ole Miss on April 5, van Overbeek has not dropped a set in sin-gles play.
He looks to continue his 
run today when No. 17 UF (11-9, 5-5 Southeastern Con-ference) hosts Bethune-Cook-man (12-12) at 1:30 p.m. at Linder Stadium.
“All athletes go through 
[rough stretches] from time to time where you lose a little bit of confidence,” Shelton said of van Overbeek’s slump. “He has the weapons, he has the game, and he matches up well against anyone in the coun-try.”
The senior boasts a career 
singles record of 81-50 and began the fall season ranked No. 17 in the ITA Individual Rankings. A 7-10 record in UF’s spring matches dropped him to 117th on the ITA’s lat-est list, which was released on March 26.
To combat his losing streak, 
Shelton moved van Overbeek 
down to the No. 3 p o s i t i o n , and the change has 
worked in his favor.
When van Overbeek 
snapped his losing streak against the Crimson Tide, he did so from the No. 3 spot in the Gators’ lineup.
Shelton demoted the senior 
from Florida’s top spot so he could build confidence against weaker opponents.
“Obviously there is no sub-
stitute for winning,” Shelton said.
“He puts in the extra work 
every single day. He isn’t waiting around to see if he is going to get better. He is try-ing to make it happen through hard work.”
Despite a disappointing 
final season at UF, van Over-beek has time left for redemp-tion. The Gators have three more regular-season matches and the SEC Tournament on their schedule.
“Hard work all pays off in 
the end,” Shelton said. “Even-tually, if you continue putting in the work, you’ll reap the re-wards from the work that you put in.”Senior recovering

The Gators were down by a 
run and sending the bottom of 
the lineup to the plate in the top 
of the sixth during Florida’s road 
game against USF on Feb. 27.
Bulls pitcher Sara Nevins re -
tired the first two batters easily, 
picking up her eighth strikeout of 
the game and bringing the top of the lineup to the plate.
Freshman Kelsey Stewart kept 
the inning alive with a two-out 
double, and f r e s h m a n Kirsti Mer -
ritt singled 
her in to tie the game. Sophomore Lauren Haeger came up next and capped the offensive outburst with a game-winning, two-run homer.
No. 3 Florida’s (38-4, 12-3 
Southeastern Conference) 3-1 win against USF (32-11, 10-1 Big East) in February was the Gators’ sixth 
victory this season when scoring 
three runs or fewer.
In 2013, UF has used solid 
pitching to keep games close as it waits for the offense to show up. 
Florida is 18-4 in contests decided by three runs or fewer.
The Gators showcased their 
ability to win close games last weekend. Down 2-0 in the sixth inning against Mississippi State 
on Saturday, second baseman Jes-sica Damico hit a grand slam that 
won the game 4-2 for Florida.
“We do this all the time,” Hae -ger said.
“We never give up, and that’s 
what I love about us.”
When the pitching fails and 
Florida’s opponents take the lead, the offense has battled back. UF 
has trailed in 14 of its 38 victories. Florida has five walk-off wins, including a 7-3 victory against Florida State on March 27.
Against the Seminoles, the 
Gators trailed until the bottom of the seventh inning. Senior Kelsey Horton hit a bouncing ball that 
FSU third baseman Courtney Se -
nas threw away, scoring the tying 
runs with two outs. Briana Little won the game with a grand slam in the eighth.
Florida will need its pitchers 
to keep the game close tonight as the Gators take on the Bulls at 6 at Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium. 
South Florida will pitch Nevins, 
who has posted a 1.50 ERA in four starts against Florida during the past two seasons.
“When you face a pitcher like 
Sara Nevins, you’re not going to get a whole lot of hits,” coach Tim Walton said. “It’s going to be tough.”

Long before making the dif-
ficult decision to transfer from 
North Carolina to Florida, Antoi-nette Bannister grew up watching T.J., her half brother, flourish on the basketball court. 
Although she was barely old 
enough to dribble a ball when he began playing competitively, An-toinette would tag along and emu-late the moves T.J. made during practices and games.
“She was a little tot watching 
her big brother play and would be out there shooting all the time,” 
said Tony Bannister, their father. 
“She just loved basketball and en-joyed being around the game from a very young age.”
T.J. quickly became a heralded 
high school player. As a senior, he finished third in the voting for Florida’s Mr. Basketball award and became only the fourth player in Jacksonville to score 2,000 points during a high school career.
His goal was to play for Billy 
Donovan and the Gators. 
“That’s where he wanted to be, 
where he dreamed of being,” Tony said. 
But T.J.’s plans fell through. He 
ended up at Virginia, missing out on his dream.
Antoinette promised to not miss 
out on her own dream. 
            Antoinette quickly made a 
name for herself playing basket-ball for her father at Jacksonville Potter’s House Christian Academy — a school that competed in the National Christian School Athletic Association until her senior sea-son. 
Had the Florida High School 
Athletic Association recognized Potter’s House during Antoinette’s entire career, her numbers would compare favorably to any other girl not only in the state, but through-out the country. 
Antoinette averaged 31.3 points 
per game during her senior season 
to finish her high school career with 
4,758 points. Only Adrian McGow-en, who played in Goodrich, Texas, from 2003-06, ever officially scored more points in high school than Antoinette. 
But missing out on statistical 
recognition was an easy trade for what playing independently meant to Antoinette’s development.  
“It always felt just like an NBA 
schedule,” Antoinette said. “We traveled year round — went to California, Tennessee, just a whole bunch of places that most girls don’t get the chance to normally do in the FHSAA.” 
Her scoring ability drew the 
interest of coaches from elite pro-grams throughout the country. The powerhouses of women’s basket-ball — Connecticut and Tennessee — were intrigued by the girl who consistently took and made shots from anywhere on the floor. 
“We were able to play in front 
of college coaches all the time,” An-toinette said. “There wasn’t a tour-nament that we would go to that there wasn’t a college coach there watching.” 
Although letters from college 
coaches filled her mailbox daily, there was only one coach Antoi-nette dreamed of playing for: North Carolina’s Sylvia Hatchell. 
Hatchell became coach of the 
Tar Heels in 1986 and built the pro-gram into one of the nation’s best. UNC won the NCAA title in 1994 and has missed the NCAA Tourna-
ment just three times. 
“North Carolina was her dream 
school,” Tony said. “She could 
have gone to any school she want-ed to go to, but there wasn’t much indecision.”
Added Antoinette: “That’s 
where my heart was.” 
Hatchell recognized that Antoi-
nette had the talent to flourish in the Tar Heels system. She also saw potential in two other players on the Potter’s House team. 
“They would run and press and 
trap people, and that’s how I like to play,” Hatchell said. “Right away, I loved their style, her style and just how hard she always played.”
A pipeline formed. Three play-
ers from Potter’s House — Antoi-nette, Brittany Rountree and Hillary Fuller — signed to play basketball for Hatchell at North Carolina. Antoinette’s dream was a real-
ity. Even better, she had two team-mates to help ease the transition from Jacksonville to Chapel Hill, N.C.
“Our dream was always to play 
college ball together,” Antoinette said of her friendship with Roun-tree. “That’s what we spent our time talking about.”
But that dream quickly turned 
into a prayer. 
            
 Lurise Bannister, Antoinette’s 
mother, is the glue that holds the family together.  
But, in October 2012, she began 
to lose grip of her own health.
Five years prior, Lurise watched 
her own mother battle ovarian can-cer. Given her family history, she knew she needed to be aware of any symptoms. 
When Lurise began experienc-
ing the pain that she remembered hearing her mother talk about, she realized it was critical that she un-dergo tests immediately. 
Nobody expects to battle cancer. 
The possibility shook the Bannister family to its core. 
“For the first time, I just kept 
questioning stuff,” Tony said. “I asked the Lord to not let anything happen. It was so hard, and my faith is very high.” 
Tests came back negative, but 
the pain did not subside. In De-cember, doctors decided surgery was the best chance of preventing her condition from worsening. 
Antoinette, who was home for 
the holiday break, considered nev-er going back to North Carolina. 
“To be an 18-year-old kid, and 
you don’t know what the results are going to be, it was tough,” Tony said. “That week-and-a-half, almost two weeks that we had to wait after the surgery to find out about the mass was so hard on ev-eryone. Especially her.” 
On Christmas Day, Antoinette 
decided that she wanted to stay with her family. Lurise begged her to reconsider and eventually con-vinced her daughter to return to Chapel Hill for the spring semes-ter. 
But after just two more games, 
Antoinette could not shake the knot in her stomach and the pos-sibility that she may never see her mother again. She made the deci-sion to leave the North Carolina program. 
“It was the most unselfish act 
anyone could have ever done,” Lurise said. “Making that deci-sion to come home because of my health, I commend Antoinette for doing that.”
Hatchell, too, understood the 
gravity of the situation. Although programs usually do not grant play-ers a full release during the middle of a season, Hatchell encouraged Antoinette to do what was best for her family — even if that meant playing for another team.  
“I’ve been doing this for so long, 
it’s about the kids,” Hatchell said. “It’s not about me, it’s not about winning, it’s about what is best for that young person at that point and time in her life.” 
Said Tony: “If something would 
have happened and they encour-aged her to stay, [Hatchell] said she would never forgive herself. That says volumes to me and our fam-ily because we have been close to them throughout the process.”
After only eight games, Antoi-
nette’s career at North Carolina was finished.
            
With one dream now gone, An-
toinette looks toward another: mak-ing Florida women’s basketball one of the nation’s top programs. 
The Gators have made just two 
NCAA Tournaments in six sea-sons under coach Amanda Butler. They finished tied for eighth in the Southeastern Conference last sea-son. 
“I said to Antoinette, ‘How 
many kids get to experience their dream school and then get a chance to experience the school that was their brother’s dream school?” Tony said.
“Her and her brother talk about 
it all the time. I can’t wait for her to show Gator Nation what she can do.”
