Some student senators concerned with pos-
sible cuts to UF’s multicultural and volunteer-
ing programs are hoping students will agree to pay higher tuition fees to save the programs.
Sen. Naadira Renfroe said students may 
have a chance to vote on a referendum next fall asking if they want to increase the Activity and Service Fee, applied to tuition, in order to pick up the $508,000 tab for the programs. 
The programs in question are the Multicul-
tural and Diversity Affairs program, which in-cludes the Institute of Black Culture and Les-
bian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) 
Affairs, and the Center for Leadership and Service, which organizes volunteering and leadership events.
They would be cut from the Student Af-
fairs budget if it sustained a possible 10 per-cent cut in state funding next year, resulting in nine staff and four graduate assistants losing their jobs.The change in the A & S Fee would have 
to be approved by the Board of Trustees, UF’s highest governing body. In the meantime, Renfroe said she would like to see Student Government use its reserves to fund the pro-
grams for about a year.
Stan Beckerdite, business manager in the 
SG Finance office, said while it might be pos-
sible to use SG’s operational reserves to pre- Students try to save cultural, LGBT groups

THROWING EGGS INPORTERS COMMUNITY.
Two Gainesville Police De-
partment officers stood in front 
of residents of Porters Commu-nity Monday apologizing and taking criticism for throwing 
eggs in the neighborhood while 
drunk.
In November, GPD Officers 
Brett Robinson, Billy Long and Joshua Hinson drove through the the Porters neighborhood in southwest Gainesville near Depot Avenue with the intent to harass prostitutes and drug 
dealers, an internal investiga-
tion revealed. 
While some of the 40 attend-
ees accepted the officers’ apolo-gies, others stated that the of-ficers should never be forgiven for their carelessness.Ofc. Jeff McAdams, presi-
dent of the local Fraternal Order of Police, said Hinson and Long voluntarily chose to apolo-gize to the Porters Community members Monday and also at the Gainesville City Commis-
sion meeting last 
Thursday.
Robinson re-
jected the oppor-
tunity to apologize 
last Thursday, so he wasn’t in-vited to speak at the community meeting alongside Hinson and Long, McAdams said.
“This is an important first 
step in the healing process,” GPD spokesman Keith Kameg said.
Kameg added that he hopes 
Gainesville citizens don’t im-plicate the entire police depart-ment for the actions of a few officers.

The UF student accused of groping 
women on campus after telling them he 
was trying to remove a bug from their bod-ies may have groped as many as 36 wom-en. 
In five of the cases, it appears Robin 
Garg, 22, did not actually touch the wom-en, according to the University Police De-partment. 
Criminal charges are pending in the oth-er 31 cases, UPD Lt. Darren Baxley said.
If each charge is for one misdemeanor 
count of battery, the maximum penalty in each case would be one year of imprison-ment and a $1,000 fine. 
As of Monday afternoon, Garg was still 
in the Alachua County Jail, with bail set at $5,000. Officers delivered a trespass notice to him in jail on Thursday, banning him from the UF campus.Garg is not listed as a 
graduate teaching or re-search assistant, accord-ing to UF records.
UPD Lt. Robert Wag-
ner said because Garg 
is a citizen of India, the department notified Im-migration and Customs 
Enforcement of his situation.ICE officials could not be reached for 
comment Monday about whether Garg’s visa could be revoked.
Garg, a graduate student in computer 
and information science and engineering, 
was arrested Tuesday for groping a UF stu-
dent outside Library West. After his arrest, he confessed to groping 33 women, Baxley said.

When UF President Bernie Machen re-
leased his budget cut proposal Thursday, 
part of which would eliminate the Office of  Multicultural and Diversity Affairs and the Center for Leadership and Service, some 
student senators put together last-minute 
plans to stand up to administrators.
The week of action was supposed to kick 
off on Monday with a forum in Turlington Plaza, but was canceled because of the rain and will be held today and Wednesday. 
Gator Party Sen. Megan Vu, who is lead-
ing the campaign, said students in groups slated to be cut will hold a day of silence 
today to symbolize how the administration 
has ignored student voices.
Vu, who represents District A, said the 
silence will end during tonight’s Senate meeting, when senators vote on two resolu-tions addressing the cuts. A resolution is a piece of legislation that states the Senate’s opinion but takes no action.
The first resolution states the Senate’s 
disapproval of the administration’s decision to cut the two programs. It was authored by Progress Party Sen. Dave Schneider, who represents Rawlings Hall.
The second resolution, written by Or-
ange and Blue Party Sen. Ben Cavataro, who represents Hume Hall, declares the Senate’s support of the penny tax. The penny tax is a bill currently being debated in the state 
Legislature which would help relieve cuts by adding a one-cent sales tax for the next 
three years. 
Vu said she is optimistic that both reso-
lutions will pass, adding that the events will 
end Wednesday afternoon when students 
march to the front steps of Tigert Hall to de-liver  a copy of each resolution to Machen.
However, not all senators support their 
efforts. Orange and Blue Party Sen. Sam Miorelli, who represents District D, said he thinks the legislation and demonstrations lack a focus. Miorelli said the senators eas-ily pointed out programs they don’t want 
cut but offered no solutions.
“Does the reso-
lution say where to 
find the money?” 
Miorelli said. “No. 
It’s not reasonable or realistic.” 
Miorelli said Student Government con-
tinues to cry out over every program that 
budget cuts have affected but never takes a 
leadership role or offers a cohesive stance 
on the matter. 
“As far as I’m concerned, a person who 
stands around and points out problems but has no solutions is useless,” he said. “It’s just whining.”
Vu disagrees. She said she realizes UF is subject to 
budget cuts and the money needs to come 
from somewhere, adding this is why she 
supports the penny tax.  
“We want to work with the administra-
tion,” Vu said. “We are all educated stu-dents and are trying to offer solutions.”TUESDAY, APRIL 21, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 3

At the end of Skyler Kern’s summer 
vacation, his bike won’t be the only thing 
that’s tired.
Kern and two other UF students will be 
cycling cross-country this summer to raise 
money for Relay for Life and to challenge 
their bodies and spirits in the name of ad-venture.
Kern, Maxx Mann and Nick Soilleux 
will be biking the 2,600 miles from Jack-sonville Beach, Fla., to Huntington Beach, Calif., from May 2 to June 8. The 39-day trip will test the students’ endurance, will-power and strength of friendship as they 
cycle about 60 miles each day between cit-
ies. 
Kern, a UF sophomore, chose to take 
the trip after realizing he was missing something in his life — adventure. Mann, a UF prehealth junior, and Soilleux, a UF finance senior, decided to tag along for the fun but also to commemorate loved ones who have battled cancer. There were other 
reasons for the trip, however.
“I’ve never seen the Pacific Ocean,” 
Kern said. 
The cyclists are raising money for Relay 
for Life, which benefits the American Can-
cer Society. So far, they have raised more than $1,000 through sponsors, but Kern hopes to raise more. The group will be do-nating the remainder of the donations af-
ter trip expenses, as well as fund-matching 
half of the grand total of donations to give to Relay for Life.
The trip’s sponsors include The Beer 
Pit, Relish, I Love New York Pizza and Chain Reaction Bicycles, as well as fam-ily and friends. Theatre Strike Force, a UF improvisation troupe of which Kern and Mann are members, will also be sponsor-ing the trip.
Three friends, all UF students and 
members of Theatre Strike Force, will be 
tracking the cyclists along the way, pulling 
a camper and providing moral support. The group will be camping and crashing on couches, via www.couchsurfing.com, in cities selected according to their dis-tance from one another. 
One of the passengers, Corey Draper, 
a UF telecommunication senior, will be filming the trip as a documentary to bring more awareness to Relay for Life and the trip itself. 
The group plans to blog and “tweet” 
during the trip to raise awareness, chron-icle their adventures and inform friends 
and family of their progress. They have 
already created a Web site, www.tourd-estates.com, and their Twitter profile name is TourDeStates.

more, said, “My favorite thing about this trip is that we’re giving other people the chance to have adventures like we’re hav-ing.”Cyclists to ride across U.S.StudENt LIfE

While labor unions have been 
hurting over the last 30 years, the 
Major League Baseball Players As-sociation has been thriving, said 
Donald Fehr, executive director of 
the baseball union.
Fehr spoke to about 30 people 
Monday night at the Bob Graham Center for Public Service, calling the union the “most visible, most mili-tant and successful labor organiza-tion around.”
He spoke for free, said Mike Bo-
wen, Graham Center assistant direc-tor.
Fehr said the reasons for the base-
ball union’s success have a lot to do with how different baseball is from other industries.
For one, the game can’t be moved 
overseas to save on costs, he said.
“You can’t reproduce tomor-
row’s baseball game on a field in China,” he said.
And the employees, which many 
industries see as the cost of doing business, are also the sport’s prod-uct, he said. 
Fans are not just watching a 
game, they’re watching specific players, he said, adding the sport’s 
players also can’t be replaced.
“They’re the best ones in the world,” he said. “You can’t find any 
other ones.”
As a result, he said, the union is 
not afraid to strike.
Furthermore, when the players 
do strike, it doesn’t seem to do any long-term damage to the sport, he said.
“Fans come back after (an) inter-
ruption,” Fehr said.
Since he became executive direc-
tor of the player’s association in the late 1970s, Fehr said annual revenue has increased from about $350 mil-lion to about $6.5 billion last year.
Player salaries have increased 
at a similar pace, he said, jumping 
from an average of about $50,000 in the 1970s to $3.2 million last year.
In that gap, he said, major league 
baseball has been shut down by 
strikes many times.
And reporters tend to cover the 
strikes like they’re sporting events, he said.
“You come out of meetings, and 
they’d want to know who won to-day,” he said.
Fehr recommended some chang-
es to the bargaining process between employers and unions.
He said both sides need to find a 
sense of common purpose in order for negotiations to be less adversar-ial.  Employees should have a role in a company’s decision-making processes so they are knowledge-able of a company’s state of affairs, he added. 
He also said companies need 
to find a way other than through 
wages to recognize an employee’s 
contribution to a business.
In the question-and-answer ses-
sion afterward, Fehr touched on the issue of steroids. He said the press made the steroid controversy an is-sue of drugs or of players having an unfair advantage when, from the union’s perspective, it boiled 
down to the question: “Under what 
circumstances is it appropriate for your employer to search you?”
“That’s what taking your blood 
or urine is,” he said, “it’s a search.”By KATHRYN STOLARZ

By plucking the metal keys of a foot-long piano, guest lec-
turer Aaron Spalding brought more than a thousand years of African tradition to life.  
Spalding, 33, a Gainesville resident, makes, teaches and 
plays the instrument, which he said is rare in the Southern and 
Eastern United States. He has lectured on the West African 
“thumb piano” for four years. 
The instrument looks like a wooden cutting board with two 
rows of metal butter knives.  Spalding held the piano like a video-game controller, with two hands wrapped around the bottom corners of the wooden board that formed its base.  
When played, it sounds like a jack-in-the-box or a wind 
chime moving at triple speed. The instrument also makes a lower sound, similar to a shopping cart rolling along asphalt.
“It’s a great instrument for someone who is expressive,” he 
said.
The instrument, formally called a Mbira, originated with 
the Zezuru tribes of the Shona people of Zimbabwe. It has been 
played for more than 1,000 years at religious ritu-als, royal courts and social occasions. 
The Zimbabweans traditionally used the in-
strument as “a telephone for the spirits,” a way to summon their deceased ancestors and tribal 
guardians.
Spalding, who grew up in northern Indiana, said the Mbira 
is somewhat popular in the Northwestern United States.  
Eleven years ago, Spalding was walking across a bridge in 
Indiana when he saw his first Mbira in the hands of a stranger, Treothe Bullock.  Spalding began studying with Bullock and learned the instrument in a matter of weeks.
Since then, Spalding has played in two bands.  In 2001, Spalding played at a religious ceremony held by a 
Shona community in Canada. Although he has not performed in a year, he continues to practice, lecture and give private les-sons.
“It’s almost like a meditation to sit and play it,” he said. “I 
really enjoy it.”
Spalding said he lectures and teaches the instrument free of 
charge in order to pass on the gift.
“I feel like this is something that was given to me,” he said. 
“I shouldn’t charge for something that was given to me for free.”Spalding introduced the instrument to Gainesville, and 
Orlando is the only other part of Florida where he knows of someone who plays it. 
A few Gainesville residents are taking lessons with Spald-
ing. They meet individually for about an hour every two weeks at his house. Some of them were recruited through his lectures at UF.
The instrument is not easy to learn, he said. Some students 
give up before completing their first song, and some take months to learn the basics.Spalding can play more than 50 traditional songs and be-
tween 10 and 15 modern compositions. He learns new songs and variations whenever he can. There is a traditional reper-toire of hundreds of songs to learn, he said.
From 2001 to 2007, Spalding, who has a background in car-
pentry, sold custom-made Mbiras. He said he stopped making them because authentic African Mbiras are now easily avail-
able online and have become cheaper for Spalding to buy than 
to produce.4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, APRIL 21, 2009

At about 15 inches tall, Shoot ’Em Up, the 
beer-pong playing robot created by UF electri-
cal engineering senior Jamie Unger-Fink, can aim and launch a ping-pong ball at a targeted red Solo cup eight times in a row.
“I don’t know if it’ll help society, but may-
be it’ll help people have more fun,” Unger-Fink said.
Shoot ‘Em Up was just one of 22 robots at 
Monday’s demonstration, which showcased the projects of students enrolled in this semes-ter’s  Intelligent Machines Design Laboratory, said UF engineering professor Eric Schwartz, who helped teach the course.  The robots per-
formed in and around the New Engineering 
Building while each maker watched and ex-plained his or her creation’s specific purpose. 
The robots had to be autonomous; using 
only their own abilities to fulfill the designer’s intent. 
About 150 people showed up through-
out the two-and-a-half hour event to crowd around various demonstrations, said Professor Antonio Arroyo, who also taught the class.
Building the robot was a semester-long as-
signment that constituted the only grade for the course, Arroyo said.  
“It’s essentially kind of all or nothing,” he 
said.
UF mechanical engineering sophomore 
Matthew Rosen rocked back and forth ner-vously before presenting his robot.
After an in-class demonstration on Thurs-
day involving dying batteries and other diffi-culties, Rosen said he was relieved when the final demo went according to plan.
His robot, Texas Draw, shuffles playing 
cards, deals them and handles chips for poker 
games.  Rosen spent between  $300 to $500 to 
build his robot, which is made of wood, me-chanical card shufflers and a scale to weigh the chips, but said it was worth the cost. “This is probably the most I’ve learned 
from any class,” he said. “It’s the difference between theory and actually making some-thing.”
Schwartz called the technical elective class, 
which is open to all students, “real, practical engineering with a limited budget.”
Still, many students shelled out hundreds 
of dollars on their projects. 
About $500 went toward Driving Miss 
Daisy, the chair-like robot created by Moishe Groger, which is intended to transport those with a  physical disability.
Other robots were also built for serving 
others, such as one that collects coins from the bottom of fountains and another that detects fires. One even patrolled a model-sized park-
ing lot and crushed the miniature cars that 
were not orange and blue. Another showed his UF spirit by referencing a renowned foot-ball player. 
UF electrical engineering senior John 
Kurien created a robot called Tim TeBOT, which plays paper football against a human opponent.  Waiting near the end zone of a small, wooden replica of Ben Hill Griffin Sta-
dium, Tim TeBOT was turned on and ready 
to play.  
After locating the paper football with a 
camera, TeBOT used its sensors to gauge the distance of the opposite end zone and deter-mine how hard to “kick” the ball with its spin-ning middle wheel.
“I’m going to miss football here, so I tried 
to do something close to it,” said Kurien, who 
graduates in May. 
After working about 10 hours a week on 
his robot throughout the entire semester, he 
said he feels ready to enter the work force.Legion assures flag will continue to wave over Hipp
oN c AMpus� GROUP TO REPLACE FLAG 
ABOUT EVERY SIX MONTHS.

The flag flying over the Hippo-
drome State Theatre will continue to 
wave in the future thanks to a spon-sorship by Gainesville’s American 
Legion Auxiliary Unit 16.
The group will provide a new 
flag about every six months with no 
end in sight, according to Unit 16 president Carolyn Badamo.
Flags cost about $40 each, Bada-
mo said, and will hang in the current lighted spot at the top of the theater, which is listed in the National Regis-
try of Historic Places.The flag represents patriotism 
and respect for veterans, she said.
“We believe in red, white and 
blue,” she said. 
“By flying your flag, it means you believe in 
the veterans in America.”
Badamo said she hopes when 
people see the flag raised above the 
theater they will think about the vet-erans.
“If it wasn’t for them,” she said, 
“we wouldn’t have the freedom we 
have today.”
Unit 16, a nonprofit veterans or-
ganization, also sponsors other flags around the community, including the one on the Ronald McDonald House of Gainesville.
“We give back to the communi-
ty,” Badamo said. “That’s what we do.”
Jessica Thompson, Hippodrome 
spokeswoman, said the flag im-proves the theater’s appearance.
“My favorite photos of the Hip-
podrome are the ones where the flag is blowing in the wind,” she said.
A ceremony will be held Wednes-
day at 10 a.m. at the Hippodrome, 25 S.E. Second Place, to dedicate the 
new flag.

Tebow’s Legend
Gators quarterback will 
leave unrivaled legacy
Rap game and politics go hand in handColumn
Today’s question: Do you agree 
with Obama’s foreign policy?56% YES44% NO
147 TOTAL VOTESMonday’s question: Should the federal government place restric -
tions on assault rifles?For the typical all-world quarterback, the spoils of gridiron 
war often include a proverbial “get out of jail free” card — turning college towns across the country into their own 
personal camps run-amok.
From hundred-dollar handshakes to recruiting tactics in-
cluding lewd after-hours parties with doe-eyed coeds, the world of collegiate football remains riddled with ruffianism and indecency.
And then there is Tim Tebow.Lauded for his exploits both on and off the field, the Gators 
quarterback continues to transcend the stereotype of big man on campus while rewriting the definition of student-athlete. The story of Tim Tebow, with perhaps the word “epic” being more apropos, speaks of a unique soul who utilizes his football star-
dom to further the lives of those less fortunate. From the man 
who trades in his Spring Break to provide medical assistance in the Philippines comes word of his latest endeavor, which serves as yet another reminder of Tebow’s sheer selflessness.
An article in the St. Petersburg Times spoke of Tebow’s 
philanthropic efforts in which he challenged the status quo set forth by the NCAA to usher in a new era where he could use his celebrity to bring financial aid to those in need. Working with the NCAA to ensure he did not violate terms of his eli-
gibility, Tebow helped organize a series of fundraising events 
over the course of the week preceding the annual Orange and Blue game. Ranging from a trip to an amusement park with a group of underprivileged children to an ice cream social at Shands Children’s Hospital, Tebow gave up countless hours of his free time for the greater good simply out of the goodness of his heart.
Thanks to his tireless efforts and a commitment to serving 
others, Tebow managed to secure donations of $300,000 in a 
matter of seven days — funds set to provide relief both locally 
and abroad. With $200,000 allocated for Uncle Dick’s Home, an orphanage frequented by both Tebow and his father Bob in the Philippines, and $100,000 for Shands Children’s Hospital, Tebow’s actions conjure imagery of a seasoned philanthropist, hardly a 21-year-old quarterback. What makes Tebow’s off-the-field achievements even more outstanding is the fact he can stake a legitimate claim as college football’s best player.
Truth be told, excellence on the football field, on some level, 
happens each and every college season. 
Recall the 2008 campaign a decade from now, and we highly 
doubt legions of fans sans those hailing from Lubbock, Texas, will fondly remember Graham Harrell’s 45-touchdown season for Texas Tech. With Tebow, some degree of success can be gauged by his numbers, but his greatest value must be mea-sured by his intangibles — a mastery of the notion of leadership that falls second to none. A dual-threat in the truest sense of the word, Tebow separates himself from the laundry list of col-
legiate greats ranging from Archie Griffin to Lawrence Taylor 
thanks to his willingness to make the world a better place. 
From his role as a complementary player while a freshman 
to leading man during last season’s championship run, Tebow’s legacy will forever be highlighted by his humanitarian works — even if he secures a second Heisman Trophy in the fall. 
With Tebow set to return to UF for what should prove to be 
a memorable senior season, the Editorial Board asks The Gator Nation to capture each and every moment along the way. While nay-sayers will casually dismiss the achievements of Tebow as a product of the Florida media hype machine, reality reveals a man who is nothing short of a once-in-a-lifetime person, let 
alone football player. 
Through his insatiable hunger for success combined with 
an unrelenting refusal for failure, Tebow the quarterback and 
Tebow the humanitarian become one.
Conservative voices in government and in the me-
dia seem to be convinced that President Barack Obama’s foreign policy stance is decidedly pan-
sy. Bowing to the Saudis, shaking hands with Chavez and agreeing with European leaders has cemented Re-publican opinion that Barack is a sissy on the world stage.
Emerging from eight years of W. Bush and his com-
bative style, witnessing the way Obama works is like night and day.
Call it “Weezy F. Diplomacy” after eight years of 
Death Row statecraft.
Former President George W. Bush handled every-
thing about foreign policy like a Makaveli-era Tupac. There was no battle too small, no slight that could go unpunished. So the French want to talk smack about 
the latest Iraq War? Fine, Pepe Le Pew, it ain’t nuttin 
but a gangsta party — one serving generous helpings of 
Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast in the congressional cafeteria. 
Tupac and George W. are very fond of making pro-
nouncements about the relative righteousness of their actions given the subjective nature of their individual realities. While Sept. 11 changed the course of W’s life, Tupac was never the same after he was shot up and went to prison. Both men often invoked the name of Je-sus in their public appearances — “Only God Can Judge Me,” indeed.
George W. Bush ran with a strong, close-knit group 
that helped him make all decisions and closed ranks when outsiders assailed them. It is easy to see Dick Cheney in the role of Suge Knight, rarely speaking to reporters but wielding an iron fist in most internal mat-ters. Moreover, the song “Picture Me Rollin’” takes on a completely new meaning when you imagine Cheney and his wheelchair.
Now, we have Barack Obama 
in charge, a man who has not yet found a foreign politician he won’t schmooze or glad-handle. Obama is the big dog in global politics right now, and he is wildly popu-lar in the eyes of the media. His po-
litical dominance mirrors the level of authority Weezy 
currently holds over the rest of the rap game. 
Obama and Lil Wayne both have a serious addiction: 
Wayne is never seen without a cup of codeine-laced 
lean in his grip, and Obama could not function on the big stage without a teleprompter full of words written 
by his 27-year-old speechwriter Jon Favreau. Both men 
will have to work hard in the future to deal with their 
dependencies.
While it may seem to the uninitiated observer that 
Weezy will collaborate on a song with absolutely any-one, in reality he has a select group of artists he raps with repeatedly. Like Obama, Wayne works mostly with people of a similar ideology. Boundaries like the line between rap and R&B — and the borders of our na-tion-states — do not stop these men. Obama and Weezy also both spend money profusely.
The rap game and the geopolitics may seem com-
pletely unrelated to most rational people, but this com-parison would have seemed much more plausible if Bill Clinton had never left 2 Live Crew to run for governor of Arkansas.

England. It is a country I’ve al-
ways had a soft spot for — I consider myself something 
of an Anglophile, and when I was younger, I always wanted to move 
there. 
For most of us, it probably still 
conjures images of Arthurian leg-
end; one pictures a verdant land ﬁ  lled with lords and ladies, royalty and privilege, pomp and circum-stance. 
 It just seems like such a cool place, 
doesn’t it? Just foreign enough to be 
thrilling but without that damnable 
hassle of having to learn a language.
Well, something else about Eng-
land struck me as of late, and as the second installment in my ongoing series about wacky world states-men, I would like to discuss a man who can only be described as a throwback.
Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh 
and the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, has been working tirelessly for many years to bring us all back to a less politically correct age. 
Some of his gemlike utterances 
are so shocking and so controversial that one immediately wishes to tap Howard Stern on the shoulder and say “See? That’s how it’s done!” 
In 1999, Philip found himself in 
Cardiff, attending some sort of gath-ering for a group of deaf young peo-ple. There was a local school’s steel band nearby, and the cacophonous racket that the band made obviously ir-ritated Philip. Drawing on 
the sort of 
regal tact that would please the ghost of Queen Vic-
toria, he addressed the group of deaf children, telling them, “Deaf? If you’re near there, no wonder you are deaf.”
Shocking? Just a touch. But, then 
again, I always did hear the English royalty was known for tact…
Prince Philip’s skills with children 
do not end there, though. In 2001, his highness visited Salford University, possibly to give a talk on how much the book “How to Win Friends and Inﬂ  uence People” has helped him in his social life. While there, he met a 
13-year-old schoolboy by the name 
of Andrew Adams. 
Young Adams had, for many 
years, had his heart set on being an astronaut. Imagine it — a young man, ﬁ  rmly sure of his dreams and nothing but excited at the opportu-nity to meet an honest-to-goodness prince. He told Philip, who then 
proceeded to tell the boy that — 
pshaw — he was clearly too fat to be an astronaut. 
Probably stung, huh? But, then 
again, I always did hear the English royalty was known for sensitivity…
A ﬁ  nal example: Philip was in 
Scotland in 2002, where he met a driving instructor. “How,” inquired the ever-curious Philip, “do you 
manage to keep the natives sober 
long enough to get them through the test?” 
I can only imagine the stunned 
look he received in return. But, then again, I always did hear the English Royalty loathed cultural stereo-types…
Philip is 87 years old and still, 
it seems, sharp as a tack. I can only imagine what he’ll come up with next year…

Letter to the Editor
Obama’s tax practices deserve critique
 I found the title of Friday’s opinion column 
titled “Bitter Teabaggers Ignored President’s Package, Tax Cuts” to be very ironic. Jake Mill-er does make an extremely valid point about the frightening number of people ignoring the 
real implications of the president’s package 
and tax cuts. Sadly, Miller is among that group of people 
who are so Obama-crazed they fail to see the negatives down the road. Last year, the bot-tom 50 percent of tax payers only accounted for 2.99 percent of total income tax — not to mention the heavy implications of the stimu-lus package on the national debt and future taxes.Megan McArdle, an economics writer for 
The Atlantic, warns, “This program is designed to move money out the door slowly and keep going. Moreover, the vast size of the package is going to add big costs in the not-so-distant future, which have barely been discussed.” 
Don’t get me wrong. I’m not some super-
wealthy, right-wing, tea-party-attending radi-cal. Obama’s predecessor will go down as one of this country’s worst presidents, and I ﬁ  rmly believe he spent eight years earning that place in history. So enjoy being a deduction on your parent’s taxes, Jake. I know when I have more at stake, I would rather not be punished for it.

Cadets from UF’s Army ROTC line up in preparation for Joint Service Pass-in-Review at Flavet Field. Cadets from all branches of ROTC were inspected as they marched in front 
of a crowd of people, including a Medal of Honor recipient who came to hand out awards.
Aaron Shoemaker is a cadet 
captain in UF’s Army ROTC 
program. He is a political science major and will be graduating in May. 
While at UF, Shoemaker has 
made his mark by becoming a J. Wayne Reitz Scholar and a sena-tor in Student Government, and  he has won the George C. Mar-shall ROTC Award, an award given to the best cadet in a given branch as voted on by instruc-tors. 
Shoemaker came to UF know-
ing he wanted to serve his coun-try and chose ROTC during Pre-view. 
As a senior, Shoemaker was in 
charge of about 50 freshmen and sophomores. 
After graduation, Shoemaker 
will head to Fort Benning, Ga., for six weeks of training. He will then head to Arizona for nearly 
four months of military intelli-
gence training. 
By October, Shoemaker will 
be stationed in Colorado Springs, Colo., and expects to be deployed within a year after that. 
“ROTC has been a good expe-
rience, an incredible growth op-portunity for me,” he said.
“We’re incredibly blessed in 
this country, and to give back, I think, is the most important thing we can do.”

� USERS CAN SEND MASS TEXTS, 
ALERT EMERGENCY CONTACTS.

UF’s campus is scattered with about 250 
blue emergency phones for those in need of 
help.
But for some iPhone users, help can soon 
be just a tap away.   
A group of students from the University of 
California at Berkeley recently helped develop an iPhone application called Panic N Poke that will be released to the public on Monday, said Paula Luu, group member and Berkeley psy-
chology senior. 
The application is a mass-message service 
that will allow users to contact family, friends 
and authorities in an emergency, she said.
Luu is an intern at the company Life360, 
which invented the application in response to rising sexual assaults and violent crimes around Berkeley, she said.
Twenty assaults and one stabbing were re-
ported on campus this semester, she said. 
The team wanted to create a fun applica-
tion that could also be used in emergency situ-ations.  
The majority of iPhone applications are 
used for entertainment, she said.
Panic N Poke can be downloaded for $1.99 
and comes with an unlimited amount of text and e-mail.
The application has two but-
tons, the panic button for emer-
gency and the poke button for playful contact, Luu said. When pressed, the panic button will alert any contacts chosen by the user.
The application will continue to notify the 
emergency contacts until the alert is canceled.
The poke button allows users to blast a 
mass message to friends, Luu said. The mes-sage can be preset to include a favorite movie quote, a GPS location or a fun audio clip. 
Although the official 2008-2009 campus 
crime report will not be publicly available until Oct. 1, University Police officials said 31 simple assaults and 10 violent crimes have been reported on UF’s campus so far.
Simple assault crimes do not involve ag-
gravation or a deadly weapon.
Violent crimes include homicide, rape, rob-
bery and aggravated assault, according to the Gainesville Police’s Web site.
According to GPD reports, 1,268 simple as-
saults and 1,044 violent crimes occurred city-wide in 2008.‘Panic N Poke’ app for iPhone to be released Monday

Students will gather on the 
Plaza of the Americas tonight to 
remember those who died in the Holocaust more than 64 years ago.
UF’s Jewish Student Union is 
hosting the Holocaust Remem-brance Day event at 6 p.m., said Jason Attermann, the group’s president. The event will feature two guest speakers, UF history professor Geoffrey Giles and UF alumnus and Lost Boy of Sudan Peter Ter, who will talk about 
the Holocaust and genocide, said 
event organizer Danica Samuels.
Yellow memorial candles will 
be distributed to the crowd, and a candlelight vigil will be held, Samuels said. There will also be time for students to write letters to government officials about genocide issues.
After the ceremony con-
cludes, students will walk to Hillel, where the candles will be placed around the building and kept burning for 24 hours to com-memorate those who perished in the Holocaust. 
The movie “Schindler’s List” 
will be shown at Hillel to further educate students on the Holo-caust, Samuels said.
Yom HaShoah, as today is 
known in Israel, is observed as a day of commemoration for the estimated six million Jews who perished in the Holocaust.
The event is meant to encour-
age students to take a more active role in preventing another major occurrence of anti-Semitism and genocide, Samuels said.
To some, the event is more 
significant in light of recent cam-pus events, said UF sophomore Josh Ludin, citing the anti-Semit-ic graffiti painted on the Alpha 
Epsilon Pi fraternity house in 
early April.
“Students may disagree on 
many things, but there is one thing I hope we can all agree on,” Ludin said, “And that is to never let something like the Holocaust happen again, to anyone.”ON CAMpuSMemorial to honor

Though Monday’s sky was cov-
ered in a blanket of gray, some UF 
students managed to lighten the mood with a little green as part of 4/20, an unofficial holiday centered 
on marijuana.
While participating students cel-
ebrated in a variety of ways, there 
was one common theme among their festivities: smoking pot, and lots of it.
Chris*, a UF senior, spent five 
hours burning through one-eighth of an ounce — $60 worth of mari-
juana — with about 10 other friends 
Sunday night as part of his second year celebrating the holiday. 
He said impending exams and 
project due dates forced the group to smoke, make salsa and play Xbox 360 a day early, but these consider-ations were not enough to scrap the holiday altogether.
“I’m not too serious about it, but 
it’s fun to celebrate with friends,” Chris said. “If you have a reason to celebrate, then celebrate.”The holiday, which is observed 
annually on April 20, got its moni-ker from a ritual dating back to the early 1970s, according to a Monday article in The New York Times. 
A group of Northern California 
teens would smoke marijuana every 
day at 4:20 p.m., and the term’s as-
sociation with weed was cemented as word of this practice spread over the next few decades.
Nationally, 4/20 fans often hold 
campus “smoke-outs,” or large group smoking sessions, and pot-themed concerts and festivals.
Local offerings Monday night 
included the Santa Fe College Film Society’s “Smokescreen,” a collec-tion of short student films shown at the Hippodrome State Theatre, and downtown’s Market Street Pub ad-vertised a “4-20 reggae party” fea-turing musician Kevin Batchelor.
Before the film festival, Jared 
Lipscomb, a Santa Fe student and 
member of the film society, greeted 
attendees in full drag and intro-duced himself as “Sparkle Antoi-nette” while Bob Marley played on the speakers.Lipscomb, who hoped to draw 
at least 50 people to the event, said the film society chose the date of the festival with 4/20’s connotations in mind, even though the films and event as a whole were not themed around marijuana.
“We figured more people would 
be looking for something like this to do, and more people would be in the mood to sit around,” Lipscomb said. “But it should be enjoyable no mat-ter what state of mind you’re in.”
Some smokers took a more low-
key approach. Tom*, a UF senior, spent Monday afternoon playing Nintendo 64 and smoking at home.  He said he has smoked pot on 4/20 for the last five years and made no special plans for the day. Though he has smoked with small groups of people to celebrate in the past, Tom said blowing 4/20 out of proportion is silly. 
“At this point, it’s just another 
day,” he said. “I smoke because I en-
joy it, not because it’s a funny holi-
day.”
Both Tom and Chris agreed that 
4/20 celebrations have become more common in recent years and indicate a burgeoning social and political ac-ceptance of marijuana.  
However, some universities have 
targeted the holiday as a problem 
this year. Several U.S. colleges are 
taking steps to discourage student smokers from celebrating too open-ly, according to the Times article. 
At the University of Colorado at 
Boulder, where thousands of stu-dents have participated in smoke-outs on the quad, administrators sent out an e-mail asking students 
to avoid participating in unlaw-
ful activities that would debase the school.
But UF and local police officials 
voiced relatively little concern about the holiday.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes 
said she had heard about concerns at some West coast colleges, but UF has not experienced any problems in the past and did not take any measures to prepare for 4/20 this year.
Similarly, Gainesville Police 
spokesman Keith Kameg said he had no knowledge of 4/20, and the GPD had no plans to take special mea-sures for the day. Without a clearly defined event, such as a large-scale smoke-out, it would be difficult to target smokers, he said.
“Unless it rises to the point where 
it’s affecting others, like getting into a car accident, we’re not society’s babysitters” he said. “We don’t go into people’s houses to see if they’re smoking pot on national pot-smok-ing day.”
“Maybe if we notice something 
like excessive pizza deliveries, we’ll monitor that and handle it on a case-
by-case basis,” Kameg added with a 
laugh.

When Tiffany Robberts left her 
friends and family in North Caro-
lina to attend UF, she planned on finding new friends, not a new ad-
diction.
Instead of meeting people, she 
spent the majority of her time glued to her computer screen, chatting 
with high school friends and her boyfriend over the Internet.As soon as she woke up, she at-
tached herself to the computer and missed classes, sometimes spending 
as many as 12 hours a day on the In-
ternet.
Robberts, now a UF alumna, was 
not alone. She was suffering from what many psychologists today are referring to as “problematic Internet 
use.”
Greg Neimeyer, a UF profes-
sor of counseling psychology, said the appeal of the Internet comes 
from its availability, affordability, anonymity, illusory sense of control 
and excitement.
Robberts broke away from her habits by making friends and occu-
pying herself with work. Now, she only goes on when she has nothing 
better to do.
“I’m glad I use it a lot less now,” 
she said, ”because I have real friends and real things to do.”
Neimeyer said most 
people who are consid-ered Internet addicts 
are drawn to social 
networking Web sites such as Face-
book or MySpace, online games like 
World of Warcraft, gambling, por-nography and auctioning on Web 
sites like eBay. 
According to Neimeyer, the Internet was designed to be addic-
tive.
It allows people to do things they 
would never do in reality because no one knows who they are, he said, especially for habits that are already 
addictive, such as gambling. 
“Nobody knows how much of a 
loser you are,” Neimeyer said. 
He also said according to studies, 
online addiction has been a key fac-
tor in about one-third of divorces, 
and one half of employers indicated 
they have fired someone because of chronic Internet use.
Psychologists are still unsure 
how to classify this phenomenon, Neimeyer said. Some believe it is more like an eating disorder than a drug addiction. A person doesn’t 
have to take drugs, but he or she has 
to eat food. Similarly, it is almost impossible to avoid the Internet, 
especially at the rate at which it is 
growing.
Neimeyer said there are cur-
rently no industry standards for the treatment of Internet addiction and that it takes the better part of a gen-
eration to develop a treatment that 
works.
“The world of problematic Inter-
net use is still inherently problem-atic,” Neimeyer said. Internet addiction drags students from academics

An ongoing study involving UF wants 
to know how students use the Internet to 
hook up.
About 5,000 UF students were chosen 
randomly to receive the questionnaire 
about what sites they use and how they 
use them when looking for sex and rela-
tionships.“We are trying to understand how we 
can use some of these online sites to incor-porate messages about sexual health safe-
ty,” said Robert Cook, an associate profes-
sor at UF who is working on the study.
Questions on the survey are open-end-
ed to find out as much as possible about 
the little-studied field, Cook said.
“We’re going in, at this point, fairly 
open-minded,” he said.
Cook expects to find heavy usage of 
Facebook, Myspace, Craigslist and other more dating-specific Web sites.
The Florida Center for AIDS Research 
paid for the  $15,000 study.The University of South Florida and 
Florida Agricultural and Mechanical Uni-
versity each provided several thousand 
students for the study, which is led by a 
USF professor.
Participants should expect to receive 
at least four e-mails asking them to par-
ticipate before the study closes on May 
15. About one-third of those who’ve been 
asked to participate have responded.

Sen. Mike Bennett, R-Bradenton, discusses the first responder bill that he 
sponsors during a Senate finance and tax committee meeting Monday.
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — It 
was bad enough when Matthew 
Norville rear-ended another driv-
er, crushing the front of his car.
A few weeks later, the Pensaco-
la college student got a $714 bill to 
cover the cost of the county police 
and firefighters who responded.
Florida lawmakers are consid-
ering a ban on such fees, dubbed 
“crash taxes” by detractors who say they’re unfair and not always 
covered by insurance. Six other 
states — Arkansas, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Tennessee and Georgia — already prohibit 
them, and Alabama and California 
may do the same.
“When you have an accident 
you’re taught to call 911,” said Norville’s mom, Amy. “It never 
occurred to us that there would be 
a charge for them.”
A Florida Senate committee 
unanimously approved the pro-
posed ban Monday. A companion 
bill has three more committee stops before the full House can consider it, so it may not reach the floor this session.
Republican Sen. Mike Bennett 
of Bradenton, the bill’s Senate sponsor, said residents already pay property taxes to cover emergency 
services and shouldn’t face addi-
tional fees if they’re in accidents.Sen. fights for ban on ‘crash taxes’
serve the programs, it would be unorthodox because 
the funds are designated for one-time emergencies, not for sustaining a program over the course of a year.
He said there is about $880,000 in operational 
reserves, but that there’s no guarantee there will be money in the fund at the end of the fiscal year.
Patricia Telles-Irvin, UF’s vice president of Stu-
dent Affairs, wrote in an e-mail that she is grateful such a proac-tive approach is being considered to save the programs.
She said in a phone interview 
she is also looking for alternative 
sources of funding for the pro-
grams.
The two programs are on the 
chopping block because they are 
the only programs left in Student Affairs that aren’t mandated by state law, she said.
“The last two years we’ve been given cuts, and 
they’ve taken it all,” she said.
The other cost-saving measure being considered 
by Student Affairs is a merger of Student Mental Health Services with UF’s Counseling Center, which would save about $350,000 while laying no one off.
“I think it would make the services even more 
effective and more efficient,” Telles-Irvin said of the possible merger.Cut programs lack

Ana Gonzalez has never seen the country 
she calls home.
Gonzalez, community service chair for  
UF’s Cuban-American Student Association, 
was born in Miami and raised Cuban.
Although she and her family traveled 
around the world, her grandmother refused to be impressed by places they saw.
“‘This beach is nice,’ she would say, ‘but 
it’s not Cuba,’” Gonzalez said. 
On April 13, President Barack Obama lifted  
decades-long restrictions on travel and money transfers from the United States to Cuba.
Forty-seven years ago, President John F. 
Kennedy issued a trade embargo in hopes of forcing a change in Cuba’s communist govern-ment, then controlled by Fidel Castro. Now, the country is led by his brother, Raul Castro.
Even though this means Cuban-Americans 
are free to visit relatives and their homeland unlimited times, many do not support the de-cision.
Rene Medina, a UF political science senior, 
said he thinks the United States is giving in 
when it should be stricter if it wants to pro-
mote real change.
“I’m disappointed that we’re going back 
and lifting restrictions without getting any-thing in exchange for Cubans,” he said.
Medina said he is hopeful for a bigger 
change but does not believe that lifting this ban will lead to anything substantial.
“I don’t plan on visiting until there is a 
democratic government in Cuba,” he said.
Gonzalez said this change brings hope to 
many Cubans.
“It’s a tiny step,” she said, “but it really does make a difference.”
Danisette Torres, CASA’s membership 
director, said allowing tourism to support a socialist government is not going to solve the 
internal problems Cuba faces.
She said she is hopeful that this is a sign of 
bigger policy changes to come.
Gonzalez said she understands why some 
people think negotiating with a communist 
government is a betrayal of their values and undermines the reasons they left the island, but it is a chance for those who left and their children to go back and help rebuild Cuba.Gonzalez grew up listening to stories about 
her grandfather’s sugarcane plantation and her parents’ visits to nightclubs without any worries about crime.
“I’ve never heard of a single terrible mem-
ory,” Gonzalez said. 
Torres’ parents were also born in Cuba in 
the 1950s, and they often speak about it with a sense of nostalgia in their voices.
Torres said she would like to experience 
the same Cuba her parents did and does not plan on going there until the regime is over and the government returns certain freedoms to its citizens.
When she does go to Cuba, Torres said, she 
wants see her relatives who are still there. 
After that, she wants to visit the parks next 
to her parents’ houses that she heard about in stories, see the beaches and play dominoes with old Cuban men.Lifted restrictions on Cuban travel inspire debate

FAR LEFT: Uri Cararillo, one of 
the Sanchez family members, takes a week’s worth of fam-ily laundry to wash at the local laundromat with her 5-year-old daughter.
LEFT: Strawberries that the 
workers pick have to be “ideal” for the market. The substan -
dard strawberries would be thrown on the ground, and the workers would have to replace them with acceptable ones.
ABOVE: Miguel Sanchez sits on a rock and talks with his friends during the workers’ one-hour break in the afternoon.
BELOW: The Sanchez family has never slept on a mattress since they moved to the United States 10 years ago.
When buying a box of strawberries in the 
market, people may not think about where the 
fruit came from. The number of people and the amount of hard work behind that box of straw-berries might be surprising.
The Sanchezes emigrated from Mexico and 
have been living in the United States for about 10 years. This family of nine travels, works and lives together in a single-trailer home. Their main source of income is picking strawberries in Plant City, Fla. They don’t have a stable in-come, and they don’t know where to go after strawberry season is over.
At about 6 a.m., the Sanchezes ride in a car 
to the strawberry field and start working un-til about 5 p.m. They have been doing this job seven days a week ever since they arrived in the U.S.
The Sanchezes came to the U.S. because they 
could not find any jobs in Mexico. With their total income of $1,000 per month, they are able to support themselves while also sending some money to their relatives in Mexico. They don’t have a major goal for their future or dream of having a big house. They only want to live safely and happily, and they don’t want to go back home.

sippi on Sunday in McKethan Stadium. The Rebels took the series 2-1.
� THE JUNIOR SHORTSTOP AND UF PLAY 
FLORIDA GULF COAST TONIGHT AT 7.
By BOBBY CALLOVI
Alligator Writer
bcallovi@alligator.org
UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan stresses the impor-
tance of pitching and fielding over and over again.
For most of the season, his team’s pitching has 
been rocky and the defense awful.
While the pitching still remains questionable, the 
fielding is finally coming around.
The improved defensive play has been credited 
to the return of shortstop Mike Mooney from injury. 
He fouled a ball off his left foot against Tennessee on March 21 and missed 10 games.
When UF (26-14) takes on Florida Gulf Coast (22-
14) tonight at 7 in Fort Myers, Mooney will take his spot at shortstop, bolstering a strong Gators defense.
“Moving Josh (Adams) to second and get-
ting Mooney back has really helped our infield,” O’Sullivan said. “It has solidified things defensively for us.”
Mooney transferred to UF from Palm Beach Com-
munity College before this season with hype sur-rounding his defense, but his early play on the field 
did not back up his glove’s reputation.
In the first seven games of the season, Mooney 
committed three errors.
Unhappy with Mooney’s defense and leadership 
at short, O’Sullivan moved him to third and Adams 
to shortstop.
Adams didn’t fare much better, making six errors 
in 17 games at the position.Mooney’s return brings improvement to UF defense
Somewhere between renting a 
minivan in Tulsa, Okla., and scarfing down chicken and waf-
fles at 2 a.m. in downtown Atlanta, I realized I have no qualms about saying 
this has been the best four years of my 
life. I also have no problems saying my senior year has been the highlight of those four. It’s not even close.
Back in December, I stood on the 
field of the Georgia Dome as the Gators won the Southeastern Conference Championship, tissue-paper confetti drenching me and finding ways to get 
stuck in my hair. When I got back to 
our Atlanta hotel later that night, I un-covered still more of the colorful scraps hiding in my pockets.
One month later, I roamed the an-
nals of Dolphin Stadium — a place where I have attended Miami Dol-
phins games my whole life — during the 2009 BCS 
National Cham-pionship Game and rubbed shoulders with 
some of the best 
writers in the business. I hov-ered just outside the team photo as the Orange 
and Blue celebrated with goofy smiles on their faces.
I was even in the room when Tim 
Tebow delivered his now-famous speech, so prominent that you can’t buy a commemorative poster without read-ing the 107 immortal words that make up “The Promise.” When stunned re-porters glanced cautiously to their left and right as Tebow stormed out of the Columnist wants another year

If offense wins you games and defense 
wins you championships, the Saints (25-18, 
14-7 Mid-Florida Conference) seem a likely bet to win the MFC this season.
Santa Fe College defeated Lake-Sumter 
Community College 12-1 after eight innings on a mercy rule in its final home game of the season Monday.
“We hadn’t scored against them in 17 in-
nings, and for five innings we only scored 1 run,” SFC coach Johnny Wiggs said. 
“We have only scored 1 run in 22 in-
nings against Lake-Sumter. I was clearly concerned.” 
Keon Broxton scored the first run during 
the first inning with the help of three errors. Broxton got to first base on an error by the second baseman. After stealing second, he was able to reach third on a wild pitch. The center fielder might have scored off of the 
wild pitch, but Lake-Sumter’s third base-
man was in the way of Broxton’s attempt to cross home plate. 
The umpires ruled that the third base-
man interfered with him, and the Saints were given the run.
SFC starting pitcher Gary Merians gave 
up five hits during his seven innings and had two strikeouts in the game.

man came to bat during the bottom of the SANTA FE COLLEGESaints mercy-rule Lakers

Santa Fe College baseball coach� ORLANDO IS DOWN 0-1 IN 
ITS SERIES WITH PHILLY.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
ORLANDO — The Philadelphia 
76ers did something no other team 
managed to do all season — make Dwight Howard mad.
Red-eyed and beat down, the 
usually happy-go-lucky Orlando Magic center said Monday he “would like to see the ball” more at the end of games and is fed up with those bashing his team’s playoff toughness after they lost to the Six-ers in an epic collapse.
“I hate hearing about it. It makes 
me mad,” Howard said. “Any time 
somebody talks about my team and 
the organization, yeah, I’m going to get upset.”
The Magic will need more than 
strong statements to get by a Phila-delphia team that rallied from 18 points down to a 100-98 Game 1 win Sunday. The Sixers not only exposed the Magic’s flaws, they showed they 
can hang with the heavily favored 
Orlando.
Game 2 is Wednesday in Orlan-
do.
“We feel like we have a great 
chance,” said forward Andre Ig-uodala, whose shot with 2.2 seconds remaining gave the Sixers the win. “We just have to go out there and 
show people what we can do.”
What they did was knock the 
Magic around.
Howard was inadvertently 
scratched in the eyes by Sixers center Samuel Dalembert late in the third 
quarter. Howard said Monday he was going to get his eyes examined because he was “seeing just a whole bunch of crazy stuff” when he closed them and felt a “pulsating” sensa-tion when they were open.
But he’s not expected to miss any 
game time and even joked, “I used 
to be a boxer back in my former life, 
so I was used to those punches.”
The rest of the game he didn’t 
find funny.
After he went for a career play-
off-high 31 points and 16 rebounds, the Magic went away from Howard in the final minute, with forwards Hedo Turkoglu and Rashard Lewis 
missing difficult jump shots. How-
ard said the end-of-game strategy of-ten doesn’t go through him because of his shaky free-throw shooting.
But he hopes the team will put 
the ball in his hands in the future to give him a chance.
“I would like to see the ball,” 
Howard said, pausing for a moment 
to gather his thoughts. “But I’m not 
going to complain about it.”
Magic coach Stan Van Gundy 
said he would evaluate his play-calling but insisted players simply missed Howard when he was open.
“Rightly or wrongly, we went to 
what we normally do — pick-and-rolls with (Turkoglu) and Dwight,” Van Gundy said. “Looking back, we had pretty good shots out of them and Dwight was open on several rolls to the rim where we missed him.”
The Sixers seemed to find the 
winning formula.By double-teaming Howard for 
most of the fourth quarter, they es-sentially dared the Magic’s perim-eter players to shoot. Orlando missed badly, and 
whether a team that relies so heavily on 3-pointers is built for the playoffs is a theory the Sixers are ready to test.
“We want him to score one-on-
one,” Sixers guard Andre Miller said of Howard.TUESDAY, APRIL 21, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 23

Hungry Howard wants ball more after Magic collapse
room, we knew we were witnesses 
to something dramatic.
Moments like those have made 
my college career and my two and a half years at the Alligator infinitely 
memorable.
Moments like those make me 
wish I could come back next year.
Before I came to college, I didn’t 
travel much. I grew up in South 
Florida, and in 20 years, I had never visited Georgia, found myself in the central time zone or even seen snow — which I still haven’t done. 
A history like that made me easily 
excitable to see places as seemingly monotonous as Fayetteville, Ark., or Hoover, Ala. While colleagues were complaining about a 6 a.m. plane trip to Oklahoma with a layover in Dallas, I was just thrilled to see air-port terminals in new cities.
I suffered endless insults from 
fellow writers and photographers for getting giddy to cross the Geor-gia-Tennessee state line, but mo-ments like that are what made the entire year special.
With the journalism job market 
about as bad as it gets, those in-stances could be the last time in a long while that I’m so ecstatic over so little.
Next season, the UF football 
team treks into Starkville, Miss. By all accounts, Starkville is a ter-rible place to spend a few days, and some of my colleagues are dread-ing that weekend. But I couldn’t be 
more jealous that the next crop of 
Alligator writers will get to make that trip.
So often in sports, athletes, after 
winning a national championship, will find they don’t know what to do with themselves. After an en-tire season of painful exertion, late nights, exhilarating victories and 
crushing defeats, they can’t possibly 
comprehend that the year is done and the title-clinching game was re-ally how it ended.  
They come to realize the year’s 
worth of effort — not just those ul-timate three hours in the arena — was the reason for their success.
That’s how I feel now. 
I won the jackpot getting to be a 
part of UF athletics for four years — 
the best four years in Gators sports history — and now that it’s over, I understand that it wasn’t about the successful ending, it wasn’t about standing on the field as time expired at the national championship game, it wasn’t about composing this final 
symphony. It was about all those 
things leading up to it, all those memories that will last a lifetime and all the fun I had on the way to this closing column.
Now, as I’m penning my second-
to-last paragraph for the Alligator, I only wish I had something fans fre-quently plead for from their heroes in The Swamp when a professional contract sits on the horizon.
One more year. One more year.EVAN , from page 22
The poor performance by Adams, the lack of 
production from either Jerico Weitzel or Clay-
ton Pisani at second and the emergence of Pres-
ton Tucker at first gave the infield a new look 
upon Mooney’s return.
Tucker’s success made it more sensible to 
move Brandon McArthur to third base, clear-ing the way for Adams to switch to second, 
where he was voted to the All-Southeastern Conference Team last season, and opening up the shortstop spot for Mooney.
The Gators have used that infield in every 
game since Mooney returned against Bethune-Cookman on April 7.
Mooney got off to rough start, committing 
two errors in that game, but in the nine games since, he has only made one blunder.
The errors for the defensive unit as a whole 
are down. In the last eight games, UF has only 
made three errors, compared to 12 in the eight 
games prior.
Even with the recent success, Mooney sees 
the season as a letdown for him defensively, but he is looking for the rest of the season to define him.
“I missed a couple, then it got in my head, 
and it took me awhile to get out of it,” Mooney said. “I’m figuring it out, and I have more er-rors than I would like to have. As long as I 
don’t make any more the rest of the way then 
it’s alright.”
It’s not just his glove that has 
kept him in the lineup. Since his return, Mooney has been giv-
ing opposing pitchers all sorts 
of trouble. 
In the last 10 games, he has 
hit .385 and scored 8 runs while 
batting last in the order.
While his batting average has been impres-
sive, his on-base percentage since coming back has been even better. With nine walks and two hit-by-pitches, the 5-foot-8 shortstop’s on-base 
percentage across those 10 games is at a stag-
gering .553, compared to a season-long team average of .391.
“I do like to work the count, and it is what 
I’m good at with my small strike zone,” Mooney said.Shortstop causing trouble for pitchers
fourth inning. SFC would 
end its final home game with 15 hits, including three from 
Bozeman and two each from 
Andy Mee, Bobby Triglia and Alex Godshall.
One of Godshall’s hits was 
his first career home run.
“Great for him,” Wiggs said. “It was a great way to 
end our last home game 
and to see 
if we can go on the road 
for three 
straight  
games to win a con-
ference championship.”SFC is still in first place in 
the MFC. The state tourna-ment in Winter Haven during 
the first week of May takes 
the top two teams from each conference in Florida.
“Everyone is solid in this 
league. It always comes down to the last couple of games,” Wiggs said. “I doubt this year will be any different.”Santa Fe still atop Mid-Florida ConferenceBASE , from page 22

By ELIZABETH DOW
Alligator Contributing Writer
Next spring, women’s lacrosse 
will make its debut at UF, giving 
the Gators the first Division I pro-
gram in the state and the second in the Southeastern Conference.
UF coach Amanda O’Leary is 
up for the challenge of bringing 
the sport to Gainesville.
O’Leary is coming to UF af-
ter 14 years as the coach at Yale.  
She is ranked fifth in the NCAA 
among active Division I coaches 
in career winning percentage.
“It was a dream come true to 
start a program from scratch,” O’Leary said.
As of now, the roster is com-
posed of 24 incoming freshmen, and creating a unified team with a new program may be the big-gest challenge for O’Leary. 
She hopes to bring a couple 
players up from the UF club team and possibly obtain a few trans-fer athletes from other schools.
Of the 24 players who have 
signed, only one, Jamie Reeg of Park Vista High, is from Florida.  O’Leary said her staff recruited from the hotbeds of lacrosse, 
mostly in the mid-Atlantic. Sev-
enteen of the players are from Maryland. The rest are from New Jersey and New York.
“Hopefully in the future there 
will be a little better balance of some from Florida, but at this point we felt pretty confident and happy about the group that 
we have coming here,” O’Leary 
said.
Rachel Smith, a defender from 
Ellicott City, Md., is excited to start on a new team.
“I like how everybody at UF is 
so into helping academically and athletically,” she said.     
O’Leary said many of the play-
ers from Maryland have played 
together on the same club teams, 
and several are coming from the same high schools. 
O’Leary believes this will 
make it easier to mold the fresh-
men into a team.    “They will already have a pre-
established relationship on the 
field, and they will know what each other’s moves are, so that will be a positive for us,” O’Leary 
said.  
Smith will be joined at UF by 
two high school teammates, at-
tackers Ashley Bruns and Aman-da Wedekind. 
“I think it will be better to start 
knowing people already,” Smith said. “Ashley has been my best friend, and she plays attack, so I 
can get the ball to her.”   
UF joins Vanderbilt as the sec-
ond team in the SEC to have a 
women’s lacrosse program. The Commodores, who have played 
since 1996, compete in the Amer-
ican Lacrosse Conference. Since the SEC does not have a tour-nament, the Gators will join the ALC as well.
The ALC includes lacrosse 
powerhouses Northwestern — No. 1 in the country with all 20 first-place votes in the Intercolle-
giate Women’s Lacrosse Coaches 
Association Poll — No. 13 Ohio State and No. 17 Penn State.
“If we can be competitive 
within the conference, we’re go-
ing to be competitive nationally,” 
O’Leary said. “So that’s obvi-ously a clear-cut goal of ours, to be competitive within the confer-
ence.”
O’Leary has high hopes for the 
team’s first season.
“We want to win national 
championships just like every team on this campus wants to 
do,” O’Leary said. “And we’re hoping that it happens sooner rather than later.”
