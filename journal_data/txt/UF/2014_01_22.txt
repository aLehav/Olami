Alcohol and sunscreen were 
topics of discussion at Student 
Senate on Tuesday night.
Two resolutions passed 
unanimously: One will place 
a referendum question on the 
ballot about UF’s open-con-tainer policy, and the other supports free sunscreen dis-pensers for two campus recre-ation areas.
The referendum question, 
which will appear on the Stu-dent Government elections bal-
lot Feb. 18 and 19, is designed 
to gauge student opinion about whether UF should implement “an open container policy al-lowing those of the legal drink-ing age to carry an open con-tainer containing alcohol on campus during home football game days,” according to the language of the bill.
Abby Whiddon, chairwom-
an of the Senate External Af-fairs Committee and the bill’s author, said it was inspired by student inquiries about UF’s al-cohol-on-campus policy, which she said is vague.
“External affairs did receive 
a lot of concerns from students questioning what the policy 
was,” Whiddon said. “As we 
started digging deeper, we real-ized that we are one of the few schools in the Southeast that didn’t really have a policy on it. We’re really just interested Alcohol question

One of the most comprehensive 
studies conducted on the long-term 
effects of heavy drinking suggests men’s brains are signiﬁ  cantly sus-ceptible to the toxicity of alcohol.
But although heavy drinking 
was linked to cognitive decline in aging men, it was not in aging wom-en. The reasons behind that are still unclear, though UF experts offered possible explanations.
“Men do metabolize alcohol 
more quickly than women,” said Julia Varnes, GatorWell Health Pro-motion Services specialist.
While “heavy drinking” for men 
in the study was deﬁ  ned as more than 1.2 ﬂ  uid ounces of pure alcohol a day, women had to drink at least 0.6 ounces a day to qualify. 
Varnes said men break down li-
quor faster because they have more of the enzyme alcohol dehydroge-nase, which is the workhorse of the metabolization process. Though women have less of the enzyme, they do not lose it over time. But men do.
“As men get older, they become 
intoxicated more easily,” Varnes said.
The study, which was published 
in Neurology this month, was car-ried out over the course of 10 years.
The research on both men’s and 
women’s brains was conducted 
separately, and the objective of the 
study was not to compare the results between both sexes but rather to de-termine if cognitive decline occurred in each sex and whether it could be linked to alcohol consumption.
“Cognitive decline” was deﬁ  ned as a decrease in the brain’s process-ing speed and efﬁ  ciency as well as a deterioration in memory, according to the study. More than 5,000 men and more than 2,000 women partici-pated.   
Some have attributed studies on 
estrogen and memory preservation as possible reasons for why wom-
en’s brains seem less susceptible to 
the toxicity of alcohol, but Thomas Foster, UF neurology professor and McKnight Brain Institute chair for cognitive aging and memory re-search, said that’s a weak explana-

The Gainesville community is weighing in on the six 
Florida same-sex couples who have ﬁ  led a suit against the 
state’s same-sex marriage ban.
Earlier Tuesday, the lawsuit was ﬁ  led in the Miami-
Dade Circuit Court by the couples suing for the right to marry and the Equality Florida organization for LGBT justice.  
Similar lawsuits are being ﬁ  led in states across the 
country, said Danaya Wright, a UF Levin College of Law professor.
Utah and Oklahoma are the two most recent states to 
lift their marriage equality bans.
“This is one of many cases being ﬁ  led to force the is-
sue onto the Supreme Court,” Wright said. “Eventually the Supreme Court will probably say that prohibiting gay marriage is unconstitutional.”Some are hopeful that the lawsuit will reﬂ  ect a more 
liberal Florida.
LB Hannahs, director of LGBT affairs within UF’s Mul-
ticultural and Diversity Affairs, said a majority of Florid-ians support marriage equality.
“People think Florida is conservative,” she said. “The 
policies and politics of Florida do not reﬂ  ect the popu-lar opinion, and efforts to overturn the constitutional ban will prove that.”
Other local residents are also optimistic about the fu-Couples take marriage equality cases to Florida court

More than 200 people have im-
personated him. More than three 
writers have attempted to mur-der him. It’s no mystery why this 127-year-old inspector caused con-
flict when he was declared alive 
and free. 
A Chicago district judge settled 
the case on copyright by ruling that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes has officially moved into the U.S. public domain, according to the December ruling.
Jeff Harrison, a professor in the 
UF Levin College of Law who spe-cializes in copyright, said the deci-sion means that anyone can use the characters. 
“You couldn’t claim that they’re 
your own, but you don’t have to get permission from the (Sir Arthur Conan Doyle Literary) Estate,” which owned the rights to the sto-ries, he said. 
It happens to every copyrighted 
character eventually, he said, using Superman and Mickey Mouse as examples.
Attorney and writer Leslie 
Klinger won the lawsuit against the Estate for public ownership. He said he believes that fans should be able to interpret the stories in their own ways.  
“Everybody loves the stories. Everybody has their own picture of what Holmes looks like,” he said. “Any friend of Sherlock Holmes is a friend of mine.”
Klinger said he fears the Estate 
might file an appeal to keep the characters under copyright.
“The Estate did serve the func-
tion of being a traffic cop ... to 
weed out what they perceived as 
the crap,” Klinger said, “but that’s their censorship.” 
At UF’s SwampCon over the 
weekend, fans had their own opin-ions.
UF alumna Amber Hollings-
worth has led panel discussions about the BBC show “Sherlock” 
and other characters at conventions for about 10 years. She said she knows of diehard fans of the origi-
nal works — known collectively as the “canon” — who would not ap-prove of newer stories.
“There are people who are in 
that canon purist arena ... that are not fans of anything that veers from the canon as prescribed,” she said.
Hollingsworth doesn’t think the 
copyright expiration will change the integrity of the character. She said she looks forward to further 
public creations of Sherlock.
Camila Rodriguez, an 18-year-
old UF English freshman, said that 
as long as creators honor the origi-nal characters, new works are ac-ceptable.
“I mean, he’s Sherlock Holmes,  
for God’s sake,” she said after Hol-lingsworth’s discussion. “You have 
to respect that he’s brilliant.” 
Only Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 
would be able to define the lines. 
The official website of the Estate features a quote from Doyle re-corded when a British writer work-ing on a play about Holmes asked permission to give the detective a wife.
“You may marry him, murder 
him, or do anything you like to him,” he said.

After a series of unfortunate 
events featuring a foot chase, a 
Chapstick container full of co-
caine and a shoe stuffed with mar-
ijuana, police arrested an Alachua man on various drug charges. 
Alachua Police Department ar-
rested 23-year-old Jarrick Martell Edwards on charges of cocaine, marijuana and drug equipment possession as well as resisting an officer without violence and vio-
lation of probation charges, ac-
cording to an arrest report.
At about 11:40 p.m., an officer 
stopped Edwards for a pedestrian violation near Northwest 134th Terrace and asked to see his ID. 
Edwards did not have his ID, 
but records confirmed he was on felony probation, according to the report. 
The officer told Edwards he 
smelled marijuana, and Edwards said he had just come out of a car where the occupants were smok-ing marijuana.
A backup officer searched Ed-
wards and found a pink Chapstick container full of cocaine as well as a blue plastic bag with cocaine. 
Edwards was also holding 
$498 in cash, which he laid on the hood of the patrol car during the search. 
When the officer told Edwards 
to put his hands behind his back, 
he ran. 
Officers chased him until the 
intersection of Northwest 135th 
Terrace and Northwest 154th Av-
enue, according to the report. 
After officers caught Edwards, 
they noticed a small plastic baggy 
with marijuana was in a shoe that fell off of him.
Edwards told officers he 
couldn’t breathe, so they called EMT responders, who took him to Spring Hill Medical Center, ac-
cording to the report. 
Officials then found more co-
caine on Edwards at the hospital. 
Officers booked Edwards into 
the Alachua County Jail at about 8:20 a.m., where he remained as 
of press time.Alachua man arrested

Females who drank heavily were 
more likely to have a high-rank job
tion. 
“The mean age was 56,” Foster said. “While es-
trogen is both neurotrophic — acts like a growth 
hormone — and neuroprotective — shielding brain cells from toxins — these protective effects decline 
as estrogen declines with age.” 
Foster also noted that the female participants 
who identified as heavy drinkers were more likely 
to have a higher occupational position, while this was not true in men.
“One way to keep cognition intact is to exercise 
cognitive functions,” Foster said. “Having occupa-tions and recreations that engage cognitive pro-cesses are more likely to underlie the protection from heavy drinking.”
Akhil Kundhavaram, 21, UF anthropology se-
nior, acknowledged the study but said it wouldn’t make an impact on his life.
“The way I see it, college is four years,” Kund-
havaram said. “I’m not going to be drinking like this all my life.”drinking , from page 1
Sunscreen dispensers supported, too  
in getting student feedback on 
how they feel about the issue.”
According to a gameday code 
of conduct guide on the Univer-sity Police website, having open 
containers of alcohol on public 
streets, sidewalks and thorough-fares violates a city ordinance. 
The ordinance is enforced 
throughout campus.
The University of Georgia, 
the University of Missouri, 
Florida State University and the 
University of Central Florida 
have implemented some form 
of open-container policies for home football games, according to the background section of the bill.Referendums are nonbinding 
and are only meant to provide feedback to SG and administra-tion.
“We’re really excited to see 
how students respond to it,” Whiddon said.
Another resolution passed 
Tuesday supports the Depart-ment of Recreational Sports’ plan to put free sunscreen dis-pensers at Broward Outdoor Recreation Complex and the University Village South vol-leyball courts, next to Southwest Recreation Center.
Senate President Pro-Tempo-
re Elliot Grasso, who was one of the bill’s authors, said he spear-headed the program by propos-ing it to the RecSports board of directors, of which he is a mem-ber.
The resolution “commends” 
RecSports for launching the sun-screen program and for “pro-viding students with proper resources to live a healthier life-style,” according to the text.
Grasso said RecSports is go-
ing to fund the pilot program, which means purchasing two 10-liter cases of sunscreen. Gras-so said he doesn’t know how much the project would cost or if it will be broadened later.
“We’re not sure how the proj-
ect is going to be … expanded 
right now,” he said. “We’re just 
focusing on the pilot program.”
The dispensers will be in-
stalled during Spring Break.

Florida does not recognize same-sex unions from other states
ture for Florida same-sex couples.
Terry Fleming, co-president for the 
Pride Community Center of North Central 
Florida board of directors, and his partner 
have been together for 16 years.
Fleming said he is eager to see how the 
issue will unfold.“We’re excited that something is finally 
moving forward to overturn this unfair 
ban here in Florida,” he said. “This is ma-
jor step forward in recognized support of equal rights for all citizens.”  
Fleming said he doesn’t want to leave 
Florida, where same-sex marriage is cur-rently barred, to get married.  
“Being able to celebrate where you live with family and friends is very important to all people,” Fleming said. “My partner 
and I are looking forward to the day we 
can do that.”  
But even if Fleming went elsewhere 
to get married, his marriage would not 
be recognized in his home state. In 2008, 
Florida voters approved an amendment to the state constitution banning same-sex marriage.
Alexandra Danovitch, a 21-year-old UF 
business and political science senior, said that the couples filing the lawsuit should not have to fight for their right to marry.
“It’s completely unnecessary that they 
are not allowed to get married,” she said. “It’s not fair that people in one state get to get married and not in another.”marriage , from page 1“Everybody loves the

ALISON ECKERLE
Alligator Contributing Writer
Floridians tend to be annoyed by tourists. Some 
have accents, drive more aggressively and run scream-
ing out of the ocean when they see harmless moon jel-
lyﬁ  sh swim across their line of sight.
According to demographic experts, however, some 
of the tourists may be here to stay.
An article by The Associated Press reported that 
Florida’s population will surpass that of New York in 
the next two years, making it the third largest state in the country.
Florida’s population grew at a rate of 2.7 percent 
from 2010 to 2012, and New York’s population has 
only been growing at 1 percent per year for the past 
two years, according to data from the census bureau. 
Stanley Smith, population program director at UF’s 
Bureau of Economic and Business Research, explained 
some possible reasons for why it’s happening.
People in their 20s, 30s and 40s are attracted to jobs 
in the tourism, construction, medicine and ﬁ  nance in-
dustries, he said. 
Those in their 50s and 60s are attracted to the cli-
mate.
“Florida has a long history of growth,” he said. As for the population’s effect on UF, Smith said the 
“impact will be notable.” 
He said campus may not expand physically, but 
the growth of distance learning  could bring UF de-grees to more new residents.
Many in- and out-of-state students like Florida for 
many of the same reasons Smith listed.
Alyssa King, a 19-year-old UF biology freshmen 
from Rockland County, N.Y. — about 20 minutes out-side New York City — said she enjoys the Southern hospitality. 
“The people are so nice,” she said. “They open the 
door for you.”
Sarasota native Shane Ahles, a 21-year-old UF eco-
nomics junior, said he appreciates the climate. 
“I like the fact that you can play sports year-round 
outside,” he said, adding that he enjoys the beaches as well.
Stella Heekin, who hails from Woodinville, Wash., 
said she loves attending UF because of the school spirit. 
“I spent the most time here out of all my college 
tours,” the 18-year-old UF public relations freshman 
said. “The atmosphere is what I wanted.”WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 22, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

worse than OkCupid
Call it a millennial thing: Online dating is now, more 
or less, an acceptable way to meet someone. For col-lege students, it makes sense. Among going to class-
es, working part-time jobs, balancing extracurriculars and browsing the slim pickings of the Gainesville-nightlife scene, 
it’s hard to find a mate. Online dating provides an intuitive 
solution, complete with matrices that calculate who your best matches are based on personality. Plus there’s the added convenience of being able to browse dating options in the comfort of your own home — preferably in a pair of sweat-pants. 
A new kind of dating website, Seeking Arrangements, 
offers a unique twist to the dating equation. Seeking Ar-rangements caters to sugar daddies and sugar babies. In lay-
man’s terms, Seeking Arrangements users seek “mutually 
beneficial” arrangements that involve financial support in exchange for “companionship.” Companionship, of course, is open to interpretation. 
On Tuesday, we reported that UF ranked No. 21 on a list 
of fastest-growing sugar baby universities, calculated by the number of Seeking Arrangements sign-ups. The news is a bit surprising. Unlike South or Central Florida, Gainesville isn’t exactly crawling with wealthy older men. But numbers don’t 
lie, and UF students have spoken: They’re ready to cash in on 
their youthful good looks, sharp wit and stunning intellect. 
Ever since its birth, Seeking Arrangements has come un-
der fire for enabling what many call “Internet prostitution.” Of course, not all transactions made between Seeking Ar-rangements users are innocent, and it’s impossible to gauge how many women are trading sex for money. 
But is it really any worse than the myriad of dating web-
sites that already exist? As any OkCupid user can tell you, 
the number of creepy messages requesting — and, more of-
ten, begging for or demanding — no-strings-attached sex are staggering. The worst kind of people, it seems, flock to dating websites. Just check out the “Creepy White Guys” Tumblr, a blog where Asian women submit messages they’ve received on OkCupid from white men seeking a “submissive,” “femi-nine” Asian woman. 
The Internet has brought us many great things: the Dom-
ino’s Pizza Tracker, Etsy and infinite cat videos. It also, for 
better or for worse, opened a new world of sexual transac-
tions. People make money by performing on webcams. The Internet porn industry is booming, and a no-strings-attached hookup is as easy as creating a Grindr or Tinder profile. And as long as there is OkCupid and Craigslist, there will be quick sexual transactions. 
However, many sugar babies have published written ac-
counts of their nonsexual arrangements, so such is possible.
Before you condemn a student for using Seeking Arrange-
ments to pay for college, ask yourself: Would you rather re-
ceive message after nasty message on OkCupid while work-
ing a lame part-time job at Jamba Juice, or would you rather 
be paid for your time and personality?

Fellow students,
Today marks the launch of a new mobile safety ap-
plication provided by Student Government as a comple-
ment to the already existing safety and security effort 
taking place on campus. TapShield is a unique service that pairs state-of-the-art technology with campus safe-ty to provide students with the ability to summon help 
from anywhere on campus at anytime, and allows emer-
gency services to respond more efficiently.
Once the app is downloaded, users can alert campus 
dispatch and initiate a two-way communication via a direct phone call or silent messaging during an emer-
gency. With one tap, emergency responders are pro-
vided with real-time GPS data and unique profile infor-mation including a picture, personal characteristics and medical details that will aid responding authorities as 
they address the emergency situation. 
Among the other applications that were considered, 
TapShield stands above the rest. TapShield is the only 
application that features one-touch emergency alert, two-way messaging between users and dispatch, a tim-
er option designed to provide security while walking 
home or going for a run, and yank technology, which signals an emergency by yanking headphones from the 
device.  
Student Government sincerely hopes that students 
will not find themselves in a situation that requires 
emergency response. Nonetheless, we are aware that 
dangers exist and are confident that TapShield will aid 
responders, reduce response time and increase student safety on campus.
Students can download the application by searching 
“TapShield” on the Google Play and App Store or by 
visiting TapShield.com from a smartphone and clicking 
on “View” in the top header.

Student Senate PresidentIn response to Lauren Adamson’s Tuesday column: 
The problem with selfies isn’t that they’re too vainful — it’s that their focus is wrong
Dear Alligator, 
I would like to submit this as a letter to the editor and  
CC to Lauren Adamson.
The problem with “selfies” is not that they’re too 
vain or even prideful.
It’s they’ve got their “focus” wrong.  Most of the great philosophers and religions would 
teach us that life’s meaning is found by serving others, not ourselves.  
If you want to find your purpose in life, go forth and 
feed the homeless.
Or volunteer at a pet rescue.
Or join one of those environmental groups that 
remove invasively dangerous plants like the air potatoes 
shading out our trees and water hyacinth choking our canals.  
I’m not going to tell you where to find your purpose 
in life.
But I can guarantee you won’t find it focusing on 
your external appearance.  
If you take 15 minutes styling your hair in the 
morning, it’s fine to take “pride in workmanship” in that it came out well.
But if you think you’re better than someone with 
frizzy, matted hair, you’re not just vain.
You’re a bigot.  “Hair-ism” or “clothes-ism” are certainly not as bad 
as racism — but they come from the same dark place of 
the heart — the idea that you’re better than someone 
else because of your physical external traits.
Sincerely,
William Deich

Reddit co-founder Alexis 
Ohanian and Gaines-ville’s own Grooveshark 
co-founder Josh Greenberg ad-dressed an auditorium full of 
UF millennials last week. The 
talk touched on the Internet, en-trepreneurship and failure. 
Their message can be 
summed up as such: Take a risk, do not be afraid to fail, and if you do what you love, you will never work a day in your life. The presentation, full of memes and the occasional cat picture — we 
are talking about the Internet, after all — was 
meant to encourage a group of young people to realize all of the wealth of information and opportunity that is in front of them. 
Ohanian and Greenberg told their stories 
of triumph, failure and risk-taking. Ohanian recalled how the founders of Reddit were sent to Yahoo headquarters, only to be rudely criticized by an executive. Greenberg recalled 
some of the obstacles Grooveshark faced in 
its onset. Regardless of these hurdles in the way of their Internet success stories, they per-severed, powered through and prevailed. 
The event was inspiring. It made me feel 
like I should start my own Internet compa-ny. 
But the thing I took away from the event 
— more powerful than any startup story — 
was the unbridled power of a young person’s 
spirit.
Take these individuals: At face value, they 
are just two young people. Only one of them has a college degree, and both described themselves as having a geeky adolescence. With this in mind, it is hard to imagine they’d later attain such success. 
But the intangibles made the difference 
— the drive, the determination and the real-ization that they could start something big. What do you attribute that to? I’d say it’s the power of a young person’s spirit. We all have it, but many of us don’t realize how power-ful it is. When we fail — and we will — we are young enough to believe that there will always be another opportunity for us to take advantage of. 
The power of a young person 
comes from the way he or she sees the world. The world seems 
to be so open for the taking. As 
college students, we have not yet gotten a real taste of the world. As we sit in our dorm rooms and classrooms thinking about our future endeavors in the real 
world, we can do so only by picturing the real world in the way it should work, not the way it does work. Even though this sounds like 
a negative outlook, it’s not. We need starry 
eyed idealism in this world. We need vision-aries who see the world differently. Though some might think they are crazy, we need those young people crazy enough to think differently. 
This harkens back to the famous 1997 Ap-
ple commercial where “the people who think they are crazy enough to change the world 
are the ones who do.” 
You may be thinking, that’s good and 
that’s great. But how does this affect me? I 
can’t start a business. I’m just a college stu-dent with a literature degree.
It would be too easy to rattle off the names 
of successful college-aged entrepreneurs, Ohanian and Greenberg included, to com-bat this mindset. But I would suggest tak-
ing a look in your backyard. Surprisingly, 
Gainesville is becoming an entrepreneurial hub. There are so many incubators and advis-ers willing to help your startup idea. Start by taking the Introduction to Entrepreneurship class. Go to the Innovation Hub and Starter Space. And really, that’s just the beginning.        
When you see this thriving entrepreneur-
ial community in Gainesville and all of the in-
formation and resources at your disposal, you 
begin to think, “Should I start something?” instead of “Could I start something?”
And why not now? You’re a young per-
son after all.

It’s no secret that college gradu-
ates are facing an uphill battle these days, unless you have an 
in-demand major such as account-ing, engineering or computer sci-
ence — in which case, you’re set.  
Outstanding student loan debt 
has nearly doubled since 2007 and 
now sits at about $1.2 trillion. The unemployment rate for recent col-lege graduates is still around 8 per-cent, compared to about 7 percent for the general population. And the U.S. ranks second to last in the world in terms of parents’ perception of their kids’ money management skills, ac-cording to Visa’s International Fi-nancial Literacy Barometer 2012.  
Although a college education 
continues to provide a solid return 
on investment, students must be ready to put their best foot forward when entering the “real world.”  That means you should begin using credit as soon as possible and con-
template a move to a new city.  Al-
low me to explain. 
Whether you know exactly what 
a credit score is at this point — let alone where you stand — it’s im-portant that you understand just how critical credit is to adult life. Not only does your credit standing dictate which loans and credit cards you can get approved for, but it also 
impacts the insurance premiums 
that you pay, your ability to lease a car or rent an apartment and your odds of being hired for a job that involves a security clearance or the handling of money.
That’s where credit cards enter 
the picture. While the thought of college kids using credit is enough to give many parents nightmares, credit cards are actually the most efﬁ  cient credit-building tools avail-able — provided that you use them responsibly. They report account information to the major credit bureaus on a monthly basis, and 
the information in your resulting 
credit reports is what credit scores are based on as well as what ﬁ  nan-cial institutions and other decision makers use to evaluate your ﬁ  nan-cial responsibility. As long as you always pay your bill on time and avoid using too much of your avail-able credit, the information in your reports will be positive, and your credit standing will improve. You don’t even need to make purchases with plastic if you don’t want to be-cause simply having an open credit card account that is in good stand-ing will improve your credit.  
College students are also in a po-
sition to garner unusually impres-
sive card terms, considering their 
limited income and largely unprov-en ﬁ  nancial track record.  Credit card companies understand that a college degree comes with above-average earning potential, while a college student’s youth offers the potential for lifelong use of ﬁ  nancial products and a lot of resulting revenue.
For example, the BankAmeri-
card Cash Rewards Credit Card for Students offers 3 percent cash back on gas, 2 percent on groceries and 1 percent on everything else. The Jour-ney Student Rewards Credit Card from Capital One offers 1.25 percent cash back across all purchases dur-ing months that you pay your bill on time. Opening such a card would therefore help you save on short-term expenses as well as over the long-haul, via a higher credit score.
In addition, employment op-
portunities are not geographically consistent.  Local economies are re-covering at different rates from the Great Recession, different areas are dominated by different industries and cost-of-living-adjusted salaries vary widely.
That’s why it’s worth checking 
out CardHub’s rankings of the best and worst cities for small-business employees. Why small business?  Such ﬁ  rms are the biggest non-gov-ernment job source in the country, employing nearly half of the private workforce and adding more than 60 percent of the new jobs created 
in the last 20 years, according to the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics.  CardHub therefore compared the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the United States, using 10 different metrics de-signed to evaluate the current small business job market in each area as well as its growth prospects moving forward.
Three Florida cities — Tampa (9), Miami (11), and Orlando (12) — crack the top 15 in the rankings, but if you are considering a more substantial move, you might want to check out Denver, Boston, Min-
neapolis, Seattle and San Francisco, 
which represent the top ﬁ  ve cit-ies for small-business employees.  Those cities offer relatively high starting salaries, industrial variety and many small-business employ-ers per capita.  
On the other side of the coin, 
places like San Diego, Philadelphia, Sacramento, Riverside and Detroit boast lethargic economic growth, relatively high unemployment and fewer overall options for new en-trants to the job market.
At the end of the day, college is 
about preparing you for the “real 
world.” You’re supposed to study 
for a career and learn socialization, but major life skills like money man-agement are too often left off the agenda. You may therefore have to do a bit of independent study to ready your credit score and job ap-plicant proﬁ  le for the big time.

Speaking OutThis week, we celebrat-
ed the life and work of Martin Luther King 
Jr., the most well-known and important leader of 
the American civil rights 
movement. King sought to use the power of nonvio-lent protest and his unpar-alleled oratorical skills to promote social and political equality for all Americans, regardless of race, color or economic status.  
King’s activism and oratory, most fa-
mously displayed during the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, helped ensure the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. These two pieces of legisla-tion were essential in the ﬁ  ght against racial segregation, discrimination and disenfranchisement. 
King’s legacy extends beyond his role 
in the struggle for racial equality. He also began the Poor People’s Campaign, which was an effort to improve the eco-nomic status of impoverished and work-ing Americans of all races. 
America has made great strides in the 
area of racial freedom and equality over the past ﬁ  ve decades, most dramatically manifested in the election and re-election 
of the nation’s ﬁ  rst black president. How-
ever, the economic aspect of King’s mes-sage has largely been forgotten and ig-nored, even as the ranks of the poor and underprivileged continue to swell. 
The problems facing America’s mid-
dle and working classes are vast in size and scope. Although the ofﬁ  cial unem-ployment rate has fallen to 6.7 percent, 
much of that decline has resulted from 
millions simply giving up on looking 
for work. The federal minimum wage 
of $7.25 is barely enough to keep many 
out of poverty. The gap between rich and poor in the U.S. is wider than in any oth-er country in the developed world. Since 2009, 95 per-cent of all income gains have gone to the top 1 percent of earners, while middle- and 
working-class incomes have 
stagnated or even declined.
King’s dream of a nation 
free of racial discrimination has not yet been realized. 
According to the U.S. Department of 
Justice, police brutality and harassment on the basis of race has increased in re-cent years. In one study, 25 percent of po-
lice ofﬁ  cers said that they had witnessed 
fellow ofﬁ  cers unfairly harassing citizens “most likely because of his/her race.” 
Restrictive voting laws are roadblocks 
in the path toward racial equality. Ac-cording to a study, provisions such as those reducing early voting hours and creating  stringent ID requirements in or-der to vote could have a disproportionate 
effect on racial minorities. 
The Supreme Court ruling in Shelby 
County v. Holder, which overturned a 
critical section of the Voting Rights Act, only compounds the problem of political inequity for minorities. Although Con-gress is currently working on an amend-ment to the Voting Rights Act that would restore many of the protections stripped 
away by the court, that legislation’s fu-
ture is uncertain. 
When King was assassinated in  
1968, he was helping Memphis sanita-tion workers organize for better pay and working conditions as part of the Poor People’s Campaign. Today, middle- and working-class Americans face many of the same challenges they did. 
There is little doubt King would be 
speaking out on their behalf were he alive today.

Ties were straightened, resumes were 
stacked, and comfortable shoes were 
switched to heels. Gators were prepared for Career Showcase.
UF students and alumni ﬁ  lled the Ste-
phen C. O’Connell Center for a two-day event connecting students to employers of-fering internships and full-time jobs.
Tuesday focused on nontechnical ﬁ  elds, 
and today will focus on technical ﬁ  elds. 
Professional headshots were offered free 
of charge both days in a designated Linke-dIn photo area.
“Branding oneself professionally” with 
headshots is a service recently offered by the Career Resource Center, said Heather White, director of the CRC. 
Kenneth Haskins, a UF food and resource 
economics junior, said he was astonished by the number of employers. More than 250 companies attended both days of the event.White said she expects a turnout of more 
than 8,000 students and alumni this year.  
The event continues to grow and attract 
more students and employers every year. UF’s Career Showcase is the largest career fair in the southeast, said White. There was a 5 percent increase in employers this year compared to last year. 
Employers ranging from UF Health 
Shands Hospital to the U.S. Navy ﬁ  lled two 
levels of the O’Connell Center. Many of-
fered positions both locally and abroad but said they all look for the same values in a potential employee.
“It starts with everything from a good 
handshake to eye contact,” said Bill Wease, a program director at the Norfolk Ship Sup-port Activity Regional Maintenance Center.
One key accessory for many students 
was not the perfect briefcase or a killer suit — it was conﬁ  dence.
Andrew Hutcherson, a UF ﬁ  nance and 
information systems senior, said he felt great about the two internships he applied for.
“I think I got the job,” said Hutcherson.

The UF College of Dentistry is tak-
ing strides in shortening the time it 
takes for patients to obtain picture-per-
fect smiles. 
The Department of Orthodontics in 
the UF College of Dentistry is conduct-
ing a trial using a new device that emits 
electronic pulses in the mouth. The de-
vice works in conjunction with clear aligners to decrease the amount of time it takes to straighten teeth, said Timo-thy Wheeler, a professor in the College 
of Dentistry and the principal investi-
gator of the study.
“What we hope to see is that this one 
certain pulse frequency will allow the 
tooth to move faster,” Wheeler said.
For patients wearing traditional 
braces, the device has been shown to 
increase the rate of alignment by about 50 percent, Wheeler said.
The device, called AcceleDent Aura, 
is manufactured by OrthoAccel Tech-nologies Inc. It is available for about $1,000 from some orthodontists. 
Calogero Dolce, the chair of UF’s 
Department of Orthodontics, said he is 
interested in the results of the study. 
“Clearly, the hope is that the teeth 
will move faster, which means treat-
ment will ﬁ  nish faster, which means 
kids will be done sooner, which is a 
win-win situation for everyone, “ Dolce said.
Sabina Staruszkiewicz, a 19-year-old 
UF ﬁ  nance freshman, has been dealing with braces for the second time in about 
a year and hates them.
She thinks a lot of patients will want 
to use this new device.
“If I could have had these off in six 
months, I would have paid double the 
amount,” Staruszkiewicz said.Pulses could straighten teeth

If there ever were a point during 
Billy Donovan’s tenure at Florida when 
he needed a deep bench, this would be the year.
Gone are the days of playing three 
starters for 30 or more minutes each game like the Gators did en route to winning a second straight national championship in 2007. Because of injuries and suspensions 
this season, Donovan has been forced to spread playing time more evenly across the board.
However, the bench has answered 
the call for No. 6 Florida so far, and Donovan said that’s been a key to the Gators’ 15-2 start and nine-game win-ning streak.
“I think one of the things that’s 
been good with our team is our team has recognized that when we’ve been down a man or have been short some personnel, we’ve had some other guys step into some roles,” Donovan said. “And I tell our guys all the time, ‘Whether you play 12 minutes or play 25 minutes, what are you doing with 
the amount of time or minutes that 
you’re being given?’”
With the regular season just passing 
the halfway point, the Gators’ bench is on pace to have seen the most playing time under Donovan since KenPom.com started keeping track of the stat in 2007.  
Florida’s bench has played 34.4 per-
cent of Florida’s minutes this season. In the seven years KenPom.com has kept statistics on bench percentage minutes, Donovan has limited his role players’ playing time to 28 percent or fewer each year, which was one of the lowest in the nation.
But with early-season suspensions

The true foundation for any elite defense 
doesn’t start on a collegiate field. 
It starts on the recruiting trail.  
UF’s current 2014 recruiting class is ranked 
ninth in the country and currently consists of 22 commits. Nine of those are on defense. 
Last season, true freshman Vernon Har-
greaves III — one of the most highly touted 
recruits of 2013 — had an immediate impact at UF. There are several recruits in this year’s class who have the talent to become playmak-ers immediately.One of the most sought after defensive 
backs in the 2014 class is Jalen Tabor, who is already enrolled and on campus at Florida. Tabor was originally committed to Arizona, but he flipped to UF the week after the Under 
Armour All-America Game. 
Tabor, the No. 10 player in the Rivals.com

very good instincts at the position. With cor-nerbacks Marcus Roberson and Loucheiz Pu-
rifoy leaving school early for the NFL Draft, Tabor has the skillset that could earn him a starting spot opposite Hargreaves. 
Four-star defensive tackle Thomas Holley 
flipped to UF last week after previously ver-
bally committing to Penn State. Holley gets off 
blocks well, and he has pretty decent speed 
for his 6-foot-4, nearly 300-pound frame. He is a decent pass rusher as well — a staple of defensive coordinator D.J. Durkin’s scheme.

“I think one of the things 
that’s been good with 
our team is our team has 
recognized that when we’ve 
been down a man or have 
been short some personnel, 
we’ve had some other guys 
step into some roles. And 
I tell our guys all the time, 
‘Whether you play 12 minutes

you doing with the amount of 
time or minutes that you’re

Orlando’s WFTV sports anchor Christian Bruey re-
ported Monday night via his Twitter account (@CBru-
eyWFTV) that freshman forward Chris Walker, who is 
awaiting an NCAA waiver to play, would be cleared 
following Florida’s matchup with Alabama on Thurs-day night. 
But on Tuesday, coach Billy Donovan said that there 
have not been any signs from the NCAA that would point to Walker’s debut coming any time soon.
“As it relates to Chris, just listen to us and our 
school,” Donovan said. 
“I’m not going to address it anymore. Certainly, 
we’re hopeful he gets back soon, but there’s been no 
indication that there’s any truth to that at all. Whenev-
er he gets cleared, and certainly we all hope it’s soon, believe me, I’m not going to throw a guy in a game and have him pop up and you guys not be aware of 
it. The minute he gets eligible, cleared and he’s able to 
play, I’ll let you know. 
“Anything else that’s out there about that is not 
true.”
Donovan added that he does not know all the de-
tails of the situation because the conversations are lim-ited to Walker, the NCAA and the UF administration.
“The only thing I’ve been trying to do with Chris is 
each and every day trying to help him get better as a 
player, provide the resources he needs academically,  
(and) try to work with him on the court to get better,” Donovan said.Florida still

Bridget Sloan’s 2013 campaign 
ended with the Southeastern Con-
ference Freshman Gymnast of the Year award. 
This year is shaping up to be 
just as good.
After Florida’s road win 
against Auburn on Friday, Sloan was named SEC Gymnast of the Week. 
“I really feel like I’m back,” 
Sloan said. “It shows how much hard work you put in obviously throughout the entire preseason, 
but then at the meet, you really let 
it shine. 
“At Auburn, I really did have 
just a great meet, and it was awe-some to have them look at how I did and award me for my accom-plishment.” 
Sloan improved her scores 
in all four events from Florida’s 
opening meet against UCLA to 
Auburn. Against the Tigers, she matched her collegiate best on vault with a 9.95. 
Coach Rhonda Faehn is happy 
with Sloan’s strong showing so far this season. 
“She’s had such tremendous 
success last year,” Faehn said. 
“But she’s trying to not only con-
tinue that success this year but to be such a great team leader and continue to push herself.”
Faehn said Sloan was not con-
tent with her entire performance despite her all-around win with a score of 39.70. Sloan’s 9.925 on the balance beam — her lowest score of the meet — was a point of ques-tion. Faehn said Sloan identified what she had been marked off for 
and immediately started thinking 
of how to correct it. 
“She just drilled it [Monday],” 
Faehn said. 
“That one area she kept going 
over and over on her own and it just shows me that she really has that inner drive to continue to get better.”
Faehn said she was for the most 
part happy with how her entire squad overcame the challenge  of the fast turnaround with only two practices between the UCLA and Auburn meets. 
“We only had one practice to 
vault and one practice to do floor, which is one area where we really 
needed to make some improve-
ments — especially from the UCLA competition,” Faehn said. “I was thrilled with the way we came out and performed at Auburn. Again, there were little mistakes here or there, but it didn’t effect the over-all result.”
UF has a little more time to set-
tle in and practice this week before the first home meet of the season against Georgia on Friday. 
“I know that our team feels 
they’ve gained some experience from the first two meets,” Faehn said. “They’re gaining more confi-
dence.”   
With falls in both of UF’s first 
meets, Faehn said there is no plan in place this early in the season  to 
prevent that from happening in 
the O’Connell Center on Friday. 
“We never sit there and say we can’t have any falls because they’re human and this is what the whole season is for, is to work the bugs out and to gain experience,” Faehn said. “Yeah it’s wonderful 
to be able to have everyone hit all 
the time, but that’s just not really reality.”

Bridget Sloan performs a flip on the balance beam during Florida’s win against Kentucky on Feb. 22, 2013, 
in the O’Connell Center. Sloan was named Southeastern Conference Gymnast of the Week on Tuesday.
Sophomore looks to build on decorated freshman season
Sloan named SEC Gymnast of the Week2014 class. UF needs depth at tackle 
after losing Dominique Easley to the 2014 NFL Draft and Damien Jacobs 
to graduation. 
Another four-star defensive 
tackle that will bolster the position 
is Khairi Clark, a Hollywood native. 
Clark represented the East in the U.S. 
Army All-American Bowl earlier this month where he recorded two tack-les. Clark took his official visit to Florida last weekend. He has been 
committed to UF since June 2013.
The No. 5 defensive end in the 
2014 class, Gerald Willis III, picked 
UF over his home school, LSU. Willis 
has impressive speed getting around 
the edge and could get reps early, as sophomore Jonathan Bullard and redshirt freshman Bryan Cox Jr. topped the depth chart at defensive end during the latter part of last sea-son. 
Adding even 
more depth to the 
defensive back corps for Florida 
is Duke Dawson. 
Dawson is another early enrollee who will benefit from getting a season of 
spring football under his belt. Dur-ing his senior season at Dixie County High, he registered 41 total tackles, including 29 solo tackles. 
A major UF target ranked in the 
Rivals 100 is five-star athlete Adoree’ Jackson. 
He is the No. 6 recruit in the na-tion, according to the website. Jack-son could end up signing a letter of intent with UF due to his interest in pursuing a track and field career 
while attending college. 
Jackson has narrowed down his 
choices to UF, UCLA and USC, ac-
cording to 247Sports.com. He plans 
to make an official visit to one of the 
three schools on Jan. 31.
UF’s defense has been one of the 
best in the SEC for the last two sea-sons. Despite finishing the 2013 sea-
son with a 4-8 record, the Gator de-
fense was among the top three teams in scoring, rushing, passing and total defense in the final SEC defensive 
statistics. 
With its current class, Florida is 
poised to rank highly again.WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 22, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Kurtz tripled points to tal
of Scottie Wilbekin and Dorian 
Finney-Smith and lingering injury problems,  Donovan has relied heavily on DeVon Walker and Jacob Kurtz to keep his team rel-
evant.
“Early in the year, clearly 
(Kurtz) was in the rotation where 
he was playing 18 to 22 minutes a game,” Donovan said. 
“We start to get some players 
back and some games he hasn’t played, some games in foul trou-ble he has stepped in. DeVon, we 
had the situation at Arkansas, (so) 
we started him in the game and he gave us some really good min-utes.”
Walker has gone from averag-ing less than one point and one rebound during his four minutes 
per game last year to averaging 3.2 
points and 1.9 rebounds in nearly 17 minutes per contest.
Kurtz has already nearly tri-
pled the total number of points he  scored during his first two years at Florida (14) in just 16 games this season (35). 
“You need to take and utilize 
what you have with the amount of minutes you’re playing and do the best job you can,” Donovan said. “So those guys have handled themselves very, very well, where in some games they don’t know how many minutes they’re going to play and they’ve been ready to play, which is the most important 
thing.”hoopS , from page 13� BEISEL WINS AWARD

Two members of the Flori-
da swimming and diving team 
were named the Southeastern Conference Swimmers of the Week on Tuesday. 
Senior Elizabeth Beisel 
notched her ninth career SEC 
Female Swimmer of the Week 
honor. In addition, junior Dan Wallace picked up his first SEC Male Swimmer of the Week award.
The awards come follow-
ing a second-place finish for 
the Gators and a strong per-
formance from Wallace at the Southern Methodist Universi-ty Invitational last weekend. 
Wallace won every indi-vidual event he was entered in and notched an NCAA “A” cut in the 400-yard individual 
medley after setting the meet 
and pool record in the event with a time of 3:42.11. It is the fourth fastest time in the country this season.
Beisel excelled against 
Florida Atlantic on Saturday, registering two top-10 times nationally in the 200-yard butterfly (1:56.60) and the 500-yard freestyle (4:37.04) on 
the way to a third straight du-
al-meet win for Florida. She missed the “A” cut qualifying time in the butterfly event by 0.11 seconds and by a nar-rower margin of 0.03 seconds in the freestyle.
With six national top-10 
times this season, Beisel could qualify for the top heats for all six events in the NCAA Championships in March.Two UF swimmers
