UF RESEARCH
S urvey su ggests, 'gay i s, OK'
By MORGAN WATKINS
Alligator Contributing Writer
A study by a UF professor shows veteran sup-
port for the "don't ask, don't tell" policy, which
restricts gay and lesbian citizens from military ser-
vice, has fallen sharply in recent years.
Only about 40 percent of Iraq and Afghanistan
war veterans supported "don't ask, don't tell" in
2006, compared to 75 percent of service members
in 1993 when the policy was introduced, according
to the study by Bonnie Moradi, an associate profes-
sor of psychology.
The study shows 28 percent disagreed with it
and 33 percent had no opinion or were unsure.
Moradi conducted the study with military so-
ciologist Laura Miller of the RAND Corp., a non-
profit research institution.
Moradi said in an e-mail that one of the most
important findings of the study was that knowing
a gay or lesbian member of a military unit did not
affect its cohesion.
Moradi said the study showed about 20 percentof the military personnel surveyed knew someone
gay or lesbian in their unit, and over half of those
service members said the presence of the gay or
lesbian member was well-known in their unit.
"When I was out on the field in Central America,
I served in combat zones where the last thing you
were going to do was worry about the sexuality of
your fellow soldier," said Paul
Ortiz, a UF history professor.
Ortiz, who served in Cen-
tral America as a member of the
U.S. Army in the 1980s, said the
growing number of veterans who
disagree with the nation's "don't
ask, don't tell" policy is indica-
Moradi tive of changing attitudes toward
gays and lesbians in the military.
"You have people who have done two tours
and won bronze stars and purple hearts, and then
their immediate superior finds out that they're gay
and they're discharged," he said.
Ortiz said the policy is especially problematic

student vaccines
0 SHCC WILL ADMINISTER
ABOUT 1,600 THURSDAY.
UF will conduct another mass
vaccination for the HINI flu vi-
rus Thursday after receiving a
shipment of 1,850 doses Monday
afternoon.
The free vaccines will be ad-
ministered to students at the Stu-
dent Health Care Center between
8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. To sign up
for a vaccination, students must
register at shcc.ufl.edu/h1n1/.
There will be 100 slots every
half hour, which means up to
1,600 students will be vaccinated
Thursday. The rest of the doses
will likely be given to the Health
Science Center for students and
health care professionals, said
Kat Lindsey, SHCC marketing
coordinator. UF also has about
100 doses left from the last vac-cination session.
Monday's shipment included
both the nasal mist and injectable
forms of the vaccine.
About 500 of the doses are
mist, Lindsey said.
Health care workers will be

form they
should re-
ceive, she said.
She said many people thinkthe
nasal form of the vaccine is more
dangerous, but SHCC workers
will try to dispel that rumor.
Because they expect a larger
number of students, Lindsey
said there will be one or two ex-
tra nurses on hand to administer
vaccines.

Monday appearance at UF.
Piven cited he had other

Atterman said Accent will

Satchel's owner passionate about pizza, art
By MICHAEL HERBERT
Alligator Contributing Writer ~-
Satch-el: a small, often cloth bag.
Or, an artist who owns a one-of-a-kind pizza
joint in Gainesville.
The second definition may only be useful to Ala-
chua County residents, but those who know it dine
in the product of a man's passion for art and pizza.
The beginning
Satchel Raye, 41, was born in Gainesville to de-
vout Southern Baptist UF alumni. Raised in Jack-
sonville, he spent much of his time in Gainesville,
visiting family and becoming a Gators fan.
When he was 16, Raye got a job at an Italian res-
taurant, Gubbio's, to save money for a car.
Bruno Santioni, an Italian immigrant whose fam-
ily ran the restaurant, became like a second father to
Raye, teaching him to spin pizzas and make dough.
Many of the recipes at Satchel's are based on what
he learned from Santioni.
Raye continued to work at Gubbio's until gradu-
ation, then he applied to one college, UF.
"One week after high school, I was living in
Gainesville, going to Summer A," he said.
But soon, Raye became unhappy at UF. Like
Jacksonville, he said, Gainesville was too big and
too crowded. He decided it was time for a break
and returned to Gubbio's to work as a server.
The world and travel
After giving art school a try, Raye returned to
UF to receive his art degree. Soon, he saved enough
money to travel in America, Europe and Asia.
In Thailand, Raye met a Buddhist monk and
went through a religious experience that challenged
his Christian roots. Raye said he learned much about
true love and devotion in Thailand.
When Raye returned to the states, he received a
phone call from a friend he met in France and was
invited to go to Jamaica for a short "vacation."
Raye stayed in slums with impoverished people,
far away from the tourist-attracting areas and mod-
em conveniences.
"We had to walk to get water," he said.
Upon his return, Raye decided to experience
homelessness himself.
"I was maybe 25 at the time, and I was homeless
by choice," he said. "It was probably the best three
months of my life."
He lived on lawns and in homeless shelters in
Atlanta. He met many Vietnam veterans and many

Satchel Raye, owner of Satchel's Pizza, has been adding on to the original shop since it opened in
2003. Lightnin' Salvage, the toy store attached at the back of the shop, is one of those additions.
alcoholics.
At the end of his homeless stint, Raye said
the generosity and camaraderie of the homeless
showed him that friends and passion -not money
and property -were the key to success.
Pizza and art
Raye moved to Gainesville and began working
for Leonardo's Pizza by the Slice in 1993 and con-
tinued there until 2001 -at one point, he lived on
the Leonardo's roof -and got in touch with art.
He met his wife, Caroline, when they both worked
there and married her in 1998.
In 2001, she gave birth to a son, and Raye quit
Leonardo's when his hours were cut.
He felt it was unfair for a long-time em-
ployee with a baby to have his income reduced.
After a year, he knew it was time to take a chance
and open up his own pizza shop.
"I was determined; I had to do it," he said.
"I just happened to catch [the previous owner]
at the right time," he said. "It was just luck."
On March 7,2003, Satchel's Pizza opened its doors.
\ doi1 M -Raye only expected it to be a small enterprise,
but the restaurant has become immensely popular.
"This place is like his canvas," said Danny Lore,
the night manager of Lightnin' Salvage, a trinket
shop located behind the dining room. "There's al-
ways a work in progress," he said.
Lore said he has never worked for anyone more
family-oriented than Raye, who works hard to
make the working environment at Satchel's as fam-
ily like as possible.
Raye puts money into retirement and health
funds for his employees and gives them paid va-
cation and benefits. He feels it's important to give
employees wages they can live on.
His devotion to his staff and customers has paid
off. The wait can be more than an hour on week-
ends, and the restaurant doesn't even offer bread-
sticks because there isn't room in the ovens for
them, Raye said.
"I like the sound of the dishes clanking in the
dishwasher," Raye said. "I like the people. I like the
food."

Group gives 'courage' awards
By MELINDA CARSTENSEN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Calm and powerful.
The words describe Rosa Parks, a black
woman who refused to give up her bus seat to
a white passenger in 1955, and they describe
locals who win the yearly Rosa Parks Quiet
Courage Committee award.
Each year, the committee honors local civil
rights activists with the Quiet Courage award,
which recognizes people who fight for justice
and equality by exhibiting the same kind of
courage that Rosa Parks exhibited.
"Usually, when you think of someone who
is courageous, you think of someone who is
loud," said Karen Cole-Smith, the committee's
second vice-chair. "But Rosa was not boister-
ous. She was quite, calm and powerful."
This year, the committee has chosen four
recipients for the Quiet Courage award: Cora
Roberts, of Gainesville, Carol Thomas, of Ala-
chua, Mary Hall Daniel, of Hillard, and UF
religion professor Gwendolyn Zoharah Sim-
mons, of Gainesville.
Simmons was 18 years old when she firstgot involved in the Civil Rights Movement. As
a teenager, she marched with Martin Luther
King Jr. and participated in nonviolent sit-ins
with SNCC, the Student Nonviolent Coordi-
nating Committee.
In 1964, Simmons organized a voting cam-
paign in Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia.
Currently, she is one of
the few people on campus
speaking out about the
wars in Iraq and Afghani-
stan, she said.
, "I'm still an activist
even though I went back- to school," Simmons said.
Parks "I'll never get that out of
my blood, being an activist
because we can bring about change. I saw it
with my own eyes."
All five award recipients will be honored
on Nov. 29 at 4 p.m. The memorial and award
program will take place at Compassion-
ate Outreach Ministries, 320 SE 43rd St., in
Gainesville.

solar tariff program
0 GAINESVILLE IS THE FIRST
US CITY OFFERING THE TARIFF.
By RENEE MONTALTO
Alligator Contributing Writer
Locals are jumping to become
part of the solar energy program that
earned Gainesville a national award
earlier this month.
Gainesville Regional Utilities re-
ceived national recognition for its
efforts with its Solar Feed-in Tariff
program, which allows residents to
produce their own solar energy and
sell it back to the company for about
a 5 percent profit, according to GRU
spokeswoman Melanie York.
When the award was announced,
local interest spiked, she said, adding
that the program is full until 2016.
According to York, Gainesville is
the first city to in the country to start
a program like the feed-in tariff.
Although the program is only
running in 19 commercial systems,including Santa Fe College, another
dozen or so will be constructed soon,
said Rachel Meek, a GRU employee
in the conservation department.
"Right now, we're helping to
stimulate solar energy. As the market
levels out, it becomes much more eco-
nomical for everyone," Meek said.
While Meek said GRU expected
this program to be a success, the com-
pany did not expect it to happen so
quickly.
Local Within a week, the
News 2009-2010 year was
filled up with compa-
nies that wanted solar energy in their
buildings.
"It happened very, very fast. It was
kind of crazy at that point in time. We
filled so many applications in such a
short amount of time," Meek said.
GRU was recognized by the Solar
Electric Power Association and won
the SEPA Award for Solar Business
Achievement in the area of Com-
munity Outreach and Public Aware-
ness.

Major teaches students to protect their turf
* ABOUT 15 TO 20 STUDENTS
ARE PURSUING THE MAJOR.
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Writer
Dew covered the ground and fog
hung over the Naples golf course.
Colby Paiva watched as deer ap-
peared and began to eat the grass.
After taking in the scene at his sum-
mer internship, Paiva realized he made
the right choice in pursuing a career in
golf and sports turf management rather
than attending nursing school.
"I won't see this at a hospital," Paiva
said.
Paiva, a UF senior, is one of about
15 to 20 students majoring in golf and
sports turf management, a four-year
program requiring 120 credit hours.
His love of the outdoors drove him to
change his career path, and Paiva hopes
to become a golf course superintendent.
Jason Kruse, an assistant professor
for the program at UF, said that, as a su-
perintendent, Paiva would manage the
entire landscape of a golf course.
Kruse said the major also prepares
students for careers as athletic field man-
agers and managers for residential and
commercial landscaping companies.
The major is part of a statewide pro-
gram, which means students can also
earn the degree from research centersD
ain Fort Lauderdale and Milton, Kruse
said.
Kruse said students in this interdis-
ciplinary program take classes in en-
tomology, environmental horticulture
and agribusiness along with turfgrass
culture classes -where students learn
how to grow and maintain turfgrass -
and management classes.
Students gain experience through
internships at golf courses or athletic
fields.
Kruse said they also help paint and
prepare Florida Field for football games
and maintain an on-campus golf green
known as the Envirogreen.
"Students that are successful in this
typically have a lot of pride in their
work," Kruse said.
Paiva said this feeling motivates him
to work long days and hours on the
course.
"And you have to have a lot of pride
in your work because, if you don't, it
will show," he said.
Paiva remembers the pride he felt
when a member came up to him during
his internship in Naples and compli-
mented the course's appearance.
"For me, it's kind of cool that I can
build something or take care of some-
thing that challenges people," Paiva
said.

major at alligator.org.r

small green on campus with the turf club and hopes to become a

Students sell holiday cheer
Aspiring student artists now have a
place to record their material and net-
work with other musicians thanks to a
new campus club.
The Independent Music Society,
which started at the beginning of the
fall semester, was originally created to
help students find a place to showcase
their talents in recording, producing,
singing or playing an instrument.
The newly formed club is working
to complete its first album, "Holidays
with IMS' and hopes to release it in the
first week of December.
The CD will feature 10 to 12 songs,
including "Baby Please Come Home,"
"Silent Night," and "The First Noel/Hava Nagila."
Davis Tiblier, the club's creator, said
the club plans to ask for a $1 donation

to find enough eligible citizens to serve in

When he served in the military, Ortiz
said he and his fellow soldiers knew they

"What you do on your own time is
what you do on your own time," he said.
Joseph Dellosa, president of UF Hu-

tudes within the military are promising.
Human Decency Now is a student or-
ganization promoting LGBT rights.
While he was pleased with most of the
study's findings, he said it was a little dis-
heartening to see that many still support
the policy.
Dellosa hopes it will be repealed soon,as public and military opinions seem to
support allowing gay and lesbian service
members to serve openly.

when we're telling an entire segment of
those who serve that they need to shut up
about who they are."

Editorial
No Telling When
Obama must follow
through on promise
recent study by UF professor Bonnie Morad, in coop-
eration with the RAND Corp., a nonprofit research in-
stitution, revealed that veteran support for the "don't
ask, don't tell" policy has fallen sharply since it was introduced
in 1993. By 2006, only about 40 percent of Iraq and Afghanistan
war veterans supported it -down from 75 percent in 1993.
This is an important signal to those seeking a reversal of the
policy, as the country clearly trends toward full acceptance of
openly gay service members. Yet there is still resistance; this
40 percent figure could represent roughly a million active and
reserve service members and overshadows the 28 percent who
explicitly disagree with the policy (while 33 percent have no
opinion or are unsure).
President Obama has shown little action on his campaign
promise to end "don't ask, don't tell," but he publicly renewed
his vow to end it last month, according to The New York
Times.
Just don't ask him to tell you when. The president offered
little in the way of a timetable during a speech before the Hu-
man Rights Campaign, the largest gay advocacy group seek-
ing a repeal of the policy.
Advocates also argue that Obama's promises of coopera-
tion with the Pentagon and with leaders in the House and Sen-
ate to repeal the policy still stand in contrast with 10 months
of limited action (or in most cases, inaction) on issues affecting
the gay community.
Yet Obama's passionate affirmation of the need for change,
accompanied by strong statements like "I will end 'don't ask,
don't tell,"' produced roars from the crowd.
And after months of anxious waiting, changes could be just
around the corner. Legislative initiatives are making headway,
as a bill was recently introduced in the House to repeal "don't
ask, don't tell," and a similar bill may soon be introduced by
Sen. Joe Lieberman in the Senate (can we count Lieberman as
bi-partisan support yet?).
According to CBS, the policy may be repealed as an amend-
ment to the 2011 Defense Department budget bill.
Rep. Barney Frank, the first openly gay congressman, sup-
ports this tactic, as he likens the effort to the hate crimes amend-
ments that extended protections to gay and lesbian people.
However Democratic policymakers choose to attack the is-
sue, they better act fast. Resentment among the party's liberal
base is growing as campaign promises go unmet, and a num-
ber of activists are pursuing a financial boycott of the Demo-
cratic National Committee, the Obama campaign and other
democratic organizations.
With waning military support for the policy, and with leg-
islative openings to repeal it approaching fast, we wonder:
Who cares if openly gay soldiers serve in the military? The
majority of the American people don't. Even a majority of self-
described conservatives support open service for gays in the
military, according to a 2008 Washington Post poll.
Non-partisan groups like the American Medical Associa-
tion have recognized the damaging effects the policy has on
gay service members and the Military. The AMA voted last
week to join efforts to repeal "don't ask, don't tell" because
of ethical dilemmas for gay service members and the doctors
who treat them, according to The Associated Press.
It's clearly time to repeal "don't ask, don't tell," and, in do-
ing so, recognize that it is rooted in the prejudice of a passed
era.

Column
For friends in need, love can ease pain
t's difficult when a friend tries to take his or her own life.
You try to look at them with kind, nonjudgmental
eyes, but you know that your face will betray you with a
panicked look of fear.
You try for a smile, shooting for somewhere between the
wide, insincere smile a portrait photographer relentlessly co-
erced out of you in seventh grade and the concerned smile
of a mother watching her kid play his first soccer game. It
doesn't work out like that. The former comes out, then the
latter, and then you decide that now isn't really the time for
smiling anyway.
You search for something with which to break the silence,
something that doesn't sound too consciously casual, but
not heavy-handed, either. Possibilities flicker through your
mind:
"How are you?" seems like kind of a dumb question.
"Are you all right?" sounds too medical and intrusive.
"So, what's new?" -oh God, how the hell did you even
let that one cross your mind?
Your friend must have seen the look on your face and
breaks the silence for you with a "hello," followed by a
hushed "thank you for visiting." You quickly say that it's no
problem and sit down beside them, groping for anything re-
sembling a coherent sentence.
You want to ask why, because you just don't understand
any of this. All the clich6s that you castigated your mutual
friends for trotting out. "I would have never guessed" and,
"Last person in the world I would've thought" are just a
breath away from escaping from your own mouth.
And you instantly hate yourself for it, but for a brief mo-
ment, you mentally entertain the most self-centered line of
questioning: Didn't you know how much this would hurt
us? Why weren't we worth living for?
Instead, you settle for a simple, "Do you want to talk?" A
head shake.
"Do you want me to stay?" A nod.
"Hold your hand?" Their hand inches over to yours, andyou take it.
You pause, and sort of blurt out, "I
love you."
You say it again -this time, with-
out your voice cracking and with each
of the three words getting its own syl-
Joe Dellosa lables -and add, "I'm here for you,
letters@alligator org okay? Just let me know if you want to
talk, and I'll listen."
Your friend smiles wanly and
thanks you in a way that lets you know that they'll take you
up on your offer sooner rather than later, but for now, they'd
really just rather take in the quiet.
You know that, within the hour, you'll be in a mostly one-
sided conversation that will shatter your heart in such a way
that you'll occasionally forget how to breathe. You know
that you'll do your best, with varying degrees of success, to
appear calm and collected. You hope that, when your face
makes your broken heart far too evident, it'll read more as
an earnest, desperate compassion and not as being in way
over your head.
And you know that saying "I love you" is not a panacea
that makes everything better, as if it were a magical phrase
that will make your friend comically slap their forehead and
say, "Really? Well, shit, I guess I'm fixed!"
But you say it anyway -in part because, at least for this
moment, it's all you've got. But mostly you say it because it's
true, and maybe a little selfishly, you're saying it as much for
yourself as you're saying it for them -as if saying it now,
urgently, could retroactively make up for all the times you
said it ironically or in a half-assed way these past years.
You don't understand. But you want to try.
You gently tighten your grip on their hand and whisper
it quietly but fiercely.
"I love you. You're loved, and I love you."

Letters to the Editor
Station to increase student staff
This is in response to Frank Bracco's
Nov. 10 letter "WUFT-FM should re-
think change in format."
Inhis letter, Bracco claims that "more
students were cut than added" with the
restructuring of the UF College of Jour-
nalism and Communications-operated
stations. In fact, the number of students
working at the stations is up nearly 25
percent over the previous year. We're
creating numerous new volunteer and
academic opportunities for all the stu-
dents in the college and plan to con-
tinue expanding this vital aspect of
our operation. More than 300 students
attended the stations' first open house
earlier this semester.
Bracco suggests some student talk
shows air on WUFT-FM. In fact, we're
laying plans for a 7 p.m. weekday,
student-produced, live news program.
We're adding weekend and nighttime
news programs, and we're submitting
a grant request to fund a daily Spanish-
language, student-produced broadcast.
Bracco accurately notes some re-
traction in membership pledges can be
expected due to the recession. How-
ever, he neglects to consider the time
required to transition to an expanded,
enriched format. Our current and new
audience will replace and increase pre-
vious contributions in coming pledge
drives.
The multimedia properties play a
major role in fulfilling the educational
mission of the College of Journalism
and Communications. Our news and
public affairs programs embrace that
mandate. Our commitment is unwav-
ering.

Meyer, Spurrier can't be compared
I wanted to thank Mike McCall for
his article in Monday's paper, "Meyer,
Spurrier not to be compared," which
was about comparing the "Old Ball
Coach" to Urban Meyer. It is like com-
paring apples to oranges.
I have been a Gators fan since theday I was born and I can remember the
Steve Spurrier era as well as the not-so-
pretty Ron Zook years. Spurrier will al-
ways be my favorite, but it is hard to not
love a man who has won two national
championships in such little time.
I think a lot of the disagreements
come between those who were Gators
fans since birth and those who casually
joined the Gator Nation once they were
accepted to their "back-up school."
Those who were not Gators fans be-
fore their acceptance letters arrived will
never truly be able to appreciate what
Steve Spurrier did for our football pro-
gram; at the same time coach Meyer has
made it "Great to be a Florida Gator"
once again.

T-shirts do not degrade women
This is in response to Desi Krell's
letter to the editor on Friday, "T-shirt
displays offensive messages." As a
supporter of feminist causes, I'm a lit-
tle more than embarrassed to see that
you've chosen an establishment that
is so non-threatening toward women
to attack and boycott. The T-shirt in
question shows a woman wearing un-
derwear, which you failed to mention,
implying that she was nude. You also
completely ignore the fact that the shirt
is mocking tentacle porn, which was
created in Japan.
You somehow throw rape into the
equation as well. There is nothing on
this shirt that insinuates a non-consen-
sual act. And I find it interesting that
you chose this particular shirt to at-
tack.
Another Laboratory T-shirt reads
"Brain like a horse, Hung like Einstein."
Why, Krell, didn't you get worked up
about the objectification of men on the
grounds that this shirt makes fun of
their less than favorable endowment?
There are so many better things
to attack and speak out against in the
name of protecting women from deg-
radation -Hooters, for instance, or
the Japanese adult industry in general.
It's important that feminists choose en-
emies wisely. The Laboratory is hardly
a target.

Guest column
Trials give terrorists better
treatment than they deserve
his is in response to Matthew Christ'sMonday column, "US should give
terrorists civilian trials."
In a supposed victory for American jus-
tice, President Obama has chosen to give
public criminal trials to a select group of
foreign terrorists.
Let's look for a moment at what these
trials really mean for America.
To start, these foreign terrorists will
enjoy the forum these trials will provide
them. Ultimately, it may be them on trial,
but it is their wretched beliefs that will
get all the press. Khalid Sheikh Moham-
med will be there for planning the Sept.
11 attacks and for beheading American
journalist Daniel Pearl. In return for his
crimes, he will get a forum that most ter-
rorists could only dream of. His messages
of hate will reach far and wide thanks to
the millions of dollars spent on these un-
fair trials.
But they won't be unfair to these for-
eign terrorists. President Obama will en-
sure that millions of American dollars
go to ensure that these trials are legally
sound. These murderers will be given
their choice of star representation all in a
vain attempt to show our nation's moral
superiority by singling out a few people
for special treatment.
This moral superiority comes at the cost
of fair treatment for American citizens.
More than 2 million Americans languish
behind bars in our country's fast-growing
jails and prisons. Scores of Americans sit
on death row after being represented by
public defenders. All too frequently, they
are poorly trained, poorly qualified and
underpaid. Innocent Americans are given
the death penalty or forced to waste away
in prison because of the imperfections of a
system chronically short of everything it
needs to function properly.
And yet, as Americans are denied
justice, these foreign terrorists are given
everything they could possibly want or
need. Imagine if all of the millions of dol-
lars that will be spent on the security and
the legal proceedings for these savages
were instead spent on investigating theWarren Rhea cases of Americans
Speaking Out behind bars. How
many lives might be
saved? How many
families reunited? How many people
might experience real justice?
We'll never know. These trials will take
critical funding and attention away from
our over-burdened justice system.
Chances are that all of the alleged ter-
rorists will be convicted and probably
given the death penalty. Anything less
would be politically unacceptable.
Because ultimately, politics is what
these trials are about. President Obama
has chosen a few foreign terrorists for spe-
cial criminal trials so that he can use our
justice system to prove once again that he
is not George W. Bush.
With unemployment rates rising even
faster than his approval numbers are fall-
ing, the fact that our 44th president is
different from our 43rd is really the only
thing the man has left.
Of course, that doesn't make these tri-
als right. The truth is that these foreign
terrorists have been nothing but a head-
ache ever since their capture. Most have
provided very little useful information
and have been nothing but an expensive
embarrassment and a rallying cause for
America's enemies.
Instead of being imprisoned, they
should have been killed on the battle-
fields where they were captured. At least
this would have been clear, legal and jus-
tified.
But instead we've locked them up for
10 years, and we'll have them on trial and
death row for at least another 10. And then
we're going to execute them anyway.
And all the while, we will have accom-
plished nothing, at the cost of many mil-
lions of dollars, along with any real justice
for the American people.
The war on terror is not an internation-
al police action. It's not a legal exercise.
And it's not a feel-good means for scoring
political points. It's a war. Let's start treat-
ing it like one.

poses tough test
0 THE GATORS HOST THE NO. 15 SEMINOLES
TONIGHT AT 7.
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Staff Writer
etorrens@alligator org
Coach Amanda Butler has the utmost respect for
FSU's inside game.
But it's not something she's trying to mimic for the
UF women's basketball team (1-0) when it hosts the
No. 15 Seminoles tonight at 7 in the O'Connell Center.
Butler praised FSU's post players Jacinta Monroe
-a 6-foot-5 preseason All-Atlantic Coast Conference
first-team selection -and 6-foot-4 Cierra Bravard but
said she's not necessarily using them as a blueprint for
what the Gators' post game should look like.
Monroe scored 18 points in 34 minutes in UF's 72-57
win in Tallahassee last year.
"As talented as Jacinta and Cierra are, we don't re-
ally have any players that look like them or play like
them or their games are like them," Butler said. "Cer-
tainly we talk about the challenges that what they're
able to do pose for us, but we also have to talk about
the things we do well and the challenges that poses for
FSU."
To combat a Seminoles defense that allowed just 10
first-half points to UNF on Saturday, the Gators may
go with a smaller and quicker lineup -as opposed to
trying to out-physical their opponent -and rely on
perimeter shooting.
In its 85-63 season-opening win against Stetson,
UF freshman Jennifer George showed flashes of being
a force to be reckoned with in the paint, leading the
team with 21 points and adding five rebounds and two
steals.
The Seminoles (1-0) should prove to be a tougher
test for George than the Hatters, and the challenge

His unit responded by al-
lowing the Gamecocks to gain
just 41 yards of offense in the
second half.
Senior linebacker Ryan
Stamper also heard Strong's
message loud and clear.
"(He was) just letting us
know we're not playing the way
the Florida defense is suppose
to be played," Stamper said.
"We've got to come out and
play the second half better or
our season is over. We're going
to the SEC Championship, but
we've got other goals after that,
too, so if we lost this game that
wouldn't have happened."
There are only two possible
goals Stamper could have been
alluding to: winning a national
championship or going unde-
feated.
No other goal would have
been ruined by Florida losing
that game on Saturday.

WHOOPS, from page 13
will be taking Saturday's perfor-
mance and building off it against
the much more physically gifted
FSU frontcourt.
The team will be relying on
its ability to generate offense off
turnovers, as Florida recorded 14
steals against the Hatters.
And while UF finished Satur-
day shooting 50 percent from the
field, the team will be looking to
play even more to its shooting
strengths.
"We didn't even shoot that
well against Stetson, so I feel sor-
ry for Florida State (tonight) be-
cause I'm pretty sure we'll be on
fire," center Azania Stewart said.
Stewart played against Mon-
roe in Belgrade, Serbia, at the
2009 World University Games
and said it's more exciting for herto play against high-quality post
players like Monroe.
Stewart will also be fueled by
the motivation of what was in
her eyes a subpar performance
against Stetson.
"To be honest, it wasn't a good
I game," Stewart
said. "I can't
dwell on that. I
have experienceWomen's here. I'm only a
Basketball sophomore, but
I played well
against them last year."
Last season, in the Gators'road
win in Tallahassee, Stewart tal-
lied six points and four rebounds
in 12 minutes of action.
She has advised George to es-
tablish her presence early and not
let herself get caught playing de-
fense too close to the hoop.
The team can say goodbye tofirst-game jitters, but the intra-
state rivalry will certainly field
a different atmosphere than the
season opener.
"It's the biggest game so far,
so there's a different nervous-
ness that comes with that," guard
Susan Yenser said. "We are just
going to go out there and focus
on executing what we want to do
instead of catering to what they
want to do."
Florida will hope to repeat its
success of a year ago.
The then-unranked Gators de-
feated a ranked Seminoles squad,
but the biggest contribution
came from now-departed guard
Sha Brooks, who led UF with 24
points in last season's upset.
Senior forward Sharielle
Smith had the team's second-
highest output last year, scoring
15 points on 5-of-7 shooting.

Meyer still confident in Sturgis
jj~j09
Harrison Diamond/ Alligator Staff
UF quarterback Tim Tebow (left) consoles kicker Caleb
Sturgis after one of Sturgis' three misses Saturday.By PHIL KEGLER
Alligator Staff Writer
pkegler@alligator org
It has been quite an up-and-down
season for Florida kicker Caleb Stur-
gis.
The sophomore won the job from
Jonathan Phillips entering the Tennes-
see game and proceeded to make his
first six field goals.
Since then, he has made only 12 of
18 attempts, although that includes a
51-yarder and a 27-yard game winner
against Arkansas as well as a 56-yard-
er against Georgia.
The Lou Groza Award semifinalist
had his worst game of the season Sat-
urday against South Carolina, making
only one of his four attempts, although
two of his misses were from beyond
50 yards.
Coach Urban Meyer said Monday
he would continue to have confidence
in Sturgis' length, although he would
continue to monitor the kicking game
on a week-to-week basis, with the red-
shirt senior Phillips still a possible op-
tion.
Meyer said Sturgis watched video
of his misses Sunday and would con-
tinue to this week.
"Every kick's looking different,"
Meyer said. "I'm going to let Jon havesome opportunities.
"Caleb's better than that. He's
pressing right now. We've just gotta
get him through it."
Phillips missed a 42-yarder against
Alabama in last year's Southeastern
Conference Championship game. It
was his only attempt in 2008 of longer
than 40 yards. This year, Sturgis has
kicked six.
"It's all follow-through. It's not
leg strength. It's not
focus," Meyer said.
IL .I"He's pressing right
now I equate it to a
golfer -when that
guy takes a swing~V and pops his head
up to see where the
Sturgis ball goes -(Sturgis)
is doing that right
now. He's jumping up rather than fol-
lowing through."
NO CRITICISM HERE: Meyer is a longtime
friend of New England Patriots coach
Bill Belichick and was asked Monday
about Belichick's much-criticized deci-
sion to go for it on fourth down late in a
35-34 loss to the Indianapolis Colts.
Leading by six, the Patriots faced
fourth and 2 at their own 28-yard line
with 2:08 remaining in the game.
"First of all, I fell asleep at half-time," Meyer said. "Second of all,
there's no one more qualified in this
world to make that decision than Bill
Belichick.
"I'm a big Belichick fan. He made a
call to go win the game, and he's done
that many times in his career. .He'd
do it again, probably next week, if he
had to."
INJURY UPDATE: Running back Emman-
uel Moody (ankle sprain) was in a boot
after Saturday's game and is doubt-
ful for the Florida International game.
Defensive tackle Terron Sanders (rib)
is expected to recover soon, although
Meyer did not know his status for this
week's game.
GATORS GET RECOGNIZED: Junior cor-
nerback Joe Haden was named SEC De-
fensive Player of the Week after lead-
ing his team with 11 tackles in Florida's
24-14 win over South Carolina. Haden
also had two forced fumbles, a sack
and a pass breakup.
Junior Aaron Hernandez was
named one of eight semifinalists for
the John Mackey Award, given to the
nation's top tight end, on Monday.
Hernandez ranks first among SEC
tight ends in receptions and receiv-
ing yards. The three finalists will be
named Monday.

KYLE, from page 13
wrong with looking ahead to focus your team on
the task at hand?
Everyone assumes looking down the road will
result in an upset because Florida won't be focused
enough on the mighty FIU Panthers.
The chance to make history is a vastly superior
motivating factor to beating FIU or FSU.
"We're just trying to get to Atlanta."
I can't possibly tell you how many times mem-
bers of the Florida football team have uttered those
words to the media from the beginning of fall prac-
tice through the first half of the schedule.
A few players came clean before the season start-
ed, saying the Gators had hopes of going undefeat-
ed on their way to another national title, but coach
Urban Meyer quickly put the kibosh on that.
From then on, the players were only to say their
goal for the season was to get to Atlanta and another
SEC Championship Game.
I personally don't believe that was ever true, but
even if it was, those goals have clearly changed. It
would be stupid not to adjust long-term goals oncethey have already been accomplished.
But what is it now?
Pasadena.
And it should be.
Just as the team used Atlanta as a long-term goal
to get them through the conference slate, the mo-
tivation of a third national championship in four
years will be used to take the Gators down the home
stretch and to "The Promised Land," as sophomore
safety Will Hill put it Sunday.
Meyer and his coaching staff would never admit
that they're using that Crystal Ball as a motivating
tool, but a couple of his players have already made
it apparent -that is exactly what's happening.
It's nice to pump out cliches about taking it "one
game at a time," but even Meyer revealed his mind-
set after Saturday's game.
"I'm so tired of seeing balls come off finger-
tips," Meyer said of two would-be touchdowns that
grazed off of wide receiver Riley Cooper's hands.
"We all know what's coming down the road, and
we have to make those."
I don't think he was talking about the Panthers
or the Seminoles.
