UF is on its way to establishing a new 
major.
Pending approval from the Board of 
Trustees, an African-American studies ma-
jor will start in Fall 2013. It was approved 
by UF’s Faculty Senate on Thursday.The African-American Studies Program 
began its efforts to implement an African-American studies major in 2010. The pro-gram will celebrate its 45th anniversary in the Fall, said Sharon D. Wright Austin, di-rector of the program.
She said this is the perfect time to have 
the major established because it would co-incide with the program’s anniversary.Establishing the major will cost the uni-
versity nothing. The classes necessary for the major are present at UF under the mi-nor, she said.
The major would include classes in 
politics, philosophy, history and religion. Students would need 120 credit hours, in-cluding the 30 hours of African-American 
studies courses required. Students would 
also need to complete a research methods requirement and 15 credit hours of Afri-can-American studies courses at the 3000 level or higher. Austin said the faculty and students 
involved with the program feel that only having an African-American studies minor at the university is insufﬁ  cient.
“We’ll be able to use the major not only 
to educate students but to do more things to educate the broader community in Gainesville,” she said.
There is a great demand from students 
for the major, Austin said. Students wrote letters to the university, which were in-Kelly Logan / Alligator Staff

Tim Tebow announced Thursday 
he will cancel his appearance at a 
Texas church this spring.
The former Gator and current 
New York Jets quarterback was 
scheduled to appear for the opening 
of a new $130 million campus for the First Baptist Church of Dallas on April 28.
However, Tebow’s planned visit 
sparked public outcry that centered on the church’s pastor, the Rev. Rob-ert Jeffress, and his views on homo-sexuality, AIDS and Judaism.Tebow made 
the announcement on his Facebook and Twitter pages 
to fans, saying 
he canceled the 
speaking arrange-ment “due to new information that has been brought 
to my attention.”
The church also released a state-
ment Thursday about Tebow’s deci-sion, saying Jeffress was disappoint-ed the quarterback was no longer 
speaking there. 
”Mr. Tebow called Dr. Jeffress Wednesday evening saying that for 
personal and professional reasons he needed to avoid controversy at this time, but would like to come to First 
Baptist Dallas to speak at a future 
date,” the statement said.
The statement also defended Jef-
fress, saying his comments and views have been “grossly misrepresented” by the media.
Since the initial announcement of 
Tebow’s visit Sunday , his supporters have been vocal about the speaking engagement.

UF’s Board of Trustees is about to have two Davids.
Florida’s Board of Governors appointed UF alumnus 
David Thomas to join chair C. David Brown II and the oth-
ers on the university’s Board of Trustees on Thursday.
Thomas will serve a ﬁ  ve-year term. He replaces Al 
Warrington IV, the namesake of the business college who 
was appointed in 2001, said UF President Bernie Machen 
at Thursday’s Faculty Senate meeting.
“I’ve never met an individual who has dedicated his 
professional life to his home institution,” Machen said at 
the meeting. “We will miss Al.”
The new trustee graduated from UF with a bachelor’s 
degree in industrial engineering in 1971 and a master’s in engineering a year later, according to a press release. Thomas, former senior vice president at IBM, is currently on the Gator Boosters’ board of directors.
“David Thomas brings to the board a proven record 
of leadership at multibillion-dollar corporations,” Brown said in the release.
Thomas lives in Windermere, Fla., and is married to a 
Gator alumna named Carol, according to the release. His 
children attended UF graduate programs.
“We’re quite pleased with that appointment,” Machen 
said at the meeting. “I think he will be a great trustee.”
The next Board of Trustees meeting is scheduled for 
March 21 and 22, according to its website.

◗ WOMEN WERE MORE EMOTIONAL.
KAITLYN PEARSON
Alligator Contributing Writer
Women and men tweet in different ways, 
and it might not be inherent. A recent study 
analyzed the different ways men and women are learning to communicate with each other on Twitter.
“Men and women tend to communicate 
differently in real life,” said Bruce Floyd, UF’s social media specialist. “I’m not surprised that there are gender differences [on Twitter].”
Although age, race and class factor into 
the way people tweet, researchers took a non-gender stance. The study found even though a number of sex-specific stylistic trends impact 
the way people tweet, these patterns aren’t 
true for everyone.
It concluded both genders use language 
that’s more typical of the “opposite sex.” Us-ers’ tweets are more likely to sound like their sex if they have a substantial amount of fol-lowers of the same sex.
Diana Boxer, a professor in UF’s Depart-ment of Linguistics, said women often show their emotions.
The study found females use more emoti-
cons and emotion-related terms, a conclusion with which UF journalism senior Danielle Bo-nilla agreed.
“I do see females using more of the faces,” 
the 21-year-old said.Conversely , male Twitter users had fewer 
attachments to certain forms of expression, us-ing “affirmations like yeah and yea” more of-ten than female users, according to the study . 
Boxer said women generally use language 
to build relationships, and men use it to ac-count for things.
According to the study , swearing is most 
often associated with male Twitter users. 
Floyd said he can tell when he is tweeting to 
a male or female based on the conversation.
“That’s just intuition — not scientific,” he 
said.Men and women have different Twitter habits, study says

Meet TED, a different format for 
conversation. It’s a collection of in-
novative minds ready to inspire peo-ple to pursue their greatest passions, and it’s coming to Gainesville.
TEDxUF, an independent organi-
zation, returns to the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts on Saturday for its fourth annual conference. This year’s theme is “Pursuing Passion.”
Devoted to “ideas worth spread-
ing,” the nonprofit organization, which stands for Technology, En-tertainment and Design, values in-novation and profession across sci-
ence, art and technology.
“We’re blurring the line of what 
a TED conference is and what a 
TEDxUF event can be,” said Stefan Wolff, curator of 
this year’s event.
Wolff and the 
TED Club at UF intend to “shake the ground be-neath our feet at the Phillips Cen-ter.”
The audito-
rium seats about 2,000, and the stu-dio theater next to it holds about 150 seats, which will be on a first-come, 
first-served basis. More than 2,000 
people have already applied for the main auditorium.
The event is free and open to the 
public. The wait list opens at 9:30 a.m., and the studio theater and ex-hibits open at 10 a.m.
Gainesville-based agency Paris-
leaf’s CEO Chad Paris said it has been one of the hardest yet most re-warding experiences.
“TEDTalks are more like infor -
mational talks meant to motivate,” he said.
Wolff encouraged attendees to 
bring an open mind and a smart-
phone to access the TEDxUF app.
“Passion is dynamic, fluid and 
changes all the time,” Wolff said. 
“There is no one right answer.”
TEDxUF hopes to motivate, inspire more than 2,000 this weekend“I do see females using more of 
the faces.”

Gainesville Police Officer Mi-
chael Preston only knew the wom-
an’s name, but that didn’t stop him from saving her life.
Preston, a 23-year GPD veteran, 
learned that a young woman was considering suicide when her out-of-state counselor notified police Dec. 9.
He found her cellphone number 
in a police file and called her. He didn’t identify himself as an officer but as a friend who wanted to take care of her dog. She agreed to meet 
with him.
Later, Preston found the woman 
sitting in her car with her dog at her 
side as well as a pack of razor blades.   They talked, and she opened up to him about how she felt like a burden to her family.
“I told her it’s even more of a 
burden for them to take care of her 
death,” Preston said.
That’s when she decided to not 
kill herself.
On Thursday night, Preston was 
honored along with about 75 uni-
formed officers and civilians for he-roic acts during GPD’s semi-annual award ceremony at Springhill Mis-sionary Baptist Church.
Officer Brian Duelz received an 
award for caring for a person whose leg was severed in a Jan. 13 crash on U.S. Highway 441. Duelz took the 
person as well as the leg to Shands 
at UF for emergency treatment.
The ceremony honored 13 vol-
unteers for their involvement in the search for Christian Aguilar last fall.
Christian’s father, Carlos Agui-
lar, attended the ceremony and embraced the volunteers for their involvement. 
“When they work together, the 
results are superior,” he said. “They can save lives together.”
Gainesville Police Chief Tony 
Jones said citizens, like those in the ceremony, are necessary for keeping the city safe. He mentioned a recent instance when GPD intervened in a sexual battery case after a citizen 
tipped off the department.
“He was just a citizen saying, 
‘Something is wrong,’ and calling 
in,’” Jones said. “The only way to manage crime is together.”

Students who don’t take a second look be-
fore a spoonful of cereal might have a sharp 
bite.
Last week, Kellogg Co. recalled about 
36,000 boxes of its Special K Red Berries ce-
real.
Kris Charles, the company’s spokesman, said Kellogg recalled the products because of the possible presence of glass fragments.
No injuries have been reported, he said.
The recalled cereals are the 11.2-ounce retail 
package with a “Better if Used by” stamp from Dec. 2, the 37-ounce club store package with a stamp from Dec. 30 and the 22.4-ounce twin pack with a stamp from Nov. 30.
In October, Kellogg pulled 2.8 million boxes 
of its Mini-Wheats off the shelves after metal mesh fragments were found in the boxes.
UF food science and human nutrition assis-
tant professor Soohyoun Ahn, whose exper -
tise is in food safety , said she was surprised by the recall. She said the glass fragments are a physical hazard and are far less common than a chemical hazard like bacteria.
Ahn explained big companies like Kellogg 
have machines that can detect when metal pieces or packaging materials are in the food. She said consumers shouldn’t be too con-cerned because of the size of the recall.
“Considering how many products are pro-
duced, it’s a rather small recall,” she said.Ahn believed the machinery might have 
malfunctioned and did not detect the glass. She also suspected the glass could have bro-ken off from a machine.
Health science freshman Emily Parker, 
18, whose favorite cereal is Kellogg’s Special K Red Berries, said she was surprised to hear 
about the recall. But she isn’t concerned. In fact, 
Parker said she would still buy the cereal.
“It’s a big deal that it’s glass, but accidents 
happen,” she said. “It’s not like it’s going to be in every cereal package.”

After an almost six-month inves-
tigation, the Alachua County Sher -
iff’s Office arrested a Gainesville man 
Wednesday morning accused of pos-sessing child pornography on his com-
puter.
Deputies charged Jeremy Michael 
Davis, 37, of 1000 SW 62nd Blvd., with 
obscene material possession and ob-scene material distribution, which are both third-degree felonies, according to an ASO arrest report.
The investigation started at the end 
of August after ASO received a tip 
about Davis’ alleged activity, said ASO 
spokesman Art Forgey.
Deputies obtained a search warrant 
after a detective downloaded child pornography from a source using Da-vis’ Internet, according to the report.During a search of Davis’ house 
at about 7 a.m. Wednesday, deputies 
briefly looked through Davis’ com-
puter, and found pictures and videos of children performing sexual acts, ac-cording to the report.
Davis’ described himself to depu-
ties as a “boy lover” and said he’s been using peer-to-peer software for more than a year to download and share the pornographic items, according to the 
report.
Davis added that he searched for 
the videos using terms such as “bib-
cam,” “boys in underwear” and “boys in bedroom,” according to the report.
After Davis’ arrest, deputies 
booked him into the Alachua County Jail at about 11 a.m. Wednesday , where he remained Thursday night with a 
$200,000 bond.

� THE PROGRAM IS THE 
FIRST OF ITS KIND.

When students got their ad-
mission notification from UF on 
Feb. 8, 150 of them got an unex-pected message.
UF’s College of Engineering 
admitted its inaugural class to the Gator Engineering at Santa Fe College program.
The program, with repre-
sentatives who hope to have 50 students accept their invitation, is the first of its kind, said An-gela Lindner, UF’s College of Engineering associate dean for 
student affairs.
For the first three semesters 
of their college career, students 
will spend their time taking classes at SFC. After their first semester, as long as certain tracking and GPA requirements are met, students will be consid-ered UF students. After the first 
three semesters, students will be on UF’s campus full time.
“This is a program that will 
allow the college to graduate 
more engineering students,” Lindner said. “Particularly ma-jors that have capacity in the upper-division, as well as ma-
jors that have a demand in the 
workplace.”
Lindner said electrical en-
gineering, computer science, computer engineering, and digital arts and sciences are the majors being offered through the program.
She hopes it will be able to 
offer more majors in the future and increase the amount of stu-dents who participate.
One of the biggest issues 
was the reactions of students once they saw the message, Lindner said.
“These students are highly 
admissible, very talented and very well rounded,” she said. “The students’ first response is that they were not accepted as freshmen, and we can under -
stand that.”
Mary Vasilevsky, an envi-
ronmental engineering fresh-man, said she can see why stu-
dents would feel that way.
“At first, it seems like it 
could take a shot at your pride,” 
the 18-year-old said. “But after you think about it, it’s really an excellent opportunity.”
Vasilevsky said it’s a great 
opportunity for students to ben-efit from more individual atten-
tion and smaller class sizes.
Lindner said a goal of the 
program is to help with the 
overpopulation in the fresh-man- and sophomore-level classes, especially the core chemistry and physics classes.
“I’m excited for this unique 
freshmen class with their own 
unique identifier,” she said.UF engineers could start at SFC
“This is a program 
that will allow the 
college to graduate more 
engineering students.”

TV after the Puppy Bowl a few weeks ago. According to a New York Times report, “Advertisers are paying ABC the highest 
prices since 2008 for commercials during the network’s cover-

The Swamp Party’s corruption, Part I
Last night, the Swamp Party took the available UF 
Student Government seats by storm. 
I’ve been a student at UF for almost four years, 
and I’m beginning to notice something: the majority party is utterly corrupt.
I will attempt to convince you of this.Let me ﬁ  rst address the issue of the name of the major-
ity party.
Before the Swamp Party was called the Swamp Party, it 
was called the Unite Party. That was only a year ago. 
Before the Unite Party was known by that name, it was 
called the Gator Party.
Before the Gator Party was called that name, it was 
called the Swamp Party. 
And so, the cycle continues, the beast changing names 
every few years. The old parties are forgotten and disap-pear suddenly, without a trace. The new party emerges with similar leadership, similar tactics, and with similar fraternities and sororities supporting these parties.
The biggest change is merely the branding.Now I’ll address the peculiar pattern I’ve noticed in the 
majority’s executive slate.
The formula I’ve noticed is a white Student Body presi-
dent is usually selected to run, followed by a black, His-panic or Asian vice president and treasurer.
I don’t think I’m the only one to have noticed this. 
Maybe you’ve noticed it, too.
Last year, we had our ﬁ  rst Asian-American SG presi-
dent, Anthony Reynolds, but the only reason he was pres-ident at all is the originally selected white president, Ben Meyers, stepped down for “personal reasons.” 
So, there are exceptions to the rule, but I don’t think 
one should conclude that there’s no general pattern. 
I have even heard those who show the most support to 
the majority party are the white fraternities and sororities, and many of the SG positions then end up going to people in those fraternities and sororities.
This may seem like a silly qualm to some. If they sup-
ported Swamp more, then they should get more seats in SG, right?Wrong.Why should someone’s mem-
bership in a club be the deter-mining factor when it comes to whether they’ll do what’s right 
for the students as a whole? I 
think this system of selecting candidates, the patronage sys-tem, ﬁ  ts the designation of “cor-rupt” quite well. 
If that isn’t enough to con-
vince you there’s corruption in the majority party, here’s more.
Three years ago, the minority party played a record-
ing in the Senate chambers which showed the Greek or-ganizations were, in fact, trying to force their members to vote, issuing penalties if members did not come back to the clubhouse with an “I Voted” sticker. 
One sorority even gave alcohol to those who did return 
with an “I Voted” sticker.
Some students may not know this, but the SG boasts a 
budget of over $17.5 million. 
This budget is later handled by a Student Senate com-
mittee which appropriates the money.
The minority party from a few years ago calculated 
that SG wasted $150,000 of student money in that year, according to the Fine Print. 
I wonder how much is being wasted this year.“The University of Florida’s Student Government has 
one of the largest Student Government budgets in the na-tion!” is what the SG website says.
Make no mistake in being optimistic: They are probably 
wasting our money, and they’re actually happy about it.
Next week, I will write about why the Swamp Party is 
dangerous to anyone in SG who has an opposing point of view and why the minority groups should stay far away from the Swamp Party.

Sports fans need a name change.
In late January, the National Basketball As-
sociation team in New Orleans announced a 
name change from Hornets to Pelicans. 
I’m a fan of the change because Pelicans are 
scary birds.
Sports fans, though? We also need to change our 
collective name to a bird. 
I’m thinking instead of fans, we can call our-
selves ostriches after the notion of burying our 
heads in the sand.
In the ﬁ  rst week of February, Europol announced 
it suspected nearly 700 soccer matches were pos-sibly ﬁ  xed in “recent years” to facilitate betting schemes. 
I’ve seen but three pieces concerned over such 
a scandal: a New York Times story detailing the press release, a SportsCenter bit about the press release and a reaction piece by Brian Phillips on Grantland.com.
Maybe it’s just because this is America, the land 
of the free and the home of the soccer-is-for-pris-sy-boys-and-girls-who-can’t-handle-real-sports-like-football-baseball-basketball-and-hockey senti-ment. I’d be inclined to agree with that, but there 
is a small problem with that line of thought. Major 
League Soccer just passed the NBA and National Hockey League for third place in attendance rank-ings, which shows Americans are caring much more about “The Beautiful Game.”
Thus, I am inclined to believe the reason there 
has not been much coverage for such an announce-ment, which went so far as to involve qualifying matches for the World Cup — the greatest and most 
popular sporting event — is because we don’t want 
to know.
This is a self-perpetuating cycle of circular rea-
soning.
If we don’t acknowledge there is a problem, 
then no action needs to be taken because there is no problem, which warrants no action to solve a non-ex-istent problem ... see what 
I mean?
At the risk of mirror-
ing the Grantland piece, 
the reason we don’t want 
to know a sports match is 
rigged is because sports 
serve as an idealistic escape from the world that beats us up and kicks us in the shins daily.
Within the conﬁ  nes of a single sports match, 
there’s no politicking and (most) rule-breaking is punished almost instantly.
It is a simple concept: Team A and its players 
want to beat Team B and its players and vice-versa. 
Firings and hirings happen between games. Fines 
and suspensions happen between games. External drama does not pervade the narrative of the game. All that matters is what the score is and how much time is left. Everything else gets sorted out after-
ward.
If a sport is corrupted and the external drama 
affects the product, it is no longer a part of sports; 
it instead becomes “sport,” a mere source of diver-
sion “that takes us away from our daily routine and 
gives us pleasure,” as deﬁ  ned by renowned sports marketer Matthew Shank. This puts it on par with any other source of entertainment, notably pro-fessional wrestling in which the match results are 
booked to fuel a dramatic narrative instead of two 
opponents competing against one another.
Acting like there is no problem was part of why 
the economy collapsed.
If soccer is relegated to that same destiny, every-
one, not just sports fans, will be worse off because of it.

We had a great time talking with you on Turlington Plaza 
and across campus these past two weeks.    
It was wonderful to be able to meet you and discuss the issues 
that are important to us at the University of Florida.
Thank you for letting us interrupt your day as you walked to 
class or headed home.
Thank you for sharing your ideas with us. Your enthusiasm 
will drive us to be even more passionate about making this uni-
versity a better place.
Thank you for offering us your support and encouragement. It 
meant the world to us.  
And thank you for voting.We ask you to continue to educate yourself on the issues. Attend 
Senate meetings. Visit the Student Govern-ment website. Read newspaper articles.
And we congratulate every candidate 
for having the courage to run for public of-ﬁ  ce at this university . You are a testament 
to the spirit of the Gator Nation.
We also offer special congratulations to Christina Bonarrigo, Jo-
selyn Rivas, Jayce Victor and the 50 new senators. We wish them the best this year as they serve the Student Body .  
Our work wasn’t done when the polls closed Wednesday night. 
Our work is just beginning.
Throughout the coming year, our senators will propose legisla-
tion to make this university a better place for UF students.   
We will keep ﬁ  ghting for you every day because our work 
won’t be done until every student has a voice in UF SG.

Students Party
Speaking Out31-year-old digital strategist and UF 
alumnus, created a petition on change.org asking Tebow  to not attend the church’s event.
Perry said he believed Tebow’s ap-
pearance would alienate some of his fans.
“Basically, [Jeffress has] maligned al-
most every religion or group of people,” Perry said.
“He’s said some pretty nasty things 
about folks, and I just think that by Tebow going to speak there, it’s just tac-itly endorsing those beliefs.”
The petition has received about 800 
signatures as of Thursday night.
Perry said he was pleased with 
Tebow’s cancellation, saying he sup-ported his tolerance and compassion.
Members of the Gainesville LGBT 
community seem to reﬂ  ect this senti-ment.
Terry Fleming, co-president of the 
Pride Community Center of North Cen-tral Florida, said Tebow’s decision to not speak at the church was a positive move.
“His recognition that it’s inappropri-
ate to appear at a church with a viru-lently homophobic preacher is a huge step in the right direction, and we wel-come that announcement,” he said.
Fleming added he supports Tebow 
using his media fame to be a witness to his faith and to be a model for toler-ance.
“He recognizes that the First Baptist 
Church of Dallas does not represent that message,” he said.8, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 2013

The Watoto Children’s Choir sing and dance Thursday night at the Mt. Pleasant 
United Methodist Church, located at 630 NW Second St.
LOCAL
MICHELLE JACKSON
Alligator Contributing Writer
Mondays are easy for Byron Jimmy.
During the day , the 12-year-old does his 
school work, plays games and watches tele-vision.
However, his evenings are spent singing, 
dancing and playing the drums in front of hundreds of people.
Orphaned in Uganda as a child, Byron has 
spent the last seven months traveling down the eastern coast of the United States as part of the Watoto Children’s Choir.
On Thursday night, he performed with 
21 other children in front of a packed room at the Mt. Pleasant United Methodist Church, 
located at 630 NW Second St.
About 500 people overﬂ  owed the church, 
crouching in the aisles and craning their 
necks to catch a glimpse of the children sing-ing, dancing and talking about their experi-ences in the Watoto ministry.
The Watoto Children’s Choir is the face of 
the larger ministry of Watoto, which provides homes for about 3,000 abandoned children 
and medicine to more than 2,000 HIV-positive 
women in Africa, said choir director Gideon Kizito, a 28-year-old from Kampala, Uganda.“We have babies that we get from latrines, 
garbage trucks, hospitals and public places,” he said. “We give them the necessary care that they need to survive.”
The children’s choir started in 1994 as a 
way to spread awareness and raise support for the organization, Kizito said.
The choir has performed in schools, busi-
nesses and churches on four continents as well as in front of political ﬁ  gures such as Queen Elizabeth II and President George W. Bush.
Some of the children, whose ages range 
from 7 to 13, grew up raising their siblings on their own or as former child soldiers, Kizito said.
“This is a very different group of kids,” he 
said. “Because they have been through such a hard walk of life, we try to remind them that it is OK to act like a child.”
Tonja Cave, a senior clerk for UF’s Ofﬁ  ce 
for Student Financial Affairs, attended Thurs-
day’s performance with her daughter.
Cave, 45, said hearing the children’s sto-
ries was an important reminder of the bless-
ings American children have.
“I told my daughter she was so blessed 
she could put her hand on food and clothes,” she said. “It’s important to remember.”African children’s choir performs for 500 at Gainesville church
About 800 signed a petition
TEBOW , from page 1Next goal: a whole department
cluded in the initial proposal.
Khama Jamaal Weatherspoon, academic 
chair of UF’s Progressive Black Men Inc. and 
vice president of UF’s Black Political Science Association, was one of them.
He said the major is necessary because it 
equates African-American studies to that of other history studies majors such as Jewish history.
“If we have studies of other cultures or 
whatnot, I think it would only be fair if we had one for African-American studies,” said the 21-year-old UF political science senior. “The major gives it recognition and poten-
cy.”
Weatherspoon said he would have cho-
sen to major in African-American studies 
instead of political science if it was around when he was a freshman.
The major will offer students a variety of 
career opportunities, Austin said.
The program plans to hold a panel dis-cussion in either March or April to inform students of the career opportunities avail-able to them as African-American studies majors.
Austin said students would have the abil-
ity to pursue careers in the government, an-thropology, political science, politics, civil 
rights, law and nonproﬁ  t organizations.
If the major is approved 
by all the boards, students can begin registering for 
it as early as March and 
begin taking classes in the 
Fall, she said.
Austin said the pro-
gram’s next endeavor, once 
the major is approved, would be to establish a UF department of African-American stud-ies.
“Right now, we’re just taking it one step 
at a time, trying to get the major in place, 
but at some point, we would like to have a 
department,” she said.MAJOR , from page 1

In Florida’s opening weekend series against Duke, 
Ryan Harris was Florida’s most impressive pitcher.
He threw all of his pitches for strikes, allowing 
only two hits in 4.2 scoreless innings across two ap-
pearances.
Coach Kevin O’Sullivan was impressed with the 
sophomore reliever, but he did have one concern.
“He was really good on Friday and really good 
today,” O’Sullivan said. “He competed. He threw the ball with conviction. Other than the leadoff walk again. We score four and walk the leadoff man.”
As No. 17 Florida (3-2) prepares to face Florida 
Gulf Coast (2-1) in its second weekend series of the season, O’Sullivan hopes his pitching staff can re-verse a trend of giving the opposition’s leadoff bat-
ter a free pass.
Through the first 48 innings this year , Florida 
pitchers have walked the leadoff batter seven times. 
The opposing team has gone on to score two runs in 
the inning on three occasions.
In the Gators’ 4-3 loss to Duke on Feb. 15, starter 
Jonathon Crawford walked Chris Marconcini on a 
full count to begin the fourth inning. On the next at-bat, Duke took a 2-1 lead when Jordan Betts hom-
ered to left.
In the eighth inning, sophomore left-hander Corey 
Stump relieved Harris and walked Jeff Kremer to be-gin the inning. Mike Rosenfeld drove Kremer in on a 
triple, and Rosenfeld scored later in the inning.

The Gators vowed to change their 
losing ways, to revert back to the team 
that opened the season 11-3 prior to a disastrous January when Florida lost 
six of its eight games. 
But February has quickly become 
just as disappointing.
Despite erasing a double-digit half-
time deficit, UF let another winnable 
game slip through its hands, losing 68-57 to Vanderbilt on Thursday night in the O’Connell Center. 
The loss drops UF to 2-3 this month 
and 2-8 in its past 10 games. 
“Very disappointed,” coach Aman-
da Butler said. “I can get my thesaurus out if you want me to, but frustrated really sums it up best, because there is a level of potential we are not reach-ing.”
Trailing 26-15 to open the second 
half, Florida (15-12, 4-9 Southeastern Conference) turned to Jennifer George to mount a comeback. Behind George, 
the team’s only senior, the Gators went on a 15-4 run 
to take a 32-30  
lead with 12:10 remaining, their first 
lead since early in the first half. 
George finished with 13 points and 
11 rebounds, her first double-double since suffering a dislocated right shoul-der against LSU on Jan. 6. 
But Florida’s early second-half run 
proved unsustainable. Vanderbilt re-sponded with runs of 9-0 and 15-3 to regain a 58-44 lead with 2:42 left in the game.  UF blows second-half leadsoftBALL

In 123 at-bats, Katie Medina had never 
hit a home run.
The sophomore shortstop went all of 
2012 without knocking a ball out of the 
park. Her freshman year, she only batted 
.241 with six extra-base hits.
But when Medina came up in the bot-
tom of the second inning, she got ahold of a Molly Medeiros pitch and drilled it over 
the left-center field fence.
“It was awesome,” Medina said. “It was 
probably one of the greatest feelings I’ve had in a while. Words can’t even describe how it felt.”
The home run came immediately after 
center fielder Briana Little hit one out to nearly the same spot as Medina. 
The three runs that came on those two 
home runs gave No. 5 Florida (14-0) all it needed in an 8-2 victory against Loyola 
Marymount (3-3).Junior Hannah Rogers took the circle in

Senior guard Kenny Boynton walks back to play defense after scoring during Florida’s 69-52 
victory against Kentucky on Feb. 12 in the O’Connell Center.
END OF GREGULATION
    During the past two seasons, the 
Gators have not played well in the “clutch.” Fortunately for 
them, “clutch” probably isn’t real. 
  Since the start of the 2011-12 season, 
Florida has run 11 offensive possessions while trailing by three or fewer points with less than 3 minutes to play. The Gators have scored just seven points, or .636 points per possession, in those sce-narios. 
  That number is terrible, but having a 
bad 11 possessions is like having a bad 7 minutes. It happens, and it doesn’t mean 
anything about Florida’s ability to per-
form in crunch time. 
  Even the points per possession num-
ber is suspect. If the Gators make one more shot, they’re an average “clutch” team. If they make two more, people are writing about how they’re one of the most clutch teams in the country.
  When UF 
trailed Missouri by a point with 7 seconds left in Wednesday’s game, Kenny Boynton was wrong to pull up for a three. 
Was the shot as bad as everyone is mak-
ing it out to be? No, not at all. His hesita-
tion dribble left his defender off balance, giving Boynton a clean look. A shot with 7 seconds left gives UF time to grab an offensive board, or an opportunity to foul and extend the game after a miss. 
  When Missouri made a free throw to 
stretch its lead to three with 3.1 seconds 
remaining, Boynton made a great pass 
to get Mike Rosario an open look for the tie. But I guess there’s no such thing as a “clutch” pass. 
  In his four years at Florida, Boynton 
has been involved in a lot of “clutch” situations. He’s had 23 touches while the 
Gators were trailing by three or fewer 
points with 3 or fewer minutes to play. He’s hit 2 of 12 shots, scored nine points and grabbed an offensive rebound. He has zero turnovers in those situations. Are those great stats? No, not at all. But they amount to the equivalent of a bad game. Not something anyone should make sweeping judgments about. 
    While the sample size is too small to 
be critical of the results, it’s almost never too small to be critical of the process. 
  This year, UF has had six offensive 
possessions in which it needed a “clutch” play , and it has scored just three points. During those possessions, Scottie Wil-
bekin has taken three shots, Boynton has 
taken two and Mike Rosario has taken one. Fifteen of UF’s 16 touches in those situations have been by that trio. Erik Murphy touched the ball once — just long enough to give it up again. Patric Young has done nothing but screen. 
  Last year, the Gators had only ﬁ  ve 
possessions in which they needed a 
“clutch” play. They scored four points, 
both putbacks by Young. In all, UF grabbed four offensive boards on those possessions — food for thought for those who believe Boynton let go of that three too quickly . 
  Guards dominated in 2011-12, taking 
6 of UF’s 9 “clutch” shot attempts and getting 14 of its 21 touches in “clutch” 
time.
  Maybe if they passed, Florida would 
be more “clutch.” 
  During the 2009-11 seasons, UF was 
a little better in the “clutch,” scoring 33 
points in 30 possessions for a 1.1 points per possession average. As you can see in the appendix on alligatorSports.org, the Gators passed the ball considerably 
more than they have in recent late game 
situations today. Of course, the result was mostly the same, with Boynton and Walker playing hero ball and taking 21 of the 30 shots. But in those instances it worked, which will sometimes hap-pen when you’re dealing with a 30-shot sample. There’s a lot of variation — way 
too much to put a classiﬁ  cation on how 
“clutch” a player or team is. 
  The UF teams that won back-to-back 
titles in 2005-07 scored one point per “clutch” possession, with totals of 34 points on 34 possessions that are simi-lar to, but just a step below, the 2009-11 
squads.  
  So, the UF teams that won it all in 
consecutive seasons were actually less 
“clutch” than the 2009-11 group, which was twice bounced from the NCAA Tournament after coming up short in close games. Either that, or maybe “clutch” isn’t real.

twitter: @gregluca“We have some key people that fatigue 
rules their life,” Butler said. “As soon 
as they get tired, then their level of play drops significantly. That’s really hard to overcome.”
Senior forward Tiffany Clarke picked 
up the slack for the Commodores, who were without leading scorer Christina Foggie. The junior guard missed her third straight game after suffering a knee injury against Kentucky on Feb. 10. 
Clarke scored a game-high 26 points on 
10-of-16 shooting.
“She had her way with us on the low 
block,” Butler said. “Her teammates did a great job of finding her. … I guess we need to play more zone. I just feel like we’re bet-ter than that.”
Vanderbilt (17-9, 7-6 SEC) harassed 
Florida into its worst opening half of the season. The Gators made just 7 of their 26 attempts from the floor before halftime. Coupled with 12 turnovers, UF scored a first-half season-low 15 points.
The Commodores capitalized on the 
slow start, using a 12-3 run to end the first half with a 26-15 lead.
“We’re having trouble sustaining our 
energy throughout the game,” George said. “That’s a reason we are having these lulls. When we fix that problem, we will become a better team.”
Freshman Sydney Moss led the Gators 
with 15 points but hoisted a career-high 21 shots. She also pulled down 10 rebounds for her second double-double of the sea-son.
“I could care less about the rebounds 
and points,” Moss said. “I would rather just win, whether I’m sitting on the bench being the water girl or passing the ball in.”

Despite a better effort in 
the circle, Florida’s second 
game was much closer than the first. 
The Gators had a chance 
to put a run on the board in the fourth inning after sopho-more Bailey Castro singled 
and Little was hit by a pitch.
The two runners advanced when Stephanie Tofft ground-
ed out, but freshman Taylore 
Fuller and sophomore Jes-
sica Damico both struck out swinging.
In the next inning, second 
baseman Kelsey Stewart hit a 2-2 pitch to right center for a triple. But Kelsey Horton 
struck out swinging and Hae-
ger flew out to center field, stranding a runner in scor -
ing position for the second straight frame. 
Florida finally broke 
through in the sixth inning.
The Gators loaded the 
bases for pinch hitter Ens-
ley Gammel. She dropped 
down a bunt, and Castro was thrown out at home. When 
the catcher tried to double 
up Fuller at second base, she threw the ball away, leading 
to the game’s first run.
Taylor Schwarz added a 
run-scoring single later in the inning.
Haeger fanned two batters 
and forced a pop-up in the top of the seventh to secure 
the victory for Florida.
“We have a lot of heart,” 
Haeger said. “I can trust these girls and I know they’re going to do something insane 
and incredible and win the 
ball game.”

When Mackenzie Caquatto isn’t balanc-
ing handstands or posting perfect scores on 
bars, she’s teaching the alphabet.  
You can find the aspiring teacher tutor -
ing children a few blocks from the UF cam-pus at the Boys and Girls Club of Alachua 
County following her Monday morning conditioning regiment. 
She visits the kids on Wednesdays too. “Ever since I was little, I always used 
to play teacher with my friends like every 
little kid,” Caquatto said. “I kind of decid-
ed that was where I wanted to go with my life.”
The Naperville, Ill., native is working 
towards a degree in special education. 
Most days, she takes part in weekly prac-
tice and dual meets. But two days a week, she holds a 75-minute tutoring session. If she isn’t busy watching her practice 
footage, she’s structuring lesson plans and coming up with creative ideas for activities for her student mentee, a 6-year-old named Emaney. 
“Preparing lesson plans can take quite 
a long time,” Caquatto said. “Presenting those lesson plans is kind of like compe-
tition. You know what you want the out-
come to be but you don’t know if it’s going to end up that way.”
Teaching — much like the beginning of 
her junior season — was more challenging 
than she originally thought. 
Earlier this year, Caquatto struggled to 
return to her 2012 form. She earned All-America first-team honors at the NCAA 
Championships on uneven bars.  She post-
ed scores of 9.85 and 9.25 in her first two 
meets. 
After weeks of training and tweaking 
her routine, she has strung together five 
scores of 9.9, boosting her season average to 9.83. She remains the only athlete in the 
NCAA to post a perfect 10 in the event. 
Still, Caquatto finds time to improve les-
son plans for her mentee. 
For one of her creative projects Caquatto 
assembled a plastic word 
box for Emaney. At ev-ery meeting, Caquatto 
has Emaney choose a few 
words from the weekly reading to drop in the 
box. Caquatto does the same, but jokingly admits 
that her student doesn’t 
always pick the most challenging word. 
“She usually picks the ones that she 
knows,” Caquatto said. “And then I pick 
one she doesn’t know.”
When they revisit the box, Caquatto tests 
Emaney’s knowledge of the words. For ev-
ery three words Emaney understands, Ca-
quatto gives the kindergartner a sticker to 
decorate the box. So far, Emaney has collected 25.
“She’s still young, so it’s kind of hard 
to come up with really creative projects,” 
Caquatto said. “I just try to keep her en-gaged.”
But Emaney isn’t the only one who ben-
efits from Caquatto’s teachings. 
Bridgette Caquatto, Mackenzie’s young-
er sister, regularly seeks her advice.   When Bridgette was recovering from shoulder and knee surgery, Mackenzie was a source of comfort. Mackenzie had been there be-fore, suffering two ankle injuries during 
the 2011 U.S. World Championships. 
“[Mackenzie is] going to be a really good 
teacher someday,” Bridgette said. “She’ll act like a kid with the kids, so they’ll really 
enjoy (her).”
Bridgette wasn’t shy about Mackenzie’s 
height, either.
“If she comes up in a fifth or fourth 
grade class, half of her boy students are go-ing to be taller than her,” Bridgette said. Junior sharpening leadership skills through teaching

O’Sullivan wants pitchers to attack strike zone
counts, you just can’t do it,” O’Sullivan 
said following the opening loss. “Obvi-ously, you have to throw strikes in that 
situation.”
With the game tied 1-1, UF starter Jus-
tin Shafer walked Chase Griffin to begin 
the fourth inning of Wednesday’s 8-7 
12-inning loss to Georgia Southern. After 
two singles and a sacrifice bunt, Florida was down 3-1. 
“It’s unacceptable,” Shafer said. “It 
needs to stop for all of us, including my-
self. It’s not something that should be go-ing on.”
Florida experienced the problem to a 
lesser extent last year, walking 11 players through five games.
Shafer said that O’Sullivan has contin-
ued to emphasize that the pitchers should attack the strike zone.
“Just throw strikes,” Shafer said when 
asked what advice his coach had given 
the staff. “First two out of three be strikes. I didn’t execute today well doing it, and as a team we didn’t. We’ll get better. We’ll keep working on it.”
The Florida pitching staff has issued 15 
walks so far this season, but Florida Gulf Coast’s lineup has drawn three walks in three games. Against a less patient team, the Gators should have an easier time lim-iting the free passes. 
However, following Wednesday’s loss 
to Georgia Southern. O’Sullivan chose not to dwell on the problem.
“I don’t want to talk about it anymore,” 
O’Sullivan said.

Coach Billy Donovan wants 
his players to take open shots, 
regardless of whether their at-
tempts are inside or beyond the 
arc. 
But Donovan said the Gators 
were too reliant on three-pointers 
in Florida’s 63-60 road loss to Missouri on Tuesday night. 
Florida attempted 33 of its 
54 shots from three-point range, draining only 10. The Gators 
could not establish a post pres-ence against the Tigers. Instead, Florida took a season-high 61.1 percent of its attempts from be-
yond the arc.
“We took too many threes,” 
Donovan said.“I didn’t think we had good 
enough balance. When we’ve at-
tacked the paint, whether it’s the 
pass or the post up or a drive, 
our offense is a lot better. And I thought we had too many posses-sions where we didn’t really look to do that enough.”
In the contest’s final 6 minutes, 
Florida went 1 of 7 from three as Mizzou stormed back from a 13-point deficit. 
Forward Erik Murphy and 
guard Kenny Boynton each went 
2 of 9 from beyond the three-
point line. 
On two-point field goal at-
tempts, Murphy and center Patric Young combined for four points 
on 2-of-6 shooting. 
Missouri outscored Florida 24-
16 in the paint.
“We tried to move the ball 
around, tried to get the open 
shots, but I think we did a little too much of staying on the pe-rimeter,” guard Scottie Wilbekin said. “We didn’t attack as much 
as we should’ve or get the ball in 
the post.”
Florida was similarly unbal-
anced on offense in its 80-69 loss 
to Arkansas on Feb. 5, taking 27 
of its 56 shots from beyond the arc.
No. 5 Florida (21-4, 11-2 South-
eastern Conference) will host Ar -
kansas on Saturday at 7 p.m. in the O’Connell Center. 
The Razorbacks (16-9, 7-5 SEC) 
are 15-1 at home but 2-8 on the 
road and at neutral sites.
They have won four of their 
past five games, including a 73-71 
victory against Missouri on Sat-urday in Bud Walton Arena and 
a 62-60 win against Georgia on 
Thursday night in Fayetteville.
Unlike Florida, Arkansas has 
maintained a balanced approach 
on offense since the first meeting 
between both teams.  
“They’re playing better,” Don-
ovan said.
“We don’t look a whole lot at 
if you’re playing here at home or on the road. Sometimes people look at trends, but trends aren’t guaranteed or something that’s always going to happen. If you look at them, the one thing you want to look at is that they’ve 
progressed.”
Despite losing to the Razor -
backs earlier in the month, the 
Gators will not approach Satur -
day night’s matchup with a vin-
dictive mindset. 
They are done dwelling on the 
Feb. 5 loss. 
“I have never been a big be-
liever in payback. What do you 
get back?” Donovan said.
“It’s not like if we all of a sud-
den win the game, (and) we get 
the Fayetteville game back. It 
doesn’t work like that. That game is a loss. This is the next most im-portant thing.” 
Yeguete ahead of schedule: Ju-
nior forward Will Yeguete could return as soon as Florida’s March 
6 game against Vanderbilt, Dono-
van said Thursday. The contest in the O’Connell is the Gators’ final 
home date this season.
Since undergoing arthroscopic 
surgery on Feb. 8 to remove bone 
chips in his right knee, Yeguete has missed four games. Team doctors originally set the time-
table for his return at 4-6 weeks.
Yeguete has begun to partici-
pate in light running drills dur -
ing practice.
“He’s moving quicker than I 
think the doctors thought,” Don-
ovan said. “It’s going to be totally up to them.”16, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 2013
