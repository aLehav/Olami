� COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE 
BEING TARGETED.

Two UF students have been target-
ed by phone scammers claiming to be 
holding their family members hostage in the past month, according to a Uni-versity Police public bulletin.
The caller claimed that if the student 
sent money , then the family member would be released unharmed, UPD Sgt. Kristy Maculan said.
One student received a call that her 
father was being held hostage.
“She said she hadn’t spoken to her 
father in years,” Maculan said. “So they eventually hung up.”
Maculan said these incidents were 
the ﬁ  rst of their kind she knew of be-ing reported to UPD, but this type of scam has been common for years across the world.
She said she was unsure how the 
callers had gotten the students’ phone numbers. Anyone who receives a sim-ilar call should report it to UPD.
“Remain calm. Don’t send any 
money. Don’t provide any personal information,” Maculan said. “If you have any way to contact that family member, then do that.”
According to the bulletin, people 
interested in more information about telephone and Internet scams can visit the Federal Trade Commission at www.FTC.gov , the Federal Bureau of Investigation at www.FBI.gov or the National White Collar Crime Center at www.NW3C.org. Scams can be re-ported through www.FTC.gov or to the Internet Crime Complaint Center at www.IC3.gov.

Donors listing UF as their employer 
contributed about $142,000 to political 
candidates and groups during the 2012 election cycle, according to data on www.OpenSecrets.org, a money-tracking website launched by the Center for Responsive Poli-tics.
Of that amount, $27,524 was donated to Republican causes and $74,941 to Demo-cratic causes, and the remaining money was given to groups with unspeciﬁ  ed afﬁ  lia-tions.
This breakdown isn’t surprising, said 
UF political science professor Daniel Smith. Alachua County is generally liberal, he said, and most university faculty members’ par-tisan afﬁ  liations are on the Democratic side as well.
“You don’t have to check your partisan-ship at the door,” he said. “You don’t give up your First Amendment rights to associ-ate just because you’re a UF faculty mem-
ber.”
UF spokeswoman Jan-
ine Sikes conﬁ  rmed this.
“Everyone that works 
at UF has the right to do-nate to the party of their 
choice,” she said, adding that UF does not endorse candidates.
A search of www.OpenSecrets.org’s 
donor lookup database Monday afternoon turned up 288 records in which donors listed their employer as “University of Florida.”
John Kirkpatrick, chair of Department 
of Orthopaedic Surgery and Rehabilitation at the UF College of Medicine-Jacksonville, donated the most money on the list. Ac-cording to search results, his contributions totaled $10,500 and included $1,000 to Re-publican candidate Mitt Romney and $2,500 to the Campaign for American Values.
Basketball coach Billy Donovan donated 
$1,000 to Florida Republican Senate candi-date Steve Oelrich, according to the results.

Gainesville residents are helping Hurricane 
Sandy victims get back on their feet.
Throughout the city , organizations are 
sending out volunteers and collecting dona-
tions to help people whose homes were de-stroyed in the past week by the hurricane.St. Augustine Catholic Church and Holy 
Faith Catholic Church held a special collection during their services Saturday and Sunday . The University Lutheran Church is also col-lecting money to help victims.
The bishop of the Diocese of St. Augustine, 
located in Jacksonville, also asked more than 60 parishes that are spread out in 17 counties in North Florida to hold a special collection during all masses on Nov . 17 and Nov . 18, said Christina Retzer, editorial assistant for the di-rector of communications at the Diocese of St. Augustine. The money raised will be sent to Catholic Charities USA, a private network of social service organizations. It will distribute the money to those in need in Northern states.
The American Red Cross in Alachua Coun-
ty is recruiting volunteers to help at shelters and other locations. Eleven volunteers from around Central Florida have traveled to help so far.“A local volunteer said everything was go-
ing good, but we’re going to move to open an-other 500-people shelter,” said Casey Schmelz, emergency services manager for the organiza-tion.
The American Red Cross has provided 
about 92,000 shelters since evacuation began, Schmelz said. 
As of Sunday, the American Red Cross col-
lected $30 million nationally.
“It empowers them to get back to normal,” 
she said.

When students reach for a can 
of Red Bull to keep them awake 
through an all-night study ses-sion, they may be getting more caffeine than they expect.
A recent Consumer Reports 
study found that energy drinks such as Red Bull and Monster do not always accurately report how much caffeine they contain, if they report it at all.  
According to the report, 11 of 
the 27 top-selling energy drinks in the U.S. do not specify the amount of caffeine they contain.
Of the 16 drinks that do, ﬁ  ve 
contained more caffeine than listed on their labels. On average, the actual amount was 20 percent more caffeine than listed.
Janis Mena, coordinator of nu-
trition services at UF’s Student Health Care Center, said a study on caffeine content in coffee done at UF found caffeine varies from cup to cup by as much as 200 or 300 milligrams.
When it comes to energy 
drinks, however, Mena said, “I think there should be truth in la-beling.”
Mena said caffeine, which is 
a stimulant,  cause dizziness and can increase heart rate and blood pressure.
Aly Perez, a 21-year-old ad-
vertising senior, said she does not look at labels. She also said she doesn’t really care how much caffeine is in her favorite energy drink, the low-carb Monster in the blue can.
Consumer Reports’ study 
echoes Perez’s view; it said Mon-ster reported it does not include actual caffeine content on the label because numbers are “not mean-ingful to most consumers.”
Elaine Turner, senior associate 
dean of the College of Agricul-tural and Life Sciences, wrote in an email that caffeine content is not required by law to be listed on food labels.
Because caffeine is only present 
in a small percentage of foods and beverages available to consumers, she said, requiring companies to include caffeine content on labels doesn’t make sense.
Mena said the best way to 
feel energetic is to get a sufﬁ  -cient amount of sleep and food. Drinking a reasonable amount of coffee is ﬁ  ne, she said, but replac-ing sleep and food with caffeine doesn’t work.
“If you need energy in the 
morning, eat breakfast,” she said. “It’s probably much better for sus-tainable energy than a stimulant such as caffeine would be.”Study ﬁ  nds secret stash

Bedbugs often sleep in others’ beds, but they don’t 
want to cuddle.
The blood-sucking insects can thrive with less access to 
feeding, according to a new UF study published online by 
the Medical and Veterinary Entomology.
The study measured the number of bedbugs that would 
be necessary to remove 5 percent of a person’s blood. 
The bugs will produce more eggs if there is more food, 
said Roberto Pereira, associate research scientist at the Department of Entomology and Nematology.“Weak organisms are prone to diseas-
es,” he said. “The body is weak because a lot of blood is taken out.”
About 24,000 bedbugs feeding on a 
154-pound adult and 3,400 bedbugs feed-ing on a 22-pound baby can cause harm, 
according to the study. 
The study showed the dark-brown in-
sects were full after 10 minutes of feed-ing. 
Pereira said most people’s beds are usually infested 
with bedbugs by sleeping in infested hotel rooms. UF’s dorms have mostly been bedbug-free.Wayne Walker, the senior pest control technician for 
the University of Florida Department of Housing and Residence Education, said he has received about three or four complaints since the beginning of the semester about possible bedbugs, but there hasn’t been a case of bedbugs in the residence halls for more than a year.
“We’ve been real fortunate,” he said.He said he doesn’t think the bedbug problem will go 
away, but it’s something he and his staff will have to be vigilant about.
“We need to continue to educate the residents and 
make sure we inspect the rooms very thoroughly,” Walk-er said.UF study ﬁ  nds bedbugs capable of beating the odds, living longer“If you need energy in 
the morning, eat breakfast. 
It’s probably much better 
for sustainable energy than 
a stimulant such as caf-
feine would be.”

A Gainesville man’s request 
for a dollar from a stranger 
turned into an attempted rob-bery that landed him behind bars Monday morning.
Gainesville Police arrested 
Jason Hardy, 27, of 2911 NE 15th St., on a felony attempted rob-bery charge, according to a GPD arrest report.
At about 12:45 a.m. Monday, 
Hardy walked up to a man in the 200 block of West Univer-sity Avenue and asked him for money.The man ignored Hardy and 
walked away.
Hardy told the man “he 
would rob him 
of everything that he had” and “that he had a pistol in his pocket,” according to the report.
The man 
ran into a nearby bar to call po-lice. Hardy followed and once inside, said to the man, “If you come outside I will mess you up.”
A bartender ordered Hardy out of the bar. Hardy then rode away on his bicycle before po-lice arrived.
At 2:06 a.m, police located 
and arrested Hardy in the 400 block of West University Av-enue.
After his arrest, Hardy told 
GPD ofﬁ  cers he only asked the man for a “light” and got “heat-ed” when the man ignored him, according to the report.  
Police booked Hardy into 
Alachua County Jail at 2:22 a.m., where he remained Monday night with a $50,000 bond.

Statistics professor Maria 
Ripol gave $250 to President 
Barack Obama, as did Assis-tant Vice President of Student Affairs Jeanna Mastrodicasa.
“I support President 
Obama’s efforts,” she said, specifically referencing his initiatives that support col-lege students. “I work closely with students, so I see the ben-efits.”
She said she’s planning 
to vote for Obama in today’s election.
On the other side of the po-
litical spectrum, UF physics professor Richard Woodard said he’s voting for Romney.
“I wish academia was not 
as far left as it is,” said Woo-dard, who donated $2,000 to-tal to Florida Republican Rep. Cliff Stearns, $1,000 to Minne-sota Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann and $1,000 to the Senate Conservatives Fund.
Woodard said he takes is-
sue with the politicization of science, specifically when his colleagues jump on global warming as a legitimate theo-ry, he said.
“It makes me depressed and 
frightened,” he said, “that the effort that I and others put into rolling back the frontiers of human knowledge in our own fields is going to be lumped in this very shaky science behind anthropometric global warm-ing.”

After Fest 11 rocked Gainesville last week-
end, many business owners close to the action 
downtown said the punk-rock festival com-pensated for the mass migration to Jackson-ville for the Florida-Georgia game.
Katie Simmons, an employee at Leonardo’s 
By The Slice, said the pizzeria was “as busy as a home game — just a different fan base.”Throughout the festival, she said lines of-
ten spilled out of the pizzeria’s doors onto the sidewalk and stretched to the Kangaroo gas station next door.
Andrew Stringfield, bartender at Lillian’s 
Music Store, said sales remained average be-cause Fest attendees offset those who left town for the game.
Although the establishment wasn’t a Fest 
venue, Stringfield said, he still enjoyed a busy weekend with diverse patrons. He said cus-tomers with far-away accents weaved in and out of the store throughout the weekend, many of whom traveled from Europe to attend.
Mike Salay , owner of Anthem Tattoo Parlor, said he wasn’t surprised by the amount of cus-tomers he received during the weekend. But this year, he said, many souvenir-tattoo seek-ers seemed to wait until the end of the festival to get inked.
“A lot of people realized they didn’t want 
to have a fresh tattoo being around sweaty bars,” he said.
Salay’s wife, Samantha Salay, said many 
Fest participants had to be put on wait lists to get tattoos.She said she especially recalled a newly 
married couple coming in to get “Stress Face” bride and groom tattoos. She said they had tied the knot earlier at the Holiday Inn.
Adam Wood, manager at Durty Nelly’s 
Irish Pub, said the venue hosted 25 to 30 shows during the weekend, and the volume of busi-ness “met expectations.”
He said he thought more people were in 
town for Fest 11 than previous years and had to schedule three to four extra bouncers be-cause of the crowd.
“It’s getting bigger every year,” Wood 
said. “It’s like St. Patrick’s Day but all week-end long.”

UF is the 98th smartest school in 
the country , according to a study released Thursday.
Lumosity, an online brain train-
ing and neuroscience research com-pany, ranked 403 colleges and uni-versities. The University of South Florida’s main campus was ranked No. 215, Florida State University came in at No. 228 and the Univer -
sity of Central Florida was No. 251.
“We’re in the top 25 percent,” 
UF spokesman Steve Orlando said. “We’re in some fairly good com-pany.”
Lumosity data scientist Daniel 
Sternberg said the study was unlike others because its results were based on cognitive performance. Rankings by other companies are often based on students’ SAT and ACT scores, and surveys, he said.
The study focused on five areas: 
speed, flexibility , attention, memory and problem solving.
“As users progress through col-
lege, we can look at tracking and how performance changes as a func-tion of being at that university for four years,” he said.
Website users were asked to play 
brain-training games, Sternberg said. The individual game scores were then combined to create an av-erage for the institution.
Orlando said the study method 
was interesting even though rank-ings do not necessarily depict how smart students truly are.
“[Employers] like our students 
because they’re well-rounded,” he said. “We have a lot of other indica-tors that show our students are well-prepared when they graduate.”
Meghan Bradley , a 21-year-old 
finance junior, said she agrees with the ranking because UF offers a vari-ety of opportunities to its students.
“I think it shows we’re pretty 
smart,” she said. “Many of the schools that made it into the top of each subcategory specialize in technology and science or are Ivy League.”
UF was ranked 52nd for prob-
lem solving and 88th for flexibility , Sternberg said, but Orlando said he thinks UF students already do well in those areas.
Bradley said she didn’t under -
stand why UF ranked so low in flex-ibility.
“We don’t know who took this 
study to represent UF. Every indi-vidual is different, and we all may be stronger in one thing but not an-other.”TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Why in the world are we allowed to vote for president?
Take a look around you. Do you really want that 
guy to have a hand in deciding your future?
BuzzFeed published a post on Monday titled: “63 People 
Who Won’t Be Making A Difference On Tuesday.”
Author Katie Notopoulos took screen captures of pretty 
typical and average Twitter users who asked what they thought 
were important questions about Election Day.
Some key tweets:“How do you know if your register to vote?”“i wana vote next weeekend just dont know how to register 
:/ #wahh”
“@ladygaga It’s too late for me to register to vote, I’m so 
Dumb, I forgot :/”
We have no idea what excuse people had that allowed them 
to forget to register to vote.
Yes, we live in a college town. Yes, we live in a battleground/
swing/targeted state, which means we are around politics pos-sibly more than some of the other people in this country.
But presidential elections are every four years. This is a rou-
tine thing. This was not a surprise that snuck up on everybody.
The people on that list will not be voting in this election cycle; 
that’s pretty safe to say . Thousands more will, though. And you should want to be one of them.
We’re a generation who thrives on sharing all of our most 
personal news quickly. We take “deep” photographs of our cof-fee. We complain about our emotions and then complain when people offer to help. We share campaigns to take down evil, for-eign regimes without ever leaving the comfort of our couches.
Someone decided a long time ago that we have a voice in our 
politics. We are an awkward and anxious generation, but some-how we have power and authority every once in a while.
It’s time to use it. This isn’t a call to arms. This isn’t a broad-
cast to the desolate-youth types of the world who think their voice isn’t heard. Because this is America, and for some reason we still have an Electoral College, our direct voice gets diluted through a couple bureaucracies before it’s actually heard. But it’s still our America. It’s our bureaucracies. We’re in charge of how our country affects us and every other country. It’s kind of like the “Gilmore Girls” theme song.
“Where you lead, I will follow.”Foreign policy is like “Gilmore Girls”: fast-paced, confusing 
and full of references that you don’t understand.
Our country affects everyone around us, but sometimes we 
forget that. Make the responsible choice when you vote today (if you haven’t voted already).
Choose the local and national candidates who not only have 
your best interests at heart but who will also act responsibly on our behalf as a country as a whole.
Find some joy in your civic duty , but please take it seriously . 
There will always be fools on Twitter who rant about how dumb they are. Let’s be better than them.
You’re already ahead of the game. Not that Florida is a model 
citizen for anything, but we have the blessing/curse of being a sought-after state. We get to hear a lot of different sides from all of the candidates.Celebrate your right: It’s Election Day! 
You registered. You stood in line. You took part in 
one of the most important occasions our nation will ever practice.
Congratulations! I want to dedicate this column to you, 
voter. 
Be ensured you made a difference. If you feel like your 
vote “doesn’t really count,” be assured that it certainly matters and so do you.
To those of you who may be reading this before casting 
a ballot, be encouraged! Please don’t give up or get out of line. Patience is a virtue, and it’s remarkable that you came out wanting to make your voice heard. Remember, good things come to those who wait.
Maybe consider voting early the next time around.For many young people, this is the ﬁ  rst election where 
they were of age to vote. There’s a ﬁ  rst time for everything, so I hope the experience was both rewarding and memora-ble – it only happens once. Cherish the moment, and make it a memory you’ll want to tell your children about.
It certainly was for me! It just so happened I got the 
chance to snap a photo with singer-songwriter Sara Ba-reilles right before I cast my ballot downtown.
I know many of you feel a little overwhelmed by what 
you’ve seen leading up to this day. Advocates of voter reg-istration were in your face, the advertisements have been in your face and some aspect of the election has been ev-erywhere you were — whether it was in conversation, on your television, on a social media feed, on people’s clothes or on the bumper of the car in front of you. Find courage in knowing it was and really is all for the best.
I encourage you to tune in to the networks that will be 
broadcasting the results tonight. You won’t realize until later how rewarding of an experience it is to watch history happen.
This is a big deal, people! Whatever the result of this 
election may be, it will have a signiﬁ  cant impact on the future of our nation.Have fun with it. See if you 
can correctly predict which can-didate will win each state. Have snacks and watch with your friends and loved ones. Most im-portantly, be informed.
Continue to voice your 
thoughts as well. I have loved seeing my Facebook and Twitter 
feeds ﬁ  lled with commentary over the duration of these campaigns as a whole.
OK, I haven’t loved everything that’s been said, but 
what I do love is the fact that people, young people espe-cially, are paying attention and believe their opinions have value — because they do.
Although you may not have the same political beliefs 
as someone, ﬁ  nd a way to appreciate the contrast. When you think about it, the difference in opinions should re-mind you of the freedom of speech and right to free choice we all possess.  
Sometimes I wish we could observe Election Day the 
same way we observe many other holidays. I’d be ecstatic getting a day off work or school to go vote, be happy about it and watch the results unfold.
Maybe the extra time could make the process of voting 
on Election Day much easier. Then again, maybe less peo-ple would vote early and the polls would be overcrowded that Tuesday. Who knows? What I am saying is I wish Election Day was something people looked forward to and commemorated, an occasion they would enjoy rather than dread.
Celebrate today! This is your country. When it’s all said 
and done, no matter what ofﬁ  cials are elected or which amendments are passed, it is we the people who together make this nation what it is.

For James Paulk, the Thanks-
giving season is a reminder of 
growing up in a one-parent home.
He said he knew his mom 
made sacrifices to feed him and his siblings — sacrifices he was of-ten oblivious to as a child.
“As well as lots of love, we al-
ways had lots of food in that cabi-net,” he said.
As Paulk stood inside the Ala-
chua County Fairgrounds Exhi-bition Building surrounded by tables piled three cans high with donated food, he said volunteer -
ing at the Strike Out Hunger Food Drive was his way to give back.
The operation that began Mon-
day will collect food until 7 p.m. today.Volunteers will distribute to 
area food banks Wednesday and will be distributing Thanksgiving food baskets to Gainesville fami-lies Thursday.
John Barli, volunteer coordina-
tor for Catholic Charities, said the fairgrounds saw a variety of do-nors the first day, including cars loaded with donations from doc-tors’ offices and county depart-ments.
“It’s been a big mix of every-
body,” he said.
Barli, who had been unpacking 
cardboard boxes of canned veg-etables, said this year’s goal is to put together 1,000 food baskets to give away to families. He said food supplies will also go to restock lo-cal food pantries.
“It’s kind of just spreading the 
wealth,” he said.Rodney Long, the former Ala-
chua County commissioner who began the food drive in 2008, said he expects people to rely on the drive heavily this year because more families have been affected by a declining economy.
“The need this year is greater 
than it was last year because the circumstances are worse,” Long said.
He said businesses, church-
es and organizations across Gainesville have teamed up to provide donations with about 60 to 75 volunteers.
Long said the goal of the food 
drive is to strengthen families in the Gainesville community.
“When you actually provide 
a meal to a family, it provides a sense of dignity and hope,” he said. “That’s what this is all about.”8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 2012

GatorCloud is about to 
drench UF’s campus with 
data.
At the UF Research Com-
puting Day last week at the McKnight Brain Institute, UF announced the start of pro-duction on a more modern cyberinfrastructure that uses BIGDATA, or a collection of large and complex data sets, and GatorCloud, a comput-ing system that will store data and maintain software so that users of any device can store and retrieve information without having to download a new operating system.
Director of UF High Per -
formance Computing Center Erik Deumens spoke about the campus network changes at the event. Deumens said BIGDATA and GatorCloud could make UF one of the top 10 research universities.
“UF’s infrastructure helps 
the university compete for more grants,” he said, adding that UF can attract the best re-searchers with BIGDATA.
BIGDATA and Gator -
Cloud will be introduced on a stronger form of Internet, known as Internet2. Internet2 is a nonprofit advanced net-working group that includes more than 200 American uni-versities, as well as corpora-tions, government agencies and laboratories, according to its website.
BIGDATA makes it easier 
to move files that use large amounts of memory space.GatorCloud is a data-stor -
ing cyberinfrastructure that will reduce the need for soft-ware, Deumens said.
“You used to have to print 
out a long research document and FedEx it to the research lab across the country,” he told the crowd. “Now we have the cyberinfrastructure to transport large files over long distances quickly.”
Emma Malloy, 20, a health 
science junior, said she thinks GatorCloud will be helpful to researchers.
“GatorCloud will help our 
future,” she said. “It will make re-search more 
accessible.”
V i c e 
P r e s i d e n t and Chief Informa-tion Officer 
of UF Elias Eldayrie told the audience a 10,000-square-foot data center will open in Feb-ruary 2013.
UF was awarded a Major 
Research Instrumentation Program grant for the cre-ation of
GatorCloud, Eldayrie said.Andy Li, an associate pro-
fessor for the UF Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, is working on GatorCloud. He spoke about its innovative infrastructure at the event.
“Memory is practically un-
limited on the cloud,” Li said.
He said full cloud capabili-
ties will be available in Sum-mer 2013.System helps with

� STUDENTS WITH ANY MAJOR CAN 
BE A CONVERSATION PARTNER.
SUJIE WU
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF students have the chance to meet, help 
and often befriend international students with-
out ever leaving Gainesville.
About 200 students from all over the world 
come to UF each semester, according to the UF Language Learning Center website. Students who sign up for conversation partners are matched with English-speaking volunteers. Together, they participate in the English Lan-guage Institute’s Conversation Partner Pro-gram.
The partners meet up for about an hour a 
week, or they can make up their own sched-ules. They spend at least half the time speaking in English.
“It’s really up to the students how much 
they want to get exposure to English outside of the classroom,” said Amy Bradley, a 22-year-old language assistant at ELI and linguistics graduate student.
Students of any major can volunteer, she 
said.
Most of the international students have 
never been outside of their own countries be-fore, so it can be hard for them to adjust to the new environment and language.
Carolina Diaz, an adjunct lecturer at the in-stitute, said some international students tend to congregate with people from their own countries with the same language.
“They don’t progress as fast as students 
who get out there every day , and they make friends who speak English,” Bradley said.
Nataliya Ostarova, 21, who came to UF 
from Russia about two months ago, said it was sometimes hard for her to ask people to repeat their sentences when she didn’t understand what they said. But her conversation partner makes her feel comfortable to ask any ques-tion, she said.
Being exposed to different cultures is also 
valuable for the volunteers, Diaz said.
“What’s underplayed sometimes is the 
benefit that the native speaker can get from this partnership,” she said.
Ryan Smitz, a 21-year-old conversation vol-
unteer and Spanish and linguistics junior, said he had a Brazilian conversation partner last se-mester named Rodrigo Ramalho Diniz. Even though Diniz went back to Brazil, the two still maintain their friendship.
“I know what it is [like] to struggle through 
that process and to make all those mistakes,” he said. “But I also know . . . how helpful it can be to have somebody there who is completely nonjudgmental and relatable.”
Smitz said he tries not to use “fancy words” 
for people who just started learning English.
“I try to be that one person who they don’t 
have to worry about making mistakes from,” he said.International students speak

Floyd earns weekly honor
Junior Sharrif Floyd was named the SEC Co-Defensive Lineman of the 
Week on Monday after recording ﬁ  ve tackles, three tackles for a loss and a quarterback hurry in Florida’s 14-7 win against Missouri on Saturday. UF-Jacksonville State broadcast information
UF’s game against Jacksonville State on Nov. 17 will kick off at 1 p.m. and be available via pay-per-view. A replay will air on Sun Sports at 8:30 on Sunday morning.  Chandler Cooper and UF’s other newcomers are adjusting to a new system of preparation with the season opener approaching. See story, page 14.

� SENIOR FOCUSED ON 
HELPING THE GATORS WIN. 
  JOSH JURNOVOY
 Alligator Staff Writer
   
 Mike Gillislee has new goals.
  He predicted a 1,500-yard, 
24-touchdown senior season in July at Southeastern Conference Media Days. After rushing for 146 yards and two touchdowns in Florida’s 14-6 win over LSU on Oct. 6, he was on pace to ﬁ  nish within 100 yards and six touch-downs of those marks.
  But, in the four games following 
his explosion against the Tigers, Gillislee’s averages have fallen off. He has neither scored a rushing touchdown nor run for more than 80 yards in a single game since. 
  None of that matters to Gillislee 
now. Instead, he has shifted his fo-cus away from numbers.
  “No,” Gillislee said when asked 
if he had new statistical goals in mind. “I just want to ﬁ  nish the season and win out.”
  With at least four games left to 
play, Gillislee would only need to average slightly more than 50 yards per game to become the Gators’ ﬁ  rst 1,000-yard rusher since Ciatrick Fason ran for 1,267 yards in 2004. That statistic doesn’t interest Gillislee either.
  “No, not really,” Gillislee said 
regarding whether or not the 1,000-yard mark was on his mind. “I just want to ﬁ  nish the season with a good record.”
  Florida followed the win 
against LSU with a 31-17 victory at Vanderbilt and a 44-11 win against South Carolina in The Swamp. Gillislee was held to just 104 yards on 2.9 yards per carry in the two games. During UF’s 5-0 start, he averaged 5.3 yards per rush. 
  Still, the Gators reached his 
goal of simply getting the win. 
  But they did not do so against 
Georgia. In UF’s 17-9 loss, Gillislee ran for just 77 yards on 22 carries.
  He may not have matched his 
gaudy early-season numbers on Saturday, but he still keyed Flor-ida’s offense in a 14-7 win against Missouri. Gillislee caught a 45-yard game-winning touchdown on a screen pass in the fourth  Gillislee pleased with performance despite statistical downturn

 Erika Tymrak had a successful 
regular season, but her talents have 
shined through in the postseason. 
  The senior midﬁ  elder was named 
the Southeastern Conference Of-fensive Player of the Year last week despite missing three games with an ankle injury and not ﬁ  nishing the reg-ular season ranked among the top 10 in the conference in goals or points. 
  “I got injured, and that’s the ﬁ  rst 
time I’ve ever gotten injured where I was out for a couple games,” she said. “It was really hard on me. … I’m just honored that I could get that award.”
  However, as the calendar changed 
to November and the SEC Tourna-ment began, Tymrak heated up.
  In the three games the Gators 
played en route to the SEC Tourna-ment championship, Tymrak scored three times and picked up three as-sists.
  Her three scores totaled 38 percent 
of Florida’s offense, and her nine points in the tournament accounted for one-third of the total points the Gators earned.
  For Tymrak’s efforts, the league 
named her the tournament’s most valuable player.
  “She was really remarkable this 
weekend,” coach Becky Burleigh said. “It wasn’t like she was doing all these spectacular individual things. She was just terriﬁ  c at spreading the ball out, making great decisions. … It was completely deserved when she was the MVP .”
  Tymrak was named SEC Offensive Senior thriving in postseason  
  Florida football hasn’t done much growl-
ing in recent years.
  The homecoming game, usually 
against a lesser opponent, is supposed to showcase the program to the inﬂ  ux of alumni and generate excitement among the student body.
  Instead, the Gators have experienced a 
Gator Growl hangover, and the product on the ﬁ  eld has matched the signature act from the night before: It’s been uninspiring.
  Last season, the Gators needed to recover 
a late onside kick to secure a victory against Vanderbilt.
  In the past three seasons, the homecoming 
game has been decided by an average of less than four points. Florida lost 10-7 to Missis-sippi State in 2010.
  The No. 7 Gators host the Louisiana Ragin’ 
Cajuns of the Sun Belt Conference on Satur-day. With a victory, UF would move one game closer to completing just its fourth undefeated home slate in the past 11 seasons. 
  There won’t be a homecoming loss for the 
Gators this season — I’ll bet a Josh Turner CD on that — but a Furman-type collapse is cer-tainly possible.
  That can’t happen 
for Florida. While the Ragin’ Cajuns may seem like pushovers, the Gators can’t fall back into their “win-ning ugly” ways.
  On homecoming 
weekend, with the fans clamoring for any semblance of an offense, Florida must beat Louisiana and beat it bad.
  “It starts with winning at home,” Mus-
champ said. “Having been a visitor here be-fore, I understand how difﬁ  cult it is to come in here and play well and win a game. So, I’ve tried to stress it since Day 1 with our players the importance of playing well at home and defending The Swamp.”
  Florida has to prove to its faithful that it 
is the team that thoroughly dominated LSU and not the team that squeaked past Missouri. With two non-conference laughers coming up, the Gators need a solid showing to continue to stay in any sort of BCS conversation.Even against weakling, UF 
must play well at homecoming  THE ADAM BOMBSEE GILLISLEE, PAGE 15

the 39-year history of the program and ju-
nior transfer Vicky McIntyre, the Gators have had a busy offseason meshing new talents and personalities. 
With Florida set to open its season 
against Fairfield on Friday at 4 p.m. in the O’Connell Center, things are about to get even busier. 
Having spent the offseason solely 
focused on improving themselves, the Gators are now  tasked with learning the tendencies of upcoming opponents. 
Junior Jaterra Bonds said the transition 
from focusing on Florida to studying op-ponents will be difficult for UF’s seven freshmen.
“As a freshman, it is going to seem like 
it’s another class,” Bonds said. “Not only do you have to know our plays and where to go, but you have to know the other team and their plays and their strengths and their weaknesses.”
Players spend significantly more time 
watching film in college than they did in high school. They are responsible for knowing about six plays the opponent might run, as well as which players have a tendency to drive, shoot or pass — an un-derstanding that develops through hours in the film room both individually and as a team. “It’s going to be different for them,” 
Bonds said. “But after a while, they will start to get used to it. They will be able to adapt.”
Because freshmen make up a majority 
of the roster, the coaching staff has placed high expectations on each one. 
There is no learning curve for this 
team.
“They don’t get to be freshmen,” coach 
Amanda Butler said. “That’s what is going to be next to their name on the roster, but they are going to have to play and play im-portant roles for us.”
To help the newcomers get comfortable 
with the process, the coaching staff put together a scouting report for two recent scrimmages. 
Though the scouting reports were for 
games that did not count, they were more extensive than any the freshmen had ever seen.
“You have to know who is a shooter, 
who is their best defender and if they like to run man-to-man or [zone],” freshman Christin Mercer said. “It is really challeng-ing.”Freshman Chandler Cooper said she 
has noticed a difference in intensity as the season approaches. 
The coaching staff expects the newcom-ers to have a strong understanding of the game. 
“Basketball is more than coming out 
here and playing,” Cooper said. 
“It’s a lot more intellectual than people 
realize. It’s not just go out here and make a play.”

Junior midfielder Caroline Triglia pushes the ball in Florida’s 4-0 
win against Arkansas on Sept. 30 at James G. Pressly Stadium.
“Last year, we played Furman and 
didn’t play to the level we wanted to 
play, so we know that any team can come in here and is not going to lay their hats out for us,” cornerback Jay-len Watkins said. “We want to go un-defeated in The Swamp this year.”
Ben Hill Griffin Stadium hasn’t been 
as kind to Florida as it was in the 1990s. The Gators sported a 30-game home winning streak from 1994-1998.
Florida went 9-5 at Florida Field 
from 2010-11. 
Coming into 2012, the players were 
tired of losing. Muschamp said special seasons aren’t possible without de-fending your home turf. 
“We don’t lose in The Swamp,” se-
nior running back Mike Gillislee said. “Only Gators get out alive. The past two years we lost in The Swamp, and we wanted to get it back to how it used to be.”
Muschamp called The Swamp one 
of the top arenas in sports. Florida will determine whether the energy level is high against Louisiana on Saturday. 
“It’s a really exciting time here at 
the University of Florida, and I know it’s important for us to get back in The Swamp and play well again,” Mus-champ said.Florida’s seniors will be recognized 
on the Gator Growl stage on Friday night. It’s time they put on a show come Saturday.

Coach Will Muschamp reacts to a call during Florida’s 14-7 win against 
Missouri on Saturday at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. 
quarter.
“I already knew it was a touchdown,” Omarius 
Hines said. “As soon as he caught it, I already knew, 
because that’s Gilly. That’s what Gilly does.”
In addition to the game-winning touchdown, 
Gillislee rushed for more than 4 yards per carry for the first time since UF’s win against LSU. Gillislee notched a game-high 23-yard run on his second touch. The gain was his longest since he recorded a 45-yard carry in Florida’s win against Tennessee on Sept. 15.
“I told [offensive coordinator Brent Pease] going 
into the game we were going to be a little hardhead-ed with Gilly today,” coach Will Muschamp said on Saturday. “We were going to get him today.”
Gillislee wore a shirt on Monday that read, “Run 
more than your mouth.” 
Whether the gaudy statistics return or not, he’s not 
likely to comment much. At this point, he just doesn’t want his contributions to count toward losses.
“I’m not a guy that likes to talk a lot,” Gillislee 
said. “(I) just go out there and do it.”

Gators fighting through multiple injuries
Player of the Week during the season, and on Monday 
she was picked by Top Drawer Soccer for its National Team of the Week.
Gators banged up: First-team All-SEC midfielder Jo 
Dragotta left Sunday’s match with a head injury after Auburn midfielder Ana Cate elbowed her on a jump ball.
Dragotta was on the ground for several minutes 
while trainers stabilized her head with a neck brace. She eventually walked off the field under her own power.
“She had a pretty big headache,” Burleigh said. 
“They did a CT scan and everything was normal.”
Burleigh said the team had not ruled out a concus-
sion, and that Dragotta was scheduled to undergo more evaluations on Monday. Burleigh said junior Caroline Triglia will likely start if Dragotta is not available.
Sophomore defender Annie Bobbitt did not play 
during the SEC Tournament after leaving the Gators’ Oct. 19 match against Alabama with a knee sprain.
Burleigh said before the tournament that Bobbitt would likely play but said on Monday that although Bobbitt was physically ready, the team never needed to use her. Sophomore Karina Gutsche started in Bob-bitt’s place.
“Different people have stepped up at different 
times,” Burleigh said. “We lose Kat (Williamson), our All-American, and then we replace her with Annie Bobbitt, who’s terrific. And then she gets injured, and now Karina’s playing, and she’s been awesome. She was just a monster back there this weekend.”
NCAA Tournament brackets released: On Monday af-
ternoon, the NCAA Tournament bracket was released. Florida was seeded No. 2 in its bracket and matched up with Florida Gulf Coast, which is 14-3-3 this season. The Gators will have home-field advantage through the first three rounds of the tournament, if they advance.
If Florida defeats FGCU, it will play either UCF or 
Miami in the second round. Miami defeated Florida 4-1 to begin this season, and Knights beat the Gators 3-2 in the NCAA Tournament last year. Although that loss ended Florida’s season, Burleigh doesn’t have revenge on her mind.
“I’m not even thinking about that game,” she said.SOCCER , from page 13 �RUNNING BACK MACK BROWN IS QUESTIONABLE 
AFTER SUFFERING AN ANKLE INJURY ON SATURDAY.

Injuries dominated Florida’s win against Missouri on 
Saturday, but the Gators received some good news on Mon-
day.
Buck linebacker Lerentee McCray (ankle), kick returner 
Andre Debose (knee) and left tackle Xavier Nixon (knee) are probable after not dressing against the Tigers.
Safety Matt Elam (groin), guard Jon Halapio (ankle), 
guard James Wilson (knee) and kicker Caleb Sturgis (ankle) are also probable after leaving during Saturday’s game.
Running back Mack Brown is questionable after injuring 
his ankle against Missouri.
Coach Will Muschamp and offensive coordinator Brent 
Pease are looking forward to Sturgis’ return after Florida missed two field goals on Saturday. 
“When you’re third-and-10 on the 40-yard line, I’m tell-
ing Brent, ‘Just get us 5 yards here. We need some points,’ as opposed to trying to get the first down,” Muschamp said. “You know if you get to the 35, you’re kicking a field goal. It changes the game dramatically for us, because of [Sturgis].”
Sturgis, who was dealing with swelling on his kicking 
ankle, had a 47-yard attempt blocked against the Tigers. Brad Phillips missed a 24-yard field goal attempt with 1:49 remaining in the fourth quarter that would have given the Gators a 17-7 lead.
Mann will transfer: Freshman Jafar Mann is no longer a 
Gator. He decided to transfer, Muschamp announced on Monday.
“[Mann] and I agreed that it’s time for him to move on,” 
Muschamp said.
Mann, a three-star defensive tackle prospect, was a mem-
ber of Florida’s 2012 recruiting haul, which ranked third na-tionally according to Rivals.com.
The No. 48 defensive tackle prospect in the 2012 class 
switched to guard in August. Mann played both guard and defensive tackle at Stone Mountain, Ga., Stephenson High.
“We started him off at defensive tackle,” Quinn said on 
Aug. 29. “Then we wanted to put him over at offensive line for a couple weeks and get the evaluation there. That’s kind of where we’re at with him. We took our time looking at him on defense. We’re going to do the same thing on offense.”
Brissett sticking around: When asked on Monday to de-
scribe Jacoby Brissett’s future, Muschamp said, “He’ll be a Florida Gator.”Brissett, who lost the starting quarterback battle to Jeff 
Driskel in August, has played in just three games this season and has not thrown a pass since completing 3 of 5 attempts in Florida’s 27-14 season-opening win against Bowling 
Green on Sept. 1.
Muschamp has been pleased with Bris-
sett’s attitude and commitment to the backup role.
“He’s approached it knowing he’s a 
snap away [from] walking on the field and having to win for us,” Muschamp said.
War Eagle: If Georgia loses to Auburn on 
the road this weekend, Florida will win the Southeastern Conference Eastern Division. Either UF 
or UGA will face No. 1 Alabama in the SEC Championship Game on Dec. 1 in Atlanta.
Despite the stakes of Georgia’s final SEC game, Florida 
will not pay much attention to what happens on Saturday at Jordan-Hare Stadium.
“We’re definitely going to watch the game when we get 
done, just like we did last week,” Driskel said. “But you’ve got to worry about what you can do and kind of stay focused on what we can control.”
Cornerback Jaylen Watkins added: “I wouldn’t say we 
are fans of any other SEC school, but it would be nice to see [Auburn] get a win.”
