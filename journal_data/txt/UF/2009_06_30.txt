UF’s researchers haven’t been shy about asking 
for stimulus funds for their projects.
In fact, they’ve asked for more money than all 
the other state universities combined, according to 
the Board of Governors, which oversees the 11 state 
universities.
As of June 15, UF had request-
ed a total of about $250 million in 
stimulus funds for 404 proposals, according to the board.
All the other state universities 
combined requested about $223 
million.
The University of South Flor-
ida had the next highest amount 
with about $53 million. The 
numbers may have skewed even more since then. 
As of last week, UF had put through more than 100 
additional requests, bringing the grand total to 521 
requests for funding, said Win Phillips, vice presi-
dent of research at UF.
However, Phillips said, the money has been slow 
to arrive. Only 19 proposals, worth $5.2 million, had 
been approved as of last week, he said.
“The government’s having challenges getting 
the money out because it didn’t have the process in place,” he said.UF asks for

Today, not wearing a seat belt becomes 
more dangerous to motorists, or at least to their 
wallets.
Police in Florida can now pull over drivers 
solely for not wearing their seat belts, as the in-
fraction has been bumped up to a primary of-
fense, which carries a $104 fine. 
Previously a person could only get a ticket 
for not wearing a seat belt if they were already pulled over for another traffic violation. Now not wearing a seat belt is a primary offense, and a driver can also get ticketed if the front-seat passenger is without a seat belt. 
“Now officers can take action then and there, 
instead of having to pull them over for speed-ing or some other traffic violation first,” said Lt. Tim Frith, Florida Highway Patrol spokesman.
“The whole intent of going from second to 
primary [offense] is to save lives,” Frith said. 
The law will increase the number of seat belt 
wearers, which will in turn increase the num-ber of crash survivors, he said.
According to the National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration, the law will save 124 lives, prevent 1,733 serious injuries and save $408 million in associated costs each year.
Frith said death rates are higher in traffic fa-
talities for people between 16 and 24 years old.
“We could impact that age group just by 
changing the behavior of motorists, so they know they have to buckle their seat belt,” Frith said. “[This law] will make it turn into second nature.” Fla. seat belt law tightens

When Marcus Chance received an 
A-minus in his American oral history 
class, he said that it surprised and hurt him. 
The fourth-year history major said 
it was the implication of the minus 
that bothered him the most.
“It’s like getting a paper back, and 
it’s smothered with red ink,” he said.  
“It has a negative connotation.”
Chance was late in turning in the 
last assignment and said that his lazi-ness was the reason for the A-minus, acknowledging that the grade accu-rately reflected his performance. 
Summer A was the first semester 
that professors had the option to as-sign minus grades, though it is not mandatory to use the minus system.
 The new grading scale is divided 
into increments of 0.33 points. For ex-ample, 3.33 equals B-plus, 3.0 equals B and 2.67 equals B-minus.  
A minimum grade of a C is still 
necessary to earn general education credit and to satisfy the writing and mathematics requirement, according to the Web site.

quired for President’s Honor Roll. STUDENT LIfEMinus grades make

A hungry man was arrested after cook-
ing in the kitchen of a UF fraternity house 
at 1:30 Thursday morning.
After breaking into two fraternity 
houses, Gainesville police found Alexis Dominguez in the middle of cooking french fries at the Alpha Tau Omega frat house, 207 SW 13th St.  Dominguez identified him-self as living at 513 Homeless in Lake City, according to a police report.
Earlier Thursday morning, he broke into the Phi Kappa Tau house, 1237 SW 2nd Ave., by removing an air conditioner and crawling through a window, according to the report.
Dominguez set the smoke alarm off 
while making eggs and cheese. After he was arrested by GPD, Dominguez, 46, told police he broke into the houses because he was hungry and didn’t think he could be charged with a crime.

He is urging President Barack

Nelson said it’s only fair to 
extend the protection to Haiti, be-
cause it continues years after being issued for some illegal immigrants from Central America after natural disasters there.SWAT team members from 
the Broward Sheriff’s Office were called Monday afternoon to try and speak with the woman in the Tamarac home.
Bank personnel and a moving 
van arrived at the house at about 1 p.m. to evict the woman. Offi-cials say she told them she need-ed to secure her dogs and went back inside the house. That’s when the group outside heard a gunshot.
SWAT members went into the 
home around 4 p.m. and found the woman dead with a gunshot wound to the head. The woman has not been identified.

Starting this week, slackers won’t 
even have to get dressed to catch up 
on missed lectures. 
TheNotePost.com was created by 
UF student Nick Gilboy as a cheap-
er, more convenient alternative to 
similar services Smokin’ Notes and Einstein Notes.
The notes will cost $7 per section of testing material, which is less than 
half the cost of Smokin’ Notes and 
Einstein’s Notes. Students will be able to view the notes online or print them from the site, which will be up-dated daily.
“I think updating the site daily 
is a great idea. It would allow me to stay more on top of my class and re-ally let me learn the material instead 
of memorizing it all the week be-
fore,” said UF junior Julie Novac.The site will include the class 
notes, textbook chapter summaries, 
flashcards, class announcements and practice tests.
“The Note Post is for all of us 
who want to save money on course 
notes and spend it on something else,” said Gilboy, theNotePost.com’s creative director and creator. “Like any student who has paid for notes, we knew we could bring you top quality notes, cheaper.”
TheNotePost.com is hiring note 
takers for Summer B. Interested stu-dents can visit the “jobs @ notepost” area of the Web site to apply. 
Note takers earn a commission 
from sales of their class notes. That way, Gilboy said, note takers are motivated to go to their classes and pay attention.
“For any large class, it would be 
very easy for one of our note takers to make over $1,000 per semester,” Gilboy said. “It’s good money when 
you’re being paid to be a good stu-
dent.”
� WOMEN WILL MAKE UP 60
PERCENT OF INCOMING FRESHMEN.
By SARA WATSON
Alligator Writer
Perhaps men really are from Mars.
Male students at UF are becoming increas-
ingly alien as female enrollment grows. 
Data show that the female student popu-
lation at UF has outnumbered the male pop-
ulation over the past 10 years and has contin-
ued to rise. This fall, women will comprise 60 percent of incoming freshmen.
The increasing number is not about innate 
ability, but rather women’s organizational abilities and tendency to set and reach goals, said Mary Ann Clark, an associate professor 
in the College of Education who researches male underachievement in public education. 
“I don’t think colleges and universities seek to admit more female students, but in general, the applicant pool of women is 
stronger as a group,” Clark said. 
“They are showing higher GPAs, more 
advanced course work in high school and are 
involved in more extracurricular and leader-
ship activities than men as a group.” 
The increase in females is not restricted 
to UF. Female enrollment tops 60 percent in 
five of Florida’s 11 state universities. Nation-
ally, women comprise 57 percent of college 
enrollment. This trend is projected to contin-ue through 2015, according to the National 
Center for Educational Statistics. 
In addition, flagship universities like 
University of North Caroline at Chapel Hill 
“have been 60 percent female for quite a few 
years,” Clark said.
In the past, people assumed men would 
“land on their feet” and did not need help in 
school, Clark said.
But now that women outnumber men in college, and recent data show that women in their 20s earn more than men in the same age 
group in big cities, admission offices are en-couraging more males to apply, she said.
The gender gap at the college level can af-
fect marriage and family patterns as well as economic patterns, Clark said.
“Numbers in enrollment matter,” said 
Milagros Pena, director of the Center for 
Women’s Studies and Gender Research.
Pena said that gender diver-
sity enriches the college experi-ence and helps students prepare 
for a globalized world. 
“I think this is significant and welcomed, 
and of course we want to encourage young 
men to seek higher education,” Pena said. 
“But we are also still challenged by inequi-
ties in pay and access to opportunities, even 
as educated women.” 
Pena said it is also important to see if the 
increase in numbers translates for women in less traditional professions like engineering.
While the majority of UF’s colleges are 
dominated by women in terms of popu-lation, engineering is one of two colleges 
where women are outnumbered, Clark said. The second is business administration. 
Women are entering the engineering field 
and taking advantage of UF’s status as the 
top-ranked engineering program in Florida, 
said Andrea Eckstrom, a senior majoring in 
mechanical engineering. 
“I didn’t initially choose engineering be-
cause there are fewer women involved in the field. It was just something I had always wanted to do,” Eckstrom said. 
However, Eckstrom said people ques-
tioned her ability to succeed in engineering in high school and her freshman year of col-
lege.
“Not being taken seriously can be a huge 
motivator. I felt like I had something to prove,” she said. STUDENT LIFEWeb site offers cheap alternative to notes services

Gainesville tobacco shops may find it tough 
to survive under a Food and Drug Administra-
tion regulation, which was recently signed into law by President Barack Obama.
The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco 
Control Act illegalizes clove, candy, fruit and spiced cigarettes to curb youth-focused market-ing. Menthol flavoring is an exception.
Additionally, the use of words such as “light” 
and “mild” will be banned by July 2010, and to-bacco product ingredients will be required to ap-pear on packaging, according to a White House Press release. 
Nazim Uddin, owner of Gator Tobacco, said 
business has already slowed down since the law was passed. 
“It is affecting us big time,” Uddin said. “This 
law was a big surprise.”
Uddin does not believe that banning flavored 
cigarettes will prevent kids from smoking; how-ever, he said he does think that it may eventually mean the end of his store.
“We have to pay the rent. We have to pay the 
employees. The day is going to come that we are going to close down,” Uddin said.
Pat Patton, an owner of Modern Age Tobacco, 
is a bit more optimistic.
“There’s no telling [what is to come] really 
until it happens, until we’ve been dealing with it for a couple of weeks,” Patton said. “People 
aren’t going to quit smoking. I’m curious to see 
what they’re going to change to.” 
Hookah tobacco is exempt from the flavored 
tobacco prohibition; however the law will double the price of the product, according to Nick Farah, owner of Farah’s on the Avenue.
“The law really doesn’t affect us except on a 
tax structure basis. Next time we buy, I’m sure that the cost of goods will be greater. But I don’t believe it will affect our business,” Farah said. 
According to Maureen Miller, health educa-
tor with UF’s GatorWell, the new law may not 
directly impact the smoking habits of current UF 
students but might have an effect on future sta-tistics.
“If it helps prevent younger children from 
smoking, then a few years down the road it may have an impact on our future students,” Miller said. “But we’re not going to see a change in rates overnight.”LOcALAct bans flavored cigarettes

Infomercial star dies at 50
� HE MAY HAVE DIED 
FROM A HEART ATTACK.
TAMPA, Fla. — Television 
pitchman Billy Mays likely 
died of a heart attack in his sleep, but further tests are needed to be sure of the cause 
of death, a medical examiner 
said Monday.
Hillsborough County Medical Examiner Vernard 
Adams said Mays suffered 
from hypertensive heart dis-ease, and the wall of the left 
ventricle of Mays’ heart and the wall of one of his arter-
ies were enlarged.
The boisterous, bearded 
50-year-old known for hawk-ing OxiClean and other prod-ucts on national commercials 
was found dead Sunday by 
his wife in their Tampa con-dominium. 
“While it provides some 
closure to learn that heart disease took Billy from us, it certainly doesn’t ease the enormous void that his death has created” his wife, Debo-
rah, said in a statement.

LOS ANGELES — Michael Jackson’s fam-
ily moved quickly Monday to take control of 
his complicated personal and financial affairs, winning temporary custody of his three chil-dren and asking a judge to name the King of 
Pop’s mother as administrator of his estate.
In documents filed in Superior Court, Jack-
son’s parents said they believe their 50-year-
old son died without a valid will.
They also made it clear they believe they 
should take charge of both his debt-ridden but potentially lucrative financial empire and act as permanent caretakers of his three children.
Judge Mitchell Beckloff granted 79-year-old 
Katherine Jackson temporary guardianship of the children, who range in age from 7 to 12. He did not immediately rule on her requests to take charge of the children’s and Jackson’s estates. Beckloff scheduled a hearing for July 6 and another for Aug. 3 to consider those issues and whether Katherine Jackson should be ap-pointed the children’s permanent guardian.
The judge later on Monday also granted 
Katherine Jackson the right to take control of her son’s personal property that is now in the hands of an unnamed third party. The ruling 
does not detail the nature of those items and does not provide control of any mon-ey in the estate.
L. Londell McMillan, the 
family’s attorney, said in a statement that the Jacksons are pleased with the results of their Monday filings.
“Mrs. Jackson deserves 
custody, and the family should have the ad-ministration of the brilliance of Mr. Michael Jackson. Mrs. Jackson is a wonderful, loving 
and strong woman with a special family many 
of us have admired for years. The personal and legal priorities are focused on first protect-ing the best interests of Mr. Michael Jackson’s children, his family, his memorial services and then preserving his creative and business leg-acy with the dignity and honor it deserves.” When Jackson died Thursday, he left behind a 12-year-old son and 11-year-old daughter by 
his ex-wife Deborah Rowe, as well as a 7-year-
old son born to a surrogate mother. NewsState

Santa Fe places 
sixth in rankings
By ALISHA KINMAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
After awarding 2,710 associ-
ate degrees last year, Santa Fe 
College topped national charts by placing sixth in the nation in Community College Week’s 
Top 100 Best Associate Degree 
Producers for 2009.
On June 15, the publication 
named SFC sixth in the nation for two-year institutions and 
12th in the nation for four-year 
colleges that also award associ-ate degrees. 
The rankings are based on 
the amount of degrees awarded during the 2007-2008 academic 
year. At that time, the college 
was still Santa Fe Community College, a two-year institution.
SFC ranked higher than oth-
er Florida  community college competitors, beating Tallahas-see Community College, Hills-borough Community College and Brevard Community Col-
lege.
SFC is continuing to further 
expand its  institution by offer-
ing bachelor’s degrees in applied 
science, clinical and laboratory 
science and health services ad-ministration starting in August, according to a press release.�PRISON TERM SIMILAR 
TO TERRORISTS.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
NEW YORK  — A federal 
judge rejected Bernard Madoff’s 
plea for leniency Monday, sen-tencing the 71-year-old swin-dler to spend the rest of his life 
in prison for an “extraordinarily 
evil” fraud that took a staggering toll on thousands of victims.
U.S. District Judge Denny 
Chin cited the unprecedented nature of the multibillion-dollar fraud as he sentenced Madoff to the maximum of 150 years in prison, a term comparable only 
to those given in the past to ter-
rorists, traitors and the most vio-lent criminals. There is no parole in federal prison so Madoff will most likely die there.
“Here, the message must be 
sent that Mr. Madoff’s crimes were extraordinarily evil and that this kind of irresponsible 
manipulation of the system is 
not merely a bloodless financial crime that takes place just on pa-per, but it is instead ... one that takes a staggering human toll,” Chin said.
The massive Ponzi scheme 
run by Madoff since at least the 
early 1990s demolished the life 
savings of thousands of people, wrecked charities and shook confidence in the U.S. financial 
system.
Only Madoff 
and an accoun-tant accused of failing to make 
basic auditing checks have faced criminal charges. But a person familiar with the investigation said Monday that 10 more peo-ple would face federal charges by the time the probe is com-plete. The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing, 
wouldn’t detail potential charges 
or say whether the 10 would in-clude Madoff’s family or former employees.
Madoff’s 150-year sentence re-
flected a growing tendency over the last decade to give white-collar criminals lengthy prison terms — although a handful of cases have received even longer terms. The outcome prompted scattered applause and whoops from a group of burned former 
clients in a packed Manhattan 
courtroom. The judge noted that not one of the more than 100 let-ters he received supported Mad-off or described any good deeds he had done.
“The absence of such support 
is telling,” Chin said.
Chin announced the sentence 
with Madoff standing at the de-fense table, wearing a dark suit, a white shirt and a tie and look-ing thinner than he did at his last court appearance in March. He gave no noticeable reaction when the sentence was announced.
He showed no emotion 
though he looked down ear-
lier in the hearing as he listened 
to nine victims spend an hour venting their despair and anger. Some openly wept or raised their voices, labeling Madoff a “mon-ster,” “a true beast” and an “evil low-life.”

For lying to his constitu-
ency and for losing all credibility over his af-
fair with a woman in South America, the Editorial Board 
would like to call for the resig-
nation of Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina. 
After Sanford lied to the 
press and said that he would be hiking the Appalachian Trail, a series of leaked e-mails led a reporter to sniff  him out at the airport upon his return 
from Argentina.
When questioned about 
his whereabouts, Sanford 
said he had been in Argentina because he wanted to travel somewhere exotic.
But, later that day, Sanford 
found out his e-mails had been leaked and immediately 
held a press conference detail-
ing the nature of his yearlong affair with a woman from Buenos Aires.
 Although the press con-
ference appeared candid, the Editorial Board is still left wondering how Sanford could appear so forthcoming and yet refrain from telling the press anything at all.
For instance: Is Sanford 
going to resign? Is he going to continue his affair? But most importantly: Can the people of South Carolina have any trust in him at all, after he lied only until he couldn’t get away with it anymore? 
We think that any politi-
cian who makes a point of cre-
ating political advertisements 
espousing their piety and commitment to family values should stick to those values or resign. 
A hint for politicians: If 
you’re going to have extra-marital affairs, whether it be with a guy in a bathroom, a 
woman from “someplace ex-
otic,” or a $60,000 “escort,” don’t do it right after airing a holier-than-thou TV spot. It’s not the affair that ruins a ca-reer, it’s the raging hypocrisy and misrepresentation.Students returning to Gainesville for Summer B classes 
may notice something missing from outside the Fine Arts building: Art.
A stainless steel sculpture that graced the side of Southwest 
13th Street for 35 years was vandalized between summer se-
mesters and has been replaced by a giant planter. It was built by the late Geoffrey Naylor, an internationally renowned artist and former UF professor.
The vandals ripped out pipes that allowed water to flow 
from the sculpture. The damages would cost at least $40,000 to repair, according to The Gainesville Sun article.
The Editorial Board can’t help but wonder what was going 
on in the heads of the vandals, presuming they have anything going on up there at all. The willful destruction of public prop-erty is immature; the willful destruction of art is deplorable.
The Editorial Board also extends sympathy to Naylor’s wife 
and former students, who have expressed that Naylor would have wanted the sculpture to be repaired. Unfortunately, the vandalism comes at a time when UF’s budget doesn’t allow for such a repair.
And to the UF officials who have stated that the sculpture 
will be scrapped: Certainly something else can be done with the sculpture, even if it is not put back into place. An auction, per-haps? There was also a lot of unoccupied grass beside the Reitz Union last time we checked. And, no matter how hard we try to get our brains to cooperate, we just can’t put “giant steel sculp-ture” into the same category as “crushed Yuengling cans” and “discarded Steak n Shake coupon fliers.”
Obviously the sculpture wouldn’t function as a fountain 
anymore if it was moved, but it would still serve as a memorial 
to the professor who built it.
Like a bad version of “The Blair Witch Project,” ama-
teur video of riots and protests in Iran fill CNN’s air-
waves. Covering the turmoil in Iran has become en 
vogue, and publicly declaring one’s alignment with Mir-Hossein Mousavi, the emblematic opposition candidate 
who lost in the last Iranian rigged election three weeks ago, has become as culturally trendy for some as a Free Tibet 
bumper sticker.
There’s something powerful about watching all of the 
protests. Threatened with tear gas, billy clubs, physical in-jury and even death, millions have taken to the streets of 
Iran in defiance of the Supreme Leader, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Maybe it’s because we like rooting for the un-
derdog, or because as Americans we can’t stand to sit idly 
by as other nation’s pseudo-democracies crumble, but sup-porting the protestors in any way has become a patriotic duty.
In Los Angeles, thousands of Iranian-Americans and oth-
er Americans of all national backgrounds joined together in 
protests to show their solidarity with the Mousavi support-
ers in Iran.  On Twitter, thousands have turned their avatars a shade of green, the color most associated with Mousavi’s 
campaign. And in Washington, D.C., both houses of Con-
gress passed near unanimous resolutions condemning the state-sponsored violence and the obviously rigged presi-
dential election.
Now, many say, is the time for our president to act.
Eric Cantor, the skipper of the rudderless and beaten ship 
that is the modern Republican Party, has called for President Barack Obama to speak more forcefully about the newest Iranian situation. Conservatives, after all, have never been very conservative with their foreign policy approach, eulo-
gizing the virtues of small government but never shrinking 
from the vices of big military intervention abroad.
Obama, for the most part, has remained stoically cool as 
ever. “The Iranian government must understand that the world is watching,” Obama wrote in his official White House statement 
earlier this week.
The whole world is certainly 
watching, but why?
Why have the media started to 
binge drink shots of Iranian election coverage? Why, all of a sudden, has 
being well-versed with the turmoil in Iran been a necessity for checkout-
line conversation in the Whole Foods and Fresh Markets of the country?
Why isn’t Darfur on the tip of everyone’s tongue? Is a 
massacre in broad daylight not sensational enough? Why aren’t the chatty newsreaders reading news about Robert Mugabe’s blatant ignorance of the Zimbabwe provisional government guidelines rather than reading catty remarks 
from their Twitter followers? Are any credible public fig-
ures outraged that the latest incarnation of a Burmese con-
stitution still gives the national military the most power in 
the Asian nation?
There are hundreds of mini-Irans across the world, 
where votes are never counted and dissidence is meted out with bullets and unjust detention. Likely, it is very near impossible to shed light on every one of these hot spots of 
death and oppression.
We do need to pay attention to Iran, and we need to 
stand by those in Iran who are demanding more rights, more freedom.
But let us not forget the lives that hang in perilous bal-
ance throughout the world. Calling for freedom and true 
democracy should never be a self-interested act. History has 
already seen too many self-interested calls for democracy. 
They have all been bloody.

Just like the Corleones and the Tattaglias.
This was the memorable phrase I recently read 
in a BBC news report on the current troubles in
Iran. A large portion of these troubles can be traced 
to the strong and colorful personalities, which are the 
driving forces in post-revolution Iran.
The current protests and the corresponding police 
crackdown come as a result of the disputed presiden-tial election, which put hard-liner Mahmoud “The Holocaust Was Fake” Ahmadinejad back in power. The runner-up, the more reformist Mir-Hossein 
Mousavi, has charged voting irregularities, intimida-
tion and election fraud. This 
assertion has been tentatively supported by such indepen-dent think tanks as London’s Chatham House. For example, in areas that were showing ex-treme support for Mousavi, Ahmadinejad was reported to have done far better than ex-pected— to a degree that has 
been characterized as “highly improbable.” And so charges were levied, and the people joined the battle for the soul of Iran. 
It isn’t really Iran’s president that holds ultimate 
power, so it isn’t entirely Ahmadinejad and Mousavi that are driving these events. Speaking in terms of “The Godfather,” they are not the Corleones and Tatt-aglias spoken of — more like the Pentangeli and the 
Rosato brothers. Instead, it is former President Akbar 
Hashemi Rafsanjani and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who are the powerful men butting 
heads behind the scenes. The reasoning is not hard 
to fathom. Ahmadinejad is a supporter of the status quo and supports power concentration in the hands of the supreme leader — and so Khamenei backed 
him. Mousavi is a reformist and seeks to move certain 
powers, specifically control of Iran’s nuclear capacity and police forces, away from the supreme leader and into the hands of the President — and so reformist Rafsanjani backed him. These are the two most pow-
erful men in Iran and both are, like Keyser Soze, the 
kinds of men who can wrangle the wills of men.
Shortly after the protests began, Khamenei issued 
a public proclamation that any further protests would 
be met with police action, and the leaders would be 
held responsible. There was a Mousavi-supported protest scheduled for the following day, and the me-dia were abuzz with questions over whether it would proceed. 
In the end, it did, with Mousavi going so far as to 
say that he is “ready for martyrdom.” Don’t mistake the language — he urged his supporters to practice nonviolence. In the ensuing chaos, there were several arrests by the Khamenei-loyal police force. Among 
these arrests were several family members of Raf-
sanjani, including his daughter. They were released shortly thereafter, but there is no doubt the arrest was meant to send a message. Undeterred, the Rafsanjani-
Mousavi opposition is not backing down.
And so we will wait, and watch and see where 
things go from here. Personally, I’m hoping for Ah-
madinejad’s defeat only because it diminishes his chances of ever becoming supreme leader, and the 
thought of a supreme leader who denies the Holo-
caust and has access to nuclear power is just too vul-gar for my tastes. 
As Obama issues messages telling Iran that the 
West is watching, I doubt that many people there care. The Iranians on both sides of this issue are fight-ing for what they perceive to be the right thing for their country, and it’s arrogant for any other nation to 
assume that its opinion matters. Beginning Monday, 
the Iranian legislature started recounting a random 10 percent of ballots to check for irregularities. 
Let’s hope that all goes well, before Iran’s young 
democracy sleeps with the fishes.

The gay marriage debate has evolved 
from a whisper of discontent to a 
roaring, mud-slinging brawl. The 
situation could be mildly called a snafu, and more accurately termed something I 
can’t print in the paper. Everyone has an 
opinion; not only do people stand on both 
sides of and astride the metaphorical fence, 
there are people tunneling underneath 
and flying overhead. With courts and leg-islatures making and reversing decisions 
like a toddler flicks a light switch, it’s time 
to think outside the box and tear down the 
fence: abolish marriage altogether.
The solution, first suggested by two 
law professors and published in the San 
Francisco Chronicle, isn’t as revolution-
ary as it sounds. Marriage, as a religious 
institution, has no place in the govern-ment, as evidenced by the brawl between 
conservative Christians and gay rights 
activists. Marriage should be relegated to 
the church and gay and straight couples 
should receive the same recognition from 
the government: a document that recog-
nizes them as a family.It’s impos-
sible, from a 
secular position, 
to defend deny-
ing a segment 
of the population a right that is given in-discriminately to any male-female couple 
who are older than 18 years old. Beliefs 
that gay couples would get divorced more 
often or be ill-suited to raise children have been proven myth. The only defense is a 
religious one. 
The real issue at the heart of the gay 
marriage debate is that of separation of 
church and state, another one that’s been 
argued over, under and every other way 
around. Personally, I think separation of 
church and state is one of the best things 
to ever happen in this country. 
While the debate over separation of 
church and state may never end, a strong precedent has been set. Baptisms, bat 
mitzvahs, confirmations and all other re-
ligious rites require no license and afford 
no benefits from the government. Why 
marriage?Gay rights activists aren’t asking for 
the church’s blessing — they aren’t asking 
for a holy union — they’re simply asking 
for the same legal recognition and benefits 
afforded straight couples. We’ll have to 
come up with a new name for marriage in 
the eyes of the state, which is sure to be an 
argument in itself. Marriage is definitely 
out, and civil union has received a certain 
amount of stigma after it was offered up as a not-quite-as-good alternative. We could 
call it a legal union, official bond, part-
nered or even hitched. It doesn’t matter, 
as long as it’s the same for everyone.
The argument for abolishing marriage 
practically makes itself; it makes perfect 
sense: Christians can continue to impose 
whatever restrictions they wish on mar-
riage without the government trying to tell them what it is and isn’t. Meanwhile, 
gay rights activists get the equal rights 
they’ve been asking for. I really can’t see a 
“con” position. It’s time to be fair to every-
one, let’s tear down this fence.

Generation missed Jackson’s ‘Thriller’ yearsGuest column
Millennials only got to 
see the Michael Jack-
son that was a freak. 
And even if we do compre-
hend the awesome 1980s ver-sion, we lack the context to 
appreciate his awesomeness. If 
you can’t remember the begin-ning of something, it’s difficult 
to realize its perfection.
It requires a tremendous 
amount of effort to watch the 
25th Motown anniversary performance or the “Thriller” 
video, or anything else Mi-
chael Jackson may have been involved with, and not retroac-
tively read into it like it’s some 
premonition of imminent doom.
It’s like Britney, except she’s just one toy carousel compared to Michael Jackson’s entire 
Neverland Ranch. Two years 
ago her hypothetical death seemed like it might be a re-lief for her. Now we’re all in 
the bell jar together, mildly 
to moderately charmed by her black hearted music, but 
can anyone really imagine a 
50-year-old Britney?
Michael Jackson got to the 
point where death was sort of the only out. There was no 
comeback left.
Last night, Joe Posnan-
ski compared the response of those born in the last 20 
years, for whom the shimmer-ing Michael Jackson of Bil-
lie Jean can only be captured through YouTube and a hearty 
gulp of imagination, to his own 
when Elvis Presley died. Elvis 
was famous for being famous — the tangible experience of his music was 20 years past.
Eventually, though, if you 
watch Michael Jackson sing Billie Jean enough, Michael 
Jackson becomes mesmerizing. 
He was a person completely in possession of every synapse in 
his body, the external motion 
seamlessly flowing with the music and lyrics, total control 
of every movement he made. Ironic, since he clearly had no 
real control.
Context is everything, 
though. And, if we buddy up to context, we can revel in and respect the flamboyant perfec-
tion of the awesome Michael 
Jackson, the one who single-handedly launched MTV with 
“Thriller,” rather than every-
thing we otherwise know about 
him. Even without context, the 
past is still captivating.
The real tragedy is in the 
loss of that perfection for him-self, and perhaps even more so in the accompanying loss of the 
collective cultural innocence 
that propelled his dominance.

 How much does UF’s athletic 
department love the university? 
Something to the tune of $6 mil-lion.
The University Athletic As-
sociation’s board of directors ap-proved a $6 million contribution Monday to help UF with its $42.2 million budget cut, which goes into effect on Wednesday.
“It’s only right that you assist 
where you can,” Athletics Direc-tor Jeremy Foley said.
The size of the contribution 
could end up even larger if UF’s sports teams do well, and licens-ing revenue from sales of UF mer-chandise increases, said Melissa Stuckey, a UAA associate control-ler. UF and the athletic department split licensing revenue 50-50.
Large contributions to UF are 
nothing new for the department. It’s expected that the contribution will total about $4.4 million for the current ﬁ  scal year, which ends today, according to UF ﬁ  gures. 
The UAA also contributed 
about $9.6 million in the 2007-2008 ﬁ  scal year and has given about $53 million to the university since the 1990-1991 ﬁ  scal year, according to 
its ﬁ  gures. Those numbers include 
licensing revenues.
In order to make the contri-
bution this year, the department made 10 percent cuts to discre-tionary spending, like travel and equipment. Each sport, for exam-ple, was asked to make a 10 per-cent cut to its budget.
The UAA’s board also ap-
proved an increase of about $5.9 million in the department’s bud-get for the 2009-2010 ﬁ  scal year on Monday, raising it to about $89 million. 
The current ﬁ  scal year’s rev-
enues are projected to come in about $6 million short of where 
they were expected to be.
That should all change next 
year, with projected revenues bal-
looning mostly due to a $6.2 mil-lion increase in TV payments from a new SEC contract with CBS and ESPN.
Though revenues from football 
and men’s basketball are expected to be down about $1.1 million in the next ﬁ  scal year, the two sports 
still carry the athletic department. 
About 66 percent of all revenues come from football, while basket-ball accounts for 9 percent. On the other hand, about 15 percent of the budget is spent on football and 8 percent on men’s basketball.
The budget for the next ﬁ  scal 
year also includes about $400,000 
in expenses for the newly added 
women’s lacrosse program, in ad-dition to about $288,000 in schol-arships for the players, accord-ing to Stuckey. The players are expected to start practicing this summer and will be competing in spring of 2010.
The lacrosse stadium, currently 
under construction on Hull Road, across from the Southwest Recre-ation Center, should be completed by next month.

The death of Michael Jackson has 
spurred a debate on how the pop 
king and accused child molester 
should be remembered, and UF pop 
culture professors are just as split as the rest of the nation.
“No one in pop music his-
tory transcended such diverse age groups, races, nationalities and cul-tures,” said Ji Hoon Lee, instructor for Rock ‘n’ Roll and American So-ciety Pt. 2 at UF. 
Jackson was also heavily in-
volved in charity. He was honored by George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan, said David Kushner, UF’s music professor.
But, he was also accused of child 
molestation on two separate instanc-es in the past 15 years.
The negativity surrounding Mi-
chael Jackson will affect his legacy and ultimate standing in the minds of people around the world, Kush-ner said.  
“I don’t think it’s going to be 
enough to cover up his enormous contribution to the music world,” he said.
Lee said that he spoke with his 
class Monday about Jackson’s death because he wants the generation to remember more about Jackson than the accusations.      “Just pick up a copy of ‘Thriller,’ 
and you will remember him for the artist that he is,” he said.
The pop star was a victim of 
America’s fascination with celebri-ties, and the focus needs to stay on the musical side of his life and ca-reer, he said. 
But William McKeen, a rock ‘n’ 
roll historian at UF, said Jackson has been irrelevant to music for the past 10 to 15 years. 
Jackson, who at one point seemed 
invincible, turned into an eccentric boy-child, he said.
However, McKeen said the news 
of Jackson’s death clearly reminded him of the day Elvis died. 
“It’s a generational shock wave,” 
he said. “It reminds you of your mortality.”10, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JUNE 30, 2009
UF professors split on Michael Jackson’s death

There will no longer be a quiet 
oasis outside the University Gal-
leries on the East side of UF’s campus.
After a 34-year stint, “Water 
Sculpture” has been removed due to vandalism, and the sounds of water trickling down the massive metal sculpture will be replaced with a planter.
“We’re all very sad it was van-
dalized to the extent that required us to remove it,” said Denise Krig-baum, UF College of Fine Arts 
Communications Coordinator. “I 
do feel the sculpture was a sym-bol of the College and the univer-sity.”
The sculpture was removed 
last week after vandals damaged the piping inside the fountain that allowed water to flow over the sculpture.
“It wasn’t the university’s fault 
for taking it down,” she said. “It was the person who vandalized it.”
Commissioned in 1975 and cre-
ated by Jeoffrey Naylor, a former UF sculpture professor, the stain-less steel structure initially cost $20,000.
It was paid for by grants from 
art endowments, UF student gov-ernment and the University Bud-
get Commission,  Krigbaum said.
Thirty-four years later, more 
than three times its expected 
lifespan, the Physical Plant De-
partment was asked by the Col-
lege of Fine Arts to remove the fountain.
“It was expensive to maintain 
because there were a lot of pranks 
done involving the sculpture,” 
Krigbaum said. “ It’s understood that its lifetime is made to be lim-ited.”
Over the years, UF fine arts 
students have been known to con-tribute to the sculpture by adding soap or Jello as a right of passage.
“I think that it has been well 
loved over the years,” she said. “Some of that love took its toll.”
Two main obstacles stood in 
the way of repairing the sculpture: 
cost and artistic integrity.
It would cost an estimated 
$40,000 to repair the fountain, ac-
cording to Krigbaum, a number which upset some students at UF.
“Dumping money into fix-
ing the fountain is not worth it,” said Ashley Neukamm, a senior fine arts major. “ I’d rather have 
my faculty be there on call when 
I need them instead of pouring money into the maintenance for the fountain.”
The 24-foot-wide, 8-foot-tall sculpture is now in storage and will be recycled by the Physical Plant Department.
“Even if we could repair it, 
there are ethics involved when an artist creates a piece,” Krigbaum said. “It has been damaged be-yond repair and couldn’t meet the artist’s initial intent.”
As students walk by the empty 
plaza outside of the University Gallery, the sights and sounds of 13th Street are forever changed.
“I feel like it’s something the art 
department is known for,” Neu-kamm said. “It’s like the equiva-
lent of taking down the french 
fries or the potato in Turlington.”ON CAMPUS

� THIS IS THE THIRD SHOW ON 
THEIR U.S. TOUR.  
By EMILY FUGGETTA
Alligator Staff Writer
efuggetta@alligator.org
Despite the band’s name, there’s nothing 
ordinary about the Plain White T’s’ current 
tour.
Tonight’s show at the Venue is the third 
U.S. stop on the Plain White T’s’ Three-Part Harmony Tour, and frontman Tom Higgen-son said the concept is completely fresh.
The shows, which run about an hour and 
15 minutes, begin with an upbeat stream of songs.
“We come out rockin’ in the beginning like we normally would at a Plain White T’s show,” he said. “Then we break it down and do an acoustic set.”
The band sets up stools at the front of the 
stage to create a more interactive vibe with the 
audience, Higgenson said.
“We get more into it with the crowd,” he 
said. “Kind of like an MTV: Unplugged ses-
sion.”
The third act is a medley of fan favorites, 
transitioned fluidly.
“There’s like 25 minutes of straight songs 
woven into each other musically,” he said.
The tour’s style is not only new to the T’s 
but to musicians in general, Higgenson said.
“Bands don’t really do that kind of thing,” 
he said. “So we decided to try it out, and I think people are really appreciating it.”
After about eight years of performing, Hig-genson said the band developed the three-part show idea as a way to keep the experience fresh.
“To me, this is more of an event,” he said. 
“We knew that going to a bunch of smaller 
clubs there wasn’t going to be a light show or 
crazy production on stage, 
so we thought, musically, what can we do to make this more interesting?”
Higgenson said the band especially tries to 
keep it exciting in smaller towns where the fan base isn’t necessarily as developed.
Shows in cities like New York and Los An-
geles often sell out, Higgenson said.
“But I think people get more excited about 
shows in small towns. Maybe it means more to them,” he said. “Even if people don’t know the music, they came and they’re going to hear it, so hopefully they leave singing some songs.”
Higgenson, who said although his attempts 
at being the band’s jokester often fall flat, the band members don’t fulfill any stereotypical roles and get along—mostly.
“We fight every once in a while and argue 
about stupid things, but we get along pretty well. We know how to push each other’s but-tons, so we try not to do that…unless we’re mad,” Higgenson said with a laugh.
But the touring experience is really all 
about the fans, he said, and the reception of the Harmony Tour has been overwhelmingly positive.
“I think when you take risks and do things 
that are more artistic and different, it pays off in the end. That’s what we’re seeing now,” he said. “The best shows are when the audience gets rowdy. That feeds us.” Plain White T’s to introduce three-part show to locals

The failing grade UF’s College 
of Medicine received on a recent 
American Medical Student Associa-tion PharmFree Scorecard is being changed to “in progress.”
The 2009 Scorecard, conducted by 
the American Medical Student As-sociation, along with The Pew Pre-scription Project, based the industry and school relationship grades on how well students and faculty are shielded from free samples, money 
and educational incentives offered 
by pharmaceutical companies. 
The college failed for not provid-
ing information to the 2009 AMSA PharmFree Scorecard and declining to participate in the 2008 Scorecard, while both Florida State Univer-sity and the University of Miami received Bs.  
But Timothy Flynn, senior asso-
ciate dean of clinical affairs for the College of Medicine, said he was never informed about the request for the college’s conflict of interest 
policy. 
“Had they told us, we would 
have been happy to send it in,” Fly-
nn said. “We have nothing to hide.” 
Flynn said the college recently re-
vised its original Industry Conflicts of Interest Policy, which was created in 1995, customizing it more to UF. 
“[AMSA] is the least knowledge-
able [in conflicts of interest policies],” Flynn said, referring to the fact that AMSA is an organization made up of medical students. “[No offense to them, but] they’re not even in the 
profession yet. We’re doing this be-
cause we feel it’s the right thing to do, not because of them.”
In an e-mail sent to AMSA’s 2009 
Scorecard Director Branden Pfef-ferkorn, Flynn said that Mike Good, dean of the College of Medicine, and himself were unaware of the 2008 request.
In response to the e-mail, AMSA 
agreed to change the score from fail-ing to “in progress.”  
The college’s new policy, which began revision in early 2008, in-
cludes tightening rules on free gifts, 
money, fellowships and sponsor-ships, teaching aids, samples and education from pharmaceutical companies. 
Flynn said the new policy was 
necessary due to the changing re-lationships between the industries and the colleges. 
“We set up a process to control 
samples, but still maintain ability for patients who can’t afford [drugs and antibiotics],” Flynn said. 
UF ACADEMICSFailing grade removed from med school scorecard
The system captures a precise notion of 
what students accomplish in class, said Rich-ard Yost, past Faculty Senate chairman.
UF was late in changing the grading sys-
tem to match the one used by its peer institu-
tions, Yost said. 
Out of 11 universities in the state, only 
New College of Florida does not use minus grades. 
“A lot of professors are hesitant to give out 
the perfect A but may feel that the student 
did better than a B-plus,” said Jordan John-son, student body president. “This gives pro-fessors the option to reward students just as much as it does punish them.”
However, he said, students should have 
had input when the decision was made at a Faculty Senate meeting in 2006.
“If you’re close to an A all the time but keep getting Bs, you’re a winner,” history ma-jor Darrel Meckley said. “If you’re a 93 per-cent student, you’re getting screwed.” 
French professor Heloise C. 
Seailles said students do not understand that the new system works to their advantage. If a 
student works hard and makes progress, the professor might consider raising their C-plus to a B-minus, whereas in the past she would not have considered raising such a grade to a B.
“We care about our students, and I don’t 
think we are doing you any favors by treating you like babies,” she said. “We want to pre-pare you for the world.”
Faculty Senate chairman Jack Mecholsky 
said it is a good experiment that will benefit 
students in the long run. 
If students and faculty are not happy after 
a couple of years, he said, the university can 
return to the old scale. If students, faculty dislike minus grades, UF can return to former scale

BAGHDAD — Iraqi forces as-
sumed formal control of Bagh-
dad and other cities Tuesday after 
American troops handed over secu-
rity in urban areas in a defining step toward ending the U.S. combat role in the country.
A countdown clock broadcast on 
Iraqi TV ticked to zero as the mid-night deadline passed for U.S. com-bat troops to finish their pullback to bases outside cities.
“The withdrawal of American 
troops is completed now from all cities after everything they sacri-ficed for the sake of security,” said 
Sadiq al-Rikabi, a senior adviser 
to Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. “We are now celebrating the resto-ration of sovereignty.”
The Pentagon did not offer any 
comment to mark the passing of the deadline.
Fireworks, not bombings, col-
ored the Baghdad skyline late 
Monday, and thousands attended a 
party in a park where singers per-formed patriotic songs. Loudspeak-ers at police stations and military checkpoints played recordings of 
similar tunes throughout the day, 
as Iraqi military vehicles decorated with flowers and national flags pa-trolled the capital.
“All of us are happy — Shiites, 
Sunnis and Kurds on this day,” Waleed al-Bahadili said as he cele-brated at the park. “The Americans harmed and insulted us too much.”
Al-Maliki declared a public holi-
day and proclaimed June 30 as “Na-tional Sovereignty Day.”
Midnight’s handover to Iraqi 
forces filled many citizens with pride but also trepidation that gov-ernment forces are not ready and that violence will rise. Shiites fear more bombings by Sunni militants; Sunnis fear that the Shiite-domi-
nated Iraqi security forces will give 
them little protection.
If the Iraqis can hold down vio-
lence in the coming months, it will 
show the country is finally on the 
road to stability. If they fail, it will pose a challenge to President Barack Obama’s pledge to end an unpopu-lar war that has claimed the lives of more than 4,300 U.S. troops and 
tens of thousands of Iraqis.
The gathering at the Baghdad 
park was unprecedented in size for such a postwar event in a city 
where people tend to avoid large 
gatherings for fear of suicide bomb-
ers. They ignored an appeal by Vice President Tariq al-Hash    Tariq al-Hashemi to stay away from crowd-ed places during the U.S. pullback, 
which has seen more than 250 peo-
ple killed in bombings over the past 10 days.

Get ready to open your wallets.
The 15 percent tuition hike sought by UF’s 
Board of Trustees was approved by the Board of Governors on June 18, passing its final hurdle.
UF trustees passed the measure at its meeting 
on June 12.
The hike, part of the state’s tuition differential 
program, allows the 11 state universities to raise tuition by no more than 15 percent each year until they reach the national average.
The state Legislature approved a hike of 8 per-
cent, which allowed universities to raise tuition by another 7 percent.
Bright Futures will not cover the increases.Students who enrolled before July 1, 2007, and 
maintain continuous enrollment are exempt.
Thirty percent of the new tuition money, or 
its equivalent in privately raised money, must be spent on need-based aid, while the remaining 70 percent must be spent on undergraduate educa-tion.
Along with fees approved at the trustees meet-
ing earlier this month, tuition for some under-graduates will be increasing a total of 16 percent.
Tuition for in-state undergraduates at UF tak-
ing 30 credits will go up from $3,777 to $4,373 a year starting in the fall.

UF tuition 15 percent■ TOUR TEACHES HOW TO FIND 
BOOKS, USE RESOURCES.
By JESSICA CHAPMAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Getting your hands on “Moby 
Dick” in Library West might seem like finding a lost set of keys in the bottom of the Atlantic.
But throughout the month, the li-
brary will offer orientations to intro-duce students and faculty to available resources and tools to access the re-sources from home. UF will also offer a tour of the library, which is home to more than 4 million books.
The orientations, held in Library West, Room 211, are designed to teach students about all libraries on cam-pus. 
“You can’t really understand what 
the library has to offer you until you make an effort to understand it,” said 
Missy Shoop, instruction and outreach 
coordinator for Library West. 
Shoop said many stu-
dents do not realize all 
the books the library has 
or know how to use many 
of the resources, such as Ask a Librar-
ian. The orientation can help them when they are searching for an article or using one of the other services, she said.
“Students come in and don’t neces-
sarily see where the books are,” Shoop said. “The most important reason we are here is to help the students, faculty and staff.” 
Jennifer Walker, a senior journal-
ism major, said she thinks the orienta-tion will help.
“I don’t go into Library West be-
cause it’s too congested,” Walker said.
“When I was a freshman I was so 
confused, and you can’t really avoid (the library),” she said.

UF president Bernie Machen is 
in Jacksonville this morning talk-
ing about ways to improve safety at 
the annual Florida-Georgia football 
game held in River City.
He will be meeting with Mayor 
John Peyton.
“We have some problems with 
the way things are done over there, crowd control outside of the stadium 
and things like that,” Machen said 
last week at the University Athletic 
Association’s board meeting.
The game is held 
at the ALLTEL Sta-dium sports com-plex.
Machen said he 
hoped the contract 
between UF and the 
city of Gainesville could be extended 
by the end of the summer.Two students have died in the city 
while attending the game in recent 
years, one in 2004 and one in 2005.
As a result, UF and Jacksonville 
have hosted safety zones–which of-fer things like first aid, water, snacks, 
coffee, phone service, universal cell 
phone chargers and directions–close to the stadium for the past three years.
UF officials have also expressed 
displeasure at the game’s nickname, “The World’s Largest Outdoor Cock-
tail Party.”UF PROJECTSMachen bargains over FL-GA forum

Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff 
Former UF guard Nick Calathes was picked by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the second round of the NBA Draft on 
Thursday. His rights were traded to the Dallas Mavericks. Calathes has signed a contract to play pro ball in Greece.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator.org
When Nick Calathes announced his decision to leave UF af-
ter his sophomore season and take his game overseas, he took 
a huge part of the team’s future with him.
Earlier this month, Calathes signed a contract that could pay 
up to $3.5 million with Euroleague powerhouse Panathinaikos 
in Greece. The 6-foot-6 guard was taken with the 45th pick in 
the NBA Draft on Thursday, and his rights were later traded from the Minnesota Timberwolves to the Dallas Mavericks. 
“Once he signed that contract, that may 
have ill-affected the number he was drafted, but I think that he covered both ends very well,” UF associate head coach Larry Shy-att said in a Southeastern Conference men’s basketball teleconference. “He’s in pretty 
good shape financially.”
To bring Calathes to the NBA, the Maver-
icks would have to pay $500,000 to buy out his two-year con-
tract, which has an option for a third season.
With last season’s leading scorer out of the picture, the 
Gators will be left with a sizable hole in their roster, particu-larly at the point guard spot after failing to sign one in the 2009 recruiting class. 
“We are just very, very thin and frail in the backcourt right 
now,” Shyatt said. “We most definitely need a point guard in that 2010 class.”
UF hoped to sign a point guard — notably John Wall or 
Lamont “MoMo” Jones — this summer, but Wall decided to attend conference rival Kentucky and Jones committed to Ari-zona.
As a result, Erving Walker is the only true point guard on Calathes leaves 
hole at PG spot
It’s that time of the year again.
I always start to get a little nostalgic 
when the Summer B semester starts. It’s 
when I started here at UF two years ago, 
and it’s a few weeks after I started working 
at the Alligator last year.
Clearly, we get that same kind of nos-
talgia here at alligatorSports, as you can 
see from the list Phil announced. Before we start looking ahead to the 2009-10 sports season and moving on, we’re going to look back at the year that was. 
The 2008-09 sports year was full of ups 
and downs for UF — mostly ups, consider-
ing the Gators had a school record-tying 12 
top-10 finishes. 
As a result of that program-wide suc-
cess, UF finished third in the Learfield Sports Directors’ Cup Standings, which is presented annually by the nation’s athletics directors and recognizes the schools with the best overall sports performances in an academic year, well behind Stanford but 
close to second-place North Carolina. 
The positives from last year outweigh 
the negatives, although another disap-pointing men’s 
basketball season and the continued number of foot-ball players being 
arrested left some-
thing of a black mark on an other-wise outstanding record.
And while it’s 
easy to look back and point out what could have been — the softball team was two wins away from the program’s first nation-
al championship, the men’s track and field 
team came up short of a national title twice and the baseball team’s run to the College World Series was brought to a close by  un-derdog Southern Miss — it’s worth looking back on the success each program enjoyed. At least while I’m feeling nostalgic.
The football team’s national champi-
onship over Oklahoma was obviously the 
highlight of the year, and I could probably Looking back on a successful year
Walking through campus Monday 
brought a sense of renewal, with 
Turlington Plaza bustling con-
siderably more compared to the six weeks 
of the Summer A semester.
The first day of Summer B classes meant 
an injection of fresh blood into Gainesville’s landscape with the arrival of map-toting 
freshmen (the Class of 2013!).
Let me be the first to offer an alligator-
Sports welcome to you all. Even though 
we’ve all been there before, we do enjoy a 
chuckle or two at your expense. Don’t be 
offended.
But before the fall kicks off a new athlet-
ic year for UF, we are going to take one last look at the sports year that was 2008-09.
That’s right — over the next three 
weeks, we are going to unveil our Top 10 UF Athletes from the previous year, 
beginning in Thurs-
day’s paper.
We will count-
down from No. 10 to No. 1 by revealing two of our selections 
each issue accompa-
nied by a short write-
up on why we feel this athlete earned his or her ranking.
So how did our six-person panel of al-
ligatorSports columnists arrive at these 10 Gators?
The rules for selection were basic, with 
a nomination phase followed by the final 
balloting. For the former, we all threw  into Countdown of top athletes coming
� No. 10 on our list of top UF athletes

PARIS — When the Tour de 
France starts Saturday, some cyclists 
may as well wear targets on their backs.
Pat McQuaid, the head of the In-
ternational Cycling Union, says the race will be the most rigorously test-ed sports event in history. There will be about 520 doping tests, and sev-eral of the 180 riders are already in the crosshairs even before the three-week showcase begins in Monaco.
Focusing on suspicious competi-
tors is one of the major innovations 
at this year’s Tour, which is hoping 
to repair its battered image. Mc-Quaid says he’s “neither an optimist or a pessimist” that this could be the year without scandals.
“There’s always an idiot out there 
who will try something,” he said by phone Monday.
In recent weeks, 50 riders likely 
to compete in the Tour have faced enhanced testing. McQuaid said that includes team leaders, race favorites 
and an unspecified small number of riders with suspicious profiles.
The list of suspects has been 
drawn from the UCI’s new biologi-
cal passport program. In it, riders have provided blood or urine sam-ples in individual body chemistry profiles that officials can compare to their race-day parameters.
Any fluctuations from known 
baseline levels could possibly sig-nal doping. Officials, in effect, are 
searching for evidence of doping 
rather than individual illegal sub-stances. McQuaid calls the passport a “huge deterrent” to cheating.
Levi Leipheimer, an American 
with the Astana team who has three race victories and four stage wins this year, said the passport suggests “they are tightening the net around 
doping and dopers.”
“I think that’s a great thing,” he 
said Monday during a conference 
call. “Maybe in the future we’ll look back and say it improved from this date.”
Among other new tactics, testers 
will indicate which riders they want to target as late as 15 minutes before the end of each stage — hoping to catch cheaters off-guard. Testers also 
will freeze riders’ samples and store 
them in the hope that if checks are unable to turn up drug use today, maybe some day they will.
As in years past, the stage winner 
and overall race leader automati-cally will be tested after each stage, along with six other cyclists.
The designer drug of choice in 
recent years has 
been the blood-booster EPO and — increasingly last year — an advanced version called CERA. Doping chiefs are also on the 
lookout for blood 
doping, a practice in which riders 
extract their own blood, store it and inject it when needed.
Such transfusions have been dif-
ficult to detect, but the top anti-dop-ing official in France has said he ex-pects a relevant test to be perfected.
Pierre Bordry, the head of France’s anti-doping agency, said last week that his testers understand 
blood doping better thanks in part to 
former rider Bernhard Kohl.
Kohl, who retired last month, fin-
ished third at last year’s Tour before being caught using CERA. He has said his doping went undetected de-spite giving numerous samples.
Bordry, whose agency is working 
with the UCI this year, has refused 
to reveal the new techniques of his 
testers to deter cheaters.
Before the Tour starts, all riders 
will give two blood samples that will be tested and stored. Then, through-out the race, two testers will conduct the sampling after each stage. Cy-clists will have chaperones to escort them to test centers.
Spain’s Alberto Contador, the 
2007 winner, sat out last year after organizers excluded his Astana team because of doping allegations. 
Two years ago, Contador was 
able to win in part because then-leader Michael Rasmussen of Den-mark was ousted for lying about his whereabouts during doping con-trols before the race.
Six riders were disqualified in 
doping scandals last year.
Former German rider Joerg Jak-
sche retired last year because no one would hire him after he detailed doping practices. He says he will assume whoever wins the Tour will have doped.
“I experienced it myself — dop-
ing simply helps too much,” Jaksche 
said in Sunday’s edition of Berlin’s 
Tagesspiegel newspaper.
He was the first cyclist to ac-
knowledge blood doping in the 2006 Spanish scandal known as Op-eration Puerto. He cooperated with sports authorities in exchange for a reduced one-year ban.
Some riders still grumble about 
cycling’s image.
“It’s so narrow-minded to think 
cycling is a sport for dopers,” Brit-ish sprint specialist Mark Cavendish recently told The Associated Press. “It’s not like you’re born, you’re a cheat and you go: ‘Oh, cycling’s the sport for me.’ It doesn’t work like that, but that’s the perception of it.”

Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland faces Andy Murray of Britain during their fourth-round singles match 
played under the roof on Centre Court at Wimbledon on Monday. Murray won the match in five sets.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
WIMBLEDON, England — 
Rhythmic clapping rang out on 
Centre Court, accompanied by 
not-so-staid chants of “Roof! Roof! 
Roof!”
Yes, indoor tennis has arrived at 
Wimbledon, more than a century 
after the tournament’s debut.
The new retractable roof over 
Centre Court was closed for the first 
time Monday after a light sprinkle halted play during the second set 
of a match between No. 1-ranked 
Dinara Safina and 2006 Wimbledon champion Amelie Mauresmo.
As luck would have it, by the 
time the match resumed, the wet weather had disappeared, and ac-tion proceeded on other courts around the All England Club with-out the help of modern technol-
ogy.
Still, the novelty of it all created 
quite a buzz. The roof is making 
its debut this year atop a stadium 
that opened in the 1920s — and at a 
tournament that began in the 1870s — and this was the first rain delay of the fortnight after a sunny first week.
“It’s a plus, definitely, for the 
tournament to be able to play. Of course, we haven’t seen really bad days so far in the tournament,” 
Mauresmo said after losing 4-6, 6-3, 
6-4. “But I remember a few editions of Wimbledon when we would re-ally have needed a roof. So it’s a good thing.”
The translucent roof allows nat-
ural light, in addition to floodlights that were switched on, and the most discernible difference from 
the stands was the sound. 
There was an echo, not just 
when a ball came off a racket with 
a “thwack!” but also from hand-clapping and line judges’ yells of 
“out!”Mauresmo thought the roof 
changed the playing conditions.
“The ball is flying a little bit 
more. That’s how I felt. And we 
both kind of took a little time to adjust,” Mauresmo said. “When the ball is in the air, and when you have the overhead or stuff, it’s very 
bright.”
Safina lost the first set and was 
ahead 4-1 in the second when it 
began drizzling. The court was 
initially covered with a green tarp, 
Wimbledon’s timeworn method for waiting for rain to subside so play can resume, before All Eng-land Club officials quickly decided 
to shut the roof.
Last week, on the hottest of days, 
organizers moved part of the roof 
ever so slightly to provide shade for those sitting in the Royal Box. 
This time, they closed it fully, and 
for the originally intended purpose: protection from Mother Nature’s intrusions, which are generally so 
common that the event’s official 
record book, “Wimbledon Com-pendium,” contains sections called “Days which have been completely rained off” and “First weeks badly 
interrupted by rain.”
Wimbledon is the second Grand 
Slam tournament with the possibil-
ity of indoor play. The Australian 
Open has retractable roofs over 
its two main courts and plans to cover a third, too. The French Open intends to have a roof over its cen-ter court by 2011; the U.S. Open is looking into the possibility of cov-
ering a court.
“We’ve been waiting for it for 
so long — it’s the first time ever at 
Wimbledon somebody’s waiting 
for rain — but we’d still prefer the 
sunshine,” the club’s chief execu-tive, Ian Ritchie, said while the roof was being closed. “It’s a historic moment in many ways, and I’m sure they all feel delighted to be 
here. We’ll be grateful if the sun 
comes back.”
Well, the sun did reappear, yet 
the roof remained shut during the next match on Centre Court, be-
tween No. 3 Andy Murray and No. 
19 Stanislas Wawrinka, because the forecast called for later showers.
A little more than five min-
utes after Safina and Mauresmo were sent to the locker room when the rain started, fans began their “Roof!” chorus. Moments later, the lights were switched on, drawing 
cheers.Soon, the white steel bars sup-
porting the canvas roof were glid-ing, earning another round of 
applause and flickering camera flashes. Every so often, the opera-tion paused before the pieces re-
sumed their journey. 
It took six minutes for the roof’s 
two sections to slide into place, 
meeting in the middle at 4:46 p.m. When the thing was completely closed — making the most hal-
lowed arena in tennis look some-
thing like an airplane hangar, with all of those “V’’-shaped support beams overhead — the fans roared, many rising for a standing ovation. 
They also shut their now-unneces-
sary umbrellas.
Cool air filled the arena as a ven-
tilation system kicked in to remove 
moisture from the air. 
While the scoreboards showed 
a documentary about the making 
of the roof, a voice over the loud-speakers announced at 5:10 p.m.: 
“The good news is, play is to re-sume on Centre Court round about 
two minutes from now.”
Indeed, exactly two minutes lat-
er, Mauresmo and Safina stepped back onto the court. Mauresmo looked up and checked out the new 
setup.
Following the usual warmup 
players are given when returning 
from a rain delay, the match re-sumed at 5:19 p.m., 45 minutes af-ter Safina and Mauresmo had left.
On the first point ever played 
indoors at a tournament first held in 1877, Safina hit a backhand pass-ing winner down the line. 
Mauresmo hit a 110 mph ace on 
the next point and eventually add-ed two more aces to win the game.
Safina, though, went on to win 
a match that is sure to be noted in  
the “Wimbledon Compendium.”
“Even the crowd also wanted 
the roof, so it was, like, unbeliev-
able atmosphere on the court,” Safina said. “I won, so everything 
was perfect.”Wimbledon closes 
roof for first time
“We’ve been waiting for it 
for so long — it’s the first 
time ever at Wimbledon

rain — but we’d still prefer

CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Jeremy Mayfield 
will go head-to-head with NASCAR this week 
in what very well may be his last shot at rac-ing again this season.
If a federal judge agrees Wednesday to 
lift his indefinite suspension for a failed ran-dom drug test, Mayfield has indicated he’ll go straight to Daytona International Speedway to attempt to resurrect his career.
But if the decision goes in favor of NA-
SCAR, then Mayfield is in for a long legal battle that will potentially destroy him per-sonally and professionally.
As the first driver suspended under a 
toughened new drug policy, Mayfield was thrust into a career-killing drama that’s mush-roomed since a random sample collected May 1 came back positive for what NASCAR deemed “a dangerous, illegal, banned sub-stance.”
He immediately denied drug use and has 
blamed his positive result on a mix of Adder-all for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disor-
der and Claritin-D for allergies. His explana-
tion, debunked by the program administrator, confused NASCAR competitors and forced chairman Brian France to address the drug policy in a rare town hall meeting.
Then Mayfield sued to have his suspension 
lifted, and things really got interesting.
The past 30 days have been a flurry of legal 
activity, culminating in last week’s filing of 
hundreds of pages of documents as both sides 
prepared for their showdown in U.S. District Court.
Among the paperwork was a six-page af-
fidavit in which Mayfield laid out his side of the story. He said he’s never used metham-phetamines and doesn’t know how his drug test came back positive.
He also said the suspension has crippled 
his career, forcing him to lay off 10 employees, borrow money from family and sell personal assets to meet his living expenses. Mayfield 
said sponsors won’t work with him, and he 
has not been able to send his team to the track the last five weeks.
So Mayfield needs a miracle to return to the track.
The question remains, though, just what 
does he have to return to?
Mayfield started the season as one of NA-
SCAR’s feel-good stories. Out of steady work since a 2006 firing from Evernham Motor-sports, he put everything he had into May-field Motorsports. It was a low-budget, under-
staffed organization thrown together weeks 
before the Daytona 500 without a prayer of being successful.
Until he raced his way into the biggest 
event of the year.
Qualifying for the 500 put Mayfield briefly 
back in the spotlight, as the underdog who needed all the support he could get to go toe-to-toe with the deep-pocketed race teams. But 
the light began to fade in just a few weeks, in 
part because of the product Mayfield put on track.
Before his suspension, Mayfield had quali-
fied for just five of 11 races and didn’t have a finish higher than 32nd. His team was going nowhere, fast, and the bills were apparently piling up. Triad Racing Technologies recently filed suit for $86,304.55 for parts, pieces and 
chassis work that Mayfield owes.
Then came the negative attention from the 
suspension, the public denials and the tense 
legal fight that have turned Mayfield into a sponsor nightmare. No company will touch him or his team.
So even if he is reinstated, he’s not heading 
back to the most stable situation. And, NA-
SCAR will almost certainly continue to fight 
the already cash-strapped Mayfield, who has hired the most prolific lawyer in Charlotte.
It makes one wonder if the more sensible 
route would have been quietly serving his 
NASCAR suspension and then attempting a 
career-saving comeback. Of course, partici-
pating in NASCAR’s “path to reinstatement” 
would have been akin to admitting guilt, something Mayfield has adamantly opposed since his suspension.
But the process might have been faster and 
most certainly cheaper.
More important, it couldn’t possibly have 
damaged his career any worse than what’s been done the last seven weeks.TUESDAY, JUNE 30, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 25

AUSTIN, Texas — Texas linebacker 
Sergio Kindle was treated for a concus-
sion after crashing his car into an Austin apartment building last week while he was either sending or receiving a text message, his attorney said Monday.
Kindle’s attorney, Brian Roark, said 
Kindle lost control of the car on June 24 while looking at the message.
“It was probably something he 
should not have been doing,” Roark said.
The crash caused about $8,700 dam-
age although no one inside was hurt. After the crash, Kindle pushed the car back into the street and went home. He was checked by team doctors and told he had a concussion but did not have to be hospitalized.
University spokesman John Bianco said Kindle told his coaches about the accident the next morning.
“We’re glad nobody else was hurt 
and he’s going to be fine,” Bianco said.
Police Cpl. Scott Perry said police 
are still investigating but no charges have been filed. Perry said police have 
not talked to Kindle or Roark.
Because Kindle hit 
a stationary object and 
did not injure anyone else, he is only required to file a report with the Texas Department of Transportation, Roark said, adding he planned to file it as ear-ly as Monday.
Roark said Kindle would pay for the 
damages himself or through insurance if it is covered.
Kindle, a senior from Dallas, had 10 
sacks last season. In 2007, he missed the first three games while serving a sus-pension for a drunken driving arrest.Texas LB loses control of

WASHINGTON — In taking a case in-
volving the National Football League’s ex-
clusive licensing deal for sports merchan-dise, the Supreme Court could go beyond caps and give leagues more leeway in areas 
such as team relocation, legal scholars said 
Monday.
“A broad ruling in favor of the NFL could 
rewrite almost all of sports antitrust law,” said Gabe Feldman, associate law professor and director of the sports law program at Tulane University in New Orleans.
The court will hear an appeal from Amer-
ican Needle Inc., of Buffalo Grove, Ill., which 
filed an antitrust challenge to an agreement 
the NFL struck with Reebok International Ltd. American Needle had been one of many firms that manufactured NFL headwear un-til the league granted an exclusive contract to Reebok in 2001.
The NFL won the case in federal appeals 
court in Chicago. But it also asked the Su-preme Court to hear the case in a quest for 
a more sweeping decision that could put 
an end to what the league considers costly, frivolous antitrust lawsuits.
The court decided to take the case against 
the advice of the U.S. Solicitor General’s of-fice.
The central question is whether the league is essentially a “single entity” that can act collectively, as the NFL argues, or 32 dis-
tinct businesses that must be careful about 
running afoul of antitrust laws.
Matt Mitten, a law professor and director 
of the National Sports Law Institute at Mar-quette University in Milwaukee, called the court’s decision to take the case significant.
“This will be the first time the Supreme 
Court will consider the merits of the single entity defense,” he said, adding that a favor-able court decision could give the league “a lot more room not to have to fear suits” on issues such as relocation and ownership re-quirements.
In a statement, NFL spokesman Greg 
Aiello said the league looked forward to explaining why the court should extend, on a national basis, favorable appeals court rulings on how antitrust laws apply “to the unique structure of a sports league.”

phone messages Monday.NASCAR

JOHANNESBURG — Next 
year’s World Cup just got a little 
more interesting.
Forget that the final score of the 
Confederations Cup final Sunday 
was Brazil 3, the United States 2. 
The Americans proved their upset of top-ranked Spain was no fluke, dominating the Brazilians in the first half and giving the five-time World Cup champions a test to the final whistle.
“This disappointment’s going 
to be here for a while,” U.S. captain 
Carlos Bocanegra said. “But it’ll go 
away, and what we can take away from this is the confidence that we played so well against the big teams here. This is a difficult tournament, we did well here and got to the finals and we showed that we belong.
“We’re not just going to be a 
pushover in the World Cup when 
we come down here.”
Luis Fabiano scored twice for 
Brazil, and Lucio added the third 
in the 84th minute to give Brazil its second straight Confederations Cup title and third overall.
The United States has beaten Bra-
zil once in 15 games. It was just 10 days ago that the Brazilians hung a 
3-0 rout on the Americans in group 
play of the tournament, leading to critics piling on and some calling for coach Bob Bradley’s job.
The U.S. men became a different 
team in the aftermath.
 They beat Spain to reach their 
first final at a FIFA tournament. And for the first 45 minutes Sunday, 
it was Brazil that looked like the 
beaten team.
Brazil’s usually fluid offense cre-
ated few opportunities and was con-stantly stymied by the U.S. defense and goalkeeper Tim Howard.
Meanwhile, the Americans were 
relentless in their attack on a ner-vous-looking Brazil defense, with Landon Donovan working to give his team several scoring chances.
Just 10 minutes into the game, 
Jonathan Spector sprinted down the right side and sent a low cross into the area. Clint Dempsey, who had 
plenty of room to maneuver, raised 
his right leg and put just enough of a touch on the ball to alter the direc-tion and send it past a diving Julio Cesar.
Donovan then got possession at 
his own end shortly after Maicon had sent in a corner for Brazil from the right. The U.S. midfielder ran up the middle, passed to Charlie Davies and then reclaimed the ball from his teammate before beating Cesar.
“Leading up to the game, we 
showed a lot of heart, a lot of charac-ter,” Howard said. “We gave them 
everything they could handle, took 
a 2-0 lead and deserved every piece of that lead.”
There is a reason Brazil has 
won so many titles over the years, though, and it wasn’t about to let another slip away.
Fabiano started the comeback 
in the 46th minute. The striker col-
lected a pass from Ramires before 
turning and shooting past defender Jay DeMerit for his fourth goal of the tournament.
“We gave up the first goal so 
early in second half,” Bradley said. “We really put ourselves in a tough spot.”
Fabiano added a tournament-
leading fifth goal to equalize in the 
74th, heading in a rebound after 
Kaka’s cross was kicked against the crossbar by Robinho.
The Americans caught a break in 
the 60th when Kaka headed a cross from Andre Santos to the near post. 
Howard stepped back into his 
goal and knocked the shot off the underside of the crossbar and then grabbed it safely in his arms. Kaka appealed, arguing that the ball crossed the line before Howard was able to get to it, and television re-plays indicated he was correct.
“I don’t know whether the ball 
crossed the goal line,” Kaka said. “It would have been fantastic for me to 
score a legitimate headed goal.”
It wouldn’t matter, with Lucio 
delivering the decisive goal in the 
84th when he headed a corner kick from Elano past Howard. 
Brazil has won eight matches in a 
row and is unbeaten in its last 16.
The Americans were downcast 
after the game, with Dempsey sob-bing openly as he walked to get his medal.
“This is a massive learning expe-
rience. You always hope to do the most learning when you win, but you probably learn more by losing,” Donovan said. “If we’re smart and we take what we should from this 
game, we can progress. And that’s 
what we’re trying to do.”
The United States begins defense 
of the Gold Cup, the championship of North and Central America and the Caribbean, on Saturday in Se-attle, though only four players from the Confederations Cup are on that roster. 26, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JUNE 30, 2009

the Gators roster. Shyatt said the 
team will have to lean heavily on the 5-foot-8 rising sophomore.
“We really are setting our jets 
for Erving Walker, who’s naturally 
a point and played that position in 
high school,” Shyatt said. “With Nick on the floor last year, he really played off the ball more.”
Shyatt added that Walker was 
one of several players who will move to their natural positions next year. Dan Werner, who played down low throughout the 2008-09 season, will 
see more time on the wing as a small 
forward, and after playing center most of last year, Alex Tyus will play more at the power forward spot.
The addition of Vernon Macklin, 
the 6-foot-10 transfer from George-town who sat out last season, will provide more options in the front-court, especially for Tyus, whose 
6-foot-8 frame put him at something 
of a disadvantage against most cen-ters he faced.
Along with Macklin, the Gators 
added incoming freshman forward Erik Murphy and hope to see in-creased production from returning 
big men Kenny Kadji and Eloy Var-
gas.
With the added depth, Shyatt 
also hopes to play more man-to-man defense and plans to press more.
“We definitely have to defend 
and rebound better if we’re going to win and win more big games this season,” Shyatt said.
Despite his confidence in a 
deeper frontcourt, Shyatt repeatedly brought up UF’s lack of depth in the backcourt during the teleconference, even joking, “My summer’s been great except for this dearth at point guard.”
Incoming freshman Kenny Boyn-
ton will do his part to make up for the loss of Calathes’ scoring. In his senior year of high school at Planta-tion American Heritage High, the 6-foot-2 guard averaged 31 points per game, and he finished his high school career as the third-highest point scorer in Florida history.
“Kenny Boynton is a tenacious 
enough athlete — I think he is ‘all in’ as they would say — and he’s going to be ready to do whatever it is, like Erving did as a freshman,” Shyatt said. “But make no mistake about it: We need a point guard in that 2010 
class really bad.”
Although losing players early is 
nothing new for Shyatt, he acknowl-
edged that it will be hard to replace everything Calathes brought.
“It’s definitely an impact, and 
not something new to us. We’ve lost eight underclassmen since I’ve been here in five years, and we’ve 
lost six underclassmen in three sea-
sons,” Shyatt said. “But it does — in this case — put us in a predicament this coming season in terms of really lacking the pure point guard and depth at the point guard.”
Walker among several players returning to natural positions in lineup next yearwrite a full page worth of what that champi-onship did for the coaches, players and the school. 
“The Gator football team’s national 
championship was truly a highlight for this 
season, but there was plenty to be proud 
about when looking at the entire Gator ath-letic program,” Athletics Director Jeremy Foley said in a statement.
And as much as I think putting “The 
Promise” on the wall of the football com-plex like it’s the Ten Commandments was not a wise move, it quickly became one of the most famous speeches in sports history 
and was recently nominated for an ESPY 
for “Best Moment.”
As Foley said, the rest of the year saw 
plenty of other successes. The fall sports sea-son alone included a NCAA Tournament second-round finish by the soccer team and a surprisingly successful season by a young volleyball team. 
While the men’s basketball team fin-
ished in the NIT for the second straight year, Amanda Butler emerged as UF’s next great young coach, leading the women’s team to the NCAA Tournament after a season that included the program’s third-ever victory against Tennessee and spent a few weeks in the AP Poll’s Top 10.
Despite a series of injuries that forced in-
experienced athletes to compete on a larger stage than they were used to, the gymnas-tics team finished fourth in the nation after another Super Six appearance.
Both Gators teams had successful years 
on the diamond, with the young baseball team announcing its arrival with a run to the NCAA Super Regionals and the ex-
perienced softball team, led by a group of 
seniors the program won’t soon forget, fall-ing just short of its season-long goal of a na-tional title.
And between the track and field teams 
and the swimming teams, the Gators claimed nine individual NCAA titles. 
So there you go. Not a bad year, eh? 
Look forward to the next three weeks of the 
Alligator, as we’ll relive some of the great-
est moments by counting down the top 10 athletes of the year.
After that, I think we’ll all be ready to 
move on.AP Photo
Houston Rockets center Yao Ming walks off the court following the 
Game 3 of a second-round loss to the Los Angeles Lakers.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
HOUSTON — Rockets center 
Yao Ming’s broken left foot could 
be a “career-threatening” injury.
Dr. Tom Clanton, the Hous-
ton Rockets’ team physician, 
told the Houston Chronicle on 
Monday that Yao’s injury “has 
the potential for him missing this 
next season and could be career-
threatening.”
Yahoo! Sports first reported 
the Rockets and Yao’s representa-
tives were concerned the 7-foot-6 
All-Star would never play again. 
Yahoo! Sports quoted “mul-
tiple league executives, officials 
close to Yao and two doctors with 
knowledge of the diagnoses.”
Yao suffered a hairline frac-
ture of the tarsal navicular bone late in a May 8 playoff game 
against the Los Angeles Lakers. 
The team said last week the 
injury hasn’t healed and that he 
was out indefinitely.
Yao played in 77 regular-sea-
son games in 2008-09, his most injury-free year since 2004-05, when he played in 80. 
Before last season, Yao missed 
chunks of previous three seasons with leg and foot injuries.
He missed 21 games in 2005-
06 after surgery to heal an infec-tion to his left big toe. 
Then he broke a bone in his 
left foot with four games left in the regular season.
In 2006-07, Yao broke his 
right leg and missed a total of 34 games. 
The next season, Yao suffered 
a stress fracture in his left foot. 
It caused him to miss a total of 
27 games in the 2007-08 regular season.
Yao hurried back from that 
foot injury to represent China in 
the Beijing Games. 
He made it through the Rock-
ets’ season and the first round of 
the playoffs before breaking his 
left foot late in the Rockets’ 108-
94 loss to the Lakers in Game 3 of the second round at the Toyota Center. The Lakers went on to win the NBA Championship in 
five games against the Orlando 
Magic.
Two days later, Yao said he 
didn’t believe the injury was as 
serious as any of his previous 
ones. 
The Rockets said he would 
miss only 8-12 weeks.
But last week, the team said 
Yao would undergo additional 
tests and consult with other doc-
tors to map out a new course of treatment.Yao is due to make over $16 
million next season with a player option for 2010-11 that would pay him over $17 million. 
He was the top overall pick by 
the Rockets in the 2002 draft.
The Rockets already expect 
Tracy McGrady to miss at least the first half of next season after 
microfracture surgery on his left 
knee.
Houston acquired McGrady 
in a trade with Orlando in June 2004, hoping the All-Star duo 
would carry Houston back to the 
NBA’s top tier. 
But one or the other has been 
injured for almost their entire 
time as teammates. 
The Rockets are 146-74 in the 
220 games McGrady and Yao 
have played together, a low total across five seasons.
General manager Daryl Mo-
rey said last week Yao’s uncer-tain status wouldn’t affect any of his offseason plans for trades or 
free-agent signings. 
He has said the Rockets are in-
terested in re-signing free agent 
Ron Artest.
Morey said after last week’s 
draft he would not comment on 
Yao’s health beyond the state-
ment released by the team that he was out indefinitely.NBAYao’s injury may threaten career
the discussion  any UF athlete we consid-
ered possibly worthy of earning  top-10 recognition. All sports were eligible, al-
though unsurprisingly our list has been 
mostly dominated by the bigger-revenue sports.
Then, all of the nominees were com-
piled on a ballot, and each columnist ranked his top 10. Points were awarded similar to all major college sports polls — ranking an athlete No. 1 earned him or 
her 10 points, a No. 2 vote got 9 points, all 
the way down to 1 point for a 10th-place vote.
Remember, athletes were judged solely 
on their body of work during their 2008-09 
competitive season. This list is not meant 
to rate an entire career.
Certainly, such a list is subjective. It was up to each columnist to figure out 
how to weigh performances across differ-
ent sports as well as deciding how team performance would play a part.
A great performance on a great team 
(perhaps a championship-winning one) 
is usually going to earn more praise com-
pared to a slightly better performance on a terrible team. This is, of course, the age-old Most Valuable Player argument.
I expect you may disagree with some 
of our selections. We welcome this!
