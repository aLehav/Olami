A Gainesville woman and former UF 
student was arrested Tuesday on a charge of 
aggravated child abuse after being accused of smothering a 10-month-old child she was babysitting with a pillow.
According to the arrest report, the baby’s 
mother came home early from work and saw Tiffany Long, 21, of 6029 NW 53rd Terrace, holding a pillow over the baby’s face.The mother told police she saw her baby’s legs flailing.Police said that when confronted by the 
mother, Long threw the pillow, put up her hands and asked her not to call the police
Long told police the baby was crying 
uncontrollably, and she was playing peek-a-boo to quiet her down. Long later said, she never got a chance to play peek-a-boo.
Long withdrew from UF in the fall.She was being held at the Alachua Coun-
ty Jail Wednesday in lieu of $35,000 bail.

Window Pains
Left to right: Charlie Turner, Eddie Jordan and Keith Hunter carefully move a 600-pound, 
7-by-12 window pane to replace one of the front window panels at Emerson Alumni Hall on Wednesday. The two giant sheets were touching, known as “kissing” in window terms. UF had a five-year warranty on the windows, both of which ended up lasting 10 years. The university  couldn’t replace the pieces because no one makes glass that size anymore. To solve the prob-lem, the gaps were divided into fours and smaller pieces were used to fill the space.

Free parking downtown could 
become a thing of the past if a pro-posal from the City of Gainesville is approved by the Gainesville City Commission later this year.
The Downtown Parking Study, 
released by the City of Gainesville earlier this week, proposes the elim-ination of  77 available free parking spaces downtown to discourage employees from taking convenient spaces and encourage motorists to use downtown garages.
Commissioner Jeanna Mastrodi-
casa said changing public percep-tions about the downtown parking situation is just as important as im-proving the availability of parking spaces. 
“People perceive that there is no 
parking downtown, so they don’t come, or they get frustrated when they come and don’t see any park-ing,” Mastrodicasa said. “If you ride downtown at nine in the morn-
ing and look at all the free spaces, 
you’ll see that most are already 
filled, and the businesses aren’t 
even open yet. What’s happening is the em-
ployees at downtown 
businesses are taking 
the spots and not the patrons. ”
When employees occupy con-
venient parking slots close to local 
shops, there’s nowhere nearby for 
shoppers to park, and the business-
es suffer, she said. 
“The idea is that we get employ-
ees to park further out and free up all the convenient spots in front of City may do away 
with free parking downtown

The UF Student Senate stood united on 
every bill that came before it Tuesday night, 
approving each bill unanimously. 
One of the approved bills was a revision 
of the Student Government’s 800 codes, 
which are the agency’s financial bylaws. It was authored by Treasurer T.J. Villamil.
The vote was delayed twice, prompting 
Villamil to host a public forum to discuss the changes.
As it is a vote on the codes, the bill must 
be approved a second time and changes can still be made. 
The revisions to the bill are intended to 
promote fiscal responsibility in funding stu-
dent organizations. SG is facing a budget shortfall of about $1 million, Villamil said. 
“[The 800 codes are] putting everyone on 
the same page and making it consistent and 
fair,” he said. 
Villamil is seeking to reduce “personal 
benefit,” or funding one student’s activi-ties as opposed to putting money toward a 
group. 
“This is student money, and it shouldn’t 
be expended in the wrong way,” he said. “It 
should be used to benefit as many students as possible.”
For example, he wanted to eliminate the 
funding of student travel. However, he said, after hearing from graduate students who value travel over things like bounce houses on the North Lawn, he balked.
Despite the unanimous vote the 
codes received in Senate, they don’t necessarily have everyone’s support.   
Villamil has said on numerous occasions that he wanted to add the Senate’s financial 
handbook to the codes. However, combining 
the documents adds some vague language to the laws — language that functions as guidelines rather than hard-and-fast laws. 
The guidelines are meant to allow leeway in certain situations, such as when a student requesting funding misses the deadline for 
paperwork and misses out on funding.
Villamil has said twice in Senate meetings 
he views the codes themselves as guidelines, 
a term with which Senate Minority Leader 
Gillian Leytham takes issue.
“I’m not quite sure what universe he is 
living in,” she wrote in a letter to the Alliga-
tor. “but under our UF Constitution, the 800 codes are, by definition, Student Body laws 
of permanent effect.”
Villamil acknowledged that there are oth-
er ways to promote the finance guidelines 
other than codifying them in the bylaws, but 
past experience has shown him those meth-
ods lead to a very disorganized system.
“There’s 10 different guides that have 
been created in the past five years by stu-dent leaders,” he said. “Everyone wants to SG aiming to revamp funding for organizations

It ain’t your dad’s humans

Attention HvZ junkies: The 
rules have changed.
New regulations on Humans 
versus Zombies will restrict time 
and the locations where the game 
may be played. 
“HvZ,” as it’s known, which 
hosts games with hundreds of UF 
student participants, was informed July 5 by the University Police De-partment they will have to follow some new regulations if they want negotiate with UPD and find com-mon ground, which is that all players must wear a T-shirt with a brightly colored “HvZ” on the front to indicate they are playing.
Foster said she doesn’t think 
the new regulations will affect the numbers of participants. She said 
games typically have between 600 
and 1,100 players. 
HvZ will hold a summer game 
July 20-24 on UF’s campus. 
— SEVERIN WALSTADto continue playing on campus, said Rebecca Foster, president of the organization.
The new regulations state all 
players must be clearly identi-
fiable, Nerf guns must now be 
painted orange, play time is from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and only UF stu-dents are permitted to play. Play-ers must also sign a waiver, and some areas are now off-limits for playing. UPD Lt. William Gainey , the liaison to HvZ, said the new regulations were cre-
ated to distinguish those who are 
playing from a student going to class. 
“Student organizers have 
gone out of their way to prevent problems,” Gainey said. “There has been a lot of planning to al-low students to do this.”

Gainesville residents sounded off on how 
Florida’s districts should be shaped in the 
coming years at the Santa Fe College Fine Arts Hall on Wednesday . 
The meeting, which is the last of five pub-
lic redistricting meetings in northeast and north central Florida, aimed to give residents a chance to share their opinions on the issue of redrawing the state’s political boundaries, which are redrawn every 10 years right after the U. S. Census. 
The purpose of redrawing a state’s con-
gressional, Senate and House boundaries is to keep an equal number of the population in 
each district, in turn giving each state resident 
equal congressional representation.
However, some are skeptical that bound-
ary lines are drawn to favor certain political parties and to protect incumbents.
Manny Lucoff, a Gainesville resident and 
UF alumnus, believes such practices may hap-pen anyway . 
“The timeline has been turned around. 
Why? To protect the incumbents,” Lucoff said. “It’s unfortunate, but that’s the way hardball politics is played.”
Another prominent concern was the ab-
sence of drafted maps projecting what the new districts, which will be approved between Jan-uary and March of 2012, may look like. “We believe that puts the cart before the 
horse,” said state Rep. Steve Precourt.
In addition to new district boundaries, two districts will be added to Florida’s congres-sional districts, bumping the number from 25 to 27. In addition, the ideal population in each district will rise by 57,050 in congressional dis-tricts, 70,434 in Senate districts and 23,492 in the House districts.4, ALLIGATOR n THURSDAY, JULY 14, 2011

 STREAMING AND DVDS 
NOW HAVE SEPARATE FEES.

The convenience of Netflix will 
now cost members a pretty penny.
For $9.99 a month, customers 
used to be able to receive one DVD 
by mail at a time and watch unlim-ited movies and videos instantly online.  
The company is now separating 
those two features and charging for each of them. It will now cost $7.99 
per month to rent one DVD at a time 
and $7.99 for unlimited streaming, or a total of $15.98 for both.  
Netflix Vice President of Market-
ing Jessie Becker wrote in a company 
blog post that the reason the compa-
ny made the change was “to better reflect the costs of each and to give our members a choice: a streaming only plan, a DVD only plan or the option to subscribe to both.”
The change will take immediate 
effect for new members and in September for current customers.
Hannah Spilker, a UF 
health science major, doesn’t think 
she can stick around for the change. 
“The reason I thought Netflix was so appealing was because how 
reasonable the price was,” she said. “It was affordable for a college stu-dent.” 
The company is increasing its 
costs by 60 percent, provoking members to take their business else-where.
Hulu.com now offers Hulu Plus 
for $7.99 per month, with the first 
month free for students who sign 
up with an .edu email address. Hulu Plus allows members to have shows, movies and documentaries instantly streamed to computers, smartphones, game consoles and Blu-ray players. 
HBO is also offering a simi-
lar streaming option for $13.99 a month.
Existing Netflix customers have 
until September to decide to stay or 
make a switch to a different com-
pany .

Edward Dowling enters his truck in front of a free parking sign near The Hampton Inn 
& Suites in downtown Gainesville Wednesday. 
Under plan, city expects to make money back within two and a half years
local businesses to encourage shoppers,” she 
said. 
The plan to eliminate no-charge parking 
would produce a faster turnover of on-street 
parking while raising city revenues.
According to the study, the setup cost of 
the project is estimated at $875,000, while the 
annual cost is estimated at $125,000, for a total first-year cost of $1 million.
Enforcing the new parking restrictions 
would cost $250,000 annually and require the city to hire additional parking-enforcement staff.  
The city is expected to make its money back 
within two and a half years, with total annual revenues estimated at $493,250.
The three-member Recreation, Cultural Af-
fairs and Public Works Committee, comprised of Commissioners Mastrodicasa, Scherwin Henry and Todd Chase, also proposes to in-crease meter rates for lot and on-street parking to further encourage visitors to use garages.According to the proposal, meters would 
be in effect until 8 p.m., and the committee may push for them to run even later: until 11 p.m. and on Saturdays.
The committee argues the elimination of 
free parking would improve business for local vendors, though others argue it would do just the opposite.
“People will stop going downtown,” said 
19-year-old microbiology student Jheel Pan-dya.  “When you want to go downtown, you already have to think about paying to get into clubs and everything else. Now parking? It’s just too much.”
If the plan is approved by the commission, 
the earliest changes would take effect some-time next year. 
The city also plans to create a website to 
show pay rates and locations of available parking if the plan is implemented. 
The next meeting to discuss the parking 
proposal will be held by the Recreational, Cul-tural Affairs and Public Works Committee on Sept. 12.PARKING , from page 1do things their way. The problem is

In another bill approved at

About a dozen UF faculty members, with 
specialties ranging from traditional medicine to 
environmental sociology, have received a $6.5 
million grant to study the psychological and en-
vironmental effects of the Gulf’s latest oil spill.
UF is one of four universities involved in the 
research starting this summer. Louisiana State 
University Health Sciences Center New Orleans, 
Tulane University and the University of Texas 
Medical Branch at Galveston are the others.
These are “four major universities along the 
coasts, strategically spaced, who are the leads on their various grants,” said Dr. J. Glenn Morris, director of the UF Emerging Pathogens Institute and the grant’s principal investigator.
The project is broken down into three parts, 
Morris said. 
First, the study works to find the psychologi-
cal impacts on individuals and their families. Sec-ond, it tries to determine what makes a commu-nity better able to deal with this kind of a disaster or its community resilience. Finally , it is to verify the safety of the seafood in the area, focusing on non-commercial fishers.
Another aspect of the analysis, Morris said, 
is the community outreach and education pro-gram.UF gets $6.5 million grant

Monday’s question: Are you ex-cited for the Harry Potter movie? 64% YES36% NO
87 TOTAL VOTESToday’s question: Can you “pray away the gay?”
Saturday night at the club downtown could get a bit more 
expensive in the near future, and contrary to the city’s hopes, we don’t think  that’s going to attract more custom-
ers.
The City of Gainesville could be eliminating free parking 
downtown — a move city officials hope will attract more busi-ness to the area. The 77  free spots would get meters.
They contend that people planning to go downtown become 
discouraged when they see that there are no more free parking spots available.  Putting meters in those spots, city officials say , will encourage employees to park further away from their busi-nesses, freeing up the closer spots for potential customers.
We don’t think charging for parking is going to help the mat-
ter.
At a time when students’ pockets  have more lint than coin, 
taking away something that’s free is not the way to go. 
We understand that it will likely produce more parking 
turnover and that the project will likely pay for itself in a few years.
But whether it’s a leisurely lunch or a gin-soaked, stumblin’-
to-your-friend’s-car kind of night, making a trip downtown more expensive will definitely deter students from going at all. 
We already have cheaper options in midtown. And those of 
us who already frequent our beloved dives off University Av-enue (not anyone on this staff, of course) aren’t going to appre-ciate bigger crowds when folks decide that heading downtown isn’t worth it.Don’t Pass Go

should stay free
U.S. needs to swing axes at taxes
What if there were no taxes? Don’t snicker. Would there still be civilization? Would society progress? Would we be more or less technologically ad-
vanced? Would we be more content? 
John Locke talked about natural rights: life, liberty and 
property . He argued that those rights are inherent in all humans. The United States believes in said natural rights. Thomas Jefferson just didn’t want to copy and paste, so he threw out property for pursuit of happiness. Taxation goes against these rights.
Taxation is inherently anti-property . Money is property 
and taxation is the forcible removal of money. Taxation also goes against life and liberty . Let’s say you’ve invested time in starting your own lamp business. When the government 
taxes some of that money, it is taking away property accumu-
lated, which required you to use your life to acquire. Essen-tially, you just wasted a portion of your life for nothing. Taxa-tion takes away liberty , because now you can’t spend your money exactly the way you want to. That’s one less Happy Meal to make you happy.
In essence, the mainstream belief is that we pay taxes to 
have a civilization. People believe that if you take govern-ment, and, by extension, taxes away, things will crumble 
and deteriorate. This simply isn’t true. I would point to the 
skyline of downtown Manhattan. Did taxation build those skyscrapers or did American ingenuity?
We shouldn’t even be forced to pay taxes especially when 
the government is usually incompetent. We spend enormous tax revenues on the sacred public school system, created to prevent “mobocracy ,” yet American public education is a joke. I wonder if we can get refunds for that. 
Republicans, without taxation, wouldn’t be able to go 
to war when they felt like it. Democrats, without taxation, wouldn’t be able to keep welfare recipients breastfeeding.
Abraham Lincoln was the first to institute an income tax 
during the Civil War. Eventually , the Supreme Court stood up for the Constitution, something it barely does anymore, and declared an income tax uncon-stitutional at the time. Then Congress passed the 16th Amendment, making it  legal to tax income. That was the game changer. 
Taxes destroy wealth and revenues 
decrease, so in response, taxes are in-creased to raise revenues, which de-stroys even more wealth, and so the cycle continues to spiral out of control. 
Government doesn’t create wealth nor simply redistribute it; it destroys wealth.
Taxation is also a way to tip the balance. If you want to 
lower smoking rates, then slap a “sin tax” on cigarettes to 
make them less attractive to buyers. If you want to encour -
age having children, then give people tax credits for having 
children. The kicker is when you tax people making lots of money , you’re essentially discouraging people from making money . 
Another problem with our progressive tax system is that 
the more you make, the greater the percentage of income the government takes. This implies that everyone should have more equal incomes. A progressive tax system is class war -
fare. Government should not perpetuate class warfare that ultimately divides it citizenry. Ask anyone and they’ll tell you that Democrats are for the poor and working class and Republicans are for the rich. That’s horrendous.
Taxation is also antithetical to personal responsibility . 
Taxation supposedly leads to this loving government that provides for the common good with all its nifty programs which people become reliant on: health care, food stamps and housing. Who in their right mind would work and take 
responsibility if they didn’t have to?
They say two things are for certain: death and taxes. I’d 
like to narrow that down to one.

letters@alligator.orgWhy You Mad?
The saddest part about 
all of this? Not a sliver of surprise was felt by 
any of us.
But when you’re dealing 
with presidential candidate and Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, such is to be ex-pected. 
It didn’t take long for the 
patron saint of verbal and intellectual diarrhea to shift the waves of attention away from her slight oversight of 
christening Waterloo, Iowa, 
the birthplace of the quintes-sential American alpha male, John Wayne, when it actu-ally is known as the home of John Wayne Gacy Jr., a clown-costume-wearing boy rapist / serial killer (can’t tell you how many times we’ve 
made that slip-up). Now she’s 
upping the ante with reports that claim the clinic she and her husband own engages in therapy that encourages ho-mosexual patients to rewire their sexual drives to com-mit to the Lord’s vision of an all-heterosexual order. Glory , 
glory, hallelujah!
But our main qualm isn’t with her and her husband’s 
alleged looney-toon hypoth-esis, one that has been com-pletely defecated on by every credible piece of scientific and medical research that doesn’t come with pictures for you to color in. This is America; it is 
your constitutional right to 
believe whatever you want — no matter how illogical or ri-diculous it may be. Our main qualm is that a candidate who has spent her whole political career selling herself to her conservative base as an out-spoken champion of Christian 
values is now distancing her -
self from it because it could be 
— heaven forbid — just a tad too detrimental to her politi-cal prospects. Once again, she proves that G.O.P . God has the power to conquer any-thing —  expect poll figures. She should just, for the lack of 
a better word, “come out” and 
say , “Why you mad? Yeah, we try to cure homos; get off our touched-by-an-angel met-aphorical nuts!”

End of series inspires reflection for entire generation
By NICOLE LA HOZ
avenue writer
Four thousand pages defined a generation. 
Young adults delved into the story of The Boy Who Lived for 
almost nine years. They discovered an enchanting school, pure evil and what it means to be brave. They learned about true bonds of friendship, sacrifice, betrayal, leadership and love.
More than any other literature, the “Harry Potter” series helped 
define the lives of the current generation of college undergradu -
ates, who grew up with Harry, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Perhaps no other literature was as wholly accepted by a single de -
mographic the way J.K. Rowling’s life works were accepted by this generation.
In 2001, the story of Harry Potter came to life in theaters. Audi-
ences followed Harry’s journey through the Wizarding world for 10 years. The movie franchise became legendary, earning $6.3 billion 
in the box office.
When the eighth film, “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: 
Part 2,”premieres at midnight, it will mark the end of the series. 
Rowling began narrating the story of Harry Potter, a seemingly 
normal boy who discovers he’s a wizard, in 1998. Within each of 
the seven books, Rowling develops characters who experience the hardships of growing up: loss, love, finding courage.
Hannah Herrero, a second-year geography student at UF, said 
the series was the highlight of her childhood. She remembers re -ceiving “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” as a Christmas 
present in kindergarten. The book nudged her to read. 
“Once I started reading them, I was hooked,” Herrero said. “I 
don’t know what Rowling’s secret ingredient is.”
Herrero said going to Hogwarts with Harry and his friends is a 
way to completely “escape your reality.” The books and movies ap-
peal to all ages — from the generation who clutched these books throughout their teenage years to their parents, who have been just as enveloped in the series.
Sonya Cronin, who teaches religion and 20th-century fantasy 
literature at Florida State University, said when the class weaves into Rowling’s works, her stu -
dents give resounding applause. 
“People are invested in it,” she said. “It’s inti-
mately important for a lot of people.”
Whether it’s the date Harry’s parents died or 
his family’s lineage, Cronin said readers know more about Harry Potter than actual history. 
Fantasy literature becomes so crucial, Cronin said, because 
people lead hard lives; they need an aspect of escape or consola-tion. Some people escape by watching sports. Others play music. Others write poems. Others read about Aurors and Death Eaters.
“It takes you into another realm — another world — where all 
dreamy possibilities can happen,” she said. “We know what it means to take the Hogwarts Express.”
The “Harry Potter” books and films, Cronin said, have given this generation a common language. She recalled a speech given to 
the University of Chicago in the 1970s. The speaker said that gen-
eration didn’t have a common text; there wasn’t a book everyone could relate to.
“‘Harry Potter’ changed that,” Cronin said. “‘Harry Potter’ has 
given this generation something meaningful.”
First-year nursing student Olivia de Jong waited to cross the 
U.S.-Canadian border during a summer trip to Canada in 2001 to pick up an English copy of “The Sorcerer’s Stone.”
“That was something I always looked forward to,” she said. “It’s 
weird not having that book to read.”
The magical aspects captivated de Jong; every spell, Patronus 
and curse. The themes of friendship and camaraderie, however, captivated her the most.
“I realized that instead of having a lot of friends, I wanted a few 
that you’re really, really close with,” she said.
The series, de Jong said, became her teenage foundation. She 
read about Hermione Granger — the academic overachiever — pick -
ing up books for recreation. De Jong wanted to be studious after 
seeing Hermione check out hefty books for “a bit of light reading.” 
It helped her keep a straight-A GPA in middle and high school.
There was emptiness after the seventh and final “Harry Pot-
ter” book was published. De Jong, like others, grew up reading and waiting for new books almost every summer.
 “I had post-Potter syndrome,” she said.  “And at the end of the 
eighth movie, I’m definitely crying.”Photos courtesy of the official Warner Brothers “Harry Potter” Facebook page
The “Harry Potter” film series will premier its eighth and final installment at midnight tonight, 10 years after 
it started. The epic book series helped shape the teenage years of many young adults, so to pay tribute, we 
decided to make today’s Avenue an entire four-page section of HP-related stories. Read up and enjoy!mischief managed
Adapting a book to a feature-
length film is a near-impossible task. 
As a fan, you want the films to mim-
ic the books as closely as possible. As 
a producer, your goal is to make a mov -
ie accessible to all audiences. Making 
everyone happy is an unrealistic goal.
I grew up with the “Harry Potter” 
books, just as many of you did. The series has played a defining role in our developmental years, and, on a wider scale, in pop culture as a whole. Since the books have been an ever-present 
force in my life, I tend to be a lot more 
unforgiving with these films than with other book adaptations.
With that said, the “Harry Potter” 
films gave their best effort to bring to life the stories we read in the books. On Rotten Tomatoes, every film has received 80 percent or higher — aside from a rightly deserved 78 percent 
from 2009’s “Half Blood Prince,” and 
a surprisingly low 79 percent from 2010’s “Deathly Hallows Part 1.”
I felt the first three films did the 
books proper justice. Shorter page lengths meant less content that had to be covered in the average run time of about two hours. This gave more time for the films to touch on the little details, which we don’t see much of in 
the later films. Seeing Hogwarts, Quid-
ditch and the Whomping Willow on screen for the first time were amazing experiences. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson immediately captured our hearts as young Harry, Ron and Hermione.
Gilderoy Lockhart was played ex-
ceptionally well by Kenneth Branagh 
in “The Chamber of Secrets,” as was 
Sirius Black by Gary Oldman in “The Prisoner of Azkaban.” The third film was presented in a much darker, grit-tier tone compared with the magical fantasy world painted in the first two. Even the costumes were different, with untucked shirts and scarves arranged different ways, rather than the cookie-
cutter clones in the first two movies.
The fourth film in the series, “The 
Goblet of Fire,” is where things start 
to break down a bit. There just isn’t enough time in a two-and-a-half-hour-long movie to effectively execute 730 pages of de -
tails. Obvi-
ously, things 
had to be cut. The first three books could have been shot scene-
for-scene, but the fourth was the turn-ing point where content important to the book, such as Hermione’s Society 
for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare 
(‘spew,’ according to Ron), was cut out to shorten the run time. The action se -
quences in the Triwizard Tournament are still strong, albeit a bit shallow. 
“The Order of the Phoenix” con-
tinues the struggle of run time versus page length. With plenty of content cut, only the bare bones of the story 
remain. Harry’s relationship with Cho 
Chang feels a bit rushed and out of place, but the movie is saved by Imelda Staunton’s perfect portrayal of every -
one’s least favorite Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Dolo -
res Umbridge. Staunton does a sicken-ingly sweet job of making viewers hate Umbridge just as much as they did in the books. 
“The Half-Blood Prince” is easily the 
weakest film, in my opinion. It plays out like a rushed Wikipedia entry. There is an over-simplified mention of the Hor -
cruxes, a quiet revelation of the true identity of the Half-Blood Prince and an awkward scene where The Bur -
row gets burned to the ground. Not to mention the final few moments of the 
film, which are the worst of the series. 
Harry stands around like a frightened puppy while Snape kills Dumbledore instead of being immobilized and un-able to help, as he was in the book. It made Harry look like a pansy and Dumbledore a weak old man. 
Also, there wasn’t even a mention 
of Dumbledore’s funeral. We had a 
15-minute cry fest when Edward — 
erm, Cedric Diggory — died  in “Goblet of Fire.” But when Dumbledore dies, we don’t get a sufficient scene to ap-preciate the magnitude of his murder. This was monumental in the books: Harry established that he wouldn’t be returning next year, couldn’t maintain a relationship with Ginny and that he was going to hunt down Voldemort 
once and for all. 
Dumbledore’s character gets the 
short end of the stick in the films. In the 
books, he is a wise, intimidating, pow -
erful and respected teacher wrapped up in a calming demeanor — truly, one of the better literary characters of all time. In the films, he comes off as a smart, goofy old man. The late Richard 
Harris’ portrayal of Dumbledore was 
much stronger than that of current actor Michael Gambon, who plays a Dumbledore that loses a lot of depth. 
The films are what they are. I do 
enjoy them, and I can understand why certain scenes were cut or ignored. For the most part, I think the films have done a great job in portraying the 
main aspect of the books. Breaking 
up the final novel into two films was a great decision, as the first part spent its time efficiently setting the stage for the epic conclusion.thursday, july 14, 2011 u ALLIGATOR, 9
“Harry Potter” films portrayed book series as best as possiblethe movie column 

The boy who lived has come to die. 
Tonight, ending the 10-year-old 
movie series, Harry Potter makes his last appearance on the big screen in “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: 
Part 2.” 
Although this sad ending to a magi -
cal era has come, Potter fans are still 
psyched for the movie premiere, rum-maging through their closets to find all their Potter attire and memorabilia. 
From wands to cloaks, UF students 
are making their Harry Potter loyalty known. 
When purchasing tickets a month 
in advance, Judy Tran, 20, was hit with 
the harsh realization that even a 30-
day head start only got her tickets to 
the 3-D showing. 
“We wanted regular tickets,” Tran 
said, “but they were already sold out, 
even though we thought we were way 
ahead of the game.”Not having an actual cloak, she 
plans to wear a black Snuggie back -
wards along with her wand from the 
Wizarding World of Harry Potter theme park and a popular Deathly Hallows necklace. 
Some didn’t waste their time grab-
bing tickets to a Gainesville showing. 
Ashley Florestal, 19, who read the first 
novel in 1997, flew all the way to New York City for the red-carpet premiere. Her father surprised her with tickets to 
the Monday showing. 
“I’ve been camping out since Sat-
urday night,” Florestal said Sunday. 
“But I’ve met people who have been here since Wednesday.”
Waiting on the streets of New York 
City, she was surprised by a pizza deliv -
ery from Tom Felton. Daniel Radcliffe also surprised the crowd by showing up for an autograph signing.
“We looked eye-to-eye and it was 
magical,” Florestal said.
Although Tran and Florestal were 
fortunate to grab tickets for early showings of the epic finale, others are going to have to make do with a later 
showing on Friday. 
Members of the Inter-Residence 
Hall Association will have to wait until 
morning to witness the end of this era because of an executive retreat today. Ashley Richey and Courtney Read still plan to dress up all day to show their support. Although Read will don a Gryffindor robe, she says she is dedi-
cated to Hufflepuff and proud of it. 
Richey believes if her invitation to 
Hogwarts ever came, the Sorting Hat 
would place her in Ravenclaw. She car -
ries a Time-Turner in her Harry Potter backpack, which she usually stores under the “Platform 9 3/4” sign in her room.
Jodine Castin is going to proudly 
wear her Muggle T-shirt to the movie Friday morning. Although she won’t make it for the premiere, she is certain theaters will be packed.
“I feel sad, but really, all good things 
have to come to an end,” Castin said.10, ALLIGATOR u thursday, july 14, 2011

“Accio guitar, keys and drums!”
Harry and the Potters, the popular band that plays songs based 
on J.K. Rowling’s series, will be stopping in Gainesville on Saturday. The band will play a free show at the Alachua County Library District Headquarters, 401 E University Ave., at 2 p.m. in Meeting Room A.
The show is the band’s first in Gainesville in three years.Brothers Paul and Joe DeGeorge make up the wizard rock band. 
They started in 2002 and have performed in venues such as librar -
ies, doughnut shops, pedestrian bridges and residential bathrooms, according to their website.
The idea for Harry and the Potters came from reading the books, 
Paul DeGeorge said. 
“I thought it would be cool if Harry Potter had 
his own band,” he said
To him, Harry resembles some of DeGeorge’s 
musical heroes like Bruce Springsteen and Conor Oberst of Bright Eyes because they, like Harry, stand up for what they believe in.
Paul and Joe portray Harry Potter from two 
points of time onstage: what Harry would write 
about while at school, and how Harry would comment on the differ -
ences between the Wizarding world and the Muggle world in which he was raised, DeGeorge said.
People who have never seen Harry and the Potters “can expect 
to participate in the battle against evil through the power of rock ‘n’ roll,” DeGeorge said.
Weaving around the country on their latest tour filled with per -
forming, sleeping and eating tacos, Paul and Joe will have the op-portunity to see “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2” to -
night at midnight while in Orlando for LeakyCon.
DeGeorge is free of expectations for the last installment. Al-
though the movies are entertaining, he said, the band has always been more about the books, which have given DeGeorge a creative outlet.
“For me, it’s totally changed my life,” DeGeorge said.Harry and the

For those of you who read this section with any 
regularity (are there any of you like that? You should tweet me; I’d love to meet you), you know 
my Off The Record column is mostly about music. There is nothing I appreciate more than music.
Except Harry Potter.I appreciate the hell out of the “Harry Potter” se-
ries, created by novelist/mastermind J.K. Rowling. In fact, I appreciate the series just as much as my favor -
ite record of all time and just as much as any UF foot-ball championship — both of which are saying a lot.
It took me years to pick up the first novel in the 
series. When I was in fourth grade, my dad brought home “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone,” a fairly 
small paperback novel with a picture of a nerdy-look -
ing kid flying a broomstick on the cover.
The fourth-grade version of me didn’t understand 
the concept of taking a book recommendation from 
my parents, so on the shelf it sat for years. For some reason I decided to read that first novel a couple of years later, when more books had been added to the series. I will always remember the first sentence.
“Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, 
were proud to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much.”
So began a long journey through reading exactly 
4,100 pages about that nerdy-looking kid with a light-ning-bolt scar on his forehead. You don’t need to hear any story about how I waited in line at midnight to buy the seventh and final novel, then read it in two days — you probably did the same yourself. 
Instead, the point of this column is to try, in some 
way, to express the magnitude of what this series has meant to me and to our generation. I’m about to start my third year here at UF, and those of you who are of a similar age know that we quite literally grew up with Harry, Ron and Hermione. 
The first film in the series was released on No -
vember 16, 2001. I had a birthday party at a movie theater to watch it, since my 11th birthday was on October 27 . I turned 11, and we watched a group of 
first-year Hogwarts students when they were 11.
Now I’m 20, and even though Harry Potter is supposed to be 17 in this 
last film, we all know very well that he acts beyond his years. For only a 17-year-old, he has survived a phenom-
enal amount of life-threat-
ening situations and knows a great deal about magic. Even if he’s not that great at Transfiguration, and even if he isn’t the best at getting to Diagon Alley via Floo pow -
der, he makes up for it by being the most courageous teenager in wizard or Muggle history.
As I’m sure most of you did, I learned a lot through 
reading the “Harry Potter” series. Never, in any novel, have I felt the identification with the characters, the complete immersion in another world. The same can be said for most of you: Never again will there be a novel or series that we completely obsess over like we did this one.
Never again will you get jitters when Harry ap-
proaches Cho Chang in the hallway for the first time. 
Never again will your jaw drop when Dumbledore dies 
on page 596. Never again will you feel your heart dive into your stomach when Hedwig takes an Avada Ke -
davra curse on the way to The Burrow. Never again will you laugh at a ridiculous prank pulled by the Wea-sley twins.
So it’s okay if you want to cry when “Harry Potter 
and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2” starts at midnight tonight. It’s okay if you want to cry throughout the 
entire damn movie, because you’ve never witnessed 
the end of something like this.
Except you should know that — if you want — you 
will always be able to experience those things. Even if you’ve read each novel 20 times and watched each film dozens more, Harry Potter will never fade. He will forever be immortalized in those 4,100 pages and eight movies. Whenever you want, no matter how old you are or what job you’re doing, you can easily es-
cape to that Wizarding world if you want to.
And all will be well.thursday, july 14, 2011   u ALLIGATOR, 11

Most Harry Potter fans have been 
clinging to every word spoken from the 
genius mouth of J.K. Rowling since the last book of the “Harry Potter” series came out, hoping for anything new. 
It’s safe to say that fans are now 
getting just that, and it comes in an ex-citing bundle called Pottermore.
There has been a mysterious air to 
the Pottermore name, and many in the Muggle community have been spread-ing rumors faster than the Weasley twins can get detention.
Rowling recently abated the growing 
amount of curiosity, however. She and the Pottermore team have partnered with Sony to create a unique online 
reading experience for fans of all ages. 
“Sony’s association with J.K. Rowl-
ing’s Pottermore brings together one 
of the world’s most innovative brands with the most successful book series in history, in a pioneering partnership that will help shape the future of story-telling,” said Sir Howard Stringer, chair -
man, CEO and president of Sony Corp.
Many have longed for an online 
video game similar to World of War -
craft where gamers can immerse themselves in the world of Harry Potter. While that isn’t exactly what Pottermore offers, it’s a step in that direction. 
According to the press release, Pot-
termore offers a free online experience 
focused around reading the series.Pottermore users will delve into 
the Wizarding world by casting spells, being sorted into a house by the Sort-ing Hat and receiving a wand from The Wand Chooser, which offers over 33,000 possible outcomes.
Rowling also has new information 
to share with her readers about char -
acters, objects and places in the “Har -
ry Potter” series that will be revealed 
throughout the adventure.
“I will be sharing additional infor -
mation I’ve been hoarding for years 
about the world of Harry Potter,” Row -
ing said in her Pottermore announce -
ment video. 
All seven books in the series will 
also be available for purchase as e-books for the first time in the Potter -
more shop.
Pottermore will be unveiled in Oc-
tober, but one million users who com-plete a challenge on July 31 will be able to test out a beta version. 
Pottermore will begin with the first 
book in the series, “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone.” The second book will be added in early 2012, and 
each future book will be added with 
time. 
“I wanted to give something back 
to the fans that have followed Harry so devotedly over the years and to bring the stories to a new digital generation,” Rowling said. “I hope fans and those who are new to Harry have as much fun helping to shape Pottermore as I 
have.”Pottermore next

A current article in “Out” magazine 
profiling Michael Irvin and his relation-
ship with his gay brother is making online headway. Irvin was contrite and especially blunt. He confessed he should have spoke out sooner, but for someone with a flap-jack stack of demons, the Playmaker had precise perspective. “I think growth 
comes when we share. Until we do that, we’re going 
to be stuck in the 
Dark Ages about a lot of things. When a guy steps up and says, ‘This is who I am,’ I guarantee you I’ll give him 
100 percent support. … I’m not gay, but I was afraid to even let anyone have the 
thought. I can only imagine the agony — 
being a prisoner in your own mind — for someone who wants to come out. If I’m not gay and I am afraid to mention it, I can only imagine what an athlete must be go-ing through if he is gay.”

Florida faces a tough schedule in Will Muschamp’s first year at the helm, beginning with the Vols in Week 
3. UF plays reigning national champion Auburn in Jordan-Hare Stadium, while hosting ‘Bama and FSU. 
n THIS IS THE FOURTH 
INSTALLMENT OF A FIVE-PART SERIES EXAMINING GATORS FOOTBALL FOR THE 2011 SEASON.  
By MATT WATTS
Alligator Staff Writer
mwatts@alligator.org
 
The Gators have much to 
overcome in coach Will Mus-
champ’s first year, but one of 
the biggest obstacles out of their control is the schedule. 
Not since 2006, a year featur -
ing games against six ranked teams, has Florida faced such a daunting Southeastern Confer -
ence lineup. 
But unlike Tim Tebow and 
Percy Harvin’s first year on campus, there’s no hope of a championship this season. 
The Gators will be trying to merely survive. 
After opening with the usual 
non-conference warm-up games (Florida Atlantic on Sept. 3 and 
Alabama-Birmingham on Sept. 
10), Florida welcomes Tennes-see to Ben Hill Griffin Stadium on Sept. 17. 
The Vols are in their second 
year under new coach Derek Dooley and, despite being ig-nored by most pundits, they have some weapons that could 
give Florida trouble. 
Sophomore receivers Jus-
tin Hunter (6-foot-4, 200) and 
Da’Rick Rogers (6-foot-3, 215) both present matchup problems 
for UF’s diminutive corners. 
Hunter averaged more than 
25 yards per catch last season 
and scored seven touchdowns 
— a Tennessee freshman re-
cord.No. 2: Schedule -

Gay it forward: It’s time for a 
sports superstar to come out
See JeSSe, PAGe 19UF ReCRUITING
By BRYAN HOLT
Alligator Writer
 
In an age where high school athletes 
can become Internet sensations over -
night, teenage YouTube stars are no 
longer uncommon. 
But when a 6-foot-4, 222-pound ris-
ing high school junior proves he is one of the most athletic prep football play-ers in the nation, people still listen.
Yulee High running back Derrick 
Henry has taken the recruiting land-
scape by storm after a sophomore sea-
son in which he had 303 carries for 2,689 yards and 38 touchdowns. 
“I’m just a one-cut back,” he said. “If 
I get one cut, then I’m gone.”
His sophomore highlight reel proves 
his point. The video shows a tower -
ing speedster rumbling through over -matched defenses, breaking tackles 
with ease and consistently outrunning 
defensive backs en route to touchdown after touchdown. 
But while his on-field prowess has 
gotten the 2013 prospect verbal offers from Florida, Florida State and Georgia, 
it was his performance at a March combine in Orlando that garnered 
him an invitation to Nike’s “The Opening” showcase last week.
In Beaverton, Ore., 
Henry became a na-tional finalist in the 
SPARQ Rating National Champion-ship, finishing fourth in the finals after running a 4.45 40-yard-dash, register -Dynamic back drawing

ing a 38.5-inch vertical jump 
and tossing a six-pound ball 41 feet from his knees. He was 
part of the Alpha Talon team 
that won the weekend’s 7-on-
7 tournament.
“It was my first time going 
out there, so I just wanted to enjoy the experience and take it all in,” Henry said. 
While it is very early in his 
college recruitment, Henry, a 
life-long Gators fan, said UF 
is his leader. Playing in a pro-style offense at Yulee, the run-ning back likes the addition of Charlie Weis and is building a strong bond with Florida’s coaching staff.
“I was very impressed,” 
Henry said of his last meeting with UF coaches. “I went and 
talked to those guys about the offense and how they want to 
use me if I come there. They broke down my film and told me what I need to work on and what they expect out of 
me.”
Henry admits he needs to 
improve on blitz pickup and 
catching the ball out of the backfield. However, he scoffs at colleges who say his size would be better utilized at 
linebacker.
“People have their opin-
ions, but that’s just what 
people do,” he said. “I’m not even going to listen to it. I 
know I’m a running back, so 
it doesn’t really faze me.”
With two years of high 
school football left, Henry is relaxed and having fun with the recruiting process be-cause he knows it only hap-
pens once. He doesn’t plan to 
orally commit anywhere until his senior season but already has his eyes set on next year’s “The Opening.”
“They’re inviting me 
again,” he said. “Next year it’s going to be business, so I’ll have to go and do what 
needs to be done.”THURSDAY, JULY 14, 2011 n ALLIGATOR, 19
Homosexuality is an uncom-
fortable topic anywhere, but it’s 
an especially sore subject in sports. Although gays have made signifi-cant inroads in today’s society — 
the recent New York legislation 
and removal of the military “Don’t ask, Don’t tell” policy specifically — until the sports world accepts homosexuals equally, universal discrimination will not diminish. 
I don’t believe I’m overstating 
this.  
Like it or not, we’ve boosted 
our physical heroes to demigods and kings. 
No longer are athletes’ domain 
simply sports. We obsess over their fashion, sexual dalliances, musical tastes and political interests.  
The sports world, almost more 
than any other aspect in the coun-try, can act as the leading platform 
for change. 
Although the negative stigma 
of gays in society has slowly begun 
to fade, the resistance in sports has been as unyielding as the Berlin Wall. But it too, is ready to crum-ble.
As courageous as it was for 
John Amaechi, Johnny Weir, Billie 
Jean King and others to come out, 
people barely batted an eye. 
As brave and audacious it was 
for Phoenix Suns CEO and top NBA executive for three decades Rick Welts to admit he was gay, people shrugged their shoulders. 
Each circumstance, despite the 
fresh dialogue, were merely a blip on the sports Richter scale.  
America needs a face. We need someone that’s re-
vered, idolized and venerated. We need someone that exudes swag and masculinity or beauty and 
femininity. We need someone to 
stand up and help tear down the barriers of stigmas and stereo-types. 
We need a gay Kobe Bryant, a 
homosexual Peyton Manning or a lesbian Serena Williams. 
Irvin and Charles Barkley have 
become outspoken in their support 
for equality and transparency. Both 
are admirable for their efforts, but many more sports personalities and stars are needed to help mar -
ginalize the intolerance.  
In a sports world full of domi-
nant African-American athletes, black heroes specifically possess the most unique position in the 
fight against bigotry. 
As Sir Charles, Irvin and pro-
lific sports writer Jason Whitlock 
all admitted, discrimination is discrimination, no matter the skin color, religious belief or sexual ori-entation. 
Admittedly, I am no saint. I 
have made my share of slurs and 
ill-conceived, über-macho gaycist 
remarks. But it’s 2011, and enough is enough. 
The time has come for a promi-
nent gay athlete to emerge and lead the resistance against discrim-
ination and prejudice. 
America needs a gay Tim 
Tebow to take the road less trav-
eled.JESSE , from page 18

No. 4 - Alabama
Coming off a three-loss campaign, Alabama has 
lost its tag as national championship favorites and it may be the better for it. With the only major casualty on defense coming from NFL first-rounder Marcell Dareus, the Tide will have the most vaunted front-seven in the nation with an equally dominant 
safety tandem of senior Mark Barron and junior 
Robert Lester. The linebacking corps is as solid 
as it comes with Dont’a Hightower holding down 
the middle and Courtney Upshaw (7 sacks) as the 
jack linebacker. Offensively, the Tide have multiple question marks. With the departures of QB Greg McElroy, WR Julio Jones and 2009 Heisman winner Mark Ingram at RB, Alabama will rely heavily on halfback Trent Richardson. The junior rushed for 
700 yards as Ingram’s backup, but he showed 
glimpses as the top back in the SEC. The Tide open 
2011 with a tough trip to Penn State in Week 2. 2011 Outlook

LSU coach Les Miles returns a talented squad 
this year, but the Tigers will face challenges early and often with a loaded schedule. Three of their first four games are on the road, highlighted by games against Oregon, Mississippi State and West Virginia. LSU’s defense should be stout with linebacker Ryan Baker anchoring a top-10 unit from a year ago, but its offense will need to improve considerably. In 2010, senior QB Jordan Jefferson led the second worst attack in the SEC. The mobile QB will have fellow senior Jarrett Lee and former Georgia transfer Zach Mettenberger ready to step in if his turnover issues continue. If the quarterback position can be sorted out, Miles could finally have a squad with offensive prowess as receivers Rueben Randle and Russell Shepard return.2011 OutlookNo. 3 - LSU

John Boothe and Jesse Morgan / Alligator StaffGators face brutal October with ‘Bama, LSU, Auburn and Georgia
  Should the Gators get past the Vols, it’s 
possible they enter the meat of their sched-
ule undefeated at 4-0, as a trip to Kentucky 
on Sept. 24 should be manageable. But it’s 
all uphill from there.
  A brutal October begins with a home 
game against Alabama, a consensus pre-
season top-ﬁ  ve team. 
The Crimson Tide will be ready after 
early tests at Penn State on Sept. 10 and 
against Arkansas on Sept. 24. 
While a win in this matchup is doubt-
ful, the game will be a great barometer for how the rest of the difﬁ  cult season is likely to play out. 
  After Alabama, Florida hits the road for 
games against LSU (Oct. 8) and Auburn 
(Oct. 15) before playing Georgia in Jack-
sonville on Oct. 29. 
In all likelihood, that means four 
straight against ranked opponents, includ-ing two teams (Alabama, LSU) that are ex-
pected to compete for a national title. 
  Then, following a miniature break 
against Vanderbilt for Homecoming, the 
Gators again will be tested against a po-
tential top-10 team when they travel to Co-
lumbia, S.C., to take on South Carolina. 
  The Steve Spurrier-led Gamecocks are 
the favorites to win the Eastern Division this year, returning the nucleus of a team that ﬁ  nished in the Top 25 for the ﬁ  rst time since 2001. 
But with LSU and Alabama absent from 
its schedule, South Carolina may not be 
tested until the week prior to the UF game when it plays at Arkansas.
  Coming to The Swamp 
on Nov. 26, Florida State is also expected to be in the hunt for a championship. 
If Muschamp hasn’t sold the house he 
owns with Seminoles coach Jimbo Fisher by then, expect it to make national news. 
But the real story will be how UF caps its ﬁ  rst season under the new regime.
  With a relatively young team playing in 
new systems, expect some growing pains. 
Florida may lose a game it shouldn’t, while 
also winning a game in which it is drastic underdogs.
 Appearing recently on a College Foot-
ball Live special, Muschamp was asked if 
he expects the Gators to surpass last sea-
son’s 8-5 ﬁ  nish.  
“Well, certainly,” he said. “I have high 
expectations for our football team. ... We 
do have some deﬁ  ciencies, like everyone 
does.”
Translation:  The Gator Nation should 
be happy with a repeat of last year.
