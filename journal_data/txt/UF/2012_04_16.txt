Students aren’t the only ones 
protesting cuts to UF’s Com-
puter and Information Science and Engineering department. 
The faculty is ﬁ  ghting, too.
The state budget for the 
2012-13 ﬁ  scal year will reduce 
the College of Engineering’s 
budget by 5.86 percent. Dean 
Cammy Abernathy’s plan to deal with the roughly $4-mil-lion reduction involves moving 
computer engineering degree 
programs to the Electrical and Computer Engineering depart-ment, eliminating staff and 
teaching assistant positions and 
emphasizing teaching.
CISE faculty members were 
shocked at the proposal, said associate professor Manuel Ber-mudez. Professors have joined about 3,000 supporters of an 
online petition and are working 
to create alternative plans.
“People are scratching their 
heads, wondering why such a 
damaging, harmful action to the 
university’s prestige would be taken in a unilateral manner,” Bermudez said. “Colleagues from other universities are con-
tacting them, asking, ‘What the 
heck is going on?’”

IN MEMORIAM
  TYLER JETT
 Alligator Staff Writer
  One Monday in February, Michael R. Ed-
monds Jr. carried a baby squirrel into his 7:25 
a.m. editing lab.
  The squirrel fell from a tree, Edmonds told 
classmates. He wrapped it in his jacket so it wouldn’t freeze. He was going to take it to a 
veterinarian’s ofﬁ  ce, he said. He wrote about the incident on his Facebook page.
  “O nothin’, just chillin with a squirrel in a 
sock!” he posted two days later.
  “He was a very kind and caring person,” 
said Sarah Kinonen, 21, a fellow journalism major and an Alligator staffer. “He always made me laugh, and I thought he was always 
very nice.”
  On Sunday evening, Edmonds, a 26-year-
old journalism student, died after falling from the upper levels of Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Staidum. 
He was found on the sidewalk on the north-west corner of the stadium near Gate 4. 
An investigation was still open Sunday 
night, but University Police spokesman Maj. Brad Barber said the death is most likely a 
suicide.
  “This is a tremendous tragedy,” he said.
  Ashley Gregory, a 20-year-old microbiol-ogy junior, said she was meeting with a cam-
pus organization near the stadium when she 
heard a thud. Soon after, two women ran to their group and told them a man fell.
  They found Edmonds lying at the base of 
a tree on the sidewalk. Three people were giv-ing him CPR, she said. Gregory called 911 at 
7:02 p.m., and two minutes later, emergency 
workers arrived on the scene.  
  On Sunday night, Edmonds’ friends re-
called a man who was passionate about cy-cling, journalism and animals, who wanted to write for magazines and who lost more 
than 100 pounds riding bikes.
  Edmonds was a member of Team Florida 
Cycling — “Director of Humor & Vulgarity,” he wrote on his Facebook page.
  “He was a great guy, one of the best team 
members we ever had,” said Richard J. Bun-ing, an ofﬁ  cer on the team. “He was always 
one of the ﬁ  rst guys to sign up to do some-thing.”
  But in February, Edmonds suffered sev-
eral fractured vertebrae after he was hit by a car while riding with his teammates. He 
hadn’t been able to ride since, and he was 
constrained to a back brace.
  Edmonds expressed frustration on his 
Twitter account about having to watch races from the sidelines. 
“I never knew it was possible to miss 
something this bad,” he wrote. “...can we rewind life and restore my back? I NEED to 
ride a bike.”
  On Friday, he expressed several frustra-
tions, among them his dissatisfaction with Shands at UF and his health insurance com-
pany. Then, on Saturday morning, he was ar-rested for driving under the inﬂ  uence.
  “I just want to apologize to my friends, 
family and those close to me,” he wrote on 
his Facebook page. “I f—d 
up...bad.”
  On Sunday many of 
his friends spoke warmly about Edmonds. Kristen 
Bowe, a member of the cy-cling team, said Edmonds’ 
ﬁ  rst thought after the acci-dent was for the well-being of his dog, Conrad. He was 
worried about how Conrad would eat and who would walk him. 
Members of the cycling team said Ed-
monds was open about issues he had in the past, and that cycling was one of the things that made him the happiest.
  “He was disappointed he couldn’t ride his bike,” Buning said. “It was a big part of his 
life.”
  Edmonds recently bought a new bike, and 
he brought it to class, showing it to his teach-er and teaching assistant. 
He was also passionate about journalism, 
his friends said. On Oct. 18, he wrote his ﬁ  rst article for the Alligator.
  “Even though he was really hurt and in a 
lot of pain he would stay up late in the jour-nalism labs ﬁ  nishing his design project,” said 
Bowe, a 24-year-old mass communications graduate student. “He was very dedicated to 
school.”

April 17, 1985: The UF Faculty Club organizes a 
series of functions geared toward encouraging sin-
gle members to form potential relationships with 
other UF staff members. Gary Cook, the official 
spokesman for the group, said the activities serve as a more professional venue than bars or clubs.
April 20, 1988:  A stripper is sent to perform 
during class for Winston Nagan, a jurisprudence professor at UF’s law school. Corinne Heller, the student who contacted the stripper, said the show was conservative and done in good taste. “It was certainly the most unique one I’d ever gotten,” Na-
gan said. “I teach a broad view of jurisprudence, 
and they must have taken it literally.”
April 16, 1991: A Student Senate examination of 
the Gay and Lesbian Student Union’s goals deems 
the group “non-political” — a designation making 
it eligible for Student Government funding.
April 16, 1992: A committee of UF officials 
decides on a standard logo for the University of Florida. Jack Battenfield, assistant vice president of 
university relations, presented the logo featuring 
a Palatino typeface with the traditional state seal. Before the decision, the school logo had never been adopted officially throughout the university.
April 16, 2004: A UF sophomore who attempted 
to arrange a sexual encounter with a 15-year-old girl, reports show, is in jail. Scott Effman, 20, is ac-cused of sending an instant message to Gainesville detectives portraying the girl on the Internet. After 
reportedly asking her questions such as, “What is 
your bra size?” the student arranged a meeting and was arrested at the meeting place.

The virus is lethal and highly con-
tagious. If unleashed in Gainesville, it 
would infect most UF students by the end of September.
Fortunately, the Muizenberg Math-
ematical Fever exists only in a game invented by Juliet Pulliam of UF’s Emerging Pathogens Institute.
Pulliam, 32, helped create a fictional 
virus as part of a simulation that teach-es mathematicians to quantify how vi-ruses such as HIV and MRSA spread through populations.
As of now, Pulliam’s game is low-
tech. It involves passing out slips of pa-per to researchers who randomly select colleagues as victims. Last week, how-ever, UF computer scientists expressed interest in creating a larger-scale, digi-tal version for students.
“When you make a mistake in a 
video game, you get to hit the reset but-
ton and try again,” said game creator 
Jonathan Yuhas of UF’s Digital Worlds Institute. “We can give you a chance to mess up without getting killed.”
In January, Digital Worlds founded 
Serious and Applied Gaming Environ-ments, or SAGE, the first UF initiative dedicated solely to tackling real-world problems with computer games.
Yuhas, 29, developed shooting games for a major commercial game studio before joining SAGE last year.
Now he builds mini-games to in-
form science, engineering and math students about the risks of plagiarism. Marston Science Library commissioned SAGE for the project after about 80 stu-
dents were caught cheating in March.
Digital Worlds director James Oliv-
erio, who oversees SAGE, emailed Pul-
liam to propose collaborating. He said they could produce an educational game together, available for iPhone, Android and other platforms, that il-lustrates how outbreaks spread.

When Jennifer Murray left her dorm Wednesday morn-
ing, she expected to be greeted by Florida sunshine.
Instead, the 21-year-old English junior walked into thick 
smoke from nearby wildfires.
With smoke infiltrating the air from several wildfires last 
week, the Alachua County Health Department issued a news-
letter Friday recommending that residents avoid breathing in the smoke for too long.
The department received several calls from citizens ask-
ing whether it is safe to go outside during smoky conditions, said Anthony Dennis, the environmental health director of the Alachua County Health Department.
Dennis said it is safe, but he said it’s best to try to stay 
indoors with the air conditioner running. The department warned citizens that smoke is a “respiratory irritant” that can bother people’s eyes, noses and throats.
Dennis said those with preexisting conditions, such as 
asthma, should be especially careful.
“If they start experiencing any distress, they need to seek 
medical attention immediately,” he said.
The health department has not yet had any injuries re-
ported due to smoke inhalation, Dennis said.
While the smoke seems to be clearing up since Wednes-
day, Dennis said the department has inspectors who will be monitoring conditions for safety.Health officials warn against smoke 
“If they start experiencing any distress, they need 
to seek medical attention immediately.”
Anthony Dennis
Alachua County Health Department environmental health director Bernie Machen on Friday citing the reso-
lution of shared governance passed at last week’s Faculty Senate meeting. The 
letter requests that Abernathy imme-
diately stop all progress toward imple-menting the proposal and to provide an analysis of the effects from the changes.
“We need a solution to this problem, 
and gutting a top department is not the solution,” said associate professor Benja-min Lok.
They also requested the establish-
ment of two university-level committees — one comprised only of Faculty Senate members and one that also includes non-Senate members — to evaluate alterna-tive plans and ensure shared governance 
is followed.
Another request echoed that of the Graduate Assistants United. Both 
groups asked that the deadline for the 
proposal of alternative plans be moved 
from Wednesday to June 15.
Abernathy said she is concerned 
about everyone who would be affected by the cuts.
“Everyone understands this is a very 
difficult time,” she said. “Sooner or later, something has to give, and I think we’ve reached that point.”
Lok said seeing the outpouring of 
support has impressed and energized the faculty. The issue has united profes-sors with current, past and future CISE students because Abernathy’s proposal would impact them all, he said.
“This will do immense harm to the 
reputation of The Gator Nation,” Ber -
mudez said.

Neal Mackowiak, brewer at Alligator Brewing Co., serves samples at the Hogtown 
Craft Beer Festival on Saturday.
� ABOUT 1,500 PEOPLE ATTENDED.
ADRIANNA PAIDAS
Alligator Writer
Dressed in a shirt drenched in sweat and 
splattered with beer, Neal Mackowiak smiled 
at sunburned festival-goers who stopped by his 
pop-up tent. He poured his Habanero pepper-flavored beer into their 4-ounce glasses.
Mackowiak, head brewer at Gainesville’s 
Alligator Brewing Co., was one of 38 brewers from around the state and country who served 
crafted ales, stouts and lagers to young and 
old beer enthusiasts Saturday afternoon at the inaugural Hogtown Craft Beer Festival at Ka-
napaha Botanical Gardens.
“I like brewing the weird stuff,” Mackowiak 
said of the Habanero beer. “That’s what craft beer is all about — being creative and being 
weird.”
About 1,500 people drank light and heavy 
beers infused with ingredients such as hibiscus flowers, pecans, coffee beans and blueberries.
The festival was organized by Hogtown 
Brewers, a nonprofit homebrewing club made up of about 150 local beer-brewing hobbyists.
The club hopes to make the festival an an-
nual, nationally recognized event. Next year, it wants to open the festival to 1,000 more peo-ple, said Mark Tumarkin, an organizer of the event.
Each brewery set up its coolers and kegs 
underneath tents in a grassy clearing at Kanap-
aha Botanical Gardens. About 40 white-topped 
tents bordered clusters of people. Some stood in line for samples while others conversed in 
circles.
Most clutched 4-ounce glasses that they 
used to sample endless concoctions.
A majority of the breweries were micro-
breweries, breweries that produce only enough 
to sell their beer nearby. However, big names 
like Sierra Nevada, Magners Cider and Samuel 
Adams served, too.
Those who attended were excited to try 
something other than the traditional college bar beers.
“I’ve learned that you can pretty much 
make beer out of anything,” said Brent Powell, a 23-year-old UF graduate student.
The festival wasn’t made to be a “drunk-
fest,” said Craig Birkmaier, an organizer of the event. Instead, it was the brainchild of people who appreciate the taste of beer and its various 
flavors.
“We’ve been raised to think — and mass 
markets have made us think — that beer is just this yellow, fizzy , light stuff,” Birkmaier said. 
“We want people to understand that it should have flavor, and it should be savored.”

UF astronomers have found 
evidence that the first planet ever 
photographed outside of the solar system by the Hubble Space Tele-scope may not be the only planet orbiting its host star. The host star is about 25 light years from Earth.The low-mass body, which or -
bits the star Fomalhaut in a ring 
of debris, was discovered by a 
team of researchers, including UF astronomers, using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array in Chile.
In 2008, images of Fomalhaut 
taken by the Hubble Space Tele-scope led to the discovery of “Fo-malhaut b,” the first planet outside of our solar system to be directly 
detected in visible light. But the 
new research has indicated that 
there are two planets shaping the star’s debris ring, according to a UF news release.
“The outer planet is something 
we are proposing,” said Aaron Bo-ley, a Sagan Postdoctoral Fellow at UF and leader of the study.Before this, planet formation 
researchers had only researched planets as distant from their host stars as planets in Earth’s solar sys-tem are from the sun. 
At its farthest point, the new 
planet would orbit Fomalhaut at about 14.5 billion miles away, or about 155 times the distance the Earth is from the sun.Boley said that the next step for 
the astronomers is to look for ma-terial affected by planet gravity in the surrounding debris ring to de-termine the locations and masses of both Fomalhaut b and the new planet. 
He said he hopes the planets 
can be used for research on the early stages of planet formation.

Narayan Ghiotti wove through a crowd of 
people with his 6-year-old brother, Santosh, 
perched on his shoulders, smiling through black-and-white tribal face painting.
They meandered past parents walking 
hand-in-hand with tired children who dragged their feet after a long day at the 43rd annual Santa Fe College Spring Arts Festival on Sat-urday.
About 110,000 people walked along North-
east First Street during the two-day festival to get a taste of Gainesville’s artistic culture.
The vendors at the festival displayed their 
art on racks and in frames outside white tents. 
The art ranged from infrared photos of alliga-
tors to harps made of recycled pianos to hand-painted silk shirts.
Ghiotti, 23-year-old graphic design alum-
nus, brought his brother to the festival to give him an early appreciation of art.
Attempting to disappear behind his tribal 
face paint, Santosh said his favorite part of the festival was seeing the handmade harps.
“Coming to this shows the soul of 
Gainesville,” Ghiotti said.About 200 artists participated in the festi-
val that took place Saturday and Sunday , said Kathryn Lehman, coordinator of cultural pro-grams for Santa Fe College.
She said of the 110,000 people who normal-
ly attend, 85,000 are residents, 20,000 are in-state visitors and 5,000 people are out-of-state visitors.
One of the vendors, Kotah Moon, sold metal 
sculptures of jumping lizards, crouching Bud-dhas and colorful mermaids.
“You need to be 25 percent artist, 75 percent 
gypsy and 100 percent crazy to do this,” she said.
Jake Jacob, 21-year-old UF history junior, 
said he’s gone to the festival for three years to appreciate the art.
“It is great we live in a community where 
you can enjoy something like this on a Satur -
day,” he said. “It gives you a scene of the hid-
den secrets in Gainesville.”

Racers take their marks at the start of the doughnut race in Westwood Middle School’s parking lot at 
about 8:45 a.m. on Saturday. Participants had to eat a dozen doughnuts and run two miles.
ALEXANDRA ANNAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Kate Krause took her place at 
the starting line, gripping a box of 
a dozen doughnuts. The 18-year-
old nursing freshman, clad in a 
penguin suit, jogged alongside 
the other runners, all of them 
wolfing down the glazed treats.
Young Life, a Christian-based 
organization, held a 5K Dough-
nut Dash race Saturday at West-
wood Middle School. The racers ran around the middle school 
while stuffing down Krispy 
Kreme doughnuts. Some wore 
banana suits, tacky dresses and 
other costumes.
About 60 people attended the 
Doughnut Dash, and Young Life 
raised about $1,500.
All of the money raised will 
benefit two summer camps: 
Southwind Young Life Camp in 
Ocklawaha and SharpTop Cove 
Young Life Camp in Jasper, Ga.
Chris James, 38-year-old 
Young Life Gainesville area di-rector, said the point of the race 
was to have fun.
“This one was not a serious race,” James said. “The goal was 
to have a good time, dress up and be a little crazy.”
Josh Acree, 21-year-old psy-
chology junior and Young Life 
member, prepared for the poten-
tial bellyache.
“Eating doughnuts and then 
running — that’s what I was ex-
cited for,” Acree said. “I took the 
whole day off from work just be-
cause I knew I was probably go-
ing to get sick.”
Among all of the participants, 
Perry Sweitzer, 20-year-old po-litical science sophomore, was 
among those who gulped down 
all 12 of the sugary sweets. He said he thought of the kids he was raising money for to get him 
through the home stretch.
“It was surprisingly difficult 
to breathe,” Sweitzer said. “The 
doughnuts stopped tasting good after 11 of them.”Racers eat and run in support of Christian summer camps

UF student Dustin Buckley goes to great lengths to get his 
hands on Box Tops, but they aren’t going toward education.
About six months ago, the 20-year-old computer engineer -
ing junior started selling them on eBay. He has made about 
$300 so far.
Buckley buys Box Tops for Education from Listia.com, an 
auction site that uses credits. He said he will sell an item — usually one that can be emailed, such as a coupon — worth $10 and get 5,000 credits. He will then buy Box Tops for about 2,500 credits.General Mills gives schools 10 cents for each Box Top. Five 
hundred sell on eBay for about $65, instead of the $50 they are 
worth. Buckley thinks people buy them for competitions.
“I assume maybe moms want their chil-
dren to win,” he said.
He also sells event tickets, video games 
and free-after-rebate items.
When he first started selling things at age 
12, he made profits from his own posses-
sions, such as old Nintendo 64 video games.
When Buckley was in high school, he sold 
other students’ goods on eBay in exchange for 10 percent of the profit, said Luc Over -
holt, a 21-year-old biology junior and friend of Buckley’s.
As a UF freshman, Buckley sold Gator football tickets, and last year he started buying items on Craigslist to sell on eBay.
He just started keeping track of his earnings two months 
ago, but he estimated he’s made about $7,000. He made $549 alone from 16 NCAA 2012 Final Four and Elite Eight tickets. His largest profit, about $1,500, came from Adobe software.
Crystal Durham, a 20-year-old computer engineering ju-
nior, said she wished she had the determination to do what her friend does for about 10 hours a week.
Buckley also keeps a closetful of boxes and even prints his 
own postage at home.
Flipping is not illegal, but selling software and free-after-
rebate items are often against companies’ terms of agreement.
Buckley compared it to illegally downloading music.“Everyone does it,” he said.Contact Samantha Shavell at sshavell@alligator.org.Student profits from ‘flipping’ online purchases and credits

A man with a pocketknife threatened UF students on a Lat-
er Gator bus  near Fraternity Row Sunday morning.
James E. Connes, 19, pulled out the knife and yelled at two students at about 1:30 a.m., according to a University Police 
Department report. Connes was arrested on charges of ag-gravated assault with a deadly weapon, improper exhibit of a weapon and tampering with evidence.
Connes pulled his knife on Andrew Sherman and Josh Mar -
bin, according to the report. After Connes pulled out the knife, the bus stopped and those inside ran. Less than a minute later, Marbin and Sherman told officer Brian Ausgood what hap-pened, UPD Maj. Brad Barber said.
Ausgood arrested Connes near the bus. He admitted he used 
the knife and threw it into the woods near Museum Road.
The university sent out text and email alerts at about 1:55 
a.m. Connes was held at the Alachua County Jail on $80,000 
bond.

Capital punishment
debate is still relevant
This week, students and residents of Gainesville will be 
able to have a discussion about capital punishment.
On Wednesday, state Rep. Michelle Rehwinkel Vasil-
inda will be speaking about the death penalty in the lounge at the Catholic Student Center at St. Augustine Church on 1738 
W University Ave.
While the death penalty might not be a huge topic of debate 
this election year, at least on the national level, it is an impor -
tant issue that is often overlooked. This issue deals with a fun-
damental question: life or death?
To be upfront, the event on Wednesday is being hosted 
by Gainesville Citizens for Alternatives to the Death Penalty. Clearly, the views and opinions expressed will be biased to-ward one side of the issue.
However, we would still like to encourage supporters and 
opponents alike to attend the meeting. Perhaps you will hear a side of the story that is often left out of the debate.
To encourage those who are unsure about their stance on 
the issue to attend, here are some facts to keep in mind.
According to the Death Penalty Information Center, 1,290 
people have been put to death by the justice system since 1976.
Capital punishment is legal in 34 states in the U.S., includ-
ing Florida.
As of Jan. 1, there were 3,199 inmates on death row in the 
U.S. At the same time, Florida had 402 inmates on death row. Since 1976, 73 death row inmates have been executed in the state of Florida.
Why do some states still use capital punishment?Some argue that it acts as a deterrent to violent criminals. 
However, when looking at statistics, there doesn’t seem to be any correlation.
Data from the Death Penalty Information Center shows that 
although 80 percent of executions are conducted in the South, it has the highest murder rate of all regions in the country.
Others argue that the death penalty hands justice to the 
most violent criminals among us.
However, this argument assumes that everyone sentenced 
to death is guilty. The DPIC also reported that, since 1973, “140 people in 26 states have been released from death row with evidence of their innocence.”
Florida accounts for 23 of the exonerated inmates — more 
than any other state. Clearly, something within our justice sys-tem isn’t working when 23 innocent people were sentenced to death in our state.
If 140 people have been exonerated since 1973, how many 
innocent people did the state put to death based on faulty evi-dence or poor eyewitness accounts?
While these statistics and data are certainly biased to one 
side of this issue, we encourage everyone, regardless of your 
beliefs, to find out more about capital punishment.
You can do this by attending the event this week or by do-
ing your own research.
We hope you can do both.Employers should not trust Facebook
A few weeks ago, practically everyone in my major 
flipped out when the news story broke that employ-ers were asking applicants for their Facebook login 
information. I expected no less from people who love atten-tion being told their Facebooks will keep them from poten-tially getting more of it.
At first, this news annoyed me, and not because it will 
keep me away from a camera. (I stay as far the heck away from those evil voyeuristic probes as I can already.) I wanted to know why employers would believe information on Face-book is credible. NPR doesn’t, so why should they?
The limited dispersal of your information may have 
context-dependent irony , or it may be sarcastic — neither of which may be immediately apparent to an employer. For instance, I have a photo album of me at my sister’s college graduation entitled, “Pics of me looking sick and sexy-fied.”
If an employer has not heard “We R Who We R,” he or 
she will not understand the humor and will probably judge me as one of those people who loves attention, when instead said employer should be judging me as a very funny — yet impeccably modest — weirdo who might need a Taco Bell intervention.
Another snag: I sometimes use Facebook as a substitute 
for email. I’m certain most everyone — employers and em-ployees alike — would agree that employers should not have access to your mail, particularly of the electronic variety. The chilling effect this would have on free speech would be enor -
mous.
Unfortunately, the current death trap that is Internet juris-
prudence makes it difficult to say with any certainty whether or not businesses have a right to do this, and I’m not willing to pay for the expensive lawsuit required to find out. Filing that lawsuit would put me at the mercy of old, decorated judges who still haven’t switched from their AOL accounts. Likelihood of the odds being ever in my favor: zilch.
So with the legal route as dangerous as an armed Dick 
Cheney, I decided to beat these employers at their own game, exposing them to flaws in their use of Facebook data as a fac-tor in employment.
I made decoy Facebook pro-
files — five of them, in fact.
Each of the decoys has the 
same profile picture, education and resume. Only the political and religious beliefs, as well as the favorite books and movies, have 
been changed.
One Chip Skambis is listed as a conservative Baptist, with 
“God’s will” listed under political views and a psalm in the “about me.” (His favorite book: The Bible.)
Another Chip Skambis has “Anarchist with socialist ten-
dencies” and “Satanist” listed, with “House of the Seven Ga-bles” as his favorite book and “Deep Throat” as his favorite movie.
When and if an employer asks for my Facebook name and 
information, I will simply reply, “Which one?”
If said employer asks me to clarify, I will tell them that 
Facebook, to me, is like a puzzle for my friends to solve, thus why I have multiple profiles, each containing one true piece of information about me. I will then say they are more than welcome to compare my portfolio with the profiles and de-termine which pieces of information are the accurate ones.
The objective here: Remind employers that they do not 
own you. The economic downturn has led a lot of people — including my absolute favorite Alligator columnist — to glorify our bosses as “job creators” by whose hands our economy will be saved.
In turn, these employers have begun to act like they can 
get as much info on their employees as they want in the in-terest of reducing risk. It’s our job to show them why they shouldn’t.

opinions@alligator.org MONDAY, APRIL 16, 2012 § ALLIGATOR, 7
March 28 marked the end of oral arguments at the Supreme 
Court over the constitutionality of the 2010 Affordable Care Act. The lawsuit filed by Texas and 25 other states 
questions the legality of several of the act’s provisions, including the individual mandate — a stipulation that would require most 
Americans to purchase health insurance — and the expansion of 
the Medicaid system. Although deliberation has already begun be-hind closed doors, the court is not expected to release its decisions until this summer.
The case’s outcome holds serious consequences. Though nei-
ther attorneys nor judges mentioned President Barack Obama’s name during the oral arguments, it is tacitly acknowledged that the outcome of November’s presidential election rests in part on the court’s ruling. Obama has built much of his political clout on the 
Affordable Care Act, and the degree to which his ideas are imple-
mented is sure to color his legacy as president.
The court’s decision will also affect college students, who, un-
der the Affordable Care Act, would be allowed to stay on their par -
ents’ insurance plan until age 26. This would allow them to defer worries about health insurance until a few years after college and would free them from the pressure to accept their first job offer out of a need for medical coverage. In addition, the government-spon-sored insurance plans would cover preventive care such as cancer 
screenings and checkups and would not discriminate against those 
with preexisting conditions.
Still, the provision of quality health care for all Americans 
should not come at the expense of our Constitution. The court’s task — and the task that all politically responsible Americans should attempt — is to separate ideology from legality.
First, and almost comically , the court must decide whether to 
honor the Anti-Injunction Act of 1876, a rather obscure rule that blocks lawsuits against a tax before that tax has been paid. If the 
court upholds the act, the lawsuit will be thrown out altogether 
since the tax in question — the penalty for Americans who do not purchase health insurance — will not be levied until 2014. Howev-er, it appears that in this case the justices will ignore or skirt around 
the Anti-Injunction Act.
The court must also address the Afford-
able Care Act’s most contentious tenet, the individual mandate to purchase health in-surance. The act’s defenders claim that the 
mandate falls within the scope of federal 
power under the commerce clause, which gives Congress the pow-
er to regulate interstate trade. Since health insurance interactions frequently cross state boundaries, it seems reasonable to cite health care as an instance of interstate commerce governable under the Constitution. Critics, on the other hand, find the mandate an un-constitutional extension of federal power. Judging by the amount of time the court devoted to arguments over the mandate, there is a real chance that several of the justices — particularly the court’s 
five conservatives — will deem it unconstitutional.
Finally, the states that filed the suit claim the act’s threat that 
states must accept a Medicaid expansion program or lose all of 
their Medicaid funding amounts to coercion.
However, those states have conveniently ignored the fact that 
“the federal government … expanded Medicaid several times in the past 30 years under the same exact terms with no constitutional objections from the states,” an argument the liberal justices made many times, according to Forbes.
This recent conservative anxiety about the alleged aggression of 
the federal government may help explain the vehement opposition to the individual mandate as well.
Considering this precedent, it is unlikely that the court will rule 
against the Medicaid expansion. However, if it finds the individual mandate unconstitutional, the justices must then decide if the act can stand without the mandate. This question of “severability” has met with various responses among the justices, but it is clear that an act aiming to provide universal health care would be crippled 
without the provision that mandates the universal purchase of that 
care.
The justices are sure to reach differing decisions that will be com-
plex and contradictory, but the ultimate fate of the Affordable Care Act has financial and medical implications for all Americans. Now that the health care debate has reached the nation’s highest court, it is time for us all to temporarily shelve ideological arguments in favor of a rational discussion of the act’s constitutionality.
Kayla Oliver is a columnist for the Daily Texan at the University of 
Texas.
Instead of my usual conservative ranting about 
taxes and regulation, I have decided to write my final two columns on what I’ve learned here 
at UF.
While tuition is going up seemingly with no end 
in sight and merit scholarships are being all but eliminated in favor of need-based aid, we still have a tremendous resource at UF that is overlooked by most students: our faculty and staff.
Ever since I was a wide-eyed student at Preview, 
professors and academic advisers have shaped me. I remember I was going to take Honors Physics and Arabic my first semester so I could solve the world’s energy problems. After talking it out for a few minutes with my adviser, I realized that the 
world problem I wanted to solve was not going to 
be fixed by doing basic problem sets and learning how to say hello in another language, so I changed my path to political science.
After taking Macroeconomics with David Den-
slow and getting to speak with him after class, I decided that I had a new passion filled with ques-tions of incentives. The experiences I gained from helping students as a TA and doing research for 
Denslow nurtured the love for economics that I 
have today.
Because I walked up and spoke with my pro-
fessor while others were going to the next class, I 
gained a valuable mentor.
I felt at that point in my sophomore year that 
graduate school was in my future. I worked hard 
to take the right math classes to get into the top schools. Unfortunately, I was not exceptionally tal-
ented in higher-level math and had to make up for 
it by going to countless office hours.
Still, I was not deterred because I had a goal that 
I had to achieve. As I got more involved with re-search, I was fortunate enough to work with Larry Kenny, who helped me combine interests in politi-cal science and economics to ask questions about 
voter power and legislative behavior.
Even though all the signs pointed me toward an 
academic career, as a junior I experienced major failure for the first time in my life. I took a section 
of Advanced Calculus I, which showed me how little interest I had in the high-level math required of a graduate student.Many thought the class 
was unfairly graded (an equivalent section had a 
20-percent cutoff for a C 
while mine had a 65 per -
cent cutoff), and I with-drew from the class along with more than a dozen other students from a start-
ing group of 20-plus.
My identity as a hardworking person was shat-
tered because I had messed up despite trying my best. I went back to my advisers and professors with whom I had developed relationships, and they kept me sane and made me aware that I had to 
figure out what the meaning of my failure meant.
I am convinced that while some failures are 
meant to be overcome, others are best used for re-
direction.
I became more involved with the statistics un-
dergraduate program at UF and had the good for -
tune to meet Ron Randles, who taught one of my junior-year classes. His passion for teaching con-vinced me to major in statistics.
As I was lost in the academic wilderness, I went 
to the library to see if I could find anything that would help me discern my direction in life. Due to my modest technical background in economics and 
statistics that I had gained from my professors, I 
was able to appreciate the books about investing I stumbled upon.
These books led me to get professional licenses 
and hunt for jobs in my newly discovered passion. 
Without mentors and advisers such as Regan Gar -
ner, Kevin Knudson, Sheila Dickison, Ron Randles, 
Dave Denslow, Larry Kenny, Paul D’Anieri and 
countless others, I might have settled for less than 
going for my dream and not letting failure get in my way.
Get to know your professors. Do research with 
them, work for their classes and go to office hours. The relationships you develop will sustain you and carry you to success beyond your wildest imagina-
tion.

By 11:30 p.m. on Friday , people 
wearing only their undies and run-
ning shoes littered University Av-enue, drifting between bars but not gaining entry.
The 14th Great Underwear Dash 
tore across campus Friday night, leaving a pile of clothes that filled 30 trash bags on Turlington Plaza.
The turnout was skimpy this 
year, said 21-year-old physics junior Josh Kelley, who organized the run. Usually , dashers donate 50 or 60 
bags worth of clothing, all of which 
is driven to St. Francis House imme-diately after the run.
About 970 people RSVP’d to the 
event on Facebook, but Kelley esti-mated the actual turnout at only a couple hundred. In the past, up to 2,500 people clicked “attending.”  
“Maybe this particular semester 
was busy for everyone,” Kelley said. “It’s pretty disappointing.”
Kelley also started the run at 11 
p.m. on Friday , instead of midnight, as in past years.The most creative costumes in-
cluded two hula dancers, two giant  mouse-like headdresses and three men wearing red, white and blue bikini-style briefs, Kelley said.
Jacob Barrow, an 18-year-old 
University of Central Florida fresh-man, sported red briefs in the trio. He was invited to the run by his friends, UF freshmen Eric Zecman, 
19, and Brian DePaola, 18.

Every time Ashley Meral 
went to get food out of her 
fridge this week, there was a 
bagel staring at her.
During a typical week, 
the 20-year-old accounting 
junior would have gladly in-
dulged, but her craving was 
curbed by Passover, the Jew-ish holiday celebrated April 6 through last Saturday.
Meral was one of about 
50 UF students who feasted on pasta, pizza and cake Sat-urday night at Hillel to cel-ebrate the end of Passover.
This variety of carbs and 
leavened foods, or “cha-metz” in Hebrew, are forbid-den during the holiday. 
They’re replaced by mat-
zo, the traditional Jewish un-leavened bread.“All I want to do is eat 
bread, and this matzo tastes like cardboard,” Meral said. 
“I’m so tired of just eating 
matzo and nothing but mat-zo. I’ve tried to substitute out meals with fruit and stuff like that, but I always end up 
eating the matzo.”
Laura Kaler, a 19-year-
old accounting freshman, 
couldn’t wait to eat a cookie.
“I have a sweet tooth,” 
she said, “and I haven’t re-ally had any dessert for a 
week.”
Meral said it’s important 
for her to keep Passover be-cause it is one of the com-
mandments in the Torah.
“It’s something I’ve al-
ways done,” she said, “but it’s not something that I’ve 
always, by the end, wanted 
to do.”Students celebrate 
end of Passover by 
loading up on carbs
“All I want to do is eat 
bread, and this matzo 
tastes like cardboard.”

  Sophomore Hannah Rogers throws during Sunday’s 4-1 victory over Auburn. Rogers picked up her 18th 
and 19th complete games of the season while giving up four earned runs this weekend. 
� GATORS WON 5-2 SUNDAY.
  JOE MORGAN
 Alligator Staff Writer
   
 The Gators started slow at 
the plate this weekend, but their 
pitching was good from start to 
ﬁ  nish.
  Florida (38-5, 18-2 Southeast-
ern Conference) rode strong per-
formances in the circle by Hannah 
Rogers and Lauren Haeger to a 
weekend series sweep of Auburn (26-18, 5-14 SEC), culminating in a 5-2 win on Sunday.
  “They’ve done a good job and 
they’ve really (been) doing a good job with keeping us in the ball game and allowing us the opportunity to win ball games,” 
coach Tim Walton said.
  Rogers (22-3) tossed her 18th 
and 19th complete games of the 
season Friday and Sunday, giv-ing up just four earned runs in 
14 innings of work against the 
Tigers. 
The sophomore hurler yielded two-spots in the fourth inning Friday and in the seventh Sun-day, but allowed just ﬁ  ve hits 
otherwise.
  “[Walton] tells us to just stay 
tough as long as we can keep the 
other team to a minimum of runs, then our team will come out con-
ﬁ  dent and scoring,” Rogers said. 
“If we’re keeping down the runs, it keeps them hitting and keeps them conﬁ  dent.”
  While Rogers logged the most 
work, it was Haeger who nearly was the story of the weekend. 
The freshman pitcher, who 
tossed her seventh complete 
game of the season in the series 
clincher, made it through 6.1 in-nings without yielding a hit in Saturday’s 3-1 win.
  However, she lost her no-hit 
bid and the shutout when Au-burn’s Caitlin Jordan sent a Hae-ger offering over the center-ﬁ  eld wall with one out in the top of the 
seventh.
  “I was trying not to think  Rogers throws complete game, helps Florida sweep Auburn 
  Something is still amiss with 
Karsten Whitson.
  The former ﬁ  rst-round MLB 
Draft selection, who was sidelined for more than a month with an injury that was only described as “arm fatigue,” hasn’t been himself this season, even 
when healthy.
  His numbers are down across the 
board. He has tossed just 10.2 frames 
in ﬁ  ve outings, including just three Sat-urday. Whitson’s ERA (5.91) has more 
than doubled from his freshman season 
(2.40), and most noticeably, the pitcher who made a living ringing batters up a year ago hasn’t been doing it this year. 
In the short time we have seen Whit-
son on the rubber, the once-dominant righty has struggled with locating his pitches, and batters have taken advan-tage of it.
  Whitson’s season has perfectly en-
capsulated Florida’s own issues this year. While there are plenty of factors that have played into the Gators’ strug-gles — errors in the ﬁ  eld, fail-ing to execute 
with men on 
base — starting pitching has been the most 
shocking.
  Florida is actually on pace to commit 
fewer errors than a year ago, and we all 
knew coming into the season that the Gators had issues with situational hit-
ting and manufacturing runs last year. 
But what no one expected was for UF’s starting pitching to take a step back af-ter a stellar 2011 campaign.
  With all three weekend starters re-
turning — and all three projected as ﬁ  rst- or second-round selections when they’re draft eligible — the pitching rotation was supposed to be one of 
Florida’s biggest strengths.
  Somehow, that hasn’t been the 
case. Unexpected cause for 
UF’s unexpected strugglesBASEBALL
  BRYAN HOLT
 Alligator Writer
   
 During its recent slump, Florida has 
struggled with starting pitching and strand-
ing runners. On Sunday, junior Brian John-
son made sure both problems were taken 
care of. 
  Stepping to the plate with bases loaded 
and one out in the top of the ﬁ  rst, Johnson 
lined a bases-clearing double to right. Then 
he maintained control of the game with his left arm. 
  “We jumped out 4-0, and he threw strikes, 
he commanded the strike zone,”  coach Kev-
in O’Sullivan said. “I really, really liked his 
demeanor today.”
  For the ﬁ  rst time in three weeks, No. 7 
Florida (28-8, 9-6 Southeastern Conference) won an SEC weekend series by defeating Tennessee (21-15, 7-8 SEC) 8-1 at Lindsey Nelson Stadium. Sunday was an opportu-nity for the Gators to snap a number of poor 
stretches. 
  Catcher Mike Zunino entered the day 
batting .185 in his career against Tennes-
see but was able to get on base twice and score in the game’s ﬁ  rst three innings. Vick-ash Ramjit had just one hit in his last 17 at bats before his second-inning home run, 
and Daniel Pigott’s only hit of the series had 
been an inﬁ  eld single before he opened the fourth with a double. 
  Even third baseman Cody Dent broke a 
streak, notching his ﬁ  rst RBI hit of the year with a run-scoring single in the fourth. 
  The Gators surged ahead early in Knox-
ville. After Johnson’s double, freshman left ﬁ  elder Justin Shafer hit a sac ﬂ  y to left to give Florida a 4-0 lead in the ﬁ  rst. The Gators then tacked on at least one run in each of the 
next three innings, getting the leadoff man 
on in every frame until the ﬁ  fth. 
  “[Sunday] was about as complete of 
a game as we have played in a while,” O’Sullivan said. “We played really well 
[Sunday].” Johnson lifts Gators with arm,

Florida starting pitcher Brian Johnson throws against LSU on April 5. Johnson started Sunday’s 
game, throwing six scoreless innings while also driving in three runs at the plate. UF won 8-1. 
Gators earn seventh straight series 
win despite lack of run production
about it because I didn’t want 
to jinx myself, but I felt good,” Haeger said. “It felt good go-
ing into the seventh inning 
not having any hits, but hey, sometimes it just doesn’t go your way.”
Haeger (11-2) was able to 
return the favor to the Tigers on Sunday, breaking up a no-hitter by Auburn’s Angel Bun-ner with a single in the fourth. 
Haeger broke the game 
open the next inning with a two-run shot to make the score 4-0.
The Gators scored enough 
to salvage the stout pitching efforts from Rogers and Hae-ger, but it took some time for their bats to wake up. Florida 
scored only two runs before 
the fifth inning during the weekend.
UF had its best results tag-
ging Auburn’s starters as they became fatigued, chasing each Tigers starter before they could complete their final in-ning of work. 
Florida pushed a combined 
six runs across the plate in 
frames with Auburn pitching 
changes.
“They really pitched well 
and for us to be able to — third time through the lineup — to figure it out better,” Walton 
said. 
“That’s the name of the 
game — being able to take 
advantage of opportunities, being able to take advantage 
of mistakes, being able to take 
advantage of pitchers throw-ing pitches over the plate.”
The Gators scored 11 runs 
against the Tigers during the weekend series, plating five in Sunday’s contest. 
The run total is the low-
est series mark for UF since a 
six-run effort in three games 
against Tennessee on March 9-11. 
Despite some early strug-
gles at the plate, Florida still 
came away with its seventh 
consecutive series win — and fifth sweep — of a conference foe this season.
With Kentucky, No. 22 LSU 
and No. 2 Alabama remaining on the conference schedule, UF has still has a tough road ahead to its fourth SEC regu-
lar-season title.
“It’s going to be tough,” 
Walton said. 
“We’re going to be facing 
some great pitching. Probably 
not going to be getting as many hits as we’ve been accustomed to getting.”

tin contributed to this report.

The Gators’ weekend rotation 
of Whitson, Brian Johnson and 
Hudson Randall had a combined 
2.63 ERA in 301.1 innings of work 
last season. So far this year, those three have a collective 3.96 ERA in 102.1 frames.
When you factor in sophomore 
Jonathon Crawford, who tossed just 3.2 innings as a freshman but has been thrust into a much larger role this year due to Whitson’s, 
and now Randall’s, injuries, the ro-
tation’s ERA is 3.98.
Although Johnson has been 
the most consistent, his individu-al ERA is still up, as are those of 
Whitson and Randall. Meanwhile, 
the trio isn’t going as deep into games as it did a year ago, and all three have dealt with injuries to some extent.
In 2011, Whitson averaged just 
more than five innings per start, 
Randall went six and a half per 
outing and Johnson lasted just about five frames each time out. Those numbers have dropped to just more than two innings for 
Whitson, just more than six for 
Randall and just less than five for Johnson. 
With innings down and ERA up, it’s no wonder the Gators have had to mount come-from-behind victories in 16 of their 28 wins this 
season.
Florida is still going to make it 
to Omaha, Neb., this summer, but 
unless the rotation starts turning in vintage performances like John-
son did with six scoreless innings 
Sunday, the Gators’ chances won’t look so good. In college baseball, the teams that go the distance have a dominant starter (See: Cooper, Blake in 2010 and Roth, Michael in 2011). Given the draft prospects 
of Whitson, Randall and Johnson, 
Florida should have three of those to rely on. 
But as Whitson’s condensed 
season illustrates best, something 
is off with the Gators’ starting ro-
tation.

With win, Florida now 
second alone in SEC East
Right-handed sophomore Nick 
Williams got the start for Tennessee. 
In his only outing against Florida as 
a freshman, Williams gave up five 
runs on four hits in one inning. Sun-day wasn’t any better.
Struggling to locate his mid-90s 
fastball, Williams was pulled after 1.1 innings, four hits and five runs. He hit Zunino in the first and walked Nolan Fontana before leaving in the second.
After disappointing outings in his 
last three starts, Johnson was crisp. He struck out four of the 24 batters he faced. He allowed one hit in each 
inning he pitched but stranded six  
Volunteers. 
It took a combination of five 
UF relievers to close the game, as O’Sullivan was quick to pull arms in 
search of the Gators’ third shutout of 
the season. But the effort was blown in the ninth when Keenan Kish hit the leadoff man before allowing a two-out Will Maddox RBI single.
Following a quick start, Florida’s 
offense was quiet after the fourth, scoring no runs and recording just 
two hits in the game’s final five 
frames. 
“We would have loved to tack on 
some more runs there,” O’Sullivan said. “Like yesterday we scored some runs and then we let some in-
nings slip away from us.”
Florida and Tennessee split the 
first two games of the series. The Gators got a strong start out of soph-
omore Jonathon Crawford Friday night en route to a 3-1 win before falling 5-4 on Saturday when Ramjit grounded into a double play with the bases loaded and one out in the 
ninth. 
The win gave Florida sole posses-
sion of second place in the SEC East 
behind Kentucky, which took two of 
three from Arkansas this weekend 
and is now 11-4 in conference play.

The Gators are on a collision 
course with the nation’s top team.
They gave themselves reason for 
optimism with their performance 
Saturday as that crash approaches.
No. 5 Florida (14-2 4-0 American 
Lacrosse Conference) took control early and didn’t look back as it won its 10th straight game, defeating No. 17 Vanderbilt (7-6, 1-4 ALC), 17-5, at Donald R. Dizney Stadium.
It was the second win for UF by 
more than 10 goals against a ranked opponent this season, as it routed 
then 10th-ranked Dartmouth 20-4 
in Gainesville on March 20.
The complete performance was 
just what coach Amanda O’Leary wanted to see from her team in its last game before it travels to Evan-ston, Ill., to face top-ranked, unde-feated Northwestern on Saturday.
“Offensively , I thought they ran 
through their plays,” O’Leary said. “I think Vanderbilt is a really good defensive team, and offensively we did a nice job of containing them.”
After Commodores attacker Car -
ly Linthicum scored to tie the game at the 26:31 mark of the first half, the Gators dominated possession and finished the half on an 8-0 run.
Florida won eight of the 11 first-
half draw controls and Vanderbilt midfielder Ally Carey , who entered the week leading the conference with five draw controls per game, was held to just one in the opening 30 minutes.
“Shannon (Gilroy) did a really 
nice job (taking the draw),” O’Leary said. “Ally Carey is one of the best draw specialists in the country , if not the best, and I thought Shannon certainly held her own.”
The Gators benefitted from early 
hat tricks from both Gilroy and ju-nior attacker Kitty Cullen, who gave the Gators the lead two and a half minutes into the game when she scored unassisted. 
After Linthicum’s goal tied the 
game less than a minute later, Gil-roy put the Gators up for good 33 seconds later on a free-position 
shot.
Cullen scored another unas-
sisted goal at 25:13 to give UF a 3-1 
lead, and junior midfielder Brittany Dashiell followed that up by assist-ing on two consecutive Gilroy goals. 
Cullen then scored to put Florida 
up 6-1, completing a hat trick of her own.
Dashiell then tied a UF record as 
she brought her assist total to four, dishing off to junior attacker Caro-line Chesterman on two more unan-swered scores.
Chesterman’s second goal at the 
6:57 mark of the first half put Florida 
ahead 8-1. In 2011, the Gators scored 
just eight goals in the entire game as they defeated the Commodores 8-7 in Nashville.
Cullen, who finished with a 
game-high five goals, said the win will give the Gators a great deal of momentum as they prepare for their showdown with the Wildcats 
to end the regular season.
“Everybody is going to be so 
pumped,” Cullen said. “Every-
day at practice we are going to be coming out so hard. We have to be ready for this game. They are going to come out physical and it’s going to be a competition.”� FLORIDA WON REGULAR-SEASON TITLE AFTER 
FINISHING UNDEFEATED IN CONFERENCE PLAY.

When looking at the history of women’s tennis in the South-
eastern Conference, there is one very clear truth that sticks out 
— the Gators have a monopoly on the sport. 
Dating back to 1980, the first year of women’s tennis in the 
conference, the Gators have won 26 of a possible 33 regular sea-son championships. They have had 21 undefeated seasons in the conference, including the past three years. 
With Saturday’s victory over South Carolina, Florida (18-1, 
11-0 SEC) wrapped up another regular season title and primed itself for another deep postseason run. On the surface, this year’s team is very similar to last year’s. The rosters are almost 
identical, as are the doubles pairings. Both teams lost regular-
season matches against Stanford, and both dominated every other opponent. 
But if you ask coach Roland Thornqvist, much has changed 
since last April.
“I think we’re playing, from a forehand and backhand 
standpoint, much better,” he said. “We’re a much better ball-striking team in some spots. But the biggest improvement is maturity.”
In 2011, the Gators had three freshmen on their roster —  
Sofie Oyen, Olivia Janowicz and Alex Cercone. Now sopho-mores, those three players have coupled with junior Caroline Hitimana to play the fourth, fifth, and sixth singles spots. Thornqvist said that those players have become much more consistent this season, which has allowed him to give some players days off without sacrificing production.
“Last year, we were still sort of searching with three fresh-
men,” he said. “They were much more up-and-down than they 
are this year. That’s a great improvement to have more stability 
in your performance day in and day out. Our lineup has been interchangeable for a long time.”
Last May, Florida played on four consecutive days at Stan-
ford en route to the national championship. That makes it even more vital for the Gators to effectively utilize their depth.
“If we’re in the postseason and we play consecutive days 
and we have someone who’s worn out the next day, we have somebody fresh coming in,” Thornqvist said.
“We have seven players that can all get the job done. I think 
it’s very important that we play all seven, because we’re going to need all seven. I think that’s a huge weapon that we haven’t utilized as much in the past, but we’re certainly going to take 
advantage of that this year.“
UF plays either Tennessee or Auburn in the second round 
of the SEC Tournament on Friday. The Gators received a first-
round bye, giving them an extra day to prepare for what could be three straight days of matches. They faced the same situa-tion last year, winning the tournament. MONDAY, APRIL 16, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 15

THE RALLY
  JOHN: In a span of ﬁ  ve days last week, the 
Gators lost their most experienced assis-tant coach and the entire 2011 recruiting 
class to the lure of more familiar pastures and greener wallets.
  While there was little lamenting when 
Norm Roberts left to coach at Kansas or after freshman Walter Pitchford transferred, the announcement that Brad Beal will enter the NBA Draft must have appeared to Florida fans like a premature coup de grâce to next year’s team.
  Beal was hands-down the Gators’ best 
player in March, but one look at the predict-
ed 2012-2013 roster creates a fair argument 
that any hand-wringing  over his departure should be short-lived.
  Billy Donovan’s attempt to get to the Final 
Four from the 3-point line fell short, and, once again, Florida is seemingly stacked at guard while still desperately thin up front heading into the offseason.
  With the recruiting window still open and 
ﬁ  ve-star forward Anthony Bennett in play for Florida, Beal’s exit gives UF the opportunity to create offensive balance next year and be-come a better team. 
    GREG: Don’t let Beal’s magniﬁ  cent 3-point 
stroke fool you, Boothe. Of the six Gators who attempted at least 150 shots last season, only Beal and Patric Young took more from inside 
the arc than out.
  Beal was also Florida’s best threat to drive 
to the basket, leading the team in free throw 
attempts.
  He played more minutes per game than 
any player since Eddie Shannon in the 1997-1998 season, ﬁ  lling the box score in a way no single player can replace. If the Gators were going to win it all, last year was the best shot 
they’ll get in some time. 
  As John Calipari and Kentucky proved, 
talent wins in March. 
  Beal could go down as the most talented 
player to ever put on a Florida uniform, and 
now he’s leaving Gainesville without a title.
    JOHN: The only reason Beal began to at-
tack the rim with such enthusiasm this sea-
son was because he fell below expectations as 
an outside shooter.
  His 33.9 shooting percentage behind the 
arc — I think we can agree — was only going to improve the longer he stayed at Florida.  There’s no way he would have ﬁ  nished an-other year with the lowest 3-point shooting percentage of any UF player with at least 100 attempts. 
  Beal is des-
tined to be a shooting guard at the next level 
— maybe a domi-
nant one. 
  But that’s not 
what UF needs next season. 
  While Beal 
ﬁ  lled in admirably as a primary rebound-er when injuries piled up and unselﬁ  shly played out of position nearly the entire year, 
his presence created the false illusion that the 
Gators could win a championship with four guards on the court.
  It’s no stretch to say Florida was a bad de-
fensive team for the majority of last season. The Gators owned the ninth-best defensive ﬁ  eld-goal percentage in the Southeastern Conference and blocked a league low 124 shots.
  As Kentucky — which led the SEC in both 
categories — learned this season, big men win in March.
    GREG: For a man 
making an impossible argument, you’ve made a few good points. 
  It’s been proven that 
a guard-heavy, 3-happy team can’t get it done in the Tournament. Sel-dom does that type of team reach the Final 
Four, and the failures of Duke, Missouri and 
Florida in 2012 only reafﬁ  rmed that. 
  But if Beal at small forward was the down-
fall of this unit, the solution is pretty simple: 
Play him at two guard!
  Can you imagine a unit with Patric Young 
and Anthony Bennett, plus Casey Prather or 
Will Yeguete at small forward and Kenny Boynton running point? That team would be huge, talented and probably the preseason No. 1. 
  While defense was Florida’s downfall, 
Beal was the team’s best defender outside of 
Will Yeguete. Moving him to his natural po-
sition would’ve helped his NBA stock even further, and it would’ve put Florida in a great position to win it all.   But Billy Donovan couldn’t make that 
promise because UF didn’t have the front court players to make it work, and still might not if it doesn’t land Bennett. That’s why Beal was such a critical piece: He was everything 
Florida needed him to be. 
  
  JOHN:     With three upperclassmen front-
court players in Young, Yeguete and Murphy returning along with the possible addition of Bennett, Florida has a chance to resemble the 2010 Elite Eight team that was led primarily by its bigs. 
  Don’t forget that — even with Beal’s ex-
cellence — last season was largely deemed a letdown until the Gators were blessed with a third-round gift in the form of No. 15-seed Norfolk State.
  Looking back through Donovan’s coach-
ing career, some of his best teams and coach-ing jobs have occurred when frontcourt play-ers like Joakim Noah, Al Horford and Vernon Macklin were more involved in the offense. 
  Playing considerably less talent at guard, 
the 2010-11 squad featuring Macklin, Alex Tyus and Chandler Parsons won the SEC reg-ular season title and was far more consistent before earning its bid to the NCAA tourney. 
  With Beal back, Donovan would be too 
enticed to not play mad scientist again with his 3-point heavy offense. 
  
  GREG: Donovan will coach to what his 
team does best. Last year, that was shooting 
the three. 
  If the roster construction dictated that UF  
pound it inside, the team would do that. But, if like in 2011-12, the roster was built to shoot the three, that’s what the Gators would do. 
  What’s great about Beal is that he can ﬁ  t 
into either scheme. He’s a versatile player 
who can drive when they need him to drive, 
shoot when they need him to shoot and de-fend and grab rebounds in between. 
  Regardless of what type of offense Florida 
ultimately decided to run, Beal would’ve been a great ﬁ  t. 
  He’s smart enough to pick up whatever 
the Gators do, and the talent that makes him a Top-5 pick would ﬁ  t into any system. 
  Only now, Florida has to try to implement 
whatever they decide to do without him. And that makes a third consecutive run to the Elite Eight considerably less likely.
