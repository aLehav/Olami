There will be a surcharge starting 
Monday for those who choose to purchase 
Krishna Lunch using their credit cards.
Since the lunchtime favorite started 
allowing credit cards instead of cash, the number of credit card users has been increasing, said Caitanya Long, vice 
president at Krishna House.Because Krishna gets charged to use 
Square, the app they scan credit cards 
with, they’ve decided to put the charge on students because it’s still more convenient than having to go to an ATM, she said.
Long added that the charge will only be 
15 cents for a $5 meal and 50 cents for $20. 
She said the amount is insigniﬁ  cant 
compared to what ATMs charge, and she has been warning students about the change and has received no complaints.
“We provide savings for students, help them get a healthy, nutritious meal with 
the convenience of using a card,” she 
said.
Some students, like Alexandra 
Silverberg, a 20-year-old ﬁ  nance junior, 
are still frustrated with the price increase.
“When my brother was a student at 
UF about four years ago, the lunches 
were basically free, but they accepted donations,” she said.Krishna Lunch to charge customers using credit cards

Wells Fargo, the ofﬁ  cial banking partner of UF, was re-
cently listed as the most-complained-about bank in Flori-
da.
Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase ranked second 
and third respectively, according to a report released by 
Florida PIRG Education on Tuesday. The ﬁ  ndings were 
based on data the organization collected since early last year.
The report compared banks by total number of com-
plaints and by the ratio of complaints per billion dollars of deposits.
Some UF students who use Wells Fargo said they un-
derstand why the bank topped the list and have their share of complaints.
Deanna Shahnami, a 21-year-old UF journalism senior, 
said in her experience with Wells Fargo, she has been less than satisﬁ  ed but understands why UF uses it as its bank-ing partner.
“UF might partner with it because it’s a national bank, 
so it’s convenient for a student to use it in and out of state,” she said.
Jimmy Taylor, a 21-year-old UF materials science and 
engineering senior, agreed that Wells Fargo has been prob-Patrons of Wells

Three 5.0 scores, a 4.3 and a chili 
pepper all add up to seven in this 
equation.
RateMyProfessors.com, a web-
site allowing students to score and 
review professors across the nation, released its annual top 25 professor 
rankings Tuesday. Bridget Middle-ton, a Santa Fe College professor, was listed as No. 7.
“Most students go online to com-
plain about their teachers,” Middle-ton said. “I’m really honored that 
my students think this highly of me 
to go make positive comments.”
Middleton is an academic foun-
dations professor teaching develop-mental mathematics at SFC. She has been a professor for 15 years and started teaching at SFC in 2001.
“Her students come into my of-
ﬁ  ce and say glowing things about her,” said Kathleen Arnold, SFC mathematics department chair.
Middleton said she loves teach-
ing at SFC because it is a school that values its students. It makes sure their needs are always put ﬁ  rst, she said.
RateMyProfessors.com allows students to score their professors, schools and classes based on a few set criteria. Each year, these points are totaled and tallied to make a list of the top 25 rated professors to be released on its webpage.
Middleton was given a 5.0 for 
helpfulness, clarity and overall qual-ity, a 4.3 for easiness and even a chili pepper for hotness, which is a non-academic rating the website uses to scale a professor’s physical attrac-tiveness.
Students on RateMyProfessors.
com have described her as “the best teacher I’ve ever had,” “very aware of her students” and “highly recom-mended.”

The Reitz Union Grand Ballroom today will 
thunder from creative minds brainstorming over 
the future of engineering and innovation.
The second ﬂ  oor of the Reitz will be home to 
the UF Engineering Innovation Institute’s bien-
nial Engineering Innovation Summit. 
The summit is free and open to the public. It 
will span today from 1:15 to 4:30 p.m. and Friday 
from 9 a.m. to noon. It will feature a panel discus-
sion with successful innovators from across the 
country.
This year’s theme is “Transforming Engineer-
ing Education & Research to Unleash the Creative 
Spirit.”
“Part of what we are trying to do here is really 
bring thought leaders together to talk about that 
next generation of engineer,” said Director of the 
Engineering Innovation Institute Erik Sander.
When Sander was an engineering student at 
UF, the industry demanded technical depth and 
the ability to analyze problems. 
The requirements for the next generation of en-
gineers is much different, he said.
“If you look at where innovation and entrepre-
neurship is going, it’s about teamwork,” Sander said. “That team of the future works interdisciplin-
ary. So, we welcome students of all disciplines.”
Director of marketing and communications for 
the College of Engineering Helen Goh said this 
summit is a way to look at engineering education 
in a different light.
“We really want to make an impact in engineer-
ing education to the extent to where students are 
able to think out of the box and combine creativ-
ity, innovation and entrepreneurship,” she said.
Jaclyn Fine, a 20-year-old UF mechanical and aerospace engineering junior, said the summit en-
courages creativity and innovation using creativ-ity.
“It’s good for freshmen and sophomores to go 
because it shows them what they can do when they get to industry,” Fine said.
Sander said he wished he had chances to learn 
about the big picture at events like this.
“This is an opportunity for students to hear 
from the best in the world,” he said.Engineer summit to transform Reitz

The survey drew no national conclusions
lematic, but the on-campus loca-
tion has always provided excellent service.
“The general customer service is 
lacking at Wells Fargo as a whole, 
but at least the on-campus branch 
really seems to care about the stu-dents,” Taylor said.
William Rossi, a Wells Fargo 
faculty fellow and senior lecturer at UF, said it is important to remem-ber the report doesn’t speculate on Wells Fargo nationally, and cus-tomer service in a particular region could be the issue the bank made the top of the list.
“I really think if you look at 
Wells Fargo nationally, they tend to have a pretty good reputation,” he said. “I think it has a lot to do with customer service, and that’s more of a location-speciﬁ  c issue than a national one.”
Additionally, acquiring regional 
banks in Florida could account for poor customer service, said Rossi.
“In reality, when it acquires an 
old bank, it can acquire its custom-er service trends,” he said.
Rachel Priester, a 22-year-old 
UF mechanical engineering senior, 
said perhaps the bank has the most 
complaints because it has the most customers.
“To me, that information is only 
valuable if you have a ratio of un-happy customers to total custom-ers.”BANK , from page 1� THE BAND WILL BE

Members of UF Golden Key can say all 
their hard work has paid off.
The UF chapter was one of 28 recipients 
of the 2013 Key Chapter Award presented 
to Key chapters of college and universities 
internationally.
“As a high-functioning chapter, the 
recognition is very exciting since these are 
students who represent a great example of balancing academics and service to the community,” said Chris Loschiavo, a UF Golden Key chapter adviser.
The UF group had to achieve a gold 
chapter status by fulﬁ  lling activity and 
service requirements such as volunteering 
at service events including March for Babies, Relay for Life, local street cleanups and the Rock for the Hungry beneﬁ  t concert.
Olivia Glotfelty, a 20-year-old UF 
anthropology junior, said UF’s chapter received the award because of the members’ participation and involvement in various service and social events throughout the 
year.
“I feel we are set apart from other chapters 
because we like to give back to the community 
while also having fun getting to know one another through our socials,” said Glotfelty. “We’re a diverse group, so it’s a great way to bond and make connections.”
To join, qualiﬁ  ed students of any major 
must be recommended by advisers via 
email. 
Students must maintain a 3.75 GPA in 
order to be invited to the chapter.
Jordan Turetsky, a 19-year-old UF biology 
sophomore, said his involvement with Golden 
Key has been a positive experience so far.
“Golden Key was one of the ﬁ  rst major 
organizations that I was involved in, and it has helped me develop leadership skills 
while giving back to the community through 
our dedicated chapter,” he said.UF Golden Key

The Florida real estate market is on the 
rise, but locals are experiencing a spike in 
interest rates — which means higher rent.
The Bergstrom Center for Real Estate 
Studies in UF’s Warrington College of 
Business Administration conducted a sur-
vey that showed investment outlook in the real estate market declined for the ﬁ  rst time in two years. Interest rates went up 0.66 percent between the beginning and end of this year’s second quarter.
The results apply to apartments, com-
mercial rental property, single-family houses, condominium development and 
developable land.
Timothy Becker, the center’s director, said interest rates went up another 64 ba-
sis points within the past 30 days, which translates into about a 1.3 percent increase in interest rates. If that trend continues, 
Becker said, people will start worrying 
about investing in the real estate market.
He said rising interest rates could lead 
to higher rent prices, which could narrow down the places students can afford.
“If I were wanting to invest in student 
apartments right now, and I was coming to Gainesville and looking at buildings, interest rates are 1.3 percent higher than 
they were three months ago, and so that 
has an impact on how much I can afford to pay,” he said.
Cheryl Hartley, a Realtor with Pruden-
tial Trend Realty, said UF undergradu-ates tend to lean toward apartments and condos, while the graduate students seek houses in residential areas.
She noted she has already seen reac-
tions among her clients to the rise in inter-
est rates.
“What they felt they could afford 
six months ago, they may not be able to 
(now),” she said.
Fortunately, according to a section in 
the survey that references information from Visit Florida, state tourism increased by 2.6 percent in the second quarter.
This rise in tourism could have a posi-
tive effect in investment in the land devel-opment sector of the real estate market.
Becker said it is unknown when the rise 
in interest rates will end, but, as a whole, the real estate market is improving despite the rise in interest rates.Increasing interest rates could raise rentSTATEReader response

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgWednesday’s question: Do you jaywalk?Today’s question: Have you ever given a teacher a hot 
chili pepper on Rate My Professor? Wages, job opportunities remain stagnant
Don’t let the diminishing unemployment rate fool 
you. An economic crisis still looms in this coun-try — the same one we were supposed to be out 
of years ago.
The richest 10 percent of Americans took more than 
half of the country’s income in 2012, according to a New York Times study. That’s the largest share since the gov-
ernment began keeping records. In fact, about 20 percent 
of the nation’s income was concentrated in the top 1 per-cent of earners.
As long as this continues, unemployment will remain 
rampant and wages stagnant. Because high levels of 
unemployment have lasted so long, businesses have no 
incentives to improve workers’ salaries, and companies know workers will take what they can get in this kind of environment. According to the same study, income for 
the lower 99 percent of workers has risen only 1 percent 
in 2012, while the richest 0.01 percent — yes, one-hun-dredth of one percent — enjoyed more than a 32 percent raise. In fact, the richest 400 Americans are worth more than $2 trillion, which is about the same as Russia’s gross 
domestic product.
While wages have stagnated for an overwhelming ma-
jority of Americans, so have employment opportunities.
The unemployment rate for the poorest families — 
earning less than $20,000 a year — is as high as it was 
during the Great Depression at 21 percent, according to the Associated Press. Meanwhile, households earning $150,000 or more are enjoying an extremely low unem-ployment rate of 3.2 percent.
“This was no ‘equal opportunity’ recession or an 
‘equal opportunity’ recovery,” Andrew Sum, director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern Uni-versity, told the Associated Press. “One part of America 
is in depression, while another part is in full employ-
ment.”
This news comes on the heels of strikes from Walmart and fast-food workers, demand-ing a living wage.
Think about it: If we just raise 
the wages of low-paid workers, then there’s more money in-jected into the economy through their spending. Less people 
would have to work multiple 
jobs to make ends meet, thus 
opening more positions for those most affected by un-employment.
But raising the minimum wage hurts business and 
causes prices to skyrocket, right?
Not exactly.A study from April 2011 by the University of Califor-
nia, Berkeley found that if Walmart paid its workers $12 
an hour, the average shopper would only spend an extra 
46 cents per trip. That’s nearly double the federal mini-mum wage and would only cost the consumer an extra $12.49 per year. And again, that’s only if the new costs were completely absorbed by consumers.
Other companies manage to pay better than mini-
mum wage, like Walmart competitor Costco, which pays its workers $17 an hour on average. Not to mention that many of these companies claiming a higher minimum 
wage would break them are also present in countries 
with higher minimum wages than the U.S. — countries such as Australia, the U.K. and France.
The only people corporations care about are share-
holders, not workers. The only way the economic situ-
ation will get better in this country is if policies like this 
start to change. We must quit prioritizing the rich over the poor and stereotyping low-income individuals and communities and give them what they deserve — fair 
wages and equal opportunities.

Facebook violates 
our civil liberties
As various public health, youth and consumer groups 
work this week to request the Federal Trade Commis-sion block Facebook from passing a bunch of sketchy 
changes to its privacy policy, we’re reminded of the old Ger-man legend of Faust.
Faust, commonly known as Dr. Faustus, was a scholar who 
famously made a pact with the devil. In exchange for the doc-tor’s soul, the devil would provide Faustus with whatever in-formation he might request. However, the fun didn’t last long: The devil eventually returned to collect Faustus’ soul, and Faust met a gruesome death.
These days, we don’t necessarily need to exchange our 
souls for endless information. Rather than signing a contract in blood, as Faustus did, we simply click “I Agree” to Facebook’s 
terms and conditions. And in this situation, Mark Zuckerberg 
is the devil.
In a review of the 2013 documentary “Terms and Conditions 
May Apply,” The Hufﬁ  ngton Post contributor Mark Weinstein wrote, “By clicking the ‘I Agree’ button, you blindly assent to hand over your life and interests to billion-dollar corporations to do with it what they may.”
The problem with free Internet services like Facebook and 
Google is that they aren’t exactly free. For users, the currency 
of free Internet services isn’t money — it’s your personal data.
The FTC has already taken action against Facebook, a noto-
rious distributor of personal data both to private corporations 
and the government. In 2011, Facebook had to settle with the FTC after it changed users’ default settings to make their infor-mation public, thus violating their privacy.
However, the 2011 conﬂ  ict with the FTC hasn’t discouraged 
Facebook from bending to the will of its ﬁ  nancial backers. The company is currently attempting to change the language in its 
privacy policy to accommodate advertisers at the expense of 
its users.
A Los Angeles Times article printed last week stated, “Fa-
cebook wants to put in place new language that requires users to give the company permission to use their name, image and personal information in advertising. ”
Meanwhile, Mark Zuckerberg told attendees at a tech con-
ference last week that his No. 1 job was to protect user data, ac-cording to the L.A. Times.  He also blamed the government for 
failing to strike the right balance between protecting citizens 
from terrorist attacks and violating their civil liberties.
This is, of course, ludicrous — Zuckerberg knowingly sup-
plies the government and private corporations with private user data. Pointing his ﬁ  nger at the government rather than taking accountability is a cowardly move.
Simply boycotting Facebook, unfortunately, is out of the 
question. The bottomless source of information — about our friends and family, our schools and places of employment, the 
products and services we buy — is, admittedly, a nice conve-
nience. Although our Faustian deal with Facebook won’t end 
with eternal damnation, it has already cost us our right to pri-
vacy.

� PHILLIP LIM FOR TARGET IMPRESSED 
YOUNG PROFESSIONALS IN TOWN.

Avenue Writer
Tilman Monsanto thinks shopping for men’s cloth-
ing in Gainesville is horrible.
The UF sociology and Spanish junior said he puts 
more thought into getting dressed than the average 
20-year-old guy. The lack of local boutiques for men 
puts a damper on his slim European style.
“I keep my eye out for things in the one or two 
shops around here,” he said. “I have to plan to make a trip to Orlando when I want something new.”
But urbanite UF students like Monsanto who 
don’t have access to designer stores can opt for a new 
wardrobe this fall with the 3.1 Phillip Lim for Target 
collection, which just hit stores Sunday.
More than one hundred fall essentials, includ-
ing leather jackets, button-down shirts and tailored 
pants are available for women and, on this rare oc-
casion, men. Items in the collection range from $19.99 
to $299.99.
Brian Jablonski, store team leader for the Target on 
Archer Road, said the company is always working on new collaborations and does a good job ﬁ  nding inter-
national designers.
In an interview with Target, designer Phillip Lim 
said he was interested in making a wardrobe for the 
stylish person on the go.
“It’s a little on the pricey edge,” 22-year-old Solo-
miya Virstyuk said, but she added the price accounts 
for the fact that Lim is expressing his artistic ability.
Virstyuk said she has to dress professionally now 
that she’s in pharmacy school.
She said even though she has a full schedule, she 
likes her outﬁ  ts to have hints of elegance, and Lim’s collection incorporates men’s style in women’s cloth-
ing with that elegance. It’s sharp, and the details are 
simple but interesting.
“The actual styles are not overdone,” she said. 
“They’re clean-cut and have color patterns that mix 
well together but won’t look tacky.”
Molly Muth, 22, an elementary education gradu-
ate student, said she was looking forward to buying Lim’s signature bag.
“They’re so cheap here, but they’re actually $100 
bags,” Muth said.
Lim designed versatile pieces that suit different 
moods — something for every day of the week, he said in the interview with Target.
Monsanto said his style depends on whom he is 
going to see and whether it’s a fancy dinner, going 
to Midtown or meeting with a professor. He said the 
Lim pieces can be worn on different occasions, and 
Target is making high-end fashion accessible and giv-
ing people more options.
”It’s important to be conscious of what you wear,” 
he said. “The ﬁ  rst impression is what lasts with peo-ple.”Target collab

Get out your Versace apron, Adi-
das sweatsuit and chainz ‘n’ thangs. 
It’s time to hit the kitchen — 2 Chainz-
style.
Hip-hop and rap artist 2 Chainz 
took his lyrics straight to the kitchen 
with a cookbook titled “#MEAL-
TIME.” It comes as a bonus digital 
booklet to his album “‘B.O.A.T.S. II: Me Time” on iTunes. The album was released Sept. 10.  
Nicolas Swain, a 21-year-old UF 
communications senior, said it’s in 2 Chainz’s nature to do something out-side the box, like publish a cookbook.
“That’s 2 Chainz for you,” he said. 
“He’s just a funny dude.”
2 Chainz and Atlanta-based chef 
Aleem collaborated on the recipes, which include shrimp and grits, fried 
chicken and garlic mashed potatoes. 
The recipes reﬂ  ect 2 Chainz’s love of seafood, he said in an interview with MSNBC.
Lauren Jadotte, a 21-year-old UF 
advertising junior, said 2 Chainz published the book simply to make money.
“He’s giving society what they 
want,” she said. “Foolishness.”
The recipes cor-
relate with the tracks on the record. The chicken marsala calls for two pounds of 
chicken and to listen 
to “U Da Realest,” 
while the last step of making fried chicken is to sit at the head of the table and sing along to “Beautiful Pain,” ac-
cording to the book.
Atlanta native 2 Chainz, born 
Tauheed Epps, was nominated for 
three Grammy Awards, according to 
the Grammy Award website. He is 
signed with Def Jam Recordings label, which also represents Kanye West, Rick Ross and Fabolous.
2 Chainz may not be a stranger to 
the music business, but Jadotte said she doesn’t consider him to be a true hip-hop artist.
“It’s an art form,” she said. “2 
Chainz is spitting on it.”However, she also said that it’s a 
smart business move, and that he’ll make money from it.
Bruce Floyd, UF social media spe-
cialist, also said he thinks it’s a smart 
publicity move, especially consider-
ing the hashtags 2 Chainz used in the titles of the album and cookbook. Hashtags create a common point for 
people to connect and to create a con-
versation.
“There isn’t going to be any confu-
sion as to how to talk about the album on social media,” he said. “It’s pretty 
brilliant.”
On the cookbook publication, 
however, Floyd was not surprised. It 
seems like every celebrity has a cook-
book these days, he said.
Kiana Robello, a 19-year-old UF 
psychology junior, said she is not im-
pressed with the cookbook. He’s try-ing to be different, she said, but the 
hype surrounding the cookbook will 
blow over.
“I think he could’ve done some-
thing more impressionable,” she said.

News ﬂ  ash: Not everything 
on the Internet is true. Yet 
people continue to share and reblog information without checking its accuracy.
One Pinterest user became 
fed up with false images por-traying celebrities with mis-attributed quotes. Emily, a 19-year-old junior studying English, who requested to keep her last name private, told Ko-taku.com, the posts were an-noying, and she decided to 
take action.
Emily created a satirical 
board of Taylor Swift pictures 
overlaid with quotes by Hitler, Stalin and Osama bin Laden. But the quotes were attributed to Taylor Swift, and the images were shared numerous times before anyone noticed the real 
men behind the curlicue script.  
One picture of Swift with 
the Hitler quote, “Do not com-
pare yourself to others. If you do so, you are insulting your-self,” received almost 300 re-pins.
Bruce Floyd, UF social me-
dia specialist, said he tells peo-
ple they  are what they tweet.
“Anything that you share 
from your account, retweet or 
repin is going to be associated with you in some way,” Floyd said.  
So, as a general rule, he ad-
vises students to look at things from a journalistic viewpoint and verify their sources. He said though any reference to Hitler can be provocative and controversial, it brings to light that it’s very easy to misattrib-ute a quote and for it to spread 
like wildﬁ  re.
However, the reaction to 
Emily’s board has been mixed.
She said some people mis-
interpreted her project as an 
attack against Taylor Swift or a promotion of anti-Semitism.
Swift has undergone sev-
eral transformations since she has become a household name, from straight hair to curly hair to straight hair with bangs. But the depiction of her with Hitler 
quotes was not one she wanted 
to debut.
Swift’s lawyers requested 
that Pinterest remove the posts, 
Emily said. However, the 
board is still up — now with a disclaimer — and Emily said Pinterest has defended her.
Emily said she has dealt 
with hundreds of “morons” who think she is anti-Semitic.
Rachael Cain, a 20-year-old 
UF music junior and the social justice intern for UF Hillel, said it was insensitive to use quotes by Hitler. Although she said she can’t speak for the Hil-
lel community, Cain said she 
thinks Emily posted the quotes 
by Hitler because he is some-one universally hated. 
Materials 
science and engineering junior Ben S w e r d l o w , 20, the Shab-
bat and holi-
days intern 
for Hillel, said he agrees with Emily, although he says his views do not represent Hillel. 
“It seems that she just is 
making a statement about the Internet and not believing ev-erything you see on it,” he said.
Swerdlow said he has no 
problem with the use of Hitler quotes for humorous effect. 
“After all,” he said, ”Mel 
Brooks once said, ‘By using the 
medium of comedy, we can try 
to rob Hitler of his posthumous power and myths.’”
Swerdlow  assured me that 
although he looked up the Mel Brooks quote online, it was taken directly from an inter-view with the German news magazine Spiegel, so hopefully 
it’s not misattributed like other 
quotes on the Internet.
I checked: The Mel Brooks 
quote is accurate.Taylor Swift has a

Dear Friend, 
The next fart you walk into may end your existence. I’m 
not certain, but look at the signs. A mere mortal cannot 
inhale and absorb that many poots in one lifetime — it’s 
simply not humanly possible! The Grim Reaper is prob-
ably around the corner f---king with you before you head to heaven, hell, outer space, an *NSYNC concert from the ‘90s —  whatever your afterlife may be. Enjoy your family, friends and food while you can. Make peace with your loud neighbors and the dog whose poop you always step in. I 
hope you lived a fulﬁ  lling life. Dear Mediocre Advice, 
In the past two months I’ve had the misfortune of 
unknowingly walking into a fart not once, not twice, 
but THREE times — and counting! At this rate I’ll have 
wandered into a baker’s dozen of feral farts by Christ-
mas! The jingle of a poot might make me laugh now, but I’m three crop dustings away from my limit. Am I experiencing some twisted form of karma? I honestly can’t think of one single thing that I’ve done to any-
body to deserve this.Dear Mediocre Advice, 
I met a guy last week and we 
hit it off. He asked me out for drinks later in the week and ev-
erything went swimmingly. We 
were both boozed up and he was being very touchy, holding my hand and kissing me at the bar. When he dropped me back home, he kissed me goodnight 
and planned our next date. We 
went out on a day date today, no booze involved, and he didn’t touch me at all, didn’t kiss me goodbye, and didn’t plan to meet up again. What’s 
the deal?!
Dear Friend, 
He did not go through a dramatic 
metamorphosis like something out 
of Animorphs — he just changed 
his mind. It’s like being really hun-
gry and then satisfying yourself with a whole pizza. You swear you are about to die from starvation and you end up eating until you want to die. He probably got his ﬁ  ll. 
Thankfully, you two weren’t very 
involved so it’ll be easy to just call him a dildo and get over it.THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Otto, the robot pictured above, is currently out of commission while 
he is being rebuilt and upgraded by Gator Robotics.
LAWRENCE CHAN
Avenue Writer
The Gator Robotics Club in-
tends to refit and rebuild a 7-foot 
humanoid robot.
After two years of operation 
as the Gator Robotics outreach mascot, Otto the robot’s battery failed, and he was placed into 
storage last year. 
However, Otto’s project lead-
er, 20-year-old UF junior John 
Milns, plans to rebuild and up-grade the metal mascot.
 “His battery ran out and an 
accidental collision into a door-way knocked Otto out of commis-sion,” Milns said. “Our goal this 
year is to fix him up and upgrade 
him better than before.”
Along with battery trou-
bles, Otto’s arm was violently launched awry from the main 
body after performing his duties 
for the day.
Otto’s design originated from 
an earlier incarnation of the ro-
bot built in 1957 for an engineer-
ing fair. This version of Otto was scrapped for parts a week after the fair, and the robot was forgot-ten until 2011 when Michael An-drews, president of the Benton Engineering Council, asked Gator Robotics to rebuild the robot.
Milns said that robotics club 
members will be working to fix the mechanisms in the robot’s arms and replace the battery. 
Plans are also in place to mecha-
nize Otto’s hips for rotational movement and to refit his chest with a latched opening to facili-tate future repairs and upgrades.
“Our goal this year is to have 
him operational by the end of the Fall semester,” Milns said. 
Prior to decommissioning, the 
robot could move its eyes, mouth and arms. A sensor in Otto’s right hand allowed the robot to respond to handshakes with pre-recorded dialogue and a wave.
According to the Gator Robot-
ics website, Otto’s frame of wood and aluminum is powered by a small 12-volt battery and an Ar-
duino microprocessor. 
Materials and funds for the 
robot’s construction are provided 
by the Benton Engineering Coun-cil and club member donations, Milns said.
Kevin French, publicity direc-
tor of Gator Robotics, said Otto is one of three robot projects run by 
Gator Robotics. 
Other projects include Luna-
botics, a lunar rover design in-
tended to mine the surface of the 
moon, and Tailgator, a tailgating 
robot designed to cool drinks and make burgers.
Work on Otto is intended to 
ease new members of the orga-
nization into the Gator Robotics 
design process. 
“Because Otto is mostly built 
already, he’s the easiest project 
to familiarize new members,” 
French said. “We also want new members to have fun brainstorm-ing upgrades to Otto.”
Twenty-year-old UF econom-
ics junior Nicholas Mils thinks the new robot is very intriguing and would be eye-catching dur-ing school events. 
“It’ll be cool if the robot be-
comes a new mascot for the school,” Mils said. “I think it’s a pretty awesome idea.”Otto the robot, let me upgrade youodd news

Nearly seven years ago, the world 
was introduced to Dexter Morgan, 
a blood splatter analyst with a Dark Passenger alter ego set on ridding the world of killers, one cheek slice at a time.
We have rooted for this character 
from the very first episode. He was empty on the inside, soulless and in-herently evil, yet we rooted for him be-cause he followed Harry’s code.
In the eighth and final season, we 
have learned how that code was devel-oped.
Although the code had been most 
associated with Dexter’s father, Dr. Evelyn Vogel was revealed as the true master behind the rules that helped forge Dexter’s moral compass.
Dexter admitted to seeing Dr. Vogel 
as a spiritual mother. This relationship was best depicted in Episode Eight, “Are We There Yet?” when Dr. Vogel cooked a dinner for Dexter, his spiritual wife Hannah McKay and their spiritual son Zach Hamilton.
Fittingly, the only person missing 
from the dinner table was Dexter’s spiritual evil twin brother Daniel Vogel aka Oliver Saxon aka the Brain Sur-geon, who was too busy planning the murders of his mother and Dexter’s protégé to attend.
Dexter is hell-bent on avenging their deaths by killing Daniel Vogel and run-ning away to Argentina with his son and Hannah McKay. But will he be able to do both before the feds discover he has been aiding and abetting his fugi-tive girlfriend?
Molly Kubik, a 
21-year-old UF ac-counting senior, be-lieves the show will have an open ending that allows viewers to decide what actually happened.
“I don’t think the end will show a 
definite ending like him making it to Argentina,” she said. “Although, I’d like to see Dexter get away with his son and find a new life without killing.”
Some fan theorists have pointed 
out the connection between Dexter’s biological mother and the impending hurricane, both named Laura. Others have claimed Quinn will kill Daniel af-ter Debra dies. Evidence for both theo-ries can be found by looking back at the things “Dexter” has taught us over the years.
“Dexter” has shown that the worst 
people in the world have some good, that the most holy people have some evil, that everyone has secrets and that nothing is more important than family.
Whether Dexter makes it to Ar-
gentina or not, we will be rooting for him until the very end this Sunday at 9 p.m. ‘Dexter’ enters the Kill 
Room this Sunday� THE FIFTH RALLY WILL BE SEPT. 28.

It started with an ad on Craigslist. 
The locally loved Pelican Brothers food 
truck was up for sale, and roommates Charlie Brown, Stephanie Norman and Pattee Green seized the opportunity. 
“We bought it at the end of June, and it’s 
been a blur ever since,” Norman said.
Within that blur was meeting new local 
food truck owners and serving thousands of customers at the Original Gainesville Food Truck Rally. The food truck trend that struck the nation a few years ago is quickly gaining momentum locally.
The fifth Original Gainesville Food Truck 
Rally will be on Sept. 28 at 5 p.m. in the newly paved High Dive parking lot. This time, a few more out-of-town trucks will be rolling in.
“Gainesville has a special-event culture 
to begin with,” explains Pat Lavery, owner of Glory Days Presents, the event promotion and production company that organized the first food truck rally in Gainesville. “It’s dif-ferent and new. Anything different and new, 
people get excited about,” he said.
Gainesville residents gave the rallies an ex-
tremely warm welcome from the beginning. 
“What started as a small idea has really 
blown up into something huge,” he said. 
“The first time we did it, we started later and had less vendors, so the lines were really long. Since then, we’ve doubled the vendors, we’ve extended the hours, and wait times are 
10 minutes or less.”
Pelican Brothers serves as the host food 
truck for the rallies. The decision to take over 
Pelican Brothers, found in front of High Dive at 210 SW 2nd Ave., was an easy one for Brown, Norman and Green. 
“It’s a lot more fluid (than a restaurant),” 
said Brown. “You can do late nights a lot easi-er, and you can take it to places and events.” This flexibility, unavailable to brick-and-
mortar restaurants, is part of the reason be-
hind food trucks’ popularity.
The trio, however, loves to experiment 
with new recipes. This includes trying neigh-
boring restaurant Five Star Pizza’s pizza dough deep-fried and deep frying bacon to add to the chicken and waffle slider.
“Customers expect to see something dif-
ferent at a food truck, so we like to switch it up,” Green said. “We cater to our custom-
ers. If we have the ingredients, we will try to 
make it.”
For Robert Tyler, owner of newly opened 
Gator Kart, starting a food truck was about exactly that: catering to the community. 
“In the food industry, you are there to 
service the community,” Tyler said. “What I learned from my mom was to prepare food where it tastes good, soul food, you know?”
His aim is to provide people with quick, 
nutritional food that is also filling and afford-
able. 
“Once, I was a student, so then I can make 
that transition to know the quality that a stu-
dent needs,” Tyler said.
Vendors aren’t the only ones who love 
their local food truck culture. 
“I like the variety of food you can find,” 
said Evangeline Culbreth, a 19-year-old East Asian languages and literatures sophomore 
at UF. “Beside, food trucks are significantly 
faster and cheaper (than restaurants), and the quality is usually the same.”
The original Gainesville Food Truck Rally 
is a social event.
“It’s a really community-oriented event,” 
Pat Lavery said. “We bring a lot of people downtown that otherwise wouldn’t come downtown.”Food truck rally back in town

have the ingredients, we will try to

against Miami a week later was torture. 
But after missing the first two games 
of the season, the senior right guard will 
return for No. 19 Florida (1-1) to face Ten-
nessee (2-1) on Saturday at 3:30 p.m. in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.
“Sitting out the last two games was re-
ally long,” Halapio said. 
“It was the longest two weeks of my 
life.”
Prior to this season, Halapio was the 
epitome of consistency for the Gators. The 
6-foot-3, 320-pound St. Petersburg native 
played in 41 games (33 starts) during his career at Florida. 
His 27 consecutive starts were the most 
on the team. 
Halapio, a second-team All-Southeast-
ern Conference pick, expected to be the anchor of Florida’s offensive line before an offseason injury clouded his plans. He 
suffered a partially torn pectoral muscle 
while lifting weights in July.
“We were doing max-out benching one 
day,” he said. “I came down and basically ripped my [pectoral muscle].”
The injury cost him all of fall camp and 
the first two games of the season. 
To quicken his recovery, Halapio re-
ceived a platelet-rich plasma injection and 
hours of medical treatment from Florida’s 
athletic training staff. 
Because the tear has not fully healed, 
Halapio will wear a brace consisting of a sleeve and multiple straps that combine to 
stabilize his shoulder and prevent it from 
rotating too far backward while he plays against the Volunteers.
“It’s still going to be weak, so it could 
still tear at any time,” said Halapio, who also admitted endurance could be an is-sue early in his return. 
“They’re telling me that’s the down 
side of it. But the brace helps really well. Practicing last week and this week was a 
confidence-booster for me, so I don’t have 
no concern.”
Halapio’s return should help bolster 
UF’s rushing attack. Through two games, 
the Gators have averaged the third-fewest 
yards on the ground in the SEC. 
During Florida’s 21-16 loss to Miami 
on Sept. 7, the Gators were bottled up for 122 rushing yards on 44 carries — an aver-age of just 2.8 yards per attempt.
“Having Halapio back is a big thing,” 
running back Mack Brown said. “We 
missed him early in the first two games. 
He’s a beast, man.”
Added fullback Hunter Joyer: “[Halap-
io] is one of the guys we look to on the of-
fense. He’s a leader on the line. The other 
guys on the line look up to him. It will be nice to have him back.”
Florida also received good news per-
taining to the rest of the offensive line. 
Left tackle D.J. Humphries (knee) is ex-
pected to return for Tennessee after miss-ing the second half against Miami. Right tackle Tyler Moore (ankle) is probable to 
play against the Volunteers. 
Center Jon Harrison and left guard Max 
Garcia, who were each banged up against 
the Hurricanes, were not mentioned by coach Will Muschamp on Wednesday and 
should be fully healthy. Florida expects 
to have its entire starting offensive line healthy for the first time this season.
“It feels good to be out there with ev-
erybody else,” Halapio said. “I’ve got to knock the rust off and get back in the swing of things real fast.”Offensive lineman returning after missing first two games

Florida defensive coordinator 
D.J. Durkin remembers how stout 
Tennessee’s offensive line was last 
year. 
During the Gators’ 37-20 win 
against the Volunteers on Sept. 15, 
2012, UT running back Raijon Neal 
rushed for 87 yards on 23 carries 
thanks largely to the offensive line’s success. The top-10 Florida defense managed to sack Tennessee quarter-back Tyler Bray only once. 
The Volunteers return four of 
their five starters — center James Stone, right guard Zach Fulton and tackles Antonio Richardson and Ja’Wuan James — from last year’s unit. 
The only starter removed from 
last season’s line is left guard Dallas Thomas, who the Miami Dolphins selected with the 77th overall pick in 
the 2013 NFL Draft.
“They’re big,” Durkin said. “They’re physi-
cal. They move well. They’re ath-
letic. ... So, not only off tape do we feel that way, but after playing 
them we feel that 
way. And our 
guys know that and understand. It’s a big challenge for them, and I think 
they’re excited for it.”
Southeastern Conference coach-es named Richardson to the pre-
season first team. Fulton and James 
earned All-SEC second-team offense 
honors, while Stone is on the third team. 
“This will be the best offensive 
line we will face this year,” coach 
Will Muschamp said Monday.
In three games this season, the 
Volunteers offensive line has al-
lowed only two sacks. The unit has 
excelled at run blocking; UT ranks 
fourth in the conference with 244.3 rushing yards per game. 
Florida’s defense is up for the 
challenge Saturday against Tennes-see’s physical front. 
“It’ll be a good test,” linebacker 
Michael Taylor said. “It’s another SEC line. The SEC is supposed to 
have the best players in the coun-
try. It’s the same line that has been there for a while now. They’ve got camaraderie. They’ve been playing 
together since they first got there. So 
Florida preparing to face strong Tennessee offensive line“Sitting out the last two games 
was really long. It was the longest 
two weeks of my life.”

THE RALLY
Each week, two alligatorSports 
columnists will debate the biggest 
looming matchup in college football. 
Today, Adam Lichtenstein  and Adam 
Pincus preview No. 5 Stanford’s showdown against No. 23 Arizona State in Stanford, Calif.,  on Saturday 
at 7 p.m. on FOX.
Adam: As you may have no-
ticed, both columnists this week 
have the same (read: best) ﬁ  rst name. For simplicity and longev-
ity’s sake, I, Adam Lichtenstein, 
will go by “Adam,” and Adam Pincus will go by “Pincus.”
Were you expecting a game 
with more orange? Although Ten-nessee-Florida may be a closer ri-valry game, the fact of the matter is that it simply won’t be a very good game.Tennessee was absolutely 
thrashed by Oregon last week-end, and although the Gators 
don’t have nearly as good of 
an offense as the Ducks, they will handle the Volunteers without much trouble.
Meanwhile, as triumphant 
Florida fans make their way out of the gates of Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium, the sole top-25 matchup of the week will be brew-
ing on the West Coast.
Arizona State comes into this 
week after one of the most bizarre 
endings to a game that I have ever 
seen. Up against then-No. 20 Wis-
consin, ASU took a lead but allowed UW to march down the ﬁ  eld at the end of the fourth quarter. With seconds to spare, Badgers quar-terback Joel 
Stave tried to set up his kicker with an easy ﬁ  eld goal, but Stave put the ball down while failing to actu-ally make contact with the ground. The Sun Devils piled on top of the 
fumble, ending the game.
Arizona State got the break of 
a lifetime and scratched out a win 
last week, but it won’t be so lucky 
when it travels to Stanford this 
week. The Cardinal will win this game easily.
Pincus: Not so fast my 
friend (insert Lee Corso ﬁ  nger 
wag). How can you go against 
a school that leads the nation in blackouts on and off the ﬁ  eld? Arizona State is a peren-
nial party-school-list power-
house. 
This is a huge game for both 
schools. For Stanford, it’s a chance to recover from a less-than-impres-
sive 34-20 win against Army and 
an opportunity to solidify its No. 5 ranking. 
For Arizona State, it’s a chance 
to prove that last week was more than luck. The Sun Devils need this football game. A win would prac-tically hand them the Paciﬁ  c-12 South Division title, considering 
UCLA’s tougher schedule going 
forward. 
If you want to get geeky, Ari-
zona State tops Stanford in total 
offense and has a nearly identi-
cal mark in total defense with 304 yards per game compared to the Cardinal’s 292. After two-and-a-half seasons of watching Florida 
football, I’m all for a passing of-
fense that throws for 358.5 yards per game. Yet, Stanford allows less than half of that per contest. Some-
thing has got to give, and judging 
by last week’s miraculous ﬁ  nish against the Badgers, who can go against the Sun Devils with the football gods on their sides?
Adam: It must be nice out in 
Phoenix now that ASU is getting its ﬁ  rst taste of relevancy since Rod Tidwell told Jerry Maguire to show 
him the money.
Unfortunately for all those Sun 
Devils out there, it’s not going to 
last.
Yeah, Stanford did not look like 
a top-ﬁ  ve team to open the season, but the Cardinal will ﬁ  nally shake off its preseason sleepiness when it enters Stanford Stadium against a 
worthy opponent.Senior running back Tyler Gaff-
ney is back in football form after 
sitting out the 2012 season to play 
minor league baseball.
Gaffney averaged more than 
six yards per carry as Stepfan Tay-
lor’s backup in 2011, and Gaffney 
is right back at it after hitting .297 
and stealing 11 bases in the New York-Penn League.
Through the ﬁ  rst two games of 
the season, Gaffney is notching 5.9 
yards per touch and is 19th in the 
nation with 118 yards per game. 
Arizona State may have held 
punchless Sacramento State to 51 
yards on the ground, but when the 
Sun Devils took on the Badgers — you know, a team with an actual rushing attack — they let Melvin Gordon beat them to the tune of 
193 yards and a pair of scores.
When Gaffney lines up in the 
backﬁ  eld, he will have the Sun 
Devils at hello.
Pincus: As an aside, I’m watch-
ing this game because Gus John-son will be in the booth. He could make even a conversation with you sound exciting! What a legend. 
Granted, it doesn’t look good 
for the Sun Devils, but picking them isn’t as stupid as quoting the cheesiest part of a great football 
movie. Your sensitivity is quite 
cute. 
I’m going all in on Todd Gra-
ham’s squad from the desert. 
Name to watch out for: wide 
receiver Jaelen Strong. The soph-omore has 12 receptions for 162 yards and a touchdown. He’s been quarterback Taylor Kelly’s go-
to receiver through the ﬁ  rst two 
weeks. 
There isn’t much else to talk 
about for a Pac-12 game that few in Gainesville will watch. 
Gators fans will be recovering 
from tailgating hangovers, run-heavy offenses and a Florida win against the boys from Rocky Top.Which team will win the Arizona State-Stanford matchup?

No. 4 Florida (9-1) trailed 
9-8 in the second set against 
No. 17 Florida State (6-4) on 
Tuesday, and it appeared an-
other long point might not fall 
in the Gators’ favor. 
Florida missed chances to 
close out points against West-ern Michigan in its previous match, allowing the Broncos to come back and win the third set in UF’s four-set vic-
tory on Friday.  
But Tuesday was a differ-
ent story. 
The point went back and 
forth multiple times before 
outside hitter Ziva Recek notched a kill to tie the score at nine.
From there, the Gators 
were on track for a three-set sweep of the Seminoles in the O’Connell Center. 
“The players were very fo-
cused,” coach Mary Wise said. “There was some great volley-ball there. 
“The ﬁ  rst set was back and 
forth with no separation. … I 
think what you saw were two 
teams playing their hearts out early in the season.” 
Although Florida won in 
a sweep, each set could have gone to either team. 
In the second set, FSU led 
UF 24–23, needing only one more point for the Seminoles to grab momentum and enter 
the break tied.
Instead, the Gators kept 
the point going long enough 
to force the Seminoles into a ball-handling error. 
Florida proceeded to win 
the next two points to take the set and put the Seminoles in a 2-0 hole. 
The most instrumental 
player in keeping those plays alive for UF was libero Taylor Unroe, who led the team with 10 digs. 
“Taylor Unroe really 
played well for us, especially in the serving-passing area,” Wise said.  
“Florida State never made 
long service runs. … We’re at our best when we’re using all of our hitters.” 
Having Unroe make key 
digs allowed setter Taylor Brauneis to get better options for quick kills with middle blocker Chloe Mann and right-
side hitter Alex Holston.
“We knew that they had 
some big bangers,” Unroe 
said. 
“So we knew we had to 
block well.  We made enough of those plays to win the game, and that’s what really helped us win.” 
With the Gators up 12–7 in 
the third set, trying to close out their rivals, the ball rico-cheted high off of a Florida player. It looked like the point 
was over.
Unroe then proceeded to 
spring toward the bench and 
make a lunging dig, hitting 
the ball right before it was 
untouchable and keeping it alive.
Florida got the ball back 
over the net and got the point a few moments later on an at-
tack error by Florida State’s 
Ashley Neff. 
Another challenge facing 
Florida entering Tuesday was 
Florida State’s height advan-
tage. 
But not only did UF have 
nine blocks in the match,  it shut down the Walch sisters 
— two of FSU’s top offensive 
threats.Nicole Walch had 14 kills 
but a hitting percentage of .276. Elise Walch had only seven kills on a hitting per-centage of .158.
“[Winning] deﬁ  nitely feels 
good,” Unroe said. 
“You know, last year we 
didn’t play well, and they played awesome. This year, 
we battled it out, and we were 
able to come out with a win.”

Injury update: Muschamp reafﬁ  rmed 
Wednesday during the SEC’s weekly 
media teleconference that quarterback 
Jeff Driskel (sprained knee) and right guard Jon Halapio (partially torn pecto-ral muscle) will play Saturday against 
the Volunteers. 
Cornerback Marcus Roberson 
(sprained knee) and right tackle Tyler 
Moore (sprained ankle) are probable.
Driskel, Roberson and Moore suffered 
their injuries against the Hurricanes.
“Right now, Marcus Roberson, I think 
still will be able to play this weekend,” Muschamp said. 
“He was a little gimpy yesterday, but 
he should be OK, and Tyler Moore, the same.”
On UF’s most recent depth chart, D.J. 
Humphries, who suffered a sprained 
MCL against Toledo but played in the 
ﬁ  rst half versus Miami, is listed as the starter at left tackle.
“I think the week off helped him,” 
Muschamp said Monday. “He had some soreness and some tightness in the knee, and it certainly is a long season. 
“I felt like we wanted to pull him at 
the time. It is what it is. If that situation 
occurs, Max Garcia moves to left tackle 
and Ian (Silberman) goes to left guard and we move forward. We’re prepared for that to happen. 
“But I don’t think that’s going to be an 
issue moving forward.”Cornerback,
