Erin Andrews, ESPN sports-
caster and UF graduate, will 
share her story at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts on Wednesday evening.
Accent Speakers Bureau and 
the Women’s Student Associa-tion are teaming up to host the free event, which will begin at 8 p.m. Doors open at 7 p.m., and seating is ﬁ  rst-come, ﬁ  rst-served.
Telecommunication sopho-
more Tori Petry, 19, said she looks 
to Andrews as 
an example of 
breaking the stereotype that 
claims sports are for men. Petry said she  hopes to be-come a side-line reporter or 
sports anchor.
Accent chairman Corey Port-
noy said Andrews’ ties to UF make her a great ﬁ  t as a speaker.
In addition to being a sports-
caster and journalist for ESPN, Andrews served as co-host of ESPN’s “College GameDay” in 2011. She was also a contributor 
to Good Morning America on 
ABC.
Andrews will receive $15,000 
to speak and answer questions from the audience.
Women’s Student Association 
President Kathy Keeter said An-drews ties into the overall theme of this year’s Women’s History 
Month, “Making History Ours,” 
and hopes female students will feel empowered after hearing her speak.Erin

The Gainesville area now has the second-
lowest unemployment rate in Florida — a 
welcome statistic to students who will soon be looking for jobs.
According to data released Friday by the 
Florida Department of Economic Opportuni-ties, the unemployment rate for the Gainesville metropolitan area fell to 7.1 percent.
The rate has been decreasing for three 
months and is now behind that of Fort Wal-
ton Beach area, which has a 6.6-percent jobless 
rate.
The report’s local rates are not seasonally 
adjusted.
The number of people with jobs in the Gainesville metropolitan area, which includes Alachua and Gilchrist counties, jumped by 1,373 to 127,641 in February.
Alachua County’s overall unemployment 
rate dropped to 7 percent in February from 7.3 percent in January, according to the report.
The statewide unemployment rate fell to 9.4 Unemployment rate second in Florida

A Gainesville man died last weekend while 
cave diving in a north Tampa spring.
Marson A. Kay, 29, of 5417 NW 35th Drive, 
became wedged in a cavern that was too tight to swim through on Saturday afternoon. He 
was trying to reach the water’s surface at Wee-
ki Wachee Springs State Park, but a Hernando County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce rescue team found him dead at the scene.Kay was part of a six-man team that dove 
to the cave for Karst Underwater Research, a nonproﬁ  t organization that explores marine environments for researchers. Karst Underwa-ter relies on volunteers, like Kay.
The group descended about 180 feet into 
the water at about 3:30 p.m. Saturday. When Kay, a certiﬁ  ed diver, swam back toward the surface, he took a different path than the rest of his team. Kay might not have been able to free himself because the spring was ﬂ  owing too strongly in the opposite direction, a sheriff’s ofﬁ  ce report speculated.
Other members of the caving team tried to 
pry Kay loose. Karst Underwater President 
Brett Hemphill called 911, and a rescue team 
was on the scene within three minutes, accord-ing to the sheriff’s ofﬁ  ce. When they found Kay, he was dead, his mask pushed up to his forehead.
Family members, co-workers and friends 
declined to be interviewed, saying they need-ed a few days to themselves before they would feel comfortable talking.
However, they added that Kay loved to 
dive. In his driveway sits a new motorboat. He just bought it, one family member said.

UF students are making more al-
cohol-related emergency calls, and 
a GatorWell official said that might 
not be a bad thing.
In Fall 2010, paramedics exam-
ined or took to the hospital five 
students, according to information 
from Maureen Miller, GatorWell’s 
Coordinator for Alcohol and Other Drug Prevention. A year later, 24 were examined or transported.
Miller told the UF Community 
Alcohol Coalition on Monday morn-ing that students could be respond-ing to the medical amnesty policy, which withholds charges and school 
discipline when students call in al-cohol abuse cases. 
She said after the meeting that the 
policy went into effect April 2011.
There have been eight calls so far 
this semester, the same as the total 
for Spring 2011.
Dave Kratzer, Interim Vice Presi-
dent for Student Affairs, said the policy is a good alternative to stu-dents letting drunk friends “sleep it off.”
“We think we’ve taken the fear 
out of the process of calling for help,” he said.
He pointed out that no UF stu-
dents have died from alcohol this 
year. 
Freshman Molly Ammon died 
from alcohol poisoning in Spring 
2011, and her friends and family re-cently created a Facebook page en-
couraging students — underage or 
not — to call 911 when needed.
Miller said she will educate in-
coming students about alcohol abuse 
at Preview. She met with dorm resi-
dent assistants last week.

� THE TEENS HAD A BB GUN.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
OGDEN, Utah — Four Utah teens 
armed with a BB gun told deputies 
they were inspired by a scene from an “American Pie” movie when they went running naked through an Ogden-area neighborhood.
Authorities said Wednesday the 
teens were spotted streaking in the res-idential community about 45 minutes north of Salt Lake City at about 2 a.m. Sunday.
When a deputy responded, a 
17-year-old girl ducked behind a tree, while the three teenage boys kept run-ning and were found shortly after.
The teens said they brought the BB 
gun because they feared they would be attacked by deer during the jog.
Deputies notified the teens’ parents 
and let them off with a warning.

Naked Mile” features a high school stu-dent who wants to join a college cam-pus’ tradition of running a mile naked.Utah teens’ naked run

UF researchers, along with scientists from 
six other centers, were recently awarded a 
$63-million grant to continue developing heart disease therapies.
The money will fund seven years of re-
search, which uses patients’ bone marrow and heart cells for therapies, according to a news release.
The National Institutes of Health’s National 
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute gave the grant to the Cardiovascular Cell Therapy Research 
Network, an organization of seven clinical trial 
centers.
UF’s portion of the grant is more than $5 
million, according to the release.
Dr. Carl J. Pepine, UF’s principal investi-
gator, said the money will pay the salaries of about 15 staff members who provide the frame-work for research. UF’s team includes branches at several medical centers in Florida.
The group hopes to generate new cells and 
blood vessels, which could help patients func-tion better, he said.
“Many of us believe that this is the next 
frontier in the therapy of cardiovascular dis-ease,” Pepine said.
The rest of the money went to patient care, 
the data coordinating center and other centers, Pepine said.

Tim Mason is already a justice, and now he will be 
president.
Mason, an associate justice of the UF Supreme Court, 
was elected Sunday as the Florida College Democrats 
2012-13 president.
The Florida College Democrats held its annual con-
vention last weekend at Florida State University. Four -
teen chapters were present to vote Mason, a 23-year-old Orlando native and second-year UF law student, president Sunday, said Erin Murphy, vice president of Florida College Democrats and president of UF College Democrats.
Mason will lead the 22 state College Democrats 
chapters in furthering the Democratic Party.
Mason was the only UF student running for an exec-
utive position, according to the Florida College Demo-
crats website. His opponent was Paige Brice from the 
University of Central Florida.
Ben Cavataro was the last UF student to be state 
president, in the 2009-10 school year, Mason said.
“I felt honored, and I’m focused on the future,” he 
said.
He said his No. 1 goal in the fall semester will be to get President Obama re-elected. Central to that would be getting students registered to vote and then getting them to show up at the polls on Election Day, he said.
During the spring semester, he said he will be work-
ing on a legislative agenda, which will focus on Florid-
ians’ access to higher education.
Mason has been a member of the College Democrats 
for four years. Before joining the UF College Democrats 
in the fall of 2010, Mason was a member at UCF, where he received a bachelor’s degree in political science in 
Spring 2010. He also attended Valencia College and re-
ceived his associate’s degree a few months after gradu-ating high school in 2007.
He currently heads a five-member constitutional 
committee, which revises the organization’s constitu-
tion, for the UF College Democrats, Murphy said.
Murphy, a 21-year-old environmental science se-
nior, said she has known Mason for about three years.
She met him at the annual convention in 2010 when 
it was hosted at UCF.
Murphy said Mason will do a great job in his new 
position and is incredibly dedicated to the organiza-
tion.
“I’m very happy,” Mason said. “But at the same 
time, the gravity of the task is very humbling.”

Statewide rates are lowest since Feb. 2009
percent in February with 869,000 people unemployed in 
Florida, according to the seasonally adjusted rate — the lowest since about February 2009.
In February 2011, the statewide unemployment rate 
was 10.8 percent, while the U.S. average was 9 percent.
Alachua County spokesman Mark Sexton said the 
county, including Gainesville, is an ideal place for com-
panies to set up offices and create jobs.
“If you have a place that’s green, exciting and has a 
lot going on culturally, I think it’s a place where compa-
nies are convinced that’s where their employees want to be,” he said.
Colin Knapp, a visiting UF economics professor, said 
the decrease in the number of unemployed people and increase in the labor force is a good sign for economic 
growth.
“Gainesville is experiencing different labor market 
trends,” he said. “Gainesville is starting to see some job 
growth, but we aren’t decreasing the labor force, which is a good thing.”
Like many soon-to-be graduates, Sam Rudik, a 
22-year-old economics senior, will be looking for work. He said the decline in local unemployment rates is a wel-coming sign for future job opportunities.
“I’m really optimistic about the economy, its recov-
ery and what it means for my prospective entry into the workforce,” he said.Unemployment , from page 1

Shands at UF plans to reopen 
its liver transplant program in the 
next two months, according to hos-pital officials.
The transplant program, which 
peaked in recent activity with 103 transplants in 2008, had trans-plants drop by more than 50 per -
cent during 2009. They stayed rela-tively flat in 2010, according to the Shands website.
Shands voluntarily deactivated 
its liver and pancreas transplant programs in August, including transplants for children. Three sur -
geons had left the hospital in less than two months, and there were not enough faculty to provide needed care to patients, said Dr. Kevin Behrns, chair of the depart-ment of surgery at UF.
Miami is the only location in 
Florida that will perform liver 
transplants for children.
Last month, the department of 
surgery hired a new chief of trans-
plantation surgery, Dr. Jeffrey Fair, and began filing paperwork to the United Network for Organ Sharing to resume liver transplants.
Shands can currently evaluate patients for liver transplants but cannot put them on an organ do-nor waiting list.
About 30 patients are interested 
in going back on the Shands wait-ing list, Behrns said, but it is un-certain how long the hospital will have to wait to perform a liver transplant. 
The median wait time for a pa-
tient on the Shands transplant list is three months, according to the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients.
“You need the appropriate 
recipient and the organ donor,” Behrns said.

Researchers have found con-
servative UF students may be 
happier than their liberal peers because of personality traits.
UF psychology research-
ers John Chambers and Barry Schlenker studied more than 400 UF students over three years. Their research revealed conservative participants tend-ed to exhibit greater optimism, self-esteem and feelings of con-trol over their lives.
The research provides a new 
explanation for what political psychologists call the “happi-ness gap.” In a 2006 Pew Re-search Center poll, 61 percent of Republicans said they were very happy as opposed to only 47 percent of Democrats.
This created a mystery for 
researchers. Factors such as in-
come, religion and age account-
ed for part of the gap, but they wondered if there was a deeper psychological explanation.
In 2007, two social psycholo-
gists from New York Univer -
sity took a crack at the puzzle. Analyzing the happiness gap in the United States and nine oth-
er countries, professors Jaime 
Napier and John Jost concluded conservatives were happier be-cause of their ability to rational-ize inequalities.
For example, right-wingers 
may perceive the difference be-tween rich and poor in the U.S. as natural or inevitable, where-as left-wingers find it more 
troublesome.
Public relations senior Han-
nah Brown, 28, describes herself 
as politically neutral. She said she’s seen these differences play out in debates on Turlington Plaza and in class.
“I think conservatives focus 
more on control and responsi-
bility ,” she said, “and liberals 
think more about systems.”
Yet Chambers and his UF 
colleagues thought this wasn’t enough to explain a persistent difference in well-being. By ar -
guing that conservatives have positive personality traits, they triggered a barrage of criticism.
“I find his data really inter -
esting and useful,” Jost said, “but I think the paper goes too far. It ends up telling an incom-plete, Pollyanna-ish story.”
Chambers, however, de-
fended his political neutrality.
“Listen,” he said, “I don’t 
have a pony on the track here.”Study: Conservatives 
happier than liberals

Students can help their fellow Gators by 
cleaning up a different type of swamp.
Student organizations can sign up to 
clean and maintain conservation areas on 
campus through the UF Ofﬁ  ce of Sustain-
ability’s Adopt-A-“Swamp” program.
The program will launch at the start of 
the 2012 academic year, but a handful of or-
ganizations have gotten a head start.
This semester has been spent ﬁ  nalizing 
the cleanup process, said Ashley Penning-ton, Ofﬁ  ce of Sustainability outreach coor-dinator.
Student organizations can get involved 
next year by ﬁ  lling out an application through the Ofﬁ  ce of Sustainability.
When a club adopts a “swamp,” it will be responsible for keeping it clean from August to the following August, she said.
UF GreenLaw participated in Adopt-A-
“Swamp” to clean the Law School Woods near the Levin College of Law.
GreenLaw, formerly known as the Envi-
ronmental and Land Use Law Society, has been maintaining the area since 2007.
The group has had two cleanups this se-
mester to pick up litter, clear trails and clear the area of invasive plant species, said Jenni-lyn Thiboult, senior president of GreenLaw.
“In general, we try to encourage people 
to enjoy the outdoors and not be stuck in the library all day,” Thiboult said.
While the UF Wetlands Club is not an 
ofﬁ  cial part of the program, it has collected 13,931 pounds of trash from the Bivens Arm ﬂ  oodplain since 2004, according to Rupesh Bhomia, the organization’s president.
Almost 3,000 pounds of litter were col-
lected from central campus wetlands after a campus cleanup by the Ofﬁ  ce of Sustainabil-ity last semester, Pennington said.Clubs can adopt a ‘swamp’

gencies ever since a series of crashes on In-terstate 75 in January took 11 lives.
Insurance World, of which Hazy is pres-
ident, recently started sponsoring “In Case of Emergency” key tags, which are plastic tags that attach to key rings.
I.C.E. is written on the front of the tags to 
alert police of emergency contact numbers on the back in case a person’s phone is de-stroyed or missing in an accident.
Hazy said the I-75 crashes encouraged 
him to sponsor the key tags, which are 
free.
“Everyone should have them,” he said. 
“If you get hurt or are in an accident, police 
can see your wallet but won’t know who to call if your phone is crushed.”
Tom Force, CEO of I.C.E. Keytags, said 
Hazy is the only one sponsoring the key tags in North Florida.
People can also download a free EMS information form from the I.C.E. Keytag 
website. The form, which is kept in a ve-
hicle’s glove compartment, provides medi-cal information to rescue workers, such as medical conditions, allergies, recent surger-ies and medications.
University Police ofﬁ  cer Hank Spurlin 
said he thinks the I.C.E. key tag would need a big campaign to succeed.
“The ﬁ  rst thing I do is look for a cellphone 
and dial the last number called or look for ‘Mom’ and ‘Dad,’” he said. “I wouldn’t 
think to look at the person’s keys.”
Muri Flores, an 18-year-old wildlife ecol-
ogy and conservation freshman, said she 
would consider getting an I.C.E. key tag.
“It’s a good idea because a lot of people 
keep their emergency numbers in their phones, but their phones can get crushed or lost,” she said. “Contact information on key tags 
could save time in emergencies
“The ﬁ  rst thing I do is look for a 
cellphone and dial the last number 
called or look for ‘Mom’ and ‘Dad.’”

Bloomberg bans      
donations to homeless
A new proposal by New York City Mayor Michael 
Bloomberg has many people scratching their heads,  and rightly so.
Bloomberg might as well be King of the Nannies, given his 
record on trying to ban, tax and regulate everything he can get 
his hands on in New York City.
In 2010, according to The New York Times, Bloomberg pro-
posed a tax on soda he argued “would reduce consumption 
… driving down obesity rates and the accompanying medical costs.”
The following year, Bloomberg said “government’s highest 
duty” was to “halt the worldwide epidemic of noncommuni-cable diseases.” In other words, the mayor believes govern-ment must encourage all of us, through taxes, bans and regu-
lations, to have better dietary habits.
In January of this year, the nosy mayor pushed to make it 
harder to obtain alcohol in New York City by decreasing the 
number of places that sell adult beverages.
Bloomberg’s philosophy of public health assumes it is the 
government’s role to make us healthier, whether we want to or not.
However, his latest decision will likely have even the most 
nanny-state-oriented people wondering where to draw the 
line.
According to CBS New York, Bloomberg decided to ban 
“food donations to homeless shelters because the city can’t as-
sess their salt, fat and ﬁ  ber content.”
That’s right, because there are people out there whose main 
goal is to take the time, energy and effort to make extremely fatty, salt-ﬁ  lled foods to donate to homeless shelters only to watch the homeless slowly die of heart disease and high cho-lesterol.
It might be one thing to want to screen the food donated to 
homeless shelters to ensure that everything had been properly cooked, but to ban food donations is just downright insane.
Not only will this proposal cost the city hundreds, if not 
thousands, in unnecessary food costs, but it will also likely lead to food shortages at homeless shelters across the city.
Bloomberg’s “duty” to ensure that even the homeless re-
ceive properly regulated and healthy food could mean less food to go around and more hungry homeless people.
So how, Mr. Bloomberg, are we supposed to regulate the fat, 
salt and ﬁ  ber content of trash cans and dumpsters throughout the city?
Because, under your ban, more homeless will likely have to 
dig their way to a few scraps of garbage instead of getting safe, home-cooked meals donated by the most generous in the city.
Bloomberg’s move also completely ignores a new study 
from the American Journal of Hypertension which found “lit-tle signiﬁ  cant evidence that eating more salt would shorten 
one’s life.”
Do you know what does shorten one’s life, Mr. 
Bloomberg?
Starvation.Hunger Games reﬂ  ects reality TV
If you haven’t seen “The Hunger Games” already, do 
yourself a favor and go see it.
The ﬁ  lm is an absolute must-see. Unlike your typi-
cal, over-hyped teen novel trilogies (say, the “Twilight” and “Harry Potter” series), “The Hunger Games” meets all ex-pectations.
Just make sure you don’t go on a full stomach; the cam-
era is a tad shaky at times.
I’ll spare the spoilers, but “The Hunger Games” pulls 
you into the trial and triumph of Katniss Everdeen. Superb 
acting, an intriguing plot and an ending ripe for a promis-
ing sequel makes for a blockbuster.
The hype does not disappoint. “The Hunger Games” 
grossed more than $155 million its opening weekend.
I haven’t read the series, so I can’t testify how true the 
movie is to the book.
While Suzanne Collins should be applauded for her suc-
cess with the series, she should also be recognized for her foresight, however alarming it may be.
Although entertaining, the ﬁ  lm brings awareness to the 
toxicity of reality television and society.
Think about it: Twenty-four teens between the ages of 
12 and 18 are chosen from different parts of the nation to ﬁ  ght to the death, and their chance of survival is depen-
dent upon winning over sponsors. Before the Games, they 
have to dress to impress for the audience and speak with the television host. Everything that goes on in the Games is fabricated for higher ratings.
Others perceive the plot to reﬂ  ect upon government 
control, as the ﬁ  lm does have Orwellian elements (a post-war nation), but to me it clearly speaks of the disillusioned glamor of reality television and the race to pack in the most over-the-top shock value for the audience’s indulgence.
Take the “Jersey Shore” cast, for example. We put this 
group in a room with a bunch of cameras. Tensions run high, verbal and physical ﬁ  ghts start and ratings jump up. Younger, more susceptible viewers want to enjoy the same fame, unaware of what goes on behind the camera.People get hooked: Team 
“this” and Team “that” shirts are sold, and viewers pine for more 
outrageous drama on the set. 
We’ve become obsessed, cheer-ing for our favorite reality TV star to sabotage other players for his 
or her own advantage.
In the ﬁ  lm, Gale Hawthorne, 
a “friend” of Katniss, says it best: 
“What if one year everyone just stopped watching? Then 
they wouldn’t have the Games.”
What if people just stopped watching reality TV? It’s a 
guilty pleasure for many, but has it really become America’s 
unhealthy addiction? Reputations get trashed for the world 
to see, and people change for the worse in front of the cam-era. The only ones who win are the fat-cat producers laugh-ing their way to the bank.
Snooki and the Situation may not be shooting arrows 
and physically stabbing each other, but there’s enough ver-bal backstabbing going around to do some damage.
We need to remember that though these people vol-
untarily agree to be in these shows (unlike “The Hunger Games”), they’re still people. And yet we smile at their de-
mise.
I’m not calling for viewers to quit these shows cold-
turkey, but when the drama becomes so overblown to the 
point that it gets unbelievably fake, then it’s time to change 
the channel.
If raunchy shows are your thing, TV has much more to 
offer than “Jersey Shore” or “Real Housewives” in the ba-
zillion channels available (I’m talking about “South Park,” “Tosh.0,” “It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia”). There’s 
more to the TV guide than cheap reality television.
Happy watching, and may the odds be ever in your fa-
vor.

What Americans have experienced in the 
course of the last three years has been a cacophony of Arab political upheavals, 
U.S. economic uncertainty, a flurry of legislative achievements and a divided nation.
In spite of some extraordinary foreign and leg-
islative accomplishments, President Obama’s re-
election remains eerily uncertain, compounded by 
several factors both in and out of his control.
When determining the prospects that a sitting 
president will be re-elected, one has to look at the state of the economy.
Let’s get the facts straight. Americans vote with 
their pocketbooks. The U.S. economy is currently picking up, which is in Obama’s favor.
Earlier this week, Federal Reserve chairman Ben 
Bernanke told ABC News, “We haven’t quite yet got to the point where we can be completely confi-dent that we’re on a track to full recovery.” 
However, there were 2 percent fewer foreclo-
sures in February compared to January, according 
to RealtyTrac. 
On the other hand, gas prices continue to in-
crease, bringing down the president’s approval rat-
ings.
Job growth has steadily increased, with more 
than 200,000 jobs added last December. 
The economy grew 3 percent during the final 
quarter of 2011, but these numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show some foundation for an im-
proving economy.
The danger over European austerity threatens 
the fragile euro, and our own economy is not free 
of either the burden of inflation or a double-dip re-
cession.
On the foreign policy front, a New York Times 
poll found that 69 percent of Americans believe we 
should not be at war in Afghanistan. 
This lack of confidence signals trouble to the un-
stable Middle Eastern nation, just as the U.S. pre-pares to depart.
The biggest issue, in terms of foreign policy, ap-
pears to be the acquisition of nuclear weapons by 
Iran, which Israel has already stated it will not tol-
erate.
The relationship between President Obama and 
Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel is tainted with a lack of confidence and personality conflicts. 
At the American Israel Public Affairs Committee 
policy conference on March 5, Netanyahu stated, “We’ve waited for di-
plomacy to work, we’ve 
waited for sanctions to work. None of us can afford to wait much lon-
ger.”
This year’s election will give Obama yet an-
other headache, especially if Netanyahu decides to launch a preemptive attack on Iran, potentially destabilizing the region and putting Israel and the 
U.S. at risk.
Health care, one of the president’s biggest ac-
complishments, may be dealt a major blow by the 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care act, if the hearings at the U.S. Supreme Court are any indica-
tion.
The Supreme Court concluded hearing argu-
ments on Wednesday, breaking several precedents. 
The six hours of hearings over three days set off a 
flurry of speculation.
The scathing controversy surrounding the in-
dividual mandate remains the source of the bill’s 
fate. The scope of federal government oversight of commerce was challenged and skeptically held by 
Justices Scalia, Thomas and Alito.
Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kennedy re-
main on the fence, more than likely holding the de-
ciding votes on the legislation. 
If the bill is entirely thrown out, Obama will be 
dealt an enormous blow. His major legislative ac-complishment, with political capital, goodwill and effort, will be squandered.
When it comes to demographics, President 
Obama still has influence over Hispanics, African-Americans and much of his base. However, Obama has lost ground with Caucasian, blue-collar voters.
In the 2012 election, every vote will count. Even 
Obama’s large campaign war chest, which USA To-day estimated at more than $240 million, may not be enough. Crossroads GPS and other Republican super PACs will soften Obama’s formidable pur -
chasing power with their own large war chests.
It still is possible for Obama to narrowly win his 
re-election, especially when you consider the di-vided Republican nomination process and eventual battered nominee.
In any case, this election still contains a lot of un-
certainty about where the president will stand with the American electorate.
Guillermo Pradieu is an English sophomore at UF.Obama’s re-election prospects uncertainGuest column
Twenty-seven states have officially filed lawsuits against it, 
and more than half of Americans favor its repeal. Now, it is the Supreme Court’s turn to give its opinion on Obamacare 
and decide the fate of President Barack Obama’s most recognized “achievement.”
Amid all the hype, this unpopular piece of legislation might not 
even be constitutional.
Aside from the basic question of whether or not the Supreme 
Court can hear the case (based on the Anti-Injunction Act), the pri-mary question before the court is a simple one: Does the minimum-coverage provision of Obamacare exceed Congress’ power to regu-late interstate commerce?
The left will continue to cite precedents such as Wickard v. Fil-
burn and the more recent Gonzalez v . Reich as case law justification 
for the controversial legislation. Wickard, for instance, determined 
that Congress could regulate the amount of crops an individual farmer grew simply because it affected interstate commerce in the aggregate. The same precedent applied later to those cultivating and using local nonmedical marijuana (Gonzalez).
While these two cases and others expanded the latitude of Con-
gress’ interstate commerce power, they fail to align entirely with the unique nature of this particular case.
The individual mandate in question does not only permit Con-
gress to “regulate” a new area of interstate commerce, it actually forces individuals “to engage in commerce” so they can be better regulated. Once it takes effect in 2014, any individual who refuses to purchase a “government-approved level of health care” will face a financial penalty.
According to the legislation, the concept of a contract is outdat-
ed and unnecessary . Why is there any need for freedom of contract when the federal government can simply force people to enter a commercial agreement and then regulate them accordingly?
Paul Clement notes in his brief on behalf of Florida and the 
other states represented in this case: “The power to compel a per -
son to enter into an unwanted commercial relationship is not some modest step necessary and proper to perfect Congress’ authority to regulate existing government intercourse. It is a revolution in the 
relationship between the central govern-ment and the governed.”
And as we have seen in the decades 
of expansion following New Deal legis-
lation, this can be a very slippery slope, 
setting dangerous precedents for federal government power.
If you’re familiar with the Patriot Act, it becomes obvious we 
can’t ignore the fact that this legislation deals with the health and 
well-being of Americans. As Solicitor General Donald Verrill right-fully notes, “No one is more than an instant from needing health care.”
There are better (and more financially sustainable) ways of en-
suring universal health care in the U.S. Contrary to what the media 
constantly feeds us, the Republican position on Obamacare is “re-
peal and replace”— not “repeal and relax.”
From the earliest debates, Republicans have advocated a “more 
market-based” health care reform through a “defined benefits” structure. Taxpayer-supported health insurance imminently leads to “un-needy” people taking advantage of the system. This has al-ready happened to our welfare system. Do we really want it affect-ing everyone’s health care as well?
Of course, for the sake of expediency, the left ignored conser -
vative solutions during the debates and squashed all resistance as it forced the bill through the legislation process. Still today , the mainstream media refuses to acknowledge any conservative alter -
natives to Obamacare.
We have already witnessed the ridiculous arguments stemming 
from this bill’s passage.
Suddenly, free contraceptives are a human right (obviously, this 
is what the Founding Fathers must have intended with the phrase “pursuit of happiness”), and proponents treat pregnancy as if it is some sort of disease. This legislation leaves far too much room for manipulation by its beneficiaries and by the federal government.
If the Supreme Court severs the individual mandate or decides 
the entire legislation is unconstitutional, Congress will have the op-portunity to consider more effective and less imposing methods of ensuring the health of our nation’s people.
If our health care system doesn’t get fixed soon, it will be the 
cause of its own demise.

Mike Myers stood in the middle of a spa-
cious warehouse among Winnie-the-Pooh 
cake toppers, neon-colored toy soldiers and 
silver jacks. 
Myers, co-founder of the Repurpose Proj-
ect, put the used items on display as part of 
the upcycling movement.
Upcycling, which is the process of tak-
ing materials and reusing them, has recently gained popularity among some artists and eco-friendly residents.
To encourage the movement in 
Gainesville, Myers opened the doors to his nonprofit Friday at 519 S Main St. during Art Walk Gainesville.
At the Repurpose Project warehouse, art-
ists transform soda can tabs into earrings and weave cassette tapes into evening purses. 
Bookshelves were mounted to the wall 
with VHS tapes as makeshift shelves.
Myers says the artists’ inspirations make 
the Repurpose Project different from other sustainable initiatives.
“Their artwork exemplifies reuse,” he 
said.
Sarah Butz, who attended the organiza-
tion’s opening, came in to explore the ware-house during Art Walk Gainesville and says the project is different from anything she has seen.
“It’s got some really weirdo stuff, which is fabulous,” she said.
Abe Sloan, who also attended the Art 
Walk, said the building is more than just a place to sell items. It’s a place to collaborate and workshop.
She said the warehouse is an inspirational 
place.
Andrea Goodsaid, another opening at-
tendee, said she liked the idea of the upcy-
cling nonprofit.
“It’s the first one that’s caught our atten-
tion,” she said.
Myers said the purpose of the Repurpose 
Project is to educate people so they will re-think what they throw away.
Recycling has been part of his life for sev-
eral decades.
Myers got his start with reusing when 
he owned a recycling center in Fayetteville, 
Ark.
Now he helps run the Repurpose Project. 
This three-part warehouse functions as an artist workspace, an art gallery and a reuse 
art supply store.
The Gainesville community has been re-
ceptive of the project, he said. In the future, 
he wants to start up repurposing workshops 
for children to bring the movement to the 
next generation.
Angela Hoppe, a Gainesville artist, said 
the Repurpose Project’s mission is near and dear to her heart.
The project is “going out and reaching 
the public with an emphasis toward children and getting them involved,” she said.
She likes that the project is introducing 
children to various types of art.

and draw.’”Artists transform recyclables

Off-duty Gainesville Police Offi-
cer Wilfredo Perez was driving with 
his wife when they were almost hit by a Chevrolet Impala. When they pulled up beside it, a passenger in 
the back seat held up a handgun and 
chambered it.
Early Monday morning, Jamaal 
Megail Owens, 29, was arrested on charges of driving under the influ-ence and his back-seat passenger, Christopher Brandon Dortly, 25, was arrested on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon with-
out intent to kill.
Perez and his wife were driving 
west on West University Avenue at 
1:42 a.m. when Owens almost caused the collision. Owens then drove off erratically, said GPD spokeswoman Cpl. Angelina Valuri.
Both vehicles stopped for a red 
light at 22nd Street and West Uni-
versity Avenue.
Perez rolled down his wife’s win-
dow and asked if everything was all 
right, Valuri said.The passengers in the car “im-
mediately became hostile and were yelling,” she said.
Dortly held up a Hi-Point .38-
caliber semi-automatic handgun and worked the slide, as if to load a round in the chamber, police said.
Perez said he saw Dortly point the 
gun at his car. Perez’s wife screamed and Owens drove off, Valuri said.
Perez followed the car and called 
911.
Other officers stopped Owens on 
the 5200 block of 
Newberry Road. His blood-alcohol 
level was three 
times the legal limit.
Owens told 
police he drank half a cup of vod-ka at a bar with 
his brother.
Dortly told police he had a gun, 
but he denied displaying it. The gun was found near where Dortly was sitting.

  GREG LUCA
 Alligator Staff Writer
   
 Florida guard Brad Beal said Sunday night that 
he has not decided whether he will enter the NBA 
draft or return to school for his sophomore sea-son.
  Beal traveled to St. Louis on Friday to dis-
cuss his options with his family. He returned to Gainesville on Sunday night.
  The NBA’s deadline for underclassmen to de-
clare is April 29, and Beal said he plans to take the 
majority of the month to reach his decision.
  The NCAA’s deadline for an underclassman 
to declare is April 10. However, if a prospect does 
not reach a decision by April 10, he still has the 
opportunity to declare as long as he does so before 
the NBA’s April 29 deadline.
  Beal scored 14.8 points per game and grabbed a 
team-high 6.7 rebounds per game during his fresh-man season, leading scouts and analysts to project him to be selected as high as No. 3 in the upcom-
ing draft, which will be held on June 28.
  Beal’s NBA decision has been a topic of con-
versation for weeks, but he mostly avoided those 
questions during the season.
  “When that time comes after this season I’m 
going to sit down with coach and my family and

 Latroy Pittman is already making 
a name for himself in Gainesville.
  After just three months on cam-
pus, the freshman wide receiver has 
impressed coach Will Muschamp dur-ing Florida’s three weeks of spring 
practices.
  “Latroy Pittman is a guy who is re-
ally coming on and doing a nice job,” 
Muschamp said last week. “He’s still swimming a little bit mentally, which 
is to be expected, but he’s physical, 
he mixes it in well, he’s made some plays down the ﬁ  eld for us … and I’ve been very pleased with his prog-
ress to this point.”
  That progress continued into 
Florida’s weather-shortened scrim-
mage Saturday, when Muschamp said Pittman earned offensive player of the day honors. Muschamp said Pittman hauled in a deep ball from 
quarterback Jeff Driskel during the 
scrimmage despite good coverage by sophomore cornerback Loucheiz Pu-rifoy.
  As one of six early enrollees the 
Gators brought in at the beginning 
of the semester, Pitt-man has earned the most praise from 
coaches this spring, 
especially at a po-sition of need for Florida. 
Last season, the 
Gators struggled to 
establish a downﬁ  eld passing game, as the team’s wide receivers account-ed for 69 of the team’s 182 recep-
tions. 
  Only Deonte Thompson recorded  Notebook: Pittman making 
waves; Gillislee cements role
  Everyone wants to know how Brad 
Beal will be celebrating his 19th birthday. 
  The NCAA is hastily demanding to hear 
Beal’s plans by April 10. The NBA stated it can wait a little longer, until April 29. But I’m guessing all of you reading would 
probably like to learn now.
  Will Beal be ringing in another year of 
life in the Prudential Center on June 28 on-
stage at the NBA Draft or is he going to be enjoying his birthday in the simpler, less 
televised conﬁ  nes of his St. Louis home?
  Regardless of whether he chooses to re-
turn to Florida for his sophomore season or picks the cool, free draft hat and millions 
of dollars that come with a lottery pick’s rookie contract, Beal is facing a difﬁ  cult de-cision.
  Unfortunately, he only has another 26 
days to make it. 
  While the NCAA’s early entry deadline 
this year is an almost criminally unfair eight days after the national champion-
ship game, the NBA isn’t doing collegiate underclassmen any 
favors either with its April 29 cutoff date. 
  For the ﬁ  rst time 
in recent memory, Beal and other po-tential draftees will 
not have the chance 
to attend any pre-
draft workouts with NBA teams or gauge the interest of front ofﬁ  ces man-to-man.
  Just three years ago, college players were 
able to remove their names off the early en-try list a week before the NBA Draft. Now, they have to make a concrete decision al-
most two months in advance, leaving es-
sentially no time to test the proverbial draft waters. 
  The new deadlines are rigged even more 
than last year’s May 8 date to beneﬁ  t the 
NCAA’s future on-court product as well 
as college coaches, who will get an earlier handle on how their rosters will look next  Early entry deadline should 
put players’ priorities ﬁ  rst

Florida junior guard Kenny Boynton shoots over Louisville’s Chane Behanan during the Elite 
Eight. Boynton said Monday he is unsure if he will return for his senior season. 
Boynton also undecided; 
Young, Rosario returning
we’re just going to talk about it,” Beal 
said March 23, the day before UF’s Elite Eight game against Louisville.
Even after the Gators fell 72-68 to end 
the season just short of the Final Four, Beal was mum on his future plans.
“I’m still just affected by this loss,” 
Beal said on March 24. “I’m not think-ing about next season yet.”
Junior Kenny Boynton is still mull-
ing over his decision, while junior Mike Rosario and sophomore Patric Young have both announced their intent to re-
turn, according to a UF release. 
Young averaged 10.2 points and 6.4 
rebounds per game this year and is pro-
jected as a late first-round pick because of his size — 6-foot-9, 247 pounds — and athleticism. 
Boynton led the team in scoring at 
15.9 points per game and would like-ly be drafted at the end of the second 
round, if at all. 
Rosario scored 6.6 points per game off the bench this season and probably 
would have had to find a spot on a ros-ter overseas. 
If Florida were to return all of its un-
derclassmen, the Gators would likely 
be a consensus preseason top-five team. 
Erving Walker was UF’s only senior, and his departure figures to be mitigat-ed by incoming freshman guards Brax-
ton Ogbueze, Michael Frazier and Dillon Graham. 
Of teams that 
reached the Elite 
Eight, only Kentucky, 
Ohio State and North 
Carolina also had just 
one senior playing significant minutes. 
However, all three of those schools proj-ect to lose underclassmen to the draft, with North Carolina’s Harrison Barnes, Kendall Marshall and John Henson al-ready declaring.

season. 
According to NCAA Proposal No. 2010-24, the rule 
“is intended to help keep student-athletes focused on 
academics in the spring term and to give coaches a better 
idea of their roster for the coming year before the recruit-ing period is closed.”
Some coaches like Kentucky’s John Calipari have made 
their opinion on the NCAA-first, player-last mentality of the rule perfectly clear.“It’s the dumbest thing ever,” Calipari told ESPN.com. 
“It’s stupid. If this is about the kids, then that’s the last thing this is about.”
After returning to Gainesville from a trip home to St. 
Louis, Beal stated Sunday night that he intended to take 
the majority of the month to make his decision. 
In the intermittent period between now and April 29 
at 11:59 p.m., he’ll probably discuss again his future with 
the Gators with coach Billy Donovan, who of course had 
his own publicized flirtation with the NBA’s Orlando 
Magic in 2007.Donovan’s return to the college ranks at Florida came 
a little more than a week after he agreed to on a five-year $27 million contract to become the Magic’s new coach 
on May 31, 2007. After testing the NBA coaching waters, 
Donovan was released from his contract on June 6, 2007. 
Why is it so difficult to imagine a college player getting 
even a shred of the same courtesy anytime soon? 
Because whether it’s Florida, an NBA team, agents or 
fans, everyone wants to know as soon as possible what they’ll be getting on Beal’s birthday come June 28. 
Contact John Boothe at jboothe@alligator.org.BOOTHE , from page 13Muschamp says quarterback battle to continue past spring
more than 20 catches, and the 
unit hauled in just seven touch-downs on the season. 
So far this spring, Muschamp 
has been pleased with the down-field ability and overall skill set the 6-foot, 201-pound Pittman has 
brought to the offense, saying the 
freshman is “passing some guys” on the depth chart.
“He understands every-down 
performance, blocking and doing 
things you got to do to be suc-
cessful, and reading coverages and seeing coverages,” Mus-champ said. 
“He goes out and makes 
plays.”
Gillislee locked in: Last week 
Muschamp said running back Mike Gillislee was on pace to 
shore up the No. 1 spot in Flori-
da’s backfield next season. 
Monday morning, the Gators 
coach said Gillislee has all but 
locked up the job.
“Mike has distanced himself 
to be that guy,” Muschamp said. 
Given Gillislee’s history of in-
juries during his time at Florida, Muschamp cautioned that the 
Gators need to establish depth behind the senior. As a result, Gillislee’s touches 
will be limited during the last week of spring practice, while 
the likes of Omarius Hines, Mack 
Brown, Trey Burton and Hunter Joyer see more snaps out of the backfield.
“We need to start creating 
some separation there because 
when you get in the season those 
reps, practice reps become hard for everybody to get,” Muschamp said.
Quarterback update: As 
Driskel and Jacoby Brissett con-tinue to battle for the starting quarterback role, Muschamp said 
Monday there still has not been any separation between the two 
sophomores.
According to Muschamp, both 
have done a good job of manag-ing the offense in practice, and he doesn’t believe he will name a starter at the end of spring prac-tice.
“We’re going to go into the fall 
camp,” Muschamp said. 
“That, to me, is becoming 
more and more evident every day that they’re both guys we can win with. Bottom line, that’s good for us.” 
Injury report: Wide receiv-
ers Stephen Alli (groin), Solo-mon Patton (groin) and Ja’Juan Story (ankle) were all expected to return to practice Monday af-
ter missing much of the last two 
weeks, Muschamp said.

Don’t blame Vickash Ramjit for Flor -
ida’s bats slumping since Southeastern 
Conference play began. 
After beginning the season looking for 
a way to squeeze into the UF lineup, the junior from Miami is becoming a regular for unforeseen reasons, and the Gators 
aren’t complaining. 
“It’s good to get Vickash out there,” 
Florida coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “He 
was waiting patiently. I’m sure it was not easy for him the first 20 games of the 
year.”
Until the Gators’ trip to South Carolina 
on March 22, Ramjit was 
little more than a late-game substitution at first 
base — another talented casualty of No. 1 Flori-da’s (24-4, 6-3 SEC) pros-pect surplus. But heading 
into tonight’s road game 
against North Florida 
(17-13, 2-7 Atlantic Sun), Ramjit, who is on an offensive tear, should once again be penciled in as the starting left fielder. 
When senior center fielder Tyler Thomp-
son suffered a torn ACL against Vander -
bilt on March 16, O’Sullivan was confident that freshman Justin Shafer could handle starting in left with senior Daniel Pigott shifting to center. That was until Shafer committed two errors in as many games and was subsequently benched. On a Friday in Columbia, S.C., Ramjit 
got his chance.
“I had an idea (I could play left field), but I really didn’t think it would happen,” 
he said. “Coach prepared me for out there. 
He was wanting me to get out there and take [reps] when I thought I would be at first.”
When third baseman Josh Tobias frac-
tured his hamate bone in his hand on March 23 against South Carolina, Ramjit took his spot in the eight-hole and promptly went 3 for 4 with two solo home runs. O’Sullivan 
started him again the next day, saying he 
would be “crazy” not to. Ramjit went 0 for 3 with a walk but has hit .438 in the four games since. He has added another home 
run and six more RBI in those games. 
“It felt good to contribute a lot,” Ramjit 
said after a two-RBI outing against No. 2 
Florida State. “I’m pretty comfortable.” 
A Miami transfer, Ramjit had never 
played outfield for the Gators before this current stretch. He started 19 games for Florida in 2011 (14 at first base) and hit .382 but never displayed the pop he 
showed during preseason scrimmages this 
year. O’Sullivan wanted to find ways to get him on the field, but the opportunities were seldom until the string of injuries oc-curred.
Before the South Carolina series, Ramjit 
had recorded one start and was hitting .111 (1 for 9). 
“Sometimes it doesn’t always go the 
way you want it to, but you just keep grinding it out and you keep working hard,” O’Sullivan said. “When your op-portunity comes, you’ve got to be ready, and he has certainly done that for us.”TUESDAY, APRIL 3, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Whenever Ashanée Dickerson steps onto the 
floor, steadies her body on the balance beam or 
swings from the uneven bars, her effort is 100 per -
cent. 
But unfortunately for the junior all-around com-
petitor, the scores she receives do not always match her intensity. 
While Dickerson has bounced back considerably 
this year from a sophomore slump, her scores have lacked consistency. 
In nine meets competing in all-around, she has 
four totals of at least 39.575, but four lower than or 
equal to 39.275. 
“She’s human and she’s been for the whole sea-
son lights out as an all-arounder,” coach Rhonda 
Faehn said. 
“We don’t expect the athlete to hold that every 
single competition.” 
At the Southeastern Conference Championships 
on March 24, Dickerson had an up-and-down af-ternoon, posting a 39.20 to place 11th out of 17 all-
around competitors. 
Beginning her competition on beam, she wob-
bled on her series and took a step on her dismount 
after trying to move too fast. On floor exercise, she 
struggled with finding the right timing. 
Dickerson tallied a 9.775 on both events. 
“The floor itself, I’m not making excuses for 
anybody, but it seemed like everybody had trouble adjusting to the floor a little bit,” Faehn said. “Our 
athletes were working it too hard and then realized 
it, so then [Dickerson] went easier on the last pass and came up a little short.”
After resting during Florida’s second bye period, 
Dickerson recorded a 9.9 on vault to help the Gators make a furious rally to the top of the leaderboard. Although she took a hop back on her landing, she said it was much better than taking an extra step.  
“I just kind of did what I usually do in practice 
on vault,” Dickerson said. “What we’ve been work-ing on is trying as hard as we could to get the land-ing.”
She struggled on bars to close out the competi-
tion, scoring a 9.75 after hitting her foot on the bar 
before taking a step on her dismount. Despite the 
low score, Faehn said she was impressed with Dick-erson’s bars routine.
“She went too hard for the stick, so she came up 
short because she opened it up a little early,” Faehn said. “But her handstands were the best she’s done all year. She’s done a great job working on her ex-ecution and getting her handstands up.”
When No. 1 Florida heads to Raleigh, N.C., for 
the NCAA Regional this Saturday, Dickerson will look to avenge her dismal performance at regionals last year.  
She posted a career-best 39.70 to win the all-
around title by a margin of .25 points at the 2010 regionals, but the following season she stumbled on beam (8.475) to record a collegiate-worst 38.
“She always wants to be able to do the absolute 
best,” Faehn said. 
“She’s going to come back and work on the little 
mistakes here and there. She continually strives 
each day in practice to try and get better.”Dickerson searching for consistency
“I just kind of did what I usually do in 
practice on vault. What we’ve been working 
on is trying as hard as we could to get the 
landing.”

PREVIEWING THE ORANGE AND BLUE DEBUT
With the Gators’ annual spring game, the Orange and Blue Debut, scheduled for this Saturday, we at alligatorSports want to get you prepared. Each day this week, we will 
give you a new piece from three separate top-five lists: something to look for during the spring game, an area the team must improve upon in 2012 and a major storyline to follow as the spring season comes to a close. Today, we look at the offense under new coordinator Brent Pease, the inside run game and the A.C. Leonard situation.
� SOMETHING TO LOOK FOR DURING SATURDAY’S GAME:
        4. Brent Pease’s new offense
While the offensive gameplan for the spring game is 
generally very vanilla, Florida is in a unique situation this season in that there isn’t much settled on that side of the ball, meaning there is plenty of work to be done in a simulated game environment. Both sophomore 
quarterbacks need plenty of reps and the same can be said for the inexperi-enced stable of running backs. There isn’t a proven receiver in the bunch, and there’s still several newcomers to work into the fold. Plus, the Gators need all the time they can get to adjust to Pease and his new wrinkles, as the first-year offensive coordinator has 
said that he plans to utilize in UF’s offense the motion and misdirection that made Boise State so success-ful. While much of the playbook hasn’t changed and Pease isn’t reinventing the wheel, Florida’s players have plenty to adjust to in terms of pre-snap reads and motions. During Saturday’s game, look to seehow much Pease and the Gators actually show, and how cleanly the offense executes. Last season, the offense didn’t inspire much confidence in that regard, and things are only getting more difficult this year.� AREA THAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:
                4. The inside run game
We know you have heard it a million times already, but Florida must find a way to run the ball successfully this season without its two best backs from a year ago. While the departures of Jeff Demps and Chris Rainey obviously leave a gaping hole in terms of production, 
the Gators’ run game could actually im-prove through addition by subtraction. For all their talent, Demps and Rainey struggled running the ball between the tackles, especially against the top teams in the Southeastern Conference.In six losses, Florida averaged 61.8 rushing yards per game (76.5) and was out-gained in all but one. Based purely 
on measurables, Mike Gillislee, Mack Brown, Omarius Hines and incoming freshman Matt Jones all possess greater straight-ahead ability than Demps or Rainey. The offensive line has been a focus of increased physicality, and well, girth, which should theoretically help open holes in the run game. With either Jacoby Brissett or Jeff Driskel leading the offense, the Gators will need all the help they can get from the run game.

� STORYLINE TO WATCH:
    4. A.C. Leonard and The Florida Way
Will Muschamp made a big fuss in his intro -
ductory press conference about cleaning up 
the program he inherited. Under Urban Meyer, Florida developed a reputation for fostering a criminal atmosphere and failing to punish wrong-
doers. Muschamp made waves initially with the dismissal of Janoris Jenkins and the shoo -
ing out of several others who were clearly up to no good, but now he’s faced with his first real pickle. Leonard was arrested in February after an allegedly brutal fight with his girlfriend and 
he was officially charged with battery last week. Muschamp hardly had anything to say at the time of the arrest, releasing a statement through the university, saying, “This behavior will not be tolerated.” Leonard was suspended at the time, but he has since returned to practice and could play Saturday in the spring game. Muschamp has said that Leonard is not out of the woods yet and still has to earn his spot back, but is that really enough?
