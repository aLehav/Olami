Expectations for the Inter-Resi-
dence Hall Association's water bal-
loon fight were deflated Saturday
when gloomy weather botched a
Guinness World Record attempt.
Though the sun came out just in
time for the event, gloomy weath-
er earlier in the day led to a turn-
out of 681 people rather than the
hoped-for crowd of 5,000, which
would have broken a Guinness
World Record.
Organizers of the balloon
fight hoped to raise $5,000 for the
American Cancer Society's Mak-
ing Strides Against Breast Cancer
walk, from which proceeds are
donated to advance breast cancer
research.
Saturday's water balloon fight
and a silent auction at the event
raised $2,653.99.ets loss
IRHA spent about $3,000 on the
event and has been advertising the
fight for about five months, said
Natalie Hyman, the event direc-
tor.
"It was very unfortunate that
the weather was the way it was,
but we raised a lot of money and
that was our
goal," Hyman
said.
Volunteers
filled 50,812
water balloons,
falling short of
the 140,000 goal,
Hyman according to Hy-
man.
Amanda Brown, one of the bal-
lon fight's setup directors, said or-
ganizers were filling balloons up
until just a few hours before the
water balloon fight began.
Other volunteers were up all
night Friday setting up plastic
sheeting so the balloons could be
easily counted and placed on the
field.

ZOMBACALYPSE
Zombies take out humans
ANDREW WYZAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
About 20 human survivors rallied for a last
stand on Hume Field Sunday. They gathered in
a tight circle, brandishing their guns. More than
400 zombies advanced. The survivors were
overwhelmed.
This was the final act of Humans vs. Zom-
bies, a four-day game that began at midnight
Thursday.
The game originated in 2005 at Goucher Col-
lege in Baltimore and has since spread to college
campuses nationwide.
About 470 students participated in UF's first
game.
During Humans vs. Zombies, humans, who
wear bandannas around their arms, use Nerf
guns and balled-up socks to stun zombies for
15 minutes. Zombies, who move the bandanna
onto their heads upon transformation, use noweapons and tag humans to turn them into
zombies.
UF freshman Jesse Schmitt brought the
game to UF. He created an official club, Gators
Humans vs. Zombies.
Finding players was easy.
"I've been a fan of zombies since I
was 15."
Alec Fufidlo
UF freshman
In a week, more than 400 people registered
to play after hearing about the game through
Facebook and word-of-mouth, Schmitt said.
"It shows the power of the Internet," Schmitt
said.

After an 8.8-magnitude earthquake
struck 200 miles southwest of Santia-
go, Chile, early Saturday morning, UF
has contacted a student in Chile and
is taking measures to provide relief for
the catastrophe.
UF's International Center executive
director Susanne Hill said one student
is in Santiago. The two have been in e-
mail contact and the student is OK.
One study abroad program in San-
tiago is scheduled for Summer A, but
the International Center will monitor
Chile's situation to decide if the pro-
gram will remain open, Hill wrote.UF spokesman Steve Orlando said
the Office of Student Activities is not
yet aware of any organized relief ef-
forts at UF, but they will meet Mon-
day and reach out to presidents of UF
clubs representing South American
students.International Sky Georges,News president of
Gators United
for Haiti, said he's interested to deter-
mine how they can approach Chile's
situation in addition to Haiti's.
"Raising money for Haiti is a lot
harder than I thought it was going to
be," he said. "But I'd love to gather stu-
dents who are interested to see if we
can help."

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
Both SG parties found guilty of campaign violations
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Writer
Whether it was leaving campaign
fliers unattended or leaving them on
cars in non-solicitation zones, both
the Unite Party and the Student Al-
liance party were found guilty of il-
legal campaign practices.
Of the 21 election complaints
filed during or after the spring Stu-
dent Government election, nine
were dropped during Friday's elec-
tion commission meeting.
The Unite Party received a publicreprimand for leaving campaign fli-
ers unattended.
The Student Alliance party was
found guilty of campaigning in non-
solicitation zones and leaving fliers
on cars in apartment complexes.
Unite Party President James Ty-
ger filed against the Student Alliance
party candidates for leaving fliers in
off-campus apartment complexes.
After testimony from three wit-
nesses, the Student Alliance party
was found guilty and fined $50.
A complaint was also filed
against the Student Alliance partyfor campaigning door-to-door in off-
campus apartment complexes.
The election
comnissionvoted
that door-to-door
campaigning is
not illegal and
said it will rec-
ommend that the
Student Senate
Ossip make legislation
concerning off-
campus campaigning more clear.
The Unite Party was fined $20 to-
tal for four complaints about mem-bers writing the party's slogan in
chalk across campus.
Student Alliance party Senate
Leader Jonathan Ossip said univer-
sity regulations prohibit writing in
chalk anywhere but the southwest
terrace of the Reitz Union.
"There needs to be a clear mes-
sage that SG parties are subject to
the same rules as everyone else on
campus," Ossip said.
The Unite Party was found not
guilty of submitting a letter to the
editor of the Alligator under the
name of Josh Winegar, who had noaffiliation with the party.
The commission also found the
Unite Party not guilty of covering
Student Alliance party posters with
Renew Your Reitz campaign posters
and Unite Party posters.
Election Commission chair An-
drew Brown said the Unite Party
did not destroy any Student Alliance
party campaign materials and that
both parties were probably guilty of
covering over the other's posters.
"Two wrongs don't make a right,
and it seems that both parties are at
fault at this point," Brown said.
Speakers discuss shift to Internet at Music Law Conference
The Grooveshark co-founder was the keynote speaker
By JENNIFER COLEMAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Facebook isn't just a classroom distraction.
The group of about 130 people who gath-
ered at the Music Law Conference at the UF
Levin College of Law Saturday and Sunday
learned about how musicians use the site to
promote themselves and their music.
Students, musicians, lawyers, policymak-
ers and entertainment professionals attended
the eighth annual conference, which focused
on the implications of the music industry's
shift to digital media and the Internet and dis-cussed the legal aspects of music licensing.
Ravi Hutheesing, a former guitarist for
Hanson who participated in a panel discus-
sion about musicians' use of social media, said
he uses his Web site and Facebook to market
himself.
He said he separates himself from other
artists by posting his opinions about health
care and other issues on his Web sites.
The keynote speaker of the event was Josh
Greenberg, the co-founder and chief tech-
nology officer of Grooveshark, a legal music
search engine and streaming service on the In-
ternet. Greenberg explained his goal of mak-ing Grooveshark the "YouTube of music" and
highlighted the history of lawsuits over illegal
downloads.
He said 46 percent of people who have pre-
viously pirated music do not continue to do so
after using Grooveshark.
On Ryan Backman, an advertis-Campus ing sophomore, plays the piano
for The Cruz, a band in Tampa,
and sings for his solo work in Gainesville.
After the conference, he said he realized
the definition of making music has changed
because musicians in the digital age can be
successful without singing on the radio orwinning a Grammy Award.
The only way to gain recognition in the
past was through the radio, he said.
The event continued Saturday night with a
cocktail party at Lux Bar featuring singer Nan-
cy Harmon and ended with a concert show-
case at the music venue Common Grounds
beginning at 9 p.m.
The bands Boss Lady and The Company,
Hoyt and the Hotheads, Dinger Does It and
Stevie D and the No Shows performed at the
showcase for a crowd of more than 100 people,
said Sal Picataggio, a second-year law student
and the showcase director.
He said the funds from the concert were
used toward the venue and the bands.

Show helps fund hall
By SAMANTHA DELGADO
Alligator Contributing Writer
The 500 people who gathered at
Santa Fe College Friday and Satur-
day night for the third annual Stars
Night Out benefit were celebrating
more than the arts.
The college is in the process of
building a new auditorium.
"This is the last time these stu-
dents will perform in this program
on this stage," said Mike Curry, a
member of the Santa Fe College
Foundation.
The 17 acts included a pointe
dance routine, a monologue and an
ensemble by the SFC jazz band.
Cameron Francis, an illusionist,
performed a card trick. He said the
theme of his act, like the show in its
entirety, was embracing the past
and looking forward to the future.
Proceeds from ticket sales ben-
efited the fine arts department, ac-cording to David Hackett, SFC Col-
lege Relations spokesman. Tickets
ranged from $15 to $25, but en-
trance was free for SFC students.
"This is the last time these
students will perform
in this program on this
sta ge."
Mike Curry
member of the Santa Fe College
Foundation
Jose Piieiro, a freshman tenor
saxophone player, said the new
Fine Arts Hall will be ground-
breaking.
"It's bringing us to a new level,"
Pinieiro said.
The new facility is scheduled to
open in the spring of 2011 and will
cost $17.2 million. The amount of
money raised by the event was not
available at press time.Car show offers blast from past
-MORE THAN 400 PEOPLE
ATTENDED.
By MATT HARRINGER
Alligator Writer
Visitors to the Alachua County Fairgrounds
passed through the ticket booth and stepped back
in time to the 1950s Saturday at the Billetproof Hot
Rod and Custom Car Show in Gainesville.
Clad in Converse sneakers and leather jack-
ets, more than 400 car enthusiasts traveled from
across the Southeast for one reason: to worship
the hot rod.
The show was for traditional-style cars from
the '50s, '60s and earlier.
There are five Billetproof hot rod shows across
the country ever year, from Washington to Flor-
ida.
Last year's Florida show was held at Don Gar-
lits Museum of Drag Racing in Ocala, but Alan
Galbraith, owner of Billetproof, said this year's
show moved to the fairgrounds for more space.
Marty Backand, a retired auto body technician,
brought his 1933 Ford three-window coupe to
the show. The 77-year-old car has been restored
to look new. Its sleek black finish is accented by
large exhaust pipes leading from the engine outthe side of the hood -a classic hot rod feature.
The front axel is exposed under a giant chrome
grill and large chrome-encased headlights.
Backand said he was proud he drove the car to
Gainesville from Weeki Wachee, Fla. -some of
the other hot rods arrived on trailers.
Leaning on his car, Backand said he enjoyed
talking with the spectators who came to admire
the hot rod's bodywork.
Galbraith said Billetproof enthusiasts fall into
two crowds: They're either over 60 or under 30.
Backand said he was one of
Around the older-than-60 hot-rod lov-Gainesville ers.
"The alternative-type peo-
ple," he said speaking of those under 30, "they
dress older than me."
One of those "alterative-type" people was
Megan Todd, a 21-year-old cosmetologist from
Gainesville.
"They don't make them like they used to," she
said, referring to the hot rods at the car show.
Todd was dressed like Sandy from "Grease,"
except with a nose ring and gauges in her ears.
She described her style as '50s era with an influ-
ence of modern punk.
"We like the retro lifestyle," She said. "It's rock
'n' roll."

Celebration wraps up
Black History Month
By MINCH MINCHIN
Alligator Writer
The end of UF's Black History
Month celebration Sunday night
also marked the end of Betty J. Full-
wood's 32-year career at UF.
The closing ceremony of Black
History Month included a tribute
to Fullwood, the former director of
the Office for Academic Support
and Institutional Services for the UF
College of Liberal Arts and Scienc-
es, during a ceremony in the Reitz
Union Rion Ballroom.
In the event's closing speech, Full-
wood, an award-winning author,
counselor and professor, encour-
aged the crowd of more than 200 to
never give up on their dreams.
Getting through UF can be diffi-
cult, she said, recalling stories of her
bad grades as an undergraduate.
But once students have endured
organic chemistry and differential
equations, they are better prepared
to face challenges outside the class-
room, even if their classes do not
directly correspond to their jobs,
Fullwood said."Nobody's going to ask you to
find the square root of anything
when you get out of school," she
said, pausing for applause.
UF graduates should be proud of
their accomplishment because they
have endured one of the most pres-
tigious schools in America, she said.
"If you can make it here, you can
make it anywhere because
this is worse than New
York," Fullwood said.
"[The program]
was bittersweet,"
said Talia Cadet, the
director of special
events for UF
Black Histo-
Black History ry Month's
Month Executive
Board. "We
were honored to give her
the recognition she deserves."
After the speech, students gave
Fullwood a standing ovation.
Laurel Alcenat, a sociology soph-
omore, said Fullwood's speech in-
spired her to stay motivated.
"I thought she was talking to
me," Alcenat said.
UF CLUBS
Beast Feast draws 200 into forest to taste zebra, caribou
ByCJ PRUNER
Alligator Staff Writer
Tucked two miles deep in the
Austin Cary Memorial Forest,
Saturday night's Beast Feast had
all the ingredients of a good old-
fashioned dinner: iguana stew,
elk spaghetti and python 6touf-
f6e.
The 27th annual Beast Feast,
sponsored by the UF chapter
of the Wildlife Society, gave
Gainesville residents an all-you-
can-eat opportunity to dine on
dishes not served at traditional
restaurants.
About 200 people showed upto sample dishes including white-
tailed deer chili, buffalo fajitas,
caribou pot roast and raccoon,
said Danielle Abbey, UF Wildlife
Society president.
For dessert, guests dined on
delicacies such as mealworm
brownies and cricket cake.
"I keep pulling cricket legs out
of my teeth, which is weird," one
diner said.
The event raised about $2,000
from tickets, which were $15 at
the door. Proceeds from the event
go toward funding the group's
trips to national and state confer-
ences.
"It's about trying something"I'm completely comfort-
able with this stuff. People
eat this stuff in other
parts of the world. I think
it would be interesting to
tell someone you've eaten
zebra."
Blaine Holmberg
UF food science graduate
new," Abbey said.
Emily Williams, the club's
vice president who organized the
event, said the group collected
about 550 pounds of meat fromprivate donors since September
for the dinner.
"People are excited that it's
not your typical beef and chicken
at the grocery store," Williams
said.
Blaine Holmberg and Tony
Malara, two UF students who
came out for the Beast Feast
Saturday, scraped their dishes
clean.
"I'm completely comfortable
with this stuff," said Holmberg, a
UF food science graduate student
who had gator tail and deer lasa-
gna on his plate.
"People eat this stuff in oth-
er parts of the world. I think itwould be interesting to tell some-
one you've eaten zebra," Holm-
berg said.
Malara added, "I'm doing a
whole lot of chewing."
Although the menu was main-
ly composed of meat selections,
Abbey said her group has non-
meat eaters and that herbivores
were more than welcome at the
feast.
"Some of us are vegan, some
of us are halfway and some of us
are hunters and fishers," Abbey
said.
But Malara disagreed.
"This would be a vegetarian's
worst nightmare," he said.

The Reitz Thing
SG should listen to
student votes
e know Student Government likes to think of it-
self as a real government, and with its $14.4 mil-
lion budget we can see the argument. But now
it's time for SG to remember the No. 1 lesson of democ-
racy: When the voters speak, you listen.
In last week's elections, 55 percent of students voted
against a new fee that would cover an expansion of the Re-
itz Union. The fair thing for SG to do is to listen to the vot-
ers, who would be funding the expansion with increased
fees that wouldn't be covered by Bright Futures.
But that referendum was non-binding, meaning it was
essentially an opinion poll, not something that has to be
heeded.
With tuition continuing to rise and scholarships, like
Bright Futures, covering less of the cost of college, students
shouldn't be forced to spend an extra $20 per semester and
$3 per credit hour for something they have expressed little
interest in having.
Just because it would be the fair thing to do, however,
doesn't necessarily mean SG will do it. It would not at all
be out of character for them to go ahead with the fee and
the Reitz expansion anyway.
In the fall 2008 elections, students voted overwhelm-
ingly to reject a referendum to install hand scanners at the
UF gyms. And by overwhelmingly, we mean with 84 per-
cent of the vote.
But SG and management at the UF gyms pressed on
with the hand scanner idea until the spring 2009 elections,
when senators put an initiative on the ballot, which, unlike
referendums, is binding.
That time, students again voted against the hand scan-
ners, and the idea was scrapped.
SG leaders would be wise not to repeat that mistake.
They need to remember where that $14 million budget
they have to play with comes from -the students' pock-
ets. If they want to represent the Student Body, they need
to listen when it speaks, and it spoke in last week's elec-
tions.
This doesn't mean that the repair and expansion of the
Reitz is a bad idea. We're all for that. But if SG wants to
make the upgrades, it should find other funding to do so.
In addition to the fee, SG planned on securing funds
from the administration and from the Capital Improve-
ment Trust Fund, to which all Florida public university
students contribute through fees.
SG also wants to solicit donations from alumni for the
improvements, which is a great idea. And maybe after we
graduate we will choose to contribute. But for now, the
students have expressed their desire to not fund the proj-
ect. And for those students who voted "yes" to the fee,
we're sure they are more than welcome to give a donation
of their own, too.
We're all for the proposed renovations and upgrades at
the Reitz. Especially the part about getting rid of asbestos,
because that's gross. But not if it's funded by a fee the stu-
dents have voted against.
SG does have one more course of action if it wants to
get students to fund the project: include bringing Wendy's
back as part of the plan. We would gladly pay $20 per se-
mester and $3 per credit for that.

Our generation too
ast Thursday, just when I was about to align my-
self with the Editorial Board's defense against elder
generations' grumblings about the lay of the 21st
century land, I stumbled upon a preview of the American
Psychiatric Association's DSM-5, or the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Now, I'm stand-
ing with our Golden Folks on their side of the issue, al-
though their stance in this matter has less to do with our
generation's intelligence and more to do with society's
ever-flaccidifying grit.
Case in point: Sluggish Cognitive Tempo Disorder, symp-
toms of which include sluggishness, passiveness and dream-
iness. Yes, we have officially diagnosed laziness, and it's en-
demic. Based on those symptoms, I'm going out on a limb
and guessing the lifetime prevalence for SCTD is around,
say, 100 percent for any and every population.
My initial reaction wasn't so much absurdity-spurred
rage as it was perplexing disappointment: This disorder has
already been identified; it's called the "itis." Anyone who has
survived the gastronomic onslaught of Thanksgiving dinner
has experienced the mind-numbing, motor function-inhibit-
ing, couch-relegating symptoms of this disorder. In fact, I'm
currently typing with one finger, half-conscious, in the midst
of a dairy-induced near-coma after having powered through
a pint of Karamel Sutra ice cream topped with Cheez-Its.
Among the other new revisions to the manual, some
gems include Intermittent Explosive Disorder, which is not
in fact the reason for Depends, but rather a clinical euphe-
mism for "losing it;" hypersexuality, which is basically mak-
ing the fulfillment of one's sexual fantasies or urges the focal
point of one's life; absexuality, which can be described as be-
ing turned on by getting turned off (mull that one over for a
while); and Cannabis Withdrawal, the symptoms of which
are always chronic (because it's weed).
It's commonplace to hear the DSM referred to as the
psychiatrist's Bible, which I've thought to be too cutesy of aquick to diagnose
description for my tastes in the past.
However, in light of some of these
frivolous proposals, it might be ap-
propriate, as it has adopted the same
kind of blindly promising, duct-tape-
solution type of reasoning usually re-
Ryan Spencer served for Sundays (or Saturdays or
letters@alligator org Fridays).
The DSM is exposed to the same
subjective formulation, interpretation
and application as its colloquial namesake. The notion that
the complexities of mental dysfunction (and even concepts
of normality vs. abnormality) cannot only be compartmen-
talized, but done so with interwoven characteristics that can
function as much to mislead as reveal, is substantiation of
people's desire to succinctly explain the insoluble being at
odds with their inability to do so. No matter how much revi-
sion, tweaking or overhauling is done to the DSM, it can by
no means produce an objective insight into the human condi-
tion, as the function the manual is limited to, descriptive as-
sessment, fundamentally excludes the cause of the problem.
In this very way, the manual, like the books it's associated
with, can be considered as much a testament to our collec-
tive ignorance as anything else. Such an account is not nec-
essarily a bad thing, and indeed it has been instrumental in
providing effective treatment to many, but from such success
emerges our label-happy, pill-reverent zeitgeist, which is as
precarious as medication is efficacious.
With our solutions so concise as to be measured by the
milligram and so narrow as to miss the mark and simply dull
the iniquities, it's not all that unlike good old fashioned re-
pression, except now we've taken all the work out of it. So,
the next time you hit snooze instead of going to class, don't
pass the buck to SCTD. As Grandpa might say, you're just
f-ing lazy.

Guest column
The case for urban agricultureI n his State of the Union address, President
[Obama enumerated ongoing problems re-
quiring his attention: health care, the econo-
my, job creation, environmental issues and lack
of renewable fuels. In doing so, he suggested
that increasing agricultural exports would help
solve some of these problems.
While export agriculture might indeed help
some corporations, it is unlikely to resolve is-
sues directly affecting the public. One thing that
would, however, is urban agriculture. While not
a panacea, urban agriculture can allay many of
the concerns mentioned by the president, and it
can do so in several critical ways.
The United States is now undeniably urban.
According to recent demographics, 81 percent
of Americans now live in cities or suburbs. And
with so few living on farms or in rural areas, our
familiarity with the production and source of
our food is limited. As an urban organic farmer,
I find it amazing that so many chefs, produce
managers, restaurateurs and Americans in gen-K. Rashid Nuri eral remain blithely un-
Spea kingOut aware of the sources of
their food. Many have
no idea what food looks
like coming out of the soil, let alone have an
awareness of seasonal fluctuations in fruit and
vegetable production.
Since the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s and the
end of World War II, there has been an effort by
government and corporate America to industri-
alize American agriculture. There has been an
emphasis on efficiency and quantity rather than
on growing quality food and protecting natural
resources. Agriculture is estimated to represent
about 20 to 25 percent of the U.S. annual energy
budget, and as much as 40 percent of that energy
goes toward production of artificial fertilizers
and pesticides.
The time has come for Americans to reclaim
their agricultural heritage. Participating in ur-
ban agriculture would be a major step in that
direction.Letters to the Editor
Columnist should apologize or be fired
I am shocked and saddened that a
publication that claims to be as progres-
sive and tolerant as the Alligator would
publish Paul Murty's vile and hate-filled
rant Friday about a group of Americans
exercising their constitutional right of as-
sembly, the Conservative Political Action
Conference.
Does Paul Murty hate America, or just
the Constitution? The most offensive and
degrading part of Mr. Murty's hate speech
was his use of the word "crazy" to describe
his fellow Americans. There are millions
of people with various kinds of mental ill-
nesses, and Mr. Murty's use of this disgust-
ing slur degrades them all.
Mr. Murty obviously has no consider-
ation for the thoughts and feelings of those
who struggle every day with mental ill-
ness and the friends and family members
who help them through this debilitating
condition. I demand that Mr. Murty issue
an apology, and if he refuses (like a true
bigot would), he should be fired. This is
Obama's America, and you can't just say
whatever you want anymore. Anyone
who disagrees with me is a racist.

SG dictatorship no longer possible
Student Body President Jordan Johnson
shows contempt for democracy. On
Thursday morning, the lame-duck presi-
dent asked the UF Board of Trustees to
move forward with creating a new tuition
fee to fund an unnecessary expansion of
the Reitz Union, ignoring the will of the
majority of students who voted against
such a fee in last week's election.
It seems Mr. Johnson and his Unite
Party think that losing by "only" about 10
percent of the vote represents a "big win"
for their pro-fee campaign (which, inciden-
tally, was funded by a blatant misappro-
priation of public funds).I have two questions for Mr. John-
son: Who do you think you are? What on
Earth do you think gives you the right to
simply ignore the more than 5,000 stu-
dents who voted against this fee -the
same students you supposedly represent?
As much as you might wish otherwise, Mr.
Johnson, SG is still a democracy, and the
students have spoken.
You might be used to wielding the iron
fist of a single-party tyranny, but with the
StudentAllianceparty'sunprecedentedwin
of20Senateseatslastweek,theUnite Party's
years of unchecked hegemony are nearing
an end. Continuing to pretend you're some
kind of Student Body dictator will only
earn your party an even hastier demise.
Graham Clark
CLAS Senator-e/ect (Student Alliance party)
Fee campaigners show hypocrisy
Despite 56 percent opposition to a new
fee, Student Body President Jordan John-
son and Alex Cornillie, the Renew Your
Reitz campaign spokesman, say that the
issue of a fee to pay for Reitz Union expan-
sion is not off the table.
One of the reasons given is that "the
vote may not represent the will of the en-
tire student body." However disappoint-
ing a turnout of 10,000 students may be to
Johnson and Cornillie, these are mostly the
same students who elected Johnson. If Cor-
nillie really thinks that election results can
be disregarded because a majority of non-
voting students would have supported his
position, then I question his understanding
of democratic elections, as well as statis-
tics.
Besides, if low turnout somehow
makes an election's results illegitimate,
then our newly elected Student Govern-
ment officers should resign pending an-
other election that better reflects their in-
terpretation of the Student Body's desires.

Students spruce up school
By NICOLE LYNN GREINER
Alligator Contributing Writer
The outer walls of Mrs. Turner's third
grade class were once beige cinder blocks.
Now they're covered in hand-painted mu-
rals and colorful illustrations while animal
foot-prints line the nearby sidewalk.
The murals and sidewalk art are just a
small part of the transformations Lake Forest
Elementary School has undergone as part of
last weekend's three-day renovation during
Project Makeover, an annual event in which
UF students remodel a local school.
"The main thing it's gonna do is continual-
ly educate them," said Diane Hill, the princi-
pal of Lake Forest, talking about the murals.This year the project exceeded expecta-
tions of 800 volunteers when 1,100 UF stu-
dents signed up to lend a hand.
Lauren Gispanski, the volunteer direc-
tor for the project, said every volunteer was
called Wednesday to let them know they
would still be going ahead with the project
despite rain.
The project planted three butterfly gar-
dens, painted more than 50 murals and
shaped a new baseball diamond.
"In my elementary school, nothing like this
ever happened," said Maridalia Cedeno, a UF
freshman, as she painted George Washing-
ton's hair for the president's mural. "We just
came to a boring building every year, and this
makes the school a brighter atmosphere."Second game will be in April
ZOMBIES, from page 1
preparing for the game.
"I've been a fan of zombies since I
was 15," said Fufidio, a UF freshman.
Fufidio is not UF's only fan of zom-
bies. Andrew Joustra, a telecommuni-
cations production junior, was a player
in Humans vs. Zombies and is produc-
ing a documentary about zombies and
their prevalence in popular culture.
"It has a fan base that people don't
realize how large it is," Joustra said."I'd like to show people the magni-
tude of zombie popularity."
JoustrahasinterviewedMaxBrooks,
author of the best-selling "Zombie
Survival Guide" and the zombie novel
"World War Z," for his
Local documentary. He plans
News to use footage from UF's
Human vs. Zombies
game in his documentary.
Schmitt said he is planning another
game of Humans vs. Zombies for the
first week of April.

Patrick Wanninkhof, a materials science and engineering sophomore, shields himself from water bal-
loons in the World's Largest Water Balloon Fight Against Breast Cancer Saturday afternoon on FlavetAll 50,812 balloons were
popped after half an hour
BALLOON, from page 1
Kira Forbes, a floor representa-
tive from the Towers Area govern-
ment, said the filled water balloons
were packed into large trash bags,
unloaded from rented U-Haul
trucks and spread neatly onto the
plastic sheeting on the field.
Volunteers carried clickers to
count the balloons as part of the
world record attempt.
"We've been assembly-lining it
for hours," said Forbes.
After the setup was completed,
the crowd enjoyed the bounce
house, music and a silent auction.
At around 3 p.m., people rushed
onto the field to started hurling the
water balloons at each other.
Half an hour later, all the bal-
loons were popped.
While some wore bathing suits,
others walked away wringing
out drenched sweaters, jeans andshoes.
On the field, families and stu-
dents laughed and screamed, and
one student used the plastic sheet-
ing as a slide.
"My friend went berserk
on me. She ran at me with
a balloon in her hand and
slammed it on my face."
Jenise Araujo
UF f reshman
Others targeted their friends
with balloons.
"My friend went berserk on
me," said UF freshman Jenise
Araujo, who participated in the
fight. "She ran at me with a bal-
loon in her hand and slammed it
on my face."
"It was all for a good cause, so
it's OK," Araujo said.

Werner passes up late shot in UF loss
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
ATHENS, Ga. -Dan Werner's coaches and team-
mates consistently praise him for doing the little things -
hustling, boxing out and making the extra pass.
Saturday, he tried to make one pass too many.
With Florida down by two, Werner passed up an open
16-footer and attempted to get the ball to a wide-open Ver-
non Macklin by the basket, but Georgia forward Albert
Jackson deflected it out of bounds with 0.1 seconds to go.
The Gators (20-9,9-5 Southeastern Conference) couldn't
do anything with the fraction of a second and fell 78-76 to
the Bulldogs (13-14, 5-9 SEC) in Stegeman Coliseum.
"At least we could've got a shot up to get a
chance. But we didn't even get a shot up."
Kenny Boynton
UF freshman guard
"You tell [Werner] to keep his head up, buthe should've
shot that one," freshman guard Kenny Boynton said. "At
least we could've got a shot up to get a chance. But we
didn't even get a shot up."
The play was designed for junior forward Chandler
Parsons to come off two screens and get the ball on the
wing. But the Bulldogs stuck to Parsons, and two Georgia
defenders pressured him to make the pass to Werner.
"If Dan Werner makes the pass, and it gets through,
and Vernon Macklin dunks the ball, you're talking about
how smart Dan Werner is today," UF coach Billy Donovan
said. "If Dan could have the play back, knowing what the
result was, he would've shot the ball because it would've
given us a chance."
UF wasted its last chance and couldn't hold off Geor-
gia despite overcoming two huge deficits, a career-high 29
points from Parsons and a hot shooting night by Boynton.
Boynton, who has struggled to find his range the last
few weeks, connected on 6 of 9 shots from beyond the arc

UF forward Chandler Parsons scored a career-high 29 points in the
Gators' 78-76 loss to Georgia in Athens on Saturday. Parsons and

Gators fall to Crimson Tide on Senior Day
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
etorrens@alligator org
Florida honored its five seniors Sunday
after the game, but the post-game mood
was a blend of disappointment and cel-
ebration.
The Gators (14-15, 7-9 Southeastern
Conference) lost to Alabama for the second
time this season by a score of 66-61. It was
an improvement from the 82-58 blowout
loss UF suffered Jan. 21, but it still put a
damper on honoring the seniors.
The Crimson Tide (12-17,4-12 SEC) used
a solid first half where they outrebounded
UF 18-12 to put some space between them-
selves and the Gators before holding on for
the win.
"I'm really disappointed for them," UFcoach Amanda Butler said about her se-
niors. "As a coach, you hope you're going
to have many, many more days and Senior
Days and all those opportunities to be part
of.
"But you only get one Senior Day, and
you want it to be perfect.
Obviously, ours was not
perfect tonight."
Florida freshman Jen-
nifer George shined on a
J day when the spotlight
t a was thrust on her senior
J iI teammates. She scored a
Sorenson game-high 16 and tied a
season high with 10 boards, marking her
first-career double-double.
Seniors Steffi Sorensen, Jennifer Mos-
sor, Susan Yenser, Lonnika Thompson and
Sharielle Smith all started their final gameat the O'Connell Center, though the team's
11th different starting lineup this season
failed to set the tone early.
"Certainly Senior Day was a small part
of it," Butler said about the all-senior start-
ing lineup. "The bigger part of it is, we
thought that was the best five to start this
ballgame."
The Crimson Tide jumped out to a 22-8
lead in the first 11 minutes, during which
UF made just four field goals and zero
three pointers. It was a lead UF threatened
to take but never claimed.
The Gators hurt themselves with
31.7-percent shooting and made just two
of their 23 attempts from beyond the arc
(8.7 percent).
They went 0 for 12 from three-point

SEC Title
0 THE MEANS TEAM FINISHED
SECOND BEHIND ARKANSAS.
By RYAN BUTLER
Alligator Writer
Anchored by a strong showing
from its distance runners, the UF
women's track and field team won
the three-day Southeastern Confer-
ence Indoor Championship Meet in
Fayetteville, Ark., beating the hosts,
Arkansas, by 28 points and capturing
its first SEC title since 2004.
Distance events also proved to be
the difference in the men's team's sec-
ond-place showing. With three events
remaining, Arkansas scored 17 team
points in the 5,000-meter run and 10
I i team points in the dis-
tance medley relay to
give them a four-point
victory over the Gators.Track v"I am extremely
proud of the Florida
track and field program as a whole,"
UF coach Mike Holloway said. "I
have an incredible coaching staff and
they do a phenomenal job of making
sure our athletes are prepared. We're
having success, but we can't rest on
our laurels in this league. We have to
come back and keep fighting."
The UF women took control of the
meet in the last event of the second
day, racking up 24 of their 110 team
points in the 3,000-meter run. Char-
lotte Browning, in her first attempt
in the event during the 2010 season,
won the race in 9:21:77.
The Gators placed four runners in
the top eight of the 3K, with Rebec-

Gators relinquish just one run in weekend sweep
BY GREG LUCA
Alligator Writer
On senior Francesca Enea's 22nd birth-
day, her teammates gave her the gift of a
10-1 win over Northwestern State on Sun-
day.
The win improved Florida's record to
12-1 on the season and completed a three-
game sweep over the Demons.
The Gators outscored Northwestern
State 30-1 during the course of the week-
end, pounding out eight home runs.
"I don't get caught up in the home runs,
but we swing the bat hard and try to do
a good job going with pitches," UF coach
Tim Walton said. "It's inevitable we're
going to hit some home runs but my big
thing is getting people on base."
UF certainly did a good job getting
players on, as the team combined for a .518
on-base percentage in the series.
In addition to notching 26 hits, UF hit-
ters drew 16 walks over the weekend.
Junior Aja Paculba led the way with
five, and also hit her first home run of the
season in Sunday's finale.
"She had a good hit today with runners
in scoring position and overall she gets on
base a lot," Walton said. "Even when she's
not swinging the bat as well as she's ca-
pable of, I still think she does a good job of
not swinging at bad pitches."
Paculba became the eighth Gator to
have a ball leave the yard this season.The hit could mark a turnaround for
Paculba, who is batting just .250 after a 2
for 20 start to the year.
"I needed a confidence booster before
we start SECs and go off to California, so it
was a good day for me," Paculba said.
Ace Stephanie Brombacher got all three
of the weekend's wins for Florida, giving
up only one run in 12 innings of work.
It was also a good weekend for fresh-
man pitchers Ensley Gammel and Erin
Schuppert, as they combined for five score-
less innings.
"It's inevitable we're going to hit
some home runs but my big thing
is getting people on base."
Tim Walton
UF softball coach
"They've all been great," catcher Tiffany
DeFelice said. "They've been hitting their
spots, and they've been working through a
little bit of adversity, which is good."
DeFelice had a good finale in her own
right, giving the Gators a 4-0 lead with a
three-run home run in her first at-bat after
going 0 for 4 in Saturday's games.
"I was just trying to put that way in the
back of my head, and I just came out here
with a lot better of an attitude and a better
strategy today and I think that worked out
for me," DeFelice said.

UF suffers first loss of year
By TONI-ANN MILLER
Alligator Writer
Last week, Florida seemingly did ev-
erything well in its first two games -it
played team defense, led in shot attempts,
controlled time of possession and execut-
ed the fundamentals.
However, against North Carolina on
Sunday, the Gators' lack of composure
was the team's Achilles'heel.
UF lost its first game 18-5 to No. 4 UNC
in Chapel Hill on Sunday.
The Gators totaled 23 turnovers to the
Tar Heels' 13.
Midfielder Brittany Dashiell led Flor-
ida with two goals, and midfielder Julie
Schindel dished out the team's only two
assists. Goalkeeper Cara Canington tal-
lied 10 saves for UF on the day.
After UNC got off to a quick 3-0 start,
UF began to show signs of life, and it
played a closer first half.
Attacker Ashley Bruns scored the
Gators' first goal with 15:10 left in the first
period, but North Carolina did not allow
Florida to build any momentum. The Tar
Heels responded with three unanswered
scores to take a 6-1 lead with 6:18 left.
The Gators then seemed to have gained
fresh wind as they closed the half with
three unanswered goals in the final two
and a half minutes. At halftime, UF trailed
UNC 6-4.
"We started off a little rough; it took us
a couple minutes to get into the swing of
things and get a feel for the game," Can-
ington said. "Towards the second half of
the first half, we caused some turnovers
in the midfield, and defense came up with
some big stops."
In the locker room, Canington said the
team talked about the changes it neededto make in the second half, especially cap-
italizing on the Tar Heels' mistakes, but
UF was unable to make the adjustments
on the field.
NorthCarolina scored six-straight goals
before UF midfielder Colby Rhea shot the
team's only second-half goal with 12:35
remaining. UNC kept the Gators scoreless
for the rest of the match and tacked on six
more goals of its own to seal the victory.
"In the second half, we kind of got
away from our game plan," UF coach
Amanda O'Leary said. "When that hap-
pened, we weren't successful offensively
or defensively. We really struggled."
She said the game plan was to look for
quality shots.
On defense, she expected the team to
maintain body position, avoid fouls and
giving UNC advantages
on the 8-meter arc near the
goal.
However, the GatorsLacrosse struggled to stick to the
plan throughout the entire
game Sunday. They were outmatched and
outhustled by North Carolina in all facets
of the game.
The squad took only 17 shots on the
day while the Tar Heels attempted 36. UF
could only convert on one of its three free
possession shots. UNC converted nine of
its 13.
On the ground, Florida scooped up 13
balls to the Tar Heels' 29.
"We had careless turnovers, and
against a top-ranked team like Carolina,
you just can't have those turnovers,"
O'Leary said. "Carolina executed, they
took us out of our game plan in the second
half, so I give all the credit in the world to
Carolina. They did a great job."

Florida tops Auburn on road
By TOM GREEN
Alligator Writer
Heading into No. 4 Florida's meet
against No. 16 Auburn, UF coach Rhon-
da Faehn wanted her team to score well
on the road and eclipse the 195.475 it
scored at N.C. State.
Friday night in Beard-Eaves Me-
morial Coliseum, the Gators (6-2, 5-1
Southeastern Conference) did just that,
as they beat Auburn (2-5, 2-4 SEC),
196.800-195.700.
"Typically we don't have strong com-
petitions when we travel to Auburn, but
we came through with a big win," Faehn
said. "We're definitely happy we get to
replace that N.C. State total."
The score was Florida's best output
on the road, and its second-best perfor-
mance of the season behind last week's
score against rival Georgia.
As close as the teams' last four meet-
ings in Auburn have been -all being
decided by half a point or less -Fri-
day's meet was all Florida from the
start.
In the first rotation, sophomore Eliz-
abeth Mahlich and seniors Maranda
Smith and Amanda Castillo all regis-
tered 9.875s en route to the team's best
bar score of the season.
The three gymnasts shared the event
title on bars, and helped Florida estab-
lish a .525 point advantage early on.
But that was as close as the meet
would get.
"I thought overall the team did a re-
ally great job as far as starting out strong
on bars and carrying that momentum
and energy throughout the competi-
tion," Faehn said.
Florida came away with team victo-
ries in each event, and swept the indi-
vidual honors for the meet, including a
vault title and a share of the beam title
for senior Courtney Gladys, who scoredseason-highs of 9.9 and 9.85, respec-
tively.
"Courtney was just awesome to-
night," Faehn said. "She nailed her vault
landing. She didn't move and stuck it.
Her beam was gorgeous and it speaks
volumes of her hard work in practice to
not have one wobble and stick her dis-
mount."
It marked the second time in her ca-
reer -and this season -that Gladys
won multiple event titles in a meet.
"I've been working on my landings
on vault and focusing on my consis-
tency and technique on beam," Gladys
said. "It's great to know my hard work
paid off."
Freshman Ashan6e Dickerson per-
formed well again,
earning her fifth all-
around title of the
season and second in
a row.
"She's a machine,"
Faehn said. "She's
-- just so calm and con-
Faehnfident"Dickerson also per-
formed one of her best floor routines of
the year, even though her 9.875 wasn't
her best score of the season. Faehn said
despite that, Dickerson still earned the
highest floor score of the meet, and it
showed the judges valued her routine.
The team's performance allowed it to
finish off its SEC regular season sched-
ule on a high note before closing out the
year with two non-conference competi-
tions.
"Our conference is so strong, and
it's so difficult and challenging," Faehn
said. "Looking at our SEC portion of the
season it was very strong. We had that
one loss at Alabama, and that's it. We're
just happy to be done on the road."

where we want to get to as
a team," Parsons said of the
Gators' NCAA Tournament
chances. "It's disappointing to
come out here and play like
we did tonight. It feels like we
let one slip away, and we can't
have that late in the season."
Macklin had 10 points and
six boards, but junior power
forward Alex Tyus, usually
one of the Gators' top scoring
options, was particularly in-
effective against the physical
Bulldogs frontcourt. Tyus fin-
ished with zero points and four
rebounds in 21 minutes.
UT's big men also struggled
to contain UGA's Trey Thomp-
kins, who finished with 20
points on 8-of-14 shooting, sev-
en rebounds and five assists.
"Give Georgia credit," said
Donovan, who was called for
his first technical foul in the
first half. "A lot of times after
a game you can sit there and
point out what you've done
wrong, what you needed to
do better or what went wrong
on your end. Sometimes you
don't give enough credit to the
other team."
The Bulldogs opened up
another 15-point lead with 9:45
left in the game, but the Gators
worked their way back and cut
it to two several times before
their final attempt fell short.range in the second half. It was the second-
fewest three-pointers UF had made all season
and the team's second-lowest three-point per-
centage on the year.
Alabama shot 51 percent, including a
41.7-percent clip from three-point range.
Tierney Jenkins, who carried UA in its first
game against UF, was held to eight points and
seven rebounds, while Dedrea Magee played
39 minutes and scored 13 with six rebounds.
George was the only Gator in double fig-
ures, but Sorensen had nine points and nine
rebounds.
"It's certainly been a journey, that's what
makes this game so hard," Sorensen said.
"Other people aren't really blessed with the
flowers and the nice crowd. It's just some-
thing you don't really think about as far as
growing up."
Florida trailed 34-26 at the half, but after
10 steals and a four-minute Alabama shoot-
ing drought in the second half, the Gators cut
the score to 57-54 with 3:45 remaining. Jenkins
made her next two buckets and had a critical
steal with 17 seconds left to seal the victory.

ond leg of the gold-medal win-
ning relay, finished third in the
long jump at 7.79 meters andwon the triple jump at 16.83,
scoring 26 of the Gators' 119

I am extremely proud of
the Florida track and field
program as a whole. I
have an incredible coach-
ing staff and they do a
phenomenal job of mak-
ing sure our athletes are
prepared."
