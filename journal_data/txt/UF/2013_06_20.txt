For 23-year-old Kaitlin Gwynn, working 
for the City of Gainesville has been a gate-
way to opportunity. But the UF alumna who is about to enter graduate school isn’t a staff member — she’s an intern. 
“You’re really trusted with doing tan-
gible projects and tasks,” said Gwynn, who is interning in corporate communications at Gainesville Regional Utilities. “I’ve met peo-ple — senators and representatives — key people that I never would have been exposed to otherwise.”
Gwynn is one of about 35 interns who 
work for the City of Gainesville through an informal program that offers both paid and unpaid internships to students. That number may be growing in the future.Mayor Ed Braddy is looking to expand op-
portunities for student interns and to up the program’s prominence, said Cheryl McBride, interim human resources director for GRU and the City of Gainesville. After a meeting Tuesday with Braddy, McBride said the may-or was pleased to see how interns are being used across city agencies and ofﬁ  ces, and he is seeking to increase the number of positions.
McBride said they are also working to 
make the program a high-proﬁ  le one.
“I think perhaps there’s a perception that 
we didn’t have a very robust program be-cause we don’t go on campus three times a year looking (for interns),” she said. “We are looking to make opportunities more visible to students and also to explore other areas that could utilize interns.”

Sprint, the nation’s third-
largest wireless carrier, an-
nounced Monday it has ex-panded its 4G LTE service to Gainesville and 21 other cities.
This means customers will 
experience data speeds faster than the 3G connection, a stron-ger wireless signal and more reliable coverage, said John Kelley, a sales representative at a Gainesville Sprint store, 4127 NW 16th Blvd.
About 50 percent of the tow-
ers have been built and activat-ed in Gainesville, he said.“From this coverage, Sprint 
users can expect faster stream-ing speeds allowing music and HD videos to download like a snap of the ﬁ  ngers,” said Lukas Costas, a Best Buy sales repre-sentative in the mobile phone department.
However, he said Sprint is at 
a disadvantage because AT&T and Verizon — which launched LTE networks months ago — have had time to test the net-works in the Gainesville area and troubleshoot dead zones.
Kathy Rae Hileman, a 21-
year-old telecommunication senior, said service is better. 
“Since Monday, my LTE 
has been patchy in certain ar-eas, but it’s like lightning speed compared to the old 3G cover-age,” she said.Sprint improving local

Gov. Rick Scott appointed two 
new members to UF’s Board of 
Trustees on Wednesday.
James “Bill” Heavener and Ja-
son Rosenberg join David Thomas, who was selected earlier this year, as the three newest gubernatorial appointees on UF’s board. They will replace Steven Scott, whose term ended; Alan Levine, who moved to the statewide Board of Governors earlier this year; and Michael Heekin, whose appoint-ment was not conﬁ  rmed by the Florida Senate.
The new members’ terms began 
Wednesday and are due to end Jan-uary 6, 2016, according to a news release from Scott’s press ofﬁ  ce.
The appointments were routine, 
said UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes, and they’re both Gators.
Heavener is from Winter Park, where’s he’s the CEO and co-chairman of Full Sail University. He earned a bachelor’s degree in business administration from UF in 1970. The 65-year-old is the namesake of the Heavener Football Complex behind the Bull Gator on campus.
Forty-four-year-old Rosenberg, 
of Gainesville, is a plastic surgeon who specializes in breast cancer reconstruction. He got a psychol-ogy degree from UF in 1990, his master’s degree in anatomy in 1993 and his doctor of medicine degree in 1995.
Both new trustees made politi-
cal contributions in the last presi-dential election cycle.
According to campaign ﬁ  nance 
records, Heavener donated a total of $135,000 to the super PAC Restore Our Future, a political action com-mittee supporting Mitt Romney. He also contributed more $62,000 to various Republican groups.
Rosenberg donated $1,000 to 
the Republican party of Florida in addition to $8,500 to other Repub-lican candidates like Ted Yoho and Newt Gingrich.

Every time Tim Hayes rode his 
bike to Boca Fiesta, he noticed the 
bike rack outside the restaurant was full. 
The handicapped rail at the 
neighboring Hippodrome State Theatre was loaded with bikes, too. 
Hayes, an avid cyclist and co-
owner of Swift Cycle, said he felt there was a lack of parking for bikes across the city. 
A tweet that Hayes sent 
about the situation to former Mayor Craig Lowe kick-started an initiative by the Gainesville Community Redevelopment Agency to install a series of bike racks. 
The second of three sets of 
bike racks slated for installation downtown went up last week near The Top at the corner of North Main Street and Northeast First Avenue. 
Cyclists in the community 
have expressed appreciation for the improved parking situation.  
The ﬁ  rst new rack appeared 
May 30 in the courtyard between Boca Fiesta and the Hippodrome.
“It should be noted that at 
Boca Fiesta they put the rack in on a Thursday morning,” Hayes said. “I went down there Thursday night, and the rack was completely full. So, it goes to show you that we need even more bike parking.”
The third rack, which has not 
yet been installed, is planned for the intersection of Southeast First Street near Bo Diddley Community Plaza.
Plans for the racks began at 
a Community Redevelopment Agency meeting in October.
City Commissioner Thomas 
Hawkins said adding bike racks to the city is a way to solve the problem of having bikes locked to things that were intended for something else.Cody Chasteen, a UF 
biomedical engineering sophomore, often locks his bike to “No Parking” signs when he knows he won’t leave it there for long, he said.
The 19-year-old said he once 
biked to the movie theater in Butler Plaza, and he had to use the rack in front of Walmart.
“They’re within 100 yards of 
each other, but it’s the only one in Butler Plaza that I know of,” he said. “You have to walk all the way across the street and through all kinds of lights and stuff.”
Hayes said it makes sense for 
the city to continue adding bike parking because the number of riders in the city is constantly increasing.
It’s also a way to enable people 
to use modes of transportation more easily, Hawkins said. 
“It’s pretty simple,” he said. 
“If people are going to bring a vehicle somewhere, they need a place to store it. If you invest a whole lot of space in parking, lots of people are going to be inclined to drive. If you invest in bike racks, people are going to be able to drive or take their bikes.”

UF is opening a new satellite cam-
pus for graduate architecture students 
in Sarasota.
A Sarasota County-owned build-
ing designed by William Rupp in 1960  will be named Citylab-Sarasota. It’s set to open August 2014, said Peggy Carr, associate dean and professor at UF’s College of Design, Construction & Planning.
“Our goal is to grow our graduate 
enrollment,” she said. “We are some-what limited by the space we have here for our graduate studios with our bud-get being as tight as it is, and this is one way to accomplish that.”
The estimated cost of tuition when 
the school opens is $731 per credit hour, according to an email from Julie Frey, communications director at the College of Design, Construction, & Planning.
UF will lease the building for $1 per year on the condition that half of the 
building will be used for community purposes, Cynthia Peterson, founding board member of the Center for Archi-tecture Sarasota, wrote in an email.
This will be the second satellite cam-
pus UF has opened for graduate archi-tecture students. The first was in Or-lando. Carr said Citylab-Sarasota will follow that model, though the curricu-lum may focus more on architecture that relates to the Sarasota region.
“I think it’s a great opportunity for 
the school and students because it of-fers a new location and Sarasota is such a historical city,” said 20-year-old UF architecture junior Andres Camacho.UF architecture campus

Rosanna Del Cioppo/Aubrey Stolzenberg� 37 PERCENT SAID A DOG 
COULD BE PRESIDENT.
ERIC BANDIN
Alligator Contributing Writer
During football season, UF stu-
dents and locals hate any animal 
that’s not a Gator. 
Their opinions may line up with 
the results of an unconventional national poll conducted by Public Policy Polling.
For example, one in five Ameri-
cans said they prefer to spend time with their pets instead of most people, and Butler Plaza Animal Hospital veterinary technician Sara Beth Christensen agreed.
“My cat is definitely better than 
most humans I know,” she said.
About 80 percent said they like 
or love their dogs, but only 58 per-cent said the same for cats. That makes sense because respondents preferred dogs to cats, though about one-fifth of respondents said they were more afraid of snakes than any other animal.
“Snakes have a brain the size 
of a walnut and won’t chase you down,” said Michael Moulton, as-sociate professor in UF’s Depart-ment of Wildlife Ecology & Conser-vation. “It’s the big cats that seem the scariest to me — particularly tigers.” 
But tigers actually won the vote 
for exotic pet that Americans would most like to own.
Other poll results showed that in 
a hypothetical fight between a bear and a shark, 56 percent of respon-dents picked the bear to win.
“The shark would just swallow 
the bear whole,” said Natalie Gar-cia, 20-year-old UF environmental engineering junior.
Christensen said, “The shark 
wouldn’t have any way to keep the bear from punching them into sub-mission. My money is on the bear.”
Other findings included:
� 23 percent said Bambi was 
their favorite movie animal
� 10 percent said they’d like a 
hippopotamus for Christmas
� 37 percent said a dog would 
be a good president based on its 
personality
� 18 percent said they think the 
Loch Ness Monster is real
� 31 percent said their pets 
sleep in the bed with them
� 23 percent said cat owners 
are weirder than dog owners
� 49 percent of vegans and 
vegetarians said they wanted to own a dinosaurInstead of a formal recruit-
ing period, she said, the city 
looks for interns throughout the year.
Agencies for which students 
may work include Gainesville Police, Regional Transit Sys-tem, the City Attorney’s Office and the Office of Equal Op-portunity. Paid positions range from about $8 per hour to $16 per hour. 
Audrey Mitchell, human 
resources manager for the city, added that the program is flex-ible and based on the needs of certain departments.
“We don’t have a program 
specifically that’s structured,” she said. “Various departments offer internships based off of what they need and use indi-viduals to fill opportunities.”
McBride said the internships 
help the city as well as the stu-dents involved. 
“By working with students 
while they’re in school, hope-fully we can keep great talent in the city of Gainesville,” she said.
For now, McBride said the 
city is still in the planning phase for ramping up the program.ALANNA MASSEY

A future haven for military 
families in Gainesville has received 
more financial help.
On Friday, Gainesville Fisher 
House, a nonprofit organization still in the construction phase, which is aimed at providing lodg-ing for military hospital patients and their families, was given a $4,000 donation.
The donor was Enterprise Hold-
ings Foundation, the parent corpo-ration of Enterprise Rent-A-Car.
When finished, the building 
will stand two stories high and oc-cupy 16,000 square feet adjacent to the Malcom Randall VA Medi-cal Center, across from UF Health Shands Hospital.
The money will help fund pro-
gramming at the facility, said Patti Fabiani, Fisher House’s executive director.
It will directly help guests be-
cause it will be used to purchase toiletries and food, she said.Jason Shank, the Enterprise area 
rental manager who presented the check, said Fisher House supports the values of the foundation. En-terprise’s founder served in World War II aboard an aircraft carrier named Enterprise, he said. 
“I chose the Fisher House be-
cause I think that we all have an obligation to give back to the men and women who fight for our free-dom,” Shank said. “It should be the community’s responsibility.”
When the house opens, Fa-
biani said, it will meet a need in Gainesville. 
“People are traveling from a 
long distance,” she said. “A lot of times what happens is they bring their loved ones to a hospital, and they leave them because they can’t afford to stay.”
Fisher House is set to open in 
the fall, Fabiani said, and it will have 20 suites intended to serve 750 families per year. 
“The minute we get OK’d to oc-
cupy it, we’re expecting to be 100 percent full,” she said.THURSDAY, JUNE 20, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 5

86 TOTAL VOTES48% YES
52% NOTuesday’s question: Have you ever painted the 34th Street Wall?Haha, check out the LOL breakdown
You probably remember LOL from your days us-
ing AOL Instant Messenger. While official docu-mentation of his birth does not exist, it is safe to 
say that the stardom of the acronym standing for “laugh out loud” began in the early 2000s after the boom of instant and text messaging.
After bursting onto the computer-mediated-com-
munication scene in the first couple years of the 21st century, LOL seemed unstoppable. He was young and popular with text messengers and AIM users alike — his future was bright.
He was by far the most commonly used text mes-
sage acronym in the business. LOL was direct and to the point. At the time, he was simply the best way to tell someone you were genuinely laughing out loud. The envy of all other laugh indicator acronyms, LOL was the biggest star in text messaging.
But following in the footsteps of Lindsay Lohan, 
Amanda Bynes and many other former child stars who made it big at about that time, LOL’s fame was followed by troubling years.
Soon after LOL’s emergence in technological com-
munication, a new player came onto the scene — Haha. Haha was the first of his kind. He was not a word, nor was he an acronym. He was simply the sound of laugh-ter spelled out. Haha was innovative and fresh, and he soon began getting the jobs that LOL formerly had the monopoly on.
Appearing on the subject lines of thousands of emails 
per day and peppering text and instant messages, Haha was a star. LOL simply took a back seat.
“No one wants to laugh out loud anymore,” LOL 
said in a 2007 interview. “They just want to Haha. What even is Haha? It’s just a sound. I describe the action…I describe the action,” he repeated sorrowfully.
After a few years of sparse job opportunities and 
multiple rehab stints, the demand for LOL began to re-turn but in a way that no one — not even LOL himself — imagined.People began using him, not 
to say they were laughing out loud, but for an entirely differ-ent purpose. LOL started to be used to mean things like “don’t take what I just said seriously,” or “I’m not sure what you’re trying to say, but I can tell you’re trying to be funny so I’m 
just going to write LOL so it seems like I understood.”
With the continual use of LOL to mean pretty much 
anything besides actually “laughing out loud,” Haha began to be used in a synonymous fashion. People were including Haha in their text messages so the person they were sending it to knew that what was being said was intended to be a joke of sorts.
After stealing the limelight from LOL a few years 
ago, Haha and LOL are now interchangeable.
Neither genuinely mean that someone is truly 
“laughing out loud” or “haha-ing.”
At about the same time that Haha and LOL became 
the likes of crocodile tears, a new hotshot came onto the scene — Hahaha. Similar to Haha, Hahaha provided that extra flavor to written messages that Haha was sim-ply no longer bringing to the table.
But the madness doesn’t stop there. As soon as Ha-
haha showed up, people began to demand more. Yeah, you guessed it; Hahahaha is the latest expression of genuine laughter in text messaging. I suspect that in ten to twenty years people will have to use upwards of thirty “ha’s” and at least three laugh-face emoticons to effectively explain true laughter through the typed word.
Looking back, LOL had no chance. What began as a 
promising career as a laugh indication acronym, LOL has turned into a strange and twisted palindrome that has no real meaning.

ander told Congress that the NSA’s widespread surveillance has 
disrupted dozens of terrorist attacks. Though he didn’t offer any more details than that, this week it was revealed that the NSA’s surveillance disrupted two “potential terrorist events.” Now the NSA chief said they have helped thwart plots more than 50 times. So, how many plots were really disrupted?
Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian journalist who first report-
ed Edward Snowden’s NSA leaks, asked an even better ques-tion via Twitter: “When officials claim that ‘Bulk Surveillance Program X’ stopped Terror plots, must ask: could you have stopped it with narrower program?” Greenwald has been one of Snowden’s most vocal and well-spoken advocates. For his con-tinued defense of liberty and support of an American hero, we give Glenn Greenwald a LAUREL.
Did anyone order a drone? Robert Mueller, director of the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation, said yesterday that he has.  U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley asked the esteemed Mr. Mueller if the FBI uses drones for surveillance on U.S. soil. Mueller’s response: “Yes.” Though he did admit that drones are only “seldom” used, in today’s age one can hardly expect government officials to ac-tually be truthful. And now that drones can be made about the size of a soda can, who knows what dangers domestic drones could pose to liberty. We scramble an unmanned aerial DART  
to Robert Mueller’s position. The NSA gave us his coordinates.
Here’s the big news, though: the Associated Press reports that 
the infamous NSA program used to collect data called Prism is just the tip of the iceberg. In fact, the government could be stor-ing all of our electronic communications. The AP reports that while things are stored, they can’t be accessed until relevant for a national security investigation. Here’s the kicker, though: All of the data is stored indefinitely. From the AP: “Two decades from now, the government could have a trove of American emails and phone records it can tap to investigative whatever Congress declares a threat to national security.”
How many darts would it take to respond to this violation?The president has actually been defending the actions of the 
NSA.  In an interview this week with Charlie Rose, the president said, “So point number one, if you’re a U.S. person, then NSA is not listening to your phone calls and it’s not targeting your emails unless it’s getting an individualized court order. That’s the existing rule.” But Snowden’s data is showing that this isn’t the case. Either the president is mistaken or he’s lying about what he knows — neither of which shows he cares. We give President 
Barack Obama a please-start-caring-soon DART.
Dick Cheney has also been vocal this week with respect to the 
NSA surveillance. He appeared on Fox News to smear Snowden and call him a traitor.  Imagine that. The former vice president of the United States calling Snowden — a man who stood for what’s right by revealing the dark works of the government — a traitor. Cheney gets a DART.
It’s a sad and frightful day for the people when Cheney and 
Obama, the right and the left, so many with power, hold hands and agree on something like this. See you in Summer B.

When Elizabeth Jones began working for 
the UF College of Education in 1952, P.K. 
Yonge Developmental Research School was housed in Norman Hall. The building’s in-habitants, Jones said, ranged from kindergar-teners to doctoral candidates at that time.
As an employee of UF for 61 years — lon-
ger than anyone else to date — Jones, known affectionately as “Miss Betty,” said she has seen the university grow from 10,000 students to 50,000 students. She’s seen Johnny Cash’s performance in the Florida Gym in 1964, in-tegration of the student body on campus and the advancement of women’s athletics. She’s seen the construction of Century Tower and the establishment of the colleges of medicine, veterinary medicine, dentistry, fine arts and nursing.
Today Jones is a fixture in 1012 Turlington 
Hall. When she answers the phone, everyone is either “darlin’” or “honey,” but more often both. Last year, the academic technology de-partment threw a party to celebrate her 80th birthday and her 60th year at UF.
UF, she said, is “my university.”When she first began working as a sec-
retary for the university’s industrial arts de-partment at age 20, Jones lived in a boarding house with 16 other girls — a culture shock, she said, because she grew up on a farm with six brothers.
At the 1952 UF Homecoming parade, she 
met her husband, Harold. She was drawn to him immediately, she said, because he made her laugh. They got married at a tiny church in Lake Butler by the preacher who had bap-tized her.
After becoming pregnant in 1957, Jones 
retired from the university, ready to be an at-home mother. But when the secretary who re-placed her also became pregnant, Miss Betty returned to take her place, and she was asked to work in the educational media center as a graduate student assistant supervisor. In 1973, she moved to the Office of Instructional Resources, which has since evolved into the Office of Academic Technology. Jones retired once again in 1992 but couldn’t keep herself away — she has worked as a part-time other personnel services employee ever since. 
In her spare time, she’s an avid reader of 
adventure and mystery novels.
She was offered other jobs in Gainesville, 
Jacksonville and Washington, D.C., over the course of her career, but the thought of leav-ing the students and professors she loved was unbearable.
“And to think, darlin’, I could have 
changed Washington,” she said, laughing. “But I really found that this was best for me, and I just wouldn’t change my life or where I wound up.”

So I didn’t actually do much eat-
ing at The Swamp Restaurant the 
day I sat with actresses Jamie Den-bo and Jessica Chaffin to talk about their roles in the upcoming come-dy, “The Heat.” In fact, neither did they: They seemed displeased with the nachos.
“It wasn’t worth (the calories),” 
Chaffin said.  
The girl talk made up for it.Chaffin and Denbo, from their 
live comedic talk show “Ronna & Beverly” developed at Upright Cit-izens Brigade Theatre in Los Ange-les, strutted out of their Boston-na-tive garb and into the questionable clothes from their roles as the white trash girlfriends of two of Melissa McCarthy’s brothers in the movie “The Heat.” And yes, they got to keep the clothes from the set.
“Don’t you see what we’re 
wearing now?” Chaffin asked af-ter looking down at her snakeskin print top. Denbo’s Gator tank was at least spirited.
To give a short preview of the 
film: Just like any Sandra Bullock role, she’s an FBI agent who plays by the books and doesn’t work well with others. Just like any Me-lissa McCarthy role, she’ll have you laughing…for the majority of the movie. And Chaffin, who plays loud-mouth Gina, and Denbo, who plays loud-mouth Beth, join the ranks as two of many characters who are not Bullock’s or McCa-rthy’s fans in the movie.
The Massachusetts-born TV sit-
com stars have been building up their comedic resumes, including their roles in the “Real Housewives of South Boston,” “Weeds” and “90210,” among others. The June 28th theater release of “The Heat” will be no exception.
“We love working with Paul 
Feig. He’s a great director,” Denbo said. “Doing this movie was such a nice break ‘cause we weren’t doing any producing like we usually do. There was so much less to worry about.”
Movie filming took them back to the duo’s old stomping grounds in Boston. It seriously amped the Boston accents, if anything.
“I felt like we were getting paid 
to kind of joke around with each other,” Chaffin said. “It was the most enjoyable time I’ve had on a set.”
The best friends of 15 years revel 
in their futures. They say they could be Ronna and Beverly forever.
“I’d say it’s like 60-40: In our 
daily lives, 60 percent of the time we’re Beverly, and the other 40 we’re Jamie and Jessica,” Denbo said.
Why not Ronna?“Let’s face it, Beverly is just 
more fun to be,” Denbo said.
Since 2009, the sassy 50-some-
things Ronna and Beverly have epitomized what an over-the-top Jewish motherhood looks like — dramatic — and sounds like — overdramatic.
“You’ll like it ‘cause we don’t 
play Jewish mothers, we ARE Jew-ish mothers,” Chaffin said. “We’re not pretending.”
Along with spacing out act-
ing gigs out, Chaffin also said she would like to see the “Ronna & Beverly Talk Show” in the future.
“I want long periods of time to 
spend with my kids,” Denbo said about her two young kids.
Next thing I knew, Ronna and 
Beverly were giving me advice about life after graduation. The best part about talking with the two ac-tresses: getting their comedic, if not sarcastic, takes on what “The Heat” will promise, from the great cast to the oh-so-proper roles — see, sar-casm — that will be sure to leave anyone who watches laughing.

The ﬁ  xation of zombies and vam-
pires is on a rise, thanks to entertain-
ment outlets such as TV and books.
On Saturday at Tower Road 
Branch Library, paranormal graphic novelist Andre Frattino did an in-depth discussion about the popular-ity of the paranormal as a topic of interest. Frattino will visit multiple branches of the Alachua County Li-brary District this summer.
The allure of forbidden love, a 
morbid past and the curious appeal of the living dead are some of the reasons people love zombies and vampires, Frattino said. 
He said the movement of vam-
pires and zombies is the underlying fear that has evolved because the media has paid more attention to it in the past few years.
“I think people have always had 
this fear of vampires and zombies because in a way, zombies and vampires represent us in different aspects,” Frattino said.
People are intrigued with how 
people change and not so much the zombies, Frattino said.
“We like the idea of immortality, 
the underlying fact of internal love and the fear of never getting older,” he said.
Corey Berner, president of Gators 
Human vs. Zombies club at UF, said people love zombies and vampires because it peaks the imagination and is out of the ordinary.
“We tend to like unordinary 
things because it grasps us onto new inventions in our life and our soci-ety,” Berner said. “We like things that are dangerous and a little bit scary and on the edge — it’s what gets our adrenaline ﬂ  owing.”
Nickie Kortus, marketing and 
public relations manager for the Alachua County Library District, said the appeal of zombies and vam-pires was created through folklore, legends and centuries of tales.
“Zombie and vampire novels 
are popular and many titles are fre-quently on hold for checkout at the libraries,” she said. 
The Alachua County Library 
District has more than 369 vampire books in its collection. “Twilight,” by Stephenie Meyer, is one of the most popular titles, with 860 checkouts during its shelf life, Kortus said.
Terry Frederic, a 20-year-old UF 
business management junior, said zombies and vampires present op-portunities to explore things beyond our imagination.
“The obsession over zombies 
and vampires has evolved from being a scare tactic into a thrill that movie and game enthusiasts crave,” he said.
Why do we love the supernatural?

Luminox will perform at 
Simons on June 20 at 10 p.m.
Simons nightclub, 8 S. 
Main St., aims to provide an amazing show that will leave customers anxious for Sum-mer B to start, said Christo-pher Harris, Simons general manager.
An expected 700 people 
will enjoy a night of trap and dubstep music, he said. The club has been marketing the event through social media, street teams, promotional companies and the radio.
Samantha Lai, district 
manager for the Bento Group, which manages Simons, said Luminox is one of Simons’ biggest shows for Summer A and will set the tone for up-coming events.
Lai said a lot of shows will 
ﬁ  ll the venue this summer and fall. The nightclub has four or ﬁ  ve more shows planned for Summer B — not taking into account the touring DJs.
The club 
will rein-force its mot-to, “elevate n i g h t l i f e , ” by taking Gainesville 
nightlife to a new level, Lai said. It will upgrade the sound and lighting system in the club and bring  in DJs who play around the world.

Dear Mediocre Advice,
I always seem to attract guys who at 
first seem confident and spontaneous, 
and then after a couple of weeks/months I find that they are needy and stage-five clingers. Then, after all of this discovery, it’s a pain to break up with this breed of guy. How do I identify their annoying and contradictory qualities as soon as I can then break it off without breaking their 
hearts?This column is provided by Ariel Barnes, a 22-year-old majoring in international studies. Would 
you like to get some Mediocre Advice? Visit http://mediocreadvicegators.tumblr.com/ask
Ariel Barnes
Dear Friend,
Unless you cease your manhunt, that’s 
not possible. There is no way to break off 
a relationship without some heartbreak. It means there is a distinct ending without which you may continue to lead these boys on. The group of guys you deemed unfit are not looking for the same things you are. It’s not your fault if you lose interest, but you may have commitment issues. You should have a better idea of what you’re looking for every time it does not work out between you and whatever guy who couldn’t keep 
your attention.Dear Mediocre Advice,
Why are girls always putting guys on ped-
estals and not simply seeing if they’re com-patible or have a good personality — espe-
cially those in their early 20s?Dear Mediocre Advice,
How can you believe that women have it 
harder judging “what they’re getting” when they go home with a man, when a man would know just as much about a woman’s vagina as she does about his penis? Why does the burden of genitalia size disparity 
fall solely upon the man?
Dear Friend,
Putting another on a pedestal depends on what kind of 
person you are and what you’re looking for. Girls may tend to talk about it more, but this quality is not based on gender. Your early 20s is the time to sow your wild oats, and I have sowed the s—t out of my wild oats. It’s not for everyone, but it is for the majority of college students, which is why you think people at that age are not trying to find someone they’re compatible with. Trial and error is necessary to find out what you like and steer clear of what you don’t. When-ever ripping and dipping gets boring, finding someone you can have a conversation without feeling the urge to barf becomes priority. There is a little TGI Friday’s buzzer that goes off, vibrating and lighting up, when you realize you don’t want to bone some guy at a bar just because he eye-f—d you and said he liked your glasses. It gets dull. People take different amounts of time to become tired of pretending they’re into whatever the other person is talking about to simply get it in. It becomes an exhausting process, but it is a mandatory one. You have to use up your youth juice to find 
out what you want and who you want it from.  Dear Friend,
I have never heard of a man taking a woman 
home and being genuinely concerned if her va-gina is that of a wizard’s sleeve. Women have a magical thing called kegel exercises: some-thing you can do after giving birth, while you’re in line—basically wherever and whenever you feel like doing them. We can do an exercise that tightens our vagina after a small human has walked through it. That’s almost supernatural, right? Guys cannot do the same—they cannot make their dicks bigger or whack out the occa-sional weird curve. What a guy lacks in size he can make up for in skill. I would look past a tiny penis if I was dealing with someone who ate box like it was his job. Size matters but not as much as how you use it. I guarantee excellent skills and personality will give more orgasms than a 
big, useless d—k.

Rita Hayworth was the pre-
ferred pinup girl for the World 
War II soldiers and the prototype of sass, class and style for genera-tions of women.
Madonna honors her among a 
slew of other screen sirens in her 1990 song, “Vogue,” in which she sings: “Rita Hayworth gave good face.”
Search Google Images for Hay-
worth, or peruse her movies on Netﬂ  ix, and you can see just how good that face was — kind of. To get the full effect, you have to see Hayworth on ﬁ  lm — 16 mm cellu-loid ﬁ  lm.
Film provides a picture and 
experience that you can’t get from digital media, according to audi-ence members and organizers at the ﬁ  rst night of independent video rental store Video Rodeo’s classic ﬁ  lm screening series.
Classic movies will be screened 
from an original ﬁ  lm reel every Wednesday at 8 p.m. at The Wooly, 20 N. Main St., next to The Top res-taurant.
The ﬁ  lms will be projected from 
their original 16 mm footage, allow-ing viewers to experience them as their creators intended, said Roger Beebe, owner of Video Rodeo and a UF associate professor of English. 
Beebe selected the movies from 
the approximately 1,900 16 mm ﬁ  lms he acquired from UF, after the university decided to remove them from its archives.
“A lot of them were marked 
with stickers saying, ‘VHS replace-ment,’ indicating, ‘We don’t need these anymore, we have VHS versions of these things,’” Beebe said. “Now, that seems incredibly short-sighted. Many of these prints look as good as the day they were struck.”
The ﬁ  rst screening was held 
Wednesday, June 12. About 30 people attended to watch the 1946 ﬁ  lm, “Gilda,” starring Hayworth as an at-large femme fatale in war-time Buenos Aires.
UF student Lindsey Jones, a 
21-year-old English major, had seen the movie before but said the experience of watching it on 16 mm made it more exciting.
“Seeing the ﬁ  lm on 16 mm, on 
the celluloid — it’s a more organic experience, like the way the ﬁ  lm was meant to be seen,” Jones said.
The occasionally glitchy cellu-
loid made watching the movie feel more special, referring to moments when a frame would repeat itself, or when one reel ended and the next had to be loaded, she said.
“You don’t exactly know how 
it’s going to go, like moments when it cuts out. You can tell some of the ﬁ  lm had been spliced out and re-paired,” she said.
Charming as the technical limi-
tations of 16 mm ﬁ  lm can be, the saturated color of the images makes viewing these ﬁ  lms a surprise for the senses, Beebe said.
Although “Gilda” was in black 
and white, the opening short ﬁ  lm was one of the ﬁ  rst color versions of Mickey Mouse.
“I didn’t know a red could be 
that intense,” Beebe said.“The greatest things about 
watching it in 16 mm is the colors are much more vivid, much more pronounced,” said UF ﬁ  lm and media studies alumnus Robert Ed-mondson.
“There’s something lost in the 
pixelation of an image,” he said.
Admission is $3. Proceeds from 
the screening will help Video Ro-deo, Gainesville’s last video rental store, convert its remaining VHS tapes into DVDs and add new ﬁ  lms to its inventory.
Movies from the ﬁ  lm noir genre 
will be screened every other week, rotating the screen with science ﬁ  ction ﬁ  lms. A surprise short ﬁ  lm will play at 8 p.m. before the main feature starts at 8:30.

  Sydney Moss dealt the Gators 
a painful blow when she an-
nounced on Tuesday that she would not be returning to the Florida women’s basketball pro-gram next season.
  Moss is one of three UF play-
ers — along with Chandler Coo-per and Vicky McIntyre — to leave the program this offseason. Unlike the other two, Moss’ de-parture could get messy before things are completely sorted out.  
  Understandably, Amanda 
Butler and her coaching staff hoped to hold onto their star player. Sources told the Alliga-tor that Butler and her staff ﬂ  ew to Kentucky earlier this month hoping to convince Moss to re-consider her decision to leave the program. Moss urged the group not to make the ﬂ  ight and did not change her mind.
  Both Moss and McIntyre con-
ﬁ  rmed their decisions to leave the Gators basketball program on Tuesday. Neither stated a speciﬁ  c reason or transfer destination.
It is likely Moss is hoping to 
transfer to a school such as Lou-isville or West Virginia. Either place would give her the op-portunity to be closer to family and escape what has become an uncomfortable atmosphere in Gainesville. 
Moss has requested a waiver 
to transfer to a program closer to home. As of Wednesday night, UF would not grant Moss a release to a BCS program, leaving the two sides in a standoff, according to sources close to the situation.
  In her only season with the 
Gators, Moss was second on the team in scoring, averaging 11.8 points per game. She overcame a midseason slump to carry the Gators to the Final Four of the WNIT and showed a level of poise that made her a strong candidate to develop into an All-Southeast-ern Conference caliber player as a sophomore next season.
  “Sydney wants to be close to 
her mom and home. We wish her, Chandler and Vicky the best,” coach Amanda Butler said.
        Moss ﬁ  gures to be the biggest 
loss of the offseason.
  Her greatest strength is the 
ability to ﬁ  ll up a box score. Often the team’s best offensive threat, she managed to add 6.8 rebounds and 3.9 assists per contest during the season.
  Moss was named to the 2013 
All-SEC Freshman Team and the 2013 postseason WNIT All-Tournament Team for her perfor-mance.
  McIntyre, a 6-foot-7 center, 
would have been a senior in 2013-14. She played just one season at UF after transferring from Okla-homa State, where she spent her ﬁ  rst two collegiate seasons.
  In 2011, two coaches on staff at 
Oklahoma State were killed in a plane crash while traveling on a recruiting trip. After the season, McIntyre chose to look for a fresh start and ended up at Florida, where she averaged 4.8 points and 3.8 rebounds while play-ing in 29 games, including three starts. 
  However, McIntyre did not 
play in any of Florida’s postsea-son games. Neither she nor Butler offered any reasoning for her ab-sence at the time, and McIntyre’s decision to leave the program was somewhat expected.  
  Earlier this month, Cooper 
conﬁ  rmed her intention to trans-fer from Florida to Lipscomb University. Cooper explained the decision as an opportunity to be closer to home — she is from Clarksville, Tenn. — while also playing basketball in a smaller environment.
  However, Cooper cited sever-
al other factors that weighed into her decision, including a level of dissension within the program, especially among some of the team’s younger players and the coaching staff.
  The three departures come in 
stark contrast to the direction the program was seemingly headed.
  After a disappointing regular 
season in 2 0 1 2 - 1 3 , Florida’s run in the W N I T o f f e r e d 
hope heading into next season. Moss was projected to continue developing into an All-SEC cali-ber player. She would have been joined by transfers Cassie Peoples and Antoinette Bannister — each a highly rated prospect coming out of high school — as well as freshman Ronni Williams, a Mc-Donald’s High School All-Amer-ican who could become Florida’s most talented player ever.
  Those four, along with the ex-
pected return of Viktorija Dimai-te, — who has missed the past two seasons due to injury — and losing only one player to gradua-tion, Jennifer George, had expec-tations surrounding the program as high as they have been in some time.

 Antonio Morrison’s arrest last week-
end is not a unique case.
  Since Urban Meyer took over the 
program before the 2005 season, 44 Florida players have been arrested. That’s enough players to start on both sides of the ball and have players ready to come in reserve.
  The long arm of the law knows no bounds. 
Players arrested vary in talent. Walk-ons have been nabbed, as have All-Americans.
    We want to narrow down the list. Who 
cares that a walk-on linebacker was arrested for marijuana possession two years ago? We’re going to reduce the list to the best of the best at each position. 
  We bring you the Incarce-Gators.  Quarterback: Cam Newton. Newton was 
the backup quarterback in 2008 when he was arrested and charged with burglary, larceny and obstruction of justice after he stole an-other UF student’s laptop and threw it out of a window, accord-ing to police.
  Newton re-
ceived a pre-trial deferment and was sentenced to community service and probation, but Meyer suspended the quarterback for the 2008 sea-
son. Newton transferred to a junior college, ﬁ  nishing his Florida career with 40 passing yards.
  Newton eventually transferred to Au-
burn, where he won a national title and the Heisman. Meanwhile, Florida was languish-ing in the John Brantley era, so you can thank Newton for that.
  Running back: Chris Rainey. Before he 
electriﬁ  ed fans with long runs all over the ﬁ  eld in 2011, he had a run-in with the law that older UF students might remember.
  Rainey was arrested on aggravated stalk-
ing charges in September 2010 after texting his girlfriend that it was “time to die,” ac-cording to police.
  Meyer suspended Rainey indeﬁ  nitely, 
and the running back returned at the end of October after missing ﬁ  ve games.
  Rainey had a relatively quiet senior year 
off the ﬁ  eld in 2011, but was entertaining on the gridiron. He racked up 1,451 all-purpose yards and ﬁ  ve touchdowns. The Pittsburgh Steelers drafted Rainey in the ﬁ  fth round of the 2012 NFL Draft, and he played his rookie season there.
  Rainey is currently a free agent, as the 
Steelers cut him after he was arrested on simple battery charges on Jan. 10.
Wide Receiver: Riley Cooper. There 
were several eligible players who could have made the cut at receiver, but I picked Cooper due to the uniqueness of his citation.
  Cooper was cited with a misdemeanor 
charge of resisting an ofﬁ  cer and failure to comply with the police or ﬁ  re department in February 2009, according to the Orlando Sentinel. That’s something different.
  Cooper’s case was dismissed, and Meyer 
never revealed any action taken against him.
  The current Philadelphia Eagles receiver 
ﬁ  nished his Gators career with 1,496 yards and 18 touchdowns.
  Tight end: A.C. Leonard. Leonard is the 
ﬁ  rst player who sppears on this list who was arrested under Will Muschamp . 
  Leonard was arrested on simple domes-
tic battery charges in February 2012 and was suspended from the team.
  Leonard came to Florida and caught eight 
passes for 99 yards in his only season with

Redshirt freshman outfield-
er Cory Reid will transfer from 
Florida, a UF spokesman con-firmed Wednesday. 
Reid said 
he is trans-ferring to another pro-gram for a 
chance to play in the everyday  lineup. Reid 
said he will attend the State College of Florida, Manatee-Sarasota.
Reid played 32 games in 2013, including 11 starts in right field. In 40 plate appearances, he batted .275 and knocked in four RBIs. However, he only saw time in 10 Southeastern Conference games, going 1 for 5 in conference play.
His most notable game 
was on May 6 against Florida A&M. Reid scored a career-high two runs while singling in an RBI and stealing his only base of the season. 
Reid had a promising start 
to his freshman campaign, going 3 for 4 against Duke to begin the season, but only had two hits in his next 10 at-bats .

ckingsbury@alligator.org.Redshirt freshman 
to transfer from UF
Reid
BaseBall the Gators. He left the program 
four months after his arrest and transferred to Tennessee State.
Offensive line: Jessamen 
Dunker. Like Cooper, Dunker makes the list due to his crime. However, Dunker’s crime is not noteworthy due to its oddity, but for its severity.
Dunker was arrested for felony 
grand theft auto on Jan. 16 after po-lice said he possessed a stolen mo-ped and drove with a suspended license. 
Dunker, a four-star recruit, nev-
er played a game for the Gators. He redshirted his freshman season and decided to transfer in April. 
Defensive line: Carlos Dun-
lap. Dunlap was one of the bricks 
Meyer built his Florida dynasty on, but he had some trouble with the law in 2009.
Dunlap was arrested after he 
was found asleep behind the wheel at a green light, according to Alli-gator archives.
After police roused him, he was 
arrested for second-degree DUI — a misdemeanor.
Dunlap was sentenced to six 
months probation and 50 hours of community service, and Meyer suspended him for the 2009 South-eastern Conference Championship game.
Dunlap wrapped up his Flori-
da career with 84 tackles and 19.5 sacks. He’s currently playing for the Cincinnati Bengals.
Linebacker: Antonio Morrison.  
The newest addition to the list of arrested Gators, Morrison was ar-rested for punching a bouncer at the Kava Lounge, according to po-lice. Morrison was charged with simple battery.
According to a Gainesville Po-
lice Department report, Morrison said, “I am a UF football player. I’m Antonio,” to the bouncer, which paints an interesting mental picture.
Morrison, now a sophomore, 
started three games for Florida in 2012, making 34 tackles and re-cording one sack. 
Muschamp has not made a pub-
lic decision on what Morrison’s punishment will be.
Cornerback: Janoris Jenkins. 
Who else? Jenkins was arrested three times at Florida. The final ar-rest came in April 2011, when Jen-kins was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana – the sec-ond such offense in three months.
Muschamp cut Jenkins from the 
team following his final arrest. Jen-kins ended his Florida career with 121 tackles, 25 pass deflections and eight interceptions.
Jenkins played his final college 
season with Division II North Ala-bama and was selected with the 39th overall pick of the 2012 NFL Draft by the St. Louis Rams. 
Safety: Matt Elam. The recently 
departed Elam had a successful run with Florida, and few remember that he was arrested while Meyer was still coaching UF.
Elam was arrested for underage 
possession of alcohol in July 2010, when Elam was a freshman.
The safety pled no contest and 
did not miss a game.
Elam finished his Gators career 
with 168 tackles, five sacks and six interceptions. He was selected 32nd overall by the Baltimore Ravens in this year’s NFL Draft.
There you have it: the best of 
Florida’s troublesome players.
But it’s not all bad. Florida did 
not have a kicker or punter arrest-ed in Meyer or Muschamp’s pro-grams. Good job, special teams.

For Erik Murphy, the path to the 
NBA Draft is a family affair.
Twenty-nine years ago, Murphy’s 
father, Jay Murphy, was selected 31st 
overall by the Los Angeles Clippers in the second round. The power for-ward out of Boston College played four seasons in the league – his final two with the Washington Bullets. 
Murphy, who plays at the same po-
sition, hopes to follow in his father’s footsteps and hear his name called at the NBA Draft one week from today.
“It would be big. Honestly, it’s my 
dream,” Murphy said. “But whatever happens, happens. It’s out of my con-trol at this point.”
If Murphy is the first Gator select-
ed next Thursday night, he would be the 16th player and 11th frontcourt player drafted during coach Billy Donovan’s 17-year tenure at Florida. 
Most NBA Draft analysts have 
projected the 6-foot-10 Murphy as a mid to late second-round pick. 
Draftexpress.com has Murphy go-
ing 42nd, NBADraft.net has him at No. 48 and ESPN’s Chad Ford ranked him outside of his top 60 prospects for the draft. 
Based on what scouts have told his 
agent, Andy Miller of ASM Sports, Murphy believes he will be drafted somewhere in the second round. 
“Everybody says different things,” Murphy said. “Everybody has their own ideas, and when it comes to the draft, it’s really unpredictable.”
Murphy hopes his success shoot-
ing the ball in his final season at Flor-ida will translate to the next level. 
He shot 45.3 percent from behind 
the arc in 2012-13 and led the South-eastern Conference in three-point shooting percentage (.473) during league play. 
Murphy became more of an inside 
threat last year – shooting 57.9 per-cent inside the arc – as he took 0.6 more two-point field goal attempts per game than during his junior sea-son.
Averaging 12.2 points per game, 
Murphy finished his senior season ranked 35th in the country in offen-sive rating, 17th in effective field-goal percentage and 21st in true shooting percentage, according to KenPom.com. 
Murphy’s most efficient game as a 
Gator was a 10-for-10, 24-point show-ing against Wisconsin on Nov. 14. He eclipsed the 20-point mark three times in 2012-13.
During workouts, Murphy said he 
has tried to prove to scouts that he’s more athletic and a better defender than they think. 
He struggled to grab boards in his 
first three years at UF, but slightly improved his senior season, averag-ing 5.5 per game. 
Murphy has heard the Matt Bon-
ner comparisons from people around him, but he said he aspires to find a niche in the NBA similar to that of Ryan Anderson – a stretch four and sixth man for the New Orleans Peli-cans. 
So far, Murphy has worked out 
for the San Antonio Spurs, Cleveland Cavaliers, Houston Rockets, Indiana Pacers, Portland Trail Blazers, Or-lando Magic and Detroit Pistons. He plans to work out for the Phoenix Suns on Saturday. 
“It’s been a busy process,” Mur-
phy said. “There’s been a lot going on, with traveling and workouts and combines and all kinds of stuff. But it’s been fun though. You have to have fun with it.”
Next Thursday, Murphy won’t be 
in the Barclays Center in Brooklyn – the site of the 2013 NBA Draft. 
Instead, he will be watching the 
draft back in his hometown of South Kingstown, R.I., with his family and close friends.
“It’s getting closer,” Murphy said, 
“so there’s a little bit more anticipa-tion.”

LANDON WATNICK
Alligator Staff Writer
Former Gators safety Josh Evans 
visited an old home with his new 
team Wednesday.
Evans, who was drafted 169th 
overall in the NFL Draft by the Jack-sonville Jaguars in April, stopped by the Oaks Mall for two hours to meet fans and sign autographs dur-ing the Jaguars Caravan Tour. 
Two of Evans’ teammates, for-
mer South Carolina wide receiver Ace Sanders and defensive tackle Sen’Derrick Marks, were also pres-ent. 
“It’s amazing to be an hour 25 
(minutes), an hour 30 away,” Ev-ans said. 
After a breakout senior season 
with the Gators in 2012 – during which he led the team with 83 tack-les, tallied 2.5 sacks and finished with three interceptions – Evans is still adjusting to the pace of the NFL. 
“It’s more of a faster tempo,” he 
said. “It’s good on good each day. It ain’t were you might have one or two receivers where one might be good and the other might be aver-age. It’s all you got each day. You can’t afford a bad day.”
A free safety at UF, the 6-foot-1, 
210-pound Evans has the versatil-ity to play both safety spots for the Jaguars if necessary. 
“Just knowing both roles – any-
time you know more, it helps your game, instead of just knowing one position,” Evans said. 
Because he’s been busy with 
OTAs and minicamp the past two months, Evans has not trav-eled around much of Jacksonville, but he describes it as a “laid-back town.” The sixth-round pick said he’s already built a great relation-ship with first-year coach Gus Bradley. 
Evans also shared his thoughts 
on next year’s Gators football team. He expects junior quarterback Jeff Driskel to assume a larger leader-ship role this season. 
“This should be a huge year for 
him,” Evans said. “They’re really going to be on his back. … When you feel confident in your quarter-back and know they can take the next step, it makes the team feel real good.”
Evans also had high praise for 
sophomore defensive ends Jona-than Bullard, Dante Fowler Jr. and the Gators secondary.
“Those guys had a huge impact 
coming in as freshmen,” Evans said. “(They) could really take this defense to another level. 
“The DBs are pretty loaded. 
You’ve got three guys who can be future NFL stars.”
Evans said he has high expecta-
tions next year for redshirt senior wide receiver Andre Debose, who has struggled throughout his entire career at Florida. 
“Debose had some ups and 
downs, some injuries,” Evans said. “I expect a huge year out of him. It’s his last year. He’s got to leave out with a bang.”
