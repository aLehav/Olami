Preacher JK of Bema Ministries, left, shouts and points at UF senior Scott Paterson, right, as Paterson sticks 
up his middle finger. The preacher’s sign read “Homo sex is a threat to national security.” Among those around JK is UF freshman Brett Passa, center, whose sign made fun of JK in Turlington Plaza Wednesday afternoon.

He didn’t mean to press Enter.
But when he did Tuesday eve-
ning, he reached thousands of UF students through the emergency alert system with a text read-ing, “The monkey got out of the cage.”
The suspect, a former Mobile 
Campus employee, said he was showing his friends that he could still access the alert system.He said that the message was 
not racially moti-vated.
The suspect 
is a Gainesville 
resident and confessed to po-lice Wednesday evening after questioning. His name is being withheld until he is formally charged, which could be as early as Thursday, said Steve Orlando, 
UF spokesman.
“We want people to know 
we’re pursuing it,” Orlando said. “We’re taking this seriously, and 
we won’t have anything like this happen again.“
So far UF officials believe that 
no student data was compro-mised when the texts where sent.
Police name suspect in mass text messaging case
A UF student plummeted three stories 
from a parking garage on campus early Wednesday morning.
Everett Millman, a 20-year-old sopho-
more, was taken to a local hospital follow-ing his fall from the parking garage locat-ed south of Hume Hall on Gale Lemerand Drive.
Millman, from Land O’ Lakes, Fla., is a 
resident of the honors residential college at Hume Hall.
The incident happened at around 4 a.m. Wednesday, said UF spokesman Steve Orlando.
After Millman fell, the student who was 
with him told University Police that they were smoking marijuana on top of the ga-rage, Orlando said.Millman had serious injuries to his face 
and was still in the hospital Wednesday night, Orlando said.
The issue of drug use on campus is 
not being investigated at this time, and UF’s main concern is Millman’s injuries, Orlando said.

UF announced Wednesday that it will be forced to 
reduce endowment fund spending by $1.5 to $2 mil-
lion from April to June due to investment losses.
Endowment investments dropped about 19 percent 
from July 1 to Dec. 31, according to an e-mail sent to 
administrators. As a result, UF must reduce its endow-
ment spending bases by about 19 percent to comply with its investment policy.
This is the first time UF has had to reduce its spend-
ing bases since the policy was established in 2004, said Leslie Bram, associate vice president of the University of Florida Foundation, which oversees donations to 
UF.
UF would have reduced them following invest-
ment losses of 8.3 percent from July to September, but 
UF President Bernie Machen asked the foundation to 
go against its policy because of the bleak budget situ-
ation.
A spending base is the percentage of a donation 
that can be drawn from for spending. If $100 is do-UF losses

New details released in Anthony case
ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Slain Florida toddler Caylee 
Anthony’s mouth was covered with silver duct tape that had 
been adorned with a heart-shaped sticker, according to reports released Wednesday.
The reports released by the state attorney’s office also show 
that duct tape was attached to her hair, and the girl’s remains were placed in a laundry bag and then secured in a plastic gar -
bage bag before being left in the woods.
When investigators processed the duct tape at an FBI lab in 
Quantico, Va., they noticed the residue of a heart-shaped sticker on it. The sticker was later found near where the toddler’s re-mains were discovered.
“It appears the sticker was put on the duct tape intentionally,” 
a detective wrote in a request to search the home where Caylee Anthony lived with her mother and grandparents.
Investigators also found a Winnie the Pooh blanket, a pair of 
striped shorts and a toddler’s size shirt in the bag with Caylee’s remains, according to the reports.
A utility worker found the girl’s body last December in woods 
near where she lived with her mother and grandparents. She was reported missing in July, a month after she was last seen.
Caylee’s mother, 22-year-old Casey Anthony, has been charged 
with her death. She claimed that a baby sitter kidnapped Caylee.n The North

Executive order calls for 
Guantanamo closure
WASHINGTON (AP) — 
President Barack Obama plans to 
sign an executive order Thursday to close the Guantanamo Bay de-tention center within a year and 
halt military trials of terror sus-
pects held there, a senior admin-istration official said.
The executive order was one 
of three expected imminently on how to interrogate and prosecute al-Qaida, Taliban or other foreign fighters believed to threaten the United States.
The official said the president 
would sign the order Thursday , fulfilling his promise to shut down a facility that critics around the world say violates domestic and international detainee rights. The aide spoke on condition of anonymity because the event has not yet been announced.

Fla. schools turn down early application deadlines
state
By saRa BRUBaKeR
Alligator Contributing Writer
Prospective college freshmen won’t have 
to rush to turn in their applications well be-
fore deadlines - in Florida at least.
On Tuesday, three Florida public univer -
sities — UF, Florida State University and the 
University of Central Florida — said they will 
not follow after some California state univer -
sities that moved up admissions deadlines for accepting freshman applications in response 
to state budget cuts.
Fresno State, part of the California State 
University system, stopped taking applica-
tions three weeks prior to its original dead-line of Feb. 1, according to a recent article in 
The New York Times. As soon as the Fresno State admissions of-
fice had enough applications to meet its target number of incoming freshman, it stopped ac-
cepting applications, according to the article.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando said there 
has been no mention of moving up UF’s Nov. 1 application deadline because the university doesn’t operate using admissions quotas.
“We want to make sure every student 
gets a fair chance by having their application 
looked at,” he said.
There are other ways UF is dealing with 
massive state budget cuts, including decreas-
ing the number of students accepted each 
year, Orlando said. UF will admit 1,000 fewer 
students a year over four years, from 2008 to 2012.
This year, he said, UF is aiming to accept about 6,600 incoming freshmen, but normally it receives about 28,000 applications a year.
Browning Brooks, the director of news 
and public affairs for FSU, also said there 
is no plan to move up its Feb. 2 application 
deadline.
“We accepted 1,000 fewer applicants in 
2008 than in 2007 by design,” she said. “This is how we are dealing with budget cuts, not by moving up our deadline.”
Meanwhile, Chad Binette, the assistant di-
rector of news and information for UCF, said 
the university would not move up its May 1 
deadline. Unlike UF and FSU, UCF has roll-ing admissions, which means applicants typ-ically find out whether they were admitted 
shortly after submitting their application.
In 2007, UF ended its early decision pro-
gram, following the lead of top-tier universi-
ties such as Harvard and Yale. However bud-
get cuts were not a consideration in doing so, 
Orlando said.
“We felt early decision gave an unfair ad-
vantage to wealthier students,” he said. 
UF does not have any other plans to cut 
funding for admissions, he said. 
  THE SIX BREAK-INS OCCURED 
LATE MONDAY TO EARLY TUESDAY
By KatIe eMMets

Kemmets@alligator.org
From late Monday night to early Tuesday 
morning, there were six car break-ins in 
a student-populated area of Southwest 
Gainesville.The thieves broke into the cars and took 
stereos, GPS navigation devices and iPods, 
said Gainesville Police Department spokes-woman Summer Hallett. She said a propane 
spark plug was used to lift the windows off 
the cars in most cases.
Two cars were broken into at Countryside 
at the University, 4000 S.W. 23rd St., be-
tween 9 p.m. and 4:13 a.m., a GPD release 
stated. In both cases, a Pioneer stereo sys-tem was taken out of the car, Hallett said.
Between 8 p.m. and 8:15 a.m., an iPod and a TomTom GPS device were stolen from a car parked at the Polos apartment complex, 2330 S.W. Williston Road, the re-lease stated.
A Nikon camera, binoculars, knife and 
an iPod were taken from an unlocked car parked at 3131 N.W. 9th Place between 7 
p.m. and 7:30 a.m.
A handgun, a navigation and stereo sys-
tem and a box of subwoofers were stolen 
from a car parked at Lexington Crossing Apartments, 3900 S.W. 27th St., between 1 and 7 a.m.
According to the release, the thieves 
tried to take the window off of a car at 3914 
S.W. 26th Drive, but they abandoned the 
mission when the window shattered and triggered the alarm. 
“When it (propane spark plug) is put 
next to the window, the window shatters,” Hallett said. “If there is tint on it, the win-dow stays together and they can lift it off of the car and place it on the ground.”Thieves take stereos, other valuables from parked cars

Nathaniel Reed speaks at Pugh Hall Wednesday about Florida and its ailing economy. 
Reed said the current generation has to fix the problems the past has made.
BY CHELSEA KEENAN
Alligator Writer
Former White House employee and 
environmental advocate Nathaniel Reed 
spoke at UF’s Pugh Hall Thursday night 
about two main problems plaguing Florida’s Everglades.
Nathaniel Reed, 75, who was assistant 
secretary of the Interior Department for 
Presidents Nixon and Ford, has worked with 
state and federal environmental agencies for the past 40 years. 
Reed spoke to about 50 people for nearly 
an hour on Florida’s overdevelopment and lack of water resource management as a part of the Samuel Proctor Florida History Lecture 
Series at UF.
He said many new towns throughout the 
state have been created under the charade 
that all growth is good, but their creation ac-tually destroys agriculture and unique eco-
systems.
“I still think that agriculture is far more desirable than rooftops,” Reed said.
Long-term economic, social and environ-
mental benefits should be the driving force 
behind whether new rural communities are 
built, he said.
“Any growth that doesn’t pay for itself 
isn’t smart at all,” Reed said. 
He focused on the consequences of 
high phosphorus concentrations in Lake Okeechobee and the Kissimmee River Basin 
during the second half of his speech.
Reed, who has done work in the area for 
about 20 years, said lake restoration efforts 
must begin now by reducing and eliminating 
phosphorus loadings from lakes and rivers. 
“If you think that land management plan-
ning faces formidable changes, water plan-ning faces challenges every bit as daunting,” 
Reed said.
Reed said he lamented the fact that he 
consistently speaks about the same problems 
that remain unsolved and continue to threat-
en Florida’s environmental future.
He said he would rather tackle new chal-
lenges such as increasing biodiversity and 
restoration efforts.
The only way these challenges can be 
tackled is if students begin to take part in the issues, he said. 
“Be involved,” he said. “It’s your land 
and your world.”Advocate addresses Fla. environmental problems

As Student Government elec-
tions inch closer, some political par -
ties will be looking to fill their ex-
ecutive ticket by seeking applicants 
for Student Body vice president and treasurer in the coming days. 
The Unite Party’s Student Body 
presidential candidate Jordan Johnson will be holding interviews Friday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in Room 275 of the Reitz Union.
Johnson, who is currently Senate 
President and a member of the Gator Party, said he will be look-ing for someone who wants to make a positive change in Student Government’s reputation around campus as well as help mend ties 
between the parties.
“I formed this new party to get 
business done,” he said.
Johnson said previous associa-
tions with the Gator or Orange and Blue Parties won’t hurt applicants’ 
chances. 
“It honestly depends on their 
ideals,” he said. “I started with the 
Gator Party , but that doesn’t make me a bad candidate.” 
Other parties, such as Orange 
and Blue, will begin interviewing and taking applications next week for Student Senate seats. 
Orange and Blue Student Body presidential candidate Sen. Mark McShera said anyone is welcome to apply during interviews, which will begin on Jan. 30 and end on Feb. 2. 
McShera said he’s looking for 
applicants who can offer a fresh per -
spective when managing SG’s bud-get and representing students.
He said he is hoping to put to-
gether a diverse ticket and party . 
The Orange and Blue Party will 
start fliering Thursday, he said.
While campaigning, McShera said, he will be listening to as many different views as he can. 
“We want to be an advocate for 
the students,” he said. “We’re really excited to talk to as many people as possible.”
The Change Party will also hold 
interviews beginning next Friday , 
according to the party’s president, 
Patrick Duffey . 
“We’re looking for fresh faces, 
people who are qualified and don’t owe anyone any favors,” he said.

Residents of UF dorms are reduc-
ing, reusing and recycling in an ef-
fort to minimize waste, energy and 
water consumption on campus.
The third annual three-month 
contest between residence halls at UF kicked off Wednesday . 
Dubbed “Battle of the Halls: Eco-
Challenge,” the competition is spon-sored by The Office of Sustainability , Department of Housing and Gators for a Sustainable Campus. 
“It is important for students to 
realize that everything they do and do not do always affects something else,” said UF sophomore Dana Sabghir, Eco-Challenge coordinator 
and Office of Sustainability intern.
This month, though, UF will at-
tempt to rank No. 1 in Recyclemania, 
a nationwide effort to encourage re-cycling on college campuses. 
On Wednesday , a display of 17 
bags worth of recyclables collect-ed in a campus “Dumpster dive” 
Thursday night were piled in the 
Plaza of the Americas, signaling the start of the eco-friendly festivities, said Bailey Kilbourne, coordinator 
of Recyclemania at UF.
The competition, which ends 
March 28, will include monthly 
tasks centered around recycling and water and energy reduction.
The winning dorm will be an-
nounced at an awards ceremony on April 22, Earth Day , which UF 
President Bernie Machen will at-
tend, Sabghir said. 
The residence hall will receive a 
trophy made from recycled goods in 
addition to a catered party.
Individuals on campus observed 
doing environmentally friendly acts 
will also receive a prize.UF’s Physical Plant Division will 
monitor changes in each dorm’s waste, energy and water use and compare the information with last 
year’s data. 
UF sophomore Justin Goldsmith 
said the event offers more than the 
thrill of competition. 
“Overall, it’s great to see students 
caring for the environment and mak-ing a conscious effort to helping and improving it,” he said. Dorm residents go green for eco-friendly challenge

The lights dimmed and the audience 
leaned in as the improv group Offsides asked 
for a fun fact to start off their short-form com-edy .  
“Frogs can’t swallow with their eyes open,” 
shouted Marcella Rodriguez, a UF telecom-munication senior. 
Then the laughter started and never stopped.
About 60 people packed into UF’s Phillips 
Center for the Performing Arts Black Box Theatre to kick off the fourth annual Gainesville Improv Festival on Wednesday night.
The event featured the satire of Offsides, 
Penny Bear, Death by Improv and Generations comedy groups. Other improv groups will perform throughout the week until the festi-val’s final show Saturday.
Whirled News Tonight, the longest-run-
ning improv comedy show in Chicago, will headline the festival with their performance on Saturday at 8 p.m.
While some of the perform-
ers traveled from as far as New Jersey , others got their start in 
Gainesville.
Many of the Gainesville 
Improv Festival’s comedians are UF alumni 
as well as alumni of UF’s improv organiza-tion, Theatre Strike Force, according to a press release.
“It’s kind of like a big deal for everybody to get together, and for people in Theatre Strike Force now, it’s a great opportunity to see some of the best people we’ve heard about,” said UF engineering sophomore Rudy Mendoza. “There’s a sense of camaraderie between us.”
GIF will also feature workshops taught by 
its performers, according to the release. 
“I haven’t been at UF that long, but it’s re-
ally encouraging to see the cooperation with the alumni and their enthusiasm to come back to the campus,” said Peter Salomone, a mas-ter’s student at UF’s Documentary Institute.

Today’s question: Is Michelle 
Obama the new “Jackie O”?17% YES83% NO
218 TOTAL VOTESMonday’s question: Would you ever steal a case of Natty Light?Obama shouldn’t discount free marketAfter a whirlwind evening rubbing elbows with the 
likes of Beyonce and Shakira, the Editorial Board wouldn’t have faulted President Barack Obama for 
taking a breather on Wednesday.
Hardly the case. Obama hit the ground running as he carried himself like 
a well-seasoned veteran. Wannabe contenders for 2012 — 
now’s a good time to start taking notes.
From placing limitations on lobbyists to freezing the sala-
ries of top aides, Obama took on the arduous task of clean-
ing up the mess left behind by former President George W. Bush.
But what really impressed the Editorial Board was late-
breaking news Tuesday night out of Washington announcing the first delivery on an Obama campaign promise. 
Finally entrenched in the Oval Office —with no thanks to 
Chief Justice John Roberts—Obama will sign an executive order today to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay within one year. Additionally, the legislation will bring an end to military trials of the individuals being held at the facility.
The Editorial Board applauds Obama for wasting no time 
at all in taking the necessary steps to close what has become a black-eye for America’s image. With less than 48 hours of running the country under his belt, Obama’s fast start in of-
fice offers America what is a hopefully a sign of things to 
come.

Dubya’s first day?Goodbye Gitmo
Obama keeps promise 
to close terrorist prison
Column
Remember when the biggest televised event of the year was the Super Bowl? How about the World Series? Or even the premiere of Survivor?
Gone are such simple days. On Tuesday, millions of 
Americans watched our country’s newest entertainment spectacular — the Inauguration of President Barack Obama.
The highlight and center of the spectacle was the much 
-awaited inaugural address in which Obama once again proved his place among our generation’s finest orators.
On the surface, his speech was fluffy and hopeful — a 
cliché ode to the heritage and diversity of America. Fluff is typical of inaugural addresses, and his speech writers did a fantastic job with their rhetoric. So far, so good.
Then came the “zingers” – those unobtrusive little hints 
of socialism that sneak their way into an otherwise main-stream and inoffensive speech. Saying that “the market can spin out of control — and that a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous,” is basically im-
plying that the free market failed some people, so we need 
to more equitably redistribute its spoils. Zing!
“The success of our economy has always depended ... 
on the reach of our prosperity; on our ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart ... because it is the sur -
est route to our common good.” In other words, it’s more important to have an equal distribution of wealth than to encourage entrepreneurship and production. It’s OK for big government to step in and make sure that happens. 
Zing!
“The question we ask today is not whether our gov-
ernment is too big or too small, but whether it works — 
whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified.” In other words, government has an ob-ligation (that is not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution) 
to provide arbitrary entitle-
ments to people no matter what the cost to the taxpayer. Zing!
So yes, the speech sounded 
hopeful and nonpartisan. But it reaffirmed what we have known from the start — Obama 
believes all of our nation’s 
problems can be solved by big 
government. In his mind, it is a gross injustice for some people to be much richer than others, and it is the govern-ment’s job to correct this injustice. And the free market 
— the source of this injustice — must be managed and 
regulated to prevent it.
Obama needs to understand that the market, like jus-
tice, is blind. Some people gain from the market, others 
lose. But a gain is not necessarily a loss. One person’s gain 
means more spending, more flowing money and more jobs. America’s historical support for the free market has made it the richest country in the world.
The market is not looking good right now, but it will fix 
itself in time as it always has. Until then, beware of laws that evoke socialism in the name of equality or security.  
Our constitution guarantees none of these. It only guar -
antees freedom, a virtue which struggles in the face of big 
government and unquestioned pandemics of nationalistic 
fervor.
In this day and age, that pandemic is called “change.”Johnathan Lott is a political science and economics sopho-

letters@alligator.org“Michelle O”?
There’s no denying the 
Editorial Board’s in-delible adulation for 
our very own Superman, but we are just down right giddy about the new first lady.
Move over, Tim Tebow 
— there’s someone else who just caught our eye.
From her stunning formal 
attire to holding the bible as 
her husband took the oath 
of office, Michelle Obama embodies everything we would ever want from the 
most powerful woman in 
the land.
Not only is she exquisite 
and refined, Obama’s re-sume includes an undergrad 
degree from Princeton as 
well as a J.D. from Harvard Law. 
We are also quite im-
pressed by her efforts work-ing for the University of Chicago Medical Center and as a fund raiser for a non-
profit.
Suffice to say Obama has 
made a name for herself 
without simply riding the 
coattails of her husband.
But most of all, we really 
love Obama’s devotion to 
her two young daughters, Sasha and Malia. 
Even with the stresses 
and demands of her new role in the White House, we are confident Obama will 
not let her duties as a mom 
take a back seat to anything.
Only time will tell if she is 
the new “Jackie O,” but one thing is certain — Michelle 
Obama makes a fantas-
tic role model for women young and old.

Despite Roe v. Wade, restrictions on abortions still exist Guest column
Today marks the 36th anniversary of 
Roe v. Wade — the Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal 
nationally.  
During the women’s liberation move-
ment, grassroots organizations pushed abortion rights to the forefront and de-
manded change.
Unfortunately, it has been getting in-
creasingly difficult to exercise the abortion 
rights we won.  
Although Roe v. Wade was a step for -
ward, women face a lot of obstacles when it comes to getting abortions and prevent-ing pregnancy.
Restrictions on abortions — including 
cost, waiting periods, denial of services 
and spousal or parental consent — contin-
ue to limit a woman’s right to choose.
Abortions are expensive, partly because 
abortion providers have costly regulations 
that no other medical providers have to 
abide by.
In many states, women under the age 
of 18 who desire abortions must first get parental consent or go before a judge. 
And finding a place that provides abor -
tions isn’t easy. In Florida, 69 percent of counties have no abortion provider.  
In addition to 
these restrictions, the 
price of birth control continues to  rise, es-pecially since Congress did not approve federal funding to subsidize birth control.
This funding loss has doubled the price 
of the pill right here on the UF campus.  
It is even legal in Florida for your doc-
tor to refuse to write you a prescription for birth control and for your pharmacist to 
refuse to fill your prescription if they are 
“morally opposed” to contraceptives.Women are the experts on their own 
lives. We are the only ones who can make the choice about what is best for us. 
During the women’s liberation move-
ment, average women organized together, pushed abortion rights to the foreground and won Roe v. Wade.
We have to stand together now and de-
mand full access to abortion.
We are the experts on our lives, not pol-
iticians, the courts, lawyers or men.

nated, a spending base of 90 percent would 
mean $90 is the spending base. From this 
$90, 4 percent is spent each year on the do-
nor’s cause of choice, and 1 percent is spent on administrative costs, according to a UF 
Foundation brochure. 
The endowment’s value shrunk from 
$1.25 billion in July to $1.01 billion in 
November, said foundation spokesman Chris Brazda.
Despite the decrease, UF raked in $64.9 
million in donations in December, the high-
est monthly total in UF history, said Paul 
Robell, UF’s vice president for development 
and alumni affairs.
The previous record, $47 million, was set 
in December of 2007.
December is typically the month with 
the highest total, partly because it is the last month to earn tax write-offs for donations before the next tax period, Brazda said.
In comparison, $9.8 million was donated 
in October and $4.1 million in November.
With the addi-
tion of December’s numbers, UF’s 
Florida Tomorrow 
capital campaign, which started in July 2005 
and seeks to raise $1.5 billion in donations 
by October 2012, has collected over $837 mil-
lion.With UF approaching the halfway point 
in the campaign, it is already almost $90 mil-
lion ahead of the halfway mark in funds.
Even so, UF is missing out on millions of 
dollars because the state continues to with-
hold matching funds for donations.
To date, the state has yet to dole out 
matching payments totaling $28.4 million for Courtelis fund donations, pegged for 
construction projects, and $61.9 million for 
endowment donations, Robell said.Despite decrease in value, highest monthly donations made in December

Thousands of shoppers lined 
up at the Oaks Mall Tuesday and 
Wednesday for beauty that, for once, didn’t come at a price.  
Residents flocked to Dillard’s 
and Macy’s, the only two depart-ment stores taking part in a national $175 million settlement that forced the stores to give away founda-tions, eye shadows, lipsticks, skin creams and moisturizers. The stores involved in the set-
tlement include Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdales and Neiman Marcus. They were ac-cused of conspiring with cosmetics companies to fix prices. 
On Tuesday each store began 
distributing one free item for each 
patron who claims to have pur -
chased cosmetics between May 29, 
1994 and July 16, 2003.
The freebies are distributed on 
a first-come-first-serve basis and include high-quality brands like Chanel, Christian Dior, Lancome, Givenchy and Calvin Klein. 
Bert Ferrer, who works in the 
fragrances department at Macy’s, said the store received thousands of calls Tuesday from interested consumers and attracted a line out the door.Supplies went quickly and were 
gone by about 4 p.m. Wednesday.
“I’m just glad it’s over,” he 
said. 
Danielle Sarno, beauty advisor 
at Dillard’s, said Dillards had 2,983 products to hand out, and about 1,600 people came on Tuesday to 
stake their claim.
Customers chose between 22 
products, including popular items 
like a Chanel Coco Mademoiselle body lotion, which usually costs about $50, and a Lancome mascara, which usually costs about $24. 
By Wednesday afternoon, the 
line at Dillard’s diminished to a steady trickle and two types of products were left.
Ashley Malphurs, a freshman 
at Santa Fe College, stopped by Dillard’s Wednesday to claim her 
Clinique Moisture Surge.
Her mother told her about the 
freebies, so she decided to check it 
out, she said.
“I was just like, hey ... free 
stuff,” she said. “I’m going!”

So your financial aid disbursement didn’t 
exactly go as planned. Your wallet may 
have seen better days, but don’t let a lack 
of funds put a damper on your fun. There 
are plenty of activities in Gainesville that 
don’t require any transactions from your 
bank account.
Lake Alice : Think you’re a true Gators fan? 
If you want to spot a real alligator, Lake 
Alice boasts the swamp experience from 
the safety of a viewing platform.  
Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art : If all of 
the football commotion has left you in dire 
need of some culture, peruse an exhibit or 
two at the Harn. It’s the closest thing you’re 
going to get to the Met (The Metropolitan 
Museum of Art) in Gainesville.         
Downtown Gainesville : Downtown offers 
more than just overpriced restaurants and 
nightclubs. Take a stroll through the his -
toric district at night when the Hippodrome 
State Theater is lit up. If anything, it’s good 
cardio.
Lake Wauburg : If all the time spent in 
stuffy lecture halls has left you a bit claus -
trophobic, you probably just need some 
fresh air. Lake Wauburg is full of outdoorsy 
activities. Just flash your Gator 1 Card and 
look out for alligators.

ASHLEY ROSS   AVENUE WRITERJJ Grey’s music flows, 
tells stories of life
 JJ Grey loves writing his music, 
but he thinks it is better when the 
songs write themselves. 
“The best stuff is when it just 
flows out, you know,” he said.
Grey, who is originally from 
Jacksonville, will be playing his 
soulful, Southern rock-meets-blues 
music at Common Grounds to-night with his ever-changing band Mofro. 
Doors will open at 8 p.m. and 
tickets are $17.  
Mofro used to be the title Grey 
went by until a friend confronted him, asking if he did not want to 
use his own name because he was 
ashamed of his music. The answer? Definitely not. 
Grey has been touring hard since 
2000 and has no plans to stop, he 
said. 
His albums include “Blackwater,” 
“Lochloosa” and “Country Ghetto.” 
But his most recent album, “Orange 
Blossoms,” is about where he grew 
up and what he loves most. 
He said his music is a mix of a 
lot of things that are worth remem-bering. 
“My songs have 
ended up being like a diary entry to re-member what’s im-portant,” he said. 
Grey’s music is 
stirred by story-telling, and he has grown to have his own flavor by listening to inspiring 
varieties of music.
As a young kid, Grey would jam 
out on his 8-track to everything 
from KC and the Sunshine Band to Lynyrd Skynyrd and AC/DC. 
Grey said his music is not very 
political, but it is all up to interpre-tation.
He is currently working on a 
score for a documentary called “Good Soldier.” It is the story of four different soldiers from four different wars. 
As a dedicated Gators fan, he is 
excited to come to Gainesville, and he said that every crowd he’s ever played for in Florida has treated 
him well.
This is very different from 
Jonathan Tyler & the Northern 
Lights, the band opening for JJ Grey 
& Mofro, that has yet to play a show 
in Florida. 
Tyler said most of the guys in the 
band grew up in the same areas of Texas and Oklahoma, where they 
played at local bars while they were 
in high school. 
When he was 18, record labels 
told them they weren’t ready to be 
real rock stars.
“It was kind of a bummer, but 
we kept playing anyway,” he said.
When he was 21, the band took 
a turn for the worse and stopped playing altogether. Tyler played 
by himself in coffee shops around town and anywhere he could get a gig. 
But after a while, separation 
anxiety brought the guys back to-gether. Eventually, they signed with Atlantic Records and recorded their album, “Hot Trottin’,” in about six 
days. 
As soon as the album was re-
leased, things started moving more 
quickly than before. 
They used to play at places  
like Starbucks, but now they have toured with bands such as O.A.R., Tyler said. 
Beau Bedford, who plays guitar 
and keyboard, said it has been quite a ride for everyone. 
“All of us are living our wildest 
dreams,” Bedford said. 
He said touring with O.A.R. was 
a great experience to meet new peo-ple, learn about music and have a good time. 
Tyler agreed, adding that they 
still keep in touch with the guys of O.A.R., who taught them a lot on the road.
“You know, here we were, six 
guys showing up 
late to everything,” 
Bedford said. “O.A.R. was so professional.”
It is one thing 
writing the music, but it’s another thing 
to be able to survive 
on the road, Bedford said. 
He specifically mentioned one 
night in Georgia where he felt like he could have been in “Almost Famous.” 
Bedford said the band looks up 
to the Rolling Stones, and the free-
dom they have with their music. He 
said he aspires to have that kind of success.
Tyler writes the lyrics for the 
band, and the rest of the guys col-laborate on music. 
 “Hot Trottin’” was inspired by 
an unsuccessful five-year relation-ship that ended when Tyler dropped 
out of the University of Texas and 
decided to pursue his dreams. 
“The relationship got ugly. It was 
really tough,” he said. “And there were a lot of different emotions to write from.” 
Tyler said some of the songs, like 
“Something in the Wind,” remind him of bad times, and he will only play them if the mood is right. 
The band is about to record its 
second album, which will be re-
leased in June.
The new album will feature 
“cleaner rock” with the same atti-
tude and soul as “Hot Trottin’.” 
Both Tyler and Bedford are ex-
cited to come to Gainesville, and it seems as though they will fit right in. 
“Fans should expect a good time 
because we love to drink, and we love to party,” Tyler said.

—JJ Grey““12, ALLIGATOR   THURSDAY, JANUARY 22, 2009
with  NavaO
In the ‘80s, Nava Ottenberg 
opened a vintage clothing store in 
Gainesville called Persona.
In the last 20 years, Persona has 
evolved into a colorful, eclectic 
downtown boutique.  
The store has costume rentals, 
collectibles and now her own collec -
tion, NavaO Sleepwalk, featuring 
one-of-a-kind vintage re-creations. 
Ottenberg tells us how she 
hopes to preserve small business -
es while making the world a little 
more beautiful and its people a little 
more stylish. 
 
Tell me about the NavaO 
Sleepwalk collection.
The name came up because 
most of my pieces incorporate fab -
ric from vintage nightwear. I love 
working with vintage nightgowns 
because they have a beautiful feel 
and movement to them.
Why do you use vintage fabric in -
stead of new, store-bought fabrics?
It’s very important to recycle, 
and vintage fabrics are better-made, 
too. I am someone who loves to 
mess with things. I just can’t leave 
stuff alone. I see something and I 
say, “I’m not done with it yet.” 
What designer has been an im -
portant point of reference to you?
I am not really inspired by trends or what other people are doing, but 
there is one designer that is worth 
noting: Hussein Chalayan. 
He is not very trendy or main -
stream, but he is highly noted in 
fashion. He’s worked with Chanel 
and other couturiers. His designs 
are very architectural, but also very 
wearable. 
For example, there is this one 
dress of his that was turned into a 
coffee table. 
Why did you decide to open a vin -
tage store?
In the ‘80s, vintage was really 
hot, and even stores like Macy’s had 
racks of vintage jeans. Throughout 
the years, vintage has been very hot 
and cold, mainstream and under -
ground. 
How did Persona get started?
At first we started with very lim -
ited resources selling just vintage. 
Then the Hippodrome asked us to 
help them relocate and gave us a 
bunch of costumes in return. 
I’ve always continued selling 
vintage and collectibles and we still 
rent costumes, but it’s expanded 
into so much more. 
What is the store’s aesthetic? 
It’s a very eclectic environment. The 
more time you spend in here, the 
more you are traveling in time, and every time you come in here you’ll 
find something new. 
Where and how do you select 
pieces for the store?
I go to estate sales, thrift stores, 
vintage stores and people bring me 
stuff. 
I look for pieces that are unique 
and usable with lots of personality. 
And I am always looking to carry 
local designers’ stuff, too, whether 
it be clothing, furniture or jewelry.
What has been the most memo -
rable piece that has come through 
Persona?There was a 1940s Levi’s denim 
jacket that I sold to a Japanese deal -
er for $5,000. That was a real special 
piece. 
There are always treasures com -
ing and going here, but I never re -
gret selling a piece. I am so happy 
to give things a second life. 
What vintage piece should every 
man and woman have in his or her 
closet?
Every woman should have a 
vintage clutch. Ones made from the 
‘60s through the ‘80s were really 
cute. And every man should have 
a good replaceable belt buckle from the ‘70s.
What has made Persona suc -
cessful for more than 20 years in 
Gainesville?
Persona is probably the oldest 
of the clothing shops now. People 
asked me how I survived, when I 
have seen about 50 vintage stores 
come and go in this town, and it’s 
because I am stubborn. 
If something doesn’t work one 
way, I will try it another way until 
it works. I am always reinventing 
myself. It isn’t easy, but it’s crucial. 
Can you imagine a world without 
small businesses?STEPHANIE GRANADA

TODAY IN UF SPORTS HISTORY I DID NOT KNOW THATLast-second layup dooms Gators against GamecocksUf men’S bASkeTbALL
by mIke DifeRDInAnDO
Alligator Staff Writer
mdiferdinando@alligator.org
COLUMBIA, S.C. — Down 69-68 with 2 seconds left on 
the clock, South Carolina’s Zam Fredrick took a length-
of-the-court home-run pass from Mike Holmes and broke UF’s heart.
Fredrick dropped the ball into the hoop as the buzzer 
sounded to down No. 24 UF 70-69 Wednesday night at the Colonial Life Arena.
“I told Zam to go long,” Holmes said.UF (16-3, 3-1 Southeastern Conference) saw its 10-game 
winning streak come to an end.
“It’s something you’re not going to forget,” guard 
Walter Hodge said. “We have to keep our heads up. Tomorrow’s a new day.”
It looked like Fredrick was going to cost the Gamecocks 
when he missed a foul shot with 5 seconds left that would have tied the game.
Chandler Parsons grabbed the rebound and was im-
mediately fouled.
Moments later, Parsons (14 points) stood on the foul 
line, shooting the one-and-one with a chance to ice the game for the Gators.
But the sophomore’s shot came off the front of the rim 
and fell right into the arms of Holmes.
“That’s the first time Chandler Parsons, in a college 
game, has ever been lined up at the free-throw line like that,” UF coach Billy Donovan said. “You’re going to go through things like that.”
Fredrick (15 points) slipped behind forward Dan 
Werner in the game’s final seconds to send South Carolina (13-4, 2-2 SEC) to its biggest win of the season.
All Werner could do was watch as the Gators’ perfect 
start to conference play slipped away.
“I thought we were matched up well,” Donovan said. 
“It was just a great play. It worked out perfectly for them.”
After the game, Nick Calathes (20 points) stood out-
side the UF locker room, disappointment replacing the smile he had worn only minutes earlier.
“It’s not happy (in there),” Calathes said, gesturing to 
the door that hid his teammates. “It’s not fun.”
UF turned the ball over 18 times on the night and al-
lowed the Gamecocks to hang around late. Freshman Erving Walker coughed the ball up five times.Down 7 points with 2:27 to play, South Carolina’s 
Devan Downey (20 points) scored 7 points to cut the UF lead to 69-67 with 27 seconds left.
“They made bigger plays at the end,” Calathes said.Donovan hopes the loss can serve as a rallying point 
for his young team.
“You really find out how much you care when you go 
through something like this,” Donovan said. “Hopefully this can make us a tougher team.”
The UF frontcourt that had shown so much improve-
ment in recent weeks took a step back against South Carolina.
None of the Gators’ big men scored or rebounded in 
double digits, and they failed to convert on easy baskets late in the game.
“We missed some plays around the basket,” Donovan 
said. “(Alex) Tyus had some looks inside that he should have finished.”
UF will now have three days off before it makes the trip 
to Vanderbilt on Sunday for a nationally televised game. 
“You can never be good unless you go through some 
serious heartache,” Donovan said.

layup Wednesday night at the Colonial Life Arena in Columbia, S.C.
Amanda Butler walked into the post-
game media area with orange-and-
blue Gators flip-flops flip-flopping 
with her. 
She took a seat a few feet away from me 
and then-women’s basketball beat writer 
Phil Kegler as we typed away on our laptops. 
Butler chatted away with other University 
Athletic Association workers about other teams’ chances in the NCAA Tournament 
and the games from that night.
I asked Phil if this was a normal occur -
rence and typical wardrobe selection for 
Butler. It was. 
That was the scene after UF’s 60-55 second-round Women’s National Invitation 
Tournament win 
against Florida Gulf Coast last year.
That setting, 
however, wasn’t 
typical. Most coach-
es will head for the exits, their firmly 
pressed suits and 
shined shoes going 
with them. They definitely don’t come back to the boring media area showcasing the lat-
est Gators flip-flops.Amanda Butler is one of us. A lot smarter 
and wittier than most of us, but other than that, no different than you or me.
She’ll be in Publix buying the same Fruity 
Pebbles you are. She’ll be just as excited to see the latest sales at Target as you are. She’ll 
be the same person loading up on collard 
greens next to you in the buffet line.
“You want to be around her,” Senior 
Associate Athletic Director of Women’s Sports Lynda Tealer said. “What you see 
is what you get — without a doubt. If you 
watch her on the sidelines, all that passion 
and all that — that’s who she is. There is no 
hidden Amanda Butler.”Former Gators coach Carolyn Peck is a 
wonderful person. I respect her for her al-ways-sunshine-and-rainbows attitude. She 
was prim and proper at all times. Maybe too prim and proper.
Butler, in just her second year here in 
Gainesville, has the same smarts as Peck 
and a refreshingly commonplace attitude as 
a complimentary side dish.
That’s a big part of the reason why this 
team will make the NCAA Tournament. Two years ago, this team did an impression 
of a Division II team.Butler’s refreshing attitude brings positive changes to women’s hoops team

Now, Butler has instilled a level of con-
fidence that shows glimpses of a program 
that expects to contend on the national scene 
every year. 
“A lot of that credit goes to the team 
and the individuals on the team — there’s 
no question about that,” Butler said. “As a coach, you can have this method of getting 
better or all these different motivational techniques and all these different ideas, 
but ultimately the team has to decide, ‘Hey, we’re good, and we can do this. We can win 
ballgames. We can win under these circum-stances.’”
Oh, and she’s too modest, too. Let me say this: The Gators have had talented players. Sha Brooks and Marshae Dotson — two re-
cruits from the Peck era — are two of the bet-
ter players in the Southeastern Conference. They’re a big reason why the Gators are 17-2 
and were off to the best start in program his-
tory when they were 16-1. 
So, what Butler said has some truth. 
But there’s a reason there has been no le-gitimate success in the roller-coaster four 
years in which they’ve gone from the NCAA Tournament in their first year to SEC laugh-
ingstock the next. 
They’ve missed someone who relates to 
them, someone who expects them to take ev-
ery day more seriously. 
“We want to work so hard every single 
day that by the time we get to the ballgame, we feel like we’ve earned that win,” Butler 
said.
That’s the attitude you expect from a for -
mer point guard who had just as many floor burns, bumps and bruises as assists, steals 
and 3-pointers.
There is one category that will soon 
eclipse the number of floor burns she ac-
quired, though: wins.
“We talk very positively about ourselves 
in the locker room,” Butler said. “We’re not 
afraid about talking about how good we are 
and how good we can be. We’re not wor -
ried about jinxing things. It’s pretty straight 
talk.”
Here’s some straight talk: The Gators will 
become one of the top and most consistent 
programs in the country because of Butler. She’ll start to land some of these five-star re-
cruits who used to want to visit Gainesville about as much as Bobby Bowden does. UF won’t be considered one of the “other” teams 
in the SEC after Tennessee and LSU.
And it’s likely she won’t be planning for 
any of that. She didn’t have a plan when she 
was hired. All she knew was she wanted 
this job so bad that nobody else could have wanted it more.
“She is passionate in a way about Florida 
being successful that really no one else can be,” Tealer said. “She wears that. It is hard not to get behind her. … She was going to 
will this thing forward.”
I’m just hoping Butler doesn’t get the will 
to go into sports reporting. If that happens, I’ll never get a job.BRIAN , from page 18
SANTA FE MEN’S BASKETBALL

Failure.
A loss in Mid-Florida 
Conference play is something Santa Fe College (16-5, 2-1 MFC) hasn’t experienced since Jan. 
20, 2007. Ironically enough, that 
loss two years ago also came at the hands of Central Florida Community College.
The Patriots came out on top 
Wednesday 74-71 to hand the Saints their only MFC loss on the season.  This loss is the Saints’ first in 24 consecutive conference games.
“These guys are disappointed 
and upset, and I hope it hurts,” SFC coach Chris Mowry said.  “Any time the other team plays harder than you do, you should feel bad.”
Saints sophomore guard 
Roderick Emanuel provided 24 points — 7 more than his season average — and went 77 percent from the free-throw line.
“This loss is going to help 
us,” Emanuel said.  “Maybe it is exactly what we needed. I guess we thought we were better than 
what we actually are.”
SFC sophomore guard Aaron 
Holmes was perfect from the 
free-throw line and contributed 18 points.  Freshman point guard Marlon Rivera also scored in double digits with 11. 
The last time the Saints saw 
the lead was with 16 minutes remaining in the first half. They led the Patriots 9-8 at that point before CFCC started a 10-0 scor -
ing run.
“Whoever plays the hard-
est has the best chance to win,” Mowry said.  “And that’s what happened tonight.”
The Saints are currently ranked 
No. 6 in the Florida Community College Activities Association Coaches’ Poll and will be fac-ing St. John’s River Community College on Saturday in Palatka.“Our perimeter defense con-
taining the dribble was not that great (Wednesday), and that is a strength of St. John’s,” Mowry said.  “So that is something we 
will have to work on.”
Even after a difficult loss, 
Saints fans still have faith in their 
team.
“They are a strong team this 
year,” Santa Fe student Mackenzie Fox said.  
“They just need to believe in 
themselves.”

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
FLORHAM PARK, N.J. — Making one 
bold declaration after another, Rex Ryan 
gave his vision for the New York Jets: a Super Bowl trophy and a White House visit. 
“With all the cameras and all that, I 
was looking for our new president back there,” Ryan said with a big, bright smile Wednesday, moments after being intro-duced as the team’s head coach. 
“You know,” he added, “I think we’ll get 
to meet him in the next couple years any-way.” 
Whoa! Talk about putting pressure on 
yourself. After all, this is a franchise that hasn’t been to a Super Bowl since his father, Buddy, was an assistant for the 1969 cham-pions. 
“I’m not afraid of expectations,” the 46-
year-old Ryan said. “My goal is to win a Super Bowl. It’s not to just win X number of games.” 
And that sounded like 
the perfect game plan to an excited Woody Johnson. 
“Why else are we 
here?” the Jets owner asked. “Yee-haw! That’s good.” 
Ryan, Baltimore’s de-
fensive coordinator the last four seasons, said all the right things in meeting with the media for the first time since being hired Monday to replace the fired Eric Mangini. 
“We want to be known as the most phys-ical football team in the NFL,” Ryan said. “The players will have each other’s backs, and if you take a swipe at one of ours, we’ll take a swipe at two of yours.” 
More big statements from the big man 
now in charge of turning around a fran-chise that’s parched for a title. 
After spending big bucks in the off-sea-
son, trading for Brett Favre and starting out 8-3 last season, the Jets were talked about as a potential Super Bowl team. Then came the late-season collapse in which the team lost four of its last five and stunningly missed the playoffs. 
“We expect to win,” Ryan said. “We have 
a lot of talent here that’s already in place.” 
Several of those players attended Ryan’s 
press conference, including cornerback Darrelle Revis and wide receiver Jerricho Cotchery, who wanted to get a first look at their new coach. 
“He’s relaxed and he’s not tense,” Revis 
said when asked to compare Ryan with Mangini. 
“He’s exciting and you can just tell he’s 
going to bring a lot of stuff over here that we’ll like.” 
Whether Favre is a part of this team re-
mains uncertain. 
The 39-year-old quarterback is mulling 
retirement again after tearing a biceps mus-cle and throwing nine interceptions in the Jets’ last five games. 
“I would think anybody would want 
him as their quarterback,” Ryan said, add-ing that he planned to speak to each one of the players during the next several days, including Favre.
Ryan set on transforming disappointing Jets into champs

COST CFCC THE GAME.

The Santa Fe College wom-
en’s basketball team kept the 
fans on the edge of their seats 
in its Mid-Florida Conference game against Central Florida Community College on Wednesday.
With five ties and eight lead 
changes, the game was intense until the final buzzer, when the Saints prevailed 78-75.
“The team finished well,” 
said SFC assistant coach Gary Green. “Perseverance and resil-ience are key in these close 2- to 
3-point games. The conference 
is always tough, and Central is always good competition.”
The game hinged on fouls 
and free throws, and the Saints (15-4, 4-0 MFC) stood strong at the free-throw line with a 24-16 advantage. By the end of the night, three Patriots had fouled 
out.
The SFC victory was no easy 
task. The Saints, down 35-34 at 
halftime, came out of the locker 
room strong and scored the first 
6 points of the second half.
Trailing 57-42, the Patriots 
did not go down without a fight.  Emi McCullough, Brittany 
Hardy and Markeshia Grant shot four consecutive 3-point-ers to make it a 5-point game.
With the second half quickly 
coming to a close, the game be-came a fierce battle of posses-sion for both teams. 
Each team capitalized on 
its opponent’s miscues: The Patriots scored 20 points on turnovers, and the Saints notched 30. 
CFCC’s Satoria Bell missed 
a crucial 3-pointer that would have tied the game toward the end of the second half. After 
that, the Patriots fought hard 
for every basket, but the Saints proved the strength of their of-fense by putting up another 15 points.
SFC sophomore forward 
Nichelle Glover and freshman 
guard Lanita Bartley were the 
top scorers of the night, put-ting up 19 and 17 points respec-tively. 
Bartley’s hard drives to the 
basket proved too much for the Patriots defense.
SFC — ranked No. 4 in the 
Florida Community College 
Activities Association Coaches’ 
Poll — and CFCC came in to the night tied for the top spot in the MFC, but the Saints’ win puts 
them a game ahead one-third 
of the way through conference play.

ORLANDO — Jameer Nelson 
believes the Orlando Magic is close 
to commanding almost as much 
respect as the Boston Celtics.
Really close, in fact.
“They’re a great team. We’re a 
good team,” the Magic point guard 
said. “We’re trying to get to where 
they are.”
A quick glance at the standings 
shows Orlando is rapidly closing whatever gap exists between the 
teams. When the Magic wakes up 
Thursday morning, it’ll have the best record in the NBA. Better than LeBron James and the Cleveland 
Cavaliers. Better than Kobe Bryant 
and the Los Angeles Lakers. Better than any team, period.
Finding a way to remain on that 
perch into Friday morning, well, 
that’d be a neat Magic trick.
It’s only one of 82 regular-sea-
son contests, yet there will be a dis-
tinct big-game feel for the Magic 
on Thursday night when the reign-
ing NBA champion Celtics visit 
for a matchup of teams jostling 
for the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference as well as the league’s overall best record.
Forgive Magic coach Stan Van 
Gundy if he wants no part of the inevitable hyperbole.
“I’ve said all along, and I hon-estly think it’s true: If they’ll give us two wins for the Boston game, then I’ll make it bigger than the other games,” Van Gundy said. “Otherwise, it’s not.”
At 33-8, Orlando has matched 
its franchise record for best 41-game start, has won seven straight games and is coming off a road trip where it beat all three division leaders in the Western Conference. No slouches themselves, the 
Celtics took a 34-9 record and five-
game winning streak into Miami on Wednesday night.
For the Magic, which has 
topped the 45-win mark only once in the last 12 seasons — last year at 52-30 — being part of a matchup of 
the NBA’s truly elite is uncharted 
territory. For Boston, which started 27-2 before falling off that never-before-seen pace, the defending champs know they’re a big game for every opponent, whether the best record in the East is at stake 
or not.
“Every night we play, the team 
has us circled. The trick is that we 
have to circle them back,” Celtics 
coach Doc Rivers said. “If we can 
pull that off, then we can be really good. ... We’re playing for home-court every night. Doesn’t matter who the opponent is. And that’s 
key.”
It’s the second of four games 
this year between the Celtics and 
Magic. The first one still stings 
Orlando.
The Magic leads the NBA in 
3-point percentage and 3-point-
ers made this season, yet turned in perhaps its most brutal long-
range shooting night of the year in 
Boston on Dec. 1, clanging its way to a 5-for-26 showing from beyond the arc. The result was a 107-88 
Boston romp, the largest Orlando 
loss of the season so far.
“They’re the team we’ve been 
watching,” Magic center Dwight Howard said. “The Lakers and the 
Celtics, they’re the two best teams. 
They were in the finals last year. 
“We want to be just like those 
teams. We look up to the Celtics, 
the way they play, their chemis-
try, the way they approach things on the floor. We want to become a great team like that.”20, ALLIGATOR n THURSDAY, JANUARY 22, 2009
