Gainesville police are looking for the wit-
ness of a hit-and-run accident that occurred just 
outside the O’Connell Center parking lot on Oct. 14. 
A late model, two-door Honda failed to yield 
at a stop sign before turning on to Southwest Second Avenue, causing 21-year-old Cassie Martinez to fall off her motor scooter, according to a police report. 
The driver of the Honda, 25-year-old Aman-
da Chodkowski, left the scene of the accident. 
Martinez suffered second- and third-degree road burns along the right side of her body along with additional minor bruising and cuts. 
Chodkowski denies making contact with the 
scooter, telling police that she saw the scooter wobble and fall on its own accord. 
An unidentified female witness provided 
Martinez with the license tag information for the Honda but left no contact information.
Police would like to speak with the wit-
ness. Anyone with information can contact Gainesville police at 352-334-2400.

val on Saturday at Magnolia Parke.
� ADMISSION WAS $35 AT THE GATE.

About 1,000 people sampled and chugged beer at 
the Greater Gator Beer Festival on Saturday at Mag-
nolia Parke.
For $35 at the gate, the festival offered unlimited 
samples of drinks, and local restaurants, such as Kaz-
bor’s Grille and Munegin’s on 13th, provided samples 
of food. Music was provided by DJ Phred.
Between 30 and 35 tables averaged three to five 
drink samples each, while some of the dozen or so res-taurants offered chicken wings, hot dogs and pizza.
Festival coordinator Ricki Black said the fall event 
takes places on the bye weekend every year so it doesn’t conflict with fans wanting to watch the foot-ball game.
“You’re competing for the dollar here,” she said.Another Greater Gator Beer Festival will be held in 
March at the same location, and Black expects about 3,000 attendees.
A combination of off-duty GPD officers and private 
security helped check IDs and give out wristbands.
Ted Owens, a friend of Black’s for more than 30 
years, has volunteered his security services at this fes-tival and at festivals in Orlando for seven years. 
Owens, who doesn’t drink, said the biggest secu-
rity problem occurs when people try to bring children or pets, both of which are not allowed.
Raul Prado, a 23-year-old UF alumnus, visited the 
Greater Gator Beer Festival for the first time on Sat-urday.
“It was nice to be able to drink my favorite beers 
and find new ones, too,” he said.1,000 sip, guzzle and chug at beer festival

Fabian Perez had carved pumpkins be-
fore, but before Saturday , he’d never carved 
one underwater.
Fifteen divers with the UF Gator Scuba 
Club participated in their first underwater 
pumpkin carving contest at the Blue Grotto, an underwater cavern located west of Wil-liston. 
Samiah Moustafa, president of Gator 
Scuba, said the idea was inspired by a simi-lar dive that is done every year in the Florida Keys.
“Each trip we try to do something 
unique,” she said. “Bring in the aspect of the pumpkins 
and it gets people motivat-
ed.”
For the club’s end-of-the-semester dive in 
the spring, they went to the Florida Keys. 
 “It’s so addicting,” Moustafa said. “Stress 
free, exhilarating and relaxing.”UF scuba club carves

When a Black Hawk helicopter turns, 
the 45-degree angle makes you feel like 
you’re going to fall out of the open door and into the trees.
Even when strapped into a harness 
with four buckles, when that helicopter takes off you can’t help but be a little bit afraid — especially if it’s your first time.
Cadets in UF’s ROTC program were 
able to get away from campus life and ex-perience a flight in a Black Hawk, partici-pate in a Zodiac-boat race and use night-vision goggles at a biyearly Field Training Exercise event Saturday at Camp Bland-
ing.  Sixty-eight UF cadets and 37 Univer -
sity of North Florida cadets rode in the 
helicopters.
Jordan Rosales, a UF ROTC cadet cor -poral, said the first time riding on a Black Hawk is like an insane roller coaster. 
“I’m actually very scared of heights,” 
he said. 
The helicopter flew over Camp Blan-
ding, a Florida National Guard facility about six miles east of Starke.
When it reached the drop-off point, 
a commander yelled, “Go! Go! Go!” and the cadets scrambled to unbuckle, jumped out of the helicopter and hit the dirt.

Divers from the UF Gator Scuba club carve pumpkins beneath the waters of Blue Grotto, an underwater 
cavern. The club was having its first ever contest to see who carved the best underwater pumpkin.
The contest was held at the Blue Grotto
While Kelly Williams agreed, she 
said she was relieved that the con-
test was a freshwater dive.
“I’m glad we’re not in salt water 
so sharks won’t be attracted when I 
stab myself,” she joked.
After being cleaned out and 
drawn on, three-pound weights that 
normally go in divers’ weight belts were put inside the pumpkins.
One by one, the divers jumped in from the dock, pumpkins in hand, into the cold water.
Because Blue Grotto is fed by 
a spring, the cavern water stays around 72-degrees Fahrenheit year round.
“It’s colder when you’re just sit-
ting there carving a pumpkin and not swimming around,” said An-drew Scholl, a freshman aerospace engineering major.
While the divers carved, they 
said that a snapping turtle and a cat-fish, along with other diving groups, stopped to watch them.
While half the divers carved their 
pumpkin 15 feet below the surface on a wooden platform, the others went down into the 100-foot-deep 
cavern. 
The pumpkin designs ranged 
from fish bones to smiley faces and 
from bats to scuba flags. The first place winner, out of the five win-ning designs, was a pirate skull and crossbones by freshman Sean Deeb. PUMPKIN , from page 1
used, said that part of the exercise was to train the cadets to 
get down quickly because in combat they could be fired at any moment.
Lt. Col. Bob Quint, who recruits students into the ROTC 
program, watched the cadets while they were briefed on how 
to enter and exit the helicopter — the same helicopters used in 
the mountains of Afghanistan.
He said he remembers the name of almost every cadet he’s 
recruited. He remembers their families and what high school they went to, and he tells them he’s proud of them. They come to him with problems ranging from grades to dating, and he 
listens.
Quint knows that within a year of graduation, almost every 
cadet he’s recruited who go on active duty will be 
in combat. They know that, too.
“As far as fears go, I’m not afraid of death real-
ly,” Nicole Drummond, a 23-year-old cadet said.
She said she’s afraid of spiders, though.  She found one on 
her this weekend and had to break formation to get it off.
She said in a quiet voice that she knows how to shoot pistols 
and M16 rifles.
Like most mothers, her mother is worried. She doesn’t 
want her daughter to be in danger. Her mother is supportive, 
though, and said that nothing can stop her daughter except for 
a rogue spider. 
Her father was in the Air Force, and she rode in a helicopter 
for the first time when she was 3 years old. She said she wants to go into aviation.  She finds flying exciting, and it drives her.
Quint admires his cadets for willingly entering an ROTC 
program while the country is fighting two wars. He said he hopes the recruits can still enjoy themselves while they are stu-dents.The cadets rode in a

Asian American Leaders this weekend.
The conference, also known as SERCAAL, took place Fri-
day and Saturday with opening ceremonies Friday night in 
the Reitz Union Amphitheater. 
About 200 people attended the ceremonies, which includ-

Mia Mingus, the former co-executive director of Spark 
Reproductive Justice Now in Atlanta, Ga., and the speaker who delivered the keynote address, 
talked about the different systems of oppression in society such as racism, sexism, heterosexism and homophobia. 
“I hope young people ask themselves, ‘What is the leg-
acy I have come into and what legacy do I want to leave behind?’” Mingus said. 
SERCAAL, which was established in 2004 by a group of 
UF students, is a non-profit, student-led conference that at-tempts to explore the Asian American sense of identity and 
inspire its attendees to become leaders in their communi-

The Rev. Milford Lewis Griner set up 
a 2-by-3 foot portrait of Rosa Parks at the 
Rosa Parks Regional Transit System Down-
town Station on Sunday afternoon.
The portrait served as the decoration for 
the fifth annual memorial program honor -
ing the civil rights leader.
The event, which honored Parks on the 
fifth anniversary of her death, attracted 
about 15 people.
The Rosa Parks Quiet Courage Com-
mittee, a group dedicated to educating the public about their namesake and the civil rights movement, organized the memorial.
“We want to keep her spirit alive and 
remember her legacy,” said Griner, found-er and chairman of the committee. 
Two years ago, the committee paired up with the City Commission and RTS to name 
the downtown station in honor of Parks. 
“It’s pretty symbolic,” said Chip Skin-
ner, spokesman for RTS. “She was a hero 
for all Americans, and it’s an honor to have her name attached to this station.”
The program featured prayers and 
hymns voiced in honor of Parks. 
A wreath of orange, 
red, white and blue flow-
ers was laid at the station as a moment of silence was taken to mourn her passing.
“What she did, that 
simple action, it changed 
the whole nation,” Griner said. “She sat down on a city bus and motivated the na-
tion to stand for justice.”

Rainbow-colored flags adorned Bo 
Diddley Community Plaza downtown Sat-
urday, as an estimated 4,000 people came through for the gay pride festival “PrideFest 2010.”
“If you look around, you’ve got drag 
queens, lesbians, gays, older gays, college students, gay allies and families coming out to support their kids,” said Daniel Jones, who, when performing as a drag queen, goes by the name Miss Conception. 
Vendors at the festival were selling pride-
related items such as rainbow-colored stud-ded belts and earrings with double-male and double-female symbols. 
Various acts took the stage throughout 
the afternoon and into the evening, includ-ing musical acts and drag dancers. 
Several of the drag dancers were winners 
of amateur drag night at University Club, Jones said. 
Between performances, two women, 
backed by techno music, stood onstage tossing rainbow-colored flags onto the plaza field, caus-ing a stir as people scrambled to 
retrieve the prizes.
It wasn’t just members of the LGBT com -
munity who showed up to celebrate. 
The event, part of the 2010 Pride Days, 
was put on by the non-profit Pride Commu-nity Center of North Central Florida.

STATE SENATE
By JERRY BRUNO
Alligator Contributing Writer
Gainesville’s state Senate can-
didates, Perry McGriff and Steve 
Oelrich, are slinging mud over negative attack ads. 
On Thursday afternoon Oelrich, 
the incumbent Republican, sent an open letter to McGriff asking him to agree to an “immediate and mu-tual cease and desist of all negative campaign advertisements for the duration of this campaign.”
Oelrich’s letter came after McG-
riff took legal action over an attack advertisement endorsed by Oel-
rich on Oct. 17.
The McGriff campaign accused 
Oelrich and the Republican Party 
of Florida of purposefully distort-ing his position on immigration. 
But in his letter Oelrich wrote, 
“Perry, let’s show leadership and respect for our community that we love so much and end this spir -
ited campaign on a very positive note.”
McGriff wrote back later in the afternoon, “I will agree to close the 
campaign on a positive note, if you 
are willing to come clean and pub-licly recant and denounce the lies that have been said about me dur -
ing this campaign.”
One of the claimed lies McGriff 
was referring to was a mailer sent out by Oelrich’s campaign that said, “McGriff voted against more 
than $50 million dollars in funding 
for health care 
for abused and 
neglected chil-dren.”
In reality, 
McGriff voted against the Flor -
ida budget, not 
on particular line 
items in the bud-
get like funding for abused and ne-glected children, said Jason Roth, McGriff’s campaign manager.  
“McGriff voted against the bud-
get because it was filled with spe-cial interest pork, and it included massive cuts to education and 
health care spending,” Roth said.  But David Wolfson, of OSI Re-
search & Consulting and a political 
consultant for Oelrich, said McG-riff is the one who needs to apolo-gize for the negative ads.
“We ran our campaign on the 
candidate’s record,” Wolfson said. “Perry McGriff started these nega-tive ads and refuses to take them down.” 
Oelrich responded to McGriff’s 
letter on Friday and wrote, “I am in receipt of your letter refusing to end your negative campaign and issuing yet more personal at-tacks.”
Oelrich’s letter goes on further 
and says, “In a show of good faith, I have unilaterally suspended all 
television advertisements you may 
refer to as negative.”
But Roth said it’s nothing more 
than a political stunt.
He believes McGriff is doing 
what’s right for the community by running for Senate.
“Lying is not a quality that peo-
ple of District 14 want or deserve 
in their state senator,” Roth said.Race heats up over attack ads

The Twitter account boasts 195 tweets and 955 followers. 
The Facebook page counts 5,321 people who “like” it.  Yet UF’s 
Student Alumni Association still has not seen the expected turnout for its “Beat” Hunger campaign.
“We haven’t had that great of a response from it,” said Dan-
ielle Tubbs, community service co-chair for The Florida Cicerones. 
Tubbs said while the community donated 552 
pounds of food last year, this year’s turnout so far has been significantly less. 
This is SAA’s third year running the “Beat” Hunger cam-
paign, which is a food drive for Gainesville’s less fortunate, Tubbs said. Anyone can donate canned and nonperishable food items at Murphree Commons, the Emerson Alumni Hall 
Welcome Center and in line for “Beat” game day T-shirts. 
Tubbs said Cicerones began collecting cans Sept. 24 in line 
for the Kentucky-game “Beat” T-shirts. The campaign is sched-
uled to end Oct. 31, but it may be extended to collect more cans, Tubbs said.Food drive suffers

Today’s question: Is the rent “too damn  high”?
136 TOTAL VOTES22% PRIDE FEST
49% BEER FEST29% BOOK SALEFriday’s question: Which 
event are you looking forward to most this weekend?
In one of the most nationally coveted Senate seats, Flor -
ida’s race has turned into a three-ring circus with three 
unusually well-qualified candidates actively challeng-
ing the dominant two-party bipolarity. 
Well, kind of. As Republican Sen. George Lemieux, a man appointed 
to the Senate by Gov. Charlie Crist to simply finish off the 
term and not run again because Crist would soon be run-
ning for that very seat, leaves office, the race for Florida’s 
Senate seat has the nation’s eyes on it as our now-indepen-dent governor tries to fight back from Republican suicide 
and seize the Senate seat he created for himself. 
But we just don’t trust him. 
After leaving his party following Republican darling 
and former Speaker of the Florida House Marco Rubio’s political ascension, our No. 1 tanned man in Tallahassee gives an entirely new meaning to flip-flopping. 
We need a senator whom we can trust in Washington. 
We need someone who has a clear history of fighting for Floridians and doing what’s right. We don’t need another 
politician telling us what he thinks will win more votes. 
In short, we need Congressman Kendrick Meek. 
Meek has a history of leadership in a career field devoid 
of constituent interest. As a state senator in 2002, Meek fought for the class-size-reduction amendment that vot-ers passed and still have not seen fully instituted. In fact, 
Meek’s support for education has earned him an A grade 
consistently since 2003 from the National Education As-sociation. 
Meek’s support for education and college-aged concerns 
can also be seen in his frequent visits to the UF campus, a number of visits that far outshine any of his competitors. 
Congressman Meek opposes offshore drilling, which is 
something we have no idea if Gov. Crist supports as he changes his mind on the issue to whatever best suits his 
political interests, and Meek’s other opponent, Rubio, sup-
ports more offshore drilling.
Rubio’s support for offshore drilling is particularly 
problematic as he called the Deepwater Horizon disaster “horrifying” while continuing to push for more drilling.
Call us crazy, but if something is “horrifying,” we 
should probably do everything in our power to not let it happen again.
Like support greater pledges for renewable energy, 
which Meek does. 
Furthermore, Meek’s support for civil rights for women 
and LGBT Americans is unmatched by his opponents. 
Congressman Meek’s plan to shrink the enormous na-
tional debt involves both supporting the national health care reform, which would cut the deficit by $1.2 trillion 
during the next 10 years, and ending the wars in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, which would save $1 million for every U.S. soldier, according to Meek. 
Although we feel Florida sets itself apart from the coun-
try this year in offering its citizens a viable three-way race with three candidates who all have a proven track record 
of political success, Rubio just leans too far right for com-
promise, and that scares us. Our governor has not proven he will support issues consistently, and we need someone 
who speaks up for what’s right at all times and not just 
times it will benefit him politically.
For the race for U.S. Senate, he Alligator endorses Con-
gressman Kendrick Meek.We want Meek

Florida’s spending is out of control
When most people know they’re running a little 
short on money, they tend to be more careful with it – buy less expensive things and cut 
out anything they don’t absolutely need. So why does this  simple idea seem so difficult for our government to grasp?
Everywhere we turn we see the government wasting 
money in a time of economic crisis, and now we have one more glowing example of waste in our Sunshine State in the form of a $48 million courthouse. 
The courthouse being built in Tallahassee has been 
dubbed by many as the “Taj Mahal” courthouse because 
of its lavish furnishings. The judges of the 1st District 
Court of Appeals took control of the project and scoped out designs for their blinged-out playpen by going on visits to courthouses around the country equaling about 
$15,200 in expenses. The Florida Department of Finan-
cial Services’ audit of the courthouse expressed concern that some of the travel may have been funded by tax-payers. 
The weirdest thing about all of this, other than the 
approximately 20 miles of African mahogany wood purchased for the project, is the money was originally appropriated to expand the court’s existing building. Instead, the judges used the money to pay architects to 
plan out a new building. 
I know judges are supposed to interpret legislation, 
but I don’t think this is what the Founding Fathers had 
in mind. 
Even when the building of a new courthouse was ap-
proved, the judges took it upon themselves to make the project far more expensive than their budget allowed by adding lavish furnishings including etched glass, custom fixtures and a granite trim throughout the building. The judges’ extras not only increased 
the size of the building by 20,000 
square feet, but they also increased the cost of the building by about $15 million to make the grand total 
more than $48 million. 
In the state-conducted audit, 
officials found 17 violations during the building of the 
courthouse. One of the state laws that was violated was the lack of seeking competitive bids to drive down the 
price, something that is required for construction of any 
buildings whose costs exceed $500,000. The building also violated state laws that only permit spending of $100,000 on artwork for new buildings. 
It’s not just the judges who are to blame, though, as 
many top-level government officials did nothing to stop the project.
In fact, e-mails between the judges labeled former 
Speaker of the Florida House Marco Rubio as among 
their “heroes” of the project. Gov. Charlie Crist was the 
one who signed the appropriations, which were strange-ly hidden deep in a transportation bill, and never called them into question. 
Wasting money like this in times of deep financial 
crisis is a stain upon our state — a stain we do not need with our low-ranked education system and high unem-ployment rate. 
But it’s nothing new for a state that is close to  elect-
ing a corrupt former CEO as its governor.

If you’re a full-time UF student, chances are you’ll be paying 
for a class you’re not taking next semester. It may sound counterintuitive, but a new proposal in front of the State 
University System’s Board of Governors, the governing au-thority overseeing public higher education in Florida, would 
allow the UF administration to charge full-time students a flat 
fee for tuition regardless of the number of credit hours they take. So, for example, if you’re like the many UF students who take 12 credit hours each semester, you’ll be charged for 15 credit hours. On the flipside, if you take 15 or 18 credit hours a semester, you won’t notice a change in your tuition bill and could even save money . 
Past and present administration officials have viewed block 
tuition as a means to an end: The university needs money . One 
way to pay the bills is by providing an incentive for students 
to take more credit hours and graduate early while receiving a nice financial surplus from students who continue to take 12 credit hours and who are essentially fined. 
I don’t envy the job university administrators across Florida 
are facing. In a depressed economic environment that has seen waning financial support for higher education, university offi-cials have had to grapple with shrinking budgets. Hard choices have been made, and more will have to be made. 
Yet block tuition is the wrong 
choice. 
First of all, it is instinctively unfair to pay for a class you’re 
not taking.  Furthermore, there are potential unintended con-sequences of the university imposing a de facto fine on stu-dents who already struggle to excel in classes while balancing both part-time and full-time jobs that are necessary to pay for the rising costs of higher education and extracurricular, civic and spiritual activities, which are even more necessary today as graduate schools tighten admission standards. As anyone who’s had to fight ISIS for a seat in a much-needed class can at-
test, our classes are large enough. Imagine, though, how much 
harder it will be to get that seat as more students collectively add another class to their schedule each semester. Imagine, just for a moment, how less fulfilling our campus life will become as more students are pushed to take more classes, using time and effort otherwise used to start new campus organizations that enrich the UF and Gainesville community. I implore my fellow students to make our voices heard, and 
I’m grateful the UF Student Senate has signaled it will vote on a resolution condemning block tuition at its next meeting this Tuesday. A few friends and I have decided to make sure our peers have another avenue to make their voices heard to the 
Board of Governors and have started a petition drive to be pre-
sented to Board members when they meet at UF on Nov. 3 and 4. 
You can make your voice louder by joining together with 
other students who have already signed the petition, conve-niently located on campus on Turlington Plaza. Additionally, we’ve started a Facebook page, (www.facebook.com/stop-blocktuition), where students can learn more about the issue and voice their opposition to the proposal by signing an online 
petition. 
As we all well know, being a member of The Gator Nation 
is so much more than just taking classes. As numerous UF pro-
motional brochures affirm, The Gator Nation is a community that values campus and community involvement. Together, let’s make sure UF continues to honor this value.

Speaking Out
For most students, college life is a bal-
ancing act among academic demands, social pursuits, and employment. And 
it often seems that there is just not enough time in the day to get everything accom -
plished. Thus, many of us steal time from one of our most important daily activities in an attempt to shorten our lengthy “to do” lists. This daily “necessity” has been shown to impact cognitive performance, mood, car -
diovascular health, hormone secretion af-fecting metabolism, and the body’s immune system. While browsing my Facebook news-feed the other morning, I came upon a status 
update that seemed to best embody the re-
lationship between the overworked college student and this frequently undervalued physiological requirement – “Sleep is over -
rated. Who needs sleep anyway?”
It’s a good question, and perhaps in or -
der to answer it, we should begin with a discussion of sleep regulation. The National Sleep Foundation (hereafter NSF, not to be 
confused with the National Science Foun-dation) has released a booklet entitled the 
“Sleep-Wake Cycle: Its Physiology and Im-pact on Health.” The following information is a more college-relevant summary and in-terpretation of their explanation.
The sleep-wake cycle, “which consists 
of roughly eight hours of nocturnal sleep and 16 hours of daytime wakefulness in humans,” is governed by sleep homeostasis and circadian rhythms. Homeostasis is the body’s way of keeping internal conditions, such as temperature, fairly constant, and scientists know that sleep is also controlled in a homeostatic manner. Essentially, once 
you wake up, your body begins to accrue a 
drive for sleep. The longer you stay awake, the greater this drive becomes. At a certain point, it grows so strong that you cannot help but close your eyes. It’s similar to spending time at your favorite pub. The longer you sit at the bar, the more your tab increases, and eventually you must pay back what you owe. Just like the monetary value on your 
bill is a measure of your debt, it is believed that the amount of 
the chemical ad-enosine in your blood may help 
your body to monitor your “sleep deficit.”
As the NSF explains, “Thus the homeo-
static system tends to make us sleepier as time goes on throughout the waking period, regardless of whether it’s night or day, while the circadian system tends to keep us awake as long as there is daylight, prompting us to sleep as soon as it becomes dark.
Because of the complexity of this interac-
tion, it is generally agreed that sleep qual-
ity and restfulness are best when the sleep 
schedule is regularly synchronized to the internal circadian rhythms and that of the external light-dark cycle – when we try to go to bed and wake up at around the same time each day, even on days off and weekends.”
Now that we have an understanding of 
the physiological underpinnings of sleep, it is time to explore its significance and influ-
ence. What issues arise when you skimp on sleep? Is there any scientific support for the 
importance of a good night’s rest before an exam? In an e-mail, Joe Burdo, a professor in the biology department, said, “Even though sleep has been intensely studied for decades, 
we still don’t know exactly why we need 
to sleep. We do know that a lack of sleep causes memory, attention, and coordination problems, similar to those seen with alcohol intoxication. It does appear that sleep is cru-cial for memory consolidation, which means that the signaling pathways between our neurons that encode our important memo -
ries from that day grow stronger. This has 
practical implications for students trying to 
learn new and complex information. If you try to stay up all night and cram for a test, by skipping sleep altogether or just getting a few hours, you’ll end up forgetting a lot of what you tried to learn. You’re much better off ‘sleeping on it’ for a full night to let those memories solidify in your mind,” he said.

TEEING OFF WITH TYLER JETT SCOREBOARD GATORS IN THE NFLSaj Guevara / Alligator 
Sophomore McKenzie Barney scored a goal in the 68th minute to help Florida pull away from Arkansas 
in the second half Sunday.
 UF WILL PLAY SOUTH 
CAROLINA FOR SEC TITLE
By JESSE SIMONTON
Alligator Writer
 
A solid victory and a capper to 
an undefeated home slate usually 
leaves a team chipper.
Not the No. 12 Gators. 
Florida (14-2-2, 8-1-1 South-
eastern Conference) defeated Ar -
kansas (5-10, 2-6-2 SEC) 3-1 in the 
final regular-season home match, 
its 15th consecutive victory against 
the Razorbacks. 
Although the Gators possessed 
the dominant record, their play Sunday afternoon was far from 
overpowering. Florida labored to 
score goals despite dominating time of possession and forcing Ar -
kansas to chase the ball. 
“It was a tough game to play 
because Arkansas was giving us a lot of time, and unfortunately we were taking it,” coach Becky Bur -
leigh said. “We needed to push the 
pace a little more. We were a bit 
unlucky a couple of times. Maybe if some of those go in it feels a little less frustrating.”
Florida, which finished the 2010 home schedule 9-0 with a 31-6 goal aggregate, was again plagued by 
its failure to connect on the final 
pass. While the Gators controlled the ball nearly the entire game, they out-shot the Razorbacks just 
12-9. 
The Gators took an early lead 
(15th minute) off a great corner 
kick from Tahnai Annis. The in-swinging ball eluded four maroon 
shirts in the box before bouncing 
right to Holly King, who headed the ball in for her first goal of the season.
“It feels great [to finally score a 
goal],” King said. “I’m always so close to getting one but never ac-tually get it in, so it was good to finally get one.”Gators down Razorbacks despite problems finishing

Coach Buddy Alexander said he 
was surprised by his team’s hot start 
this season.
It would appear those days are over, 
though, as the No. 3 Gators cooled off during the first round of the Isleworth Collegiate Invitational in Windermere, Fla., on Sunday.  
UF shot a 17-over-par 305 to open 
in 12th place, 15 shots behind tourna-ment co-leaders Stanford and Texas Christian. The par-72, 7,544-yard layout showed its teeth early, as the Gators were 9 over and had just two birdies after nine holes. 
Playing a difficult course, Alexan-
der said he expected the scoring to be higher this week. But surely he could not have envisioned the start UF had 
Sunday. 
“We just didn’t play 
well,” Alexander said. “But we have a chance to pick it up and do a little better tomorrow. 
Someone has to step up and nobody did today.”

With no Friday match this weekend, 
Florida had ample time to prepare for Sun-
day’s showing against Kentucky.
The extra rest proved helpful as the No. 
1 Gators (18-1, 11-0 Southeastern Confer -
ence) defeated the Wildcats (11-11, 5-7 SEC) 
in straight sets 3-0 (25-21, 28-26, 25-13).
The Gators have won both meetings this 
season against their SEC foe. They defeated the Wildcats in Lexington, Ky., 3-1 (18-25, 25-19, 25-13, 25-20) on Sept. 17.
“I thought Kentucky came in here, 
played really loose and played hard,” coach Mary Wise said. “There were some good rallies early on. I don’t know that the 
first two sets were necessarily great volley-
ball execution and we didn’t see that until the third set.”
Although the Gators won the first two 
sets, they did not play their best. During that stretch, the Gators were outhit and 
out-blocked—Kentucky hit .333 and .276 
with five total blocks; the Gators hit .312 and .226 with only one block.
“It was kind of like which team was go-
ing to make the fewer number of errors, but that’s rally scoring,” Wise said. “Unforced 
errors are magnified be-cause of rally scoring and 
I have to give credit to 
Kentucky. Up until the 
third set, they were toe-to-toe with us.”
The deciding set was a 
different story. Florida hit .611 with five blocks and 
held Kentucky to a hitting percentage of -.100 and zero blocks.
“In basketball, play looks so much 
cleaner when the shots are going in,” Wise said. “In volleyball, it looks so much clean-er when they’re clean kills.”Florida sweeps Kentucky

Senior outside hitter Callie Rivers hit .375 with eight kills, six digs and a 
service ace as Florida swept Kentucky 3-0 (25-21, 28-26, 25-13). 
Murphy records 12 kills, 16 assists and two blocks
The Gators finished the day with a .346 
hitting percentage while the Wildcats fin-
ished at .207.
“When we block balls, that is when we 
are at our best,” Wise said. “If we are not getting touches on the block, we’re not as good in the back row. So what we need to 
do is be really good in the front row all the 
time.”
Senior outside hitter Callie Rivers hit .375 
with eight kills, six digs and a service ace.
“In between games two and three, we 
really sat down and talked about what we needed to work on and improve on for that next game because we didn’t feel like we were playing at our true potential,” Rivers 
said. “We just tried to focus on the things 
that, if we did better, it would help us win.”
Junior setter Kelly Murphy came up big  
for the Gators, as usual. Murphy hit .526 
with 12 kills, 16 assists and two blocks.
Senior libero Erin Fleming recorded a 
match-high 12 digs and freshman setter 
Chanel Brown had 18 assists and two ser -
vice aces — both team-highs.
“In the first two sets, we were missing 
plays that we should have made,” Rivers said. “Kentucky obviously played really, re-ally well, but there were also things that we 
thought that we could correct. In the third 
set, we really tried to think about what we’d worked on the past three days in practice and implement those things.”VOLLEYBALL , from page 14
Club. Vongvanij began with eight straight 
pars before recording a bogey at the 443-yard, par-4 ninth hole to make the turn at 1 over. 
Two more bogeys at 10 and 12 dropped 
Vongvanij to 3 over, but the senior added two birdies over his last six holes to creep back toward even par.
Coming into the week, Tyler McCum-
ber had just one over-par round through 
two tournaments, but the sophomore add-
ed to that total Monday with a 4-over 76. 
The sophomore made back-to-back bo-
geys at holes 5 and 6 before adding a birdie 
at 8 to make the turn at 1 over. However, 
McCumber added bogeys at 10, 13 and 18 
to drop his score further into the black.
Tommy Mou battled for a 2-over 38 
on the front nine, but one birdie wasn’t 
enough to recover from 
four more bogeys on the 
back. Mou shot a 5-over 77, good for 43rd indi-vidually.
Both Phillip Choi and 
Michael Furci got off to bad starts and could not bounce back. Choi had a 
bogey, double-bogey start, and Furci bo-
geyed the first before carding a quadru-
ple-bogey 9 at the par-5 third hole. Choi 
finished with a 6-over 78. Furci was one shot worse at 7-over 79.
The Gators don’t have a golfer in the 
individual top 20 for the first time this sea-son.  
They are playing without senior An-
dres Echavarria, but Alexander said that shouldn’t be an excuse for the team’s poor play. 
“We can’t blame Andres for that,” Alex-
ander said. “He is one of our better play-ers, but it shouldn’t affect the way any of the rest of the guys played.”Gators fail to 
place golfer in top 20 
GOLF , from page 14
Chapman, Barney put game away with second-half goals
In the second half, the Gators looked 
to come out charging. Minutes in, Erika 
Tymrak took the reins as she carved the 
entire Razorbacks defense and nearly 
scored a goal. Tymrak’s blast hit the crossbar, but the attack appeared to be a sign of things to come for Florida.
However, about sixty seconds later, a 
lull in play allowed Arkansas to tie the game as the Gators defense fell asleep and got stretched too wide.
Razorback Ally Atkins made a nice 
diagonal run from the right sideline, and received a great slip pass, finishing with 
a tough shot near post. 
Determined not to lose to a team 
merely playing for pride, the Gators 
didn’t panic and took the lead for good 10 minutes later. 
In the 63rd minute, An-
nis just missed a diving header on a cross from the right sideline. But the ball 
trickled to the back of the 
box, where Taylor Tra-
vis was positioned. Travis flicked the ball back to wide-open teammate Sarah Chapman, who drilled a low liner inside the right post.  Five minutes (68th min-
ute) later, Florida scored again on a nice 
team play that saw five players touch the ball before it went into the back of the net. 
McKenzie Barney scored the goal, her 
10th of the season, off another assist by Travis. 
“We went into halftime thinking it is 
unacceptable we’re up just 1-0,” Barney 
said. “It just started clicking more in the 
second half. We let down for 10 minutes and they took advantage of it. We can’t do that ever, so hopefully we learned our lesson from that.” SOCCER , from page 14

After three days of competition, the sin-
gles and doubles finals at the ITA Southeast 
Regional will be filled with nothing but 
Gators. 
Florida had perhaps its best display 
of individual and team play of the fall as 
freshmen Alex Cercone and Olivia Janow-icz plowed through the quarterfinals and 
semifinals, setting up a Gator-on-Gator 
singles final.
Cercone continued her impressive play, 
picking up two more straight-set wins. She 
defeated Maho Kowase of Georgia in the 
quarterfinals (6-3, 7-6 (5)) before taking down Kowase’s teammate Cameron Ellis (6-4, 6-3).
Janowicz defeated freshman teammate 
Sofie Oyen in three sets (6-2, 6-7 (1), 6-1)   
before making quick work of Florida State’s 
Katie Rybakova (6-3, 6-4).
 “We saw some excellent play from our 
freshmen,” coach Roland Thornqvist said. 
“We knew our freshmen were talented, but 
they really answered the bell today.” 
In doubles action, the team of Joanna 
Mather and Caroline Hitimana defeated 
Miami’s top duo of Bianca Eichkorn and Anna Bartenstein while Allie Will and 
Oyen also won their semifinals match. 
Finals play begins Monday at 3 p.m.
Cercone will face Janowicz in the sin-
gles final while Mather/Hitimana will face Will/Oyen in the doubles final.The winner of each match will play in 
the USTA/ITA National Intercollegiate In-door Championships next week.
Men’s Tennis: The Gators’ Sekou 
Bangoura Jr. saw his impressive run come 
to an end at the USTA/ITA Southeast Regional Championships when he 
lost in the semifinals Sun-day. 
Bangoura began the 
day with a straight-sets 
quarterfinal upset of the tournament’s No. 1 seed, Guillermo Gomez of 
Georgia Tech.
In each set, Bangoura broke serve 
at 5-5, eventually winning both  7-5. Gomez is the No. 4-ranked player  in  
the country, and Bangoura’s victory is an encouraging sign for the Gators.  
But in the semifinals, Bangoura lost in 
straight sets (6-3, 6-2) against No. 43 Clint 
Bowles of Florida State. 
Coach Andy Jackson was pleased with 
Bangoura’s play and is hoping he can con-
tinue to improve as he prepares for the spring season.
Andrew Butz and Bob van Overbeek 
also made quarterfinal appearances, but both lost.
Although no UF players advanced to the 
finals, senior Alexandre Lacroix will play in the USTA/ITA National Collegiate Indoor 
Championships in New York on Nov. 4. 
Lacroix qualified for the tournament 
after reaching the quarterfinals at the ITA
