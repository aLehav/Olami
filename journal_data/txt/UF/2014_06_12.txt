The UF Health Shands 
Children’s Hospital has been 
ranked among the nation’s best children’s hospitals this year, according to a new U.S. News 
& World Report list.
The annual report of pediat-
ric centers was released Tues-
day and evaluated 116 hospi-tals. The hospitals were then ranked in 10 specialty areas, and the top 50 hospitals with the highest scores were listed in each of these specialties. Shands 
Children’s Hospital was ranked 
among the top 50 in seven of the 10 specialty areas.
“These rankings speak to the 
prominence that the University of Florida has nationally,” said Dr. Scott Rivkees, chairman of the department of pediatrics in the UF College of Medicine. “It shows that how we are con-tinuing to excel and improve in this very important part of the UF mission,” he said.
The hospital’s rankings are 
especially impressive as it is a 
relatively small program com-
pared with the larger hospitals listed on the report, he said.
“There’s no other program 
in the United States of our size that has ranked as high as we did across the board,” he said.
The hospital was ranked 
No. 14 in diabetes and endo-
crinology, No. 27 in cardiology 
and heart surgery, No. 34 in gastroenterology, No. 35 in pul-monology, No. 36 in neonatol-ogy, No. 41 in cancer and No. 41 in nephrology.
Of these seven, the hospital 
was ranked higher in ﬁ  ve spe-cialties compared to last year.

Local police identiﬁ  ed a UF student on Wednesday af-
ter back-to-back public masturbation incidents earlier in 
the week.
Gainesville Police ﬁ  led a sworn complaint for lewd acts 
against 18-year-old UF student Eric Cody Moxam after a joint investigation with University Police, according to a UF emergency notiﬁ  cation.  A female student called UPD on 
Wednesday after she witnessed Moxam masturbating while sitting on a bench near Little Hall on Tuesday around 11:30 
a.m., according to the notiﬁ  cation. 
Gainesville Police also responded on 
Monday to reports of Moxam allegedly 
masturbating near Sorority Row, accord-
ing to the notiﬁ  cation.
Moxam has not responded to multiple requests to com-
ment. The woman who reported the incident to UPD said 
Moxam sat next to her on the bench for about 10 minutes after which she noticed him masturbating. She then left the area.
UPD ﬁ  led a sworn complaint against Moxam for lewd/
lascivious acts as well as trespassing Moxam from cam-pus, according to the notiﬁ  cation.
“He’s trespassed from campus,” said UF spokeswom-
an Janine Sikes, meaning Moxam cannot attend class or 
set foot on campus for an undetermined amount of time.

The Stephen C. O’Connell Center will get 
a $45 million face-lift next year, UF and the 
University Athletic Association announced Tuesday.
The UAA will contribute $35 million and 
UF will ﬁ  nance the rest of the renovation, which is set to begin in March and end in De-cember of 2015, said O’Connell Center Direc-tor Lynda Reinhart.
“The scope of the project is going to be 
gutting the whole building, renovating it with new seats, new club seating and a club lounge,” said Bahar Armaghani, assistant di-rector and project manager for UF’s Ofﬁ  ce of 
Planning, Design and Construction.
The renovation will also bring in a new 
high-deﬁ  nition video board hung in the center 
as well as an updated sound system.However, Armaghani said the main reno-
vation will be a prominent entryway facing east toward the James W. “Bill” Heavener Football Complex.
Located between gates one and two, the new entrance will expand into an open circu-lation area with additional concession stands, ticketing and retail sales areas.
Reinhart said there are currently four entry 
points but none of them are distinct. She said 
the funding will give the center a more mod-
ernized look.
But not all changes are cosmetic.Internal improvements like plumbing ren-
ovations and electrical rewiring will improve comfort and reduce energy consumption, Re-inhart said.$45 million in renovations to the O’Connell Center

Mark Amox, the executive director for UF 
Health Shands Children’s Hospital, attributes this 
jump in rankings to the hospital’s awareness of and dedication to areas that need improvement.
“The key for us is that we recognize that this is 
a journey. It’s an evolution,” Amox said. “Our goal is to continue to move forward and to continue to set the bar higher and higher every year.”Kerry Caputo, a 21-year-old UF biology senior, 
works as a student volunteer at Shands through the Streetlight program, which partners volunteers with chronically ill teenage patients. Caputo cites the excellent personal care and compassion of the staff and volunteers as one of the reasons the hos-
pital has achieved these national rankings.
Like a sports team victory, these new rankings 
offer the UF community another reason to cel-
ebrate its school.
“It’s another source of pride,” Caputo said.4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JUNE 12, 2014

A Gainesville man was arrested 
on Wednesday after allegedly hav-
ing 14 grams of weed in his car, along with prescription pills.
Police arrested 26-year-old Theo-
dore White on charges of possession of a controlled substance, possession of less than 20 grams of weed, not having a valid driver’s license and leaving the scene.
White was driving a car eastbound 
on West University Avenue and hit another car, creating about $3,000 in damage to the car, according to 
a police report. White did not stop 
and continued driving eastbound on West University Avenue.An ofﬁ  cer located the car White 
was driving at the Gainesville Re-gional Airport.
After questioning, White told 
ofﬁ  cers he drove the car but said a car backed into his. A records check showed that White did not currently have a valid driver’s license, accord-ing to the report.
An ofﬁ  cer saw a plastic baggie con-
taining 14 grams of weed laying on the driver’s ﬂ  oorboard. Underneath the weed baggie, an ofﬁ  cer found a small plastic baggie containing tab-lets later found to be Xanax pills.
After questioning, White admit-
ted to possession of the weed and 25 Xanax pills. White said he uses them both for personal use.
Ofﬁ  cers booked him into the 
Alachua County Jail about 1:15 a.m. on Wednesday. He was released Wednesday at about 12:25 p.m.Man allegedly hit car,

By how much, Reinhart 
couldn’t say. Project managers 
have yet to choose a design team that will ﬁ  nalize the sketch and create a more detailed timeline.
Two-time All-American and 
one-time All-SEC UF swimmer Lindsey McKnight said the cen-ter could use the renovation.
“For some of the big dual 
meets, people end up standing on the sides just because there’s not enough room for seating,” she said.
The 20-year-old UF political 
science junior said she’s espe-cially looking forward to the new chairs.
“I’ve known people to even 
bring seat cushions ‘cause they’re 
sitting there for so long,” she 
said.
During the 10 months of 
renovation, no one will be sitting there.
Reinhart said UF is planning to relocate practices and concerts during that time but has yet to se-cure a space.
In order to be completed by 
the December 2015 deadline, the project is slated to begin in March. If the design team agrees, it will begin even earlier, Rein-hart said.
“We’re looking at every op-
portunity that we have to make it as efﬁ  cient as we can,” she said. “It’s gonna be a great project, and we’re going to have a great prod-uct when it’s ﬁ  nished.”

An activist group is trying 
to push the Princeton Review 
to include information on sexual assault in its rankings, but members of the UF com-
munity disagree. 
The activist group, Ultra-
Violet, is asking the Princeton 
Review to survey students about how their schools are dealing with sexual violence on campus, according to the group’s website.
“The Princeton Review is 
simply not equipped to take on the task accurately,” said Rita Lawrence, an interper-sonal violence prevention coordinator for GatorWell Health Promotion Services. “The way that they do sur-veys, they send it out, and the responses they get on average 
is 333. Is it reliable to say that 
333 people are representative of a campus of 50,000?”
The fear is that students 
may also use these rankings to avoid schools with poor rank-ings in the hopes of avoiding sexual violence, rather than informing themselves about the pervasive nature of sexual violence, Lawrence said.
Consistency is another 
concern, said Associate Dean of Students Chris Loschiavo.
His concerns stem from 
questions about how the Princeton Review would make sure the surveys would fairly compare a variety of fac-tors among universities, such as campus size and resources.
“Unless they come up with 
a fair system of being able to ﬁ  gure out how to track and then evaluate the rankings, I don’t know that it’s going to make a lot of sense,” Loschia-vo said. “You’re not compar-ing apples to apples.”
While the consensus is the 
Princeton Review may not be the proper avenue for these requests to have the desired impact, Diamond Delancy, a 19-year-old UF public rela-tions junior and president of the Women’s Student As-sociation, believes that the 
real beneﬁ  t of this request is 
the increased dialogue about ending sexual violence.
“It may seem radical, but 
it’s been a long time coming,” said Delancy, who herself was a victim of sexual assault. 
“I think they’re doing what 
they think is best, and they’re 
trying to ﬁ  nd an answer for a 
question that’s been ignored for a really long time,” she  said.

Gainesville 3-D tech startup 
Paracosm won second place 
and $50,000 at this year’s CAT5 
Awards Competition in Orlando. 
For the competition, which 
took place June 3,  Paracosm fo-
cused on the mechanical, electri-
cal and plumbing industry’s use 
of its product. 
“There are so many inefﬁ  cien-
cies, structural errors that happen simply because people don’t have 
good data and information about 
existing buildings,” said business development team member Gan-non Wilder. “With our device, 
they are able to go and scan the 
places... so in the future, it really reduces labor inefﬁ  ciencies and 
other kinds of errors.” 
Paracosm plans to use the 
CAT5 prize money to further 
grow the company, hoping to increase customers and improve 
technology. 
The company  provides 3-D 
capture and reconstruction tech-
nologies. Its product applications range from creating spatial intel-ligence for robots to using 3-D 
models for renovation projects. 
“Paracosm’s team has an ex-
citing aesthetic edge, which is 
rare for folks who are very good at technology development,” said 
Andrea Wesser, associate direc-
tor of the University of Central Florida Venture Accelerator.
Hysence Technology took 
home the $100,000 ﬁ  rst place prize, according to the Space Florida website, one of the spon-sors of the competition.
Paracosm is currently work-
ing on pilot projects with the U.S. Department of Transportation in Washington, D.C., and with NASA’s Virginia facility. Its next 
target market is  forensics and the 
recreation of crime scenes.Local startup Paracosm wins $50KSexual assault

Clearing the air: 
Monday’s coitus 
interruptus column
On Monday, the Alligator ran a column titled “‘Pull and 
pray’: Yay or Nay?” singing the praises of the pull-out 
birth control method. We realize that the piece didn’t 
emphasize a few key pieces of information: That, like all birth 
control, the pull-out method isn’t for everyone, and further-
more, the study quoted in the article stipulated that the pull-
out method should be used in conjunction with other forms 
of birth control. 
However, that doesn’t mean the pull-out method is bad: It 
all depends on who is using it.  
Like drinking alcohol or ﬁ  ring a shotgun, the safety issue 
isn’t about the act itself: It’s about who’s doing it. And like all birth control methods, you should consult your doctor or 
a Planned Parenthood consultant before trying it. Students 
can also schedule a free consultation at the UF Student Health 
Care Center.
The pull-out method is most effective for couples in a com-
mitted relationship, and it’s also best used concurrently with 
other forms of birth control. The Guttmacher Institute study 
stated, “One-third of women at risk of unintended pregnancy 
used withdrawal as a contraceptive method within the past 
30 days, often in combination or rotation with more effective 
methods.”
According to Planned Parenthood, of every 100 women 
whose partners use withdrawal, four will become pregnant 
each year if they always do it correctly. Of every 100 women whose partners use withdrawal, 27 will become pregnant 
each year if they don’t always do it correctly. 
The other elephant in the room when it comes to the with-
drawal method is what happens immediately prior — pre-
cum. Does it get you pregnant? Scientists aren’t sure yet, but a 2010 study of 27 men showed that 11 of the men’s pre-cum 
contained sperm, and in 10 of those cases a “reasonable pro-
portion of the sperm was motile.” 
At any rate, the existing research on pre-cum is inconsis-
tent, but it should still factor into your decision on whether or 
not to try the pull-out method. 
New York Magazine’s “The Cut” put it best when referenc-
ing the “pullout” generation: “Every single American woman who’s now in her childbearing years came of age in the era of 
legal birth control. Many were prescribed the pill before they even started having sex. For years, the pullout method was 
taboo — seen as non-birth control for ignorant risk-takers.”
This is changing as organizations like Planned Parenthood 
and Bedsider seek to paint a more accurate picture of what 
the pull-out method can look like. Despite its negative repu-tation, spread in part by pop culture, the pull-out method can be a viable option — within reason. 
But the numbers don’t lie: Coitus interruptus can be an 
effective form of birth control if you’re with a partner you trust and if you consider using additional methods of con-
traception and sexually transmitted disease protection, like a 
condom or dental dam.

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgFriday’s question: Did you receive the 
Gainesville2Go email?Today’s question: Have you ever used the withdrawal 
method?Obama gives hope to students with loans
Earlier this week, President Barack Obama outlined key 
changes to how millions of Americans repay their stu-dent loans. After years of typical political talk about 
student loan reform, someone ﬁ  nally took action on a grow-ing issue that seriously threatens our economy.
Just six years after the Great Recession devastated the 
economy of the U.S., a new bubble appears ready to burst, and it’s a bubble familiar to many of you reading this col-umn: student loans.
Most estimates peg the total student loan debt in the 
U.S. to somewhere around $1 trillion. That’s an astounding number. Not only are current and former students amassing gargantuan amounts of debt — unlike most loans — student loans can neither be reﬁ  nanced nor can they be wiped out 
if you were to ﬁ  le for bankruptcy. If you hold student loan 
debt, you might not qualify for a mortgage, be able to ﬁ  nance a new car or start your own business.
In other words, student loans will follow you, haunt you 
and cripple you until you pay them off.
Thankfully, some in Washington, D.C. are ﬁ  nally starting 
to take action, including Obama.
An executive order signed by the president caps student 
loan repayments at 10 percent of one’s annual income and 
forgives loans after 20 years if they’re not paid in full. It’s the 
ﬁ  rst steps to avoiding a crisis and helping millions of Ameri-cans buried in debt. 
In Congress, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts 
is pushing a bill that would allow individuals to reﬁ  nance student loans, something desperately needed for borrowers trapped with high interest rates without the opportunity to reﬁ  nance at a lower rate. 
Neither proposal is a perfect plan, but it’s far more than 
anyone’s taken in recent years to curb the looming storm generated by $1 trillion in outstanding student loan debt.
It is imperative that Congress takes action now and 
doesn’t play politics over student loans. Shufﬂ  ing their feet, ignoring the economic warning signs, or committing parti-san warfare over student loan reform seriously jeopardizes the U.S. economy and the ability for young people to get out from the Everest-sized mountain of debt accrued in recent years.
Our economy is based on the 
spending habits of consumers. If student borrowers can’t qualify for loans to buy houses, cars or 
start businesses, what’s the future 
of the American economy or, for that matter, the country?
The cost of higher education 
has skyrocketed in recent years,   
and in many cases, the only way to afford college is through student loans. Loans keep the dream of a college education alive for millions of Americans, but that dream quickly be-comes a nightmare following graduation.
Thoughts of paying more than a monthly interest pay-
ment on student loans are nothing more than distant fan-tasies for young people struggling to ﬁ  nd a job with decent pay. With student loan reform, that fantasy gets a little closer to reality, and the stranglehold around the necks of millions might soon be lifted.
Some might disagree with the idea of providing solutions 
to the student debt crisis. After all, students should under-stand the risks of loans before borrowing, right?
Students certainly need to understand the risks of borrow-
ing before they agree to bury themselves in debt, but treating them like indentured servants is not the right solution.
Still think we should ignore the problem? Here’s another 
consideration: To avoid a full-blown economic meltdown in 2008, Congress bailed out the big banks to the tune of $700 billion. If consumers are the engine that drives the American economy, what can be done for those buried in student loan debt?
In no way is this a call for the federal government to sim-
ply forgive $1 trillion in student loans: That would be ludi-crous. Instead, we need to offer student borrowers options that allow to them to pay off their loans. Politicians are actu-ally offering real solutions to the student loan crisis, and it’s time we support the reform proposals.

Lead vocalist Sean Bonnette and guitarist/keyboardist Preston Bryant, members of 
the band Andrew Jackson Jihad, perform at High Dive on Sunday night.
CHLOE FINCH
Avenue writer
Phoenix-based folk-punk outfit Andrew 
Jackson Jihad proved on Sunday night at 
High Dive that punk isn’t dead. What’s more, it can be all at once smart, sincere and totally delirious.
The group, which has been a fixture 
at Fest and recorded its “Gift of the Magi 2: Return of the Magi” music video at the Alachua County Fair Grounds, returned to Gainesville last weekend as part of a stop on its 2014 summer tour with Cheap Girls and Dogbreth.
The tour follows the May release of 
“Christmas Island,” its fifth studio album. Their cult following of longtime fans and mu-sic critics praised the new record’s texture, depth and “bright, bouncy bloodbaths.”
“We’ve been pretty good about each new 
release kind of challenging our fans and…not just remaking the same record,” said bassist Ben Gallaty. “And we have a lot of 
fun with it too, you know, in the studio, be-
ing like, ‘What the f**k are people gonna think of this?’”
You’d be hard-pressed to find many 
other bands that manage to make an acous-tic guitar and stand-up bass sound heavy, but singer/guitarist Sean Bonnette and Gal-laty did so with aplomb, along with current Andrew Jackson Jihad returns

The 2014 FIFA World Cup kicks off 
today, and Gainesville bars are ready for the influx of customers during the month-long international soccer cham-pionship.
Gainesville House of Beer, at 19 W. 
University Ave., will open at 2 p.m. for the first match.
“We have a little bit of a reputation of 
being a soccer bar,” said Alex Whelpton, Gainesville House of Beer’s general man-ager. Customers who come to watch the game in a soccer jersey will receive $1 off of most draft beers, said Whelpton. 
Gainesville House of Beer will pro-
vide free pizza during halftime for the kickoff game today, the three USA games and the final match. 
NBC Sports Radio’s Florida Sports 
Talk will team up with Gainesville House of Beer and will cover those five games while giving away T-shirts and other prizes.
The Swamp Restaurant, at 1642 W. 
University Ave., will have food and drink specials during the games. Gener-al manager Nicholas Smith said custom-ers who wear their team’s jersey while watching the game will receive 10 per-cent off of their check.
“That energy and that sense of pride... 
I think that is the best thing about na-tional tournaments like this,” Smith said. 
“(It)brings a lot of people together that 
wouldn’t normally hang out together.”
Mother’s Pub and Grille, at 1017 
W. University Ave., will not be having World Cup specials, according to one of the bartenders at Mother’s.
“The same specials will apply,” said 
bartender Zach Dauth. “We will be staff-ing heavier because we know there will 
be an influx of people.”
Vivian Soliz, a 21-year-old UF electri-
cal engineering senior, said she is excited 
for the World Cup. She said she is root-ing for Spain because she saw the team  win during the 2010 World Cup, and she said she is hoping for similar results this time around.
“I will probably be watching it at 
Mother’s (because) that is the soccer bar here,” Soliz said. She said she also plans on streaming the games from class if necessary.Watch the World Cup at

Ecoterrorism, the subject of Kelly Reich-
ardt’s “Night Moves,” is a tricky topic to think 
about. 
For many of us, the wanton destruction of 
the environment — with no thought for the fu-
ture or the welfare of other living creatures — is 
tantamount to a capital offense. It is senseless, idiotic, and — most maddening of all — out of our control. I can understand the temptation to become a vigilante and do what politicians and businessmen are too scared to do.
This is the topic of “Night Moves” — a 
tense, unsettling film that uses the passions and convictions of ecoterrorism to explore guilt and 
how we handle our lives falling apart.
Three unlikely partners hatch a plan to blow 
up a local dam. Josh (Jesse Eisenberg) is a trou-
bled and humorless man living on an agricul-tural co-op. Dena (Dakota Fanning) is a college dropout who bankrolls the operation out of her trust fund. Harmon (Peter Sarsgaard) is a for-mer Marine. We follow them through the two phases of the act: the buildup and the inevitable consequences.
Josh is the leader and the focus of the film. 
He’s the most passionate and deliberate of the three, but Reichardt and Eisenberg make him too relatable for him to be evil. You know where he is coming from. His motive for destroying the dam is clear — he muses that it is killing all the salm-on so that you can run your fu***ng iPod all day. His chemistry with Dena and Harmon is expertly placed on the edge of confrontation-al. Eisenberg gives all he can 
to the role and is excellent. He manages to be 
vulnerable and intimidating at the same time.
The theme of technology and conve-
nience destroying nature is powerfully shown 
through the cinematography. “Night Moves” is a beautifully composed movie. One memo-rable sequence shows serene, silent mountains and rivers before cutting to a blaring bulldozer on a landfill.
Reichardt’s feel for the natural world is ap-
propriate for as real a movie as this. There are no thriller cliches — the majority of the screen time is quiet dialogue. Tension is built instead through a growing sense of dread. Enough little things go wrong that I thought the plan wouldn’t work — that they would be caught or killed.
The last scene will seem unsatisfactorily 
ambiguous to some but to me, the best endings leave you thinking and analyzing. Reichardt didn’t need to tidily wrap it up. “Night Moves” is a great film that will be in my mind for a while.
 I give it four stars out of five.Friday at The Hipp: ‘Night Moves’See JihAd, PA ge 11THURSDAY, JUNE 12, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Justin McKenzie, 25, asked a crowd of 
about 100 dancing, sweaty concertgoers at The 
JAM on Saturday night, “Who’s thirsty?”
While taking sips from their various pints 
of beer and water, the members of the audi-
ence responded, “We are!”
Sweaty or not, the audience wasn’t thirsty 
for beer or water.
The audience was thirsty for more horn-
blaring, feet-moving music from the 10-piece, 
Gainesville-based soul band, The Savants of Soul, who just completed recording their ﬁ  rst album, “Downtown Sound,” on UF’s student-operated Swamp Records label.
Though the album isn’t slated for release 
until October, the crowd at The JAM was singing along to many of the band’s songs, despite the fact that none of them have been released on iTunes.
McKenzie joked that the audience knew 
the words better than he did.
The hourlong set highlighted the person-
alities and energy from all of the band mem-
bers, which helped sustain the audience’s 
interest and attention throughout the night. Drummer Alex Klausner, 24, played his drums standing up at times while chanting the songs’ choruses. Trombone player Matthew Rossmann slid 
his trombone over the head of Mandy Moo while she played her trumpet. Keyboard player Jason Bontrager passionately played his key solos, leaning to the side with one leg high in the air.
The band, one of  Swamp Records’ two artists, did it all while dressed in suits and dresses, which Klausner said is all a part of the experience of seeing the band.
“When there’s an electricity in the air and 
that connection between your audience, it’s a feeling unlike any other,” Klausner said. 
“The music is a vehicle for something bigger. It’s about creating an experience for people.”
He said the band tries to take the audience 
back to the era of soul and swing music, and dressing up for the performance helps with that.
“It’s not just about the audio, it’s about 
the visual experience as well,” Klausner said. “You’re not just getting an album played for you live; you’re getting an experience that su-persedes what exists on a recording,” he said. “Soul music attracts all ages.”
The night ended with the audience beg-
ging the band to play an encore. The band closed with two songs, a cover of Mark Ron-son’s rendition of The Zutons’ “Valerie,” 
and a mashup of Wilson Pickett’s “Land of 
a Thousand Dances” and The Ramones’ “I Wanna Be Sedated.”
Swamp Records’ head director Breana 
Auberry said the band’s dedication to its live performances and presence in the communi-ty already solidiﬁ  ed Swamp Records’ interest in working with the band.
The record company will help the band 
with marketing the album, including helping with the band’s website, logo and potentially organizing an album release party.
“They stood out with their craft and how 
important their music is to them,” Auberry said.  “They’re the total package.”Local band The Savants of Soul: A Swamp Records success story

members Preston Bryant (keyboard/
guitar), Deacon Batchelor (drums) and Mark Glick (cello).
Their sound ranged from glee-
fully misanthropic to somber and 
heartfelt. Many of the songs on 
“Christmas Island” deal with death and grief following the passing of Bonnette’s grandfather, including the striking ballad “Linda Ronstadt,” in which Bonnette describes a true story about breaking down in a museum after seeing a video installation about singer Linda Ronstadt.
“I almost made it through a year 
of choking down my fears/But they’re gone for now, all thanks to Linda Ronstadt,” Bonnette sang. In the same show, they performed a track off their 2011 album, “Knife Man,” titled “Fucc the Devil,” which opens with the line, “I’m gonna f**k the devil in his mouth.”
And though the sound is chaotic 
and frantic, you can relax about get-ting close to the stage at an Andrew Jackson Jihad show these days.
“Mosh as gently as you can,” Bon-
nette beseeched the audience after a few songs. He went on to gently re-mind the concertgoers that no one wants to “get a kick to the melon” by a crowd surfer.
The crowd’s high energy, Gallaty 
said, is due in part to the age of their fans: Though the men of Andrew 
Jackson Jihad are in their 30s, a con-
siderable amount of their avid listen-ers are teens and 20-somethings.
“I think it’s great,” Gallaty said. 
“The kids are the ones that are gonna be in the bands of the next genera-tion. So yeah, I just think that’s won-derful…and I love talking to ‘em. I think it’s really awesome when they 
come up and tell me what they think 
because I remember being that ner-vous kid when I was that age.”
This summer marks Andrew 
Jackson Jihad’s 10th year as a band — 10 years of playing shows, record-ing and watching their audience transform from nervous kids to mu-sicians themselves. In a recent Reddit 
AMA, one Redditor asked the band 
why they’ve eliminated certain songs from their set lists over the years.
“There are songs off the first al-
bum where I’m just like, ‘Nah.’ It just doesn’t excite me anymore,” Gallaty said. 
“We like to challenge our fans,” 
Gallaty said, “and we like to do 
what we like to do.”THURSDAY, JUNE 12, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 11

Wild Iris Books, home to Gaines-
ville’s feminist community, is one of 
the last bookstores of its kind in the U.S., according to a story published last week in PolicyMic Magazine, 
and it plans to stay that way.
Owners Erica Merrell and Cheryl 
Calhoun have kept Florida’s only 
feminist bookstore running through donations and volunteers. 
In 2012, the community showed 
its appreciation in an astounding way when people donated about $6,000 to keep the store from closing 
down, Merrell said. 
The money helped the store move to a better, cheaper location that cut 
operating expenses by 65 percent and brought the store’s 7-year-old inventory up-to-date.
“(National Women’s Liberation), 
as individual women, do our best to shop at and support Wild Iris,” said Kendra Vincent, chair of Gaines-ville’s National Women’s Libera-tion.
The store essentially takes the dy-
ing art of bookselling and adds femi-nism behind it, Merrell said.
“Bookstores like Wild Iris carry 
titles other bookstores don’t, or won’t,” UF English professor Steph-anie Smith wrote in an email. “Femi-nist bookstores put content above competition.”These stores work as anchors in 
the community by drawing people in and making them want to con-nect, said Katy Burnett, the presi-
dent of Gainesville’s National Orga-
nization for Women.
“If you go into Barnes and Noble, 
it’s not like that,” she said. “There are so many books, you don’t know what to do. There’s no connection.”
Although the owners and the 
workers of Wild Iris don’t get a dime of the profits, they hold on because 
it’s not just a bookstore — it’s a sanc-
tuary.
“I think every owner of Wild Iris 
has put something on the line,” Mer-rell said. “Whether it be their house or their credit or a little bit of their retirement money.”
Wild Iris has changed people’s 
lives, she said.
Originating in the 1970s as a 
women’s space, the store has always played a part in the activist move-ment.  It gave the courage for some to come out for the first time, and kids have skipped school to retreat to the store, saying it saved their lives, Merrell said.
“That’s why we all do it, even 
though we struggle on the side.”
Despite the array of definitions 
surrounding feminism, Merrell de-scribes it as striving for equality for everyone.  
“I try really hard with this store 
to be very gender-fluid and very conscious about the language we use because I have never thought that feminism was just for women,” she said.
As for what is actually featured 
on its shelves, the store tries to give every voice some shelf-space and give value to everyone’s story, whether it be the voices of minori-ties, kids, women or the disabled.
The store also offers antique jew-
elry and sells online books on its website. 
“I think that it’s really impor-
tant to have spaces like this,“ Vin-cent said.“ It says a lot about the Gainesville community that we’re able to continue to support a femi-nist bookstore here in town.”

Wednesday, according to the school’s website.
“I’m thankful for the opportunity that the Universi-
ty of Florida and Will Muschamp provided to me and 
my family, but at this time I have decided to step down 
from my position on the UF coaching staff for personal 
reasons,’’ Phillips said in a statement released by UF.
Muschamp announced that graduate assistant 
Chris Leak, who quarterbacked the Gators to a nation-al championship in 2006, will replace Phillips.
Leak joined the offensive coaching staff in May 
2013 after a few stints in the Canadian Football League 
and Arena Football League following his graduation 
from Florida in 2006.
Phillips, who coached Kentucky to a 13-24 record 
from 2010 to 2012, joined the Gators to help turn 
around a struggling receiving corps that suffered 
through four different wide receivers coaches from 
2009 to 2012.

 After the Gators’ subpar effort 
from the previous NCAA Indoors, 
the Florida track squads had another chance at redemption.
With 25 athletes (12 women, 13 
men) having traveled to Eugene, Ore., for NCAA Outdoors, Florida put on an impressive start qualifying 11 of the first 16 athletes to begin the com-petition.
The defending champion 4x100-
meter men’s lineup sprinted to an 
easy first place finish — clocking a 
time of 38.77 seconds advancing Ant-
wan Wright, Hugh Graham Jr., Ar-man Hall and Dedric Dukes to the finals.
“I think this is one of the most 
exciting championships we’ve been 
to when you look at the qualifiers,” 
coach Mike Holloway said. “Looking at it overall we’ve been as healthy as we have all year long.”
With the com-
manding opening to Day 1, other Florida athletes stood out in 
qualifying fashion.
Ryan Schnulle traveled back in the 
final stretch of 800-meter run to take second place and qualify for finals with a time of 1:49.48.

Florida has landed its quarterback of the 
future. 
Sheriron Jones (6-foot-2, 189 pounds, 
Moreno Valley, Calif., Rancho Verde High) 
verbally committed to Florida on Sunday fol-
lowing his attendance at a football camp in 
Gainesville. Jones is the No. 10 ranked quar-terback in the 2015 class.
Despite meeting with coaches throughout 
the weekend while at camp, the quarterback said it wasn’t the coaching staff that con-
vinced him to play his next four years at UF 
— it was the players he talked to that won him over.
“They basically were like, ‘If you want to 
be here, you’re going to be here and every-one’s going to love you here,’” Jones said. 
“It’s like that at every college, but I felt like those guys were being like big brothers to me, and I felt like it was family.”
Jones specified that fullback Hunter Joyer, 
defensive tackle Joey Ivie and tight end Tevin Westbrook were responsible for truly making 
him feel at home.
California is a long way from Florida — 
in fact, Gainesville is more than 2,000 miles from his hometown of Moreno Valley. But Jones said he was willing to commit wherev-
er he felt most comfortable, however far from 
California that may have been.
“I felt like I was at home in Gainesville,” he 
said. “I was open to going anywhere, as long as I felt like it was family oriented. I didn’t pay any mind to going across the country.” 
Jones added that offensive coordinator 
Kurt Roper easily convinced him that his skillset will fit in UF’s new system, and he Four-star QB verbally commits

With the Miami Heat and San Antonio 
Spurs still vying for an NBA championship, 
two former Gators are playing, but neither is making much of a contribution to his team’s postseason run.
Heat power forward Udonis Haslem — 
who averaged just 3.8 points per game on 14.2 minutes per contest in the regular season — has registered 36 points in 14 postseason ap-pearances.
Haslem logged a mere three minutes in the 
first three games of the NBA Finals, with his only recorded statistic being a personal foul in Miami’s 98-96 win in Game 2.
Likewise, former Gator Matt Bonner has 
made minimal contributions for the Spurs off the bench this postseason, averaging just 1.2 points per contest since the regular season concluded. 
The 6-foot-10 power forward’s best outings 
in the postseason came in Games 4 and 6 of the Western Conference Finals when he recorded a combined 14 points, five rebounds and two 
assists against the Oklahoma City Thunder.
Bonner notched two points on a pair of free 
throws and an assist in San Antonio’s 111-92 
win against Miami in Game 3 of the NBA Fi-nals on Tuesday, his first recorded statistic in the series.
Gators work out: With the NBA Draft set 
for June 26, three Florida players have been busy working out with various NBA teams.
Patric Young has practiced for multiple 
teams over the past two weeks, including the New York Knicks and the Chicago Bulls.
Young, the 2014 Southeastern Conference 
Defensive Player of the Year and an honorable mention AP All-American, paced the Gators with 41 blocks while ranking 12th in the SEC with 6.2 rebounds per game. He finished his UF career as the 11th player in Gators history to finish his career with at least 1,300 points 
and 800 rebounds.
Scottie Wilbekin recently worked out with 
the Charlotte Hornets as well as the Knicks, 
hoping to show he’s worthy of a draft pick. The Gainesville native was the 2014 SEC Play-er of the Year and a third-team All-American after averaging 13.1 points per game and pac-ing the Gators with 3.6 assists per game and 56 steals in a team-best 34 minutes per contest.
Casey Prather, who led UF with 13.8 
points per game on 60.3-percent shooting, has worked out with the Philadelphia 76ers, the Heat and the Hornets but is not expected to be drafted.THURSDAY, JUNE 12, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 17

DONALD STERLING
ASSOCIATED PRESS
LOS ANGELES — A trial will 
be held next month to determine 
whether Donald Sterling, who op-poses his estranged wife’s planned sale of the Los Angeles Clippers, 
was properly removed as an ad-
ministrator for the family trust that owns the team.
An attorney for Shelly Sterling 
went to probate court Wednesday to request a trial to conﬁ  rm that as sole trustee she can proceed with the $2 billion sale to former Micro-soft CEO Steve Ballmer.
The development is the latest 
in a legal tug-of-war that has en-sued following the NBA’s deci-sion to ban Sterling for life after racist remarks he made emerged in a recording in April. Sterling is 
ﬁ  ghting the decision and suing the 
league for $1 billion.
The trial, which was granted ex-
ceptionally quickly, will begin July 7 and last four days. The deadline for the sale is July 15, which is also the date the NBA Board of Gover-nors is scheduled 
to vote on wheth-er it will approve the sale.
Donald Ster-
ling’s lawyer, Bobby Samini, left the court-
house without 
comment after a 
clerk announced the trial schedule. Neither Sterling was present.
“I just want to resolve this as 
quickly as possible,” NBA Com-missioner Adam Silver told The Associated Press in Miami on Wednesday, when he appeared at an NBA Cares event.
The crux of the case will cen-
ter on the question of whether the 80-year-old Sterling is mentally competent to be a co-trustee of The Sterling Family Trust, which 
gives him the authority to deter-
mine the team’s future. According to the trust’s terms, he can be ruled “mentally incapacitated” after be-ing evaluated by two doctors, said Pierce O’Donnell, Shelley Ster-ling’s attorney.According to court documents, 
three doctors examined Donald Sterling in May and concluded that he suffers from “mild cognitive im-pairment consistent with early Al-zheimer’s Disease” or some other forms of brain disease.
One doctor, James E. Spar, who 
is afﬁ  liated with the division of ge-riatric psychiatry at UCLA, said he believes “Mr. Sterling is at risk of making potentially serious errors of judgment, impulse control and recall in the management of his ﬁ  -nances and his trust.”

JACKSONVILLE — Beauti-
ful chaos precedes the beautiful 
game. It’s hot and sticky, just the 
way it will be every afternoon for 
the next four months in Northern Florida, but they are not deterred. They march for the sport they 
love. They march for their coun-
try’s colors and the team they’re so passionate about — their only hope is that their passion bleeds over to you. If you hang around 
them long enough, it’s impossible 
not to get swept up in the red, white and blue fever they exude from their pores right along with 
the sweat from the June heat.  
  
They are the American Out-
laws, the rabid fan base with more 
than 125 chapters nationwide 
that meet mostly in bars to cheer 
on the U.S. men’s national team whenever they play. They boast a membership of over 10,000 peo-
ple, collecting dues of $25 per year 
per person. They won’t let a chap-ter start in a particular city until 25 people have gotten together to pledge the yearly amount.
On this day, the Jacksonville 
contingent, founded in 2010 with a mission “to get an organized but chaotic following of the U.S. 
men’s national team,” tailgates 
before the 2-1 win over Nigeria in the final send-off game before the team heads to Brazil to compete in the World Cup.
The group rivals — even at 
some points surpassing — the wildest Florida-Georgia tailgate in sheer craziness outside Ever-
Bank Field. It’s fine if you don’t 
believe it, this is America after all. How many people actually care about soccer?
The answer is thousands, and 
it’s clear to see how unbelievably passionate they are about the 23 men you’ll see competing on the pitch Monday evening against 
Ghana.
  
Smoke bombs go off in the 
middle of a lot next to Russ Doe’s 
Sandwich Shop, which serves 
as the Outlaws’ gameday base 
of operations a few blocks away from EverBank. The continuous pounding of a drum is the pul-
sating rhythm of the afternoon. 
It keeps the different chants on beat hours before the game even starts.
A young man that has climbed 
on the roof of Russ Doe’s leads the chanting crowd below in a rendition of “I believe that we will win.” The natives yell their 
own rallying cry “Duval,” a nod 
to the county that comprises the nation’s largest city.
But beyond the beer and the 
incessant yelling, there is family. 
Many at the tailgate aren’t mem-
bers of the specific Jacksonville Outlaws chapter or even resi-dents of Florida at all. They’re no-madic supporters that follow the team wherever they go, linking up with fellow Outlaws once they get to their destination.
“This is what I do,” said Jona-
than Slate, president of the Nash-ville, Tenn., chapter of the Ameri-can Outlaws. And like his fellow 
fans, he travels far and wide to 
see the US play.
 “This is my hobby. This is 100 
people that I’ve become friends with and who have become fam-
ily for me with the soccer games 
and everything.” 
The conversation is cut short. 
A group wants anyone within 
shouting distance to know that 
“you can’t score on Timmy How-ard (the U.S.’ goalkeeper),” be-cause — pardon the French — “he’s big and tall like a f***ing 
brick wall.” The chant goes on 
and on “fourth verse, same as the first.” But it’s “a whole lot louder and a whole lot worse.”
  
For the last decade, Andrew 
Wagner has been traveling around, following the team to games. The US-Nigeria matchup 
is his second time in Jacksonville 
for a game, and he’s seen the team in Washington, D.C., Philadel-phia, Tampa, Nashville and Co-
lumbus, Ohio, to name a few of 
his stops.“I think (the fan support) was 
a lot different in the last World Cup cycle,” Wagner said. “A lot of what the American Outlaws do 
definitely help create that hype 
because everyone can latch on to a single group and come together like this.”
He’s a lot like Mike Fera — co-
incidentally a University of Flori-da graduate. But Fera has upped the ante as a member of the Out-laws, not just going to domestic 
games but also traveling abroad 
to see the team play.
“My big thing now is I go to 
the away games,” he said. “That’s 
like a tight knit community. This 
is fun, but when you go to away games it’s the same 40 faces in a hostile environment. You walk into Kingston (Jamaica) and you 
develop lifelong friendships 
when you’re like ‘damn, if we’re not boys, we’re about to die.’”  
These soccer fans come in all 
shapes, sizes, colors and, obvi-ously, genders. One Outlaw from Atlanta named Skylar Ward spoke to alligatorSports about what it’s like to be a female member of the group. She says she doesn’t get the typical treatment female fans 
of other sports teams get. Nobody 
asks her if her boyfriend got her 
into it, or which midfielder she 
finds most attractive.
“You don’t really get that with 
soccer,” she said. “I think it’s be-
cause Americans are just now 
catching on to the soccer bus that whether you’re man or woman it doesn’t really effect it, everyone’s just jumping on board.”
  
While the Outlaws are the host 
of the packed pregame party, it’s not just limited to members. Many 
that aren’t affiliated with the sup-
porters group at all come, looking for a good time with friends and hopefully a victory for the U.S. Together, they form the largest 
crowd to ever watch a game in 
the Southeast as more than 52,000 people fill EverBank Field to watch the game. Thanks to that, 
the members of the Outlaws find 
the greatest vindication that their push to grow soccer hysteria in this country is working.“This is the most validating 
thing for a soccer fan,” Fera said. “As a soccer fan, you’re kind of on the outskirts of sports fandom, 
your average bro is just going to 
make fun of a soccer dude. But over here, 50,000 people like this? This is what it’s about.”
  
With an hour left before the 
game is set to kickoff, the march begins. Up Church Street to Park-er, then a right on Duval ending 
at the gate outside the stadium. 
They cheer with anticipation, and they carry with them a move-ment. They want you to join them, 
to support the team they love so 
dearly. One day, they hope they won’t be outlaws, but instead just as mainstream as any other fan of the major sports in this country.
Until then, listen closely, and 
do not tread on them. The Ameri-can Outlaws will continue to cheer with all that is in them for 
their team and for their sporting 
way of life. 
If the men’s national team 
comes to your city, they will flood it in droves, painting your down-
town the colors of the American 
flag. 
Unlike that of a human’s, the 
beauty of their chaos is not fleet-
ing. The American Outlaws are 
here to stay.

UF graduate“I’m looking forward to contributing to the long-
term vision that (coach Will Muschamp) has for this 
program,” Phillips said after his hiring on Dec. 3, 
2012.
However, Phillip’s sudden departure means 
Leak will inherit a receiving group led by Quinton 
Dunbar just 80 days before Florida opens its season 
against Idaho on Aug. 30.
After Kurt Roper and Mike Summers took over 
as offensive coordinator and offensive line coach, respectively, Leak becomes the Gators’ third newest 
offensive coach this offseason.
“Chris is a bright young coach,” Muschamp said. 
“He is one of the all-time Gator greats and being at Florida is very important to him. He has been work-
ing with coach Roper and our offensive staff and is 
very familiar with our players and new system.”20, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JUNE 12, 2014

one year at UF, 
Leak to take overNCAA Outdoors run through Saturday
in the following heat after Schnulle, 
did not qualify and was eliminated from national competition ending his career with the Florida track pro-gram.
“It has been quite the honor to 
have competed with the best team in my eyes over the past ﬁ  ve years,” Obinwa said via his Twitter account. “I may be done but my team isn’t.”
The women’s 4x100-meter will 
compete in ﬁ  nals as well as Robin Reynolds, Ebony Eutsey, Shayla Sanders and Destinee Gause. In ad-dition, after adding to what was a impressive opening to nationals, Graham Jr., and his teammate Najee Glass both advanced in the 400-meter 
dash with times of 45.83 and 45.56.
However, sophomore sprinter Ar-
man Hall just missed the list of quali-
ﬁ  ers and will not compete in ﬁ  nals.
The ﬁ  eld isn’t the same, the level 
of competition has elevated and No. 2/4 Florida has to put its potential to the side and rely on what can be there’s.
The Gators will return for Day 2 
of the four-day event of nationals outdoors on Thursday with an addi-tional 16 athletes competing.
Holloway prefers his team to rely 
on its natural talent.
“I understand as the head coach 
that I’m only as good as my staff,” Holloway said. “I have some of the best people out there, and those guys (coaches) are vital. We’re just looking forward to another good champion-ship run.”

Jones compares his game to Brett Favre
liked the transparency that the coaching staff had with him 
while on campus.
“They were straight forward about what they were do-
ing and who they were recruiting,” Jones said. “I felt like I could trust them because if they’re going to be honest with 
me about stuff like that, I don’t have to worry about looking 
over my shoulder with them recruiting someone else.”
While Jones credits Brett Favre as a quarterback he high-
ly admired while growing up, he said he wants to make his own name for himself at the next level.
“I really want to be myself,” Jones said. “I don’t really 
want to compare myself to (Favre), but I feel like my game is getting to his level.”
Jones is expected to compete with Will Grier once he ar-
rives in Gainesville. Grier, who will have a chance to learn under starting quarterback Jeff Driskel this upcoming sea-son, will have a year of experience under his belt by the time Jones arrives.
Although Florida had its ﬁ  rst losing season since 1979 in 
2013, Jones said he didn’t allow that fact to become a factor 
in his decision.
“Things happen, schools go through that all the time,” 
he said. “Every school is going to have their down years. It didn’t really matter to me I’m trying to go to a place where 
I can trust the players and trust the coaches.”FOOT , from page 16“I’m looking forward to contributing
