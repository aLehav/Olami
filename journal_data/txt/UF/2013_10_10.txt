Step aside, Victoria’s Secret models, and prepare for some 
competition from an unlikely source: journalism students.
In a column by totalfratmove.com, journalism was deemed 
the major with the hottest girls. Nursing and education took 
second and third place, respectively.
In the column, communications, advertising and telecom-
munication were all grouped together, so everyone in j-school can share the spotlight.Some notable journalism knockouts include Fox sportscast-
ers Erin Andrews and Laura McKeeman, who both graduated from UF’s College of Journalism and Communications.
Joe Nullet, a 23-year-old UF English alumnus and author of 
the column, said he tried to make the list as universal as pos-sible so more people could relate to it, but he was inﬂ  uenced by UF while writing it.
He said the list was a combination of looking through Face-
book, examining his friends’ majors and thinking of speciﬁ  c ex-amples like Andrews, who he cites as a personal inspiration.  “I did receive some negative feedback from a few girls on 
Twitter,” he said. “But I’ve known some really pretty girls who majored in engineering and neuroscience as well.”
The journalism college has a large proportion of female stu-
dents, and with a larger population, the chances would be bet-ter, said Mike Foley, UF journalism professor. His Reporting labs of about 20 students usually have only one or two men.
“I have had, over the course of 13 years here, two future 
Miss Floridas in my Reporting lab,” he said.Journalism girls break news — and hearts, TFM says

UF researchers are celebrat-
ing the completion of a project 
50 years in the making, and it has paid off with Nobel Prize recognition Tuesday.
More than a year ago, a team 
of UF researchers contributed to the discovery of the Higgs bo-son, the “God particle” that was theorized about for decades.
The Higgs boson is a sub-
atomic particle that explains how matter attains mass. As a set of elementary particles that make up the world, the model is the best explanation for how the universe works.
The researchers at UF were 
part of an international team that designed and built the muon detectors that were able to prove the discovery, accord-ing to a UF news release.
“I’m very proud of our proj-
ect and for our collaborators (for winning the Nobel Prize),” Andrey Korytov said. “We have 3,000 contributors. Every-one contributed in one way or another.”
Korytov is a professor at UF 
and has been working on the project since 1995. He is one of 40 members at the university who have been involved in the research.
The UF High-Energy Ex-
perimental Group is one of the largest groups in the U.S. that helped to work on the research and is led by distinguished pro-fessor Guenakh Mitselmakher.

the Nobel Prize),” Mitsel-Higgs boson discovery

A Gainesville man was arrested Tuesday 
night after Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce 
deputies alleged he poured beer on a cashier and ate food in the store without paying for it.
Deputies arrested Darius Julius Stacy on 
charges of battery on a law enforcement ofﬁ  -cer, damaged property, larceny and resisting an ofﬁ  cer, ASO spokesman Art Forgey wrote in an email.
At about 8:30 p.m., Stacy 
walked into the Kangaroo located at 3423 SE Haw-thorne Road to buy cigaril-los, which are short, thin cigars. 
While the cashier was 
trying to scan the pack, Sta-
cy pushed it away from the scanner.
He grabbed another pack of cigarillos and left.
A few minutes later, Stacy returned with a 
beer and poured it on the counter and the ca-shier, Forgey said. 
He left, came back and offered the cashier 
a cigarillo. 
He also drank beer — Heineken and Bud-
weiser — and Pepsi and ate taquitos before walking out again, according to the arrest re-port.
When a deputy told Stacy to stop, Stacy said, “F*** you,” Forgey wrote.
Stacy reached toward his waistband as he 
was walking away, so the deputy used a Taser on him. Afterward, he kicked another deputy 
in the face.
The Kangaroo’s manager said the store 
will press charges for theft, according to the 
report.
Stacy was taken to the Alachua County Jail 
at about 10 p.m., where he remained Wednes-day night with a $50,000 bond.
Stacy told police he didn’t steal the $14.38 
worth of items because he returned it all to the store.Gainesville man stunned, arrested for gas station sceneSEE SEXY, PAGE 4

UF RecSports is trying to spike breast 
cancer.
Hosting the ﬁ  rst Big Pink Volley-
ball Tournament today at Southwest 
Recreation Center, money raised will go toward breast cancer research at UF Health Shands Hospital.
“They were looking for a partner so 
their funds could go to breast cancer locally,” said Brynn Huysman, devel-opment coordinator for the UF Health Cancer Center. 
Each player from the six-person teams 
should make a requested minimum $5 donation, said Marty Dempsey, the tour-nament’s event coordinator. Teams will be playing with a pink kin-ball, which is bigger than a normal volleyball.
Local businesses have made contribu-
tions to the tournament to help fund the T-shirts that will be sold at the event. 
“We’re really focusing on keeping 
expenses low so that way we can give as much money as possible to UF Health,” Dempsey said.Tournament ballsy way to

The Regional Transit System is ﬂ  uttering 
its weekend riders to new destinations by 
adding stops to Route 25.
Starting this weekend, residents will be 
able to take the route to the Butterﬂ  y Rain-forest exhibit, the Florida Museum of Natural History and the Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art. Some are calling the updated route the “butterﬂ  y bus.” 
Chip Skinner, RTS marketing and com-
munications supervisor, said the route will no longer service the Commuter Lot during weekends because of the changes, but he thinks it will offer new opportunities for resi-dents.
The decision to alter the route was a mu-tual one between UF and RTS because UF funds Route 25.
Robert Miller, UF’s associate vice presi-
dent of business affairs, said the added stops may make it a few minutes longer to com-plete that route. 
“I think it’s going to provide additional 
accessibility out there to the arts complex and the museums,” he said.
Ridership is lower on weekends, Skinner 
said, and while implementing these changes could improve it, nothing is certain.Bus route change means no

“I think it’s going to provide 
additional accessibility out there to 
the arts complex and the museums.”
Robert Miller
UF’s associate vice president of business affairsBut he calls the piece by totalfratmove.com “very un-
scientiﬁ  c.”
Jaclyn De Bonis, a 19-year-old journalism sophomore, 
agreed that journalism is a very female-dominated in-
dustry.
“It is ﬂ  attering to know that that’s how my industry 
is viewed,” she said. “But I could see it being a little in-sulting if maybe I was in a different major that wasn’t on the list.”
Camille Crooks, a 19-year-old UF sophomore study-
ing marketing — which came in at No. 6 on the list — did not agree with the placing.
“It’s outrageous, and it makes no sense,” she said.She said she thought marketing should be ﬁ  rst.  “I’m basically carrying the marketing team. It should 
be higher, but I can only do so much. People need to step up,” she said.
Eldin Kalac, a 19-year-old pre-pharmacy sophomore, 
said he agreed journalism majors are the hottest girls.
“They want to get their face out in public. They want 
to be recognized. I guess it has to do with maybe some fame or popularity,” he said.
He noticed engineering was not on the list and said 
it makes sense because he thought most engineers are usually indoors, and they don’t really socialize.

makher said.  “After 20 years of search-
ing for the particle, we found it. So, it justiﬁ  es all of our efforts for this.”
The organization, which includes 
nine faculty members and more than 30 research personnel and students, helped make the discovery in July 2012.
“We are very involved in the stages 
of design and construction of the exper-iment,” Korytov said.  “A big chunk of this experiment was led from Florida.”
The research cost about $1 billion 
and involved collaborators in 40 differ-ent countries, Korytov said.
“The whole discovery is really quite 
simple for physicists but not so simple for people who are not in physics,” Mitselmakher said. “I think this knowl-edge belongs to the most fundamental knowledge that we have in physics.”
Mitselmakher said he is not sure of 
the impact the discovery will have in fu-ture years but said it will have a signiﬁ  -cant effect on the future of humanity.
The research was led by ATLAS and 
CMS, which are two separate general-purpose particle physics experiments.
Korytov said his research team will 
take a few years off and return in 2015.
“What’s important for science is im-
portant for humanity,” Mitselmakher said. “I think it’s one of the reasons for the university being great. So, I’m hap-py to contribute to that.”

News racks in Turlington Plaza 
have recently been ﬁ  lling up — but 
not with newspapers.
Since Student Government did 
not renew The New York Times subscription, a number of modular distribution units across campus are empty.
Unauthorized distributors have 
been using the racks without ap-plying for permission from UF Business Affairs, which regulates who can place material in the units, according to UF Regulation 2.003. However, Bob Miller, associate vice president of Business Affairs, said there are currently no unprocessed applications, and the ﬂ  iers in these boxes may be unauthorized.“We have an employee that re-
moves ﬂ  iers or any grafﬁ  ti and takes unauthorized materials down,” he said. 
However, Ellis Starkey, a 20-year-
old UF telecommunication junior, said people should take advantage of the circumstances.
“If the boxes are only meant for 
newspapers, then people handing out ﬂ  iers should be prepared to va-cate the space when it’s rented back out again,” she said. Publications ‘squatting’ in black racks

The Samuel P. Harn Mu-
seum of Art is embracing a new 
level of art and photography: Instagram.
At tonight’s kickoff party for 
Museum Nights and the free student membership program, the Harn will also host an Insta-gram contest from 6 to 9 p.m.
The party will showcase 
students and faculty members’ paintings, drawings, sculpture, dances and musical perfor-mances.
Participants in the Insta-
gram contest can submit their pictures from the event using the hashtag #myHarn.      
The purpose of using Ins-
tagram is to raise awareness about the museum and about the free memberships that have been made possible by Stu-dent Government, said Tami Wroath, the director of market-ing and public relations for the Harn.
The museum began offering 
free student memberships in September and has fewer than 500 left.
“We want to encourage stu-
dents to make the Harn a part of their life here at UF,” Wroath said.
Gift card prizes will go to 
the most creative and interac-tive photos.
Although the contest is open 
to everyone at the party — even those without Harn member-ships — she said only students can take home the prizes.
Bijun Liu, a 22-year-old UF 
criminology and East Asian languages and literatures se-nior, said she’s excited to par-ticipate in the contest.
“I think the pictures at the 
Harn are cool,” she said. “I will deﬁ  nitely participate.”Harn Museum to

Like thigh gaps
Some people have blue eyes, and some people have green 
eyes. Some people have innie belly buttons, and some people have outie belly buttons. Some people have nar-
row hips and legs that touch, and some people have wider hips with thighs that don’t touch. All these particular body parts are affected by the arbitrary genetic hand you’re dealt at birth, yet young girls have chosen to obsess over whether they have a “thigh gap.”
As the Alligator reported yesterday, the pervasive thigh-
gap idea has been perpetuated by users on sites like Tum-blr and Pinterest who glorify having upper thighs that don’t touch. Having a thigh gap, as health professionals have re-ported, is not indicative of good health.
Vonda Wright, a Pittsburgh-based orthopedic surgeon 
and ﬁ  tness expert, talked to Jezebel about the logistics of hav-ing a thigh gap and the impracticality of striving for one. She said a person would have to be both skinny and wide-hipped in order to have one.
“Besides, Wright said,” according to Jezebel, “it isn’t a 
goal worth chasing. Most ﬁ  t people won’t have a thigh gap because their thighs are muscular enough that they touch,” she said.
“‘Skinny does not mean ﬁ  t or muscular,’ said Wright, who 
works with Division I athletes. ‘I cannot think of one athlete I deal with’ who has a thigh gap.”
Women just can’t cut a break, it seems. If it’s not a thigh 
gap, it’s a ﬂ  at stomach or prominent collar bones or back dimples or avoiding “cankles” or whatever ridiculous beauty trend is en vogue.
In her memoir “Bossypants,” our Lord and savior Tina 
Fey said, “Now every girl is expected to have Caucasian blue eyes, full Spanish lips, a classic button nose, hairless Asian skin with a California tan, a Jamaican dance hall a**, long Swedish legs, small Japanese feet, the abs of a lesbian gym owner, the hips of a nine-year-old boy, the arms of Michelle Obama, and doll t*ts.
“The person closest to actually achieving this look is Kim 
Kardashian,” Fey wrote,  “who, as we know, was made by Russian scientists to sabotage our athletes.”
On the ﬂ  ip side, since the thigh-gap debate has received as 
much attention as the classic vodka-eyeballing of 2010, peo-ple have felt compelled to weigh in on the subject a little too harshly, labeling girls with thigh gaps as “bowlegged” and “shaped like a human nutcracker.”
Unfortunately, unrealistic beauty ideals aren’t going any-
where. No matter how many exposés are written, no matter how many documentaries are ﬁ  lmed, and no matter how many op-eds are written, women will be faced with ridicu-lous and arbitrary standards of beauty.
The only line of defense, then, is to quit worrying about 
the stuff you can’t control. Whether your thighs part at the top or kiss gently, remember that your worth as a human be-ing isn’t based upon your looks.

Tasty Buddha closed? Today’s question: Do you think journalism majors are 
hot?
Congress and McCutcheon v. FEC
Obviously, there aren’t many people happy with 
what’s happening in Washington right now. And because we live in a democracy, citizens can actu-
ally hold the members of Congress responsible for the shut-down — but we probably won’t.
The problem is that we’re not the hand that feeds Con-
gress anymore — corporations are. Votes have become es-sentially sold to the highest bidder, and candidates with more funding can get their messages out easier. Because when more people know a candidate and his or her mes-sage, they’re more likely to vote for that person.
In 2010, an important case was decided in the Supreme 
Court — Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. Citizens United is a nonproﬁ  t corporation that wished to ad-vertise a documentary about then-Sen. Hillary Clinton dur-ing the 2008 election primaries. Because it is a corporation, however, it was illegal for the people of Citizens United to spend money on what the law considered an “electioneer-ing communication” so close to an election. The Supreme Court ruled that was a violation of Citizens United’s First Amendment right.
Fast forward to today, and there’s a similar case to be 
heard in the Supreme Court. In the upcoming McCutch-eon v. Federal Election Commission, limits for individuals may be changed. Currently, individuals are limited in how much they can give a candidate — $2,500 per election per candidate and up to $46,200 for all candidate donations in a two-year period. McCutcheon is not challenging the limit per candidate but the blanket two-year limit.
Before I go any further, I will pause and say that the most 
important freedom we have under the Constitution is the First Amendment. Without it, we wouldn’t be allowed to criticize the government and maintain a healthy democ-racy.
The Supreme Court feels strongly about the First Amend-
ment, too, and it’s historically ruled to protect that right — especially when it comes to political speech. Justices look at any restriction on content with scrutiny, a standard that makes regulating political speech difﬁ  -cult. Thus, you have the Citizens United ruling, which extended the concept of “speech” to not only how individuals spend money, but corporations and labor unions as well. And it was protected.
However, the Citizens United ruling allowed corpora-
tions to donate an unlimited amount of money to political action committees, or PACs, even though they can’t do the same to individual candidates. And while PACs are legally barred from actively cooperating with campaigns on strat-egy, they can, and do, release advertisements supporting or attacking speciﬁ  c candidates. Essentially, donating to a PAC is donating to a candidate.
It’s easy to buy inﬂ  uence with unlimited donations 
from Wall Street allowed. Campaigns are getting bigger, and more money is required to stand a chance come elec-tion time. That means small-name candidates — ones who  haven’t been bought by special interests — aren’t able to get elected. Without the support of the PACs, they have no campaign.
Supporters of the Citizens United decision argue as the 
Supreme Court does. This kind of spending is protected by the First Amendment, and striking down the decision would be a limit on political speech. However, that’s not the case.
Tying money to speech takes power away from those 
with fewer resources. While corporations may have a ton of money to spend buying campaigns, the average person doesn’t. 
This causes a disproportional representation of the inter-
ests of a few corporate CEOs, suppressing any competing viewpoints with the power of their dollars.

Students, faculty and museumgoers 
could hear the buzzing of insects and 
swaying of trees as they stepped into Nao-mi Fisher’s reception for “Lay of the Land” at the University Gallery on Friday.
The opening reception exhibited not 
only works of art by Fisher but also elic-ited discussion from an eclectic mix of people at a social gathering.
Anyone who was interested in speak-
ing with the artist had the opportunity to do so face-to-face.
Although Fisher and her boyfriend, Jim 
Drain, were walking around the exhibit documenting the performance piece, they made an effort to interact with guests.
The performance piece was only on dis-
play during the reception, and it was one of the most memorable works because the dancers moved around the entire space and attracted curious attention.
“I chose people who can channel emo-
tion,” Fisher said. “It is a profound way of taking dance out of the stage.”
During their performance, the three dancers used figurative moves to convey the behavior of snakes. They slithered across the cold, hard gallery floors and shed their skins and dirt as they stood up.
“This is the most multimedia show 
she’s done,” Drain said.
Fisher’s photographs were printed on 
the silk dresses worn by the dancers.
Many people did not know what to do 
with themselves and scurried away when-ever the dancers moved in their direction. Others stood still and pensive, watching the dancers’ every move.
Phillip Richter, a 23-year-old UF indus-
trial and systems engineering major, felt the dancers were “a little weird,” but he enjoyed other areas of the show, like the python and other snakeskins featured.
“This is my first time going to an art 
show at UF,” Richter said. “It makes me feel inspired to do something.”
Students, artists and professors were 
engaged in an evident and significant con-versation throughout the reception.
“Doing a show in a university made 
me excited to try new ideas and be experi-mental,” Fisher said. “It was very liberat-ing. Anything could happen.”AP photo

Paris Fashion Week has officially 
ended, rounding out the most magi-
cal month in the fashion world. 
Highlighted by brands as iconic 
as Valentino and designers as talked about as Marc Jacobs, the runways in Paris have provided a telling glimpse into spring/summer 2014 trends.
In terms of color trends, design-
ers like Lanvin and Stella McCartney played up the metallic tones for their spring/summer 2014 collections. Rich and warm metallic sheens from gold to bronze were seen on multiple catwalks. 
Appearing in both ultra-feminine 
and androgynous looks, the metallic color palette is a surefire trend for spring and summer. 
The Saint Laurent show featured 
a vivid gold, structured wrap dress. The intense metallic smoothness of the dress was juxtaposed with the structure of the silhouette. 
Alternatively, designers like Gi-
ambattista Valli played with lighter metallic shades. Valli incorporated a muted gold fabric with a minimal level of shine into a delicate and femi-
nine coat, a standout piece in the collec-tion.
Although the col-
or trends are certain-ly noteworthy, the Paris runways also 
displayed a trend toward pattern. De-spite their cartoonish or nautical con-notations, stripes appeared in  such prominent collections as Hermès and Valentino. 
While Hermès experimented with 
horizontal, colored stripes, Valentino utilized a thicker, horizontal stripe. Elie Saab put a feminine spin on the stripe by incorporating it with lace for some of the gowns in his collec-tion. 
In any case, the stripes made a 
chic statement, nodding toward a big trend for the coming seasons.
As is usually the case with fashion, 
nothing is complete without a new twist on a classic menswear trend. This year’s Paris Fashion Week was no different. 
Seen in multiple and varied collec-
tions, the shirtdress is a huge trend to look out for in the coming spring and summer. 
Newer names on the scene like 
Sacai as well as Paris Fashion Week favorites like Balenciaga and Nina Ricci incorporated chic variations of the shirtdress into their respective collections.
While metallic hues, stripes and 
shirtdresses were in the trend spot-light this Paris Fashion Week, drama is one trend that is always present on Parisian catwalks. 
Between fantastical, theatrical 
shows like Saint Laurent and Louis Vuitton, protesters taking the runway during the Nina Ricci show and (per-haps most notably) Marc Jacobs pre-senting his final show for Louis Vuit-ton after 16 years of designing, drama showed up in a big way during Paris Fashion Week this September.
Despite the drama or perhaps 
because of it, Paris Fashion Week consistently and accurately signals trends for coming seasons.

A laughing group of people col-
laborated on collages that circulat-
ed around two long tables. Torn-up magazine pages toppled off the tables as the collages ﬁ  lled up.
“You can tear pictures off,” said 
Elif Akcali, UF associate professor of industrial and systems engi-neering. “You can put your own pictures on. You can cover some-one else’s picture.”
Everyone was distracted from 
his or her own sickness. A Cre-ative for Health workshop was in full swing.
Creative for Health workshops 
allow those affected by cancer to express themselves through vari-ous art mediums. The group meets Thursday at 5:30 p.m. in Room 1302 of the Criser Cancer Resource Center.
“We’re here to help humanize the health care environment,” said Dylan Klempner, artist in resi-dence at UF Health Shands Hos-pital and organizer of the work-shops. Shands’ artist in residence program aims to bring art directly to the patient.  
“What I want people to do is 
come in the door and get lost in the act of creating and let whatever is in their hearts and minds just ﬂ  ow from there,” Klempner said.
When people come to the hos-
pital, they need to be cured. They don’t get to choose what or when they eat nor what they wear. They’re told what medicine to take and when. They give up control for the healing process, Klempner said.
“They give up the elements of 
control that deﬁ  ne them as indi-viduals,” he said. “The artist comes to the bedside and helps them in a journey that helps them get control of their lives back in a small way.”In her collage workshop, Akcali 
shared the works of Henri Matisse, Carla Accardi and other famous artists who inﬂ  uenced her own collages. Small snippets of maga-zines from her previous projects fell out of the art books as she held them in front of the group.
“Collage is very freeing,” she 
said. “You just cut and paste. It is very free-form.”
Art has helped free Akcali from 
the areas of stress in her own life.
“I walked into my class today 
and realized I forgot the papers on my desk,” she said. “Five years ago, I would have had a heart at-tack. A disruption would happen, and I wouldn’t be prepared with how to deal with it, but today … I said, ‘OK, well I forgot the quiz problems, so why don’t you write a new quiz altogether and go.’ It’s made me take life as it comes.”
Burt Kempner, 65, of  
Gainesville, worked with the Arts in Medicine program in the past doing oral histories. 
As a former volunteer, he un-
derstands the signiﬁ  cance of bring-ing art to patients.
“I saw the difference it makes in 
their lives,” he said. “The chance to talk or do something not related to their disease … is a respite for some.”

� THEY COULD WORK FOR A GROUP 
COSTUME. 
ANGELA SKANE

Fall not only brings out the best coffee ﬂ  a-
vors, i.e. pumpkin spice. it also means it’s Hal-
loween time. If you start planning now, you could rock a costume that screams Spooky Sally.
Johnny Depp through the yearsIf you are dressing up as a group but don’t 
want to be stuck looking out of place when you split up, this idea works wonderfully. Each per-son in the group, guys and girls, can channel a different Johnny Depp character. There’s JD in “Willy Wonka,” “Fear and Loathing in Las Ve-gas,” “Pirates of the Caribbean,” and you can’t forget “Edward Scissorhands.”
Each Depp character can be achieved for 
a pretty low cost. Between Plato’s Closet and Goodwill, you should be able to come up with any funky items you may need.
For these outﬁ  ts, accessories will be key to 
deﬁ  ning which Depp character you are. The actual clothing will be easy to get a hold of, but ﬁ  nding some of these accessories may take ex-tra time, so get to planning!
“Fear and Loathing”Finally, another use for your tacky tour-
ist shirt. A Hawaiian shirt with light-colored shorts or pants will work ﬁ  ne. Accessorize with yellow-tinted aviators or hippie glasses and a white bucket hat. If you aren’t familiar with the bucket hat trend, Google “Diddy bucket hat.”
“Willy Wonka”This is perfect for those with a shoulder-
length haircut! Pair a purple shirt with a pais-ley neck scarf and a red suede or velvet jacket. These are simple thrift ﬁ  nds, assuming you don’t ﬁ  nd them in grandma’s closet. Acces-sorize with a black top hat, purple gloves and a walking stick. And of course, what Willy Wonka costume is complete without the white goggle-esque glasses.
“Edward Scissorhands”A black shirt with black shorts or a skirt will 
do for this. Throw on a pair of ripped tights to give your look more edge. All black garb makes it easy for you to focus more on crafting your scissor hands. 
For the safety of everyone on Halloween, 
please don’t use knives or actual scissor blades for this. 
Use your crafty skills and make your own 
blades out of poster board. Attach the “blades” to long black gloves. Wear your hair messy and use white powder to make your skin look pale. Draw on your mini lips with a dark purple lip-stick to ﬁ  nish off the look. Depp-inspired costume ideas

Dear Mediocre Advice,
Halloween is coming up, and I want to make a haunted 
house, but I want to get creative. What are some scary 
things or maybe some things that scare you?Dear Friend,
I can think of some terrifying things: intense coughing with a tampon in, get-
ting a piggyback ride on your heavy-flow day, excreting a deadly fart next to your 
crush when there’s no one else to blame the smell on, student loans, a bad credit score, Alzheimer’s disease, seeing red-and-blue lights flash even if I’m not doing anything wrong, if sharks could go on land, going blind, falling like how Hilary Swank did in the movie “Million Dollar Baby” and becoming paralyzed. And not 
the government shutting down.ALYSSA HOLCOMB

Alt-rock ensemble Panic! at the Disco hasn’t 
released an album for two years (since 2011’s 
“Vices & Virtues”) but its signature sound has yet to fade. “Too Weird To Live, Too Rare To Die!” is classic Panic! — melodic, slightly biting and bursting with energy. Front man Brendon Urie is as honest as ever with his lyr-ics, and the overall record (while maintaining a more pop-friendly edge) is on par with the band’s shiny, theatrics-ridden discography.Lead singles “This Is Gospel” and “Miss 
Jackson” start the album off with an arguably harder edge compared to previous work. The latter embodies the term “catchy chorus” with darkly repetitive chants that will be stuck in your head hours after the song ends.
From there, the album takes a more ’80s-
infused spin a la contemporaries Neon Trees — I’m deﬁ  nitely throwing my vote in for a co-headlining tour.
“Vegas Lights” is upbeat and full of synth 
— but those chants in the background main-tain the album’s overall deeper tone. Similarly, “Girl That You Love” and “Girls/Girls/Boys” have a Depeche Mode vibe, mix-ing both lighter and darker sounds to create pieces that are catchy yet haunting.
“Casual Affair” and (my 
personal favorite) “Nico-
tine” are the most haunting tracks. Again, this album has an overlying dark effect that is reﬂ  ected in both the lyrics and the musical-ity — but that’s what makes it so intriguing to listen to.Urie’s vocals have always had that distin-
guishable edge, and he continues to stretch his range to its full extent on every track. Listen to almost any Panic! song, and you know the man can sing high, but it’s his lower register that gets a workout in songs like “Far Too Young To Die” and the very dance-able “Col-lar Full” (seriously, please do a collaboration with Neon Trees).
I may be a longtime fan, but honestly, if the 
group continues to put out records that are able to balance versatility and coherency in this fashion, I’ll listen forever.

Few people think lining up clay pots and 
smashing them indiscriminately with the force 
of a bowling ball is an art form. Well, if you hap-pen to be one of the people who desire violence against all pots, you’ll ﬁ  nd that and more at the UF Art Bash.
The free annual event, which drew 600 at-
tendees last year, will take place on Oct.18 at the UF ﬁ  ne arts complex from 6 to 9 p.m. It’s an opportunity for students to showcase their artwork in photography, graphic design, sculp-ture, printmaking, ceramics and digital media.
Student art will be displayed in the class-
rooms, hallways and the courtyard of the arts complex, according to Richard Heipp, director of the School of Art + Art History.
Displays will include large-scale inﬂ  atable 
art from the students of the Workshop for Art Research and Practice, as well as a game of “pot bowling,” hosted by student organization Handbuilt Or Thrown Clay. Alumnus artist Ja-son Mitcham, the artist behind the Avett Broth-ers’ “Head Full of Doubt/Road Full of Promise” music video, will also be featured, according to a news release.
Heipp will be performing live music with 
the rest of the R. Mutt Blues Band, winner of the 2013 North Central Florida Blues Society’s Challenge, according to the release.
Robert Mueller, a senior faculty member in 
printmaking at the art school, said the event will showcase several hundred pieces of art.
“There is no theme to this show,” Mueller 
said, “only a one-day showcase of student art to the community.”
Ben Weary, a 24-year-old store associate at 
the UF Bookstore, said he hasn’t heard much about the event but would deﬁ  nitely attend.
“I’ve lived in Gainesville all my life,” Weary 
said. “I would deﬁ  nitely be interested in any-thing that caught my attention.”
High school or middle school students from 
around the Gainesville area are also encouraged to bring their art pieces to be showcased at the event, Mueller said.
“Art bash is all about making the visual arts 
visual,” he said.Art Bash promises to be a smash

How much protein should you eat per day?
This will depend heavily on age, activity level and health of each individual. For the average person, here is the recommended daily allow-
ance formula* to gauge the grams of protein you should consume in a day. Divide that evenly among four to six small meals.
Formula  
[Weight (in pounds) / 2.2] x 0.8 = number of grams of protein per day
Note: If you work out and weight train frequently, this number will need to be higher in order to properly fuel your body and muscles.
Top ﬁ  ve best protein sources:
1 Chicken or turkey breast (17 grams of protein in 58-gram breast)
2 Fish (22 grams of protein in 3-ounce serving)
3 Lean beef and veal (31 grams of protein in 3-ounce serving)
4 Eggs and egg whites (6 grams of protein per large egg)
5 Protein powder supplement (grams vary per brand and type of 
protein. See my blog post “Breaking down protein powders” to learn 
more about the different types of protein powders.Top ﬁ  ve protein-rich foods that may surprise you:
1 Quinoa (8 grams of protein in 1 cup cooked)
2 Cottage cheese (12 grams of protein in ½ cup)
3 Nonfat Greek yogurt (11 grams of protein in ½ cup)
4 Nuts and seeds (9 grams of protein in 1-ounce serving)
5 Beans (6 to 9 grams of protein in ½ cup)Eat more chicken!
Well, not just chicken 
— any protein-rich foods. 
Everyone needs to include protein in his or her diet. Made up of chains of ami-no acids, protein is essen-tial for the health, growth and maintenance of body tissues and cells (meat-head translation = muscle growth). No, you do not need to eat mass quan-tities like Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson on cheat day. But yes, you need to include protein sources into your meals.

Alligator Staff Writer @LandonWatnick
One word summarizes the 
start of Florida’s 2013-14 season: 
uncertainty. 
Billy Donovan, who is entering 
his 18th season as Florida’s coach, reaffirmed Wednesday during the team’s annual media day that se-nior forward Will Yeguete (knee) and Rutgers transfer guard Eli Carter (leg) would not be cleared to play for the Gators’ first prac-tice on Friday. Both players are questionable for Florida’s season-opener against North Florida on Nov. 8.
With five-star forward Chris 
Walker still not enrolled at UF, and Scottie Wilbekin set to miss an unknown number of games due to a suspension to begin the year, Florida heads into the sea-son with question marks scat-tered throughout its roster.
“Those two guys (Yeguete and 
Carter), I don’t know when they’ll be back,” Donovan said. 
“We’ll try to prepare like those 
guys are not going to be there ready to play. Hopefully, there will be a time when they can get themselves ready. They’ll have to do a lot of things in terms of maintaining and conditioning and picking up on what’s going on. 
“I have less of a worry about 
Will because this is obviously his senior year. He has an under-standing, but for Eli, who is try-ing to pick up a new system and a new style of play, everything is going to be different. When you can’t go through things on a daily basis, that’s always challenging.”
Yeguete underwent ar-
throscopic debridement on his right knee May 22 to remove loose cartilage. Carter suffered his inju-ry during Rutgers’ game against DePaul on Feb. 16 and underwent surgery 12 days later.
”I don’t have a timetable,” 
Carter said. “I’m getting better every day, every week.” 
Walker is in the process of completing online courses so he can be academically eligible to play for the Gators. If the Bonifay native enrolls for the 2014 spring semester, the earliest he could re-turn would be mid-December.“He’s working really, really 
hard. I’m optimistic that he’ll be back here,” Donovan said. 
“That’s the challenge, is him 
trying to play catch-up for what he will have missed. We’ll have to see how much or how well he can pick it up. That’s the unknown for me.”
Despite facing a suspension 
to begin 2013-14, Wilbekin will rejoin the team in practice on Fri-day. He practiced at UF’s basketball 
facility for a portion of the offsea-son separate from the team. 
“He’s been very humble, just 
trying to get back with the team, get back with the players,” for-ward Casey Prather said. 
“You could just tell a major dif-
ference in his attitude, his work ethic and everything like that.”
During Friday’s practice, the 
Gators will have available four mainstays — center Patric Young, shooting guard Michael Frazier II, Prather and Wilbekin — from last year’s rotation that reached the Elite Eight. 
Five-star point guard Kasey 
Hill will partake in his first prac-tice as a Gator on Friday, while transfers Dorian Finney-Smith (Virginia Tech) and Damontre Harris (South Carolina) will prac-tice for the first time as active members on the roster.
Sophomores DeVon Walker, 
Dillon Graham, junior walk-on Jacob Kurtz and the younger Billy Donovan will also be available. 
The elder Donovan hopes he 
can make the best of who he has available going forward.
“My challenge, as a coach, 
based on your personnel, is to evolve,” Donovan said. “We’re going to have some things phil-osophically that we’re always going to believe and that we’re always going to do, but I feel like my responsibility on the of-fensive end of the floor is to put these guys in situations to take advantage of the skillset that they have.”

After being suspended in June for vio-
lating team rules, Scottie Wilbekin has 
been cleared to participate in Friday’s first practice of the year. 
However, coach Billy Donovan said his 
senior point guard still has more to do to be fully reinstated.
“He has done everything that I could 
ask of him as a player in terms of taking responsibility and growing,” Donovan said. “He still has some things in front of him before he is fully back on our team, but we will give him the opportunity to practice.”Until Wilbekin returns, freshman Kasey 
Hill is expected to run the offense at point guard.
Hill, a McDonald’s 
All-American at Monte-verde Academy, said he expects the speed of the collegiate game will be one of the biggest adjust-ments, but he added that Wilbekin has helped him with the transition so far.
“I lean on him a lot,” 
Hill said. 
“He’s way more advanced than me 
(and) he knows a lot more than me. I look up to him. He’s one of the leaders on the team.”
Donovan said he does not know how 
Hill will respond to the early season pres-sure, but he said he and the team will need to be patient with a 19-year-old running the offense.
“He’s going to really have to be able to 
understand there is going to be a lot on him, but I don’t need to overwhelm him, I need to help him,” Donovan said. 
“Kasey and I really need to be con-
nected the next month and a half as we get ready to play games.”
Chris Walker not eligible for fall: The 
five-star forward from Holmes County High is not academically eligible to join the team until the fall semester ends in December. Donovan said he is proud that the 6-foot-10 Walker is doing everything he can academically to become part of the squad.
If the NCAA clears Walker to play fol-
lowing the fall semester, Donovan said he will make on-court adjustments to add Walker into the UF rotation.
“Do you cut down what you’re doing if 
you have to just to be on floor playing just to make it a little bit more simple for him. We’ll probably have to do that with him being a freshman,” Donovan said. 
“If that opportunity presents itself for 
us, we’ll figure out a way to try to utilize him as best we can.”

Young paced Florida in blocks and rebounds last season
Harris and Young to share 
time on court: Donovan said that 
when Florida needs more size on the court, Damontre Harris, who sat out last season after transfer-ring from South Carolina, will play center and Patric Young can shift to power forward.
“That would give us a lot of 
size at the basket if we needed to play that way,” Donovan said. “Damontre brings a different kind of presence because Damontre is much more of a pure shot blocker naturally than Patric is.”
Donovan added that he is con-
cerned that Harris has not grown at a pace he would have liked to see after dealing with the effects of a dislocated shoulder and torn labrum. 
But Young, who played center last season, said he expects im-mediate relief from the 6-foot-10 Harris because of his size.
“It’ll be nice because I’ll play 
a more natural position for my-self,” Young said. “It’ll help lighten the load on the rebound-ing game, and I know I can count on Damontre defending-wise. He can block a lot of shots. A lot more shots than I can.”
Young was third in the South-
eastern Conference last season with a team-leading 58 blocks. He also led the Gators with 6.3 rebounds per game.
