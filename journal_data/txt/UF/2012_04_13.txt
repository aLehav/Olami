TALLAHASSEE — Adminis-
trators from UF and Florida State 
University met in the state Capitol on Thursday to lobby Gov. Rick Scott to sign a bill that would allow both universities to charge market-rate tuition.The bill, which was passed by 
the Florida Legislature last month, would allow universities that meet certain criteria to raise tuition by more than the current cap of 15 percent per year.
UF and FSU are the only univer-
sities that make the cut right now.
Rep. Bill Proctor, who supports 
the bill, argued that pertmitting UF and FSU to raise 
tuition to mar-ket rate would allow them to achieve national pre-eminence. Increasing the quality of educa-tion would better 
prepare students for entering the workforce, particularly in science, technology, engineering and math ﬁ  elds, he said.
“The importance of major re-
search universities to the state and the nation’s economy can not be overstated,” Proctor said in sup-port of the bill.
During his presentation, FSU 
President Eric Barron said the Top 100 research universities attract $40 billion in federal and corporate research, while the next 550 uni-versities garner only $10 billion.
He noted that the market will 
protect against “unbridled” tu-ition increases, and that the goal of market-rate tuition isn’t to limit ac-

Hundreds of graduate students moved as 
one Thursday to protest proposed cuts to an 
engineering department.
They gathered on the Reitz Union Colon-
nade with posters, ﬂ  ooded the Rion Ballroom for a discussion and lined the auditorium walls at the McKnight Brain Institute for a Fac-ulty Senate meeting.
But no matter where they were, their mes-
sage stayed the same: “Save CISE.”
The Florida Legislature recently passed a 
plan that would reduce the budget for UF’s College of Engineering by 5.86 percent, ac-cording to a proposal by Dean Cammy Ab-ernathy. Combined with other expenses, this totals about $4 million that must be cut or re-purposed.
Abernathy’s plan includes moving all com-
puter engineering degree programs from the Computer and Information Science and Engi-neering department to the Electrical and Com-puter Engineering department. CISE teach-ing assistants would be eliminated, as would research and graduate staff, according to the proposal. Half of the faculty could move to an-other department.
“I don’t know that our college has been 
through something quite like this in our 100-year history ,” Abernathy said at a meeting Thursday.

Jude Rizzo can’t sleep. He hasn’t 
for the past 11 days, he said. He 
doesn’t want to eat. He keeps think-ing about that April night: The night he killed his roommate.
The images come back when he 
closes his eyes: running down the stairs, ﬁ  nding Michael Crace dead, kicking the pistol away, calling police, getting handcuffed, being questioned, being asked to rehash the night. He just wants to forget, he said. But he can’t. His younger brother, Joel, can’t either.
“It’s crazy,” Jude said. “This is a 
position you never want to be in in your life.”
Gainesville Police said Jude, 21, 
a nursing student at Santa Fe Col-lege, shot Michael Crace, 20, three times near the chest in self-defense on April 2. They were in their apart-ment at Mill Run Condominiums, located off Southwest 20th Avenue.
Jude Rizzo has not been charged, 
though the case remains open as detectives await Crace’s autopsy results, said GPD spokeswoman Cpl. Angelina Valuri. That could take months.
Tabitha Hardy, one of Crace’s 
former co-workers at Moe’s South-west Grill, said Crace and the Rizzo brothers did not get along. Crace wanted to ﬁ  ght them, Hardy said. They weren’t paying rent, she said.
But Jude insists this isn’t true. 
They were friends. He met Crace four months ago — their girlfriends were roommates. Jude said he and Crace liked each other from the be-ginning, and Jude moved in with him in February.
They worked out together at 
Powerhouse Gym on West Univer-sity Avenue. He, Crace and their girlfriends liked to watch movies together.
The week before Crace died, 
though, Jude said he changed. One day, Crace pointed his gun at his Man recounts night

TYPE OF WEBSITE.

Morgan Russell didn’t know her Apple computer could 
get a virus, but it turns out her Mac isn’t as invincible as 
she thought.
About 600 Mac computers on the UF campus were sus-
pected to be infected with a Trojan virus called Flashback as of Thursday, said Jim Hranicky, an information security monitoring specialist for UF’s Information Security team. The team is monitoring computers on the UF networks in search of the virus.
“This is one of the bigger infections that I’ve had to deal 
with,” Hranicky said.
Russell, a 19-year-old marketing sophomore, received 
an email from UF DHNet Internet Services on Wednesday saying there had been an outbreak of a new virus among Mac computers on campus.
An update, sent Thursday evening, recommended us-
ing the free ClamXav software to prevent infection. For computers already affected, it suggested downloading a Java security update from Apple’s website. It also recom-mended that Mac users run their computers’ built-in Soft-ware Update feature.
The virus, which can be acquired while visiting almost 
any type of website, allows hackers to access personal in-formation such as passwords and bank account numbers, said Ross Newman, CEO of iHospital, a computer repair business.
“It does have the potential to do great damage,” he 
said.Virus affects about

UF students who have not had 
chickenpox or its vaccine should be-
ware of the itchy virus in the upcoming weeks. It has been steadily infecting students in Alachua County schools.
The Alachua County Health De-
partment has reported 70 cases of chickenpox since January, 65 of which have been in the northwest part of the county.
“We are concerned that, given the 
foothold that this disease has been able to gain in this part of the county, there is potential for this outbreak to increase in all parts,” said Paul Myers, admin-istrator of the Alachua County Health Department.
There is an onslaught of symptoms 
before bumps appear, including a fe-ver, UF Student Health Center Director Dr. Phillip Barkley said. It is common to not suspect the virus until the itchy blisters surface.
Barkley said the fact that UF does 
not require its students to receive the Varicella vaccination before they start classes has caused concern on campus.
“It is something that we may want 
to look into changing,” Barkley said.
There have been no cases of chick-
enpox reported on UF’s campus this year, he said.
Students who have not had the vi-rus or been vaccinated for it should get vaccinated as soon as possible.
The Student Health Care Center of-
fers the vaccine to students who call ahead or walk in.
The affected schools include Ala-
chua Elementary School, W.W. Irby Elementary School, High Springs Community School, Mebane Middle School, Santa Fe High School, Bhak-tivedanta Academy and the Alachua Learning Center.
The county health department has 
demanded that unvaccinated students at those schools stay home until the week of April 25, Myers said.

alligator Staffcess to top universities to wealthy 
students.
Scott asked what UF and FSU 
plan to do with the extra tuition money.
“The key to quality, from 
where I sit, is faculty,” said UF President Bernie Machen.
More faculty members will 
yield more research, which means UF will be able to snag more re-search dollars, he said.
The governor thanked Machen, 
Barron and the other university officials for coming to Tallahassee to present their arguments.
“It’s always interesting to get 
everybody’s perspective when you go through a decision like this because you want to make sure that families in this state can afford a great education,” Scott said.
He has about a week left to 
sign the bill, and he said he expects more people to weigh in on the subject 
before he makes his decision.
“I think he’s 
seriously trying 
to do what he thinks is the right thing,” Machen said. “I think it was time well spent.”

Joshua Horton, a 27-year-old fifth-year computer engineering Ph.D. student, protests budget cuts in the 
Department of Computer and Information Science and Engineering with Graduate Assistants United. 
Dean said she will accept input on proposal until Wednesday
neering departments would irrepa-
rably damage some, she said. The CISE department is one of 10 within the College of Engineering.
Students from Graduate Assis-
tants United fired questions at Ab-ernathy , often interrupting her to call for more specific answers. They raised concerns about the possibili-ties of losing faculty members, not graduating with the research experi-ence employers want and harming the college’s reputation.
“We feel that we are targeted, and 
we want a better explanation,” said 26-year-old Ph.D. student Christan Grant. 
At the Faculty Senate meeting 
Thursday afternoon, Provost Joe Glover told attendees that Aber -
nathy is the first dean to publicly discuss her response to the budget. Every dean will have to deal with the cuts, he said.
Jose Soto, co-president of UF’s 
Graduate Assistants United, pre-sented the students’ demands. They want Abernathy to delay the an-nouncement of the final plan from April 19 to June 15 to allow more time for deliberation. They also want to see improved transparency.
Soto suggested that Abernathy 
not administer “unjustified cuts,” re-curring or not, to CISE. The students want Abernathy to maintain staff members slated for termination and require a majority vote among those affected to approve the proposal.
The senators also passed a reso-
lution that requires administration and faculty to share governance of removing or transferring a graduate program from any department.
Abernathy said she will accept 
input until Wednesday.
“We want to be included in the 
dialogue,” said 27-year-old Ph.D. student Sean Goldberg.

girlfriend, Jude said. Nobody called police. Jude 
wishes they did.
“That’s the one thing we’re all thinking,” he 
said. “The cops should have been involved before-hand.”
On the day he was killed, Crace appeared pale 
and sick at work, Hardy said. When he got home, Crace argued with his girlfriend. She left.
Jude said he drove with Crace to Cottage Grove, 
where the pair’s girlfriends lived. The couple ar -
gued again, and Jude heard Crace’s girlfriend screaming. This time Crace was on top of her, Jude said.
After the fight broke up, Crace took his girl-
friend’s keys and forced her into her car before driving to Mill Run. Joel, 19, was also there. From Crace’s room, he heard Crace’s girlfriend scream-ing. He was choking her, Jude said.
Joel helped Crace’s girlfriend back to her car. 
Later that night, Jude said he talked with Crace — told him he needed to cut the violence. They ar -
gued.
Jude went back to his room on the second floor. 
He packed boxers. He was going to spend the night with his girlfriend.Michael was standing in the front yard. He had 
just updated his Facebook status: “.38.” He opened the front door and pointed his pistol at Joel, who was sitting on the stairs. Joel screamed.
“My brother thought he was dead,” Jude said. 
“He told me he was warning me. He wanted me to leave.”
Jude grabbed his revolver from his nightstand. 
He bought the gun about a year ago for protec-tion, but he had never shot it before — not even at a range.
He ran to the top of the stairs. Joel was running 
toward him, Crace chasing him. Jude didn’t think. He pulled the trigger.
“When I came out, [Joel] jumped, thinking the 
gunshot was from Michael,” Jude said.
After his first shot, Jude’s “mind went black.” 
He doesn’t remember snapping the trigger two more times.
Last week, some co-workers from McAlister’s 
Deli helped Jude clean the apartment, but he hasn’t been back since. He can’t bring himself through that front door, where Crace’s body blocked the police officers’ entrance 11 nights ago.
But he still sees everything. The images keep 
coming back.

Elizabeth Graham will take the 
trip of her dreams this summer.
It’s not a cruise to the Bahamas or 
a week in Paris. It’s a trip to the 2012 
ESPY awards.
Graham was the winner of ES-
PNU’s Ultimate College Sports Fan contest.
Contestants submitted one-
minute videos saying why they be-lieved they were the biggest college sports fans. The grand prize is an all-expenses-paid trip for two to the ESPYs in Los Angeles.
The annual award show, hosted 
by ESPN, honors the best athletes and most memorable moments from the world of sports.
Graham, 23, is an electrical engi-
neering graduate student and has been at UF for six years. She said she is ecstatic her video won, and she cannot wait to get to California.
She’s taking her boyfriend, Alex 
Everett, a 21-year-old chemical engi-neering senior.
“When I heard about the contest, 
I didn’t even know about the prize,” Graham said. “Most of my friends will tell you that I am one of the most passionate fans, so that’s why I decided to enter — because I knew I fit the description.”
The video submissions were 
judged based on ratings given by viewers, creativity, relevance to the contest theme and entertainment value.
After the judging period was 
over, five finalists were chosen for a voting round. Whoever got the most votes on Facebook by April 3 won the grand prize.
Graham said she spread the 
word through Facebook and Twitter while enlisting the help of friends and family.
“My mom basically sent out an 
email to her entire address book,” Graham said. “One of my mom’s co-workers said she thought the video actually undersold how big of a Gator fan I am, but I only had one minute.”
Telecommunication sophomore 
Daniel Gibble, 20, said he was go-ing to enter the contest too, but he missed the deadline.
“It’s probably a good thing I 
didn’t enter,” Gibble said. “Eliza-beth seems like a much bigger sports fan than I am.”
Graham, who has attended at 
least one sporting event for every sports team at UF, said her love of Gator sports began before she ever set foot on campus.
Graham said she remembers 
watching her first Florida basket-ball game and knew she was in for something special.
“I remember following them all 
the way through the tournament, and then they won! After that, I knew I was going to go to every single basketball game.”
Until she leaves for the July 11 
award show, Graham said she’ll continue doing what she does best: cheering on her teams.
“Yes, there’s a crappy feeling 
you get when you lose,” Graham said, “but fortunately for me, I go to a school like Florida where that doesn’t happen as much. I get to ex-perience the amazing feeling of us winning a lot more than the disap-pointment of us losing.”FRIDAY, APRIL 13, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 5

After they were inspired by judging a craft 
beer competition three years ago, a handful of 
beer enthusiasts decided to find a way to bring craft beer awareness to Gainesville.
Nonprofit home brewing club Hogtown 
Brewers will host the Hogtown Beer Festival from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday at Kanapaha Botanical Gardens.General admission is $35 and VIP admis-
sion is $75. Tickets are available online at www.hogtownbeerfest.com.
All proceeds will go to Alachua Conserva-
tion Trust and St. Johns Riverkeeper, two or -
ganizations that work to protect North Central Florida’s natural resources.
VIP guests can get into the event an hour 
early and sample appetizers and beers that aren’t available to general admission guests.
Craft beer typically refers to breweries that don’t produce as much beer volume-wise as national breweries, said Alex Preis, a member of Hogtown Brewers.
“There has been a huge surge of beer 
awareness in Florida and, in particular, an ex-plosion of craft breweries,” Preis said. 
The festival will feature seminars discuss-
ing types of beer as well as home brewing demonstrations, a Q&A session with Florida head brewers and beer from 27 local and na-tional breweries. There will also be live music by Gainesville’s Parcel of Rogues and Jackson-ville’s Robin Rutenberg and Friends.
“Home brewers are the best ambassadors 
for craft beer,” said Hogtown Brewers mem-ber Mark Tumarkin. “It is our passion. We love brewing, we love craft beer and we love turn-ing people on to it. That is the whole purpose of the event.”
He said he hopes to make the festival an 
annual event.
“We plan on growing into a truly notable 
event,” he said. “We want it to be a regional event that people look forward to coming to, and if all goes according to plan, it will be in a couple of years.”Craft beer festival to bring awareness of home brewing to town

Darts & Laurels
First up, how many times have you read a news article with 
a headline starting with “New study finds ...”? Most of the time these “studies” tell us things that make us say, “Duh!”
That’s why we’re throwing a stop-wasting-time-and-tell-
us-something-we-don’t-know DART at researchers from the 
University of Pittsburgh, Bradford, who found that texting in class creates learning problems.
This week, another contender for the Republican nomina-
tion dropped out of the race. So we’re giving a how-many-jokes-can-you-make-in-30-seconds-about-pulling-out LAU-
REL to Rick Santorum.
Thanks, Santorum. It was frothy.It is no secret that political campaigns can often get dirty 
and personal. 
For the most part, the mudslinging can make things ex-
citing and entertaining. However, when commentators start throwing mud at the candidates’ spouses or families, things go a little too far.
For saying that Ann Romney, the wife of the Republican 
Party contender, “has actually never worked a day in her life,” we throw a leave-the-families-out-of-this-and-let’s-focus-on-the-issues DART at Democratic National Committee adviser 
Hilary Rosen.
It doesn’t even matter whether her argument is sound or 
not; it has almost nothing to do with anything in this cam-paign.
Next up, we give a humble thanks-for-four-decades-of-
teaching-Gators LAUREL to David Denslow, an economics 
professor in the Warrington College of Business Administra-tion.
Denslow will officially retire May 15.Earlier this week, a request by 101 Cantina for a permit to 
serve alcohol in its parking lot for Cinco de Mayo was de-nied. 
That’s why we’re throwing a who-gives-a-crap-where-
you-buy-alcohol DART at the City of Gainesville for keeping 
this stupid ordinance on the books.
For refusing to install speed bumps in residential areas 
throughout Gainesville, we give a way-to-see-unintended-consequences LAUREL to the Gainesville City Commission.
While initially the idea of installing speed bumps in resi-
dential areas sounds like a good idea for safety reasons, the increased time it takes for emergency vehicles to arrive on the scene could create even more problems.
Have a fun and safe weekend, and be sure to check back 
next week!Government ought to butt out of energy
Politicians promise everything under the sun.
In his most recent State of the Union address, Presi-
dent Obama said, “Because of federal investments, re-
newable energy use has nearly doubled, and thousands of 
Americans have jobs because of it.”
In the first half of 2011, renewable energy accounted for 
14.3 percent of domestic energy production, up from 10.4 percent in 2009.
It’s fine and dandy for the U.S. to increase its renewable 
energy production, but the government ought to butt out of the energy sector.
Why is the government involving itself in the energy con-
versation?
Washington believes it must transform the U.S. into a 
clean-energy economy, essentially because countries like Germany and China are trying to do the same. Because the U.S. is the best country in the world, it must show the rest of the world that Earth’s top dog is, in fact, still on top.
Government intervention in the energy sector is nonsen-
sical, and the statement by President Obama proves it. 
The president claims that because of federal investment in 
renewable energy production, Americans have more jobs. To borrow a term from George Orwell, this is “duckspeak” — to talk without thinking.
Ever heard of the broken-window fallacy? Let’s say that 
someone throws a rock and it breaks the window of a karate dojo. Now the sensei must spend money to hire a window repairman to fix the window instead of using the money to hire a new instructor, buying a new car or investing. The bro-ken window diverts capital from where it would have natu-rally gone and spends capital elsewhere.
The same is true when it comes to government.Government spending to promote clean energy and green 
jobs does so at the expense of where the market would have allocated capital, and because the government has no profit incentive, it necessarily spends its capital less efficiently. In this way , the government cannot ever truly create any jobs or create any wealth.
So what should the govern-
ment do with the energy sector? Americans have heard both par -
ties clamor for an “all-of-the-above” energy approach, but the best is a “none-of-the-above” approach, as Roy Cordato of the John Locke Foundation says.
Government should stop 
spending our money to develop uneconomical energy sources. According to a report by the U.S. Energy Informa-tion Administration, by 2016, the cost per kilowatt-hour will be about 6.6 cents for natural gas and 9.5 cents for coal, while alternative energy will cost 8.6 cents for hydro, 9.7 cents for wind, 10.2 cents for geothermal, 11.3 cents for biomass, 11.4 cents for nuclear, 21.1 cents for solar (photovoltaic cells) and 24.3 cents for offshore wind.
Clearly, almost all forms of alternative energy just can-
not compete in the marketplace, so the government foolishly throws our money around — think Solyndra.
The energy issue should not be demagogued into a clean-
energy versus dirty-energy economy . Instead, the energy issue should be framed by which energy sources make the most economic sense.
It’s ironic that politicians are elected through a democratic 
model in which the will of the majority wins, yet they con-demn the same model in the energy business.
Government cannot create green jobs anymore than a 
broken window cannot and ought not to wastefully spend money to develop quixotic energy.
The best ideas in the energy sector will develop and even-
tually rise without government’s help, and it must be the people, with the collection of their individual choices, who make that decision.

Letters to the Editor
Article about arrest of transgender person perpetuates 
stereotypes
Shame on Tyler Jett and the Alligator for publishing 
“Resident charged with shaking ‘his wee-wee’” on April 
6. I believe this article exhibits extreme bias.
This type of journalism perpetuates stereotypes and 
the fear of people who are transgender. Transgender in-dividuals regularly face discrimination and violence. Why would the Alligator want to add to and promote this type of bigotry and potential for violence?
I perceived the article as offensive, biased, rude, de-
meaning and blatantly ignorant on many levels.
I personally know Zot as an upstanding, honest, hard-
working, trustworthy community member who spends a great deal of her time working for social justice. She regu-larly fights for the rights of all people.
It’s bad enough that the article presents the allegations 
as factual, but its use of Zot’s gender status to sensational-ize the story adds to my reaction of shock and disgust.
This type of ignorance has no place in a newspaper that 
is associated with a university campus where education is supposedly revered. In my opinion, this was extremely irresponsible journalism that created the potential for se-verely harmful consequences.
I believe that the Alligator and Tyler Jett have an ethical 
obligation to provide Zot Szurgot with a written apology that is published in the Alligator in the name of respon-sible journalism. I also request that a separate article be published, along the lines of “An Education in Transgen-der Cultural Competency,” in which detailed factual in-formation is provided on how to be an ally to transgender people.
I am part of an organization called Spectrum Trans 
Awareness. We have been doing free Cultural Competen-cy Trainings on Transgender Awareness in the Gainesville community since 2010.
We started this organization because this type of preju-
dice is far too common in our community. We would like to offer our services to the staff of the Alligator to assist them to become educated about these issues and to pro-vide responsible journalism regarding gender issues to the community.
We would also be happy to assist in writing the educa-
tional piece regarding transgender cultural competency.Please feel free to contact us at spectrumgainesville@
yahoo.com for more information.

The Alligator should “Dart” itself
The next time the Alligator jumps to conclusions based 
on police reports, think again.
Zot Szurgot is a very good, longtime friend of mine. 
He’s also one of the most decent, caring people I know.
Perhaps it was not anything more than stepping out of 
a house on a warm Gainesville day into a secluded yard and taking a whiz.
The neighbors with a grudge called in a complaint. They 
were also, according to the Sun’s article, 100 feet away.
The dart goes to you.

President Obama is right to claim that 
the Republican Party has been “radi-cal” and “extremist” in its approach 
to deficit reduction. I welcome his refresh-ingly blunt rhetoric.
The president clearly realizes his re-
election hangs partially on his ability to contrast his record and ideas to those of the GOP . Theoretically, that shouldn’t be hard to do.
The president’s legacy throughout most 
of this great recession has been attempt-ing to maneuver around unprecedented obstruction by the Republican Party posi-tioning to regain power. 
The GOP has been clear from the be-
ginning, in the midst of a national crisis, that it would do whatever it took to ensure Obama fails.
Sadly, Republicans have reacted to the 
recession and Obama’s re-election by mov-ing much further to the right of the politi-cal spectrum.
Against all evidence in inflation rates, interest rates and the bond market, the GOP is convinced deficit reduction is not only the top priority, but also a magical key to prosperity. This couldn’t be further from the truth.
In fact, severe cuts in government 
spending during a recession will suck critically needed demand from a fragile economy, as was seen in Japan during its Lost Decade and in the U.S. in 1937.
Put simply, governments choosing to 
tighten their belts during times of reces-sion rather than times of prosperity face the risk of cutting off their circulation.
Why the sudden obsession with defi-
cits? A recession climate of high unem-ployment, slow business and low taxes would seem like an inopportune time to discuss them, considering significantly less revenue flowing in.
After all, Republicans in recent times 
have rarely cared about running huge def-icits when they were busy funding wars and awarding enormous tax breaks to the wealthy.
The answer is 
that there are deep-er motives that have nothing to do with 
deficits or debt. 
It may not be the best time to balance 
the budget, but for ideological conserva-tives, it is the best time to force painful cuts to programs that provide security and opportunity for ordinary people.
Therefore, the GOP is willing to hold 
the nation’s solvency and recovery hos-tage (as it did during the chaotic debt-ceil-ing crisis during the summer) to dismantle functions of government that the middle and lower classes rely on.
Following the lead of tea party dema-
gogues like Paul Ryan and Allen West, Republicans clamoring for office rush with new enthusiasm to cut basic safety nets and privatize our basic securities. 
Students have become very familiar 
with the relentless attacks on public edu-cation occurring throughout the country.
Equally offensive is the GOP budget 
coming from Congress that plans to end Medicare and replace it with an inade-quate voucher system. 
If the true intentions of these cuts could 
not be transparent enough, the budget plans to redistribute much of the savings to the rich in the form of more tax cuts.
President Obama called this plan 
“laughable,” taking on the tone of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s 1936 re-election campaign. 
In 1936, the GOP’s own words and ac-
tions allowed the president to paint them as a laughing stock. Isolating his oppo-nents, Roosevelt would laugh his way to victory.
Given the state of the GOP today, it 
won’t take extraordinary effort to re-em-ploy that strategy.

Florida right-handed starting pitcher Hudson Randall throws against William and Mary on Feb. 24. Ran-

Everything was set in an or -
derly way when the Gators began 
their 2012 campaign. 
With Hudson Randall, Karsten 
Whitson and Brian Johnson, Flor -
ida was one of the few teams in the nation that would return its entire weekend rotation. 
It was an area of comfort, as 
the Gators assumed that one of the best pitching staffs in the Southeastern Conference would only grow to get better. 
“We’re in a good place,” UF 
coach Kevin O’Sullivan said be-fore the season. “But the bottom line is they’re going to have to work hard and they’re going to have to improve.”
Entering this weekend’s series 
at Tennessee (20-13, 6-6 SEC), No. 7 Florida (26-7, 7-5 SEC) brings a rotation different from the one that made headlines in February. 
The starter for the opener to-
night at 6 is Jonathon Crawford, a sophomore who threw 3.2 in-nings as a freshman. 
Saturday will be Whitson, who 
has thrown just 7.2 innings in an injury-shortened season. Sunday is unknown. 
Typical Friday night starter 
Hudson Randall missed last weekend’s series against LSU with what O’Sullivan described as a “tired arm.” 
As of Thursday, the staff had 
yet to reach a decision on wheth-er or not he will pitch this week-end, leaving Sunday’s matchup against Tennessee right-hand-er Nick Williams “to be an-nounced.” 
“I have not spoke with our 
trainer yet,” O’Sullivan said Tuesday night. “I’m hoping he’s back. … We’ve got a couple days to work with.”
Randall’s last outing was his 
only loss of the season, a six-in-ning appearance at Ole Miss that began a slide for the Gators dur -
ing which they lost five of seven. After dropping from No. 1 on Monday and defeating new No. 1 Gators battling uncertainty with rotation entering ‘Vols series

Billy Donovan’s coaching staff did not 
remain undermanned for long following 
last week’s departure of assistant coach Norm Roberts.
On Thursday, Donovan announced the 
hiring of Rashon Burno, a 33-year-old for-mer assistant coach at Manhattan College, to replace Roberts, who left Florida for a similar post at national runner-up Kansas.
“This is a golden opportunity for me to 
come in and learn the business from a fu-ture Hall of Fame coach,” Burno said in a university press release. “How many guys can say that? It’s a blessing.”
Burno has been a college assistant coach 
for two years but was part of Jaspers coach Steve Masiello’s first-year staff that helped turn Manhattan into a 21-13 club just a year following a 6-25 campaign.
“He’s a great worker and a high-charac-
ter guy,” Donovan said. “He’s almost at a point now where he has a chance to grow into something special. He probably has some things he’ll need to learn and grow, but he’s got a great upside. And he’s really invested into our program because of the opportunity being given him.”
Before helping guide the Jaspers to a 
winning record, Burno began his coaching 
career in 2010 at Towson with his former college 
coach Pat Kennedy. 
Burno played at DeP-
aul under Kennedy from 1998-2002 and was the team captain for his last three years. Like current UF guard Mike Rosario, 
Burno is a graduate of St. Anthony’s High (N.J.), where he won two national champi-onships.
The hiring of Burno solidifies the 
Gators’ coaching staff one day into the col-lege basketball late signing period. Florida has one scholarship available after Walter Pitchford transferred.

The Gators’ Senior Day on Saturday 
will be an unusual one.
They will only be honoring one play-
er: attacker Caroline Cochran.
Unfortunately for the team’s lone se-
nior, her final season was over almost 
before it had a chance to begin.
Cochran, who tore the ACL in her 
left knee on Feb. 15 during UF’s home opener against Jacksonville, will watch from the sidelines as No. 5 Florida (13-2, 3-0 American Lacrosse Conference) takes on No. 17 Vanderbilt (7-5, 1-3 ALC) in its final home game of the sea-son.
“I’m still not over it,” Cochran said. 
“It’s really upsetting. It’s not fun to sit on the sidelines.”
After transferring to Florida follow-
ing her freshman year at Virginia in 2009, Cochran scored 46 points com-bined in her sophomore and junior sea-sons.
Once her knee buckled after chang-
ing direction while trying to defend a Dolphins attacker, Cochran knew her career at UF was potentially done. She had torn the ACL in her right knee sev-en years ago and knew from the feeling it was the same injury.
“As soon as it happened, I knew it,” 
Cochran said. “I heard it.”
While she has been sidelined most of 
the season, Cochran has stayed around the team to rehab her knee and be around her teammates, who Cochran Injured Cochran to sit out

said provided a solid support system 
in the days following the injury. Coach Amanda O’Leary said Cochran’s pres-ence has also been a benefit to the team, even if she isn’t on the field. 
“She’s a great listener,” O’Leary said. 
“As an upperclassman and as a senior she’s been through a lot of things, and she’s been really helpful to our younger players.”
Junior attacker Kitty Cullen was im-
pressed by Cochran’s attitude from the outset of her rehab, noting that it can only help to have someone with such a positive personality around the team.
“She could’ve gotten hurt and blown 
the rest of us off,” Cullen said. “She didn’t do that at all. She had such a great attitude. Even the day after she found out her ACL was torn, she had such a positive outlook on everything.”
While the Gators have been success-ful on offense this season, leading the country in both goals and goals per game, losing Cochran left a void in the offense that O’Leary has had to fill in unconventional ways. 
As a left-handed attacker, Cochran 
could naturally attack from the left side, something none of the other starters could do.
“She gave us the opportunity to work 
the left side of the field,” O’Leary said. “Gabi (Wiegand) can go on that left side. (Caroline) Chesterman can go on that side, but it’s always nice to have a true lefty.”
While she is upset her career end-
ed with an injury, Cochran said she is proud of what her teammates have ac-complished this year and she is looking forward to walking on the field one last time as a Gator.
“It’s obviously going to be really 
sad,” Cochran said. “I know that I will be really emotional, but I’m sure it will be exciting as well.”

� GATORS PLAY TIGERS TONIGHT AT 
6 AT PRESSLY STADIUM.
JONATHAN CZUPRYN

Everyone is looking forward to the 
weekend, especially the Gators.
No. 3 Florida lost another midweek 
matchup Wednesday night when it was 
shut out against UCF in Orlando. Just two weeks earlier on March 28, UF dropped a home game to USF, so Florida (35-5, 15-2, Southeastern Conference) will look to use its weekend series against Auburn (26-15, 5-11 SEC), starting Friday night at 6, as re-demption.
Thankfully for the Gators, their series 
against the Tigers doesn’t fall on a week-day, as three of their five losses have been midweek games.
But Michelle Moultrie isn’t worried.“We’re fine,” said the senior center 
fielder. “We’re just going to reflect on it and move on.”
And although the seasoned Florida 
veteran doesn’t see a problem, sopho-more Cheyenne Coyle hinted at the team’s struggle to come back in a game after los-ing to USF.
“It’s important to get the runs back as 
soon as possible,” Coyle said. 
“The longer you wait to get the runs back, the harder it is going to be. If they strike first, we have to fire back right away.”Coyle said she wanted her team to fo-
cus on that in last week’s midweek against FSU but her words could not carry over into this week. 
Just as they did against the Bulls, the 
Gators fell behind by two runs in the first inning against the Knights on Wednesday and never found a way to jumpstart their offense.
Scoring in midweek games has been a 
problem all year for Florida. On a Wednes-day or Thursday, the Gators average just more than four runs per game. But ev-ery other day, they average nearly seven runs. 
The difference is night and day when 
comparing Florida’s last weekend series against Ole Miss to its last three Wednes-day games against USF, FSU and UCF. 
Against the Rebels, the Gators averaged 
9.3 runs per game, while in three midweek games, UF managed just 10 combined runs   
 — with nine of those coming against the 
Seminoles. 
Still, Hannah Rogers places the blame 
on the opposing pitchers and not her team’s offense.
“Their pitcher came out ready to play,” 
Rogers said after the loss to UCF. “(She) did a really good job keeping us off the bases and not allowing us to get hits.”
But if the Gators look to make their fifth 
consecutive Women’s College World Se-ries, their offense will have to learn to put up a fight against the nation’s top pitchers, especially when falling behind early in a game like they did against USF and UCF.FRIDAY, APRIL 13, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Looking for the Gators’ weak 
spot can be quite a challenge. 
No. 2 Florida (17-1, 10-0  South-
eastern Conference) has won 12 
straight matches dating back to late February, shut out seven of its last eight opponents and has only lost five points to conference foes.
Six players are ranked nation-
ally in singles, including three in the top 25. 
Two doubles teams are also in 
the top 20, including the nation’s top-ranked team. 
However, if there had to be one question mark for the de-fending national champions with the postseason rapidly approach-ing, it’s the Gators’ No. 3 doubles team.
With a combined record of 
33-3 for the top two doubles teams, Florida has not frequently had to worry about how the third team performs. 
The postseason, however, 
could be different. 
If one of the top two doubles 
teams were to lose, the Gators would need their No. 3 team to win to secure the doubles point. 
Coach Roland Thornqvist in-
sists there is no concern. In fact, he is confident in whichever two players form the No. 3 doubles team. 
“We play a little differently 
at three, but we’re effective,” he said. “We have three players 
rotating at that 
spot.  It’s nice for us to have something that we can really focus on at this point in the sea-son.”
While the 
wins the teams are racking up may not be dominant, he said that winning is all that matters.
“We’re winning (at No. 3). 
Some of them are 8-6, 8-5, may-be 9-7, but we’re winning,” he said. “I think we are getting bet-ter. Sometimes we get caught up looking at one being done in 40 minutes, two being done in 42 minutes and three’s winning in 55 minutes, and we’re not happy with that.” 
Between Alex Cercone, Olivia 
Janowicz and Caroline Hitimana, the Gators have three players who can be paired together to play on court No. 3. 
The pairings of Cercone and 
Janowicz and Hitimana and Janowicz have gone 7-2 and 4-0, respectively. Cercone and Hiti-mana are 2-1 together. 
While those records indicate 
plenty of success, Thornqvist also sees room for growth, even at this point in the season. Having all three doubles teams 
firing on all cylinders would be a huge plus for the Gators heading into the postseason.
“Looking at film, we do need 
to get better at some court posi-tioning,” he said. 
“We’re not taking advantage 
of some chances to poach. We’re not serving at the right spot some-times. There are some details that I really think we can clean up eas-ily. “
The Gators will have a chance 
to work on that last doubles spot on Saturday, when they close out their regular season at No. 27 South Carolina. 
The No. 10 men’s team (13-8, 
6-4 SEC) will play the Gamecocks at home at 1 p.m. at Linder Sta-dium.
Second-ranked Gators still tinkering with third doubles team
Thornquist
Women, men play South Carolina todayFlorida State on Tuesday, Florida is look-
ing to get back to where it was before the season took a bad turn. 
The rotation is changing on the fly, but 
it might not matter. 
Although the Volunteers have picked 
up upsets of No. 3 Kentucky and No. 10 South Carolina this season, their lineup will hardly have Florida pitchers con-cerned. 
No team in the SEC has fewer hits or 
RBI than Tennessee this season. Only Ala-bama, owners of a 13-20 record this year, has scored fewer runs or registered a lower team batting average than Tennessee. The Gators have won nine out of their last 10 meetings with the Volunteers, outscoring them by a combined final of 63-17 in those nine victories. 
Aside from all of this, Florida isn’t 
changing its tune. Thus is the case when a loss to North Florida and two winnable lost causes against LSU are still fresh on the mind. 
“We’ve got obviously a tough weekend 
series against Tennessee,” O’Sullivan said. “Obviously this weekend we will have played 12 out of 15 on the road. It’s been obvious that we haven’t played our best baseball.” 
Tennessee is a chance to continue to re-
ignite a season that was destined for great-ness not too long ago and work through another weekend with a pitching rotation different than the ones fans have come to expect.LANDON WATNICK

Ashanée Dickerson’s performance put 
her in the spotlight last Saturday, but an-
other UF gymnast pieced together an im-pressive NCAA Regionals showing. 
In No. 1 seed Florida’s victory, sopho-
more Alaina Johnson stepped up in a big way as well, recording a 39.55 to place sec-ond behind Dickerson (39.65). 
Johnson also shared the vault (9.95) and 
uneven bars (9.9) titles with Dickerson. In her other two events, Johnson tallied 9.85. 
“Her vault was gorgeous,” coach Rhon-
da Faehn said. “All around, she did a spec-tacular job. She’s just competing with such energy and passion this year. It’s really nice to see her taking it all in, understanding it and loving it.” 
UF has taken a different approach with 
managing Johnson this season after she struggled with peaking at the right time in 2011. Throughout her career, she has dealt with stress fractures in her ribs and shins along with soreness in her right elbow.
At last season’s end, she broke down 
physically due to repeated pounding on leg events such as vault and floor exercise.
“She has areas that tend to flare up if she 
does too much,” Faehn said. “It was always a matter of making sure if we have to cut her numbers down in training, then that’s what we have to do so she can be OK for the competitions.” 
For the coaching staff, it was a premium 
all year to keep Johnson as healthy as pos-sible in time for the postseason. Because of this, she did not compete as an all-arounder in four of her first six meets. 
So far, UF’s strategy with Johnson has 
worked well, as she seems to be reaching her zenith with NCAAs in one week. 
In five of her last six meets, she has re-
corded an all-around score of at least 39.40. In her three most recent competitions, she has averaged at least a 9.84 in each event. 
Johnson is also ranked fifth in the coun-
try individually this season with a regional qualifying score of 39.475.
“We’re all peaking when we need to be. 
That’s what we missed last year,” Johnson said. “Last year, we started earlier. This year, we started later, which has helped a lot.” 
Johnson’s growing confidence has also 
played a huge role in her recent rise. With a year of experience under her belt, she now knows what to expect when UF competes in Duluth, Ga., on April 20.  
“Season didn’t end the way we wanted 
it to last year,” she said. “That helps us want to give more effort and go even harder.”16, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, APRIL 13, 2012
