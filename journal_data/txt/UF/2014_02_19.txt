The Florida State University student 
who went missing two weeks ago was 
found dead Tuesday morning by Tallahas-see Police.
Ryan Uhre’s body was found in a build-
ing in downtown Tallahassee when inves-tigators checked an open window on the building’s second ﬂ  oor. Police were re-canvassing the area after Uhre, 23, showed up on surveillance-camera footage from a nearby alleyway.
Tallahassee Police spokesman Ofﬁ  cer 
David Northway said at a press confer-ence that foul play is not suspected, but the cause of Uhre’s death is unknown and still be-ing investigated. 
“We are keeping it 
open and active, and we will do everything we 
can in order to ﬁ  nd the cause of death for Mr. Uhre and his family,” 
Northway said.
Uhre was last seen leaving the area of 
Andrew’s Restaurant on Feb. 2 and was re-ported missing to campus police ﬁ  ve days later.
Northway said police are collecting fo-
rensic evidence, but because it involves chemical analysis, the results will take time to develop.
“We feel the profound loss of a life end-
ing far too soon, and our thoughts and prayers go out to Ryan’s family, which has shown much courage during the past few weeks,” wrote FSU spokeswoman Jeanette De Diemar in an email.

The ﬁ  rst day of voting in 
Student Government elec-
tions saw a lower turnout than the Spring 2013 semes-ter.
Supervisor of Elections 
Justin Hoover said 5,457 bal-lots were counted Tuesday. Last year, the ﬁ  rst day of vot-ing turned out 817 more bal-lots.
Hoover said there were a 
few minor technical difﬁ  cul-ties on the ﬁ  rst voting day, but all were resolved quickly.
One incident that arose 
Tuesday morning was that the sample ballot reﬂ  ected the Spring 2013 candidates, Hoover said. The issue was resolved in 15 minutes, and no students were unable to view and vote for current candidates.
Hoover said two students 
contacted the SG ofﬁ  ce about an error when trying to write in candidates. The issue was resolved by 9:30 a.m., and fewer than ﬁ  ve students were impacted. All the students were able to vote after the problem was resolved.
Around 4 p.m., a power 
surge at the CSE polling lo-cation caused the entire lab to experience technical dif-ﬁ  culties. They were unable to be resolved, and Hoover instructed the poll workers to immediately begin directing students to Marston Science Library.
Tori Corrado, an 18-year-
old UF biomedical engineer-ing sophomore, said her experience with the voting process was simple, and the instructions for voting were straightforward.
“I think voting is impor-
tant because it’s a chance to see what you want to happen on campus,” she said.

old UF criminology junior, said she had no difﬁ  culty Minor tech issues,

About two hours south of 
Gainesville, there was Trayvon 
Martin. About an hour north and 10 months later, there was Jordan Davis.  
With Gainesville left in the mid-
dle, locals are feeling the effects of the death of 17-year-old Davis and the trial of the man involved, Mi-chael Dunn.
In November 2012, Davis, from 
Jacksonville, was riding in a car with three of his friends 
when Dunn shot into their SUV. Dunn was recent-ly tried and found guilty of attempt-ed second-degree murder for ﬁ  ring into the car, but the jury could not 
decide on the murder charge for the death of Davis.
For some, the Dunn trial brings 
back memories of George Zimmer-man’s trial and the death of Trayvon Martin.
Sharon Davis, UF director of 
African-American Studies, said the deaths of Martin and Davis reveal a deeper problem.
“It’s a scary thing that so many 
people in society are trigger happy,” she said. “I have a 17-year-old neph-ew. It could have easily been him.”
Zimmerman’s case brought Flor-
ida’s Stand Your Ground law to the forefront of national discussion. This 
Dunn trial draws local reactions

At about 2 and a half minutes, 
Tuesday’s hearing in the Pedro 
Bravo case might have been its shortest yet.
After lawyers confirmed that 
taking depositions is going well, Judge Ysleta McDonald set anoth-er hearing for April 22. The trial of Bravo, the 20-year-old former Santa Fe College student accused of killing UF freshman Christian Aguilar in 2012, is due to start Aug. 4. Pretrial hearings are set for July 16.
Those are the days Christian’s 
dad, Carlos Aguilar, is focusing on.
“It’s a relief to know the date,” 
he said. “Hopefully, by the end of August, everyone will know the truth, and everybody will be able to say justice was served.”
But Tuesday’s hearing just 
served as a check-in on the attor-neys’ progress.
In January, defense lawyer Mi-
chael Ruppert told the judge that his witnesses numbered more than 100. State Attorney Brian Kramer previously explained the need to travel to collect some of his deposi-tions, and Tuesday he said he has set up dates to do so.
With these developments and 
the announcement of a trial sched-ule, Aguilar said he can see “the light at the end of the tunnel.”4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 2014

Last year was record-set-
ting for Florida tourism, and 
some ripples have reached the Swamp. 
More than 94.7 million visi-
tors came to the state in 2013, a number that exceeded the previous high of 91.5 million in 2012, according to a press re-lease from Gov. Rick Scott. 
It was also a good year for 
tourism in Gainesville. The city isn’t usually regarded as a tourist hot spot beyond people traveling to UF, but John Prich-er, the interim director of Visit-Gainesville, said that is starting to change.
Although it is hard to mea-
sure, Gainesville’s tourism is steadily growing, Pricher said. Last year Gainesville saw about 1.88 million visitors, compared with the 1.76 million in 2012 and 1.63 million in 2011. 
The university is Gaines-
ville’s “beach,” he said, because it draws people to the city and attracts national attention. But once people get here, they real-ize there’s more to do than visit campus. 
“We’re not a beach, and 
we don’t have an amusement park,” he said. “We have to be creative in trying to find our other markets.”
VisitGainesville’s role is to 
expose as many people as pos-sible to nature-based attrac-tions in and around the city such as springs, state parks and nature trails. 
Daniel Urban, a 21-year-old 
UF mechanical engineering ju-nior, said he doesn’t feel like there are enough options for visitors.
“I feel like most of the tour-
ism in Gainesville is focused on the partying scene and lacks options for those who want to spend their nights away from clubs,” Urban wrote in an email. “Areas like Paynes Prai-rie provide some alternatives, but there aren’t enough options overall, especially at night.”
However, UF’s Outdoor Ad-
venture Recreation President Nelson Anderson wrote in an email that the city has an exten-sive park system with enough sites to keep anyone busy for an entire summer. He said the La Chua Trail at Paynes Prairie is one of his favorites.
“On a sunny day, the trail 
can look like Disney World it’s so crowded,” he said. “It’s a 3-mile hike, and you will see more alligators and birds than you’ve seen in your life if the weather is right.” Gainesville reflects 
statewide tourism rise
� OFFICERS FOUND IT ON HIS LAPTOP.

Gainesville Police arrested a UF Ph.D. student Tuesday 
morning after officers reported he accessed child pornography 
on his laptop.
Officers arrested 26-year-old Abdulaziz Mohail Alshehri on 
three counts of promoting a photo/movie of a sexual perfor-mance by a child, according to an arrest report. 
In early November, Alshehri used the file-sharing program 
BitComet 1.3 to access child porn on the BitTorrent network and offered the files to be downloaded by others.
Law enforcement downloaded the files and found the IP 
address was leased by Cox Communications, according to the report. A Cox subpoena identified Alshehri as the account holder.   
A search of Alshehri’s room in Ridgemar Commons Apart-
ments, located at 3611 SW 34th St., revealed he lived alone and possessed a secure Wi-Fi router, according to the report. When forensic specialists searched Alshehri’s laptop at his apartment, they found several torrents with titles suggesting child pornog-raphy.
During questioning, Alshehri confirmed the Sony laptop 
was his. He also admitted to using BitComet and to watching child pornography on his laptop, according to the report. 
Officers booked Alshehri into the Alachua County Jail at 
about 11:40 a.m. Tuesday, where he remained as of press time. His bond has not been set yet.UF student jailed in

law was revisited by Dunn’s lawyers 
in their case. 
Kenneth Nunn, a Levin College of 
Law professor, said something needs to be done about the current law.
“There is this view that it is reason-
able to use deadly force against Afri-can American males while they’re ba-sically doing nothing,” he said. “The law symbolically suggests to people that this is acceptable behavior. That is concerning.”
After the Dunn mistrial, Ameri-
cans took to Twitter to voice their concerns. Users have been posting pictures with the sarcastic Twitter hashtag #DangerousBlackKids.
Awurama Acquah, a 19-year-
old UF telecommunication sopho-more, said she thinks the hashtag is a brilliant way to discuss how people should stop stereotyping.
“Young black people are not dan-gerous. They are normal kids,” she said. 
Davis and his friends had been 
playing music in their car when Dunn got into an argument with them about the noise level. Dunn then thought he saw a gun and fired into the car, Reu-ters reported.
Charles Goston, former Alachua 
County Democratic Black Caucus president, said the murders of the two teenagers show that, even with a black president, not much has changed in America.
“People are still flying rebel flags. 
They don’t only have the flag on their cars,” he said. “They got the rebel flag on their hearts.”

Voting continues today until 8:30 p.m.
with the voting process and that voting is important 
when it comes to “being involved on campus.”
Swamp Party spokeswoman Susan Webster said 
the first day of voting was successful for her party.
“We got very positive feedback from students and 
have enjoyed informing them about elections and our party,” she said. “Students have been extremely receptive to our qualified candidates.”
Taco Libre Party Student Body Treasurer candi-
date Micaela Montero Dokser said her party is focus-ing mainly on a social media campaign and spent the first day of voting creating Facebook 
posts and reaching out to students online.
Students Party spokesman Alex 
Klayman said he predicts general voting turnout to be lower this year.
“It’s confirming what we already 
knew,” he said. “Given the lack of 
competitiveness of the ticket, the turnout would be lower than usual.”
Voting will continue today from 8:30 a.m. to 8:30

A Lake Butler man died 
and three people were in-
jured early Tuesday after a semitruck crashed into a pickup on Interstate 75. 
At about 1:45 a.m., Ron-
ald W. Sapp, 33, was driving south in a pickup truck in the center lane of I-75 near Archer Road, according to a Florida Highway Patrol me-dia release.
The pickup truck moved into the right lane in front of a semitruck then abrupt-ly stopped, causing the semitruck to crash into its back. After the crash, both vehicles ran off of the road, according to the report.
The pickup overturned 
and ended up facing west on its left side. The semi skid-ded along the shoulder un-til it crashed into a group of trees, facing south.
Authorities pronounced 
Sapp dead on the scene at about 2 a.m., according to the report. 
Two passengers were in-
side the pickup with Sapp. Kristopher Doski, 29, of Or-mond Beach, and Michael P. Hammer, 52, of Lake City, were taken to UF Health Shands with serious injuries.
The passengers were not 
wearing seatbelts, according to the report.
James A. Gloss, a 62-year-
old Longwood resident, was driving the semitruck. He was taken to UF Health Shands with serious injuries.

BEE COLONIES HAS DOUBLED.
KELSEY MARTINEZ

The buzz about the decreasing 
honeybee population has motivated 
some Floridians to invest in a new hobby. 
Each year, the nation’s popula-
tion of honeybees declines by more than 30 percent. 
Meanwhile, the number of Flo-
ridian beekeepers has nearly tripled in the past decade, with more than 2,700 people currently combating the buzzkill. 
Researchers ﬁ  rst documented a 
decline in honeybee health around 2005, said Daniel Schmehl, postdoc-toral associate for UF’s Honey Bee Research and Extension Laboratory.
The problem is colony collapse 
disorder — the reduced population of adult bees in beehives.
Although the ultimate reason for 
the disorder is uncertain, researchers think pesticides, reduced nutrition, transportation and climate change are possible suspects, Schmehl said.   
Some Floridians realized the 
threat to the state’s agriculture and environment and are choosing to do something about it. 
“It’s a good thing that came out 
of a bad thing,” said Dennis Riggs, webmaster for the Florida State Bee-keepers Association. “A lot of peo-ple became concerned when they started hearing warnings that bees were in trouble.”
Schmehl said the increase in bee-keepers has more than doubled the number of Florida bee colonies from approximately 150,000 to about 400,000 in about eight years. 
However, the increased number 
of Florida beekeepers and colonies does not ensure proper beekeeping handling and instruction, he said.
UF’s Entomology and Nematol-
ogy Department offers a long-term training and certiﬁ  cation program for registered beekeepers. 
But for newbies, the department 
hosts the UF Bee College, a program for the general public that teaches individuals how to become better beekeepers. 
“It’s focused on education — 
maintaining your bees, starting bee-keeping — just acquiring those basic skills,” Schmehl said.
The program, which will be 
held March 7 - 8, offers more than 50 training, lecture and hands-on courses over a two-day period. It will take place at the Whitney Labo-ratory for Marine Bioscience in St. Augustine.  
“We’re just making everyone 
aware of the goodness and impor-tance of bees,” he said. “They realize it’s a doable hobby. It’s not some-thing that’s impossible.”Floridians buzz about

Although some UF students get ﬁ  red up over Student Gov-
ernment elections, the overwhelming majority just don’t. During last year’s elections, voter turnout accounted for 
just 20 percent of the UF Student Body. 
Hey, we get it: With trekking out to a polling location, wait-
ing in line and trying to make sense of the referendums, as co-median John Mulaney said, it is so much easier not to do things than it is to do them. 
However, the editorial board of the Alligator is beseeching 
you, readers, to take a few minutes and go vote. And it really takes just minutes. Polling locations are all over campus, includ-ing the Broward Hall basement, the Reitz Union computer lab and Southwest Recreation Center. The polling locations are open today from 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.
After all, SG’s decisions directly affect you. Although SG really only enters the general UF consciousness 
during election seasons, you should know that every week they meet to make decisions that inﬂ  uence every aspect of student life, including how your money is spent. 
According to the UF Bursar’s ofﬁ  ce, undergraduate students 
pay $17.35 per credit hour for the activity and service fee, or the money SG controls. Multiply that by 30 credit hours per year, as required by Bright Futures Scholarships to continue receiving funding, and then multiply that by four. Most undergraduates pay $2,082 in activity and service fees over the course of their education at UF. 
For the 2013-14 ﬁ  scal year, the amended activity and service 
fee budget totaled about $18.9 million.
Whether you’re paying for your own education, receiving 
scholarships or beneﬁ  ting from Bright Futures, someone — ei-ther yourself, your parents, organizations or the state — is pay-ing for you to be here, and you/they are giving money to SG for them to spend on your behalf. Don’t you want a say in how it’s spent?
This election’s ballot also has a constitutional amendment 
and two referendums you should know about before going in to vote. The amendment calls for updates to the language in UF’s anti-discrimination policy to include genetic information in the list of things UF and UF-afﬁ  liated organizations may not dis-criminate against. 
The ﬁ  rst referendum proposes changes to UF’s open-con-
tainer policy on gamedays to allow anyone of legal drinking age to carry an open container of alcohol on campus during home football games. 
The second referendum proposes a 50-cent-per-credit-hour 
Student Green Energy Fund fee to ﬁ  nance renewable-energy products on campus and update existing campus technology to be more eco-friendly. As a forerunner for sustainability, it makes sense that students would approve of this nominal fee for UF’s betterment. 
Bottom line, folks, go vote. We guarantee it won’t take any 
longer than stopping for coffee at the Library West Starbucks.

Our sun is amazing. It keeps us warm and keeps 
things lit. It’s pretty much the best thing to hap-pen to this solar system since sliced bread — 
well, before sliced bread, to be exact. I guess you could say we’re the sun’s Goldilocks child because to date, we are the only planet with observable life in our solar system. 
This is because Earth is the perfect distance from 
the sun, where we will not all freeze to death nor get scorched alive. The sun comprises approximately 99.8 percent of the mass of our solar system. 
Astronomers have a scale for the size of stars, labeled 
conveniently by the acronym O.B.A.F.G.K.M. Starting with “O,” the classiﬁ  cation lists in descending order from brightest to dimmest. On this list, our sun ranks up to a staggering G. Meaning, it’s not too big and not too bright. 
Our sun is only one of 100 billion stars in our galaxy. 
The next nearest star to us is 4.2 light years away. Each star has some sort of orbiting body. Therefore there are possibly billions of other planets out there. And that’s just in our own galaxy. 
The Hubble Space Telescope estimates that there are 
hundreds of billions of galaxies in our universe. To put it in perspective, we are one of eight planets — a rath-er small planet at that — that revolves around a star, which is one of more than a billion stars in a galaxy and one of a billion galaxies in our universe. 
With all the technology we have today, scientists 
still  have not found evidence of current ﬂ  ourishing life on other planets. The odds are against us though, due to the amount of unknown that exists in space. This is why most scholars say we simply cannot be alone in the cosmos. For the time being though, we have no proof. We may never ﬁ  nd proof, making our planet, abundant with life, all that more rare and precious.
Yet here we are, destroying the Earth. It’s a disastrous ecological 
domino effect. Carbon dioxide emissions from cars, aerosol, greenhouse gases and burning of fossil fuels are contributing to the hole in the ozone layer. 
Deforestation by the masses 
is taking away one of the only resources that can convert the CO2 into oxygen. This ozone 
hole is allowing the sun to come in hotter and brighter. That means stronger UV rays, causing problems such as more probable skin cancer all the way to reproductive problems in marine life. 
This heat is also melting our ice caps, devastating 
wildlife and ruining agricultural cycles. We all might lovingly refer to this as global warming.
The whole point of this column was to show how in-
signiﬁ  cant our place in the universe is, but through that, how signiﬁ  cant it really becomes. 
We cannot ruin the only place to survive lest we risk 
the extinction of our kind. It will not happen in our life-times, but one day humanity will ﬁ  nd themselves using resources far too quickly and will be lost in terms of what to do next.  
We are the future, and we have to care about this. It’s 
our responsibility. 
Many UF graduates will go on to become chemists, 
engineers or will hold public ofﬁ  ce. We can ﬁ  gure out alternative methods of energy through technology and policy making. 
But it’s up to us to recognize and repair. It’s cliche, 
but we’ve got the whole world in our hands. 
We’ve got one Earth, folks. Let’s be sure not to drop 
it.

Last week I wrote about how the re-
action of prominent Republicans to Coca-Cola’s “America the Beautiful” 
commercial reﬂ  ects conservative intoler-ance toward nonwhite and non-English speaking Americans.
In the past few days, policies proposed 
by Republican legislators have taken aim at another minority group that has been a frequent target of discrimination: the LGBT community.
Conservatives who oppose the legalization of 
same-sex marriage have recently suffered a series of major defeats.
The Supreme Court ruled in June 2013 that part of 
the Defense of Marriage Act, a federal law that forbade the government from recognizing same-sex marriages, was unconstitutional. 
In the months since the DOMA decision, courts 
in Utah, Oklahoma, Ohio, Kentucky and Virginia have all produced rulings either legalizing same-sex marriage or signiﬁ  cantly expanding the rights of gay Americans. 
Now that religious conservatives are losing the 
battle over same-sex marriage, they are exploring new avenues to discriminate against LGBT Americans.
A bill recently passed by the Kansas House of Rep-
resentatives would allow private businesses and gov-ernment ofﬁ  cials to refuse service to any marriage cele-bration, provided that the refusal is based on “sincerely held religious beliefs … regarding sex or gender.”
If enacted, this bill could deny LGBT Kansans access 
to vital social services such as counseling and employ-ment beneﬁ  ts simply because a government ofﬁ  cial or employer believes homosexuality or gay marriage to be immoral.
A bill proposed by a Republican representative in 
Idaho goes even further. The legislation would allow any “doctor, nurse, pharmacist, attorney, social work-er, ﬁ  reﬁ  ghter, police ofﬁ  cer, estate agent or insurance provider” to refuse service to gay Americans without risking the loss of their licenses. For example, this bill would allow 
doctors and police ofﬁ  cers to refuse life-saving emergency services to members of the LGBT community solely on the basis of their religious beliefs with no risk of be-ing ﬁ  red.
The Daily Beast’s Jamelle Bouie calls 
these anti-LGBT proposals a “close cous-in” of the Jim Crow laws of the segrega-tion-era South. Just as the Jim Crow laws 
legalized racial discrimination, Bouie argues, these bills would enshrine discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. 
Republicans at the federal level are also engaging 
in efforts to discriminate against LGBT Americans.  Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, recently introduced the State Marriage Defense Act. The bill would allow individual states to not recognize same-sex marriages that were performed in other states where the practice is legal.
This law represents a callous attempt to circumvent 
the DOMA ruling and allows continued discrimina-tion against LGBT Americans in the 33 states that have not yet legalized same-sex marriage. 
Conservatives have also sought to marginalize and 
demonize LGBT Americans through symbolic actions. 
Republican members of the House of Representa-
tives recently held an hour-long session on the House ﬂ  oor in support of “National Marriage Week,” during which conservative and religious groups vigorously promote anti-gay legislation. Rep. Ted Yoho, R-Fla., who represents Gainesville, was one of the members in attendance.
The tireless efforts of Republicans around the 
country to promote discrimination against the LGBT community demonstrate conservatives’ intolerance of anyone outside its base of old, white, straight, religious fundamentalists. 
The Republican Party’s inability to expand its sup-
port beyond this rapidly shrinking base spells serious trouble for its long-term viability.
Elliot Levy is a UF political science and public relations 
junior. His columns appear on Wednesdays. Anti-LGBT laws show intoleranceColumn
To say that Democrats will 
have a difﬁ  cult election cycle this year would be 
an understatement. Forget the fact that the majority of sena-tors up for reelection are Demo-crats who represent red states and that House seats are pretty secure. Forget the fact that the president is losing favorability each month while the economy struggles to grow. 
The reason why Democrats 
will undoubtedly face rough times ahead is the fact that their party seems to be embracing an anti-jobs agenda. 
At ﬁ  rst blush, this appears to 
be a ridiculous assertion. Why would a major political party advocate policies that hurt busi-nesses? But when you realize that the policy points Democrats are advocating — a minimum-wage hike, opposition to the Keystone Pipeline and a continual support of Obamacare — this assertion becomes more credible and even more worrisome. 
Start with the minimum-
wage increase. Let me ﬁ  rst make clear: I am not necessarily against a raise in the minimum wage. I think that increasing the wage to a reasonable rate in a healthy, booming economy may not be a bad idea. 
But right now we do not live in 
such times. The economy is still slowly trudging along. No real big boost in economic growth is occurring. But left-wing politi-cians and talking heads believe that raising the minimum wage will be an economic cure-all. The fact of the matter is, this pay hike will no doubt lead to many worker layoffs. 
Consider all of the mom-and-
pop stores struggling to make ends meet. With the cost of labor rising, keeping more expensive employees with low proﬁ  ts does not make economic or rational sense.
Businesses have to factor in 
the cost of labor to their budgets. In many industries, the budgets and proﬁ  t margins are very slim. With labor increasing, they have to change some aspect of their businesses to combat the cost difference. In some instances, some of the now more expen-sive employees would have to be let go.      
Yes, the people who man-
age to stay in the workforce will have more money at their dis-posal. But an important question remains: Will they spend that money or save it?
Democrats say spend it, 
which would lead to more mon-ey entering into the marketplace and strengthen the economy. I think these workers will save it. Think about it: If you are work-ing at a job that does not pay well, wouldn’t you be more like-ly to save what discretionary in-come you have until you really have to use it? 
Also, keep in mind that 1.1 
percent of Americans actu-ally earn minimum wage and the majority of that percentage are young employees our age working at their ﬁ  rst jobs. Guess which group the majority of lay-offs will affect?   
Consider next the Keystone 
Pipeline. Much to the chagrin of environmentalists, this project would create actual “shovel-ready” — to quote the president — jobs. Though there is some debate about the exact number, the reality is that jobs will be cre-ated, period. This work would have more net jobs than the proposed shovel-ready jobs the president promised — which, for the record, is zero. 
The left-wing politicians 
standing in the way of this proj-ect only hurts the Americans looking to work on it. 
And the last policy point — 
supporting the Affordable Care Act — is really no surprise. And though this topic is debated ad nauseam on cable TV and in the blogosphere, it is still a real problem for many Americans. 
The latest concern entering 
into the political arena comes from the recent Congressio-nal Budget Ofﬁ  ce study about Obamacare’s effects on having health care no longer tied to one’s job. 
Many will no doubt leave 
their jobs because of this. Whether or not you believe this is a good provision, you have to realize this is a disincentive for people to work. The economy does not need a decrease in al-ready bad workforce partici-pation-rate numbers. Add this reality to the many other aspects of the Affordable Care Act and you have an economic mess.
For many Democrats this 
year, it’s going to be hard to de-fend that agenda. Some pundits and pollsters believe that many Democrats will lose their jobs in Congress because of it. 
But the good news for the left 
is that at least all of the jobs in the executive branch are secure in 2014.

Last week, I spent my Wednesday 
night watching “Breaking Bad” episodes on Netﬂ  ix. 
Meanwhile, my best friend spent his 
Wednesday night hiding from the police and military forces in the streets of Caracas, Venezuela. He was one of thousands of students who marched peacefully all over Venezuela to express their dis-content with the government led by Nicolas Maduro. Luckily for him, he wasn’t one of the almost 100 stu-dents who were captured, arrested and tortured by the police. Luckily for him, he wasn’t one of the two students killed by gunﬁ  re.
Maduro took over Venezuela’s presidency after 
the death of Hugo Chavez in March of last year. Since then, Venezuela has suffered the worst scarcity, inﬂ  a-tion and murder rates in Latin America. Caracas, the capital, was ranked the third most dangerous city in the world in 2013. Every day, Venezuelans spend three to four hours in line to buy groceries or medicine. 
Monica Spear, a former Miss Universe, was mur-
dered while on holiday with her family. Hers is one of the 200,000 murders in Venezuela during the last 15 years. All of this happens while Venezuela sells oil at record high prices to the world.
The student protests have been going on since last 
Wednesday. Today marks one week of continuous manifestation. Yesterday Leopoldo Lopez, the leader of the opposition, turned himself in to government forces. But why doesn’t anyone know about this? Why doesn’t the situation in my country get the same atten-tion as troubles in Syria or Turkey? 
The answer: a media blackout from the govern-
ment.
In 2006, Chavez ordered RCTV, a channel with al-
most four decades of history, to close. Since then, many TV channels have been sold or have changed their edi-torial lines in favor of the government. Last year, with the selling of Globovision, Venezuelans saw how their last TV outlet was turned into a puppet of the govern-ment. Now Globovision has prohibited Henrique Capriles, one of the leaders of the opposition, to go on air.
There is also no paper for the newspa-
pers. El Nacional, a newspaper founded 
in 1943, had to reduce its publication to 14 pages due to lack of resources, so Venezuelans have fewer and fewer outlets from which to get their information. It’s almost as if George Orwell wrote the script.
However, when Orwell wrote “1984,” neither Twit-
ter nor Facebook existed. 
Social media has become the most powerful weap-
on available to Venezuelans. Hundreds of images have been shared through social media to raise awareness of the human rights violations taking place. Through social media, Venezuelans have let the world see what the government doesn’t want to be seen. 
Still, as politicized as this situation may seem, this is 
not a ﬁ  ght between left and right. Or, as the Venezue-lan government puts it, a ﬁ  ght between good and evil. 
The reality is that Venezuelans don’t have medicine. 
The reality is that Venezuelan supermarkets are empty. The reality is that more and more Venezuelan students and professionals ﬂ  ee the country to ﬁ  nd opportuni-ties abroad. The reality is that Venezuelans don’t have a neutral media outlet to get their news from. 
What the students in Venezuela are ﬁ  ghting for is 
for their human rights to be recognized and respected.
So, after reading all this, how can you help? Raising 
awareness of what is happening can be enough. Share the information through social media, but be careful. Remember, there is no “ofﬁ  cial information” because the government tries to control all news outlets. An-dreina Nash, a 21-year-old UF marketing and telecom-munication junior, helped by publishing a video called “What’s Going On In Venezuela (In a Nutshell),” which has gotten close to two million views on YouTube. 
Me? I’m giving my country a helping hand from far 
away by writing this column.

To honor military veterans who 
made sacriﬁ  ces for the U.S., UF is 
turning the tables and making a few sacriﬁ  ces for them. 
The Center for Entrepreneurship 
and Innovation is hosting the Vet-erans Entrepreneurship Program to help veterans with disabilities start businesses for free. 
UF is partnering with Oklahoma 
State University and the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga to bring the national program to Gainesville. It teaches veterans how to success-fully launch and grow businesses, according to a news release.
Director Michael Morris said he 
has emotional ties to the program.
“With disabled veterans, they are 
a classic underserved and highly de-serving segment of the population,” said Morris, an Air Force veteran.
Ronnie Davenport knows how 
difﬁ  cult the transition from military to civilian life can be. Davenport, a 24-year-old UF business junior, has six years of service under his belt, including a tour in Iraq. 
“All those veterans are so used 
to military service, and sometimes, that’s not the best way to run a busi-ness,” Davenport said. “A program like this could help them understand how to be successful in the civilian world.”
Applications can be found on the 
Center for Entrepreneurship and In-novation’s website and are due Feb. 28.

A chance encounter for Braden 
Mattson put the Texas-bred catcher 
on a one-way ticket to Gainesville. He played his freshman season at Texas Christian, where Chuck Jeroloman, the brother of former Gators catcher Brian Jeroloman, served as a volunteer assistant in 2011.
Mattson and Jeroloman stayed 
in touch as the catcher transferred to San Jacinto College. Eventu-ally, Gators hitting coach Craig Bell paid Mattson a visit and liked what he saw. 
The courting reaped dividends 
on Tuesday when Mattson’s single in the seventh drove in two runs to extend the Gators’ late lead, which they would not relinquish. No. 23 Florida (3-1), fueled by the seventh-inning offense, defeated Central Florida (3-1) 5-1 in McK-ethan Stadium. 
“He’s so ready for this. That 
kid was born to play baseball. His head is in the game at all the time. He loves it,” catcher Taylor Gushue said. “I told him before the game, ‘Dude, sometimes I’m nervous, and I look at you and I’m not nervous anymore.’ He’s that kind of kid.”
That calming effect manifested 
itself in a four-run seventh inning in which Florida benefited from a bullpen implosion by Central Flor-ida. After the two teams entered the seventh tied at one, right-hand-er Joe Marrota walked four batters, including junior Zack Powers for Florida’s go-ahead run. The free pass set the stage for Mattson.
Florida added one more in the 
inning on a Justin Shafer infield single to shortstop. The Gators sent 10 to the plate in the seventh for the first time this year. Gushue opened the scoring with a first in-ning solo home run landing just below the right-field scoreboard.
Lost in the opportunistic offense

Even though Florida’s most antici-
pated game of the year is in its rear-view 
mirror, it cannot afford to skip any steps in preparation for Auburn (12-11, 4-8 Southeastern Conference) tonight at 7 in the O’Connell Center.
Coach Billy Donovan said one of 
the most challenging parts of the No. 2 Gators (23-2, 12-0 SEC) having one of its best seasons in school history is dealing with contentment in the locker room.“We obviously had a week where we 
played two road games — it was two re-ally good wins for our guys,” Donovan said. “But right now, they don’t mean anything as it relates to going into this next game against Auburn. So are we willing to take ourselves all the way to the bottom and realize that we’re start-ing off at the bottom and now we obvi-ously have to build and prepare for this next them, and then after the Auburn game are you prepared to go all the way back down to the cellar again and have to prepare and have to go back up?”

For an in-state rivalry that always draws 
a large crowd, Gators-Seminoles matches 
are rarely close.
The trend continued Tuesday night.No. 5 Florida (7-1) beat Florida State (5-3) 
in a 7-0 sweep, improving its record against FSU to 54-1 all time. 
Freshmen Kourtney Keegan clinched the 
match with a 6-2, 6-0 decision to give the Gators their fifth shutout of the season. 
“I thought we were very aggressive,” 
coach Roland Thornqvist said. “We hit the ball really well, and we’re good when we’re hitting our pace and depth, and our play at the net was executed really well.”
Florida controlled the pace of the match 
from start to finish. Olivia Janowicz and Ste-fani Stojic won the first doubles match 8-1, followed closely by an 8-1 win from Brianna Morgan and Keegan. 
Belinda Woolcock had the only ace of 
the match and played well alongside Sofie Oyen. The pair did not finish but led their opponent 6-3 when the doubles point was clinched.
“I think we’re improving a lot, especially 
this semester,” Woolcock said of the chemis-try she has developed with Oyen. “I feel like our relationship on the court has gotten a lot better each match. When we have fun and Florida sweeps Florida StateSee bASebAll, p Age 15

Lauren Haeger prepares to swing at the plate during Florida’s 6-5 win against 
Tennessee on March 15, 2013, at Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium. 
SOFTBALL
JORDAN MCPHERSON
Alligator Writer @J_McPherson1126
After two successful years at the plate and 
in the pitcher’s circle, Lauren Haeger knows 
what is expected of her.
“I don’t really have a lot of pre-game jitters 
anymore, because I know how it’s going to be and how fast-paced the game is,” she said. “I know what coach (Tim) Walton’s expecta-tions are. I know what the routine is. I know how we do things.”
And with her best offensive showing of the 
early season, she lived up to those expecta-tions at the Easton Desert Classic last week-end.
The junior earned her second consecu-
tive league honor when she was named the Southeastern Conference Player of the Week on Monday. 
During Florida’s sweep of the UNLV-host-
ed tournament, Haeger posted a .533 batting average in ﬁ  ve games at Eller Media Stadium. Half of her eight hits left the park.
Haeger also pitched a complete game 
against Seattle in Florida’s opening matchup in Las Vegas, striking out six batters while drawing only two walks and one earned run in the Gators’ 8-1 win against the Redhawks.
Haeger attributes her success at the plate 
to her dual-role as a pitcher and a hitter.
“It’s good because I get the pitcher mental-
ity of it and I get the hitter mentality of it, and I think it works in my advantage most of the time,” she said. “It’s good because I can read pitchers’ spins well. I can see movement just because I do the same thing.”Haeger hopes to continue her success 
when No. 1 Florida (11-0) hosts Jacksonville (5-4) tonight at 6:05.
The Gators are 8-0 against the Dolphins in 
Walton’s tenure at Florida, winning the con-tests by a combined score of 57-6.
In its home debut, Florida also hopes to see 
continued improvement from its three fresh-men.
Despite starting the season batting .100, 
freshman outﬁ  elder Justine McLean now boasts a .348 average after posting a team-leading .538 clip at the plate in Las Vegas. 
Utility player Chelsea Herndon, who has 
been used mainly as a pinch hitter through Florida’s ﬁ  rst 11 contests, has logged three hits, including her ﬁ  rst career home run against then-No. 22 Minnesota, in ﬁ  ve at-bats.
Pitcher Delanie Gourley boasts a 4-0 record 
in the circle, including wins against then-No. 5 Michigan and Minnesota. The left-hander from Lakeside, Calif., boasts a 4.4:1 strike-out-to-walk ratio and has allowed only eight earned runs through 22 innings.
While McLean and Herndon had a slow 
start to the season, Haeger saw their potential immediately.
“They (the freshmen) totally bought into 
the system right away and they just wanted to start right away, and you can see it in their attitude,” Haeger said. 
“They listen to everybody. They just 
soaked in everything that was thrown their way and so I think that really helped them in the long run.”Haeger earns league honor 
following four-homer weekendwas the stellar debut of right-hander Logan Shore. 
The 29th-round pick of his home state Minnesota Twins struck out four and allowed three hits in a methodical 5.1 innings. 
His night, nearly identical to Hudson Randall’s 
collegiate debut against UCF on Feb. 24, 2010, mir-rored the efficient pitching the red-haired right-hander from Dunwoody, Ga., stymied hitters with his entire Florida career.
This time last year, Shore was dealing with the 
Minnesota snow. He didn’t make his first start as a senior for Coon Rapids (Minn.) High until May in sub-40 degree weather. Less than a year later, he took the mound against a veteran UCF lineup with seven juniors, a senior and just one freshman.
“I’m not going to say I knew he was going to 
pitch this well tonight, but it’s not surprising,” Gators coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “We don’t go out of state very often. Certainly we’re not going to go to Coon Rapids, Minnesota, for a right-hander, but there was something special about him. He’s mature. He’s competitive, and he’s very talented.”
Sophomore left-hander Danny Young followed 
Shore’s outing of one unearned run with 3.2 score-less innings to earn the win. 
UF hosts North Florida tonight at 7 before trav-
elling to Coral Gables for a three-game set against Miami.
Florida’s two heroes from Tuesday’s in-state 
matchup hail from South Texas and Southeast Minnesota. One player spent 2013 at a junior col-lege while the other at a city that is under a winter storm watch until Thursday.
The Gators huddled in the third-base dugout 
as the home crowd left the stadium after Young finished off the Knights. Audible congratulations could be heard for Shore from his teammates.
“It felt really good. I got a great group of guys. I 
couldn’t really ask for a better team to play behind me,” Shore said. “I’m looking forward to hope-fully keeping it going.”the second-best team in the country was 
more than a year ago on Feb. 4, 2013. Florida lost the next day to unranked Arkansas, which was 13-8 and 4-4 in the SEC heading into the matchup.
Last season’s squad then fell five 
spots to No. 7 with a 19-3 overall record and just that one conference defeat.
In the first contest against Auburn on 
Jan. 18, Florida needed 21 points from Casey Prather, who had just returned from a bruise in his right knee that caused him to miss the two previous games, to pull away late for a 68-61 victory on the road.
With Kasey Hill doubtful for Wednes-
day’s matchup due to a groin injury, Don-ovan said he has to continue to preach the importance of staying focused.
“The hardest thing right now in re-
gards to that is we’re dealing with re-ally good kids that are between 18 and 22 years old that are trying to figure their way in life and understand they have some great opportunities to learn and grow in a lot of different ways,” Dono-van said. “But at the same point, they’re human. They’re not robots. They’re not machines. The challenge I always talk to them about is are you prepared today to battle human nature? Human nature says let’s take it easy.”
Scottie Wilbekin said he is most con-
cerned about Auburn guards Chris Den-son and KT Harrell. The two are not only the Tigers’ leading point scorers on the season, but Denson also leads the SEC averaging 20.9 per game with Harrell just trailing at No. 5 with 19.2.
“They’re capable of going off with 
big nights, both of them, so we’ve got to do a better job this game on limiting their straight-line drives and just playing better on-ball defense,” Wilbekin said of Denson and Harrell.
But because only two of the Gators’ 
six remaining regular-season opponents have above-.500 records within the league, and with the SEC nearly sewn up, Florida could start implementing freshman Chris Walker and sophomore DeVon Walker more in its rotations to give him helpful playing experience be-fore the postseason.
“I think for Chris, because our front-
court for the most part stayed out of foul trouble, there wasn’t really a need for him,” Donovan said. “But I still think those guys could be called upon here on Wednesday night. And we could really, really need them. And they need to be ready to play.”

when we’re enjoying each other and compet-
ing, we always play at a really high level.”
It was more of the same for Florida head-
ing into singles play. Janowicz won the first singles match 6-1, 6-1, increasing her dual match record to 5-1 this season on the No. 1 court. The Gators led by two.
“The first match at home was a little hard-
er,” Janowicz said. “I was a little nervous to play [the] one [position], but I think now af-ter competing against really good teams and getting some huge wins and climbing up the ranking, I feel more confident.”
Janowicz was the No. 11 ranked singles 
player in the nation last week, and her rank-ing should continue to rise.
“Really, most of it is on the mental side, 
not necessarily just forehands and back-hands,” Thornqvist said. 
“[Olivia] looks more comfortable, more 
confident, and I thought she was flawless to-day or close to it.”
After Janowicz’s win, Morgan won the 
next singles match 6-3, 6-0, followed by wins in straight sets from Keegan, Oyen and Stojic. Alexandra Cercone rounded out the sweep with a 6-4, 4-6, 1-0 (10-5) victory.
The win was Florida’s second straight af-
ter a bitter loss to Northwestern at the Na-tional Team Indoors on Saturday. However, many of the players credited the loss as be-ing instrumental to their last two wins.
“I think it’s good early on to feel that pain 
of losing and be hungry to never have to feel it again,” Janowicz said.  
“So I think it was a really good lesson 
to learn, especially coming back and win-ning after that against [Southern California] who’s ranked even higher.”
Florida travels to the West Coast to play 
St. Mary’s on Saturday and No. 4 Stanford on Sunday.  The back end of the four-game road trip will feature No. 10 Texas A&M and Missouri.
“I told [the team] in the locker room we’re 
hitting the ball really, really well. And so our job now is to just have great legs for the weekend,” Thornqvist said. “We’re going to make sure we have full strength when we go out there and we’ll see what we can do.”16, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 2014
