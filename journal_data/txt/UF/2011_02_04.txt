SILVER SPRING, Md. — Police in Mary-
land arrested a man after finding his cell 
phone charging at the scene of a burglary.
Now Montgomery County police say 
25-year-old Cody Wilkins has been charged in other burglaries.
It began when a homeowner’s son arrived 
as a burglar was going through rooms in the home Friday. Startled, the burglar jumped out a window and fled.
The son called police, who searched the home and found a cell phone charging in an electric socket. The phone led police to Wilkins.
Police say Wilkins’ home was among those 
in the area that lost power last week when a snowstorm moved through. Arrest records say he’s been linked to other break-ins.
Wilkins was brought to a Montgomery 
County jail on $1 million bond. It wasn’t clear if he has an attorney.

Michael Bowe speaks at the City Commission meeting Thursday 
to appeal the petition that would allow his neighbor, Bruce Baber, to run a dog-walking business from his home.
n HE USED A UF CREDIT CARD TO 
FUND TRIPS TO MALAYSIA.

Alligator Staff Writer
A UF professor was arrested Jan. 27 by 
University Police on charges of funding trips 
to Malaysia on a UF credit card as far back as 2008, according to the police report.
Dov Borovsky, 67, worked in the Florida 
Medical Entomology Lab in Vero Beach, a division of the UF Institute of Food and Ag-ricultural Science.
According to the UPD report, Borovsky 
used his university card to pay for three sep-
arate trips to Malaysia for a total of $7,071.28 
over the course of two years.
Though he claimed the 
trips as university business, 
they were for an unrelated 
job with EntoGenex Inter -
national Ltd., a Malaysian-based company, according 
to the report.
Borovsky was reim-
bursed a total of $85,000 
over the years by EntoGenex, but kept the money for his own personal gain, the report 
stated. 
His actions were discovered during a per -
sonal audit by the UF Office of Audit and 
Compliance, the report stated.
Borovsky denied involvement with the 
company until faced with documented proof, at which point he said he had a relationship with the company and kept the reimburse-ments, as well as failed to report the com-
pensation and conflict of interest, the report 
stated.
Borovsky is charged with felony theft and 
fraud and has been placed on administrative leave, said UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes.Police say

The City Commission overturned an earlier rul-
ing Thursday that allowed Bruce Baber to run his 
dog-walking business from his house.
The commission ruled 5-1 in favor of the appeal 
with Commissioner Thomas Hawkins voting against and Commissioner Randy Wells absent.
The commission decided that, since Baber didn’t 
have a permit to run his business from his house when he started in 1987, the earlier ruling was incor -
rect. 
Baber said that he was disappointed but will con-
tinue to care for his neighbors’ dogs by taking them to Northeast Park for walks.
He said he was upset that the appellants never 
came to him with their complaints.
“They always had plenty of opportunity to work 
with me as a human being, not as a lawsuit,” he said.
The Board of Adjustments ruled on Nov. 2 that 
Baber could keep his neighbors’ dogs because his business started before an ordinance was put in place in 1995 that forbid housing animals that are not pets.
However, since Baber didn’t have a home-busi-
ness permit then, his business was technically illegal. He applied for a permit in 2006.
During the meeting, the Board of Adjustments 
presented the case as the defendant and Michael Bowe, who owns a house near Baber’s, spoke as the appellant. Bowe said he wasn’t prepared for the city to speak on his behalf.
“The city staff was supposed to stay out of this,” 
he said. “They advised us that they would not be in-volved and they turned around and were proactive Dog business put to sleep

After years of debate, the U.S. Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency has finally 
released an official cleanup plan that will 
eliminate the Cabot-Koppers Superfund site pollution that has plagued Alachua 
County for decades. 
On Wednesday , the EPA released its 
Record of Decision, a 703-page document 
explaining the remedial treatment options 
selected for use on the area.The agency based its decisions partly 
on the suggestions of the Local Intergov-ernmental Team, which included mem-
bers of the Alachua County Health De-
partment, Alachua County Environmental 
Protection Department, Gainesville City Manager’s 
Office and Gainesville Re-
gional Utilities.
The document includes plans to re-
move and replace contaminated sediment 
along Springstead and Hogtown creeks and to install a vertical, 65-foot-deep bar -rier wall beneath an engineered cap that 
will cover the section of contaminated soil 
consolidation at the site.
Contaminated groundwater in the Up-
per Floridan Aquifer will also be treated, 
and monitoring wells will be installed to 
monitor its condition over time. 
The EPA must now finalize a consent 
decree with the responsible party, Beazer 
East, and get it court-approved before 
cleanup can begin, said Scott Miller, a rep-
resentative for EPA region four.
The process should take between six 
months and a year to complete, with an-EPA releases Koppers cleanup planBorovsky

Growing up, Bobby Kelley didn’t come 
from money. When back-to-school shopping 
season came, he was forced to choose five 
outfits and keep them nice all year.
But Kelley couldn’t help himself; he had to 
have something unique.
“I’m tired of this,” he would say as he 
“tailored” his outfits into new designs. “This needs to change.”
With a pair of scissors and a short sew-
ing lesson from his grandma, a designer was 
born.
Now, the 28-year-old Gainesville-based 
designer is readying himself for his five-year 
anniversary as a force of runway fashion. He will celebrate during this year’s Gainesville 
Fashion Week, another of “Bobby K’s” cre-
ations. 
He started GFW with some friends as a 
way to bring local artists together and have 
a little fun.
“It’s really all about community; that’s 
the number one thing,” he said. “It’s become 
such a behemoth.”
This year, Kelley will debut a line called 
Robot 2.0, a collection of men’s and women’s fashions merging metallic spandex with hints of bondage. Local music and art, he said, helped influence the concept.Just a few weeks before, during Jackson-
ville Fashion Week, Kelley will show another set of fashions inspired by 1950s working women and gentlemen’s club wear. 
Creating two different collections for two 
shows in one month is a lot of work. He’s put-ting the lines together by himself, constantly hunched over his sewing machine.
But he knows the outcome is more than 
worth it.
“I don’t like to do the same thing over and 
over,” he said. “As an artist, the best thing to do is keep reinventing yourself by doing new things and exploring new options.”
Kelley has been designing fashions as a 
hobby for 12 years, but even as a child he had an obsession with clothes. He used to take his father’s tube socks and turn them into “or -
nate, crew sock ballgowns” for his miniature 
Barbie doll models.
In high school, he took a portfolio art class 
with a friend and started designing for life-
size humans. 
Now, he’s on the verge of a deal to mass-
produce his clothes. He is looking forward to his line being sold in boutiques across Florida and, soon, across the United States, always at affordable prices.
“I hate the notion of a designer dress cost-
ing thousands of dollars,” he said. “That blows my mind. I want to keep everything in a good price range so people can buy it.”Because Bobby K. knows it’s the people 
who make the fashion, and fashion is for the people.
“I just hope that they realize they’re wear -ing something unique,” he said of his buyers. “I put a lot of thought into everything when I make it. I want someone to be like, I’m wear -
ing something that is special to someone.”

When Vanessa Downer’s boy-
friend came home with another 
woman, she went for her pocket-knife.
Downer, 51, was waiting for her boyfriend, Herbert Davis 
Jr., at his home around 1 p.m. 
Wednesday and started yelling at him and Lavonne Smoke, the woman Davis brought home, as 
soon as they arrived.
According to a Gainesville 
Police report, Davis had to push Downer out of the doorway to get inside his home, and she followed 
him. She then pulled 
out a pocket knife from her purse and 
pushed him down 
the hallway, the report stated.
Downer pushed him into his bathroom and started slashing 
the knife around. Before Davis 
could push her off, she cut his 
cheek.
Meanwhile, Smoke called 
GPD, who, upon arriving, re-
strained an angry Downer.
After hearing her rights, 
Downer said she’d argued with 
the pair, but denied ever getting physical. However, she was ar -
rested on a felony charge of ag-
gravated battery because of Da-
vis’ injury, the report stated. 
Downer was also charged 
with possession of less than 20 
grams of marijuana and drug 
paraphernalia after police found marijuana in a folded napkin and a rolled blunt.Boyfriend stabbed after bringing home another woman

  Mike Antheil has three goals 
in mind when he comes to 
Gainesville: solar panels on every rooftop, biomass energy from ev-ery farm and renewable energy on 
every property.
  Antheil, executive director of 
the Florida Alliance for Renew-
able Energy, plans to make that happen with the Florida Renew-able Energy Tour, a 10-stop trek across the state from Feb. 10 to Feb. 26.
  The tour is set to stop in 
Gainesville Feb. 25.
  With the tour scheduled just be-
fore the upcoming legislative ses-sion on March 8, he said he hopes to change minds and policy.
  On the itinerary are three 
stops at solar electricity provid-ers around the city, followed by a workshop at Santa Fe College and a town-hall-style meeting at the Pugh Hall Ocora.   The speciﬁ  c solar electricity 
providers have not been named yet, said Don Ryan, tour coordi-nator.
  But Gainesville renewable en-
ergy may not be too hard to sway, said Don Davis, a board member for the Florida Alliance for Re-newable Energy.
  “Gainesville is absolutely the 
best place in the state of Florida for solar energy,” Davis said, men-tioning the fact that Gainesville is the ﬁ  rst city in the U.S. to adopt the Feed-In Tariff program, in which GRU purchases solar ener-gy from residents who have solar panels at twice the cost of what it sells the energy.
  Ryan said he hopes to inspire 
policies like Gainesville’s in other cities along the tour, including Mi-ami, Tampa and Orlando.
  “We hope what people take 
away is a clear message that Flor-ida needs renewable energy poli-cy,” Ryan said.
  The tour is free to the public.

  Bowe said he doesn’t disagree with neigh-
bors’ assertions that Baber is a nice guy.
  “We’re not here for personalities,” he said. 
“This is about principles, not personalities.”
  He said the Board of Adjustment’s ruling 
set a bad precedent that could come back to 
haunt the commission.
  Commissioner Warren Nielsen agreed.
  “Our charge is really to be consistent,” he 
said.
  The Bowes left the meeting before they 
could be reached for further comment.
  The commission voted unanimously to re-
fer to a committee to look into changing land development codes to allow dogs that aren’t 
pets on residential property.
  Baber’s lawyer, Sondra Randon, said that 
they will pursue changing the codes, but that wasn’t the path they were looking to take.
  “We’ll go back to the drawing board,” she 
said.
  Baber said he knows most of his neighbors 
very well, but he barely knows the Bowes. Baber said he’s resolved com-plaints they’ve told him 
about, such as an ugly fence, but they haven’t tried to work with him.
  “They only have an interest in destroying 
a human being who’s doing a lot of good in the community,” he said. COMMISSION , from page 1

  The document is the EPA’s ﬁ  nal 
cleanup plan, and the county doesn’t 
have legal options to combat it if it 
doesn’t meet all its recommendations, 
said Chris Bird, director of the county environmental protection department.
  Bird hopes the EPA will begin the 
cleanup process as quickly as possible and that the agency will focus on ﬁ  rst improving polluted residential prop-erties.
  The work on private homes should 
be easier and faster than work on the 
actual site, which will require more ex-pensive and technical cleanup meth-
ods, he said.
  The county’s environmental pro-
tection department and other agencies 
will evaluate the plan to see which 
recommendations were accepted and which were overlooked. Cleanup should begin in a year

Las Vegas magicians Penn 
and Teller have been making 
people laugh, cringe and gasp 
by sawing people in half, crack-
ing jokes and exposing fraud for 30 years. 
On Wednesday, the comedic 
tricksters will perform at the 
Phillips Center for the Perform-
ing Arts at 7:30 p.m.
The show will be free and 
open to the public.
Penn and Teller were chosen 
to perform because they com-bine entertainment and promi-nence, said Corey Portnoy, Ac-cent’s chief of staff. 
Penn and Teller have writ-ten three best-selling books, re-ceived 11 Emmy nominations for their television series “Penn & Teller: Bullshit!” and recently celebrated the fifth year of their 
Las Vegas show at the Rio All-
Suite Hotel & Casino, according 
to the Penn and Teller website. 
In Gainesville, 
their performance 
will consist of 
question-and-

as well as demonstrations of il-lusions and tricks, said Glenn 
Alai, executive director of the 
show.

Finding a new planet isn’t the kind of thing that’s 
traditionally on a scientist’s daily itinerary. In the 
realm of science, it’s like winning a Super Bowl, 
meeting the pope and finding an extra $10 in your 
jeans all wrapped into one. 
Eric Ford and his team found six.Ford, an associate professor of astronomy at UF, 
along with Althea Moorhead, a postdoctoral associ-ate, and graduate student Robert Morehead, is part of the UF research team associated with a NASA mission that recently confirmed finding six planets orbiting the star Kepler-11. 
“It was more like four eureka moments,” Ford 
said. “It was three planets, then four planets, then five planets, then finally six.”
Using a method called transit-timing, they were 
able to measure irregularities in light given off by the star, proving plants were orbiting around it.
Scientists and astronomers use the data collected 
from the Kepler spacecraft to interpret and find ir -
regularities in light given off by the stars using its 
photometer, or light meter, to measure the bright-
ness of stars. 
Of the six planets, five are larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune, and one is about the size of Jupiter. The planets are located 2,000 light-years away from Earth.
That distance makes it more extraordinary, he 
explained, because it’s one of the farthest systems to have a potential for water on the surface.
Five of the planets have orbits around the star 
that could fit inside Mercury’s orbit. The shortest orbit was 10.3 days, he said. This also made the dis-
covery faster to confirm, with only a little more than 
a year of data collected.
“We’re really looking forward 
to the next few years,” he said.
Ford has been involved since 
2007 when he was chosen along with nine other scientists to work with the project. Though the proj-ect had been in the works since 
the 1980s, the Kepler spacecraft 
left Earth in March 2009. 
Since then, the Kepler space-
craft has identified 1,235 potential planets, 15 of which have been confirmed, according to Ford.
The mission costs $600 million, including the 
spacecraft, and about $360,000 is given to UF, Ford said. The mission is supposed to last a little more than three years.
But Ford said there is enough space between the 
fifth planet and the outer-lying sixth planet for more planets to fit.
“We still might find another one,” he said.Team discovers new planets

Today’s question: Do you agree with the City Commission’s decision on dogwalking?
123 TOTAL VOTES81% YES19% NOThursday’s question: Should you be able to buy liquor at any hour?
Bill of Rights doesn’t know party lines
Conservative thinkers could see this coming before 
President Obama was even elected.
Obama’s perspective on the Constitution made 
it easy to forecast events such as what happened Mon-
day, when Judge Roger Vinson, a federal district judge 
in Pensacola, ruled that the federal health care reform bill (“Obamacare”) unconstitutional.
In a campaign speech, Obama criticized the Bill of 
Rights for being “negative rights.” That is, it states only what the federal government cannot do. Obama’s concern 
was that we should be governed by a bill of rights which 
includes what the government can do to its citizens.
The most obnoxious part of the Bill of Rights to the 
liberal agenda is the 10th Amendment, which says, “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitu-tion, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”
That is, the federal government has no authority other 
than that which explicitly falls within the boundaries set 
by the Constitution.
And Obamacare violates those boundaries.
The provision within the legislation that resulted in 
the judicial ruling was that of mandated coverage. If the bill were to go into effect, millions of currently uninsured Americans would be forced to purchase a health insurance 
plan or else pay a fine to the federal government.
And nowhere in the Constitution is the federal govern-
ment given the authority to force the citizens to buy any-thing.
This is a point liberals need to consider carefully.
The Constitution and Bill of Rights were written and 
adopted as so-called “negative rights” for good reason. 
The founders of this country were well aware that, in the 
ebb and flow of partisanship and public sentiment, those 
within the government may from time to time be tempted 
to make sweeping changes in response to a given situation or issue.
The negative rights were de-
signed to prevent that, regardless of party. The safeguards on govern-
ment intervention are necessary to 
keep politicians on both sides of the aisle from foisting unjust mandates 
on American citizens.
If a politically motivated Supreme 
Court decision overturns Judge Vin-
son, or if President Obama unlawfully forges ahead with 
his plan, then a precedent will be set. Powers given to the government will remain with the government, in this ad-
ministration and all which follow.
Thus, the president and Congress will have the power 
to force Americans to buy something whether they want 
it or not.
Think about that. If, for example, Sarah Palin were to be elected and de-
cide that everyone needed to own a firearm, this precedent would enable her to push through legislation that would require all Americans to purchase a gun whether they 
wanted to or not.
Liberals often fail to consider unintended consequenc-
es. They should carefully consider the results of their ten-dency to respond to every issue by giving as much power 
as possible to a government that will not always be on their side ideologically.
The Constitution, with its negative rights, ensures that 
no matter who is in power, the rights of the American citi-zen remain unchanged.
Conservatives and liberals alike should be grateful for 
judges like Vinson who courageously defend those rights, regardless of the political climate.

means his crew is out of work and his fans out of episodes to watch.
They could always switch to the news. For a week, the story that’s dominated most national

we’re firing a messing-with-the-media-is-a-surefire-way-to-piss-off-protesters-even-more DART at the Egyptian 
authorities.
They sure aren’t winning any Nobel Peace Prizes. But 
WikiLeaks might.
A Norwegian lawmaker nominated the website for the 
award because it has exposed war crimes and corruption. He says anyone keeping governments accountable in this 
way deserves a prize. 
For recognizing the role the Internet can play in mak-
ing the world more peaceful, we’re giving a maybe-we-
shouldn’t-shoot-the-messenger-after-all LAUREL to 
Snorre Valen. The site probably won’t win, but it’s a step 
in the right direction.
Embracing technology can be a good idea, especially 
when it can help the environment a little. That’s why we 
roll our eyes every time a new Yellow Pages shows up on 
our doorstep and why we were happy to hear 1.5 million 
of the obsolete books may stop making their all-too-quick trips into trash cans. 
For considering making telephone books an opt-in 
publication, we’re sending a LAUREL to San Francisco’s 
Board of Supervisors President David Chiu.
While his proposed legislation may raise the issue of 
constitutionality, it won’t come to rival the debate over health care reform. We’ve come to accept that we have to 
give the rarest award, a here-we-go-again LART, to Judge 
Roger Vinson, who deemed the law’s individual mandate 
unconstitutional. 
We wanted to give him a laurel for his careful legal con-
sideration of the situation with an eye on our rights, but 
we couldn’t help but consider a dart for reminding us how 
difficult it will be to fix a broken system with warring par -
ties in office. 
It’s giving us  headaches thinking about it.For lightening our mood, we’re giving a silhouetted 
LAUREL to Punxsutawney Phil’s shadow. 
Thanks for taking Wednesday off.
Until next time, remember that spring is around the 
corner, Gators. A little groundhog told us so.

Letters to the Editor
Second Amendment is here to stay
In response to Wednesday’s letter, “Sec-
ond Amendment needs another look,” I feel 
like re-examining the Second Amendment 
is old hat. Grundy stated the age-old anti-gun activists argument of the “conditional clause.” Sir, the Second Amendment has 
had another look. In fact, the Supreme Court 
has directly ruled “no” on it fewer than five 
times, plus four indirect rulings. Each word has been broken down and clearly defined. I’m happy to say that the Supreme Court has 
not taken the same view as you. I think the issue was settled a long time ago.

Federal funding should be steered away 
from Planned Parenthood
In response to Wednesday’s “Two to Tan-
go,” I wanted to address your levity in what 
should be a grave issue: Abortion and prosti-
tution should never be joking matters. First, 
your semantics are deceptive because after watching Live Action’s 11-minute “conversa-tion, ” it is clear Live Action’s intent is not as “anti-abortion” as it is “pro-life” and pro-law (unlike Planned Parenthood’s foul employee who dropped the f-bomb at least six times). The behavior of this worker is morally rep-rehensible by both our federal government and the state of New Jersey. Certainly, the ex-employee in the video “went against company 
policy,” but if you dig a little deeper into Live 
Action’s work throughout the past three years, you realize that this is not an isolated incident in the company, which the video pointed out received more than $300 million per year in federal funding. It seems that if an organiza-tion is unable to monitor employees who are consistently breaking federal and state statutes, perhaps tax dollars should be steered away from supporting potential company hazards. It seems Planned Parenthood has gotten itself in a tight spot, and Lila Rose’s incredible ini-tiative to utilize social media is finally forcing them to reconsider their inability to smooth 
out what is rightfully the most controversial 
issue on our nation’s conscience.

When marginalized people lament the lack of diver -
sity on the big screen, a common, though patron-
izing, retort is they need not seek validation from 
the entertainment industry. Hollywood is as quintessentially 
American as football. It is a staple of our culture and if peo-ple of color are not represented, they might as well not exist. 
Although some might have been hopeful after the Academy 
Awards last year when Mo’Nique took home the Oscar for 
Best Supporting Actress for her role in “Precious” and Kath-ryn Bigelow became the first woman to win Best Director for the “The Hurt Locker,” others were rightfully trepidatious. 
While it was exciting to see Mo’Nique recognized, one must 
wonder why it took such a dark role for her to earn the ac-
colade.The problem with the Hollywood machine is that it continues to typecast people of color. This is evident in the mid-season replacement “Harry’s Law” by the wildly popu-
lar David E. Kelley. While the show has endearing qualities 
and witty writing, the supporting characters of color deify 
negative stereotypes of drug addiction, poverty and help-lessness. Kelley is one of the best writers and producers in television. But even if he, at times, misses the sociocultural mark, the implications for lesser storytellers are harrowing. I wonder if the gag about “a black man falling from the roof” would have made the script had there been more voices of color at the table.In an interview with “Complex” 
magazine, Michael B. Jordan (“The 
Wire,” “Friday Night Lights”), by far 
the most promising star of my genera-
tion, reflected on the challenges of being a young black actor in a white- dominated industry. “There are still a lot of white 
writers writing for black people, and there’s always going to 
be a lot of stuff lost in translation,” he said. The 23-year-old 
acknowledged he felt a responsibility to speak out against mischaracterizations especially in a business that relegates black talent to a “crab-in-a-barrel mentality.” In response 
to the criticism The Academy will receive throughout this 
award season for what many are deeming “the whitest Os-
cars in a decade,” we will hear the old excuse that there was merely not enough talent of color to chose from. Filmmaker Ava DuVernay, who was cited in several recent articles about 
the lack of diversity, recently formed the African-American 
Film Festival Releasing Movement, a campaign to widen the 
distribution of black films. Her efforts and her mission are compulsory in a field that treats people of color as if they are invisible. However, one must wonder how long African Americans will have to rely on their own mediums. In a so-ciety where all races coexist, black people should not be lim-ited to black media.
Alicia Niwagaba ’11 argues that people of color don’t generally receive roles that would garner them critical 
praise. She cites her frustration with films like “The Social 
Network” (nominated for eight Academy Awards) that cast 
a white actor to play an Indian man. “I have a hard time believing there was not one Indian actor who fit that role. It was a small part but it just exemplifies what is wrong with 
casting and the film industry.” Ultimately, Niwagaba main-
tains it is a numbers game. “Studios don’t think audiences 
want to see films with minorities or strong women, so films about white people (especially men) are disproportionately funded and supported.”
The few times that people of color were celebrated were 
what DuVernay described as anomalies.“People of color do not receive awards unless we are degrading ourselves and playing downtrodden characters,” Niwagaba said. “We are always represented as the other, something to be pitied, nev-
er triumphant and never strong. It just shows you what kind 
of narrative Hollywood wants to maintain.”
The diversity that we represent in America will be the 
diversity illustrated around the world. If The Academy con-
tinues to ostracize certain voices, they will make themselves an irrelevant program. We don’t have to look any further than the Miss America pageant to see that viewers can easily outgrow award ceremonies if they lose touch with reality.

UF ROUNDUP
By MELISSA PENDER
Alligator Writer
 
Florida became the second school 
since 2008 to win all four weekly 
Southeastern Conference awards af-
ter a stellar meet against Tennessee 
on Saturday and a sweep of Indian River State College on Sunday.
Senior Conor Dwyer took SEC 
Male Swimmer of the Week for a record fifth time this season, and freshman Elizabeth Beisel earned SEC Female Swimmer of the Week for a record fourth. The SEC Male 
and Female Freshman of the Week 
honors went to Marcin Cieslak and Hilda Luthersdottir.“It’s always good having quality 
athletes, and [the award] was well deserved in all four parts,” UF coach Gregg Troy said.
Troy said the meet against Ten-
nessee, UF’s most lopsided dual 
victory over the V olunteers in history , showed 
how talented the 
Gators are.
Dwyer was 
also named the Counsilman-
Hunsaker National Collegiate Male Swimmer of the Week for Jan. 25-31 by CollegeSwimming.com. He broke this season’s NCAA record in 
the 400-yard individual medley with 
a time of 3:44.73 against Tennessee.
TRACK TEAMS HEADING TO ELITE 
MEET: The women’s track and field team is not ranked like the No. 1 men, but it is motivated to change that.
The women had one winner 
— freshman Ebony Eutsey in the 400-meter dash — and 10 top-five finishes at the Texas A&M Chal-lenge despite sending a team of mostly freshmen and sophomores.
Track and Field News ranked the 
Florida women’s recruiting class as the country’s No. 7 group last year and the second-best unit in the SEC.
“Hopefully , we’ll be right beside 
(the men) this year, if not above them,” freshman Brittany Harrell said. “We’ll do really well because we came in ranked high, and we have high expectations as a result.”
Except for a women’s distance 
medley relay heading to New York, UF will compete in the two-day Vir -
ginia Tech Elite meet this weekend.
The women previously placed 
first (2009) and second (2010) at the SEC Outdoor Tournament.
“The big thing with our freshmen 
is that we do a good job of reloading so we don’t have to rebuild,” Gators coach Mike Holloway said. “They’re here, we recruited them here, and we expect big things out of them.
Harrell competed in her first-
ever collegiate meet last week, and Eutsey tried her hand at running in-
doors for the first time. Harrell and 
Eutsey both say that as they mature, they will begin to perform at an even higher level.
“Practicing with people that are 
very competitive like myself has been a learning experience,” Eutsey said. “Actually being able to practice with somebody who is running right 
beside me or in front of me pushing 
me to get better has been a big tran-sition for me.”

n THE GATORS WILL HOST A BATTLE OF 
UNDEFEATED TEAMS TONIGHT.
By ALLISON BANKO
Alligator Writer
 
Both squads will roll into the O’Connell Center with un-
shaken records. 
Each team is fresh off season-high totals and has gymnasts 
ranking among the nation’s top all-around competitors.
Despite all their accomplishments, and their undefeated re-
cords, either No. 1 Florida or No. 6 Alabama will have to take a 
hit as the two square off in the O’Connell Center tonight at 7.
Florida will feature its familiar all-arounders, sophomore 
Ashanée Dickerson (No. 4 in the nation) and freshman Alaina Johnson (No. 5). They will face Crimson Tide junior Geralen Stack-Eaton, the No. 2 all-arounder in the nation, and senior Kayla Hoffman (No. 8), who was named the Southeastern Con-ference Gymnast of the Week. In addition to Johnson and Dickerson, the Gators will unveil 
a new, first-time all-arounder.  
Freshman Mackenzie Caquatto has racked up more events 
by the week, and she will collect her fourth against Alabama with the addition of vault.
“This is my first time doing all-around, so I’m not expecting 
too much of myself,” Caquatto said. “I’m just going to go out 
there and try to hit my routines to the best of my ability, the best that I can do. I just 
want to do like I do in practice and then 
work up from there.”
Caquatto set herself up for success, as 
her performances earned her second place in bars, beam and floor last week.
Caquatto said she is not going to enter this meet any differ -
ently than the others, even though the team knows the Tide will throw down more competition than the Gators have faced. 
“We just have to stay in our bubble,” Caquatto said. “[Coach] 
Rhonda [Faehn] always tells us, ‘Stay in our bubble. Stay with the team. Focus on what you and the team are doing.’”Dickerson remembered it was just that team mentality that 
pulled the squad ahead of Alabama when they faced off at the 2010 SEC Championships. 
At the start of the competition, Alabama looked to be the 
favorite as it shined on vault and the Gators had what Faehn described as their “worst vaulting performance of the year.”  
“They had a strong start on vault, and I guess they didn’t 
keep it going,” Dickerson said. “We didn’t have a strong start on vault, but we stayed together as a team. You can’t start re-ally, really high and then just going down because you use all your energy up on one event. You have to stay consistent on all four events to come out with a win.” 
That’s what the Gators did, pulling out the victory for the 
title. Faehn said the team needs to focus just as well when en-tering competition throughout the season.
“That’s really what we’re working on for this year,” she 
said. “Our mental strength, our mental toughness and focus-ing on the fact that there are going to be a few mistakes here and there, but it’s how you respond to them that shows your true success.”Caquatto to debut as all-arounder against Alabama

UF guard Kenny Boynton will square off with former high school rival and AAU 
teammate Brandon Knight, a Kentucky freshman, on Saturday night.
n THE TWO WERE AAU TEAMMATES.
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Staff Writer
gluca@alligator.org
 
Kenny Boynton will once again be face-to-
face with an old friend and bitter rival Satur -
day. 
After two years of amateur national cham-
pionships and high school grudge matches, 
Boynton and Brandon Knight went their sepa-
rate ways.  
But the duo will share a court when Florida 
(17-5, 6-2 Southeastern Conference) plays host 
to Knight and No. 10 Kentucky (16-5 4-3 SEC) at 9 p.m. with bragging rights and conference supremacy on the line.
“We try to make each other better,” Boyn-
ton said. “We compete on the court, and then when it’s over, it’s over. Pretty much our focus coming into the game is to win and try to not think about the matchup.”
Although Boynton is trying to keep his per -
sonal history with Knight on the backburner, the reunion has been a popular topic leading up to the game. 
When the two played together on Team 
Breakdown, they took home back-to-back 17U AAU National Championships. 
Once the summer season ended, the duo 
returned to the high school hardwood, with Boynton at Plantation American Heritage and Knight at Fort Lauderdale Pine Crest. 
The two teams faced off seven times in a 
two-year span, with Knight’s squad coming 
out on top on four occasions. 
The most notable of those was the last, a 61-
59 win for Pine Crest in the Class 3A regional 
semifinals. Knight scored 26 points, and Boyn-ton notched 20 but missed a game-tying free 
throw in the closing moments. 
While their relationship has grown stale as 
the gap between the two has widened, Boyn-ton and Knight are still friends who once spoke 
on an almost daily basis.  
That close connection made a number of 
waves a season ago, when Boynton was out-spoken in his desire to bring UF the class of 
2010’s No. 6 overall player, according to Rivals.

Despite losing its star player in the 
second half, Ole Miss still found a way 
to beat Florida on Thursday night in the 
O’Connell Center.
The Rebels were able to overcome 
the absence of senior guard Kayla Mel-son, who left the game after colliding 
with a teammate and suffering concus-
sion-like symptoms, as well as a furi-ous, late charge by the Gators to hold on for the 61-59 victory . 
Even with some late-game theatrics, 
Florida (14-10, 4-6 Southeastern Confer -
ence) didn’t lose this matchup in crunch 
time — it was lost on the boards. Ole 
Miss (10-11, 3-6 SEC) dominated the 
glass with 16 offensive rebounds and 
multiple second-chance opportunities. 
“I thought that was the deciding fac-
tor in the game,” coach Amanda Butler said. “Their offensive rebounding sus-
tained them. … Those guys just crushed us. They crushed our post players on 
the inside.”
The Gators never 
held a lead in the game, but they put themselves in posi-tion for a come-from-
behind victory in the 
closing minutes. 
Florida was down by 12 points with 
just over six minutes to play, but it put together a 16-4 run to tie the game at 56 
with 1:03 left on the clock. 
As she had done all evening, Ole Miss 
guard Valencia McFarland stepped up and delivered, driving to the basket and 
dishing to a wide-open Pa’Sonna Hope 
for the go-ahead score. 
Ole Miss defended well on the other 
end, and freshman guard Jaterra Bonds was forced to put up a three-point at-
tempt with 12 seconds left. It didn’t fall, and the Rebels clinched just their sec-ond win in eight games. 
Taking over at the point for Melson, 
McFarland finished with a game-high 20 points and six assists. 
“I’m real sad she’s a freshman and 
we’re going to have to play against her 
for three more years,” Butler said of the 
Rebels guard.

rookie cop, was leaving his precinct house 
at 8 a.m. when he spotted Joe Namath. 
After what was obviously a rough 
night, “Broadway Joe” was exiting the side entrance of the Grand Summit Hotel. 
Namath’s famed right arm was draped 
around the shoulder of a charming young creature in go-go boots. The Dublin-born Timoney recognized a hangover when he saw one.   
Jackpot: Timoney had coveted inside 
information. In just five hours, the Jets would play Oakland for the AFC Champi-onship at Shea Stadium. Timoney scram-
bled to a pay phone. 
He pressed his brother to “send it in” 
on Oakland.
In the most physical game Namath ever 
played, he led the Jets past the Raiders and into the Super Bowl 27-23.
The rookie cop blew his rent money.Another friend, Red, is a bookmaker. 
These days, computers take all the ac-
tion. Many of Red’s Wall Street customers 
subscribe to high-priced betting services. 
Before games, Red checks his computer to see what teams he needs and for how 
much.
Because he sees his customer’s bets, Red 
has free access to all his players’ sports handicapping services for free. Not one ex-pensive betting service, but four, yet even 
he can’t make money gambling.
That’s the bottom line: inside informa-
tion, both sides of the law, both losers.  
Here’s a gambler’s perspective of the 
game.  
Toughness of schedule, injuries and ev-
erything else a handicapper thinks about 
have already been figured into the line. 
Early prognosticators had this game 
as a pick-em, but that didn’t happen. The 
Packers settled into championship week-end as minus $140 to $100 favorites.
After Pittsburgh beat the Jets, the line 
Sunday night opened Packers minus-2, or 
minus-2.5. 
Bookies love this line. 
Because scores don’t usually fall on 
these numbers, bookies can seesaw back and forth between 2 and 2.5 to balance money.  
On gameday, dumpsters full of money 
couldn’t get Vegas to move off a line the number usually falls on such as: 3, 4, 7, 8, 
10 or 11.   
Corporations concocted a way to pump 
more money into the system. If you bet the 
game, or the total, you can “purchase” half 
a point.
So, let’s say you like the underdog, and 
the line is 5.5. Instead of betting $110 to win $100, Vegas “allows” you to wager 
$120 to win $100. This makes your bet 
more attractive at plus-6 but costs you 
“double juice.”
Here’s where corporations really get 
cute. 
This year’s Super Bowl line is 2.5. No 
one who likes the Packers will risk double 
juice to buy a half-point and lay a 2 instead 
of a 2.5. But if a bettor likes Pittsburgh, the 
plot thickens.
Underdog bettors crave that plus-3. 
That’s a number that could save their asses. 
But CEOs who run casinos know this, so 
they charge triple juice. That’s right, $130 
to win $100 if you want Pittsburgh plus-
3. I also see a plus-3 at minus $125. They 
might as well put a gun to your head. 
As of yet, the only money bet on Sun-
day’s game has been “smart” money. The general public won’t pour cash into this contest until gameday. Regardless of how 
much money comes in on the Pack, I can’t 
see this line going to 3.5. 
It’s bookmaking 101. Don’t get “mid-
dled.”  
Middled means that if Vegas open Pack-
ers minus-2.5, I bet Green Bay early and lay 2.5. Later, I wait until the line goes up, 
and I bet Pittsburgh plus-3.5. If the game 
falls 3, I win both ways. I’ve middled the 
spread.Bookies get killed. I recall that hap-
pening twice: Dallas-Pittsburgh, 1976 (the 
game fell 4) and Green Bay-New England, 
1997 (the game fell 14). 
When this happens, bookies scramble 
to find a ledge. They literally have to wait in line to jump. The only thing bookies fear 
worse than getting middled on the Super Bowl is if the “number” 317 falls on Pad-
dy’s Day. 
They wake up screaming over that. For 
the sheltered and uninformed among you, 
I’ll save “numbers” for another time, but remember this:       
If people behind betting services could 
predict winners, they wouldn’t sell infor -
mation or write columns. They’d do as you or I would. They’d sit in bed all day with cell phones and high-priced company sip-
ping champagne.     
When Wilson manufactures square 
footballs, when rubber no longer bounces, then “experts” will pick winners. Until 
then, embed your cash in your hands, and 
keep those hands in your pockets.

UF TENNIS
By THOMAS NASSIFF
Alligator Writer
 
When the No. 7 Florida men’s 
tennis team takes on two of its in-
state rivals this weekend, it will be 
led by the reigning Southeastern Conference Player of the Week.
Alexandre Lacroix received the 
honor Wednesday after an impres-
sive performance in the ITA Kick-
Off Weekend tournament. Lacroix is 4-0 in singles and doubles this year.He will carry the Gators in to-
day’s match against UCF, which will be the team’s last February ap-pearance in Linder Stadium at Ring Tennis Complex.
After facing UCF, the Gators (4-
0) will hit the road for the first time this spring to match up with rival Florida State, ranked No. 27 in the nation.
“Central Florida always plays us 
tough,” coach Andy Jackson said, “and this is Florida State’s best team in four or five years.”The Seminoles’ only two losses 
were to No. 2 Southern California and No. 6 UCLA, and Jackson said 
it’s an advantage 
for FSU to have 
played teams of 
that quality.
“You can 
throw out all the rankings and 
record books 
when it comes to 
Florida-Florida State,” Jackson said. “We’re prepared to take their best shot.”
UF READIES FOR BAYLOR: Third-
ranked Baylor will attempt to halt the No. 2 UF women’s tennis team’s 
94-game regular-season home win 
streak on Saturday at 1 p.m. 
The Bears are a different animal 
than any team the Gators have faced this spring, coach Roland Thorn-
qvist said. 
“We’ve played some teams early 
on who didn’t really think they had 
a shot at beating us,” he said. “Bay-lor is going to come here thinking 
they can win, and they certainly 
have a powerful lineup.”
Baylor will feature three ranked 
singles players to face Florida’s for -
midable top three of Allie Will, Lau-ren Embree and Sofie Oyen.
“We have a young team, so we 
have to be ready, and it’s going to be interesting to see how we respond,” 
Thornqvist said.

game, Butler said, and didn’t score its 
first points until close to three minutes in. But the coach scoffed at the notion 
her team lacked motivation.
“I don’t know why there would be a 
reason that we wouldn’t be up for this 
game — that’s just incomprehensible to me,” she said.
The Gators shot poorly all evening 
and finished 22 of 58 from the field. Ju-nior guard Jordan Jones (eight points, 2-of-8 three-point shooting) said the Rebels’ zone defense allowed open looks, but she admitted Florida also forced some shots.
“It’s never in our game plan just to 
jack up a bunch of threes,” Jones said of Florida’s 22 attempts from the outside. “I 
took a lot and wish I had some of them 
back.”
While there were opportunities to 
pull out an improbable win late in the 
game, Jones said the team didn’t do 
enough to secure a victory.
“We showed good fight at the end,” 
Jones said. “But to not have it there for 40 minutes against an SEC team … there’s no excuse for that.”Zone D, forced shots hurt Gators

interest in recruiting Knight, calling him a ter -
rific player with a great work ethic. However, 
Donovan admits he did not think Knight was 
truly considering Florida after his official visit 
early in UF’s season. 
Donovan’s suspicions turned out to be ac-
curate, as Knight eventually committed to the 
Wildcats on April 14. 
“I tried to get him to come here,” Boyn-
ton said. “He liked it, but Kentucky, he felt that was a better situation, so he chose to go there.” 
Knight has put together a stellar freshman 
season to this point, averaging 17.2 points, 4.1 rebounds and 3.8 assists per game. 
“He’s always been a smart player,” Boyn-
ton said. “When he’s on the court, he makes the right plays. When he’s open, he takes the shot or tries to get to the rim, and when he sees the open man, he’s a great passer.”
Boynton has played down the matchup 
from an individual perspective, but he and 
the rest of the team know any game against Kentucky 
is a big one, especially a 
nationally televised game

tween Boynton and Knight 
only add to the frenzy.

is excited,” senior forward Chandler Parsons 
said. “Him growing up with him, playing together on Team Breakdown, I’m sure he’s 
got some real excitement going through his 
mind and I’m sure he’s going to come ready to play.”HOOPS , from page 14
