UF administrators have de-
manded the Alligator remove 
19 of its orange newspaper racks from some of the most visible parts of campus.
On July 3 the Alligator re-
ceived an email from Amy Hass, UF associate vice presi-dent, stating the racks must be removed by Aug. 15.
During Fall 2009, adminis-trators proposed to UF’s Board of Trustees a rule that would prohibit distribution of all pub-lications on campus unless ap-proved by the UF vice president for business affairs, according to information provided by Al-ligator attorney Thomas Julin.
UF didn’t contact the Alliga-
tor about the change, and the Board approved it Dec. 11, 2009. The change was published but not sent to the Alligator.
Around the same time, a 
plan was drafted to remove pri-vately owned news racks and to replace them with modu-UF administrators 
demand removal of 19 Alligator newspaper racks

A task force made up of ofﬁ  cers 
from the Alachua County Sheriff’s 
Ofﬁ  ce, Gainesville Police Depart-ment and U.S. Marshals arrested a man Tuesday morning connected to a 2008 Haile Plantation rape case.
Alachua County Sheriff Sadie 
Darnell announced in a press con-ference Tuesday afternoon a DNA report released last week led in-vestigators to the arrest of Andrew Payne Jr., 38, in Willacoochee, Ga.
“Hopefully he will not see the 
light of day, except when he is in handcuffs and in shackles, or be-hind prison walls,” Darnell told reporters and ofﬁ  cials. “That’s 
our goal at this 
point.”
A c c o r d i n g 
to an ASO news release, on May 21, 2008, at about 6:30 a.m., a 36-year-old woman, whose name was 
withheld because she was a vic-tim of a sexual crime, was jogging along a trail near the intersection of Southwest 94th Street and South-west 46th Boulevard when Payne, armed with a handgun, attacked and sexually assaulted the woman, leaving her with serious injuries.  
Payne escaped from the scene 
in a small four-door sedan before anyone knew what happened, said ASO spokesman Art Forgey.After four years of investiga-
tion, the ASO got a break in the case when the Florida Department of Law Enforcement’s crime lab released a report last week regard-ing DNA extracted from the crime scene.

A Gainesville woman was arrested 
Tuesday morning and accused of stabbing 
her husband and trying to ﬂ  ee from ofﬁ  cers in an electric wheelchair.
Gainesville Police ofﬁ  cers arrested Elo-
ise Sturdivant, 33, at about 10:50 a.m. on charges of aggravated domestic battery and resisting arrest without violence.
According to a GPD arrest report, police 
went to Shands at UF because Rayme Al-bert, Sturdivant’s husband, arrived Tues-day morning at the emergency room with stab wounds.
Albert, 45, told police Sturdivant stabbed 
him twice in the leg during an argument and cut his hand when he reached for the knife.When ofﬁ  cers told Sturdivant she was 
under arrest, she went “maximum throt-tle” on her electric wheelchair to ﬂ  ee, GPD spokesman Ben Tobias wrote in an email.
Police grabbed Sturdivant’s arms before 
she got too far and arrested her.
Sturdivant told police her side of the sto-
ry, saying Albert kicked her in the stomach with a pair of cowboy boots.
She also said she armed herself with a steak knife and stabbed her husband in self-defense.
Police determined Sturdivant’s injuries 
were not consistent with her story.
As of Wednesday night, Sturdivant is 
being held in Alachua County Jail with a bond set at $1,500.

Southwest Rec gets new old 
locks
Southwest Recreation Cen-
ter’s lockers are undergoing 
maintenance again this week as the facility’s new mechanical locks are replaced by their old electronic counterparts.
The mechanical locks, which 
were installed last week, were defective and are being returned to their manufacturer, said Da-vid Stopka, Southwest Recre-ation Center’s Associate Direc-tor for Facility Operations.
“We’re in the process of get-
ting them replaced,” he said. “Or getting our money back on them.”

Two Seattle men stopped at 
border for illegal candy
SEATTLE — Two Seattle men 
say they spent more than two 
hours in a detention center at the Canadian border after U.S. border agents discovered illegal chocolate eggs in their car.
Brandon Loo and Christo-
pher Sweeney told KOMO-TV they decided to bring home some treats for friends and fam-ily during a recent trip to Van-couver, British Columbia. They bought Kinder Eggs — choco-late eggs with a toy inside.
The two men say border 
guards searched their car and said the eggs are illegal in the United States because young children could choke on the small plastic toys. Importing located by Tuesday afternoon.
“I’m not going after it,” Ens-
inger said. “I don’t do reptiles.”

Utah man uses obituary to con-
fess indiscretions
SALT LAKE CITY — A 
59-year-old Utah man who 
wrote his own obituary before he died last week used the op-portunity to come clean.
Friends and family of Val 
Patterson learned Sunday that the man they thought held a doctorate from the University of Utah received the degree thanks to a paperwork mistake and that he never even gradu-ated.
Patterson died from throat 
cancer on July 10. KSL-TV re-ports he wrote his own death notice in the first person last fall.
The light-hearted obituary 
published in the Salt Lake Tri-bune also includes a confession to stealing a business’ safe. He wrote: “As it turns out, I AM the guy who stole the safe from the Motor View Drive Inn back in June, 1971.”
His widow, Mary Jane, said 
the confessions are true.

Wash. crows blamed for ‘suspi-
cious powder’ scare
EDMONDS, Wash. — A fire 
spokeswoman says blame the 
crows for a “suspicious powder” scare at Washington state intersec-tion that detoured traffic for more than an hour.
Snohomish County Fire District 
1 spokeswoman Leslie Hynes tells The Daily Herald that a hazardous materials team responded Tues-day to a report about an unknown white powder in the roadway in the town of Edmonds.
A witness finally told the crew 
that a couple of crows were to blame. Hynes says a woman was going jogging when she noticed the birds dragging a bag of white flour.
Hynes says the woman took 
the bag away from the birds, put it in a garbage can and kept running. It took firefighters about an hour to clear the scene.
Says Hynes: “Two crows and a 
two-alarm hazmat incident.”
— THE ASSOCIATED PRESSthem can lead to a potentially hefty fine.
Sweeney says the bust was 
a waste of his time and the agents’ time. The men eventu-ally got off with a warning.
A U.S. Customs and Bor -
der Protection spokesman de-clined to comment about the case Tuesday night.
The agency warned on its 
website around Easter that the treats can’t be imported legally.
The agency says it seized 
more than 60,000 Kinder Eggs from travelers’ baggage and international mail shipments in fiscal 2011.

Residents warned: 6-foot lizard 
loose in Colorado
DENVER — A sheriff has 
warned residents in a tour -
ist town northwest of Colo-
rado Springs that a strong, aggressive 6-foot lizard that eats small animals — includ-ing dogs and cats — is on the loose in the area.
Teller County Sheriff Mike 
Ensinger said Tuesday that a 25-pound pet Nile monitor lizard has gone missing after breaking a mesh leash and crawling away.
Ensinger said about 400 
homes in the Woodland Park area were warned. He added that the animal, which es-caped Monday and is known as Dino, has not bitten any hu-mans — yet.
“We have a 6-foot reptile 
out and about,” Ensinger said. “If it gets hungry enough, we don’t know what it will do.”
Ensinger said his animal 
control division is searching for the animal.
Area resident Rick Stasi 
said the sheriff’s advisory was unsettling, warning “pet owners and parents are urged to use caution while pets and children are outdoors.”
Stasi said he plans to keep 
his two small dogs indoors.
Bradley Bundy, a veterinar -
ian at Dublin Animal Hospital in Colorado Springs, said the lizard could inflict a nasty bite if cornered.
“This kiddo could hurt 
someone if they don’t know how to restrain it,” Bundy said. He added that the lizards are sold in area pet stores and look cute when they’re only 8 inches long, but they can grow to reach 9 feet.
Ensinger said officers may 
use a tracking dog if Dino isn’t THURSDAY, JULY 19, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 3

Wednesday morning on the Plaza of the Americas. The new buses will run on route 46.

Two new orange and blue Re-
gional Transit Service buses will 
be driving through campus begin-ning in August.
On the Plaza of the Americas on 
Wednesday, RTS unveiled its new biodiesel hybrid buses that will start running Aug. 19.
The new buses will run on 
route 46, which goes from UF to downtown, said RTS Marketing and Communications Supervisor Chip Skinner.
The electric and biodiesel com-
bination increases fuel efﬁ  ciency by 20 to 30 percent.
The buses start on the electric 
battery and the diesel fuel kicks in at certain speeds.
Skinner didn’t know the exact speeds, but he said the system works like a hybrid car.
The buses cost $600,000 each, 
Skinner said.
Curtis Reynolds, UF’s vice pres-
ident for business affairs, said the Campus Development Agreement, which facilitates coordination be-tween UF, Alachua County and Gainesville, funded the buses.
During the unveiling, Reynolds 
said these buses strengthen the university’s partnership with RTS.
RTS will be the second agency 
to use biodiesel hybrid buses. The ﬁ  rst is the Palm Tran in Palm Beach County, Skinner said.
“It’s been a number of years in 
the works,” Skinner said.
Three more hybrid buses will 
be coming in spring.

The Gainesville City Commission will vote 
today to approve a mutual aid agreement with 
the City of Tampa to send law enforcement of-ﬁ  cers to the Republican National Convention.
If approved, the city will send two 
Gainesville Police mounted units, which con-sists of two horses and riders, to provide secu-rity for the convention in August, GPD spokes-man Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias wrote in an email.
Alachua County Sheriff Spokesman Art 
Forgey said the Alachua Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce will send its own patrol and specialty units.
The Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce 
and the Tampa Police Department Mounted Patrol Unit asked GPD earlier this year to pro-vide security.
According to the agreement, about 70 other 
police agencies across the state, including Or-lando Police Department, Florida Highway Patrol and Broward County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce, will help with crowd control.
“It is a great honor to have our talents no-
ticed by another agency, and for them to con-tact and ask us to participate,” Tobias said.
In April, the GPD’s mounted unit traveled to Tampa for evaluation on its crowd control techniques, Tobias said.
He added that GPD’s ofﬁ  cers are trained on 
defensive tactics unique to the horses, which include making arrests from the saddle and preventing people from grabbing the reins.
With each unit standing 10 feet tall, ofﬁ  cers 
have a vantage point over crowds, Tobias said.One mounted unit is equivalent to about 10 of-ﬁ  cers on foot when controlling crowds.
According to the agreement, the city is an-
ticipating about 15,000 people to attend the convention, which poses risks for mounted units and ofﬁ  cers on foot.Because the convention is considered to be 
a “National Special Security Event,” according to the agreement, the United States Depart-ment of Justice gave the city of Tampa about $49,850,000 in a federal grant.
The money will be used to pay for the con-
vention venue, equipment, supplies and for all personnel working at the convention.
Tobias, a former three-year mounted unit 
rider, said the opportunity for the GPD mount-ed unit to travel to Tampa is “priceless.”
“Many of GPD’s own residents aren’t 
aware that we have a mounted unit,” he said. “So for us to be invited to Tampa to work an event of this magnitude is incredible.”

Deputy U.S. Marshal Bryon Carroll 
said based on DNA evidence, ASO ob-tained an arrest warrant for Payne on Monday and submitted the case to the U.S. Marshals Florida Regional Fugitive Task Force.
The task force made the case a pri-
ority due to Payne’s history of violence.
Investigators determined Monday 
night that Payne was living three hours north of Gainesville near Douglas, Ga.
On Tuesday morning, the task force, 
which consisted of eight investigators from Gainesville Police, ASO and the U.S. Marshals, drove to Georgia to link up with members of the U.S. Marshals Southeast Regional Fugitive Task Force.
Carroll said Florida task force mem-bers determined Payne was staying in one of three possible locations.
After several hours of surveillance, 
investigators found Payne at a trailer on 51 Ivy Wood Drive in Willacoochee.
At about 10:15 a.m., about 20 inves-
tigators surrounded the trailer and or-dered Payne to exit. He did not come out right away but walked out three minutes later and was arrested without incident, Carroll said.
“We’re just glad we were able to ﬁ  nd 
him so quickly and get him into cus-tody,” Carroll said. “Payne was known to be violent, and we deemed his case a priority.”
Payne was booked into the Coffee 
County Jail until he is taken to Alachua County Jail.

The Tour de France is coming to 
Gainesville, or at least to one of its 
gyms.
Shands Fitness and Wellness 
Center, located at 1310 SW 13th St., is offering simulations of world- famous bicycle races in its Virtual Tour de Shands event.
One participant at a time can 
ride a bicycle in front a television that shows actual course footage.
Participants may bring their 
own bicycles to lock into a frame or can use a bicycle provided at the center. A computer adjusts resis-tance depending on the course.
“It’s open to anyone, not just 
athletes,” said Jeff Plasschaert, di-rector of the Virtual Tour de Shands event. “We just want to promote health and wellness through cy-cling.”
Amie Buehler, a 23-year-old ap-
plied physiology and kinesiology senior, had trouble with a 13-mile uphill stage of the simulation but she thinks practice will help.
“I ride my bike every day com-
muting, so when I ﬁ  rst started it wasn’t hard,” she said, “but as the course went on, it got really hard.”
The machine is available to the 
public Monday through Friday from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Satur-days from 7 a.m. to noon at $10 per session. Calling in advance is rec-ommended. 
The event ends July 21, the same 
day the Tour de France concludes.4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JULY 19, 2012

RAPE , from page 1He is being held in Coffee CountyExpert analyzing effects of change
lar racks. Publishers who wished to continue 
distribution on campus would have to sign a licensing agreement and lease space in the uni-versity-owned black modular racks.
UF did eventually notify the Alligator and 
other publishers of the plan in Fall 2010, after the university bought several of the modular racks and started placing them on campus.
Alligator representatives objected, noting 
the change could hurt distribution and that the lease is an unfair tax on free speech.
A particular problem Julin identiﬁ  ed is the 
power of the vice president of business affairs to determine how and where publications may distribute on campus. The rule does not contain clear criteria preventing censorship, which Ju-lin said violates the First Amendment.
During a July 2011 meeting between Alli-
gator representatives and UF administrators, 
administrators denied the plan would hurt readership or violate rights, but they allowed the Alligator to conduct an impact study.
The Alligator collected data on the orange 
racks during Fall 2011, and replaced ﬁ  ve with university-owned modular racks in Spring 2012 to measure differences in distribution.
At the end of the Spring semester, the Al-
ligator presented its data to retired professor David Denslow at the UF Bureau of Eco-nomic and Business Research and asked him to determine if the change to modular racks would negatively impact distribution.
On July 3, before Denslow could ﬁ  nish his 
analysis, UF advised the Alligator it would continue with its plan to replace 19 orange news racks with university-owned modular racks, regardless of the unﬁ  nished study.
“We’re disappointed that the university 
has been unwilling to wait for the results of a serious study of the actions it proposes,” Julin said.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said the 
university wants to move forward and is willing to work with the Alligator.
“The door is open,” she said.
The Alligator launched a campaign against 
the changes today at alligator.org/savether-acks.

Rebecca Harris wanted to 
learn guitar, but she never got the 
chance.
Rebecca, 20, died July 11 at 
Shands at UF from injuries after a hit-and-run accident on June 23 while crossing Southwest 16th Avenue on her bicycle.
Since Rebecca was young she 
always gravitated to the loners.
“If someone was sitting by 
themselves, even in elementary school, she would sit with them to make sure they weren’t alone,” said Shelly Harris, 44, Rebecca’s stepmother.
Rebecca lost her biological 
mother and gained Shelly as her stepmother when she was 7 years old.
Shelly Harris said the first time 
Rebecca met her she grabbed her hand and asked her to go on a merry-go-round.
“It made me feel accepted, im-
mediately accepted,” she said.
She said she remembers her and 
her “Becca boo,” as she called her, being at the back of family bicycle trips chatting away the time.
Shelly Harris said Rebecca al-
ways loved being outside.
She taught herself to surf and 
loved to scuba dive and paddle-board.
“She was the only one we could 
get to weed out in the yard,” she said.
In Gainesville, she was in the 
process of deciding to become a journalism major with a history minor.
“It’s been a very challeng-
ing but uplifting few weeks in Gainesville,” said James Harris, 47, Rebecca’s father. “Our faith and trust in God have been re-vealed.”
He said the amount of people 
who have helped them through-out this process has been over -
whelming.
A detective from the Gainesville 
Police Department came out sev-eral times to check in on the fam-ily.
“He was just being a human,” 
James Harris said.
Many of Rebecca’s sisters in 
Theta Alpha, a Christian sorority, held a vigil at Shands at UF when she died.
James Harris said many of the 
sorority sisters told stories about Rebecca, some of them he and his wife had never heard.
“When children go away to 
school it is a time for them to gain their independence and do what they do,” he said. “Many times parents don’t know how that evo-lution is going.”
Rebecca’s time at UF changed 
on Oct. 16, 2011.
Kayla Fernandez, a 21-year-old 
early childhood education senior, said she chose her as her little in Theta Alpha based off of almost nothing.
She said she chose her because 
she stood out in a crowd.
Talkative, tall and cute.Fernandez said she and her lit-
tle read the Bible together. Rebecca would regularly ask questions too deep for Fernandez to answer.
“She was just a very insightful 
person,” she said.
During their movie nights 
together, Rebecca would make brownie batter, which rarely made it to the oven.
One night they were hang-
ing out, and Rebecca decided she wanted to dye her hair.
The first time she looked at her 
newly dyed hair she said, “Eh, I’ll get used to it.”
“She rolled with anything,” 
Fernandez said. “... she was one of the most amazing people I knew.”
Rebecca’s death has touched 
more than just her big sister in her sorority.
Stefani Broome, a 21-year-old 
religion senior and president of Theta Alpha, said when alumnae heard about Rebecca’s death they flooded the sorority’s Facebook group with support and love for the sister they’d never met.
“She was definitely someone 
who was an active part of this so-rority,” she said.
Broome said she was light-
hearted and loved to meet people.
“She wasn’t exclusive in any 
meaning of the word,” she said.
Broome remembers going to 
Rebecca’s dorm in spring to teach her guitar. That’s when she really connected with her.
“She was the girl you saw on 
campus, in Turlington, everyone recognized her,” Broome said. “She was that girl.”

Today’s question:  Would you try the virtual Tour de 
Shands bicycle event?
111 TOTAL VOTES86% YES
14% NOTuesday’s question: Would you eat at a food truck on Turlington Plaza? New York Times turns a blind eye 
to the people of the Middle East
In a July 9 article in the New York Times, Scott Shane re-
ports that amid the chaos of the Arab Spring and the as-cent of the Muslim Brotherhood to Egypt’s presidency , 
the United States now ﬁ  nds itself contemplating new friend-ships in the region. What those friendships will now entail, according to Shane, are newly brokered relations between the U.S. and hard-line Islamist regimes in the area.
Shane makes the rather glib assertion that because the 
Obama administration, unlike the much-lamented Bush ad-ministration, is willing to negotiate diplomatically with not only the Muslim Brotherhood but also members of the ter-rorist organization Al Gama’a al-Islamiyya, it has ushered in what the State Department is calling “a new day in a lot of countries across the Middle East and North Africa.” In mak-ing this bold statement, Shane essentially cedes legitimacy to theocratic governance in a region not known for its sterling human rights record.
Shane states that in viewing Islamist groups, Americans 
are responsible for recognizing distinctions between levels of extremism. “American ofﬁ  cials did not always carefully dis-tinguish between Islamists, who advocate a leading role for Islam in government, and violent jihadists, who espouse the same goal but advocate terrorism to achieve it,” he said.
By this measure, whippings, beheading, amputations, sex-
ual segregation, religious discrimination, death for apostates and international hostility, even if only concealed for the rest of the non-Islamic world — including the United States and its ally Israel — are merely par for the course and ought not to be mentioned among “friends”as long as it doesn’t spill over into our interests.
This is, in my opinion, the same type of willful ignorance 
of danger that Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain displayed in the face of a rising German threat before World War II, tell-ing the British people repeatedly that no one, not even Hit-ler, could behave so rashly as to break the peace. It took a lion-like Winston Churchill to untangle the mess that Chamberlain’s sheepish behavior created.
If there is one thing that can be 
said of Islamist groups, or any ex-tremist group that claims a divine mandate, it is that they are sincere 
and acting in earnest. To put it another way, they mean busi-ness and should be respected and treated with caution.
Anyone who believes his or her God commands him or 
her to secure devotion by any means is not likely to participate in a lot of give-and-take or diplomatic aplomb. That would entail a weakening of the divine mandate under which they operate. A soldier of God will not concede this at any cost.
The Times can be counted upon to take its usual posi-
tion: If it’s bad for America, they love it. This isn’t much of a surprise to those of us who read it. What surprises me is the brazenness with which it also throws the interests of the ordinary people of the region under the bus as well.
What was the No. 1 fear of those who didn’t support the 
Muslim Brotherhood in the Egyptian elections? Religious op-pression. Why is the Egyptian military counsel withholding power from the new government? The same reason.
How many people are being killed across the region due 
to our seeming inability to distinguish friend from foe? Go ask the Iranians we abandoned in 2009 or the Syrians being massacred today.
The Times was swift to laud this so-called Arab Spring 
as hope and change. I wonder who they’ll endorse for presi-dent.

The Alligator needs 
your help
After two and half years of negotiation, UF has 
recently informed the Alligator that it will be re-moving 19 of our orange racks by Aug. 15, con-
veniently at a time when fewer people will be around to notice the changes.
These 19 Alligator racks, which are in some of the most 
visible places on campus, will be replaced by large black modular university-owned racks, similar to the ones on Turlington Plaza. In order to use these new racks, the Al-ligator will have to sign a licensing agreement and pay a fee to UF to lease space for our papers.
By removing our racks, we believe the UF administra-
tion is not acting in the best interest of the students. With UF now controlling our distribution on campus, what happens if we have coverage of the UF administration that they find unfavorable? Will this change our relation-ship with the university?
The uncertainty of this new arrangement will create a 
chilling effect, hampering our ability to provide students with the most accurate and unbiased coverage. Students might also receive less important news and information in the future.
The new modular racks could also have a  negative 
effect on our readership. They are less visible than our orange racks and are less protective against inclement weather.
Because we are independent, we rely on advertising 
funds to operate. If the new racks cause our circulation to decrease, we could potentially lose advertisers, mean-ing students will get fewer papers, fewer pages and less news.
Retired UF economics professor David Denslow Jr. at 
the UF Bureau of Economic and Business Research has been analyzing data to see what effects this change would have on our circulation, but the administration has refused to let him finish his work before removing our bins.
Today, we ask you, the Student Body, to help us Save 
The Racks. For more information, you can visit www.alli-gator.org/savetheracks. On the website, you can find and sign our Change.org petition, which we will be presenting to the administration.
No other publication at UF does what we have been 
doing for the students of this school for 106 years.
This is certainly bad for the 50 people who work at the 
Alligator each semester.
 It’s even worse for the 50,000 UF students who rely on 
our ability to provide comprehensive, independent and unbiased news.

Then, he comes from behind on 
the last event, the 4 x 400 relay, to win that race, again breaking the all-time UF record while also enabling the UF Mens’ Track team to win its first NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championship.
And he doesn’t even get nominat-

As a passionate, self-proclaimed feminist, I have a prob-
lem with the recent uproar resulting from Daniel Tosh’s decision to respond, rather menacingly, to a female 
heckler at one of his shows.
Don’t get me wrong, I thought Tosh’s response was pretty 
lousy. Most of all, his response wasn’t even funny. But does he deserve to be at the receiving end of an angry online mob that will not acknowledge that a bad joke is just that — a bad joke?
My point is not that rape should ever be taken lightly — of 
course not. There seems, however, to be some discussion of how a rape joke should be delivered and the context within which it is appropriate.
But who decides what kind of rape joke is ever appropri-
ate? Comedians make fun of all sorts of intimate and important things: religion, family, sexual orientation, death, people with disabilities, etc. The list is endless and hardly ever appropriate. If we draw a line at one point, then shouldn’t we police all other jokes just as harshly?
Everyone has a right to take offense to any jokes made by 
Tosh or any other comic act. When I attended Tosh’s perfor -
mance at UF last spring, I found myself laughing at jokes that were often harsh and highly inappropriate, but isn’t that what Tosh does? Shouldn’t the offended female heckler have taken the context into consideration?
After all, the woman was there to watch Tosh, and he isn’t 
exactly known for making intellectual jokes. He is best known for his crude, immature and offensive brand of humor that takes little to no consideration for any aspect of society.When an audience member called for 
Tosh to strip during his performance at UF in April 2011, his response was, “I’m not going to do that. It’s good to know 
whores get into UF.”
Ouch! If offending the audience members is a risk that co-
medians such as Tosh take, then heckling during such perfor -
mances is also a risk that audience members should take while being prepared for a candid and usually harsh response.
I feel bad for the female heckler who was upset by Tosh’s 
response. She had every right to feel that rape should not be a topic joked about at a comedy club. In fact, I am sure most of us feel that same way about some topic or another.
Our individual experiences, boundaries and perceptions of 
what is too much or too far should not be used to limit the cre-ative work of acts such as Tosh or other comedians.
Context in this regard is important. A politician or celebrity 
going on a harsh, offensive tirade is one thing, but you have to cut some slack for someone like Tosh, who rarely leaves anyone out from being a victim of his crude jokes.
Tosh made a poor choice of words and apologized for it 
promptly and what appeared to be sincerely.
Let’s just accept his apology and move on to more serious is-
sues. Fellow feminists, we have a lot of battles to fight, but this does not seem like one of them to me.

Speaking Out
“If you’ve got a business — you didn’t build that. 
Somebody else made that happen.”
President Barack Obama made that statement 
at a speech in Roanoke, Va., last week. This quote is mak-ing the rounds on conservative blogs and on social media websites.
Progressives and supporters of the president’s re-elec-
tion campaign might not understand what the big deal is. After all, the progressive ideology is perfectly in line with this quote.
You, the individual, cannot make it. You, the individ-
ual, have no chance. You, the individual, must struggle unless you allow greater government intervention in your life.
Progressives believe in government programs. These 
programs may have good intentions, but they rot the social structure. They corrode individual responsibility. They create dependence.
Out of this dependence, a necessity for more and more 
government is created.
With increased access to student loans, saving for col-
lege becomes less important to the individual.
With an extension of unemployment benefits and a 
loosened work requirement for welfare, looking for a job becomes less important to the individual.
With Social Security and Medicare, saving for retire-ment becomes less important to the individual.
When individuals en masse de-
cide to stop saving and instead rely 
on entitlement programs, government engages in massive spending.
Conservatives believe the individual is the fundamen-
tal unit of American society. The individual, when free in enterprise and occupation, has the ability to pursue a life of security and prosperity.
The president and his progressive supporters want 
you, the individual, to stop listening to conservatives.
Conservatives will worry you with talk of massive def-
icits and a growing national debt.
Conservatives will tell you that the government must 
live within its means. They will tell you that the answer to economic growth is a reformation of the nation’s gro-tesque tax code.
They will tell you that providing certainty to investors 
and business owners is the best plan of action.
Conservatives will warn of a coming debt crisis where 
the production of the nation will be sapped by the burden of government spending. In no distant time in the future, entitlements and interest on the national debt will swal-low the federal budget.
Conservatives, after all, believe in you.It is time for you to believe in yourself, despite what 
the president says.
You, the individual, can use the talent and skill ac-
quired through education and experience to pursue pros-perity. 
You have a choice: confidence or dependence; prosper -
ity or mediocrity.
Do not be fooled by the enticing programs that pro-
gressives applaud. They are short-term solutions with grave consequences in the long term.
For your prosperity and that of future Americans, con-
sider standing with Mitt Romney. Consider standing with conservatism.
Stand up for the rights of the individual. Stand for a 
limited government. Stand for enterprise and prosperity. Stand for a tax code that provides certainty.
This November, both sides agree that the choice is di-
vided along clear fundamental lines.
Standing with the president is to stand for dependence. 
Standing with Mitt Romney is to stand up for yourself.
Believe in yourself. Believe in the enterprise and pros-
perity that the individual is capable of.

At 27, Will Frazer decided to retire.
A UF business graduate, Frazer spent 
several years as a bond trader on Wall Street before returning to Gainesville and teaching math at F.W. Buchholz High School.  
He might be able to boast more about the 
second job.
During his tenure at Buchholz, which be-
gan in January 1997, Frazer led the Buchholz math team to eight straight state champion-ships and six straight national champion-ships in the math honors society Mu Alpha Theta.
Frazer, 53, began taking his students to 
competitions in 1998. They didn’t go well.
Although Frazer became discouraged, 
his students’ enthusiasm motivated him.
“I decided we were going to be winners, 
or I wasn’t going to do it,” Frazer said.
Winning the Mu Alpha Theta National 
Convention on July 13 marked the sixth straight national championship team Frazer has coached.
Although Frazer is competitive, he is 
especially excited to see his students grow personally.John Phillpot, an 18-year-old recent Bu-
chholz graduate, said the team developed his strong work ethic.
“I’d be such a slacker without the team,” 
he said.
Phillpot, who is attending Harvey Mudd 
College in Claremont, Calif., competed in eighth grade and throughout high school.
Preparation is what sets the Buchholz 
team apart, Phillpot said. Team members prepare for tournaments with two to three hours of nightly studying, and they took three tests each day for the first six weeks of summer, he said.
Ziwei Lu, teacher and math coach, said 
great students make the team what it is.
“There is no [other] school that is truly 
competitive,” Lu said.
This year, the Buchholz math team will be 
focusing on different competitions, includ-ing some that help determine the U.S. team for the International Mathematic Olympiad.  
Regardless of how those competitions 
turn out, Fraser and his students have expe-rienced a lot of success.
“If you’re the champion, you’re going to 
remember that the rest of your life,” Frazer said.8, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JULY 19, 2012

� THE DRUG CAN REDUCE 
RISK OF INFECTION BY UP TO 75 PERCENT. 
MICHAEL SCOTT DAVIDSON
Alligator Contributing Writer
Each year, enough Americans 
become infected with HIV to match 
the UF student population.
The number of those people who 
are unaware they’ve contracted the disease could nearly fill the Stephen C. O’Connell Center to capacity.
But the Food and Drug Admin-
istration plans to reduce this year’s statistics. On Monday , it approved the first drug to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Gilead Sciences’ once-a-day pill 
Truvada will now be available to uninfected individuals who may engage in sexual activity with HIV-infected partners.
“It keeps the virus from replicat-
ing in the body,” said FDA spokes-woman Stephanie Yao.In 2004, the FDA approved the 
drug for the treatment of HIV-in-fected adults and children 12 years or older.
But two large, randomized, dou-
ble-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials revealed Truvada’s potential for preventing contraction of the AIDS precursor, Yao said.
One study found that the drug 
reduced the risk of HIV infection by 42 percent in gay and bisexual men who participated in high risk be-havior. Another study focusing on heterosexual couples in which one partner had HIV showed Truvada reduced the risk of infection in the other partner by 75 percent.
Currently, the pill is only avail-
able as a preventative measure for adults and must be prescribed by a doctor. Truvada is expected to cost at least $13,900 a year for treatment in the U.S., according to Gilead Sci-ences.
The most common side effects 
reported with Truvada included diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, headache and weight loss. Uncom-mon side effects can include kidney problems or bone toxicity.
The drug is to be used in combi-
nation with safe sex practices, risk reduction counseling and regular HIV testing, according to a state-ment from the FDA.

Detectives from the Alachua Coun-
ty Sheriff’s Office arrested a Lake City 
man on Tuesday who was connected to a Feb. 24 bank robbery in Gainesville.
Robbin Dale McRay, 54, was arrest-
ed on felony charges of grand theft auto and robbery with a firearm, according to the sheriff’s office arrest report.
On Feb. 24 at around 9:30 a.m., 
McRay and an unknown suspect en-tered the Bank of America  at 7606 W. Newberry Road, ASO spokesman Art Forgey said.
According to the report, McRay 
walked up to two bank tellers and de-manded they put money in a plastic bag.
A second suspect walked around 
the lobby with a short-barreled shot-gun.
No one was injured during the heist, according to the report.
The suspects then fled the scene in a 
1994 Chevrolet van, which was stolen before the robbery from Shands at UF.
Following the robbery, the sherrif’s 
office launched an investigation and began narrowing down potential sus-
pects.
During their inves-
tigation, detectives interviewed McRay on Tuesday, who 
confessed he was in-volved in the heist.
Investigators are 
continuing their search for the second 
suspect, Forgey said.
McRay is at the Alachua County Jail 
where he is being held on a $160,000 bond.

BOISE, Idaho — An invasive insect com-
monly found in south-central Europe has been 
detected in southwestern Idaho, marking the first time the elm seed bug has been spotted in the U.S., according to federal officials.
A U.S. Agriculture Department specialist 
has confirmed the discovery of the pests that officials say don’t pose a threat to trees, despite their name — but do tend to enter houses and buildings in huge swarms.
The Idaho Department of Agriculture is-
sued a statement Wednesday warning that the bugs recently found in Ada and Canyon coun-ties can prove to be a “significant nuisance” for homeowners. Elm seed bugs invade homes during the summer to escape heat, and then stick around through the winter, the depart-ment said.
The quarter-inch pests, which feed on elm 
tree seeds and resemble tiny, brown cockroach-es with triangular back markings, do not pose a public health risk, officials said. But the bugs can have an unpleasant odor, “especially when crushed,” said Pamela Juker, a spokeswoman for the Idaho Agriculture Department.
Federal authorities will take the lead role in investigating how the insects got to the U.S. and how they might spread.
“I would image they will be able to give 
us some indication of the possibilities,” Juker said.
The USDA’s Animal and Plant Health In-
spection Service is expected to recommend ways to manage the pests.
Meanwhile, state officials are asking resi-
dents who come across the elm seed bugs out-side of southwestern Idaho to collect a handful of the insects in a plastic sandwich bag and mail them to the Idaho Department of Agriculture’s plant division in Boise.
The agency also is encouraging homeown-
ers who encounter the pests to contact their lo-cal university extension office for information on how to deal with them.
“What we’re trying to do at this point,” Juk-
er said, “is kind of track the bug in Idaho.”Swarming invasive insect from

By the age of 10, Whitney Mutch and her 
younger sister made a pact to always keep 
their own last name, even through marriage. Twenty-two years later, that pact is still in-tact and her passion for independence has now formed a community.
Mutch, a Gainesville native, created the 
blog Indie Gainesville last August as a way to organize a collective voice for the inde-pendent local businesses in Gainesville. As the wife of a local business owner, Mutch saw the issues that many local businesses were facing such as parking in the down-town area and felt they needed to be faced together.
Indie Gainesville now has nearly 60 lo-
cal businesses as members, more than 2,300 friends on Facebook and according to Mutch, who handles everything online herself, aver-ages 6,000 to 7,000 blog views per day.
While its original purpose was simply to 
bring together local businesses and promote awareness, its function has evolved further to include informing the community about local art and music events and acting as a liaison between local government and its lo-cal business owners.  
Mutch said one of its most successful en-
deavors to date was the Think Local Civic Forum in January, which they co-sponsored, and where all but one of the candidates for city commission was in attendance. More recently, Indie Gainesville and its members were invited to an informational meeting at the Depot Building where local businesses, entrepreneurs and restaurateurs were given an opportunity to see the space before it is formally offered to the public for tenancy.
The Facebook page has also become a 
space for residents and businesses to ask questions about where to find certain prod-ucts, share events and offer support.
Chad Paris, co-owner of Parisleaf Print-
ing and Design, a company that strives to help businesses become carbon neutral by planting more trees than they consume, is a member of Indie Gainesville. For Paris, the most important and helpful function of In-die Gainesville is its online presence.
“Indie Gainesville is extremely proactive 
online and has helped to increase our online visibility to like-minded individuals,” Paris said. Parisleaf was named the 2011 busi-ness of the year for its commitment to the environment by the Gainesville Chamber of Commerce.
Mutch said right now she is working on a 
back-to-school guide to Gainesville for new-comers and incoming freshmen that will be posted on the blog and possibly printed for distribution. It will include a guide to park-ing downtown as well as plenty of informa-tion about living and eating local.
“I used to go to the farmers market all the 
time anyway but now I have to in order to see who is new.” Mutch said.
During her childhood, Mutch remembers 
her parents always promoted buying local but according to her, “They’re not hippies.”
“I guess that’s one of the barriers I’m try-
ing to break down,” Mutch said, “the idea that buying local is only a hippie thing to do. You’re investing in your community, and you get back what you put in.”

According to a press release 
from Pat Lavery of Glory Days Pres-
ents!, Double Down Live, located at 210 SW Second Ave., is changing its name to HIGH DIVE. Everything about the music venue including, music variety, staff and ownership will stay the same. Even the logo is similar to the original.
In March, the Gainesville venue 
was sent a cease and desist order from a Las Vegas bar “Double Down Saloon,” which owns the trademark on the name. To avoid legal conflict, ownership decided that a name change would be the easier route.
High Dive was chosen because the bar is often labeled as a neigh-borhood dive bar paired with its high standards of providing ser -
vice.  
The new name came at the one 
year anniversary of the venue. It will be celebrating this week with a series of concerts. For a full list of upcoming shows, visit www.High-DiveGville.com.Local venue Double

Most weekends Jeff Abalos, a 
20-year-old political science senior 
would live off of two boxes of rice from Steamers.
But, the restaurant, located on 
1618 NW First Ave., closed its doors before May 1, 2011 and remained vacant until two weeks ago.
Owner of Gator Spirit Food 
Store & Coin Laundry, 58-year-old, Nailesh Patel, believes he has what it takes to make this spin on fast food last in the same location.
Steamers was founded in 1982 
and bought by the previous owner around eight years ago, who also owned Tasty Buddha.  
Now the one-room restaurant 
holds the name Gator Spirit Food  Store & Coin Laundry and still shares the building with the con-venience store and Laundromat, tucked away behind the Midtown bar district, giving it the appeal of a favorite local dive.The chef, Cedrik Austin, uses 
his 12 years of cooking experience to whip up meals in large, black-ened woks only feet away from the bench where customers sit and in-hale the rich smell of Indian spices in anticipation.
Austin adds his made-from-
scratch hot sauce upon request amongst the basmati rice, choice of meat and variety of fresh veg-etables.
Patel said summer business is 
slow in Gainesville, but the res-taurant has had positive feedback in its first two weeks and he has already developed repeat custom-ers.
Abalos has already been back 
twice.  
Although the restaurant is 
somewhat hidden, Patel doesn’t worry about advertising because he believes his customer’s opin-ions are more valid than writing on a piece of paper.
Gator Spirit Food Store & Coin 
Laundry has developed a solid customer base for nearly 25 years and Patel trusts word-of-mouth will continue to bring business to the restaurant.
The menu is similar to Steam-
ers with some additional items like samosas and deserts and with slightly higher prices but the same large portions.
Patel said he keeps his prices as 
low as possible because he knows that college students are his main customers and that they barely have any money.
“We want to provide a fresh 
and healthy option,” he said, “that is still cheap and fast.”12, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JULY 19, 2012

zation complete with a 266-seat the-ater and 80-seat cinema.
Adam Jalali, marketing associate 
for the Hippodrome, said the theater filled a void of what Gainesville was missing.
“We had humble beginnings, 
starting out in a hollowed out 7-Elev-en type of place, and we’ve grown from there,” he said. “We provided Gainesville with the cultural hub that it needed.”
Jalali said despite movies and 
television, nothing compares with watching live theater.“You’re seeing this production 
unfold and you’re seeing these hu-man beings absorb themselves in a role, and that’s something that’s just irreplaceable,” he said. “There’s something so much more captivating about live theater than any other me-dium.”
Jalali said that the theater manag-
es to stay successful due to the types of shows it produces.
“Our shows are modern and rel-
evant,” he said. “We stick around be-cause people just can’t get enough of it. It’s a completely different experi-ence we sell at the Hippodrome and I think we’ll be around for a while.”
Jalali said that from the moment 
a show closes, the Hippodrome staff immediately starts working on the next production.
This season will be the theater’s 
thank-you letter to its patrons by de-livering plays the audience has been demanding, Jalali said.
The theater will produce the 
Broadway shows “Other Desert Cit-ies,” “Venus in Fur” and “Avenue Q,” along with “A Christmas Carol” and “Robin Hood.”
The Hippodrome has been pro-
ducing “A Christmas Carol” for 34 years, he said.
“This is our most ambitious season 
yet,” he said. “It’s definitely diverse. There’s something for everyone and we went out of our way to get these great shows that you wouldn’t see in Gainesville unless we had them.”
The season begins with the first 
showing of “Other Desert Cities” on Aug. 29. 
Jalali said he usually gets emotion-
ally attached to each production.
“You become a theater person 
working here, and you see the process behind these shows and how much work goes into it,” he said. “You get into the show with your heart and soul and it becomes you. When the show does well, it makes you feel that much better ‘cause you’re proud of your work. “
Rocky Draud, managing director 
of the Hippodrome, said the theater has grown to become the cultural heart and soul of Gainesville.
“The Hipp inspires and nurtures 
artists through internships, work-shops, and festivals and contributes to the well being and the economy of our community,” he said. “For at least 340 days each year the lights are on and an event - a play, movie, civic forum, or community meeting - oc-curs at the Hipp.”
Draud said that theater is an es-
sential experience to the growth and enjoyment of life.
“Working here has been a daily 
reminder of how a small group of people working as a team with a common goal can create miracles,” he said.
The Hippodrome celebrates 40 years
It will produce five plays

Soccer
In Florida’s match against Auburn, the Gators were able to come back twice to win 3-2 in overtime. After Erika Tymrak tied the game at 1 in the 48th minute, three minutes 
later the Gators fell behind 2-1 on an own goal scored by Maggie Rodgers. This was the first UF own goal since the semifinal round of the 2008 SEC Tournament. However, 
Florida answered quickly. A little more than six minutes later, Tymrak scored her second goal of the game to tie it at 2-2. In overtime, Tymrak was able to help out the Gators 
again, this time with an assist to McKenzie Barney in the 97th minute. Barney placed it just inside the near post from six yards out for the game-winning goal.Women’s Tennis
Before the women’s tennis team could win back-to-back national titles, it first had to comeback in the national semifinals against Duke. After Alexandra Cercone lost the doubles point, she got off to a rough start in singles. After dropping the first set 7-5 to Mary Clayton, Cercone went on to win the next set 6-4. The third set showed signs of trouble again with Cercone trailing 2-0, but she went on to win the next three games and ultimately won the final set 6-3. Cercone’s win in singles claimed the deciding point in Florida’s 4-3 win over Duke, which advanced the Gators to the 
finals against UCLA.Volleyball
 
On Nov. 13, Florida was one set away from losing to then-SEC West leader Arkansas in Fayetteville. After losing the first two sets, Florida went on to win three straight to defeat the Razorbacks 3-2 (18-25, 30-32, 25-21, 26-24, 15-9). UF’s comeback victory was its first down two sets since Sept. 6, 2008, when the Gators rallied against Long Beach State. Sophomore middle blocker Chloe Mann led the Gators with a record-breaking performance. Mann had a career-high 19 kills and a match-high five blocks for 21.5 points, the highest by a UF middle blocker in the 25-point set era. Senior outside hitter Kristy Jaeckel tallied her eighth double-double of the season. Jaeckel 
had 19 kills, 10 digs, two aces, two blocks and a team-high of 22.5 points. The Alligator Awards: Best Comeback Nominees

Florida started the top of the ninth trailing 5-3 to Miami. Nolan Fontana led the Ga-
tors off with a walk, and Daniel Pigott got on next after getting hit by the second pitch. Just when the Gators had the winning run coming up to bat, Preston Tucker grounded out and they were down to their final two outs. In the next at bat, Mike Zunino extended his hitting streak to 14 games with a double to center to tie up the game. Zunino scored later to give the Gators a 6-5 lead. In total, Florida had five runs on only two hits in the ninth. They went on to hold Miami in the bottom of the ninth to win 8-5. The Gators’ win on March 4 was their 14th win in the last 15 games 
against Miami.

When Florida and Furman faced off on Nov. 19, Furman jumped out to an early 
22-7 lead in the first quarter. The Gators came back by shutting out the Paladins in the second and fourth quarters to win 54-32. Senior John Brantley led the Gators with a career-high four touchdown passes, including 64- and 80-yard completions to Andre Debose. Brantley completed 57 percent of his passes for a career-high 329 yards. He accounted for 73 percent of the Gators’ 453 total offensive yards. Senior Chris Rainey led Florida with 15 carries for 90 yards. De’Ante Saunders added a 25-yard interception return for a touchdown, and Jelani Jenkins wrapped up the game with a 75-yard interception return with 4 minutes left.

HOOVER, Ala. — The Gators 
will have one fewer tight end go-
ing into fall camp.
Sophomore A.C. Leonard, 
who was arrested on a domestic battery charge  in February, made 
the decision to transfer after talk-ing with coach Will Muschamp on Tuesday.
“It was a mutual decision,” 
Muschamp said.
Leonard has not decided 
where he will transfer. The tight end played in nine games last season and recorded eight catch-es for 99 yards.
“Sometimes it doesn’t work 
out, and he needed to move on,” Muschamp said.
According to the February ar -
rest report, Leonard pushed his girlfriend to the ground, pulled her hair and dragged her out of the apartment by her feet. He then locked her out of the room.
“I wish he wouldn’t have left,” 
senior linebacker Jon Bostic said. “I don’t have all the details to what went on with that, but I just wish him the best in wherever he decides to go. Somebody is get-ting a good player.”
Florida returns Jordan Reed 
as the starting tight end in 2012. Reed caught 28 passes for 307 yards and two scores last season.Omarius Hines will also see 
time at tight end position this season; however most of his time will be spent in the backfield. 
As a junior, Hines caught sev-en passes for 106 yards.
“We have the two freshman 
coming in we’re excited about,” Muschamp said. 
“We’ve got five scholarship guys at the position. That’s what we need.”

HOOVER, Ala. — While the Gators’ 
quarterback situation may be in flux, se-
nior Mike Gillislee gives them some cer -
tainty at the running back position. In fact, Gillislee has the 2012 season planned down to the box scores. 
“My goal is to get 1,500 yards and 24 
touchdowns,” he said at the Southeastern Conference Media Days on Wednesday. “I haven’t set a goal for receiving yet.”
Gillislee averaged 5.9 yards per carry in 
2011. Assuming he matches his yards-per-carry average from last season, Gillislee will need more than the 56 carries he ac-crued as a junior to reach his goal — 199 more attempts, to be exact.
As the Gators’ primary running back 
heading into the 2012 campaign, Gillislee will likely receive the necessary reps. Slat-ed behind Chris Rainey and Jeff Demps on the depth chart last season, Gillislee received just 12 percent of UF’s carries in 2011.
“[Coach Muschamp told me he regret-
ted it, but I don’t really see it as a regret because that’s in the past,” Gillislee said. “Now is my opportunity, and I will keep it that way.”
However, even with increased play-
ing time, reaching his lofty goals will be a challenge. The numbers Gillislee is aiming to accomplish would earn him a place in Florida record books.Rushing for 24 touchdowns in 2012 
would move Gillislee ahead of Tim Tebow, who scored 23 in 2007, as the best single-season mark in UF history.
Emmitt Smith holds the record for 
running back with 14 touchdowns on the ground during the 1989 season. If Gillislee hits the 1,500-yard mark, he would be 99 yards short of Smith’s single-season rush-ing record, which the Pro Football Hall of Fame member also set during his junior campaign in 1989.
“He’s ready to tote the load,” redshirt 
senior linebacker Lerentee McCray said. “He’s ready to be that premier back every-body wants him to be. He said he can get 1,500 yards. 
“I think he will get it if he wants it bad 
enough.”
McCray at Buck, Powell recovering: 
Junior Ronald Powell has been cleared to lift weights again after suffering an ACL tear in his left knee during the Orange and Blue Debut on April 7. 
Powell led the Gators with six sacks 
during the 2011 season.
“He’s squatting, doing everything, been 
cleared for straight -ahead running,” coach

UF senior running backFlorida Tight ends
Jordan Reed, redshirt junior – 
Initially recruited as a quarterback, 
Reed was moved to tight end last season. The junior has totaled 386 yards on 34 catches and three touchdowns in two years and brings the most experience to this position for the Gators.
Omarius Hines, redshirt senior – 
Hines will spend most of his time at running back this season but brings some much-needed experience to the tight end position. In three sea-sons, the senior has 41 catches, 559 yards and two touchdowns split-ting between the slot and tight end.
Clay Burton, sophomore – 
Burton transitioned from defensive end to tight end last fall due to in-juries and depth issues. The sopho -
more appeared in one game last season.
Tevin Westbrook, sophomore – 
Westbrook switched to tight end this summer. Last season, he appeared in three games playing as a reserve on the defensive line and special teams.
Kent Taylor, freshman  – 
Taylor is rated as the No. 1 overall tight end recruit in the 2012 re -
cruiting class according to Rivals.com. The four-star recruit from Land O’Lakes High is listed at 6-foot-5 220 pounds.
Colin Thompson, freshman  – 
Thompson is rated as the No. 6 overall tight end recruit in the 2012 recruiting class according to Rivals.com. The four-star recruit from Arch-bishop Wood Catholic (Pa.) is listed at 6-foot-5 255 pounds.

McCray to fill hole at Buck until Powell returns from ACL
Will Muschamp said. “He’s not changing direction or tak‑
ing on blocks right now. As many of you know with an 
ACL situation, that always takes time. … He’ll play for us this year.  When that will be, I don’t know yet.”
Until Powell returns to the lineup, McCray will regu‑
larly play the Buck position as a hybrid linebacker/de‑fensive end. 
McCray recorded 24 tackles (7.5 TFL) in nine games 
last season.
McCray will play Buck in the subpackage, and Powell’s 
injury will lead to increased reps in the regular package.
“Lerentee was a guy that was banged up a little bit last 
year,” Muschamp said. “I held him, he probably could have gone. (He) can play both outside linebacker posi‑
tions, can give us some edge rush in our four‑down pack‑age.”
Linebacker Jon Bostic believes McCray and Powell 
have similar playing styles. 
However, he admits McCray may have an advantage 
on the former top‑ranked recruit.
“Lerentee’s a little bit faster than [Powell],” Bostic said. 
“But really, they bring kind of the same thing to the table. They’re both physical.”
Muschamp expressed comfort with McCray filling in for Powell at the Buck position. Increased depth and ex‑perience are a luxury the Gators did not enjoy in 2011, he said.
“On defense, we return 15 of our 16 top tacklers, so 
that’s exciting,” Muschamp said.
“We had a lot of first‑year starters last year. Defensive‑
ly, going into last season, we had less starters than anyone else in the SEC. That attributed a lot to our inconsistent 
play across the board.”
Quarterback Battle: Will Muschamp 
is no longer one of the new guys at this year’s SEC Media Days; that distinction belongs to interim Arkansas coach John L. Smith and everybody from Texas A&M and Missouri.
As Muschamp reflected on his first 
season at Florida, he talked about last year’s depth issues at quarterback. Both Jeff Driskel and Jacoby Brissett took reps 
as true freshmen.
“Going into the first year, the issues I knew we had 
was a situation where we inherited a roster with two quarterbacks on scholarship — Tyler Murphy and John Brantley,” Muschamp said.
“I said this a thousand times last year, if we can keep 
John Brantley healthy, we’ll be fine. We were unable to do that. … That posed a lot of issues.  We lost a lot of confi‑
dence offensively. We struggled to move the ball consis‑
tently throughout the rest of the season.”
Even though he has yet to name a starting quarterback, 
Muschamp feels more comfortable about his options be‑hind center this season. 
Driskel and Brissett are “even” going into fall camp, 
he said.
“Both guys are talented, qualified for the position,” 
Muschamp said. “They’ll get equal reps.  I would like to 
name a starter before the season, but I’m not going to put a timetable on that.   If we need to play both of them, that’s 
what we’re going to do.”
Etc.: Muschamp said Andre Debose will be the Gators’ 
No. 1 kick returner followed by Mike Gillislee and Sol‑omon Patton. The second‑year coach has yet to decide among Debose, Marcus Roberson, Loucheiz Purifoy, Quinton Dunbar and Trey Burton as the punt returner. … Redshirt junior cornerback Jeremy Brown underwent surgery Wednesday for a broken wrist. Muschamp said he will be cleared for “full contact” Sept. 1. … Muschamp reacted to redshirt senior placekicker Caleb Sturgis’ selec‑tion as the only Gator on the Coaches’ All ‑SEC First Team 
by sending the rest of his players a text that read: “Con‑gratulations to Caleb Sturgis. The SEC coaches must not think much of the rest of you guys.” NOTEBOOK , from page 19
