78/57Firefighter who took foot charged with theft
PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) — Authorities say the St. Lucie 
County firefighter who took a man’s severed foot from an Interstate 
95 crash scene last year has been charged with misdemeanor theft.
Cindy Economou told told the Florida Highway Patrol after 
the Sept. 19 crash that she took the remains to help train her ca-daver dog. She eventually resigned from the St. Lucie County Fire District. She was arrested Monday.
FHP Lt. Tim Frith says the severity of a theft charge is usually 
determined by the value of what is stolen. Since there’s no law spe-cifically dealing with the theft of a body part, he says it was difficult to determine the monetary value of the foot.

Plaza, Saturday 4:30 p.m.
Many of the people here eat 
meals by the schedule of churches 
and charity houses.
While often referred to as home-
less or needy , almost all of them 
have shelter; a rented apartment that 
leaves no money for food or electric-ity, a cot and roof provided in char -ity, or a tent pitched in the woods.
Some sleep on sidewalks.                                 Until recently , they lined a side 
street along St. Francis House. A fence now prevents them from leaning up against the 
building opposite the shelter so they sleep elsewhere, in spots that most prefer not to reveal.According to the people on the 
street and those who work to clothe and feed them, the number of home-less in Gainesville has noticeably increased  in the last six months. A census of the homeless to be taken today and Wednesday is expected to support this observation.
On the south end of the plaza, 
a line forms for the Fire of God Ministries’ bus to Saturday service.
Many of those waiting are 
just as interested in the free, hot meal that is offered beforehand.                                        Bill, who has been homeless since October, repacks his duffel and won-ders where he stashed his sleeping bag.

The mystery is over.Six days after a text message 
that read, “The monkey got out of the cage,” went out to 40,000 UF students and professors, po-
lice named Andrew Tatum as 
the culprit.
Tatum, a 24-year-old former 
Mobile Campus employee, said he was at a friend’s house when he decided to see if the com-pany’s password was still the same.He said the message was 
a joke, spurred by the show “Family Guy” and YouTube Internet cartoons.
Many who received the mes-
sage assumed it was racially charged, par -
ticularly because it went out on 
the day of President Barack Obama’s inauguration.
Tatum said he hadn’t taken 
that into consideration and add-
ed that he voted for President 
Obama in the election.
“I just don’t want people thinking I’m racist or that the message was racist in any way ,” he said.
Mobile Campus, a mobile 
communication system UF uses 
to inform students and staff of 
emergencies, labeled the text message as improper use and locked its system after the mes-sage was sent out at 8:45 p.m. on Jan. 20.

student said when he clicked the “next” button on the screen

How would you like to pay another nickel 
for every beer you buy? And how would you 
feel if the UF-Georgia game wasn’t played in 
Jacksonville anymore?
These and other topics came up at Monday’s 
meeting of the Community Alcohol Coalition, a group of UF, Santa Fe College and city officials 
that periodically meet to discuss alcohol policy.
The group, formed in January of 2005 by UF 
President Bernie Machen, includes Gainesville Mayor Pegeen Hanrahan and representatives from local law enforcement agencies.
Officials complained during the meeting that 
state laws and Florida’s powerful alcohol lobby are preventing the city from cracking down on 
underage drinking.
Liquor licenses, issued through Florida’s 
Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, are hard to revoke, officials said, which forces them to find other ways to police the problem.
That is one reason, officials said, the city is 
pursuing an ordinance that would ban under -
age patrons from bars, clubs and restaurants 
that rack up too many alcohol violations. 
But UF Student Body President Kevin Reilly 
said he thought the ordinance was misguided because it would only spread the problem to 
other areas of the city and might be unevenly enforced.

Glover said he hopes to find

rent dean, Pramod Khargonekar, whose resignation was announced in December of 2007, stated that he would serve as dean through the rest of the academic year.

After calling off the search 
for a new dean of UF’s College of Engineering in March because of budgeting problems, UF formed a new committee earlier this 
month to try again.
In September, UF provost Joe

Study Abroad Fair adds day
UF’s International Center will 
host its Study Abroad Fair from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on the Reitz Union Colonnade today and Wednesday . 
Nearly 100 countries will be 
represented, including Australia, Brazil, Nicaragua and China.
UF has the largest study abroad 
fair in the U.S., according to the cen-ter’s Executive Associate Director, Susanne Hill. About 2,000 students stopped by fall’s showcase. 
Tuesday’s fair, which will run 
two days for the first time, will 
showcase only UF-sponsored pro-
grams, while Wednesday will fea-ture independent programs.
Hill said UF faculty program 
sponsors, study abroad advisers, a financial adviser and students who have recently studied abroad will be available to answer questions. 
“Students will be able to learn 
about all the different opportuni-ties available to them,” she said.
Study abroad adviser Angela 
Grindal, who spent a semester in Spain, encouraged students to come out to the fair. 
“It’s a culture shock,” she said.

The Gainesville City 
Commission approved a new 
community development on Monday night.
The city of Gainesville changed 
the zoning of the Plum Creek sub-division from an agricultural to a residential and commercial area.
The development is north of 
Northwest 74th Place and lies along State Road 121.
The Department of Community 
Affairs criticized the initial plan, and the petitioner redrafted it to address their concerns.
Criticisms included the lack of 
conservation areas and potential for urban sprawl.A similar plan for a community 
near Gainesville Regional Airport, Hatchet Creek, was saved from withdrawal by the petitioner only 
after Mayor Pegeen Hanrahan 
called the action disrespect-ful. The plan will be reviewed again in coming months at a City 
Commission meeting.
The peti-
tion is more 
than two years in the making and is complicated by sound or -
dinances, proximity to the airport and lack of up-to-date maps of the area.
“We’ll be sitting here listen-
ing to a new situation,” said Jack Donovan, a city commissioner. “That’s fine, that’s our job.”Commission zones

GENERATE $15.9 MILLION THIS YEAR.
By CURT DEVINE

Starting Feb. 1, Florida drivers will pay $25 
more for speeding tickets and $10 more for run-
ning a red light or not wearing a seat belt.
To alleviate a $2.4 billion state budget defi-
cit, Florida House and Senate members passed 
a budget package Thursday that charges traffic violators more in fines and fees.
Jaryn Emhof, a spokeswoman for the Senate 
president, said the increased ticket prices will generate $15.9 million this year and $63.1 million next year. 
The increase in fines will prevent budget cuts 
within the state court system, distributing funds between the state attorneys, state courts and public defenders. 
“The bill functions at a dual purpose,” Emhof 
said. “Our courts will run smoother and our roads will be safer.” 
A $25 increase for drivers going between 15 
and 19 mph over the speed limit will push the 
fine from $125 to $150. The $150 fine for going between 20 and 29 
mph over the limit will increase to $175. 
An extra $10 will be tacked onto all moving 
and nonmoving traffic violations, such as not wearing a seat belt or driving with an expired 
license. 
But in addition to these charges, Florida law-
makers have added other fees to the tickets, such as a $10 assessment fee and a $12.50 administra-tive charge that was implemented in 2008.
While the generated money will serve the 
court system, authorities do not believe the fees will have any effect on road safety.
Lt. Dan Brinsko, of the traffic unit in the 
Alachua County Sheriff’s Office, said fines and fees rise almost every year, but drivers rarely ad-just their habits.
“Enforcement makes roads safer,” he said, 
“not necessarily increased ticket prices.” 
If state lawmakers want to prevent Floridians 
from speeding, they should invest more in speed trailers and other equipment, Brinsko said.Fla. ticket fines to increase

And then there were three.
The final three candidates vying for the di-
rector vacancy in UF’s Honors Program will 
hold open forums this week to discuss the 
program’s future.
The candidates were chosen from a 
group of about 29 applicants, said Jeanna Mastrodicasa, assistant vice president for student affairs and co-chair of the Director of Honors Program Search Committee.
“I think all of them had good experience 
and great visions for the future of the Honors Program,” Mastrodicasa said of the selec-tions.
The first candidate to give a presentation will be Barbara Zsembik, who has been an associate professor of sociology at UF since 1996, according to her resume.
Zsembik will speak today to faculty and 
students from 9:15 to 10:15 a.m. in room 282 of the Reitz Union at the first Vision for the University Honors Program forum.
The next candidate to present will be 
William McKeen, chair of UF’s department of 
journalism. He will speak on Thursday from 
9:15 to 10:15 a.m. in 201A Criser Hall.
The third candidate, Kevin Knudson, 
will speak on Friday from 9:15 to 10:15 a.m. in 201A Criser Hall. Knudson is the associ-ate director of Shackouls Honors College at Mississippi State University.
Honors students are encouraged to at-
tend so they can weigh in on the candidates, Mastrodicasa said.
Although the final hiring decision is up 
to UF Provost Joe Glover, students’ opinions 
will be considered, she said.                 
Mastrodicasa said she expects the final 
decision to be made soon after the presenta-
tions.
The position has been vacant since sum-
mer 2007, filled in the meantime by interim director John Denny, Mastrodicasa said.
UF began looking for a permanent direc-tor this fall, she said.
Jeremy McMullin, the student representa-
tive on the search committee, said the main 
goal is to find a director with “a solid aca-
demic background.”
McKeen said he hopes to give the program 
a more personal feel.
“It’s part of building the small college ex-
perience inside the big university,” he said.
Knudson, the only candidate not currently 
working at UF, said he hopes to extend the honors program from two to four years and tweak admissions criteria.
“Not everyone’s going to get a 1400 on 
the SAT,” Knudson said. “That doesn’t mean they don’t belong in the Honors Program.”

Avid Barack Obama support-
ers since 2004, the Leslie family 
was finally able to see their hard 
work, and the work of millions 
of other Americans, pay off when 
they attended Barack Obama’s 
Inauguration.
A professor in the College of 
Journalism and Communications, Michael Leslie said his family re-
ceived an official invitation to the 
inauguration, which he plans to 
frame, because of their monthly 
donations to Obama’s campaign.
Leslie’s wife Agnes, a senior lec-
turer and outreach director at UF’s 
Center for African Studies, said her family first heard Obama speak 
in person at the 2004  Democratic 
National Convention in Boston.
“We were taking our oldest son 
Daliso around to look at colleges 
and we heard Barack was speak-
ing,” she said. 
Leslie attributes the family’s in-
volvement in Obama’s campaign 
to his son Taonga, 15.
Taonga, a high school sopho-
more, was the first student to start 
a support club for Obama at East 
Side High School.
He was also involved in a grass-
roots finance committee where he raised $200 by sending out e-mails 
to ask for money to support the 
campaign. 
Taonga said he relates to Obama 
because, like the new president, he has one African parent. He added 
that he wants to be a lawyer or a 
representative when he grows up.
His dad laughed and said “or a senator or a president. He’s very modest.”
When former Florida 
Representative Ed Jennings opened up an Obama campaign center in Gainesville, Taonga was given his 
own office in the building.
In June, the Leslies held a house 
party for Obama sup-
porters to plan their campaign involve-
ment. Then in May, they made a trip to 
Sunrise, Florida, to see him.
“He is a magnetic and inspir -
ing speaker and whenever you 
hear him, you are moved,” Leslie 
said. “It’s something about how he 
speaks to your mind that awakes 
thoughts that were once dor -
mant.”
The Leslies took every op-
portunity to be close to the cam-
paign. They attended Obama’s 
Jacksonville speech and saw Vice President Joe Biden and First 
Lady Michelle Obama speak in 
Gainesville. 
After Michelle Obama spoke on 
the steps of the Hippodrome, she 
walked out to greet her audience 
and shook Taonga’s hand. 
“Michelle looked at him in his 
eyes like ‘where have you been 
this whole time’ and gave him a hug,” Agnes said. “He just looked 
at me and said ‘Mom, did you see that?’”
On Jan. 19, the Leslie fam-
ily trekked from Gainesville to Orlando to Philadelphia, from 
where they drove to the inaugura-
tion. 
The excited, but bleary eyed 
family awoke at 3:30 a.m. on 
January 20 to make their way to the National Mall.
When they finally arrived in 
D.C., Agnes said that thousands 
of people were chanting, “Yes we can!” and “Fired up, ready to go!” 
in the underground station.
“I was born 1964 and this is one 
of the things I never expected to see,” Leslie said in reference to the inauguration of the United States’ 
first black president.
Although he said there were 
people of all colors in attendance, 
he described the view of the Mall as a sea of black people of all 
shades and colors.
“It was an overwhelming expe-
rience for me,” he said. “So many 
people who looked like me sup-
porting a president who also looks 
like me.”
Now that Obama has been 
sworn into office, the Leslies 
agreed that there is still more to be 
done to get the country back on its feet.
“Like President Obama said, 
this is only the beginning,” Leslie 
said.Professor recounts family’s trek to inauguration

“Are you sure you want to send this?” with a pro-
ceed button. 
But there was no such screen. And seconds 
later, the phone of one of Tatum’s friends let out a beep. Tatum did not get the message because he’s 
not a UF student.
“I didn’t call UPD at that time because I didn’t 
think it was that big of a deal,” Tatum said. “But 
immediately after it went out, I thought, ‘This is going to suck.’”
After the message was sent, Mobile Campus 
secured its system, changed its passwords and al-lowed only two of its ten employees to have ac-cess to them, said David Liniado, CEO of Mobile Campus. “We have had no issues like this since the company was founded in 2005,” Liniado said.
Liniado had been a co-worker of Tatum’s and 
said Tatum left the company in October on good terms when the company downsized.
Tatum said that he sent authorized text mes-
sages to UF students and faculty when he was the director of technology for Mobile Campus from September 2005 to October 2008.
The University Police Department tracked the 
IP address on the computer Tatum used to send the text message at his friend’s house. UPD showed up at Tatum’s friend’s house the day after the text 
message was sent out, and Tatum was there.

ny charges for misuse of computers, has reapplied

IDs,” he said. “I can’t remember the last time 
I was at the Swamp having a beer and didn’t 
see a member of the Gainesville Police checking 
IDs.”
Officials also discussed the possibility of 
levying a per-drink tax on alcohol. 
The city proposed the idea to lawmakers 
in its 2009 state legislative agenda, Hanrahan 
said. After the meeting, she said the proposed 
legislation does not have a spon-
sor yet and would likely not have 
a chance of being adopted until 
2010, if at all.
She said the tax would likely be 
about 5 cents per drink and could bring in about  $10 million to $12 million to the city, all of which would go to fund things such as police salaries 
and benefits, increased enforcement of midtown 
and downtown bars, alcohol education and DUI prevention efforts.
Machen supported the drink tax, before pro-
posing an idea of his own — trying to make the UF-Georgia game safer by encouraging officials 
in Jacksonville to implement tactics used by the 
Gainesville Police Department.
Hanrahan, who is in favor of alternat-
ing the annual game between Gainesville and Athens, home of the University of Georgia, said if Machen is trying to convince Jacksonville to 
give up the game, it may be a tough sell.
“I’m sure Jacksonville desperately wants to 
keep the game there, so don’t expect them to roll 
out the red carpet for you,” she said.Tax likely won’t 
pass until 2010

The Gator Nation
Culture war pits Camelot, CatholicismColumn
The first senator elected president since JFK has 
rapidly cobbled together an “iCamelot 2.1.”  
Famously dubbed an American Camelot by 
Jackie O., JFK’s time in office is comparable to President Barack Obama’s presidency so far. His massive power and influence is complemented by his image as a fit, photogenic leader riding the better angels of our nature 
next to a pretty wife with a signature bob. This collec-
tive memory spins together the auras of Kennedy and Obama much tighter than history may allow for. The 
paths of these two luminaries diverge abruptly, how-
ever, once the Pope is in the picture.  
Pope Benedict XVI stepped up this past weekend and 
directed the Vatican to throw down the first essential attack on the Obama administration’s policy regarding 
access to international funding for abortion. Obama was 
called arrogant, a bad listener and a disappointment by two of the Pope’s main mouthpieces after only days on the job.
The law that so angered the Pope is a political hot po-
tato that Obama attempted to handle with care. Enacted by former President Ronald Reagan in 1984, the  “global abortion gag rule” prohibited international nongovern-mental organizations connected to federal U.S. aid from 
using their money to provide regular abortions or lobby 
for less restrictive abortion laws in their own countries. 
Former President Bill Clinton repealed this same law 
on Jan. 22, 1993, and former President George W. Bush 
reenacted it on Jan. 22, 2001. Both men used the anniver -
sary of Roe v. Wade to make a point regarding their po-
litical convictions. Obama waited until Friday evening and only made a small announcement in a calculated at-tempt to slip the expected change past the weekly news cycle.
Even though he looks like your 
average German octogenarian, this 
Pope has a YouTube channel and 
works weekends. On Saturday morning his people fired off an an-nouncement — becoming the first 
to step up to the new president on 
a legislative issue. American oppo-
sition in the Republican or religious vein may have been 
too preoccupied with fighting aspects of the massive 
bailout flashing through Congress to respond properly, but the fact that the Pope took the lead in going after Obama could have lasting implications.
The very same weekend, Pope Benedict XVI brought 
four excommunicated bishops back into the fold in an attempt to heal the only Catholic schism of the 20th cen-tury. One of the four holy men is currently under inves-tigation for Holocaust denial, so the combined effect of 
last weekend’s events unites the religion under a much 
more conservative and combative banner.
Catholicism in America has been reinvigorated by 
the recent infusion of the strictly fundamentalist ethic of recent Hispanic immigrants, and the church now counts 
its equally conservative African bishops as many of the 
most prized leaders in their system. History may hold Pope Benedict XVI aloft not for his willingness to pick a fight, but for laying the groundwork for the selection 
of the first black pope. Unlike the strained shadow of 
Camelot, that shift would truly be change one could be-lieve in.  
Tommy Maple is an international communications graduate 
student. His column appears on Tuesdays.With the identity and motive of last week’s mystery 
texter revealed, the post-message frenzy could be 
described as truly bananas.
Andrew Tatum, a former UF student, has been demon-
ized and vilified as racist by many. The now-infamous text originated in a room of bored friends. Tatum simply clicked “next,” not knowing where “next” would take him.
Students who received the text saw the word “monkey” 
and were quick to assume that it was a derogatory racial com-
ment toward newly inaugurated President Barack Obama.
But Tatum, who said he is a Democrat, actually voted for 
Obama.
Those who interpreted the message as racist were simply 
projecting their own prejudices upon an otherwise innocent 
mistake.
But let’s be real. It was a poor choice of words on Tatum’s 
part, especially on a day when the nation was celebrating the 
election of its first black president.
However, Tatum owned up to his mistake immediately 
and is doing all he can to make right by those he may have 
offended. He’s publicly apologized for any harm he may 
have caused as well as for the time authorities wasted deal-
ing with his mistake. 
The Editorial Board respects Tatum. It takes guts to admit 
when you’ve made a mistake, especially when that mistake 
made so many people angry.
Taking over Tuesday 
with his media tour 
de force, beleaguered 
Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich 
made an astounding revela-
tion during his stay in New 
York City.
While boycotting his 
own impeachment trial, Blagojevich told “Good Morning America” that 
Oprah Winfrey’s name had 
at one time surfaced as a po-tential candidate to assume 
President Obama’s vacant 
Senate seat.
The Editorial Board could 
hardly consider itself bud-dies with Blago, but we have to admit “O” would have 
made for quite an interesting 
addition to Capitol Hill.
There’s no denying most 
politicians love a free hand-out or two — just ask Rod. We can only imagine her 
new colleagues frothing at 
the mouth in anticipation of Oprah’s arrival as she 
screamed, “Everybody gets 
a car! Everybody gets a car!” 
Though we do concede she may have to upgrade the 
vehicle in question to some-
thing a bit more luxurious.
Did somebody say 
Maybach?
Maybe Oprah would 
even film a farewell episode 
of her talk show on the floor 
of the Senate while commit-
tee hearings take place. Let’s just hope it’s not like the lat-
est edition of the “Oprah’s 
favorite things” episode, as the slumping economy has 
replaced free televisions with 
toasters from Wal-Mart.
Seeing a dumbfounded 
expression on Sen. John McCain’s face wouldn’t ex-actly scream must-see-TV . 
Blagojevich probably as-
sumed power lunches in Washington wouldn’t bode 
too well for Winfrey’s plans 
of slimming down.
But who knows if Winfrey 
would have even accepted the position? 
Taking home a cool $2 
million an episode suddenly makes Chicago winters seem 
downright balmy.

Letters to the Editor
Students have option not to 
dissect
We’ve all been there in high 
school — dissection day in biology. 
Chances are most of us have 
dissected a frog or a pig fetus in a 
lower-level science class, and unfor -
tunately students at UF are expected to continue this cruel form of educa-tion. 
Luckily , students across the 
country have been voicing their anti-dissection opinions, and many edu-cators have changed their curricula to incorporate more humane forms of teaching. 
Many universities, includ-
ing Harvard, Yale, Columbia and Stanford, have completely eliminat-ed dissection in their undergraduate classes and even in their medical schools.
Although UF has not eliminated 
dissection from its curriculum, it has begun to accommodate these stu-
dents by offering them alternatives to dissection without any conse-
quence to their grades. 
You don’t have to be an animal 
rights activist or even vegetarian — if you feel any level of discomfort at 
the thought of killing an animal (and 
who wouldn’t?), you have a right not to dissect. 
So as dissections begin next week 
and the stench of formaldehyde hits your nostrils, remember the four million animals killed each year for science classes. 
Talk to your TA or professor 
about your right to choose a humane alternative to dissection.
Animal Activists of Alachua

No bipartianship in Senate
“Bipartisanship” was the buzz-
word of choice during this past Senate term. 
The harsh reality is that the lead-ership of both parties forced one another into a partisan gridlock that left many important issues, like hand scanners and food service re-
form, untouched. Ultimately, it was 
the students who lost out.
It’s nothing short of a travesty that 
the Senate operates as a caricature of what it ought to be: an open forum allowing students to participate in the management of their school.
The brazen partisanship shown 
in the Senate, coupled with a severe-
ly bloated bureaucracy , has made 
Student Government inaccessible for most students.
The only party running in the 
spring election that pursues bipar -
tisanship with both words and ac-tions is the Progress Party . 
Drawing from former members 
of the Gator Party and the Orange 
& Blue Party , Progress is building 
a unique team of highly motivated candidates and supporters who in-tend to reform Student Government so it functions chiefly for the stu-dents and by the students.
The Gator Party can don the pro-
verbial emperor’s new clothes and 
rename itself  “The Unite Party,” but 
it can only guarantee the same inef-fectual Student Government that ex-cludes mass student participation. 
Progress’ dramatic first step in 
selecting an executive ticket across party lines demonstrates its dedica-tion to encouraging student involve-ment.

Progress made in SG party
After spending months reading 
about the bitter partisan fighting that has come to characterize the Student Senate, I was pleased to read that the Progress Party has reached out 
to both sides of the aisle. Finally , they are recruiting people 
based on qualifications rather than 
patronage.

In response to Nicole Safker’s 
question: You’re doing just fine. 
I follow the Alligator on Twitter, 
which gives me access to your sto-ries and paper that I wouldn’t nor -
mally have because I just don’t come in contact with your drop points as a business person. 
I know the Alligator doesn’t ex-

Keep up the good work!

You probably noticed it. I know I did. 
Last week, Warner Music Group 
and Google failed to reach an agree-
ment regarding royalties for music used in 
videos on YouTube, a site owned by Google. 
The result: WMG had thousands of user-
created videos either muted or removed al-
together from YouTube. 
One could assume that WMG’s decision 
was the act of a company anxious to protect 
its product and pocket some cash in this tentative economy. Last I checked though, 
WMG’s 2008 annual revenue amounted to 
$3.5 billion. Sounds so pitiful. Perhaps we could hold a bake sale for them.
I perused YouTube after the mass video 
removal and found several other videos say-ing some not-so-nice things about WMG. The Web embraces and encourages open-source thinking, not only for software but for other forms of media. 
Open-source keeps content available for 
use and modification as long as the original 
creator is referenced or credited. YouTube 
has parameters to credit artists. For instance, the site has established Video ID technol-ogy, which helps copyright-holders recog-
nize infringing video and make choices as to 
whether the videos are blocked, promoted or even monetized. 
With such a method in place, it appears 
that YouTube was leaning toward the adop-
tion of site regulations that would be more 
appealing to big media corporations. But WMG has taken their ball and gone home. Instead, the company should look into the 
costs of this move beyond the simple dol-
lars and cents. WMG has sacrificed massive amounts of free promotion.
My real beef with WMG, though, is that they are restricting creativity. Our gener -
ation is a generation 
that shares thoughts, 
exchanges stories and inspires ideas.
We wouldn’t be the 
nation we are today if we didn’t learn from previous nations, ap-
ply laws from other cultures to our own and pass those on to future generations. What if 
the Greeks copyrighted the idea of democra-
cy? What if they were somehow able to stop other nations from implementing a similar form of government unless royalties were 
paid? 
I am saying that copyrights and artists’ 
rights should be negated so that we can cre-
ate at whim. Art still needs to be bought by a consumer, but the use of purchased music and images for non-commercial expression should not be outlawed.
Artists should be happy to allow the use 
of their creation, not only for educational purposes and the chance to be the inspira-tion for a new artist’s work, but for the pure 
sake of self-expression. 
WMG has repressed our generation’s ex-
pression to make another dollar. No doubt 
their actions will successfully turn off cus-tomers and effectively turn artists into crimi-
nals. 
Corporations like WMG should know it 
is in the interests of both their companies 
and their customers that self expression of 
this generation, our generation, should be 
embraced and encouraged.

that even he can’t find them.                               
The homeless, who are are often 
victim to theft, find various ways to secure their possessions. Some carry 
around everything at once, while 
others leave their stuff at camp.
“Fire of God puts on a really im-
pressive spread,” he said, after he or -
ganized his bag. “It’s one of the best meals in town.”
The church’s refurbished  school 
bus usually shows up around 5:00 to take people to the dinner and ser -
vice, but today it arrives late.
Fire of God Ministries,         
Saturday, 5:50 p.m.
All but one of the 22 seats are 
doubled up with passengers when the bus pulls into Fire of God, a church which provides religious and essential services to Gainesville 
homeless.                                                                      
The bus is always full and there 
are vans that visit other parts of the 
city as well, said Jeffery Smith, 46, a Fire of God volunteer bus driver. Coffee is served,  food is blessed and the meal line assembles; women at the front, followed by married couples and children, and all others behind.
Tonight there is grilled chicken, 
macaroni and cheese, cabbage, rice, salad, mashed potatoes and gravy, rolls, desserts and tea.      When ev-eryone is finished eating, there is an hour of religious music.                                                     
A volunteer takes donations in a 
collection bag. Somewhere between 60 and 70 percent of the congrega-tion is unemployed and many of them pay in handfuls of pennies.
In the past, women have offered 
earrings and necklaces to the church, but were urged to keep them, said 
Marcia Cromwell, a volunteer at Fire 
of God.
Feeling inspired after a dozen or 
so songs, Pastor Arnold Liverman begins to perform faith healings.                                  More than 30 people line up with ailments ranging from depression to back problems.
The medical attention that the homeless receive is usually subpar because they don’t have insurance, Liverman said.
Bonnie Hummel, a minister at Fire of God, agrees.
“Illness takes a toll on them,” 
she said. “That makes them more interested in healing services.”                                      The service ends with a brief sermon on loving one another. The yellow bus loads back up and heads down-town.8, ALLIGATOR  TUESDAY, JANUARY 27, 2009

Alligator Writer
The tears of Pahokee residents could fill 
Lake Okeechobee. 
It is so different from any town in America: 
rural, yet with the plights of the inner city . The 
median family income is $26,265, and 32 per -
cent of the population lives below the poverty line. 
But for Nu’Keese Richardson, the tears 
never came from losing electricity or worrying about food. For Richardson, a current UF com-mit at wide receiver, an economic slump paled in comparison to the cruel shadow of death that refused to stay away .  
But Richardson’s story doesn’t start there, 
with the painful passing of a couple fam-ily members — one blood relative, the other just as close. Instead, it starts with friendship, something stronger than money, something so beautiful it can counter the sting of death.
Ever since he was about 4 years old, he es-
timates, Richardson has had friends he could rely on. Jarvis Byrd, Carlos Lammons, Vincent Smith and Brandin Hawthorne have been his 
best friends.
“We call each other brothers,” Byrd said.
Their friendship extended onto the foot-
ball field, where they started playing for the Pahokee Baby Blue Devils youth league foot-ball team at age 9. Like a lot of places, the boys of Pahokee dream of becoming star athletes. 
Unlike a lot of places, they have good rea-
son to believe it can happen. Former Blue Devil 
greats like Arizona Cardinals wide receiver 
Anquan Boldin come back and bring famous friends — Cardinals wideout Larry Fitzgerald and Washington Redskins receiver Santana Moss, to name a few — with them. Richardson’s first love was basketball, but 
his uncle saw him playing football one day and knew he was meant for the field, not the hardwood. He wasn’t the only one to notice.
“I loved watching him play little league, 
you know. (I) was amazed by his talent,” said Blaze Thompson, a former elementary school teacher in the area who would one day be-
come Pahokee High’s coach.
The group kept playing together through-
out middle school, and the family dynamic 
only grew. The boys did everything as one and spent many nights sleeping in one another’s homes. And it wasn’t just the original five. Everyone who played on their team became part of the family.
Dealing With Losses
That’s why Sept. 27, 2008, hurt so badly.That’s the morning teammate Norman 
“Pooh” Griffith was shot and killed while leaving the homecoming dance.
Richardson knew this situation too well.
Cynthia Hayes had been an asthmatic with 
lots of love for her son, Nu’Keese. One day , 
when Richardson was in third grade, Hayes was on her way to pick him up from her mom’s house after work when she suffered an asthma attack. She decided to speed home, and when she arrived, neighbors said she jumped out of her car and desperately raced to her front door 
while gasping for air, hoping to get within 
reach of her asthma pump.
She died on the front porch.At age 8, Richardson lost the person who 
loved him most.
“I saw him battling with it in school,” said 
Robbie Everett, Richardson’s aunt and the me-
dia specialist at Pahokee Elementary School. 
“He did the little things little kids do, like cry . He struggled a couple of years with it.”
Years passed, but football and friendship 
remained true. 
Richardson moved in with his grandmoth-
er Gloria for a while, but she had trouble rais-ing a young man, so he moved in with Everett and her husband, Juel, his sophomore year.
Two years later, Richardson was starting at 
quarterback instead of receiver, where scouts agree he will fit best, and was asked to lead a team reeling from Griffith’s death. A week af-ter Griffith died, Pahokee flew to Duncan, S.C., 
to take on Byrnes High — the No. 9 team in the 
nation — on ESPNU. 
The Blue Devils could not 
overcome the emotions of playing their first game with-out Griffith and lost 38-12, but responded by winning eight of their last nine matches. The culmination of that streak took 
place in Orlando, where Pahokee captured its third straight state championship with a 21-17 win against Trinity Catholic. 
With his third ring in hand, there was noth-
ing left for Richardson to do but take his game to the next level. But unlike other heavily re-cruited athletes, he chose not to milk the atten-tion thrown his way. Instead, he announced he would be a Gator last May . 
The list of offers Richardson received 
reads like a who’s who of football programs: Southern Cal, Miami, Alabama, Georgia, Michigan. He didn’t so much as visit another 
school.
Richardson was so eager to get to 
Gainesville, he tried to enroll early , something 
his friends Smith and Hawthorne were doing at Michigan. He came close, but was unable to 
complete the ACT verbal in time and still had 
a half-credit of English to take.
While he can’t join the Gators until this sum-
mer, he has put his time into playing basket-ball, hanging out with his friends who haven’t enrolled early and improving his grades.
“I want to be top-ranked in my class,” said 
Richardson, who currently holds a 3.0 grade point average.
Sticking to Offense
The Oklahoma drill varies depending on 
the age level and team, but in most youth leagues it begins with two players — a ball carrier and linebacker — lying on their backs about 6 yards from each other, waiting for their 
coach to blow his whistle. Once they hear the 
high-pitched shriek, each player races to his feet and hopes to beat his opponent. The run-ning back’s goal is to truck the defender. The defender’s goal is to tackle the running back.
When the boys were 11, Smith was play-
ing running back, and nobody on the team could tackle him. Richardson, who was being held out of the drill because of his status as the 
team’s quarterback, challenged Smith, saying 
he could make the tackle. 
Just like that, it was on. Both men lay on 
their backs, hearing nothing but their hearts beating and the excited squeals of teammates waiting to see a collision. When the whistle blew, Richardson and Smith raced to their feet and faced each other before charging forward.
Richardson was flattened.
The entire team burst out laughing at its 
star quarterback. Richardson said he felt dizzy 
and had to leave practice. He was staying with Byrd at the time, so Byrd had to carry him on his shoulders to get him home.
Richardson’s uncle dropped some food off 
at Byrd’s house, but Richardson was tired and decided to take a nap.
“When he woke up, he was asking where 
his food was. I was so hungry I had eaten his food,”  Byrd managed to say before erupting with laughter.
It turned out Richardson got a pinched 
nerve that day, and he has been hearing about it from his friends ever since.
Getting His Licks
When he joined the varsity team for spring 
football his freshman year, Richardson wanted to keep playing quarterback but lost the posi-tion battle to teammate Anthony Sheppard. The Blue Devils decided Richardson was a 
better fit for receiver. Richardson disagreed. 
He thought about quitting. Then 
Martavious Odoms stepped in.
Odoms, then a junior and now at Michigan, 
spent the summer before the season working 
with Richardson, teaching him the position. 
“Martavious can adjust to a football in 
the air better than anyone I have ever seen. Nu’Keese has adapted to that as well,” coach 
Thompson said. “It’s just amazing. You see the 
ball in the air and you think, you know, ‘How is he going to contort his body? How’s he go-ing to adjust to the ball?’ And somehow, some way, he gets it.”
Odoms also introduced Richardson to the 
art of the “crack-back.” A crack-back occurs when a receiver charges toward the middle of the field and removes an unsuspecting line-
backer from his cleats. 
For Richardson, it doesn’t get any better.
“Defense gets to lay licks all the time. It 
feels good to go across the middle and hit one of them linebackers,” Richardson said.
The only thing that could possibly make 
Richardson feel better is to get a full scholar -
ship and see his friends experience the same thing. Smith and Hawthorne are already at 
Michigan, Byrd is headed for North Carolina 
State and Lammons has offers from Florida Atlantic and Buffalo.
Five brothers going to four-year universi-
ties? Sounds like a successful family.

much else on the offensive end 
of the floor this season.
Parsons showed he may be 
the second scoring option UF coach Billy Donovan has been looking for.
“I think that in order to re-
ally grow and get better, you have to go through a lot of pain and suffering. I think that’s the case in life,” Donovan said. “Anything that’s important to 
you, there’s going to be a level 
of pain and suffering that goes into it.”
Pain is something Parsons 
became all too familiar with 
following UF’s loss to South Carolina.
The sophomore’s Facebook 
page was littered with insults 
in the days after the game.
“Anything you can think 
of, from blowing the game to ‘Work on free throws.’ Things like that,” Parsons said.
But Donovan believes miss-
ing the free throw against the Gamecocks may have been the turning point Parsons needed.
“People say, ‘Enjoy the 
process, enjoy the process,’” 
Donovan said. “The process 
can be miserable and tough and relentless and overbear -
ing and can weigh you down 
mentally and physically, and 
I’m sure with Chandler, he was at a crossroads with him-self on Wednesday. 
“We all were, with how we 
were going to handle this.  I really just tried to talk to him about it in terms of what is 
really im-portant to 
him, and what kind of 
player does 
he want to be, and how does he han-dle this going 
forward.”
Forward is the one place 
Parsons seems to be moving.
The sophomore was back 
in the gym late last night after the team returned home from Nashville, Tenn.He shot 300 free throws.“I think it shows you how 
everything can move so fast,” Parsons said. “How last week I went from crying in the locker 
room to coming out and play-
ing like I did (Sunday).”WERNER INJURED: The junior has an avulsion fracture on his 
right middle finger, which oc-
curs when a part of the bone tears away from the main mass of the bone.
He said he thinks the in-
jury happened during the Mississippi game.
Werner refused to blame 
the injury for his poor shoot-
ing in recent games.
“I don’t want to make ex-
cuses,” he said.

ness,” Butler said.
UF got to know Yow throughout the last 
year.
Yow coached the Wolfpack to an 80-
55 win against the Gators in the third 
round of the Women’s National Invitation Tournament last March, ending UF’s sea-
son. The teams faced off again in Raleigh 
earlier this season on Dec. 7, and UF got the better of Yow’s team 66-61.Butler said it was a unique experience 
for herself and her team facing one of the 
pioneers of the women’s 
game.
“It’s an honor,” Butler 
said. “We talked about it 
even before we went up there and last year when 
we went and she whipped 
our butts to end our season. Very hum-
bling, yet (we) also knew that we had to go up there and be ready to play.”Yow’s passing has allowed Butler and 
her team to step back from basketball and realize what’s truly important.
“We spent a lot of time with the team re-
flecting on her and what she gave the game, because I think that’s important to have that historical perspective,” Butler said. “And then really just as an example of leadership, 
this is how you should live your life every 
single day, trying to find ways to give back, trying to find ways to help other people up, not looking for excuses.”Gators familiar with former North Carolina State coach

The UF women’s tennis team is set on 
keeping its 23-match win streak against in-
state opponents alive as it takes the Linder Stadium courts at 3 this afternoon against Stetson.
Previously scheduled for Thursday , the 
match was moved to today . The Gators swept UCF on Saturday to open their season. The Knights, coached by 1996 and 1998 UF nation-al championship player Stephanie Nickitas, may have been the appropriate opener.
“(UCF is) a dangerous team with great coaching,” Gators coach Roland Thornqvist said. “I don’t want to take anything away from Stetson, but this was a momentum-building win.”
Thornqvist isn’t looking past 
the Hatters, either. He said his team has to maintain its physical-ity and not get complacent after its 7-0 win.
Junior Marrit Boonstra, 
ranked No. 34, won’t allow herself to become overconfident after an easy Saturday outing.
“I’m way better than last year, but we all 
have to keep the intensity up,” she said. 
UF is 181-32 all-time against Sunshine State foes.
After facing the Hatters, the Gators will 
host the International Tennis Association’s Team Indoor Regionals beginning Saturday at 10 a.m. UF will play No. 69 Oklahoma State.
Thornqvist said a win against Stetson will 
be pivotal entering the tournament.
ALEXANDER’S WRIST NOT AN ISSUE: Jessica 
Alexander easily outworked UCF’s Christy 
Core in a 6-2, 6-1 victory Saturday. And the 
right-handed sophomore did it with a ban-
daged serving wrist.
“It didn’t appear to cause her much dis-
comfort,” Thornqvist said. “I’m sure she’ll be all right for Stetson.”UF looks to extend streak vs. Stetson
TennisBut what say you, ever-optimis-
tic Gators fan?
You might claim that the team 
has found its identity after a heart-
breaking loss at South Carolina. 
This team is now resolved and will 
finally play so that the whole is bet-ter than the sum of its parts.
Some have even made beyond-
absurd comparisons between the loss against the Gamecocks and the football team’s loss to Mississippi.
(Side rant: I could write a whole 
separate column about this, but I’ll 
resist. It’s simply not true. The 2008 
football team was highly talented and needed something to light a fire. The basketball team, frankly , isn’t one heart-breaking loss away from winning it all.)
You might point out that do-it-all 
guard Nick Calathes had “only” 15 points against Vanderbilt. The key 
here is that it marked only the fifth 
game this season in which Calathes wasn’t one of the Gators’ top two scorers.
Unsurprisingly , UF is 5-0 in such 
games.
So maybe this was a turning 
point for Parsons. Perhaps some-thing changed in the sophomore af-
ter he choked at the free-throw line 
and stayed at the gym hoisting shots until the wee hours of the night.
It certainly would be a great cli-
mactic turning point for him, but he’s going to have to continue prov-ing it the rest of the season.
So, where do I stand? I tend to 
agree with the glass-half-empty 
folk. I’m still not buying this year’s 
team. 
With 20 games in the books, I 
firmly stand by my prediction that come Selection Sunday , the Gators will be under a “last four” heading, whether it be last four in or last four out. And I’m still leaning toward out.
But when it’s all settled, it seems 
a game against Vanderbilt will once again mark the proverbial fork in the road.
Which path will UF take this

Chandler Parsons woke up Sunday morning 
on the right side of the bed.
Still distraught three days after missing a free 
throw that cost UF its game at South Carolina, his 
roommate on the road, Dan Werner, suggested a change when they arrived at the team hotel prior to playing Vanderbilt.
“I usually get the bed by the vent. He’s from 
down here, so he’s kind of a wuss with the air and stuff, so I gotta go by the vent,” Werner said. “I was the first one in the room and I said, ‘No, we’re going to switch it up.’”
Sunday, a well-rested Parsons had the best 
game of his college career, scoring 27 points, shooting 7 of 8 from 3-point range and grabbing eight rebounds in the Gators’ 94-69 rout of the 
Commodores.
“I don’t know if that had something to do with 
it, but we’re going to keep that going,” Werner 
said.
Even Werner couldn’t have predicted the 
kind of offensive outburst Parsons had against Vanderbilt.
“Any time a guy hits his first five threes, 
you’re always surprised,” Werner said. “I don’t 
think you always expect a guy to go out and hit 
four threes a game, but to go 2 for 5 or something is what I kind of expected.”

So now what?
A year ago today , the UF 
men’s basketball team blew 
out Vanderbilt.
The 22-point margin fueled talk 
that maybe the Gators hadn’t com-
pletely dropped off the map after back-to-back national champion-ships.
The ensu-
ing collapse has been well-docu-mented.
S u n d a y, 
the Gators went to N a s h v i l l e , Tenn., and kicked the 
Commodores around again.
Chandler Parsons played a game 
he won’t soon forget.
But besides Parsons playing 
well, the game didn’t really teach us too much.
Or did it?It all depends if you’re one of 
those glass-half-empty or glass-half-full people.
The pessimists will say UF shot 
57 percent from the floor, which included a mind-numbing 15-of-25 (60 percent) from 3-point range, and that type of performance can’t be counted on every night.
Most people already knew that 
when the Gators are shooting well, they will almost definitely win. 
If common sense wasn’t enough, 
the statistics back up such a notion.
With Sunday’s victory, UF im-
proved to 10-0 when sinking at least eight 3-pointers in a game.
The critics will persist that this 
Vanderbilt team isn’t even one of 
the better Southeastern Conference 
squads, sitting at 1-4 in league play .  
And besides that, the SEC is ter -
rible this year, ranking sixth among leagues in the current RPI standings. It ranks behind the five other BCS conferences and is narrowly edging out the Mountain West Conference (0.5564 to 0.5521, according to 
RealTimeRPI.com).How will UF 
handle win at Vandy?
UF WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

The Gators’ Pink Zone pro-
motion for breast cancer aware-
ness had supposedly already 
taken place last week against 
Georgia.
But when the UF women’s 
basketball team donned the 
pink warm-ups and shoelaces 
once again Sunday against Mississippi, the reason for do-ing so was pretty clear.
The Gators were honoring 
Kay Yow, the longtime North Carolina State coach who died Saturday after a recurrence of breast cancer. Yow collected 737 wins in her coaching career.
UF’s coaching staff wore 
pink ribbons on its lapels, and 
there was a moment of silence 
before the game in Yow’s mem-ory for her contributions to the game of women’s basketball.
After UF’s win Sunday, 
coach Amanda Butler reflected on Yow’s legacy.
Butler remembered what 
it was like being around Yow 
while Butler was still the coach 
at UNC-Charlotte.
“I was very fortunate to have 
personal interaction with coach Yow,” Butler said. “It was a privilege to sit next to her in the gym and recruit kids and try to find ways to steal players from 
N.C. State, 
although it 
didn’t happen that way very often.”
Butler said 
she admired the way Yow lived and that everyone 
should aspire to touch lives the way she did.
Butler always preaches one 
word when describing how her team should play and the way she played: toughness.
But she said that characteris-
tic on the court doesn’t compare to what Yow faced.
“You talk about toughness 
— chemotherapy, traveling, knowing really in your heart that you’re probably living 
your last weeks, your last years, 
and still going out and coaching basketball and giving your time and your energy to someone else without complaining, set-
ting a positive example day-in 
and day-out — that’s tough-
