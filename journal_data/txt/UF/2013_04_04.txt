The Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce released addition-
al video footage Tuesday from the night of Mayor Craig 
Lowe’s driving under the inﬂ  uence arrest.
The video, taken on a ASO dashboard camera March 
21, includes dialogue between Lowe and ASO Deputy Jes-sica Rowland. 
Her comments implied Lowe received special treat-
ment because of his mayoral position and sparked contro-versy authorities and experts say is unfounded.
The video starts when Rowland and Deputy Lance Pal-
lett arrived at the scene where Lowe crashed his 2005 Hon-
da Civic into a road sign near the intersection of Northeast 
156th Avenue and Northeast 21st Street.
Lowe told deputies he fell asleep at the wheel while 
driving to visit friends in La Crosse. He added that he had 
three beers earlier.
“I can tell by your eyes, you’ve had a lot more than 
three beers,” Rowland said. “It doesn’t really matter the 
amount that you’ve had now because when we came up to you, you were not operating the motor vehicle.”
She goes on to say, “We could go a whole other route 
with that, but because of the job you have, we’re not go-ing to.”
Later in the video, she commented on the crash.
“You put us in a pretty bad situation here,” Rowland Video raises 
questions about Lowe’s arrest

Shands at UF patients may be at 
risk after an employee was accused 
of being linked to an identity theft 
ring.
Anyone who was a patient at 
Shands between March 2009 and Oc-
tober 2012 may have been a victim 
of identity theft, said Melissa Blouin, 
Shands director of news and publica-tions.
The information is believed to 
have been taken from the Family Medicine at Main, and its 14,339 pa-tients are being notiﬁ  ed, Blouin said.
Jackelyn Barnard, director of 
communications 
at the Ofﬁ  ce of the State Attorney, said two suspects have 
been arrested, and 
if convicted, they can face up to 30 years in prison. The investigation is still 
active and other arrests are pending.
Arthur Thomas Jr., an active em-
ployee of the hospital, was arrested Tuesday on a charge of fraudulent use of personal identiﬁ  cation infor-mation, according to a Jacksonville 
Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce police report.
On Oct. 12, Thomas was stopped 
by a Jacksonville police ofﬁ  cer for 
unlawful speeding and gave the of-
ﬁ  cer permission to search his vehicle. 
Inside his car, ofﬁ  cers found a black dufﬂ  e bag that contained about 1,600 personal identities, as well as debit cards with names other than his.
That month, investigators learned Shands patients victims of identity theft

Gainesville Regional Utilities customers  
have reported receiving scam phone calls say-
ing their utility bills are overdue and their ser-vices would be disconnected.The scammers are telling customers to have 
a cash payment ready for someone to collect at their houses, according to a news release.
“We do not contact customers by phone to 
demand immediate payment,” GRU’s Cus-tomer Service Manager Mary Brown said in the release. “Customers can check their ac-count status 24/7 by calling 352-334-3434.”
The scam is going on throughout Florida, 
and customers of other utility companies have been asked to make an immediate payment by debit card, according to the release.
If customers are contacted regarding pay-
ment and it seems suspicious, GRU urges them to report it to Gainesville Police.Ashley Carlisle, who has been a GRU cus-
tomer for two years, said she hadn’t heard of the scam, but when she pays her bills online, she sees warning signs on the website.
The 20-year-old UF recreation and event 
management sophomore said she didn’t think it was something many people would fall for.
“It’s kind of creepy,” she said. “Having 
people come to your door, saying you owe money would be kind of scary.” GRU customers experience scam phone calls about billsBarnard

tised as way to pass drug tests by 
using someone else’s urine.
KMOV-TV reported that Levin, 
of Lake St. Louis, was charged last week with possessing a forg-
ing instrument. He was arrested 
and released after posting $25,000 
bond, and pleaded not guilty on 
Monday.
Levin was on probation for 
possession of a controlled sub-stance and felony stealing in 2009. 
Authorities said Levin’s proba-
tion required he submit a urine sample as part of drug testing.
Levin did not have a listed 
phone number. Court records 
show he does not yet have an at-
torney.
In 2010, Gerald Willis, of Los 
Angeles, was sentenced to six months in federal prison for run-

Freezing weather wipes out German flea circus
BERLIN — An entire troupe of 
performing fleas has fallen victim to the freezing temperatures cur-rently gripping Germany.
Flea circus director Robert Birk 
says he was shocked to find all of his 300 fleas dead inside their transport box Wednesday morn-ing.
The circus immediately scram-
bled to find and train a new batch so it could fulfill its engagements at an open-air fair in the western town of Mechernich-Kommern.
Michael Faber, who organizes 
the fair, told The Associated Press that an insect expert at a nearby university was able to provide 50 fleas in time for the first show Sunday.
Faber says he hopes they’ll 
“get through this without any more fatalities.”
Birk said it was the first time 
his circus had lost all of its fleas to the cold in one go.

To address the demand for more housing 
on campus, a new residence hall could be built 
for the ﬁ  rst time in 12 years.
The proposed project would be a $20.5 mil-
lion addition on Southwest 13th Street, south-
east of the historic Yulee and Reid halls.
If the Board of Trustees approve the pro-
posal, construction of the new 250-student residence hall is expected to begin in Fall 
2013 and completed in Fall 2015, UF Hous-ing Spokeswoman Sharon Blansett wrote in an email. Having planned the new addition for the past year and a half, Blansett said the board would review the funding proposal this summer.
She said the proposed design includes a 
mix of single- and double-occupancy suites and “Super Suite” style rooms, where six resi-dents would share one to three bathrooms and a living room space. It will also have rooms equipped for students with disabilities.
“These features — having the [Disability 
Resource Center] nearby and providing ad-ditional ADA accommodations — will create opportunities to build a unique and support-ive community on the UF campus,” she said.Blansett said the purpose of the new build-
ing is to accommodate the demand from ﬁ  rst-time college students and students who wish to move on campus.
To ﬁ  nance the project, the University Facili-
ties, Planning and Construction department 
will use a bond sale that will be repaid by rev-
enues from student rent, Blansett said.
Severin Walstad, president of the Inter-
Residence Hall Association, said a new dorm is needed.
“There are some students who can’t even 
live on campus as freshmen,” the 21-year-old public relations senior said.

A ﬁ  ght between two men in 
southeast Gainesville Tuesday night 
ended with one man in the hospital and the other in jail.
Gainesville Police arrested Dom-
inic Gillins, 25, of Gainesville, on at-tempted murder and possession of a ﬁ  rearm by a convicted felon charges, according to a GPD police report.
At about 9:40 p.m., the victim, 
Ronald Reginald Whitford, went to Gillins’ uncle’s house at 441 SE 15th Street, said GPD Spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias, where he started argu-
ing with Gillins and his uncle.
The argument started at about 
9:40 p.m., when Whitford went to 
pick up his girlfriend at Gillins’ un-cle’s house. The ﬁ  ght escalated when Gillins grabbed a handgun and shot Whitford in the head, Tobias said.
The bullet grazed the top of 
Whitford’s head, Tobias said. He 
was later taken to Shands at UF for 
treatment.
When ofﬁ  cers arrived, they sur-
rounded the house and closed off Southeast 15th Street. Gillins was not at the house, but he was later brought back to the scene and sur-rendered to ofﬁ  cers, Tobias said.
Whitford’s mother, Dale Whit-
ford, said she was happy about Gil-lins’ arrest.
“I could’ve been planning my 
child’s funeral today instead of sit-ting with him eating dinner,” she said.
Gillins was booked into the Ala-
chua County Jail at about 5 a.m. Wednesday, where he remained that evening on a $750,000 bond.

More than 100 students from 
across Florida stood on the front 
steps of the old Capitol build-ing Wednesday to show their dedication to higher education investment.
Forty-one of those students 
were from UF.
Rally in Tally is an annual 
event put on by the Florida Student Association, an orga-nization of all the state univer-sity Student Body presidents. Its main goal is for students to advocate for issues that are im-portant to them.
They wore red shirts with 
“Rally in Tally” written on the front and the Aim Higher logo with all 12 state universities listed on the back.
“We’re happy that, despite 
the weather, this event was still a success,” said Kim Wilmath, director of communications for the State University System of 
Florida.
Students listened while 
Frank Brogan, chancellor of 
the state university system, dis-cussed investing in higher edu-cation, Wilmath said. Brogan said the university system has an $80 billion annual economic impact on Florida. 
Wilmath said the rally came 
at a good time, as Florida law-makers have indicated their interests in supporting higher education this year.
“It’s clear members of both 
the House and Senate know that higher education is a good investment,” she said.
This comes after the univer-
sity system suffered cuts of $300 million last year — the sixth 
straight year of higher educa-
tion budget cuts, Wilmath said.
Davis Bean was one of the 
UF students in Tallahassee.
“I really believe in the Aim 
Higher initiative we’ve been 
pushing for,” the 20-year-old 
political science sophomore said. “I think this was a great way to push the message.”Florida students rally

UF Housing spokeswomansaid. “You know, if you wreck a vehicle, we 
have to report it [to the Florida Highway Pa-trol].”
ASO Spokesman Art Forgey said Rowland 
didn’t violate any policies and followed proto-col when she reported the crash to FHP.
“She did nothing wrong,” he said. “Her 
choice of words were not well in that situation, but did it ultimately change the outcome? Ab-solutely not.”
Rowland and Pallett are both relatively new 
deputies, Forgey said. 
Rowland was hired in January 2012 and Pal-
lett in September 2012.
More-seasoned deputies may have called 
FHP sooner, Forgey said. 
However, Pallett and Rowland came to the 
right conclusion by eventually reporting the crash.
State Attorney Bill Cervone agreed.“The bottom line is [Lowe] got arrested for 
DUI, and he got taken to jail,” Cervone said.
The Office of the State Attorney and Lowe 
entered into a deferred prosecution agreement Monday. 
As part of the agreement, Lowe’s charges 
will be dropped if he completes a set of require-ments under SAO’s DUI Intervention Program, Cervone said.
Since the program was initiated in 2007, 
about 200 people have successfully completed it, he said.
To be eligible for the program, defendants 
must meet a series of requirements such as no 
previous DUI arrests and a blood alcohol con-tent of less than 0.20 at the time of the arrest, Cervone said.
Lowe had no criminal history before his ar-
rest, and his BAC levels were reported to be 
.069 and .061 when he took Breathalyzer tests 
at the Alachua County Jail.
“When I saw that [Lowe] had been arrest-
ed,” Cervone said, “I assumed that he would 
probably qualify.”
Lowe’s lawyer, John Kearns, wrote a letter 
to Cervone March 26, request-ing the agreement.
Within a week, the agree-
ment was signed, which Cer-
vone said is a standard pro-
cessing time.
“We don’t dork around for 
months and months and have some resolution we could’ve 
had in the first couple weeks,” he said.
Robert Rush, a local defense attorney, said 
he’s dealt with numerous DUI cases, and many of his clients have gone through the program.
Considering the facts of Lowe’s arrest, 
Rush said, if Lowe weren’t the mayor, his case would’ve been handled the same way.
“It looked like a pretty routine treatment of 
somebody in his circumstances by the state at-
torney’s office,” Rush said.
In reference to Rowland’s comments on the 
ASO video, Rush said they’re ambiguous.
Because Rowland’s not speaking about the 
night, Forgey said her remarks may be up to 
interpretation.
“It’s something that we may never know the 
answer to,” he said.

Neil deGrasse Tyson wants oth-
ers to see the world like an astro-
physicist.
In his talk Wednesday night at 
the Phillips Center for the Perform-ing Arts, Tyson explored science’s place in modern culture with more than 1,600 students. 
He addressed killer asteroids, 
pre-Euro coinage and the flaws of today’s American science as the au-
dience giggled along with the famed scientist and public speaker.
In the talk, Tyson showed how 
the United States is declining as a 
scientific power and plead for a re-vival of a futuristic “dream for to-morrow.”
“We want to be a country that 
values the things that move us into the future that was imagined 20 or 30 years ago,” he said.
In addition to being the Director 
of the Hayden Planetarium in New York City, Tyson is a prolific writer and speaker who reduces complex scientific ideas in a way that reso-nates with average people. 
One interjector called for him to 
run for president.
Tyson de-
clined, saying the relative shortness of politicians’ terms wouldn’t fix the problem.
“I want to 
compel the elec-torate to vote for 
politicians who dream of the tomor-row,” he said.
He emphasized the power that science gives people in everyday life, and the ways the U.S. fails to take advantage of them.
“The laws of physics allow us to 
predict the future,” Tyson said. “It gives us control of things you’d oth-erwise run from.”
In a Q-and-A session following 
his presentation, Tyson was asked about his inspirations, the meaning of happiness and ideas on religion versus scientific knowledge.
“I’m pretty sure the universe 
called me,” he said. 
Kurtis Lee loves to watch Tyson’s interviews on YouTube and was ex-cited to see him speak in person.
“My favorite part was when he 
talked about America’s scientific de-cline,” the 20-year-old math sopho-more said. “But I think with the teens in America, it’s not fixable.”
Brittany Natale, a 19-year-old 
business freshman, and Madalynn Dare, an 18-year-old statistics fresh-man, were just two of about 300 who sat on the Phillips Center lawn and watched Tyson on a projection.
“Everyone was so excited to get 
the tickets. We didn’t get them in 
the 30 minutes before they ran out,” Dare said. “But I learned a lot of new stuff.”

Shands was notified of the scams after a statewide investigation
that Thomas was selling the identities of 
Shands Hospital patients, according to the police report.
The other arrest was for Daremia Nikeka 
Crews, a former intern at Brentwood Primary Center, an affiliate with Shands at Jackson-ville.
She was arrested for the same charge Jan. 
23 in connection with identity thefts.
Crews was involved in a text conversation 
during which she sent hundreds of pictures of computer screens with a list of individu-als’ names, dates of birth and social security numbers.
Shands was notified when the Office of 
the State Attorney, the Internal Revenue Ser-vice and the U.S. Secret Service conducted a statewide investigation that involved UF and Shands, among other places.
“We take patients’ privacy very seriously 
at UF&Shands, and we are very concerned that this happened,” Blouin said. “We are tak-ing steps to make sure that it doesn’t happen 
again in the future.”The university was informed of the alleged 
incident Oct. 25 and, Blouin said, state and federal law enforcement officials asked to not 
release information to patients until the inves-tigation was finished.
Blouin said Shands notified patients by let-ter and is working with them to address their concerns.
“As for the future, we are always taking 
steps to improve the way we handle infor-mation and make sure we are keeping their information safe and private,” she said. “We let the people who work at UF and Shands know this has happened and we have asked 
people to be vigilant within their own areas 
to make sure they report any suspicious be-havior or activity that might have to do with patient information so it can be appropriately 
investigated and addressed.”

�THEY PLAN TO IMPROVE LOCAL 
CHILDREN’S EATING HABITS.

For a while, academic research has said 
locally grown food promotes healthy living. 
Six UF students enrolled in the Fostering Sustainable Behavior: Local Food Systems honors class found an inexpensive way to 
transform this theory into social change.
At the start of their semester project, 
these students studied the demographics of 
Gainesville communities and chose to focus on the Porters neighborhood.
Their research showed that lower-in-
come communities don’t usually have the best access to health care and could benefit from healthy eating habits. The solution for 
implementing habitual change seemed ob-
vious to them: Start with children.
“There are so many great things that 
come from working with kids,” said Lauren E. Killer, an 18-year-old English and theatre freshman. “It keeps kids active, and it keeps kids off the streets.”
The project creates a collaboration be-tween Florida Organic Growers and the Porters Community Center. It aims to en-courage Porters families to purchase locally grown food by subsidizing membership discounts.
The students plan to improve the eating 
habits of local children by holding work-shops about healthy foods, how to properly prepare them and the long-term benefits of doing so, Killer said.
The project is funded by a stipend. To 
measure the success of their initiative, the students plan to have the kids create a pho-to collage of their efforts, said 20-year-old industrial engineering sophomore  Luis E. 
Suarez.
Mariya Zarembo said if the program 
succeeds, she would like to expand it.
“We would love to have the people in 
the Office of Sustainability continuing with 
the program, possibly in other communi-ties as well,” said the 19-year-old marketing sophomore.
The students agreed the most attractive 
aspect of their initiative is its effect on the overall locality.
“It’s about making the effort to help and 
appreciate the local community,” Suarez said.

Anthony Rapp from the Tony 
Award-winning rock opera “Rent” will 
speak at UF April 18.
Best known for originating the role 
of Mark Cohen in the Broadway pro-duction in 1996 and for reprising the role in the 2005 movie adaptation, 
Rapp will speak on a variety of topics 
including how art relates to society.
Hosted by Reitz Union Board En-
tertainment and Accent Speaker’s Bu-reau, the free event will be at 8 p.m. in 
the Reitz Union Grand Ballroom.
Jordan Fine, co-director for RUB 
Entertainment’s Arts Committee, said 
there will be wristbands for the event. 
However, RUB is still determining how 
and when they will be distributed.
Fine said RUB considered several 
artists.
“We wanted to cater to a very wide audience, and I feel like Anthony Rapp was a good choice,” said the 20-year-old digital arts and sciences engineer-
ing junior.
Rapp will be paid $15,000 to speak.
To warm up for the event, RUB En-
tertainment will show “Rent” at the Re-
itz Union Cinema at 10 p.m. April 16.
Lindsey Dresbach looks forward to 
seeing Rapp.
Having seen the show on Broadway 
when she was 12, Dresbach said she 
still likes to listen to the movie sound-track.
“I would love to see him,” said the 
20-year-old telecommunication sopho-more. “Honestly, I think he portrayed the character perfectly.”

UF students perform local food study in Porters neighborhood�A STUDY FOUND FREQUENT 
FACEBOOK USERS WERE MORE LIKELY TO JOIN NEGATIVE MESSAGES.

A like. A share. A friend. A follower. Al-
though social media is a tool for spreading 
information, a recent study questions wheth-
er Facebook is being used to spread racism.
“People are more likely to say things on 
the Internet, email or even text that they 
wouldn’t be willing to say otherwise,” said 
David Markus, an anthropology doctoral 
candidate who teaches undergraduate cours-es in race and racism.
The study, published in the journal Com-
puters in Human Behavior, questioned 623 
Internet users. About 95 percent of partici-
pants had a current Facebook account and monitored their reactions to racist or suprem-acist posts, according to a Salon article.
Bruce Floyd, UF’s social media specialist, 
said social media is used to make things eas-ily shared and commented on.
In the study, the researchers found fre-
quent Facebook users were more likely to 
join negative messages or trends to feel in-cluded.
Markus said this concept is congruent 
with trends in society, but he warns that posts 
on the Internet are sometimes just meant to illicit reactions.
“While these big events do trigger mas-
sive shifts in perspective, in a lot of ways, people don’t know the opinions on every 
subject — or didn’t know prior to the access of social media,” he said.
Sean Quinn is the chair-
man of Action SG, an agen-cy that promotes transpar-
ency, accountability and 
service in UF’s Student 
Government. Quinn works 
directly with social media and works to gage trends on campus.
“The computer adds a level of obscurity,” 
the 20-year-old political science and public relations junior said.
Markus agrees, but does not think the 
context of the conversation about racism can 
be solved by using the backspace button.
“Racism is not a thing that will easily be 
overcome,” he said. “Combatting the trends 
that we may see can be done using the same tools, but in an age of immediacy ... that’s not 
going to happen.”Social media may up racism
“I would love to see him.”

Marriage equality is an issue of faith
On Tuesday, a fellow columnist wrote an open letter to 
Bill O’Reilly (a more apt title would have been “Are you there, Bill? It’s me, Erik.”) criticizing him for not 
defending traditional marriage. He posited that although Christians believe we should love and accept everyone, it’s 
OK to also believe that traditional marriage is between only 
a man and a woman.
He also argued that the federal recognition of gay mar-
riage as a legal union would soon lead to, say, the federal government also recognizing polygamy, bigamy and incest.
This claim is obviously an outlandish argument that 
doesn’t belong in the discussion.
If Skipper bothered to pay attention to the oral arguments 
in court or familiarize himself with what overturning Propo-sition 8 would mean, he’d know that the debate is centered solely on extending marriage rights to same-sex couples.
He has no proof to uphold his speculative argument that 
gay and lesbian marriages will ultimately lead to polyga-mous and incestuous relationships becoming recognized as legal unions. Furthermore, it is highly insensitive and insult-ing for a man who claims to maintain Christian values of love and acceptance to group homosexual relationships with incest. It is not unlike Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, group-ing homosexuality with bestiality and necrophilia. 
So, Skipper, I ask you: What’s your beef with marriage 
between two consenting adults?
In an excellent piece The New Yorker posted Monday ti-
tled “Wedding Bells,” legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin discussed the Supreme Court’s 2003 case Lawrence v. Texas, in which the court ruled that Texas’s anti-sodomy law “demeans the lives of homosexual persons.”
It was inevitable, Toobin wrote, that the Supreme Court 
would face a decision regarding gay marriage. To recap, the Supreme Court hearings regard California’s Proposition 8, a measure that deﬁ  ned marriage as between only a man and 
a woman, and the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), 
which bars the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages even in states where they’re legal.
After reading Skipper’s column, one would come to the 
conclusion that gay marriage is going to be ratiﬁ  ed in all 50 states tomorrow, but that, unfortunately, isn’t what’s hap-pening.
“Still, the stakes in the two cases remain huge,” Toobin 
wrote. “Edith Windsor, the eighty-three-year-old plaintiff in 
the DOMA case, had to pay three hundred and sixty-three thousand 
dollars in extra taxes after her wife 
died, because, under the law, the federal government did not recog-nize their marriage. DOMA also penalizes gay people by prevent-ing them from receiving Social Security survivors’ beneﬁ  ts, ﬁ  ling joint federal tax returns, obtain-ing green cards for their spouses, 
and enjoying hundreds of other rights and beneﬁ  ts. And, in addition to these practical considerations, there is the matter of the Supreme Court’s acknowledging the capacity of gay 
people for commitment and love.”
The Republicans’ only arguments against gay marriage 
— that it’s been illegal for so long and it makes some people 
uncomfortable — will not hold up in the Supreme Court. As they continue to ﬂ  ounder and fail to provide rational de-fenses of traditional marriage, the cases for the overturning of Proposition 8 and DOMA grow stronger.
Not even the Supreme Court, Toobin wrote, can reverse 
the march toward equality.
So, to people like Skipper, there’s only one solution for 
your discomfort with gay marriage: Get over it. If you don’t agree with gay marriage, don’t enter into one. It’s that sim-ple.
Nothing I write in defense of gay marriage will be as elo-
quent and succinct as Louis C.K.’s thoughts on the matter, however. He said, people “try to talk about it like it’s a social issue. Like when you see someone stand up on a talk show and say, ‘How am I supposed to explain to my child that two 
men are getting married?’ I don’t know, it’s your sh***y kid, 
you f***in’ tell ‘em. Why is that anyone else’s problem? Two guys are in love, but they can’t get married because you don’t want to talk to your ugly child for ﬁ  ve f***in’ minutes?”

A’Changing: 
AP changed its tune
As journalists, we try to stay on top of the latest trends, but we also pay close attention to the news that goes on in the journalism world.
This week, The Associated Press released a surprising — and 
potentially controversial — change to its stylebook.
The AP Stylebook is the book of vocabulary, grammar and 
punctuation guidelines and rules for all journalists. It makes you constantly doubt yourself, because it knows everything, and it makes you feel like you know nothing. We call it the “journalists’ Bible,” because, like the Holy Bible, quoting it makes you sound pretentious and often backﬁ  res.
Beyond being useful for grammar tips, the stylebook also 
contains the proper terms to call everything.
“A decision by Associated Press to stop using the term ‘illegal 
immigrant’ continued to generate debate Wednesday, with the move attracting support and derision,” according to a Los Ange-les Times report.
“The Americans for Legal Immigration PAC, which advo-
cates for measures to combat illegal immigration, said it will begin using the term ‘illegal invaders,’” according to the report. “William Gheen, the group’s president, called AP’s decision a ‘Big Brother’ move. The term ‘immigrant’ should be reserved for people who came to this country legally, he told The Times on 
Wednesday.”
Many members of the media seem to be trying to spin this 
decision from the AP as a way to control the immigration debate. 
Then why did the service discontinue that vocabulary?
“The discussions on this topic have been wide-ranging and 
include many people from many walks of life,” according to a release written by the AP’s Senior Vice President and Executive Editor Kathleen Carroll. “(Earlier, they led us to reject descrip-tions such as ‘undocumented,’ despite ardent support from some 
quarters, because it is not precise. A person may have plenty of 
documents, just not the ones required for legal residence.)”
“Also, we had in other areas been ridding the Stylebook of 
labels,” continued the release on the company’s blog. “The new section on mental health issues argues for using credibly sourced diagnoses instead of labels. Saying someone was ‘diagnosed with schizophrenia’ instead of schizophrenic, for example. And that discussion about labeling people, instead of behavior, led us back to ‘illegal immigrant’ again. We concluded that to be con-
sistent, we needed to change our guidance. So we have.”
Fox News wondered something about the decision that, in 
turn, made us wonder about Fox News.
“Some are wondering why the AP decided to nix the phrase 
when high-ranking government ofﬁ  cials don’t seem to have a 
problem with it,” stated the article.
And that means no one else can have a problem with it?The AP isn’t the only entity rethinking the term.“The (New York) Times, for the past couple of months, has 
also been considering changes to its stylebook entry on this term and will probably announce them to staff members this week,” wrote public editor Margaret Sullivan.
Do you agree with the AP’s decision, or do you think it was a 
wrongful attempt to drive a national discourse?

You can now tell your mom all those hours 
you spent making fake families on “The Sims” 
was for the love of art.
Institutions like the Museum of Modern 
Art and the Smithsonian American Art Mu-seum have included video games in their per-
manent collections, which has caused a stir in 
the art world and has opened the conversation 
to discuss the relevance of video games to a visual culture. 
The 14 games included in the MoMA ex-
hibition and the 80 games presented in the Smithsonian exhibition have given video 
games a new stance in the exclusive world. 
With rapidly changing notions of art, more 
people are starting to give credit to games as 
art, but to what degree remains up for debate.
“What you’ve seen is that some attempts 
to bring video games into the art world have been lost in translation,” said Ben DeVane, as-
sistant professor of digital arts and sciences at 
the Digital Worlds Institute in the University 
of Florida. “Some of these games that they’ve 
brought into the art world aren’t recognizable as art.” 
DeVane is on the design end of the gaming 
world, noting that there is a verifiable differ-
ence between art and design.
“Design is often focused on making things 
better and more functional rather than being 
expressive or experimental,” he said. “People 
like me look to art for inspiration in design, but 
the games my students and I make are not fine art.”
He said he wouldn’t consider 
games like the “Call of Duty” fran-
chise art because they tread on already 
well-established territory. However, games like “Braid” and “Gorogoa” are definitely close.
Admittedly conflicted about the subject, 
DeVane said he thinks the subject is hard to 
address because of the lack of a language that 
communicates between art and gaming.
Jack Stenner, associate professor of art and 
technology, is on the opposite end of gaming. 
His class in UF’s School of Art and Art His-
tory, Digital Media Workshop, focuses on a specific type of game, known as the art game, 
which separates itself from commercial video 
games.“I’m not interested in making a ‘Portal’ or 
making a commercial video game — not that there’s anything wrong or derogatory about 
those things,” Stenner said. “They’re wonder-
ful, beautiful things, and I’m glad they exist so that the technologies can get pushed forward so that I can play around and break them.”
Stenner and other artists who look to video 
game engines as a medium for their art are more interested in using the 
video game model to create an explor-
atory space.
In the art game “The Graveyard,” 
by Auriea Harvey and Michael Samyn, players assume the role of a woman walking through a cemetery, listening 
to a song. The game’s developer, Tale of Tales, described the game as “an experiment with 
real-time poetry — with storytelling without 
words,” on its website.
Stenner said art games use the technol-
ogy behind gaming, but usually the games 
are self-run. In “The Graveyard,” the player 
plays a minimal role in controlling the events of the game, but the piece needed to be a video 
game, not just a video.
“I think it’s abso-lutely intrinsic that [‘The Graveyard’] be in a game engine,” he said. “Typically, in good art, 
the medium is just as important to the experi-ence. That choice that was made by the artist 
is pretty intrinsic to the understanding of the 
work itself.”
“Super Mario Clouds,” by Cory Arcangel, 
is another art game that explores the hacking 
theme. Arcangel took an old cartridge of “Ma-
rio Brothers” and manipulated the game to 
erase everything but the clouds. The result is 
a clutter-free space of digital clouds that roam across a blue sky. No Mario, no music — just clouds.
Stenner said not all video games have to 
feature physical interactivity, and this is where 
many art games stem from.
Coming from the design world, DeVane, 
an expert on game theory, said artists have their own reasons to create these experiences.
“In some effort, they become overzealous 
and miss the point of the game,” he said.
Games and novels have something in com-
mon. They are categorized into genres. A truly 
experimental game redefines how you play it, 
Stenner said. He looks at games to see if it has 
pushed the limits within its genre to produce a meaningful experience.
“There’s a great debate,” DeVane said.
Part of that debate comes from the defini-
tion of art itself, which Stenner said is chang-ing with technology. The myth that art is about 
aura no longer exists, he said.
“The general populace and their under-
standing of art, especially in the United States, when it’s so rarely even taught, is that some-how, art is a one-off kind of object. That’s kind 
of an old-fashioned idea,” Stenner said. “But 
if that’s their criteria for saying video games aren’t art, then that’s been completely invali-
dated by a lot of theory and philosophy over 
the last few decades.”
DeVane and Stenner said they thought the 
games included in the MoMA and Smithso-
nian American Art Museum were included for 
their cultural significance. Just because games 
like “Pac-Man,” “Tetris” and “The Sims” are 
included in these institutions, it doesn’t au-tomatically stamp them as art, unlike an art 
game, which may be downloadable instead of 
in a gallery, they said.
Art is fleeting. One day, a piece can be con-
sidered art, and the next day, that definition can change, Stenner said.
“If I go into the Metropolitan Museum of, 
quote-on-quote, Art, 99 percent of the things I experience in there, I would say, are artifacts —- no longer art. They don’t talk to me the way the experience of art does,” Stenner said.
“The reason these games are being includ-
ed in the exhibits is because they were so im-
portant for so many young people at the time, 
and they were the first experience of the kind,” DeVane said.
Definitions of art have confused people 
with concerns for labels.
“They want to label ‘it is art’ or ‘it isn’t art,’ 
and if you think of art as more about an ex-
perience than an object that gets a title, then 
something else has to happen,” Stenner said. 
“Art isn’t an object anymore.”THURSDAY, APRIL 4, 2013

You know what big ears mean: 
big news.
Mickey Mouse shorts are re-
turning to the Disney Channel June 
28 as a throwback to Walt Disney’s original vision of the character.
The 19 episodes are hand-drawn 
in the ‘30s 2-D style, similar to the animation of “Steamboat Willie,” which was used when Mickey originally debuted in 1928.
A sneak peak of the shorts can 
be viewed at www.disney.com, where Disney has posted “Crois-
sant de Triomphe,” a short that 
takes place in France.
The three-minute short follows 
Mickey as he runs desperately 
through Paris, trying to deliver 
croissants to Minnie Mouse at her 
cafe.The other shorts follow Mickey 
through a variety of places includ-
ing Venice, Italy; Santa Monica, Ca-
lif.; Tokyo; New York; Beijing and 
the Alps. In these new environ-
ments, Mickey will face challenges 
with the help of his old friends 
Donald Duck, 
Daisy Duck, Min-
nie Mouse, Goofy and Pluto.
The first epi-
sodes will pre-miere on the Dis-
ney Channel, but 
can also be seen 
on www.disney.
com or through the WATCH Dis-
ney Channel mobile app.
These shorts remind us of how 
Mickey Mouse came to represent the happiest place on earth.
With his happy, silly ways, 
Mickey captures us yet again, pro-
viding entertainment in a simple 
2-D short.Cling to your childhood

you ever think that it will affect 
your career later in life? Do you 
use a pen name? I would.
Dear Friend,
An orgasm is something to look for, but honestly, it’s 
not that easy for every woman to achieve. Your girlfriend could be lying when she says, “Oh baby, oh baby, you rocked my world,” so go with your gut and be observant of her body language. Rushing to home base usually means you’re not doing so great down there. If you re -
ally are incredible, confirmation comes from your partner 
speaking up, which your girlfriend did. Dear Mediocre Advice,
I want to think that I’m as good at oral sex as my 
girlfriend says I am, but I don’t want to be overconfi -
dent. Is there some physiological tick that will clue me 
in as to whether I’m hitting the right spot?Dear Friend,
This column is tastefully dis-
gusting. On Tuesdays, I bang 
out the answers to these ques-
tions with complete bliss. I like 
being vulgar and confessing grody things that need to be ad-dressed because no one else will do it. That’s what I promise to bring to the table each week. 
As nasty as it may seem, that’s 
life: sexual insecurities, messy relationships, one-night-stands, bad sex and farts. It’s not classy, but we all have questions. I don’t use a pen name because I am 
proud of how I respond to the 
weird things in my inbox. The best feeling is seeing people read this column and tell me they laughed at a certain ques-
tion or they enjoyed it.Dear Mediocre Advice,
My boyfriend recently confessed that he mastur -
bated while thinking about me. It was a nice, but 
kind of a weird thought.What should I say?
Dear Friend,
Don’t say anything. Appreciate the fact that your man 
is slapping the bass to someone he has already seen 
naked. He could have chosen any woman to fantasize about, but he chose you. Enjoy the ego boost and the 
awesome boy

The audience did not buy tickets with their names on them, 
the microphones gave off feedback and the lights didn’t sync 
to their songs, but opening for a concert in front of a cheering 
crowd is all an up-and-coming rap group needs.
Originally formed for a high school project, local rap 
group Burra Katha, opened for Afroman in January and George Watsky in March. The group consists of UF fresh-men Jaewon Jang, Arnav Gupta and Taylor Col.
“This was definitely our largest crowd,” Col said about 
the 200-person audience at the Watsky show at High Dive.
Burra Katha performed its set of six songs for about 30 
minutes. After, a man complimented the group and com-pared them to the hip-hop group Beastie Boys.
“That was the first time someone we didn’t know said we 
did good after a set,” Gupta said.
The trio got its name from the Indian method of storytell-ing called “Burra Katha,” in which three men sing stories.
The group was mostly a side-hobby until they started col-
lege, booking their first show, in December 2012. 
As students, they have to balance rapping and school.
“I was studying all day before this 
concert,” Gupta said.
Michael Rizzo, a 19-year-old rapper 
who goes by Rezza, also tries to balance 
music and schoolwork.
Rizzo started rapping in high school 
with a group of friends. As a Santa Fe 
College journalism, public relations and 
business sophomore, Rizzo has gotten more serious in his music. He opened for Nappy Roots in 2012 and Hoodie Al-len Wednesday.
Regardless of the size of the audience, Rizzo treats every 
performance as if it were in front of a huge crowd.
Rizzo would encourage others who want to perform to 
know that music is a business and parts of it will be tough.
“There are going to be points where you think to yourself, 
‘I can’t keep going,’” he said. “Never give up — that’s the main thing.”10, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, APRIL 4, 2013

Jesters, jokers and jugglers will transform down-
town Gainesville into a world of amusement every 
Saturday night in April.
Jest Fest!, a new, family-friendly event produced by 
the City of Gainesville Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs Department, will take over Bo Diddley Com-munity Plaza at 6 p.m. Saturday.
David Ballard, event coordinator for the depart-
ment, has a background in entertainment. He knows many of the performers from his experience working as a professional fool, he said.
He hopes Jest Fest! will become an annual show and 
a signature springtime event in Gainesville, he said.
“Every night has some wonderful, different types 
of entertainment,” Ballard said. “I’m just hoping to see a whole bunch of folks out there, a whole bunch of smiles and lots of laughter.”
On Saturday, the audience can expect characters on 
giant stilts, a juggling show and a preview of the Hip-podrome State Theatre’s new production of “Robin Hood,” Ballard said.
Fabrice and Shannon Bouillaud, husband and wife, 
will perform as the Cirikli Stilt Birds.  
Shannon Bouillaud described their costumes as a 
surreal handcrafted mechanical puppet. She said each 
costume is about 14 feet long on 3-foot peg stilts.
Their act consists of a performance to music that 
tells a story of friendship between three stilt birds and 
a shepherd while they interact with the audience.
“People’s responses are always what drives our 
characters to come to life,” she said. Jest Fest brings

It’s used for research, net-
working and  dating — Society 
has a dependency on the Inter-
net and email. But would your 
dependence decline if Uncle Sam was taxing you? 
In a March meeting, California 
Councilman Gordon Wozniak suggested imposing a “bit tax” that would charge Internet users a cent for every gigabit of data he or she uses and “a very tiny tax on email,” according to Fox 
News.
The taxes would bring in bil-
lions of dollars a year and benefit 
the local economies, Wozniak said.
UF economics professor Mark 
Rush dismissed the idea, saying he doesn’t think the proposition will make it very far in Florida. He said there have been repeated attempts in the state to apply sales taxes on the service indus-try, which have been repealed after newspapers editorialize against them.  
Jeff Davis, a UF law professor, 
compared the “bit tax” to taxes on gasoline. He said the Internet is attractive to the government 
because it has 
become an 
integral part 
of people’s lives.
“The idea, 
in a sense, is that people are trapped,” 
he said.
Although Wozniak said the 
tax would benefit the economy, Rush said it is not reasonable to tax people for the webpages they access and the information they send. 
By taxing email and Internet, communication would be lim-ited, which could turn out to  be unprofitable, he said. 
At UF, students said the tax 
would be an additional expense. 
Some called it restraining and an 
infringement of their freedoms on the Web.
John Vidal, 27, a UF junior ma-
joring in telecommunications and 
minoring in computer science, 
said he thought the tax would be an invasion of privacy if the gov-ernment monitors emails.
“I wouldn’t use the Inter-
net less, but I would find other ways,” he said.
Aylin Kavrakov, 19, a UF 
advertising freshman, said the proposition for a tax is not in her 
favor because she uses the Web 
and sends emails daily.
“I have to use the Internet, 
and I can’t afford to lose money on something as ridiculous as that,” she said.Lurk now: future Internet tax possibleodd news 

Freshman guard Sydney Moss loses her grip on the ball during Florida 69-58 loss to Arkansas on Feb. 28 in the O’Connell Center.
PHIL HEILMAN
Alligator Staff Writer
As she has throughout the WNIT, Syd-
ney Moss dominated for most of Wednesday 
night.  
Unfortunately for the Gators, her teammates 
failed to provide the balanced attack that had proved so successful during postseason play. 
Moss notched a double-double, scoring 20 
points and grabbing 10 rebounds, but Florida (22-15) was eliminated with a disheartening 67-57 loss to Drexel in the Final Four of the WNIT in the Daskalakis Athletic Center. 
“She was really unstoppable in the first 
half,” coach Amanda Butler said of Moss. “I think she got a little tired in the second half. It was not any secret that we were short manned tonight. … That was difficult.” 
Moss entered Wednesday averaging 19.5 
points per game during Florida’s WNIT run and single-handedly kept the Gators within striking distance during the first half. 
The freshman guard scored 16 of her team-
best 20 points on 7-of-9 shooting prior to half-time. But the rest of the Gators struggled to score, making only 6 of their 18 attempts from the floor. Drexel (27-10) jumped out to a 27-16 lead on a three-pointer by Meghan Creighton with 5:04 remaining in the first half. 
Although the Gators cut the deficit to 34-28 
at halftime, the Dragons led by double-figures for much of the second half.
“Once they got a lead, they did a great job 
of slowing it down and milking that shot clock and scoring, “Butler said. “We just did a really poor job of defending.”
Hollie Mershon was Drexel’s catalyst 
throughout the game. 
As instrumental as Moss has become for the 
Gators, Mershon fills a similar role. She entered Wednesday averaging a team-best 19.4 points per game this season and continued her strong play against Florida, scoring a game-high 28 points on 10-of-18 shooting. 
Florida has faced multiple talented mid-
major players during the WNIT, but Mershon 
proved to be the best. 
“She’s so aggressive, so confident, very well-
rounded,” Butler said. “You’ve got to give her 
a lot of credit. … Mershon is very special, and they deserved to win tonight.”
Florida’s improbable postseason run fol-
lowed a disappointing regular season. 
UF finished in a tie for eighth place in the 
Southeastern Conference and won only 5 of its final 15 games entering the WNIT. 
But after looking listless in many contests, 
the Gators thrived during the WNIT, helping erase the memory of a tumultuous regular sea-
son.
Florida earned victories against Florida In-
ternational, Winthrop, Charlotte and James 
Madison — becoming only the second team to win four consecutive road games to make the 
Final Four of the WNIT since the tournament 
expanded to 64 teams in 2010. 
The Gators lose just one player — senior Jen-
nifer George, who ended her UF career with 10 points and three rebounds in the loss — from 
this season’s squad, which gives Butler confi-
dence in the trajectory of her program. 
“Nobody expected us to get this far,” junior 
guard Jaterra Bonds said. 
“Quite frankly, nobody ever expects us 
to win and advance, especially against good teams. But it’s just motivation for next year. We 
have to remember how we feel after this game, 
after this loss and make sure it doesn’t happen 
again.”

Florida’s game against Ole Miss 
on Saturday in Oxford, Miss., was 
moved due to rain. On Wednes-day, the rain followed the Gators to Gainesville.
No. 3 Florida (36-3, 10-2 South-
eastern Conference) picked up a 2-1 win in a rain-shortened, five-inning game against UCF (18-21, 1-11 Con-ference USA). 
The game ended in confusion as 
rain poured down on Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium in the middle of a Florida rally. The Gators had scored four in the inning to jump out to a 6-1 lead. But with one out, the rain started coming down heavily and 
the game was called minutes later.
“We were waiting on the bases 
for about like 5 minutes in the rain, 
and we didn’t know what was go-ing to go on,” first baseman Taylor Schwarz said. “Then everyone in the dugout started running for the tarp, so we kind of knew it was over.”
Coach Tim Walton added: “With 
the halted game rule, it always re-verts back to the 
last completed inning. So I’m not confused as far as the outcome of 
it, just obviously 
hate to put that much time into a game and have it shortened by 
weather.”
Florida’s two official runs were 
scored in the first two innings.
In the first, Kelsey Stewart and 
Lauren Haeger drew walks and Bri-ana Little got on base due to catcher’s interference, loading the bases for Jessica Damico. Damico drew one of Florida’s three RBI walks, but it was the only one that would count.
In the second inning, Kirsti 
Merritt drew a one-out walk and Stewart doubled, sending Merritt to third base. Home-plate umpire Diane Kendall called an illegal pitch on UCF hurler Mackenzie Audas, bringing Merritt in for the game’s second run.
“That’s been our M.O. We manu-
facture a lot of runs,” Walton said. “Whether it’s by hit, whether it’s by walk, hit by pitch. We had a lot of different ways we were doing things.”
Audas did not let the Gators take 
the bats off their shoulders often. Of the 33 batters the sophomore right-hander faced, 11 struck out and 12 drew walks. The first nine Florida batters did not put the ball in play.
Even in the four-run sixth inning 
that does not officially count, the Gators did not record a hit.

JOE MORGAN
Alligator Staff Writer
Florida ranked fourth nationally in 
rushing defense last season, surrendering 
only 94.5 yards per game on the ground. Defensive tackle Sharrif Floyd was the driving force.
The junior recorded 46 tackles, includ-
ing a team-best 13 tackles for loss. His three sacks and six quarterback hurries both ranked second among Gators.
Now departed and likely a top-five 
pick in this month’s NFL Draft, Floyd leaves a significant void in a defensive line that also lost nose tackle Omar Hunter and Buck linebacker Lerentee McCray.
“He held that spot down,” senior 
defensive tackle Damien Jacobs said of Floyd. “I’ve got a lot of respect for him as a player.”
Jacobs, nose tackle Leon Orr and fresh-
men Darious “Bear” Cummings and Joey Ivie will shoulder the responsibility of cre-ating penetration and anchoring the mid-dle, as Floyd and Hunter did last season.
The departed interior duo combined 
for 86 tackles, 17 tackles for loss, three sacks, six quarterback hurries, four pass breakups, two blocked kicks and a forced fumble in 2012.
Jacobs’ desire to make Floyd proud has 
been a driving force this offseason.
“He expects a lot out of me because he 
left it over to me,” Jacobs said. “It’s real, real big. I know how he would feel if I wasn’t to hold it down.”
Jacobs has impressed this spring, build-
ing on a strong first season at Florida. As a junior, he recorded 10 tackles, 2.5 sacks 
and a quarterback hurry in a reserve role.
“Damien Jacobs is playing very well,” 
Muschamp said. “Consistently, through 
12 practices, he’s improved himself, and he’s gotten better.”
 Muschamp wants consistency from 
his other defensive tackles. He specifically named Cummings and Orr as two players who need to improve before fall.
If neither makes significant progress, 
Muschamp said defensive end Dominique Easley would move inside, creating room for sophomore Jonathan Bullard at end.
Easley started 12 games at defensive 
tackle as a sophomore in 2011.
“Right now, if we had to start the sea-
son, Dominique would play inside,” Mus-champ said.
