A UF Transportation and Park-
ing Services employee was arrested 
Monday for cashing $8,401.75 in 
fraudulent checks she had written to herself, Univeristy Police said.Tiffany Nichole Robinson, 34, 
issued refunds for returned park-ing decals and disputed ﬁ  nes as 
part of her job, according to an ar-
rest report. Between April 2016 and March 6, she issued 25 unauthor-ized checks to the name Nichole Robinson.
UF TAPS Director Scott Fox re-ported the theft to UPD on Monday after a supervisor discovered a sus-picious check.
Police noticed Robinson wrote a 
driver’s licence number and birth-date that was slightly different than her own, according to the report. She also issued the checks to an ad-dress associated with someone who co-signed Robin-son’s vehicle. 
After her ar-
rest, Robinson 
admitted to po-
lice she had made the checks and 
cashed them, ac-
cording to the 
report.
Robinson was hired by UF in 
2008 as a ﬁ  scal assistant, said Ja-nine Sikes, a UF spokesperson. Rob-
inson is on administrative leave.
Robinson’s salary is $31,062.79, 
Sikes said.
Robinson was arrested on a 
charge of fraud. Authorities took her to Alachua County Jail where she remains, as of press time, in lieu of a $25,000 bond.

The debate over Smith Meyers' 
future as a Student Government of-
ﬁ  cial spilled onto Turlington Plaza on Tuesday.
Students calling for the resigna-
tion of Smith Meyers during a pro-test on the plaza were outnumbered by a group of about 50 people sup-porting the incoming Student Body president. 
After Meyers’ arrest during Spring 
Break for drunkenly knocking over two Harley-Davidson motorcycles, according to the Key West Police Department, a crowd of about 200 
people watched during what was 
originally planned to be a protest for Meyers' resignation.
But the group of about 15 protest-ers was met by counter-protesters, holding signs and voicing their sup-port for Meyers. Some held poster boards with jokes like "The Krusty Krab is unfair" and "Jet fuel can't knock over scooters." Others chant-ed, “Stick with Smith.”
Meanwhile, the original group of 
protesters called on UF to demand Meyers’ resignation while holding signs plastered with his mugshot and calling his character into question.
In a statement, UF spokesperson 
John Hines spoke to the divisiveness of the matter.
“It’s clear there are strong opin-
ions on both sides of this issue,” he wrote in an email.
Current Student Body President 
Susan Webster said in a statement released Sunday that Meyers’ status as a Student Government ofﬁ  cial will not change despite the arrest. 
Anthony Rojas, a 21-year-old UF 
political science junior who orga-nized the original protest, attempt-ed to address the crowd but was drowned out by chants and cheers 
from counter-protesters. 
Rojas said he invited the counter-
protesters to speak about why they 
don’t think Meyers should resign, but none took the offer.
“I think it’s important that ev-
eryone be active and participate in a dialogue around Student Govern-ment,” he said. “My problem is that 
 Meyers supporters outnumber protesters during rallyMEYERS WAS NOT PRES-
ENT AT THE MEETING.

Smith Meyers' Key West arrest 
smeared UF's reputation and is grounds for resignation, a group of UF students argued during a Stu-dent Senate meeting on Tuesday.
During public debate, critics 
of the incoming UF Student Body president took turns calling for him 
to step down while his supporters, 
clad in "Stand with Smith" stick-ers, urged compassion.
Meyers was arrested last week 
for drunkenly knocking over two Harley-Davidson motorcycles, ac-cording to the Key West Police Department, and police footage re-leased Sunday shows him appear-
ing to punch a witness. The arrest 
has sparked contentious debates on social media regarding Meyers' future as a Student Government of-ﬁ  cial. 
He is scheduled to be sworn in 
as president in April.
A group of 11 students, all of 
whom are currently or were pre-viously involved in SG, spoke of Meyers' accolades during his time as an SG ofﬁ  cial and his passion for 
public service.
Six others, one of whom was a 
former senator, spoke against Mey-
ers, saying he should resign and that the incident painted UF in a negative light.
Meyers, who is no longer serv-
ing as Senate President after  win-ning the Spring SG elections, was 
not present at the meeting. 
In a statement sent to the Alliga-
tor on Sunday, Meyers apologized 
to the Student Body for "represent-ing UF in such a negative light."
Senator Zachariah Chou (Inde-
pendent, Inﬁ  nity Hall) said most students who spoke during Senate  At Senate, calls for 
Meyers' resignation

Gainesville may see record-breaking temper-
atures early Thursday as farmers across the city 
prepare for potential frost.
With temperatures predicted to drop as low 
as 28 degrees early Thursday, National Weather Service meteorologists are expecting to issue 
frost warnings for Wednesday and early Thurs-day.
“For this time last year, we’re talking 30 de-
grees warmer on both ends of the scale,” said Nate McDinnis, a meteorologist intern at the Na-
tional Weather Service, adding that this time last 
year, there was a high of 89 degrees. This year, the temperature is expected to reach 62 degrees.
Gainesville’s previous temperature record for 
March 16 was 32 degrees in 1999.
While organizers said the frost isn’t going to 
deter preparations for the Kanapaha Gardens Spring Garden Festival this weekend, some farmers are taking precautions to protect their crops.
Greg Rogers, the owner of Rogers Farm in 
Gainesville, said he was not prepared for the 
intensity of what is otherwise a regular winter 
occurrence.
The 53-year-old is concerned about protect-
ing his peas, beans and strawberries this week, and has begun covering up the crops. 
“If I lose this 150 acres of stuff I got, yeah I’m 
worried,” he said. “If it gets below freezing, it probably ain’t going to be too good.”
Veronica Robleto, the co-owner of Siembra 
Farm, is planning on harvesting her crops early this week  — the tomatoes and eggplants are the biggest concern — in order to fulfill her weekly 
deliveries of vegetables and greens to local busi-
nesses and community members. She asked The Top, Alpin Bistro and other customers to 
submit their orders early.
“We’re going to do what we can to cover 
everything,” Robleto said. “But, as in much of farming, there’s a lot that’s left up to Mother 
Nature.”Gainesville prepares for

HE CASHED OUT $1,364 FROM 
WINNING SCRATCH-OFF 
TICKETS.
By Meryl Kornfield
Alligator Staff Writer
A Kangaroo gas station clerk ran out 
of luck Monday when he was arrested 
for stealing about $1,364 worth of win-nings from lottery tickets, Alachua Po-lice said.
During his shift Friday, Joshua Timo-
thy Taylor, 39, scratched off barcodes of 
40 lottery tickets, which ranged in value 
from $20 to $25, at 16070 NW Highway 441, according to an arrest report. The store’s district manager, Jim Wring, told 
police Taylor cashed out the winning 
tickets and pocketed $1,364 in cash.
Taylor left his shift with the cash and 
a book of lottery tickets worth $1,000, according to the re-
port. He took the tick-ets to High Springs to 
cash them. 
After his arrest, 
Taylor told police he 
took the lottery tick-ets because he was 
soon to be a homeless 
single parent of two children. APD was 
unable to recover the cash, according to 
the report.
Police arrested Taylor on a charge 
of grand theft. Authorities took him to 
the Alachua County Jail, where he was 
released Tuesday afternoon on his own 
recognizance.
Taylor could not be reached for com-
ment. Wring declined to comment.

it was more of a joke.”
Luis Taveras, a 19-year-old UF 
applied physiology and kinesiol-
ogy freshman, held a sign that read, “Pacman Hates Ghosts.”
“Pac-Man hates ghosts because 
Will Meyers didn’t do anything,” he said, referring to Meyers’ birth-given 
first name. “He’s a human.” 
Two signs from counter-protest-
ers claimed the Alligator, which pub-
lished footage of Meyers’ arrest, was “Fake News” and “Poo Poo.”
Cameryn Schultz, an 18-year-old 
UF applied physiology and kinesiol-ogy freshman, held a handwritten sign reading “Stick with Meyers” in 
blue letters. 
“This protest is ridiculous,” she 
said, but she declined to comment 
further. 
About 20 counter-protesters also 
declined to comment. 
Following the protest, five stu-
dents delivered a petition calling for Meyers’ resignation to the Dean of 
Students Office. More than 300 students signed 
the online version within a 36-hour 
period.
The students sat with Mickey 
Howard and Kris Klann, associate di-rectors of the New Student and Fam-ily Programs, to voice their concerns about Meyers. Klann said Dean of Students Jen Day Shaw was unavail-able due to a conference, but that Shaw will set up a personal meeting with the students. 
“I know this is a priority for her,” 
Klann said.
Nafessah Attah, a UF interna-
tional studies sophomore, said she attended the original protest be-cause students are making excuses for Meyers’ actions, which she ar-gued would have been viewed more harshly if he were a person of color. 
She said he should be removed from 
office. 
“If Smith was black, we would 
not be having his discussion,” the 19-year-old said. “We should not tol-erate this.”

had different opinions than sena-tors who spoke. 
“Look who’s been speaking; 
only senators have been speaking for Smith Meyers,” he said. “We’re 
supposed to represent the people 
and their beliefs.”
Austin Champoux, who served 
as Senate pro tempore when Mey-ers was Senate president from Fall 2016 to February, acknowledged Meyers made mistakes. 
Champoux said he wanted to 
talk about good things his friend 
has done for UF. He said Meyers 
helped Newell Hall renovations, advocated for student artwork and served as former budget chair. 
“I have not seen anyone put 
more hard work, sweat, tears into the Student Body than Smith Mey-ers,” he said. 
Andrew Cushen, a 21-year-old 
UF English and Spanish junior, said during public debate that he was disappointed by the lack of action following Meyers’ arrest. 
“Now incoming students and 
their families are familiar with Wil-liam Smith Meyers’ mugshot,” he said. “This makes our university dismissable.” 
Janae Moodie (Impact, Liberal 
Arts) said Impact senators wore orange and blue in solidarity with Meyers. She said Meyers has admit-ted his mistake, and shouldn’t be judged for a “minor misdemeanor.” 
“Is character admitting one’s 
mistakes and accepting them, and apologizing as a leader and influen-tial individual on this campus?” she said. “To me, that’s character.”
Casey Witte, who lost a sen-
ate election in Spring, recalled meeting a father of a prospective student who was hesitant of his daughter attending UF after read-
ing about Meyers’ arrest.
“I’m asking you to think about 
the future of UF, and what impact 
(Meyers) has had on the future of our university,” the 18-year-old UF finance freshman said.

Believing it’s ‘meant to be’ will hold you back
The world we live in is chaotic. It is shaped 
by forces we do not always understand. A handful of powerful people exert dispro-portionate inﬂ  uence over our lives. There are things we have no ability to control.
When faced with circumstances beyond our 
control, there is a set of beliefs we rely on for comfort. Chief among them is the claim that “ev-erything happens for a reason.” We tell ourselves the wicked will be punished, good will overcome evil and the obstacles we face will ultimately serve a great-er purpose. Unfortunately, when an idea offers us comfort, we tend not to scrutinize the other effects of that belief. Is the world really better if everything happens for a reason?
It is important to understand where ideas come from. 
Deterministic philosophies — those that explain the world through concepts like fate and destiny — originate from a time when our understanding of the world was limited. When war or disease spread in the ancient world, there was little the common people could do to protect them-selves and little information to understand why they were in danger. In this way, people could be compared to chil-dren today, and the same way we assure children that “ev-erything will be all right,” we developed the belief that, if we cannot protect ourselves, there must be some force that will.
The resilience of the determinist idea, the reason it is 
perpetuated by so many belief systems, is that anything can be taken as evidence in its favor. It is not a well-for-mulated hypothesis, with conditions for disproving as well as proving. Instead, it can be used to justify even opposite results. When someone with a terminal illness is praying for remission, we say she has been saved if her wish is granted, but it was “her time” if she still passes away. We don’t allow for any sort of test — we simply comfort our-selves that everything is going according to plan.
This is perhaps the most damaging aspect of determin-ism. If everything is evidence for a higher plan, then we must believe that every worldly occur-rence was meant to be. The philosophy encour-ages complacency. It assumes that all who suf-fer are deserving, or at least that their pain is necessary. In fact, determinism implies all evil must be necessary.
Instead of driving us to change things, deter-
minism urges us to simply accept how things are. This was not a huge detriment in a time 
where most people were powerless and uninformed, but we can no longer afford to plead ignorance. In the 21st cen-tury, nearly every person in America has access to dozens of sources of information, from newspapers and television to the internet. There are no excuses for being uninformed, and we have every means to join together and take action.
With the understanding we have of medicine, we can 
no longer shrug off thousands of cancer-related deaths as inevitable. With our access to political news and activist groups, we cannot claim politics are beyond our inﬂ  uence.
Nowadays, a determinist worldview is an immense 
privilege. It thrives in those people for whom life is gener-ally going well. If we are successful, determinism tells us it is because we are deserving. We need only look at health care debates for proof. Wealthy politicians turn up on news shows saying, if the poor want to be wealthy, they should work more hours, ﬁ  nd a better job, because if the world always gives us what we deserve, we can believe the poor are being punished for laziness. If the world gives us what we deserve, then everyone is where they are meant to be.
If everything happens for a reason we have no need of 
empathy, no cause to lift one another up. We are justiﬁ  ed in maintaining the status quo, so long as it serves us. Who is to say we deserve better?

column appears on Wednesdays.
A campus divided 
over a sloppy night
If there’s anything we have learned from the past few 
days, it’s that when there’s a hot-button issue on cam-pus, boy oh boy do people get contentious about it. But what’s funny is what we consider a hot-button is-sue. Nazi on campus? Racial slurs and vandalism of UF 
buildings? A one-party monopolization of Student Govern-ment elections? The occasional defensive comments on a column or editorial, one or two letters to the editor, but nothing close to what we’ve been seeing. 
In the past few days, our campus — much like our na-
tion — is split. Those who oppose Greek life, the “System,” or Impact Party had all their reasons for opposition realized and rallied against Smith Meyers, who now serves as a ﬁ  g-urehead for all the other side opposes. Those who stand for 
Smith Meyers — who wear their Impact shirts and letters 
with pride — are quick to defend him. 
It’s a division that’s felt a lot of the time, though we do 
our best to play it off as nothing serious. But given a reason, the people will rally. If you’ve taken a gander at Facebook comments in the past week or so, and compare it to the comments from other weeks, the amount and the bitterness for this particular topic is noticeably greater. 
We’ve made it clear where we fall on this topic Monday. 
Some of our columnists agree; some have said otherwise. Some of our readers agree; some have said otherwise. We’ve had more submissions of opinions on Smith Meyers than we can count. Some people denounce him. Some people defend him. Some people denounce him, but conditionally. Some people defend him, but conditionally. We’re not going to argue one way or another right now; we did that earlier. 
We’re going to take a step back and ask: why?Why has this — out of all the issues we’ve encountered 
this semester — been the one to cause the most ruckus? 
For people against Impact, they see concrete, indisput-
able evidence of all the things they’ve claimed Impact and its lackeys to be. To them, the lack of response from SG,  the lack of response from the university, the humiliation of national media organizations highlighting the story and looking down on our school,culminate to form what is, in their minds, the perfect argument. 
Look at the corruption, they cry. Look at the lack of pro-
fessionalism. We must stop them! We’ve tried for so long and ﬁ  nally there’s a reason, but no one is listening.
For the people backing Meyers, they see this outrage as 
the other side latching onto one slip up, determined to top-ple them. And they have dominated this playground for so long, they are not about to let one mistake ruin them. 
They are ﬁ  ghting back just as viciously — storming pro-
tests with counter protests, participating in those intense comment wars, making sure that people know they aren’t 
going to admit weakness.
People love to choose sides. 
People love to be part of a team. Though we don’t like to admit it, people are bound by 
mutual hatred of things — and the more speciﬁ  c the subject of our hatred is, the more united we are. 
To this, dear reader, we remind you that a Student Body 
divided will never be a strong one. It’s in our nature to cry for justice, to defend those we stand for, but we cannot 
swear off half the Student Body for disagreeing with us. 
Do we have a clear-cut solution to this? No (and if any-
one did, we’d be asking them to use it on our country). But 
it is something important to keep in mind as we march on.

Letters to the Editor
A response to “The double 
standards in shaming Smith Meyers”
I wholeheartedly agree that we should 
not ruin Meyers’ career over these events, 
however, I disagree on some key details.
The matter is, we are not responsible 
for the ramiﬁ  cations this incident has on Meyers’ career and position. To blame the portion of the Student Body speaking out 
against his position as our primary rep-
resentative and attempt to silence us by shaming us for holding him accountable for his actions is to promote the prolifera-tion of excusing the unacceptable for the 
privileged elite. 
The primary duty of our Student Body 
president is to represent our Student Body. 
He did so in a nationally published manner 
that has already impacted the reputation 
of UF and its standards; of its students, their caliber, ethics and professionalism; and, inevitably, of the degrees this univer-sity awards. You cannot write off multiple 
people speaking out against something that 
so extremely impacts them as “mob men-tality.” Consider other protests and large groups speaking out against wrongful ac-tions, and consider again the dangerous precedent you’re beginning to establish with that claim.
You claim we should “indisputably 
hold Meyers accountable for his actions.” Calling for him to resign as Student Body president is what holding him accountable looks like. You claim that we should “also 
remember how easily we could be in the 
same position and give him the same con-sideration we would want for ourselves.” 
Many of us could not easily be in the 
same position. Those who could “easily do this” should probably not accept posi-tions that include being responsible for the representation of a Student Body of more than 52,000 students, a position that places 
you consistently under the public eye and 
contributes to the reputation of The Gator Nation as a whole.
I agree that Meyers deserves the same 
consideration I would hope for if I were in his position. Ignoring the ramiﬁ  cations of his actions is not “consideration,” how-ever. Consideration is ensuring that bully-ing and ridicule — destructive comments 
and measures that are not for the cause of ensuring appropriate representation of the 
Student Body — do not occur. As I speak out against his position as incoming Stu-dent Body president, I commit myself to 
ensuring that my words and actions do not 
stoop to that level. Those two measures are not exclusive. 
Keep in mind the fact that the Key West 
Police Department ofﬁ  cer, who repeatedly 
attempted to offer Meyers the opportunity 
to explain, admit to or apologize for his ac-tions to no avail, still chose to charge Mey-ers with the misdemeanor of criminal mis-
chief rather than an alcohol-related charge 
is extensive consideration of his future as-pirations. 
I have enough compassion toward Mey-
ers to support and admire this ofﬁ  cer’s de-
cision. 
Asking me to allow him to remain in 
ofﬁ  ce, to excuse and overlook this unfair, 
disrespectful and extremely detrimental

Dear people of the great 
state of Florida:
Hello! I am a third-grade student in 
Northern Virginia. In the third grade, we 
do “state reports,” and I have chosen your 
state! I am very excited to learn more 
about the great state of Florida as I work on my report.
Most of the information we get for our 
reports will be from books and websites. We also like to get information from people 
who live in the state. This is why I am writ-
ing to you. I was hoping you would be will-
ing to send me some items to help me learn more about the best things in your state. It could be things like postcards, maps, pic-tures, souvenirs, general information, this 
newspaper or anything else that would be 
useful. You can mail items to the address below. I really appreciate your help!
Sincerely,
Hedy

Alligator Staff Report
In the wake of the low voter turnout in 
Tuesday’s local commission election, three 
commission candidates celebrated their victo-
ries as election officials began to look for ways to increase turnout.
Just under 10,500 votes were cast in the 
commission election, despite the nearly 89,000 voters registered in Alachua County.
“We would have loved to see more voters 
go to the precincts,” said Alachua County Su-pervisor of Elections Kim Barton, adding that there was an increase in early voting and mail-in voting. 
She said she felt the cold weather hindered 
some participation.
Incumbent Helen K. Warren defeated Jenn Powell with 54.63 percent of the vote to hold on to the at large Gainesville City Commission seat while Democrats Harvey Ward Jr. and Da-vid Arreola took the District 2 and District 3 seats, respectively, with sizable majorities. 
Ward Jr. clinched just over half of the 4,455 
votes cast in District 2 over Perry Clawson and Sheryl Eddie while Arreola won 66.4 percent of the vote in District 3 over Craig Carter.Warren, 63, who first won her commission 
seat in 2014, said she never took re-election for granted, and is looking forward to work-ing with housing, homeless issues and juvenile justice. 
“There’s just a lot of things that this com-
munity is ready to do, and I want to continue that momentum,” Warren said at First Magni-tude Brewing Company. She said she wants to stay in touch with her opponent, Powell, be-cause more women are needed in politics.
“We’re going to hold her feet to the fire,” 
Powell said of the loss. “We’ll start Thursday.”
Ward Jr. and Arreola, the two other victors 
in Tuesday’s election, gathered with about 50 supporters in a private room of Blue Gill Qual-ity Foods, at 1310 SW 13th St., to watch the results. 
Ward attributed the win to the supporters 
and volunteers who helped his campaign. He said the members of the campaign knocked on 8,000 doors in District 2 and made 12,000 phone calls.
At 8:31 p.m., Arreola walked into the room, 
apologized to cheering supporters for being late and thanked them for their patience. At 26, Arreola will be the youngest person on the commission.
He said he had monitored the results with 
one of his interns at the democratic office. Af-ter, he went to Holy Faith Catholic Church to talk to his family on the phone and pray.
“I am feeling very grateful and very hum-
bled by what has taken place tonight,” he said. “I did believe that we could win but I did not expect this result.”
As Arreola celebrated, his opponent Craig 
Carter choked back tears as he thanked sup-porters and apologized for not winning re-election.
“God would open doors, and God would 
close doors, and, well, God has closed a door tonight,” Carter said. “And I’m not sure the door God’s going to open, but hold on, cause it’s going to be a doozy.”
He blamed his loss in part on his Republican 
affiliation. He plans on donating all extra cam-paign money to the Bread of the Mighty Food Bank and veteran support group Gainesville Fisher House Foundation.
Jeremiah Tattersall, a field director for 
American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, said there was a re-action from Democrats who felt unhappy with the results of the national election.
“This was a push back,” he said. “This 
wasn’t just a splash in the pan. They’re going to keep voting.”
Republican candidate Perry Clawson ad-
dressed supporters at the Warehouse Res-taurant and Lounge after learning he lost the District 2 race. After he finished speaking, he unclipped his candidate pin from his jacket and quietly put it in his pocket.
“It seems like you just can’t win an election 
in this city unless you have a ‘D’ after your last name,” said Clawson, the only Republican candidate for District 2.
Just a half mile away at The Top restaurant, 
a shocked Sheryl Eddie sipped on a white pinot grigio as she realized she had lost her race.
“I really thought we were going to win, but 
it’s fine,” she said. “At least I get to sleep in tomorrow.” 
Reflecting on her second consecutive run 
for commission office, Eddie said she might come out of retirement to get a part-time job and raise back the $6,000 she took out of her personal travel account for her campaign.
“My life is not over,” Eddie said.Alligator writers Max Chesnes, Romy El-
lenbogen, Meryl Kornfield, Jimena Tavel and Molly Vossler contributed to this reporter.Warren, Democrats celebrate city commission victories

UF wants to know how students really feel 
and its willing to shell out $500 cash prizes for 
insight about the university.
On Monday, UF President Kent Fuchs 
emailed students the Student Experience in 
the Research University survey, released ev-
ery two years. Of those who take the survey, an unknown number of them will win the cash prize.
Noelle Mecoli, the Ofﬁ  ce of Institutional 
Planning and Research’s associate director, said it helps UF know how undergraduates feel about the university.
“One of the good examples that came out 
is Newell Hall,” Mecoli said. “Over 50 percent of the students said they needed additional study space, and so as a direct result of that 
Newell Hall was built.”She said questions ask students about in-
clusivity, academics and how they feel on 
campus. About 25 percent of participants will 
receive questions speciﬁ  c to UF departments, 
like the Career Resource Center and Student Affairs. 
More than 500 people took the survey 
Monday, Mecoli said. She expects 12,000 total to complete the survey, which closes April 20.
The last survey had a 31-percent response 
rate, she said. Mecoli said students selected have received technology such as iPads in the 
past, but this year UF is awarding cash prizes 
from $100 to $500 as a larger incentive. 
Aaron Aguila, a 21-year-old UF wildlife 
ecology and conservation junior, said the cash prizes motivate him more than other prizes to complete the survey. 
“I feel like also with each year there’s a 
new model for tech,” he said. “Money is just more versatile.”UF oﬀ  ers $500 cash prizes

After being pulled over for driving drunk-
enly on the wrong side of a highway, a New-
berry man urinated his pants in front of a po-lice car, Alachua Police said.
Robbie Charles Watson, 55, was driving 
north in the southbound lanes of State Road 25 in Alachua when a police car tried to pull him over at about 12:14 a.m., according to an arrest report. He pulled over in the median before driving off to a Sunco parking lot, at 11921 NW U.S. Highway 441.
An ofﬁ  cer noticed Watson had bloodshot 
eyes and slurred speech, according to the re-port. Watson had also urinated in his pants. 
When ofﬁ  cers asked Watson for docu-
ments, he couldn’t follow directions and gave police the wrong documents multiple times, 
police said. He was unsteady and leaned against his car for support, a responding of-
ﬁ  cer noted. Watson was unable to complete ﬁ  eld sobriety exercises, according to the re-
port. 
After ofﬁ  cers placed him in front of a police 
car, he urinated in his pants again, according 
to the report.
Watson refused to submit to a breathalyzer 
test, and a jail nurse told police he had to be taken to a hospital, police said.
At about 5:50 a.m., Watson was cleared by 
the hospital and brought back to the Alachua 
County Jail, according to the report. When po-
lice asked him to sign a criminal citation, Wat-son refused even after ofﬁ  cers told him refusal would be a misdemeanor.
Police arrested him on charges of driving 
under the inﬂ  uence and refusing to sign a criminal citation. Watson was released from jail on his own recognizance Tuesday morn-ing. He could not be reached for comment.APD: Man drives drunkenly,

Two deaf, Latino drag queens who earned 
internet fame through YouTube will perform 
at UF today.
The 6 p.m. “Deaﬁ  es in Drag” event is a 
part of Deaf Awareness Week, hosted by the 
UF student organization Signing Gators. 
It is the ﬁ  rst time a UF student organiza-
tion has hosted a series of events dedicated to 
the deaf community.
 Later events will include discussion 
panels and American Sign Language perfor-mances from students at universities across Florida, said Devon Mims, the president of Signing Gators.
“It’s important as a hearing person myself 
to realize that ASL is the language of the deaf community,” Mims said.
Drag queens Casavina and Selena will 
perform at the free drag performance, which will be held inside the University Auditorium, Mims said. A discussion panel will follow. 
Mims, a 20-year-old UF zoology junior, 
said teaching others about deaf culture makes 
communication more accessible to those in 
the community, such as increasing access to transcripts or closed-captioned TV. 
There are 40 UF students registered with 
the Disability Resource Center who have 
hearing impairments, wrote UF spokesperson 
Steve Orlando in an email.
Nathanael Herbert, the president of the 
Deaf and Hard of Hearing of Gainesville Area Program nonproﬁ  t, wrote in an email that as someone who is hard of hearing, he’s happy that Signing Gators is bringing attention to the deaf community.
“They will bring the awareness to others 
who don’t know anything about the deaf community,” he said. D eaf drag queens performing at UF for Deaf Awareness Week

Led by strong play from Ingrid Neel and others, the No. 1 Florida women's tennis team bested No. 2 Ohio State on Tuesday. Read the story, pg. 16Former UF receiver Percy Harvin retires, again
Former Gators football player and 2009 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year 
Percy Harvin retired from the league for the second time in less than a year, his agent told ESPN on Tuesday. Harvin is 28 years old. By Patrick Pinak
Sports Writer
Mark Kolozsvary tried to hold himself 
from swinging, but it was too late. 
Florida’s designated hitter had already 
committed to a chest-high Andrew Karp 
fastball. He connected, unsure what the 
outcome would be in a big spot in a score-
less game with two runners on and two outs in the seventh. 
“I was just trying to put a barrel on the 
ball,” Kolozsvary said, “and then it looked like it was more in and I tried to check swing.”
It fell for a bloop single just out of FSU 
shortstop Taylor Walls’ reach, and Jona-
than India raced home. 
In a game that featured 10 total hits, it 
was all the run support No. 5 Florida (13-5) needed in a 1-0 win against No. 2 Flor-
ida State on Tuesday night at McKethan Stadium. 
Considering the Gators had dropped 
their last three midweek contests — one to UCF and two to Florida Gulf Coast — the win felt almost needed for coaches, play-
ers and a worried fan base. 
“It was important for our young  Gators shut out Florida State at home
Staff Report
The most interesting thing Jim 
McElwain said at his press confer-
ence on Tuesday came toward the end. UF’s third-year coach had al-ready been asked about the team’s injuries, its quarterback battle and every other pertinent thing when a question came up about why he liked to use athletes — like receiv-er Dre Massey and true freshman Kadarius Toney — at quarterback. 
He said he picked it up during 
his time at Eastern Washington be-fore launching into a tangent that ended with him telling reporters the Eastern Washington coaching staff is currently visiting Gainesville, staying in his garage and sleeping on inﬂ  at-able beds. 
“You might want to ask them 
about that,” McElwain said. “They’re sleeping in my garage. That’s what you do at that level.”
The staff is 
in Gainesville to watch how the Gators run prac-
tice and learn from them. And if they stick around for a couple days, they’ll be joined on the sideline by 
Florida quarterback Luke Del Rio, who is missing Spring practice due to injury and will have shoulder sur-gery today, McElwain announced, though he wasn’t concerned about Del Rio’s future.
“He’ll be ﬁ  ne,” he said. “It’s not 
major.”
Offensive coordinator Doug Nuss-
meier reiterated as much after prac-tice, saying that even though Del Rio is missing spring practice, he’s still in play to be the team’s Fall starter. Nussmeier added that he feels good about where the team is at with its quarterbacks. 
“(I) feel good about the group,” 
he said, “where we’re at and where we’re headed.”
Shannon’s defensive scheme 
taking shape:
When UF defensive coordinator 
Randy Shannon coached at Miami, he started one game with 28 straight blitzes. Two weeks later, he said he didn’t blitz once the entire game. 
Both Shannon and McElwain em-
phasized the importance of a solid pass rush on Tuesday. 
The coaches said developing pass 
rushing skills on the defensive line will make Florida less reliant on the blitz, putting less pressure on a young secondary. 
“If you’re blitzing and all of a 
sudden you’re not getting there, then your DBs are hanging on the line,” Shannon said.
“If you can get home with four, 
you’ve got it good.”
Since Spring practice started, 
Shannon’s been ﬁ  xated on the game plan, saying it’s too early to judge in-dividual players’ performances. “We’re running around and hav-
ing fun in shorts,” he said. “We’ll know when we start getting in scrim-mage time and pads time.”
Shannon’s been spending his 
time as DC making the defense sim-pler. 
He believes the better the players 
understand, the faster they can play, and the faster they can play, the more mistakes they can cover up. 
Part of that means more defend-
ers will make play calls, coordinating between each other to make adjust-ments on the ﬁ  eld. 
“If everybody’s on the same page 
no matter what we call, we’re all gonna play the same defense,” Shan-non said. “We always said if every-body’s wrong, everybody’s right.”

NOTEBOOKI had been planning a column calling on UF athlet-ics director Scott Stricklin to ﬁ  re women’s basket-ball coach Amanda Butler for weeks. I was waiting until after the season ended — presumably with an early exit in the SEC Tournament — to write it. It 
was actually supposed to run in place of this column, but then it didn't need to. 
“After 10 years, University of Florida women’s bas-
ketball coach Amanda Butler will not return next sea-son,” read the press release posted on FloridaGators.com.
Stricklin’s decision wasn’t surprising given Butler’s 
history. In 10 years at the helm of the program, But-ler’s teams had a tendency to ﬂ  uctuate from halfway decent to poor from season to season, and this season was one of the worst of all. 
The Gators ﬁ  nished 15-16, missing any form of 
postseason play. While this wasn’t the worst record achieved under Butler’s watch, it was especially disap-pointing given the team went 22-9 the season before. 
Much of the drop off can be attributed to the loss 
of two key players: guards Simone Westbrook and El-eanna Christinaki.Firing Butler was 
a tough call, but it 
was the correct oneSWEET AND BAUER / OPINION

Deacon Liput, left, and Andrew Baker pose for a photo after UF's win over Miami on Feb. 25. On Tuesday, Baker earned his ﬁ  rst career win after not allowing any hits in 2 and 2/3 innings pitched during Florida's 1-0 win vs. Florida State. 
SEE COLUMN,  PAGE 15 SEE BASEBALL,  PAGE 15Westbrook tore her ACL before the season 
and left the Gators with a thin bench. Chris -
tinaki, meanwhile, transferred to Maryland. 
The team said the reason was that she refused 
to accept a half-game suspension for a “viola -
tion of team culture,” with Butler saying that 
she “abandoned” her teammates.
Westbrook’s injury obviously can’t be 
blamed on Butler, and Christinaki’s departure 
probably can’t be (at least in full), either. 
It was a bad situation for sure, but Butler 
isn't not the first coach to face injuries. The 
fact remains that Butler produced a losing re -
cord at a place where losing records are unac -
ceptable. 
Looking at UF’s women’s basketball pro -
gram compared to its other programs, the only comparable ones are the men's and women's cross country teams. Like the wom -
en's basketball team, neither were ranked in their sport’s most recent poll — contrary to every other Gators team — and cross country coach Paul Spangler has been at UF half as long as Butler. 
Butler’s time at UF as a whole didn’t pro -
duce much success either, with just four of her 10 teams making the NCAA Tournament and none of them making it past the second round. And in SEC play, the Gators never fin -
ished higher than fourth in the standings un -
der Butler. 
The program just wasn’t relevant on a 
national stage, with the highest ranking achieved in Butler’s 10 years being No. 9 back in 2008-09. And after that season, the Gators weren’t ranked again at all until the 2015-16 season. 
In short, it was time for this to happen. It’s actually surprising that it took this long, even if some of the team’s players were under -
standably upset by the loss of the only coach 
they've known since high school. 
“Speechless…” junior forward Haley Lo -
renzen wrote on Twitter. “words cannot de -
scribe this feeling right now”Emotions from players aside, the team’s 
relative mediocrity over 10 years was more 
than reason enough to doom Butler. So good 
for Scott Stricklin — who, while AD at Missis -
sippi State, hired wildly successful women’s 
basketball coach Vic Schaefer — for doing what needed to be done. WEDNESDAY, MARCH 15, 2017   ALLIGATOR   15

Amanda Butler looks on during UF's win over Georgia on Feb. 26.
pitchers to go out there and do what they 
did,” head coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “Our offense will come around.”
While the bats weren’t impressive for ei-
ther side, the pitching was. 
UF starting pitcher Nate Brown may have 
lasted five innings, but he mowed down the Seminoles in his second career start. 
The freshman right-hander, relying on his 
low-90s fastball, held Florida State to three hits over five scoreless frames while striking out four and walking none. 
“I know that team over there in Florida 
State is really good,” Brown said. “But I knew 
if I just pounded the zone, they’d just get 
themselves out.”
It wasn’t until after Brown was lifted that 
FSU threatened. 
In the sixth, Walls singled up the middle 
and advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt off Kirby McMullen. Then O’Sullivan called on left-handed reliever Andrew Baker, who induced a fly out and a weak chopper to India 
at third base. 
Baker, one of UF’s four freshmen pitchers 
used, didn’t allow a hit through 2 and 2/3 re-
lief innings and earned his first career win. 
“I felt great tonight for some reason,” Baker 
said. “I think it was the big rivalry I’ve heard since I’ve been in high school and middle school. I loved it out there.”
Meanwhile, Florida State (13-4) held Flori-
da at bay behind Andrew Karp’s solid pitching performance, as well. 
Though Karp surrendered the game’s only 
run on Kolozsvary's single, he struck out 11 Gators through seven innings, allowing five hits. 
Eventually, however, the Seminoles were 
no match for Florida’s hard-throwing fresh-men. Tyler Dyson, whose fastball ran as high as 
96 mph, tossed a seamless ninth and earned his first career save. Injury note: UF starting shortstop Dalton 
Guthrie didn’t play against FSU because he’s dealing with arm tenderness. O’Sullivan said he expects Guthrie to be fine but didn’t “want to push him on a night like tonight.”

With the doubles point on the line, Brooke 
Austin ran up the court, turned her arm and 
swung. 
The ball tipped the net and hung in the air 
before bouncing on Ohio State’s court to give 
Florida the doubles point. It was the end of a 
trying opening for the Gators, but things got easier from there. 
In a match between the top two teams in 
the country, Florida and Ohio State played in lockstep before the Gators broke away in sin-gles play to win 4-1 on Tuesday in Orlando. 
The Gators started slow in doubles play. 
Belinda Woolcock and Josie Kuhlman took the ﬁ  rst set for Florida, winning 6-3. 
The other two courts had to battle. Austin and Kourtney Keegan won their 
match against Ohio State’s Francesca Di Lo-renzo and Anna Sanford 7-5 to give the Gators the lead, while Court 2 was tied at ﬁ  ve.
UF coach Roland Thornqvist attributed Florida’s sluggish start to nerves. He said the windy conditions and the fact that ESPN was covering the game may have distracted the 
Gators in the beginning. 
However, Florida came alive in singles 
play. With dominant performances from Ingrid 
Neel, Anna Danilina and Keegan, the Buck-eyes struggled to keep up. Neel was ﬁ  rst off the court for the Gators, beating Gabriella De Santis 6-2, 6-3. Danilina then put Florida up 3-0 after besting Sanford in the second set, win-ning 6-2, 7-5. 
Ohio State’s only point came courtesy of Di 
Lorenzo. The No. 1 player in the nation lived up to her billing as she dominated Woolcock 6-3, 6-1. 
But Keegan put the match away for the 
Gators with a commanding 6-4, 6-2 win over Ferny Angeles Paz. 
Thornqvist said the Gators played well on 
both sides of the ball, which was the underly-
ing factor that gave Florida the win. 
“That makes a difference when you can 
hold on the ball, but also show a little bit of of-fense, too,” he said. “On a few of these courts 
in singles, I thought we were the only team coming in, and maybe that was the difference.”
With the win, the Gators improved to 13-0 
with 10 of those wins against top-25 competi-tion. It was the second time this season that Florida has been involved in a match featur-ing the top two teams in the country. The ﬁ  rst came at the National Indoor Championships when Florida defeated then-No. 2 North Caro-lina.
Thornqvist said a lot of the Gators’ success 
comes from the camaraderie and mindset of the team. He thinks its “Florida-ﬁ  rst” mentality has carried it far this season. 
“They’re in the locker room and they play 
for each other and they play for the shirt. No egos,” he said. “It’s amazing what you can accomplish when you put something greater than yourself ﬁ  rst.”

Sophomore attacker Lindsey Ron-
beck received a pass from senior at-tacker Sammi Burgess while standing behind the net.
Ronbeck had scored the ﬁ  rst hat 
trick of the game nearly three minutes prior and was looking to continue put-ting pressure on Syracuse’s defense.
She ran around the crease and 
ﬁ  red a shot toward Orange goalkeep-er Asa Goldstock, blowing it right by 
her.
It was Ronbeck’s fourth goal of the 
game, and she wasn’t done. 
Behind a career-high six goals from Ronbeck and 
a career-high-ty-ing ﬁ  ve goals from 
junior attacker Shayna Pirreca, the No. 3 Gators (6-1) defeated No. 5 Syracuse (7-2) 19-12 at Donald R. Dizney Stadi-
um on Tuesday afternoon.
“Breakout game for Lindsey, I 
think,” UF coach Amanda O’Leary said. “She just has so much potential, and I think today we saw really what she can do and how dangerous she can be.”
The Gators started the game on a 4-0 run over a 7:10 span. After the run, the closest Syracuse came to catching Florida was a three-goal deﬁ  cit.
Florida scored 13 ﬁ  rst-half goals 
behind four goals from Ronbeck and a hat trick from Pirreca and held the Orange to ﬁ  ve goals.
“I felt really comfortable, relaxed,” 
Ronbeck said. “We watched a lot of ﬁ  lm on their defense, so I felt pretty comfortable.”
While Ronbeck and Pirreca ac-
counted for 11 of Florida’s 19 goals, their teammates chipped in to help extend the Gators’ lead.
Burgess ﬁ  nished with two goals 
and three assists, and senior attacker Mollie Stevens and junior midﬁ  elder Allie Pavinelli each recorded two goals.
In goal, sophomore Haley Hicklen 
stopped 12 Syracuse shots. Her per-formance marked the third time she has made 12 or more saves this sea-son.
Syracuse was led in scoring by 
junior attacker Riley Donahue, who recorded four goals and one assist.
After Ronbeck scored her fourth 
goal of the game, Syracuse made a 
change at goalie, replacing Goldstock 
with sophomore Bri Stahrr. The North Syracuse native changed the pace of the game for the Orange.
Stahrr made eight saves while let-
ting in six second half goals, leading to Syracuse outscoring Florida in the second half, 7-6. 
But it wasn’t enough to push the 
game in favor of the Orange, as the 12 goals Goldstock let up in the ﬁ  rst half were enough for Florida to build a comfortable lead.
“You know, I think they came out 
of the locker room engaged, ready to play,” O’Leary said. “And again, this was a long stretch for us. But I just talked to them about their mental 
toughness, they played through their 
sore bodies and it couldn’t even show out there.”
