After missing out on a bowl 
game last season for the ﬁ  rst time 
since 1990, the Gators became 
bowl eligible again on Saturday.
Florida’s 52-3 win against 
Football Championship Subdivi-
sion opponent Eastern Kentucky 
at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium on 
Senior Day gave UF its sixth win of the season, the threshold re-quired to be eligible to compete in a postseason game.
“It feels great, just a great feel-
ing,” offensive lineman Chaz Green said. “As a senior, that’s something we want to accom-
plish. We didn’t want to walk 
out of here with an upset. We’re fortunate to come out the way we did.”
With the bowl game will come 
a replacement for Will Mus-champ, whose last game as Flor-ida’s head coach will be against Florida State this weekend.
UF announced following the 
Eastern Kentucky game that de-fensive coordinator D.J. Durkin will assume the role of interim head coach during the Gators’ 
bowl game.Durkin is the only member of 
Florida’s coaching staff who was 
at UF prior to the beginning of the Will Muschamp era.
He started his tenure with the 
Gators as the linebackers coach under Urban Meyer in 2010 and 
was promoted to defensive coor-
dinator in 2012 when Dan Quinn left Florida to become the defen-sive coordinator with the Seattle Seahawks.In his ﬁ  rst two years as defen-
sive coordinator (2012 and 2013), Florida ﬁ  nished ﬁ  fth and eighth respectively in total defense. 
The Gators are 11th this sea-
son, surrendering just 311.5 yards 
per game.
And Florida’s defense came 
out in full stride against Eastern 
Kentucky on Saturday, limiting 
the Colonels to just 142 yards of 
total offense and a 26.6-percent third-down conversion rate.
“That was the emphasis this 
week, just to start, come out fast,” 
defensive lineman Darious Cum-
mings said. 
“The last two weeks we started 
out slow, letting up points on our 
ﬁ  rst drive. But Durkin just made 
a point to come out, this team’s an up-tempo team.”
Even with Muschamp’s last 
home game behind him, he said 
he has yet to come to the realiza-
tion that he will only coach the Gators for one more game.
“It’ll hit me when the season is 
over,” he said. 
“I’ve already switched gears 
to next week, that’s just what we 
do.”
And next week — UF’s regular 
season ﬁ  nale against No. 2 FSU 
— could serve as the biggest win VOLUME 109 ISSUE 64 WWW.ALLIGATOR.ORG MONDAY, NOVEMBER 24, 2014

Yik Yak was full of support for Florida State 
University after the shooting in Strozier Library 
early Thursday morning, but Rachel Werk wanted to put faces to the words of kindness.
The UF behavioral and cognitive neurosci-
ence senior formed a demonstration of Florida unity with her friend Alyssa Lowder on Turl-ington Plaza  at 11:30 a.m. Friday.
Werk and UF ﬁ  nance senior Lowder stood 
on the white bench in garnet shirts with #FL-STRONG painted in gold and addressed a crowd of about 200.
“These victims are in all different kinds of 
realms: physically, emotionally, psychologi-
cally,” Werk, 21, said. “It was a tragedy, and it hurts all of us. I want to thank you all for com-
ing out and showing your support.”
Werk read a statement from a friend who 
she said worded it best: “No one is thinking about the football game we’ll be having in a little over a week, or what colors we bleed. At the end of the day, we all bleed red.”
Lowder said the event was created and or-
ganized in fewer than 24 hours, and the Face-book group reached nearly 500 members.

A total of nine people were either 
arrested or ejected at the UF vs. East-
ern Kentucky football game Saturday afternoon — the lowest number of ar-rests and ejections since at least 2010, 
according to available University Po-
lice data.
Of the six ejections, three were UF 
students.
Three non-students were kicked 
out for using a Gator 1 Card, along with one ejection for intoxication, one for ticket switching and one for smok-ing.
All three of the arrests were UF stu-
dents for trespassing after warning.
This was the ﬁ  rst game in the 2014 
football season during which no one was ejected for disorderly conduct. 
The highest number of ejections made 
for disorderly conduct was 28 at the UF vs. Louisiana State University game Oct. 11.
Prior to the game Saturday, the 
lowest number of ejections made for disorderly conduct this year was at the UF vs. Eastern Michigan University game Sept. 6, with only one instance.6 people ejected from game

� A MEZUZAH WAS RIPPED FROM A 
DOOR.
ALEXIA FERNANDEZ
Alligator Staff Writer afernandez@alligator.org
Two UF students experienced anti-Semitism 
prior to last week’s attacks on a Jerusalem syna-
gogue.
UF Hillel Rabbi Adam Grossman sent a mes-
sage to all Hillel members Wednesday condemn-
ing the actions of students who harassed the 
Jewish students in their off-campus homes with comments such as “Get Out Jew.”
“We live in a modernized society, yet this type 
of hate continues to exist in our world, right under our noses,” he said. “Take what happened at Flor-ida State in the library. When our safe spaces are not safe, that to me is the most fearful aspect.”
A UF freshman emailed Grossman two days 
after the incident, where his friend heard pound-ing on his door and people yelling anti-Semitic messages.
Samuel Carbunaru, a UF biomedical engi-
neering freshman, is a friend of the students who heard the messages of hate on Nov. 16.
“My friend’s mezuzah was ripped from his 
door,” the 18-year-old said. “Another friend had a group of people outside his door, knocking on it 
and yelling things that were very anti-Semitic.”
Carbunaru said one of his friends called police. 
Once the student’s friends arrived at the house, 
the group of perpetrators left.
“My friend was afraid to let other people know 
about what had happened,” he said. “But all of his friends told him to let the community know about it.”Grossman said he hopes his message to stu-
dents rings of unity and tolerance.
“When it comes to any intolerance or any op-
pression that we see, how can we not allow it and not accept it moving forward,” he said. 
After four Jewish men were killed in a Jeru-
salem synagogue Tuesday, Hillel held a vigil on Turlington Plaza on Friday.
Abby Newman, a 20-year-old UF elementary 
education and Jewish studies sophomore, said the events in Jerusalem last week terriﬁ  ed her. 
“It was appalling that something like that 
would happen in a place of worship scares and worries me,” she said. “That’s the place where you’re supposed to feel safe.”
When Newman read Grossman’s email, she 
said she once again felt shocked.
“I couldn’t believe that something like that 
had happened at UF,” she said. “I had a friend who had something like this happen to them last Spring at UCF and couldn’t imagine how you would react to something like that.”
Newman is a member of Alpha Epsilon Phi, a 
sorority she said has a reputation for being pri-marily Jewish.
“There’ll be times where I don’t wear my let-
ters or certain times when there are events where 
I won’t go to,” she said. “Generally, I do feel safe 
on campus.”
Grossman said Hillel and UF have been com-
municative about the situation of anti-Semitism.
“Starting with the president working its way 
down to the administration, every one has been very helpful,” he said. “As far as I know, (GPD) has not been able to ﬁ  nd who it was, but they are actively working to seek out the individuals re-
sponsible.”UF Hillel condemns anti-Semitic 
acts on Jewish students in emailpoured out from this university, 
as well as student bodies from FAMU, USF, UCF and UM, to name a few,” the 21-year-old said. “All of this shows me that 
we, as a united Student Body 
all across the state of Florida, will not take this atrocity so lightly.”
Lowder said no college stu-
dents should live in fear for their lives.
“You hear these things on 
the news and never know how 
you’re going to react until it 
happens so close to home,” Lowder said. “I’m proud to say we acted in solidarity, support and love. To my FSU friends, I’m so glad that you’re OK, and if you ever need anything, your 
Gator family is here. One heart, 
one people, one Florida. Florida strong.”
After a moment of silence, 
Werk and Lowder handed out signs that spelled out #FLORI-DASTRONG in gold and then brought the crowd together for a photo.
“It’s beautiful we’re able to 
put aside petty rivalry,” said Cesia Salan, an 18-year-old UF microbiology and cell science freshman, whose best friend of 14 years attends FSU.
Werk said the quick student 
response was great and shows how important it is to be sup-portive.
“It instills a faith in human-
ity,” she said.4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, NOVEMBER 24, 2014

Gainesville Police arrested a

because there was no beer in the 
refrigerator Saturday night.     
Linda Lee Solis-Rivera and 
Edward Harty began arguing be-
fore Solis-Rivera started swing-
ing at Harty shortly after 8 p.m. Harty said he grabbed Solis-Rive-ra’s hands while trying to defend himself but lost his balance.The two then fell to the ground, 
according to a report.
Police said 55-year-old Solis-
Rivera then started stabbing 
Harty on the head with a pair of 
keys at his home, located at 3015 SW 41st Lane.
Harty had five or six puncture 
wounds on his head, which were bleeding when officers arrived. He also had cuts and numerous black and blue lumps on his head. Emergency Medical Services re-
sponded, but Harty did not need to be hospitalized.
Solis-Rivera told police she 
and Harty were drinking beer 
and grilling food before the fight, which Harty said started because there was no more beer in the 
fridge.  
Solis-Rivera was arrested on 
charges of aggravated battery. 
She is currently being held on a $25,000 bond.

The future of Gainesville’s retail land-
scape is one step closer to completion.
Butler Enterprises broke ground on But-
ler North early Friday morning — a proj-
ect that expects to bring more than 1,500 
construction jobs to the city.
The $186-million shopping complex ex-
pansion will also create more than 3,500 retail jobs once its sites are open, wrote Kristin Mamula, a Butler Enterprises spokeswoman, in an email.  
The sites are expected to have a direct 
economic impact of $300 million annually.
“That helps us retain people in the re-
gion,” said Susan Davenport, vice presi-dent of economic development for the Gainesville Area Chamber of Commerce. “This is something that everyone that vis-
its Gainesville would like to see here.”
Butler Enterprises hired Gainesville-
based O’Steen Brothers to clear the land 
and do the expansion’s earthwork, accord-
ing to a press release. Ocala-based Hamlet 
Construction did the underground con-struction, including sewage and storm wa-ter drainage.
Most of what will be Butler North has been cleared for construction, but Mamula 
said both Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club sites 
have not yet been cleared.
Davenport said the projects, along with multi-use project Celebration Pointe — 
slated for a fall 2016 opening –— contrib-
ute to the chamber’s five-year economic development strategy to improve Gaines-ville’s business culture.
She said the new opportunities for 
employment and investment will make people “want to live here and make this a higher quality of life for people that live 
here.”
About 300 people attended the shop-
ping complex’s expansion celebration 
Friday, hosted in an open field overlook-ing the Butler North site. When complete, 
Southwest 24th Avenue will border the 
property to the north, while 34th Street will border the east, Interstate Highway 75 to the west and Archer Road to the south.
As Butler North nears completion, con-
struction on an open-air shopping cen-ter called Butler Town Center will begin. Combined with Butler North, the center will add more than 1 million square feet of 
retail and commercial space to the existing 
plaza, Mamula said.
Construction on the complex is slated to 
begin in March and be completed by 2016.
“It is really something that will add 
such a beautiful dimension to Gainesville’s growing economy,” Davenport said. “We could not be happier. It’s a great opportu-nity for us.”Butler North construction to create thousands of local jobs

A new cafe boasting healthy 
options is adding to the hype over 
Heavener Hall.
Rising Roll will be open for 
business starting Jan. 6, in time for 
the start of the Spring semester.
The cafe will be on the first floor 
of the building, located on the cor-
ner of West University Avenue and Southwest 13th Street, where there is no on-campus eatery.
Brian Ray, associate dean and 
director of the Heavener School of Business, said the quality of food 
was important to the faculty, staff 
and students who chose Rising Roll from three other franchises.
“Rising Roll was far away the 
best choice among the students and staff,” Ray said.Gator Dining Marketing pro-
gram manager Jill Rodriguez said the menu will include gourmet sandwiches, wraps, soups and sal-
ads, as well as breakfast burritos 
and coffee.
“Other people have compared it 
to Panera Bread,” Rodriguez wrote in an email.
All of Rising Roll’s entrees are 
made from scratch, she said. There is no fried food, and no preserva-tives are added. There will also be vegan options and gluten-reduced wraps.
Most items range from $2 to $7.Ray said students were look-
ing for something on the healthier 
side.Brandon Harris, a UF busi-
ness administration junior, said 
he sampled Rising Roll’s menu at the Heavener Hall dedication cer-
emony Nov. 14.  After catching a 
glimpse of it, Harris said the cafe will be an alternative to Chipo-tle and Firehouse Subs, the closest restaurants to the business college.
“I think the healthier options 
offered by Rising Roll are great,” the 20-year-old said. “Oftentimes, they taste better and you feel better 
after eating fresh food.”
Ray said the idea behind open-
ing the restaurant was to provide 
a facility for students to eat break-fast, lunch and dinner in between classes and organization meetings.
The cafe will be open 8 a.m. to 
7 p.m. Monday through Thursday and from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Friday.
“There’s really nothing exactly 
like this on campus right now,” Harris said. “I think it will be a wonderful addition.”Rising Roll cafe to open in HeavenerBoth still held on bond

LOS ANGELES  — Once lawyers be-
gan digging into Mark Berndt’s past, they 
discovered a three-decade pattern of odd 
behavior and complaints about the teacher that school administrators either missed or ignored.
Both students and teachers had com-
plained about the popular elementary school teacher who was eventually con-victed of committing numerous lewd acts 
on his students.
On Friday, the Los Angeles Unified 
School District announced it agreed to pay 
nearly $140 million to put an end to litiga-
tion involving the teacher, who had been 
accused of blindfolding students and feed-ing them his semen on spoons and cook-ies.The settlement involving 81 students is 
believed to be the largest ever for a school sex abuse case, according to victims’ law-yers and increases the public price of the scandal to $170 million when combined 
with 65 cases settled earlier for $30 mil-
lion.
The deal ends a legal saga that began 
when the Miramonte Elementary School teacher was arrested in 2012 on allegations 
of committing lewd acts.
“There was a volcano of evidence,” 
attorney John Manly said. “The district 
settled this case because there (was) a gun pointed at their head, a legal gun, and it 
was about to go off, and the public was go-
ing to find out everything.”Classroom sex abuse case to cost nearly $140M settlement

Ethan Pelletier was 5 when 
he broke out of his mother’s 
hand hold and almost got hit by a car in a parking lot about a year ago.
Diagnosed with autism at 3 
years old, he tends to wander away from his parents, but at the Autism Safety and Aware-ness Day event Saturday, his mother didn’t have to worry. Ashley and Michael Pelletier, both 25, learned about ways to keep Ethan safe at the event held at Kiwanis Safety City at 1025 NE 13th St.
About 14 families attended 
the event hosted by the UF Center for Autism and Related Disabilities, which provided information about water and fire safety, along with wander-ing prevention strategies for families with people with au-tism spectrum disorder.
Participating organiza-
tions included Gainesville Po-lice, Gainesville Fire Rescue, TRiLOC, Noah’s Endeavor Inc. and Let’s Go 4 Kids.
The event was inspired 
by tragedies in North Central Florida, such as a boy who wandered away from home, got lost and drowned, said Gregory Valcante, the director of UF’s Center for Autism and Related Disabilities.
Ashley said the fenced-in 
venue provided a safe envi-ronment for her son.

Ott told families about the 
alternatives to regular smoke alarms, including alarms that can record a parent’s voice. Parents can also record direc-tions for the child to go to a specific meeting place by using  the alarms.
“I really feel like it’s one of

University Police hired about 40 on-call employees to 
participate in the Walk Safe program after transitioning 
to a paid staff.  
The campus safety service, providing students with 
point-to-point walking escorts, has shifted from student 
volunteers to an established staff hired by the police de-
partment. The on-call employees work two days a week and earn $8.50 per hour.
The funding for the Walk Safe program is provided 
through the Office of Vice President for Business Affairs, UPD spokesman Maj. Brad Barber said.
The program was implemented immediately after 
battery attacks on campus and off campus, said UPD Officer Wayne Clark. Before being hired, employees are 
thoroughly screened to ensure the safety of students.
Barber said UPD created the Walk Safe program in 
lieu of the state’s mandate on the number of officers po-
lice departments are allowed to hire. In addition to Walk Safe, more officers have been shifted to the night shift to provide a greater level of staffing during evening hours. This shift helps provide more coverage at night, when past incidents have occurred, Barber said.
“Educational outreach doesn’t start just because an 
incident happened and doesn’t end because it has been quite some time since the incident occurred,” he said.UPD hires 40 students for Walk Safe

day morning after responding to a house fire.
The Sheriff’s Office, Tallahassee 
Police and Tallahassee Fire Depart-ment arrived at 3722 Caracus Court shortly after 10 a.m., according to a press release.
Upon arrival, the suspect — whose name has not been released by police — ambushed the deputies. The gunman shot and killed one of 
them immediately. He then turned 
the gun on a second deputy, but the shot was not fatal.
The suspect then grabbed the 
killed deputy’s gun and started walking up the street, shooting at the firefighters and other respond-ers, according to the release.

Florida campaign 
ﬁ  nance needs
ﬁ  xing
On most political issues — the economy, health care and 
climate change — Americans are more polarized than ever before. However, there is at least one subject on 
which the vast majority of Americans agree: the enormous and inappropriate role that money plays in American elections.
A CBS poll found that 71 percent of Americans support limits 
on individual contributions to campaigns, and 76 percent sup-port limits on spending from outside groups. These numbers included Democrats, Republicans and Independents.
One of the most popular attempts to limit the inﬂ  uence of 
money at the state level has been the creation of “matching funds” programs. Florida has such a program, in which any money a candidate raises from a contribution of $250 or less is matched by a contribution of tax dollars to the candidate’s cam-
paign. In exchange, the candidates must agree to limit their total 
campaign spending, although the limits are set fairly high.
Unfortunately, the recent elections in Florida demonstrate 
some severe ﬂ  aws in the matching funds program.
Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam and Chief 
Financial Ofﬁ  cer Jeff Atwater both ran essentially unopposed. Adam Smith at the Tampa Bay Times wrote that “their… oppo-nents, Thaddeus Hamilton and William Rankin, were no-name Democrats with virtually no money and even less support from 
the state Democratic party.”
Putnam and Atwater cruised to re-election and faced oppo-
nents who did not even qualify for matching funds because of 
how few private contributions they received. Despite the lopsid-ed nature of these elections, the two incumbents each collected more than $400,000 in public matching funds.
They both used these funds to run self-serving political ads 
portraying themselves as dedicated stewards of the public trust. The irony of wasting taxpayer dollars to communicate a mes-
sage of being accountable to Florida taxpayers was apparently 
lost on both candidates.
Smith noted that both Putnam and Atwater are seen as prime 
candidates for the Florida governor’s race in 2018. The matching funds system provided them both with a way to bolster their public image and name recognition at the taxpayer’s expense.
Atwater’s behavior in spending this money is particularly 
troubling. Floridians re-elected a CFO who apparently has no qualms about spending tens of thousands of taxpayer dollars on 
needless political advertising.
An ideal campaign ﬁ  nance system would eliminate private 
contributions and provide each candidate with an equal and 
strictly limited amount of public funding. Such a system would both reverse the explosion of election spending and ensure that opposing candidates operate on a truly level playing ﬁ  eld.
Candidates should be elected on the strength of their ideas, 
not on their ability to raise vast sums of money. Until more sig-niﬁ  cant reforms are made to the funding of American elections, 
candidates will continue to prioritize fundraising over address-
ing the issues that affect their constituents.

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgFriday’s question: Do you know anyone 
at FSU?Today’s question: Do you have class Tuesday?More mental health care, less gun glory
The shooting that took place on Florida State Univer-
sity’s campus Thursday has hit all of us at UF hard. Because FSU is only about 200 miles away from us, 
I assume we have all realized that Strozier Library could have easily been Smathers Library.
I’ve been moved by the empathy and sympathy our 
community has generated through the way of hashtags like #FSUnited. I want to commend our Student Body and faculty for the support we’ve shown to FSU in this rough time.
But I want us all to care about more than just show-
ing solidarity for others when these tragic events occur. We should be thinking about what can be done to prevent these tragic events from happening again, especially with 
the frequency that they’ve been happening at in recent 
years.
My favorite satirical piece ever published by The On-
ion is one titled “’No Way To Prevent This,’ Says Only Na-tion Where This Regularly Happens.” It pokes fun at how our society voices sentiments of grief whenever shooting sprees happen, even though we are the only developed nation where this sort of thing happens on a fairly regular basis.
The Hufﬁ  ngton Post reports that since the Sandy Hook 
Elementary shooting in 2012, there has been an average 1.37 school shootings each week school is in session. This statistic is terrifying, and yet our nation has still failed to initiate gun reform.
A lot of people would say that these school shootings 
are issues of mental or emotional health and access to health care, not an issue of lax gun control. Myron May, the FSU gunman, was reported by the Miami Herald to 
have been showing symptoms that would indicate mental 
illness. He believed he was under surveillance and heard voices in his head, according to those who knew him well in his last few weeks of life. 
My friend Ryan Baum posited a very important ques-
tion on his Facebook status following the incident: Why did May have access to a gun but not the help he needed?
It needs to be understood that when tragedies like these strike, it’s not a binary issue of ei-ther gun reform or mental health reform. It’s about both.
In this country, we have cre-
ated a gun culture that gloriﬁ  es 
ﬁ  rearms. Guns ﬂ  ood our mov-
ies and television shows. How many people interpret the Sec-ond Amendment — which is outdated, anyway — in a way 
that leads to the idea that everyone should own a gun, as if guns solve all problems? If you fear someone attacking you with a gun, many would tell you that the solution would be to have your own gun, and be prepared to de-
fend yourself. The process by which guns are obtained is 
so lax, people who really should not own guns still access them.
At the same time, we have also created a stigma in this 
country surrounding mental illness. People struggling with mental illness often don’t have resources for help available to them, cannot afford the resources if available or refuse to reach out for help because they’re afraid of how they will be perceived by others.
It’s great that when tragedies occur involving gun vio-
lence, we can all band together, support each other and push forward. But I’m tired of seeing gun tragedies hap-pen. We need to abandon the idea that there is nothing our society can do to end this pandemic because that’s a false claim.
As a society, we all need to rethink the ways we con-
ceptualize and address mental illness.
We also need to rethink the importance we place on 
guns. What should we value more: easy access to guns, or the life of every future victim affected by gun violence?
Once we do those things, maybe we can stop fearing 
that the next school shooting will take place at our univer-sity, our brother’s high school or our sister’s elementary school.

Last week, by a margin of one vote, the U.S. 
Senate rejected a bill to allow the Keystone XL pipeline to cross the Canada-U.S. border 
and bring tar sands oil in Canada to refineries in Texas. 
I am an environmentalist and firmly believe that 
this was the wrong decision.
I do not believe this because the pipeline would 
create more jobs: In fact, the pipeline would cre-ate only 35 permanent jobs after the construction’s completion next year, and those would last only as long as the tar sands, unlike the thousands of jobs 
potentially jeopardized by the threat of spills in the 
farming corridor it would cross and the fisheries that would see an increase in tanker traffic on the Gulf of Mexico.
I do not believe the pipeline should have been 
approved because I want cheaper gas prices. The tar sands oil is intended for intercontinental markets, and not one drop would have made it to American gas pumps.
I do not believe this because I think the fumiga-
tion of the atmosphere by carbon stored in Alberta would not contribute significantly to global climate change, or that global climate change is insignifi-
cant to the world at large.
I think that climate change is the greatest single 
threat to the sustenance of our ecosystems and the 
stability of our civilization. I would very much pre-fer to see every drop of oil currently in the ground 
to remain there.
I support the creation of the Keystone XL pipe-
line because I believe the choice we are being pre-
sented with — preventing the pipeline’s construc-tion and keeping the tar sands in the ground versus supporting the project and crossing the point of no 
return to a hothouse world — is a false one.
The tar sands are being and will continue to be 
mined, regardless of the XL’s construction. At the 
moment, crude oil is being shipped to refineries by 
truck.
 One could make the argument that this inef-
ficient step in the supply chain raises the ultimate fuel price and thus reduces the profitability of this, 
as I see it, rogue industry. 
However, a pipeline will be built regardless. 
However bad the XL may be, the alternative is much, much worse.
If constructed, Canada’s Enbridge Northern 
Gateway Pipelines would cross west to the Pacif-ic through the province of British Columbia and Great Bear Rainforest, an enormous, intact, old growth forest that exists on a scale 
greater than anything left in 
the contiguous U.S.
The pipelines would end at Kitimat, a port situ-
ated at the end of a chain of long, pristine and diffi-
cult-to-navigate fjords. 
Kitimat is currently home to orcas and bears, but 
if the Enbridge pipelines are built, the port would 
likely feature Chinese tanker traffic and oil spills instead.
Perhaps efforts of Canadian activists to block 
the Enbridge pipeline will succeed, even with the increase in pressure likely to be felt with the Key-stone’s rejection.
I find that unlikely with their current govern-
ment, which has no regard for environmental pro-tection and sustainability, but it is a possibility.
Perhaps, even with control of both the U.S. 
House and Senate, Republicans will fail to revisit 
and approve the pipeline. 
They don’t have the majority to override a presi-
dential veto right now, but most of the current Con-
gress will likely still be in office in two years, and 
no one can predict if the new president will even 
publicly profess a belief in global warming after that point.
It seems unlikely to me that we will even prevent 
the XL’s construction forever. 
By rejecting it, Democrats have bet high and re-
linquished leverage that could have lowered the stakes in this entire affair.
Rather than rejecting Keystone XL outright, 
Democrats should have approved its construction, with high safety standards and a tax attached that would charge most of the difference between cur-rent expense per barrel and that of the pipeline oil. This tax would not affect American gas prices.
However, it would reduce the cost effectiveness 
of the nearly inevitable pipeline, thus reducing car-bon emissions globally and providing a compromise that would be harder for conservatives to overturn. 
These funds could be allocated to rainforest 
conservation, carbon sequestration or research and subsidies for renewable energy sources.
Even when the fate of the world is at stake, 
sometimes all or nothing is not the best strategy. As 
much as it pains me to say it, I think that in this 
case, we have to compromise.

The glorious day of 
Thanksgiving is almost upon us. Nothing tops 
dedicating a whole day to eat-ing platefuls of food, drinking wine and watching football. Thanksgiving is a timeless hol-iday where we take a moment to slow down, be with the people we love and be thank-ful for everything we have. Unfortunately, some people are not thankful for what they have. They just want more, which in turn, has cast a dark shadow over Thanksgiving, rendering it less meaningful. This shadow is caused by none other than the dreadful day af-ter Turkey Day: Black Friday.
Over the years, the value 
that has been placed on Black Friday has increased expo-nentially as more people are 
looking to get a great deal or 
bargain for their Christmas presents. How can people re-sist when companies like Wal-Mart are offering 50-inch LED HD Televisions for $218, HP Touch Laptops for $249 and RCA Google Play Wi-Fi Tab-lets for an astonishingly low $29? You’d be considered in-sane not to want to try to get great prices on items like these. But this “insanity” has done a 180, and the obsession with Black Friday has led to unin-tended consequences.
We are so infatuated with 
Black Friday that some people have already been camping outside retailers to ensure they are the first one in the store to snag that incredible deal. As most of you are probably aware, when retailers offer such a great price on a prod-uct, they don’t have an unlim-ited quantity of that item. And if you’re not the first one in the store, chances are your oppor-tunity will be blown. That’s why some people, like Derek De Armond in Fort Meyers, have already begun camping outside a Best Buy. De Ar-mond set up his tent Nov. 11 at 10 a.m. and is rotating shifts with friends to keep his spot in line.
How have we gotten to the 
point where we are camping outside stores to buy things? As Americans, we have al-lowed ourselves to become so self-absorbed, priding our-selves on our material posses-sions because we think it adds value to who we are as people. If we don’t have the latest iP-hone, the newest laptop or the updated tablet, we feel obso-lete and inferior. Black Fri-day has only exacerbated this learned condition, and at the same time, putting Thanksgiv-ing in the background.
This is only the tip of the ice-
berg. Many more serious prob-lems come with Black Friday. Retailers love Black Friday, as they should: Last year, people spent $57.4 billion on Black Friday alone. While this boost to the economy is welcome, we sacrifice a lot for it, including the safety of others.
In 2011, a man collapsed at 
a Black Friday event at a Target in West Virginia, unnoticed by staff or shoppers. Some people even stepped over his body to continue their shopping. He later died at the hospital.
In 2008, at a Wal-Mart in 
New York, a man was killed 
by an out-of-control mob that 
broke the doors off its hinges to get inside. He was trampled to death by more than 200 crazy shoppers. At the same store, four others were injured, including a woman who was eight months pregnant.
As of 2013, 90 people have 
been injured because of Black Friday, and seven have died.
Yet the madness continues 
because who cares about the well-being of our fellow man when you can get a $200 iPad? We’ve allowed our society to prioritize materialism over public safety, and it’s a trend that doesn’t concern most peo-ple. According to the National Retail Federation, more than 140 million people will shop this Thanksgiving weekend, which gives stores like Wal-Mart, Target, Sears and others all the motivation they need to open at 6 p.m. Thanksgiv-ing Day. Additionally, Kmart seems to have no regard for its employees at all, as its stores will be open at 6 a.m. on Thanksgiving.
Don’t give into the lunacy 
that is Black Friday. If we de-mand it as a society, corpora-tions will supply it. If you real-ly want to help a local patron, maybe consider participating in Small Business Saturday this weekend. Let’s refocus and not forget about Thanksgiving, which is supposed to be about family and friends, not televi-sions and tablets.

UF researchers say people 
are happier when they have choices, and animals are, too.
UF psychology doctoral 
candidate Lindsay Mehrkam collaborated with UF psychol-ogy professor Nicole Dorey to conduct a series of prefer-ence tests to determine what 
makes certain animals happi-
est in a zoo environment.
Their research on Galapa-
gos tortoises was published 
in the Zoo Biology journal 
this year.
Preference tests are con-
ducted by putting two or more options in front of someone 
to determine what the subject 
really wants. Mehrkam said preference tests are usually used on humans, especially 
for children with disabilities.
“We thought it would be 
kind of cool to see if we could 
put that methodology with animals,” Dorey said.
Mehrkam said zookeepers 
promote creating behavioral opportunities that animals would get in the wild, such as scattering food to imitate foraging, a strategy known as 
enrichment.
“I think there’s a big push 
to increase choice or improve 
an animal’s choice in their en-
vironment,” she said.In the six-day experiment, 
tortoises Larry, Moe and Curly were given a series of 
two options, varying among a ball, sprinklers, a neck rub and a shell scrub.
For one version of the test, 
tortoises had the option to ei-ther walk to a ball or to a zoo-keeper for a neck rub.
Every time the tortoises 
had the option of human in-teraction, they took it.  
In a second study, the two 
researchers also conducted preference tests with other 
animals, including bullfrogs, 
a snake and a tarantula, al-though the tarantula didn’t get the option of human in-
teraction.
“We found that for the 
majority of the species, the 
preference assessments were really effective,” Mehrkam 
said.
In the second study, the 
researchers also asked zoo-
keepers to fill out a survey 
about what their animals 
liked the most.
Mehrkam said the zoo-
keepers were accurate in predicting what the animals 
didn’t like, but not in what 
the animals liked the most.
This means zookeepers 
can rely on preference tests 
instead of intuition, Mehrkam 
said.
“I hope to see other zoos 
and scientists in zoos repeat this study,” she said.8, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, NOVEMBER 24, 2014

WASHINGTON  — President Barack 
Obama’s carefully cultivated Hispanic co-
alition was starting to splinter.
Immigration legislation on Capitol Hill 
was going nowhere. Deportations were 
nearing 2 million under Obama’s watch. 
And the president was resisting calls to use executive actions to address the issue.
In early March, Obama’s usually reli-
able supporters vented their frustration with a one-two punch to the White House: a scathing speech by a prominent immigra-tion advocate who derided the president as “deporter in chief,” then a threat from 
Hispanic lawmakers to vote on a resolution 
criticizing Obama for the soaring deporta-tions.
The moves sent the White House scram-
bling. Hours before the vote, Obama sum-moned three of the lawmakers to the Oval Office to tell them he was ordering Home-land Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to study how the administration could enforce im-
migration laws “more humanely.”
That order set off near-
ly nine months of intense 
internal deliberations 
over the scope of Obama’s presidential powers and political wrangling be-tween the White House and Democrats over how 
potentially provocative 
executive actions would 
impact the midterm elections.
Obama would ultimately wait until af-
ter the election to announce his decisions, unveiling sweeping measures Thursday to spare nearly 5 million people in the U.S. il-legally from deportation.This account of how the president 
reached that decision is based on roughly two dozen interviews with lawmakers, ad-
ministration officials, congressional aides 
and immigration advocates. 
Some spoke on the condition of anonym-
ity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations with the president and his top advisers.
Even as Obama raised the prospect of 
executive actions, he was holding out hope that Congress would still pass broader 
legislation. The Senate had passed a wide-
ranging bill in June 2013 with bipartisan support, but the measure languished in the Republican-controlled House.
For months, Obama and House Speak-
er John Boehner talked privately about whether the House might take up immigra-tion. Boehner suggested there was a narrow window of opportunity in early summer, 
after most Republican lawmakers were 
past their primaries.
Obama was willing to accept that time-
line, but administration officials said he was skeptical that it was just the latest in what he saw as Boehner’s stalling tactics.
A small handful of House Republican 
supporters of immigration reform, includ-ing Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida and Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, were indeed work-ing on legislative options.
But they struggled not only to get buy-in 
from reluctant Republicans, but also atten-tion from a dubious White House.
Any last hopes for a legislative break-
through were derailed the night of June 10, 
when Rep. Eric Cantor, the Republican ma-
jority leader from Virginia, suffered a stun-ning primary defeat.
Little-known challenger David Brat, 
an opponent of immigration reform, used Cantor’s tepid support for immigration leg-islation against him, making other Repub-licans fearful of taking on the issue before the elections.
“That was the moment we realized im-
migration reform was dead, and we had to focus on Obama,” said Kica Matos, a prom-inent immigration advocate.

The Sunshine State means busi-
ness.
Florida’s business climate ranked 
first among the nation’s most popu-
lous states and fifth overall in a re-
cent study by the Tax Foundation, 
the State Business Tax Climate In-dex.
The nonpartisan tax research 
group evaluated the states’ tax cli-mates based on their taxes, includ-ing corporate, individual income, sales, unemployment insurance and property.
“I’m not surprised that they 
would say that,” said Bill Rossi, a UF entrepreneurship professor. “Florida does not have a personal income tax, and therefore, it is a more economi-cal climate for employees of firms to live and work.”
Florida’s individual income tax 
rates ranked first in the nation, and its unemployment insurance ranked third. Rossi said Florida also ranked high because the tax raise that state businesses are subject to is more fa-vorable than those in other areas of the country.
“A lot of things that comprise 
one’s budget tend to be a little lower 
priced in Florida,” he said, “and 
when you couple that with the fact that we don’t have an income tax, it’s a pretty good place to live and work.”
Gainesville has exemplified Flor-
ida’s thriving business climate, Rossi said. Entrepreneurship is alive and well in the city, thanks to recent UF 
graduates founding local companies 
like Grooveshark and Fracture.Fracture, a local glass-printing 
image company, has seen a 70-per-cent increase in state sales over the last year, according to chief market-
ing officer Herb Jones. The business 
was founded by two UF alumni in 2009.
“Florida definitely has excelled in 
creating a very business-friendly en-vironment, and the overall economic conditions of the country have ben-efitted Fracture,” Jones said. “We’re a company that’s highly dependent

� STUDY ALSO SHOWS 
LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF OVERHUNTING. 
TENLEY ROSS
Alligator Contributing Writer 
UF researchers have dis-
covered that small mammals 
are vital to sustaining seed 
dispersal and the survival of 
tropical ecosystems.
The researchers are the first 
to quantify the long-term ef-
fects overhunting has on the 
entire life cycle of tropical tree Miliusa horsfieldii in Thai-land. They found that the risk of this species’ extinction will 
increase by more than 10 times 
over the course of a century 
because of overhunting.
The UF-led study, pub-
lished in the Proceedings of 
the Royal Society B earlier this month, was completed in col-
laboration with the Conserva-
tion Ecology Program in Thai-land, the Royal Thai Forest Department and Wageningen University in the Netherlands.
After eating the trees’ fruits, 
animals disperse the seeds in different locations, which helps to avoid tree crowding, a general phenomenon that could affect other trees. 
Without animal seed dis-
persers, an entire tree popula-tion could collapse, said Jer-emy Lichstein, a UF assistant 
biology professor and one of 
the study’s authors. 
Even if the plants live 
within 10 to 20 meters of each other, the research shows that 
trees of all stages are less likely 
to grow and survive.
Lichstein said one reason for the low survival rates is that some insects carry diseas-es to attack certain plant spe-
cies, and if the same trees are 
close together, pathogens can easily spread.
“It’s like getting sick,” he 
said. “If you live by yourself, 
you’re less likely to get com-
municable diseases. The same thing happens to trees.”
If a seed falls right below 
its parent tree, it is crowded not only by the original tree, but also by all the other fallen seedlings, said Trevor Caugh-lin, a UF postdoctoral student 
and National Science Founda-
tion Fellow.
Crowding can prevent the 
seeds from germinating as 
well.
With overhunting causing 
animals to become extinct in 
tropical forests worldwide, the researchers studied how 
Miliusa Horsfieldii was af-
fected.
Caughlin said he hopes the 
Gainesville community will 
become aware of the conser-
vation issue to stop the de-mand and trade of wildlife that causes these potentially catastrophic effects.
“There should be more ac-
tion to regulate and curb over-hunting,” he said.
Manny Rutinel, a UF mi-
crobiology and cell science and economics junior, said Gainesville can raise aware-ness of the issue by contacting local policy makers.
“We’re learning every day 
how sensitive these ecosys-tems are to human interac-tions and we are truly overex-
ploiting areas in ways never 
before,” Rutinel, 19, said. Study: tropical tree

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — The

sultants and political operatives in drawing up new legislative and congressional districts has been 
spelled out in hundreds of pages 
of emails that have been revealed.
The documents were supposed 
to be unsealed Dec. 1 by the Flori-da Supreme Court, but they were obtained by media organizations, including The Associated Press, on Sunday.
The contents of the documents 
were first published by the Scripps-Tribune Capital Bureau.A judge this summer ruled the 
GOP-controlled Legislature vio-lated a voter-approved law that 
congressional districts cannot be 
drawn to favor incumbents or the member of any political party.
Judge Terry Lewis cited the 
documents, which were still under seal at the time, as one reason for his ruling.
Legislative leaders maintained 
during the trial that outside con-
sultants played no role in drawing 
districts that eventually were ad-opted by legislators.
But the documents spell out 
how Pat Bainter and his Gaines-ville-based firm Data Targeting Inc., as well as other consultants, worked on maps to help incum-bents make sure minorities were in certain districts.
For example, one email called 
for drawing up a district to help State Sen. John Thrasher since “he actually lives in Clay County.” Thrasher, who recently resigned 
from the Senate to become Florida State University president, had a 
district that did not include Clay County.
The emails show the lengths 
the consultants undertook to make sure their plans would not show up in any public records.
“Just to ease your minds, I have 
tried to do most of the asking over the phone, so their (sic) is no e-mail trail if it gets forwarded,” wrote consultant Jessica Corbett to Data 
Targeting employees, adding later, 
“I have stressed discretion to all.”
The emails also outline a strat-
egy to recruit people to submit maps publicly that were identical to the ones they were drawing up.
During the trial over the con-gressional maps last May, a Re-publican Party official testified that congressional maps he drew and 
turned over to a GOP consultant 
were identical to those submitted to the Legislature back in 2012 by Alex Posada.
It was during that trial, howev-
er, that Posada, a former FSU stu-dent and member of that school’s College Republicans, denied in a deposition that he ever submitted 
those maps.
The documents also contradict 
Bainter’s own initial deposition 
where he contended that he was not actively involved in redistrict-ing and had an “after the fact inter-est.”
Emails reveal Florida GOP consultant roles in map drawing� HE WAS 78.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
WASHINGTON — A contro-
versial and tireless advocate for the 
nation’s capital who created jobs for generations of black families, Mari-on Barry was the ultimate District 
of Columbia politician, though his 
arrest for drug use in the midst of a crack cocaine epidemic often over-shadows his accomplishments.
The former four-term mayor will 
long be remembered for one night in 1990 when he was caught on video lighting a crack pipe in an FBI sting operation. In an instant, the then-mayor was exposed as a drug user.
Barry, 78, died Sunday at the 
United Medical Center, after having 
been released from a hospital a day 
earlier. His spokeswoman, LaToya Foster, said he collapsed outside his home.
Barry first made a name for him-
self in the South as a leader in the civil rights movement and brought his fierce advocacy to D.C. to sup-port the fight in freeing the city to manage its own affairs, not Con-gress. That legacy was remembered Sunday at the White House upon news of Barry’s death.
“Marion was born a sharecrop-
per’s son, came of age during the 
civil rights move-ment and became a fixture in D.C. politics for de-cades,” President Barack Obama said. “During his decades in elected 
office in D.C., he put in place historic 
programs to lift working people out 
of poverty, expand opportunity and begin to make real the promise of home rule.”
Barry was born March 6, 1936, to 
Marion and Mattie Barry, in Missis-sippi and was raised in Memphis, Tennessee, after the death of his fa-ther, a sharecropper.
Barry’s work in the civil rights 
movement brought him to Wash-ington. He was elected to city coun-cil in 1974. Four years later, Barry defeated incumbent Mayor Walter Washington in the Democratic pri-mary and went on to easily win the general election.
Barry’s early years in office were 
marked by improvement in city services and a dramatic expansion 
of the government payroll, creat-
ing a thriving black middle class in the nation’s capital. He established a summer jobs program that gave many young people their first work experience and earned him political capital.
The city’s drug-fueled decline in 
the 1980s and 90s mirrored Barry’s 
battles with his personal demons, 
leading to the infamous hotel room arrest Jan. 19, 1990. A video of the arrest, which showed him smoking crack cocaine, was widely distrib-uted to the media and made him infamous worldwide.
“B***h set me up,” Barry famous-
ly cursed when FBI agents burst in, 
referring to the woman who helped 
the FBI set up the sting.
Former DC Mayor Marion Barry dies
“Just to ease your minds, 
I have tried to do most of 
the asking over the phone, 
so their (sic) is no e-mail 
trail if it gets forwarded.”

UF swim teams sweeps Georgia Tech Invite
The Florida swimming and diving teams took first place 
at the Georgia Tech Invite this weekend. The men has 10 individual wins, while the women won eight.J.C. Deacon is embracing his role as the head coach of the UF men’s golf team. Read the story on Page 14.ERICA A. HERNANDEZ

A depleted Florida basketball 
team caught a break on Saturday, 
when an MRI confirmed junior guard Eli Carter sustained a mid-foot sprain rather than a Lisfranc 
injury in practice on Thursday. 
The diagnosis for Carter comes 
with a sigh of relief for coach Billy 
Donovan and the already-short-handed Gators. 
The team originally feared Cart-
er’s season could possibly be over if he were diagnosed with a Lisfranc injury, but the team found solace in the fact that Carter can be cleared to return in eight-to-10 days.
In an email from the University 
of Florida Athletic Association, team media confirmed Carter is question-able for UF’s upcoming games in the Bahamas in the Battle 4 Atlantis. 
The Gators leave today for Nas-
sau. 
Junior forward Dorian Finney-
Smith, who injured his left hand against William & Mary, is also 
questionable for the Battle 4 Atlantis. 
After the Gators defeated Louisiana-Monroe 61-56 in overtime on Friday, 
Donovan alluded to issues Finney-
Smith is currently facing, aside from the hairline fractures that have held him out the past two games. 
“He needs to take care of his 
academics, he needs to focus on his school work and get that stuff done,” 
Donovan said. “So I told him that he 
needs to take a step away right now since he’s not playing and every-thing else and just take care of his school work and take care of what he needs to take care of.”
Though Florida managed with-
out the experience of both Carter and Finney-Smith on Friday, Dono-
van knows he needs players like 
senior forward Jacob Kurtz and sophomore forward Chris Walker to continue to step up.
Kurtz said he couldn’t remem-

As its competition rapidly 
improves, Florida isn’t shy-
ing away. In fact, the Gators 
could be playing some of 
their best soccer of the sea-son.
In what was almost a 
spitting image of the team’s second-round win on Friday, No. 2-seed Florida defeated the third-seed Texas Tech 3-2 on Sunday in the third round 
of the NCAA Tournament.
Florida scored two goals 
in the first 21 minutes of 
the match to jump on top of 
Texas Tech early, but the Red 
Raiders roared back to even the game at two goals apiece in the 64th minute. 
Much like Florida’s win 
on Friday night against Cal, Sunday’s game was competi-tive and intense until the fi-nal whistle.
Senior Annie Speese was 
the one to break the tie with a strong shot into the upper right corner of the net past a diving goalkeeper in the 81st 
minute. 
Nine minutes later, the 
Gators advanced to the Elite 
Eight.
“It’s kind of a blur,” 
Speese said after the win, about remembering her game-winning goal. 
“I just took the shot and 
I think time stood still for a little bit, and then when it 
went in we were just all so 
excited.”
Senior Havana Solaun 
scored Florida’s first goal on 
Sunday with a strong shot 
from 20 
yards out in the 14th minute.
Sophomore Savannah Jor-
dan then headed in a free kick by Speese in the 21st minute to give the Gators their early 
two-goal lead. 
Solaun, Jordan and Speese 
have been powering Florida 
through the NCAA Tourna-ment, scoring all nine of the 
Gators’ goals in the three 
wins.
But the team as a whole is 
playing as strong as it has all 
year, maybe stronger.
The high level of play 
and production from the 
Florida offense, and defense, in the tournament may be a 
product of the team’s “play 
green” mentality. 
Green means go, and the 
team has worn green sweat 
bands on their wrists in the 
last few games to remind them not to slow down or UF defeats Texas 
Tech, advances to

On Friday, Florida outright clinched its 
21st Southeastern Conference title in pro-
gram history.
And on Sunday, Florida (23-3, 17-0 SEC) 
turned around and made the most service errors in a match for the season in a win against Arkansas (14-15, 8-8 SEC).
It wasn’t the offensive effort of Meredith 
Hays or the defensive prowess of Kori Ortiz that kept Arkansas close in Florida’s four-set win, but rather the 45 total errors Florida made throughout the match.
The Razorbacks took the first set in a 
close 27-25 win but couldn’t manage to get its team attack clip above .083, which ulti-mately stopped Arkansas’ productivity over the net.
Heading into the weekend matches, 
coach Mary Wise was looking for her team to continue to improve its performance to prepare for the postseason.
“I think you’re either getting better 
or you’re getting worse,” Wise said on Wednesday. “There is no maintaining. We have played these team – all (two) remain-ing teams on the schedule – this is the sec-ond time around… we get to spend (time) making this Gator team better.”
In total, Florida had four players with 
three or more service errors. Senior Taylor Unroe led the team with four, while Holly Pole, Mackenzie Dagostino and Alex Hol-ston made three each.
However, while Dagostino and Pole had 
three service errors, they both managed to make two aces each.

LUIS TORRES
Alligator Writer @LFTorresIII
It all started with a single phone 
call.
A call from a coach asking a for-
mer player to come back and join 
his staff as an assistant. The phone 
call was from University of Nevada, 
Las Vegas, coach Dwaine Knight to J.C. Deacon.
It was 2011, and Knight was look-
ing for a new assistant coach. Dea-con played for Knight from 2001 to 2005 and was an integral part of the last UNLV team to win a Mountain West Conference title in 2002.
At ﬁ  rst, Deacon told Knight he 
didn’t think he was the right person for the job.
“You’re crazy, I’ve never thought 
about being a coach a day in my life, I’m the wrong guy,” Deacon said to Knight. “When I really sat down and thought about the opportunity to work for him and to spend some 
more time with him and still be in 
the game, it was an easy decision.”
But what Deacon didn’t know 
at the time was that one phone call would end up changing his life for-
ever.

Before accepting the job under 
Knight at UNLV, Deacon, 32, was 
traveling on the Canadian Tour in which he played in 35 tournaments while making 17 cuts. 
Things weren’t always easy for 
Deacon while playing on the Cana-dian Tour. It was a constant grind for him and the other players he traveled with.
“We’d have to take 500 bucks 
and make it work for two weeks,” Deacon said. “You’re staying in bad hotels and getting the best rental 
cars you can and ﬁ  nding deals ev-
erywhere and free meals.”
While making 17 cuts on the 
Canadian Tour was a great accom-plishment for him, the biggest thing Deacon learned from playing on the Tour was the day-by-day process of improving and not worrying about your results. He took that philoso-phy into his coaching.  
“If you get caught up in every 
result you have and every score you shoot, you’re going to drive your-self nuts,” Deacon said. “But if you just get caught up in the process of 
getting better and learning more 
about your game and trying to do something a little bit better every day, then it can become more of an overall process that you’re trying to improve.”
In those four seasons as an as-
sistant at UNLV, Deacon had to do everything while on staff. From 
fundraising to running the home 
tournament to recruiting, Knight made sure Deacon learned the ropes.
“I feel like I got to mature at 
twice the time of anyone else be-cause I was doing so much and he asked so much of me,” Deacon said. “And it just became natural after a while and it was such an awesome time.”
The workload as an assistant 
under Knight would set Deacon up 
for what would become the biggest 
coaching endeavor in his life. 

Buddy Alexander was ﬁ  nishing 
up his 27th season as the head coach of the Florida men’s golf team when he decided to retire. In 27 years, Al-exander guided the Gators to two national titles and eight Southeast-
ern Conference titles.
But his retirement in April 
opened the door for someone else to 
take the helm of the program.
That person was Deacon.Deacon’s application process 
was different than other applicants because he reached out to UF before it reached out to him. 
Yet again, Deacon didn’t think 
he had a chance at the job. It wasn’t until after following the advice of some of the people he respects in the golf industry that he threw his name into the pot of potential can-didates.
Deacon was given an interview 
and he knew immediately that Flor-ida was the perfect ﬁ  t for him.   
“When I came here I knew that 
Florida was going to be the right place for me,” Deacon said. “When I left here all I could think about for those two weeks when I had to wait was, you know I don’t know what 
I’m going to do if I don’t get the job 
because that’s all I wanted.”
Those two weeks were awful for 
Deacon since everything was out of his control and he wondered if he had done enough in his interview.
Then a phone call came from 
Senior Associate Athletics Director Mary Howard asking Deacon to delete some of his tweets on Twit-ter to help clean up his social media presence. It was Deacon’s ﬁ  rst sign that something serious was about to happen.
The next morning, Athletics Di-
rector Jeremy Foley called Deacon and offered him the job. 

With the job in hand, Deacon 
spent 40 of his ﬁ  rst 45 days on the job on the road building his base with recruits and their families.
“As soon as I got the job, the bill 
that I racked up traveling in the summer was nuts,” Deacon said. “We just went to work and I had to 
meet so many people and get our-
selves established and the only way to do that was hard work.”
Along with working hard on the 
recruiting trail, the ﬁ  rst-year head coach worked on changing the men-tality surrounding the program. 
Deacon wasn’t satisﬁ  ed with the 
team’s performance after the ﬁ  rst 
round of the season, so he put an 
emphasis on changing the way the players felt about the program and making sure they gave it their all.
Deacon’s changes have made a 
positive impact on the team Florida squad as it had two second place ﬁ  nishes in the fall.
“We’ve had to change some be-
havior, I’m just trying to put my stamp on the team and let these guys know what’s important to me,” Deacon said. “We made some big strides this semester.”
When he ﬁ  rst took the job, Dea-
con said there were “champion-ships to be won here.” 
Even though he’s tempered 
those expectations since then, Dea-con feels with the strides he’s made as a coach since he took over the program in June, the future looks bright for the program.
“I can’t imagine how much bet-
ter I’ve gotten as a coach in the last six months, I’m just so excited to be here for the next, hopefully 30 years,” Deacon said. “If I can im-prove as much as a coach as I have this year, every single year, I think we’ll have some pretty good teams that’ll hopefully compete for some championships.”

Florida men’s golf coach J.C. Deacon speaks at a press conference on Nov. 10 at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n 
Stadium. Deacon was named the head coach of the program in June.
He replaced Buddy Alexander at UFgive up.
“Just get after it, no regrets,” coach 
Becky Burleigh said. 
“We’re still playing smart, but we’re 
gonna be aggressive and we’re just gonna 
leave it all on the field.”
But despite the impressive soccer that 
Florida is currently playing at, the pro-
duction on offense and the opportunity to 
now advance to the Final Four, Burleigh is happier about something else.
“I told (the team) I was really, really 
excited to coach them in another game,” Burleigh said. “It’s a group…they just like being together.
“They like to work for each other and 
play hard for each other, and you just want 
to see that get rewarded because you just 
can feel how much they love one another and want this to keep going.”
ber a time he grabbed as many 
rebounds as he had on Friday. The walk-on led both teams in rebounding, pulling down 13 boards.
“Some of them I was for-
tunate they just fell into my hands, so I’m just trying to do my job,” Kurtz said.
Along with his career-high 
in rebounds, Kurtz started the game and played for 36 min-utes, tying a career-high in min-utes that he set just one game 
earlier against Miami. 
Overall, Kurtz said he was 
happy with the win, but he too 
can see areas for improvement.
“We had a couple key break-
downs on defense, three-point line really hurt us,” Kurtz said. “We’ve got a long way to go.”
The Gators know improving 
from the three-point line is criti-cal to the team’s success. 
Florida was 3-for-15 on 
three-point shots while the Warhawks were 9-for-25.
In his season debut, Walker 
tied his career-high in rebounds with six and also added four points in 26 minutes played. 
But Donovan said he was most 
impressed by Walker’s matu-rity.
“I thought he played hard 
and played with energy,” Don-ovan said. “He wouldn’t have looked like that last year. He’s really come a long way and done a great job.”
Center Jon Horford said he 
noticed a difference with Walk-er back on the court from his three game suspension. 
“He’s so active and he gets 
rebounds, you know, he’ll block shots. And he’s such a presence, like even him being there guys hesitate to go in there because they know that he’s so long and 
so athletic, so he makes a big 
difference on the game,” Hor-ford said. “Chris is just going to keep getting better all year, I’m excited for him.”
Meanwhile, Donovan ac-
knowledges some players, like Kasey Hill, still have a long way to go. Donovan said he needs to 
“find a way to help” the sopho-
more guard.
Hill missed the only three-
point shot he took on Friday and missed 10 of the 12 field goals overall, but was 4-for-6 from the charity stripe.
“He’s got to make better 
choices and better decisions. I was really disappointed with him and Chris Chiozza, our two point guards,” Donovan said. “With limited offense on the floor, both those guys turned it over a combined 9 times. They have to do a better job than that.”MONDAY, NOVEMBER 24, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

UF finished with 19 service errors
UF did get a small reprieve dur-
ing the second set when Holston 
managed to serve five consecu-tive plays. Holston’s performance helped get Florida back into a rhythm and limited serving errors for the remainder of the set.
While Holston’s stint serving 
helped the Gators put together key offensive possessions, she also managed to land a service ace, three blocks and nine kills to aid Florida in its win.
While Florida struggled in serv-
ing — finishing the match with 19 serving errors — the team still managed to finish the match with a combined .300 hitting clip and 54 total kills.
Junior Gabby Mallette and 
freshman Carli Snyder were the two biggest scorers for Florida, making 13 and 11 kills, respec-tively. Snyder’s 11 kills set her new career high in SEC play.
“The offensive balance for us 
today was evident,” Wise said in a release. “Our balance was key, along with the combination of play between our front row and our back row to keep Arkansas’ hot hitters from hurting us more than they did.”
With Florida’s final matches 
against South Carolina on Wednes-day and No. 3 Texas on Saturday, the Gators won’t have room for er-rors if they want to stay competi-tive in the last two games before the NCAA Tournament kicks off.vOLLEy , from page 13Senior Havana Solaun opened scoring in the 14th minute

UF coachof Muschamp’s career.
The Seminoles are riding a 27-
game win streak, with their last 
loss coming against the Gators 
to close out the 2012 regular sea-son.
When the Gators make the trip 
to Tallahassee, they will be stick-ing with Treon Harris as their starting quarterback.The true freshman, who threw 
for 162 yards and two touch-downs on 4-of-12 passing, left the game against Eastern Kentucky 
in the second quarter with a knee 
injury. 
Muschamp kept Harris out for 
the duration of the game as a pre-caution.
“There’s no ligament (dam-
age), there’s no cartilage (dam-age), there’s no issues,” Mus-champ said. “It started swelling up a little 
bit on him, it was a good hit he took. And it started to tighten up a little bit so that’s why we pulled 
him.”
When Harris exited the game, 
former starter Jeff Driskel was re-
inserted into the lineup.
And the redshirt junior held 
his own, completing nine of his 11 pass attempts for 164 yards and three touchdowns.
“Jeff is certainly capable of playing extremely well,” Mus-champ said. 
“I have a lot of conﬁ  dence 
in him. Unfortunately we went 
through a stretch there where we 
didn’t take care of the ball at the position and we didn’t move the football consistently enough and we’ve had some success going in 
another direction.”
Florida’s more experienced 
players are making sure its 
younger guys stay relaxed as they prepare for their matchup at Doak Campbell Stadium.
“As a freshman, you’ve got 
to realize it’s going to be a high 
emotional game. highs and low, 
similar to the Georgia game,” Green said. 
“A lot of trash talking, you’ve 
got to stay level-headed and play 
throughout the whole game. 
Can’t get too high, can’t get too low. It’s going to be an emotional game.”16, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, NOVEMBER 24, 2014

After Florida forced Eastern Kentucky 
into a three-and-out on its second

freshman Brandon Powell stopped the

Florida scored six plays later.
KEY STAT: 6
Florida earned its sixth win of the season after 
defeating Eastern Kentucky on Saturday, which 
makes the Gators bowl eligible. UF missed out on

TURNING POINT
With Florida up 10-3 late in the ﬁ  rst quarter, 
freshman quarterback Treon Harris found redshirt 
senior wide receiver Quinton Dunbar for a 70-
yard catch and run that resulted in Dunbar’s ﬁ  rst 
touchdown since 2012. The score put the Gators 
up by 14.
After struggling in the last few 
games, Demarcus Robinson 
returned to his early-season 
form. The sophomore wideout 
caught four catches for 137 
yards and two touchdowns. 
That performance gave Robinson the most receiv-
ing yards (703) and touchdowns (seven) in a season 
under Will Muschamp.
After Eastern Kentucky forced Florida 
to punt with about nine minutes left in 
the ﬁ  rst half, Florida needed one play 
to get the ball back. Sophomore Caleb 
Brantley forced EKU running back 
Dy’Shawn Mobley to fumble and true 
freshman Gerald Willis recovered. Florida scored 
two plays later to extend its lead to 24-3.
McCalister showed that 
he has the tools to replace 
Dante Fowler Jr. at the Buck 
linebacker position next 
season. The redshirt sopho-
more recorded two sacks in 
Florida’s win on Saturday and now leads the Gators 
with six on the season.
With the Gators already up 45-3 half-
way through the fourth quarter, Mike 
McNeely entered the game as UF’s slot 
receiver. McNeely — who scored on the 
fake ﬁ  eld goal that sparked Florida in 
its upset win against Georgia — caught 
the ﬁ  rst two passes of his career and capped the 
scoring with a 28-yard touchdown from Jeff Driskel.
Driskel entered the game 
for good halfway through 
the second quarter follow-
ing a knee injury to Treon 
Harris. In his ﬁ  rst extensive 
playing time since being 
bench, Driskel had a formidable performance, ac-
counting for 172 total yards and four touchdowns.
