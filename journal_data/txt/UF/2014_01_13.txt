Every day in Gainesville, cars disappear.
Residents who park outside a shop, res-
taurant or a friend’s apartment return to their spaces to see their vehicles have vanished.
Those who have experienced this may 
have been victims of roam towing, and one 
Gainesville man is on a mission to end it once 
and for all.
Jeremiah Loper, the 36-year-old general 
manager and partner of Gainesville2Go, cre-ated a petition about a month ago to end roam towing in Gainesville.
Roam towing is legal but differs from stan-
dard towing, where property owners identify the illegally parked cars and then call tow companies to retrieve them, said City Com-missioner Thomas Hawkins.
“(With roam towing) the tow company can 
identify the car first and then tow it without 
hearing from the property owner,” he said.
Loper said he was frustrated with his em-
ployees’ cars being preyed upon by towing 
companies when making food runs.“One of my employees was picking up 
food … went inside for two to three minutes, grabbed the food, went outside and his car was gone,” Loper said. “The car had three Gainesville2Go signs on it. They literally had to be there watching him go in, run over and snatch his car in three minutes tops.”
The petition, hosted on change.org, is 
about 50 signatures away — as of press time 
— from Loper’s 1,000-signature goal and was 
designed specifically to attract local govern-ment officials’ attention, Loper said.
“When I created it, I put email addresses for all city commissioners and the mayor, so whenever anybody signs it, it sends them an email,” he said. 
Loper said although he understands why 
certain towing practices must be enforced, he is still frustrated. 
“They’re taking, especially, from students 
who don’t have a lot of money and are trying to go to school,” he said. “Granted, there are 
problems with parking, but it should be up to 
owners to make the call to tow.” Residents voice frustrations over roam towing

UF will soon be served court papers concerning 
a lawsuit over storing guns in vehicles on campus, 
and allowing firearms in residence halls is now part of the dispute.
Florida Carry filed a lawsuit in Alachua County 
on Friday, making UF the second Florida university to face legal action from the gun advocacy group in recent months. A December court ruling against the University of North Florida allowed guns in vehicles on state campuses, and UF added a footnote to its regulations stating its intent to comply with the deci-sion.
Sean Caranna, executive director of Florida Car-
ry, said the nonprofit sent notifications to all state 
schools asking them to comply. He said UF’s foot-
note wasn’t enough — intent is useful when there is room for interpretation, but UF’s policy is strictly anti-gun.
Caranna said he tried to contact UF President 
Bernie Machen last week, but his call was met by the Gun-rights group 
sues UF over car, dorm policies

The Ringling Bros. and Barnum 
& Bailey Circus came to Gainesville 
for the first time in its more than 100-year history, and many animal rights activists wanted to make sure it will be the last.
About 30 people of varying ages 
showed up to protest during the weekend and stood on the corner of Gale Lemerand Drive and West University Avenue holding signs that read “Ringling Bros. beats ani-mals,” “Elephants are abused” and other objections against the circus’ treatment of animals. On its website, Ringling Bros. 
states it “exceeds all federal animal welfare standards set by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) under the Animal Welfare Act.” 
However, according to an Ani-
mal Rights Foundation of Florida 
news release, Ringling Bros. Circus parent company Feld Entertain-
ment agreed to pay $270,000 in fines in response to allegations that it violated the same laws under the Animal Welfare Act that the circus mentions on its website. 
Many protesters belonged to 
animal advocacy groups such as

Police: Pa. man stole sanitizer to 
make cocktails 
ALTOONA, Pa. — Authorities 
say a man stole 12 bottles of hand sanitizer from a central Pennsyl-vania hospital so he could mix it 
with orange juice and drink it for 
the alcohol it contained.
The Altoona Mirror reports 
51-year-old Lee Ammerman has 
been mailed a summons requir-
ing him to surrender Feb. 5 on 
charges of theft and receiving 
stolen property.
Police say an employee at 
UPMC Altoona hospital saw 
Ammerman steal a bottle of sani-
tizer in October by hiding it in an 
arm sling he was wearing. They say Ammerman returned to steal more sanitizer twice.
Police say they confronted 
Ammerman, who acknowledged stealing the sanitizer, saying, “I mix the liquid with orange juice.”
The hospital is seeking about 
$80 in restitution.

Jan. 13, 1988
About two dozen Floridians won the state’s first lot-
tery, winning $5,000 each. Five of the 21 winners, who 
gambled on the $1 instant winner game, were from the 
Gainesville area. The Alligator reported that those win-ners beat the 80,000-to-1 odds. The scratch-off prizes ranged from $2 to $5,000, and Grand Prize Drawings 
winners would have reaped rewards of about $1 million 
had there been a winner. 
Jan. 12, 1998 About 6,000 Gainesville residents and students signed 
a waiver to save the UF Bat House and select areas near Lake Alice from development. Aides from then-Gov. Lawton Chiles heard community testimonies about pre-serving the historic site from housing construction. A 
campus icon, the Bat House’s demolition would have 
displaced more than 60,000 bats that called it home. It also would have spelled trouble for the ecology in the surrounding area, according to Alligator archives.
Jan. 12, 2000Gainesville City Commission gave UF a thumbs-up 
on a deal between the university and Gainesville Re-gional Transit allowing students and faculty to ride buses for free. The Florida Department of Transportation and the university would split the cost, paying $29,250 each 
for year of transportation. “It seems that there’s demand 
out there for this service,” said Greg DuBois, UF director of Transportation and Parking Services. “We hope over time it will be a program that people take advantage of.” The success and longevity of the program would depend 
on studies of students and faculty who ride the bus. 
Jan. 20, 2009 
Two 8-year-old boys armed with aluminum baseball 
bats defended a woman at gunpoint who was being at-tacked by her ex-boyfriend. The attacker, 30-year-old Charles Bradley, tried time and again to get back together with his ex-girlfriend, threatening her each time she re-fused, according to Alligator archives. The assault took 
place after Bradley arrived at the house and hit his ex-
girlfriend in the back of the head and forced a gun on her, in front of their 8-year-old son and his friend, who was with him at the time. “He tried to get her to open her 
mouth so he could put the gun inside and told her he was 
going to kill her,” said then Gainesville Police Depart-ment spokeswoman Summer Hallett. The boys then at-tacked Bradley, who then fled the scene. Afterward they helped police locate Bradley, and he was later arrested 
and charged with four felonies.

Across the Americas
Taylor Sincich traverses from one tree to another 
across the Plaza of the Americas on Jan. 14, 2009.Hawkins said city officials 
recognize the issue’s impor-
tance among residents and have worked to highly regulate tow-ing practices.
“We talk about roam towing 
endlessly, but we have lots of rules in place to make it less bad for people,” he said, referencing practices like requiring compa-nies to place signs in targeted areas and enforcing maximum fees towing companies can charge. 
Heather Brinn, a 20-year-old 
UF history junior, has never been towed but credits that to her careful parking habits.
“Parking is a pain here,” 
she said. “No one wants to get towed, so I’m fairly certain stu-dents would be supportive of it.”
Local roam towing compa-
nies Superior Towing, Ultimate Towing, Elite Towing and Ad-vanced Towing could not be reached after repeated requests for comment.Helping Hands Pet Rescue, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and the Fort Lauderdale-based Animal Rights Foundation of Florida. Students and UF alumni were also among those protesting.
Jewel Midelis, a recent UF journalism alum-
na and a protest organizer, said she was sur-prised by the turnout.
“Everyone gathered together as a collective 
force to stand up for what we believe in,” she said.
Other protesters agreed.“We want to be the voice for the animals 
who can’t speak for themselves,” said Daniela Perednik, a UF animal science sophomore.
Organizers put together the protests to shed 
light on what they believe is an issue that goes 
unnoticed by many. 
“We hope to open people’s eyes who may 
be going inside to see the circus,” said ARFF 
Central Florida Coordinator Carla Wilson of Winter Springs. “We’re asking them to look be-hind the glitz and the glamor and think about what goes on behind the scenes and what the lives are like for the animals.”
Thousands of people attended the circus 
anyway. 
About 9,500 tickets were sold over the three-
day period, according to the box office.
Some audience members didn’t understand 
the protests, like Santa Fe building construc-tion student Jamilla Payne. 
Payne said she didn’t notice any issues with 
the treatment of the animals during the Friday night show she attended. “If I did, I would have left,” she said.Others said they had a preconceived notion 
of how the circus treated its animals.
“Obviously there must be some kind of 
cruelty involved in training the animals and of course they are happier in the wild than in cap-tivity,” said UF mechanical engineering soph-omore Stefan Hochhaus while waiting to buy his ticket Saturday, “but at the same time, it is fun to come to the circus and see the animals.”

“Saturday Night Live” recently 
added another Gator to its exclu-
sive collection of comedians.
UF telecommunication alumna  
LaKendra Tookes has joined the writing staff of SNL, where writ-
ers like Tina Fey and Seth Meyers 
were first launched into comedic 
stardom. 
Comedian Leslie Jones was 
also recently hired by the sketch 
comedy show. These hires came a 
few weeks after a controversy sur-
rounding the lack of diversity of the “SNL” cast.
Tookes, who graduated from UF 
in 2005, was a former news reporter 
before she took her job at “SNL.”
Bridget Grogan, multimedia 
news manager for the UF Innova-tion News Center, said she sees 
Tookes excelling at her “SNL” job.
“She had a lot of energy and just 
always had a great attitude,” Gro-
gan said.
For current 
UF students like Kelly Collar, 
Tookes’s new po-
sition gives him hope to continue 
pursuing com-
edy.
Collar, a 21-
year-old UF accounting senior, said hearing about Tookes makes 
his dream of being on “SNL” seem 
more possible.
“A lot of big writers go to Har-
vard or an Ivy League schools, but it’s good to see that they can come 
from anywhere,” said Collar, The-ater Strike Force creative director and president of Generation Sketch 
Comedy.
Former “SNL” cast member 
Darrell Hammond was also a UF College of Journalism and Commu-
nications graduate.
Collar said UF is a great place 
for comedians to start.
“I think the diversity of the cam-
pus creates a good environment for humor,” he said.
Tookes could not respond to 
questions as of press time.  
David Ostroff, department of 
telecommunication professor and chair in the UF College of Journal-
ism and Communications, said he’s 
very pleased to see another Gator 
joining the SNL staff.
“I expect to see Gator gear show-
ing up in skits,” Ostroff said.Live from New York: UF telecom

A new UF study abroad pro-
gram faces cancellation if the 
minimum number of students is not met by Feb. 2. 
The UF in Ghana trip is 
struggling to register the 10-student minimum required to proceed with the trip by the deadline.
The first study-abroad trip 
for the new African-American studies major is scheduled for June 10 to June 22 to the West African country of Ghana. 
Patricia Hilliard-Nunn, trip 
director and a lecturer in Afri-can-American studies, said the trip was created to give students a new perspective on African influence in African-American culture and vice versa.
“There is a lot to learn,” Hill-
iard-Nunn said.
Hilliard-Nunn said students 
may be hesitant to apply be-cause they are unaware their financial aid would apply to a Spring-extended trip.
Danisha Baro, a 20-year-old 
UF psychology and African-
American studies junior, said 
she looked forward to “being immersed in the culture.”
She said she was hoping to 
finance her trip with scholar-ships but later felt the trip was too rushed and left her without time to fundraise.Ghana study-abroad

Florida Carry wants guns allowed in dorms, which UF bans
university’s general counsel instead.
“It was a cordial and polite call, 
but they really dismissed all of our 
concerns,” he said.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes 
said in a statement that UF is not challenging the decision, and the university believes it is in full com-pliance. Florida Carry did not voice disapproval of UF’s steps to comply before the lawsuit, she said.
But the group is also suing to al-
low firearms inside dorm rooms.
During UF’s talk with Florida 
Carry, “they never raised the issue of guns in the home, which was not the subject of the court’s decision,” Sikes said.
However, Caranna said the 2008 
Supreme Court case District of Co-lumbia vs. Heller affirms an indi-vidual’s right to bear arms inside the home.
“A student’s dorm room has long 
been defined as their home,” he said. “It is a fundamental civil right . . . It has been too long abused.”
Except when they’re stored 
in cars, having guns on any land owned or occupied by UF is prohib-
ited. The housing department bans 
toys that resemble guns in residence halls — even using Nerf and water guns is forbidden, according to its 2013-2014 Community Standards. Other forbidden items include BB guns, paintball guns and slingshots.
Dylan Wolfgram, a 22-year-old 
UF physics junior, said he doesn’t see the need for students to have guns in their dorm rooms.
“I mean, how often are there 
break-ins at the dorms?” said Wolf-gram, a Tolbert Hall resident. 
He said there should at least be 
a test requiring students to qualify before bringing firearms into their dorms.
UF’s chapter of Students for Con-
cealed Carry supports Florida Car-ry’s lawsuit, said president William Salvato, a 21-year-old UF biology senior. He plans on helping when he can.
“This is pretty much a warning 
to all other universities who didn’t want to change their policies,” he said.

After drawing inspiration 
from a car-chase scene in “Fast 
and Furious,” a UF professor teamed up with fellow professors to create an improved helmet de-sign for athletes and beyond.
Ghatu Subhash, a professor 
in the Department of Mechani-cal and Aerospace Engineering, said rapid movement of the brain causes concussions. 
His design is meant to coun-
teract two types of forces that may endanger the brain: linear and rotational.
While most athletic helmets are equipped to handle the force of one type of injury — linear — the new design provides protec-
tion by focusing on the two lead-
ing types of head impact.
“Our design concept includes 
how to minimize the linear blow 
to the head in a direct hit as well 
as the rotational component,” he said. “Almost all helmets are de-signed for only linear force and not rotational force.”
Subhash said he hopes this de-
sign will serve a wider audience than athletes, including firefight-ers, skateboarders and bicyclists. 
The inner chambers of the hel-
met contain two layers. 
One is Newtonian fluid, made of water and air. 
The other is non-Newtonian 
fluid, which is a gel-like sub-
stance. 
The chambers work together 
to make up a padding to protect the skull, said Subhash.
Dr. Keith Peters, a UF associ-
ate professor of neuroradiology, 
said that this design allows for 
more of a gradual stop for skulls in motion.
“One layer of the design 
can slow down how the impact comes in,” he said. “The other 
layer decreases how rapidly the brain is moving through the skull by slowing downs the speed at 
which it hits the other side.”
Although their design has not 
been tested against all foams, the 
cushion the researchers designed absorbs more impact than other 
comparable cushions, Peters 
said. 
Later this month, the helmet 
will be presented to a group of 
investors to help launch the be-
ginning stages of building it for production. The design is completed, but a 
final model has yet to be decided on, Peters said. 
The helmet remains unnamed, 
but Peters said because the idea was conceived in The Swamp, Gators can look forward to see-
ing something related to UF. 
Dan Apple, assistant com-
munications director for the UF 
Athletic Association, said the athletic association will not be 
adopting these new helmets any 
time soon.
“It’s is still in the development 
stages,” Apple said. “We are al-
ways analyzing our equipment 
and are concerned for the highest level of safety for our athletes.”

old Mary Viola Mobley on charges of aggravated assault and resisting an officer, ac-cording to an arrest report.
At about 5:30 a.m., Mob-
ley arrived home to her boy-friend of 10 years and went into the room where he was sleeping, according to the re-
port. The two began arguing, 
and Mobley grabbed a black-handled butcher knife that was stuck in the wall.
She pointed the knife at 
him and said, “I will kill your ass!” according to the report.  
Her boyfriend then called 
911, and Mobley left the room.
Three deputies had to re-
strain Mobley while putting her in handcuffs, according to the report.
During questioning, Mob-
ley said she and her boy-friend got into an argument but denied touching the knife, according to the re-port. Mobley also admitted to recently smoking crack co-caine and marijuana.  
Deputies did not find the 
knife Mobley was accused 
of using, according to the re-
port.However, they noticed 
a smaller knife and several holes in the wall.
Deputies booked Mobley 
into Alachua County Jail at about 11 a.m., where she re-mained as of press time in 
lieu of a $10,000 bond.

Gainesville Police arrested 
two Quincy, Fla., residents 
in connection to a reported stabbing Friday night at a lo-cal hotel.
Officers arrested 55-year-
old Barbara Copeland Smith 
on an aggravated battery 
stabbing charge and 56-year-old Arch Gee on a felony bat-tery charge, according to two arrest reports. 
At about 6 p.m., officers 
responded to the Holiday Inn at 1250 W. University Ave. and found Smith with 
bruises and scratches on her 
face, said GPD spokesman Officer Ben Tobias. 
Smith told police her 
friend Arch Gee tried to beat her up, and she stabbed him with a knife to get away, To-bias said. She also told offi-cers he was still in room 207. 
Officers found Gee, who 
had four stab wounds to his chest, head and back, Tobias said. Both Gee and Smith were taken to UF Health Shands.
During questioning, Gee 
told officers Smith stabbed him during an argument and 
that he hit her in self defense, 
Tobias said.
Officers booked Gee 
and Smith into the Alachua County Jail, where Gee re-mained as of press time with a $10,000 bond. Smith was released Saturday after meet-ing a $15,000 bond.Weekend police beat:

Jessica Robertson cradled a 
2-month-old pit bull in her arms 
and smiled as it covered her cheek 
in tiny kisses.
At the opening celebration of 
Robertson’s animal hospital Satur-
day, local volunteer organization 
Plenty of Pit Bulls held a dog adop-
tion drive from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Paula Miller, a “foster mom” 
who cares for some of the group’s rescued dogs until they find homes, 
brought her foster dog, Gemma, a 
6-month-old female pit bull.
Miller, 67, said Gemma’s previ-
ous owner gave her up for adop-
tion because the owner was a stu-
dent and didn’t have enough time to take care of a dog.
“She’s come to find that the crate 
isn’t where she lives all the time,” Miller said of Gemma, whom she described as a cuddler.
Plenty of Pit Bulls, founded in 
2010, rescues dogs from animal shelters in Putnam, Clay, Levy and Alachua counties, Miller said. Vol-
unteers then foster the dogs until 
they find new homes.
Miller said she believes the me-
dia is responsible for the negative image many people have of the breed.
Plenty of Pit Bulls board mem-
ber Blanca Carbia agreed with Miller. Carbia said the breed has developed a negative reputation from stereotypes about pit bull owners. 
“If you have a powerful, intelli-
gent, muscular animal at the end of the leash, you have to know about animals and animal behavior,” 
said Carbia, 55. She added that she 
hopes adoption-drive participants who hadn’t encountered a pit bull before have a better understanding 
of the breed. 
Jagger — a 1-year-old male pit 
bull — and three 2-month-old pit 
bull puppies were also part of the adoption drive. Miller said by the 
end of the open house, adoption 
applications were filed for Gemma and a couple of the other puppies.
Miller said she thought giving 
up her foster dogs over the months would be hard, but she knows it is for the better.
“They’re going to a home where 
they’re really going to be loved,” 
she said.Pit bulls feel the love at adoption driveRESEARCH

The importance of 
public optimists
As consumers of media, we often encounter public in-
tellectuals: well-known, intelligent, learned persons whose written works and other social and cultural 
contributions are recognized not only by academic audi-ences and readers, but also by many members of society in general. Vaclav Havel, Noam Chomsky and Gloria Steinem are all prominent public intellectuals who contribute to dis-course across a wide span of topics that affect our lives, from politics to economics to feminism. 
With the advent of Internet fame, now, a new phenom-
enon has emerged: the rise of public optimists. 
They appear on talk shows, their memoirs are picked up 
by Oprah’s Book Club, and, in the case of Sam Berns, a teen 
with Progeria, they host TED talks and are the subjects of 
HBO documentaries. 
Sam died at the age of 17 on Friday due to complications 
with Progeria, a rare disease that accelerates aging. Most children with Progeria die at 13, according to NPR.
At a TED talk in December, Sam described his philoso-
phy for coping with Progeria and maintaining a happy life. He said his hobbies — playing drums in his high school’s 
marching band, hanging out with his friends and studying 
biology — give him a sense of purpose during the difﬁ  cult 
times he faces as a person with a terminal illness. 
“Even though there are many obstacles in my life, I don’t 
want people to feel bad for me,” Sam said, according to NPR. 
“I don’t think about these obstacles all the time, and I’m able to overcome most of them anyway.”
His death was a shock to his family, who expected him to 
attend college in the Fall.
Sam’s life and his openness about struggling with his rare 
disease represents what is perhaps the most touching — and 
heartbreaking — type of public optimist: children. 
America lost another young public optimist last year: 
Talia Castellano. Talia, a 13-year-old girl with cancer who 
achieved Internet fame with her YouTube makeup tutorials, died in July. Talia is famous for appearing on “The Ellen 
DeGeneres Show” and telling the audience, “When people 
ask me that, what do you want me to do, be depressed? I 
mean, a little ﬁ  shy told me, ‘Just keep swimming, just keep 
swimming!’”
We are drawn to the stories of public optimists who re-
fuse to let their illnesses, disabilities and harrowing experi-
ences deﬁ  ne them, or who use those experiences to educate 
others. Furthermore, we need these public optimists to pro-vide perspective in our lives: While both petty problems and 
big dilemmas plague us daily, from unpaid bills to piles of 
homework to relationship and family troubles, public opti-
mists remind us that life is ﬂ  eeting. Rather than dwelling on 
the impermanence of our existence, however, these public 
optimists urge us to value our lives and dedicate them to 
bettering ourselves and the world.Gov. Chris Christie’s bridge to nowhere
For commuters in New York and New Jersey, Sept. 
9 was just another day — until they reached the George Washington Bridge that connects the two 
states.
The trafﬁ  c jam was unusually rotten that day, taking 
some drivers three to four hours to reach their destina-tion.
As it turned out, the Port Authority of New York and 
New Jersey closed two of three lanes on the bridge. What was originally thought to be a “trafﬁ  c study,” turned out to be nothing more than political retribution.
It turns out a top aide to New Jersey Gov. Chris Chris-
tie emailed David Wildstein, Christie’s close friend and appointee to the Port Authority, asking him to cause traf-
ﬁ  c problems in Fort Lee, N.J., home of an entrance to the 
George Washington Bridge.
Why?Mark Sokolich, the mayor of Fort Lee, didn’t endorse 
Christie’s bid for re-election last fall. 
Stay classy, New Jersey.The fallout is just beginning. Christie ﬁ  red the aide 
who pushed the idea, and Wildstein testiﬁ  ed to what happened on Wednesday — although he pled the Fifth 
for every question asked. Meanwhile, Christie denied 
any and all knowledge of what his staff did and held a nearly two-hour press conference to defend himself.
Whether Christie is complicit in all of this hardly mat-
ters. What matters is just how low some are willing to go for political gain or political retribution. Some small-town mayor, who’s not even in the same political party as Christie, refuses to endorse him, so we have to make the lives of ordinary citizens miserable?
It might possibly be a new low in American politics. 
Christie’s ambitions are far higher than governor, and many pundits have already tapped him as a top Repub-lican contender for the 2016 presidential election. The bridge incident calls into question Christie’s ability to run for president and lead the country.
The bridge situation sets up one of two possibilities: 
Christie either wanted revenge against the mayor of Fort Lee because he didn’t endorse Christie, which makes the gov-ernor a bully, or he didn’t know what his top staffers were doing, which makes him incompetent.
Regardless of what he did or 
didn’t know, this is not the man I want running the country. As president, if Christie’s slighted by a foreign leader, does he ex-
act revenge by killing trade deals, enforcing sanctions or invading their country? What if Christie, unaware of what his top staff does, lets them get away with using the White House as a tool for political retribution against 
other elected ofﬁ  cials?
Sure, it’s a hyperbolic thought, but Christie’s ability 
to put his job ahead of politics is now called into ques-
tion. Christie’s image is sure to tarnish as a result, and his pathway to the 2016 Republican nomination was just clouded by an ongoing investigation.
The state Assembly has started looking into the mat-
ter, and it could grow worse for Christie because his ofﬁ  ce is also being investigated by the U.S. Attorney’s 
ofﬁ  ce — Christie’s former job — and the FBI’s public cor-
ruption unit.
Anyone who thinks Christie could waltz through the 
Republican primary and subsequently the 2016 presiden-tial election ought to reconsider that notion. Although Christie’s an affable, no-nonsense politician with bipar-tisan support, his ofﬁ  ce at the very least caused a night-mare for average Americans all because he didn’t get what he wanted.
Is this the person you want leading our country for 
the second half of this decade?
The last time we had a president this skilled in the art 
of political retribution, it didn’t work out well. 
His name was Richard Milhous Nixon, and the rest is 
history.

Dear Editor,
I was amazed to open the Monday Al-
ligator and find no story about the Na-
tional Championship football game that 
evening. 
The game pitted No. 1 ranked, in-state 
rival Florida State University and No. 2 
ranked SEC rival Auburn, which had an 
incredible win over then No.1 ranked Ala-bama to get to the championship, includ-
ing the greatest single game-ending play 
in the history of college football. 
Was this just a horrible oversight? 
Or did the Alligator sports reporters 
drink too much spiked eggnog over the holidays? 
Maybe it was just that our hometown 
Gators weren’t in the game and your re-porters lost interest? 
I see your newspaper is advertising for 
new columnists. Perhaps you need to start with the sports department. 
When I wrote for my high school paper 
in Miami long ago, I covered all sports and sporting events, or else I heard about it 
from not only the athletes themselves, but 
also the Student Body at large. By the way, what happened to Medio-
cre Advice, your best weekly column? 
Do you need me to take over? I am a Gator, and I bleed orange and 
blue. 
Like Socrates, I give great advice.

1. They don’t copy label-for-label off of street-style blogs.
Inspiration is called inspiration for a 
reason. It’s supposed to inspire you to come up with your own version. Someone already wore what you saw, so it’s been done.
 I’m not saying you can’t wear what you see, but use 
what you see and put your own twist on it.
2. They can find something at any store and make it 
work.
Whether it be Chanel or Walmart, stylish people 
aren’t afraid of any store. 
They don’t turn up their nose at any place as long as 
they stay true to their aesthetic. 
A true style guru will pull from anywhere, making 
their style unique. Who only needs to wear one label, 
anyway?
3. They style themselves according to their own 
taste.
It’s all in the styling! Yes, you may have this boring 
button-down shirt, but what makes it look cool is the way the wearer styles it. Maybe they roll up the sleeves 
or partially tuck it in or layer with it. 
It’s all up to your style preferences.4.They look a little less done than everyone around 
them.
They are the people who are in Converse while ev-
eryone is in heels. They aren’t afraid to make a jumpsuit 
black-tie ready.They are the people who chop their hair 
into a bob while the trend is long. 
No matter what it is, they make a state-
ment without making a statement.
5. They know that labels aren’t every-
thing.
These people don’t need labels to make them feel 
cool  — they just are cool. 
It’s the confidence that makes them cool and stylish.
6. They know the trends, but they aren’t trendy.The most stylish people have a consistent uniform 
they reach for. 
They will replace their classic pieces with newer, 
more modern ones. 
They don’t fall victim to the one-season fads or the 
hair-raising trends.
7. They don’t dress to be considered “stylish.”Stylish people don’t expect to get compliments. They 
dress for themselves and no one else. They dress in what works for them and their lifestyle. 
Yes, it may be considered “cool” to wear heels around 
your college campus, but you know it’s more comfort-able to wear flat boots instead. It’s much cooler because you feel much more confident in your skin.
So there you have it: proof that you don’t have to 
have the best clothes from the best brands to be con-sidered stylish. Style comes from within  — from being comfortable, happy and true to your own style.

Using the true-life events of the 1970s ABSCAM 
scandal — in which the federal government enlisted the aid of con artists to help them 
entrap politicians — as merely a pushing-off point, “American Hustle” dishes up complex themes of deception, love and disappointment. 
It’s a cinematic dissertation on the types of characters 
who define not just a period in time, but a lost cultural 
era. 
They are the types of people who will do anything 
to live the American dream. 
To put it simply:They are the types who are always interesting to 
watch.
What must be praised most 
are the actors who bring these 
characters to life. 
“Hustle” boasts an 
ensemble cast of actors and actresses in their own respective primes, making what could be caricatures 
of big hair and fur coats feel like flesh and blood. 
At the center are Christian Bale and Amy Adams, 
whose performances as the swindling swingers 
Irving Rosenfeld and Sydney Prosser are deeply layered and intricately nuanced. 
Bradley Cooper finds a desperate intensity in 
the ambitious federal agent and mama’s boy Richie DiMaso, forever crushing any lingering doubts that he can’t be taken seriously as a dramatic actor. 
Jeremy Renner plays the gullible mayor with a 
heart of gold with such ferocious sincerity that seeing him conned would be tragic — if only the way they do it wasn’t so much fun. 
All of these performances, complemented by 
Rosenfeld’s scene-stealing wife — Jennifer Lawrence — who shows why divorce can be a very healthy option, round out “American Hustle” as the best-acted film of 2013.
“American Hustle” isn’t a film geared toward 
straightforward storytelling. 
It’s a study of character defined by colliding 
moments, projecting everyone involved through painful downfalls and touching redemptions. 
It’s a multifaceted portrait of honesty and the lies 
that we tell everyone, including ourselves.
The only better assemblage in the film than the 
cast is the soundtrack. 
“10538 Overture” by Electric Light Orchestra 
provides the unofficial theme song for lives on the edge of chaos. 
“Long Black Road” by Jeff Lynne is used as the 
rhythm for constructing the perfect con. 
Other track choices play best in the way they 
bring insight to the characters and their motivations, like the way the hypnotic tones of Donna Summer’s “I Feel Love” bring the perfect atmosphere to a scene at a disco that catalyzes the intense love triangle between Bale, Adams and Cooper.

Signs placed on Northwest 16th Street indicate ongoing construction. Many sections 
of the street are scheduled for closure while the area undergoes improvements.

Alligator Contributing Writer
Motorists driving on Northwest 16th 
Avenue may need to modify their daily 
trafﬁ  c routines due to the road construc-
tion project that started last week.
The 4-mile resurfacing operation will 
remove and replace existing asphalt, up-
grade pedestrian facilities and stabilize the 
retaining walls along the corridor, accord-
ing to the Alachua County Public Works Department.
“The pavement is beyond sensible pot-
hole repair,” said Brian Singleton, Alachua 
County transportation engineering man-
ager. 
Daytime lane closures are scheduled to 
occur throughout January and February, 
and drivers will not have to worry about 
detours, Singleton said. 
The roughly $8 million project is sched-
uled to be completed by November and is funded by impact fees, a local-option gas 
tax and Gainesville Regional Utilities.     
The department will add left turn lanes 
to improve trafﬁ  c ﬂ  ow at the intersection of Northwest 55th Street and Northwest 
23rd Avenue as well as median modiﬁ  ca-
tions in high crash-rate areas like the inter-
section of Northwest 16th Boulevard and Northwest 43rd Street near the Millhopper Shopping Center, Singleton said.
Jake Cunningham, a 21-year-old UF 
criminology senior who’s lived on North-west 16th Avenue for two years, said he  noticed the deterioration in the road. He said he’s glad that the project is taking 
place.
“There’s this one spot down (North-
west 16th Boulevard) that has probably 
had about a dozen potholes,” Cunning-ham said. “The patchwork is terrible. They 
just cover it in a lump of asphalt.”Road construction causes delays for drivers on 16th Avenue� THE SPRAY WORKS ON MICE.

A UF-created mouth spray that makes mice less hungry 
may lead to breakthroughs in human weight loss.
The study recently found mice eat less when treated with 
a peptide YY spray, according to a news release. The Peptide 
YY hormone is naturally secreted from cells in the small intes-tine after a meal. It decreases appetite, making the body feel fuller than it actually is. 
After testing the solution on thousands of mice, researchers 
are trying to see if the hormone can help reduce skyrocketing 
obesity rates. Initially, when human subjects were injected, it 
caused them to vomit. Now, after testing the oral spray form of peptide YY on mice, it appears the spray may be equally effective without the negative side effects, said UF professor Sergei Zolotukhin.
The spray enters through a different pathway on the 
tongue that reacts with the rewards center of the brain, said Zolotukhin, an associate professor of cellular and molecular therapy in the UF College of Medicine’s department of pe-diatrics.
Liana Juarez, an 18-year-old UF biochemistry freshman, 
questioned whether the spray could potentially cause an un-healthy problem.
“If they are masking the effects of hunger ... how will they 
know when they are actually hungry and will eat enough to supply the body with the nutrients that they need?” she said.
Work on peptide YY will continue, though the project 
needs more funding, Zolotukhin said.UF researchers: Mouth spray could ﬁ  ght obesity in humans

Florida men fall in tournament
The three men’s tennis players remaining in the UTSA Futures Event 
in Sunrise lost on Sunday. Spencer Newman, Diego Hidalgo and Mike Alford all fell in three sets in the secound round. Gators in the NBA
Former UF guard Mike Miller scored 15 points in 26 minutes in the Memphis Grizzlies’ 108-101 loss to the Atlanta Hawks in Memphis, Tenn., on Sunday.The Gators landed a top running back recruit to solidify their 2014 class. Read the story on page 15.JONATHAN CZUPRYN
Alligator Staff Writer @jczupryn
Arkansas was going to make Scottie Wilbekin win the 
game for No. 10 Florida, and he did.
The senior point guard was listed as questionable for 
the Gators (13-2, 2-0 Southeastern Conference) heading into their matchup with the Razorbacks (11-4, 0-2 SEC) 
on Saturday, but a sprained right ankle did not stop Wil-
bekin from sending the game into overtime and icing the contest with late free throws as Florida won 84-82 on Sat-urday in Bud Walton Arena in Fayetteville, Ark., without 
its leading scorer, Casey Prather (knee). The Gators’ vic-tory snapped the Razorbacks’ 25-game winning streak at home.
In a back-and-forth game that included 13 ties and 
seven lead changes, Florida’s last chance in the second 
half came with only 18 seconds left and UF down 66-64. 
Michael Frazier II grabbed a rebound off of an Arkansas 
missed free throw and quickly dished the ball to Wil-bekin.
Although coach Billy Donovan had one remaining tim-
eout, he chose to let Wilbekin run the isolation offense 
and take the final shot. With fewer than five seconds re-
maining, the 6-foot-2 point guard drove, pulled up and banked in a 16-foot shot to tie the game at 66 with two seconds left.
Wilbekin said his right ankle was at about 80-90 per-
cent, which limited his motion and agility. However, there was no doubt the senior was going to take the last shot in the second half as he ran the isolation offense.
“I give our guys a lot of credit (with) just the resiliency 
to come back,” Donovan said. “And then Scottie, making a tough shot at the end of regulation to give us a chance in overtime.”
Dorian Finney-Smith, who led the team with 22 points

“I’m happy for him,” Finney-Smith said about Wil-

(Wilbekin) did. He shot it with confidence.”
The Razorbacks were forced to toss up a prayer at half 
court as time expired, but the shot missed and both teams 
saw overtime for the first time this year.

Florida’s nine-game winning streak 
came to an end on Sunday in Baton 
Rouge, La. 
The No. 12 Tigers physically domi-
nated the Gators, handing Florida an 
82-68 loss. 
However, the deck was stacked 
against the Gators heading into Sun-
day.
Sophomore Christin Mercer, who 
has averaged 11.8 points and 5.8 re-bounds per contest this season, was suspended and did not make the trip to Baton Rouge, leaving the Gators with only two bench players for the af-
ternoon. A reason and timetable for the 
suspension have yet to be released.
The 6-foot forward’s absence was 
clearly felt in the paint, where LSU nabbed 50 rebounds compared to Flor-ida’s 29. 
“We just got crushed on the boards,” 
coach Amanda Butler said. “We had one player that really came with the in-
tention of grabbing rebounds and mak-
ing plays in the paint.”LSU snaps UF win streakmen’S bASketbAll

Senior forward Casey Prather (bone bruise 
in right knee), UF’s leading scorer this season, is 
doubtful for No. 10 Florida’s matchup against Georgia on Tuesday night in the O’Connell Center, the school announced Sunday. 
Prather sat out of the team’s practice Sun-
day afternoon and did not play in Florida’s 84-82 overtime win on Saturday at Arkansas, his first missed contest of the year. He also did not participate in the Gators’ two practices before Saturday’s contest.
After Florida’s home win against South 
Carolina on Wednesday night, Prather woke up Thursday with swelling in his right knee. Coach Billy Donovan went more into specif-
ics about the injury on Friday afternoon before 
the team traveled to Fayetteville, Ark.
“We actually thought 
maybe there had been some cartilage tear with the way his knee was swelling, so he had an MRI (on Thursday),” Donovan said.
 “Cartilage tear, his knee 
structure, all that stuff is 
fine.”
In 14 games this year — all starts — Prather 
has averaged a team- and career-best 17 points on 62.4 percent shooting, 5.5 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game.Prather doubtful for UGA

AS STEIN ON TV
Something is rotten in the state of Flor-
ida. 
Through a tip given to the Alliga-
tor, I learned of a video posted on the social 
media website Vine that apparently showed 
UF quarterback Will Grier, a recruit com-
mitted to Florida at the time, yelling a ho-mophobic slur at people in a locker room.
The video, titled “Lax es gay,” was 
posted on April 18, 2013, to Grier’s Vine ac-
count, which has more than 300,000 follow-
ers as of this writing. In the six-second vid-
eo, the word, “f**,” is said 11 times before ending the video with the camera pointing at Grier as he says, “Lax is gay,” referring to 
the school lacrosse team his brother, Nash 
Grier — a Vine celebrity in his own right — plays on.
This is unacceptable behavior from Gri-
er. The use of that word is not acceptable 
by anyone, let alone someone who plans to 
represent UF — on the football ﬁ  eld or oth-erwise. A Florida spokesman said that while the program monitors its players’ social me-dia accounts, he could not com-ment on the video when asked.
The word Grier, who en-
rolled at Florida last week, chose to scream at others has a history of being used to tor-ment gay people for decades 
— if not longer — and it has no 
place in any type of civilized conversation. 
You don’t have to be gay to disapprove 
of this word or be offended by its use. I’m 
not. However, I do think using slurs meant 
to demean a group of people is wrong.
Even if no one Grier yelled at is gay, he 
still took the next step of posting the video 
on Vine, a popular social media website that 
has millions of subscribers and an even fur-ther reach. 
Chances are, someone who is offended 
by the word saw the video. 
The clip has more than 11,000 likes, 4,600 
“revines” and 700 comments. The most re-cent comment as of this writing came on Sunday. Clearly, a lot of people have viewed it. 
Some people commented on 
the video to criticize the use of the word. One commenter said, “Maybe ﬁ  nd another word to 
scream at people, yes?” One 
warned Grier that the use of the word might come back to 
hurt him if it drew attention. Another called him immature and said his parents would 
be disappointed.
However, most of the comments are de-
bating the merits of lacrosse and how attrac-
tive Nash looks in the video.
Look, I understand that this is probably 
not an isolated incident in locker rooms. I’m sure if you put a camera in locker rooms around the country, you would ﬁ  nd a lot of similar conduct. “Boys will be boys,” as the 
idiom says.
But “boys being boys” does not justify or 
excuse the use of offensive slurs.When you take on a high-proﬁ  le position, 
such as the anointed future quarterback at 
the University of Florida, like Grier has, you 
need to conduct yourself in a certain way. 
You are held to a higher standard.
If a random UF student was pulled over 
and was arrested for marijuana possession, 
it wouldn’t be interesting. 
When a football player does it, they end 
up on the front page.
We in the news business call this “promi-
nence.” Grier is a prominent person at UF, and everything he does for the next several 
years will be under the microscope.
Is that fair? You be the judge. But it is 
how the world works.
Grier is probably not a bad person. He 
might not even be a homophobe. I don’t know. 
What I do know is that screaming out 
slurs and posting them online is not becom-
ing conduct of someone who will likely be 
one of the faces of the Florida football team for the next few years.Gem of recruiting class wrong to use slur in online video

No. 1 Florida defeated No. 
4 UCLA on Saturday — but 
just barely. 
Florida’s total score of 
196.65 points topped UCLA’s 
196.625 with the smallest pos-
sible margin,  but the Gators 
are aware that they need to improve if they want to repeat as national champions. 
“We had numerous mis-
takes and areas that we are going to work on, but that is what it is — a starting point,” coach Rhonda Faehn said in a 
release. 
“They know where we 
have to go from here.”
Junior Kytra Hunter, 
sophomore Bridget Sloan and 
senior Mackenzie Caquatto competed in all four events. Junior Rachel Spicer compet-ed in vault, balance beam and 
ﬂ  oor. Senior Alaina Johnson 
competed in vault, bars and balance beam.
Bridgette Caquatto de-
buted her season in vault (9.75), uneven bars (9.90) and ﬂ  oor (9.75). 
After a limited freshman 
season due to foot surgery, 
sophomore Bianca Dancose-
Giambattisto competed in uneven bars (9.875) and per-formed an exhibition bal-
ance beam routine (9.775) at 
UCLA. 
Florida had falls in three 
of its four events. Although none were counted against the Gators, one more mistake 
could have easily landed the 
Gators in a losing spot. 
“Personally, I don’t want to start out the season with a 198 score” Sloan said. 
“We had some errors here 
and there.”
Hunter’s ﬁ  rst-place wins in 
all-around (39.375) and ﬂ  oor 
(9.925), as well as Bridgette 
Caquatto’s uneven bars win (9.90) contributed to the team win. 
“As a team we were able to 
pull it together,” Sloan said. 
“We didn’t have the best score 
as a team, but in the end, we had a decent enough of a one to get the win.”
In her ﬁ  rst collegiate gym-
nastics competition, Silvia Colussi-Pelaez performed two exhibition routines on bars and ﬂ  oor, while UF’s only 
other freshman, Claire Boyce, 
competed in two events.
“I feel we could see her on 
the other events later this sea-son, knowing that she is such 
an aggressive competitor,” 
Faehn said of Boyce, who scored 9.85 on beam and 9.825 on ﬂ  oor. 
Faehn said she thought 
Colussi-Pelaez was “pretty solid” even though she suf-fered a fall on the uneven bars, resulting in an exhibi-
tion score of 9.125. She scored 
a 9.60 for her ﬂ  oor exhibition routine. 
With the UCLA meet in 
the books, the Gators return to Gainesville to continue their packed spring schedule, which includes a meet a week for the next 11 weeks. 
“We knew they weren’t 
going to be 100 percent like we would be at the end of the season,” Faehn said. “We have to pace our athletes and make sure they aren’t going 
to break down early in the 
season.”Florida squeezes out win at UCLA in opener

LANDON WATNICK
Alligator Staff Writer @LandonWatnick
With three of its starters ailing, Florida needed forward 
Dorian Finney-Smith to step into a starting role for only the 
second time this year and produce against Arkansas.
By the time the buzzer sounded Satur-
day in Fayetteville, Ark., Finney-Smith had the most productive stat line of his college 
career — 22 points on 7-of-15 shooting, 15 
rebounds, three assists and three steals.
“I just wanted to come out here with a 
lot of energy,” Finney-Smith said. “I knew 
the crowd was going to bring a lot of en-ergy. I just wanted to match that.”
During the No. 10 Gators’ 84-82 overtime win against 
the Razorbacks in front of a raucous crowd in Bud Walton Arena, Finney-Smith logged a career-high 42 minutes in the absence of senior forward Casey Prather, who was out Sat-
urday with a bone bruise on his right knee.
Finney-Smith had nine points and seven rebounds at 
halftime, but the Virginia Tech transfer’s first half was not 
smooth sailing. He committed three turnovers after mishan-dling the ball twice and charging into the lane once. 
Normally, early mistakes like these would rattle Finney-
Smith. 
“The one guy who I’ve tried to instill just a belief of con-
fidence in is Doe-Doe,” coach Billy Donovan said. “Just be 
aggressive, play through mistakes. … He takes things so 
personal when he doesn’t do what he feels he should be do-ing out there and he gets down sometimes with himself on that, and sometimes it drains his energy.”
But Finney-Smith was one of the most energetic and 
composed players on the floor during the second half and 
overtime Saturday.
Playing the game’s final 18:34, Finney-Smith made key 
plays for the Gators down the stretch.  
With 2:39 left in overtime, Finney-Smith bailed out fresh-
man point guard Kasey Hill, who had the ball stolen by Ra-zorbacks forward Bobby Portis while taking it up half court. 
But seconds later, Finney-Smith intercepted Portis’ bounce pass intended for an Arkansas teammate.
Finney-Smith then earned a trip to the charity stripe on 
the next play, sinking 1 of 2 free throws to give UF a 72-69 lead.
Thirty-seven seconds later, Finney-Smith drained an 
open three from the left wing to lift the Gators to a 75-69 lead – their largest advantage of the game at that point. Despite 
missing a three-point attempt late in regulation, Finney-
Smith was not hesitant to pull the trigger in that situation.
After Finney-Smith’s confident performance Saturday, 
his coach was left impressed. 
“He’s always been a phenomenal rebounder, and he did 
a good job of rebounding the ball [Saturday}, but it was good to see him make some shots and put it on the floor,” Donovan said. 
“He did a lot of different things for us. I was really happy 
for him personally. 
“We’re going to need for him to continue to grow and 
develop.”
A radio broadcast contributed to this report.Finney-Smith fills 
stat sheet in UF winPeoples, Needles lead UF in points
Kayla Lewis was that player, col-
lecting a career-high 17 rebounds 
and scored 15 points on the after-noon. Lewis accounted for seven of Florida’s 10 offensive rebounds and 
10 of its 19 defensive boards. 
“She did about all she could do,” 
Butler said. “Grabbing 17 rebounds 
is fantastic, but then when the next person only has three, it’s going to be very hard to beat a really talent-ed team like LSU.
“If you give up 50 rebounds — 
20 of them being offensive and you 
only get 10 — things are not going 
to go your way.”
The first half of Sunday’s matinee 
was a rough one for Florida. The Ti-gers laid it on thick with a 10-0 run and two 8-0 runs, putting the Gators in a steep 40-25 hole at the half. At the time, the Florida was 
shooting 22.2 percent from the field compared to LSU’s shooting clip of 50 percent. 
“It was really a soft first half for 
us, and you can’t do that against a team like LSU,” Butler said, “espe-
cially when you’re on the road.”
The second half was a little 
brighter for Florida, as it outscored 
LSU 43-42 during that half. How-ever, rebounding and foul trouble ultimately did the Gators in, as Wil-liams fouled out with 6:15 on the clock and LSU outrebounded Flor-ida 27-15 in the half. 
“They’re significantly bigger 
than us in the paint, but that’s not a new challenge,” Butler said. “We’re used to that. They did a great job po-sitioning for rebounds. We needed to make boxing out more important, and we didn’t.”Overall, the Gators struggled 
shooting from the field, sinking 30.4 percent of their shots. Senior Jaterra Bonds went 2 for 11, while three of Florida’s other six players laid eggs in the shooting percentage column — senior Lily Svete, freshman Ron-
ni Williams and sophomore January 
Miller went a combined 0 of 13. 
However, redshirt sophomore 
guards Cassie Peoples and Carlie Needles put up strong numbers in spite of the teams poor percentages on offense. Peoples scored 22 points and went 10 for 10 from the charity stripe, while Needles scored 17 and 
sunk a game-high 5 of 8 attempts 
from beyond the arc. 
Unfortunately for Florida, the 
strong play of its guards was not enough to propel it to victory.

Wilbekin, who was 2 of 2 at 
the line during regulation, was first sent to the charity stripe with 35 seconds left and his team 
up 78-75. In total, Wilbekin went

Despite the injured ankle, the 
point guard finished the game with 18 points, which ties a career high, and only one turnover.Donovan said that although 
Wilbekin iced the game late in the second half and in overtime for the Gators, he added that they wouldn’t have been put in that 
position if it weren’t for Young.
The senior center, who was 
limited to 16 minutes because of a pair of sore knees, fell three re-bounds shy of a double-double 
as he finished with 10 points and seven boards. 
“I thought Patric was a mon-
ster in the second half, although he didn’t play a lot of minutes,” Donovan said. “He rebounded the ball, he 
defended, he chased balls on the glass, he made a couple free throws. I thought he played very, very well tonight considering he 
had limited minutes.”

Florida dominated the Day 2 of the 
UAB Blazer Invitational at the Birming-
ham CrossPlex on Saturday.
The Gators finished their first meet of 
the season with 13 event victories and 10 meet records, which included UF top-10 
all-time performances and two CrossPlex 
records.
“We leave this meet with a very good 
taste in our mouth,” coach Mike Hollo-way said in a release. 
“We have an extremely special group 
of men’s and women’s athletes.”
With several top marks in the country 
so far this season, UF set the scene.
Senior hurdler Eddie Lovett won the 
men’s 60-meter hurdles in a time of 7.81 seconds. 
Moriel Pitt won Section B, clocking in 
at 7.97 seconds.
In the men’s 60-meter dash, Hugh Gra-
ham Jr. ran a 6.66-second meet record to win the event.
Antwan Wright also won Section B in 
a 6.63 sprint. 
“We had great effort from Antwan 
(Wright) and (Hugh) Graham, Jr., to get us started this morning in the 60m — a big PR for Antwan,” Holloway said. 
The Gators also ran for two CrossPlex records.
In the men’s 4x4, Najee Glass, Graham 
Jr., Nick Uruburu and Arman Hall ran a meet record time of 3:06.11 to win the event. 
In the women’s 4x4, Robin Reynolds, 
Destinee Gause, Kyra Jefferson and Ebo-ny Eutsey took the event with a time of 3:37.83. 
Eutsey also claimed the 200-meter dash 
in 23.70 seconds, a meet record. 
“I thought our hurdlers did great and I 
was impressed with Robin (Reynolds) in the long jump, a PR for her,” Holloway 
said.
Holloway said Bridgette Owens and 
Cory McGee had great races, and both 
4x4 teams came up big.
McGee ended up taking the women’s 
800-meter with a meet record time of 2:07.47.
UF cleared their first meet, but Hollo-
way doesn’t want early success to dimin-
ish the focus ahead. 
After wrapping up in Birmingham, 
Ala., the Gators will have 11 days before 
they head to Lexington, Ky., to compete at the Rod McCravy Memorial on Jan. 24. 
“The thing we have to keep in mind is 
this is the first meet of the season and no-body is going to care about this meet next week,” Holloway said. 
“We’re going to get back to Florida, 
rest up and get back to training Mon-day.”MORGAN MORIARTY

The tail end of last week was a 
whirlwind of recruiting news for 
UF’s 2014 class. With a series of big swings 
from top recruits, Florida coach Will Muschamp and his staff has already pieced together an im-pressive class late with less than a month until National Signing 
Day. 
Early Friday morning, 2014 
running back Brandon Powell, 
Rivals.com’s No. 7 tailback out of 
Deerfield Beach High, flipped on 
his verbal commitment from Mi-ami to Florida. 
Powell was supposed to be 
on campus in Coral Gables last 
Wednesday, but after Florida of-
fered him that day, he decided he would instead enroll early at UF. Powell made it to Gainesville on 
Friday. 
Powell racked up 1,339 yards 
along with 20 touchdowns during 
his senior season. 
Additionally, he had 21 catch-
es for 289 yards — something that Powell will be doing a lot of in new offensive coordinator Kurt Roper’s up-tempo spread 
offense. 
Powell will join UF’s backfield 
that will feature redshirt senior 
Mack Brown, junior Matt Jones, who is recovering from a torn 
meniscus, and sophomore Kelvin 
Taylor — a significant part of UF’s offense near the end of Florida’s 2013 season. 
The Gators finished 2013 
ranked 88th in the country in rushing yards per game.
The news did not stop with 
Powell. On Friday afternoon, 
wide receiver commit Ermon 
Lane posted on his Twitter ac-count (@_MoneyLane) that he was decommitting from UF say-
ing, “No Hard Feelings But I Just 
Decommitted From The Uni-versity Of Florida . Not Because Dalvin Cook. No lie I love gator 
nation.”  
The news did not come as a 
surprise, as it was obvious that 
Lane was wavering on his ver-bal commitment to UF. There is a 
possibility that Lane could end up 
following Cook to Florida State. 
The Seminoles have three 
wide receivers committed in their current 2014 class, and the loss of Kelvin Benjamin to the NFL Draft exposes the need for explosive 
wideouts. 
One of the receivers in FSU’s 
2014 class is Travis Rudolph, who 
can make an impact on offense 
immediately. 
If Jimbo Fisher can convince 
Lane to join Cook, the FSU offense 
will have lethal young weapons across the board to work with in 
2014.
The best pickup Florida could 
get to replace Lane is JUCO pros-pect Eric Lauderdale. Lauder-
dale, who hails from Saddleback (Calif.) Community College, has offers from Florida, Arizona State 
and Oregon. 
During his 2013 season, he av-
eraged 100 receiving yards per 
game and had nine touchdowns 
in seven games. 
Lauderdale is scheduled to 
make an official visit to Arizona 
State on Jan. 17 and will be in Eu-gene, Ore., a week later.
Lauderdale visited UF in No-
vember. 
Another possible replacement 
for the loss of Lane in the 2014 
class is Isaiah McKenzie, Rivals’ 
No. 54 receiver in the 2014 class. He will make his official visit to Gainesville on Friday. McKenzie also has received offers from Ore-
gon, West Virginia and Kentucky, 
among others. UF’s passing game struggled in 2013. Florida fin-ished 109th in the nation in pass-
ing yards per game.
A couple of 2015 recruits made 
news on Friday as well. Miramar 
High four-star safety prospect Kendrell McFadden announced 
his verbal commitment to West 
Virginia on Friday night. McFad-den chose WVU over Florida, Alabama, Miami and LSU. 
Highly touted 2015 dual-threat 
quarterback Torrance Gibson was offered by Florida on Saturday morning. Gibson is the No. 3 ranked quarterback prospect in 
the 2015 class, picking up offers 
from Ohio State, Alabama, LSU, Florida State and others.MONDAY, JANUARY 13, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Injuries continue to plague former Gators 
receiver Percy Harvin.
The fifth-year veteran had to leave the field 
twice with apparent head injuries in the first 
half of the Seattle Seahawks’ 23-15 win against 
the New Orleans Saints in the Divisional 
Round of the NFL Playoffs on Saturday. He left the game with a concussion in the second quarter.
On Seattle’s third play from scrimmage, 
quarterback Russell Wilson dropped back and threw a pass to Harvin down the left sideline. Harvin bobbled the ball and, while falling to the ground, was hit in the neck and helmet 
area by Saints safety Rafael Bush. Harvin was 
sent to the locker room to be evaluated for a concussion but returned to the field for Seat-tle’s next offensive possession.
Just four offensive drives later, the Sea-
hawks lined up at the Saints’ 8-yard line for a second-and-goal with 1:40 remaining in the second quarter. 
Wilson, standing in the shotgun, faked a 
handoff to Harvin and ran around the back-field while trying to avoid pressure from Saints defensive linemen Cameron Jordan and Tom Johnson. After eight seconds, Wilson ul-timately rolled left and threw an incomplete pass to the left corner of the end zone. The pass was intended for Harvin, whose head landed awkwardly on the ground during the play af-ter being hit by Saints safety Malcolm Jenkins. 
Harvin did not return after that play.
Harvin, who played in only one game in 
the 2013 regular season due to a hip injury, 
finished the contest with three catches for 21 yards, including a 16-yard grab up the middle against Saints cornerback Corey White in the second quarter. His status for Sunday’s NFC Championship game against the San Francis-co 49ers is uncertain.McDonald helps 49ers: San Francisco 
defensive lineman Ray McDonald recorded three tackles in the 49ers’ 23-10 win against the Carolina Panthers on Sunday. The seven-year veteran was part of a 49ers defensive line that limited Carolina to 93 rushing yards and applied constant pressure to Panthers quarter-back Cam Newton, who was sacked five times and hit on nine different occasions.
