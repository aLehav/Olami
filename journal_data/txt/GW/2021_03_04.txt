Sophomore guard James Bishop carried GW's offense in the second frame of a game against Fordham, sinking 12 of 25 points. The Colonials narrowly beat the Rams 53–49 Wednesday for their first A-10 tournament win.
In the final 40 seconds of play Wednesday, men’s basketball trailed Fordham by one point until sophomore guard James Bishop tossed the ball to sophomore forward Jamison Battle, who swished a triple through the net.
Battle lifted the No. 11 Colonials (5-11, 3-1 A-10) ahead by two, and junior forward Ricky Lindo Jr. sealed the deal with two shots from the charity stripe to eliminate the No. 14 Rams (2-12, 2-11 A-10) from the first round of the Atlantic 10 Tournament. The 53–49 win was the first A-10 tournament victory for head coach Jamion Christian at GW and every student-athlete on the roster.
“Everybody wasn’t here last year, except for [Jamison] and Chase, so it’s big for us,” Lindo Jr. said. “My first tournament win, and it’s my third year in college, so it’s big for everybody. We’ve just got to keep it going.”
Lindo Jr. and Battle ushered in the majority of GW’s offensive production. Lindo Jr. paced the team with a career-high 21 points, tacking on 14 rebounds and three steals. Battle notched 17 points on 7-of-15 shooting, including three triples. The rest of the roster combined for 15 points.
Fordham entered the game fresh off a two-week athletic department-wide COVID-19 pause and last competed Feb. 17. Against the Colonials, sophomore guard Chris Austin led the Rams with a dozen points, and sophomore forward Joel Soriano and junior guard Jalen Cobb rounded out the team’s double-digit scorers with 10 points apiece.
Both teams fired at nearly identical clips from the field and beyond the arc as each squad connected on 20 field goals and six shots from deep. GW decided the game at the free throw line. Fordham hit 3-of-6, while GW found the four points it needed to pull out a win, nailing 7-of-10 at the charity stripe.
The Colonials avenged a 20-point loss that sent them packing after the first round of the tournament last year.
Both offenses struggled to find the hoop right out of the gate. Two minutes elapsed before sophomore forward Chase Paar hit a jumper from the elbow and put GW on the board. Over the next two and a half minutes, the Colonials worked the lead up to 8–0 as Fordham started the game shooting 0-of-5 from the three-point line.
Redshirt senior forward Chuba Ohams, who was expected to miss the remainder of the season with a knee injury, checked into the game and announced his return with a slam.
After a Battle triple propelled the team to an 11-point edge, Fordham strung together a four-point tilt. Bishop and Lindo Jr. worked to keep the advantage in the double digits as the Rams began to find their footing.
With seven minutes left in the frame, GW looked like it had control of the game, leading 25–10. But Fordham’s defense held steady, and its offense began to pick up steam. The Rams pieced together a 15-3 spurt, holding the Colonials to just one field goal in the final seven minutes of the first half.
Lindo Jr. tallied 50 percent of his team’s points in the first 20 minutes, and the squad entered the locker room with a slight 28–25 edge.
Battle dominated his team’s offense in the second half. He netted 12 of the Colonials’ 25 points in the frame.
“He’s been there before,” Christian said. “We want to make sure we just kept him involved. We kept finding a way to get him touches because I just trusted his decision-making he was going to make today.”
The big man hammered a shot from distance to give GW a two-possession advantage, but Fordham answered with four straight points. Battle scored the next bucket, slamming a dunk through the iron on a pass inside from Bishop.
The Rams answered again with two straight baskets to grab the lead, starting a race for the top that saw 10 lead changes and two ties as both teams jockeyed for position. Battle willed GW back in front with back-to-back jumpers.
Knotted at 39 with 11 minutes on the clock, Lindo Jr. went to work in the paint, ripping an offensive board and sinking the putback. The next two minutes descended into a three-point shootout as Fordham hit a shot from the perimeter to take the lead.
Freshman guard Tyler Brlesford launched a ball from beyond the arc that slid through the net, and the Rams hit another triple on the next possession. But the Colonials’ defense stopped Fordham when it mattered, holding the Rams scoreless in the final three minutes of the game while tacking on six points.
The squad outlasted the Rams and prevented a repeat of last season with a 53–49 win.
“Basketball is a game of runs, so I told the guys going into the second half of the end of the game, after Ricky got the technical free throws, that this is where we probably make our run,” Battle said. “It wasn’t a big run, but it got the job done.”
The Colonials play again Thursday against George Mason for the second round of the A-10 tournament. The two teams met last week when the No. 6-seeded Patriots earned a 63–58 victory. Tipoff is slated for 5:30 p.m.

Farmbird's spicy roasted fresno plate comes with chicken breast, brown rice, pickled red onions, crispy shallots and cilantro with fresno pepper sauce to add a kick.
Get yourself through midterms with a hearty meal from Farmbird.
Farmbird has two D.C. locations, one in Penn Quarter at 625 H St. NE and one more central to campus at 860 E St NW. Indoor dining is not currently available because of the pandemic, but you can get a dish delivered to you or pick it up.
I ordered from the Penn Quarter location on Grubhub, and it took just less than 30 minutes to arrive. Grubhub included no delivery fee, so for the three plates I ordered for my roommates and myself, I paid about $40 in total.
The fast-food-style restaurant touts its fresh chicken dishes and vegetable sides. For a meal, you can choose between one of five protein plates ($10.35) like the chipotle masala or barbecue ranch plates; salads ($10.35) like the cucumber soy salad with chicken thigh; or sandwiches ($10.35) like the pulled barbeque chicken sandwich. For sides, Farmbird offers plates like kale and avocado salad and crispy mac and cheese.
While Farmbird is advertised to be a primarily chicken-focused eatery, it accommodates dietary restrictions. In addition to being gluten-free, each bowl comes with the option to swap out the chicken for tofu.
Each of the five plates comes with your choice of a protein and base, with options like brown basmati rice, riced cauliflower and supergreens. Wanting a kick, I ordered the spicy roasted fresno plate ($10.35) with chicken breast, brown rice, fresno pepper sauce, pickled red onions, crispy shallots and cilantro.
As it is a local business, Farmbird touts its local, humanely raised chicken from farms in the DMV. The chicken lives up to its hype – it was notably fresh and cooked perfectly tender.
I opted for a base of brown rice, which was good, if a bit dry. But the rice was balanced out by soft pickled onions, cilantro and roasted fresno peppers. The spicy roasted fresno plate is certainly for those who like a little heat – the peppers and onions give the dish a noticeable kick that was not too overpowering but still suffused the senses.
The plates include one side and greens, which can upgrade to a second side for an extra $1.45. Unsure of how large the sides would be, I opted for one, the brussels sprouts, which were crispy and seasoned with salt and pepper. But next time I’d go for a second, like the roasted sweet potatoes, mac and cheese, chili lime cucumbers, avocado or chickpea salad. Each side costs $3.35.
I ordered the unsweetened black tea ($2.85) for my beverage but also could have gone with the raspberry tea ($2.85) or the wild kombucha ($4.85). If you choose to include a dessert, consider ordering the Sweet Street Salted Manifesto Cookie or the Sweet Street Chocolate Chunk Manifesto Cookie (each $3.35) in your order.
The next time you are looking for a quick lunch made with locally grown food, try Freebird.

“We really need to normalize people being depressed.”
“It’s totally OK to be depressed right now.” 
“Mental illness is serious, we need to prioritize it.”
I’ve heard all of these lines, which is great, until I hear:
“Oh my god, this year has been so bipolar.”
“I was totally manic and dyed my hair.” 
For the most part, my peers and those I follow on social media seem to understand that mental illness must be destigmatized. But in my experience, the only mental illnesses that people make a concerted effort to destigmatize are anxiety and depression. It seems that even though more people are aware of mental illness and the importance of taking care of mental health, many people do not extend their understanding and compassion past the few illnesses that have been talked about most. We can’t have it both ways – we cannot tell each other that it’s OK to be depressed, then throw in a quip about being “psycho” a minute later. 
Mental health has been brought to the forefront of our attention in recent years, and especially since the onset of COVID-19, but I could not feel further from the discussion. I do not experience illnesses, like anxiety and depression, that always seem to make it to an Instagram infographic. I’m left experiencing illnesses my friends and family do not completely understand. We can only make sense of mental illness if we recognize that there is more than anxiety and depression. We must work to educate ourselves on that and completely destigmatize having a mental illness.
When people talk about destigmatizing mental health and mental illnesses, chances are, they are talking about certain disorders like anxiety and depression that have been highlighted in movies and television and not about all mental illnesses. Depression and anxiety tend to be most often discussed in the conversations around mental illness destigmatization, while someone experiencing Borderline Personality Disorder is more often cast aside by society and sometimes mental health professionals. The same goes for sicknesses, like psychosis and schizophrenia – they’re less commonly talked about because society views them as shameful. But if we want to end the stigma around these mental illnesses, we need to develop a deep understanding of all of them.
In reality, we have not really destigmatized mental illnesses. People still call someone acting off a “psycho” or “bipolar,” belittling those who actually suffer from these illnesses. People have paid more attention to grasping the difference between stress and anxiety or sadness and depression than illnesses they know little to nothing about. All mental illnesses have not been destigmatized because society – and that includes students, professors and officials – is not broadening the discussion around mental illness to include them all.
As someone who suffers from a serious mental illness that is not depression or anxiety, I have not felt that I can speak out about my illness because it has not really been destigmatized, as much as people say they are sympathetic. People toss around terms like “psycho” and “bipolar” as if they are adjectives and not chronic illnesses. It has been especially difficult to hear someone tell me that mental health is important until someone displays symptoms of mental illness that is outside their realm.
Perhaps support for these illnesses is not equal to that given to depression and anxiety because they are rarely talked about. And when someone does talk about it, it feels uncomfortable. To change these perceptions and destigmatize all mental illnesses, we need to educate each other. While it should not be up to those living with mental illnesses to explain their condition to everyone, it is important that people listen to each other and learn from each other. People should take five minutes and reach out to the people in their lives, or even just look up information online. 
Lending support and learning about the conditions that impact one in five adults is the first step to making everyone feel comfortable in this world.

Coronavirus cases around the United States have plummeted since early January, falling from more than 250,000 new cases per day to fewer than 70,000 by the end of February. This is unmistakably good news. Progress in combating the virus has flagged over the last two weeks, and, unfortunately, colleges and universities around the United States are part of the reason why. Cases on campuses have risen by nearly one-third since the new year began.
D.C.’s seven universities have seen 388 new cases since Jan. 1, with GW accounting for nearly half of those. Students were sent home last spring to avert this exact problem, but thousands have returned to the District to resume some semblance of a normal college experience. These people, myself included, have access to resources like testing sites to ensure we are safe during this time. But when seniors graduate in a couple of months, those in D.C. will suddenly lack access to resources like convenient testing to which many, myself included, have become accustomed.
To combat this rise in cases, the University should expand the pool of people who can come get tested on campus to include recent alumni, at least those who graduated in the last few years.
A lot of recent alumni still live around campus, and there are plenty of available testing slots for off-campus students like myself. Adding recent alumni to the pool of people who can get tested at Shenkman Hall will help reduce the burden on other testing sites around D.C. without inconveniencing students. While the number of daily tests administered by the District is relatively low right now, another wave of COVID-19 cases is due this spring as variants tear through the country, meaning new cases – and necessary tests – are likely to rise, perhaps beyond levels previously seen. The cost to the University is presumably minimal – they’re already doing a lot of tests, and a few more won’t make much difference.
From the University’s perspective, expanding testing is an easy way to build some goodwill. The alumni that recently graduated may well still rue the loss of their last on-campus semester or two. Plus, graduating from college after missing any semblance of campus life for more than a year is pretty anticlimactic. Taking concrete steps to involve recent alumni in the GW community may go a long way in making those students feel like they’re still a part of the community.
If and when I am still around campus this May, it would be a relief to have access to testing sites I have gone to for the past year. I know the same is true for my senior peers.  Building or rebuilding a sense of community among current and former students is key right now. It’s convenient and takes a little bit of a weight off of everyone’s shoulders. This group of alumni is likely more spread out around D.C., so ensuring that recent graduates have access to COVID-19 testing is vital.
GW can be something other than a front for a real estate corporation and do some good for their new alumni. Relieving some of D.C.’s testing responsibilities is also a small step toward being a better partner with the city, and it may help alumni feel like part of the GW community again.

Officials attribute a recent spike in COVID-19 cases to small social events and Greek life activity, a University spokesperson said.
GW’s COVID-19 dashboard showed 32 cases on Feb. 17, the most cases recorded in one day all semester, followed by 21 and 26 positive tests recorded on two of the next few days. University spokesperson Crystal Nosal said the increase in cases can likely be attributed to gatherings like dinners, birthday celebrations and Greek life activity and encouraged students to maintain social distancing and mask-wearing.
“From a public health standpoint, now more than ever we are encouraging people to continue adhering to safety precautions for COVID-19 such as wearing masks, layering their masks when possible, social distancing and gathering in small groups only when necessary, and preferably outdoors,” Nosal said in an email. “GW students should follow these same recommendations to help get us through this next phase of the pandemic.”
She said in some cases, officials are able to identify small “chains” of viral transmission while others appear to be community-acquired.
Of the 79 positive tests from those three days, all but three of those tests were for students. Almost 60 of those cases came from voluntary tests, according to the dashboard.

Janice Blanchard, a professor of emergency medicine, said vaccines are safe because they activate the body's “natural immune system” to work against the virus.
A panel of medical experts addressed common questions and misconceptions about the safety of new COVID-19 vaccines Tuesday.
Experts from the Milken Institute School of Public Health, the School of Medicine and Health Sciences and the School of Nursing discussed the technology behind these new vaccines and why they are safe and effective in warding off the virus. Public health school Dean Lynn Goldman moderated the event, which was hosted by the University.
The technology behind COVID-19 vaccines
Jon Andrus, a professor of global health, said the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use mRNA technologies, a method that isolates genetic material in virus cells and triggers humans to produce spike proteins to fight against the virus.
He said the Johnson & Johnson vaccine utilizes inactivated viral vector technology, which modifies and inactivates the virus to trigger human immune responses.
“It is no longer alive and acts as a shuttle to transport that genetic material when injected into the vaccine recipient that allows it to enter the host cell,” Andrus said. “And again, also like the other vaccine, uses the wholesale proteins making machinery to produce, fight proteins.”
The vaccine’s safety
Janice Blanchard, a professor of emergency medicine, said vaccines are safe because they activate the body’s “natural immune system” to work against the virus. Pfizer also continuously monitors its vaccinated population to measure the safety of its vaccines, she said.
Marc Siegel, an associate professor of medicine, said scientists have not found any safety concerns from the 70 million doses of vaccines that have been injected in the U.S. population.
“One of the concerns with the mRNA vaccine is this the first mRNA vaccine that’s ever been approved,” he said. “But the technology has been around for five to 10 years and has been looked at in many of these disease processes.”
Siegel added that recent developments of new technology could wrap the mRNA in a liquid particle and protect it throughout its way into human cells, creating a “safe and successful” vaccine.
“I’m very, very confident that this is a safe technology,” he said. “It is new, but it has been in the research field for a while.”
Mistrust toward the vaccine
Bill Borden, a professor of medicine and health policy, said health care workers and his patients at the GW Hospital were initially “very anxious” about getting the vaccines. But he worked with employees to start a campaign, a website and a vaccine ambassador program focused on answering frequently asked questions.
“Soon after I got my vaccine, I actually posted on social media, and I had friends, even from grandmas going from the south side of Chicago, who actually told me they got the vaccine because of me,” she said.
Andrus said the process of vaccination is “very emotional” with this pandemic, and he and his wife broke down crying after they got vaccinated.
He said the vaccine companies measured illness to determine the effectiveness of the vaccines against death or hospitalizations. He said studies show a vaccinated person could still transmit the virus to others, and there is more monitoring needed on the current vaccines in terms of their effectiveness against the new variants.
“The quicker we vaccinate, the quicker we’ll handle these variants,” he said. “We need to actually vaccinate the rest of the world, where they tend to emerge.”
All experts said people should not worry about which vaccine to receive in the upcoming months, but they should feel “a sense of urgency” and take the first vaccine that is available to them.
“The first vaccine you can get is the best vaccine to get,” Borden said.

Seth Weinshel said the number of students living in Thurston will decrease from 1,100 to 820 students to create “extensive” amounts of community space on every floor.
As Thurston Hall undergoes renovations, officials and former residents weighed in on the building’s impact on students throughout the University’s history and how its legacy will continue.
Alumni spoke about their collective experiences and memories living in Thurston as part of the University’s bicentennial celebrations Tuesday. Architects working on the building’s new design laid out the plans for Thurston’s renovations, discussing how it will continue to foster community for students while maintaining much of the building’s facade.
Seth Weinshel, the assistant dean of students, campus living and residential education, said the number of students living in Thurston will decrease from 1,100 to 820 students to create “extensive” amounts of community space on every floor. He said the renovated building will have double units with three to four common areas per floor and more community spaces like kitchens, study areas and lounges to foster community for Thurston residents.
“We want students and residents to know that this Thurston community is unique to GW and will be the focal point of our first-year experience,” Weinshel said.
Joe Atkins – a member of the architecture firm VMDO Architects, which has worked on the building’s new design – said the open-air courtyard, dining hall and additional study lounges will create new ways for students to come together in Thurston. He said Thurston’s design will include removing several upper floors on the south side to create an open-air, elevated courtyard that will give students the ability to connect in a shared space.
“It is a way of bringing spark and energy and finally bringing a way for students to come together and really feel like they belong,” Atkins said.
Rob Valero, the executive director of GW’s Center for Real Estate and Urban Analysis and a former Thurston resident, said he has many memories of living in the “iconic” residence hall. He said he made friends while living in Thurston that he is still in touch with 40 years later.
“Thurston Hall has been a rite of passage for so many GW students,” Valero said. “It’s a place where many of us found our first friends at school.”
Valero said his time in Thurston coincided with pivotal events in American history, like the Iranian hostage crisis and the election of President Ronald Reagan. He said while living in Thurston, Reagan visited the F Street House, which used to be a private club, and many students gathered outside the house down the street from Thurston.
“These ‘only at GW moments’ were why most of us came to D.C. in the first place,” Valero said.
Attendees to the webinar also watched a documentary from GW’s Bicentennial Film Series titled “1900 F,” in which former Thurston residents reminisced about their memories living in the residence hall. Alumni shared experiences living in Thurston during major political moments, like the election of President Barack Obama, when students gathered around the White House after his election.
“Three sets of friends who began relationships on the fourth floor later got married,” Valero said. “I’m happy to say that all three couples are still going strong and are listening to this event today.”

Officials debuted four working groups that will conduct research on and develop recommendations about GW’s academic landscape after the COVID-19 pandemic, according to an email to the GW community Tuesday.
The University launched a task force in January to study lessons learned during the pandemic, like teaching styles and GW’s paused strategic planning rollout, and present recommendations to Provost Brian Blake by May. The task force’s “Phase I working groups” will focus on undergraduate students, graduate and professional students, faculty and staff and academic support personnel, the co-chairs said in the email.
“In mid-March, the task force will form Phase II working groups, which will focus on themed areas to explore further in order to formulate recommendations requested in the charge,” the email states.
In the next four weeks, the working groups will study existing research on academic concerns, innovations and opportunities that GW community members have realized during the pandemic, the email states.
The task force is also soliciting input from GW community members through surveys, interviews or at town halls, which they plan to incorporate in the recommendations to Blake, according to the email.
“The Post-COVID Academic Innovation Task Force will incorporate input from many voices within our GW community when it delivers its recommendations to the provost in May,” the email states. “University community members may participate in Phase I by completing surveys, giving interviews, or attending focus groups and town halls.”

Edwards said her “first priority” is to set up a student “reopening task force” to sit in on conversations with administrators about GW’s plan to reopen for the fall.
A fourth candidate for Student Association president has joined the race, running on a platform to provide financial relief opportunities for low-income students and hold community-wide events between SA members and the student body.
Hannah Edwards, a junior and former SA vice president for diversity and inclusion, said she wants to push for updated scholarship opportunities for students. Edwards said she will use the connections she has made with officials and SA support to create an “inclusive culture” through hosting events, like an LGBTQ health and advocacy conference and a student-led conference about men and women of color.
“I think that helping to set the tone for the University whenever we go back to campus and with all these initiatives that I hope will actually change the institutional culture of GW – that is why I decided that I had to run for this position,” she said.
If elected, Edwards would be the first Black female SA president, which “in itself is important,” she said. Edwards is joining SA President Brandon Hill; SA Sen. Charles Aborisade, U-at-Large; and Christian Zidouemba in the race.
Edwards is required to gather at least 250 signatures during the candidate registration period from Feb. 24 to March 6 and must be approved by the Joint Elections Commission to qualify as a candidate.
Edwards said her “first priority” is to set up a student “reopening task force” to sit in on conversations with administrators about GW’s plan to reopen for the fall. She said the emails that officials sent to students regarding reopening plans for the fall were “too vague,” so she wants to work with officials to increase transparency.
“I will be in all of those meetings about the pandemic response and figuring out how to get it back on campus,” she said. “And making sure the student body is aware of what is going on behind the scenes because all the emails that were sent about the pandemic were not cutting it for me.”
Edwards said she plans to create peer education groups on topics like diversity and inclusion and sexual assault prevention on campus. She said the groups will host workshops and conversations for other students.
She said she has had conversations with Jordan West, the director of diversity and inclusion education, to create the diversity mentorship program to coincide with the peer education groups, which Edwards said West supported.
Edwards said she has also spoke about increasing sexual assault education programs with members of Students Against Sexual Assault and Tamara Washington, the assistant director of the Office of Advocacy and Support. She said she wants to increase the opportunities available for students to host or attend workshops on topics like sexual assault.
Edwards said she plans to host a student-led men and women of color conference, similar to the diversity summit. She said this event would bring in students around the D.C. area to learn about “what it means to be a college student” and act as a “representation of what students can accomplish.”
Edwards said she has had conversations with Chris Hooton, the associate director of alumni engagement and outreach, to create a scholarship dedicated to low-income students as GW currently does not have separate scholarships specifically dedicated to those students, outside of financial aid.
“If a student has a financial burden and they cannot make the difference between what they’re given by the financial aid office and student loans and their tuition, then they may not be able to continue their time at GW,” Edwards said.
Edwards said she also plans to host community service events like a 5K run/walk, where the money raised will go toward assisting the homeless population in Foggy Bottom. She said she would reach out to officials in the athletic department and members of the Interfraternity Council and Panhellenic Association to collaborate on the event with the SA.
Edwards said if elected, she will also facilitate an “interfaith dinner and dialogue” event with students to discuss different faiths on campus in a “respectful way.” She said the interfaith council – a student organization advocating for religious tolerance – hosted a similar event last year, and she hopes to partner with the organization to “expand” the event to more students.
She said she will also seek to plan events, like an ice cream social, with SA leaders and Residence Hall Association members for students to feel more comfortable speaking to members of those organizations at community-wide events.
“Right now, we have midnight breakfast and we have other great events like that that the entire student body gets excited to come out for – freshman day of service and different things like that,” she said. “So offering more opportunities for students to engage with each other is what I hope to achieve in the position.”
