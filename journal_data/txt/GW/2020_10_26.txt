The 2015 women's soccer team's historic run came to an end in the quarterfinals of the A-10 tournament after falling to George Mason.
In lieu of fall sports, we’re dusting off the history books and taking a look back on 10 of the best GW sports moments, ever. Here’s to hoping some old-fashioned nostalgia can keep us going until the restart.
No. 10: Women’s soccer snatches 13-game winning streak, program records
The 2015 women’s soccer program went on a historic 13-game winning streak to clinch the Atlantic 10 regular season title for the first time since 1995 and claim their first undefeated season in conference play.
Spurred by then-fourth-year head coach Sarah Barnes, senior defender Brooke Stoller and junior forward MacKenzie Cowley, the Colonials achieved a 15-4 overall record to tie the program-high number of wins set in 1987. The Colonials held the nation’s longest active win streak and dwarfed the previous record of eight consecutive wins in 1998.
After a 2-1 start to the season, the Colonials hit a three-game slide against Drexel, Georgetown and Delaware. Throughout that span, GW netted just two goals and allowed eight. With a dominant 3–0 victory over Liberty the next week, the Colonials simultaneously halted their losing skid and began the longest consecutive win streak in program history.
GW went on to shut out its next two opponents in nonconference play before hosting Saint Joseph’s for its conference debut. The Colonials gained an early lead off a strike from Cowley and scored another goal in the final minutes of the game to complete the shutout.
In the four-game stretch from Sept. 17 through Oct. 1, GW kept a clean sheet and netted two or more goals in each contest. Redshirt sophomore Miranda Horn served as the squad’s primary goalkeeper during the stretch, making 13 saves. Senior goalkeeper Ellen Conway tacked on five more saves to keep opponents scoreless during the stretch.
The Colonials also notched a victory in every single overtime contest for the first time in program history. Conference play saw four of their five overtime matches, with back-to-back battles with St. Bonaventure and La Salle Oct. 4 and 8, respectively, and consecutive extra minutes with George Mason and Rhode Island Oct. 25 and 29, respectively.
Against George Mason, neither team could score throughout two halves of regulation. Conway anchored the team between the pipes after Horn left the game with an injury and made five saves in the second half to carry the squad into extra minutes.
Cowley nearly ended the game in the first half of overtime, but an acrobatic save by redshirt junior goalkeeper Kirsten Glad kept the teams level. Cowley finally put the game to bed in the second overtime after 107 minutes of play.
With a 1–0 win over Saint Louis on their home turf, the Colonials clinched the A-10 regular season crown and the top seed heading into the A-10 Tournament. At the 80-minute mark, Cowley netted her 10th goal of the season to seal the 2015 squad into GW history and top off the team’s perfect 10-0 record in the conference.
The Colonials’ run came to an end in the quarterfinals of the A-10 tournament to No. 8-seeded George Mason. Similar to their first matchup, neither team could generate much offense in the first half as both headed to the locker room scoreless.
GW came out of the second half firing to outshoot the Patriots 7-2, but Glad made a pair of key saves to keep GW scoreless. The Patriots pulled ahead in the 76th minute off a set piece. Despite a few last ditch attempts to score, the Colonials trailed at the final whistle.
The Colonials’ backline played a large role in their regular season success despite the loss of three graduates with more than 1,000 minutes played in 2014. The defense allowed only 15 goals – the fewest in the conference – and posted 12 shutouts in total to rewrite the history books.
Cowley netted 10 goals over the course of the season, including six game-winners to earn A-10 All-Conference First Team honors. She was joined on the A-10 All-Conference First Team by senior midfielder and defender Emily Brown, Horn and Stoller.
Stoller logged the most playing time of any player as the leader of the back line to secure A-10 Defensive Player of the Year – the first Colonial to ever do so. Senior midfielder Kristi Abbate and freshman midfielder and forward Sofia Pavon tacked onto the team’s postseason accolades with A-10 All-Conference Second Team spots. Pavon also earned an A-10 All-Rookie Team nod.

GW's COVID-19 vaccine research team plans to have a working vaccine completed by the end of 2020, researchers said at a press conference.
Officials from the School of Medicine and Health Sciences said they project to have an efficacious COVID-19 vaccine by the end of the calendar year at a press conference Wednesday.
Medical school administrators said GW is being assessed to be part of another COVID-19 vaccine trial, run by the Coronavirus Prevention Network, the segment of the National Institutes for Health that is running the current trial SMHS is conducting. David Diemert, the principal investigator for the trials and a professor of medicine, said the trials’ volunteers should be commended for pushing the research team’s work forward despite national concerns about receiving a COVID-19 vaccine once it is available.
“I have to say that we are particularly grateful for our volunteers given all of the negative press that has been floating around regarding vaccines, and they are really taking a step to volunteer and to control whether or not there will be a vaccine moving forward,” Diemert said.
He said the trial team keeps in touch with participants on a weekly basis through telehealth visits and electronic diaries. He said several of the trial’s participants have developed symptoms related to COVID-19, but just one participant has tested positive for the virus so far.
“After their second dose of vaccine, which is four weeks after the first, we are going to be in contact with them monthly through either in-person visits or telehealth visits,” Diemert said in an interview.
Half of the vaccine trial’s participants are Black or Latino, surpassing the researchers’ goal for diversity.
Barbara Lee Bass, the dean of the medical school, said the medical community is still unsure when a widespread vaccine will be available, but they’re hopeful that high-risk groups of people, like health care workers, will be able to receive the vaccine by early 2021. She said Mayor Muriel Bowser’s office has started a task force, on which an SMHS faculty member serves, to create a plan for distributing a COVID-19 vaccine once it becomes available.
“I think that most people in this business think it’s probably going to be some time 2022 before we have widespread vaccination available,” she said. “That’s kind of what I’m hearing, not necessarily based on inside knowledge by any means.”
Moncef Slaoui, the chief adviser for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ COVID-19 vaccine development initiative Operation Warp Speed, said he is grateful to the people who have participated in the trial so far.
“I really warmly thank the volunteers, the two who are with us today, but also the almost 30,000 who have participated in this particular trial of the Moderna vaccine,” he said.
Slaoui said he encourages community members to participate in the trials.
“There are six vaccines being tested, two of which are almost fully completed,” he said. “Two more are trying to restart imminently, most likely later this week, next week, and there will be two more late in December and early December.”
Wilma Capriles, a housekeeper from D.C. and a participant in the study, said she wanted to participate in the trial to help a vaccine be widely available.
“I recommend it to everybody,” she said. “I think it is safe. I think it’s good for everybody, especially for Latino people.”

Students said they appreciated the seamless nature of the University's in-house COVID-19 testing centers but worried about how the system would handle 1,500 more students next semester.
GW’s in-house COVID-19 testing center has provided quick and “reliable” services to students living on and off campus, students who have been tested said.
About 500 students who were approved to live on campus are required to test weekly and submit a symptom report to the Colonial Health Center daily while off-campus GW community members are also allowed the free testing. Ten students who have used the University’s services said the testing centers have provided them with a “peace of mind” to see friends and carry out their daily activities without worrying about spreading COVID-19.
“It gives me a huge sense of safety, especially since the cases have been very low, and GW has been super strict about the once-a-week testing,” said sophomore Abigail Ingoglia, who is living on campus.
Ingoglia said GW offers multiple appointment windows, and the test itself takes about five minutes to complete, allowing her flexibility in receiving her weekly screening. But she said she is concerned with how long test results will take to be processed next semester if more students come on campus.
Administrators said last week that 1,500 students, in addition to those currently living on campus, will be allowed back on campus next semester.
Drew Amstutz, a junior living on campus, said he is a member of the University’s Back to Campus Committee, which advises officials on their Back to Campus Plan and COVID-19 testing protocols. He said the committee consists of department heads and student leaders who communicate daily with students to gauge which aspects of campus life should be improved.
He said the committee has worked to improve accessibility to tests. At the start of the semester, on-campus students needed to use a Calendly link to make appointments, but he said officials transitioned to a CHC portal following student feedback.
He added that students originally self-administered their COVID-19 nasal swab tests, but medical professionals are now administering the tests themselves to improve accuracy. Amstutz said the University’s testing program is its “greatest strength” during the pandemic.
“I hope that they will continue this model of bringing students into the decision-making rooms when they consider other aspects of their responses to the virus and that they will actively make changes to decisions being made, like they’re doing with testing,” Amstutz said. 
Junior Lydia Burnett said she lives off campus, but her research position in the Science and Engineering Hall requires she get tested weekly. 
“There are people who shop at the grocery stores, eat at the restaurants, walk and run in the same places as students, who aren’t associated with the University,” Burnett said in an email. “We have a responsibility to them to keep the community as a whole safe and healthy.”
Testing expanded in late September to offer free service to off-campus students and GW community members at the Smith Center, which was later moved to Shenkman Hall.
She said officials should not test GW community members in Shenkman because people need to enter and exit the screening area through the same set of stairs. She said a different location could decrease contact with people who could have contracted the virus.
“Symptomatic/exposed patients and asymptomatic patients are tested in the same room, which meant for me personally that I was more likely to be exposed while getting tested than anywhere else in my daily routine,” Burnett said. “In the Smith Center, at least we had one-way traffic, but in Shenkman, you had to go down the stairs and then back up.”
Sophomore Lily Vassalo, who lives off campus, said she rides horses professionally and has stayed overnight in a hotel on multiple occasions for shows around the DMV. She said she’s been tested twice at the University’s testing center and felt the staff were helpful and accommodating during a walk-in appointment.
“I’m from the south,” Vassalo said. “A lot of my friends are at [Florida State University], and they have cases all over the place, which is not good. And I think GW has definitely done a good job making testing not only accessible but at no cost to both students who are on campus and off campus.”
She said CHC nurses who administered the tests walked her through the screening process, which made her feel comfortable. 
“It makes us feel better because we at least know that we can say to ourselves, we’ll get tested anytime we have to go travel for work and stay at a hotel room or we’ll get tested like once a month or something like that,” Vassalo said. “It’s always knowing that we can continue to get those results.”

Ariel Santikarma, a senior majoring in anthropology, and Carolyne Im, a junior majoring in political communication, are members of the Asian Pacific Islander Desi American Alliance.
The world has changed since students began advocating for an Asian American studies minor in spring 2017. 
Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Asian and Asian American students at GW have borne witness to growing anti-Asian xenophobia. Across the country, we have been forced to recognize the instability of the Model Minority Myth. Politicians have used the coronavirus and deeply embedded anti-Asian sentiment to advance anti-immigrant, exclusionary nationalist, anti-Black and White supremacist rhetoric. Still, Asian Americans remain stereotyped as apolitical, quiet and submissive subjects in the United States. 
Today, Asian American students and faculty at GW are resisting these stereotypes, all while the University neglects to recognize our histories and cultures. An Asian American minor would help change that, and we must push for it through this petition.  
“Given these numbers, it makes sense to create a program that speaks to Asian American perspectives, faculty say. But that program has been conspicuously absent despite years of advocacy.”
Many Asian American students at GW come from decades of lived experiences in which our histories are distorted or untold. We come to GW, an institution that claims to care about diversity and intellectual progress, to look for accurate and timely knowledge about Asian American history, but we find next to nothing: no programs, no centers, no institutional support – only student-led advocacy and community.
Professors Patricia Chu and Dana Tai Soon Burgess are intimately involved in advocating for the creation of an Asian American studies program. For years, they have been in talks with officials, and in the spring semester of 2020, they submitted a proposal for a minor. Since then, the administration has requested that they demonstrate student interest in and the academic importance of the minor by Oct. 26. 
Today – and for the past three years – student organizations and leaders from across campus are advocating for access to our own histories, recently converging as the Asian Pacific Islander Desi American Alliance. Asian American history is American history and is world history. The University must support and implement an Asian American studies minor to support the student population in both personal and intellectual growth. 
In the 2019-2020 academic year, Asian American students made up about 10 percent of the population, the largest racial minority on campus. In the same year, Black students made up 10 percent of the student population, Hispanic students 8.7 percent and Native students 0.18 percent. 
Given these numbers, it makes sense to create a program that speaks to Asian American perspectives, faculty say. But that program has been conspicuously absent despite years of advocacy.
Aaron Datta, a junior studying economics and international affairs and a leader in the Asian American Student Association, said Asian American studies – as well as all humanities and social sciences – matter because regardless of one’s field of study, one must understand themselves in a social context. 
Datta said University President Thomas LeBlanc’s push to increase funding for STEM and decrease funding for the humanities hurts all students. 
“What people miss when they purely look at STEM is that it doesn’t exist in a vacuum,” they explained. “It’s affected by culture and people. If we don’t take time to understand how people think and evolve and treat each other, then we won’t be able to understand STEM.”  
While GW positions itself as an institution of higher education that competes with a multitude of private, elite universities across the United States, its own peer universities have surpassed it in recognizing the importance of Asian American histories. New York, Syracuse and Tufts universities and the University of Southern California  – all peer institutions – have robust Asian American studies programs. GW is severely lagging in their lack of attention and care for ethnic studies and the student population it services. 
Asian American studies is critical for an institution that prides itself on preparing well-rounded students who can understand and conquer complex challenges in global politics, STEM, policy and the private sector. The question, then, is not only what we would gain, but what we have been missing. The absence of an Asian American studies program is a grave failure on the part of the University and we urge the administration to understand the importance of and implement this program for the sake of all students.

For many students, poor internet connections and feelings of isolation are pushing them to find housing in D.C.
GW might be online for the academic year, but some students are heading to D.C. for a semblance of campus as they continue remote learning.
More than 10 students said they plan to move to D.C. before the start of the spring semester in hopes of spending time with their friends and living in the city – some for their first time during college. Students said they feel “isolated” studying at home during the pandemic, but moving to the District in the spring could help them overcome difficulties with keeping in touch with friends, focusing and staying motivated.
Sophomore Bethany Sheehan, a public health major living in Lowell, Massachusetts, said officials denied her application for on-campus housing in the fall. Since moving home, Sheehan said she feels she has lost her “independence” and misses the freedom to make her own choices, like buying and preparing her own meals.
“It would be nice to be able to see people instead of being stuck in my house all the time,” she said.
“I feel so alone just being at home and doing all these classes.”
Sheehan, who will reapply for spring on-campus housing, said she plans to search for apartments to rent in the D.C. area in case officials decline her application. She said her friends could motivate each other to remain focused on assignments if they all live together in D.C.
Officials said the 500 students currently living on campus will continue living in their residence halls next semester, and an additional 1,500 students will be granted a housing assignment. Administrators said students will be notified by mid-November if their request for housing is approved, and officials will select the new residents via lottery if the applicant pool exceeds 1,500.
“I wish I had someone who would just motivate me and keep me focused on school when I know I have stuff to do,” Sheehan said. “And I know a lot of my friends have similar problems. They also have trouble with the focus and get distracted when they’re trying to do assignments, and I feel like it’s a big thing that we can help each other out with.”
Sophomore Brianna Hawley, a graphic design major living in New Jersey, said she plans to apply for on-campus housing in the spring in hopes of regaining access to facilities like desktops and printers she can use for schoolwork in the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design.
She said she misses the community Corcoran students had at GW before the pandemic when they could collaborate and discuss projects in person after class. Hawley said students now have to work from different time zones and spend up to four-and-a-half hours working on projects via Zoom, but she hopes her move to D.C. will help her access the resources she needs to complete projects.
Students working on capstone projects may receive limited access to the school’s labs and studios if they are approved for on-campus housing.
“As many of us have moved up in our major, we have to take an elective that requires specific equipment, for example, like printmaking or ceramics,” she said. “You can’t really do that at home. So I’m not sure how GW’s going to accommodate in the future.”
Alex Rainey, a freshman from Norfolk, Virginia, and a member of the women’s rowing team, said she applied for housing for the fall but declined offers to live on campus to save money. She said she’s since struggled to cope with poor internet connection and social separation from her new teammates while working from home.
About half of the women’s rowing team is living in Foggy Bottom this fall as the team awaits the start of its season next semester.
Rainey, who hopes to live on campus in the spring, said she’s applying for priority and athletic housing and searching for potential Airbnbs in Arlington, Virginia, if her housing applications are declined.
“I need to be on campus and be with my friends and actually get to know people just because it’s so hard,” she said. “I feel so alone just being at home and doing all these classes.”
Chloe Stemler, a sophomore from Arcata, California, majoring in political science, said she will live in an apartment in Dupont Circle next semester after dealing with internet shutdowns earlier this year amid nearby wildfires that have spread across the West Coast.
Stemler said her family had to disconnect her home Wi-Fi for fire safety precautions, but most of her professors did not respond to her emails explaining why she was unable to submit class assignments online. She said the University should implement a policy that requires professors to accommodate students struggling with internet connectivity.
“For a lot of people that are still living at home, things like that have been happening, and I feel like professors don’t even care,” Stemler said.
She said she has been living in an Airbnb with her freshman year roommate in Evanston, Illinois, for the past few months, but she hopes to return to D.C. to feel more “connected” to the GW community. Stemler said she hopes to get an internship on Capitol Hill in the spring and wants to be in D.C. to have “as normal of an internship as possible.”
“It’s why I chose GW,” she said. “The idea of being anywhere but there for college is just really crappy.”

Pre-law students said they're concerned about the quality of resources administrators are advertising to replace Deborah Baker, the pre-law adviser laid off this summer. 
Despite the resources GW continues to offer pre-law students to navigate law school applications, students say the resources are inadequate without an adviser dedicated to assisting them.
Amid the financial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, Deborah Baker, the senior academic adviser for pre-law students, was let go as part of a slew of layoffs. Officials have proposed resources – like advising appointments with a Columbian College of Arts and Sciences adviser with a Juris Doctorate and application assistance from GW Writing Center consultants who are “familiar” with the law school application process – but students said they are being forced to rely on multiple sources of assistance instead of having a “one-on-one” experience with Baker.
A student launched a petition, which received more than 500 signatures, in September calling for officials to reinstate Baker.
“The resources are not really an adequate replacement for an actual individual who can sit down with students and guide them one-on-one.”
Gilda Mossadegh, the director of undergraduate and pre-professional academic advising, said all the resources officials sent out resources in an email to pre-law students earlier this month have previously existed.
Advisers for the Elliott School of International Affairs will provide students and alumni of the school with a “list of resources and contacts” that will “guide” them through the law school application process, according to the email. GW Law officials will also hold live sessions with advice on the application process to support pre-law students, and officials from GW Law Student Enrichment Services are working to create a mentorship program between pre-law students and current students and alumni of the law school, the email states.
Mossadegh said the only change to the resources available for students is that officials from the Elliott School will also provide pre-law advising for its own students and alumni.
“Pre-law students and alumni have responded positively to the comprehensive range of resources that are available to them from the exploration stage to the application and acceptance stage of their law school admissions journey,” she said in an email.
Officials will also allow about 50 pre-law sophomores and juniors to have “early access” to Career Connect, which will allow the students to speak with alumni who are working in the legal field and can provide career guidance, the email sent to students states.
Provost Brian Blake said in September that his office ran a study during the summer to determine the efficiency of several academic units at GW, including its advising structure. He said he made the “hard decision” to decrease the ratio of undergraduate students per adviser to 220-to-1, which he said is still better than the national average but “more in line with what we can afford.”
Junior Yasmin Maleki, a religious studies major and the public relations director for the Pre-Law Students Association, said she relied on GW’s pre-law adviser as a freshman to help decide which major to declare as she seeks law school after graduation.
Maleki said Baker could look at a student’s application “as a whole,” whereas the other pre-law resources available to students involve multiple people that students have to rely on.
She said advisers with a J.D. may not be as “trained” and “knowledgeable” about the law school application process as a pre-law adviser. She said she feels “lost and nervous” about the application process going forward without a specific pre-law adviser to rely on.
“I definitely wish there was someone I could talk to,” she said. “Nobody really knows what they’re doing.”
Sophomore Karina Ochoa Berkley, a political science and philosophy major who started the petition calling for officials to reinstate Baker, said she has “yet to be convinced” that she should have confidence in GW’s pre-law advising resources.
“As opposed to making a functional replacement for Debbie, they’re just scrapping all of these pre-existing services that they already had and trying to push it as this new pre-law organization,” Berkley said.
She said officials seem to be willing to compromise the quality of their pre-law advising resources to make budget cuts, which she finds “concerning” when many students at GW are interested in going to law school and rely on these resources.
Puja Samant, a sophomore majoring in economics and political science and the events director for PLSA, said Baker was an “incredible” resource and it is “essential” for officials to provide guidance for pre-law students, especially because GW in particular “attracts so many.”
“The resources are not really an adequate replacement for an actual individual who can sit down with students and guide them one-on-one,” she said.
Samant said she plans to take advantage of the resources that officials have developed for students but said students still need a pre-law adviser who can help students “one-on-one” with their unique needs.
She said even though there are advisers at GW who have J.D.s, they won’t be as beneficial as Baker because pre-law advising isn’t their “primary” responsibility.
“Having a pre-law adviser who’s dedicated to this role and dedicated to keeping active pre-law listservs and actively working with students who want guidance I think is really useful,” Samant said.

The Marvin Center's current name has sparked controversy since officials dedicated the building to former University President Cloyd Heck Marvin in 1971.
In February 1935, members of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan issued a letter to then-University President Cloyd Heck Marvin, thanking him for refusing admission to civil rights activist David Carliner.
Marvin returned his own letter to the KKK, thanking them for their message and citing the need to free the University “from propaganda of all types.” Marvin’s brief exchange with the KKK is documented through one of several historical materials the Special Committee on the Marvin Center Name shared with the GW community earlier this month as officials consider renaming the student hub.
“The University likes to focus on the good, like increasing the endowments and doubling the size of the student body and tripling the size of the faculty. That’s what they talk about, but that had a dark side to it.”
The documents help illustrate the longest-serving GW president’s segregationist policies that prevented Black students from enrolling at the University until 1954. Special committee members are reviewing the materials, which include Hatchet articles, Cherry Tree yearbook pages and archival documents that recount Marvin’s life and leadership, from the segregation of Lisner Auditorium in the mid-1900s to student activism against the Marvin Center name in the early 1970s.
University spokesperson Crystal Nosal said committee members have not yet decided on a recommendation regarding the Marvin Center name, but they will update the page of materials as their work progresses. She said officials decided to release the materials after attendees of a recent town hall meeting asked for more information to be released about Marvin, and administrators are accepting feedback on committees examining the building’s namesake on the Office of the President’s website.
“This supports transparency into the committee’s work and does not indicate the committee has reached a recommendation about the renaming request,” she said in an email.
Administrators established two special committees in July to investigate the Marvin Center name and the Colonials moniker, weeks after the Board of Trustees approved a framework to consider renaming requests from GW community members. Law professor Roger Fairfax chairs the committee, which also includes pairs of faculty, staff, students, alumni and advisers.
Fairfax said committee members have been meeting multiple times per week to review the materials and discuss considerations for renaming.
“I want to express my gratitude to the GW community for continuing to share their thoughts about this process,” he said in an email.
Efforts to rename buildings like the Marvin Center date back to the building’s dedication decades ago. Members of the Student Association revived the charge in 2017 and again in fall 2018, forming task forces to research the history of several building names on campus. Most recently, five student organizations launched a petition calling for several on-campus locations to be renamed because of their namesakes’ ties to racism.
University President Thomas LeBlanc is currently reviewing requests to rename Fulbright, Madison and Francis Scott Key Halls halls, the Churchill Center and the Monroe School of Government.

Alumnus Andrew Novak, who published a biography about Marvin during his senior year in 2004, received his own subheading of historical materials on the committee’s website. Novak’s research details several decades of Marvin’s “controlling” relationships with faculty and students, citing several instances of racism, anti-Semitism and censorship.
As Marvin helped the University generate success in faculty, students and finances, Novak said he also silenced leftist and anti-University sentiment on campus.
Novak said Marvin fired The Hatchet’s editorial board three times when it was editorially dependent on the University, viewing the paper as a “communist mouthpiece,” and he forbade student chapters from affiliating with national groups except for those traditionally with conservative values, like Greek, religious and military organizations.
One of Novak’s articles about Marvin’s leadership states the then-president threatened to kick GW Hillel off campus, which the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported as part of a plot to rid the school of Jewish students in 1950 after members voiced support for racial desegregation.
“The University likes to focus on the good, like increasing the endowments and doubling the size of the student body and tripling the size of the faculty,” Novak said. “That’s what they talk about, but that had a dark side to it. And that’s what my research explores.”
Novak said controversy surrounding the Marvin Center dates back to 1970, when students “seized” the University Center for three days during one of the largest protests in University history.
On the same day as the Kent State shootings, during which four anti-Vietnam War student protesters were shot and killed by Ohio National Guardsmen, students rushed the building and renamed it the Kent State Memorial Center. Demonstrators aimed to condemn the shootings, the oppression of Black people and administrators’ complicity in the war.
When administrators dedicated the student center to Marvin in 1971 through a $1 million grant from Marvin’s wife, Dorothy Betts, students walked out of the ceremony with raised fists – one shouting, “It’s the Kent State Center, and you know it!”
“In the University’s social progression to being a more open and accessible University, renaming this building the Marvin Center turned that dial back, and I think that renaming it back to the Kent State Student Center would return the dial forward,” Novak said.
Richard Polman, a 1974 alumnus and former Hatchet reporter whose article on the 1971 dedication ceremony is included in the committee’s materials, said despite students’ activism to name the center after the Kent State shootings, the University’s dedication to Marvin prompted a “culture clash” between students and administrators.
“What I wrote at the time just feels like maybe one of the first pops of smoke, and now we have the conflagration,” he said. “And what I mean by that is that now we’re getting the long overdue re-examination of what it means to name that building.”
Faculty Association President Erin Chapman, an associate professor of history, said she realized Marvin’s “totalitarian” leadership to be “even worse” than she imagined before reading the historical materials the committee released. Chapman said she, alongside several faculty members who are “astounded and horrified” at Marvin’s honored legacy, supports renaming the Marvin Center and “interrogating” the way in which the University accounts for all members of its community.
“Naming the student center after somebody who was a segregationist and a racist and anti-Semitic I think sends a really strong message that the University is either supportive of those kinds of political positions – segregation, racism, anti-Semitism, et cetera – or that it doesn’t care whether it’s perceived that way,” she said.

Few students have shown up to virtual events held by faculty in residence, a sign of "Zoom fatigue," professors said.
Faculty living in residence halls said the COVID-19 pandemic has left them trying to find new ways to build community with the dozens of students they oversee.
After officials announced the fall semester would be held online, faculty in residence assumed many of the responsibilities of the resident adviser role, tasked with creating new online events to bring the GW community together. They said they have hosted weekly virtual events like cooking lessons and academic events on the platform GW Engage but have found it difficult to engage with students.
Stewart Robinette, the assistant dean of students, campus living and residential education, said each faculty member has been assigned about 45 students each and are required to check in with students and provide mentoring on a “consistent basis.”
He said each faculty in residence is required to conduct “at least one intellectual engagement program” every two weeks, and officials have scheduled the events calendar so there are options available for students at least once a week.
“The faculty in residence program is the embodiment of the University’s commitment to promoting a sense of community among those students who are on campus and encouraging intellectual curiosity and learning beyond the confines of the classroom,” Robinette said in an email.
He said faculty are typically only responsible for the students living in their residence hall, but their responsibilities changed to meet the needs of a smaller on-campus student population. About 500 students live in District House and Shenkman and South halls this fall.
“We decided to retain the program despite a limited student population on campus because pandemic makes the need for community building even more urgent,” Robinette said.
He said the faculty in residence have been given information about the safety steps being taken for all residence halls and are part of the “testing cohort” that officials created for all on-campus students. Robinette said the program will continue in the spring.
William Youmans, a faculty in residence in Shenkman Hall and an associate professor of media and public affairs, said he has been hosting virtual Middle Eastern cooking lessons for the students in his hall. He said he has noted a drop in engagement and attendance for his events compared to last year.
“It’s an unusual semester, and everyone is exhibiting signs of Zoom fatigue,” he said.
Youmans said the move to virtual learning was a “challenging time of transition,” and he has struggled to meet as many students as usual during virtual instruction.
“Only one-fourth of the building is populated, so a lot of times I’m going in and out the building or doing laundry, and I don’t really see any students,” he said. “We don’t have the casual face-to-face encounters that I used to have as a way to meet students.”
Youmans said many students are unaware of his presence as a faculty in residence – a student once called the GW Police Department on him thinking there was an intruder in the building when Youmans was getting back late at night with his family.
“It wasn’t a big deal, but it just showed how it wasn’t a smooth transition because of the limitations of how we can hold events,” he said.
Arturo Sotomayor, a faculty in residence in JBKO Hall and an associate professor of international affairs, said no students are currently living in JBKO, but he has been assigned about 45 students from other buildings to oversee.
He said he has held virtual events this semester, like a Spanish “language cafe” for students to practice their skills in conversation and an academic mentorship workshop about graduate school admissions, which he said half a dozen students participated in.
“I have a philosophy that if we can make a meaningful impact to one resident, or 100 residents, then we have made a difference to the GW community,” he said.
Sotomayor said one of the goals of the program is to allow students to see the “human dimension” of faculty members, which he said has been difficult this year.
“I can tell you that as a faculty in residence, it’s also tremendously isolating to live in a building that is empty,” he said. “This was such a lively hall.”
Ethan Porter, a faculty in residence at 1959 E St. and an assistant professor of media and public affairs, said he has been working to provide students with academic events like guest speakers, book clubs and watch parties of political events.
“Pre-COVID, I got to know students who lived in 1959 E St.,” he said. “That’s no longer the case. I get to know students now from all over the University, which I think is a very interesting, very different slice of life at GW.”
Pauline Goul, a faculty in residence in International House and an assistant professor of French, said she has not been able to meet the students in her building this semester because there are fewer students living in the building who she would usually run into in the halls.
She said “few” students have shown up to her events this semester, but attendance is similar to that of previous years because students usually had internships or work that conflicted with her events.
“If one person shows up to a program that I do, that is on how to succeed in a class online for instance, then I’m happy because that was useful for that student, and I made a connection that day with students who was not one of my students in my classes,” she said.
