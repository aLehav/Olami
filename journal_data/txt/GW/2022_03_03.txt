The Board of Trustees has approved more volatile tuition hikes during the pandemic as GW's fixed tuition policy phases out and officials grapple with the pandemic's financial impact.
GW’s estimated cost of attendance will surpass $80,000 for most undergraduates for the first time next academic year, officials announced Thursday.
The first-year cost of attendance will increase by roughly 3.5 percent next academic year, and the sticker price for continuing students who do not qualify for fixed tuition will increase by 4.5 percent if they will live on campus and 4.6 percent if they will live off campus. Fixed tuition remains in effect for undergraduates who enrolled at GW before fall 2020, but all other undergraduates will see an annual tuition increase from $59,780 to $62,110 for the upcoming year – a 3.9 percent jump.
“The actual cost of attendance varies for each student depending on the degree program, type of campus housing, meal plan and other factors including books and personal expenses,” officials said in an email.
Updated graduate program costs are expected to be announced later this spring.
Officials had typically increased tuition by about 3 percent annually, but the pandemic-era hikes have included more volatility, with next year’s larger tuition jump following just a 2.1 percent increase in place this academic year.
The Board of Trustees voted more than two years ago to phase out GW’s fixed tuition policy for undergraduates entering in fall 2020 or later, a move experts said would align GW with its peer schools and enable more-sudden shifts to meet revenue needs.
As more students enroll without fixed tuition, GW’s tuition hikes have so far have fluctuated more than in recent years as officials also grapple with the financial impacts of high inflation rates and enrollment shifts caused by the pandemic.
This academic year, only sophomores’ estimated cost of attendance clocked in above $80,000. But starting in the fall, the sticker price for continuing undergraduates who don’t qualify for fixed tuition will grow to $86,500 for those living on campus and $85,200 for those living off campus. The estimated cost of attendance for incoming first-years will be $82,570.
Jay Goff, the vice provost for enrollment and student success, said officials do not expect major enrollment changes this coming year with the added costs due to the increase of financial aid packages. He said officials hope to bring in a first year class of 2,550 students, roughly the same as the class entering in fall 2021. 
“We don’t anticipate any significant changes in enrollment due to the cost increases.” Goff said in an interview. “And that’s largely due to the fact that we will also adjust financial aid packages to assist students with higher financial need.”
Goff said officials looked at costs affected by inflation “across the board” when calculating the tuition increase. He said officials studied aspects of GW’s expenses like personnel, services and utilities to determine which costs were affected by inflation.
Officials have looked to provide more aid for students in recent months, leveraging the end of the University’s bicentennial to kick off a focused fundraising initiative, dubbed “Open Doors,” to provide an additional $2 million annually to Pell-eligible students.
GW has also advocated for the federal government to double the Pell Grant maximum award alongside hundreds of universities nationwide. President Joe Biden called on Congress in his State of the Union address on Tuesday to increase the cap by more than $2,000 from the current $6,495 limit.
“The University will continue to honor its commitment to provide additional need-based financial aid to assist students and families in covering year-to-year educational expenses,” officials said in the email.
Goff said the COVID-19 pandemic played a role in the increase in expenses for the upcoming academic year. He said interim University President Mark Wrighton wants officials to keep affordability in mind when creating new experiences for the student body. 
“We’re just simply trying to see if there are some creative ways that we can create more affordable living arrangements for students,” he said.
Next year’s cost of attendance is also influenced by GW’s new dining plan that is set to take effect in the fall. With officials introducing all-you-can-eat dining halls, students will choose from a range of meal plans that include varying amounts of dining hall swipes and declining balances.
The dining plan cost ranges from $5,400 to $6,200 annually for first- and second-year students, while the cost for third- and fourth-year students ranges from $3,340 to $6,200 annually, which includes an option to continue with the meal plan in place this academic year.
Room costs for first-year students will clock in at $10,320 annually, with roughly one-third expected to live in Thurston Hall this fall following renovations. Second- and third-year students are estimated to have a base room rate of $14,600 annually.
“GW will begin a transformation of Foggy Bottom dining program by introducing on-campus dining within Thurston and other residence halls to provide a more traditional residential dining experience focused on building a stronger community,” officials said.
The cost also includes the new U-Pass fee, which grants students unlimited Metro rides for $100 per semester.

Williamson said in an interview with The Hatchet that she likes to speak at colleges and universities like GW because students have newer ideas to address current political and social problems.
Former U.S. presidential candidate Marianne Williamson discussed how the younger generation can shift the current political climate in the United States during a town hall at the University Student Center Amphitheater Tuesday.
Williamson spoke about the role of spirituality in American politics, how to shape the next generation of political leaders and some of her main takeaways from her presidential campaign, which drew about 50 attendees. GW’s chapter of Young Democratic Socialists of America hosted the event, which was moderated by junior Carly Shaffer, the YDSA chapter president.
In an interview with The Hatchet before the event, Williamson said she decided to visit campus and connect with students because the United States is in a “very critical moment” with issues like the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and young people can provide a new perspective for elected officials to break from a “20th-century thinking.”
“It’s about how we’re all coming out of COVID, and new conversations are in the air,” she said in the interview. “Obviously, I respect a school like GW. I mean, I respect it for obvious reasons. But this isn’t to me about some selection of place. It’s about the opportunity to speak with people, particularly people at a time like this.”
She said the United States needs a political “revolution” for politics to focus more closely on people’s “emotional” and “spiritual” well-being instead of protecting corporate or property rights. She said the Republican and the Democratic parties fail to offer real solutions to reform America’s economic and health care systems.
“My own personal perspective on this politically is that the Republican Party represents a total nosedive, and the Democratic Party represents a managed decline,” she said. “But both are based on tweaking a world that is essentially and fundamentally unworkable – a paradigm that is essentially unworkable.”
After campaigning for president during the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, she now views the Democratic Party as “corrupt” and divided between “corporatists” like President Joe Biden and “progressives” like herself or former presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. But she said young progressives should not give up on centrist Democrats, citing Biden’s recent Supreme Court nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson, who would become the first Black, female associate Supreme Court justice if confirmed.
“The majority of American people want Medicare for All,” she said at the event. “The majority of American people want to raise the minimum wage. The majority of American people want to cancel the college loan debt – at least to some extent, they do. The majority of American people want free college. And yet progressives are consistently treated like errant children who just don’t understand.”
Williamson said more students who major in political science and the humanities should run for political office after they receive their degree. She said left-leaning leaders and political parties are not encouraging young people to run for political office enough, instead favoring older or more experienced figures.
“I meet a lot of people who are studying political science but aren’t making the real quick jump to, ‘and then I’m going to run for office,’” she said. “And part of that is the problem on the left that we haven’t been preparing people for that.”
Williamson said she likes to speak at colleges and universities like GW because students have newer ideas to address current political and social problems. She said the political establishment is trying to push forward policies that are outdated and will not apply well to the modern world or economy.
“One of the reasons I find talking to college students so interesting is because they’re not 20th century people – even those who were born in the 20th century were just born at the tail-end,” she said in an interview with The Hatchet before the town hall. “And 21st-century people should not be affected by bad ideas leftover from a previous time.”
Williamson spoke at GW in the fall of 2019 during her presidential campaign, where she outlined many of her policies, including promising slavery reparations and wiping out federal student debt. She said she likes speaking at GW and in the District because she can see the contrast between the social and political issues within the federal government and the younger students who will eventually run for political office.
“This town is the world headquarters for some of the worst things going on on this planet and some of the best things going on on this planet,” she said.

Burchfield, who received his doctorate degree from the law school in 1979, said attending the school was “one of the best decisions” he’s ever made.
A GW Law alumnus donated $4.5 million Monday to support free speech and First Amendment law education at the law school.
The donation – provided by Bobby Burchfield, who also teaches as a professional lecturer of law – will fund the creation of a new professorship and the recruitment of a scholar with national recognition to teach the concentration. Burchfield endowed the professorship through the Burchfield Family Charitable Foundation – the largest donation the foundation has ever made in its more than 15-year history, according to a University release.
“I have been very fortunate, and I gained so much in law school,” Burchfield said in the release. “I got a great education, made life-long friends and have been able to practice with some of the best and brightest lawyers of my time.”
Burchfield, who received his doctorate degree from the law school in 1979, said attending the school was “one of the best decisions” he’s ever made.
Burchfield, who served as the editor in chief of the GW Law Review during his time at the University and delivered the address at the 2015 Law Commencement, according to the University release.
GW Law Dean Dayna Matthew said that the donation is a “game-changer” that will attract free speech experts to the law school in a move to strengthen the scholarship of its First Amendment law program.
“This is a transformative gift that will have a profound and enduring influence not only on GW Law but also on the national First Amendment discourse,” Matthew said in the release. “It serves as an example to others who wish to invest in attracting highly distinguished scholars to the GW Law faculty.”

Sen. Dasia Bandy, ESIA-U and the chair of the senate’s diversity and inclusion assembly, sponsored both resolutions on the same day when she announced her plan to run for SA president.
The Student Association Senate passed a pair of resolutions to advance efforts to promote inclusion with stronger financial support for refugees and a diversity course requirement for undergraduates during a meeting Monday.
Senators unanimously passed The Welcoming Campus Initiative Act to encourage officials to implement a proposal drafted by No Lost Generation GWU to make the University more accessible to students with refugee backgrounds through scholarship and mentorship programs. The senate also unanimously voted to create a University-wide general education requirement for all undergraduates to take courses focused on diversity, equity and inclusion.
Sen. Dasia Bandy, ESIA-U and the chair of the senate’s diversity and inclusion assembly, sponsored both resolutions on the same day she announced her plan to run for SA president, hoping to revamp the student experience with expanded inclusive initiatives, like new bias testing requirements.
SA President Brandon Hill – a co-sponsor of The Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Education Requirement Act – said he is working with officials and faculty to establish a new course requirement by next fall in the aftermath of a string of racist and anti-semitic attacks that have taken place on campus since 2018.
“It falls in line with our market basket schools,” Hill said at the meeting. “We also have some of the lowest general education requirements of our market basket schools in comparison, and this has been in the works for about three years now.”
Senior Olivia Issa, the president of No Lost Generation, said The Welcoming Campus Initiative Act provides a “holistic approach” toward sponsoring domestic and international students with programs that can ultimately streamline their application process. She said the initiative would fund scholarships for students with refugee status and provide applicants with mentors – provisions that serve as “pathways” for students trying to achieve citizen status in the United States under adverse conditions with about 26 million refugees worldwide, including more than one million who have fled Ukraine under the Russian invasion.
“This is really important to me seeing as this has affected my family in the past and is why I’m here today,” Issa said at the meeting. “On a statistics level, this is really important to me, because in the world there are over 26 million refugees and that number is growing on a daily basis as we see in Afghanistan and Ukraine. And only 1 percent of that 26 million people are resettled every year into safe countries.”
The resolution states that other higher education institutions currently offer scholarships for refugee students, including Columbia University and the University of California-Irvine. More than 10 students with refugee backgrounds spoke during the meeting’s public comment session to urge senators to pass the resolution, saying that a scholarship fund would help bring more students with refugee statuses to GW.
The senate voted to allocate nearly $27,000 to the South Asian Society for their South Asian Heritage Celebration that will take place in March in University Yard. The funding will cover the rental cost of U-Yard and booking hip-hop artist Abhi the Nomad as a performer and alternative rock singer Sameer Gadhia as a speaker.
The senate unanimously voted to allocate more than $21,000 to TEDxFoggyBottom to cover costs to book speakers and venues for their upcoming conference next month. Sophomore Ignacio Gomez, the operations director of TEDxFoggyBottom, said the organization is hosting their events in Daughters of the American Revolution Constitution Hall instead of Lisner Auditorium because of scheduling conflicts with GW Events and Venues.
Senators voted to grant the Students Music Coalition nearly $12,700 for the club’s first Put Me On Festival, which will highlight different GW artists that work in visual, fashion and music disciplines with art displays, according to the group’s presentation.
The senate also passed the Financial Reform Act to replace the existing financial bylaws with a Code of Financial Policies, a separate governing document that includes all of the SA’s financial policies and regulations. The Office of the Legislator General filed a complaint in the Student Court last month opposing updates to the finance bylaws by alleging that imposing sanctions on student organizations is unconstitutional.
SA Sen. Yan Xu, ESIA-U and defendant in the case, said in his motion to stay the court’s decision on the case that the Financial Reform Act will resolve the issues the Office of the Legislator General cited in their complaint. The sections on sanctioning and fining student organizations that the plaintiffs claim are unconstitutional have been struck from the Code of Financial Policies, according to the legislation.
The next senate meeting will be held March 7 at 8:30 p.m. in the University Student Center’s Continental Ballroom.

The A-10 conference tournament which starts next week and will be played at Capital One Arena in Washington D.C.
Men’s basketball finished out their home schedule in dramatic fashion with a triple overtime win over Duquesne on Wednesday night.
The Colonials (12-16, 8-8 A-10) looked like a shell of themselves for stretches, but pulled out a 98-93 win over the Dukes (6-22, 1-15 A-10). GW sophomore guard Joe Bamisile and Duquesne freshman guard Jackie Johnson III both set career-highs with 30 points to lead their respective teams.
“That was a fun basketball game,” head coach Jamion Christian said. “I don’t think we particularly executed great, but you know, it’s good to find a way and that’s the kind of resiliency I think our team has had through the year.”
Bamisile also had seven rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block in a career high 49 minutes while Johnson had four rebounds, two assists and two steals in 38 minutes.
This was the Colonials first overtime game since Dec. 14, 2020, a 85-84 loss to William & Mary. The last time GW went to triple overtime was a 4OT thriller against Davidson Jan. 29, 2020 that resulted in a 107-104 Colonials victory.
The night started out with the honoring of the five members of the team set to graduate this spring: senior guard Amir Harris, senior forward Ricky Lindo, graduate student guard Bryan Knapp, junior forward Miles Gally and senior guard Theofanis Stamoulis.
Those players all started the game, with Harris and Gally both scoring baskets before they went to the bench. Gally, a walk-on, hit a three pointer to put GW up 5-0 and the GW bench erupted.
“I think beyond basketball, people don’t understand how close we are as a team,” Bamisile said. “Like I understand that we’re all here to win games and stuff. But I think when you can just enjoy being around a person, it makes the experience that much better.”
After the regular starters came into the game, both teams settled in. The Colonials looked stagnant on the offensive end, although they found success when they had players backdoor cutting to the basket and driving into the lane.
Bamisile was quiet for most of the first half, with only four points heading into the final media timeout of the first half, when GW trailed 26-21. But after the timeout Bamisile scored seven points to spearhead a 9-2 run heading into the intermission, where GW led 30-28.
Throughout the first half the Colonials tried to pull away with slim leads but the Dukes didn’t let them. Duquesne had seven steals at halftime on eight GW turnovers.
The ball security issues continued for GW in the second half and all three overtime periods as they finished with 19 turnovers on 15 Dukes steals, amounting to the highest number of turnovers all year and the highest number of steals by an opponent all year.
“This was really just a test for us and a test for our young basketball team,” Christian said. “Can you go out and play an opponent better the second time you play them? It was really that simple. You know, we certainly didn’t do that. We still found a way to win.”
The teams went back and forth throughout the second half, with GW struggling to get scoring from anyone but Bamisile, who accounted for 12 of the team’s 29 second half points.
GW looked to be in control as the game approached the final media timeout, leading 54-48 with 4:18 remaining. But for the second game in a row the Colonials let up 10 plus points in the final four minutes of the second half.
This time the result was an 11-5 run for Duquesne to end regulation. The team needed a pair of Bamisile free throws with 10 seconds left to send the game into overtime.
Junior guard James Bishop was quiet during regulation, as he has been for the past few games. In 26 minutes tonight, Bishop only had four points on 1-of-6 shooting from the field to go along with a rebound and a block.
But in overtime the Baltimore native exploded for 19 points, two assists and a rebound in 15 minutes, including a perfect 3-of-3 from beyond the arc.
After the Colonials controlled much of the first overtime, the Dukes crawled back into it. Duquesne tied it up and Bishop responded with a three pointer to give GW a 71-68 lead with 12 seconds remaining in the first overtime.
But graduate student guard Davis Larson responded seven seconds later with an equalizing three ball to send the game to a second overtime.
In the second overtime it was Duquesne who was in control as they led 79-74 with 2:03 remaining in the period.
Lindo excelled for much of the game, finishing with a 12-point, 14-rebound double-double before fouling out with 2:56 remaining in the second overtime. The Colonials got back into the game thanks to composed free throw shooting and a clutch corner three from freshman guard Brayon Freeman late in the second OT.
With 15 seconds left in the second overtime and GW trailing 81-79, it was graduate student guard Brendan Adams’ turn to showcase his free throw shooting ability. After getting fouled on a layup attempt, Adams sank both free throws and the Dukes missed a three pointer at the buzzer to send the game to a third overtime.
After the Dukes took an 85-83 lead just over a minute into the final overtime period, the Colonials took the lead back after a Bamisile-and-one dunk after which he made the free throw.
“When I hit a tough shot, a piece of me just smiled,” Bamisile said. “But then also I knew we could win the game. So I was just having a lot of fun.”
GW has clinched a single digit seed in the Atlantic 10 tournament for the first time since the 2016-17 season and their 8-5 record at home is their first home winning record since the 2017-18 season.
The Colonials finish out their season with a visit to Fordham on Saturday at 2 p.m. With a win GW can lock up the seven seed in the conference tournament, which starts next week and will be played at Capital One Arena in Washington D.C.

With hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing from Ukraine, here’s some organizations springing into action to provide humanitarian assistance.
In the midst of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, consider supporting organizations providing Ukraine with humanitarian assistance, aiding Ukrainian refugees, promoting Ukrainian culture and documenting the war.
Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine last week, hitting cities with missiles and artillery as Russian forces advanced toward Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. The Russian military has inflicted hundreds of civilian casualties and injuries, and half a million Ukrainians have fled Ukraine in less than a week.
Here’s a list of organizations the GW community can donate to, volunteer with or visit to support Ukraine:
Nova Ukraine: Nova Ukraine is a nonprofit spearheading more than a dozen active projects aimed at aiding Ukraine, ranging from humanitarian assistance to cultural awareness. The organization launched ongoing humanitarian assistance projects, including a project providing Ukraine with more than $100,000 worth of supplies for the nation’s COVID-19 response, a program that provides medical supplies to Ukrainian soldiers who suffered spinal injuries and an initiative that gathers donations for vulnerable Ukranians. Donate to the organization via check, PayPal or cryptocurrency or opt to volunteer for the organization.
Revived Soldiers Ukraine: Revived Soldiers Ukraine supports wounded Ukrainian soldiers, providing medical supplies and devices like medication, prosthetics and wheelchairs. The organization funds many Ukrainian veterans’ medical treatment, including surgeries and medication and offers rehabilitation services to veterans suffering from neurological injuries at the organization’s rehabilitation center in Ukraine. To support the organization, join their Patreon, name them as your preferred nonprofit on Amazon through the Amazon Smiles program or donate on PayPal.
UN Refugee Agency: The UNHCR was established in 1950 to support refugees, asylum seekers and internally displaced persons. The organization began operations in Ukraine more than 25 years ago and has supported Ukranians fleeing from conflict with Russia and pro-Russian separatists since 2014. The UNHCR helped repair thousands of Ukranian households damaged during conflict in Eastern Ukraine, provided hundreds of thousands of humanitarian supplies to Ukrainians impacted by the conflict and currently assists governments welcoming Ukrainian refugees. Donate to UNHCR or become a UN Volunteer.
International Rescue Committee: The IRC was founded in 1933 to support the victims of humanitarian crises. IRC teams in Poland are assisting Ukrainian refugees, and the IRC is partnering with local organizations in Ukraine to respond to the crisis. Additionally, the IRC launched a petition Tuesday urging President Joe Biden’s administration to grant Ukrainians temporary protected status, which would allow Ukrainians working in the United States to stay without the risk of deportation while conflict continues. Sign the IRC’s petition, make a donation, start a fundraiser or volunteer to support the IRC.
The Kyiv Independent: The Kyiv Independent was founded just months ago after the Kyiv Post owner fired the entire staff over a disagreement about editorial independence, leading the staff to found The Kyiv Independent to fulfill the Kyiv Post’s mission of independent journalism. Currently, The Kyiv Independent’s journalists are covering the invasion of Ukraine and documenting the war with live updates on their website. Become a patron of the publication on Patreon or donate to the publication’s GoFundMe page.
Ukraine House: Ukraine House is a nonprofit that promotes Ukrainian culture and heritage through events hosted at its location in Kalorama Heights. The organization has hosted screenings of Ukrainian movies, concerts by Ukrainian bands, holiday celebrations and art exhibits. The organization is currently hosting an art exhibition called “Remembering the Revolution of Dignity and the lives of the Heavenly Hundred,” featuring 40 pieces of Ukrainian-made artwork celebrating Ukraine’s Maidan Revolution, a series of pro-reform and pro-European Union protests that occurred in late 2013 and early 2014. Follow the organization on Facebook @ukrainehousedc or attend an event at their base, 2134 Kalorama Rd. NW, to support Ukraine House.

GW’s squad fell behind for much of the game but surged to a victory over the Bonnies.
Women’s basketball took down St. Bonaventure to advance past the first round of the Atlantic 10 Conference Championship Wednesday afternoon.
The No.12 seeded Colonials (12-17, 4-11 A-10) knocked out the No.13 seeded Bonnies (12-16, 4-12 A-10) in a 54-49 comeback victory at St. Bonaventure. After a strong start to the game, the Colonials found themselves stumbling behind before they came roaring back in the fourth quarter to send St. Bonaventure packing.
Graduate student guard Kyara Frames led GW on offense, racking up 17 points while hitting 3-of-6 from deep. Redshirt junior guard Mayowa Taiwo and freshman guard Maxine Engel also reached double figures, netting 14 and 12 points apiece, respectively.
On the other end of the court, redshirt senior guard Tori Harris and senior guard Asianae Johnson garnered 18 and 17 points each in strong individual efforts.
Engel kicked off the scoring with 8:20 left to go in the first quarter, hitting a jumper just outside the paint. Engel then came back on the next possession, hitting a 3 from the top of the arc after getting the ball from junior guard Sheslanie Laureano.
Frames pulled up and converted a jumper to stretch the lead to 7-0 with seven minutes left to go in the quarter before Johnson found her way on the scoreboard, sinking a jumper of her own. But Engel came back a few possessions later, draining a turnaround jumper off another pass from Laureano to reestablish a seven-point lead.
Engel found junior guard Essence Brown making a cut in behind to put GW up 11-2, prompting a timeout by the Bonnies’ bench with 3:23 left. Harris scored a layup out of the break, but Brown found Engel wide open at the corner for another trey.
Harris tacked on the Bonnies’ first 3-ball of the game to wrap up the quarter with GW ahead 16-9. The Colonials converted 7-of-19 from the field while St. Bonaventure cashed in on 4-of-12 attempts from the floor as they began to find a rhythm heading into the second quarter.
Despite the first quarter surge of the Colonials, the Bonnies went on a run of their own in the second frame.
Harris opened the quarter with another trey and then cut GW’s lead to two with a layup. Johnson knotted the game up on a jumper with 7:29 left in the half.
St. Bonaventure captured their first lead of the game with 5:41 on a driving layup from Johnson, prompting a timeout by Head Coach Caroline McCombs. But GW did not find their first score of the quarter until 1:34 remaining on a layup by Taiwo, finally ending a 19-0 run by the Bonnies and a Colonial scoring drought more than 10 minutes long.
GW finished the quarter trailing 23-18 while netting just 1-of-14 from the field and 0-of-5 from deep with the Bonnies 6-of-11 from the floor and 2-of-4 from beyond the arc.
Taiwo drew a foul to start the second half and converted one from the stripe to cut the deficit to four. But St. Bonaventure padded their lead on consecutive layups by junior forward I’yanna Lops.
McCombs called another timeout with 6:53 remaining after GW fell down 29-19. Engel found Taiwo making a backdoor cut for a quick layup out of the break.
After a jumper by Johnson, Frames notched her second score of the game with 5:24 left to kick off a 7-0 run by the Colonials. Taiwo added a layup on a no-look pass by Laureano before Taiwo found Laureano open outside the arc a few possessions later to cut the Bonnies’ lead to three.
Johnson answered with a jumper inside the paint, and Harris netted a jumper on the fastbreak and sank the “and one” opportunity to consolidate an eight-point lead. But Frames got going with 1:48 remaining, hitting a jumper of her own and an extra point at the line after a foul by Harris.
Brown kicked it out toward Frames on the edge of the arc on a rebound and Frames delivered a 3-point bucket. Frames returned the favor to Brown, assisting her on a layup on their net possession, but GW still trailed 41-36 heading into the final quarter.
After shooting just 7.1 percent in the prior quarter, the Colonials improved their average to 46.7 percent in the third. But the Bonnies were still firing on all cylinders, netting 77.8 percent despite not finding any looks for three point attempts.
Harris hit a corner 3, the first score of the quarter, 2:21 into the frame. Taiwo then converted a turnaround layup driving to the basket to keep the Colonials within reach behind 44-38.
Taiwo drew a foul and sank one from the line before drawing another foul, finishing a jumper through contact to bring GW within three. Each team traded a basket and Taiwo cut the lead to one with a layup on an inbound pass from Laureano with 2:24 left in the game.
Frames seized the lead for the Colonials, corralling a pass from Taiwo to nail a 3-point bucket, forcing a timeout by St. Bonaventure with 1:33 left. GW played some stout defense before Frames created some space for herself, stepping back to deliver another 3-point dagger with 18 seconds left.
Johnson finished a layup through a foul by Brown and made her extra attempt from the charity stripe to bring the score to 51-49. But Frames and Engel closed out the game with some timely free throws to survive into the next round with a final score of 54-49.
The Colonials will now take on La Salle Thursday at 1:30 p.m. in the second round. Last time out, GW conceded a narrow 62-55 defeat in the final game of the regular season on Feb. 26.

Rice Crook’s spicy Korean fried chicken bao consists of a fluffy bun, crisp vegetables and tender chicken.
Explore your culinary palette at Rice Crook, an Asian fusion restaurant serving up Korean-inspired rice bowls and bao buns.
Located in Ballston Quarter, a food hall with more than 20 dining options, Rice Crook is just a five-minute walk from the Ballston MU Metro stop. Ballston, just four Metro stops away on the Orange or Silver line, is basically foodie heaven featuring 50 restaurants in just a five-block radius, and with inventive neighbors like Ice Cream Jubilee and pierogi shop Rogi, I was excited to return to Ballston Quarter to try Rice Crook.
The restaurant was created by Chef Scott Chung, who also started Bun’d Up, a solely bao-focused restaurant, and is a co-creator of Wild Tiger BBQ, a pop-up restaurant combining southern barbecue cooking with Asian flavors. Knowing Chung was the creative mind behind Rice Crook only made me more eager to get my hands on some of the restaurant’s baos.
Rice Crook’s decor is minimalistic with simple, hanging filament lights and a wall with polaroids of their patrons. The food hall provides a relaxing environment and grants enough space to feel comfortable camping out at a table with friends for hours eating and getting into a heated discussion about whether bao buns qualify as sandwiches. The restaurant offers plenty of seating options inside, but since it was a nice day out I decided to enjoy the sunshine at some of their outside seating.
Since I was in the mood for some crispy fried chicken, I chose the spicy Korean fried chicken bao. The restaurant offers three baos for $12, so you can mix and match your order with intriguing options like Korean BBQ, mushroom and Asian spiced fried shrimp.
The buns came nestled in a row, packed full with fried chicken, slaw and green onions, served in all compostable packaging. As far as bao buns go, the dish held together well and I was able to eat with my hands without creating too much of a mess, but I do recommend grabbing a pair of chopsticks or a fork from the pickup counter for any toppings that you lose along the way.
The warm bun was fluffy and chubby, as it should be, and provided a stable base for the fried chicken and cabbage slaw. The chicken, although coated in the sweet and spicy Korean barbecue sauce, retained its crispness. The freshness of the slaw, combining both purple and green cabbage and tossed in a light but creamy dressing, was a lovely complement to the heat from the chicken.
The bao was delicious and had all the textures you would hope to find in a bao bun – a fluffy bun, crisp veggies and chicken that is both crunchy and tender. Unlike some baos I’ve tried in the past, the sauce wasn’t sickly sweet or overpowering in any way. My only critique is that the slaw could benefit from some tanginess, but this likely would have been remedied with the addition of their cilantro lime aioli, which can be asked for separately.
For those who prefer a bowl over a bao, fret not. Rice Crook serves make-your-own bowls ($12 to $13), so visitors can pick one of the bao protein choices or an additional tofu option served alongside toppings like cucumber kimchi, fried garlic and shallots.
The restaurant offers a variety of beverages and their cucumber kimchi for sale in eight- ($4) and 16- ($8) ounce options. Head to District Doughnut to satisfy your sweet tooth after your savory meal.
Take a fun afternoon excursion grabbing some friends, tasting some satisfying baos from Rice Crook and exploring Ballston.

The spring semester has been marked by harsh winter in D.C. But last Wednesday, I walked out of my residence hall to find clear skies and 75 degree warmth instead of the bitter cold and biting winds I was becoming accustomed to. When I arrived in class that afternoon, my classmates and I all shared the same wish: can’t we have class outside? We had all been enjoying the excellent weather during the day, but we each had to preempt our enjoyment and report to class. We asked our professor, who agreed that it was a nice idea, but unfortunately he had a PowerPoint presentation planned for class, and we were unable to leave the cozy confines of Bell Hall. I couldn’t help but think about how wasteful it was to sit in an artificially lit classroom when the sun was shining so brightly on our beautiful city. As the cold begins to recede, GW students should not take the little warmth we get for granted.Although winter isn’t going to be behind us for a few more weeks, professors should consider taking their students outside for a class or two this semester when we are fortunate enough to have warm weather. After all, the reason many students chose to attend GW is for its unique metropolitan location. Professors should enable students to take advantage of our great campus by conducting one or more classes this semester on warm, sunny days out in the fresh air rather than waste the nice days we have stuck inside.Not only will outdoor classes provide an opportunity for students to enjoy fresh air and sunshine, it will also give students a chance to safely and comfortably remove their masks, so that we have a truly face-to-face class for the first time since March 2020. For nearly two years we’ve been in either a virtual learning format or in a classroom but fully masked. Some of my professors have made an effort to emphasize collaborative learning, but it is certainly more difficult to get to know your classmates without getting to see their faces. While it seems that mask requirements are being scaled back in the District and around the world, holding the occasional class outside in the future will benefit voluntary mask-wearers by giving everyone an opportunity to breathe easy.Spaces like University Yard, Kogan Plaza and grassy spots like those near the entrance to Rome Hall would be perfect for an outdoor class session. Students can break their tired routines by swapping their laptops for a good old-fashioned notebook and pen and sitting in the grass or at a picnic table instead of a tiny, cramped desk. One can imagine how nice it would be: the smell of freshly cut grass, the sun on our maskless faces. We can focus on our studies and enjoy some Vitamin D at the same time.In the future, GW should create one or two outdoor classrooms, perhaps equipped with the same technology as our indoor classrooms. It would be a great resource for professors to be able to show slideshows and other class material as well as record lectures in an outdoor setting. Professors could book these spaces out once or twice a semester in the same way that students book out study spaces in Gelman Library or the University Student Center. It would be a small but meaningful piece of infrastructure that students could really benefit from directly.Like all good things, the nice weather we’ve gotten a glimpse of recently is not going to last forever. So rather than skipping class to enjoy a sunny day, we should take class out into the light. We should do ourselves a favor and take advantage of our spectacular campus and enjoy the outdoors of GW whenever we can.
