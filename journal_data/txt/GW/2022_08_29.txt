Whether your city hall resembles an office park or a hulking Brutalist masterpiece, it’s a standing symbol of the political power that rests in local government. Ahead of election season in November, states will determine the future of abortion access, rights for LGBTQ+ people and the educational material that stocks library shelves in schools in the absence of federal policy. From legislators and school boards to judges and commissioners, you might not recognize your hometown – or the people that govern it – following a decisive election when you next return. If you want to determine the future of your community, it’s time to make a plan to vote.
Whether student loan forgiveness, Title IX policies or the “Hillternships” we aspire to secure, the federal government affects our lives as college students and temporary D.C. residents each and every day. But cross the Potomac, take a train out of Union Station or catch a flight from Reagan National Airport, and you’ll find state laws that are downright strange – and in some cases, deadly serious.
After the Supreme Court voted to overturn Roe v. Wade in June, new or preexisting laws in Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Dakota and at least nine other states have banned or severely restricted abortion access. Bans on abortion in Tennessee, Texas and Idaho took effect just last week. The impact has been immediate – in the month after the Supreme Court overturned Roe, 43 clinics across 11 states stopped providing abortions. It’s also been horrific – in July, the story of a pregnant 10-year-old girl who had to travel from Ohio, which banned abortions after six weeks, to Indiana to obtain medical care sparked national outrage. And there are countless people whose states are now forcing them to carry nonviable pregnancies to term or wait until they are in dire medical need before doctors can intervene.
Many of these same states, dominated by Republican-led legislatures and governors, have also passed laws restricting transgender students’ ability to play school sports, receive transition-related medical care or use their pronouns or name in class. And bans on teaching “critical race theory” – code for anything less than a rose-tinted version of American history – have turned library shelves and lesson plans into political minefields as teachers and librarians struggle to keep up with regulations that are just as draconian as they are vague.
These attacks on our rights don’t stop there – voting itself is on the ballot. Right-wing pundits and politicians have latched onto former President Donald Trump’s election denialism to make it harder to vote. In Georgia, a new voting law has reduced the number of drop box locations where voters, especially people of color and Democrats, could previously cast their ballots.
I understand if you’ve already decided not to vote this year. Perhaps you’re hesitant to endorse a political system that is far from perfect, to put it mildly. And to some, it can seem like casting a single vote every few years will hardly make a difference – but it does. Kansas voters came out to defeat an anti-abortion measure in August, avoiding a potential total ban on abortion in the state.
It feels like we’ve heard that “this is the most important election of our lifetime” for the past six years, but the stakes really are that high. Voters in California and Vermont have the opportunity to enshrine reproductive freedom as part of their state constitutions in November, while voters in Montana and Kentucky can send a message to their elected officials – and the country – by rejecting measures to enforce fetal personhood and impede reproductive healthcare at the polls.
So how do you actually cast your ballot for the remaining five state primaries during the next two months and the general election in November? These general descriptions vary from state to state, but you’ll first want to make sure you’re registered to vote and double-check your registration if you’re already registered. From there, find your sample ballot to know what you’ll be voting for and make a plan to get to the polls. If you’d rather vote in person and live close to GW, you may be able to vote early on the weekend or a day when you don’t have classes – Virginia allows in-person absentee voting 45 days before election day.
But election day Nov. 8 isn’t a University holiday, and if you live outside the Northeast Corridor, it’s not exactly feasible to leave D.C., vote and come back in a single day. That’s where mail-in voting comes in. You may have to request a mail-in ballot several days in advance of the actual election before receiving it, or the state where you’re registered to vote may supply one to you automatically. When you do receive your ballot, simply fill it out and send it back along with any documentation, like a copy of your ID that your state may require. And make sure to send it early enough that it’s received on election day or, depending on your state’s rules, up to a week after.
It’s true that political engagement doesn’t stop and start with voting, but some of your most fundamental rights – your bodily autonomy, personhood and even the right to vote itself – are in the hands of your state government. Whether they defend these rights or increasingly assault them, the legislators that create your state’s laws and the agencies and authorities responsible for enforcing them are decided at the ballot box. So make a plan to vote, and use your voice in the streets – and at the polls – this year.

Maya Levine is a senior majoring in environmental studies and theater and a co-founder of POP!, the student-run pop-up thrift store at GW.
From the cycling jersey that once belonged to a D.C. biker to the maxi skirt entering its second life, sustainable fashion and clothing circularity are taking campus style by storm. POP!, the student-run pop-up thrift store at GW, is shaking up the secondhand clothing scene, highlighting the demand for green initiatives on campus and saving fun, trendy and fashionable clothing from winding up in the trash. We’re seizing students’ excitement for affordable, environmentally friendly fashion to sell clothing that helps them feel well-dressed in class and extracurriculars, and we’re upholding the University’s commitment to sustainability in the process. But to make sure POP! is as sustainable as the clothes it sells, we need GW to provide us with space and staff.
Since last September, POP!’s monthly pop-ups at the Textile Museum have been hugely successful with lines at the start of every event, and we’ve also participated in campus programs like President’s Weekend Palooza. But we can’t serve students who face clothing inequity between those events. The University knows this problem exists – the Diversity Climate Review recently asked students if they struggled to afford clothing, which can reveal deeper systemic issues like poverty and poor health conditions.
Students shouldn’t have to buy their clothes from fast fashion brands like H&M and Zara, tossing out their wardrobe to buy the latest pieces. These brands ignore the rights of their workers and manufacture large amounts of low-quality garments, making the fashion industry the second highest user of global water resources and emitter of 10 percent of global carbon emissions.
Unlike fast fashion, students who donate clothing to charities via the blue bins in residence halls actually contribute to the circularity of clothing – a single shirt might move from one person to another as it’s reused, repaired or repurposed. That circular movement extends its life cycle and diverts it from the waste stream, but throwing clothes into a bin mimics the waste-making process, fuels an “out of sight, out of mind” mentality and removes ownership from the item. We can do better – a sustainable fashion policy should encourage students to determine if an item is beyond repair or if it has another chance with some extra care.
We created POP! after speaking to students about sustainable fashion on campus last summer. They wanted an accessible and affordable source of clothing that aligned with their environmental consciousness. After executing six pop-ups in our first school year, we calculated our sustainability impact using data on the amount of carbon dioxide emissions and water that one pound of clothing donations saves. Last year, POP! diverted approximately 7,000 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere, saved eight million gallons of water and stopped 2,000 pounds of clothing from ending up in landfills.
Other sustainable fashion retailers in the DMV are overpriced – in Georgetown, Reformation’s least expensive pair of jeans is $38 on sale, while an average pair of jeans at POP! costs $13. If students want to access thrift stores that come close to matching POP!’s prices, the nearest option is at least a 30-minute Metro ride to a Goodwill in Virginia. College students with tight budgets and schedules can’t afford or access these stores, but they can get affordable, trendy and curated secondhand clothes right here on campus with POP!.
While the Textile Museum and the Innovation Center in Tompkins Hall provide space and storage to POP!, we need a space of our own. A permanent storage room would serve as an independent location that frees up resources and space for other students looking to use the museum or center. We would have the flexibility to organize the space based on our needs, whether that’s quick access to inventory pricing supplies or preparing to transport our materials on the day of a pop-up. With a home base for POP!, we could sustainably serve the community for years to come.
A student employee position would allow us to directly collaborate with GW, advocate for ourselves and maximize our sustainability impact. There’s precedent for a student employee position for POP! – GroW Community Garden has employed students to manage the program for more than 10 years. With the community’s confidence and our track record of success, including a $25,000 prize at the 2022 New Venture Competition for our business model, we’re ready to strengthen the secondhand clothing scene at GW.
We envision a world in which students buy their next outfit on campus, give it to another student at a clothing swap or repair it at a mending workshop. Seeing our clothes take second, third or even fourth lives within our own community will help us foster a meaningful relationship with otherwise-ephemeral objects. We can keep our clothing longer, care for it when it needs mending and think of it as an investment instead of a trend. Cultivating a culture of sharing clothing can rally us around a common cause of sustainability.
GW touts its role in shaping future changemakers who will leave their legacy on the world. If the University works with POP!, it can weave a legacy of community and clothing equity into the fabric of campus. With GW’s support, POP! can leave a lasting imprint on campus culture while reducing its footprint.

Try out classes like yoga and media in a free society if you find yourself short on credits or looking to drop a class.
Short on credits, dropping a class or searching through the registrar for the perfect addition to your fall schedule?
Almost everyone has been there, frantically searching for a last-minute course to add during the first week of classes. Here are some popular courses with high reviews that, luckily for you, still have seats open for grabbing this fall semester.
1. AMST 1100: Politics and Film
This course focuses on American films and their interaction with existing political structures and theory, known to examine titles like 1955 class commentary “All that Heaven Allows” and the recently released live-action musical production “Hamilton.” Past students have commended Professor Elizabeth Anker for her industry knowledge, clarity and personability. The course’s format involves lectures held on Monday and discussion sections on Wednesday, so students have plenty of time to access, view and analyze films.
2. LSPA 1029: Yoga
The lifestyle, sport and physical activity department offers a plethora of one-credit courses to maintain students’ fitness in a leisurely way, and its several yoga sections allow students to manage their stress and physical wellness. Several sections of yoga remain open, with hour-and-a-half-long meetings only once a week, flexible to even the busiest of schedules.
3. MATH 1007: Mathematics and Politics
Taught in the mathematics department, this course synthesizes logic and arithmetic with political constructions to unpack the interaction of social structures with mathematical thought. A student can expect to approach mathematics in a way they never could in high school, with more writing and decision analysis than any other class of its kind. The class will analyze quintessential concepts like the prisoner’s dilemma from a mathematical standpoint, learn the numbers behind the Electoral College and interpret how statistics can impact equitable representation.
4. SMPA 1050: Media in a Free Society
The School of Media and Public Affairs prides itself on its top-ranked professors and valuable, practical courses for students interested in working in the media. Dr. Sean Aday, a professor with reporting experience from The Kansas City Star and published research on the effects of local television on mass communication, teaches the course material from a position of expertise. While SMPA majors are restricted from registering, the class illuminates a new perspective on media production and mass communication in a democratic world, reinforcing the integral role of the media in a global society.
5. LSPA 1059: Cycling
In addition to yoga and several other exciting courses available, the LSPA department offers a one-credit cycling course with several seats still open – a very practical activity for D.C. residents. Taught on stationary bikes in the Milken Institute School of Public Health, the course allows students to vary resistance to their own individual levels, demonstrating the accessibility of LSPA courses.
6. GEOG 1002: Introduction to Physical Geography
If searching for a course to fulfill GW’s general education scientific reasoning requirement, necessary for all undergraduate students, Physical Geography fits the bill. Topics include weather, cartography and geology. For those who want to avoid a hard science class, this course is more reading-heavy than math-heavy and still provides students with a solid science foundation for their college career.

Eberhardt said that Black K-12 students are three times more likely to be suspended or expelled than white students.
Updated: Aug. 30, 2022 at 1:12 p.m.
An author and professor of psychology at Stanford University spoke about the science of racial bias and its consequences at an event at the School of Media and Public Affairs Friday.
Jennifer Eberhardt spoke during a GW Law event Friday in the School of Media and Public Affairs’ Jack Morton auditorium about the research behind her 2019 book, “Biased: Uncovering the Hidden Prejudice That Shapes What We See, Think, and Do.”
“Bias does its work in the shadows and in the open, reworking our brains, framing and distorting our relationships with each other,” Eberhardt said.
Eberhardt spoke about a series of experiments she conducted to reveal racial biases held by people in different areas of the workforce like police officers and teachers. She said an experiment she worked on with teachers showed that when determining punishment for students with repeat offenses, teachers were harsher on students with stereotypically Black names and viewed their behavior as a pattern they should shut down.
Eberhardt also said that Black K-12 students are three times more likely to be suspended or expelled than white students.
“Over time, Black students worry about how they might be treated in school environments and those concerns can affect their day-to-day interactions with teachers,” Eberhardt said. “And when those children grow up and they enter the workplace, their day-to-day interactions are still influenced by race.”
Eberhardt said she personally works with Oakland Police in California on ways to make it harder for bias to affect everyday interactions. She referenced her work with the department in requiring officers to question their reasoning for making traffic stops and provide more background as to why they made the stop on a form.
“If we did this by simply pushing officers to ask themselves a simple question before each and every stop they made, ‘Is this stop intelligence-led, yes or no?’” Eberhardt said. “In other words, they had to think, ‘Do I have prior evidence, prior information to tie this particular person to a specific crime?’ And if the answer was yes, they had to indicate the source of that intelligence.”
Eberhardt said after requiring Oakland officers to explain their reasoning for stops, traffic stops of Black people by the department decreased by 43 percent in one year.
Following the event, there was a short Q&A section with questions from law students, led by GW Law Dean Dayna Bowen Matthew. Eberhardt answered questions about her experiences as a mother of Black men and provided advice for people experiencing setbacks in their own journeys to prevent their underlying biases from coming to the surface. She encouraged listeners not to shy away from their own racial biases but to confront and grow from them to conclude the event.
“Through science, we understand more about how bias works than we ever have before,” Eberhardt said. “Through science, we understand how to disrupt it.”
This post was updated to correct the following:
Due to an editing error, The Hatchet incorrectly reported GW Law Dean Dayna Bowen Matthew and Associate Dean for Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Carmia Caesar attended Eberhardt’s discussion, and that it was part of GW Law’s orientation schedule. Matthew and Caesar held a separate discussion about Eberhardt’s book Friday morning. Eberhardt’s discussion was also not officially part of GW Law’s orientation schedule. The Hatchet also incorrectly spelled Caesar’s name in a previous version of this story. We regret these errors.

Bad Bunny, also known as Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, stayed true to himself at the concert while mixing his early, formative hits like “Vuelve” with his newest album, “Un Verano Sin Ti." 
Six years after breaking out on SoundCloud, Bad Bunny played a set of classic hits in front of a sold-out concert Tuesday at Nationals Park, paying homage to the birth of his career.
The Grammy-winning, Puerto Rican artist delivered on his classic sound of reguetón – a genre from Puerto Rico that blends Latin rhythms and hip-hop or rap – as he kicked off his two-hour performance with the intoxicating beat of his summer hit song “Moscow Mule.” The artist also known as Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio stayed true to himself while mixing his early, formative hits like “Vuelve” with his newest album, “Un Verano Sin Ti” against the backdrop of a brightly lit beach, reminiscent of the Puerto Rican influence that shaped his career as a reguetòn artist.
The D.C. stop of his World’s Hottest Tour featured DJ Deorro, a Los Angeles native who became a SoundCloud sensation last year, as an opener. Deorro combined Spanish rock hits from the early 2000s with reguetón music to warm up the crowd before Bad Bunny made his entrance.
A raised platform formed a walkway that sliced through the floor of the arena before meeting the foot of the stage, breaking up the different sections of the “playa” or beach section that filled the baseball field. Later in the show, palm trees, beach towels and coolers decorated the scene, simulating a typical beach afternoon in Puerto Rico.
Bad Bunny began the first leg of his show with eight songs from his new album, an emotional, intimate love letter to Puerto Rico with the Caribbean poetry that enshrines reguetón, including summer sensations “Efecto,” “Tarot,” “Me Porto Bonito” and “La Corriente.” The songs infuse modern reguetón beats with traditional reguetón from 2005 to honor the influence of his reguetón forefathers Chencho Corleone and Tony Dize.
Bad Bunny then launched into a medley of songs off his previous album “El Último Tour del Mundo” with “Ni Bien ni mal,” “200 MPH,” “La Romana” and “Estamos Bien” to flaunt his Spanish-rock reguetón sound.
The crowd around the stadium stood up and sang the lyrics at the top of their lungs, with the bleachers shaking along.
Bad Bunny’s Puerto Rican dancers’ significant use of social media stands out as part of his celebration of Puerto Rican culture. Household names like Melanie Avilés, Thony González, Karina Ortiz and Emilio Villalobos provide behind-the-scenes coverage for fans to consume.
Bad Bunny sang a hit of his from this year, “dos mil dieciseis,” which starts with the same introduction and beat Bad Bunny had been known for in his early years and led to a medley of his hit songs dating back to 2016. Reminding me of the first time I heard him back in Puerto Rico during my middle school and early high school years, a sense of homesickness overpowered me.
Bad Bunny cast a sense of nostalgia and homesickness across the audience as his songs brought a reminder of my younger years on the island where I would spend afternoons dancing and laughing with my childhood friends.
As the fast-paced “El Coco” began playing, Bad Bunny approached a small plastic island at the corner of the stage with the plastic palm tree placed center stage. He hooked himself with a rope to the giant tree that lifted him into the air to the upper levels of the crowd. There he performed the fan-favorite experimental ballad “La Cancion,” a track in his experimental collab album “Oasis” with Colombian reguetón artist J Balvin that became a fan favorite for its intimate nature.
As the concert began to come to an end, Bad Bunny took a moment to talk about regular weekly power outages that have forced the locals to find new ways to live without electricity due to the recent privatization of the electric company and lack of infrastructure for the island’s electricity grid. The serious moment shifted in a more energetic manner as he jumped into “El Apagón,” a song that spotlights the mass displacement of young Puerto Ricans to the U.S. due to the increased cost of living and the loss of public land in Puerto Rico as foreigners look to invest on the island.
“You might not know, right now in Puerto Rico, there’s hundreds of thousands of families without electricity,” Bad Bunny said to the crowd. “Hospitals without power, without electric service – it’s affecting the lives of many in Puerto Rico.”
The concert ended with this hit song, “Después de la Playa,” an urban merengue track, with the dancers swinging their hips into their merengue choreography, a type of ballroom dance from the Dominican Republic, as the fireworks decorated the sky behind the stage.
“Quiere quedarse en PR, no irse pa’ ningún estado, pero todo se ha complicado,” I sing the words reflecting every Puerto Rican in the stadium.
In English – she wants to stay in Puerto Rico, not leave for any state, but everything has become more complicated.

The barriers blocking the Virginia Avenue bike lane force cyclists to ride on the sidewalk or alongside traffic. 
A series of barriers blocking Virginia Avenue’s new-but-yet-to-be-completed bike lane has become a focal point of controversy among the local community and the District Department of Transportation about safe cycling in the neighborhood.
Locals noticed DDOT placed 10 barriers at intersections along Virginia Avenue from G to 20th streets earlier this month to block access to the bike lane in areas that still need functioning traffic signals, which would help protect pedestrians from oncoming bikers. Bikers have been seen using the bike lane since DDOT installed the path – located in the middle of the Virginia Avenue thoroughfare – in December, but agency officials tweeted around the same time that the project was “not quite complete.”
Some local leaders – like Joel Causey, the chair of the Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission – said the bike lane’s opening was unsafe and “premature” without functioning traffic signals designed to control traffic that bikers, pedestrians and motorists share on the street. DDOT has received backlash for failing to respond to calls from locals to install a traffic signal at the corner of 21st and I streets before cyclist Shawn O’Donnell died in a collision with a truck driver last month while the intersection was still uncontrolled.
“It’s a safety risk to have the bike lanes operational without the lights working,” ANC Chair Joel Causey said in an interview.
The barriers blocking the lane force cyclists to ride on the sidewalk or alongside Virginia Avenue traffic. DDOT did not immediately return a request for comment on the placement of the barriers in the bike lane or the timeline of the bike lane’s completion.
As of Sunday afternoon, Aug. 28, the majority of the barriers blocking the bike lane have been pushed out of the way for cyclists to enter and exit. Two of the structures at Virginia Avenue and D Street remain obstructing the bike lane.
Local residents and ANC commissioners have debated whether DDOT should have opened or blocked the bike lane as the project’s end date remains unclear after months of delays. The project was slated to wrap up back in March after DDOT first announced plans for the bike lane in February 2021.
Last month, the ANC unanimously voted to request that DDOT address pedestrian and driver safety along several intersections on Virginia Avenue, citing concerns over the short crosswalk signal times which they said could put elderly and disabled pedestrians at risk.
“I believe that in a rush to get the bike lanes in and claim victory for bike lanes, they failed to understand that we have constituents who are elderly,” Causey said at the meeting.
The ANC also asked for a timeline of the bike lane’s completion and a DDOT analysis of the pedestrian conditions, like crosswalk times and safety, at the avenue’s intersections.
“One of the complaints from the citizens is that they’re trying to cross there,” Causey said. “There’s no pause. Bikes are flying by at high speed, and here’s a person with a walker and a wheelchair and they have a fear of getting hurt.”
Causey said DDOT will update the ANC during its meeting in September and anticipates the barriers will remain in the bike lanes until the agency finishes installing the signals. He said bikers should remain “vigilant” in the meantime of their surroundings and exert more caution on busier streets like Virginia Avenue.
“I know this is a very passionate issue for a lot of bicyclists out there,” Causey said. “They want the lanes open, but they have to understand that it has to be done in a safe manner.”
ANC Commissioner Yannik Omictin said the barriers were an “overreaction” by DDOT because they force bikers on Virginia Avenue to either merge with traffic or ride on the sidewalk, creating hazardous conditions alongside either speeding vehicles or walking pedestrians.
“Obviously biking in traffic is very dangerous for Virginia Avenue,” Omictin said. “And biking on the sidewalk is exactly what folks were saying is not a good thing, and this is one of the reasons why we have this bike lane in the first place.”
Omictin said as of Thursday he has not been able to contact DDOT to discuss the barriers. He said while he understands the bike lanes remain incomplete, the protected bike lanes are “much safer” for residents than the alternative, even without the extended signal times.
“Just in the state it is right now, it is safer for cyclists, it’s safer for cars and it’s safer for pedestrians because there’s at least a separation,” he said.

Get crafty with some peel-and-stick wallpaper or wall collage kits to decorate your dorm room on a budget this year. 
As the school year approaches and students flock back to campus, personalized decorations can make all the difference in making your residence hall room feel like a home away from home.
For many college students, the most crucial aspect of moving into a new space – aside from the essentials – is the decor, yet the unfortunate reality is that decorations are sold for a big buck these days. We’ve identified some simple and stylish ways to create that dream room you’ve always imagined without breaking the bank.
Quick and easy DIYs
If you’re not a fan of the color of your room’s walls, peel-and-stick wallpaper is your friend. This item can be found at any craft store, Amazon or Etsy for around $25 to $40 and can spruce up any space without any damage left behind. Peel and stick paper comes in a variety of colors and patterns, making them ideal for the personal customization of your space.
Host a paint night to get to know your residence hall neighbors. Michaels and Hobby Lobby have numerous options for affordable crafts, like canvases and a multitude of high-quality paints and brushes. You’ll create some personalized paintings to hang on your walls and get a chance to get to know your roommates better or even develop some new friendships.
If wallpaper or paint isn’t your thing, a collage that reminds you of home could be the answer. Arrange your favorite polaroids, posters and more to your liking and bring that blank space to life. Many online stores like Amazon, Etsy and Target sell premade, customizable wall collage kits from $10 to $20. The kits are often categorized by their aesthetics, allowing you to find the perfect one to fit your own style.
Items that can elevate your space
If you have space under your bed that you plan to use for storage, a bed skirt is an optimal way to keep your room looking tidy. While you can find underbed storage at any home decor store, these boxes can sometimes be a bit of an eyesore. Bed skirts are perfect for maximizing storage while maintaining an aesthetically pleasing space. Simple products are typically sold for about $15 to $25 at stores like Bed Bath & Beyond, Target and Walmart.
Vases and other glassware are a must-have to make a space inviting with some fresh flowers from Whole Foods or Trader Joe’s. Browse your nearest thrift store or home decor shops, like HomeSense or Hobby Lobby, and you’ll likely find some beautiful complementary pieces to add to your space.
Eccentric accessories
Full body or some smaller, multi-shaped mirrors are an effective way to bring more natural light into a room. Try placing your mirror across from the window, and it will reflect the light across the room, making the space much brighter and larger-looking. Most home decor stores ranging from Etsy to Target make for solid mirror-shopping destinations.
As overdone as they may seem, eccentric lamps and twinkle lights that you can hang across your room are perfect for creating any desired ambience. Any campus resident will tell you that the fluorescent lighting from your room’s overhead lighting is more stimulating than it is relaxing. If you need more subtle lighting to make your space feel welcoming, then twinkle lights are perfect for you. Twinkle or LED lights are an optimal way to create a serene interior environment, twinkling along the top of your wall for a relaxing overall aura.
Throw blankets and pillows are your best friend when it comes to bed decor. To save money, buy pillow inserts from a craft store like Michaels or any dollar store, which will give you the room to spend a little more on the covers and swap out the colors and designs to compliment your room’s aesthetic if you change your mind.
