In addition to their eggplant cemita, which combines Oaxaca cheese, chipotle flavors and avocado for a satisfying meal, Taqueria Xochi also offers a chicken option.
Taqueria Xochi should be your next stop to try casual Mexican food.
Located at 924 U St. NW in the U Street corridor, Taqueria Xochi’s storefront is painted hot pink and complete with an electric light sign that spells out “Taqueria Xochi” in neon blue cursive letters. The taqueria, which is currently only offering take-out, is relatively new, launched in October by chef Teresa Padilla, who spent the last 16 years with José Andres’ restaurant company ThinkFoodGroup. 
Taqueria Xochi offers a range of authentic Mexican dishes, including tacos like the nopales cactus tacos ($13) and Mexican chorizo tacos ($13), soups like Menudo ($9/$16), a common Mexican hangover meal, antojitos – Mexican street snacks – like chicharrons ($9) and tlayudas. For vegetarians, the store prepares individual mushroom, cactus and bean tacos and a veggie tlayuda.
But the star of the restaurant is its cemitas, which Padilla long dreamt of introducing to the D.C. food scene, according to the restaurant website. A cemita is a Mexican sandwich that originated in Puebla, Mexico, and is known for its sesame seed bun, Oaxaca cheese and schnitzel-style meats called milanesa.
I opted for the vegetarian cemita ($15) given my dietary habits, but the taqueria also offers beef and chicken cemitas. The vegetarian cemita is built with eggplant milanesa, Oaxaca cheese, chipotle seasoned beans, avocado, onions, tomatoes and mayo.
At this point in the pandemic, I’ve gotten used to unassuming takeout packaging, but I was pleasantly surprised by my meal’s preparation. The cemita came wrapped in brown paper and was tied together with a tweed bow and topped with a Taqueria Xochi sticker. 
A hearty sesame bun, slightly sweet and perfectly crispy, held the contents of the sandwich – veggies, fried eggplant and mayo. The bottom had crunchy grooves from the panini press. 
The cemita held a bold combination of flavors – I first tasted the mayo, then the chipotle seasoning, gooey Oaxaca cheese, followed by the refreshing sensation of juicy tomatoes, crisp onion and chunky avocado. The eggplant milanesa – thick pieces of eggplant breaded and pan-fried – held down the bottom bun and offered a crunch to the sandwich. 
By the time I was three bites in, the sandwich began to fall apart, but I was OK with that – the best sandwiches are stuffed to capacity. For a vegetarian option, I was also left feeling pretty full.
Since I ordered on Uber Eats for delivery, the sandwich was $17.50 instead of the usual $15 price point. Either way, more than $12 for a sandwich seems a bit steep to me, but I recognize that the ingredients were exceptionally fresh and the taste was on point.  
Next time I visit, I’d like to try one of Taqueria Xochi’s special drink offerings like the mangonada ($7.50), a vibrant drink swirled with the mango flavors and chamoy – a fresh fruit dip – or the spicy margarita. 
Finish off your meal at this new spot with one of its authentic desserts like tres leches, chocoflan – a chocolate cake flan – or buñelos de viento – dough pastries topped with cinnamon and sugar.
If you’re craving authentic Mexican food but want to enjoy it on the comfort of your couch, check out Taqueria Xochi.

With a new administration taking control of the White House and Democrats controlling Congress for the first time in a decade, it is now time for President Joe Biden to tackle the biggest threat to young Americans: the cost of college.
Total student loan debt topped $1.6 trillion in 2020, and the problem will only continue to grow. College represents an opportunity to expand horizons, or more realistically, to secure a job. But earning that opportunity is frequently reserved for the wealthiest Americans as the cost of college tuition continues to soar. But his administration has the power to stop student debt from entirely getting out of control by making public colleges and universities free.
Biden has already made commitments to address the student debt crisis. In one of his first moves after being sworn in, Biden extended the freeze on student loan payments. On the campaign trail, he vowed to make the student debt crisis a national priority and showed unsteady support for potentially forgiving up to $10,000 in student loans. He also joined Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in pledging to make public colleges free for students whose family incomes are below $125,000 each year.
Making college free is a good idea, but it should not be limited by a family’s income level. Biden should support legislation to make public college free for all students and put an end to the student loan crisis.
While college is meant to provide greater opportunity, the cost of college has continued to rise exorbitantly, and the median income of college graduates is stagnant. If college no longer opens doors for students and creates economic opportunities, it should not continue to cost more each year. But the rising cost of college has made it impossible for students to believe in a future where they can purchase a home, live comfortably or start families, because they know they will be burdened with student debt.
Student debt does not only affect post-graduate plans, it has an immediate effect on students. About 40 percent of college students struggle with hunger and housing because of student loans, and 17 percent have dealt with homelessness. The reality is that student loans prevent students from reaching their educational and professional potential. The Biden administration will have the chance to help students by ending the burden of student loans at public colleges.
Public universities should not charge tens of thousands of dollars each semester for tuition, just to have students struggle to make ends meet. The average student spends 20 years repaying student debt, but the problem does not have to continue. Making higher education free would be no different than funding primary and secondary education. It would make our population better educated and allow our students to focus on the classroom instead of their next paycheck.
Free public education is not perfect, but it’s a necessary start to tackle this crisis. For one, students at private schools, like GW, would still be expected to pay the cost of tuition set by the school. But if public schools are free and an option, private schools may have to offer additional aid or lower tuition costs in order to entice students to attend. While this has the potential to deepen the already present class divides at private universities, it is better than the current system of hiking the cost every year.
In the current system, students who cannot afford to attend college are more likely to choose not to attend college, even if they are qualified and willing to learn. A system that shuts out qualified students is a broken system, and it should be reformed. Making college tuition free for all public university students would allow qualified students to attend college without worrying about the cost. And if GW lowered its tuition as a result, it could help people who long dreamt of attending the University afford to go. While Biden’s plan would address this issue for some students, capping the benefits at family incomes of $125,000 is not enough.
If the policy is limited by the income level of recipients, it would not take into account geographical differences in wealth and could be littered with inaccuracies. Preventing someone too wealthy from receiving benefits is not worth installing an inefficient and bureaucratic system to determine eligibility. Anyone who has applied for financial aid in the past knows that getting the right benefits is already difficult, and a universal free college system would make it easier for students. It would also surely curb class divides present in private universities like GW by forcing them to set more equitable price tags.
Student loan debt is burdensome for current and former students, and it prevents college graduates from the future they deserve. The Biden administration should take immediate action by proposing legislation to eliminate the cost of public universities.

This discussion was held in the midst of outgoing President Donald Trump's attempts to dispute November's president election results and the aftermath of a pro-Trump mob engaging in a riot at the U.S. Capitol.
A law professor discussed what could have occurred in the final days of outgoing President Donald Trump’s administration Tuesday.
Brian Kalt, a professor of law at Michigan State University, explained constitutional law of the presidency, impeachment, presidential succession and the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and what may happen to Trump after President Joe Biden takes office. GW Law hosted the event, which was titled, “Impeachment, the twenty-fifth amendment and the final days of President Trump.”
This discussion was held in the midst of Trump’s attempts to dispute November’s president election results and the aftermath of a pro-Trump mob engaging in a riot at the U.S. Capitol on the day Congress was set to certify the election results.
In case you missed it, here are the main takeaways from the event:
25th Amendment
Kalt said the 25th amendment is a relatively recent add-on to the Constitution, and she said the amendment is vague and has only been invoked a few times.
“It doesn’t tell us what process we use to decide that the president is suffering and his inability to do it,” he said. “It doesn’t tell us who decides, and most importantly, it doesn’t tell us whether the president takes power back.”
Kalt said the 25th amendment was designed to create a process for the president to regain power after he is temporarily unable to perform his duties. He noted that the vice president serves as acting president until the president is able to resume their duties.
“So this is not really well suited to use against the president who can say that he’s OK,” Kalt said.
Kalt said invoking the 25th amendment is best suited for presidents who are unable to perform their tasks, like when President Woodrow Wilson suffered a debilitating stroke while in office. This amendment is not for presidents who do “bad things,” as it is more appropriate to use impeachment against them, he said.
“Impeachment is easier because you don’t need the vice president to sign up,” he asid. “You don’t need the Cabinet to sign up. You only need a simple majority in the House [of Representatives].”
Presidential self-pardon
Kalt said the argument in favor of presidential self-pardon can be explained in that the power to pardon in the Constitution is “broad” and “barely limited,” which suggests that the president can pardon himself, while the counter argument describes presidential self-pardon as unprecedented in American history, he said.
“You can’t be the judge in your own case,” Kalt said.
Kalt said the public speculation that Trump would resign and have outgoing Vice President Mike Pence pardon him was “pointless” and not likely to have happened.
“Even if the president can pardon himself, if he abuses his powers, he can be impeached and he can be prosecuted,” he said.
Late impeachment trial
Kalt said impeaching a president who is about to leave office might seem “counterintuitive” and “odd.” But he said impeaching either the president, vice president or civil officers can be done even if they are no longer in office.
“Impeachment is not just about removal,” Kalt said.
Kalt said impeachment can bring a “deterrent” effect, which constrains future presidents through the possibility of impeachment. He said the process can also hold those government officials accountable and lead to “consequences of disqualification” for an official holding future office, he added.
“Impeachment allows the structure of impeachment to be vindicated, allows the purpose of impeachment to be vindicated, allows the purpose of impeachment to be fully realized,” Kalt said.

Banners welcoming the incoming Biden/Harris administration were on display overlooking Freedom Plaza.
As Joe Biden was inaugurated as the 46th president Wednesday, small crowds across downtown D.C. remained peaceful amid unprecedented security precautions and threats.
Biden, who was sworn in by U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, declared that “democracy has prevailed” in his 21-minute inaugural address to a nearly empty National Mall, fortified by an extensive security perimeter and thousands of National Guard troops just two weeks after rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol. The widespread security restrictions led to closures and lockdowns across much of downtown D.C. that prevented the general public from watching the ceremony in person, but demonstrations did not turn violent.
“On this January day, my whole soul is in this – bringing America together, uniting our people, uniting our nation,” Biden said. “And I ask every American to join me in this cause.”
Moments before Biden took the oath of office, Kamala Harris – who has resided one block north of campus since 2017 while in D.C. – was sworn in as the country’s first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president.
Outgoing President Donald Trump did not attend the inauguration, departing Joint Base Andrews for Florida on Air Force One at roughly 9 a.m. Outgoing Vice President Mike Pence, alongside former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, attended the ceremony held on the west front of the Capitol.
As dignitaries arrived at the Capitol, small groups peacefully gathered – most supporting Biden – across the District outside the security perimeter, including at Black Lives Matter Plaza on the north side of the White House and throughout the downtown area.

The security precautions extended to campus, where National Guard troops have been stationed near edge of security boundaries that cross through Foggy Bottom. Traffic around the Foggy Bottom Campus has been restricted to residents and businesses in the area for days.
Officials released multiple updates regarding campus security in recent days as students living on and near campus altered their plans and expressed anxiety about the security situation.
“In recent days, we have seen some new blockades, fencing and members of the National Guard on campus,” University President Thomas LeBlanc said in an email to the GW community Tuesday evening. “I am sure it must be strange for those who are seeing pictures and getting updates from afar, but I hope that you are reassured by our commitment to safety.”
Officials designated Inauguration Day as a University holiday, shuttering offices and COVID-19 testing sites. Classes had already been canceled Wednesday as part of GW’s existing calendar for the spring semester.
Officials announced Wednesday evening that GW will resume its limited in-person operations Thursday at 8 a.m.
John Falcicchio, D.C.’s deputy mayor for planning and economic development, said crews will begin breaking down the extensive security perimeter beginning Wednesday evening, which will likely take about 36 hours to complete.
Biden demanded unity as he took office amid a raging pandemic and bitter political discourse, calling his first days a “historic moment of crisis and challenge” in his inaugural address.
“Let’s begin to listen to one another again,” Biden said. “Hear one another, see one another, show respect to one another. Politics doesn’t have to be a raging fire, destroying everything in its path. Every disagreement doesn’t have to be a cause for total war. And we must reject the culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured.”
He directly addressed the Capitol rioters, who claimed widespread voter fraud cost Trump the election without substantiated evidence.
“Here we stand just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, to drive us from this sacred ground,” Biden said. “It did not happen. It will never happen. Not today, not tomorrow, not ever.”
Ray Maldonado, a Biden supporter from New Jersey, said he had attended Obama’s inauguration and wanted to travel to D.C. despite recent violent events to see the transfer of power.
“As an American, we have a right to be down here,” he said. “We are not scared of anybody, the rioters or domestic terrorists that are trying to discredit a fair election.”
Maldonado said he hopes Biden will enact policies to benefit minorities during his term.
“Even with our strides through American history, the system was always suppressing us, and that’s what the Trump presidency represented,” Maldonado said. “The new Biden and Harris administration is a leap back into the 21st century for all Americans.”
After the ceremony completed, Biden and Harris participated in a pass in review of military troops on the east front of the Capitol. The duo then arrived at Arlington National Cemetery just before 2:30 p.m., joined by Obama, Bush and Clinton and their spouses, for a wreath laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
As the sound of cannon fire rumbled through the cemetery, Biden and Harris loaded in their motorcades and returned to 15th Street NW, exiting to walk a short distance just outside the White House. Biden later entered the Oval Office, where he signed more than a dozen executive actions, including orders that rejoin the country into the Paris climate accord, require masks in federal buildings and halt the construction of the southern border wall.

The Student Court released a general order last week to amend a few of its governing bylaws and appoint Judge Yun-Da Tsai to the newly created position of deputy chief judge.
The order states the court will hold three virtual public meetings during the spring semester, on Feb. 4, March 25 and April 8, to publicize “administrative matters” and listen to any concerns of the student body. The order also outlined approved amendments to the body’s bylaws regarding aspects of the court, like disciplinary action and the potential suspension of judges and the process for recusal from cases.
The order states any member of the court in violation of the Student Code of Conduct or the governing documents of the Student Association can be “subject to discipline” by the court. Any conduct classified as a “willful violation” by a panel of the court or any SA branch is also subject to possible disciplinary actions.
The court will also host a meeting at the end of spring semester to select a chief judge for the fall, according to the order. The order states the deputy judge – a position currently held by Tsai – will assist with the responsibilities of the chief judge.
“In the event of vacancy in the office of Chief Judge, a member of the Court shall discharge the duties of Chief Judge as Acting Chief Judge until a Chief Judge is elected by the Court in accordance with the provisions of this article,” the order states. “The order of succession for Acting Chief Judge shall be the Deputy Chief Judge followed by the members of the Court in order of administrative precedence.”

A new food delivery app is hoping to save students money and time on their orders.
Matthew Bouchner, the president of MealMe – an app that compares deals from major food delivery services like DoorDash and Uber Eats – said he plans to expand the app’s selection of local restaurants to compare the prices of meals from spots students frequent around campus. Bouchner said he hopes the app helps students save money on food delivery as developers work to boost the app’s visibility around Foggy Bottom.
“What we are doing is going to schools individually and giving them the love and attention that they deserve, and focusing on GW and UPenn and all these individual schools, say ‘We’re launching at this school,’ and really getting to know the students and what their needs are, what restaurants they like, so that we can better cater to those students,” Bouchner said.
MealMe, which launched on the App Store last year and serves more than 70,000 users, allows students to search for restaurants or cuisine categories and compare deals across several delivery platforms to find the cheapest and fastest option. Bouchner said developers plan to meet with fraternity and sorority members and others student organizations to determine restaurant hotspots for students and promote the app to their members at meetings.
Bouchner added that developers are contacting local businesses “to better understand the offerings and cater our restaurant recommendations to student tastes.”
“What we are focused on is adding more and more local food delivery apps so that we can continue to have a larger restaurant selection,” he said.
Bouchner said MealMe currently compares meals on DoorDash, UberEats, GrubHub, Postmates, Chownow, Waitr, Bitesquad, Delivery.com and Eatstreet. As developers continue to focus on adding more restaurant options, Bouchner said combining each delivery service into one program allows MealMe to feature “the largest selection of restaurants” out of any delivery app.
