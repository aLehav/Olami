Commissioners delayed the vote after Commissioner Evelyn Hudson was unable to join the meeting in person or through video.
Members of a local governing body delayed their vote to elect a new chair Wednesday after the former chair resigned from his post following The Hatchet’s reporting on his past criminal history. 
Members of the Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission voted to push back the election of a new chair to a special meeting after Chair Joel Causey announced he was resigning from the position Friday to avoid being a “distraction” to the commission’s work. The ANC must elect a new chair within 30 days of Causey’s resignation, per D.C. law.
Commissioners also approved GW’s application to expand community members’ access to Lerner Health and Wellness Center, discussed Mayor Muriel Bowser’s Fiscal Year 2024 budget and approved resolutions for the D.C. Council.
Here are some of the meeting’s highlights:
Commissioners delay chair election after Causey’s resignation
Commissioners voted to delay the election of a new chair in a 6-2 vote following Joel Causey’s resignation from the position after The Hatchet reported that he is registered as a sex offender in Florida.
Commissioners delayed the vote after Commissioner Evelyn Hudson was unable to join the meeting in person or through video. Commissioners said Hudson needed to be visibly present, either via video or in person, to be counted as present and delayed the vote to give her an opportunity to appear at a later date. 
Causey said she could not access the meeting by herself because of complications from a disability. Vice Chair Jim Malec, who will perform the chair’s duties until the election of a new chair, said commissioners should table the vote for a later date because of confusion over the requirements of online voting.
“The right thing to do is actually to table this at this point, because we do not know specifically what the rule is on this and we should find out, get the proper guidance and then move forward with clarity and confidence that we’re acting in the right way,” Malec said.
Causey and Commissioner Ed Comer opposed delaying the motion.
Commissioners vote to expand community Lerner Health and Wellness Center use
Commissioners voted 7-0 to allow an additional 250 community members to permanently access Lerner after officials filed an application with the D.C. Zoning Commission to modify the center’s conditions of approval. 
GW Community Relations Director Kevin Days said officials want to give Foggy Bottom community members and full-time students at the University’s Virginia Science and Technology Campus permanent access to Lerner. Days initially introduced the request at last month’s ANC meeting and said at the time that the University would file it in the “upcoming weeks.”
Days said the new conditions mandate that users are 18 years old or older and that members of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows – a fraternal organization located on the corner of 24th and G streets – access the gym.
Days said the temporary application currently permitting community members access to Lerner will expire June 30 after its initial 2014 approval.
Officials reintroduced the Friends of Foggy Bottom program Jan. 30 after a three-year pandemic-related hiatus, giving community members located in Foggy Bottom and the area surrounding the Mount Vernon Campus access to Gelman and Eckles libraries and Lerner for an initial fee of $15. Community members registered for the program must also pay an additional $53 every month for a Lerner membership, according to the center’s website.
Days added the University is working on reinstating their audit program, which allows senior citizens to take courses through the University at a discount.
City administrators talk Bowser Fiscal Year 2024 budget proposals
City Administrator Kevin Donahue said Bowser submitted a $19.7 billion operating budget for Fiscal Year 2024, $10.6 billion of which goes toward local initiatives. 
Donahue said $6.29 billion of Bowser’s operating budget goes toward human support services, which fund Medicaid, homeless services and behavioral health, and allocates $3.98 billion for public education. 
The six-year capital budget, which funds the construction of schools, libraries and recreation centers between 2024 and 2029, allocates $5.6 billion for operations and infrastructure, which includes funding to build and renovate schools and replace HVAC systems. The budget allocates $55 million to complete renovations for the School Without Walls, adding a standalone gym and three special education classrooms. 
The budget designates $1.7 million to establish a care coordination team in the Department of Behavioral Health to assist residents in crisis without requiring the Metropolitan Police Department to respond. 
Donahue added the District will implement a paramedic school to help D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services hire D.C.-based paramedics to “principal positions.”
Donahue said in order to process housing vouchers for unhoused residents, the Department of Behavioral Health should remove the requirement that all social workers have a bachelor’s or master’s degree. Commissioner Yannik Omictin said the current lack of social workers and case managers precludes unhoused residents from receiving housing, even after they receive vouchers for permanent housing. 
Commissioners call on Council to fund bills, maintain employment staff
Commissioners unanimously approved resolutions requesting the D.C. Council ensures wage transparency in the Department of Employment Services, oversight over the D.C. Housing Authority’s housing voucher program and upgrades to infrastructure in Foggy Bottom.
Commissioners also approved a resolution that opposes the proposed cutting of three D.C. Circulator routes, including four bus stops in Foggy Bottom, after a neighboring ANC also approved the measure. 
The ANC approved a resolution opposing the elimination of the Criminal Code Revision Commission in a 5-2 vote, with Comer and Commissioner Kim Courtney abstaining. The resolution states the commission plays a “critical role” in advising the D.C. Council on the District’s revised criminal code, which members of Congress and President Joe Biden overturned in March over concerns about the city’s crime rates and proposed crime policies. 
Commissioners voted 4-1-2 to approve a letter that emphasizes five ANC priorities for Bowser’s development of the FY24 budget, including funding Baby Bonds – a plan that provides low-income children with up to $25,000 by the time they reach adulthood –  the Domestic Workers Bill of Rights, the B24-429 Metro for DC Amendment Act of 2021 and the Local Residents Voting Rights Act. The resolution also requests officials reallocate money to compensate employees who city officials excluded from pandemic relief funds.

Graduating college comes with a lot of extra expenses, and your cap and gown is just the start. Seniors shell out hundreds – sometimes thousands – of dollars to ensure their transition out of college goes smoothly. Down payments for homes, cars, travel, moving costs, utility deposits – the list goes on and on. The burden of that extra cost already makes this time of the year uniquely stressful for low-income students like me.
Now, imagine being one of those low-income students and receiving this email from GW Seniors:
“As your senior year at GW comes to a close, we want to take the opportunity to remind you about the tradition of the GW Senior Class Gift. Unlike other schools, as a class, we don’t pool together to buy a specific item or create a specific fund in honor of the Class of 2023. Instead, we each make our own gift of any size to the student organization, academic department, athletic team or cause at GW that matters to you.”
I think Captain America best sums up my response here. “No, I don’t think I will.”
For all of us, the cost of GW is already immense. Many pay thousands upon thousands of dollars each semester just to attend. Some have family who can foot the bill, but many don’t. And for those students, there’s one real solution – working. My personal financial burden these last four years for mandatory expenses alone has been $56,300, which has meant taking on a lot of work – at times more than 50 hours a week – just to finish my education. Given all of my hard work and effort, it frankly feels like an insult to be approached before I’ve even graduated and asked for yet more money.
It would be one thing if they just wanted a donation with nothing at stake, but that’s not the case. If you don’t donate, you will be gated out of various experiences during graduation season. The first event, advertised in the aforementioned email, was a food truck lunch in Potomac square – and the only way to get food was to donate. Could you go and sit there while everyone around you is eating? Sure. But you won’t get the full experience. Translation – if you’re poor, you can’t celebrate. Not like your peers, at least.
The senior class gift is yet another offense in a long history of class discrimination at GW. It’s no secret that our financial aid system is bunk at best – students who have issues with their aid package often have to endure lengthy hold times and endless referral loops to solve simple issues.
GW’s shortcomings don’t end there. My class paid thousands of dollars a year for a glorified prepaid food visa with limited options, and newer classes have been forced into a meal swipe plan that gets them access to “buffets” with limited, repetitive offerings. Student housing is another well-known offender, where students pay roughly $2,500 per month per person in every mold-ridden, poorly maintained room.
Even the education we spend tens of thousands of dollars on each semester presents a questionable value. It’s no secret that this school isn’t cheap. It’s true that some people love it here, but a good experience doesn’t mean good value, and when you have to work 50 hours a week while attending class full time, the rose-tinted glasses start to fade. Despite being one of the most expensive schools in the nation, we don’t crack the top 10 academically, or even the top 50. Last year, GW ranked 62nd on the U.S. News and World Report rankings – a dubious value for the price – all while some officials rake in more than $1 million per year.
Donating to student organizations or academic programs is a better use of a senior’s money than an arbitrary statue or grant fund made in a class’s honor. But students still should not be expected to foot this cost themselves, especially not as a condition of enjoying their graduation season. If GW wants to reward beloved organizations and programs with extra funding, they could allocate $50 for each of the about 3,000 graduating seniors, who could then distribute that money to the organizations we see fit. The cost would only be about $150,000. For that measly price tag, officials could lift the burden off poor students while funding a host of worthwhile causes on campus.
With such a rocky track record, GW surely has a lot of work to do if it wants to lower its financial burden on low-income students. Not hitting them with the door on the way out would be a great place to start.

The Colonials found success in their first two rounds Monday, finishing the day just six strokes behind the eventual winner Marquette, but faltered in the final round Tuesday.
Golf tied North Dakota State for sixth place in the Redhawk Intercollegiate at the Pittsburgh Field Club, shooting 33 over par, 885 in their last tournament before the Atlantic 10 Championship.
The Colonials found success in their first two rounds Monday, finishing the day just six strokes behind the eventual winner Marquette, but faltered in the final round Tuesday. With the regular season wrapped up, the five-man squad will look to the Atlantic 10 Championship for their first team victory after placing second twice during their spring slate.
The Colonials ended Monday’s first round in fourth place, seven strokes behind first-place Marquette University and nine shots over par. In their second round on Monday, the team shot a four-over 290, vaulting them to second place and positioning them for a run at their first tournament victory.
In Tuesday’s third and final round, the team descended into the middle of the field, scoring an 18 over, 302 in what proved a difficult day for all 14 competing teams, with only one squad finishing better than four strokes over par.
“A big piece of trying to bring a team together in an individual sport is getting guys that are going to fight through tough rounds because they care too much about the guys next to them to break down and give in,” Scheinost said. “And we’ve had that happen on multiple occasions this year.”
Senior Jakub Hrinda, who finished fourth in the tournament among individuals with a total score of 215, led the way for the Colonials with an individual tie for fourth place and a total score of 215 across three rounds of the tournament, firing a two under par score of 69 in the second round.
Freshman Manuel Barbachano trailed the senior with a score of 223. He previously led the Colonials to an eighth-place finish with a three-over-par performance in the SeattleU Redhawk Invitational earlier this month.
Head Coach Chuck Scheinost said that while the sport focuses on individual competitiveness, he has managed to create team camaraderie and combined passion for the game by creating a tight-knit community on the team, and encouraging his players to focus on what they can control.
“The big thing we have talked about is we have to get away from thinking winning is the ultimate definition of success, because it’s hard to win,” Scheinost said. “We can’t control someone going and shooting a great score, but we can control our process, we can control being ourselves.”
The Colonials have racked up multiple individual wins this spring, with Hrinda capturing a solo victory at the Ross Collegiate Classic last month and Barbachano tying for first at the Savannah Intercollegiate in February, but they have been unable to convert individual excellence into team wins. The team achieved their best team finish at the Golden Horseshoe Intercollegiate hosted by William & Mary College, when the team finished in second place on March 27 and 28.
The five-man squad will now shift their focus to the A-10 Championship, slated for April 28 in Orlando, Florida at the Reunion Resort.

Student Bar Association President Shallum Atkinson said in his first address to the body that he will work with senators to modernize student study spaces to make them more “enjoyable” and “comfortable."
The Student Bar Association Senate swore in its new president, executive vice president and incoming senators for the 2023-24 academic year in their final meeting this year Tuesday.
Associate Judge and Chief Justice-elect Wolfgang Paulson swore in freshman Kaitlin Fontana as executive vice president, who pledged in late March to lead the senate with “compassion” and “understanding” during her campaign and to be a “friendly” and “approachable” face for any SBA inquires. Fontana then swore in second-year law student Shallum Atkinson as the body’s president, who said in his first address to the body that he will work with senators to modernize student study spaces to make them more “enjoyable” and “comfortable,” increase student organization budgets and bolster mental health services for “nontraditional” students.
“I want to be a partner with all of you in this,” Atkinson said. “At the end of the day, when you finally graduate and when I finally graduate, we can say that we left our legacy and our place on this campus to do good work and to make the opportunities better for those that follow.”
Fontana said the nine new senators will participate in training sessions to prepare them for their role in the fall, and she will reach out to them to assign them to their six committees. Fontana began campaigning Feb. 27 for the SBA’s March 10 election.
Senators unanimously confirmed Paulson – a second-year law student and an associate justice who has served since fall 2022 – to the chief justice position, replacing graduating third-year law student Deja Williams.
The senate unanimously approved Joint Resolution 7, which amends the SBA constitution to become compliant with University-wide policy and requirements. Ball said David Bonilla-Ciferri, the assistant director of Student Involvement and Leadership of the Division for Student Life notified the senate that the bylaw amendments are necessary for the SBA to reregister as a student organization on campus.
The amendments update the senate’s bylaws with a nondiscrimination clause and a clause clarifying that the senate must uphold all University policies.
Third-year law student Karsten Ball – the director of the Faculty Tenure and Promotion Committee, which conducts interviews with individual professors to provide input on their applicability for tenure and promotion – said the committee collected student evaluations of professors’ performance over the course of last year to strengthen faculty members’ understanding of students’ academic needs and desires.
“I can tell you from having attended some of these faculty meetings that faculty is not always aware of the motivations that drive the student body and the interest that we have in promotion decisions,” Ball said.
The SBA Senate will hold its next meeting next fall in the Law Learning Center.

Colby left little to the imagination as she accepted a $200,000 prize and the title of America’s Next Drag Superstar while nearly nude, a decision she made to protest increasing intolerance and hate toward drag performers and trans people.
In the midst of rising anti-drag legislation across the United States, “RuPaul’s Drag Race” concluded its 15th season Friday with a show-stopping, star-studded finale as RuPaul addressed the politicization of drag and crowned the season’s winner.
Sasha Colby – a transgender woman and the 2012 winner of Miss Continental, a prestigious annual drag pageant competition – took home the “Drag Race” crown after dominating the season with her unrivaled star power and 20 years of drag experience. Colby left little to the imagination as she accepted a $200,000 prize and the title of America’s Next Drag Superstar while nearly nude, a decision she made to protest increasing intolerance and hate toward drag performers and trans people.
“It was a specific choice to be naked in these times,” Colby said in an interview with Entertainment Weekly. “I wanted them to see what they’re trying to eradicate.”
The finale opened with a runway featuring each eliminated member of the 16-queen cast, the largest of any “Drag Race” season in history. The eliminated cast members delivered extraordinary alongside the season’s top four remaining competitors – Sasha Colby, Anetra, Luxx Noir London and Mistress Isabelle Brooks.
After the runway, RuPaul came to the stage and displayed a QR code onscreen for people to donate to the Drag Defense Fund, created in partnership with the American Civil Liberties Union to protect drag and the form of expression from “threats and censorship.”
Once the finale began, each finalist performed an original number to win over the audience and RuPaul, earn a top two spot and advance to the final lip-sync battle for the crown.
Anetra, a high-energy performer hailing from Las Vegas, danced to her original song “Lotus,” an uplifting anthem that showcased her iconic performing abilities. Her taekwondo and “duck-walking” skills went viral earlier this year after she won the season’s premiere episode talent show number, earning her the most-watched scene ever posted to “Drag Race” social media accounts with more than 13.1 million views across all social media platforms.
Luxx Noir London, a self-proclaimed fashion queen hailing from East Orange, New Jersey, performed her original number, “It’s Giving Fashion,” an upbeat testament to the fashion prowess that earned her a maxi challenge win earlier in the season.
After the first two performances, RuPaul announced that Bob Mackie – a fashion designer known for his glamorous stylings of female performers, like Cher in the 1970s – would receive the first-ever “Giving Us Lifetime Achievement Award” for his “priceless” contributions to “glamour, beauty and excitement.”
The performances continued when Mistress Isabelle Brooks, a “plus-size dancing diva” from Houston, Texas, performed her original song “Delusion” in a candy-striper outfit as she threw light shade at other queens and rapped about curing their drag delusion. Brooks gave a shoutout to her drag family in the audience for helping her grow as an entertainer and a queer person.
But it was Sasha Colby, the season’s angelic front-runner from Waimānalo, Hawaii, who stole the show as she channeled her experiences as a queer child in a religious family of Jehovah’s Witnesses, and delivered a spectacular performance of her original song, “Goddess.” Coming onto the stage in a snake costume that revealed into a leafy glitter-spangled bodysuit that alluded to the story of Adam and Eve, Colby reclaimed her religious background and served divine feminine on her own terms.
“I’m so grateful to be here, but it takes a village,” Colby said during the finale. “What I want to tell my family, my chosen family and the few biological family that I do keep in contact [with], I just want to tell you thank you so much for believing in me, I love you all so much.”
Colby and Anetra advanced to the final lip-sync battle, where each delivered an electrifying performance of “Knock On Wood” by Amii Stewart. Although Anetra served her signature jaw-dropping dips and splits, Colby’s hairography and iconic mid-song transformation from a pageant-esque queen in a floor-length gown to a nearly nude look ultimately secured her the win, and RuPaul announced Colby would be the season’s crowned queen.
Colby won four main challenges this season and was the only finalist to avoid placing in the bottom-two spots in any episode throughout the season. She routinely received praise from the judges panel for her elevated perspective on runway themes and performance in a variety of challenges ranging from designing an elegant crystallized gown to improv-ing a chaotic interview with Charo, a characteristically quirky Spanish-American actress and avid supporter of the LGBTQ+ community.
Colby is the first Hawaiian-native and the fourth consecutive transgender woman to win a U.S. season of “Drag Race” after Kylie Sonique Love in All Stars 6, Willow Pill won in Season 14 and Jinkx Monsoon won in All Stars 7: All Winners. Her historic win also received praise in a tweet from Hawaiian Senator Mazie Hirono.
“At a time when MAGA Republicans are pushing hateful restrictions on drag and the trans community, mahalo for using your creativity and talent to share Hawaiian culture with the world and bring joy to so many,” Hirono said in a tweet addressed to Colby.
In an interview with Vogue, Colby, who was already deemed a drag legend before her iconic run on “Drag Race” because of her 2012 Continental win and years of impressive performances, likened her extended absence from the program to surfing in Hawaii as a child and waiting for a wave to come. She said she originally considered joining the show in 2014 but waited for RuPaul’s historically turbulent relationship with trans performers to come to an end before she decided to join Season 15 and ride the wave all the way to the crown.
“This, today, is when I can be the most impactful with my art, with my trauma and with my inspiration for others,” Colby said. “This wave feels like a tsunami. It’s a big one.”

The menu is unsurprisingly fish-heavy, with two sushi sections – one for standard house rolls and another for the chefs' special rolls titled “sushi chefs just wanna have fun.”
Expanding beyond the barriers of a single cuisine, Nama Ko broadens its domain by merging alternative cultural flavors with traditional Japanese dishes.
Though most diners would describe the 14th Street restaurant that opened this past fall as Japanese, celebrity chef Michael Schlow and executive chef Derek Watson classify their cuisine as “Japanese-inspired” to maintain creative agency without discounting its roots. From heritage pork gyoza ($14) to spicy tuna nama “crunch” tacos ($18) to roasted romanesco cauliflower with spicy vegan aioli ($23), Nama Ko’s delicious menu is not for the indecisive eater.
The night before my roommate and I went to Nama Ko, she expressed regret over missing her family’s matzo balls at their Passover celebration this year. It felt serendipitous to discover Japanese matzo balls ($4) on the new dinner menu as a possible addition to their homemade miso soup ($10).
Nama Ko’s exterior looks slightly commercialized due to the neon blue and fluorescent white plastic box letters displaying the restaurant’s name above the door met with the standard red brick exterior. But the interior is delicate, sleek and warm. Dimly lit hanging light fixtures bring a softness to the dark furniture while its black serving plates underscore the food’s vibrancy.
I made my reservation for Saturday at 8:30 p.m. – a ridiculous time to visit a new, trendy restaurant – yet my waiter was attentive as ever, carefully bringing each plate to the table so quickly I hardly sat for 10 minutes before my food came.
The menu is unsurprisingly fish-heavy, with two sushi sections – one for standard house rolls and another for the chefs’ special rolls titled “sushi chefs just wanna have fun.” I decided to order the heritage pork gyoza appetizer to disturb the uniformity that was the rest of my seafood-centric meal.
Nama Ko’s pork gyoza was indulgent yet not too heavy to kick off my meal. The bottom of each piece was crispy – seemingly pan-fried –  without producing superfluous oil. There is something so fantastic about a dish with just enough grease.
Thinly-sliced green onions and a dusting of togarashi, a chili-based Japanese seasoning, scattered atop the gyoza cut the fattiness of the pork and simultaneously respected its vitality. The dish came with five meat and onion-stuffed gyoza, just enough for two to share yet a bit conservative for a party of three.
The generous dollop of karashi – a thick, Japanese spicy mustard – sitting on the edge of the plate brought me back to the karashi-doused shrimp shumai served at a sushi restaurant in Brooklyn I used to regularly visit with my mom and sister. The wave of nostalgia I experienced elevated my appreciation for the dish. As someone who believes it is difficult to disturb the blissful pairing of pork and high-quality mustard, no matter its form, Nama Ko’s gyoza stands out among the rest.
The rest of my order consisted of the aforementioned matzo ball miso soup and the pink lady roll ($22). While the soup mirrored a traditional, salty miso broth hosting small pieces of tofu and seaweed, I did not find the added matzo component to be overwhelmingly impressive. It fit a bit awkwardly into the dish, lacking any additional flavor beyond the broth it absorbed. The pink lady roll – consisting of salmon, tuna, yellowtail and avocado wrapped in soy paper – brought an indispensable freshness to the meal, one I crave when dining at any restaurant that offers raw fish.
You may decide to round out your dining experience with one of the shop’s craft cocktails, Japanese whiskey or take a risk and order sake samplings from one of the omakase flights. For a sweet end to your meal, opt for one of the desserts, like decadent truffle miso honey ice cream finished with chocolate sauce, Japanese caramel and toffee bits or try the lighter coconut mango yuzu sorbet with lychee sauce, matcha shortbread and candied walnuts.
Nama Ko elaborates on traditional Japanese cuisine with its adaptive menu – one that toys with modern flavors yet still offers sushi staples in an upscale environment, perfect for treating yourself on a night out.

Facing a problem yourself? Annie has answers. Ask away!
Nicholas Anastacio | Graphics Editor
Dear Annie,
My friend group is getting together for 4/20, but I’ve never smoked before. I don’t want to cramp their style, but the FOMO is real. How do I act like I know what I’m doing when I join them?
Sincerely,
Puff the Clueless Dragon
Hmm… I’m not very well acquainted with Mary Jane, so I’m going to phone one of my stoner friends for this one. Hope they aren’t too high to answer the call and write another “Annie’s Friends” piece.
Hi Puff the Clueless Dragon,
Getting high with friends as a first-time smoker can be daunting as it is thrilling, especially on a holiday as sacred as 4/20. Puff, if you’re smoking with the right people, they will be more than happy to welcome a rookie into their smoke circle. If not, then you’re probably smoking with the worst kind of people – those obsessed with their own pompous status as stoners. Find some good, chill friends to smoke with, and soon enough you’ll be floating above the clouds.
But if you really want to fake it until you make it, here are some tips to make you seem like a pro.
Rule number one, don’t be afraid to tap out. First-time smokers don’t know their tolerance levels yet, and you shouldn’t let your friends’ insistence to keep smoking make you feel like you have to keep up. Stop smoking when you are on the cusp of feeling a comfortable amount of high. It will take a bit for the weed to settle into your bloodstream, so give yourself time to gauge how high you truly are, not just how high you feel when you’re done smoking. If your sober sense returns, you can always go back for seconds.
Now, keep in mind that the device you’re smoking with will change the weed etiquette. If your friends are smoking a joint or a blunt – the best way to smoke in this lovely spring weather – the puff, puff, pass system typically applies. That means you get two hits of the joint before you pass it to the person on your left. Do your best to not skip the person next to you, so pass it to the same person every time, at least until they tap out. Don’t hold onto the joint for too long – you’re wasting weed and money, which nobody wants to do. Also, not to be too persnickety, but keep those lips dry! Nobody wants to taste their smoke circles’ spit.
Jenna Baer | Staff Cartoonist
If you’re smoking out of a bowl – like when using a bong or pipe – sharing generally works on a volunteer basis, so ask your friends for the next hit once the circle begins. Unlike the consistently lit joint, bowls can also be tough to smoke, so for first-timers, it never hurts to ask for help when taking your first rip. But if you’re lighting the bowl by yourself, don’t put the lighter in its center. Instead, ignite a slice of the weed pie along the edge of the bowl. It may take some practice to angle the lighter into the corner, but this way everyone in the circle will get their fair share of the bowl, not just the first person that hits it.
Once you’re high, it’s imperative to stay mindful of your own needs. Do you need some water or a snack to subdue the munchies? Or do you need to move because the smoke spot is too loud and you’re feeling anxious? Understand and listen to your physical needs, and always know that it’s OK to indulge them.
Keep in mind that you should generally never mention how high you are to your friends. The worst kind of smoker is always reminding other people how ‘baked,’ ‘blazed,’ ‘fried’ and ‘zooted’ they are. If you do get stoned, congratulations on achieving your goal, but there’s no need to brag about your high unless asked. Also, generally don’t make comments about how high your friends are, unless you think you or your friends are having intense anxiety or illness from smoking too much. More often than not, the comments can come off as judgmental, and nobody wants to feel insecure for having a good time.
Finally, always offer to Cash App your friends if you don’t have weed and they’re spotting you, or smoking you out. Particularly for first-time smokers, $2 to $3 should be enough to cover one session. If your friends don’t let you pay, offer to get them next time. After all, Puff, this is hopefully the first of many smoke seshes to come.
Happy Holidays,
Annie’s Stoner Friend

The rule comes after the NCAA rearranged the recruiting calendar in April to allow coaches to contact recruits between June 15 following their sophomore year and before Sept. 1 of their junior year of high school.
The NCAA Division I Council passed a rule Thursday that allows high school athletes to take an unlimited amount of official visits during their collegiate recruitment process. 
The new rule will go into effect on Aug. 1 and will end the previous five official visits cap for high school recruits but will still limit recruits to one official visit per school. During official visits, athletic programs pay for recruits’ transportation and amenities for up to two nights and allow universities like GW to give recruits a taste of university life and athletics programs on campus.
“For young people considering where to go to college, visits to campus – both official and unofficial – are an integral part of the decision-making process,” Division I Council Chair Lynda Tealer said in a release. “This was an opportunity to modernize NCAA rules in a way that provides greater and more meaningful opportunities for prospects going through the recruitment process.”
The rule comes after the NCAA rearranged the recruiting calendar in April, allowing coaches to begin recruiting rising high school juniors on June 15 instead of Sept. 1. The change will also allow college coaches to reach out for in-person contact with recruits after Jan. 1 of their junior year, allowing up to 37 additional days between the spring and fall contact periods.
Men’s basketball prospects retain their own category and are still allowed to have two official visits to a college as long as it does not occur within the same academic year. The updated rules also dictate that official visits may last “no longer than a two-night stay,” and athletes might only be accompanied by up to two family members.
At GW, recruiting for men’s basketball is already well underway, with four players entering the transfer portal and star senior guard James Bishop announcing his return for a fifth year. To fill in the roster spots, Head Coach Chris Caputo welcomed in two transfers, freshman guard Benny Schröder from the University of Oklahoma and sophomore guard Garrett Johnson from Princeton.
