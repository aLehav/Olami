Department of Treasury spokesperson John Rizzo said Sinclair is on "temporary assignment" with the Department of the Treasury until May 2024 and will return to GW after her assignment ends.
A professor of economics will temporarily leave GW to serve as a Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Department of the Treasury.
Tara Sinclair, who has worked as a professor of economics and international affairs since August 2005, filled the role of Deputy Assistant Secretary for Macroeconomics in the Office of Economic Policy at the beginning of the month. Sinclair is not scheduled to teach any economics courses this academic year, according to the Office of the Registrar.
“I’m grateful that Tara is joining the Treasury Department at this important time for our country. Her background and experience will contribute to the important work of furthering the economic recovery,” Ben Harris, the assistant secretary of the treasury for economic policy,  said in a statement.
Department of Treasury spokesperson John Rizzo said Sinclair is on “temporary assignment” with the Department of the Treasury until May 2024 and will return to GW after her assignment ends.
“As the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Macroeconomics, Dr. Sinclair’s major duties and responsibilities to be performed while on assignment at Treasury include participating actively with the Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy in formulating and executing broad economic policies and programs primarily in connection with domestic economic policy making,” he said in an email. “Dr. Sinclair was asked to take on the position because of her educational credentials and a field of specialization in Macroeconomics.”

GW and D.C. officials broke the ground on the site of the Cedar Hill Regional Medical Center in February, where they said the new medical centers falls under the District's plan to address healthcare disparities in Southeast.
Universal Health Services opened a new urgent care facility in Southeast D.C. this week, District officials announced in a release Friday.
Cedar Hill Urgent Care, GW Health will provide services to all District residents seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. after opening its doors Monday. The urgent care facility, which is owned and operated by UHS in partnership with the GW School of Medicine and Health Services and the GW Medical Faculty Associates, will be the first urgent care center to open in Ward 8. 
The release states the urgent care facility will offer care for allergic reactions, ear infections, colds, the flu, pink eye, broken bones, minor burns, bites, sinus infections, sore throats, urinary tract infections, x-rays and basic lab work.
“We were very proud, earlier this year, to break ground on the new Cedar Hill Regional Medical Center, but we also know that it is not just about building one hospital – it is about the entire health care system,” Mayor Muriel Bowser said at the ceremony. “This new urgent care is a critical piece of that system.”
University and District officials broke the ground on the Cedar Hill Regional Medical Center’s St. Elizabeth’s East Campus in February, where they said the new medical centers fell under the District’s ongoing plan to address healthcare disparities in Southeast D.C., a majority-Black region in the District.
“We are thrilled to be embarking on the development of these vital health services East of the Anacostia River so that we can better serve all residents across the District of Columbia,” Kimberly Russo, the vice president of the Washington, D.C. Region of UHS and CEO of GW Hospital, said in the release. “Opening Cedar Hill Urgent Care is the next step in creating a comprehensive, academic medical network which will enhance health access, equity and outcomes and elevate healthcare in our nation’s capital.”
UHS announced a $17 million investment last month to fund the creation of a fourth floor in the new hospital at the St. Elizabeths East Campus. The release states that the officials will finish building the Cedar Hill Regional Medical Center in early 2025 and open the doors to the Ward 7 urgent care facility by 2024.
The Cedar Hill Regional Medical Center will also be the first hospital in D.C. to open since GW Hospital’s Foggy Bottom location opened in 2002.
“Providing access to high-quality health care to all citizens of the District is a 200-year tradition for GW,” Barbara Bass, the Dean of the GW School of Medicine and Health Sciences, said in the release. “In this new urgent care facility, we will have the ability to provide convenient, on-the-spot care to our patients and partner with our neighbors to improve the health and wellness of our great city.”

Lovato closed the show with her fan favorite track “Cool for the Summer,” amassing cheers from the energetic crowd.
Demi Lovato brought the North American leg of her “HOLY FVCK” tour to an energetic crowd at The Anthem Monday for what may be her final show in the District, according to a now-deleted Instagram story post last month.
Lovato has been open about her struggles with drug and alcohol addiction since 2010 when she went to rehab during her rise to Disney Channel stardom. The singer has been fully clean and sober for about a year following their 2018 overdose when they relapsed after six years of sobriety, but she has been experiencing other health setbacks on tour this year that have signaled the end of her touring career.
“I can’t do this anymore,” Lovato wrote to her fans after waking up sick the morning of her show in Santiago, Chile last month. “This next tour will be my last. I love and thank you guys.”
Following a bout of illness that caused Lovato to wake up with “no voice” last week, the star was forced to postpone their show in Rosemont, Illinois last Wednesday, but she was back with her powerhouse vocals just in time for her D.C. show.
Lovato opened the show with four tracks – “HOLY FVCK,” “FREAK,” “SUBSTANCE” and “EAT ME” – from their critically acclaimed eighth studio album, a divergence from their previous soft pop album “Dancing With The Devil…The Art of Starting Over,” released in April 2021. Although Lovato’s new grungy rock album deviates from much of her discography, it also bears a striking resemblance to some of the beloved Disney tracks that she released as an angsty teen like “Don’t Forget” and “La La Land,” both of which made their way onto the setlist.
Following the brief introduction of her newer music, Lovato’s all-women band transitioned into “Here We Go Again” followed by “Remember December,” two pop-rock breakup songs from Lovato’s second studio album that were released during her prime Disney days in 2009. The crowd sang along to every word, accompanying Lovato’s impressive vocal range and electric guitar playing skills.
Next, Lovato sang “La La Land” – one of my favorite songs to ever come from Disney Channel. The tongue-in-cheek anthem still rings true today, as Lovato calls out the “la la land machine” that is the music industry despite representing Disney Channel at the time, a network that has been known to take advantage of its young artists. In hindsight, fans cannot help but notice the irony after Lovato has spoken out about the abuse she and countless other Disney stars faced.
Lovato went on to sing “Don’t Forget,” the title track from her 2008 debut album. It was a cathartic experience to stand in a pit surrounded by fellow women in their 20s who grew up listening to a 16-year-old Lovato sing these same songs while we were in elementary school.
Next, Lovato moved into their more recent catalog of songs, performing “The Art Of Starting Over,” an upbeat-yet-calm track from their 2021 album. Lovato told the crowd that while her newest album is her favorite she has ever released, this track is her most treasured from her previous album. The crowd danced along to the catchy melodies and uplifting lyrics, providing a necessary variation from the electric guitar riffs.
“These next two songs are very special to me,” Lovato told the audience after a pause. “I wrote it while falling in love,” she said before playing “4 EVER 4 ME,” a ballad written for Lovato’s boyfriend and fellow musician Jordan Lutes. The track samples “Iris” by The Goo Goo Dolls, which an emotional Lovato sang midway through “4 EVER 4 ME,” to replace the bridge of the song.
The poignant mood continued with “Skyscraper,” the sole song on the setlist from her 2011 album “Unbroken.” The emotional ballad detailing Lovato’s personal battle with self-harm struck a chord with many fans in the audience, prompting the members of the crowd to sway with their phone flashlights beaming through the air.
The heightened emotions were sustained in the next song, “29,” widely speculated to be about Lovato’s former relationship with actor Wilmer Valderrama. When the couple began dating, Lovato was a minor and Valderrama was 29. In “29,” Lovato explains that after turning 29 herself, she recognizes their past relationship as grooming. Valderrama has also admitted to dating actresses Mandy Moore and Lindsay Lohan while they were 15 and 17 and he was well into his 20s.
Lovato referenced the recent TikTok trend in which survivors of abusive relationships with significant age gaps use the sound to share their stories. “This song is really important to me – when I released it, so many of you guys put your stories out on social media,” Lovato said to the crowd.
“If you relate to this song, I’m so so sorry,” Lovato continued. “No one should ever have to relate to this song. If you do, I see you, I hear you and I love you.”
Lovato closed the show with her fan-favorite track “Cool for the Summer.” The single reached success in the year of its release in 2015, peaking at 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and charting for 20 weeks straight. But this past year, the song has taken a new life on TikTok, with multiple sped-up versions amassing more than 5 million videos on the app.
Lovato never fails to dazzle with their vocals as a live performer, but it was evident through her lack of energy at Monday’s show that a period of rest away from the limelight could benefit the ever-evolving artist greatly. As much as the crowd enjoyed the show, loyal fans that have stuck around for over a decade will more than empathize with Lovato taking some time off.
Lovato is undeniably an incomparable talent who has overcome countless obstacles in her lifetime, but she should put her mental and physical health first rather than “pushing through” for her fans.

Faculty senators raised concerns about the MFA’s more than $40 million deficit during the fiscal year 2021 and its consistently low earnings over the past few fiscal years at a senate meeting in May.
The Faculty Senate will hear a report on the financial standing of the Medical Faculty Associates during its meeting Friday.
Chief Financial Officer Bruno Fernandes will deliver the report with Joe Cordes and Susan Kulp, the co-chairs of the senate’s Fiscal Planning and Budgeting Committee, to present a new agreement on the MFA’s financial and administrative standing. The MFA – a group of physicians and faculty members from the School of Medicine and Health Sciences and physicians from GW Hospital – lost nearly $80 million during the fiscal year 2022 and currently owes the University more than $120 million.
The report will likely include information on restructuring the MFA after Barbara Bass, the CEO of the MFA and the dean of SMHS, proposed to house the MFA under SMHS to strengthen its relationship with GW Hospital to the senate in May and how GW’s sale of its stake in GW Hospital in May will have on the MFA.
Faculty senators raised concerns about the MFA’s more than $40 million deficit during the fiscal year 2021 and its consistently low earnings over the past few fiscal years at a senate meeting in May.
Vice Chair of the Presidential Search Committee Jim Tielsch and Chair of the Faculty Consultative Committee Kim Roddis will also present an update on the ongoing search for the next president of the University to the senate. Officials released the presidential profile Tuesday, which outlines the attributes and qualifications the presidential search committee is looking for in potential candidates.
Caroline Laguerre-Brown, the vice provost for diversity, equity and community engagement, will share an update on Title IX regulations. Officials are working to reform Title IX policy, following criticism from students on the Title IX office’s handling of sexual assault cases and the Department of Education’s announced plans to reinstate Title IX regulations that the Trump administration removed.
Faculty senators will review nominations to seven of the senate’s committees, including the nomination of Student Association President Christian Zidouemba and other members of the SA.
Interim University President Mark Wrighton and Provost Chris Bracey will also share reports with the senate. Tielsch, who also serves as the chair of the senate’s executive committee, will also present a report from the executive committee.
The senate will also vote on a resolution of appreciation for Elizabeth Amundson, the secretary of the senate, during the meeting Friday.

The $900 allocation will cover a portion of the registration, transportation and attendance costs for the students for the conferences that will be held this weekend and in mid-November.
The Student Bar Association Senate Tuesday authorized the allocation of $900 to the Labor and Employment Law Society to help 10 law students attend two labor law conferences.
The $900 allocation will cover a portion of the registration, transportation and attendance costs for the students for the conferences that will be held this weekend and in mid-November. In a voice vote, senators easily cleared the simple majority threshold needed to pass the bill.
SBA Sen. John Tuley, the chair of the senate finance committee and sponsor of the authorization bill, said there may be some concern that the ad hoc budget, used to approve funding requests after the official budget is confirmed, could run out, but the committee can address each request on a case-by-case basis.
“We did something really good for those students who are now going to be able to go to something that they may not have otherwise had the opportunity to go to and enhance their professional careers,” he said. “I hope they enjoy themselves.”
SBA Sen. Preston Eagan said the SBA should not fund this request because attending conferences was a personal choice students made and not one that benefits the whole student body.
“I just don’t think SBA should be paying for that kind of a personal choice,” he said. “It’s not like a group of speakers in school or something of that nature.”
SBA Sen. Cody Ingraham said as part of his efforts as the chair of the academic policy committee, he hopes to work with law school deans to secure funding for law students to attend conferences using University funding. He said law students may have different ways of maximizing their experience in law school, but they all want to serve their future clients.
“Some students will have dispassion towards other students interests,” he said. “Other students may not want to maximize their law school experience in the same way as others, but it shouldn’t be those dispassions and differences that serve as a barrier to other students.”
The senate also unanimously approved the distribution of $200 to cover food costs for an event that the Government Contracts Student Association will host and unanimously budgeted $50 to cover registration costs for a law student to attend a health law summit that occurred earlier this month.
The SBA Senate also unanimously confirmed Jeremy Etelson as director of academic affairs and policy, Karsten Ball as director of the faculty tenure and promotions representative committee and Gregory Orlando as director of the faculty representatives committee.
The next SBA Senate meeting will be held on Oct. 25 at 9:15 p.m. in the Law Learning Center.

Gomez said they struggled with vulnerability after growing up in a culture of masculinity which they said conditioned them to push down their emotions. 
An author spoke about writing their memoir about growing up as a queer person of Latin American decent Tuesday.
Author Edgar Gomez discussed their early life in Orlando, FL as a child from a Nicaraguan and Puerto Rican background and how it shaped their identity in their book, “High-Risk Homosexual.” The event was part of the ​​LatinXpression Series, an initiative of the Cisneros Hispanic Leadership Institute, which hosted the author online on National Coming Out Day. The GW Department of Romance, German & Slavic Languages & Literatures co-sponsored the event and moderated by Ofelia Montelongo, GW assistant professor of Latin American and Latinx Literary and Cultural Studies and Manuel Cuellar, GW assistant professor of Spanish Literature.
Gomez discussed how writing their memoir allowed, and even forced, them to be vulnerable while confronting their past, something they said they’ve struggled with due to a culture of masculinity in the environment of their upbringing.
“Writing forced me to sit down with whatever it is that I was trying to avoid, for hours a day, for a weeks, for, I mean, seven years,” Gomez said. “And so I really had to process everything. The vulnerability is what attracts me to writing because it offers me a safe space to do that.”
Gomez said they struggled with vulnerability after growing up in a culture of masculinity which they said conditioned them to push down their emotions. They said in their writing process, they began noticing their patterns of avoidance.
“I’m a very avoidant person,” Gomez said. “When something bad happens I kind of just keep it pushing. And a big reason for that is just that culture that I grew up in, where people who are perceived as boys aren’t allowed to be emotional. You can’t talk about your feelings. You have to man up. You have to be strong.”
Gomez said they were “traumatized” after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando in 2016, the gay bars in the city on “Latin Nights” were some of the first places they said they felt they were in a safe space for their identity. They said they started writing about the shooting right after it happened to make themselves feel better.
“I was writing about it both when it was a wound and I was writing about it when it was closer to being a scar,” Gomez said. “I don’t know if it ever will fully be a scar. Especially because after Pulse, it’s like every other day there’s another shooting and so there’s no opportunity for the wound to heal.”
Gomez said their memoir talks of tragedy and grief while intertwining humor and life between the stories.
“In my wildest dreams, a queer Latinx kid is going to pick up my book,” Gomez said. “I’m talking about a lot of depressing things and I don’t really want them to leave feeling depressed. At the same time, I also didn’t want to like sugarcoat anything or lie to them.”
Gomez said they wanted readers to feel hope, even when they read material in his book as challenging as the parts focusing on the Pulse shooting.
“For me, it was also just a subliminal way to let the reader know that even in the darkest scenes, I clearly made it out and far enough in my life, that I can look back and laugh,” Gomez said. “And so in that way, I was sort of trying to offer hope, like little trails of hope along the way.”

In the tight confines of the Smith Center Pool, the ear-splittingly loud cheers of swimmers and the packed crowd of over 100 fans reverberated around the room, adding to the excitement of the Colonial’s first home meet of the season.
The men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams won in their tri-meet against James Madison and Old Dominion Saturday, building aspirations of another Atlantic 10 Championship title.
Marking the first win of the fresh season for the men’s and women’s programs, the Colonials swam their way to victory in 22 of the meet’s 32 events – a rebound from the their respective pair losses against Virginia Tech and Ohio University earlier this month. After winning the A-10 Championship last year, the team appears ready to meet high expectations as the projected favorites to take their second straight conference crowns.
In the tight confines of the Smith Center Pool, the ear-splittingly loud cheers of swimmers and the packed crowd of more than 100 fans reverberated across the pool for the Saturday meet, adding to the excitement of the Colonial’s first home swim of the season.
“It was absolutely as crowded and loud as I’ve ever seen it, ever heard it,” Head Coach Brian Thomas said in a video posted to Twitter Sunday. “And I think our kids fed off of that, especially early in the meet, it’s sometimes a challenge in a dual meet. They are three hours long, so you want to kind of bottle that up a little bit.”
The men’s swimming team faced off against Old Dominion and outscored the Monarchs 167 to 95, taking nine of 14 top places. The women’s swimming and diving team easily handled Old Dominion 232 to 61 and took care of JMU 163 to 136, winning 13 of 18 top places.
To start the meet, GW unveiled the men’s and women’s A-10 Championship banners from last season, which made them the first A-10 swimming and diving program to win both titles since Massachusetts in 2001. The championship win was the fifth in six years for the men’s team and the second in three years for the women’s squad.
The diving competition at the meet was limited to the 1- and 3-meter women’s dives. Freshman Olivia Paquette was the top performer for GW, recording a score of 262.13 on the 1-meter dive and a score of 265.35 on the 3-meter dive, good to win third place in both events out of 17 and 16 competitors respectively.
“Our divers stepped up and helped break up some of the Madison divers and allowed us to get in there with a manageable score to overcome on the swimming side,” Thomas said. “So we’re happy with everything that way.”
In men’s swimming, the Colonials’ squad cruised to first and second in a field of six competitors for the 400 medley relay, separated by just 1.03 seconds. The team of junior Karol Mlynarczyk, freshman Preston Lin, graduate student Matthew Whelan and junior Dylan Koo finished in the top spot with a time of 3:22.81 – nearly six seconds faster than Old Dominion’s third place finish.
The team also swept the 100 and 200 butterfly, finishing in the first four positions in both events that consisted of a respective 12 and eight swimmer pool.
Despite the dominance over Old Dominion, Thomas said the team must continue to improveme their game to finish atop the A-10. He said the repeated races for the swimmers in a single meet might have fatigued the swimmers without proper preparation.
“I felt the guys were so-so today – some good performances, some performances that could have been better.” Thomas said. “We need to be a little bit better at racing when we’re a little tired.”
In women’s swimming, sophomore Moriah Freitas was the standout swimmer on the day, leading the team with four top-three finishes, placing first in the 400 medley relay, the 200 butterfly and the 100 butterfly.
“She’s off to a great start this year,” Thomas said. “It was evident from the get-go that maybe she had come in with a little bit more maturity this year and has been on point with everything she’s done both academically and athletically, and it’s starting to show itself with a lot of consistency.”
Freitas easily finished first alongside teammates sophomore Ava DeAngelis, freshman Phoebe Wright and sophomore Barbara Schaal in the 400 medley relay in a field of nine. Adding to their solid afternoons, Schaal and Wright were separated by just 0.01 seconds at the top of standings for the 200 backstroke among 14 other racers.
Looking to the future, Thomas’ goal is to keep the team on track to win the A-10 without pushing his athletes too hard this early in the season.
“It’s still early in the year and we’ll pump the breaks on everything,” Thomas said. “Just get back to work on Monday, taking it a day at a time.”
Moving forward, both teams will compete at Navy Oct. 21 and 22.

I ordered the Staycation breakfast sandwich ($12) with soft scrambled eggs, goat cheese, caramelized onions, avocado and sriracha mayo.
Move over Call Your Mother, the District’s newest breakfast sandwich spot is here.
In 2020, founder Andre McCain said he created the concept of Butter Me Up on the heels of pandemic-related closures to help his neighbors in Shaw find employment as well as bringing an unprecedented breakfast sandwich spot to the area. Butter Me Up sits on 14th Street in the lively Shaw neighborhood, just a 20-minute bus or train commute from campus.
Upon entering the shop, I immediately took note of the aesthetically pleasing interior, adorned with boho decor, rattan garden furniture and pink velvet chairs. Green plants fill the restaurant, adding to the captivating scenery behind the inviting bar area where patrons can sit to order signature cocktails like the Pretty Little Thing ($14) with unicorn vodka, triple sec, fresh lime and white cranberry juice. Even the gender-inclusive bathroom captures the boho-chic vibe with emerald green tiles. As an added bonus, the space contains all the supplies one would need, including lotions, Q-tips, tampons, wet wipes and even mints and gum.
On a late Monday morning, customers sat around me having lively brunch conversations with friends or grabbing a quick bite to eat on their lunch breaks. The sound of banter and laughter combined with the cozy decor make Butter Me Up feel like home.
Butter Me Up sells breakfast toasts with every topping imaginable like the So In Love ($14) with crushed avocado, soft boiled egg, everything bagel seasoning, hot sauce and sprouts, as well as salads and superfoods like acai and smoothie bowls. But the real star of the menu is the wide variety of breakfast sandwiches like The Bestie ($12) with smoked bacon, cheddar cheese, scrambled eggs and chipotle ketchup and Easy Like Sunday ($12) with turkey sausage, scrambled eggs, havarti cheese and honey-mustard aioli.
Don’t be fooled – these breakfast sandwiches are not just carbon copies of GW Deli or Bethesda Bagels. While admittedly delicious, those bagel sandwiches can become monotonous, but Butter Me Up’s innovative ingredients are sure to wow.
I ordered the Staycation breakfast sandwich ($12) with soft scrambled eggs, goat cheese, caramelized onions, avocado and sriracha mayo, which took just under 10 minutes to arrive. The egg was fluffy, with a cloud-like texture that melted in my mouth. The avocado added a creaminess to the mix, though it did make the sandwich messy by sliding off frequently. The goat cheese added a salty taste, helping to balance out the flavors. The brioche buns were soft and delicious.
The one item lacking from the sandwich was caramelized onions. As an onion fan, I looked forward to this component to the dish, but there were very few to aid the texture and their taste was lost in the rest of the ingredients.
The serving size of the sandwich did not fully match my expectations from seeing a photo of the meal online – it more closely resembled a slider in size than a typical breakfast sandwich. The portions left me wanting more, and the dish was slightly too small for a main meal. But with one of the restaurant’s salads as a side, the meal would make for an optimal start to the day.
Overall, the dish offered a delectable combination of ingredients like feta and avocado for a vegetarian breakfast sandwich. The remainder of Butter Me Up’s menu is enticing, but it’s the optimal service and overall inviting environment that will keep me coming back for more.

During my three-and-a-half-hour break between classes each Monday, all I want is to go to my Somers Hall room on the Mount Vernon Campus and take a nap. Unfortunately, this means joining about 100 other students in line for the Mount Vernon Express that shuttles students between Foggy Bottom and the Vern every day. The line begins at the steps of Tompkins Hall and wraps around the corner of G and 23rd streets, gaining length with every passing minute. Waiting in never-ending Vex lines has become an inevitable, daily setback that has interfered with students’ ability to attend class on time, an unacceptable fact that does a $80,000 student experience no justice.
Every day, I have to choose whether to spend my awkwardly extended period of displacement between classes in my room on the Vern or in the University Student Center. Should I wait outside in line for 30 minutes to return to Somers or should I actually be productive in the meantime? It’s an irritating decision that I am tired of making, mostly because I know no matter how inconvenient the trip to the Vern will be, I’ll soon have to head back before doing it all over again. To mitigate the backlog of students waiting for these shuttles to arrive, GW should anticipate the buildup of these lines that form when classes let out each day and circulate extra Vex shuttles to eliminate unnecessary disruptions and delays.
Last Monday, I joined the line to go home at around 12:30 p.m. with dozens of other students who take the nine University Writing classes that start at 1 p.m. on the Mount Vernon Campus. I ended up walking into class an hour after, 30 minutes late. “Does anyone else need to get to the Vern? I can take four people with me!” a student shouted. Four other students joined immediately, and the group split off in a Lyft to get to class on time. The rest of us continued to wait for the next Vex to board the third batch of us in line as the clock continued to tick before the start of class. Students shouldn’t have to resort to paying out of pocket just to get to their destinations in an efficient manner. The University should eliminate this inconvenience that hinders the ability of every student to share an equal opportunity to attend class, fulfill their responsibilities and succeed in their academics.
Staff already monitors the Vex lines throughout the day to make sure students can get to and from the Vern, and GW has a chance to use these positions to their full advantage. When these lines form, staff works to calm the increasing panic of a time crunch as they see students stirring with restlessness. “The next one should be here in 10 minutes,” they say as they go down the line counting off who will be on the first, second and third buses to arrive. They step aside to dial the Vex drivers to alert them of the masses. GW should use these staff members to identify the Vex’s peak rush hours and act accordingly with a larger fleet during those times to minimize the buildup of lines.
During GW’s Alumni & Families Weekend, GW accompanied every Vex with charter buses to help transport the influx of families, even though the lines paled in comparison to those during the school week. The buses seemed to act as a preventative measure to ensure lines didn’t reach their normal levels, a strategy that GW should employ for students during the weekday. I find it ironic that GW’s transportation investments spare parents of our excessive Vex lines instead of ensuring we can actually get to the classes and residence halls that cost our families beyond $80,000. I have to leave for one of my classes more than an hour early because I know my grades will suffer if I don’t budget that kind of time. But students should not have to avoid punishment for being late when GW creates the problem and does little to nothing to solve it. Instead of limiting the increase of functional transportation to Alumni & Families Weekend, GW should expand their effort to the overlap of students’ vital commutes throughout the week.
Students deserve better than waiting in never-ending lines, being late to class or wasting time just to get home. It is not the responsibility of the Vex staff to drop everything and calm a problem that needs GW’s support. Officials can learn how many students would need to board the Vex on their way to or from class before or after common class times based on the schedule of classes. Instead of leaving the Vex staff to fight an already massive line, GW should use its class data to guide increased daily shuttle deployment and account for its peak rush hours. The University needs to fix the problem before the line gets even longer and the number of students who miss class continues to grow. Officials’ reluctance solve this issue is vexing – they just need to do a little research and put their students and staff first.

In a TikTok posted in late August, model and celebrity it-girl Hailey Bieber coined the “brownie glazed lips” look with brown lip liner layered with lip gloss from her newly launched makeup and skincare brand. But many were quick to call Bieber out for renaming a trend most notably attributed to women of color in the past.
“Women of color aren’t mad that people do these trends, it’s when you slap a f–cking Betty Crocker name on it and make millions from it when women of color get called ghetto for it, that’s the part that hurts,” verified influencer Bria Jones said in a TikTok late last month, responding to the controversial videos that started at all.
The Bieber controversy isn’t the first time a celebrity or influencer has rebranded a trend that women of color have created and propagated. Just Google search Kim Kardashian renaming cornrows “Bo Derek braids” after the acclaimed actress or the Black origins of the TikTok “clean girl aesthetic” of slicked back hair and hoop earrings. Jones’ words strike right at the core of an all-too-familiar and unsolved issue – celebrities, designers and social media influencers have unfairly rebranded fashion and beauty trends that have long since been attributed to people of color while leaving out the necessary historical context.
In the case of Hailey Bieber’s brownie-gate, Latina women set the trend of wearing clear lip gloss over brown lip liner, and Black and brown people have worn the look since the late 1980s. Commenters scolded Bieber’s lapse of cultural awareness, writing “You meant 90s Latin inspired lip combo,” and, “You mean the lip combo Latinas have been using since forever????”
For generations, people of color have crafted makeup styles like these as innovative workarounds to contend with the systemic lack of makeup products available in stores across the country. So-called “nude” lipsticks rarely accommodated darker skin tones and existed as various shades of pink for white and lighter skin tones. Black and brown people resorted to using products that came in dark enough shades of brown, like eyeliners and eyebrow pencils, for looks like the renamed “brownie glazed lips.”
It wasn’t until the launch of Rihanna’s Fenty Beuty makeup brand in 2017 that people of color received the products they deserved, with 40 all-inclusive shades of foundation that accounted for brown skin tones and varying undertones. The release marked a turning point for major makeup brands, which neglected people of color for years while selling ashy foundation shades in the place of brown shades that remained excluded from their first batch of launches altogether.
While these trends have generated viral content for celebrities like Bieber, they fueled years of discrimination against Black and brown people who first created the looks before they became the next TikTok craze or celebrity venture. Refinery 29’s series on powerful Latina aesthetics notes that Black and Brown women were often criticized for the dark lipstick makeup looks, their big hoops, tight fit and baggy fashion styles.
“Our styles are often read in the U.S. as tacky, over the top and deviant, even as they are simultaneously spectacularized, desired and appropriated,” author Jillian Hernandez wrote in the Refinery 29 series.
“When it was on my sisters or my mom, and in Black and Latino communities, it was seen as ghetto,” celebrity makeup artist Sir John said in an interview with Diet Prada about the “brownie glazed” look.
When I was younger, kids my age and especially the adults in my life discouraged me from wearing the cornrows and dark brown lipstick styles I gravitated towards and saw my older sisters wear. The only reason I learned the term “ghetto” was because kids would joke that big gold hoops made me so. They told me not to wear the baggy, skater-looking pants and basketball jerseys I’d seen my dad rock in pictures from the 1990s. Since then, I have gotten over the phase of letting people tell me what to wear, dictate what made me “ghetto” and style my curly hair whichever way I please. But after watching all of these trends undergo celebrity rebrandings on TikTok and recirculate as popular Pinterest searches without a picture of a Black or Brown person in sight, I’ve come to realize the jewelry, hairstyles and makeup were never ghetto to begin with. It was who was wearing them that elicited this hurtful, unacceptable response.
Whether people intentionally rebrand these trends or not, it contributes to a culture of erasure and neglects the important realities of discrimintation and stereotyping that exist, which causes the community to constantly have to reclaim what shouldn’t have been renamed and left out in the first place. The fortunate thing about the world of fashion and beauty is that it’s built on a community of artists and designers that we can draw from and create with. But participation is contingent upon proper attribution, especially if you draw inspiration from other creators, as is with any other artistic industry. We can successfully celebrate historical styles without omitting their designers and the communities of color who had more than just a fashionable reason for creating them, and we can partake in these trends without cutting out the people behind them.
