Gates said changes need to occur across the globe and require innovation to adapt everyday sectors, like electricity and agriculture, to become more climate-friendly.
Bill Gates spoke about his latest book on the need for immediate action to combat climate change.
Gates joined a webinar Wednesday for GW, Georgetown, American and Howard universities’ students, where he spoke about his book, “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster,” outlining a plan for the planet to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. Michelle Miller, a co-host of the Saturday edition of “CBS This Morning,” moderated the conversation and a Q&A session.
Gates said his book focuses primarily on the two categories of human behavior most commonly associated with emissions – electricity and transportation. He said his book aims to raise awareness about the needed changes to everyday practices and new technologies that will need to be introduced to facilitate a 100 percent reduction in emissions.
“Our commitment to developing these innovations will mean the difference between a future where everyone can live a healthy, productive life and one where we’re constantly dealing with the human and financial crises at a historic scale,” he said.
Gates said these changes need to occur across the globe and require innovation to adapt everyday sectors, like electricity and agriculture, to become more climate-friendly. He added that the most climate-friendly changes have occurred in places where they are easy to implement, but the “hardest” area has yet to be solved.
“In my book, I’ve got the idea that we can solve it,” Gates said. “But the idea that if you don’t, it’s kind of a disaster trying to balance that – the message of hope with the hate.”
Gates said it was “tragic” that the United States temporarily withdrew from the Paris Agreement because it put the country behind others in reducing emissions. The United States officially rejoined the agreement Friday, under the direction of President Joe Biden.
He added that the accord provides for short-term, “easy” methods to achieve progress, and he warned that some may distort the public’s view of the complexity of climate action. He said the United States must play a role in developing new technologies to help the international community lower emissions without raising the production costs of essential materials like cement and steel.
“The U.S. has the majority of the innovation capacity in the world,” Gates said. “Europe, China and many others will contribute as well, but between our universities, our national labs, our willingness to take risks in every industry, you see the U.S. playing a strong role.”
Gates said the climate and environmental justice movements need to have a “better dialogue” because marginalized communities, particularly in Africa, that have few resources will feel the effects of climate change first. He said Africa is already experiencing difficulties in farming and preserving lands with the onset of rising sea levels.
Black and Brown communities additionally endure higher amounts of pollution than White communities, he said. Efforts and innovations to combat climate change must reach all communities, a priority for the White House’s first-ever environmental justice coordinator, Cecilia Martinez, Gates said.
He said the United States has been slow to adopt new technologies because of the higher cost of more climate-friendly options. He said nuclear reactors are becoming more expensive, and the costs of projects involving reactors are unable to compete with inexpensive natural gas.
Gates said creating a new generation of nuclear technology could become a necessary part of solving climate change, as long as governments and companies are willing to take responsibility for its costs and safety. He said the effects of climate change will become most visible during current college students’ lifetime, unless action is taken immediately.
“This is this generation’s No. 1 problem,” he said. “It’s their problem. It is not going to be their children’s and grandchildren’s. This is your issue, and you guys have to run with it.”

The survey received more than 1,200 responses, good for a response rate of at least 71 percent.
The results of the faculty-wide survey assessing University President Thomas LeBlanc’s leadership are expected to be provided to full-time faculty Monday.
A group of faculty senators managing the survey announced Friday that they would meet their Feb. 22 deadline to distribute the results after the survey closed at the end of last month. The survey will mark the widest measure of faculty sentiment toward LeBlanc to date after years of rising tensions.
“Since the survey closed on January 31, 2021, we have been working on analyzing the data,” the faculty senators said in a statement Friday. “We want to thank you all for your active participation and for the robust response rate.”
The group managing the survey said they received more than 1,200 responses.

The Faculty Assembly approved the survey in November following a monthslong deliberation about whether to censure LeBlanc or even take a formal no-confidence vote as hundreds of members of the GW community signed petitions and statements calling for LeBlanc’s resignation.
As faculty prepare to release the survey results, here’s a recap of how tensions grew:
As one of the hallmarks of his tenure, LeBlanc developed the 20/30 Plan, which sought to reduce the number of undergraduates by 20 percent while upping the share of undergraduate STEM majors to 30 percent over a five-year period. The plan was met with criticism from many faculty over shared governance, diversity and financial concerns.
LeBlanc and other officials have said the plan is now obsolete after placing it on hold in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
GW’s roughly 8 percent undergraduate enrollment drop this year, coupled with lost housing revenue and other income sources during the pandemic, created a $180 million annual budget gap this fiscal year. The gap led administrators to cut employee travel, institute freezes on most hirings and capital projects and lay off hundreds of staff.

The layoffs – which occurred solely in administrative units, with many divisions being entirely restructured to save costs – inflamed some community members’ frustrations, with hundreds citing the cuts in their calls for LeBlanc’s resignation.
LeBlanc has said during public meetings and interviews that he has always prioritized the health and safety of the GW community, but the pandemic has necessitated “difficult” decisions, including layoffs, that could not be avoided.
As part of the reorganizations, LeBlanc named Heather Swain to lead GW’s newly restructured communications and marketing divisions. Swain rescinded her acceptance of the hiring offer after many raised concerns over her decisions leading Michigan State University’s communications office during the Larry Nassar sexual abuse case. LeBlanc later apologized for the hiring.
But the hiring was a step too far for some faculty, who began leading an effort to censure LeBlanc. Arthur Wilson, the chair of the Faculty Senate’s executive committee, said in September that the committee was also considering a faculty evaluation of LeBlanc’s performance, and a “suitable survey instrument” had already been prepared.
After trustees asked faculty senators to soften their condemnation, the senate voted in October to voice “severe disapproval” instead of a formal censure.
Sidney Lee | Graphics Editor
Weeks later, a group of professors introduced the petition to launch the faculty-wide survey, which was approved by the Faculty Assembly in a 152-25 vote. The vote came after an intense debate about the petition and legitimacy of online voting.
As many faculty and student organizations have demanded LeBlanc’s resignation, trustees have publicly defended him, saying he has demonstrated a “strong” ability to lead the GW community through the pandemic.
“On the completion of the February Board meetings, including a comprehensive update on the status of the University, the Board of Trustees commend President LeBlanc and his leadership team for the great work they continue to do managing effects of the pandemic to secure the University’s future,” the Board said in a statement earlier this month. “The University leadership has the deepest appreciation and gratitude of the Board.”
Board Chair Grace Speights said in an interview earlier this month that she had been invited to review the survey results, which she plans to look at, but she will ultimately rely on the Board’s standard review of LeBlanc this spring before determining if his contract will be extended.
She said trustees are hiring an independent firm to assist with the review, which will conclude near the end of the academic year.
“We’re going to rely on a process that we put into place to make sure that we have a fair and independent process,” Speights said. “That’s what we’ve done with every president, and that’s what will be considered.”

Updates to campus building HVAC systems like those in South Hall include increased ventilation and airflow and filters to block dust and contaminants.
The University is completing a second phase of HVAC upgrades in several campus buildings this semester to align with COVID-19 safety protocols and limit energy consumption.
David Dent, the associate vice president for facilities planning, construction and management, said officials are renovating the HVAC systems in Enterprise, Phillips, Rome, Discovery and Ames halls, Amsterdam House, the Smith Hall of Art and Building GG before June. He said officials upgraded eight other residential buildings last fall as part of the ReStart initiative, a project aimed to bolster HVAC systems on campus.
“As a result of the optimization work, these mechanical systems are performing at their maximum operational capabilities,” Dent said in an email.
Dent said District, Potomac and International houses, Shenkman, South and Aston halls, 1959 E Street and One Washington Circle received upgrades this fall. He said officials enhanced building ventilation and airflow, maximized “fan production capacity” and “outside air flow and exchanges,” repaired faulty equipment parts, renovated mechanical systems and installed MERV 13 filters – which block dust and contaminants from entering a room.
Dent said the ReStart Initiative, which is running this academic year, helped officials determine that all buildings on campus are “safe for occupancy.” The project’s first phase of upgrades in the fall cost GW $2.4 million, according to a University release issued in November.
The project also indicated that officials need to invest more into mechanical systems “to address deferred maintenance,” Dent said. He said officials identified the buildings that needed more modernization to comply with the University’s standards for carbon footprint, greenhouse gases and energy performance.
The release states that the initiative assessed the “mechanical capabilities” of each building’s HVAC system to boost safety, according to guidelines outlined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Occupational Safety and Health Administration; and American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers.
The project sets metrics for equipment, controls, environment, pollutant agility and domestic hot water, and the first phase of fall upgrades is “reaching completion” this month, according to the release.
Dent said officials are starting to draft designs for the next phase of HVAC upgrades, which will work to modernize every University building beside the Lerner Health and Wellness Center, which has already received updated designs.
Mechanical engineering experts said the University’s upgrades could enable safe ventilation during the pandemic, and officials should remain focused on maintaining frequent air filtration and finding alternative system designs to minimize energy consumption.
Leon Glicksman, a professor of building technology and mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said effective HVAC upgrades should block aerosols that could potentially carry the coronavirus and infect people inside a building. He said upgrades should depend on air change and recycling, which determine the amount of air that enters and exits a room.
Glicksman said systems “are not necessarily designed” to frequently filter air inside a room, so officials need to upgrade the systems to increase airflow and circulation. He added that officials also need to avoid systems that create horizontal airflow, which can transport aerosols carrying potential bacteria or virus strains from one person to another.
“You don’t want to have a system which creates large horizontal flows of air because if you have a horizontal flow of air with the velocity, say one meter per second, what will happen again is if someone is ill and is giving off the virus, that virus will be carried in the airstream to other people in the room,” Glicksman said.
Glicksman said the University’s installation of the MERV 13 filter, which blocks contaminants, “works quite well” and meets the standard of ventilation expected of most buildings. He said the filters can stop all particles beside “the very tiniest” aerosols that a high-efficiency filter could block.
“People are doing what they think is best,” he said. “There has not been enough absolute standard to say this will guarantee that the building will be completely safe. It’ll certainly be safer and reduce the probability of transmission from one person to another, but that’s the state of the art right now.”
Forrest Meggers, an assistant professor of architecture at Princeton University, said the challenge for implementing HVAC upgrades under COVID-19 guidelines is the significant energy demand to ensure a maximum amount of fresh air is being delivered inside the buildings. He said the upgrades under the guidelines are often followed by a 200 to 300 percent increase in energy demand.
“We probably aren’t going to stay at that level, but it’s really exposed the sensitivity of our carbon emissions and primary energy demand to heating and cooling buildings and how the mode of heating and cooling that we do, which in the U.S. explicitly tied to air conditioning,” Meggers said.
Meggers said officials should introduce a radiant hydronic system, a heating method that utilizes running water through pipes to create heat, to address the heating and cooling components of HVAC upgrades, which he said would ultimately be more efficient.
“You’d have to think about it as a campus for HVAC systems – ‘I can make these great upgrades and make the buildings more comfortable and a little bit more efficient by putting water-based heating and cooling systems and making the ventilation be more focused on delivering care efficiently and having heat recovery,'” he said.

Many students at GW have a firsthand view of the impact of the pandemic on the lives of citizens nationwide through their internships on Capitol Hill.
In a normal year, sophomore Eshan Alamdeen’s internship on Capitol Hill would involve drafting memos and taking phone calls for Rep. David Trone, D-Md. But now, he’s part of a large-scale effort to ensure Maryland residents get the vaccine.
Last month, Alamdeen drafted an email detailing Maryland’s COVID-19 vaccine roll-out plan to send to Trone’s entire district. He said the assignment was “rewarding,” especially when he heard the email was requested by the White House COVID-19 Response Team as a template for their own vaccine campaign. 
“We needed to make it, basically, accessible and easy to understand and user-friendly in a format that could be sent out over email,” Alamdeen said. “I needed to find testing locations, numbers, addresses and include their website with a direct URL to apply. And we had to do it for all our counties in district six, which is by far the biggest district in all of Maryland.”
Alamdeen is one of half a dozen students currently working a virtual or in-person internship on the Hill this semester amid the pandemic. Students said throughout their internships at the Capitol, they’ve witnessed how constituents are struggling to receive essential needs, like financial relief, during the pandemic and emboldened their love for politics and assisting people.
Alamdeen said he works three days a week virtually for Trone’s office, which has been running “as smoothly as possible” through various communication channels, like Google Meet and Slack. He said it’s been “fascinating” to watch officials operate during a historical year because of the pandemic.
“My first week was Jan. 4, and two days later and we had a terrorist attack on our Capitol,” Alamadeen said. “So I think it’s a perfect time to start working. And this is a fascinating time to be in politics.”
Sophomore Julia Koscelnik, a political science major, said she is interning this semester for Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md. She said the pandemic has influenced “every part” of her internship – she has been answering and assisting constituents who call with concerns, like being months behind on their unemployment checks.
She said she still would have been taking phone calls for the office had she interned in a non-COVID-19 year, but now the phone calls and assignments she does receive are all aimed at providing COVID-19 assistance to constituents during the pandemic. 
“I honestly couldn’t imagine it otherwise,” Koscelnik said. “Because almost every single call that we get has to do in some way with COVID, other than the impeachment. Obviously, [former President Donald Trump] was impeached once before COVID. And then once during COVID, but I think that COVID has impacted the political landscape so much and has made it even more polarized.”
She said it has been especially “interesting” following Trump’s impeachment trial earlier this month, with Raskin taking a central role in the case. Koscelnik said she received “multiple” phone calls from supporters from areas outside of Raskin’s district like Texas and California throughout the trial who called to back the representative’s argument.
Raskin worked as impeachment manager, arguing that Trump incited the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol and threatened the safety of former Vice President Mike Pence.
“Now, because he was at the forefront of the impeachment trials, he gained such a national focus,” Koscelnik said. “I thought that was really cool, seeing just how now I think almost everyone knows his name if you’ve been following impeachment.”
Sophomore Josh Orenstein, a political science major, said he is interning this semester for Rep. Chris Jacobs, R-N.Y., in a hybrid capacity, making the trip to Capitol Hill twice a week and working one day remotely.
He said attending hearings and communicating between offices is “easy” to do virtually because he can join any meeting on platforms like WebEx without having to be working in person that day. He said he attended and took notes on a virtual hearing Thursday on the aftermath of GameStop’s sharp rise in the stock market last month to report back to the office.
“They’re keeping as many people out of the office as possible, but in order to provide a more comprehensive and more complete experience for me as an intern, they’ve generously decided to allow me to come in as much as possible,” Orenstein said.
Orenstein said his in-person days aren’t “overwhelmingly different” from the time he spends remotely, as he’s tasked with similar duties like staffing the phones and conducting legislative research. Interns are no longer allowed to give Capitol Hill tours, but he said he wishes he could have that aspect of the typical position.
“There’s no real physical interaction with constituents or guests to the congressman’s office,” Orenstein said. “Capitol Hill is largely devoid of people at the moment. The largest group of people is members of the National Guard and some staffers, but I imagine it’s significantly busier before COVID.”
Sophomore Cam Cayer, a political science major, said he spent last summer working in person for Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., in the Rhode Island office before transitioning online for the fall and spring to the D.C. office. He said although he was not used to working virtually, he still feels his internship has connected him with resources, like communication channels, to feel a part of the team and their work.
Cayer said his virtual internship is also beneficial because he did not have to plan his class schedule around which days he would be working in person.
“In person, it was an actual experience, but online you still get exposure, and you’re still learning about what the House does,” Cayer said. “You’re still seeing what the congressman does.”

Professor Samuel Ledermann hopes to study how the COVID-19 pandemic may have affected the decisions of impact investors around the world. 
This story is part of The Hatchet’s semester-long project sharing stories of GW’s faculty members at the forefront of researching the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Two professors are teaming up to assess how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the number of investments made to affect social change.
Samuel Ledermann, an assistant professor of practice at the Elliott School of International Affairs, said he spent the past two and a half months creating a survey to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the number of impact investments made to create long-term social or environmental change. He said the pandemic has created an increased need for investments in social and environmental causes but has produced an economic environment in which making such investments can be financially risky.
“The fear would be with COVID, you obviously not only have an increase in inequalities and an increase in marginalization and so forth but actually that investors are retreating because of the risks that exist to the economy,” Ledermann said.
He said the survey will be conducted globally and sent to investors, investment advisers and other researchers in the field by late March or early April, and he expects to be able to analyze results in April.
Ledermann said these investments help provide private sector funding to aid the public sector in achieving social and environmental goals, like the 17 sustainable development goals set by the United Nations in 2015.
He said he hopes he can present his research to federal and international policymakers, which could help government leaders offer a “safety net” to incentivize people to make impact investments.
“If we identify that impact investors are retreating in a specific region because of a perceived higher risk of the investments defaulting so they would lose money on them, there are instruments that exist currently where a government can say, ‘I take the first loss if an investment were to default,’” he said.
Ledermann said he received an impact grant in 2015 through his work at Biovision Foundation for Ecological Development, an organization that works to find sustainable ways to improve life for people in Africa. He said he was working to implement an agriculture technology project throughout eastern and southern Africa, which sparked an interest in sustainable agriculture and partially motivated him to start his current project.
He said impact investments have been one of the fastest-growing classes of investments globally in the 15 years, and he wanted to understand their impact with COVID-19.
“Overall, we are looking at what is happening with the investments overall right across everything, but then we are honing down and trying to understand what is the impact on the level of health and at a level of food security,” he said.
Reid Click, an associate professor of international business and international affairs who is working with Ledermann on the research, said the project will investigate whether impact investors are shifting from investments in agriculture to those in health care. He said other qualitative studies and surveys have shown that impact investments as a whole have been resilient throughout the pandemic.
A June survey administered by the Global Impact Investing Network on the pandemic’s effect on impact investing reported that the pandemic has not made a significant dent in investments.
“I am curious to know what happens during this pandemic to impact investing as a whole investment class, as well as maybe what happens to our agricultural investments, if everybody is shifting toward health care investments, so that is what the project is really about,” Click said.
Click said he and Ledermann plan to send the survey out to about 300 self-identified impact investors and organizations and will then ask those investors for names of other possible respondents. He said this number will be able to provide a sample for the investing field.
Click said the survey will ask participants questions about how the pandemic has affected their investments and their social impact.
“We also think that there will be a shift – the first shift was a shift that we worried would shift resources out of agriculture and into health care – but we also think that there will be a shift that the investments in the future will be different, even if they are in agriculture,” he said. “The new investments whether in agriculture or health care are more likely to have bigger social impacts than the older investments.”
Jake Schwartz, a first-year graduate student working on the project, said his role as a research assistant is to contribute to the literature review and write a summary of all of the research completed to date on impact investing during the pandemic.
Schwartz said he also helped develop the survey, which is sent through an anonymous link by email to investors, organizations that conduct impact investing research, policymakers and advisers to impact investors.
“We are especially curious if the positive social impacts of impact investing have increased during this time because there has been a strain, say to the health care sectors or the agriculture sectors,” he said. “And so if that is the case, I think that would be a pretty big finding that impact investing is working in creating desired social impacts.”

Past senior class gift campaigns have raised more than $100,000 for the University.
Officials are delaying this year’s senior class gift campaign, instead launching it this spring as students continue remote instruction.
Amanda Nugent, the director of leadership and loyalty annual giving, said this year’s campaign will focus on connecting members of the senior class and encouraging them to stay engaged with GW as alumni. Development officials said they will also host events during the semester to connect seniors with current alumni.
“This year, the campaign’s focus is to connect the class with each other and the University to set them up for their lifelong relationship with GW as alumni,” Nugent said in an email. “Seniors will be invited to participate in events hosted by the Office of Alumni Relations and Annual Giving that will connect them with GW’s extensive alumni network. These events will range from networking opportunities to career advice and lifelong learning opportunities.”
Nugent added that officials do not have any fundraising goals for the campaign this year. Past senior class gift campaigns have typically raised more than $100,000 each year.
“We do not have any goals for the campaign this year,” Nugent said. “The campaign is focused on engaging, connecting and supporting the senior class.”
She added that officials will forego appointing seniors as student coordinators for the campaign, and the events will be promoted through a series of e-newsletters.
“Because of COVID-19, we are launching the campaign in the spring semester and our programming will be virtual rather than in person as has been the case in the past,” she said.
Nugent did not return a request for comment about what date the campaign will start.

Janice Blanchard, a professor of medicine, has interviewed residents across D.C. about their thoughts on COVID-19 restrictions and vaccines.
This story is part of The Hatchet’s semester-long project sharing stories of GW’s faculty members at the forefront of researching the COVID-19 pandemic. 
With the COVID-19 pandemic reaching its one-year mark in the District, a School of Medicine and Health Sciences professor has spent the past month interviewing locals about their perceptions of COVID-19 public health recommendations and their thoughts on the vaccine’s effectiveness.
Janice Blanchard, a professor of medicine and the chief of the section of health policy in the medical school, said she began her research project in mid-January and has since interviewed more than 20 residents over Zoom from all of the city’s eight wards. She said she hopes her research will help local health officials address disparities in the pandemic’s effects on the District.
“I am aware there are a lot of disparities already in D.C., and we have seen some of those augmented because of COVID, especially when you look east of the river where Wards 7 and 8 are located versus the other wards,” she said. “I have had a long interest in disparities, and I really wanted to look at what things were contributing to some of the disparities we see because of COVID.”
By the end of the project, she said she hopes to interview about 40 to 50 D.C. residents.
Blanchard, who is conducting her research using GW’s internal COVID-19 research fund, said she recruits interviewees in the D.C. area from patients at the GW Hospital’s emergency department, where she and her colleagues work. She said she plans to wrap up the research in about three months.
Blanchard said she and her colleagues are focused on all wards throughout D.C. but are paying particular attention to areas of the city, like Wards 5, 7 and 8, that have high rates of COVID-19 infections but low rates of vaccinations. She added that her research breaks down groups of participants by their age to get a complete representation of the city’s population.
Blachard said the idea for her project began through the emergency department after she treated patients diagnosed with the virus and became concerned about perceptions of COVID-19 guidelines and how they varied by ward.
She said the project is still in its early stages of data collection, but the interviews so far have revealed that people understand public health recommendations but lack access to the vaccine in wards with higher COVID-19 rates.
Based on her research, Blanchard said she will write an academic paper to disseminate the results to help city officials understand how to ensure that people have equal access to COVID-19 information. She said she hopes the research can help identify specific barriers to accessing the vaccine, which could include transportation or internet usage, that can help guide government officials on what aspects of their pandemic response to target.
“If we find out people are having problems getting the vaccine because of transportation or because of internet use or because of messaging they don’t trust, I am hoping we can use that information to really target some of those barriers we are seeing,” she said.
Blanchard said the chance to talk with District residents and find out more about them beyond a clinical setting is what she is enjoying most about conducting her research. In the clinical setting, she only gets to know why patients are in the emergency department and does not get the chance to delve into deeper issues, like their perceptions of public health guidelines, she said.
“I enjoy the opportunity to find out just a little bit more about patients in terms of what are other things that are going into their mindset about COVID,” she said. “We just don’t have time to talk to them about that in the clinical setting.”

Experts in higher education said the disparity in salaries among business professors is unrepresentative of salary disparities across higher education.
Female full professors in the School of Business are continuing to make slightly more money than their male counterparts this academic year.
Female full business professors are making 14 cents more for every dollar that their male counterparts make, according to data presented at this month’s Faculty Senate meeting. Experts in higher education said the disproportionate number of female faculty in the business school may distort that data, which indicate that female full and associate business professors make more money than male business professors.

“Gender inequity is an important issue in academia as well as in the business world,” business school Dean Anuj Mehrotra said in an email. “Hence it is of great concern to me as a dean. During my time at GWSB, I have endeavored to resolve these concerns by taking a systematic, market-based approach to faculty salary negotiations and have conducted salary equity reviews in collaboration with the Office of the Provost.”
Mehrotra said faculty salary varies by department. He said there is a gender disparity in salaries because of “where these faculty are located.”
Salary equity in the business school has decreased slightly for faculty over the past three years.
Female business professors made 18 cents more for every dollar that their male counterparts made in the 2018-2019 academic year, according to the core indicators report from last March. The number decreased to 15 cents more in the 2019-20 academic year and is now at 14 cents more for the current academic year.
Mehrotra said the decline in salaries is “primarily” driven by changes in personnel. He declined to say how faculty members have responded to the changes in salary equity in recent years.
Mehrotra said the equity ratio for assistant professors in the business school stands at 88.95 this academic year, indicating that for every dollar that male professors make, female professors make roughly 12 cents less. He said the difference could be due to male assistant professors often working in “higher-paying disciplines.”
“In addition, the Office of the Provost conducts an annual equity review of faculty salaries, including GWSB faculty salaries, and recommends equity adjustments be made when warranted,” he said.
Tom Barkley, a professor of finance practice at Syracuse University and the chair of the budget and fiscal affairs committee at Syracuse’s University Senate, said given the slowly declining equity ratio in the business school in the past three years, the difference in salaries could be the result of a few female professors whose salaries are “disproportionately high,” distorting the overall ratio.
“Let’s say as other male salaries come up, then the ratios are going to decrease and tend to get closer to 100,” he said. “But without seeing the actual data and being able to play with it, it sounds to me that there is a female professor who gets a really good salary and that has thrown the ratios a little bit out of whack.”
There are 11 female full professors and 26 male full professors in the business school this year, according to the core indicators report. These numbers have remained largely the same with only slight fluctuations since the 2018-19 academic year, when there were 10 female professors and 29 male professors in the school.
Tyler Bickford, the chair of the university senate budget policies committee at the University of Pittsburgh, said that because the number of professors in the business school is “too small,” a few highly paid female professors may bring up the average. He said business schools don’t generally pay female full professors more than their male counterparts.
“There are some well-paid women full professors within the business school, but I don’t think that’s the expression of some broader trend or generalization about how full professor pay works in North America,” Bickford said.
He said in most higher education institutions, women are more likely to be overrepresented in lower ranks like non-tenured track positions, especially in schools or fields that often have lower pay.
Female professors make up 29.7 percent of all full business professors this year, 33.3 percent of all associate professors and 36.8 percent of all assistant professors, according to this year’s core indicators report.
Charles Chang, the chair of the equity and inclusion committee in Boston University’s Faculty Council, said if the University is willing to acknowledge and actively work toward decreasing the salary disparity between female and male professors, then female faculty members would have an “advantageous” position to bargain for higher salaries and more resources.
“As the business school faculty better approximates a 1 to 1, male-to-female faculty ratio, then there’s less of a disparity in terms of the drive to retain faculty of a particular gender,” he said.
He said if female full professors remain underrepresented in the school, officials could be pressured to tend to negotiations with potential new hires to maintain retention while increasing those professors’ salary rates.
“The loss of a male faculty member from the business school doesn’t hurt as much as the loss of a female faculty member from the business school because the loss of a male faculty member doesn’t increase the gender disparity,” Chang said.

Basement dining capacity in District House is limited to 25 percent capacity, in accordance with D.C.'s guidelines for indoor dining.
Three GWorld vendors have reopened in District House over the past month, providing a few more options for students struggling to find open vendors this semester.
Chick-fil-A, Kin’s Sushi and GRK Fresh Greek reopened in District House for the first time since the outbreak of COVID-19 in D.C., expanding options with 1,500 students returning to campus this semester. Residential students said the openings expand their dining options, but limited hours and a lack of affordable options have intensified food insecurity while more than 30 GWorld vendors remain closed.
Karen Zinn, the associate vice president of business services, said Sol Mexican Grill reopened last fall, Chick-fil-A reopened last month and both GRK and Kin’s reopened earlier this month in the District basement. Officials cut basement seating to 25 percent capacity – per D.C.’s dining restrictions – and limit access to students on campus.
Zinn said safety is the “top priority” driving reopening guidelines, which require COVID-19 testing for employees and the installation of hand sanitizer dispensers, social distancing signage and plexiglass barriers at registers.
“In addition to District House, other on-campus dining partners who have direct street front access are open for the spring, and the University is working closely with all dining partners to promote their businesses and work with them through this difficult time so that they may remain open for our community,” Zinn said in an email.
Zinn said officials partnered with the Office of Campus Living and Residential Education to promote dining options for students on campus via email and social media. She said District House vendors follow public health “advice and direction” from the Milken Institute School of Public Health, the D.C. government and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to keep dining safe.
Zinn declined to say whether any additional GWorld vendors will reopen this semester.
Kostas Loi, a manager at GRK Fresh Greek, said he had to wait for officials to greenlight GRK’s return to District before reopening earlier this month, and business has been “very slow” during the first two weeks back. He said GRK has reeled in about 10 to 12 customers per day, which he said doesn’t even reach 10 percent of the number of daily customers from before the pandemic.
Loi said dining officials had been discussing the prospect of reopening the location for about three to four months before February, brainstorming when and how to reopen as more students returned. He said he hopes GRK will be able to maintain operations deeper into the semester, but the number of student customers, who make up 95 percent of the clientele base, will ultimately determine the business’s future.
“Hopefully, like I said, people will come back and we start to be normal, the way it was,” he said. “We don’t know that, but at least being able to pay rent and expenses to be open.”
GWorld vendors have suffered from the lack of student customers on campus over the past year with the pandemic keeping the majority of students off campus.
Zoubida Bicane, a sophomore living in Shenkman Hall, said finding affordable dining options has been challenging despite the vendors reopening in District House, where she buys meals about twice a week. She added that some vendors close earlier than their hours posted online suggest.
Bicane said she buys groceries from Trader Joe’s and cooks most of her meals to account for the shortage of campus vendors and avoids “really expensive” prices at Whole Foods. She said she hopes more vendors like Bindaas, Gallery Gourmet Market and Dunkin’ Donuts reopen later this semester.
“It’s been hard finding other vendors, other restaurants that I’ve been used to going to since freshman year that just aren’t available because a lot of them have closed down, so it’s been pretty difficult,” Bicane said.
Edy Koenigs, a freshman living in Shenkman Hall, said she’s also struggled to find dining options on campus, noting that the majority of spots that are currently open are more expensive than others that are currently closed. She said limited hours, like Chick-fil-A’s 6 p.m. closing time, limit meal options.
“GW in general can be expensive, but the places that are available to students, especially students in special circumstances, isn’t the best right now,” Koenigs said.
Koenig said she’s waiting for more vendors in Shenkman Hall, where Potbelly Sandwich Shop currently operates, to open for residential students, since she doesn’t have time to commute to other more affordable spots, like local grocery stores.
Freshman Genevieve Mumma, who lives in Shenkman Hall, said finding campus dining options has become “significantly easier” with vendors reopening in District, where she’s bought meals at least once a week. Mumma said she finds the close location helpful because it’s near her friends who live in the building and offers space to study.
“The reopening of those popular places has definitely been beneficial to me,” Mumma said. “I’d say I’ve been to Chick-fil-A probably an unhealthy number of times since it’s opened, and like I said before, it’s just very convenient because a lot of students like to go to that basement in District to work. I’ve gone down there a lot to refocus.”
But Mumma said dining hours at District vendors like Chick-fil-A have been “confusing” and “contradictory” since the location will sometimes open late after it’s slated to start service at 11 a.m. She said dining options on campus remain limited and fail to match the level of availability she expected before arriving on campus last fall.
“It’s a little disappointing on how their dining is a lot more limited than I expected, especially because GW doesn’t have dining halls, and we have that more untraditional approach to it,” she said.
A representative for Kin’s did not return a request for comment. A representative for Chick-fil-A couldn’t be reached for comment.

All but one fire alarm triggered on campus in 2021 thus far has been related to an incident at District House.
District House residents have been forced to evacuate their residence hall nine times since the start of January because of a string of fire alarms triggered by kitchen smoke.
University spokesperson Crystal Nosal said six alarms were set off in January followed by three so far this month, each of which have cleared out the entire residence hall. She said students’ cooking has caused every alarm during the period, twice triggering alarms on back-to-back days, which has forced students to evacuate while they’re trying to quarantine, isolate or distance indoors.
“This is an opportunity to remind students who have just returned to campus about residence hall safety,” Nosal said in an email. “The increase in fire alarms in District House is solely related to cooking. Students should take the policy on banned items seriously and avoid bringing those items into residence halls. If students are cooking, they should supervise the cooking tools at all times.”
Nosal said kitchen smoke triggered six of the nine incidents and attributed two to cooking and one to a small oven fire. She said students who are isolating or quarantining because of COVID-19 still need to evacuate the building “in a safe and timely manner” like everyone else, ensuring they wear a face covering, abide by social distancing and return to their rooms “immediately” after the evacuation period ends.
All other students must also distance themselves from others during evacuations to uphold COVID-19 safety protocol, Nosal added.
“Students are responsible for evacuating the building in a safe and timely manner while wearing masks and maintaining social distance, as they do with everything else on campus,” she said.
Nosal said D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services has responded to the alarms, and responders have filed “general orders” about each incident involving DC FEMS. She said building supervisors analyze the situation when they arrive at the scene of an alarm to determine the appropriate response.
Nosal said only one fire alarm in 2021 has come from a building other than District.
Students living in the building said the evacuations create crowds of up to 40 people waiting to reenter the building, disrupting daily schedules and raising concerns about how to safely follow distancing protocols amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Olivia Upham, a senior living in District House, said she doesn’t feel safe during the alarm evacuations because students pack together in a group of about 30 near the building’s entrance to escape the cold weather and wait to reenter the building. She said she takes the stairs to return to her seventh-floor room after leaving the crowded area since social distancing typically doesn’t occur on the elevators.
Upham said about half of the alarms have interrupted an online class or her work shift with the University Writing Center, during which she’s had to log off her computer to evacuate.
“It’s just wild – people are touching each other waiting to get back into the building,” she said. “It’s just so packed.”
Abigail Ingoglia, a sophomore living in District House, said two alarms went off while she was quarantining after testing positive for COVID-19 last month. She said she stayed isolated in her room during both evacuations and wasn’t sure how to balance COVID-19 and fire safety.
“I was worried I would get in trouble either way, leaving or staying, and I didn’t want to put anyone at risk,” Ingoglia said.
Ingoglia said dozens of students stand nearby when she evacuates the building onto H Street during a fire alarm, but security officers try to encourage students to distance themselves from each other. She said she hopes officials start to warn students ahead of a drill and continue to encourage “higher safety measures.”
“When they do drills, I don’t know if they are legally allowed to give us a heads up, but if they could do that, that would be great,” she said.
Senior Jane Meiter, who’s lived in District House for the past three years, said frequent fire alarms have always been common in the building, but they have never sounded this frequently.
During evacuations, which range from 20 to 40 minutes, Meiter said students try to distance themselves, leaving two to three steps of separation while descending the building but gathering closer together at the bottom of the stairwell as they head outside. Students proceed to “spread out” or visit a nearby store like CVS once they’re outside, she said.
“It’s quite loud and disruptive, and it says the same thing every five times: ‘Please evacuate the building,’” she said. “It’s just really frustrating and morale damaging. I would suppose you just feel like you’re being dragged out of your life every week.”
District has more occupants this spring than last semester after the number of students on campus tripled following two weekends of move-in last month.
Meiter said the absence of resident advisers could have contributed to the frequency of fire alarms because freshmen and transfer students in the building might not understand cooking protocol or fire alarm sensitivity and don’t have an RA as a resource for help.
The University issued students an email earlier this month after the second alarm in two days, reminding them about cooking safety, smoke detector information and evacuation protocol. But Meiter said the email was late in keeping the number of evacuations, potentially dangerous during the pandemic, to a minimum.
“I think that that was something that should have been given at the beginning when people arrived because it’s been a problem,” she said. “It’s always a problem.”
