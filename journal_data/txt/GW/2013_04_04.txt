The University Honors Program will tone down the rigor of its capstone course for seniors next fall, stripping away written assignments in the previously research-based class and instead focusing on community building and discussion.
The change will give honors students more time to work on a thesis for their major, which can be in any GW school. Now, most students in the honors program write a 10-page paper in a one-credit course. Next year, the discussion-based courses, which will not include grades or papers, will be capped at fifteen students.
The honors course will emphasize broad, liberal arts-based questions rather than focusing on using the research and writing skills the students developed throughout their time in the relatively exclusive program.
“It just seems like a perfect fit because we get to return to these essential, enduring questions that we started off the honors program experience with,” said Mark Ralkowski, a philosophy professor who helped develop the new capstone. “And we get to return to the intimacy of these small, extremely evocative seminar class formats.”
Capstone courses are common for undergraduates at GW, though not required for every graduating senior at the University, which has been trying to emphasize undergraduate research in recent years.
Researchers at liberal arts colleges published in January that capstone courses usually live up to their lofty goals of increasing academic rigor.
But although capstone courses may improve students’ skills, Ralkowski said a more job-centered approach “can be a little wrong-headed because, I think, there’s a lot more to one’s education that simply getting ready for the job market.”
Director of the University Honors Program Maria Frawley said in an email that the move comes after a yearlong review by honors program faculty, which looked at revitalizing the course by providing a climactic experience without demanding more work.
Some current capstone courses are also taught by adjunct professors, while next year’s classes will be led by full-time honors faculty.
Frawley said the new course will bring honors students together with an honors professor they had previously had, one of about 20 at GW, to reflect on their time at GW.
“Another goal is for you to have a more relaxed academic experience – to engage in intellectual discussion without the ‘carrot or the stick’ of grading,” Frawley wrote.
Although the students will not be completing any assignments while taking the seminar, Ralkowski said the value of coming together one last time for an honors seminar is “obvious to honors students.” Honors program faculty have not yet determined how the course will be represented on the students’ transcripts.
The changes in the honors program come as departments across the University try to upgrade or maintain capstone courses and the faculty time they require.
In the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences, GW’s largest school, 63 percent of students are required to complete a capstone course for their majors. The philosophy department, for example, requires seniors to enroll either in two proseminars during their senior year, or take one proseminar and write a thesis.
Associate Dean for Undergraduate Studies Dan Ullman said capstone projects emphasize the skills and knowledge a student has mastered throughout their college education.
He said he would be in favor of requiring all Columbian College graduates to complete a capstone course, but was unsure whether it had been under discussion.
Universities across the country face challenges of faculty and resource constraints when thinking of how to build up its offering of capstone courses, said Dan Berrett, a reporter at the Chronicle of Higher Education.
“The problem seems to be that it is a resource issue when everyone in the program has to do them. They are very resource intensive,” he said.
Barry Chiswick, chair of the economics department, said that the department’s proseminar requirements stress the importance of communication by teaching students how to present original research and relate to employers.
Chiswick said staffing its proseminars has been one of the department’s largest challenges because of an influx of majors, but he said he still thinks the value is high.

It’s been nearly five months since GW announced it had been inflating freshman class rank data for a decade and got kicked off U.S. News & World Report’s rankings.
For these last five months, administrators have refused to answer questions about the sudden exit of the Office of Admissions’ top leader just one month after the unranking. They also conducted an audit of admissions data from only the past year, despite errors in a decade’s worth of data. And there is no written record of that audit.
The new leader of the admissions office, whose hire was announced last week, must restore trust and increase transparency after arriving at GW in July.
Laurie Koehler, the former dean of admissions at Bryn Mawr College, will manage admissions, financial aid and the registrar.
Koehler is no new face in the world of college admissions. Before her time at Bryn Mawr, she worked in admissions offices across the country, including the University of Virginia and Cornell and Miami universities.
But GW is recovering from a very public mistake that made headlines across local and national news outlets. Regardless of previous experience, Koehler must understand the shortcomings of the previous admissions dean to find success.
When U.S. News unranked GW in November, the University community was surprised and upset – and rightfully so. And administrators’ failure to conduct a thorough investigation of the last 10 years of admissions data is mind-boggling. For an accurate picture of GW admissions throughout the years – and to map an accurate admissions strategy moving forward – Koehler must conduct an audit of that decade of data.
The unranking and the subsequent lack of transparency are no longer daily topics of conversation on campus. Another admissions cycle is about to end seemingly unscathed, with application rates similar to those of past years. Officials also don’t expect fundraising to take a hit.
The unranking has faded into a campus-wide joke.
But GW isn’t off the hook.
Former dean Kathryn Napper resigned with little explanation in December, a month after the scandal broke, ending her 15-year career at GW. And the admissions office has been largely silent since it disclosed that it inflated data.
Six months may have passed, but questions still remain. Administrators have yet to answer questions as to the origin of the error, or explain why, despite the controversy, they claimed it occurred “without malice.”
As a new face takes over the admissions office, she still has old business to address.

Whether you’re counting calories, choosing a salad over a slice of J Street pizza or resisting the urge to grab a snack from GW Deli as a substitute for lunch, balancing a diet is often a daunting task for college students. And students who keep kosher have even more dietary obstacles.
About 30 percent of students identify as Jewish, and The Hatchet reported last fall that many were frustrated by the lack of kosher options on campus. Last summer, GW nixed Nosh, the kosher deli in J Street, and many complained that the kosher fridge available at J Street simply wasn’t adequate.
To accommodate Jewish students, the Student Dining Board and Campus Support Services added the kosher Wraps2Go catering to J Street and introduced Eli’s – a popular kosher restaurant near Dupont Circle – to GWorld.
Chair of the Student Dining Board Mike Morgan told me the board is proud of its efforts to accommodate kosher students and after exploring all other options, the board does not believe it needs to further expand kosher options.
But I disagree.
Eating a wrap or food from the freezer every day is bound to get old quickly. And Eli’s is out of the way for most students, especially when balancing extracurriculars and homework or, even worse, when living on the Mount Vernon Campus.
That’s why the University should offer a kosher meal plan option.
Under this system, students could sign up for the meal plan at the beginning of the year just as they do for the regular J Street meal plan so they can have access to hot meals every day. And given the list of participating students, the University would have a good idea of how much food to prepare daily so that an adequate amount of kosher options could be prepared.
This proposal isn’t new. In 2001, members of the campus community came up with the same idea.
But now that the GW Hillel plans to renovate its building in the near future, and add in-house kosher eating options, this seems like the perfect time to introduce a specialized meal plan to complement Hillel’s efforts.
Other universities do more to accommodate students with specific dietary needs. Take Syracuse University, for example, which has a kosher kitchen at one of its dining halls. There, the dining is closely regulated, preparation is carefully overseen and foods are inspected for proper shipping and storage. In addition, the school has secured other kosher vendors on campus to provide a multitude of options for kosher diets.
And while there are roughly 40 to 50 students on campus who keep kosher, the University should work to ensure that all students’ dietary needs are adequately met.

A 7-2 lead in the sixth inning seemed safe. It appeared head coach Gregg Ritchie would go home with bragging rights over George Mason – the Orange Line and soon-to-be A-10 rival.
Adding an extra edge for GW’s head coach? It’s the university that two of his children attend and the place where he almost committed to play college baseball instead of GW.
But the five-run margin quickly evaporated into a 9-7 deficit after a three-run Patriots eighth inning earned George Mason its first lead of the game, along with some serious momentum. Undaunted, the Colonials came up with a four-run ninth inning, punctuated with a two out, three-run double by senior Tyler McCarthy.
“They are getting a winning mentality,” Ritchie said. “They’re embracing that, and they’re playing as hard as they can every single pitch, every single inning and giving themselves a chance.”
The team’s efforts were not squandered Tuesday afternoon at George Mason, as it pulled off an 11-9 win.
“I have bragging rights at the house right now, which is really nice,” Ritchie said. “I get to go home and tell my kids to wear that one.”
Ritchie used his entire bench to hold onto the win, led by two starters, juniors Owen Beightol and Brookes Townsend. Beightol went two-for-four with two runs scored and a home run. Townsend, the versatile second baseman, also went two-for-four with one run scored and one run batted in. Towsend’s run, the first of GW’s four in the ninth, was a result of his 2-2 hit-by-pitch.
“He’s got that internal fire that you like all your players to have, and it doesn’t matter whether he’s being completely successful at the moment or not. That fire’s always there for him,” Ritchie said. “The team can feed off a guy like that.”
Townsend proved to be GW’s crucial baserunner, and the Colonials continued to battle. But a strikeout left GW with two outs and a runner on first, down two. Then, an error, one of four for George Mason, in the next at-bat kept the line moving. Freshman Tyler Fairbanks had a huge single to keep the rally alive, loading up the bases for McCarthy, who doubled over the left fielder’s head, leading to a bases-clearing double and most importantly, the lead. Senior Matthew Murakami then added on an insurance run with a base hit back up the middle off a 3-2 pitch.
The pitching was not as solid for the Colonials, though. Senior Brian Derner started the game but only lasted one and two thirds innings. Derner yielded one run but gave up four walks.
Normally reliable, closer junior Craig Lejeune could not come in the eighth to stop the bleeding as he gave up one run on two hits, while putting no one away. Instead, freshman Bobby Lewarne came in to pitch and threw two innings of scoreless ball, only giving up one hit.
“The beautiful thing about games like this is it gives other guys the opportunity to become better players. It gives them the opportunity to find the groove, get a little confidence, for guys like Fairbanks and Lewarne,” Ritchie said.
Next, GW will host A-10 opponent Richmond, which sits at 3-3 in the conference. The Colonials will look to build off of the roller-coaster ride of a win over the Patriots, Ricthie said.
“So although it’s a win, and it’s all about the W, we got to get to work on Wednesday and Thursday so we can go and compete really hard against Richmond,” Ritchie said.

As a town parade meandered through rural Vermont streets, then 7-year-old Damian Legacy wandered away to a church.
Years later, as a teenager, he joined his local church choir to coax his non-religious family to step foot into the parish. And after receiving his driver’s license, the first place Legacy ventured to, rife with elation over his newfound teenage freedom, was his church.
“There was always a draw to the church, a subtle pull, a little invitation,” Legacy, a senior, said of his call to his faith. “Everybody has a happy place. Mine is an empty church. That is the most serene and blissfully content that I have ever felt.”
Now on the precipice of graduation, the openly gay student is an ordained priest within the North American Old Catholic Church, which encourages LGBT members to join its clergy. Legacy was ordained in October, and since then, has held personal morning masses and structured prayer sessions six times a day. He also hosts masses for other students in his City Hall room.
The co-founder of Dignity GW, a campus group for LGBT Catholics that he started in 2011, Legacy rallied for same-sex marriage outside the Supreme Court last week in his clerical collar. He said when he came out at the age of 15, his religious mentors embraced him before his parents did.
Raised in a home where religion was of little importance and discussions of God were few, Legacy’s first interactions with faith were through the Roman Catholic Church through his grandparents. Yet the tenets of Roman Catholicism, which ban same-sex relationships, were in conflict with his personal identity.
Legacy viewed his sexuality as intended by God, an initial deterrent from a heterosexual married life.
“At this point, I was at the mercy of the catechism. It was, ‘I am ‘intrinsically disordered’, this is my call to celibacy, this is my call to priestly celibacy, this is God making me the way that I am so I can be a good priest. If I’m not attracted to women, then I’m not going to be called to matrimony, I’m going to be called to Holy Orders,” Legacy said.
Open about his sexuality, Legacy pursued the priesthood within the denomination, completing the ordination processes at night after his classes. He also serves as a volunteer chaplain at local nursing homes and a Maryland fire department.
“People say, ‘You don’t have a parish.’ Well, I do. My parish is my firehouse, my parish is my firefighters, my parish is the nursing home I say mass at,” Legacy said. “A parish is not necessarily the four walls of a church. My flock is anyone seeking a relationship with God.”
Two lives, one choice
Senior Blake Bergen remembers a crucifix affixed to the edge of Legacy’s bed in Thurston Hall freshman year. It is now one religious ornament among many in his City Hall room, which contains a dresser-turned-altar, a tabernacle and numerous faith-related paintings – and his friend’s stringent devotion to his denomination.
Both frequented the Newman Center, Legacy out of piety, Bergen out of curiosity. Bergen, raised Jewish, identifies as agnostic, but pursued extensive study of Catholicism to understand his friend’s faith and present Christianity to Legacy as compatible with his homosexuality.
“He was really struggling with his sexuality at that point, really struggling with his faith. It was really difficult to watch,” Bergen said.
In their sophomore year, Legacy and Bergen spearheaded a Newman Center pilgrimage from Rome to Madrid in time for World Youth Day, an annual religious gathering aimed at uniting Catholic youth.
Bergen and Legacy said that the Newman Center’s Father Greg Shaffer approved their coordination of the trip, but that when each pursued executive board positions in the LGBT organization Allied in Pride, Shaffer asked them to step down.
“The way it was worded to me was, I could choose a life in the church, or I could choose a life in the flesh,” Legacy said. “I went with that which isn’t forcing me to choose. [Father Shaffer] is making me choose between the church and my sexuality, but my sexuality isn’t making me choose between it and the church.”
Legacy and Bergen said Shaffer was aware of their sexuality since they began participating at the Newman Center their freshman year.
“The Church’s teachings are clear and known universally, and the Church cannot support groups or movements that run contrary to Church doctrine,” Shaffer said. [This] didn’t preclude them from attending World Youth Day with the Newman Center group; however, we later reached a mutual understanding that they wouldn’t participate with [us] based on practical considerations.”
The conversation, Legacy said, catalyzed a shift in his personal theological convictions – but also personal strife.
Legacy described his own personal “dark ages” as he doubted his faith and grappled with feeling “less than human.”
-He sought refuge in Dignity Washington, a community of LGBT Christians based in Dupont Circle. Later, after meeting a bishop of the North American Old Catholic Church at his volunteer fire department, Legacy pursued priesthood within the denomination.
The church, unaffiliated with Roman Catholicism, allows divorced members to take communion, priests and bishops to marry and women and gays to be ordained.
‘Living a life for God’
Legacy rallied for marriage rights at the Supreme Court last week, adorned in full clerical garb at each protest.
Meditating on the teachings espoused by his first Catholic church, Legacy acknowledged his conception of Biblical policy versus practice on matters of marriage.
“Divorced people aren’t supposed to get remarried, but it doesn’t really matter. You don’t see the church holding rallies against divorced people,” Legacy said. “There’s certain things that they overlook.”
He said he has reconciled his sexuality with his faith. Acknowledging his priesthood as his personal vocation, he said he hoped the Catholic church would afford same-sex couples the support to fulfill their “vocation to matrimony” with their partners.
And when in doubt, Legacy returns to a homily that resounded through his church walls as a boy.
“‘God makes straight all of our paths. All of our paths will lead home,’” Legacy said. “Gay, straight, divorced but remarried, what’s it matter if you live your life for God?”

The University’s acceptance rate stood at about 33 percent for the third consecutive year.
A total of 33.4 percent of candidates were offered spots in the next freshman class, Vice Provost for Academic Affairs and Planning Forrest Maltzman said Sunday.
The admissions office has struggled to boost GW’s selectivity since the rate fell to a record low of 31.7 percent in 2010, after accepting 36.8 percent of applicants in 2009.
“I care more about the quality of the student body we enroll than about the acceptance rate,” Maltzman said. “Our primary goal needs to be to bring in a great class, and this is what admissions is appropriately focused on.”
Just under 22 percent of students accepted this week will need to enroll for the University to meet its target class size of 2,350 freshmen.
Candidates accepted under the University’s binding early decision cycles already account for 41 percent of the Class of 2017.  The early acceptance rate jumped nearly four points earlier this year, from 37.5 percent last year.
Maltzman said the acceptance rate could fluctuate if the University reaches into its waitlist.
While GW’s selectivity stagnated, at least five institutions that GW considers its peers, including Boston, Duke, Northwestern and Tufts universities and the University of Southern California,  became more selective.
Boston University brought its acceptance rate down nine points from last year, to 36 percent, after receiving nearly 20 percent more applications.
GW’s applicant pool increased by 1 percent from last year, totalling about 21,982 applications – a figure University spokeswoman Jill Sankey said GW was content to see.
“Increasing applications for the sake of increasing selectivity does not make us a better institution,” Sankey said. “What makes us a great institution is enrolling a diverse, talented and academically gifted student body.”
This is the first year that Maltzman, a top administrator and professor, has overseen the admissions process, since Kathryn Napper retired from her post as dean of admissions in December.
It is also GW’s first application cycle after it was booted off the U.S. News & World Report best colleges ranking last fall, days after the disclosure that the admissions office inflated freshman class rank data. Since the unranking, Maltzman has said the University’s admissions cycle would not suffer collateral damage.
The University hired Bryn Mawr College admissions dean Laurie Koehler on Thursday to fill the newly established position of senior associate provost for enrollment. She will begin overseeing the financial aid, registrar and admissions offices July 1 and help choose the next dean of admissions.

Updated April 4, 2013, 2:11 p.m.
Two gay seniors who said they felt alienated by the Newman Center’s controversial priest will launch a campaign this week to force him off campus.
At least a dozen students, including seniors Damian Legacy and Blake Bergen, say they have left the Newman Center in the last several years because Father Greg Shaffer’s strong anti-gay and anti-abortion views are too polarizing. Shaffer, a Roman Catholic priest, has spent five years preaching to GW students.
The former Newman Center members are creating a video with testimony from 10 other Catholic students, who cite Shaffer as the reason they left the chapel, hoping to inflame a largely liberal campus and force University administrators to act. Legacy and Bergen also plan to file a formal complaint with the University and hold prayer vigils outside the Newman Center until Shaffer is removed.
The students lambasted Shaffer’s counseling sessions, in which he said he advises students who are attracted to members of the same sex to remain celibate for the rest of their lives. They also criticized the priest for a fiery blog post he wrote last May, calling gay relationships “unnatural and immoral” after President Barack Obama came out in support of same-sex marriage.
“We have to appeal to him. In the end, he’s the one preaching on Sunday. He’s the one counseling these students,” Legacy said. “The money doesn’t matter to him, but when you see the faces of the people you’re turning away, you see the people who say ‘Oh, I would go to church all the time, but I don’t like Father Greg.’ When you meet them at their level, that’s going to hit them harder because it’s something they’re going to understand.”
Legacy and Bergen will deliver a letter this week to top administrators including University President Steven Knapp, citing academic studies that link harmful psychological effects, like the inability to sleep and loss of appetite, with being around homophobic behavior.
GW’s Office for Diversity and Inclusion is already reviewing the case, after Legacy submitted a report last semester that outlined how other schools vet religious leaders before bringing them to campus.
New York University approves all religious affiliates by reviewing backgrounds, credentials and letters of recommendation from the faith community, as well as qualifications that indicate they can work with college-aged students. Legacy said GW would benefit from a similar system.
Vice Provost for Diversity and Inclusion Terri Harris Reed declined to comment on specifics about the report, saying that her office is in the “early stages of a review” of the Multicultural Student Services Center, which oversees religious life, “so it is premature to speak about the possibility or feasibility of any changes.”
Aside from the appeal to GW, Legacy and Bergen will also send letters to D.C.’s Roman Catholic archdiocese, who heads the Church for the entire District and is responsible for choosing priests’ assignments.
Legacy will also ask the Student Association to defund the Newman Center as part of the SA’s annual allocations process to organizations April 15. This year, the Newman Center received $10,000 from the SA, which divvies up funds from a budget accumulated through student fees.
Earlier this semester, the SA Senate passed a bill that allows the finance committee to dock a third of a group’s budget if the University finds a group is discriminatory or harasses individuals. The GW Catholics – based out of the Newman Center – have not been found to be either, but Legacy and Bergen said the bill could bolster their argument.
‘Religious rights’
The Newman Center, while affiliated with GW, is officially a part of the Roman Catholic Church. The GW Catholics is the largest Catholic student group on campus.
While students attend the Newman Center, the University does not have control over any religious outposts on campus.
Reed said “the university response to formal complaints depends on the specific allegations,” adding that GW supports the LGBT community.
“GW strives to maintain a community where individuals’ are free to express their religious beliefs and also respect the rights of others who have differing beliefs,” Reed said. “GW also supports free speech and takes seriously the role a university should play in encouraging expression of many points of view, even those we dislike or disagree with.”
And Shaffer said he has religious freedom and freedom of speech on his side, calling them “important rights that play a vital role at a diverse university like GW.”
‘A battle for my soul’
During his freshman and sophomore years, Legacy spent nearly all his time outside of classes at the Newman Center, and regularly served the altar during mass. When Legacy called Shaffer in the middle of the night, he knew his spiritual adviser would answer.
But when Shaffer found out that Legacy was in a relationship with another male student, and he and Bergen were both running for leadership positions in Allied in Pride, they were shoved out. Legacy, then a sophomore, said he remembers Shaffer calling him wicked and faithless for being gay, and said it destroyed his “sense of self.”
“To have my faith leader view me that way, just because of one piece of the way that God made me, and to think that one part is responsible for the destruction of my human dignity, it just didn’t, I can’t even begin to describe the mental conflict that it creates,” Legacy said.
Legacy, who was on the path to Catholic priesthood, said Shaffer’s counseling and teachings, in which he indicated that Legacy was “intrinsically disordered” because he was gay, set him on an emotional rollercoaster for months.
One day, he would practice celibacy, and the next day, he denounced faith. He remembers at one point ripping the Vatican Flag down from over his bed and throwing his cross across his room.
“At the time, I thought it was a battle for my soul,” Legacy said, stuttering, losing words to continue.
And while Legacy said he is now more comfortable with both his sexuality and his religion, and has since become an ordained priest in the Old Catholic Church in October, he said he doesn’t want anyone else seeking Shaffer’s counseling to feel that same torment.
‘A second father, a big brother and a spiritual guide’
President of the GW Catholics Justyna Felusiak called the Newman Center an “accepting environment” and said Shaffer has been a key figure in each members’ college experience.
“He was there when I was at my best and worst and never failed to be fair and without judgment in his approach,” Felusiak said in an email.
Multiple members of the GW Catholics chose not to comment about their personal experiences with Shaffer, deferring to GW Catholics Vice President Joseph McHenry, who provided statements on behalf of the group.
Junior Chris Crawford said aside from his parents, no one has had “as positive an impact” on his life than Shaffer.
“Fr. Greg is like a second father, a big brother and a spiritual guide all wrapped into one. He has had an immensely positive impact on all of us at the Newman Center, and this campus would be much worse off without his comforting, loving presence,” Crawford said.
He said that he talks to Shaffer “about everything” and that Shaffer provides him with wisdom while still being open and honest.
‘It still affects you’
Bergen, who was raised Jewish but identifies as an agnostic, supported his friend on his spiritual journey to priesthood. After Legacy brought a bible to their first date, Bergen decided to learn as much as he could about Catholicism and developed a personal relationship with Shaffer along the way.
But almost two years later, he still gets chills when he recalls Shaffer reading a passage of the Bible to him: Romans 1:24-32. Shaffer said that because he was gay, the descriptions applied to him.
“They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity…They are gossips, slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; they have no understanding, no fidelity, no love, no mercy,” Bergen said, tearing while reading the passage Shaffer had read to him two years ago aloud.
“Although they know God’s righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them,” he said.
Legacy said he has since forgiven Shaffer, but will always feel the mental scars.
“It still affects you. It’s still there. But as much of a hardship and as damaging as it was, I wouldn’t be here without it. That’s not to say it’s acceptable,” Legacy said. “It’s not. And if I can prevent it from happening to anyone else, I’m going to.”
This article was updated April 4, 2013 to reflect the following:
A previous version of this article stated that the Newman Center’s Father Greg Shaffer learned Damian Legacy was dating Blake Bergen and seeking an Allied in Pride leadership position. Legacy was not dating Bergen at the time, though they were friends. The Hatchet also referred to the Bible passage Romans 1:24-32 as Romans 24:32. We regret these errors.

A Student Association senator and LGBT leader is lobbying the University to allow applicants to identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender to better cater services toward those populations.
Student Association Sen. Nick Gumas, CCAS-U, who is also president of Allied in Pride, said adding the optional question to the application is crucial because it would be the only way to track the size of the LGBT population and understand what types of resources, such as counseling, to institute.
“It’s basically a giant mystery whenever the University does something for the LGBT community. It’s essentially a giant guess,” Gumas said.
Gumas presented a nonbinding SA resolution Monday to push the University to add the question to applications. The bill passed unanimously.
Gumas’ effort comes about a semester after president of the graduate Allied in Pride group Michael Komo lobbied the GW Law School to add the question to its application. GW applicants currently have the option of disclosing race, ethnicity and religion.
Terri Reed, vice provost for diversity and inclusion, said the University will decide whether to add the question to admissions applications after a new dean of admissions is hired this summer.
“We understand that issues of sexual and gender identity inclusion and visibility are important in higher education and that some colleges and universities are considering whether to add an optional LGBT identity question to their own applications,” Reed said.
She added that the University will “continue to include in our admissions applications questions that will help us attain a class that is diverse and talented.”
The addition could also allow GW to remain at the forefront of LGBT support in the nation. Only two other colleges – the University of Iowa and Elmhurst College in Illinois – already ask students on their application if they identify as gay or transgender.
“The question helps signify to an applicant that, the fact they’re even asking shows the University is cognizant of your needs,” said Komo, who served as Allied in Pride’s president for three years as an undergraduate.
Komo said the question will also help pair up people looking for networking opportunities and mentors on the undergraduate level.
The University made national headlines in 2010, when it became one of the first to offer gender-neutral housing across campus. GW added an LGBT studies minor two years ago, in addition to an LGBT resource center. GW also regularly earns high rankings from the nonprofit Campus Pride’s national listing of LGBT-friendly colleges and universities.
Gumas said he thinks that if GW were able to tally the number of LGBT students on campus, some students would be surprised to find the population smaller than they expect.
About 10 percent of D.C. residents are gay, according to a Gallup poll released this February.
“To put it bluntly, we think there are more gay people here than there actually are, just because they are vocal, but there are not as many as you think,” Gumas said.
Gumas, a sophomore, said he hopes to be elected as Allied in Pride president again next year, and said he would reach out to more student organizations, such as the GW Republicans and the Black Student Union, to collaborate on events. This year, he helped organize the fraternity drag show Allied in Greek, part of his mission to reinforce “that being gay is an identity, but it’s not your only identity.”
This article was updated April 4, 2013 to reflect the following:
A previous version of this article stated that Nick Gumas and the Student Association were lobbying for undergraduate applications to add the LGBT identification question. They are lobbying for the question to be added to applications University-wide, not exclusively to undergraduate applications. We regret this error.
