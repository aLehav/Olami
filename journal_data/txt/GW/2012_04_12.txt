What is it about this part of the semester that makes everyone’s computer crash? How is it that all the printers in Gelman seem to go awry in the spring?
And why is it whenever these things happen, it seems our entire livelihoods – mine included – are halted until these malfunctions are resolved?
A few weeks ago, my computer broke down while I was writing a paper in the library. I panicked. With two papers due in a couple of days, it was the worst possible time to have my computer malfunction.
I took the computer to the Apple store, thrust the laptop at the employee and frantically begged him to fix it.
Standing a few feet from me was a young woman who was bent over the same table, saying “thank you, thank you, thank you,” to the man behind the counter. She was overcome with the same emotions – and she was practically reverential toward the “genius” that had revived her computer – as was I.
As dependent as I am on my computer and iPhone, I wouldn’t call myself particularly tech savvy. Many people, including myself, could not fix a computer to save their lives.
It is as though we have become slaves to our own technology.
It is just as Jaron Lanier writes in his book “You Are Not a Gadget: A Manifesto”. “A new generation has come of age with a reduced expectation of what a person can be…”
In the book, Lanier argues that computers are not our superiors but rather extensions of ourselves – products meant to push us to our fullest potential, to catapult us into the future.
That is why I fear people give too much credence to technology. Our iPhones and laptops may do a lot of fancy tricks but they are ultimately limited to what we program them to do.
In the future, we can expect computers and technology to play even greater roles in our lives. It might sound like a joke today, but maybe in 10 years, robots will become standard items in every home.
Still, no matter how lifelike technology may seem, we can’t forget that it is only as good as its best programmer.
So the next time my computer crashes in Gelman, I will stop, breathe and remember that the machine is not a representation of my own abilities but rather a device with a few kinks that still need to be worked out.
Until then, I’ll remember to back up my hard drive.

Is it possible to make time stand still? Maybe if I stare at my watch with enough intensity I can slow the inevitable ticking of its hands?
With the conclusion of my junior year quickly approaching, I only wish I had this power.
In one moment you are a freshman who has a seemingly endless collegiate journey ahead of you. But then, all of a sudden, you are about to be a senior who is scrambling to make sense of the little time you have left.
It has become more and more apparent that I need to set a list of goals to accomplish before I graduate. I have looked back on my college career and have identified the mistakes I made in my first three years.
My “GW bucket list” might not completely remedy my past errors or oversights, but it will allow me to make the most of my final year.
Looking back, I realize I was too quick to dismiss the thought of traveling abroad during the school year or summer. I did this because, frankly, I was comfortable on campus and did not want to even begin thinking about leaving. While the lessons I have learned from school and work throughout the past three years are priceless, I have no doubt that I need to supplement these with experiences that force me to expand the scope of my worldview.
So, at some point in this next year, I hope to leave my family and friends behind for a few days or weeks, perhaps by signing up for an Alternative Breaks trip, or by summoning my inner Jack Kerouac and driving until I reach some unrecognizable place. Grandma, this is nothing personal – I promise that I will return.
This semester, I battled with difficult ideas and concepts in my philosophy course that often required longs hours of poring over the assigned reading. But when I sat down to write a midterm paper for it, I didn’t resent the course. In fact, I wished I had taken more courses like it. The feeling of wrestling with dense and difficult texts provided me with a rewarding sense of accomplishment, and I began to regret all of the times I picked courses purely based on their Rate My Professor low difficulty rankings.
That’s why next semester, I’m going to pick some courses that might actually hurt my GPA.
While doing poorly on a tough paper about John Locke might be a sobering experience, being able to walk into office hours and ask an expert on the subject how to improve is a gratifying experience.
Sometimes it is easy to forget that D.C. has much more to offer in terms of employment than just K Street and Capitol Hill. So my final goal is to work somewhere that doesn’t have “LLC,” or “institute,” in its title.
The beauty of college is that it is a sort of real world laboratory, a time for exploration and adventure that is not really afforded at any other point in one’s life.
Hopefully I will be able to use the waning time in college to create meaningful experiments.

Show future Colonials your passion for GW
We are writing in response to the column, “Rush season for admissions,” (March 22, p. 4).
There is something magical about April Visit Days. Getting admitted seniors to choose GW is by far the most gratifying experience for anybody in admissions.
As students who have participated in various admissions-related functions, we’ve seen the Office of Admissions bring in the next generation of Colonials. Whether it’s allowing prospective students to further explore the University, or spending extra time with families who have a zillion questions, student admissions representatives are the face of GW.
Sure, our knowledge of certain facts and figures might help, but participating in these events is not about overwhelming prospective families with trivial statistics. The point is to highlight our personal stories as part of the larger GW experience.
Students involved in the admissions office are eager to provide their perspectives, and are the most passionate about this University. They want to share their excitement with prospective students to get them just as enthusiastic about their futures on the Foggy Bottom and Mount Vernon campuses as we are.
These programs are anything but exclusive. The countless tour guides, admissions assistants, senior interviewers, summer tour guides and bloggers represent GW academically, socially and geographically. With the right mix of excitement for GW and interpersonal skills, any undergraduate student can become involved in the admissions process.
Students who do not want to be affiliated with the office can still participate by interacting with prospective students when they come to campus. In fact, we love it when our friends call us out while we’re giving tours.
For those of you not associated with admissions, we encourage you to engage with prospective students and tell them about your favorite part of GW.
Instead of criticizing what the admissions office does or does not do, try to become involved with the process and show future GW students your passion for this University.
Throughout April Visit Days, we encourage everybody on campus – not just the loud tour guides donning yellow shirts – to participate.
Find your own way to join in on the fun and express your excitement for the Hippo.
Sam Bernstein and Michelle Liu are student admissions representatives.

The hallmark student issue of this year has been student space.
The issue started with the closing of the Fishbowl in September and has continued to plague Colonials as they cram themselves into Columbian Square and overheat in the Gelman stacks.
The Marvin Center Governing Board and the Student Association have been calling for a space for students throughout the year. First they started with a grandiose plan to have a student space on the fifth floor of the Marvin Center. When it was determined that the fifth floor would become office space, students lobbied for $1 million to renovate the fourth floor. Now, the current plan asks for a quarter of the original sum to make smaller changes to the fourth floor.
But moving forward with the current renovations would compromise the ability to create a lasting plan beneficial to all students.
What the University needs to fund is a long term approach, allowing for the administration and student leaders to craft a solution that will ultimately be best for everyone involved.
It is unrealistic to suggest that the University should provide immediate funding for the fourth floor due to the current construction on the fifth floor. But a long-term solution would be a viable and realistic method to provide the necessary funding for fourth floor renovations.
This would allow the University to budget a multi-year process that would ease the pressure on the administration to find a quick financial solution.
Students should be excited that the University will be able to vacate the Center for Student Engagement offices in order to provide an additional area for the community. The administration must recognize that students need to have the ability to make long-term changes to have the fourth floor best suit their needs.
And that is where the funding comes in.
Creating a long-term solution would also allow student leaders to create a more comprehensive plan that would involve a wide-range of organizations and students, establishing a future for the fourth-floor that would best represent the needs of the entire student body.
The student body is often scattered across campus, gathering at the bustling Starbucks or the uninviting Ivory Tower basement. None of these places can act as a go-to, singular student union.
How can students feel like true Colonials when they have no centralized space to gather?
That’s why the future of the Marvin Center fourth floor is so critical.

Relating to a discovery of sexuality wasn’t a stretch for the cast of “Spring Awakening.”
Members of Forbidden Planet Productions felt the lascivious nature of their songs and script was easy to connect with, because, while the over 100-year-old lines have aged, the content still relates to adolescent struggles today.
While teen problems have remained the same for the past 100 years, the play’s characters’ means of communication slightly differ. Instead of secretly texting their frustrations, the characters set their problems to music.
“These characters build to such a heightened emotional state, that all they can do is sing,” the play’s director Jordan King said.
In the song “The Bitch of Living,” lead characters Melchior and Moritz, played by freshman Chris Licata and sophomore Jordan Morrisey, respectively, bang their chairs angrily alongside their equally exasperated classmates, belting out the disgruntled teens’ inner frustrations.
“God, I dreamed there was an angel / Who could hear me through the wall / As I cried out, like in Latin / ‘This is so not life at all!’ ” Moritz sings.
Admitting that initially he was not enamored with the musical, King said that the fact he was able to relate to the nature of “Spring Awakening” drew him into appreciating the story’s message and sparked his interest in its production.
“I think once you start to understand how beautiful the lyrics are and the way Duncan Sheik crafted the songs to really form interior monologues, you stop looking at them as concerty, angsty teenager songs but actually as expression,” King said.
The play focuses on young teenagers growing up in turn-of-the-nineteenth century Germany. They are struggling to piece together the puzzle of their own sexuality and the changes they embark on while growing up – confusion with which nearly any generation of adolescents can commiserate.
“We’ve all felt that – where we’re just sitting in class, and you just want to yell about how frustrated you are,” Morrisey said.
The script was originally written as a play by Frank Wedekind in 1892 and adapted as an alternative-rock musical by Sheik and Steven Sater, first premiering off-Broadway in 2006 and winning the 2007 Tony award winner for Best Musical. 
With provocative scenes, focusing on both polarizing themes of sex and suicide, “Spring Awakening” examines both the dark and beautiful experiences that form the framework for adulthood.
“I think every kid goes through a time where you’re searching for something. Whether it’s sexual or personal trials, problems at home,” King said. “How you get through it, or not, really hasn’t changed in a 100 years.”
While sex plays a huge role, so does a battle with depression and suicide, as Moritz ultimately cannot accept the pains of growing up, taking his own life.
“I kind of had to isolate myself a little bit after certain scenes. If I was the character, if I was Moritz I wouldn’t speak to anyone after certain things happened. You just have to keep that whole mindset going to connect the scenes,” Morrisey said.
Junior Kaiya Lyons said the sexual nature of the show was sometimes a challenge for the crew to get through without a little laughter.
“There are lots of innuendos that happen during rehearsal, but you have to be able to get out all the giggles and just get to the real heart of the show, which is these kids,” Lyons, the artistic and musical director for the show, said.
At the end of Act I, the significant turning point in the musical, Melchior and lead female character Wendla, played by freshman Nina Lupan, comfort one another in a hayloft during a storm. In a vulnerable moment, the two reach a culminating point in their relationship, making love in the secluded barn.
“There is always this double standard, you know people can do Shakespeare and can kill 10 people on stage, but its really hard to talk or show nudity, or anything with a sexual spin to it,” King said.
“Spring Awakening” opens April 12 at 8 p.m. in West Hall Theater and will also run on April 13 and 14 and 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. Tickets are $5, payable by cash or GWorld.

Head coach Scott Reed knows his team is driven.
After a spring season where the team went 9-12, Reed said his squad gained the ability to absorb the lessons from losses, reflect on mistakes and strengthen its approach for the next match.
It’s an important attribute for any team seeking to make a postseason run, and one Reed said will serve the Colonials well as they prepare to open CWPA Southern Division Championship play Saturday in Lewisburg, Pa.
“Their minds are sponges,” Reed said. “They don’t take losses well, [they] make necessary corrections and move on from there.”
What could make the difference for the Colonials in the postseason play is the team’s chemistry, drawn from its unique roster. GW suits up 10 underclassmen, a young squad by any 
measure. But the team’s age has kept one particular player from grabbing the spotlight: senior attack Monica Hanson said.
“I think in years past, we’ve had one star [player] that’s been our main offense or that’s been our main defense,” Hanson said. “And this time, we have such a great up-and-coming team that everyone is really able to contribute.”
The team’s level playing field shows in Reed’s rotation throughout the season. All but two players registered minutes in at least 20 of the 21 contests, and four Colonials recorded 30 or more goals.
Three of those contests were against nationally-ranked opponents Iona College, Princeton and Michigan. Though GW dropped all three of those games, Reed said the improved competition was an “eye-opener” for his team, a belief echoed by senior center Megan Walker.
“I think you become the best by playing the best. You never really know how far you can push yourself until you are forced to push yourself,” Walker said. “So, I look forward to playing ranked teams like Michigan and Princeton. I think it makes us better.”
The Colonials open postseason play this weekend as the No. 5 seed, taking on No. 1 Princeton in the first game Saturday. Rounding out GW’s bracket in the Southern championship is No. 4 seeded Bucknell, which the Colonials will face in their second contest Saturday afternoon. Sunday’s play, the second day of the tournament, will be determined by the previous day’s results.
Last season, GW fell to Bucknell 10-8 at the CWPA Eastern Championship to finish the year in eighth place. The Colonials wrapped the 2011 season with a 7-20 overall record.
GW has a chance to avenge last season’s loss to the Bison Saturday when it returns to postseason play. Key for the young team over its challenging first round, Hanson said, will be keeping a high level of energy throughout play.
“Some people have trouble not burning out and keeping the enthusiasm for it going [which] is going to be a major goal of ours,” she said.
Hanson and Walker, in their final seasons with the program, believe that intensity can push GW to postseason success. The Colonials have just one goal in mind each time they take to the pool.
“I think, at this point in the season, we are not just training to train. We are training to win,” Walker said.

At the end of her freshman year on the women’s lacrosse team, Sarah Phillips boasted an impressive list of accomplishments.
She was the A-10 Rookie of the Year, finished second on the Colonials, tied for seventh in the league with 18 assists, achieved the third-most points for a freshman in program history and was named to the A-10 All-Rookie Team.
In the three years that followed, Phillips made a name for herself as a player who’s continually able to see an opening on the field, dodging her way around opponents to find a clear shot at the net. The senior’s offensive spark is one of the Colonials’ most dangerous weapons, head coach Tara Hannaford said. Her energy is a burst of firepower that propels Phillips to tally goals and set up her teammates for scores of their own.
“Teams are surprised by her. We wanted the ball in her hands,” Hannaford said. “Our goal was to get her the ball, and she wants the ball. She is much more composed and confident. Her assists are incredible.”
It’s a style of play that proved successful. As Phillips rounds out her senior season, she holds the title for GW’s career assist leader, scored her 100th goal April 1 and tied for the second-most goals scored in a game in program history during a match against Richmond April 6.
But she said her most intense focus isn’t on on her personal accomplishments, but rather on setting up her teammates. Even though Phillips was aware she was closing in on 100 goals, there was another statistic to which the senior paid more attention.
“I think, personally, I would rather have assists than goals,” Phillips said. “I mean, there’s kind of a countdown on all of the articles, so I knew it was coming.”
Hannaford said Phillips will be remembered as a Colonial who played with confidence on the field. It is a presence that is was evident from Phillips’ freshman accolades and the measured calm with which she now takes to the game.
“We definitely had adversity on the team with injuries. Sarah came along at the end of the year. She had become confident,” Hannaford said. “She gets the job done.”
The senior’s confidence comes through in her play as she weaves down the field in a beeline to the net. Not much about her style of play has changed since she first donned a Colonials uniform, but Phillips said she’s become more vocal in her motivation for the rest of GW’s roster.
“I’m more of a leader on the field now than I was when I was a freshman,” Phillips said.
This season is bittersweet for Phillips – one where she’ll see her career in GW garb come to an end.
The end of this season spells change for Hannaford, too, as she prepares to graduate five seniors from her squad. And while the head coach can prepare to fill the inevitable roster openings, she said it would be tough to find a substitute for Phillips.
“A player like Sarah Phillips might not come around again,” Hannaford said.
