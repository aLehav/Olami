Student Association President Arielle Geismar holds a sign in Kogan Plaza during a protest last month against the University's decision to arm some GW Police Department officers next fall. 
Student Association President Arielle Geismar said she spoke with officials last week to amplify students’ disapproval of the University’s decision to arm some GW Police Department officers next fall during an SA Senate meeting Monday.
Geismar said she and SA Vice President Demetrius Apostolis met with GWPD Chief James Tate and Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students Colette Coleman last Thursday to echo “student concerns” about arming about 20 GWPD officers next fall during her presidential report. She said she is working with officials to mitigate the decision and hopes the University withdraws their choice but that she doesn’t know if it will be possible for students to reverse the plan.
Geismar added that she reiterated students’ objections to the decision during a meeting with the Board of Trustees Academic Affairs Committee last Friday and will raise student’s opposition again in the Board’s upcoming meeting May 19.
“I’m pushing into the lens of students don’t want this, and I’m having those conversations,” Geismar said. “This past week was my first week in office, so I’ve had the power to do that and had the opportunity to have those conversations.”
Apostolis said the meeting with Tate and Coleman last week provided “clarity” about why officials are planning to arm officers but that he won’t provide further details from the meeting because he didn’t know what information he could “get out” yet. He added that he and Geismar spoke with student organizations like the Public Health Student Association and that the research cited in public health students’ letter against the arming decision addressed to officials last week — which finds that armed guards in schools are not associated with significant reductions in rates of injuries or deaths during mass shootings — was “eye-opening.”
“Our GW community wants to be involved in these issues,” Apostolis said. “This year, it’s our goal to make that possible.”
Senators also unanimously passed a resolution to increase senators’ attendance at meetings for the upcoming year.
SA Sen. Simon Patmore-Zarcone (Law-G) sponsored the Senate Attendance Reform Act, which states that any senator not physically, virtually or present by proxy — when a present senator represents an absent member in voting — for a total of three committee meetings throughout the semester will be considered eligible for suspension. The bill states that senators may be present by proxy for six senate meetings but will be considered absent after their sixth absence.
Patmore-Zarcone said reaching quorum in the Financial Services and Allocations Committee was “difficult” last term because of senators’ absences, and the bill will hold senators accountable for the time commitment they pledged to the body. He said the senate “functions well” when senators remain engaged in their work and dedicate the appropriate amount of time to their goals.
“People who do not show up to meetings do not contribute,” Patmore-Zarcone said. “They don’t share in the work of that committee and they take a seat away from someone who might really want to do work.”
Apostolis said he reserves the right to approve absences for medical and mental health leaves, academic commitments and religious exemptions as presiding officer of the senate. SA bylaws state that the Governance and Nominations Committee will hold a hearing to consider next steps for senators considered eligible for suspension.
Senators also approved a new senate chairperson pro-tempore and nine senators as committee chairs.
Senators confirmed SA Sen. Amy Cowley (ESIA-G) as the senate chairperson pro tempore in a 17-10 vote against SA Sen. Ethan Fitzgerald (CCAS-U). Cowley said she will help draft legislation and connect senators with members of administration to help senators achieve their goals and that she plans to create a system that ensures students who fill senate vacancies during the term complete “necessary” training because they lack the preparations Apostolis provided to incoming senators after SA elections in April.
“I want to create and implement a robust training system so that new senators do not have to try and figure it out on their own, which as someone who filled the senate vacancy last year, I can attest to being extremely difficult,” Cowley said.
Senators unanimously confirmed SA Sen. Ethan Lynne (CCAS-U) as chair of the Financial Services and Allocations Committee. Lynne said he will use his prior experience as the former senate committee clerk and the president of Thurston Hall’s Residence Hall Association Hall Council this past year to be a “fair” and “effective” finance chair.
Senators unanimously confirmed SA Sen. Andrew An (ESIA-U) as chair of the Physical Facilities and Urban Affairs Committee. An said his “extensive knowledge” of University facilities systems like FixIt, the system students and staff use to request facilities repairs, and AIM, the back-end system used to assign facilities requests on campus, qualifies him to address issues like the “contractor loophole,” where officials grant unauthorized contractors access to residence halls.

Senators unanimously confirmed SA Sen. Dan Saleem (CCAS-U) as chair of the Sub-Committee on Sustainability. Saleem said he believes the University should divest from fossil fuels but that the SA needs to be “practical” and not damage GW’s finances from divestment. He said he plans to continue communication with the Office of Sustainability by using information and context that the former sustainability chair, Brita Ostermeier (CCAS-G), provided him.
Senators also unanimously confirmed SA Sen. Jonesy Strell (CCAS-U) as chair of the Community, Advocacy, and Inclusion Committee. Strell said as a student with hearing loss, he feels the SA has done little to support him and other minority students who have faced discrimination and “assault” regarding their student rights. He said he is dedicated to helping every member on the committee further their advocacy work as chair.
Senators confirmed SA. Sen Emmy Ly (SOB-U) as the undergraduate chair of the Student Life Committee in a 15-10 vote against SA. Sen Ethan Fitzgerald (CCAS-U). Ly said she has found it difficult to be involved in student life on campus because she is a commuter student, and will advocate for commuter students to gaining tap access to dining halls and residential buildings and expanding the commuter student lounge on the fourth floor of the University Student Center.
Senators unanimously approved SA Sen. Noor Khalil (SMHS-G) as graduate chair of the Student Life Committee. Khalil said he ran for the chair position because he enjoyed being on the committee last term and that he will work to make graduate students feel less disconnected from student life.
Senators unanimously approved Anika Gupta (SOB-U) as undergraduate chair of the Education Policy Committee. Gupta said she will work to ensure that all professors record their lectures because she relies on rewatching lessons to write down notes as a student with ADHD. She added she plans on fixing campus printers because she finds they often do not work.
Senators unanimously confirmed Adriana Sandoval (CPS-G) as the graduate chair of the Education Policy Committee. Sandoval said she plans on creating systems to help graduate students find jobs and develop professional skills.
Senators unanimously approved Eli Bak as the senate’s chief counselor, Henry Mills as the senate’s deputy counselor, Jacob Schwartz as senate secretary and Katelyn Moon as communications director. Senators also unanimously approved Maya Renteria as the junior director of the Legislative Budget Office and Conner Linggi and Alexander Wilson as the office’s assistants.

The Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights will investigate a Palestinian rights organization's complaint on behalf of three students. 
The Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights opened an investigation Wednesday into a Palestinian rights organization complaint, alleging GW discriminated against Palestinian students.
Palestine Legal — which filed a complaint on behalf of three students with the OCR in February — alleges GW denied access to mental health services for Palestinian students or students perceived to be Palestinian, falsely accused them of committing crimes and held “months-long” disciplinary processes for crimes that other students admitted they committed. Palestine Legal also alleges campus police disproportionately investigated the students and that they were subjected to “racist anti-Palestinian” comments that violate Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
A Palestine Legal release states it is the OCR’s first public investigation into anti-Palestinian racism.
“This is an important step that shows OCR is taking anti-Palestinian discrimination seriously,” Palestine Legal senior staff attorney Radhika Sainath states in the release. “Even if pro-Israel groups don’t like it and complain, the law is clear – Palestinian students are entitled to the same educational opportunities and services as other students.”
University spokesperson Julia Metjian said officials are “in receipt of the request for information” from the Department of Education and will respond to the inquiry. Metjian declined to say when the OCR notified the University of their investigation, if officials have communicated with the OCR about the investigation, what the University’s response is to the investigation or how the University will work with the OCR as they conduct the investigation.
The OCR did not immediately return a request for comment.
The complaint lists several instances where the University allegedly discriminated against Palestinian students and students perceived to be Palestinian, including the reported cancellation of mental health services for Palestinian students provided through the Office of Advocacy and Support during a period of heightened violence in Palestine in spring 2021, according to the release. 
The release also states that officials falsely accused Students for Justice in Palestine and its president of vandalism for wheat pasting posters — a process of hanging posters with a mixture of starch and water — on property outside the GW Hillel building during an event featuring a former Israeli Defense Forces intelligence commander in October. Officials cleared both SJP and its president of disciplinary charges for the vandalism in January and members from Jewish Voice for Peace claimed responsibility. 
The complaint alleges students made anti-Palestinian statements after Lara Sheehi, an assistant professor of clinical psychology, invited a Palestinian Hebrew University professor to speak at an Professional Psychology Program event in September, the release states. The OCR opened an investigation into allegations of antisemitism in Sheehi’s course last month, just two weeks after a GW-hired law firm announced it found “no evidence” of discrimination in the class.
“GW has failed to take any action to support Palestinians and others in its community affected by these racist comments,” the release states.
Danya Zituni, the communications manager for Palestine Legal, said the complaint aims to ensure the University complies with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and that officials reopen mental health services for Palestinian community members and reject a “politicized” definition of antisemitism that would “censure” Palestinian rights advocates.
“It’s unlawful to deny services and the same opportunities to Palestinian students that are given to other students, so I think this is a really, really important and major development that we’re really happy with,” Zituni said. 
Zituni said the investigation is a “major” development for Palestinian student rights and speaks to a “larger systematic issue at play.” She said she hopes the investigation will send a “clear message” to other universities that it is unlawful to deny services to Palestinian students.
“We see this as a really important step forward for fighting this systematic issue of censorship and punishment of Palestine advocacy across campuses,” Zituni said.

The letter states that Milken Institute of Public Health students believe officials should adopt an “equity-centered” and “evidence-based” approach in addressing gun violence to preserve the public health of the GW community.
More than 450 Milken Institute of Public Health students, faculty and community members signed a letter last week advocating against the Board of Trustees’ decision to arm about 20 GW Police Department officers in the fall.
The letter — dated May 4 and addressed to interim University President Mark Wrighton, incoming University President Ellen Granberg, GWPD Chief James Tate, Board of Trustees Chair Grace Speights and Board members — states that Milken community members believe the Board overlooked “relevant data” and “nuances” of gun violence and requests officials join a community forum to answer questions about the decision’s reasoning. The letter, signed by 410 students, 42 faculty and staff and 13 affiliates, including alumni, parents and local citizens, states that Milken community members know the Board’s decision will negatively impact the health, safety and well-being of the GW community.
The letter states that Milken students believe officials should meet gun violence with an “equity-centered” and “evidence-based” approach to preserve the public health of the GW community. Milken students have learned alternative approaches to combatting gun violence that avoid arming campus police as members of a “top” public health school, according to the letter.
“As students trained to make evidence-based policy decisions, we feel compelled to direct your attention to the myriad data on the adverse effects of armed police in community environments,” the letter states.
Wrighton’s announcement of the decision last month states that officials will arm GWPD officers ranking sergeant or higher with 9 mm handguns, who will be able to immediately respond to developing emergencies instead of deferring response to armed officers in other departments. Wrighton said officials made the decision after more than a year of “careful consideration” in a response to heightened gun violence in educational settings.
Milken community members’ letter states that GW already has an “immense presence” of armed police, like Metropolitan Police Department officers and Secret Service agents on and around campus. The letter states that increasing the presence of firearms in all settings results in a higher likelihood of fatal violence, and that armed guards in school settings are not associated with a decrease in injury or death during mass shootings, according to research reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The letter lists questions about how officials made the arming decision following their request for a public forum like other options the Board considered, the public safety data officials used and how the University will mitigate the risk of police gun violence against community members.
The letter also asks officials to provide more information on the review board of armed officers they plan to institute and questions why officials compared GW to “market-basket” schools in their decision-making process instead of schools on “integrated urban” campuses.
“As a renowned institution of higher education, you also also have an obligation to use high-quality data and evidence – as well as to consider the will of the members of the community – when making a decision as weighty and consequential as arming our campus police officers,” the letter states.
University spokesperson Julia Metjian said University leadership acknowledges the “important perspectives” students bring to discussions about public safety and that officials will review the PHSA’s letter and recommendations. Metjian declined to say whether officials will answer questions in a public forum, if officials reviewed data similar to the research cited in the letter and how officials factored in the number of neighboring police jurisdictions to their decision.
“As part of the university’s community engagement efforts to hear feedback on implementation planning, leadership has been meeting with faculty, staff, and students and has contacted representatives of the Public Health Student Association to discuss their letter,” Metjian said.
Milken Dean Lynn Goldman said in a Wednesday email to Milken community members that public health community members must understand the decision’s risks, like a police officer mistakenly shooting a community member, and its benefits, like protection against armed criminals. She said Milken community members should be aware that people have daily experiences where they fear encounters with police will turn deadly, which causes them to face “debilitating trauma.”
Goldman said communication between all campus community members is “essential” and that the community must listen to “valid points” regarding public health research and evidence on gun violence and arming GWPD officers. The email directs Milken community members to the GWPD website to express their opinions.
“We need to engage with our campus partners to create paths forward to provide an environment where campus life can thrive in safety and harmony without creating undue burdens of fear and stress,” Goldman said in the email.
Prabha Raghavan, a graduate student studying global health and the president of the Public Health Student Association, said the Milken community is “disappointed” because officials have not revealed the experts they consulted and the public safety data they used to inform the decision to arm officers. She said officials did not consult Milken faculty and students researching gun violence solutions, which makes her “scared” the decision may harm community members.
She said a future community forum would respond to Wrighton and Tate’s previous request for community feedback on the decision. She said the forum would ensure a “two-way” discussion between community members and officials.
“We’re inviting them to participate in a community forum because it would reduce some of the barriers that we as community members are facing in accessing or understanding the reasoning behind this solution,” Raghavan said.
Kathryn Fleisher, a graduate student studying health policy who helped write the letter, said officials should “slow down” and consider different solutions to gun violence because police violence occurs more frequently than school shootings. She said arming GWPD officers is a “poor reflection” of Milken because the decision was “regressive” and that public health students have an “obligation” to engage with decision-makers.
“This is poor institutional practice and a really disappointing way to watch my institution handle such a pressing and weighty matter,” Fleisher said.

Melanie Rocha, pictured left, said she and Jenna Ahart, right, led the painting sessions for the 52-foot mural.
Officials from the Office of Student Life drew back black curtains to reveal a mural on the fourth floor of the University Student Center last week, complete with a cherry blossom centerpiece, a glistening gold George Washington statue on a bench and various D.C. and GW landmarks, like the Kogan Plaza tempietto, amidst a swirl of pink and orange dotted clouds.
Last Friday’s mural reception unveiled the semester-long work of Art n Soul, a newly formed student organization for creating art that officials from the Division for Student Affairs commissioned to visualize values of GW’s campus and the D.C. community, like inclusivity and collaboration. Melanie Rocha, the president and founder of the student organization, said at most five other Art n Soul members contributed to the mural but that she and sophomore Jenna Ahart, Art n Soul’s communications director, led the painting sessions to complete the 52-foot mural outside the fourth-floor elevators in the student center.
“This mural represents not only what it means to be a student at GW but also what it means to be a student in D.C. and how these experiences will carry us beyond in life,” Rocha said in her speech.

Rocha said she submitted her initial mural outline to Office of Student Life officials Jan. 31, who reviewed her plan before approving the design March 15. Rocha said organization members used a projector in the beginning of the process to outline the mural’s figures and received a total of five paint colors from the University — buff, navy blue, white, pink and light blue — which they had to mix to achieve the additional colors necessary for each design element. 
Rocha said Miles Feacher, the program associate for student involvement who oversaw the project, originally helped Art n Soul e-board members set the mural’s unveiling date for April 13 to accompany the University’s “Buff and Pink Week” festival series, but that the organization’s e-board decided to email Feacher asking to postpone the unveiling three weeks. 
Rocha said the April deadline would have caused students contributing to the mural to rush their painting process and forgo details like fonts used for the Metro poles positioned next to a Metro train and the metal on the Professor’s Gate. She said the approval process, which took longer than the six-week painting period, delayed Art n Soul members from starting the mural until late March. 
“We wanted to have the little details,” Rocha said. “We wanted to have the perfect lettering and we just weren’t going to get that if the deadline was the initial date.”
Rocha said creating Art n Soul, the University’s first active art organization, meant she formed a space where she and fellow members could showcase their artistic expression regardless of their experience level during her speech at the reception, 
“Jenna and I came to every session every day of the week, pretty much any time we weren’t doing other things, we were here,” Rocha said.
Ahart said Art n Soul members had to work in sections because the projector didn’t cast their outline on the entirety of the wall’s space and that they later realized they couldn’t fit as much of each design element as they wanted, leading members to redesign the sizing of certain portions. She said they couldn’t turn off the lights on the fourth floor, causing members to free-hand most of the mural instead of using the projector. 
“I think people really enjoy it as a result, and it’s brought a lot of color to the space because before this it was just a fluorescent white wall, it was kind of like an eye sore, but now it’s so pretty,” Ahart said.
Freshman Holland Ley, Art n Soul’s event coordinator, said he helped coordinate two-hour time slots each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday for up to 15 students to paint the mural after signing up for a slot and that members left Thursdays open as designated paint-drying days. He said he likes that community members will walk out of the fourth floor elevators and see the mural that e-board members worked on for nearly an entire semester. 
“To see how everyone wanted to volunteer and help out, and the people that came here and the friendships that we developed, it was really rewarding,” Ley said.

Students, pictured here in January 2022, line up to enter GW's former COVID-19 testing medical trailer on H Street.
Officials no longer require all GW community members to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and will “wind down” campus COVID-19 testing operations over the next few weeks, according to an email sent to the GW community Tuesday.
Interim University President Mark Wrighton, Provost Christopher Bracey and Executive Vice President Sharon Reich Paulsen said in the email that the University now recommends but does not mandate COVID-19 vaccination for community members, and GW’s COVID-19 testing and contact tracing services will end May 25 and June 1, respectively. The change in requirement is a response to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s announcement last week that the federal government will no longer declare COVID-19 a public health emergency starting Thursday, the email states.
Officials changed the requirements after a “thorough assessment” of the current state of COVID-19, according to the email. The District had a weekly COVID-19 case rate of 9.7 per 100,000 the week of April 23 to 29 — the most recent time period documented — according to DC Health data. DC Health has not classified COVID-19 transmission levels as “high” in D.C. since late January 2022, the department’s data shows.
“We are grateful to the public health and medical experts who helped guide the University through the pandemic,” the email states. “The work of many positioned us well to maintain our public health preparedness.”
The email states officials “urge” GW community members to stay up to date with the CDC’s vaccination recommendations, which are currently the primary series of monovalent mRNA vaccines, like the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccines plus a booster dose, or a single dose of the bivalent mRNA vaccine, which contains both the original and omicron coronavirus strains.
Officials first required GW community members to get vaccinated against COVID-19 in August 2021 and 90 percent of the GW community was fully vaccinated with two monovalent doses later that month. The University mandated in December 2021 that students, faculty and staff must receive a booster doses by Feb. 1, 2022 and added last week that a single bivalent dose also fulfills the University’s vaccination requirement.
The email states that wearing a mask will remain optional on campus, except in some spaces like health care facilities, where mask requirements are at the discretion of each facility’s leadership. The University dropped the classroom mask mandate in February because of the University’s high vaccination rate and low rates of infection and hospitalization from COVID-19 in D.C. and ended their asymptomatic testing requirement in July 2022.
Community members should follow CDC recommendations for testing, isolation, masking, vaccination and symptom monitoring, “especially” if they test positive for COVID-19, the email states. Students should visit the Student Health Center for their medical needs while faculty and staff should consult their physicians, according to the email.
The email states that officials will monitor COVID-19, share information on the University’s COVID-19 website and make adjustments to requirements “as needed.”

The release states that trains on the Yellow Line will begin leaving every eight minutes daily beginning in June.
The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority reopened the Yellow Line Sunday after nearly eight months of repairs.
Officials announced last month the reopening of the line, which provides a faster, “more direct” connection from the Huntington station in Virginia through Reagan National Airport to the Greenbelt station in Maryland. For the first month of operation, Yellow Line trains will operate every eight minutes on weekdays from 6 a.m. until 9 p.m. and every 12 minutes all other times, according to a Friday release.
The release states that trains will begin leaving every eight minutes daily starting in June.
“This was incredibly difficult work, with construction crews working around the clock to reconstruct the steel lined tunnel and repair the bridge,” Metro General Manager and CEO Randy Clarke said in the release. “The tunnel today is like new again and built to last for decades to come.”
Construction crews began working Sep. 10 on a $384 million project to replace expansion joints, bridge bearings, and steel plates on the line’s bridge and tunnel across the Potomac, according to the release.
The line’s current train service is a 60 percent increase from last fall’s service, according to the release.
