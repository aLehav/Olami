Twenty-five people sought medical treatment at the GW Hospital for injuries or illnesses related to inauguration festivities, according to a hospital spokesman.
The patients primarily sought treatment related to “falls, dizziness and weakness,” hospital spokesman Steven Taubenkibel said. The patients experienced no serious medical issues.
During the 2009 ceremony, the GW Hospital treated 91 patients for inauguration-related maladies. The hospital treated spectators, the most severe of whom experienced cardiac arrest and a small stroke.
Between 800,000 and 1 million spectators flocked to this year’s swearing-in ceremony, compared to a record crowd of 1.8 million in 2009.
None of the patients treated this Inauguration Day were transported by EMeRG, GW’s student-run emergency medical services.
One student was transported to a nearby hospital for intoxication during GW’s Inaugural Ball Monday night.
The hospital’s emergency room treated a total of 185 people on Monday.

University President Steven Knapp has made environmental issues a priority. And as a result of his efforts, the University was ranked No. 27 in Sierra Magazine’s “Coolest Schools,” sustainability list in 2012, a sharp improvement from 2009, when GW was ranked No. 81.
In the long run, GW is hoping to to cut carbon emissions 40 percent by 2040.
But GW has hit some roadblocks in its stride for environmental stability.
The eco-challenge, a campus-wide competition that measures how much water and electricity residence halls consume throughout the year, has failed to reduce consumption of either.
Nineteen of the 30 halls that took part in this year’s competition actually used more energy than the year before.
In the past semester, 13 residence halls increased their water usage. City Hall increased its water use by 100 percent and Philip Amsterdam Hall’s increased by more than 150 percent.
A residence hall only needs one person to commit to entering the building in the challenge. But many students do not even know what the eco-challenge is.
Sending students a few emails about the eco-challenge is not enough to encourage participation. And even if they do know about the challenge, it’s clear that they don’t care.
GW needs to better incentivize the eco-challenge to attract active participants. Due to the sheer size of the University and the overall lack of spirit on campus, pitting residence halls against one another produces dismal results.
One way to make the competition more effective is to make it smaller. Instead of a campus-wide challenge, each individual residence hall could have an internal competition. Halls could then set a goal each semester for water and energy usage.
Other schools have similar eco-challenges, but they are organized differently to draw more participation. For example, in addition to their school-wide competition, Indiana University at Bloomington established a floor-by-floor challenge in which the students who live in the most sustainable room win a prize. This is a system GW should look to adopt.
Students who live on campus pay flat rates for their housing. This means they don’t receive an electric bill every month, and they don’t pay more when they use excessive amounts of water and electricity. As a result, students are unaware of how much they are consuming – and the University should work harder to educate them in this regard.
House proctors could also get involved by encouraging students to conserve and could also post regular updates on energy and water consumption in building lobbies to make students aware of their status and progress.
Of course, responsibility does not exclusively lie with the administration. As students, it should be our priority to focus on using only as much water and electricity as needed. Excessive energy and water use is harmful to the environment, and we must take it upon ourselves to be more conscious about the adverse effects of our actions, eco-challenge or not.
In President Barack Obama’s second inaugural address Monday, he outlined the importance of going green.
“The path towards sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult,” he said. “But America cannot resist this transition. We must lead it.”
Obama is right: Going green is not an easy task, and students are clearly resisting GW’s effort. But the onus is on both administrators and students.

As offers to partner with Latin American colleges pour in, GW’s study abroad office has targeted the booming region as its next area of growth.
Director of Study Abroad Rob Hallworth said GW will look to add more programs in countries like Brazil, – which boasts the world’s third-largest economy – as the country attempts to bolster the talent pool of its future workforce.
GW launched its first exchange program in the country this fall, sending one student to Rio De Janeiro and welcoming its first Brazilian student to GW. An additional 50 students have studied abroad in Brazil in the last four years through other programs.
The University is spreading its reach across the continent. It launched an international business program in Buenos Aires, Argentina, this fall, drawing about a dozen students. In the last four years, about 200 undergraduates have studied abroad in Argentina.
Study abroad adviser Lauren Beilin said GW’s Chile program, which drew eight students last fall, is less popular.
“Latin America is an attractive study abroad location for students willing to go further outside of their comfort zone,” Beilin said. “There are more opportunities in Latin America for students to immerse themselves in the local culture, since these programs tend to emphasize the importance of breaking out of the American bubble.”
Beilin added that most students who study abroad in Latin America live with host families, instead of dorms or apartments, which allows them to “engage on a deeper level with the local culture.”
The expansion comes as GW plans to pump between $5 and $15 million over the next decade into its study abroad program, according to the strategic plan draft released in October.
The increase in Brazilian exchanges, Hallworth said, stems from a measure passed by its government that handed out 75,000 scholarships for students to study abroad. Similar programs in Chile and El Salvador are slated to pass in the next several years.
“The Brazilian government made a large investment in trying to get kids into STEM fields,” Hallworth said.
Study abroad adviser Anna Levinger added that she pushes students to choose destinations outside of their comfort zones, which tend to include Western European countries.
“We certainly want to see students going to non-traditional places,” Levinger said.
Chronicle for Higher Education reporter Karin Fischer, who covers foreign education issues, compared Brazil to China five or 10 years ago because of its growing economic and global importance.
“Slowly, students are looking more and more at countries that seem like they have a growing importance in the world,” Fischer said.
She added that fallout from the 2008 financial downturn has prompted students to look closer at Latin American programs.
“When the economy is a little tighter, students and families take a closer look at Latin America,” Fischer said. “The countries are Spanish speaking [and] close to America, but cheaper than Spain.”
Nationally, about 15 percent of all undergraduate students who study abroad go to a Latin American country, according to a 2012 report compiled by the Institute of International Education.
Students have long traveled to the region through other companies, like IES Abroad. Senior Emily Russel spent time in Argentina with IES Abroad last spring semester. She lived with a widowed 70-year old, learning Spanish by spending time together and sharing meals every night.
“I wanted to learn Spanish, but I wanted to go somewhere new,” Russel said.
But she was disappointed that she was constantly surrounded by American students in her program. She said she opted to take an art course at a local university to meet more locals.

Family history is typically passed down through stories and photographs. But for sophomore Sierra O’Mara Schwartz, it’s broadcast in movie theaters across the world.
O’Mara Schwartz, a psychology major from Cambridge, Mass. is the granddaughter of police sergeant John “Jack” O’Mara who is the main character in the action film “Gangster Squad.” She found herself at the center of a mini-media blitz when she published a blog post that went viral on Reddit last week.
“Gangster Squad,” released Jan. 11 claims to be a true-life tale of a secret police force tasked with quashing the mob king who controlled late 1940s Los Angeles. Josh Brolin depicts O’Mara Schwartz’s grandfather.
“I wanted everyone to know what an absolutely incredible man my grandfather was. I don’t want the media to portray him as anything else,” O’Mara Schwartz, a former Hatchet photographer, said. “He deserved to be remembered as a cool guy and not as a gun-crazy man.”
O’Mara Schwartz said she was initially thrilled to see her grandfather’s life on the big screen. In November she uploaded a film still to Facebook that depicts the four main characters – including O’Mara – walking from a blaze of fire. She captioned the photo: “Cool grandparents don’t look at explosions.”
But after a trailer for the film that featured a movie theater shootout was hastily pulled following July’s shooting in Aurora, Colo., O’Mara Schwartz got nervous.
What stuck with her most was what seemed like an extremely embellished representation of violence that turned her beloved grandfather a villain. O’Mara Schwartz said she felt compelled to speak up about the man who her mother said only shot a gun once in his long career with the Los Angeles Police Department.
“That’s when I started realizing how violent the movie was going to be and how unlike my grandfather’s real life it was going to be,” she said. “[That scene] made me feel very embarrassed for my grandfather [along with his colleagues] to be associated with such a heinous crime. It was a mess, and I think it said something about the movie.”
She said the film was hard to watch and took to her personal blog to write a post discussing how the real O’Mara did not rely on violence to crack the case. Nine days later, she posted it on Reddit.com.
“I am the granddaughter of the main character in the movie Gangster Squad, John O’Mara. The movie butchered my grandfather’s life,” she wrote. “This is my story.”
O’Mara Schwartz uploaded a link to her blog, not expecting that when she awoke, it would have 200,000 views. Her inbox was flooded with responses and requests for more.
She said she is using her “tiny amount of mini-influence” to publish a timely anti-gun violence message.
“My main message is that I think it’s a big shame that [the producers] took such an interesting story about so many people that were brilliant and honorable cops who used their brains, ideas and strategies for good and instead thought that it was more appropriate to picture them as these violent, aggressive people,” she said.
Her mother, Martha O’Mara, said the film’s violence was falsified, with gore added to up buzz and ticket sales.
“In real life, my dad was warm and funny,” she said. “He always laughed when he told his stories. He didn’t kill and maim people, but he did scare them out of town.”
Her mother agreed that the film created a forum to discuss gun violence in films like the one about her father, adding that in his case, the cops outsmarted – not outgunned – the bad guys.
The film’s release came one month after the Sandy Hook shooting in Newtown, Conn.
O’Mara Schwartz said she penned the blog post on a plane ride to Los Angeles, not knowing how it would skyrocket her to Internet fame.
“I couldn’t let the situation pass without making a statement,” she said.

Follow these simple recipes to add just the right amount of flavor to any celebration.
While I have a healthy obsession with spinach and cheese, palak paneer tends to be a dish that often looks better on the menu than it tastes on most restaurants’ plates. I found myself sloshing through the murky and over-pureed sauce to pick out the few cubes of paneer cheese oh so generously bestowed by the chef.  I fixed these problems at home and found a way to make a palak paneer with a vibrant green sauce that still says “spinach.” The amped up flavor will excite your palate. And most of all, you won’t be searching for the cheese… well, at least not until you’ve finished it all.
Ingredients
Directions
In a medium-sized pot over medium-high heat, sauté the onion in enough butter to coat the bottom of the pot and a drizzle of olive oil. Add a sizeable pinch of salt and cook until the onions are translucent.
Add the garlic, the garam masala, a shake or two of cinnamon and the ginger paste. Continue to cook while you make the spinach.
Heat a large sauté pan on high and coat with some water. Add the spinach and salt to taste. Cook down until the spinach is soft yet still bright green. In a blender or food processor, purée half the spinach from your pot. Add the purée to the onions.
Incorporate the goat cheese spread/yogurt (optional) and the cream until you are happy with the consistency and richness. It should be thick but not too chunky. Cook with paneer and salt to taste.
This popular Indian non-alcoholic beverage — wait, hold up. Something is wrong here because the mango lassi is perfect as a cocktail. Rich yogurt can soften the sharpness of liquor while mango provides natural sweetness. A clean-flavored liquor like vodka is ideal.
Ingredients (serves two)
Directions
Pureé in a blender until smooth and slightly frothy. Serve with a mango garnish.

Wednesday night, the Colonials learned just how frustrating a win can be.
A frustrating win is one with 19 ties and 20 lead changes. It’s one with nearly identical field goal percentages, turnovers and assists. It’s one where a team just clears the 50 percent benchmark in its free throw shooting.
As GW walked off the court with its narrow 66-65 victory, completing a New England sweep for the season, the team had learned that a win can often be as maddening as a loss. But the end result feels a lot sweeter.
“That was a little uneasy. We felt like we should have won by  a lot more. They were at home, so that was a big thing for them, but I’m glad we stuck this one out,” freshman forward Joe McDonald said. “It feels good, because now we’re starting to win the close games and make the plays when we need it.”
Still, McDonald acknowledged with a laugh, the team expects to hear about its free-throw shooting from head coach Mike Lonergan. The freshman added that he knows it’ll be a part of their next practice.
GW (9-9, 3-2 A-10) went 12-for-24 from the charity stripe, including 5-for-12 in the second half alone. Had it sunk those free chances, the final margin of victory could have been a lot more comfortable.
“We left six straight points at the foul line in a close game, so that was kind of disappointing,” Lonergan said. “To be 5-for-12 in the second half, that was tough. That was how [Rhode Island] got back into the game.”
Presented with a shifting Rhode Island offense that relied heavily on pick-and-rolls, GW struggled to implement a consistent defensive approach in the first. It switched from a man-to-man into a zone, only to get attacked from beyond the perimeter.
The Rams stayed with the Colonials nearly every step of the way in the first: draining matching threes, nabbing identical steals, and taking trips to the line in pairs. The duality reflected in many categories of the stat sheet. The two teams shot almost the same in the first: 45.8 for GW, 45.5 for the Rams. And each struggled from the line, though the Colonials were worse off, making just seven of 12 chances.
“They get their guys to play hard, and they were all over Joe,” Lonergan said. “It’s just hard to get us in an offense because they were harassing him so much. But I thought he did a great job keeping his composure.”
The similarity between the two teams would remain over the rest of play. They would volley between silky treys and sloppy turnovers, between crushing defense and passes into the wrong hands.
GW shot 51 percent for the game, while the Rams tallied a field goal percentage of 50 percent. It was a tight contest, and the Colonials clung on with slightly better plan in the paint and on the glass. They nabbed a 34-25 rebounding advantage, and outscored Rhode Island in the paint 32-20.
“We definitely did a great job rebounding,” Lonergan said. “We got to the line – we just didn’t take advantage of it.”
But the Rams clung on, taking advantage of GW scoring slumps to go on runs of their own. With the Colonials unable to take advantage of their opportunities at the line, Rhode Island used its shooting to stay in the game.
Three-point shots were followed by long, athletic jumpers, the kind the GW zone couldn’t seem to stop from falling. Rams junior guard Xavier Munford was particularly dangerous, adding 20 points, followed by senior forward Nikola Malesevic, who had 16.
“We just wanted to give them a lot of different looks. I think one of our main things is that we try not to let the best player beat us. Tonight, we didn’t do that great of a job,” McDonald said.
GW couldn’t quite match their output in a single shooter, but collectively, individual performances came together to keep the Colonials in the game. Freshman forward Kevin Larsen added 10 points, senior forward Isaiah Armwood had 13 and five boards and McDonald had 12 points and three assists.
The Colonials’ bench was strong, posting a 21-6 points advantage on URI, a further sign of offensive growth that eluded the team earlier in the season.
“[Junior forward] Nemanja [Mikic] has been better. I thought he had a really good first half,” Lonergan said. “[Sophomore forward] John Kopriva, he missed some free throws, but he gave us a good boost. He got fouls on them, and they don’t play a lot of guys.”
And as the team braved the cold weather, heading back onto the bus in preparation for an early morning flight back to D.C., Lonergan stood in the bowels of the Ryan Center, contemplating the victory.
While it may have been a frustrating win, it was a resilient one, he said. And sometimes, to a young team, that’s almost more important.
“On the road, it’s not easy. They’re coming off their best win they’ve had in maybe two or three years at Saint Louis, so we knew they’d be ready to play,” Lonergan said.“

As the dust settled from last year’s conference realignment, it seemed the Atlantic 10 was established in a position of unique strength. Though Temple and Charlotte announced impending departures, the additions of VCU and Butler made the league one of the few to get stronger amid the shuffle.
Then, the December announcement that seven schools – the “Catholic 7” – would leave the Big East to form their own conference introduced new speculation into the shifting landscape of collegiate sports. There’s a possibility that various A-10 schools, including Butler, Dayton, Saint Louis and Xavier, may leave the conference to join the Catholic 7.
But athletic director Patrick Nero is preaching patience. Though the future seems uncertain, he acknowledged, the A-10’s history, combined with its recent improvements, is proof that the league won’t take a realignment hit.
“Historically, this has been kind of part of the fabric of the Atlantic 10 if you look through the past thirty years,” Nero said. “Sometimes they left one at a time, two at a time, three at a time. What the Atlantic 10 has always done really well has been to be prepared when a member leaves, we’ve been ready to act and act quickly.”
Nero said he has been in touch with athletic directors from some schools that could be affected by the Catholic 7 announcement, and added that ultimately, the decision will come down to the attributes they decide are most attractive for their programs. Everything from television markets, religious affiliations and geographic location could come into play, he said.
But the tone of the discussions among members of the A-10 is not one of panic, Nero said. While he pointed out that all talks are “pure speculation,” at least until further announcements are made, he said that the league is preparing for “five or six different scenarios,” depending on the amount and location of schools that could depart the league.
The recent searches that resulted in the additions of VCU and Butler are a boon, Nero added, because other schools that could have garnered an invitation during that process remain attractive options for the league.
“I do think that you will see a pretty quick reaction on behalf of the Atlantic 10 to say, ‘we’re ready,’ because we’ve been very proactive in our planning,” Nero said. “There’s always a chance we could add somebody prior to the Catholic 7 making their announcement. That’s always a possibility. It just depends on their timing.”
University President Steven Knapp, who serves as chair of the Atlantic 10 Conference Council of Presidents, also chairs a membership expansion committee, which combines various league athletic directors and presidents. While the group stopped meeting after the additions of VCU and Butler, Nero said discussions have picked up again in the wake of the Big East announcement.
Nero said he and Knapp are frequently in contact with A-10 commissioner Bernadette McGlade as well as other members of the group. Knapp added that the full council of presidents meets twice a year, but communicates by telephone “whenever there is a need for a quick decision,” and said he was in “regular contact” with McGlade.
“We will continue to evaluate potential new members, as we were already doing before the Big East voted to dissolve itself,” Knapp said. “In this ongoing evaluation, we will continue to focus on universities that share both our strong commitment to intercollegiate athletics and our academic values.”
Both Nero and Knapp feel the A-10 is prepared to address whatever changes may come its way. Patience is needed as the conference and its fans wait for further announcements to be made, Nero pointed out, but he said the league remains an attractive package, boosted by a lucrative new media rights deal and the men’s basketball championship tournament’s move to the Barclays Center.
The shake-up could, too, end in a stronger A-10, like the 21-team league ESPN speculated about amid the Catholic 7’s announcement.
“I think we’ve also learned to be patient, so if we lose two or three, it may take time. We might drop down a little bit as a conference. But we’ve always been able to recover, so I think, from our standpoint, we will have to make sure we continue to do the things we’ve always done,” Nero said. “No other non- football-sponsored-conference has had the history the Atlantic 10 has in regards to being successful in the [NCAA] basketball tournament.”

Correction appended
Students would be able to earn a bachelor of science in finance for the first time if the Board of Trustees approves the degree later this year.
Currently, students interested in the field must complete a bachelor’s in business administration with a concentration in finance, which adds extra general requirements.
The change is the first result of administrators’ efforts to add flexibility to the curriculum, allowing students to broaden their education with humanities courses or gain an edge in the job market with more economics or math classes.
Currently, business students’ four years are packed with requirements, making it difficult to double major in a field outside of that school. The new degree slices the number of general business administration courses finance students must take from 13 to three.
“We want [students] to have experience outside the business school and be able to do whatever they want to do,” assistant finance professor Min Hwang, who helped craft the new degree, said.
He said the school will only require students to concentrate in fields they prefer, leaving more time to take classes in other schools. The marketing department, which has 165 majors, could be next to start its own specialized degree, he added.
Finance is the school’s largest undergraduate concentration, comprising 240 students.
Business school faculty “almost unanimously” approved the 60-credit bachelor of science in finance degree at a meeting in December, Hwang said.
He said some hesitation from faculty revolved around whether students would want the degree instead of the traditional bachelor’s of business administration. The school will test the degree with about 30 interested students next fall, Hwang said.
Hwang said he did not formally solicit student opinion before recommending the change.
Matt Guarnaccia, a sophomore business major concentrating in finance, said the new degree was alluring and may seem more “legitimate” to potential employers.
“Being a finance major gives you a more solid educational background in finance than a business major concentrating in finance,” he said.
Enxhi Xhoxhi, a junior business major concentrating in finance, added that she felt the current slate of requirements has too much structure.
“College is supposed to be about having choices and getting exposed to new topics,” she said. “Personally, I really enjoy economics and would have liked the opportunity to take more economics courses and less general business administration courses.”
It is fairly common for business schools to offer B.S. degrees in finance. Schools like American, George Mason and Syracuse universities already grant them.
Robert Van Order, finance department chair, trumpeted the change, but said the B.S. degree will also add classes with more technical and math skills for students, which could be a potential turn-off.
“Students have to think first what they want to take. Not everyone will want to take the B.S. degree – in fact, maybe most won’t at first,” he said. “There’s a lot of work going into how to make a business degree work [and] balancing getting a job with a broad-based education.”
The academic focus falls in line with Dean Doug Guthrie’s drive for the school to integrate humanities and social sciences into students’ business education. The school has delayed the curriculum reform, pushing implementation dates back several times over the past two years as administrative posts in the office of undergraduate programs have shuffled and gone vacant.
Isabelle Bajeux-Besnainou, who became associate dean for undergraduate programs last May, said it would be “premature” for her to discuss the degree because of the need for the board’s approval.
Mary Sette and Cory Weinberg contributed to this report.
This article was updated Jan. 25, 2012 to reflect the following:
Due to misinformation from a source, The Hatchet incorrectly reported that the Board of Trustees would vote on approving the new degree in February. It will not reach a Board vote until later this year. We regret this error.
