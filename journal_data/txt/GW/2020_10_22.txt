Commissioners heard from University leaders Wednesday about off-campus gathering complaints and passed legislation urging D.C. officials to put the School Without Walls principal back in office. 
A local governing body pressured D.C. Public Schools officials to reinstate School Without Walls principal Richard Trogisch during a monthly meeting Wednesday night.
The Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission unanimously passed a resolution demanding Trogisch be reinstated following city officials’ decision to fire him after he refused to reopen school if classroom conditions were unsafe for school personnel amid the COVID-19 pandemic. His firing sparked public protests from local politicians and community members who say the city’s decision was an effort to silence opposition to D.C.’s school reopening plan.
Commissioners voted for their resolution to be considered as a vote of no confidence in D.C. Public Schools Chancellor Lewis Ferebee and other D.C. officials involved in Trogisch’s firing.
Here are the meeting’s highlights:
Reinstating the School Without Walls principal
Commissioners are asking Ferebee to explain his decision to fire Trogisch and to allow the school’s five associate and assistant principals to select the interim principal.
In addition to opposing school reopenings, Trogisch questioned city officials about the the air quality standards DCPS officials plan to regulate during the pandemic, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently updated its finding that the coronavirus can be transmitted as an airborne disease, the resolution states. The resolution states DCPS failed to provide Trogisch with a “specific answer,” prompting his statement against reopening which many believe ultimately led to his firing.
The resolution also requests that city officials inform the ANC of its air quality standards and update school community members with information about “the metrics for reopening and safety measures,” citing D.C.’s high rates of asthma and respiratory illness experienced by children in Wards 5, 7 and 8.
Commissioners also voted to request that the D.C. Council conduct hearings on “remediation efforts” at every D.C. school facility.
“School Without Walls High School is the closest public school in America to the White House, and the transparently cruel methods of silencing and terminating a whistleblower do not represent to our nation the values of the citizens of the District of Columbia, nor the concern that we have for our children and educators that our schools be reopened safely,” the resolution states.
Senior and the ANC’s chair James Harnett said commissioners invited Ferebee and Paul Kihn, the District’s deputy mayor of education, to join the monthly meeting, but the two declined, which Harnett said was “an abdication of their leadership.”
“We saw DCPS really take highly inappropriate action to silence an administrator who questioned the methodology of the DCPS central office and frankly is nothing more than an attempt, at least in my opinion, to silence the voice of a critical member of our community,” Harnett said.
Off-campus student complaints
University officials who attended the meeting presented local community members with GW’s COVID-19 policies and testing procedures.
Christy Anthony, the director of GW’s Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities, said administrators have received 26 complaints from Foggy Bottom residents about students violating University policy, like social distancing guidelines.
She said more than 120 students or student organizations living off campus have received warning letters, which remind students of COVID-19 restrictions that enforce mask wearing and limit gatherings to 10 people or less. Of those 120, Anthony said 34 students or student organizations have received “more elevated” conduct outcomes, some of which have included “removal sanctions”
Several neighbors voiced concerns with GW’s ability to control off-campus students, as officials have tied student gatherings in the neighborhood to an uptick in COVID-19 cases on campus – a possibility locals have feared since the start of the semester. Neighbors requested officials to start requiring all students living off campus in the Foggy Bottom and West End neighborhoods to receive the same weekly tests that on-campus students must receive, but Lynn Goldman, the dean of the Milken Institute School of Public Health, said officials have not yet found a way to enforce the measure.
Construction update
Commissioners also unanimously passed a resolution to create several additions to the moveDC 2021 plan, which outlines the city’s plan for the construction of new mass transit lanes, like bus lanes and freight corridors.
The ANC voted to include two-way protected bike lanes on 21st Street NW from at least G Street NW to Pennsylvania Avenue NW, 17th Street NW from K Street NW to Constitution Avenue NW and 15th Street NW from Pennsylvania Avenue NW to Maine Avenue SW. Commissioners also voted to reiterate a resolution passed last March, which called for dedicated bus lanes on 18th and 19th streets between K Street NW and Constitution Avenue NW.

Charles A. Garris, Jr. is a member of the Faculty Senate and the former chair of the Faculty Senate’s executive committee.  
On Oct. 9, the Faculty Senate amended a resolution entitled: “Of Severe Disapproval of President Thomas J. LeBlanc Regarding the Appointment of Heather Swain” which was presented by the Faculty Senate Appointment, Salary and Promotion Policies Committee earlier this month. The resolution stated, “whereas the appointment of Ms. Swain in light of the Special Counsel’s Investigation, was totally inconsistent with the core values of The George Washington University.”
In a Hatchet op-ed published Oct. 14, professors Phillip Wirtz and Sarah Wagner, both senators and members of ASPP, criticized the senate for downgrading the condemnation of President LeBlanc from “censure” to “severe disapproval.” Their argument is that President LeBlanc egregiously showed bad judgement in hiring Swain as GW’s vice president for communication and marketing in view of the “widespread criticism over her role in the follow-up investigation of the Larry Nassar sexual abuse case.” The clear suggestion is that Swain was involved in some ignominious action regarding the notorious anathema Larry Nassar of Michigan State University. Along with Wirtz and Wagner, I did not agree with the senate’s action. I voted “no.” In my analysis, Swain is an outstanding hire and President LeBlanc’s judgement was excellent.
However, something terrible did happen. Swain was a victim of an out-of-control GW social media echo chamber that mercilessly slandered her with misinformation. Had the senate, and particularly ASPP, done proper diligence, as should be expected from a distinguished faculty, they would have realized that the cited status report of the independent special counsel appointed by the Michigan state attorney general made no allegations whatsoever that Swain had acted wrongly or inappropriately. In the senate resolution’s fourth “whereas” clause, ASPP disingenuously truncated and presented out of context the following sentence from the report:
 “Vice President for Communications and Brand Strategy, Heather Swain, directed [MSU] Trustee Brian Breslin to copy university legal counsel Robert Noto on an email to other trustees in order to ‘maintain privilege,’ despite the fact that the email was not seeking any type of legal advice from Noto.” 
As a result, the resolution clearly suggested untoward allegations of Swain’s actions which were far from what the counsel intended. The counsel did intend to show that broadly, MSU was not fully cooperative in providing him documents and emails, and used Swain’s advice to a member of the MSU Board of Trustees as one example among many to illustrate that point. There is no suggestion that the trustee’s email involved any nefarious activity, nor was there a suggestion that Swain had any knowledge of the content of the email, nor that she did anything improper. Further, the counsel made clear that asserting privilege is very common in discovery during litigation and is subject to judicial review.  Hence, Swain’s advice to the trustee carried no ethical ramifications.
In summary, there is no evidence from the counsel’s report that Swain did anything wrong. Given her excellent resume and years of experience at MSU as the vice president of communications and brand strategy, and the fact that MSU welcomed her back to her old job after rescinding GW’s offer, President LeBlanc did not exercise poor judgement in appointing Swain as VP of communications at GW. The GW senate should have rejected the resolution in its entirety. The ASPP committee and the senate owe a “severe” apology to Swain for wrongly affirming her demonization in the GW media, to President LeBlanc for attempting to erroneously censure him and to the GW community for the lack of diligence, unfaithfulness to GW’s core values and their inept representation of the GW faculty.

American Son's Mexican blue shrimp rice noodle salad burst with umami, complemented by just a bit of heat. 
For light, international and American fare, try American Son in downtown D.C.
American Son is located inside of the Eaton Hotel at 1201 K St. NW, just blocks from the White House. Customers can sit inside of the restaurant, an open-air space that features velvet furniture and sharp geometric lightning fixtures, or opt for sidewalk seating outside.
The menu consists of “smalls,” or appetizers, and “un-smalls,” or entrees. The highlight of American Son is its collection of Neapolitan pizzas, like the cured egg ($18), bahn mi ($16) and backyard bbq ($17) pies.
The eatery also offers dishes for vegetarian guests. Some of its meat-free dishes include the fried green tomatoes ($14), accompanied by a cucumber creme fraiche and a summer chow chow – pickled relish – and the impossible meatballs ($18), made of plant-based meat and topped with shaved Grana Padano.
Don’t miss out on the restaurant’s house cocktails, like the “tropical” ($14), a combination of rum, cognac, bourbon, pineapple and citrus. If you make it in time for happy hour – every day from 3 to 6 p.m. – cocktails are $10, draft beers are $5 and house wines are $6. Plus, select menu items like the Meyer lemon calamari with ghost pepper marmalade and pickled cucumber sauce ($8), which is usually $14, are offered at nearly half price during happy hour.
I opted for the Mexican blue shrimp rice noodle salad ($17), a refreshing, chilled dish consisting of rice noodles, pickled carrots and peppers, cilantro, mint and juicy shrimp in a hoisin sauce.
The hoisin sauce that coated the dish was tart, citrusy and bursting with umami, but I wish there was more on the plate. The sauce complemented the noodles, which were dusted with red pepper flecks to add a bit of heat. The shrimp was plump – juicy on the inside and expertly seared on the outside – pairing nicely with the toothsome rice noodles.
The dish was also garnished with a light assortment of crisp and sour pickled vegetables, which added a welcomed crunch and acidity to the dish. And finally, fresh cilantro and mint finished the dish. I appreciated that the dish wasn’t too hefty – I was satisfied after eating the seven pieces of shrimp and pile of noodles on my plate.
We also decided to give American Son’s signature pizzas a try. I shared the prosciutto and arugula pizza ($19) with a friend. The pizza was tasty, and I’d recommend it to split with someone as an appetizer. But the shrimp and noodle salad was definitely the star of the meal, and it’s what I would go back to next time I grab a bite to eat there.
For eccentric dishes you can find close to some of the best sightseeing in D.C., check out American Son.

During a typical day working at IKEA, my co-worker and friend called me over and asked if I could help out at her register. I briskly walked over to find her in a tense situation with an older, white male customer who demanded my friend lift a heavy box right side up to scan the item. Despite being able to take it off the shelf, place the heavy box into the cart and push it through the entire warehouse, he refused to touch it at checkout. So I ended up doing it myself — with my scrawny, 19-year-old arms. My co-worker was able to scan the box with no help from him – then he scoffed and demanded to speak to a manager. 
When another associate went to go get the manager on duty, she muttered under her breath, “someone needs to tell that guy slavery ain’t no more.” 
Both my associate and co-worker were Black women, and this powerful comment from my associate in retaliation to the white entitlement cut the tension so hard that being in the presence of it left me verklempt but surprisingly a bit vindicated on their behalf. This clever, timely verbal pushback to mitigate such abrasive, tone-deaf behavior is far from an isolated instance when you work in the service industry. I won’t forget how impactful her statement felt as I stood there, supporting my friend as we collectively got stared down with disgust from this gentleman until my leader arrived. As the verse goes in Taylor Swift’s song “The Story of  Us,” I had never heard silence this loud.
In 2020, that person is what I’ve called the “Sir Karen” – a customer who does not get what they want then finds a scapegoat. Instead of letting it go and going on with their days, they demand to speak to a manager to feel validated by going over our heads to exercise an abuse of power. They don’t even give a “thank you,” let alone an apology for their behavior. They don’t take responsibility and to them, you shouldn’t expect they’ll treat you like you’re human because all they see is a yellow striped shirt that says “IKEA” in big, bold lettering. There’s an ongoing joke between co-workers that IKEA is the “Swedish furniture circus gone global” and we as co-workers are the main spectacle while the products are the objects to perform tricks with. 
Common sense and humanity is nonexistent inside the store. People treat you like an idiot and then expect you to know their specific piece of furniture along with their specific combination – one of 10,000 items within IKEA’s catalog. And if they’re not having a good day, it’s time to play verbal beat down with you’re “useless” or “incapable” while you defend your character on the spot. 
After an experience like that, the store manager sometimes pops onto the sales floor, expecting us to help the next one hundred customers like everything is fine, ignoring the physical throbbing leg and foot pain while also remedying the psychological verbal abuse from strangers. Instead of addressing the issues or discussing our experiences, we get pulled into meetings and are told to “smile more.”
Then the day ends and you clock out, you feel tired but you do it all over again because you love connecting with co-workers and customers who tell you that those “Karens” are not worth worrying about because they’ll be gone by tomorrow. You have a unique bond with your peers because they know your exact pain and will slip you a jolly rancher or cover you when you need to catch your breath in private. Sometimes, a hug makes all the difference in turning the day around and a good laugh with your unconditional working family. 
People who work in retail have an unspoken understanding of our collective experiences. On one of my days off, I was at a Panera Bread and ended up having a conversation with the cashier taking my order. I shared some of these experiences with her, and we had a good laugh about some of the experiences we had as cashiers. I asked how she dealt with the stress, and she said it was a good way to build her character as well as to stand her ground respectfully. After my order was ready, she walked over with my brown paper bag, sealed up with a handwritten smile and two free cookies. I thanked her and left with a bit of hope while I ate that freshly baked M&M’s cookie. 
It costs nothing to be kind and to see the people like me who work in retail as human beings. People forget that co-workers in these stores are also human and are consumers once we take off the badge and the uniform. As the idiom goes and one I live by: Treat others the way you want to be treated.

GW’s total enrollment drop – about 2.9 percent – was far less than the 30 percent drop officials originally projected in May if classes remained online this year.
GW’s undergraduate population fell by nearly 8 percent this year alongside a more than 20 percent decline in the overall international student population.
Jay Goff, the vice provost of enrollment and student success, said the University enrolled 11,104 undergraduates this year – a 7.7 percent annual decrease – while graduate enrollment fell by just 0.2 percent as many students changed their academic plans during the pandemic. Administrators plan to begin publicizing some of the enrollment census data later this week, which is used for official statistics, he said.
Officials released regular undergraduate admission decisions just as classes moved online in spring 2020, but administrators tapped into GW’s waitlist and accepted additional transfer students to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the University’s enrollment.
“We targeted every applicant who met our academic criteria and also tried to make sure we supported our diversity goals,” Goff said. “Those were two primary factors as we evaluated the waitlist and transfer applicants.”
He said GW enrolled 2,274 new “residential” undergraduates this year, falling short of officials’ pre-pandemic target by nearly 300 students. Officials had sought to enroll a smaller incoming class of 2,550 first-year freshmen and transfer undergraduates as part of a multiyear plan to decrease the undergraduate population by nearly 20 percent, which has been halted during the pandemic.
“We did really well with both the academic and diversity outcomes this year,” Goff said. “Some years you do a little bit better than others. I think the focused student outreach work that was done in the enrollment and admissions offices really paid off.”
GW’s total enrollment drop – about 2.9 percent – was far less than the 30 percent drop officials originally projected in May if classes remained online this year. Goff said administrators’ budget projection from the spring was based on limited surveys and feedback from students before final decisions were made for the fall.

He said national enrollment trends won’t be known until late November or early December, but GW’s data appears to be similar to other schools based on preliminary estimates.
“In terms of initial reports from schools that went to a complete virtual environment, the pandemic’s impact on our enrollments looks to be about the same or in some cases a little bit better,” Goff said.
Goff said he has “no indication” that GW’s enrollment will change this spring beyond normal trends. Fifteen incoming undergraduates who deferred their admission this fall paid an enrollment deposit for the spring semester last week, he said.
Diversity
Although GW enrolled a smaller incoming class this year, most diversity measures remained stable or improved.
Goff said the proportion of underrepresented minorities in GW’s newest class – comprising students who identify as Black, Hispanic, Native American or Pacific Islander and those with two or more races if one is among those populations – increased from 20 percent to 23 percent.
The proportion of first generation students remained unchanged, while the proportion of Pell Grant recipients increased from 14 percent to 16 percent.
Courtesy of the Office of the Provost
Goff said like most universities, GW saw a large drop in international student population as a result of travel restrictions imposed during the pandemic. GW enrolled 860 fewer international students this year, reflecting an annual decline of 20.6 percent, he said.
The undergraduate and graduate international student populations fell 18.4 percent and 18.8 percent, respectively, alongside an 86.2 percent drop in the number of non-degree international students.
“That is something we recognized early on and immediately put activities in place so that we could backfill the anticipated loss in international students with additional domestic students,” he said. “That’s why we looked very heavily into increasing the number of transfer students and we used the domestic student waitlist.”
Academics
Goff said measures of academic standing, including mean GPA, SAT scores and ACT scores, remained relatively constant for the incoming class.
“It is a smaller class, but in terms of its academic talent, it is still one of the top classes to start at GW,” he said.
The proportion of first-year STEM students remained unchanged at 25 percent this year, Goff said. Officials had sought to increase the proportion of STEM majors from 19 percent to 30 percent as part of the now-halted 20/30 Plan.
He said GW saw enrollment growth in law, public health, health sciences and business fields. Goff said all undergraduate colleges’ enrollment fell this year except for the Milken Institute School of Public Health, because students can now enroll in the school immediately rather than during their sophomore year, and the School of Nursing.
Courtesy of the Office of the Provost
He added that the Graduate School of Education and Human Development, public health school, School of Business and School of Medicine and Health Sciences saw increases in their graduate student populations.
The law school’s Juris Doctor program enrolled 175 more students this year, an increase of 11.2 percent, Goff said.
“I think it’s an excellent sign,” he said. “It reinforces the tremendous reputation of the law school. Even in this environment, students understand what a high-quality program we offer.”

Updated: Nov. 3, 2020 at 1:30 p.m.
The Student Court announced Sunday that it will hold a public hearing later this month on a complaint on the validity of first-year Student Association senators and their voting rights.
The court will hear from a complaint filed Aug. 27 challenging the appointment of first-year SA Senate seats. The general order schedules a public hearing for Oct. 29 at 8 p.m. via Zoom to hear from representatives in Witte v. Student Association.
“Parties are free to advance jurisdictional arguments in their allocated time for presenting oral arguments but are advised that their time may be better focused on advancing their respective arguments on the merits,” the order states.
The order comes two years after SA leaders filed a complaint questioning the legality of first-year senator voting rights in their second semester in the senate. The court dismissed the complaint in fall 2018, but judges met in late August to revisit the case.
The order states each party will have 20 minutes to present an oral argument in front of the Court. Witte will represent himself during the hearing, and SA Vice President for Judicial and Legislative Affairs Jean Hyun will represent the SA.
Witte and Hyun declined to comment.
This post was updated to correct the following:
The Hatchet incorrectly reported that the court will hold a hearing on a complaint to split the SA into two bodies. The court will hear a case on the status of first-year senators and their voting rights. We regret this error.

Law students have not had the opportunity to speak with administrators about COVID-19 concerns in a public forum since March, Baumrin said.
The Student Bar Association Senate voted to host two town halls with law school administrators to voice “grievances” in response to COVID-19 academic and financial procedures.
The resolution, which passed with 21 in favor and one abstention, asks law school officials to host two, nonconsecutive SBA-led town halls before Nov. 20 that are open to all GW Law students. Members of the SBA said students must be able to speak their minds in real time at the town halls instead of a previous format of meetings where students were required to submit their questions in advance.
SBA Sen. Rurik Asher Baumrin, who presented the act, said the bill recognizes “storytelling” as a powerful advocacy tool and the need for all students to be involved in policy changes. Law students have not had the opportunity to speak with administrators about COVID-19 concerns in a public forum since March, he said.
He said students will be able to share their own personal stories of why a tuition decrease for the academic year would benefit them. Officials offered a 10 percent tuition cut for all undergraduates not living on campus, but they only chose to not raise tuition for graduate students.
“At the end of the day, winning a fair grade tuition policy is not something that the SBA can do all by itself,” Baumrin said. “That kind of change is really big and it happens when the student body rises up, speaks and demands to be heard.”
Baumrim said the town halls serve as a space that is “opposite” of what administrators have offered to students in the past because meetings typically consist of updates from deans with an opportunity for students to respond. The SBA-proposed town halls aim to give students an “active” role in speaking with administrators by asking questions during the meetings that concern them, he said.
“We don’t disparage those town halls, and they have been useful,” he said. “But in those town halls, administrators control the narrative. Students are given a passive role of asking questions, which may or may not be selective.”
The resolution states administrators have “inadequately” addressed concerns regarding education for the law school and refuse to reverse its grading policy for the 2020-21 academic year, even though the pandemic is still affecting students’ education. Law school officials implemented a mandatory Credit/No Credit policy for courses last spring, but they have not adopted any grading or exam accommodations for the academic year, according to the resolution.
Senators confirmed Brandi Tennant, a first-year law student, as a member of the SBA’s academic affairs and policy committee. The Senate also approved $36 for GW Law Soccer to purchase sanitation supplies for a soccer tennis event.

SA Sen. Lydia Abera, GWSB-U and the sponsor of the act, said the resolution is designed to hold officials accountable for phasing out single-use plastics as they announced in June.
The Student Association Senate passed a resolution Monday pushing the University to eliminate single-use plastic bottles on campus.
Senators urged officials to eliminate the use of single-use plastics and increase the number of refilling stations on campus. The senate also confirmed six new members for five graduate positions and one undergraduate position, confirmed four research aides and unanimously voted in a vice president for sustainability.
SA Sen. Lydia Abera, GWSB-U and the sponsor of the act, said the resolution is designed to hold officials accountable for phasing out single-use plastics as they announced in June. She said purchasing single-use plastic bottles costs the University roughly $2,000 more than paying for tap water so officials would save money in the long term if they place more filling stations around campus.
“The Board of Trustees’ Environmental, Social and Governance Responsibility Task Force released a statement saying they are going to commit to ensuring our campus becomes a role model for urban sustainability by phasing out single-use plastics across the University,” she said. “And this legislation is doing just that. We want it in writing and saying, ‘Hey, this is what you said you would do, and we want you to phase up the water bottles off campus.’”
SA Sen. Gabriel Young, CCAS-U and a co-sponsor of the resolution, said he spoke with members of Take Back the Tap – an organization that encourages students to eliminate their use of single-use plastics – who said Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Mark Diaz already approved finances for increasing the number of filling stations on campus.
“I think the fact that Mark Diaz already approved it is enough to be said that the numbers must have already been approved and calculated,” Young said.
The senate also confirmed Charlotte Gaynor and Issacc Abecasis, two first-year graduate students in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences as SEAS graduate senators and sophomore Christian Williams to an undergraduate Columbian College of Arts and Sciences seat.
Faith Adeola, a second-year graduate student in the Milken Institute School of Public Health, and Ama Appiah, a first-year graduate student, were appointed to graduate-at-large positions, and Paula Reynal, a first-year graduate student in the Elliott School of International Affairs, was confirmed to an Elliott School graduate seat.
Karina Michelle Ochoa Berkley was also approved as the vice president for sustainability.

Provost Brian Blake announced in an email that in light of the spring semester’s virtual instruction, the University will suspend all study abroad programs for the remainder of the academic year. Blake said the Office for Study Abroad will contact students who had hoped to travel abroad in the spring to “provide guidance on changing plans.”
He said students enrolled in programs like the Global Bachelor’s program with an international experience requirement will receive additional information from their schools.
