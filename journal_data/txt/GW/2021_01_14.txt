Menya Hosaki uses three main broths in its soups: the chicken-based chintan, a milky-like pork tonkotsu and kelp and dried fish dashi stock.
Ditch your Top Ramen dinner for a night and try out the newly-opened Menya Hosaki in Petworth.
At 845 Upshur St. NW, the restaurant is an eight minute walk away from the Georgia Ave-Petworth Metro station on the Green and Yellow lines. Menya Hosaki currently offers limited outdoor patio seating and takeout due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and it’s not available on a delivery app. 
You should be in the mood for ramen if you plan to check out this new establishment — it’s the only option on the menu. Seoul, South Korea-native Eric Yoo was trained at New York City’s late Ramen Shack, so the chef’s eight varieties of ramen are made to impress your taste buds.
The restaurant is not open every day of the week. Menya Hosaki serves dinner between 4:30 and 9 p.m. Wednesday through Saturday and is only open for lunch on Saturday between 11:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. 
I opted to dine-in early at the restaurant’s back-patio, fit with gas heaters to stay warm. By 5 p.m. three of the five tables were already occupied, so I would recommend adding yourself to a waitlist beforehand on the restaurant’s website. 
Both the inside and outside of Menya Hosaki are chic and minimalist, complete with a small sign on the front door and a Japanese lantern that sits by the window. Inside, you could watch the chef prep meals from your table in a post-COVID world.

Menya Hosaki uses three main broths to make its rich noodle soups: a chicken-based broth called chintan, a milky-like tonkotsu made from pork bones and the typical kelp and dried fish dashi stock. All of the bowls are topped off with scallions, seaweed, bamboo shoots, pickled ginger, egg and thick cuts of chashu pork belly.  

For a taste of every broth, opt for the “Triple Threat” ($18). Or, if you’re looking for a restaurant classic, order the shoyu-style ($15), which includes a combination of both the dashi and chintan broths. Vegetarians and vegans can also comfortably dine at Menya Hosaki – chefs use an almond-milk broth alternative for a mild, classic broth and spicy tantan men, which are both topped with sauteed mushrooms. 
Knowing I wanted something with a bit of heat, I settled on the spicy version of the tonkotsu ($17). 
The rich, creamy broth bursted with umami from the bone marrow, while the noodles were dense enough to suck up even more of the broth. The pork belly was tender and fatty, and the few bits of raw scallion added a delicious zing. 
I washed down my mean with Kyoto yuzu ale ($10), a Japanese beer that pairs well with spicy dishes. The restaurant’s drink list isn’t extensive, but it offers a solid collection of Japanese and sakes, a variation of Japanese liquor.
Now that I’ve savored one bowl, I am bound to try out Menya Hosaki again and savor the restaurant’s other specialty noodle soups.

Linker said the purpose of the resolution is for the SBA to formally condemn the riot on the Capitol.
The Student Bar Association Senate unanimously passed a resolution condemning the riot at the U.S. Capitol last week during its first meeting of the spring semester Tuesday.
SBA Sen. Jacob Linker and SBA Senate Secretary Yun-Da Tsai co-sponsored a resolution that the body “unequivocally condemns” the attack on the Capitol and recognizes the damage caused to the “integrity” of the U.S. democratic election. The senate also tabled a resolution that would form a committee to investigate GW Law’s grade release policy and call on officials to expedite the length of time for grades to be released.
Tsai said the Capitol riot resolution is largely “symbolic,” but the events at the Capitol intensify the need for the resolution. He said the body is also calling on the support of law school officials in condemning the riot.
“The value here is demonstrating your SBA’s awareness of the events, the threat to some of the fundamental values of our common profession and expression of hopefully universal sentiments of what happened last Wednesday,” Tsai said.
Linker said the purpose of the resolution is for the SBA to formally condemn the riot on the Capitol.
“The first modern democracy faced an onslaught against our traditions as a mad president invoked a riot against the electoral process and the whole world watched in horror,” Linker said.

SBA President Jackie Fisher said the SBA executive branch condemns the violence and said she will reach out to law school administrators to communicate a GW safety plan in the event of another “attack.”
“I would like to acknowledge the trauma of last week’s event,” Fisher said. “As I said in my newsletter, these were disruptive displays of violence and in particular to members of the Black and Jewish communities here at GW Law.”
Fisher also outlined her goals for the upcoming semester, stating they include assisting students with “getting jobs” and allocating money into an accessible fund for law students for any financial support they may need.
“I think last semester we spent a lot of time dealing with emergencies and constantly putting out fires,” Fisher said. “I want to make sure we are not rejecting our obligation to build a community.”
The senate tabled a resolution, which Linker introduced, that would have an appointed committee investigate a “delayed” timeline that law students have faced when receiving grades. Grades for the law school during the fall semester have “historically” been released “well into” January, according to the resolution.
“This puts the University on notice that we are going to be working on it and we are going to be asking questions, and it tells all of our constituents that we are working,” Linker said.

SA Sen. Charlene Richards, U-at-Large and a co-sponsor of the resolution, said a common thread of challenges for freshmen appeared to be accessing certain University resources because they are not aware they are available.
The Student Association Senate approved first-year senators’ recommendations for officials to increase social activities and academic support for the freshman class, like increased guidance about available resources for freshmen, at its first meeting of the semester Monday.
Three first-year SA senators presented feedback from more than 300 freshmen, collected through a survey and a town hall last semester, that they are largely unaware of available “University-wide resources” and feel a lack of connection to the University in taking online courses. Senators also voted to convert the current first-year seats to undergraduate-at-large seats to permit those senators voting rights and set guidelines for SA members’ use of electronic platforms and social media for purposes like advocacy efforts.
Senators recommended officials improve the “first-year undergraduate experience” by creating and publicizing instructional videos on how to use campus services, create programming to “bring first-year students together” at least once a month in the spring semester and host at least one town hall in the spring dedicated to freshmen, according to the legislation.
SA Sen. Charlene Richards, U-at-Large and a co-sponsor of the resolution, said a common thread of challenges for freshmen appeared to be accessing certain University resources because they are not aware the resources are available. She said responses also stressed a lack of connection to GW, and she recommended that officials attempt to increase the role of the freshman class in “plans and decisions made by the University.”
“To address these concerns, a few of our recommendations in the senate resolution focus on increasing direct communication between University leadership and students as well as finding a space for current first-year undergraduate students in the future return to campus and orientation plans,” Richards said.
SA Sen. Jack Bloom, U-at-Large and the sponsor of the resolution, said the legislation “formally acknowledges” challenges freshmen experienced during the virtual fall semester.
The senate also voted to add updated language to the SA’s governing bylaws, regarding senate members’ use of technology to advocate for issues in the community and who is responsible for managing the SA’s virtual platforms. The legislation comes after SA President Howard Brookins apologized on behalf of the executive branch for sharing an Instagram post indicating support for Armenia in a war with neighboring Azerbaijan.
SA Sen. Yan Xu, U-at-Large and the sponsor of the act, said the guidelines in the resolution allow senators to collaborate with one another through virtual communication methods. The legislation specifically outlines eight permitted uses of the SA’s social media for purposes like advocacy and awareness efforts, responding to questions from community members and updating the public on SA achievements.
The SA’s vice president for public affairs will “open and manage electronic communication accounts” and hold all usernames and passwords for SA “channels,” according to the legislation. The public affairs vice president and “authorized appointees” can also take down any social media posts or comments on behalf of the SA if they do not abide by the guidelines of the SA’s governing documents, the legislation states.
“Last semester, a repost on the SA Instagram about the Armenia and Azerbaijan conflict let us see the importance of proving outlines for SA electronic communication forms and usage,” Xu said.
Senators also approved Hannah Clayton, the body’s director of the arts, onto the Faculty Senate’s libraries committee and confirmed SA Sen. Jovawn McNeil, ESIA-U, onto the Joint Committee of Faculty and Students – a committee of seven SA representatives and seven faculty members that focuses on academic affairs issues.
SA Executive Vice President Brandon Hill presented the SA’s mid-year report, highlighting actions from the body during the first half of their term, like the SA’s donation of $70,000 to the GW Cares fund. He added that the senate had passed 14 resolutions and 12 bills by the end of the fall semester, which amounts to 157 pages of legislation – more than double the amount by last year’s senate.

Thomas Falcigno is a graduate student in the Graduate School of Political Management. He also serves as a graduate senator representing the College of Professional Studies and as the chairperson pro-tempore in the Student Association Senate.
Last week, we all watched in horror as domestic terrorists attacked the U.S. government. They breached the walls of the U.S. Capitol as both houses of Congress met to count the electoral votes, a sacred and uniquely American tradition. These terrorists were armed with ladders, chemical irritants, zip ties to take hostages and many other types of weaponry. 
In addition to being a part-time graduate student, working to attain my master’s degree in GW’s Graduate School of Political Management, I work full time on Capitol Hill, just like many other GSPM students. While I was thankfully working from home that day, many of my colleagues were not. 
Last Thursday evening, once the dust had settled, I opened my email to find a letter from University President Thomas LeBlanc. In the first sentence of the letter, he writes, “Like many of you, I watched in horror and dismay as violent protesters stormed the Capitol and tried to prevent the United States Congress from performing its constitutional duty of counting the Electoral College votes from the presidential election.” 
While I do not believe LeBlanc had mal intent, his use of the term “violent protesters” to describe the insurrectionists who invaded our Capitol was disgusting, shameful and dismissive of the experiences of those in our GW community who feared for their lives as this attack unfolded. Let me be clear, protesters do not protest with zip ties, ladders, chemical irritants or weapons. This attack was composed of domestic terrorists who sought to upend our democratic republic. LeBlanc owes the GW community, specifically those in our community who work on Capitol Hill, a profound and sincere apology for calling these traitorous individuals “violent protesters.”
As these domestic terrorists laid siege on our temple of American democracy, staffers were forced to flee to safety, having to barricade themselves in whatever secure room was nearby. Journalists put themselves in harm’s way to document the horror taking place inside and outside of the building. Members of Congress were prevented from carrying out their constitutional duties as our government came to a halt. At the time I am writing this, at least five people in the crosshairs of the riot have died, including one U.S. Capitol police officer. All of this occurred as we witnessed the president of the United States celebrate, incite and glorify this violence. 
The trauma that has been inflicted on not only hill staffers and members of Congress, but the entire nation, is severe. People I have talked to compare the way they felt on Wednesday to the events of Sept. 11, 2001. Personally, it has been difficult to fully comprehend what this country endured this past week. Even now, it feels like a really bad dream, that this could not have actually happened.  
This is not the first time GW has failed to acknowledge reality and the pain of the student community in it’s messaging. Counting my undergraduate years at GW, I have been at the University for more than five years. Time and time again, GW fails to communicate properly with the student community. When events occur that are worth responding to, they release statements that seem like they were written by a lawyer protecting a guilty client. I would urge administrators to learn from this experience. Start communicating with students in a way that it actually seems like you care about our well-being, with messaging that is based on reality and truth that explicitly acknowledges the pain and suffering of members of our community – not this robotic and protectionist language that achieves nothing and leaves students feeling angry and unseen.
On Wednesday, our nation experienced an attack, perpetrated by terrorists – not protesters. As a country, we need to be honest about what happened and that starts within our GW community. Words matter.

When I was 14 years old, my high school English teacher, an older White man, called me a “feminazi.”
For the life of me, I cannot remember what I said to incite that label. Whatever it was however, I’m not convinced I earned it. In truth, the comment broke me down after he said it. My entire life, I was raised surrounded by strong, empowered women. By the time I could speak, I knew I was a feminist unafraid to use my voice. And as the granddaughter of Jewish Holocaust survivors, I didn’t find the second half of this label particularly clever either. But this was certainly not a unique moment of my childhood.
In 2017, our society began to reevaluate the way it treats women, particularly in the workplace. The #MeToo and Times Up Movements shined a light on gender discrimination, harassment and violence. As a senior in high school, it was the first moment in which I realized that my experience with harassment was not all that different from many other women and girls. Just a year prior, during the 2016 election, it was clear that Hillary Clinton – both the most qualified candidate on paper and the only female – received backlash exclusive to her gender. These derogatory comments came from both sides of the aisle, including from a former presidential campaign manager for Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who called the former secretary “ambitious.” During the recent terrorist attack on the Capitol, many female figures were singled out – most significantly was Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. A man degraded the office, acted crudely, left a death threat and called her a “bitch.” Many of the comments he and other insurrections made were directly targeted to her womanhood. To change this rhetoric, action must be taken from a much younger age.
It often seems like almost every industry has their own issues with gender-based harassment and discrimination. But so many of our tendencies and characteristics are built from a young age. When young girls see their female role models put down in the media, it affects the way they grow up. When young girls are themselves put down for speaking up or having an unpopular opinion, it affects the way they grow up. As a society, we need to start building up young girls – from the earliest years – if we are going to change the way the workplace conducts itself on gender-based issues. This change starts with everyone – students, professors, parents, siblings and even strangers. It is within our power to change how we are perceived and to change the age old narratives that women are less than.
Developmental psychology teaches us that our understanding of what makes us different begins very young. The famous doll test asked young children to label White and Black baby dolls and choose which one they prefer. Unsurprisingly, this study, which was used in “Brown v. Board of Education,” found that both Black and White children overwhelmingly preferred the white dolls and considered them superior to the Black dolls. Gender roles and sexism work the same way. Institutional policies like dress codes teach young girls they are objects of desire to be hidden from men. These policies often discriminate not only along gender lines, but racial lines as well. The enforcement of these policies often leads to more drastic and lasting impacts on girls of color – specifically Black girls – than any other group.
Culturally, comments such as “you throw like a girl,” “you’re smart for a girl,” and “feminazi,” build up overtime to the point where being a girl is bad and being a boy is good. It insinuates that throwing “like a girl” is somehow inferior to the way boys throw. Or that because boys are “naturally more intelligent” than being smart, and a girl, is somehow surprising. Ultimately, these types of microaggressions from both our peers, role models and authority figures take on the same effect as the doll study from the mid-20th century. Should we truly intend for these discriminatory concepts to end in adulthood, a culture shift must occur in childhood.

He said the vaccine "provides hope" that study abroad programs may resume in the fall.
Study abroad programs and nonessential student travel will remain suspended for the summer, according to an email sent to GW community members Wednesday.
Provost Brian Blake announced the continued suspension of abroad programs and nonessential travel due to the likelihood of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout continuing through the summer. Blake said as the year progresses, officials will continue to monitor national and international vaccination trends to ensure student travel in the future.
He said the vaccine “provides hope” that study abroad programs may resume in the fall. The Office for Study Abroad is now receiving applications for fall 2021 programs, Blake said.
“We understand that the global citizenship, intercultural learning and exciting research opportunities that study abroad provides are an important part of the GW experience,” Blake said.
He added that there is a “light at the end of the tunnel,” and he is “optimistic” about the opportunities GW offers beyond the pandemic.

Officials said the additional measures came after consulting with GW's safety and security teams.
Officials will close GW offices and Foggy Bottom COVID-19 testing sites during the upcoming presidential inauguration out of security concerns following last week’s riot at the U.S. Capitol.
University President Thomas LeBlanc and other administrators announced Wednesday they will designate Inauguration Day as a University holiday, close the Foggy Bottom Campus except for residential students and designated on-site staff and implement an expanded security presence. The National Guard has deployed thousands of troops to the District as the FBI warns of potential armed protests at all 50 state capitols and in D.C.
“Please be assured that, as ever, safety is driving every action we take, and we remain in close coordination with our local, regional and federal partners,” officials said. “We stand ready to take any additional actions necessary to protect the safety of our campus and our University community.”
Officials said the additional measures came after consulting with GW’s safety and security teams.
The Foggy Bottom Campus will be limited to residential students and designated on-site staff between Saturday and Inauguration Day. Campus libraries will suspend in-person services but continue virtual operations, officials said.
“If you are not required to come to campus, do not come to campus,” officials said.
Mayor Muriel Bowser asked people to avoid the Central Business District, except for those with essential work.
Officials said they will also close COVID-19 testing sites on Foggy Bottom between Monday, Jan. 18 and Wednesday, Jan. 20.
Medical Faculty Associates clinics located in Foggy Bottom will also close out of security concerns on Tuesday but were already planned to be closed for Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Inauguration Day.
“In the wake of the events at the Capitol and in anticipation of the upcoming presidential inauguration, we expect local and federal agencies will deploy a significant security presence in the District over the coming days due to the potential for further civil unrest,” officials said. “This will include a large contingent of National Guard members, and we anticipate there may be checkpoints, roadblocks and other limitations on movement in the vicinity of our Foggy Bottom Campus.”

Metropolitan Police Department officers spread traffic barriers along the length of 20th Street on campus Tuesday as part of the department’s security provisions for the upcoming presidential inauguration.
Officers installed the security fencing barriers along 3rd and 20th streets NW between L Street and Independence Avenue at 7:40 p.m. Tuesday, according to an MPD traffic advisory. The advisory states the closures are “subject to change” and instructs commuters to look out for directions from MPD officers and U.S. Park Police.
MPD spokesperson Hugh Carew declined a request for comment.
MPD issued a previous traffic advisory Monday night via Twitter, notifying locals about parking restrictions and street closures that would go into effect at 6 a.m. Tuesday.
“Morning commuters should be aware of parking restrictions and potential street closures in the downtown area,” the advisory reads. “Stay tuned for additional updates.”

Mayor Muriel Bowser extended the city’s indoor dining ban two days beyond the presidential inauguration Tuesday, as locals brace for potential public safety threats to follow last week’s riots at the U.S. Capitol.
Bowser extended the ban, which cites “public safety and health reasons,” until Jan. 22 at 5:00 a.m. before it was set to expire this Friday, according to her official order. Bowser said during a press conference Monday that the move would be targeted at public safety fears amid the anticipation of renewed riots around Inauguration Day, Washington City Paper reported.
COVID-19 cases started to surge following the ban’s first installment, according to the report. Bowser’s order notes that total COVID-19 infections in D.C. have climbed to almost 32,000, resulting in 821 deaths.
“More than 22 million Americans have been infected with COVID-19 and more than 373,000 have died from the disease,” the order reads. “We have hit a new record in the District, with transmission at 41.22 new cases per 100,000 persons.”
The ban, which also closes museums and libraries, still permits restaurants to continue offering outdoor dining and carryout and delivery services.
