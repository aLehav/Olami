Sights of Ukrainian Solidarity

Demonstrators have gathered outside the White House over the last week, protesting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.


As the conflict between Ukraine and Russia heightens, activists gathered at the Lincoln Memorial last Sunday to protest the invasion and to encourage the United States to take action against Russia.


Support organizations providing Ukraine with humanitarian assistance, aiding Ukrainian refugees, promoting Ukrainian culture and documenting the war.

GW has been an expensive university throughout recent history – at one point holding the dubious honor of being the most expensive college in the country. While the University no longer occupies the top slot on that list, attending GW still takes a toll on the bank accounts of students and their families. And now, a tuition hike is inbound – for most undergraduates, yearly cost of attendance is about to cross $80,000.
This tuition hike may well have been merited given the University’s pandemic-era financial woes, inflation or the other justifications officials cited. But increasing the cost of attending GW is less likely to impact the wealthier students. Rather, it is going to make it harder for lower-income students to attend GW unless paired with a strong increase in financial aid. When it comes to making GW a more accessible place for all students to come and learn, the University needs to go forward, not backward. Officials have said they plan to increase financial aid to offset the tuition hikes – but the University needs to go into far more detail about these plans as soon as possible to put students at ease about their ability to attend GW.
Next academic year will be the priciest in history for students. Tuition is climbing by 3.9 percent for students who enrolled after fall 2020 and fall under the new “floating tuition” cost plan. When housing, food and other expenses are factored in, the cost for freshmen is going to be 4.5 percent higher. That equates to thousands of dollars more that students and their families will need to come up with to attend GW.
Higher costs of attendance, obviously, impact students from lower-income backgrounds the most. GW’s reputation as a rich kids’ school often obscures the fact that many students’ families are not wealthy. 35 percent of GW students rely on loans to help pay for college, and nearly half receive need-based financial aid. Further, increased tuition costs tend to make universities less racially diverse – which would be an unacceptable outcome.
Granted, officials have said that the University does not anticipate a drop in enrollment and that higher financial aid packages will be doled out to offset the added cost. Aside from pointing to upcoming fundraising efforts, the University has not gotten specific as to what this increased financial aid could look like. The University has an imperative to release a plan for how it is going to keep students who need financial help from having to pay more. As much financial stress as the University might be under due to inflation and the lingering effects of the pandemic, students have it far worse.
GW is a wealthy, established private university with many resources to offer. It is important that it continues to be affordable and accessible for as many people across the country, so that more people can benefit from the resources it has to offer. The Board of Trustees and administrators need to ensure that no matter what new policy they implement, like the now-obsolete 20/30 Plan, the new tuition hike or the need-aware financial aid policy, that they continue to make GW as accessible to students as possible. The tuition hike is for certain, but the ability to proportionally increase financial aid push might not be.
This isn’t the first time GW has planned to decrease accessibility for students. The 20/30 Plan was an effort to increase GW’s status as a STEM school by reducing overall undergraduate population by 20 percent, while increasing the proportion of students majoring in STEM subjects. One of the plan’s side effects was that it would make GW less accessible to all students at GW but especially for students who were looking to study humanities. This is an example of a history of making the University less accessible to prospective students.
GW has also had a history of not being candid about the admissions process. In 2013, they had claimed that they were need-blind, even though they were, and still are, need-aware. This means that instead of considering students solely on their merits, they take their financial status into consideration when accepting them. Because of this incident, if GW asks us to trust that their new tuition rates, and the subsequent increases in financial aid, will actually benefit the GW community overall, then they need to be more transparent about how this will happen.

Many students can relate to reading over a syllabus at the start of a semester to discover that class participation counts for up to 10 percent of their grade. Several professors whose classes I’ve taken have only a limited amount of participation for credit without understanding that this isn’t easily achievable for all people.
Professors at GW should expand their definition of participation to include emails, visiting office hours and asking questions after class. By doing so, it creates a safe environment for all students and recognizes that they come from different backgrounds and have varied strengths, capabilities and learning styles.
There are many reasons why students may not feel comfortable participating in class. Some are quiet learners who value listening more than figuring out what to say next. Others experience anxiety about presenting and fear judgment of their comments. Spontaneous discussions in class can be overwhelming for students, and some peers may have complicated relationships that could affect whether students are comfortable speaking. While being able to calmly speak up in class is an asset, that skill should not be favored over others such as critically processing or thinking about topics presented in class.
Social anxiety, a disorder where everyday social interactions cause irrational worrying, can lead to the avoidance of participation due to embarrassment, self-consciousness, sweating, stuttering or criticism, according to the National Social Anxiety Center. Some students suffer from social anxiety so strongly that they have to drop out of school.
About 7 percent of U.S. adults and 9 percent of adolescents suffer from social anxiety, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. This disorder is often underdiagnosed as well because some with Social Anxiety Disorder do not feel comfortable seeking help.
There is already an immense amount of stress put on college students to get good grades and choose a career path. Adjusting the definition of class participation has the potential to not only relieve some of that stress but also set students up for more success as they choose to participate in the ways most comfortable for them.
Addressing social anxiety in college students would also be beneficial for other emotional reasons. Those with social anxiety are more at risk for clinical depression and alcohol-use disorders, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. This is very prevalent in college students, so helping those with social anxiety will also help prevent other forms of mental illness.
Even if students do not specifically have social anxiety, 63 percent of college students in the United States have felt overwhelming anxiety, according to the American College Health Association. Professors should want to help reduce the levels of stress students experience by providing alternatives to speaking in class for participation credit.
To be more inclusive of students that do not thrive in a public speaking setting, professors should accept conversations held outside of the classroom as part of their participation grade. Whether it is the attendance of office hours, sending an email discussing the class lecture or asking questions privately, these actions all show a dedication to understanding material.
There is no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to learning, and class participation should be no exception. Research demonstrates that students are characterized by individual and unique learning styles, so to improve skills and promote success, curricula should be more flexible.
Understandably, professors cannot tailor their teaching methods to every specific need of their students. Offering students different choices to receive credit for participation is an attainable compromise. Professors do not need to change the way they lecture for students to email them questions about it or attend office hours to discuss the content to participate.
Expanding the definition of participation also promotes equality because class discussions are usually dominated by white men. Research from the University of California Berkeley found that most minority students feel like outsiders in the classroom and experience subtle forms of discrimination when white students take over a class discussion. This puts students of color at an academic disadvantage that should be diminished. Other research from the book “Gender and Conversational Interaction” shows that men statistically interrupt, introduce new topics and speak over others more. Since participation is part of students’ grades, they deserve equal opportunities to receive credit for it.
Professors should work toward dismantling the societal expectation that white men can dominate class discussions. Expanding the definition of class participation will give students a more equal opportunity to succeed in a course. Even if participation only counts as 5 percent of one’s grade, that is an impactful difference, and 10 percent is an entire letter grade – grades are important for future career success.
Learning should not be so narrowly defined. Just because participating in class does not work for some students does not mean they do not understand the material any less. Professors should provide a wide range of participation tools that can cater to all different learning styles to be more inclusive.

The massive crowd starting singing along as soon as the band began the first verse of its first song. 
Electric indie rock band The Backseat Lovers headlined at 9:30 Club Feb. 28 for a crowd brimming with enthusiasm, spilling out the doors and singing along to every lyric.
The young four-member band met while they were still in high school, and it was in their town of Salt Lake City, Utah where some of their early songs first gained popularity. But four years after their high school graduation, they came to D.C. with almost 4.3 million monthly listeners on Spotify and “Kilby Girl,” their TikTok viral song that’s racked up more than 115 million listens alone.
The four members of the funky soft-rock band Over Under opened the show with an hourlong performance showcasing their three released singles, “Yellow Roses,” “Backwards Forwards” and “Time to Waste.” The lead singer Taylor Gywnn brought an eccentric energy to the stage with mannerisms of Freddy Mercury and a hypnotizing delivery of the lyrics.
The Backseat Lovers came on close to 9:30 p.m. and kicked off their set with a three-and-a-half minute lyric-less jam session showcasing the clean and powerful electric guitar that defines that band’s sound. The crowd started to head bang and dance almost immediately and screamed with excitement when this wordless jam led effortlessly into their first song “Pool House.”
The massive crowd started singing along with the first verse, a feeling the band is probably getting used to after a sold out 2021 tour and gigs at big music festivals like Lollapalooza, Shaky Knees, Ohana Festival, Life is Beautiful and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
But lead singer and guitarist Joshua Harmon said it was at a 2019 gig in Vancouver, Canada where he realized the band had fans outside of Utah.
“People had flown from other places in the country to come see us, and I just remember the feeling in that tiny, cramped space, and everyone was actually singing back to us,” he said on the band’s biography page. “It was just a really humbling feeling to know that people actually cared about [our music] outside of our circle of community and friends.”
Harmon and lead guitarist Jonas Swanson cited a wide range of musicians that influence The Backseat Lovers’ robust and edgy indie sound ranging from folk and country stars like Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash and Tom Russell to rock giants like Weezer, Radiohead and Cage the Elephant.
Following “Pool House,” The Backseat Lovers played a 13-song set that left the audience reeling for more. The setlist included two unreleased songs, “Growing, Dying” and “Know Your Name.” And the band only departed from their setlist once to play an audience-requested song, “Davey Crochet,” from their 2019 album “When We Were Friends.”
After a brief huddle amid a “Davey Crochet” chant by the crowd, Harmon admitted they hadn’t played this song in a while and might “mess up.”
The fast-paced tempo and sublimely layered rhythm of the guitar, bass and drums disguised any hiccups they may have had and made this my favorite song of the night. The audience was head banging and blissfully chanting along to Harmon’s full-bodied performance of the angsty yet lightheartedly romantic lyrics:
“I guess there’s some things that you shouldn’t know, but I’ll tell you anyway,” the lyrics say. “And you can tell me ’bout it if you’ve had a bad day. I’ll teach you how to laugh if you can teach me crochet.”
Halfway through the set, the band performed their first release “Out of Tune,” a five-minute single with the catchy chorus, “We were just a couple posers with guitars that were always out of tune.”
While Harmon’s raspy and emotionally raw voice remained constant, the electric guitar in this song seemed to hold a lighter background than in their newer songs, with more sporadic yet stylized solos throughout. The song also alludes to the origin story of The Backseat Lovers with a lyric in the third verse:
“Started a band without a drummer or a mic,” the lyrics say. “Got a show within a week that I thought would be the show to change my life.”
Harmon played in multiple bands throughout high school but “nothing stuck,” according to the band’s online biography. But during his senior year, he started writing songs independently and soon, one-by-one tacked on his three bandmates – Swanson, drummer Juice Welch and bass player and background vocalist KJ Ward.
“I had this little collection of songs that I had never tried to put a band arrangement behind,” Harmon said in an interview.
There was a collective gasp from the crowd when the band said they only had two more songs to play – “Maple Syrup” from “When We Were Friends” and “Still a Friend” from their EP “Elevator Days.”
As soon as the band left the stage, the audience started desperately chanting “one more song.”
“Still a Friend,” while equally engaging as the rest of their set, didn’t feel like the right song to end the concert on since it’s one of their lesser known tracks. So I joined the crowd in excitement when the band came out again to play “Sinking Ship” from “When We Were Friends,” as an encore.

Andrea Ho has been a member of the team for five years, starting with the 2017-18 season.
After a highly successful season for both squads, men’s and women’s swimming and diving will have to say goodbye to the mainstay members of the team.
Senior DH Hwang, along with graduate student Andrea Ho, swam for the men’s and women’s teams, respectively, over the past four years, ending their final season with the team this year. Both are members of teams that have established a standard of success, winning both the men’s and women’s conference titles in 2022.
“I’ll just say well done,” Hwang said. “I’m proud of every single person on this team. I’m proud of what they’ve done, the work they’ve put in, and I’m just happy to see what they do in the future.”
Ho, a business analytics masters candidate from Perth, Australia, has been with the team for five years, beginning in the 2017-18 season. Securing her first Atlantic 10 gold during the 2019-20 season, Ho went on to establish herself as a leader of the team, with which she won the first two A-10 titles in program history.
“My favorite moment was sweeping the men’s and women’s because that was the perfect way to cap off a career,” Ho said.
She said she was happy to see the progression of the team throughout her five years, how they became closer and improved each year.
A mechanical engineering major from Honolulu, Hawaii, Hwang said he was relieved the season was over and he could end his career on a high note.
“I’m sure I don’t speak for everyone when I say this, but I’ve been doing this sport for 13, 14 years now,” Hwang said. “And to be able to finish it off with an achievement like that, it was relieving that I could go off on such a good note.”
Hwang was part of a largely dominant men’s team, which captured three A-10 championships in his four years with the program and has won the A-10 title five times out of the last six years.
Head Coach Brian Thomas said he was proud of Hwang’s work ethic, consistency and dedication to the team despite his busy schedule as a mechanical engineering major.
“This past summer DH would basically get on the Metro with his bike to Sterling, hop off the Metro, ride eight miles to work and then back at night,” Thomas said. “And then coming in and basically putting himself in a position as a senior to get best times, to have a huge impact at the conference level is something I’m really proud of with him.”
Thomas said Ho will also leave behind a strong legacy that has “nothing to do with swimming.”
“The way her team and teammates feel about her is hard to match,” Thomas said. “You just don’t see it all that often. We kind of consider her a little bit of the team mom, if that makes sense. She’s just super mature – someone that’ll be honest with you when you need it.”
Thomas said he recognized the dedication of the two athletes during the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a months-long postponement of activities.
Nevertheless, Hwang and Ho stuck with the team. Thomas said he was impressed with Ho’s commitment to improvement especially, setting a career best time in the 200 backstroke.
“Senior year coming off of COVID, almost no one in the country was doing that coming off of a six-month layoff,” Thomas said.
Both students said it was a bittersweet moment to end their careers as they will now have to navigate life without a team behind them.
“The community is definitely what I’m going to miss,” Hwang said. “Obviously getting into a job environment, you’re not enjoying, I’d say, the social aspects of being with people as much as I did with swimming.”
Ho said even the recent end to the swimming season already has her missing the team.
“Going off of that, it’s been, what, a week and a half?” Ho said. “And yeah, I just feel so disconnected now, cause I don’t see everyone everyday.”
Beyond GW, Hwang and Ho have differing plans for the future. Hwang said he has accepted a job offer in San Jose, California to be closer to his family, while Ho plans to stay in the District after she finishes her graduate studies in December.
Thomas said he hopes Hwang still finds a way to keep some sort of athletic routine in his life, maybe even with triathlons or surfing, whatever keeps him happy despite the distractions of a career.
“I love that kid, man,” Thomas said. “I love him, like just his spirit, his consistency. He just wants to come in and have a good time. And I want to make sure he hangs on to that. I also want to make sure he finds something to fill the void that swimming will leave.”

Chris DeFelice, the owner and operator of Dirty Water, said he was not a big supporter of the vaccine and mask mandates originally. 
In the short time since the District’s indoor mask and vaccine mandates have been lifted, local bar and nightclub owners said they’ve seen an uptick in patrons.
Businesses in the D.C. nightlife scene have felt the toll of government shutdowns, social distancing requirements and indoor mask and vaccine mandates since the pandemic began. Mayor Muriel Bowser lifted the vaccine mandate last month and removed the citywide mask mandate last week, moves that local business owners said came at the right time to safely bring their locations back to normalcy.
Lindsay Taylor, the sales and event coordinator at The Crown and Crow, a 19th-century pub-inspired bar in Logan Circle, said with new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a changing local attitude about pandemic precautions, she feels comfortable with these city-wide changes and confident customers will as well.
“We’re hearing from the CDC and we’re hearing from the cities and we’re seeing across the country what people are doing,” Taylor said. “I think that taking the temperature of all that, the spirit of the overall business, perhaps including all the staff and certainly myself, is one of optimism.”
D.C.’s daily COVID-19 case rate stood at 10.4 per 100,000 residents as of Feb. 28, according to DC Health data.
As the pandemic has simmered on, Taylor said the bar has had to become used to the rapidly changing guidelines for COVID-19 safety, relying on a flexible mindset throughout the past two years while also citing the importance of staying informed as a small business that caters to nightlife in particular.
“We have rolled with the punches knowing that these mandates and changes have gone into place somewhat last minute and lifted,” she said. “With that in mind, we were ready to turn on a dime no matter what.”
When the announcement came last month that the indoor vaccine check and mask mandate would be lifted, Taylor said The Crown and Crow didn’t feel blindsided.
“As far as making preparations for removing mandates, we certainly felt that we were given enough time to consider operational challenges,” Taylor said.
Before an official indoor vaccine mandate was announced in December, The Crown and Crow was among a handful of bars requiring customer vaccine checks as a precautionary public safety measure.
“It felt, at the time, like an easy decision for us to make,” Taylor said. “We considered the fact that there may be some naysayers to our policy, but taking the temperature of our general community, we felt that putting that in place was something that was going to give people confidence to come to our venue and we believe that was the case.”
Taylor said throughout the pandemic, the bar has been making decisions with the safety of their community in mind, but with changing public attitudes and new guidance it feels like time to move on.
“We’ve walked the tightrope of doing what’s right, offering a safe community space, for people to come in and feel confident and reassured during the pandemic,” she said. “We’ve done what we’ve supposed to do and now, that’s kind of subsiding.”
Just as they weighed multiple factors like employee safety and CDC guidance in that decision, Taylor said they have done so with deciding not to continue these practices following the mandate lifts.
“We all have this need, and I think want, to get back to some sort of normalcy in the pandemic,” she said. “But we want to make sure that those decisions are made when the time is right, and we believe in the confidence of the information provided, that it was the right time for us to also move in that direction.”
Chris DeFelice – the owner and operator of Dirty Water, a dive bar in the H Street Corridor – said he wasn’t a huge fan of the mandates and when it came to knowing if his employees were vaccinated, he would “stay out of their business.”
“I didn’t love the fact that it was put on,” DeFelice said, referring to the vaccine mandate. “It didn’t seem to make a lot of sense at the time. But I kind of saw it coming. And it really didn’t change business for us at all.”
DeFelice said while he had a feeling when the mandates were instituted that they would be short-lived, he didn’t face consistent issues with customer compliance.
“My door guys didn’t even have to like prod people to show their cards,” he said. “People just show them. Pull them out.”
Reflecting on the changing nightlife scene throughout the pandemic, DeFelice said he was grateful having survived for so long while seeing firsthand small businesses around him close down, unable to face the burden of the global pandemic and the resulting financial hardships.
“We’re blessed that we were able to survive this whole thing, keeping our business open,” DeFellice said. “But I equally empathize with those that were unable. Really just seeing sort of the attack on small business the last two years, it’s just been really, it’s been very frustrating.”

When I was child, I used to be afraid of printers and would have a panic attack whenever my parents would print out documents for work. A week ago, I experienced a wholly different sense of unease as I stood in front of one of the printing kiosks in Gelman Library and watched $16 drain from my WEPA balance for a single class.
My professor required that I print 22 copies of a short story that I could have easily emailed to every person in the class and that they could have referred to on computers. Even printing the pages double-sided, I still managed to rack up 143 pages that did not have to be wasted. I currently have $0.20 left of my WEPA balance, and by the time this article is published I will have run out due to several classes that I have taken this year in which computers are not permitted.
This experience is indicative of a broader problem facing students taking classes in the wake of a pandemic that shut down campus last year – professors who refuse to bring their teaching styles into the 21st century. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, professors have had to significantly alter their teaching styles to include online options for their students. For many professors that has meant modernizing the set-up of their classrooms for a hybrid environment so students in person and online can get an equivalent experience. But there have been some holdouts who refuse to fully accept the digital age into their classroom, banning students from using their laptops. It no longer makes sense for professors to prohibit students from using technology in the classroom and the University’s policy should be altered to reflect this transition.
Jenna Baer | Cartoonist
Professors’ enforcement of technology bans vary, but it frequently means students are not allowed to use their personal computers and often requires that students print out pages upon pages of readings and assignments. The professors I have had who do not allow technology usage during class claim it prevents students from getting distracted and that computers create walls rather than conversation. In a COVID-19 world, these fears have been rendered moot as students infected with COVID-19 must join class using computers to be included in lectures and discussions.
Without a near end in sight to our reliance on technology, computers will remain a staple in University classrooms and professors all must shift into this Zoom era. Banning in-person students from using their computers becomes pointless once they can see, or at least hear, their classmates joining discussions from Zoom. Last semester, I had a professor who had a live Zoom link available during our in-person classes and encouraged us to join from our laptops so we could see the questions and comments of students who could not attend the lecture. Although those students were in quarantine, they were not isolated from the conversations we were having in class and in-person students were able to respond to them. Allowing students to use their computers during class does not lead to walls, it ensures that students who have COVID-19 are able to join the conversation.
Another issue with professors banning students from using their computers during class is the cost of printing assignments and readings that could be easily referenced from a computer. Given that laptops already cost students thousands of dollars, we should be able to use them to the fullest extent possible, including during class.
GW granted students a credit of $30 to print using the WEPA printing kiosks around campus in 2019 as part of a broader effort to improve the affordability of on-campus living. GW Information Technology estimates that the $30 credit covers about 427 pages a year per student, taking into account double sided and color printing. If students do not use their entire balance, it does not roll over to the next academic year. This credit is ultimately a finite resource and should be treated as a final resort because once students burn through it, they are forced to start spending their GWorld on printing instead of food. As we are still in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and professors continue to rely heavily on computers, students should not be expected to print out all of their assignments. If professors were to allow students to submit assignments via email or Blackboard, students would not have to dip into their GWorld balances.
Students would not be the only ones to benefit from a policy that encourages a reliance on Blackboard as opposed to printing assignments out. GW has made sustainability a greater priority in recent years by pledging to eliminate single-use plastics and divesting its endowment from fossil fuels. Committing to a University-wide policy against professors requiring their students to print would just be another step in the eco-friendly path GW’s headed down.
Students have the ability to report courses that require excessive printing, but this solution does not address the problem at its root. Students should not have to police their professors after their WEPA balance has already been drained. GW must institute a policy that professors not require students to print out all of their assignments and step into the 21st century, in which computers are an essential element in classrooms.

GW started to lose some momentum to American toward the end of the first quarter, but the Colonials never trailed as they captured their first win of the season. 
Lacrosse recorded their first win of the season in their first home game of the year over American Tuesday afternoon.
The Colonials (1-3) never trailed and came out 11-9 victors over the Eagles (2-3) behind a hat trick from junior midfielder Amber Germer and two goals each from freshman midfielder Emily Mowbray and senior attacker Sophia Watkinson. The Colonials led 2-0 eight minutes into the game thanks to goals from Germer and senior midfielder Tori Hampton.
GW came out of the gates firing on all cylinders in their first game in front of their home fans since March 4, 2020.
Germer opened the scoring 2:18 into the game off a feed from senior attacker Maddy O’Brien after sustained possession in the offensive zone. Hampton slotted one into the bottom corner six minutes later, forcing American to take a timeout.
The Eagles held their own for the rest of the first quarter and started to flip the momentum towards the end of the quarter. This culminated in a goal from graduate student attacker Emma Vinall off a free-position shot 29 seconds before the horn to cut the deficit in half.
Watkinson picked up her first goal of the afternoon with 10:29 remaining in the second quarter off a free position shot following sustained GW possession. This slowed the American run, but the Eagles soon responded. Graduate student midfielder Kendall Goldblum blew past her defender twice in the span of a minute on nearly identical moves to tie the game at 3-3.
GW once again pulled ahead on an aggressive Mowbray drive into the heart of the defense and shot into the top corner with 2:50 left in the first half. But American wouldn’t let the Colonials pull away and responded less than a minute later with a wrap-around finish from freshman attacker Maddy Spratt off a pass from senior midfielder Hali Sibilia.
The end of the second quarter saw a team benefit from a free-position shot in the waning seconds of play. This time it was Germer who took advantage of the free position for GW, giving them a 5-4 halftime lead.
The Colonials finished the half with a 10-to-six advantage in ground balls and a 6-5 advantage in draw controls. Throughout the first half and the rest of the game, Hampton showed off her speed and athleticism. The senior captain excelled bringing the ball from one zone to the next, allowing the Colonials to transition from offense to defense.
O’Brien opened the scoring just under three minutes into the second half on a pass from senior midfielder Kendall Lambert to give GW a 6-4 lead. But less than a minute later, Goldblum cut the Colonials lead to 6-5 on a nearly identical goal to her previous two to give her a hat trick on the day.
After GW went man-up, Germer was able to convert off a feed from Mowbray with 9:46 left in the quarter to give the Colonials a two-goal cushion once again. The momentum continued to swing toward GW as the Eagles got a green card for “too many men on the field.”
But AU sophomore goalie Mary Alice Collins came up with a big stop on Lambert to stem the GW run. Watkinson eventually broke through and put one past Collins to give GW an 8-5 lead, their biggest lead of the day.
Although the Eagles did what they’d done all day and quickly responded to bring the lead back down to two off a goal from senior midfielder Stefanie Walsh while the team was man-up.
American finished the quarter strong with two quick goals in the final 26 seconds. Vinall scored the first while the second was from junior attacker Emma Hare.
Both goals came in a similar fashion, off a feed from Spratt from the X. Going into the final quarter, the score was knotted at 8.
Both teams struggled offensively at the beginning of the fourth quarter, but GW did well to turn the Eagles over and not allow them to get a rhythm going. GW was knocking on the door for a few minutes before Mowbray finally scored from a free position shot with 8:49 remaining to make it 9-8.
Although American had a few chances to tie things up, the GW defense held strong. With 4:11 left, senior midfielder Alana Greene gave GW some breathing room after she cut to the goal, received a pass from Hampton and put the chance away.
But 12 seconds later, Spratt made it 10-9 off a feed from Vinall on the fast break. But following a GW timeout with 2:42 left, American opted to leave the net empty so they could play more aggressive defense and turn GW over.
Lambert was able to put a chance away after receiving a pass from Mowbray, putting the Colonials back up 11-9, which is how it would stay.
Freshman goalie Mia Caro came up big multiple times for the Colonials and finished with eight saves in her first career game.
GW will continue their short home stand on Monday when they take on Gardner Webb at 3 p.m. before heading to Georgetown the following Saturday.

The effort comes as officials push a focused, University-wide fundraising effort to support Pell Grant-eligible students. 
The Elliott School of International Affairs introduced a new scholarship fund last month to help students access unpaid internships and study abroad opportunities for students from historically underrepresented groups.
The Elliott Equity Fund offers tuition and nontuition awards meant to provide students from low-income backgrounds and minority communities with better access to programs in the Elliott School. Dean Alyssa Ayres said officials will distribute the fund to alleviate tuition costs and financially support students participating in unpaid internships and study abroad programs in hopes of enhancing diversity, equity and inclusion.
“We want to raise more support for scholarships and fellowships, as well as non-tuition support for transformative experiences such as internships or study abroad that may not be possible without assistance,” Ayres said in an email last month. “For this reason we have just created the Elliott Equity Fund, which is a philanthropic priority for our school.”
Officials did not return a request for comment about how much money students can receive from the fund, how many students may receive awards and how much funding the initiative has raised.
Ayres, Senior Assistant Dean of Student Services and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Jonathan Walker and members of the Elliott School’s Council on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, which is composed of faculty, students and staff, collaborated throughout the past year to create the fund. Undergraduate and graduate students are eligible to apply for the fund, according to a University release.
About 54 percent of Elliott School students identify as white, about 13 percent identify as Hispanic, about 11 percent identify as Asian and about 5 percent identify as Black, according to institutional data. The school’s proportion of Black students is less than half of the University-wide percentage of Black students, which is 10.7 percent.
Officials announced in October they would launch a “focused initiative” to make GW more affordable to Pell-grant recipients with plans to allocate roughly $2 million next year for need-based grants, loans and Federal Work Study packages.
Jennifer Brinkerhoff – a professor of international affairs, international business, public policy and public administration and a member of the school’s diversity, equity and inclusion council – said donors will contribute money to the fund, and a committee of officials will review applications to determine each student’s award. She said officials designed the initiative to be “flexible” with funds, so they can designate money to address students with the highest financial need.
“Certainly it can support students who have needs at the time of admission,” she said. “It can also support students in need when they are encountering difficulties once they’re already students. And that might be for tuition support, but it also might be for living expenses.”
Brinkerhoff said the fund’s emphasis on diversity, equity and inclusion will prepare students to work in a “world of diversity,” where they will be exposed to a variety of cultures in their future careers in international affairs. She said the fund will help students overcome financial constraints that come along with attending an expensive school like GW, allowing historically underrepresented students to better access the University.
The University announced last week that the estimated cost of attendance will surpass $80,000 during the next academic year for most undergraduates. Officials said undergraduates who do not qualify for fixed tuition will pay a 3.9 percent tuition bump to more than $60,000 a year.
“A huge constraint to that is that we are an expensive school,” Brinkerhoff said. “And that makes it very difficult for people from diverse backgrounds, and that’s true also of first-generation students.”
More than half a dozen students said the Elliott School’s fund would increase accessibility for marginalized students and assist them in finding unpaid internships and studying abroad.
Josh Blaustein, a freshman majoring in international affairs, said the lack of professional experience among freshmen makes it difficult to find paid internships, and the fund will provide unpaid interns with an alternate form of cash flow. He said the fund will also help students find jobs they are more passionate about like internships in congressional offices and at nonprofit organizations.
“Maybe if they were being paid by the school as opposed to their employer, they can do things that they were actually passionate about and learn more about themselves,” Blaustein said. “And I think that’s what education is all about.”
Kyle Lim, a sophomore majoring in international affairs, said students from wealthier backgrounds have the best chance to live in D.C. while lower-income students need paid positions to live in the District over the summer.
“It will also kind of improve the diversity of the overall IA world that now you’re going to have people who are from much more diverse backgrounds,” Lim said. “And that’s going to be great because there’s a major diversity problem in the government and in IA, so hopefully this is going to help.”
13 percent of the U.S. State Department’s Senior Executive Service are people of color, and only 3 percent of the Senior Foreign Service identify as Black, according to POLITICO.
Sophie Rice, a freshman studying international affairs, said the number of paid internships are limited in international affairs organizations, like policy think tanks, turning Elliott School students to unpaid work. She said the fund makes unpaid positions more appealing because it would allow her to earn income while gaining new work experience.
“For international affairs, especially because most of the jobs here and the opportunities are through the government, they’re unpaid, so the ability to work for it or make money while you’re doing it would definitely be greatly appreciated,” Rice said.
