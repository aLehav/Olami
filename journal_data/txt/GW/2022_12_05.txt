From GW-themed affirmations like “‘Foggy Bottom’ is not an embarrassing name” and “I do not go to school with future war criminals” to stories about where to get “free stuff” on campus and the latest Student Association drama, the @gwuaffirmations Instagram account had a grip on me before I even applied to college last December. And judging by the thousands of people who follow @gwuaffirmations and other student-run accounts about GW, these personal yet glamorously popular forums can have an intoxicating effect on
Social media is an easy, quick and detached way to socialize in what can otherwise feel like a disconnected student body, and @gwuaffirmations’ blend of anonymous, quirky humor with an insider student perspective is an indispensable form of connection between students. These unnamed peers turned content creators deliver frequent takes on campus drama, post ironic memes about student life and seek advice about professors and classes. Dozens of these community-centric accounts exist within student social media circles – @gwubirds, @gwurats and @gwucats post pictures of cute animals on campus, and others like @gwstudent37 and @pitbullatgw post satirical made-up roommate stories and edited photos of Pitbull around Foggy Bottom, respectively.
But there’s a dark side to these anonymous accounts. @gwu.shaderoom, which emerged at the start of this semester, posts unfiltered anonymous screenshots of submissions to a Google Form that poses rotating prompts like “what’s on your mind?” and “anonymously spill the tea.” The posts range from silly – “who brought their toddler to pelham brunch” – to crude – “Madison 7th floor boys are virgins.” And of course, my personal favorite – “yo everyone on the hatchet is either the chillest person ever or totally bat **** crazy.”
The more you scroll through @gwu.shaderoom, the more racist, homophobic and misogynistic their posts become, as does the comments section. A horrific number of the posts include bigoted and or sexual remarks like the ones above, directly referring to other students by name and residence hall. The account proves that this type of content is popular – in just three short months, it’s garnered more than 2,200 followers.
As a woman, the personal and sexual comments on the account make me uncomfortable on campus. Any stranger on the street could be the one behind the post. The anonymous aspect of these posts don’t facilitate discussion about sensitive topics. It simply encourages hate and creates an unsafe campus for marginalized students.
These posts also have real consequences. Last spring, then-Student Association Vice President Kate Carpenter backed out of her race for SA president in part because of intense cyberbullying on the anonymous social media app “Jeti.” @gwu.shaderoom proves that that incident wasn’t isolated – accounts with no other purpose except to stimulate drama and controversy are popular.
It has become second nature to vent our frustrations through online spaces without regard for how doing so can hurt others – overexposure to social media content during the COVID-19 pandemic has blurred our sense of morality online. When those interactions evolve from frustration into targeted hate, and the nature of anonymity removes accountability, the result is distrust and hostility between students. It’s no fun anymore when we’re afraid to even laugh too loudly in public for fear of a nasty @gwu.shaderoom post referring to us by name.
Rather than wait for officials to step in and discipline students for individual reports of harassment, we must change our own behavior, hold ourselves accountable and think critically about how we engage with social media. Officials’ decision to discipline individual account owners wouldn’t keep students from posting and interacting with hateful content in the first place, and many GW-related social media accounts create space for students to interact in ways officials simply can’t – and shouldn’t – control. Change must come from students, not officials’ list of rules and regulations.
Both account administrators and their followers need to exercise personal responsibility. An innate part of the value of these accounts is their ability to gather the honest opinions of students. But constructive honesty about campus culture – professors, teachers, opinions on campus issues – is not the same as cruelty targeting people based on their identities.
Our generation has enough knowledge about social media algorithms to understand the power of our every online interaction. Understanding what we’re seeking to get out of our time on social media can help guide how we engage with these accounts. When we think about our interactions on social media as part of the greater context they’re contributing to and really examine the messages we’re spreading, it’s easier to recognize that what seemed like a lighthearted post was actually a sign of a much bigger problem. All that’s required for a shift in behavior is that we hold ourselves and our social circles accountable for not spreading hate – unfollow accounts you no longer agree with, or call out hateful posts when you see them.
Positive social media engagement at GW is more than possible. Allowing @gwu.shaderoom to dismantle the entire web of good-natured accounts into an anarchic cesspool for hate is a disservice to our community.
Those who run these accounts and those who follow them have a responsibility to use online anonymity for good, not to abuse the privileges afforded to us by living in a digital age. Students can and should choose to continue to create community and advance positivity rather than tear it down with a tap of a screen.

A group of artists founded Transformer in 2002 to connect and showcase the work of the District’s emerging marginalized artists, establishing their exhibition space in Logan Circle.
Corcoran School of the Arts and Design faculty and alumni participated in an exhibition that opened last month celebrating the 20th anniversary of Transformer – a D.C. nonprofit that showcases contemporary visual art.
The Transformer20 exhibition, which is on display from Nov. 11 to Dec. 10 in the Corcoran Flagg Building’s atrium, features more than 100 works of art, like paintings, photographs and videos from more than 25 Corcoran faculty and alumni. Victoria Reis, the co-founder of Transformer, and Georgie Payne, a former Transformer staff member, curated the exhibition, which also includes a 20-year timeline of organization history and display cases filled with relics of past events, performances and exhibitions.
A group of artists founded Transformer in 2002 to connect and showcase the work of the District’s emerging marginalized artists, establishing their exhibition space in Logan Circle. The Transformer20 exhibition included the nonprofit’s annual auction, which took place Nov. 10 to raise money to “support current and future generations of artists,” as proceeds were split evenly between Transformer20 artists and the nonprofit.
Reis, the executive and artistic director of Transformer, said she designed the exhibition to showcase the accomplishments of the organization and its artists of historically marginalized backgrounds, including females, members of the LGBTQ+ community and people of color.
“My goal with this is one to celebrate all of the artists and collaborations and programming that we’ve achieved over 20 years and to also hopefully engage more people in our work and have them see both the archival documentation that we’re sharing as well as artwork from 100 different artists that have been part of our program,” Reis said.
She said Transformer has fostered a partnership with Corcoran over the past 20 years, as it has showcased the work of many Corcoran students and alums since its inception in 2002.
“It was really incredible to have an opportunity to share that within an exhibition format, and to do it here at the Corcoran – an organization and institution that we have been a longtime collaborator with and who we have featured so many alumni and students from in our program, who really in many ways have helped define our aesthetic,” she said.
Reis said she started her career at the National Association of Artists’ Organization – an organization based in D.C. that worked with and created initiatives in support of artists and art nonprofits before it was dissolved in the early 2000s. She said she soon noticed a lack of organizations aimed at providing opportunities for emerging artists in the D.C. area, inspiring her to develop Transformer through her connections to people in the D.C. visual arts and punk music scene.
“There was a big network of community for emerging musicians and bands, and I thought there really needs to be something like this for emerging visual artists,” she said.
Chandi Kelley, a Corcoran alumna and territorial assistant and coordinator of contemporary art initiatives at The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, said she has contributed work, like her archival pigment prints, for Transformer’s annual auction for many years. She said she has made “informative” peer connections to other artists affiliated with Transformer, like her ongoing partnership with Marissa Long – another Corcoran alumna and artist featured in the exhibition.
“Transformer paired me with Marissa Long for our two-person exhibition that we did,” Kelley said. “Over the years, it’s fostered more partnerships between the two of us and more collaborations, and her work influences me a great deal. We often share our work with each other and get feedback.”
Kelley said Transformer often serves as a place for Corcoran students to showcase their work once they graduate and as they pursue their careers in the arts.
“It’s really been a steady force I think for a lot of Corcoran graduates as a place that has facilitated a lot of growth once you graduate from the programs, there’s a system that facilitates growth as you emerge as an artist,” Kelley said.
Hatnim Lee, a Corcoran alumna, photographer and multiyear veteran of Transformer auctions, said she first submitted a photograph in 2009. She said she has contributed a new photography piece to the auction every year since, including the photograph she submitted this year, which depicts a woman dressed as the Union Jack flag attending Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral.
“Transformer is one of those places that really gave people an opportunity,” Lee said. “I had my first solo exhibition there. So I’ve always been supportive of what Victoria does, and I guess it’s just become a tradition for me.” Lee said.
Cynthia Connolly, a Corcoran alumna and photographer, said she benefits from Transformer’s support even as a more established artist because it offers a reliable D.C. gallery to return to that encourages artists to create unique works of art.
“They provide this opportunity to create different things that you wouldn’t necessarily create on your own or think about whether you would be able to sell them or edit them,” Connolly said. “In that respect, they sort of think along the same lines as I do.”
Molly Springfield, a former Corcoran adjunct professor and artist, said gaining the opportunity to showcase her work in a solo show at Transformer in 2006 was a “big deal” as she started her career as a young artist. She said she encourages her students to attend exhibits and learn about the career opportunities offered at D.C. art institutions, like Transformer.
“I definitely try to tell students about the broader art world within D.C. and encourage them to go to places like Transformer,” she said. “I’ve taken students on field trips to Transformer, so that was definitely part of my teaching experience, exposing students to the kinds of things that would be available to them after they graduate.”

Students who have taken the Silver Line to Dulles International Airport said the extension has saved students up to $70 and $80 in rideshare costs.

After eight years of construction, students said the Metro’s newly extended Silver Line has made travel to Dulles International Airport more affordable during the holiday season despite a longer commute to the airport.
The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority opened the six-station Silver Line extension last month with rail access to Dulles International Airport, the primary international airport in the D.C. area., for the first time in Metro’s 46-year history. Ten students said the extension has opened more affordable avenues to fly out of Dulles after transporting to the airport through alternative and costly transportation methods, like shuttles and rideshares, in previous years.
“The completion of the Silver Line means a better, greener, more affordable way to get to work, school, shopping, entertainment and events as well as easy access to Washington Dulles International Airport, a gateway to the world,” WMATA General Manager and CEO Randy Clarke said at the extension’s opening ceremony in November.
The first phase of the Silver Line, with six new stations, opened in Fairfax County, Virginia in 2014 after officials began construction in 2007. The second phase – which includes three more stops in Fairfax County and Metro’s first three stops in Loudoun County, including Dulles – began construction shortly after in 2014, but delays pushed back the opening date of the second phase from 2018 to 2022.
Before the Silver Line reached Dulles, riders could take the Metro line to Whiele-Reston East station and ride the Silver Line Express Bus the final leg to the airport for a $5 fare.
Students who have taken the Silver Line to the airport said the extension has saved them between $70 to $80 in transportation spending.
Netra Ranganathan, a junior majoring in public health who lives in Dubai, said she travels to Dulles for international flights because they’re not offered at the closer Reagan National Airport, which is connected to the Blue and Yellow lines and serves near-exclusively domestic flights in Arlington. She said the extension to Dulles was “really convenient” for her flight to London for Thanksgiving break because getting to the airport was free and easy to navigate.
“It was a straight shot, so it wasn’t a hassle, and the station is really nice,” Ranganathan said. “There’s a lot of signs and everything to follow that make it really easy to get to the terminal once you get there.”
Danielle Davenport, a freshman double majoring in political science and economics, said while her trip to Dulles to fly back to Newark for Thanksgiving break was “convenient” because of the free Metro service, the commute to the airport lasted about an hour – roughly 30 minutes more than a rideshare trip.
“I’ve never taken the Metro to Reagan before, but I would imagine I would prefer to take the Metro to Reagan just because of the significant reduction in travel time compared to Dulles,” Davenport said.
Dani Trevino, a freshman studying international affairs, said she will travel out of Dulles for winter break because the airport offers cheaper, direct flights to her in Colorado. Trevino said she will take the Silver Line to the airport because it is “way cheaper” than taking an Uber or Lyft, which has an average route cost of $59 according to Uber’s website.
Freshman Owen Fields, who flew home to Colorado from Dulles for Thanksgiving, said he enjoyed the trip to the airport because the stations are new and the service was free. But he said he had to take a Lyft back to GW for about $80 when he returned to D.C. after midnight, when Metro closes for the night Monday through Thursday.
“Unfortunately, when I returned to Dulles on my return trip, there was no longer service past 12,” Fields said. “So, I once again had to fall on the sword and Lyft back home.”
Stella Weiss, a freshman studying international business, said she chose to take an Uber to Dulles instead of the new Metro line because the 25-minute car ride was most convenient for her to make her 10 p.m. flight amid the Thanksgiving travel rush. Weiss said she plans to take the Silver Line to Dulles instead of an Uber in the future because of the ride costs.
“I’m still learning transportation,” Weiss said. “With having that time where you have to be at the airport by, I would be nervous and probably leave extra early and make sure I’m at the right place.”
Casey Robarts, a senior studying biology, said he flew home to Boston out of Dulles for Thanksgiving break so he could try out the new Metro extension. He said the ride to Dulles on the Silver Line offered a “scenic” view through Virginia.
“At one point, you’re in the middle of a highway, and that was really cool,” Robarts said. “Then you come up from that, you go up onto a big, elevated section, and you’re looking out at the weird mix of suburbs and city.”
Freshman Addy Dunbar, whose flight back to D.C. from New York was rerouted to Dulles from Reagan due to fog, said the Silver Line was a “lifesaver” because she did not have to pay for a bus or rideshare back to campus. Dunbar said she can now bypass the $5 express bus and take the extension directly to Dulles instead where she will now book trips because of the easier access and more affordable flights.
“Now that Metro lines go to both, I can get whatever ticket I want, which is lovely,” Dunba said.

The Colonials previously beat Johns Hopkins 23-8 and 16-11, but the conference championship was the first time they fell to Bucknell University this season after beating them Oct. 1 with 11-8 and a narrow win against them Oct. 8 with 12-11 that earned them bronze in the championship.
The Colonials lost to Bucknell 5-7 in the semifinal on Nov. 19 after facing a mostly scoreless third quarter that gave Bison the 3-point lead they needed to ensure the win, but held onto their No. 20 rank in the Mid-Atlantic Water Polo Conference’s regular season that ended on Nov. 5.
The team also had a 15-game winning streak, which they previously achieved in 2019 after averaging 449 goals overall with a .489 attacking percentage that led them to dominate their opponents. Graduate student center Theodoros Pateros said the regular season’s winning streak contributed to good morale and efforts through the season that continued to push players in the pool and feel as if they were creating a legacy for their season.
“I think our biggest achievement as a team was that 15-game winning streak that we had, in a sense, wrote history for the program,” Pateros said in an interview Friday. “We did something that has never been done before, so I think that 15-game winning streak is far more important than any other individual records or awards that I might have received.”
The Colonials previously beat Johns Hopkins 23-8 and 16-11, but the conference championship was the first time they fell to Bucknell University this season after beating them 11-8 Oct. 1 and a narrow 12-11 win against them Oct. 8 that earned them bronze in the championship.
Pateros said championship play is more difficult than the regular season since the stakes are higher and the team is forced to rely on group skill rather than individual talent since championship play requires a more complex degree of play. He said Bucknell scouted GW’s offensive skills and were able to adjust to the Colonials’ playing style for the championship.
“With the championship, the games are a lot different from the full season,” Pateros said. “We had games that were tougher against Bucknell, especially. Overall, it doesn’t come down to individual performance. It’s a matter of like, how well the team is going to perform as a whole.”
Pateros was named to the MAWPC first team and junior goalie Luca Castorina and utility player and graduate student Nick Schroeder were named to the MAWPC second team last month. Castorina’s save percentage through the season averaged a .505 percent and contributed with 26 assists, compared to Bucknell’s Adrien Touzot with a save percentage of .541 percent. Schroeder collected 55 assists through the season, the highest among his teammates, alongside 50 goals this season.
Pateros was named to the MAWPC first team after leading the team with 120 goals throughout the season. He held 51 exclusions or penalties drawn and the highest shot percentage of .566 percent in the team.
“There’s a handful of players that get to be on the first team so to be recognized by the other coaches, it means a lot,” Pateros said. “I’ve been working hard for the past few years to be able to be in a position when I can receive an award and help my team as much as I can, so it’s nice to see that your efforts are rewarded.”
Pateros who was also named to the Cutino Award Watch List, an award that recognizes the best player in men’s and women’s water polo, also said he is looking forward to underclassmen like Castorian to step up to fill the roles of the three departing team members and for rising seniors to lead the team and mentor a younger squad for the next season.
“It’s going to be very interesting because our team had a lot of seniors and graduate students that are departing this team,” Pateros said. “So it’s going to be a very big opportunity for all those younger players to come in and show what they can bring to the team, and I have confidence in them. I think they’re going to do great.”
Junior center Viktor Jovanovic, who contributed with 42 goals this season and drew 23 exclusions against opponents, said he hopes to instill confidence in younger teammates’ abilities next year as a senior as the team will no longer have as many graduate students to step up like past years. He said he hopes to use this season’s biggest lesson of adapting to play with new players and learning to play together as a team to solidify his leadership role.
“Something that I hope to implement is just being more of a leader,” Jovanovic said. “We’ve had a lot of grad students and seniors in the past couple years, and I haven’t really been able to step up as a leader. But now as one of the seniors I want to show more of my leadership toward the younger players and help them be confident in the water.”
Jovanovic, who held the third-best shooting percentage on the team at .519, said the team needs to continue to practice through the off-season and to bond as a team in order to be successful next season by improving their swimming to maintain a competitive edge.
“Something that we have to improve on, inside the pool, is probably our swimming, just staying in shape and doing what we can to not lose everything we worked for this season,” Jovanovic said. “And then out of the water, just staying as a team and having team events and team bonding and staying connected as a whole.”
Jovanovic said learning how to play as a team and with six new players was a challenge and brought them closer as they learned to navigate a new team dynamic and energy to bolster their play into the 15-game streak.

Right out of the gate in the second half, Robertson erupted. The fiery freshman scored the last 15 points of the third quarter for the Colonials, including three 3-pointers.
After a flu outbreak – which first hit the squad at the UNLV Thanksgiving Tournament – knocked two starters out of the lineup, women’s basketball rallied to grind out a win against Ohio as they picked up their fifth win on the season, improving to 5-4.
A season-high scoring effort from graduate student guard Jayla Thornton and a second-half eruption from freshman guard Nya Robertson powered the short-handed Colonial offense, while senior forward Mayowa Taiwo anchored the defense, pulling down 17 boards in addition to 10 points, good for a double-double. While the Bobcats went on a few runs throughout the game, the GW lead was never in any real danger, as the short-handed squad coasted to a 74-57 win.
“Everyone’s just trying to get healthy,” Head Coach Caroline McCombs said in a post-game interview. “But you know, people have illnesses, and that illness bug hit us in Vegas and is still lingering. So we’re trying to get healthy, and I thought today was a really good opportunity for some other players to step up and show what they can do.”
In her first start of the season, Thornton kickstarted the game with a spark, hitting her first two threes to give the Colonials an early 6-1 lead.
“I’ve been focused on, really, lately, just having my feet set and just staying locked in,” Thornton said. “So knowing we were down in numbers, I know I have to be as accurate as possible, we all felt that way, just trying to focus on my shot was the main focus.”
She didn’t cool down for the rest of the quarter, finishing the first quarter with four triples and 14 points. Thanks in large part to Thornton’s hot hand, GW closed out the first quarter with a 23-17 lead.
The Colonials began to extend their lead in the second quarter, as a 3-pointer from Thornton with 3:09 to go sparked a 7-2 GW run that carried them into the half with a 10-point cushion 38-28.
Right out of the gate in the second half, Robertson erupted. The fiery freshman scored the last 15 points of the third quarter for the Colonials, including three 3-pointers.
“It felt great just having the home atmosphere, so I had to go crazy for them,” Robertson said.
After Robertson’s huge quarter, GW’s lead grew to 14 as they led 59-45 going into the final quarter.
And the Colonials never looked back. Robertson scored 7 more points to give her 24 on the night as GW coasted to a 74-57 victory.
The Colonials’ 3-point shooting – a point of emphasis for the team over the off-season – was a bright spot on the night, as the team finished with 12 total.
“Since we touched down in the summer, we’ve kind of revamped our offense,” Thornton, who hit seven of her 13 3-point attempts, said. “We have a lot of guards, and definitely a lot of people that can shoot the ball and I feel like our offense helps us do that.”
While the explosion of scoring from Thornton and Robertson captured so much attention, McCombs also stressed Taiwo’s presence for the Colonials on both ends of the floor as a contributing factor in the win.
“Tonight she was tremendous,” McCombs said. “She was a great presence out there on the floor today getting good rebounds, even being like a safety for us on offense. I’m really proud.”
McCombs added that fan engagement would be key to the team’s success going forward.
“We want to try to have an atmosphere where it’s exciting and our players are excited to play,” McCombs said. “And the fans are enjoying the style of play that we’re putting out there, so really excited to kind of continue to build on our home crowd and that home-court advantage that we want to have.”
The Colonials look to take home their second consecutive win in a matchup with TCU in Fort Worth, Texas, Monday at 6 p.m.

A slight bubble from the prosecco adds an enticing layer to the drink, but the gorgeously spiced and fruity flavor from the reduction masks most of the alcoholic kick from the sparkly wine and gin. Even for those who don’t celebrate Christmas, usher in the merriment and jolliness of the season with this chilly cocktail.
2321 18th St. NW. Pop-up runs through Dec. 31. Open daily from noon to 2 or 3 a.m. Make a reservation here.
Death Punch’s “Christmapolitan”
For those looking for a holiday beverage that is less sweet but plenty festive, Miracle’s “Christmapolitan” ($17) is the way to go. Like the classic Cosmopolitan, this jolly cocktail includes vodka, spiced cranberry sauce and lime as a base. But its notes of elderflower, dry vermouth, rosemary and absinthe mist are what set it apart from its everyday counterpart and add some holiday flare with musky notes.
The elderflower’s subtle notes of fresh pear and lychee compliment the sourness of the cranberry juice wonderfully, while the bitter herbal and floral infusions in the dry vermouth mask the sweetness in the drink. The rosemary adds a muskiness to the drink’s sophisticated flavor profile. A light misting of absinthe spirits, complete with notes of fennel and green anise, elevates the drink beyond your wildest expectations of any holiday-themed cocktail.
2321 18th St. NW. Pop-up runs through Dec. 31. Open daily from noon to 2 or 3 a.m. Make a reservation here.
Residents’ “Pomegranate”
Residents is nestled on a quieter side street in Dupont Circle, set away from surrounding lively bars and restaurants. With an unmatched, boho chic atmosphere and decor updates for all four seasons, the inviting bar specializes in an ever-evolving seasonal drink menu, including everything from the “Pomegranate” ($17) to the “Green Apple” ($17).
Leading up to the winter months, the “Pomegranate” acts as a simple and understated yet satisfying choice to ring in the holidays. The brightly colored crimson drink sits in a tall, clear glass topped with crushed ice cubes and a heaping sprig of mint leaves, mimicking a Christmassy aesthetic. Notes of lime and cinnamon compliment the fresh pomegranate juice, while curacao orange campari and tequila blanco add the necessary buzz and mute the sweeter flavors in the cocktail.
1306 18th St. NW. Seasonal cocktails offered for a limited time. Find hours and make a reservation here.
Garden District’s “Santa’s Little Helper”
Garden District is one of 14th Street’s many beer gardens, but its unassuming-yet-appealing outdoor holiday decorations like light-up Santa statues, candy canes and garlands set it apart from its competitors during the winter season. In addition to beer from local breweries, customers can order a variety of cozy, warm beverages from the limited-time holiday menu in the outdoor patio’s casual seating area.
Garden District’s “Santa’s Little Helper” ($12) is a simple-yet-delicious take on spiked hot cocoa, mixed with peppermint schnapps for a minty and boozy kick. The two heaping marshmallows sitting atop of the drink are roasted to perfection, adding a necessary sweetness when dipped into the strong drink. The peppermint, chocolate and marshmallow flavors come together to create a harmonious blend. If you’re in search of a no-nonsense seasonal beverage to put you in the holiday spirit without all the bells and whistles, this drink is for you.

Creating paper-ring garlands, topping your table with wrapping paper as a runner or hanging up a store-bought or DIY wreath on your door will be more than enough to spice up your space.
As the year draws to a close, the winter season will undoubtedly bring the traditions of red ribbons, pine trees, ornaments and the pressure of throwing a properly festive holiday party.
When it comes to party activities, seasonal snacks and festive finishing touches, enhancing a holiday function doesn’t need to be as daunting for a host as it may seem. For exciting and easy ways to spice up your next celebration, here are our top five tips to add a little magic to your event without adding too much effort to your workload.
Focus on the food
The nostalgic flavors of the holidays are an essential part of any snowy soiree, and no holiday party is complete without seasonal favorites like gingerbread, peppermint, cinnamon and eggnog. Bake a batch of decorated Christmas cookies, plan a gingerbread house-building contest or craft a signature cocktail with peppermint liqueur to pay homage to the classic treats of winter’s past. If you plan on serving a meal at your party, consider inviting guests to bring along their favorite holiday dish to facilitate a potluck. Encourage an inclusion of multicultural cuisines to enhance your pitch-in, assigning each guest a new recipe to try. Or stick to a selection of red- or green-colored dishes for a Christmas theme with an extra challenge.
Deck the halls
Putting up holiday decorations doesn’t have to be reminiscent of the extravagance seen in “National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation,” complete with a giant tree, gaudy roof decorations and enough Christmas lights to cause a power outage. You don’t have to go over the top to prepare your home for your holiday party – a little can go a long way. Creating paper-ring garlands, topping your table with wrapping paper as a runner or hanging up a store-bought or DIY wreath on your door will be more than enough to spice up your space. Even with Christmas tree alternatives, the options are endless. Miniature plastic models and smaller plants like a rosemary shrub can replicate that classic evergreen look, while life-size wall decals keep up the festive spirit without sacrificing the floor space.
Incorporate inclusivity
The winter season encompasses a variety of diverse religious, regional and cultural holidays – the weeks from December to January include celebrations like Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, Christmas, Bodhi Day, Yaldā Night, Yule and many others. If your guests celebrate different holidays, consider organizing a conversation with your group before the event to brainstorm how all guests can incorporate their own traditions. Celebrating multiple religious and cultural traditions instead of one will make your holiday party more inclusive of all beliefs and practices. Your party should be enjoyable for all of your guests without making anyone feel excluded or uncomfortable.
Don’t forget the details
Paying attention to the details is essential to making your event memorable when you’re planning a holiday party. Consider small additions with big impacts, like party favor stockings for your guests stuffed with candy or small gifts to hand out at the party’s end. Create a party hashtag to connect your group’s social media posts or organize a Secret Santa gift exchange with added challenges, like limiting gifts to certain local stores or sticking to a theme. To share in your friends’ annual customs, encourage guests to bring their own holiday traditions, like a party game or special dish, to enjoy with the group. Turning on some upbeat holiday music and lighting a seasonal candle can contribute even more cheer to the atmosphere. For a special touch, arrange a hot chocolate bar with a Keurig, K-cups, mugs and whipped cream to make your party pop.
Embrace the spirit of the season
For a cheerful and charitable activity to share with your guests, plan a collaborative craft to support a charity during your party. Many local organizations would appreciate extra support during the holiday season, including resource programs, food pantries, soup kitchens and hospitals. House of Ruth’s annual Gifts for Families program – which collects holiday gifts for women, children and families healing from trauma, abuse and homelessness – is just one of many causes to get behind during the holiday season. Set up a table to write holiday cards for hospitalized children around the nation, make fleece tie blankets for those in need, build care kits for the unhoused community or coordinate a small supply drive for a food pantry. This season is all about giving, so consider donating some of your time to the charities that need it the most.
