The base cost of housing and dining will increase by $580, rising from $15,720 for the 2022-23 academic year to $16,300 for the 2023-24 academic year.
Undergraduate tuition will rise to $64,700 next academic year, according to a University release Friday.
The $62,110 tuition rate in 2022-23 – the highest tuition in GW’s history – will increase by 4.2 percent and keep GW’s overall cost of attendance over $80,000, according to the release. The release states that officials are working to “contain” the cost of attendance and will provide “additional” need-based financial aid to help students finance their education.
The cost of attendance at GW surpassed $80,000 for the first time this academic year for most undergraduates.
“Affordability is important in determining whether talented students come to and stay at GW,” the release states.
The base cost of housing and dining will increase by $580, rising from $15,720 for the 2022-23 academic year to $16,300 for the 2023-24 academic year.
“The University is also committed to ongoing enhancements to the overall student experience,” the release states. “As part of these ongoing efforts, GW has reimagined its dining program by introducing all-you-care-to-eat on-campus dining in the Thurston, Shenkman and West residence halls to complement other dining spaces in District House and GW Hillel.”
Prior to the pandemic, tuition rates have risen by about three percent each year, increasing by 2.1 percent from $59,780 in the 2020-21 academic year to $62,110 in the 2021-22 academic year.
Starting next academic year, most undergraduate students will not have fixed-tuition rates after the Board of Trustees voted to end the fixed-tuition-rate policy for students entering the University in the fall 2020 semester.
President Biden announced a plan to cancel up to $10,000 of student loan debt for most borrowers in April, but a federal appeals court temporarily blocked the plan after several Republican-led states said it was an overreach of Biden’s powers.
About a third of GW students received federal student loans last year and would be eligible for Biden’s forgiveness plan.

Sen. Mitch McConnell will remain in the hospital for a "few days" after his concussion, according to a New York Times report.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was transported to GW Hospital after falling at a Wednesday night dinner event and will remain there for the next “few days,” the New York Times reported Thursday.
David Popp, a McConnell spokesperson, told the Times that responders delivered the senator to the hospital at about 9 p.m., where he is seeking treatment for a concussion after tripping and falling at a fundraiser dinner at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel on 1100 Block of Pennsylvania Avenue NW, a hotel previously owned by former President Trump until last spring. Government officials, including President Biden, Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer, D-NY and other members of Congress wished McConnell, 81, a fast recovery.
McConnell’s spokesperson did not comment on the leader’s condition or status for returning to the Senate floor, but said McConnell is “grateful” to medical professionals and his colleagues for their “warm wishes,” according to the Associated Press.
McConnell spokesperson Doug Andres did not immediately return The Hatchet’s request for comment. A spokesperson at GW Hospital declined to comment.
Sen. John Fetterman, D-PA, was admitted to GW Hospital last month after experiencing lightheadedness following a stroke the year prior. He was discharged two days later after he tested negative for a stroke and did not show signs of a potential seizure.
GW Hospital officials also treated Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-MD, after he experienced a “minor” stroke last May.

Neha Darisi, a freshman majoring in international affairs, said she learned of GW Dissenters from Duppada and that the passion of other members as well as the club’s anti-war messaging attracted her to the cause.
A student activist group’s petition demanding the University divest from top U.S. weapons manufacturers has gained more than 350 signatures.
GW Dissenters staged a protest late last month where they tried to urge the Board of Trustees to commit to divesting from top weapon manufacturers like Lockheed Martin and Boeing. The group launched the petition in November and it has since amassed more than 350 signatures from students, faculty and alumni demanding divestment.
Aryani Duppada, a freshman majoring in sociology and member, said she hopes that beyond divesting in major weapons companies, GW administrators will reallocate funds from tuition into student interests like campus infrastructure. Duppada and the GW Dissenters said they hope for “greater transparency” about GW’s investments in general since the school does not publicly release its expenditures.
“As people who go to school at GW, we really need to know where our money’s going,” Duppada said.
University spokesperson Julia Metjian said the University is “aware” of the petition submitted by Dissenters and that they do not approach investments on a “company-by-company basis.”
“The endowment is invested in a diverse portfolio of funds that are adjusted regularly,” she said. “The University works to ensure that the endowment is managed in a legal and ethical matter.”
A video posted by Dissenters shows Board of Trustees Chair Grace Speights saying the Board will consider the petition.
Duppada met Dissenters co-founder Jelina Liu at a Student Org Fair this September. She said she soon became heavily involved in GW Dissenters, working to expand the club’s membership and recognition through social media, banners and their petition.
“We just want the administrators to know that students want a say in where our money goes, and we don’t want them to be using it to invest in weapons companies,” Duppada said. “We have real problems on campus that they need to fix.”
Duppada said students who want to get involved can message GW Dissenters on Instagram to find more information on their actions.
“We are trying to build a community at our campus and in D.C. of students who are either impacted by imperialism or just want to get involved in any way,” Duppada said. 
Liu, a junior majoring in political communication, said she was inspired to begin the chapter at GW after she noticed that primarily “older, white” individuals were at the forefront of anti-war movements. She said she felt it was important to have a Dissenters chapter at GW due to the University’s location in the nation’s capital and potential ties to weapons manufacturing companies.
“We are so close to the White House and all these people in power who are the ones who vote for pushing the U.S. into wars,” Liu said. “A lot of people in Congress have stock in these weapon companies, which influences their decisions.”
Liu said the top weapon manufacturers are “complicit” in the murder of civilians all over the world, and due to the University’s investment, “they are actively killing people.”
“The companies profit off of war essentially, and of course GW is involved in that,” Liu said.
Neha Darisi, a freshman majoring in international affairs, said she learned of GW Dissenters from Duppada and that the passion of other members as well as the club’s anti-war messaging attracted her to the cause. She said she gravitated toward the “strong” community within GW Dissenters after attending their first meeting, which spurred her decision to become more involved. Darisi said she is responsible for contacting students in Howard University’s Dissenters and helping lead club meetings.
On Valentine’s Day, GW Dissenters held a large banner in Kogan Plaza to gain signatures before sending the petition in a letter to GW’s Board of Trustees Feb. 21. The banner, decorated with red and black, read, “Dear GW, break up with weapons companies.” 
Darisi said she hopes that GW Dissenters will be able to educate students on the impacts of GW’s investments as well as the impacts of war on developing countries. 
“We want to change GW’s campus culture,” Darisi said.
Darisi said the national Dissenters organization is planning an event in D.C. that students from universities across the East Coast will be able to attend. Darisi said the event will be held the weekend of March 24 through 26, and students from schools like the University of Maryland and Howard University will be in attendance.
“We’re in the center of everything,” Darisi said. “With our global position, I think [Dissenters] is super important, but it matters on every campus too.”
Darisi said the companies GW is investing in are selling weapons and thereby “funding genocide.” 
“This is rational, about people’s lives. And so we’re not going to stop this. This is not what our school should represent,” Darisi said.

One thing is for certain – each of this year’s 10 Best Picture Academy Award nominees “did the thing” in their own way.
The 2023 awards season has been both exciting and unexpected, from Cate Blanchett’s anticlimactic Golden Globe win for Best Actress to Ariana DeBose’s campy viral performance at the British Academy Film Awards.
Like DeBose sang in an awkward musical number to a confused crowd of nominated actors, Blanchett was “a genius” in “Tár” and Jamie Lee Curtis was “all of us” in “Everything Everywhere All at Once.” But one thing is for certain – each of this year’s 10 Best Picture Academy Award nominees “did the thing” in their own way.
Read on to hear The Hatchet staff’s case for why each film on this list deserves to win the most coveted award at the Oscars this Sunday:
All Quiet on the Western Front
Henry Huvos | Senior Staff Writer
“All Quiet on the Western Front,” a remake of the Best Picture-winning 1930 American film, tells the story of Paul Bäumer, a young German soldier, as the harsh realities of World War I shatter his heroic aspirations and idealism. Unlike the 1930 film, this 2022 take on the story is entirely in German, aiding the film’s already strong authenticity and realism. Similar to war flicks like “Saving Private Ryan” and “1917,” the film doesn’t shy away from the gore, brutality and heartbreak that define armed conflict. The film’s precise direction, powerful performances and gorgeous cinematography contribute to a moving experience unlike any other 2022 film has to offer.
Avatar: The Way of Water
Nick Perkins | Staff Writer
The visually stunning follow-up to the 2009 record-breaking original film, “Avatar, The Way of Water” follows Jake Sully, a human-turned-alien revolutionary leader, and his family as they escape humans hunting them down and move to a water-based community. The film’s plot doesn’t divert much from the typical blockbuster formula, featuring heroes and villains with limited complexity and a dramatic final showdown. But where “The Way of Water” really stands out is in its visuals, as director James Cameron immerses viewers in the underwater world of Pandora through a second act that feels more like a nature documentary where the Sully family learns about their new home. The visuals are gorgeous and make “The Way of Water” a breathtaking cinematic experience.
The Banshees of Inisherin
Henry Huvos | Senior Staff Writer
Set on a remote island off the coast of Ireland against the backdrop of the Irish Civil War, “The Banshees of Inisherin” begins when Colm (Brendan Gleeson) abruptly ends his lifelong friendship with Pádraic (Colin Farrell) for no apparent reason. What follows is the tragic, yet darkly comedic story of Pádraic’s attempts to repair the friendship despite Colm’s protests. Farrell and Gleeson are excellent, and writer-director Martin McDonagh does a masterful job conveying the pair’s incongruent outlooks on life and peace in addition to the consequences that result from their feud. With outstanding supporting performances from the entire cast and breathtaking visuals of the Irish coast, “The Banshees of Inisherin” features some of 2022’s most poignant and emotional storytelling throughout its runtime.
Elvis
Jack Parr | Reporter
“Elvis” follows the life and career of the “King of Rock” Elvis Presley (Austin Butler) and his widely criticized manager Colonel Tom Parker (Tom Hanks), highlighting the complicated relationship between these two characters. “Elvis” presents Parker as a multifaceted character who stood by Presley during the heaviest struggles of his life and career while overworking him like a circus animal – insight into what really led to the downfall of the superstar. The film’s most poignant scene showcases Presley and his band rehearsing for their first show at the Las Vegas International Hotel, illuminating the intricacies that go into each performance. The scene brings the audience into what Elvis Presley’s music is truly all about and displays the unfathomable levels of talent and stage presence that made him a musical legend.
Everything Everywhere All at Once
Abrigail Williams | Senior Staff Writer
“Everything Everywhere All at Once” follows Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh) as the IRS audits her over the failing laundromat business she runs with her husband. But the film turns on its head as it moves from a typical drama into an unpredictable genre-bending masterpiece. The film depicts the struggles of turbulent mother-daughter relationships, an escape from intergenerational trauma and neglect for love that’s right in front of you. In an overstimulating world, filmmakers splice our attention between the plot and the underlying messaging until we’ve learned the meaning of life without even knowing. At its core, the film tells us that nothing really matters in life except the people you love. True life can persist in every mundane moment, everywhere, all at once.
The Fabelmans
Zach Blackburn | Senior News Editor
Iconic director Steven Spielberg’s “The Fabelmans” revolves around Sammy Fabelman (Gabriel LaBelle), a young Jewish boy who becomes infatuated with filmmaking and the art’s tense relationship with family. Paul Dano and Michelle Williams shine as Fabelman’s parents, but Judd Hirsch is the true standout as the scene-stealing uncle who delivers a passionate and fiery speech about being a disillusioned artist. Spielberg uses the movie as a raw introspection of some of the difficulties of his childhood, ranging from antisemitism he faced from classmates to his parents’ marital struggles to young love. Some may describe “The Fablemans” as a love letter to cinema, but the truth is much more painful than that – the film chronicles the curse of a genius artist who can only live his life through film.
Tár
Nick Perkins | Staff Writer
Cate Blanchett turns in a sterling performance in director Todd Field’s exploration of power in the world of classical music. The film follows Lydia Tár, a fictional superstar composer, and her fall from grace as her abuse of influence over her students catches up to her. “Tár” combines drama about cancel culture and art with pseudo-psychological character study and subtle comedy. If you see the film and enjoy it, you’ll have plenty of reading to do about the numerous think pieces that inspired the movie and its true meaning, which draws on elements of abuse of power and the corruption of fame.
Top Gun: Maverick
Nick Perkins | Staff Writer
In the sequel to the 1986 original “Top Gun,” Tom Cruise reprises his role as Maverick, a play-by-his-own-rules pilot who is forced to stop testing planes and become a teacher at Fighter Weapons School – or as the flyers call it, Top Gun. Maverick must train a group of young pilots, including Rooster, the son of his former flying partner, to complete a seemingly impossible mission against the vaguely defined enemy. “Top Gun: Maverick” exhilarates with high-flying fighter pilot action, from training montages to the final mission against the enemy. What raises “Maverick” to an even higher level is all the right emotional beats, including callbacks to earlier lines in the original film and closure for some of the 1986 main characters.
Triangle of Sadness
Maximus Vogt | Reporter
Director Ruben Östlund takes the story of a shipwreck that deserts passengers on a remote island and turns it into a comment on modern society. The three-act film touches upon capitalism, gender roles and social hierarchy until chaos ensues on the island. The references to the benefits of a communist society may seem verbose, but the film is completely self-aware of its own pretentiousness. Östlund took a risk with the movie, choosing to provide commentary over comfort. While this film may seem off-putting, that’s also its very strength – “Triangle of Sadness” makes the audience ponder the hierarchies that exist in the world around them and unpack societal constructs.
Women Talking
Oliver Grover | Reporter
Content warning: rape, sexual assault
“Women Talking” may be one of the most uncomfortable movies of 2022, but it’s one you shouldn’t miss. Taking place in a secluded religious colony in Bolivia from 2005 to 2009, the female villagers must decide if they will forgive the men for a long string of rapes within the village or face exile. The film consists of lengthy, often uncomfortable conversations between the women in the village as they explore their shared trauma and discuss options for their future. The main cast further elevates the film with fiery, impassioned monologues alongside more subtle and quiet moments of devastation. The film doesn’t offer any easy answers or resolutions, but even in its darkest moments, it allows the audience to be hopeful for the future of these characters.

Growing up as a daughter of Indian American immigrants, I struggled greatly between juggling the American and Indian parts of my identity. I lived in a predominantly white community and consumed predominantly white media, so I was not used to seeing people that looked like me outside of my family at home.
This lack of representation played a major role in shaping my identity. Many of my wildest dreams and career aspirations felt out of reach simply because I had never seen someone who looked like me achieve them first. As I matured and broke out of the narrow mindset that I could not amount to something simply because someone else of my race has not already done so, I quickly learned that this narrative was far from true – I could achieve whatever I wanted as long as I put my mind to it. Still, I was beyond overjoyed when Kamala Harris was the first person of South Asian descent to be elected vice president, and I saw the same enthusiasm from my Indian family and friends. Finally, I saw a version of myself in one of the highest offices in American politics.
But although South Asian representation in politics has grown, their advocacy for Indian Americans is lacking. Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina and the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations under former President Donald Trump’s administration, announced her candidacy for president in the 2024 election last month. In her announcement, Haley proclaimed that as the daughter of Indian immigrants, she represents a new generation in American politics. But like other Indian American politicians, her words don’t align with her actions.
In the past few years, South Asian representation in politics has grown rapidly from Harris’ role in the White House to Haley’s plans to run for president in 2024. Since 2013, the number of Indian Americans in Congress has jumped from one to five, and 50 South Asians currently serve in state legislatures – a drastic change from ten years ago when only ten Indians held a state office.
As a political communications major and Indian American woman, this kind of representation makes me hopeful for the future and excited for the young South Asian women growing up in the U.S. Seeing elected officials who look like them signals great change and sends the message that their dreams are possible. But even with this slight influx in representation, I’ve found myself disappointed by how little these politicians acknowledge their heritage and culture past the campaign trail, if at all.
As much as South Asian representation in politics inspires me, it also requires more than representation from those who look like me. These elected officials must reflect the ideals of the South Asian population. Indian figures in politics barely reference their roots, and when they do, they only capitalize on their heritage on the campaign trail without actively seeking out the needs of their cultural community once they’re in office.
Indian Americans are the second largest immigrant population in the United States and make up key voting blocs in historically battleground states like Pennsylvania, Texas and Florida. Like clockwork, South Asian politicians target their campaigns toward Indian voters during election years to rake in their votes and donations, but this sentiment disappears the minute they enter office.
Haley’s claims that she represents Indian American immigrants don’t align with her policies. She has historically been anti-immigration and is now running for the Republican nomination on a platform that looks to limit border crossings. Experts have said Indian voters’ support for an easier immigration process and opposition to nativism and xenophobia are major factors influencing their political participation and how likely they are to vote.
Other politicians like former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal have been vocal about distancing themselves from their Indian roots. Jindal said in a 2015 speech that his parents told him and his brother they “came to America to be Americans, not Indian Americans.” This damaging statement along with his decision to ditch his birth name Piyush – a common Indian name – when he began his political career bothers me as an Indian woman who has spent much of my life feeling pressured to fit myself into a whiter narrative despite my race and culture.
Jindal’s rhetoric and name change bring me right back to high school, listening to the substitute teacher tell me she will not even attempt to pronounce my first or last name because they’re “ethnic.” When Indian American politicians like Jindal whitewash themselves, not only are they telling white people that the rest of the world will consistently go out of their way to make things easier for them, but they’re also telling the young children with “ethnic” names that they should attempt to hide a part of themselves to be successful and accepted. Like Jindal, Haley’s birth name is Nimarata, yet she chooses to go by her middle name, Nikki.
These politicians’ approach to their public identity is harmful, especially when they are immigrants or children of immigrants themselves. They’re counteracting their performative messaging that immigrant children should embrace their culture instead of feeling embarrassed about their differences.
This new wave of Indian American representation in politics is undoubtedly a positive thing, and I am beyond grateful to be living during a time when I see the U.S. government mirror my ethnicity. But progress does not end with mere representation. South Asian politicians need to be more cognizant of how their words and actions can affect their communities and detract from them. Indian politicians must stop playing into the narrative of craving acceptance by a white majority and instead embrace their culture and its differences.

Facing a problem yourself? Annie has answers. Ask away!
Nicholas Anastacio | Graphics Editor
Dear Annie,
How do I stop hooking up with freshmen? I keep running into them in District House, and it’s become a problem.
XOXO,
Cradle Robber
Dear Cradle Robber,
With the newly deflated atmosphere in the District House basement, you wouldn’t expect anyone to make their way to this former hub of student life, especially not a freshman. A soft-serve machine in Thurston Hall’s cafeteria and courtyard study space should be enough to keep college newbies close to their cradles. Nevertheless, I suppose curiosity to see even the relics of the ancient GW social scene drove the freshmen out to cross your path.
What is it about freshmen that attracts you? Is it the way they call their parents while doing their laundry to find out if they wash sweaters on cold or hot? You may feel comparatively mature with fewer simple questions for your parents. Or is it their doe-eyed expectation of doing keg stands every weekend at one of GW’s few and underwhelming fraternities? They haven’t yet uncovered that Greek life at GW tends to look a lot more like networking among professional fraternities than partying.
Jenna Baer | Staff Cartoonist
There is no reason strong enough to hook up with tons of freshmen. Running into a former freshman lover only reminds you how low – in age – your standards are. Most people don’t enjoy seeing a past hook-up stroll by as they shove a slice of greasy pizza from DH Pizza & Pasta Co. down their throat, reminding them of what else they may have put down the pipe. Don’t forget we’re talking about an underclassman who hasn’t even finished their gen-ed requirements yet. While you’re in between bites, they might ask which courses will give them an easy A!
Let’s identify the circumstances that precede inviting a freshman back to your dorm – or, worse, going back to theirs with childhood stuffed animals waiting to greet you. Avoid activities that trigger your urge to get freaky with a frosh. If seeing a hungry freshman in the Carvings line whets your appetite, start using delivery services to order your late-night snacks. If you usually wind up lip-locking in an Uber headed from Decades to the Mount Vernon Campus, steer clear of Connecticut Avenue late at night! Heading to Adams Morgan, Shaw or U Street could be safer alternatives to the younger crowd at Dupont Circle. When you need to study, travel off campus to coffee shops, museums or libraries, free from the crawl of freshmen who clutter the likes of Gelbucks, the University Student Center and Kogan Plaza.
A hookup should feel sexy, not like a campus tour or orientation event. You deserve someone who’s been here long enough to know the difference between Potomac Square and Square 80. Surround yourself with a trustworthy group of friends who can keep you accountable if any romantic interest comes your way. If you need to test your prospect’s age, just ask them if the name “Thomas LeBlanc” means anything to them.
But no matter how hard you try, identifying and replacing triggers or finding an accountability buddy may not always stop you from sleeping with a freshman. If, or when, you find yourself making the trek home from Thurston, forgive your mistake and try harder to break the habit tomorrow. And while you’re at it, maybe eat and study at Western Market for the week instead of District. Fingers crossed the freshmen haven’t discovered Falafel Inc yet!
Best of luck,
Annie<3

Laguerre-Brown said the next phase of the initiative includes compiling recommendations to present to the provosts based on the data from the surveys.
Half of the respondents to GW’s spring 2022 diversity climate survey said they had experienced some kind of negative treatment based on their identity in the past five years, officials said at forum discussions of the data.
Community-wide forums held in the University Student Center Tuesday and Wednesday marked phase five of the GW Diversity Program Review Team’s seven-step initiative to assess community feedback about the current diversity, equity and inclusion program at GW and provide recommendations to the Board of Trustees based on their assessment of the results. Officials administered the anonymous survey in mid-April of last year and extended it to close in early June, where they collected feedback from undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty and staff resulting in a total of 10,000 responses.
Officials said respondents reported that there is a need to increase diversity on campus at the student, faculty, staff and leadership levels. Officials added that staff had the highest response rate out of the three groups of respondents.
LGBTQ+ respondents reported the most “negative” identity-based treatment and reported having the most negative experience with inclusion at the University. DPRT officials said they categorized issues concerning sexuality differently from transgender and nonbinary issues in order to be “mindful” of comparing gender and sexuality.
Caroline Laguerre-Brown, the vice provost for diversity, equity and community engagement, said she hopes the Diversity Program Review Team recommends better support for faculty in increasing inclusiveness in their classrooms and in their curriculum. She said there is a disconnect between faculty who said they are actively trying to incorporate inclusivity into their classrooms and students who said they are not seeing these changes in their classes, especially among minority students.
“We’re getting a lot of requests, but we’re not getting requests from all the faculty who are here, right. So maybe the students across the board are not seeing this kind of interest in making the changes that would make classroom experiences more inclusive,” Laguerre-Brown said.
The surveys showed that respondents reported low levels of inclusion at the University due to its high tuition and many suggested lowering costs to increase inclusion. The survey also found that one of staff and faculty members’ main concerns is raising salary and benefits.
Laguerre-Brown said the next phase of the initiative includes compiling recommendations to present to the provosts based on the data from the surveys. She said officials will then form an external review team which will include “national DEI leaders,” Bracey and other officials, with the ultimate goal of presenting their final recommendations to the Board of Trustees, who will decide if further action will be taken.
“That’s the idealized timeline. But you know, these are organic processes and you just never know,” Bracey said. “I’ve given a fairly concrete charge but a great deal of latitude to the diversity program review team. Because ultimately, from my perspective, it’s getting it right in the final analysis. I don’t want to rush it over the finish line if it’s not validated, right and ready to be endorsed.”
Provost Chris Bracey said GW’s financial burden is a significant factor which often deters minority students from coming to the University because it is disproportionally unaffordable to them.
“One of the things that keeps me up at night, honestly, is our increasing tuition and the fact that we know that that burden is serious for students and many students are unable to come, particularly minority students, are having difficulty making the decision to come to GW precisely because it’s not affordable to them,” Bracey said.
Bracey said he has been meeting regularly with incoming University President Ellen Granberg, who he describes as a strong supporter of “inclusive excellence,” to keep her up to date on community feedback to the DEI program. He said that the recommendations that come out of the diversity program review will be on Granberg’s “to-do” list when she steps into office.
“I firmly believe that we can only reach our full potential as a comprehensive global research university if our aspirations are defined by inclusive excellence,” Bracey said.

John Capozzi, a former D.C. shadow representative in the House between 1995 and 1997, said members of Congress are making a “political statement” at the expense of District residents
D.C. residents and local officials flocked to the U.S. Capitol Wednesday afternoon to protest senators’ impending overturn of the D.C. Council’s revised criminal code. 
More than 150 people gathered to rally against the Congress’ efforts to reject the city’s new criminal code by Columbus Circle at about 11 a.m., with U.S. Capitol Police officers arresting 17 demonstrators after the crowd marched to Senate offices about two hours later. Senators voted 81-14 to nullify the city’s disputed code later that night, and President Biden said he would sign the bill after voicing initial opposition last week.
The measure passed the Senate with the support of all the chamber’s Republicans, 33 Democrats and one independent after the GOP-led House voted to block the code with bipartisan support in February. Under the 1973 Home Rule Act, Congress must vote on every D.C. law prior to enactment and sends disapprovals of any local legislation to the White House for the president’s signature or veto.
Speakers from community and statehood advocacy organizations, advisory neighborhood commissioners and D.C. Council members attended the protest, voicing their opposition to Congress’ first interference in D.C. law in more than thirty years. Council chair Phil Mendelson, who withdrew the revised code Monday to prevent the Senate from blocking the bill, told The Hatchet that the Senate’s interference is “offensive” and that senators did not technically override the code because he pulled the legislation back first.
“There will always be an asterisk beside the statement that Congress overrode our bill,” Mendelson said.
After the Council unanimously passed the revised criminal code in November after spending more than a decade drafting updates that redefine and specify the District’s 122-year-old crime laws, Mayor Muriel Bowser vetoed the changes in January. She expressed resistance to portions of the legislation that would scrap most mandatory minimum sentences, drop mandatory maximum sentences for property crimes and expand jury trials for misdemeanors, a veto which the Council subsequently overrode about two weeks later.
President Biden and members of Congress voiced concern over reducing penalties for some property crimes in the District amid a spike in carjacking. Violent crime has decreased, according to MPD data.
Mendelson said penalties in states like Arizona or Tennessee, whose representatives oppose the crime code, have looser penalties on carjacking, while House Republicans try to “embarrass” Democrats by framing the party’s policies as “soft on crime.” He said while opposing Biden’s choice to side with Congress, he “understands” his position.
“His action underscores that this is not about the D.C. criminal code,” Mendelson said. “This is about national partisan politics.”
Reverend Wendy Hamilton, an 8D06 advisory neighborhood commissioner and board member for DCVote who spoke at the rally, said she believes the federal government overriding the criminal code revisions sets a precedent for Congress to use D.C. residents as a “political football” without regard to their laws and capacity for self-governance.
Hamilton said it’s “unfortunate” that Bowser, who was absent from the rally, vetoed the bill. She claimed the mayor “didn’t bother” to have conversations with the D.C. Council about her concerns as the criminal code revisions were being drafted, and that Biden is contradicting his previous support of D.C. sovereignty by signing Congress’ override of the criminal code revisions.
“‘D.C. statehood is important to me, D.C. statehood is a priority,’ he said over and over again,” Hamilton said. “Words mean nothing if you can’t act on them. You’re just talking, Joe.”
Hamilton said if Congress thinks residents of the District are going to back down in their efforts to protect the city’s voting abilities, they “don’t know D.C.”
“We’re going to keep fighting for D.C. statehood,” Hamilton said. “We’re going to keep marching for our autonomy because we know our cause is right, our cause is just.” 
Capitol Police officers arrested Trupti Patel, a Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner, at about 1:30 p.m. Patel and 15 other protestors were arrested for crowding, obstructing and incommoding, and one other was arrested for defacement. 
Patel said she thinks Biden is a “colonizer in chief” for letting Congress override the revised criminal code. She said it’s “unacceptable” for Biden to allow the veto of the revised criminal code because about 90 percent of D.C. residents voted for Biden in the 2020 presidential election. 
After her arrest, Patel said officers detained her and the other “arrestees” in a makeshift detention center until about 2:30 or 3 p.m., and issued each of them a $50 fine to be paid in 15 days. She said she doesn’t know whether she will pay the fine or protest it in court yet.
“How can you sit here and say you support D.C. statehood and then turn around and tell a population that they can’t think and decide for themselves?” Patel said.
John Capozzi, a former D.C. shadow representative in the House between 1995 and 1997, said members of Congress are making a “political statement” at the expense of District residents, which costs representatives “nothing” back home. He said the protest for statehood was the biggest he’s seen in 20 years and that while it was “disappointing” the mayor didn’t show, he was “impressed” with the turnout especially among young people.
“If they wanted to fix our crime problem, they could have appropriated endless amounts of money, we could police every corner, we could rehabilitate everybody, and we can make sure that crime goes down,” Capozzi said. “But that’s not what the people in the Congress are interested in.”

Catastrophic structural failure, nonsensical personal feuds and almost comical West Wing-style role-playing corrupt the SA, whose roots trace back to 1909. But while these issues are the flashy eye-catching pieces of palace intrigue that make the headlines, they are nowhere near the worst problems facing the SA. And I should know – until Feb. 15, I was one of them.
The SA Senate has doled out about $1.3 million to fund more than 600 of GW’s student-run organizations this fiscal year. And on Feb. 21, the senate unanimously approved legislation rewriting its bylaws to make the process to apply for funds easier. But they’re missing the point. Student organizations don’t have a hard time receiving money because of SA processes – they have a hard time because of the SA’s existence.
As legislator general, I was third in line for the presidency and worked before all three branches of the Student Association. But before I took the position, I was director of inventory, the deputy head of the SA Treasury department. I sat in on every Finance Committee meeting and watched every fall semester co-sponsorship allocation, line item transfer and general allocation.
Through my experience, I’ve found that the SA fails on finance due to three key reasons. First, self-imposed overregulation of permitted allocation. Second, the senate’s willing surrender of power to said regulation. And third, GW administration’s understandable loss of faith in the SA’s ability to manage money.
The 220 pages of SA governing documents can give even the nerdiest, law-obsessed readers a splitting headache. And that would be okay if complexities and contradictions didn’t get in the way of necessary policy work. But we don’t need to look very far for examples of this regulatory obstruction – take last semester’s legislative calendar. Debate over the senate’s internal processes accounted for 10 out of the 33 pieces of legislation the SA enacted. Of those 33, 14 filled executive branch vacancies. Just nine of the 33 acts had a substantive policy focus.
Chapter 500 of the SA’s bylaws governs its financial activities, which among other things, regulates how it can go about monetary allocation. With restrictions on requests, allocation spending limits and special exceptions for cultural organizations, chapter 500 gives the illusion of case-by-case consideration for student organization funding. But in reality, it is just the opposite. The majority of Finance Committee decisions on allocations are based on what the bylaws do and do not permit, not which student leaders need the money the most.
A prime example of how the SA’s bylaws restrict its ability to deliberate and decide on the allocations process is the SA’s most recent general allocation for the spring semester, where student organizations received between two and 10 percent of what they had requested. The Director of the Legislative Budget Office admitted to the senate that funding was so low because students requested about $2.2 million for the spring semester while the SA only had about $343,000 to allocate. Senators’ consideration for the $343,000 worth of funding for student organizations only lasted 30 minutes. Our senators, elected to represent us and act as our fiduciary agents, spent a half hour deliberating how to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of our money.
They spent such little time deliberating because that’s all they could do. Their hands were tied and they even admitted it – the regulations made the decisions for them. The SA’s democratic institutions like the senate no longer have power over allocations. Senators are in the control of the SA’s governing documents – a well-oiled perpetual motion machine that doesn’t need to provide one iota of due consideration to any student organization.
This February’s rewrite of chapter 500 does not fix any issue that plagues students. It merely changes how funds are organized, restricts how SA branches can spend their personal budgets and changes a few regulations of allocations. The changes only worsen the complexity of the governing documents. Make no mistake – this is a feel-good initiative so SA members can convince themselves that they’re making a change to a broken financial system that, through overzealous regulation and a desire to feel like “real” lawmakers, they themselves broke. This revision makes zero meaningful difference to that system and the idea that it does is a dangerous lie.
The most commonly used deflection for why SA finance is in such disrepair is to say the University doesn’t give them enough money. And it’s true that student organizations requested a total of $2.2 million last semester when the SA only had 16.75 percent of that to allocate. So if providing more funds to the SA would fix its problems, then why withhold them?
The answer is pretty straightforward. Like students, University leadership sees the failures of the SA’s structure and has lost faith in its ability to serve as an agent of our finances. Last summer, the University was prepared to materialize its lack of faith and withhold about $200,000 worth of funds that it usually contributes to the SA budget. But after backroom negotiation and concessions from both sides, the University consented to put the money into the University-Wide Programs Fund, an entity managed outside of the SA which provides funding to student organizations for large events.
The SA’s charter tells us that the proper allocation of funding to student organizations is the ultimate responsibility of the SA. But if the administrators of this institution no longer trust them, then why should we? The SA has lost the right to act as our fiduciary agents. The SA must not be permitted to manage our money any longer. The time has come for the University to force the SA to relinquish its financial responsibilities and vest them in a more responsible body.
