In Japanese, the word “izakaya” translates to “sit-down sake shop.” And while this restaurant serves over 24 varieties of sake, there is much more to Izakaya Seki than its tasty rice wine.
I was lucky enough to score a coveted reservation at the authentic Japanese restaurant near U Street. The restaurant is tucked among townhouses and condos, and if not for the Japanese lantern hanging near the door, we would have missed it completely. Make your entrance, and your two options are to either make a right toward the 10-seat sushi bar or climb a flight of narrow stairs to a dining room with about seven tables. I then understood why we couldn’t get a Saturday reservation until 9:30 p.m.
Once we ordered our food, the waiters promptly served us, never letting even five minutes go by before replacing our empty plates with filled ones. We started with a sushi sampler platter with some of the freshest sashimi I have ever tasted: tuna, scallops, yellow tail and squid, each different in taste and texture, but none with an unpleasant, lingering fishy flavor.
We also ordered an unusual seafood dish – the uni starter ($16), a bowl of fresh sea urchin accompanied by a quail egg. It had a buttery texture and tasted like the ocean, but I say that in the most positive way possible. Some of the more recognizable dishes included Kalbi – barbecue beef short ribs ($11), fried tofu in dashi sauce ($7), cold soba noodles in soy dipping sauce ($12) and Kara-Age – fried chicken with garlic puree ($9).
Each dish had a little twist to what you would typically expect: The short ribs were small and thin, with a rich, smoky flavor and perfect char; the soba noodles were cooked al dente and had a made-from-scratch taste and delicacy about them.
We each received a pot of scallion soy sauce for dipping, which added the right amount of salt and hearty flavor to the silky noodles. We also ordered vegetable tempura ($8) which, along with the fried chicken, was fluffy and crisp on the outside while still remaining tender, juicy and flavorful on the inside. The garlic sauce with the chicken reminded me of hummus, and it created a beautifully smooth contrast to the crunchy chicken without being too overpowering.
After ordering more than a dozen plates, we barely had room for dessert. But coming from a family of foodies and having the burden of a perpetual sweet tooth, I shared a small dish of black sesame flan with my guests. Flan sometimes gets a bad rap, but this version was creamy and velvety, not gelatinous and slimy as flan so often is. The sesame added the complexity of a nutty undertone and a rich charcoal-black color – hence the dessert’s name.
If the menu hasn’t convinced you of this restaurant’s authenticity, look no further than the beer and wine selection: There are more than 15 different Japanese wines and beers on tap, including my favorite, Sapporo. (Yes, that’s the beer used for sake bombs.) I decided on a bottle of Hitachino, a white ale that had aged in sake barrels, so it tasted sweet and light, with a hint of a rice flavor.
A quiet and authentic atmosphere with five-star food – what more can you ask for? You might run up the bill at Izakaya Seki if you order a lot, but if you’re looking to try some real Japanese cuisine, including astoundingly fresh seafood, I would highly recommend you make a reservation. Also, if you have the opportunity to sit at the sushi bar, do so. The owner-chef, Hiroshi Seki himself, has been known to appear behind the counter.

Uni Starter – $16
Porkbelly Kakuni – $13

The nation’s consumer protection watchdog laid out a new program last week to increase oversight of student loans – which were held by 45 percent of 2011 graduates, according to the most recent data available.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will begin regulating non-bank companies overseeing student loan payments, in addition to more than 150 banks and credit unions already under its purview. But the University’s top financial aid officer said that in its current form, the proposal will not impact GW students.
The rule would affect borrowers with both private and federal loans, as government loans are often farmed out to private loan servicers who collect payments and give borrowers with account information.
“We will always be there to answer loan questions for current students and alumni, especially if the information from their lender does not sound right,” Associate Vice President for Financial Aid Dan Small said. He added that his office will keep an eye on the proposal.
Nearly 49 million student accounts would gain federal oversight, comprising nearly 70 percent of all non-bank student loans, according to the consumer protection office.
The policy will be under public review for two months before it’s ultimately implemented.
“With student loan debt crossing the trillion-dollar threshold, it’s important to keep an eye on this market to make sure that consumers are being protected,” the office’s student loan ombudsman Rohit Chopra said.
The agency pitched the proposal to address complaints from student borrowers confused about payments, dealing with uninformed servicing personnel and facing roundabout payment processes.
“The CFPB hopes to make progress to make sure that students know before they owe and clearly understand the obligations they are entering when signing up for student debt,” Chopra said. “We also are looking to ensure that borrowers who are repaying their loans are getting the service they deserve.”
Through the first week of April, the government’s consumer protection arm will also collect feedback to draft a proposal to help make payments more affordable for private student loan borrowers. But as bankruptcy laws don’t apply to student loans, the agency is limited in its ability to overhaul the student loan sector.
In coordination with the Department of Education, the consumer finance agency has proposed other initiatives to make students more aware of higher education costs and debt. Last summer, the two agencies collaborated on a shopping sheet to help students compare financial aid offers from various institutions.
While over 500 universities have signed on to the proposal, Small said the University is still mulling the benefits of the standardized document, despite a Student Association resolution urging GW to adopt the tool.

It’s official: Butler and Xavier are leaving the Atlantic 10.
The two schools announced today that they will head to the new Big East, joining Creighton there next season.
“I wish Xavier University and Butler University all the best in their new conference,” A-10 commissioner Bernadette McGlade said in a statement. “They are two outstanding universities with outstanding people; our partnership has been mutually beneficial and successful.”
The new league will begin officially July 1, and the conference has already agreed to a 12-year contract with Fox Sports, while its championship will remain at Madison Square Garden. The move removes two of the A-10’s most successful men’s basketball programs from its ranks and reduces the conference’s profile in the Midwest market.
“As a longtime strong A-10 member, Xavier’s departure is unfortunate. Butler’s departure is a byproduct of the chaotic conference realignment environment,” McGlade’s statement said. “BU’s association with the A-10 has been a fun ride this year; no regrets from the Atlantic 10 for providing a home for them during the 2012-13 season.”
Early exit fees from the A-10 are $2 million for Universities that give the league less than a year’s notice of their departure. Additionally, both Xavier and Butler will likely have to forfeit this year’s postseason revenue. But neither university is fazed, with Butler president James Danko telling ESPN that the Big East is an “ideal fit” for his school.
“It’s an endorsement of who we are,” Xavier president Reverend Michael Graham told ESPN, “and how we’ve gotten here, as well as where we can go next.”
A-10 fans, as well as the league’s remaining schools, are left to watch the conference’s response. Historically, the A-10 has answered program losses due to realignment well: Temple and Charlotte were replaced this season by VCU and Butler.
Athletic director Patrick Nero said in January that the conference was ready to address the potential loss of members should a university leave to join the Catholic 7. The searches for VCU and Butler, he said, resulted in candidates beyond those two programs that could make valuable additions to the league.
He also asked for patience as the league looks to fill the gaps. Without explicitly discussing the pending departure of Xavier and Butler, Nero said that the A-10 was ready to address depletion of its ranks.
“As a conference, we anticipated this move and are prepared to proactively move forward. The A-10 is strong – we have 16 basketball teams participating in the postseason and will focus on them right now,” McGlade’s statement said. “NCAA Postseason is an exciting time not to be overshadowed by conference realignment.”
The onus is now on the A-10 to replace outgoing members with equally strong candidates so the league’s national profile – at an all-time high with nine postseason men’s basketball bids this year – doesn’t suffer a blow.
Butler, which fell in the semifinal round of the A-10 championship to Saint Louis, earned an NCAA tournament bid this season after finishing with a 26-8 overall record. Xavier fell to Saint Joseph’s in the first round of the A-10 tournament this year, failing to advance to postseason play, the first time in seven years it didn’t earn a bid to the NCAA tournament. Last season, the Musketeers traveled to the Sweet Sixteen, but posted a 17-14 overall record this season.
This article was updated March 21, 2013 to reflect the following:
The Hatchet incorrectly stated that athletic director Patrick Nero said in January that the conference would look to address losses if members left for the A-10. The conference would address losses to the Catholic 7. We regret this error.

The last three columns on the scoreboard revealed nearly everything about GW’s performance against Georgetown Tuesday.
Though both teams tallied 10 hits on the day, the Hoyas finished with 10 in the run column compared to the Colonials’ four. The “E” column explained the rest: GW committed five errors compared to Georgetown’s one. Resulting unearned runs, a total of seven, doomed the Colonials before they ever had a chance to recover.
“There was a lack of consistency, lack of focus. We were going in spurts and not playing every pitch, every inning, every at-bat, and every single play,” head coach Gregg Ritchie said. “It’s as simple as that.”
After dropping five of its last six contests, including three out of four to Penn last weekend, the struggling GW team (4-15) returned to Barcroft Park to square off against District rival Georgetown – a winner of five straight. But in its last non-conference game before opening A-10 play, GW came up short again.
The Colonials dug an early hole for themselves, and despite some more evenly matched middle innings, they could not chip away enough of the streaking Hoyas’ lead. GW suffered mental breakdowns but made physical mistakes, too. On one play, miscommunication led to a routine pop up hitting the ground right next to first base. On several others, the left side of the infield botched throws across the diamond.
By the start of the fourth inning, Georgetown had tallied eight runs, six of which came in the third. Take away that one frame, and what turned out to be a six-run game would have hypothetically headed into extra innings.
“We win the game if we play clean baseball and execute simple things,” Ritchie said. “The ability to focus through those innings, especially during the situations when the game is getting closer, we’re just not showing it.”
Though freshman pitcher Luke Olson didn’t open the game with his best stuff on the mound, sharp fielding and run support lacked as well. While Georgetown put the leadoff man on base in the three of the first four innings, the Colonials went down in 1-2-3 fashion in both the first and third. The Hoyas grabbed two runs in the first before GW snagged one of its own in the bottom of the second thanks to an RBI single from freshman catcher Matthieu Robért.
Robért, who finished 3-for-4 on the day with two RBI singles and a solo blast over the left field wall, provided three of the Colonials’ four runs. Ritchie attributed Robért’s success to his “aggression in hitter’s counts,” a trait he hopes more Colonials sluggers will incorporate into their own style.
Though GW’s hitters are walking more and striking out less than last season, of the eight hitters with 50 or more at-bats this year, only one – junior Brookes Townsend – is hitting above .250.
On Tuesday, GW batters went 10 for 38, which equates to a .263 average. Though an improvement on the .243 series average they put up against Penn last weekend, Ritchie knows that as the season goes on, more disciplined at-bats will lead to more hits.
In the final innings against the Hoyas, the Colonials surely could have benefited from a few more base knocks. Two times late in the game, GW failed to come through with two outs and bases loaded. Just one hit in one of those situations could have cracked open the game, especially considering junior pitcher Colin Milon and senior pitcher Brian Derner held Georgetown to two runs in the final six innings.
Ultimately though, the Hoyas held on, getting outs when they needed them most, their pitchers taking care of business when it mattered.
It was a game that many Colonials saw in terms of one inning, the one that drove GW into a seven-run hole. Despite some errors at crucial moments, Robért saw other pieces come together for his team.
“I don’t think we’re playing badly right now. I just think things need to come together a little bit more for us,” Robért said. “The most important game is the next one. We’re looking ahead to the UMass series and we’re ready for the A-10.”
Ritchie is confident that his staff’s coaching style will continue to get the Colonials in shape for upcoming competition, this year and into the future. It’s a no nonsense approach: If one guy messes up, loses focus or doesn’t give his all, then he will be benched.
It’s a philosophy that manifested itself well on Tuesday, when a pitcher was sent to play third base after a previous throwing error from that position.
“I’m not shy. The points will be made. And the culture will be had,” Ritchie said. “And the future is bright for those reasons.”
Barring unplayable field conditions in Amherst, Mass. that could move the series to Barcroft Park, the Colonials will head to Massachusetts this weekend for their first conference series of the season.

The number of faculty positions with a chance at tenure has reached an all-time high this year, as GW looks to lure top scholars with more permanent positions.
Nearly 79 percent of full-time professors this year have or are in line for tenure – a rise bolstered by a 15 percent drop in the number of professors who have no shot at a permanent teaching job, according to data released this month.
The shift away from hiring professors who sign short-term contracts and may focus on more teaching than research signals a heavy financial commitment to recruit top faculty – winding down decades of GW lagging on academic spending compared to competitors.
“I think this reflects this part of this university’s evolutionary pact, in which we are growing the tenure-track faculty. This has been due to very successful hiring in a number of schools,” Provost Steven Lerman said at a Faculty Senate meeting this month.
Lerman said the growth mostly can be explained on a school-by-school basis. For example, he said, the GW School of Business and the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences filled non-tenure track faculty positions with tenure track professors once their contracts ended last year.
The University has also tried to hold colleges in line by requiring in the Faculty Code that 75 percent of full-time faculty slots to be filled by tenure-track professors.
The Graduate School of Education and Human Development and the School of Public Health and Health Services have faced flak from the Faculty Senate over the past decade for failing to bring up the number of tenure track faculty, partially because they have not received sufficient University funding.
As a result, the University’s expenses on academic support has nearly doubled to $549 million over the past decade, according to financial reports.
Executive Vice President and Treasurer Lou Katz said the strategy aligned with the University’s rising ambitions, including committing in its strategic plan $50 million to $100 million to new interdisciplinary faculty positions over the next 10 years.
“Fundamentally, we want to bring the University to a new plateau and we believe by doing this strategy, we will do that. It’s not going to happen in one year, but if you look at it over time, we’re on a good path to that,” he said.
The University also has demanded higher standards from tenured professors as it looks to raise its research profile by increasing the number of external letters of recommendation and more highly scrutinizing published research. Professors can apply for tenure after five years on the tenure track, when a committee of department colleagues will recommend or reject their efforts to deans and the provost’s office.
Each school submitted its wish list of faculty hires to the provost’s office this month.
The number of adjunct professors has also dropped slightly, though part-time teachers still make up about 72 percent of the University’s faculty core.
GW’s focus on bringing in more tenure-accruing professors also bucks a trend in higher education, where the academic workforce has seen its ranks of tenured professors slim by a quarter over the past 35 years.
Nationally, the number of faculty working full-time but off tenure track has risen from 10 percent to 15 percent over that time period, which has had negative implications for budding professors but helped colleges endure troubled finances.
Offering outside scholars the shot at tenure-track positions has also been the University’s best recruiting tool, Dianne Martin, vice provost for faculty affairs, said.
“From a University quality perspective, if we are trying to attract really high quality – particularly new, hot-shot research faculty that will help propel GW higher – we have to be offering them tenure track positions because that’ll make us more competitive,” she said.

Two-thirds of students are unhappy or indifferent toward the selection of actress and alumna Kerry Washington as the Commencement speaker this May, according to an informal survey of 190 students.
Washington, who stars in ABC’s “Scandal” and recently appeared in the Academy Award-winning film “Django Unchained,” is a 1998 alumna and a former member of the Board of Trustees. She will accept an honorary degree before a 20,000-person crowd May 19.
One-third of respondents said they felt “indifferent” toward Washington, who was announced Monday – nearly the same percentage of students who said they were satisfied or very satisfied with the pick.
Washington was a leader in the Department of Theatre and Dance during her time at GW, crafting her own major in performance studies and maintaining ties with her alma mater as she rose to fame, her former professor said.
“Kerry has often said that she particularly appreciated being at GW because she was able to pursue other academic and creative interests along with her passion for theater, dance and music,” said Leslie Jacobson, a professor of theater who chaired the dance and theater department from 1995 to 2008.
Washington is the first GW graduate to keynote Commencement in at least six years, though last year’s speaker, award-winning journalist Brian Williams, also took classes at GW.
The Bronx, N.Y. native earned the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture for her performance in “Ray.” She shared the screen with actor and musician Jamie Foxx in both “Django Unchained” and “Ray.”
Senior Associate Vice Provost and Dean of Students Peter Konwerski worked closely with Washington when she was a member of the Colonial Cabinet in 1995. She was also a member of house staff in Thurston Hall.
“As a student leader, she was a well-respected, talented member of the ensemble, whether performing in CI skits or capably working as a student ambassador, welcoming new students and their families to our campus community,” he said.
Washington now sits on President Barack Obama’s Committee on the Arts and Humanities and is part of a group of advisers for V-Day, a global movement to end violence against women.
She also spoke at last year’s Democratic National Convention, urging fellow Obama supporters to stand up and preserve their rights.
“I think that our [theater, dance and art] students will feel special pride at having such a talented, articulate artist/advocate speaking at graduation,” Jacobson said.
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg sent off the graduating class of 2011, first lady Michelle Obama headlined the event in 2010 and White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel spoke in 2009.

Nearly every fourth-year student in the School of Medicine and Health Sciences nabbed a residency spot Friday, but administrators and lawmakers worry competition will stiffen over the next decade and shut some aspiring doctors out.
Medical school graduates spend three to seven years in hospitals for health care training. Unless Congress increases funding to hospitals, the number of training slots available will tighten as medical colleges boost enrollment and international students flock to the U.S.
“We’re really aware of this issue,” Associate Dean for Administration Scott Schroth said. “There’s still great concern amongst us that this may present a problem for our graduates.”
The school is increasing its focus on advising for students who want to go into competitive residency fields like neurology and anesthesiology. On the national level, Reps. Allyson Schwartz, D.-Pa. and Aaron Schock, R.-Ill., also reintroduced a bill last week calling for more federal funding for residencies.
The squeeze would likely lower GW’s near-perfect placement rate in the future, which sat at 95 percent this year, about the national average. A record 1,097 students nationally got rejected from residency spots this year – a 29 percent increase from the year before.
And it would disproportionately affect popular, high-paying residency specialties that many GW students choose, which are most competitive nationally. Few GW students opted for lower paying specialties with open residencies, like family medicine, instead matching mostly into internal medicine and pediatrics this year.
Only 2 percent of GW fourth-year students will enter into a family medicine residency – an area seeing doctor shortages nationally – despite a bump in interested students last year.
Schroth said the looming problem has not yet negatively affected students, and added that even students who are initially rejected eventually match a year later. But advisers have worked with students who look at more competitive residencies to consider other options because of the squeeze.
“Where we’ve really focused our advising energy and our work with students is particularly on those competitive and smaller fields that are already saturated with U.S. graduates. Those are the areas where we worry more,” he said.
He added that advisers have gotten more “realistic” with students.
“Frankly as we get closer to the end of their senior year, our job is to be direct to them, you know, tell them what will happen with their specialties, you know, given your entire portfolio of work, your academic work, your extracurricular work, service, research,” he said.
Stephen Swank, who secured a anesthesiology residency in Washington state Friday, said students are not yet feeling heavier pressure from the residency squeeze, though that does not calm their nerves.
“People need to be employed after all that training,” Swank said, adding that if the government does not increase funding for residences, then “a smart person probably wouldn’t apply to medical school, but an optimistic one would and cross their fingers.”
The competition is also rising as the number of eligible people for health care grows under the Affordable Care Act. A surge in new medical schools opening is expected to bring in 5,000 more graduates by 2019.
Representatives Schock and Schwartz think the solution lies in about $1 billion in federal dollars a year to create 15,000 new residency slots over the next five years. Their bill in the House of Representatives likely faces an uphill battle as lawmakers battle budget cuts.
“The United States is on the cusp of a crisis in access to both specialty and primary care physicians. We have an urgent need to take action to ensure Americans have access to quality, well trained doctors,” Schwartz said in a statement.
Leonard Marquez, director of government relations for the lobbying group Association of American Medical Colleges, said the problem is larger than just increasing the number of residencies, pointing to the need for new delivery models and team-based care.

When Angela Esquivel was drugged and sexually assaulted during her senior year of college, she longed to erase the experience from her memory.
But the part-time professor realized after entering graduate school that even with counseling and support from loved ones, she could not wipe away her traumatic past. She decided to face it, reaching out to her university’s sexual assault awareness and prevention center and switching her program of study to student affairs.
Esquivel is now an advocate against sexual violence and a member of the Dean of Students office’s crisis response team. She lives in Thurston Hall, and over the last year, pressed for the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act on Capitol Hill and at the White House with an adviser who authored the bill.
“I think it helps me not regret or resent what happened,” Esquivel, who came to GW in 2010, said. “I think a crime like that really involves obviously being disempowered, and so for me, it’s a part of staying empowered and having control over what role this thing is going to play in my life.”
Nearly 20 percent of college women are victims of attempted or actual sexual assaults, according to the Department of Education. But studies have shown that the vast majority of campus sex abuses go unreported. At GW, the number of sexual assault reports totaled 11 in 2010 and 16 in 2011.
President Barack Obama signed the new Violence Against Women Act into law March 7, requiring universities to include instances of domestic violence, dating violence and stalking in their annual security reports. The changes will go into effect for the 2014-2015 academic year.
Another part of the law, the Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act, calls for stricter guidelines for informing victims of their legal rights and strengthening sexual assault prevention policies at colleges and universities.
“As members of the GW community, it should matter to all of us when even one of us goes through something like this,” Esquivel said. “I think students are the key to prevention mattering, because that’s not something that we as administrators can instill necessarily in someone. We can try, but the preventative efforts are so much more impactful and meaningful when they come from the students.”
She said at the press conference that after her assault at the University of Southern California, law enforcement investigators told her they did not believe her attack was severe enough to warrant a criminal case. But Esquivel’s assailant began to stalk her – sending her notes, gifts and flowers – and she was ultimately granted a restraining order.
“But I was the one who had to turn around and walk the other way whenever I saw him on campus,” she said at the conference, adding that by the time her school concluded its own investigation, graduation was approaching and administrators told her it was too late to take action. “My assailant walked across the same stage I did on graduation day.”
Universities are already required to report campus crime under the Clery Act, passed in 1990 to lay out across-the-board rules for compiling crime data and issuing warnings.
The new law also includes rights for groups like Native Americans, immigrants and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.
Esquivel said it was important that Congress not only renew, but also strengthen the law to protect and support survivors of these types of attacks.
“I was feeling like it had been a privilege for me to heal, and there’s something so intrinsically wrong with that. That shouldn’t be a privilege. That should be something that just is – for everyone – and so that’s what this legislation is trying to do,” Esquivel said.
Vice President Joe Biden penned the original law as a Delaware senator in 1994, which gave $1.6 billion toward the investigation of violent crimes against women.
Esquivel said VAWA encouraged her to undergo conflict mediation training at the University of Michigan, where she earned a graduate degree in 2008, and to work as a counselor at the D.C. Rape Crisis Center.
“I think that’s why the passage of VAWA felt so personal. Not just because I had the opportunity to, in some small way, be a part of it – through the press conference or those other lobbying conversations – but I think because I can see what it can do for people,” Esquivel said.
As an activist, Esquivel has witnessed the dialogue surrounding sexual assault evolve to include more populations and cover more types of sexual abuse.
She said she produced a short film during college about sexual violence on campus, and recalls the Department of Justice’s Office on Violence Against Women asking her to remove segments that showed stalking and harassment because the version of VAWA at that time did not cover those issues.
The part-time professor, who teaches human sexuality in the School of Public Health and Health Services, became involved with sexual violence issues on a national level after she signed a petition in support of VAWA. Weeks later, the director of a dating violence prevention organization reached out and asked Esquivel to speak at a press conference.
“It instantly felt bigger than me,” Esquivel said. “I was thinking about the people that I know, and don’t know for that matter, who for whatever reason are not in a place to say yes to something like this even if they wanted to.”
Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., contacted Esquivel – a former constituent – and stood beside her during the press conference.
Esquivel is also the co-founder of the As One Project, a non-profit organization that provides support to family and friends of sexual assault victims.
She has teamed up with Terri Rosenberg, an alumna of Pennsylvania State University, who chose to take on sexual violence issues after the sex abuse scandal at her alma mater surfaced last year.
Tara Pereira, an administrator who oversees GW’s compliance with the discrimination prevention act Title IX, wrote in an email that the As One Project was “a unique approach” to sexual violence on a national scale.
“Angela is asserting herself as a leader in the field of women’s rights, particularly in the violence against women arena. She brings a passion and dedication to this work like few I have seen,” Pereira added.
