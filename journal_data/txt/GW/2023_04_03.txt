Whether they were choked with mold in 2021 or the site of a dramatic renovation last year, GW’s residence halls are students’ home away from home. No matter the name, street or room layout, residence halls give students a place to catch up on homework, hang out with their friends or relax after a long day of lectures. And thanks to a new plan from Campus Living and Residential Education, freshmen should have some extra help navigating their transition to residential college life starting this fall.
CLRE is searching to hire students who will live in GW’s 14 freshman residence halls to organize community events, settle disputes between roommates and design lobbies and bulletin boards for the next academic year. Though likely fewer in number than the resident adviser program the University eliminated in 2021, the new community engagement adviser and assistant positions can connect freshmen to upperclassmen as the University markets its residence halls as community hubs.
The live-in adviser position and the more support-focused assistant position are supposed to aid community coordinators – the professional staffers who plan social events, mediate disputes between residents over shared space and noise complaints and manage GW’s residence halls on a daily basis. But those of us who remember the days of RAs before the COVID-19 pandemic know community coordinators haven’t always connected with students as much as their fellow peers did.
Community coordinators can feel more like a building supervisor or leasing agent than a helpful neighbor down the hall. Other than being a few years apart, a freshman resident and an RA would likely have a lot in common – they’re both GW students, for one. With RAs, students could go to a peer on their floor who might have experienced the same pangs of homesickness, an unfriendly professor or an oddball roommate just a year before. An RA wasn’t just someone you went to if you and your roommate couldn’t agree on how to split your shelves. From one student to another, they were a wealth of advice, expertise and knowledge ready to support campus residents navigate the transition to a more independent adulthood.
Compare that to a community coordinator in their late 20s who has never attended the University before. What do they have in common with a freshman? The dynamic students have with community coordinators is entirely different – they can feel more like an email address or a sign on a door than part of residents’ day-to-day lives. And that makes it harder, albeit not impossible, to foster connections with students.
Maura Kelly-Yuoh | Staff Cartoonist
To community coordinators’ credit, being the first point of contact to address the needs of hundreds of student residents at any hour of the day is no easy task. And GW’s pandemic-era policies constrained the limits of their jobs, restricting students to one guest from their residence hall per room and barring guests from other University residential buildings altogether. All the same, donut and ice cream socials can only go so far to make students feel like they belong at the University, especially freshmen who are away from home and likely sharing their living space for the first time.
RAs functioned as community builders, mentors, friends and even older siblings who could make an otherwise rocky transition to college as smooth as possible. They orchestrated floor-wide late night snack runs, baked batches of cookies after a full day of classes and helped solve roommate conflicts far above their pay grades.
But the burdens student employees faced, which also led RAs to push for a labor union in 2016, is partly why officials discontinued the RA position in favor of community coordinators. RAs had to face uncomfortable, upsetting and even dangerous situations in the course of counseling residents and dealing with noise complaints, sexual assault cases or intoxicated students, then-Vice President of Student Affairs and Dean of Students Cissy Petty said in 2021.
CLRE’s new community engagement advisers and assistants capture the essence of what made the RA program work. Physical proximity to an older, trusted peer could help make freshmen residence halls and GW as a whole more welcoming. Gearing the position toward freshmen is also just good sense – students jumping into the deep end of college life can benefit from a mentor once they move to the Foggy Bottom or Mount Vernon campuses.
And over the past year, it’s been easier than ever to eat, sleep, study and meet with friends all from the comfort of your own home at GW. Officials have tried to redefine the residential experience this school year with new all-you-can-eat dining halls in Shenkman and Thurston halls and extensive renovations to Thurston. And while the crowds of students that patronize and live in these residence halls show how popular they are, a crowd isn’t necessarily a community.
So starting this fall, community engagement advisers and assistants will face the challenge of drawing freshmen out of their rooms – and their cliques – to learn about their peers and GW. With any luck, they’ll be raising high in no time.

Juan Carlos Mora and Adam Galland are representing the Joint Elections Commission in two lawsuits before the Student Court, including one brought by Student Association President Chrisitan Zidouemba. Mora is also the chief counselor to the SA Senate and Galland is the SA’s former legislator general and an opinions writer for The Hatchet.
A president running for reelection was indicted last week, and it’s not who you’re thinking.
The Joint Elections Commission that governs the Student Association’s yearly elections charged and convicted SA President Christian Zidouemba with one count of impersonating another candidate to collect signatures for a candidacy petition last Monday. The JEC’s decision disqualifies Zidouemba from running for president for what would have been the fourth consecutive time and bars him from taking office if elected.
Zidouemba has appealed to the Student Court, asking them to reverse the JEC’s decision, vacate his conviction and reinstate his name on the ballot. We – the chief counselor to the SA Senate and former legislator general – are going to make sure that Zidouemba’s efforts fail.
After the JEC retained us last Wednesday to represent them in three lawsuits – one of which has been settled out of Student Court – related to candidate disqualifications, including Zidouemba’s, and after the past year working with and for him, it has become abundantly clear to us that Zidouemba is an existential threat to the health of GW’s student government. He is wholly unfit to serve as our SA president.
We know this because we’ve spent the past 10 months cleaning up his messes and ensuring that his antics do not compromise the structural integrity of the SA. But they have – with every impulsive and illogical decision Zidouemba has made, he’s desecrated the vision for responsible student government the Board of Trustees set out in the SA’s charter.
Take for instance last November when he overspent money allocated to him for internal executive branch affairs on a catered SA retreat for members. The splurge caused the SA to run a historic executive deficit surpassing $1,000, which cut into funding allocated for events.
And who could forget last May when he thought it would be a good idea to appoint two people to serve as executive chief of staff, which the SA’s constitution prohibits. The move resulted in one of those illegitimate appointees participating in a coup d’etat to oust him, leading to months of SA turmoil that reaffirmed many students’ lack of faith in the SA. We represented him last August when his former chief of staff sued him over this crisis, and we won the case for him. But we’re done defending and excusing Zidouemba’s blatant disrespect of the rule of law and the responsibilities GW students have vested in him.
Zidouemba’s disqualification from the election ballot for SA president is further proof of this reality. His uncertainty over running for reelection put him in an understandably tight spot when he decided to run a matter of days before he needed to submit 385 required signatures to appear on the ballot. But while his predicament was not enviable, he remedied his circumstance by doing what always does when he’s in a bind – barreling ahead without even a glance at what the rules and regulations are, free of any care for the potential consequences.
Make no mistake, despite appealing to the Student Court and playing the role of the aggrieved candidate, Zidouemba bears ultimate responsibility for the instability that is engulfing this year’s elections. The SA bylaws make clear that holding an election is a serious process that requires hard work over a long period of time. The preparation requires meticulous planning of timelines, a swath of advisory opinions that inform how candidates may campaign and due preparation for unexpected complications. That’s why the sitting president is required to appoint a JEC chair nearly a year in advance of an election and appoint the rest of the commission before the end of the school year’s fall semester, giving the JEC ample time to prepare a free, fair and well-run race.
But Zidouemba chose not to do that – the senate did not confirm all members of the JEC until February, a month before elections were set to commence. And when Zidouemba did fill the commission, it was only after months of reminders from the SA’s vice president, the counselors of the senate and Zidouemba’s own staff. Knowing this, is it any surprise that this year’s electoral process has yielded the unprecedented chaos of three separate lawsuits?
Zidouemba’s actions haven’t just hurt his reelection campaign – they hinder the campaigns of every single law-abiding candidate for SA office with unnecessary dither and delay. Let us be crystal clear: Zidouemba is not a victim of the system – our system is a victim of him.
Former presidents of the SA have gone on to lead sovereign nations and trailblazing organizations and advise world leaders. The position is an esteemed tradition of this University dating back to 1909 – a tradition that Zidouemba has failed to honor. His attitudes and actions are inconsistent with those of a respectable leader worthy of reelection.
So while we fight in the Student Court to maintain the rule of law and the stability of the student government, we urge you to do your part. Get out and vote – be the change you want to see in the SA. Vote for whom you believe represents the values and principles that matter to you. Vote for someone who proves themselves empathetic and worthy of stewarding SA advocacy. But above all else, just vote. Leaders like Zidouemba are elected when people don’t participate – his election in 2022 had the lowest turnout rate in a decade.
We, the students of GW, deserve a new SA president who fights for us and our values and respects the rule of law. Together, let’s honor the traditions of student government and allow Zidouemba’s presidency to drift into distant memory.

I was relieved when my then 17-year-old sibling, Sky, came out to me last summer as transgender and nonbinary – after years of feeling uncertain about their gender expression, Sky finally felt like themself.
Assigned female at birth, Sky told me they knew on some level that they weren’t a woman since the fourth grade – they just didn’t have the words to describe their emotions. Now, they know that feeling is called gender dysphoria, an unease caused by a misalignment between someone’s biological sex and gender identity.
Sometimes they wore dresses and skirts – other times, our brother’s lacrosse shorts and backward baseball caps. They played Barbies with me and also chased my brothers around our backyard. They repeatedly struggled to conform to society’s expectations of gender identity. “It was a lot of overcorrection on both sides because I didn’t understand what I was feeling,” Sky explained to me over the phone.
When they started questioning their sexuality last summer, they also questioned their gender presentation. A couple of months after coming out as bisexual, Sky embraced their nonbinary identity – they no longer identify as a woman just because society more readily accepts cisgender people. “I just exist as a person, not necessarily a woman,” Sky told me over FaceTime. To both me and themself, they are simply Sky, and that will always be enough.
As Sky’s older sister and a human being, I have been outraged by the deluge of transphobic laws across the nation and the demonization of transgender people in right-wing media. I am afraid and frustrated at the thought of Sky growing into adulthood with a social climate fighting against who they are.
Since this past summer, at least 11 states – Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, Utah, South Dakota and West Virginia – have enacted laws limiting or banning gender-affirming care for minors, according to Axios. Conservative Christian groups, many of whom fought to push the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, have lobbied local lawmakers and spent millions of dollars to help pass these and other bills that would strip transgender people of their rights.
In Kentucky, the state’s Republican-dominated legislature voted Wednesday to override Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s veto of Senate Bill 150, a bill that restricts what bathrooms transgender youth can freely use in public schools and bars class discussions of sexual orientation and gender identity. The bill also prevents the Kentucky Board of Education or the Kentucky Department of Education from requiring or recommending teachers to use their students’ preferred pronouns, names and identities. My high school in West Chester, Pennsylvania was the first public place my sibling started going by gender-neutral pronouns, and Sky has said that their teachers’ compassion helped ease their transition. Giving teachers free rein to “deadname” students – using their incorrect name or pronouns – will only tear them down.
Kentucky isn’t just making it harder to be a transgender youth in school. Unless organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union successfully sue to stop the law, Kentucky will join at least 10 other states in denying or restricting transgender youth access to gender-affirming health care like surgery, puberty blockers and hormone therapy. These restrictions on health care are set to begin 90 days after Kentucky’s legislature adjourned Thursday. But other sections of the bill have already gone into effect immediately, including those that allow teachers to misgender students, restrict education about human sexuality and institute bathroom bans.
The lack of proper health care for and the social stigmatization of transgender people obstructs trans teenagers from existing as themselves. These bills are not just signs of hate – they are precursors to harm. When I called Sky earlier this week about the risk of denying people gender-affirming health care, they looked at me and said one word, “suicide.” In Kentucky, 59 percent of transgender and nonbinary youth seriously considered suicide, and 24 percent of transgender and nonbinary youth attempted suicide between 2021 and 2022, according to The Trevor Project, an American nonprofit organization focused on preventing suicide among LGBTQ+ youth.
Right-wing media smear campaigns and moral panics against transgender people have only worsened the life-and-death issues facing trans youth. Conservative personalities and politicians have pushed their transphobic agendas in response to the shooting at The Covenant School in Nashville, Tennessee last Monday, where a shooter who police said identifies as transgender killed six people including three children.
Fox News host and professional bigot Tucker Carlson used the shooting, which took place at a private Christian school, to wrongly malign transgender people as being anti-Christian. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., focused on attacking transgender people after the shooting instead of addressing the country’s lax gun laws. And other rhetoric about transgender and nonbinary people has been downright genocidal, threatening the very idea that their identities deserve to exist.
Our politicians and media are failing to stand alongside transgender people, especially after International Transgender Day of Visibility Friday. “I just want to exist as myself, ” Sky told me. Preventing transgender people, especially teenagers, from receiving gender-affirming medical care allows the anxiety, depression and suicide stemming from unaddressed gender dysphoria to continue unabated. This isn’t simply a matter of trans youth being accepted – it’s a matter of them being alive.
Trans and nonbinary youth aren’t confused children or a springboard to push a political agenda. They are part of this generation’s future, and they need protection. They will never be given a chance to become the “future” if politicians and the media refuse to let them be who they are and paint targets on their backs. Trans people deserve to be themselves in private and in public.
I have never seen Sky feel more comfortable in their own skin than when they realized their identity as a nonbinary, trans person – they smile more and visibly appear confident in themselves. Simply put, they’re happy. And that means everything.

President Joe Biden appointed alumna Elana Meyers Taylor late last month to the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness & Nutrition.
President Joe Biden appointed alumna Elana Meyers Taylor late last month to the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness & Nutrition, where she will help advise White House officials to support nutrition and exercise in the country, according to a White House release.
The release states Meyers Taylor – a five-time Olympic bobsled medalist in silver and bronze and the most decorated Black athlete in Winter Olympics history – will work alongside 26 other newly appointed members consisting of current and former professional athletes, sports physicians and nutritionists to encourage accessibility in athletics and promote youth participation in sports. Biden issued an executive order to reinstate the council in 2021 until September 2023 after the White House office went inactive during the second half of former President Donald Trump’s term in office.
Other individuals named to the council include physician Maribel Campos Rivera, whose research focuses on community action projects to encourage healthy habits for children, superstar NBA point guard Stephen Curry and his wife, renowned chef Ayesha Curry. Biden appointed famed Spanish Chef José Andrés, who has previously taught at GW and owns on-campus restaurant Beefsteak, and WNBA star Elena Delle Donne to serve as co-chairs of the council.
Meyers Taylor played on the softball team during her time at GW and won team MVP every season as a dual threat on the hill and at the plate. She studied exercise science and sports management as an undergraduate before graduating in 2007.
GW selected Meyers Taylor last year as the 2022 commencement speaker, and she delivered remarks on the National Mall before the first class to gather for a spring in-person graduation ceremony in three years due to COVID-19. She also received a Master of Tourism Administration from GW in 2011 and an honorary Doctorate of Public Service in 2018.
Meyers Taylor was GW’s first recruited softball athlete, and she graduated leading the Colonials in nearly every offensive category, starting all 52 games of her senior season. As an Olympics hopeful in 2007, she tried out for the USA Softball Team but did not make the squad.
Her career in bobsledding began in 2007 with a visit to Lake Placid, New York, the home of the U.S National Bobsled Team, a year after she graduated from GW.
In 2015, she made history as the first woman to acquire a position on the U.S. National Team, joining a four-man bobsled as a pilot.
Meyers Taylor has worked to promote equality in women’s sports with the Women’s Sports Foundation, and she served as the president of the foundation in 2019, traveling the United States speaking with other female athletes and promoting gender equality in athletics.
Meyers Taylor was elected last August to be an athlete representative on the Board of Directors for the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee and serves on the Georgia Council for Developmental Disabilities, which works to facilitate inclusive environments to those with developmental disabilities.

The Columbian College of Arts and Sciences LGBT Health Policy and Practice Program hosted the online event, titled “Talking it Through: Engaging Professional Colleagues to Address Transphobia, Bias and Misinformation.”
A clinical psychologist discussed addressing transphobia and bias in the workplace at a virtual event Monday.
Kori Bennett – a clinical psychologist specializing in gender and gender-affirming care who works in Columbia University’s health services organization, Columbia Health – presented studies on transphobia and strategies to combat workplace transgender bias and discrimination. The Columbian College of Arts and Sciences LGBT Health Policy & Practice program hosted the online event, the third edition of their Spring Colloquium Series – a lecture series with a focus on health issues in the LGBTQ+ community.
Bennett said learning the histories of organizations and their power structures helps build knowledge on how to navigate the workplace as trans people.
“In terms of trauma, and then just general histories, what has our experience been and what are we coming into this new organization or role or conversation with?” Bennett said.
Bennett said finding supportive colleagues who are directly involved with workplace policies and structures can help address transphobia and bias in a work environment, like university IT staff who handle electronic medical records, which can hold sensitive information related to trans people’s personal health. They also said communicating with colleagues within the field can be a workplace support source for trans people.
Bennett also reviewed different studies relating to transphobia that examined relationships between transphobia and knowledge of trans issues, like health care professionals “lack of awareness” of trans people. Bennett said it was vital to discuss event attendees’ ideas and experiences after the presentation to understand their backgrounds and solutions to navigating their own workplaces.
“I’m hoping that folks will share and be open and also to take the learning with us without necessarily sharing or repeating what other folks have brought to the conversation knowing that this can be really sensitive and challenging work that we’re all doing,” Bennett said.

Student leaders said they intend to incorporate traditions from Ramadan into the organization’s kickoff for members who celebrate.
Steam from a dish of kabuli pulao, the national Afghan dish consisting of rice with raisins, carrots and meat, wafted through Duquès Hall 451 at the Afghan Student Union’s inaugural interest meeting last Monday.
More than 20 students attended the event virtually and in person, where the three-person executive board discussed plans to spend their first month since registering as a student organization in February partnering with local charity-based nonprofits to fundraise for Afghan refugees in need of financial support. Student leaders said the student union intends to serve as a unifying force among Afghan refugees in D.C., Maryland and Virginia and students on GW’s campus as they develop into an established community presence in Foggy Bottom.
Freshman and co-president Shugoofa Agha said ASU will work to recruit more members this semester by promoting meetings and events through social media and reaching out to friends to expand their executive board. To kick off their launch on campus, members said they plan to incorporate traditions from Ramadan, an Islamic holy month of fasting and reflection observed between March 22 and April 20 this year, into the student organization’s programming for members who celebrate. 
Oranus Yaqubi, another co-president and a freshman studying biology, said one of the group’s priorities is to collect donations for Afghan refugees with the help of nonprofits after more than 6,000 Afghan refugees arrived in the DMV area following the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Afghanistan. The Department of Homeland Security housed refugees for less than a month in Virginia’s National Conference Center in Leesburg while they obtained U.S. work authorizations after evacuating Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital. 
Yaqubi said she became interested in donating to Afghan refugees transitioning to life in D.C. after she volunteered at a local refugee camp in Virginia through the Afghanistan Youth Relief Foundation between August and December 2021. She said the camp provided refugees with medical treatment, clothing and essential supplies.
“We’re so far away from their homes and also Afghans in Afghanistan right now who are going through trouble,” she said. “I feel like this organization gives us an opportunity to connect with those people on a bigger level and not just donate as one person but donate as an organization.”
Yaqubi said she wants to host cultural events to get the Afghan community and other interested peers involved in the student organization and expand the events to collaborate with George Mason University’s Afghan Student Union, which hosted a cultural event called Majlesi that featured dancers, henna art and traditional clothing early last month, and bring a similar event to GW.
Yaqubi said she found out about the former Afghan Student Association – a group that was active in advertising educational and philanthropic events since 2011 until their last social media post in 2021 – in 2016 when she saw them host a fundraiser at the Afghan mosque she grew up attending in Alexandria, Virginia. She said she was inspired to work with Agha, her co-president, to form a community after she found out the previous Afghan organization was discontinued.
“I saw it was inactive, and it was something I had in the back of my mind,” she said. “And then when I met Shugoofa before, we kind of talked about it, like, ‘We need to get this done as soon as possible to be able to have our community starting freshman year.’”
Bahar Agha – a member studying nursing as part of a 1.5-year accelerated bachelor’s degree program – said she wants to build relationships with Afghan students at GW through the student union after growing up in Arlington alongside her sister, Shugoofa Agha, with little exposure to fellow Afghans her own age.
“It’s just kind of nice, now being a University student, to be able to connect with other students who are also Afghan, kind of relate to them and share in our struggles,” Agha said.
Sophomore Hajera Hayat, a member of the student organization studying public health, said she heard about the group through a mutual friend and became interested in joining because few people shared her Afghan ethnicity growing up in Fairfax, Virginia. She said she wants to get involved in upcoming events that board members mentioned in the meeting like fundraising for women and children in Afghanistan and conducting language workshops to talk about various languages that address and celebrate the country’s ethnic diversity.
“I’m excited to do it outside of that, especially since the club is just starting but with Ramadan and everything like volunteer opportunities, just being involved, I’m just excited to be here,” Hayat said.
Sear Rassoly, a senior and member of the student organization studying information technology, said he considered starting an Afghan student organization in his first two years at GW but held back because he could not find enough Afghan students on campus to join. 
He said he is “proud” of the freshmen for creating this space for Afghan students during their first year at GW. 
Rassoly said he hopes the student union will grow to include the many people coming into Virginia from Afghanistan as well as students from broader Asian communities on campus so the GW community becomes more aware of these diasporas. 
A total of 11,742 Afghan refugees arrived in Virginia between 2001 and 2021, according to a 2021 U.S. News & World Report analysis. For every 100,000 residents, there were about 136 resettlements – federal approval of refugees’ permanent residence, the analysis shows.
“I have more hope for these people because they just got to GW,” Rassoly said. “If they are able to create this type of event, hopefully they could do something more or organize bigger events and support more Afghan people in Afghanistan and in Virginia or all over the place.”
Rassoly said until the interest meeting, he felt he was “the only Afghan guy at GW” because he had no classmates or peers that shared his Afghan heritage. When he heard students were organizing the new group, he monitored the organization’s progress in excitement.
“I really want this community to grow more, especially these freshmen students,” Rassoly said. “If they have more friends to come over and join them, it’s going to be a good community.”
