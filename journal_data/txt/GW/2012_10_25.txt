I remember sitting down to work on my GW application, trying to decide which school to apply to. At that point, I didn’t know whether I wanted to study international affairs or engineering.
And to be honest, I’m still deciding.
But with the strategic plan, which outlines GW’s academic strategy for the next decade, students will have the freedom to apply to the University as a whole, rather than picking from individual undergraduate colleges.
Let’s face it: Most undergraduates have no idea what they want to study when they come to college. And this approach would give those still unsure a chance to explore different courses and make decisions later in their GW career.
By reducing the pressure for students to choose a specialization before they’ve even been admitted to GW, the plan will give undergraduates more flexibility.
The problem with having to apply to specific schools is that there is more pressure to declare your major track early. But if students just apply to GW, they aren’t pigeonholed into one field of study.
Under the new model, students would have time to decide and weigh their options. As a freshman who has yet to declare a major, I understand the pressure of having to apply to school without knowing exactly what I was interested in. Going forward, students won’t be forced to make hasty decisions.
And this idea of having students apply to GW as opposed to its specialized schools isn’t just an admissions decision. It will also play a role for students in the classroom.
University leaders want to encourage collaboration and foster a cross-disciplinary culture in which all students can benefit by uniting them under a single core curriculum.
Some have suggested that this system would undermine the prestige of some of GW’s colleges, such as the nationally ranked Elliott School of International Affairs and the School of Media and Public Affairs.
But with this new University initiative, students will be able to understand how different subjects are interconnected rather than being confined to one discipline or course of study. More collaboration between these schools would expand the scope of a GW degree, and it would help prepare us for the world outside college, where collaboration between disciplines is a common practice.
In the past, GW has created a culture of insularity among the five colleges and departments. In the past decade, the Elliott School has emerged as one of the top 10 international affairs schools in the country.
We have become a University that is perceived as being good at only a handful of areas, but this new organization and interdisciplinary focus can change that trend. It demonstrates the University’s commitment to the wide array of disciplines taught on campus every day.
Under the new model, we would be not only members of our individual schools, but also part of a single, cohesive intellectual community.
And that’s a model we can all get behind.

As caller-IDs become the norm and more people ditch landlines for cell phones, the fundraising game is getting tougher for the University’s student-run call center.
Student staff at Colonial Connection sit in cubicles for 20 hours a week, cold calling parents and alumni to solicit donations. But over the last fiscal year, the call center has raised $500,000 – a 30 percent dip from the year before, while online donations increased 50 percent, reaching nearly $1 million for fiscal year 2012.
On good days, the call center is noisy – with students chatting about the soon-to-be Science and Engineering Hall or the 10-year strategic plan. Calls are answered about 25 percent of the time, and about 40 percent of those who pick up end up donating.
Still, Colonial Connection’s figures this fall are down $20,000 compared to this time last year, offset by a 75 percent jump in online giving this fall. Donors have given $200,000 online as of this week.
While the office brings in only about 5 percent of GW’s annual donations, director of annual giving Rebecca Trump said, the calls bring in more new donors than any other method.
“If you have not been engaged with the University for years and you pick up the phone and there is a smart, articulate GW student on there talking about all of the great things that have been going on campus since you were here, that is much more compelling than getting a letter that you might toss in the trash,” Trump said.
Last year, 1,300 donors made their first gift through Colonial Connection. While mailed-in funds – which totaled nearly $1.2 million last year – continues to outpace gifts by phone, the average size of each gift that comes by letter is much lower.
As the University grows its fundraising staff and develops new ways to reach out to donors – like giving out grants to student organizations to invite alumni to campus events – it is maintaining a focus on its telephone-trained student sales force. Efficiency has also been a focus for the Division of Development and Alumni Relations, which began tracking the amount it spends to raise each dollar a few years ago. The University’s fundraising chief said last month that his office spends 21 cents for each dollar raised – which totaled a record-breaking $120 million last year.
More than 50 students now work at Colonial Connection, which has changed locations more than once in the last few years to fit more callers. The student employees make a minimum of $10.50 an hour – with bonuses ranging from $50 to $100 over a semester– and receive training to improve their communication skills.
The challenge is reaching younger alumni through the traditional calling method, which Trump said is also a struggle for college fundraisers across the country. While recruiting new donors is a constant goal for the office, callers are also tasked with maintaining older relationships. The majority of those who give over the phone are not first-time donors.
“New donors are less likely to pick up the phone than somebody who has been giving to GW for years and feels connected to the University when they are looking at caller ID,” Trump said. “It is a struggle, and it is going to continue to be a struggle. That’s no secret.”
The University has pulled in more than $1.8 million in annual gifts so far this year, which Trump said put the office on track to reach the $11 million of annual gifts brought in last year.
Organizations nationally are having a harder time drawing in donations through phone calls, Holly Hall, a reporter for the Chronicle of Philanthropy, said. Still, most organizations agree that phone calls are a better way to connect with potential donors than email or postal mail, and many continue to rely on the more traditional method, which is most effective among prospective elderly donors, she said.
But fundraisers are increasingly adding digital components, like text messaging and social media, on sites like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, to their efforts to catch hard-to-reach donors. Organizations are stressing strategy, calling only donors who have already expressed interest, or crafting persuasive pitches to engage the person on the other line, to make the most of each call, according to a September report from the Chronicle of Philanthropy.
Fundraising has been a top goal for University President Knapp since he came to GW in 2007 looking to reduce the school’s tuition dependency and use gifts to build up its financial footing.
Student staff at Colonial Connection receive scripts to introduce themselves, and they work to engage the person on the other end of the line. But each conversation takes its own turn, callers said. Sometimes a student informs alumni about University programs and events, like Alumni Weekend, and sometimes they strike up a conversation about their GW experience.
“I can gain insight from alumni. It was great to hear feedback from people that have been through what I have been through,” Kat Marchione, a senior at GW and a senior manager at Colonial Connection said.

When a beer can was hurled at Marina Streznewski’s husband as he was walking on the street near their home, she decided to take action.
The 54-year-old Foggy Bottom resident is banding together with other University neighbors to combat what they call the “increasingly rowdy behavior” of several students living off campus – a problem she and others said has reached its worst level in years.
“We are residents that live here 52 weeks around the year and are no longer willing to tolerate this kind of behavior,” Streznewski said. “Even neighbors that have more of a ‘live and let live’ philosophy think that enough is enough and something must be done.”
Streznewski, who has lived in Foggy Bottom for the last 11 years and attended GW in the 1970s, said most students, including the group of seniors who live next door to her on New Hampshire Avenue, are not disruptive. But the disorderly student-neighbors have gotten more egregious.
“There has always been the occasional nonsense, but the frequency and intensity of parties this year are very aggressive,” she said.
In an email chain on the Foggy Bottom community listserv Monday, local residents compiled a list of townhouses rented by students in the western part of the neighborhood – between 24th and 26th streets and down I Street and New Hampshire Avenue.
They hope that by mapping out where students live and handing over the outline to the University, officials will take a more authoritative and proactive approach to quelling neighborhood disturbances.
University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard said the off-campus townhouses are under the jurisdiction of Metropolitan Police Department – not the University Police Department – but that the forces work together when necessary.
“GWPD’s role in the surrounding neighborhood is to represent the university and to ensure students are being held accountable for their actions in compliance with the GW Code of Student Conduct,” Sherrard said in an email.
She added that the University “engages in ongoing discussions with its neighbors” and directed neighbors to share their concerns through UPD’s Community Concern Hotline, though neighbors have complained that the response rate to their calls is slow.
The department has responded to 76 neighborhood concerns, mostly noise complaints, so far this calendar year – 10 fewer than throughout 2011.
A 70-year-old resident who asked to remain anonymous said some houses in the Foggy Bottom area – a handful out of about 250 townhouses in the neighborhood – are closely watched by the community because of occupants’ boisterous behavior. He said neighbors have witnessed young people vandalizing property and cursing and drinking in public, and many have complained that loud music and noises woke them up in the early morning hours.
He said he has regularly met with University officials over the last “six or seven” years, but that GW does not always continue the same preventative measures – like nightly patrols that were nixed two years ago – from year to year.
“They really are not dealing proactively with the problem,” he said. “The University police does some patrols, but not with the notions needed to minimize the problems.”
He said the group has looked into Georgetown University’s policies about off-campus student behavior, which he called “much more retroactive and proactive.”
Georgetown University requires student who live off campus to attend an orientation program about proper neighbor etiquette and learn how to live “safely and responsibly off campus,” according to the school’s off-campus student life office website. Students who do not participate could be held back from class registration or face student conduct violations.
A large number of townhouses surround Georgetown University – meaning that students and permanent residents more often live next door to each other than in Foggy Bottom, sometimes causing clashes.
Disgruntled Georgetown neighbors urged the city in June 2011 to draft legislation for the school to house all students in university-owned housing, either on or off campus, after a spike in off-campus related disturbances and behavior problems.
Another Foggy Bottom resident who also asked to remain anonymous for privacy reasons said some neighbors give out brochures to GW students who move into off-campus townhouses. The 15-year resident added that information packets from the Office of Community Relations, detailing how to take out trash and be a respectful neighbor, have proved ineffective.
Local residents do not want to come off as an angry mob of local residents and push students away from the neighborhood, she said.
“We love living in a diverse neighborhood,” she said. “But we realize there is a problem this year, and we are coming together as a team, investigating, researching, trying to figure out how to deal with this problem.”

GW asked city court last week to throw out a housekeeping employee’s $1.3 million lawsuit alleging that a University Police officer harassed and discriminated against her.
Housekeeping employee Rebecca Ashitey filed a complaint Sept. 1, claiming an officer discriminated against her on the basis of race and gender for five months and then assaulted her last October. The University claimed Ashitey’s case should not stand because she failed to follow the proper protocol for filing a lawsuit.
Ashitey sent her complaint to the incorrect address, and then, when correcting the mistake, sent an incomplete complaint that was not in line with the city’s regulations, according to GW’s court response.
She sent a preliminary complaint to the assistant general counsel for the Medical Faculty Associates – located on the Foggy Bottom Campus but independent from the University, according to the response. She sent an amended version Sept. 26 to the University’s Senior Vice President and General Counsel Beth Nolan, but the complaint was sent via email, lacked a signature and did not summon a response from GW.
“To be effective service of process, the requisite papers must be signed and received by an appropriate party,” the documents read. University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard declined to comment on Ashitey’s complaint and GW’s call to drop the case because the litigation is still pending.
Ashitey, a citizen of Ghana and resident of Alexandria, Va., worked 5 a.m. to 2 p.m. shifts in the Marvin Center since she began working for GW in 2001.
Starting in May 2011, Ashitey said in her complaint, she faced an “endless barrage of questions” from an officer – identified in the complaint as J. Cates – at the building’s entrance before being allowed to enter. She said she was asked her name, social security number, date of birth and GWorld identification number upon arriving to work each day.
She also claims the officer assaulted her on Oct. 17, 2011 when she tried to pass him to enter the building for her shift.
He allegedly “attacked her from behind and threw her to the ground,” according to the complaint. Other UPD officers allegedly arrived on scene and handcuffed her.
Following the incident, Ashitey visited GW Hospital for “intense pain” and missed 12 weeks of work to undergo physical and emotional therapy, according to the complaint. Ashitey and her attorney, John Davis, did not return multiple requests for comment.
Jonathan Puth, an attorney specializing in employment discrimination and harassment lawsuits, said employers typically try to dismantle cases of harassment allegations before the lawsuits make any ground.
“A motion to dismiss is an effort to knock the case out at the very earliest stage to save money and difficulty with going forward in litigation,” Puth said. “By motion to dismiss, GW would be alleging even if everything the plaintiff says is true, is true, then it would not be a violation of law in any event.”

Students and faculty in the Elliott School of International Affairs say one of the signature proposals in the University’s strategic plan may hurt its admissions prospects and push away applicants.
The idea to admit undergraduates to the University as a whole instead of to specific colleges is aimed at creating a stronger University-wide experience, but some say it would diminish students’ focuses on specific areas of study by delaying entry to programs by one or two years.
The highly ranked Elliott School is one of the few schools devoted to foreign affairs in the country, with many students looking to hone in on a specific field their freshman year. Its undergraduate program ranked No. 9 in Foreign Policy magazine’s most recent list of top international affairs programs – ahead of other GW programs like business and engineering, which were ranked No. 37 and No. 85 respectively by U.S. News & World Report this year.
The proposal, like all ideas pitched in the draft of the 10-year strategic plan earlier this month, will be scrutinized by faculty, alumni and students before it is finalized in February. If approved, the restructuring of GW’s admissions process would likely not happen for another two or three years.
Driving away students who have a narrow interest in international affairs could be an “inadvertent effect” of the proposal if it’s not implemented carefully, professor of economics and international affairs Michael O. Moore said.
Yvonne Captain-Hidalgo, director of the Elliott School’s master of international policy and practice program, said the change could push away incoming undergraduates who “come here looking for something specific.”
“I think a potential upside would be for an individual student if they have no sense of direction, but I don’t see that being the case for the majority of students,” she said.
While the Elliott School was about 1 percent less selective than the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences and the GW School of Business last year, its incoming freshman class had slightly higher average SAT scores – 1310 compared to 1290 and 1280, respectively and the program is ranked higher nationally in its field.
Michael Brown, dean of the Elliott School, did not return request for comment about whether the school was on board with proposal. Through a spokeswoman, he said in an email statement that the strategic plan is “innovative and bold.”
University spokeswoman Taylor Tibbetts said no Elliott School administrator was available for further comment.
Senior Christopher Longman, chairman of GW’s International Affairs Society, said an informal survey sent out to its members showed nearly all of 20 respondents thought the change would have an adverse impact on the Elliott School.
“The system’s not broke – I don’t know why we’re changing it,” Longman said.
Senior Kelsey Gann, president of GW’s chapter of the foreign service sorority Delta Phi Epsilon, said that entering the Elliott School at the outset of her GW career carried tangible benefits.
“I applied to GW because I knew I wanted to study international affairs, and GW gave me a chance to start directly on that path as a freshman,” she said. “One of Elliott’s strengths is the focus and dedication of students from the moment they arrive. I am afraid under the new plan that might change.”
Provost Steven Lerman, who has led the formation of the strategic plan, said earlier this month that he knew this proposal would have its critics.
He said he’s heard concerns ranging from curriculum concerns for engineers to deterring students specific interests away from the individual schools.
“Those people who express those concerns want to be assured that we’re thinking through all the pathways that all our students want to take to make sure they get the preparation they need, so they have those options, so they don’t have to take extra time in school,” he said.
The proposal also would help create an opening for more GW-wide courses like University Writing that would teach a common core curriculum for all undergraduates, like the G-PAC requirements do for Columbian College of Arts and Sciences students.
“The delicate balance is making sure that all those options are available, but students feel they already have the flexibility of being in a single university that’s together instead of being in separate sub universities or schools,” Lerman added.
The University will likely go to great lengths to implement the plan if it’s approved. Administrators are searching for a new vice provost of budget and finance who would help reshape create financial incentives for schools to work together.
Shawn McHale, associate professor of history and international affairs, said he liked the proposal, but pointed to logistical hurdles the admissions change could present. He added that schools would need to get over arguing over budget matters for this plan to work.
“I’d imagine you’re going to have uncertainty initially, because as it’s implemented, you’ll have students floating across schools, and some classes that will be way oversubscribed and some not,” McHale said.  “I’m not saying I’m opposed to this model, but the transition to this future model is going to have teething problems.”
Henry Nau, a political science and international affairs professor, said the plan would have to be executed with “finesse” and “without penalizing schools,” especially the Elliott School, which he said fueled the rise of the University’s undergraduate enrollment, diversity and test scores over the past decade.
“One out of five students at GW is an Elliott School major. The Elliott School has been one of the big engines pulling this train,” he said.

Dzhalal Agakishiev isn’t a morning person. His trek to chemistry class, in the torrential downpour before the sun came up Friday morning, was a bit of a slog.
At 7 a.m., he rode 20 minutes down the orange line to West Falls Church, Va. Then Agakishiev waited 25 minutes at a bus stop that hardly provided shelter from the rain, before taking a 45-minute shuttle trip to reach the freshman dean’s seminar, “A Pathway to a Renewable Chemical Economy.”
“We should get half credit just for getting there,” he said.
He’s one of four students taking a rare undergraduate class on the Virginia Science and Technology Campus – 120 acres in Ashburn, Va., mostly used by graduate students and researchers, with an hour-long commute from Foggy Bottom. The campus has been a mainstay for graduate programs in nursing, business, engineering and education, as well as research centers like transportation safety, since it opened in 1991.
The four students tried to make use of the trip by reading over last week’s lab or tilting their heads back for a quick power nap, their earbuds muffling the shuttle’s revving engine along the Virginia highway.
“I think we spend more time traveling than in actual class,” freshman Taylor Smyth said, gulping down coffee on the shuttle ride out to Loudoun County.
But the freshmen, all leaning toward becoming political science majors, have a bright outlook on what many would call a highly inconvenient class.
The students were unaware that the class would include a biweekly Friday lab on the Virginia campus when they registered, but they said it hasn’t dampened their experience – or prevented them from going out on Thursday nights.
“They sold [the class] to us and then they were like, ‘Okay, so here’s the deal, we can do the labs here, but they won’t be as cool, or we could do them in Virginia.’ They didn’t tell us how far the campus would be,” Mathew Michanie said.
Michanie raved about the hands-on lab in the green-focused class that uses solar panels and ultraviolet lights to teach students about the chemical components of climate change and sustainability. His morning commute begins even earlier than that of the other students – he first takes a shuttle from the Mount Vernon Campus to Foggy Bottom before hopping on the Metro.
“I’ve always been interested in environmental studies, and this [class] is an extension on that to a whole other degree, and it takes a perspective that I have never seen before in my life,” Michanie said. “It is really chemistry-heavy, but they put it into terms that you understand.”
Chemistry professor Stuart Licht said the class is one of the only courses offered on sustainable economy at any university across the country – making use of technology not available on most campuses, like solar panels.
Licht said he hopes the University will add more shuttles to the campus so students can have a smoother commute when the course is offered again next fall. He hopes 20 students will sign up.
Their lab was performed in Exploration Hall, one of the four buildings that dot the campus.
The travel time and the course’s 8:30 a.m. start time have prompted some improvisation by Licht and his two teaching assistants, who pointed out that because the class is so small, they don’t mind waiting around for anyone who runs late after missing a component of the commute.
Jessica Stuart, a teaching assistant, recalled one time when a student missed the shuttle and rushed into a cab to get to class. The department later reimbursed him.
Rain prevented students from working with the campus’ solar panels on Friday. Instead, the class donned special sunglasses to protect them against the intense ultraviolet lights that can mimic the sun’s energy potential – a bright wake-up call before their naps during the shuttle ride back to Foggy Bottom.

Tommy DeVries spent his four-year GW career trying to land a job working for the band Shiny Toy Guns.
After graduating last spring, he finally got a gig as the leader of the satellite marketing team for the Los Angeles-based rock band. But his application process was not a traditional one.
DeVries discovered Shiny Toy Guns, whose 2006 debut album “We Are Pilots” garnered a Grammy nomination, at a concert near his hometown of Rhinebeck, N.Y. while in high school.
“After I saw that concert, I was like, ‘These people are the coolest ever,’ ” DeVries said. “Every time I’ve been to their concert, I’ve loved their music more. I’ve loved the album they’ve been touring for more, all of their opening bands more and I fell in love with their music, and it became such a big part of my life.”
After his second Shiny Toy Guns concert – the one he attended as a freshman – DeVries applied for a position on the band’s D.C. marketing team. He said his application was rejected because of his weak social media presence. So he quickly increased his usage of every platform.
“I kept hitting them up every few months trying to be like, ‘Hey, I have more Twitter followers, or I have a bigger Facebook page and my Instagram is cooler – I would like to become part of your team.’ And they just wouldn’t get back to [me],” DeVries said.
He was then told to promote the band’s singles through his social media accounts and took on the challenge, blasting his social media accounts with updates on the band.
Last month, four years after he began pursuing a marketing position with the band, DeVries was added to the D.C. satellite team and quickly progressed to the team leader slot.
He is now responsible for piecing together a team of volunteers and interns to create buzz around the band, specifically among GW students, and promote upcoming performances, such as an Oct. 29 show at the Rock and Roll Hotel to publicize the band’s most recent album, “III,” which was released this month.
“It’s fun. I know I’m a psych major, but I like to talk I like to promote things. I like to get information out there. I would literally do anything for these guys,” DeVries said.
He will formally be introduced to the band after that concert.
“I was completely blown away by [that],” DeVries said. “Sheer euphoria is how I feel.”
The job comes with one drawback: It’s unpaid. He supplements his work for Shiny Toy Guns with a full-time job as an executive assistant to alumnus Kris Hart, a local entrepreneur who owns FoBoGro and Relaxed Tanning & Day Spa on F Street.
“One of Tommy’s greatest strengths is marketing. He’s very good at marketing,” Hart said.
DeVries has recruited one student intern so far from GW, and is looking to expand the team. He also hopes to create similar teams at other universities.
“That would be something I would feel good about, because my passion for it is big,” DeVries said. “This is a band that needs to be known by many, many other people.”

It’s been six months since Jonathan Tsipis became the ninth head coach of the women’s basketball program.
In that time, he’s worked to bring his championship-winning approach from Notre Dame to Foggy Bottom, meeting the 13 players who will suit up under him this season, immersing himself in the culture and history of the Colonials program, crafting a staff and beginning to recruit for the future.
It’s no wonder that the new head coach calls his time at GW leading up to the 2012-13 season a “whirlwind.”
“A big part of what we’re trying to do here, like everybody, is just that bonding and understanding that we’ve got to get better on a daily basis,” Tsipis said in a telephone conference call Wednesday. “From everything basketball-wise to a leadership standpoint, to how we conduct ourselves in the weight room and
 conditioning, to the classroom – everything has been set at a higher expectation because of the great tradition that we’ve had here.”
In a preseason poll of the Atlantic 10 head coaches, the Colonials were picked to finish eighth of 16 in the league. Last year, the team was tabbed to finish ninth of 14 in the conference.
Last season, GW was bounced in the first round of the A-10 tournament by Duquesne, continuing a four-year program slide that hasn’t seen the Colonials win a postseason game since 2008. Tsipis is regarded as a coach who will be able to turn the team around and guide it back to the heights it reached under former head coach Joe McKeown.
The other coaches in the A-10 have been “gracious” in their welcome, Tsipis said Wednesday. As he prepares to enter Atlantic 10 competition, in which GW will begin its league play at the end of a four-game road swing, the new head coach is aware of the unique identity the conference brings to competition.
“It’s a conference that I think has a little bit of a chip on its shoulder right now. It goes in year in and year out and beats BCS programs, and basketball is important, I think, at each of the 16 schools,” Tsipis said. “And I think you see some conferences in the country where that’s not true. I’m excited.”
If GW is good, Tsipis added, it will inherently help to raise the profile of the A-10. And Tsipis has always wanted to be a head coach in a successful program – one that’s victorious on the court and also emphasizes player development off the court.
Among the Colonial players who exemplify the qualities Tsipis strives for are graduate student forward Tara Booker and senior point guard Danni Jackson, who were both named to the A-10 preseason third team Wednesday, and who tied for the team lead in scoring average at 12 points per game.
They’re a core component of the senior contingent that Tsipis said is proving helpful in demonstrating flexibility in working with new coaches and game plans.
Booker paced GW in rebounding, blocks, field goal percentage, three-point field goals made and three-point percentage. Jackson had a team-high 3.0 assists per game last year, and her .857 free throw percentage was the fourth-best single-season mark in program history.
“We really have 13 freshmen,” Tsipis said. “And because everybody is learning things from a different way – whether it’s different terminology I use or my staff uses, and just how we go about our business – it’s just different than [how] they’ve gone through it in the past.”
For Tsipis, this season represents the beginning of a new journey – one in which he is excited to see the program’s potential.
“I challenge them with their legacy,” Tsipis said. “That I expect us to be competitive and for us to be good and for us to do it this year. But it has to start with the understanding of that they kind of have to wipe the board clean of a lot of things and be willing to try new things.”

Being a “Washington insider” comes with quite a stigma these days.
In politics, it means you have become so embroiled in D.C. minutiae that you’ve lost sight of what really matters in America.
But being a Washington insider is an insult for another reason, too. According to the rest of the country, we’re unattractive, poorly dressed boring people who think a night of fun is riding the Metro all the way out to New Carrollton, Md. just to watch it turn around.
GQ Magazine’s November issue highlighted this, giving makeovers to eight Capitol Hill employees and chiding the fact that, in D.C., “blousy shirts and ill-fitting suits are what pass for fashion.”
At which point the magazine proceeds to dress these men in skinny jeans so tight that their blood circulation appears strained.
Forbes Magazine recently named D.C.’s H Street corridor the sixth-best “hippest hipster” neighborhood in the country, which drummed up so much pushback that you’d think an actual political scandal had broken out.
And then there’s the adage. The one that makes me wince every time a family friend or TV pundit says it.
“Washington is the Hollywood for ugly people.”
First of all, that was funnier about the first 50 times I heard it. Second, it’s not true anymore. D.C. is a fun city with hot people and hip potential, and I’m here to tell you why.
Now, for disclosure’s sake, I should probably own up to my own weaknesses when it comes to being cool. Namely, I’m not. I once had dinner with a famous neuroscientist for my birthday, and I only recently started coming around to podcasts.
But D.C. has a culture that pulses through each neighborhood. And it continues to grow and change as different people move into different areas of the city. From festivals and little cinemas screening indie flicks, to lectures, pop-up flea markets and DC Brau, this city is more than Hillterns and lobbyists.
It’s also growing as a city that cultivates cool.
The tech world is thriving in D.C., and the emergence of some notable District-based startups has drawn people who would otherwise take root in Silicon Valley or New York. The city is also increasingly becoming home to young people. A DC Neighborhoods profile attributed the District’s rapid population growth to the staggering number of young professionals here.
This might make way for competitive child rearing and even more farmers markets down the road, but right now it means more bars, more concert halls and more places where we young people can just be young.
As for D.C. being full of ugly people, it’s just not true. The District was ranked the second healthiest city this year by the American College of Sports Medicine – just another benefit of being young and active.
It also means the culture of the city is turning away from one of Beltway neighbors who flood the city during the week and leave it a ghost town during evenings and weekends. D.C. is a town that is known for its happy hours and bottomless brunches all week long.
And we’ve got a weapon most conventionally cool cities don’t have going for them: If we’re nerdy, we embrace it – but with style. Outsiders like to throw shade because they think they understand this city, but D.C. is the only place where you can party at the Newseum or see Common discuss the Anthology of Rap at the Smithsonian.
The rest is just hipster shit.

It is no secret that GW students are vocal. They make phone calls to support political candidates, proudly advocate for their peers during Student Association elections and protest in front of the White House.
But when it comes down to choosing the leader of the University’s largest college, the student body has been uncharacteristically silent.
After Columbian College of Arts and Sciences Dean Peg Barratt announced in May that she would step down from her position – a month after faculty reported in a survey that they thought she lacked leadership skills and a vision for the college – the University created a committee of nine faculty and two students to lead the search for her successor.
More than 5,000 undergraduates will be directly affected by the decisions made by the new hire. That’s why it’s so critical that students in the college communicate to the administration what qualities they want to see in their leader.
While the dean search might not be as exciting as working on a campaign or putting up signs for advocacy groups in the Marvin Center, the new dean will, in many ways, either make or break the success and progress of the Columbian College going forward.
In the past couple of years, liberal arts degrees have come under fire, and colleges and universities have had to prove that they still play an important role in our society. I’m a student in the Columbian College. My new dean must be more than an academic.
While it is crucial to have a scholar, we need a person who can also find novel ways to make a liberal arts degree applicable to the modern workforce and give students the practical skills they will need to get jobs after they graduate.
This new dean will also be joining the community at a time of transition and change.
In the next decade, GW is planning to implement some major changes with its strategic plan. GW is hoping to increase research across the University and also bolster the number of new faculty hires. But the University can’t hope to attract the highest caliber of professors and students unless we have a dean who can lead by example.
The dean must be engaging. He or she must be a larger-than-life figure – someone with a personality, like former University President Stephen Joel Trachtenberg, whose leadership skills allowed him to revolutionize the campus during his 19-year tenure. Whether you liked him or not, he was a presence on campus. Everyone knew him. There’s no reason why the new dean of the Columbian College should be different.
Now, more than ever, it is important that students engage in this process. There’s too much at stake for the student body at large to sit by as the administration appoints a dean to lead us into the next decade.
While the dean search committee is still young, students must speak up. We want a leader who will appeal to both student and faculty concerns.
Under the right leadership, there is so much that can be gained.
