Tamika Tremaglio, the executive director of the National Basketball Player’s Association, said young professionals should have confidence in their work to avoid being dragged down by self-doubt.
The executive director of the National Basketball Player’s Association delivered the keynote address at the GW Women in Business’ annual spring conference in Funger Hall Saturday.
Tamika Tremaglio discussed her experiences as a woman of color in a male-dominated industry and offered advice for young professionals aspiring for success in their own careers. About 150 people attended the event, which was moderated by the organization’s co-chairs – Kate Dressel, a sophomore studying business analytics and finance, and Emily Morris, a junior studying international affairs.
Tremaglio said she built her business skills while working for Deloitte – a London-based financial consulting firm – as its first Black female managing principal.
“Having gone to Deloitte and having the experience that I have had as an African American female running one of the largest offices in the world, it was a truly humbling experience,” she said at the event. “I wake up each and every morning in a constant state of gratitude.”
Tremaglio said people who want to perform well in business and finance need to live by three ideas – trust, self-belief and a dedication to something larger than oneself.
Tremaglio discussed her battle with “imposter syndrome” – when a person doubts their own abilities – which she “carries each day.” She said young professionals should have confidence in their work to avoid being dragged down by self-doubt.
“They may seem simple,” she said. “But, as women in a highly dominated male industry, it is important that you remember all of these things – the first being the gift of trust. To me, it really starts with trusting in yourself.”

GW's attorneys contested that the case is subject to federal court because of a “diversity in citizenship” requirement – George is a citizen of the United Kingdom, while the University is considered to have citizenship in D.C.
A lawsuit filed by the captain of men’s rowing last week to reinstate the team as a varsity sport has moved to federal court.
University lawyers filed a motion Monday to move the case from D.C. Superior Court to the D.C. District Court as GW still awaits an official summons. Patrick George – a fourth-year student and the captain of the men’s rowing team – sued the University in D.C. Superior Court Friday, alleging the University defrauded him, breached its contract and engaged in deceptive trade practices in failing to renew his athletic scholarship for the upcoming academic year.
GW’s attorneys contested that the case is subject to federal court because of Title 28 of the U.S. code that establishes “diversity of citizenship,” giving district courts original jurisdiction over controversies that exceed $75,000 and involve citizens of foreign states.
George is a citizen of the United Kingdom who currently lives in the United States with a student visa, while the University is considered a party with D.C. citizenship, according to the court notice. The notice states that the lawsuit exceeds the value of $75,000 – George alleged that the annual cost of maintaining the rowing team could reach nearly $220,000 – which also permits the federal court to oversee the litigation.
Lawyers from Gibson Dunn – an international law firm with more than 1,500 attorneys – filed the notice of removal from D.C. Superior Court to District Court on behalf of the University.
Anand Ramana, George’s lawyer, did not immediately return a request for comment.
University spokesperson Tim Pierce did not immediately return a request for comment.

After nearly a full academic year of wearing masks, getting tested for COVID-19 every other week and mandating vaccines for GW community members, officials announced this weekend that the University’s mask mandate will lift on Monday.
While GW has so far largely succeeded in keeping its students, staff and faculty safe, this sudden about-face is ill-advised. Students and professors are dying to see each other’s faces, and rightfully so, but the cost of this reprieve outweighs its benefits. As tiresome as a strict regimen of vaccinations, frequent testing and mask wearing is, rushing to return to “normal” at the University and national level would be a mistake.
This change to a mask-optional policy is well-deserved and well-intended: GW continued its mask mandate even as American and Georgetown universities and the country as a whole pivoted away from masks. Students and staff who happily complied with the University’s mandate now deserve a reward for their perseverance. The simple truth is that masks are uncomfortable, and our collective willingness to embrace them has waned.
But a mask-optional policy removes a powerful tool from GW’s public health arsenal. Perhaps masks are no longer necessary in a community where 98 percent of its members are vaccinated and regularly tested, yet the University still “strongly encourages” their use as the “most effective way to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.” If that’s the case, then why make them optional? This seems more like a self-sabotaging concession to understandably restless students and staff than a carefully considered policy.
Though not yet dominant in the District, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that the more transmissible yet not necessarily more lethal BA.2 subvariant now accounts for more than half of cases nationwide. As both the University and Americans seek a return to normalcy and stringent public health measures lose support, our individual and collective responses to BA.2 will determine whether we get back to “normal” at all.
BA.2 is a subvariant of Omicron, which caused a spike in cases earlier this year. It has reached the United States after driving infections in Europe, Africa and Asia, but its potential impact remains unclear. PBS reported late last month that the variant’s higher transmissibility could couple with relaxed pandemic restrictions and people’s waning immunity from earlier booster shots and prior infections. This perfect storm makes BA.2’s rise all the more likely, though it may not amount to a devastating surge.
While the University’s response hasn’t been perfect, GW has generally kept its students, staff and faculty healthy throughout the pandemic through its multi-pronged approach. Of the more than 450,000 COVID-19 tests administered at GW since March 2020, only about 1 percent tested positive for the virus. GW’s sliding scale of operating procedures has allowed it to adjust to changing conditions, like reinstating virtual learning for the first week of spring classes because of the Omicron variant’s rise.
Mask-wearing is fundamentally about collective action – it requires students, staff and faculty to put their community’s health above their own comfort. Embracing a patchwork of individual choices and strong but unenforceable recommendations does exactly the opposite.
At the University level and across the nation, declaring a return to normalcy has often meant making an ongoing public health emergency a matter of individual responsibility. Dispensing with the mask mandate now puts students and professors, particularly those who are immunocompromised, in the position of hoping their dozens of peers or hundreds of students willingly “mask up” for their own safety. These personal pleas for public safety lack institutional weight, leaving each of us to navigate the pandemic on our own.
I understand the desire to declare victory over this virus, tear off your mask and return to some semblance of normalcy. But let us not forget the cost of this pandemic. Last October’s “In America: Remember” art installation on the National Mall, which saw support from GW student volunteers and associate professor Sarah Wagner, commemorated more than 695,000 Americans who died of COVID-19. The New York Times’ COVID-19 tracker reports that the total death toll from COVID-19 in the United States sits at nearly one million as of April 2. The Washington Post’s COVID-19 tracker estimates that since February 2020, 35,000 of those deaths occurred in the DMV.
It’s impossible to move on from something that’s still happening. The pandemic may be out of sight and out of mind for some, but it hasn’t simply ended – at least not yet. Any talk of “living with the virus” has to contend with one simple fact: some people won’t survive an endemic form of COVID-19.
As well-meaning and understandable as this talk of returning to “normal” is, there’s a certain callousness to it. It implies, knowingly or not, that we can trade other peoples’ lives – particularly those who are older, poorer, sicker and so on – for our own comfort. This is a particularly grim prospect and one that I don’t accept.
These “unprecedented times” now have precedents of their own: missed opportunities, poor decision making and blatant disregard for the health and wellbeing of others. Treat the rise of the BA.2 variant as a test: what have we learned? Will we protect the most vulnerable in our society? Will we put people before profits? For our sake – all of us – I hope we pass with flying colors.

ExPat will replace Bertucci’s, which closed in 2020 to the delight of many students. 
A sports betting bar and restaurant opening in late spring will be the newest addition to Western Market, but some locals are wary of the introduction of gambling to Foggy Bottom.
ExPat, a two-floored restaurant undergoing construction on the lower level and ground floor of Western Market, will feature a bar on its top floor and a podcast studio, arcade, shuffleboard and karaoke stage on the floor below. ExPat will be the first business with sports betting in Foggy Bottom, which some community members worry could lead to potential risks like gambling addiction and theft in connection to cash payouts to winning gamblers.
Owner Ben Sislen said he hopes the mix of activities in the restaurant will make ExPat one of the focal gathering points for students on campus.
“One of our missions is to be able to break down the walls between our bar and restaurant space and the GW community,” he said. “That means reaching out, bringing in GW bands and any talent that exists on campus here that wants to express itself in our space.”
Sislen said an ExPat-branded app currently in development will be the primary mode of sports betting in the restaurant, and bet sizes will be limited to $500 with a maximum $200 cash payout per day to protect gamblers from losing larger sums of money. Betting can be placed through the app or through five betting kiosks that will be placed in the restaurant.
“It can be fun,” Sislen said. “We can encourage the $5 to $10 to $20 bets, as opposed to the sportsbooks trying to get people to bet $3,000. Nobody wants to be sitting next to the person who’s losing a mortgage payment on a sporting event.”
ExPat will take the place of Bertucci’s, which closed in 2020, he said.
The District legalized sports-betting services in 2018, joining 30 states to legalize betting after the Supreme Court struck down a law banning sports betting outside of Nevada, Delaware, Oregon and Montana. The D.C. Council voted to legalize sports betting that same year.
GambetDC – the sole citywide betting app in D.C., operated by the city – has underperformed its initial projections by nearly $25 million, losing $4 million in 2021 because of marketing costs, according to DCist.
Sislen said he met with the Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission at least four times since late last year, including at a special meeting to address concerns about the restaurant’s gambling, including safety threats for people carrying out large sums of cash and gambling addiction.
The ANC unanimously passed a settlement agreement in the special meeting last month to limit the amount of cash a person can withdraw each day to $200 with a maximum of $500 in wagers per person.
Sislen, who quit his job as a lawyer in 2014 to work at his friend’s restaurant in D.C., has opened other bars in the District, like The Crown & Crow and Kingfisher near Logan Circle.
Margaret McDonald, a junior and ANC commissioner who represents the district containing Western Market, said they were closely involved with brokering and writing the settlement agreement between Sislen and the ANC. McDonald said commissioners unanimously voted to limit cash payouts because of concerns that people may face security risks while carrying their winnings.
“There was some concern about the amount that people would have cash payouts,” McDonald said. “So we put a limit on that in the settlement agreement because of worries about people walking around with huge sums of cash from gambling.”
Kevin Days, GW’s director of community relations, said at an ANC meeting last month that the University is “very comfortable” with the idea of sports betting near campus.
“GW understands that the students primarily are adults and should be treated as such,” Days said at the meeting. “We expect that we will provide the kinds of support that are needed if students run into issues.”
John George, the president of the Foggy Bottom Association, said although Western Market has been a boost to Foggy Bottom’s dining scene, he has concerns about noisy patrons that ExPat could attract and hopes they will not disrupt the neighborhood.
“What I’m hopeful is that there will be some ability to contain the amount of noise that comes out of a crowded space like that, so that the other retailers can still enjoy patronage and people sitting in that open air,” he said.
George said some community opposition to the new business may stem from concerns about McFadden’s, a former Pennsylvania Avenue bar near Washington Circle that Complex Magazine dubbed the “douchiest bar” in D.C. before it closed after a stabbing in December 2014 that left five people seriously injured.
George said he is optimistic about the arrival of the restaurant because of the experience that Sislen and other investors involved in the restaurant have gained opening bars across the city.
“This is about a community, this is about people coming together, having a good time,” George said. “And then also being responsible and appropriate with the context of the surrounding areas.”

Organizers said the consortium currently has chapters at GW and Georgetown but has also hosted events at Howard University. 
Updated: April 4, 2022 at 4:30 p.m.
A national security consortium of D.C. college students shifted to in-person operations to host events across the city and publish student research on how gender discrimination impacts security policy since its launch last spring.
Students in the Elliott School of International Affairs established the D.C. Student Consortium on Women, Peace and Security last year for students in the District to focus their research on expanding gender inclusivity in foreign policy and advocate for gender-inclusive courses in their schools. Students and consortium organizers said the group has held panel discussions with national security experts, weekly meetings and networking events this year to research how security policies discriminate against different genders, where men have historically dominated the field.
Organizers said about 30 members make up the consortium, most of whom are in the Elliott School. She said the consortium has official chapters at GW and Georgetown universities but also hosted events with Howard University during the past year.
Taylor Bloch, a senior studying international affairs and the director of programming for the consortium, said the group held its first in-person event for International Women’s Day last month, which featured keynote speaker Muqaddesa Yourish, a professor of international affairs. She said Yourish discussed how U.S. foreign policy overlooks gender-based needs in other countries at the event, which drew about 150 attendees.
“I think we really succeeded in creating that safe space and creating dialogue for these voices who often are not heard within the Elliott School,” Bloch said.
Bloch said she has primarily studied the works of cisgender, white and heterosexual men in courses taught by white male professors in the Elliott School like U.S. Foreign Policy and U.S. Diplomatic History. She said the lack of diverse Elliott School faculty in required coursework is a “disservice” to all students and should include a variety of diverse scholarship and faculty to increase students’ diversity exposure.
Three out of four professors teaching U.S. Foreign Policy and U.S. Diplomatic History this semester identify as male, according to the Schedule of Classes. Officials in the Elliott School introduced plans to diversify the school’s curricula, faculty and student body as part of the Inclusive Excellence Initiative launched this fall.
Bloch said graduate students in the consortium who have full-time jobs in international affairs research and policy provide consortium undergraduates “unique access” to the international affairs field with mentorship opportunities.
“In comparison to other student organizations I’ve been involved with, we really have any mentorship regardless of who you are,” Bloch said. “We’re constantly learning from each other.”
Shirley Graham, the director of the Elliott School’s Gender Equality Initiative in International Affairs and the faculty mentor of the consortium, said conversations around gender inclusion in national security organizations have lacked youth perspective because they tend to only include adult policymakers.
“We were really missing an opportunity to engage with younger generations of scholars and students if we didn’t include their research, their perspectives, their voices and their ideas,” Graham said.
Rachel Yakobashvili, the director of social media for the consortium and a second-year graduate student studying public administration, said she invited students at the Georgetown consortium chapter to virtual and in-person national security events to build collaborative connections with D.C.’s other chapters. She said the two chapters advocate for classes in the Elliott School and Georgetown’s Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service that involve women in peace and security studies.
“We want to diversify the course load for the Elliott School to allow people to take more classes that integrate gender lenses and international affairs,” Yakobashvili said.
Yakobashvili said the consortium is starting to create more independent research opportunities for members to publish their research on feminist foreign policy on their website. She said the organization’s undergraduate membership increased this year, and she wants students to discuss a variety of issues that affect women, like sexual violence, to inform them about on-campus resources.
“We realize that a lot of people don’t know what resources are available, or if they do know something like, for example, the Title IX Office, it has mixed reviews,” Yakobashvili said. “And so knowing your options is always important.”
Junior Ramani Wilson, the director of outreach and advocacy for the consortium, said Georgetown established a chapter last year, and she sought to increase diversity within the consortium through the establishment of more chapters at D.C. universities like Howard University. She said she co-hosted a virtual panel discussion in February with Howard’s Center for Women, Gender and Global Leadership to discuss diversifying the United Nations Security Council’s women, peace and security agenda, which the consortium uses as a framework for its research.
“We’ve been doing a lot of work to make sure that we are promoting gender inclusive courses and even within the representation from faculty,” Wilson said.
Wilson said her goal to increase diversity in the consortium as a person of color led her to take a “leap of faith” and run for a leadership role earlier this year, an action she encourages underclassmen of color in the organization to replicate.
“I didn’t think that they were going to vote me in, but I knew what I could contribute to the role and I knew certain goals that I had,” Wilson said. “I wanted to make sure that I saw people that look like me within the organization.”
This post was updated to correct the following:
The Hatchet incorrectly reported that the national security consortium is made of D.C. female college students. The consortium is open to all students. The Hatchet also incorrectly reported that Yakobashvili is studying international affairs. She is studying public administration. We regret these errors.

It’s a common, even ubiquitous experience: logging into Blackboard, clicking on the “Grades” tab and seeing nothing uploaded, even as the semester is approaching the finish line. Almost any student could attest that some professors are often slow to provide feedback or information on grades. This isn’t just stressful on its face – GPA is critical for graduate school admissions, merit aid packages and more. Professors should be more diligent about posting grades so students can have access to this information that is necessary to making decisions.
In an ideal world, college students would not have to watch their grades like a hawk – they would be able to perform to the best of their ability in their classes and let their grades fall where they may. But undergraduate education does not exist in a vacuum, and grades are an easy heuristic for graduate schools, employers or outside sources of scholarship funding to assess students’ aptitude. Students need to be, and are, pragmatic about their grades, taking certain classes and avoiding others to pad their GPA or consulting services like the University Writing Center to maximize their grades on assignments.
Many graduate schools weigh GPA highly when considering which students to admit. This is especially the case for aspiring doctors or lawyers – a high GPA is critical for most medical and juris doctorate programs. Even for programs where GPA is not a sink-or-swim metric, it may be a factor that is determinative for how much merit aid is doled out to an applicant. In that case, having a high GPA is less do-or-die for admission but could be determinative for being able to attend. And for graduate programs that are GRE-optional, whether or not students take the exam may depend on what their grades are going to look like by the end of the semester.
For all of these reasons, students with an eye toward future plans sweat bullets over every hundredths place of their GPA, where it will stand at the end of a semester and how specific in-progress classes will affect the score. That’s not ideal, but it’s the way it is. These goals are not served well when professors keep students in limbo for weeks, months or until after finals about how they’re doing in a class.
Not knowing where grades stand is not just a matter of being stressed. Having an accurate picture of one’s GPA is important for all of the above considerations – grad school, merit aid, jobs and more. All of these undertakings require long-term planning. Students generally do not decide to apply to graduate school on a whim. There is almost always a months-long run-up to pressing “send” on an application that is occupied by keeping grades as high as possible, gathering recommenders or speaking with career advisers. Without continuous knowledge of grades during this process, students can be making impactful plans and decisions based on incomplete information.
To be fair, no one should be unsympathetic to how swamped the average faculty member is – juggling research projects, teaching and grading is a herculean effort at best. That being said, plenty of professors have found the capacity and time to keep students informed about grades. There is room for the University and individual academic departments to step in here. A faculty member who is so phenomenally busy that they cannot find the time to post students’ grades should probably have a teaching assistant to lighten the load anyway, even without considering the posting-of-grades issue. Departments can pair more teaching assistants with professors, and the University should come up with ways of funding such an effort.
This is not a particularly difficult fix – and in the grand scheme of things, this is admittedly a minor grievance. Knowing grades as the semester unfolds would make students’ efforts at planning the future a quarter-turn easier. Faculty should improve their diligence about posting grades, and the University should provide any necessary support to make that happen.

Officials apologized for the issues in The Aston, a former graduate student residence hall that was converted to undergraduate housing when Thurston Hall went offline for renovations. 
Students living in The Aston will receive a $250 housing credit because of issues like water outages and security concerns, officials told residents in an email Thursday.
Officials said the building experienced maintenance issues “a bit more than usual” this academic year, and the housing credit would be applied to residents’ student accounts within two to three business days, according to a post on the “Overheard at GW” Facebook group. The email acknowledges various issues in the building, including water outages and repeated lapses in security that allowed non-GW affiliated people to access residential floors of the building.
An increased strain on the building’s older plumbing system is partially to blame for the increase of issues, according to the email officials sent to students.
“We recognize there have been other challenges not addressed here throughout the year that have caused frustration and intermittent disruptions that may be affecting your overall living experience,” they said in the email.
Melissa Schwab, a senior and resident of The Aston who made the Facebook post, said in the post that her closet flooded over spring break, her air conditioning unit malfunctioned last summer and she was temporarily stuck in an Aston elevator earlier this week because of a door jam. She said she decided to live in The Aston because it offered cheaper housing costs compared to other residence halls, but she is “frustrated” with the living conditions.
“Many of the other students in this building come from marginalized backgrounds in our GW community and also chose this building due to its low cost,” Schwab said. “It feels like our concerns are ignored because we don’t live in the $20,000 a year housing options located on campus.”
Schwab said residents of The Aston sent officials an email outlining their concerns with the building’s living conditions earlier this week, which led to officials’ response and the University’s decision to grant them a housing credit.
“A $250 housing credit is a good start, but we should not have to petition our University en masse to stop acting like a slumlord,” she said.

GW’s dining scene has seen many changes in recent months as officials prepare to launch the University’s new dining plan. 
Kin’s Sushi, a Japanese restaurant currently located in the basement of District House, will relocate to Shenkman Hall ahead of the next academic year as the University prepares to open three new dining halls next fall.
Seth Weinshel, the associate vice president for business services, said Kin’s will close at the conclusion of the spring semester and relocate to Shenkman over the summer. Kin’s was previously set to permanently leave campus alongside GRK Fresh Greek, Sol Mexican Grill and Wiseguy Pizza as part of GW’s plans to open dining halls in District House and Shenkman and Thurston halls.
The new dining halls will provide all-you-can-eat meal access under an unlimited dining plan with a smaller declining GWorld balance that they can use at local vendors.
Weinshel said officials are looking to provide a “variety of cuisines” for students as they roll out the new dining plan. He declined to say when during the fall semester the restaurant would open and where Kin’s would be relocated within Shenkman Hall.
“Kin’s Sushi is popular amongst students, and we wanted to make sure that we continued to keep that option available to students.” Weinshel said in an email.
