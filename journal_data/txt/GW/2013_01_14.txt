A veritable jack of all musical trades, Clarence Greenwood, better known by his stage name Citizen Cope, seamlessly fuses elements of R&B, folk and light rock to produce distinctly hypnotic sounds. The D.C. native’s album “Let The Drummer Kick” propelled him out of relative obscurity, showcasing his soulful and melodic style. Greenwood elevates the vocal styles of artists like Jack Johnson and Jason Mraz with grit, diversifying his musical influences to emulate the soulful blues of Carlos Santana and the progressive 
percussion of the Dave Matthews Band. In tweaking the prosperous musical styles of a medley of artists, Greenwood has developed a sound distinctively his own.
Score: Citizen Cope displays a keen sense of musicality, picking only the best bits and pieces from popular artists to form a decidedly individualized sound.
Bore: The artist’s latest releases show little musical expansion: His biggest hit to date, 2002’s “Let The Drummer Kick” may have been his apex.

Ad-libbed jazz, aggressively political lyrics and a litany of ostentatious neon wigs characterize funk’s most iconic and influential ensemble, George Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic. Contemporaries of James Brown and Sly Stone, the group modernized funk, elevating it to a level of quality musicianship, even propelling funk into mainstream radio via its production of the Red Hot Chili Peppers 
album, “Freaky Styley.” The live show promises to enliven the soulful funk Clinton himself pioneered in the 1970s, as long-winded improvisational sets and perennial energy from seasoned musicians is a guarantee at all of the funk icon’s shows. The members of Parliament Funkadelic may have rotated heavily throughout the years – the group’s 1997 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction featured 16 members – but the crew’s unparalleled musicianship and jovial disposition remain as intact as ever.
Score: More than 40 years after their inception, this motley crew of funk innovators is as boisterous and sharp as ever.
Bore: If anything about this exuberant ensemble bores you, you must not be listening.

They’re ear-shattering, they’re imprecise and they’re indignant. Archetypal spearheads of hardcore punk, the Dead Kennedys emerged in San Francisco in the late 1970s, expanding upon the burgeoning subculture of punk throughout the U.S. The Dead Kennedys boasted  similar traits to their hardcore contemporaries: Their musical aptitude was limited, their frustrations with society were numerous and their performances were excessively raucous. Yet the group set itself apart with satirical lyricism, utilizing morbid humor as social commentary on the political and social state of 1980s America. Transforming the stigma of punk stupidity by championing provocative, biting lyrics, the Dead Kennedys helped mold the subculture into a lifestyle that those disillusioned with society could embrace.
Score: The Dead Kennedys bring viability to the platitude, “Punk’s not dead.”  Few names are so well known and well 
revered among punks and mainstreamers alike.
Bore: Amazingly, three-quarters of the band’s initial members have remained. Still, four 50-somethings may fail to capture the rambunctious, cacophonous sound of hardcore punk and bring it to life.

“Glee” may have commercialized a cappella, but Pentatonix revolutionized it. To suggest that this four-guy-one-girl ensemble of vocal virtuosos is merely talented barely scratches the surface. Few groups can deliver chilling crescendos or crisp beatboxing with such artistry as these Texas natives. Their commanding and complementary vocals take on popular hits like fun.’s “We Are Young” and Nicki Minaj’s “Starships” sans instrumentals, relying solely on their singing prowess to deliver musical accompaniment to lyrical melodies.  Drop your preconceived notions of mediocre high school choirs. Pentatonix provides a refreshing and profoundly impressive spin on songs you didn’t think were possible to love any more than you already do.
Score: For Pentatonix, a cappella isn’t limited to traditional choral repertoire. The group renders songs like “Somebody That I Used to Know” and “Moves Like Jagger” strictly with their voices, manipulating vocal ranges to imitate instrumentals.
Bore: Those against hearing other talented singers enliven popular music should not, under any circumstances, attend this show.

The family of a GW Law School student who died last year donated $1 million to help aspiring lawyers from poor nations fulfill their courtroom dreams.
The Ben Gupta Endowed Fund for International Legal Education, to be announced this month, will use the funds from the Gupta family to pay tuition for students from developing countries starting next fall.
Gupta died in December 2011 at 28 years old while working on graduate degrees in business and law. He was remembered as a fierce leader with a passion for international work. He died from a mix of alcohol and oxycodone.
Gupta’s father Vinod, chief executive officer of a Nebraska-based data and marketing services company, said the scholarship would help the law school establish stronger ties around the world, as well as honor his son.
“The fact that we lost him so early, we thought it would be a beautiful memorial to him, having that scholarship in his name at GW,” he said.
Vinod Gupta has collaborated with the law school before to expand legal education in developing countries.
He worked with the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, where he graduated, along with GW’s law school to help start a law school in India in 2006.
“We are in a global village. That type of concept and that type of education is valuable all over the world,” he said.
This will be the first named scholarship fund at the law school geared toward “increasing educational opportunities for students in the developing world,” outgoing law school dean Paul Schiff Berman said.
The scholarship fund will be available to international students seeking J.D. and L.L.M. degrees, as well as to those hoping to participate in short-term exchange programs.
“The loss of a child has to be among the most wrenching and debilitating events that a family can go through – nothing will address that loss,” Berman said. “But I hope that with this fund, we can keep the name and memory of Ben Gupta alive and honor his desire to contribute to the world.”
Berman said the school has been looking to increase offerings for students from countries with booming populations and overflowing education systems.
The law school has doubled the number of international students over the past decade, with more than half of the 166 foreign students this year coming from developing countries like India, China, Colombia and Tanzania.
Berman, who announced in November he was stepping down as dean for a post in the provost’s office, also visited India last month to help forge stronger ties with Indian schools and alumni.
“Historically, law schools did less internationally simply because law tended to be local. But increasingly, over the last two decades, law schools have globalized their curriculum and education,” Berman said.
That increase in international students could help shield the law school from a deeper dent in enrollment. A 25 percent bump in foreign enrollment this year came as the school welcomed its smallest first-year class in at least a decade. Prospective students nationwide have shied away from law schools’ high price tags and shaky job prospects.
Berman said appealing to more international students, including ones from developing countries, can help buffer that enrollment as long it maintains strict academic standards.
“There’s a growing international population that is interested in American legal education, and they are growing more and more qualified in terms of ability to speak and write English, and educational background generally,” he said. “These are students that GW wants to have.”
During Berman’s 18 months at the helm, the law school has also looked to expand financial aid to help offset the debt burden of its $45,750 tuition.
Susan Karamanian, associate dean for international and comparative legal studies, said the Gupta scholarship would help entice the top students from developing countries interested in legal education.
It would attract “somebody who has a lot of promise for leadership and would be able to, within five to 10 years after returning home, be able to make a difference in his or her country,” she said.
Attracting international students could allow GW to have a hand in improving the standing of global freedom and human rights, she said.
“Students are able to take their law tools and go back and apply those tools to their own unique society. You can’t simply transplant U.S. law, but you can train students who have an appreciation for certain principles to attempt to apply those principles in their home country,” Karamanian said.

Student Association leaders are bringing another petition to administrators’ desks, after they rejected parts of a proposal for increased student space last fall.
SA President Ashwin Narla and Executive Vice President Abby Bergren are reviving the largest part of their fall plan – turning the Marvin Center’s third floor terrace into student space within five years.
The document also asks that students are included in conversations about GW’s newest residence hall, which will undergo construction between H and I streets starting this summer.
“Student space has been an issue for a number of years. It’s definitely necessary, and there is the expectation, but this is a huge hill to climb,” Narla said. “If you look at [the terrace] now, it is dead space in the winter time. We need a space that makes sense for the student body.”
It does not outline an exact design for the 45,000 square foot terrace, but it provides ideas like student lounge areas and meeting rooms in the three floors that can be built onto the outdoor patio.
Narla wants the University to start the project following major works in progress like the $275 million Science and Engineering Hall and the $130 million superdorm. The 2006 campus plan offered “an addition to the Marvin Center (above the existing Betts Theatre)…to address the growing demand for student activity and support space.”
The student space debate, which arose after the close of the Fishbowl and the Hippodrome in the last two years, has driven lobbying in the SA for the past two years. Narla and Bergren’s first proposal extended study hours in Duques and Funger halls until 2 a.m. opened seven conference rooms in the Marvin Center for student group meetings.
The SA’s plan will utilize research from similar schools like Tulane, New York and Boston universities, as in the last proposal.
It will again be sent to University President Steven Knapp, Executive Vice President and Treasurer Lou Katz, Provost Steven Lerman, Senior Associate Provost and Dean of Student Affairs Peter Konwerski and Senior Associate Vice President for Operations Alicia Knight.
University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard responded with a statement based on input from Konwerski, Knight and Assistant Vice President for Events and Venues Michael Peller, and said the University will be “happy to review and discuss” the proposal.
“We continually work with student leaders to make improvements to the student experience on our campuses,” Sherrard wrote in an email.

The University is gearing up for a major influx of foreign students over the next decade, investing in online systems and programs that will ease transitions to U.S. customs and academics.
The changes come as GW looks to double its foreign student enrollment – a key demographic for the tuition-dependent and globalizing University – over the next decade. The number of foreign graduate students jumped 25 percent this year alone, according to  recent institutional data, while the number of international undergraduates rose 16 percent.
Director of the International Services Office Greg Leonard said it will put more emphasis on addressing the needs of undergraduate and graduate foreign students separately. Undergraduates typically come from wealthier backgrounds and have taken classes in English, but may have difficulty adjusting to cultural differences to connect with American classmates, he said. Graduate students need more intensive academic training.
The services will roll out this week, as 300 new international students arrive at GW. The Center for Student Engagement will offer information sessions before the spring student organization fair along with  career networking events to help new foreign and transfer students move beyond cliques and learn to make the most of all of GW’s opportunities.
While the number of foreign students is climbing, GW’s international makeup still lags behind peer schools like Boston and New York universities. While about 12 percent of GW’s students come from abroad, NYU stands at about 17 percent.
Administrators set a goal in the draft of the 10-year strategic plan that by about 2022, 15 percent of undergraduates and 30 percent of graduate students will come from abroad.
“We need to offer the very best services and programs we can because we’re going to be dealing with larger numbers. The strategic plan is, quite frankly, a great motivation to double down and say, ‘How can we do the best we can,’ ” Leonard said.
The office will also invest between $10,000 and $18,000 in new software to handle complicated bureaucratic processes like visas and forms that foreign students are required to complete.
Foreign students, who typically attend Colonial Inauguration a week before the start of classes to simplify travel plans and cut costs, will be encouraged to attend sessions throughout the summer to meet more of their American counterparts. The CI typically reserved for international students will be geared toward orienting them to campus life in the U.S. and learning about support services like Student Health Service and the University Counseling Center.
Associate Dean of Students Tim Miller said the University will heighten its focus on supporting international and transfer students because they “need more help in the beginning” than the average student. He added that more events, like one to teach foreign students how to use the Metro, could be added as the office looks into more options.
“International students sometimes have a language barrier and they’re not even sure what questions to ask. It’s almost like speed dating. We want to help them know how to do that,” Miller said.

The University will lock up academic buildings and has contracted extra guards to man residence halls and patrol campus for inauguration weekend, when thousands of visitors will descend on Foggy Bottom.
Administrators have approved about 550 overnight guests – down from 800 guests allowed on campus in 2009. Only guests who were pre-approved by the University can enter residence halls throughout the weekend.
Similar to 2009, when the University hired guards for its 25 residence halls, GW will bring additional officers from the security firm Allied Barton to campus.
University police will check GWorlds and photo identification for all hall visitors from Jan. 19 through Jan. 21, GW’s top safety leader said. On typical weekends, students must show their GWorlds and sign in guests only at night.
Senior Associate Vice President for Safety and Security Darrell Darnell declined to give specifics about the number of officers that will roam campus, saying, “We typically don’t advertise the specific number of officers.”
He said the police department will “maintain the appropriate level of staffing based upon past inauguration requirements and the best available current information regarding crowd size and potential threats.”
Across the city, security personnel are bracing for a smaller pool of spectators for President Barack Obama’s second inauguration. Darnell said most officials are estimating a crowd between 800,000 and 1 million people. About 1.8 million people flocked to the National Mall in 2009.
Still, the thousands of visitors and preparation for the inaugural parade will force several streets to close during the weekend. The parade, which ends at the White House between 5 and 5:30 p.m., will likely bring heavy traffic Monday evening. Darnell said the city will start to block off certain streets starting at 6 or 7 p.m. on Jan. 19.
 “I wouldn’t be driving at all. I think you should use public transportation or walk,” Darnell said.
The Vern Express will follow its normal schedule. 4-RIDE will also run as usual, but students may have to wait longer for shuttles because of closed-off streets. The parade should not affect bus transportation to GW’s Inaugural Ball at the Omni Shoreham Hotel, but Darnell said students should try to use the Metro.
All academic buildings – such as Rice Hall and Duques Hall – will be locked similar to holidays and weekends. Gelman Library will also be closed on Inauguration Day.

On my first day back to medical school, I had the unpleasant surprise of finding safety instructions posted on the doors of Ross Hall describing how to react in the event of an active shooter. The precautions came in response to the recent gun tragedies that have weighed on the hearts of all Americans, particularly the Dec. 14 shooting at a Connecticut elementary school. I commend and appreciate the University’s response, but the student body should still be concerned with the nation’s conversation on gun control. This debate should not end with candlelight vigils.
During several lectures in Ross Hall, I have pondered my response to the “active shooter” scenario. University Police Department instructions suggest evacuating, hiding or in severe circumstances, confronting the assailant. This safety bulletin is logical but ultimately does not address the core issue.
Our nation’s gun policies make each of us open targets for the next attack, which will inevitably occur without some concrete response. We must not only champion sensible gun control, but also remind the University community that our security is at stake. The massacres at Virginia Tech University and Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn. could have happened here. Students should demand a response.
 I applaud University President Steven Knapp for joining other university leaders in signing an open letter to President Barack Obama, pushing for stricter gun control. The letter highlights the epidemic of gun violence in the U.S. and pledges GW will be engaged in working toward a solution.
Concrete measures, including reinstating an assault weapons ban and ensuring background checks for every firearm purchase, would significantly advance our security. We should demand legislation that assures university campuses and classrooms will remain gun-free zones. As a student body, particularly one in D.C., we should use every resource and petition to advance the cause of sensible gun control in this country.
Mental health issues are also critical to this debate. I was horrified to discover that several states have recently attempted to restrict a physician’s ability to question patients about their gun ownership.
Speaking as a medical student, I appreciate the importance of openness and confidentiality in the doctor-patient relationship. Patients deserve unfiltered access to information, and physicians need the opportunity to fully evaluate their patients. Medical professionals need freedom to counsel their patients on the risks of owning firearms.
As a student body, we must demand that our nation’s response to the gun problem includes a commitment to improving mental health care and empowering physicians.
My message to the University community is simple: Keep the conversation alive. Continue signing petitions, calling Congress and voicing ideas. We cannot allow another tragedy to pass without meaningful reflection and action on the nation’s gun laws.

It’s the start of a new year, but there are some issues that never really go away. Such is the issue of high tuition and financial aid, which will continue to be the reality as long as the national unemployment rate hovers around 7.8 percent and student loan debt continues to rise.
And the realities of the economic landscape are apparent at GW, where about 64 percent of students receive financial aid.
But not all the money doled out each year is given to those students who truly need it. The University continues to provide a substantial amount of merit-based aid to incoming students who do not need financial assistance.
If the University stopped awarding merit aid to those who can afford to finance their education, it could maximize its impact during this time of widespread financial hardship.
The fight over merit-based aid is a perennial issue that never seems to gain much traction among colleges and universities around the country.
Over the past two decades, the use of merit-based aid has increased. According to a study by the Department of Education in October 2011, the number of students receiving merit based aid more than doubled to 14 percent from the 1995-1996 and 2007-2008 academic years.
At GW, the numbers aren’t much different.
GW reported that in the 2009-2010 academic year, 14.9 percent of aid offered was non-need based – or merit – aid, out of a pool of $141.8 million. That figure increased to 18.3 percent the following year. And then, 16 percent was reserved for merit aid for the  year after that.
GW undoubtedly provides a significant amount of financial aid. For the 2012-13 academic year, GW increased the amount of aid it provided students to $163.4 million, a number which is approximately double what it was a decade ago, according to a Hatchet article from August 2012.
Despite the University’s efforts to increase financial aid, the cost of tuition has continued to rise annually. In February 2012, the University announced a 3.7 percent tuition increase.
And despite its efforts to award a considerable amount of aid, the fact remains that GW is still one of the most expensive colleges in the country. For the 2010-11 academic year, the total cost of attending GW was $55,625 and the average amount of debt students had upon graduation that same year was $32,714, according to The Project on Student Debt.
Of course, GW is no longer the most expensive school in the country, but it is still far from affordable.
Administrators fear that if they did actually stop using merit aid, it would put the University at a disadvantage.
“If we stopped offering aid and other institutions did not, it would make it harder to achieve our enrollment objectives,” Associate Vice President for Student Financial Assistance Dan Small told me in an email.
The fear is that if GW stopped giving merit aid, students would matriculate instead to rival institutions.
Getting rid of merit aid might seem like a sure way for GW to fall short of its competition, but dropping this form of financial assisance would put the University ahead of the pack in terms of commitment to affordability.
If GW decides to stop giving merit aid, it would set a standard for other institutions to follow. But until then, there will continue to be a stalemate, and students from across the country will continue to be awarded with scholarships they don’t need while others will likely choose an institutions based on financial constraints.
In the next decade, GW is hoping to double the number of international undergraduate students, according to its 10-year strategic plan. And with this rise in students from overseas, who do not receive financial aid benefits, will come a flood of tuition dollars.
Money should be spent on those students who can’t afford a college education, not those who can.

Immediately following halftime, senior forward Isaiah Armwood gripped the rim tightly as he slammed the ball home. Freshman forward Kevin Larsen followed with a quick layup, giving GW a quick 4-0 run out of the gates.
It was a glimpse into the spark of energy the Colonials seemed to discover at halftime, one the team would maintain until the final buzzer. But that jolt wasn’t enough to overcome a 15-point halftime deficit, however, and GW (7-8, 1-1) fell to Xavier 71-56.
“For whatever reason, we didn’t have a lot of effort in the first half,” head coach Mike Lonergan said. “I give Xavier a lot of credit. They jumped on us right away.”
The first half was summarized aptly in the battle on the boards. Xavier entered the break with 22 rebounds; GW just six, with only one offensive board. Only three Colonial players tallied a rebound, compared to seven Musketeers – including senior forward Travis Taylor, who single-handedly outrebounded GW with eight.
The Colonials needed to up the ante, and came out tougher in the second half. GW outrebounded Xavier 22-11 in the second, including an 11-2 advantage on the offensive boards.
“You’re kind of embarrassed by your performance as players and a team,” Lonergan said, referring to the first half rebounding. “We knew we could get back in the game, we just had to play a lot harder.”
GW couldn’t seem to establish any sort of inside-out game in the first, and the frustration spread to the team’s shooting. There was a lid on the basket as Colonial after Colonial misfired, exiting the first shooting just 33.3 percent. Despite turning the ball over only four times, GW couldn’t find an offensive rhythm.
But aided by their resurgence on the boards, the Colonials established a heavier attack after the break. GW upped its shooting to 42.4 percent on the second, a slight increase that helped pull the team closer to the Musketeers. Although that wasn’t enough to overcome the halftime deficit, the Colonials continued to control the ball well, committing just nine turnovers in the game.
“I would like to see us get more assists. Our turnovers weren’t bad, but we have to create scoring opportunities for other people,” Lonergan said. “When we did do that in the first half, we made some shots. We were 3-for-5 from three in the first half.”
Senior guard Lasan Kromah paced his team off the bench, adding 12 points, four boards and two assists. But the rest of GW struggled to make an impact, with freshman forward Patricio Garino and freshman guard Joe McDonald – the next-highest scorers – adding nine and eight points, respectively.
“I thought Lasan played pretty good the second half and did a good job defensively in the 1-3-1 up front. He created a little bit of havoc,” Lonergan said. “We just don’t have that consistent guy. They did a good job of taking our inside game away.”
Compounding the cold shooting, the Colonials couldn’t shut Xavier down over the first half of play. The Musketeers were hot-handed en route to 59.3 first-half shooting, as GW struggled to find a defense that would silence Xavier’s attack. Rotating between different approaches, the Colonials were hard-pressed to halt their opponents.
The Musketeers didn’t slow over the second, maintaining a comfortable distance from GW down the stretch. Xavier shot 57.1 percent for the game, tallying three players in double-digits. Particularly potent were freshman guard Semaj Christon, who added 21 points and seven assists, and senior guard Brad Redford, who abused GW’s 1-3-1 to defense from the outside. Redford drained seven treys en route to 21 points on the night and was the only Xavier player able to unlock the Colonials’ otherwise successful zone.
“He was the difference. He kept us single-handedly from getting back into the game,” Lonergan said. “Those were killer threes. They got the crowd into it too.”
The Colonials return home for another tough conference opponent Wednesday, when they host Temple in the Smith Center.
