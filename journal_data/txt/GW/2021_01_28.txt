The strip of New Hampshire Avenue in front of the Saudi Arabian Embassy will be dedicated to the late journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Updated: Feb. 3, 2020 at 4:50 p.m.
A local governing body approved plans to rename two roads near campus after journalist Jamal Khashoggi and former Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg during its first meeting of the year Wednesday.
The Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission unanimously voted to sign off on two D.C. Council bills that Ward 2 Council member Brooke Pinto introduced this month to honor Khashoggi with a strip of New Hampshire Avenue and Ginsburg with a strip of Virginia Avenue. The meeting was a first for five of the seven commissioners who began their new terms this year.
Here are some of the meeting’s highlights:
Dedicating Khashoggi, Ginsburg ways
Barry Weise, Pinto’s legislative director, said the strip of New Hampshire Avenue in front of the Saudi Arabian Embassy will be dedicated to Khashoggi, and the span of Virginia Avenue between New Hampshire Avenue and Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway will be dedicated to Ginsburg under the bills’ provisions. He said Pinto introduced the bills to the Council earlier this month.
“The designation will further serve as a tribute to a fallen neighbor and as an expression of support by the residents of the District of Columbia for the indispensable values of free speech and a free and independent press,” a Council summary of Khashoggi’s bill states.
The ANC initiated commemorative efforts for Khashoggi in 2018 when commissioners passed a resolution to rename the roadway a month after the Washington Post columnist had been assassinated in Istanbul under orders from the Saudi prince.
Weise said the renaming process was delayed because of a D.C. law prohibiting the city from renaming streets after someone less than two years after their death. He added that the Council’s bill requests District officials to roll back the two-year buffer to name a street after Ginsburg, who died in September.
Relocating the hippo plaque
Following a unanimous vote, the hippo statue’s plaque will move from the ground in front of the statue to a newly-installed pedestal next to it. Adam Aaronson, the executive director for campus development, said one of the University’s donors requested the move, and officials also plan to round the corners and edges of the plaque to avoid safety hazards.
Commissioner Adam Friend pressed commissioners to consider the safety of the plaque, saying students frequent the statue while intoxicated on campus.
“It does appear to fit all of the standards of safety, which is the No. 1 thing we’re concerned about given I understand this hippo is a frequent target for students not entirely in their safest sense of mind,” he said.
The ANC also unanimously approved applications to install curb ramps and a “flashing beacon system” on the 2000 block of G Street and the same with a new crosswalk on the 700 block of 22nd Street.
Alumnus James Harnett, a former commissioner whose two-year term ended this winter, said he supports the resolution because students have faced traffic safety hazards at the listed locations in the face of oncoming traffic.
“This is a really important safety improvement to how folks walk around the neighborhood,” he said. “We’ve got a lot of students that are almost hit or actually hit by cars. Fairly often, people speed down these one-way, one-lane streets.”
Electing new officers
Commissioner Jeri Epstein, who’s served on the ANC since 2018, was unanimously elected to chair the commission, the body’s first female chair in five years.
The ANC also unanimously elected Commissioner Joel Causey as vice chair, Commissioner Yannik Omictin as secretary and Commissioner Trupti Patel as treasurer – the same position she held in her previous term. Causey and Omictin are newcomers to the ANC, and Patel has served since 2018.
Epstein said she plans to authorize commissioners to head each of their own neighborhood committees in collaboration with local residents. She said she will oversee infrastructure; Causey will head an economic committee focused on rebuilding local business; Patel and Omcitin will consolidate aid for housing, dining and clothing supplies; and Commissioner Donna Barbisch will tackle strategic planning, anchored by her expertise with the U.S. government in the field.
“Find what interests you and lead it,” Epstein said. “We want the neighborhood to be better and there’s so many ways we can do it.”
Filling a vacancy
The commission unanimously passed a resolution calling on the D.C. Board of Elections and Council to permit ANCs around D.C. to fill their vacancies during the public health emergency, a measure the BOE currently prohibits. The Foggy Bottom and West End ANC contains a single vacancy for the seat representing 2A08, located in the heart of campus, which students have occupied since the seat’s creation in 2013.
The seat lost its student representation after Harnett, the ANC’s former chair, concluded his term.
Omictin, a senior at GW, said city and neighborhood leaders must ensure potential candidates who might consider running for a vacancy have the information needed to know how to register to run for the seat. The resolution states ANCs in Wards 4, 5, 7 and 8 are also grappling with their own vacancies during the public health emergency.
“We need to make sure that we can fill our vacancies during the public health emergency,” he said. “That’s the real impetus behind this.”

The GW community has been rocked this past week by the claims of sexual misconduct leveled against Student Association President Howard Brookins. 
In the wake of these allegations, people filled social media with support for the student who stepped forward. They shared information about the event and posted links to resources for sexual assault and harassment support. But others posted comments referring to these allegations as a “scandal” or merely remarked that they stand with the student who spoke out about her story.
Spreading information and resources is good and important. We must believe people who publicly talk about experiences with sexual misconduct. In this instance, a student came forward with claims of sexual misconduct against one of the most prominent student leaders, which is scary and takes courage. But for those trying to help, merely posting that you stand with the student or that you can’t believe another GW controversy is going in the books is nothing more than performative and takes attention away from the matter at hand.
Social media can be used to do a lot of good. Students can share resources, information and truths, but students should not confuse their role with an episode of “The West Wing.” Nobody needs to hear your completely self-serving and unhelpful remarks on how you think you’re doing the right thing when a student speaks out with a sensitive and vulnerable story. There are actual stories that need to be heard and valuable information that needs to be shared about ways to help those who have experienced sexual misconduct. Simply posting that you believe someone’s story with no further information or that GW can’t go a year without “scandal” is attention-seeking and trivializing what has happened. 
Writing one line remarks clearly not intended to do any action is similar to the large quantities of people who posted a black tile in support of the Black Lives Matters protests. While these are two completely different subjects, the sentiment is the same. People confuse being an ally and being supportive with being performative. To be an actual ally and actually be supportive to the student who has come forward and to survivors of sexual assault and harassment, students need to be quiet, listen and share useful information. It is not what we say, but what we do that matters in the end. Students could tweet from here to eternity about how they support and believe survivors, but the only thing that makes a difference is showing up and actually showing this support. 
There are so many more useful things to use social media for. Students could amplify the stories of survivors and share resources for those in need. Multiple student organizations have posted statements condemning Brookins’ accused actions and urging him to quit, several SA members have posted their feelings regarding their positions within the SA and offices like the Office of Advocacy and Support have posted resources available for students. These are useful things to retweet, comment on and share. These are valuable additions to the discussion. Students must walk a fine line on social media – before posting, think about what would tangibly add to the discussion.
The allegation and the subsequent dialogue about sexual misconduct is not about you. It is about the brave student who has stepped forward, Brookins’ alleged actions and the stories of survivors within the GW community. Give people the space to speak, the opportunity to see resources and to discuss how harmful these actions have been for the GW community as a whole. 
There are people’s lives and stories on the line. Posting something quippy to make you feel like you’re being supportive and to show your couple hundred followers that you believe survivors achieves nothing.

In addition to a fantastic array of sides, Swahili Village offers desserts like mango mousse cake with a graham cracker crust or chocolate fudge cake.
Fans of meat and Swahili spices will be sure to enjoy Swahili Village’s savory cuisine. 
Swahili Village, located just northeast of campus at 1990 M St. NW, offers authentic African cuisine from Kenyan sausages ($6.75) and marinated goat to plantains ($4.50) and collard greens ($4.50). The restaurant offers a range of dishes influenced by indigenous African cuisine with a blend of Arab, Portuguese, British and Indian flavors, according to Eater. 
When you enter the restaurant, you’ll be greeted with wide mirrors and wall-to-wall portraits of the African savannah. Although closed due to the pandemic, Swahili Village offers generous booth and table seating as well as a bar area. 
Swahili Village’s menu lists the Nyama Choma ($27.30), or grilled beef with Swahili spices, and Mbuzi Choma ($29.25), or marinated goat meat with onions, as its most popular items. 
But I opted for the “samaki fillet sauteed in onions,” a tilapia dish that comes sauteed in onions and cilantro. The dish normally costs $24.70, but I got it as a lunch special for $14. 
The fish is cubed and seared, and the tilapia meat is light and juicy with a crispy exterior. The fish comes with white onion slivers that add a balancing acidity to the dish and fresh cilantro that brings an herbal aroma. But if you’re not a fan of onions and cilantro, you can swap it out for a “rich coconut curry.” 
The dish comes with the choice of two sides ($4.50 each). Customers can choose from a range of options, including sukuma wiki (collard greens), maharagwe (stewed red beans) and ugalis (sautéed spinach in coconut milk and cornmeal mash). For my lunch, I opted for the ndizi kaanga (fried plantains) and chapati (a flatbread). 
The flatbread was an ideal pairing for the fish. The doughy side was lightly charred, which added an element of smokiness to the dish and soaked up all of the fish’s seasoned juices. My second side, the fried plantains, tasted sweet on the outside and included an earthy and tangy flesh.
Between the crispy chunks of tilapia, the flatbread and the fried plantains, I was more than sufficiently full for a midday meal. But if you try Swahili Village for dinner and save room for dessert, you can try the restaurant’s mango mousse cake ($5) with a graham cracker crust or chocolate fudge cake ($5).
For a taste of Kenyan cuisine, head to Swahili Village for a variety of choices.

Fisher said the SBA called on Brookins to resign after deciding that it would be “detrimental” to law students and to the SBA if the SA could not function throughout the remainder of Brookins’ term.
Student Bar Association leaders renewed their call for SA President Howard Brookins to resign from his position at a meeting Tuesday.
SBA President Jacqueline Fisher said the SBA called for Brookins’ resignation based on his inability to govern, citing waves of resignations from his cabinet, a lack of appointments to “key” student representative seats and “alleged repeated” bylaw and constitutional violations. The SBA Senate also unanimously passed separate pieces of legislation to establish three student organizations – a group advocating against sexual and domestic abuse, a yoga club and an organization dedicated to looking at the history of the law field.
Fisher said members of the SBA are not authorized to “adjudicate or investigate” the recent sexual misconduct allegations against Brookins. She said the SBA called on Brookins to resign after deciding, in conjunction with the Student Association, that it would be “detrimental” to law students and to the SBA if the SA could not function throughout the remainder of Brookins’ term.
“Given the emotional and troubling nature of this widely reported news, we as an organization had an obligation to acknowledge that it happened and to provide resources to those who may be troubled,” Fisher said.
SA Sen. Sebastian Weinmann, Law-G, said he had been working with Thomas Falcigno, the SA’s chairperson pro tempore, on initiating impeachment proceedings against Brookins for “numerous and severe violations” of the SA constitution and bylaws before the allegations arose last week. Weinmann said the impeachment proceedings are not related to the allegations of sexual misconduct, and a potential impeachment trial would be “entirely” based on violations of the SA’s constitution and bylaws.
The SA Senate formally filed four impeachment charges against Brookins Wednesday after the charges received the requisite number of signatures from SA senators.
“To my knowledge, no one in the SA has been able to get in contact with Brookins since the allegations arose on Friday,” he said. “Executive Vice President Hill is the de facto president of the SA, and I am saying that to assure you all that the SA is operational and functional.”
The body unanimously passed a piece of legislation to create an organization called Advocates Against Sexual and Domestic Violence to educate students on how to stop the “trend” of domestic violence and assist D.C. organizations fighting for this cause. Dominique Rouge, a first-year law student, said the group will “promote service” and serve as a “channel” for GW Law students to be research assistants for Professor Joan Meier, who formed the National Family Violence Law Center at GW.
She said the organization will seek to host one event each semester that “aims to combat” domestic violence.
“The organization is focused around volunteering and fundraising but will also work to raise awareness with scholars and policymakers around the country to educate members and students on contemporary issues in this field of law,” Rouge said.
SBA senators also unanimously approved a yoga club for the law school. Sarah Libby, a first-year law student who presented the legislation, said the club will “cultivate” and preserve community members’ physical, emotional and mental balance through the “mindfulness” of yoga.
Libby, a certified yoga instructor, said she plans to lead and recruit other certified instructors to lead 40-to-60 minute classes weekly or biweekly in a virtual or socially distant outdoor environment in D.C.
“An organization like law and yoga club would really provide a great physical, mental and social benefit to the GW Law community, especially since schools been virtual,” she said. “And I think another important part of the club would just be to really connect 1Ls, 2Ls, 3Ls and anyone else in the law community during a time when we all feel a little bit distant.”
The body also unanimously approved the creation of the Legal History Society, which will research how the law field was established and has developed via resources like the law school’s legal historians, the University’s archives and the history department.
SA Sen. Cody Ingraham, Law-G, said the organization will create a space for law students to come together in a “stimulating” environment. Ingraham, who received a master’s degree in legal history at GW, said he wants this organization to help “better inform” law students’ education.
“As lawyers, we will all be tasked to tell the story of our clients, and context is the key to telling a good story and writing a good memo,” Ingraham said. “GW Legal History Society will be a great place to explore stories of social justice and underrepresented communities to help further GW Law’s campus-wide goal of promoting antiracism.”
Senators also tabled a resolution that would reform the law school’s policies on grade delivery to law students as senators are still in communication with administrators regarding the issue. SBA Sen. Nicole Karem said only some of her grades came out when they were scheduled to be released last Friday, and she received no communication from administrators regarding her missing grades.
She said she wrote a letter to law school officials asking for an explanation about why her grades were delivered inconsistently and requesting that they change their policies and release grades earlier for the following semester.
“The anger in the last couple days has been palpable with the way that grades have been handled,” Karem said. “We didn’t know until two weeks ago when we should even expect our grades, and it wasn’t the administration that informed us. It was other students and you all [SBA senators] and us figuring it out on our own.”

Officials said almost 7,500 students used the Pass/No Pass or Credit/No Credit options for one or more of their classes last semester.
University spokesperson Crystal Nosal said 4,565 undergraduate students and 2,805 graduate students took at least one class as pass/fail or Credit/No Credit during the fall. She said more than 95.6 percent of undergraduate courses taken as pass/fail resulted in grades of “P” while more than 99 percent of graduate courses taken as Credit/No Credit resulted in grades of “CR.”
Both the number of undergraduate and graduate students who took a course pass/fail or Credit/No Credit declined for the fall compared to last spring. Nosal said in October that about 5,500 undergraduates took at least one course pass/fail and about 3,800 graduate students took at least one course Credit/No Credit.
Nosal said 42.5 percent of eligible students qualified for the Dean’s List at the end of the fall semester, or 4,033 out of the 9,490 full-time undergraduates. This is a slight drop from the spring 2020 semester, when 47.4 percent of students qualified for the list, she said.
Officials announced last October that undergraduates would be permitted to take only one class pass/fail for the fall 2020 and spring 2021 semesters while for students in graduate and professional programs, their respective schools would offer the Credit/No Credit option on a school-by-school basis.
“The proposed solution, we believe, offers a sensible balance between respecting students’ current needs and maximizing their future success,” Provost Brian Blake said in an October email.

LeBlanc said officials prioritized renaming requests for Marvin Center and the Colonials moniker before other inquiries because they have long been topics of "intense interest."
University President Thomas LeBlanc said he expects the Special Committee on the Colonials Moniker and the Special Committee on the Marvin Center Name to make their recommendations this semester.
LeBlanc said in an interview Monday that he asked the two committees to submit their recommendations at least one month before any regularly scheduled Board of Trustees meeting. Based on that timeline, the Board could reach a decision by their May meeting or June retreat if the committees find a compelling case for renaming.
“The ultimate decision on the recommendation will be made and announced by the Board of Trustees,” he said. “We’re not likely to be commenting along the way. This is a process that really culminates in a decision by the Board, and there’s not a lot to say in the middle of the process, but we obviously will keep the community posted on the progress of those committees.”
The renaming framework states that if the special committees find a convincing case for renaming either the Marvin Center or Colonials nickname, LeBlanc will consult with Board Chair Grace Speights to determine if the measure will be presented to trustees. He said trustees would take up the matter at their next regularly scheduled Board meeting.
LeBlanc said the committees have been “hard at work,” and he has been in regular contact with Ward 3 Council member Mary Cheh, a professor of law who chairs the Colonials committee, and Roger Fairfax, a professor of law who chairs the Marvin Center committee.
He added that he is focusing on these two committees first before considering other renaming requests because the Colonials moniker and Marvin Center name have long been topics of “intense interest.” GW community members submitted requests to rename The Churchill Center, the Monroe Hall of Government and Fulbright, Madison and Francis Scott Key halls.
“We are aware that there have been other requests,” LeBlanc said. “Frankly, putting these committees together and supporting their work is a significant effort.”

All responsibilities identified in the petition are required of the SA president, according to the organization's bylaws and constitution.
Updated: Jan. 27, 2020 at 7:05 p.m.
The Student Association Senate has formally filed impeachment charges against SA President Howard Brookins.
SA Sen. Thomas Falcigno, CPS-G, and SA Sen. Sebastian Weinmann, Law-G, submitted a petition to Student Court Chief Judge Maggie O’Brien Wednesday outlining four bylaw and constitution violations as potential grounds for impeachment. The majority of the senate, 39 of 43 members, signed onto the petition in support of beginning impeachment proceedings, surpassing the one-third of senators needed to launch the process.

Dozens of student organizations and senators have called for Brookins to quit over the past week, citing claims of sexual misconduct and “inappropriate actions” in his capacity serving the SA executive branch. Brookins did not immediately return a request for comment on the impeachment proceedings, and he was not present when senators discussed the petition at a senate meeting Monday.
The petition states that Brookins “neglected” to represent the SA to the University community; to make appointments and nominations, fill vacancies and organize the executive branch; to nominate and appoint students to University advisory councils and the Joint Committee of Faculty and Students; and to appoint an elections commissioner to the Joint Elections Commission, which oversees SA elections, by Oct. 1. All responsibilities identified in the petition are required of the SA president, according to the organization’s bylaws and constitution.
The petition was also sent to Brookins and SA Executive Vice President Brandon Hill, who has publicly and privately called for Brookins’ resignation in recent days.
Weinmann, the law school senator, said in an interview that the chief judge must now consult with the senate’s presiding officer – Hill – to set a date and time for an impeachment hearing. A court hearing must take place between 10 to 15 days after Brookins receives notice of his charges, he said.
Weinmann said Student Bar Association Sen. Andrew Wise will serve as the SA’s prosecutor for the case because the body’s bylaws prohibit an SA senator from acting in that position. Senators participating in the case will vote on each charge separately via secret ballot during the trial, he said.
Falcigno said in an interview that senators have a responsibility to listen to the presented evidence and to Brookins’ side of the story.
“Our process moving forward is to really listen to all that’s presented and vote on each of the charges when the time comes and be fair,” Falcigno said. “So that’s how we’ll be playing a role moving forward.”
O’Brien, the chief judge, confirmed that she has received the petition from Weinmann and Falcigno. She said a hearing date has not yet been finalized.
“It is the role of the chief judge, as chair of the impeachment proceedings, to impartially preside over these proceedings,” O’Brien said in an email. “It is my intention, as well as the intention of the court, to uphold this duty to the best of our ability.”

A water main break on campus has prompted officials to block off part of 21st Street Tuesday, according to a GW Advisory.
Officials said they closed 21st Street between G and H streets for 24 hours as repair work unfolds at the site, according to the advisory issued just before 1 p.m. The advisory states vehicle owners should move their cars parked on either side of the street to avoid getting towed.
The notification was sent to on-campus residents and users of the GW Guardian app, the advisory states.

SA Sen. Thomas Falcigno, CPS-G and the chair of the governance and nominations committee, said the senate has a responsibility to “defend” the organization's reputation and rebuild trust with students and administrators.
Updated: Jan. 26, 2020 at 6:19 p.m.
The Student Association Senate will start the impeachment process for SA President Howard Brookins following claims of “inappropriate actions” in his position and allegations of sexual misconduct against him.
The SA Senate cannot impeach a president based on sexual misconduct allegations, according to the Student Code of Conduct. But SA Sen. Thomas Falcigno, CPS-G and the chair of the governance and nominations committee, cited four examples of SA bylaws violated by Brookins – all potential grounds for impeachment.
“I’m imploring President Brookins to resign,” Falcigno said. “Let us begin the process of healing. Let us begin the process of rebuilding trust. Let us move on and continue the work of advocating for the student body.”
As of Jan. 16, 14 members have left the executive branch, citing mismanagement in the executive branch under Brookins’ leadership.
Brookins did not attend Monday’s meeting.
Falcigno said he recognized “numerous” resignations occurring in the executive branch over winter break and a “continuous flow” of departures in the branch since then. He said the governance and nominations committee invited the resigned members to attend an executive session – a meeting closed to the public – where he said former members shared “deeply troubling” remarks related to the operations of the SA.
“Based on the information that we received in the governance and nominations committee from former cabinet members, the governance and nominations committee is announcing tonight that we will formally begin the process of impeaching President Brookins,” Falcigno said. “The committee has drafted four specific charges for the senate to consider during a trial.”
Falcigno charged Brookins with failure to represent the SA and to appoint and nominate students to fill vacancies and to organize the executive branch, which he said breaches the SA constitution. Falcigno said Brookins did not nominate and appoint students to University advisory councils and the joint committee of faculty and students, and he did not appoint a commissioner to the Joint Elections Commission by Oct. 1, which are also potential constitutional and bylaw violations.
“I want to be clear that these charges are specifically related to constitution and bylaw violations and are not related to the recent events of this past weekend,” Falcigno said. “If a student organization proceeded with adjudicating behavior that could also be a violation of a University policy, then members of that organization and the organization may be in violation of the Code of Student Conduct and be subject to sanctions on that basis.”
He said the seven members of the governance and nominations committee, including himself, signed on in agreement with the charges and will seek formal support from at least one-third of senators to file them with Student Court Chief Judge Maggie O’Brien, who can formally initiate impeachment proceedings. As of Monday, 38 senators have called for Brookins’ resignation, Falcigno said.
He said Monday “is truly a very sad day,” but he added that the organization has a responsibility to “defend” the organization’s reputation and rebuild trust with students and administrators.
“We unfortunately need to take this drastic but necessary action,” he said. “Right now, we essentially do not have a president. That is a problem and a blatant dereliction of duty.”
SA Executive Vice President Brandon Hill said he set up meetings with the remaining members of the executive branch to support their “emotional needs” and discuss their advocacy goals. He said he is prepared to represent students’ interests in meetings with administrators.
Hill has pressed Brookins both publicly and privately to quit.
“I am here to support the senate in whatever path they choose to do and ensure President Brookins takes full accountability for the actions inside the confines of our governing documents,” Hill said.
The senate also unanimously approved a bill adjusting how many undergraduate and graduate students serve on the Joint Elections Commission – the body that oversees SA elections. Under the approved legislation, four undergraduates and two graduate students will serve instead of three undergraduates and three graduate students.
The senate unanimously approved a resolution outlining a survey to be released to the student body that asks for their perspective on diversity and inclusion in courses.
“We’re hoping to ascertain certain information so we can further continue our quest to try and achieve that possible diversity and inclusion requirement,” said SA Sen. Jovawn McNeil, ESIA-U and the sponsor of the legislation.
Senators also approved a $30,000 co-sponsorship request from the Beta Theta Pi fraternity to alleviate debt owed to the chapter’s national headquarters.
The senate unanimously approved former SA Vice President of Campus Affairs Anna Weber – one of the executive branch members who stepped down – as a fourth senate policy adviser. Members voted to approve junior Derek Lo as an undergraduate-at-large senator.
Senators also unanimously approved sophomore Brook Giffin and freshmen Sophia Chin, Tessa Conrardy and Caroline Sagristano to serve on the Joint Elections Commission.
