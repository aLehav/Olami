The University is intensifying its search for a budget chief to build a new financial plan that will encourage schools to work together, after a yearlong hunt to fill the specialized position came up empty.
The provost’s office is exploring a move away from paying schools based on enrollment projections to instead create financial incentives for collaboration, Senior Vice Provost for Academic Affairs and Planning Forrest Maltzman said.
The current format uses a case-by-case system to divide the tuition dollars of students in cross-school programs, sometimes inciting turf wars between schools.
“We have this weird system that was designed to encourage people to increase enrollment every year, and at one time in our history, it probably made sense. But it doesn’t really do that today,” Maltzman said.
Under the current budget model, when a student enrolls in classes within one undergraduate college, the others do not receive any tuition dollars, Maltzman said – a structure that sometimes puts up walls between schools.
“You are a [Columbian College of Arts and Sciences] student. So if you take a class in a different school, it doesn’t really matter to the other school,” Maltzman said.
When schools want to offer joint-degree programs, like a master’s degree in federal contracting that will be offered by the GW School of Business and GW Law School this fall, the budget office decides how to split tuition on an individual basis.
Under a new budget chief, schools would be nudged to open classroom doors to students enrolled in other colleges, which might even push graduate schools to offer undergraduate classes. Because GW nears the District-imposed enrollment cap and now focuses on gaining tuition dollars from off-campus and online programs, enrollment gains are not the priority, Maltzman said. And for on-campus programs, the aim is improving quality, he added.
Provost Steven Lerman, who is overseeing the search for the first vice provost of budget and finance, said he hopes to fill the position this fall. It was created in summer 2011, and this summer Lerman hired a new search firm, Diversified Search Networks, which specializes in finding financial officers.
“I think the way to describe it is the set of people we wanted to attract, we couldn’t attract. And the people we could attract, we didn’t want. So we’re doing a reset on the search,” Lerman said.
All of GW’s undergraduate schools take money from a unified budget that rewards higher enrollment but forces schools to help fund central University offices, like human resources and accounting. Richer graduate schools, like the law school, the School of Medicine and Health Sciences and the School of Public Health and Health Services, also contribute to the University’s total pool but use a closed budget model that requires them to foot the bill for their own operating costs and capital costs, like construction projects.
Maltzman said schools still need a push to step up collaboration.
“We all act according to our incentives. My mom used to pay me by the weed, and I worked much harder than if she paid me by the hour,” Maltzman said, referring to his childhood yardwork chores. “We want to make sure our budget model is aligned with the various goals of the University.”
The University has reviewed models of other schools, Lerman said. Boston University, a similar institution, moved to the kind of budget model six years ago that GW seems to be eyeing. Its “One BU” initiative more easily allows students to move from school to school without creating financial confusion.
The new budget officer would also come on board as the University puts in motion its 10-year strategic plan, which prioritizes interdisciplinary academics. The plan, set for release in October, could sketch out a model to admit students to the University as a whole – rather than specific colleges – to create greater mobility between academic fields.

Clarification appended
The University is conducting an internal review based on the damning Freeh report released in July that outlined Pennsylvania State University’s failures to prevent the sex abuse scandal that marred the school over the last year.
University President Steven Knapp commissioned the Task Force to Assess Report on Penn State July 12 upon reviewing the Freeh report. In more than 250 pages, the report outlined sweeping failures in leadership across Penn State, perpetrated out of a fear of bad publicity when sexual harassment allegations surfaced about former football defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky.
Following the release of the report, administrative policies and practices for higher education institutions across the country came under scrutiny.
The University only announced the task force’s existence Thursday through a release that said the school plans to publish its findings next semester.
The Freeh report laid out 120 recommendations for Penn State in eight areas, including campus culture, the administration, the Board of Trustees and campus police. Senior Vice President and General Counsel Beth Nolan declined to go into specifics about GW’s evaluation.
Nolan, who is leading the review, said the University waited two months to announce the task force because it wanted to develop a game plan for gathering feedback.
“Once that work was underway and we knew we would be reaching out to the GW community, we were ready to announce the task force,” Nolan said. “It made sense to us to wait until students and faculty were back on campus and engaged before announcing the task force.”
“Of course, Penn State and GW are different institutions, with different structures and programs, so we are also considering which recommendations are most applicable to GW,” she added.
Conducted by Louis Freeh’s law firm, Freeh Sporkin & Sullivan, the report has been used as a springboard for schools, including Oklahoma State and Temple universities, to conduct their own internal reviews.
The Freeh report’s recommendations include background checks on every employee, contractor and volunteer every five years – a practice GW does not follow.
University spokeswoman Candace Smith said in May – when former housekeeper Leon Flythe was arrested for a fourth time in three years while employed at GW – that there is “not a process in place” if an employee is criminally convicted after employment begins. Prince George’s Country Police found Flythe with possession of 23 pounds of marijuana, ammunition and $4,000 in cash.
Vice President for Human Resources Sabrina Ellis said in mid-August that GW regularly reviews the background check process, and deferred to the department’s policies listed online, which do not include specifics on background checks in situations aside from when an employee’s job title is changing.
When asked if the task force is honing in on issues identified by the Freeh report at Penn State, University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard said the group is addressing a “variety of compliance and operational issues” to ensure University policies were documented and enforced.
GW’s committee will involve several subgroups – comprised of community members – to help identify issues with University’s ability to prevent future crises. The groups are still in the planning phrase, Nolan said.
“The task force is not an operational group, but an advisory one,” Nolan said. As the group progresses in their findings, they will recommend areas of improvement and direct their suggestions to the offices that can make the changes.
Throughout the semester, the task force will conduct community polling to identify other ways GW can improve, she added.
Last November, when allegations surfaced publicly about Sandusky, Knapp sent a message to students and employees reiterating the University’s safety offices and asking members of the GW community to be transparent about campus concerns.
“We all need to ask the tough questions and take on the responsibility, when necessary, of reporting incidents that are inconsistent with our shared values,” Knapp wrote in the letter.
The University also reviewed its safety procedures in the wake of the Virginia Tech shooting in April 2007. Knapp launched a security task force to address the University’s procedures in the case of a crisis on campus.

The University will begin giving out grants this fall to fund diversity-related events, hires and curricula.
The grant program will be funded by the provost’s office and will mark Vice Provost for Diversity and Inclusion Terri Harris Reed’s first major initiative since she arrived at the University last year. She said details, like how much money will be available, are still in the works.
“Our purpose is to get everyone on the campus involved. This is reinforcing our message that the diversity and inclusion message for the University is everybody’s responsibility,” Reed said. “It’s to find a way to educate, empower, equip the broader campus community in helping to achieve diversity and inclusion.”
Reed is the first administrator tasked solely with supporting minority populations, part of University President Steven Knapp’s focus on expanding increasing diversity on campus.
Departments, professors, classes, students and organizations can apply once the program, the first campus-wide grant initiative, launches.
Reed said funds could be used to hire a graduate student to identify curriculum options for coursework related to sexual identities or other diversity-related topics, take a group of students to a play or movie that examines cross-cultural communication or host an expert to speak about unconscious biases.
She pointed to the athletic department’s recent promotional video, “You Can Play,” which shows players and coaches expressing support for gay, lesbian and transgender student-athletes, as an example.
“It will fund all sorts of activities for individuals who have thought about how their office, their discipline, their mission or vision ties into the University’s mission or vision,” Reed said.
Washington University in St. Louis and Columbia University have similar programs, she said.
Reed said the provost’s office will initially supply the grant funds, but she plans to fundraise in the future, pitching the program to donors who are interested in diversity issues.
Associate Vice President and Dean of Student Academic Success Helen Cannaday Saulny declined to comment on grant guidelines and applications, because the details have not been finalized.
Director of the Multicultural Student Services Center Michael Tapscott, who is not directly involved in planning the grant, said the program will be a resource on campus relating to a “breadth of diversity issues.”
“When everyone within a community works together to explore and share experiences in and around diversity, everyone benefits both in the short term and the long term,” Tapscott said, adding that the grants will create “new ideas, new approaches and new communities” for GW.

The University has tightened guidelines for live-in professors this year, calling on them to plan more engaging events for residents.
Professors are partnering with the Center for Student Engagement – the office that oversees house staff – to collaborate with student hall leaders and expand their presence in residence halls, where both professors and house staff members live for free.
The faculty are expected to work closely with the student staff, meeting at least twice monthly to come up with joint progamming for residents.
There is no quota for the number of events faculty in residence must put on each month, Associate Provost and Dean of Student Affairs Peter Konwerski said, but the guidelines call on professors to communicate regularly with students.
“It definitely is a little more clear for everyone,” Konwerski said. “It has gone from an on-the-fringe program on the side of the academic community to fully integrated into academic culture. It was a little more obscure, but now we want to put it out there and let students know they’re there.”
Nine professors live in residence halls across campus.
Art therapy professor and City Hall resident Elizabeth Warson said she wants to help students through midterms and finals with stress-relieving events like canvas painting.
Tom Geurts, a professor who teaches finance and real estate and lives in 1957 E St., will hold workshops about building a credit score, avoiding debt and renting an apartment.
“Most professors know about much more than just being an academic,” Geurts said.
History and honors professor Theo Christov, who lives in Lafayette Hall, said faculty in residence are also working on a rubric for event-planning, broken up into categories like academic and social events.
“Event planning is very much still within our discretion,” Christov said, adding that a rubric will “make everything even more clear.”
Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs Dianne Martin, who took the helm of the program this year, hopes to double faculty participation in five years while building student support for the initiative. Eventually, she wants to see a professor in each of the University’s 27 halls.
“Having faculty in residence will increase and facilitate educationally meaningful interactions between faculty and students,” Martin said in an email, adding that the program will have an increasing focus on cultivating “a strong, healthy academic environment.”
The push for more structured programming comes after a leadership change made Provost Steven Lerman the head of student life offices last summer.
For Mark Ralkowski, a philosophy and honors professor living in Somers Hall, even walking down the hall can turn into a lengthy discussion about the trial of Socrates. Later this month, he will host a dinner party and movie night for his residents in the Women’s Leadership Program.
“I’m still brand new,” Ralkowski said. “I can already see all kinds of possibilities of connecting to students outside of the classroom.”

Early in a season, losses can be as constructive and revealing as victories.
After dropping a 3-0 game to George Mason Thursday afternoon, the Colonials (2-1-0) had the chance to turn their weekend around Saturday with a win against Howard. And GW netted two timely and unanswered goals en route to victory, bringing the final score to 2-1.
“Going into [Sunday’s] game, we were looking for a response from the group, and I thought we started the game really well. We had a little courage again,” head coach Craig Jones said. “The guys responded to conceding a goal totally different than they responded on Thursday.”
The Colonials struggled mightily in their first D.C. College Cup game against the Patriots, giving up three goals before the clock struck 24 minutes. It was a blow GW failed to overcome with an offensive response, a failed effort that included just one Colonial shot on goal all game.
Although it was a poor performance all around for GW, the shutout loss at the hands of a local rival gave the Colonials the motivation they needed to take down fellow district rival, Howard, just two days later.
With redshirt freshman goalkeeper Jean-Pierre van der Merwe in net to start the match, Jones showed his willingness to put new pieces in play in an attempt to get a win. Though van der Merwe allowed a goal in the ninth minute, he remained solid from there on, assisted by the Colonials’ solid defensive play in the second half.
Jones said that with four keepers on GW’s roster, it is not definite who will secure the top spot in the net heading into conference play.
“We felt from the first half on Thursday that we should give J.P. some more minutes and even the start [on Sunday], if he wanted it,” Jones said. “There’s still a fight for that number one but again, it’s not like we’ve completely changed our mind about anything yet.”
Despite the solid defensive performance, it was GW’s attack that improved most Saturday. Six shots on net produced two goals, including a breakaway stinger from junior Tyler Ranalli in the 24th minute. Then in the 69th minute, junior Bailey Hinners sealed the deal with a rocket from 40 yards out that landed in the top right corner of Howard’s net.
Ranalli, who scored his first goal of the season during the thriller with LIU Brooklyn last Friday, has a pair of goals so far this season, topping his goal total in all previous seasons at GW.
It is the type of improvement that Jones is excited to see from one of his players.
 “One of the things I wanted to see an improvement in was his ability to score goals. He’s now scored two in three games,” Jones said. “We knew he did a lot of work helping his team in other areas, but he didn’t have that goal-scoring touch. So that’s one of the highlights for me so far.”
Jones still sees room for many overall improvements to his team’s play, including his desire to push the team to a quicker playing pace. That ideal has the potential to separate the good teams from the dominant ones at any level of soccer.
“We’re getting closer and closer to where we need to be, but we think our overall speed of play with the ball – and even without the ball – could be better,” Jones said. “There are still moments in the games when we’re a little slow to adjust to things. We need to be moving the ball quicker, thinking quicker, organizing quicker. That will be our emphasis this week.”

When thousands flocked to Tampa, Fla. for the Republican National Convention last week, junior James Reed worked behind the scenes ushering delegates to their seats, handing out paperwork and collecting signs across the arena.
He was one of five young Republicans selected from California’s convention page program this year, beating out nearly 100 applicants for the spot.
“I had the experience of a lifetime. The environment, the people, everything. I didn’t want to leave Tampa or the convention,” Reed, a political science and history major, said. “You don’t get much sleep that week.”
The Los Angeles native said his passion for politics ignited during the 2008 election, though he grew up in a split-party household where his parents did not discuss politics.
After watching Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., fall four years ago, Reed said he was fired up about the conservative base and decided he wanted to run for office himself one day.
When he came to GW, he joined the College Republicans, Knights of Columbus, GW Catholics and Colonials For Life, an anti-abortion organization, to keep up on the issues and energize his peers on campus.
“The government shapes our lives minute-by-minute,” Reed said. “I think it’s unfortunate when people don’t know the basic functions of our government, especially youth and students our age.”
“At GW, even though we’re a political school, a lot of people still don’t know much about politics. [In Tampa], I wasn’t considered odd for knowing a lot. Everyone knew what I was talking about,” he added.
The junior will graduate early this spring and plans to apply to the Graduate School of Political Management to continue a dual degree program in legislative affairs.
Senior Vincent Bennett, an international affairs major, also attended the convention as a guest with an organization he interns with called Republicans Abroad, which helps guide Americans abroad in the election process.

Correction appended
GW closed its weekend with 24 shot attempts, 12 saves from freshman goalkeeper Nicole Fasano and the first two victories of its season.
The Colonials picked up momentum from their first victory, a 1-0 win over Columbia Saturday. And they carried that drive through to Monday’s match against Cornell, remaining strong enough to post a 3-2 victory over the Big Red on Labor Day.
After opening the season with two straight losses, GW focused on studying its Ivy League opponents’ play to prepare for the holiday weekend homestand.
“We had a sense of how they play – their style,” head coach Sarah Barnes said. “So obviously that helps in terms of organizing the team. But honestly, I think the result was more of a function of just having a month now under our belts to get more prepared.”
In the opening game of the weekend against Columbia, it was clear both teams were bringing a focused battle to the pitch. With 41 minutes left in regulation, senior forward Adriana Moya headed her first shot attempt of the game off of the right goal post, just missing the back of the net. Her shot marked the beginning of several attempts for GW as it looked to find its first victory of the season.
The Colonials entered the second half with a renewed intensity and with 26 minutes left junior defender Jane Wallis crossed the ball into the center of the box, linking up with junior Alex Neal. Neal laced a shot into the net, scoring her first goal of the season and the lone goal of the game.
Neal, ranked second on the team with 32 shots last season, said she and her teammates entered the weekend with a singular objective: maintaining a solid effort throughout all 90 minutes of play.
“Our mindset was definitely to get our first win and battle through all 90 minutes without giving up any goals,” Neal said. “I think there were moments we struggled, but we controlled the tempo of [Saturday’s] game more so then we have in any other game.”
The Lions attempted a comeback with increased speed through the end of play, but Fasano, in her second career start, nabbed two timely saves to preserve GW’s victory.
The Colonials returned to the field Monday seeking a second victory against another Ivy League opponent, facing Cornell in the second half of the homestand.
After 38 minutes of aggressive play, the Big Red’s Jayann Gabrio buried an unassisted free kick into the right side of the net to put her team up by one. But within the first minute of the second half, GW was able to respond, with freshman midfielder Kristi Abbate lacing a pass to fellow freshman Amanda Gaggioli, who found the back of the net for the Colonials’ first score of the game.
“I think Amanda Gaggioli did a great job,” Barnes said. “She was playing great earlier on, was really sick for the first couple weeks but stepped up really big today.”
Neal kept the Colonials’ momentum high for the second game of the weekend, scoring her second goal of the weekend and putting GW up by one with 29 minutes left in play.
But Cornell did not go down without a fight, and continued to rocket shots into the net. Fasano remained unruffled, even after conceding the tying goal.
“We had to come together as a team, and we knew we could do it,” Fasano said. “From the back up, it was communication, and we had to get composed.”
And the Colonials sealed the game’s result in the 86th minute, when sophomore Meg Murphy zipped a shot into the left side of the net, tallying the final 3-2 score.
It was a fitting cap to GW’s victorious weekend – one that Barnes touted as a team-wide effort.
“Everyone stepped up. There was not one kid out there who didn’t do their part today,” Barnes said.

Following the Penn State University scandal and subsequent release of the Freeh report in July, administrators created a task force to examine GW’s policies to ensure that the safety and security of students are a top priority.
University President Steven Knapp addressed the community shortly after the Jerry Sandusky scandal became public last November in an email calling for students “to ask the tough questions and take on the responsibility, when necessary, of reporting incidents that are inconsistent with our shared values.”
When the scandal broke last fall, the media engulfed Penn State, leading to nationwide scrutiny around the campus that failed to protect children from abuse.
While we are pleased to know GW has established a Task Force to Assess Report on Penn State to examine its own policies, we are unsure why the community was shut out of the process for nearly two months.
It is clear that the purpose of the task force is to protect students, faculty and staff. And while the University has kept students up-to-date on professors’ newest endeavors, students’ accomplishments and campus developments, it should have also informed the community of this task force.
We are confident that the University has acted in good faith and has kept the well-being of students at the center of this investigation, but it is hard not to think that the University might be hiding something when it neglects to release information that affects the entire community.
Going forward, the University should be increasingly transparent about the motions of this task force and how the community can offer feedback. Students should not be kept in the dark.
And while there is no easy way to discuss the Penn State scandal without a shudder, there is no formula when it comes to dealing with the issues on college campuses.
The task force marks a progressive attempt to ensure problems that have plagued other college campuses are not overlooked in Foggy Bottom. But hiding such information undermines attempts to make security a priority.

College is expensive for most families, but for children of undocumented immigrants, it is nearly impossible to afford.
The Associated Press reported last month that “many states treat illegal immigrants as international students, charging them hefty out-of-state tuition regardless of whether they were raised in the state.”
And the Republican party’s official platform states that the federal government should have the authority to withhold funding to public universities that permit undocumented students to pay in-state tuition.
With threatening calls from Republicans to limit federal funding, state universities could hesitate to offer scholarships to undocumented immigrants. As a private university, GW should take this opportunity to establish a specific scholarship geared toward undocumented Americans, giving them the chance to pursue an education.
Encouraging immigrants to get degrees by offering scholarships would not only break the cycle of poverty among illegal immigrants, but it would also benefit the nation as a whole. More educated people in the workforce would undoubtedly lead to future innovation, which would in turn help develop a more robust economy.
While it is not illegal for universities to accept undocumented immigrants, they are not allowed to file for financial aid because of their undocumented status. Immigrants did not benefit from the $163.4 million the Student Financial Assistance office allocated this year to help students pay for tuition.
For most children of illegal immigrants, college is too expensive to even begin to consider. A study published by the Associated Press Aug. 24 shows that 5 to 10 percent of undocumented Americans who graduate from high school decide to apply to college. A scholarship specifically for this demographic would offer an incentive to pursue higher education.
Hampshire College, a small liberal arts institution in Amherst, Mass. plans to do just that. The college announced last week in a press release that it plans to support one undocumented immigrant every four years with a $25,000 grant. As time progresses and donations increase, the college hopes to raise enough funds to support one student yearly.
Hampshire’s special scholarship is funded through private donations. The University’s Division of Development and Alumni Relations, tapping into a network of 250,000 living alumni, should search for graduates who would be interested in establishing a fund for undocumented Americans.
“The University does not have a specific scholarship identified for residents who are not legally in the United States,” Dan Small, the Associate Vice President for Financial Assistance said in an email.
But a growing trend among educated communities shows that immigrants largely benefit society, and can be a tremendous resource to our own economy.
Whereas 47 percent of individuals with a high school degree or less think that immigrants are bad for the country, a mere 20 percent of people with a postgraduate degree feel the same way, according to a Gallup Politics poll from 2011.
Even though strides have been made under President Barack Obama’s administration with an executive order that granted legal residency to high-school educated undocumented residents, the future for the undocumented looks foreboding if he is unsuccessful Nov. 6.
So until we have legitimate immigration reform laws on the books, we should make educating the undocumented Americans that live here a priority.
Institutions of higher learning like GW have an important obligation to start a national trend.
