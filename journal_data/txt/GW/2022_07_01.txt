In the two-paragraph statement, Wrighton said the decision was a "significant moment in history" and states GW's role is to support the well-being of the community.
Interim University President Mark Wrighton released a statement to the GW community Friday, addressing the recent Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade.
The statement came a week after the decision via a 5-4 ruling in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case, overturned Roe v. Wade and ended federal protections for abortion. In the two-paragraph statement, Wrighton said the decision was a “significant moment in history” and states GW’s role is to support the well-being of the community.
“I have heard from individuals who are hurting and fearful, and as President of our university, I believe it is important to recognize this pain and share the university’s support for women and for all members of our community,” Wrighton states.
Wrighton states he asked University leadership to send out health care-related “resources, support and guidance” in the coming weeks and also states his hope for GW to remain “bound” by beliefs of inquiry and debate.
The statement comes days after the University rejected calls for the removal of Supreme Court Associate Justice Clarence Thomas, one of five justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, from GW Law’s faculty.
“Our university’s mission is to provide the teaching and research that addresses pressing challenges and brings positive solutions to the country and our world,” Wrighton said in the statement. “This means something different to each member of our community.”

D.C. residents over the age of 21 will be able to “self-certify” their need for medical marijuana without first receiving a doctor’s recommendation due to a new bill unanimously approved by the D.C. Council on Tuesday.
The emergency bill – introduced by Councilmembers Kenyan McDuffie (D-Ward 5) and GW law professor Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3) – is an attempt to promote support for legal medical marijuana dispensaries and discourage users from shopping at unregulated “gifting shops” which gift marijuana with the purchase of other merchandise, also known as the “gray market.” D.C. officials hope the new proposal will also aid delays in patients receiving medical maijuana due to a lack of doctors to provide recommendations. 
D.C. residents will certify their need for medical marijuana while registering for a patient card which will provide access to the District’s medical marijuana dispensaries. Officials passed a similar bill in February allowing patients over the age of 65 to self-certify their need for medical marijuana.
In the bill’s declaration, McDuffie and Cheh said the requirement of a doctor’s recommendation for a patient to receive medical marijuana creates “barriers” for underinsured, lower-class residents who may not have time or finances to obtain a practitioner’s certification.
“This has had real consequences for legal medical dispensaries,” McDuffie and Cheh said in the proposal’s statement. “Because gray market shops do not require customers to provide an authorized practitioner’s recommendation, many medical marijuana patients choose to shop at these illegal gifting stores.” 
The D.C. Council has sent the bill to Mayor Muriel Bowser for her signature. Mayor Bowser said she supports the legislation in a letter to the council on Tuesday.

Student Association Senators passed legislation to expand the executive cabinet and filled senate and cabinet vacancies at their meeting Monday.
The senate unanimously passed the No Hippos Left Behind Act and the We Respect GW’s Alumni and Graduate Students Act, adding multiple executive secretary positions to the cabinet. Summer senate meetings have been largely focused on filling the 23 vacancies in the senate as President Christian Zidouemba’s new executive cabinet members transition into their new roles.
The No Hippos Left Behind Act adds an executive secretary of accessibility advocacy and an executive secretary of dining services to the cabinet. In a public comment submitted to the senate, Izzy Brophy, acting executive secretary of dining services, urged the senate to pass the Act to heighten accountability within the GW departments that handle accessibility and dining on campus.
“Without the implementation of these positions, I am concerned that the needs and well-being of GW students will continue to be unmet,” her statement reads.
The We Respect GW’s Alumni and Graduate Students Act establishes an executive secretary of alumni relations and splits the responsibilities of the executive secretary of academic affairs into graduate and undergraduate positions.
Senators also approved junior Zak Zethner for executive secretary of community and government regulations, junior Abigail Francis for executive secretary of undergraduate academic affairs and junior Sophia Caione for executive secretary of undergraduate student life.
The senate confirmed Zethner as executive secretary of internal affairs in their last meeting, but with the new confirmation Zethner now holds two secretary positions in Zidouemba’s cabinet.
Zidouemba has eleven remaining cabinet positions to fill.
The senate voted to approve ten candidates to fill senate vacancies.
Five of the senate candidates have previously worked for the military and are considered nontraditional students. Newly elected Sen. Taylor Kilmer, CPS-G, said over the nine and a half years he was active duty military, he was deployed to Afghanistan twice and earned a Bronze Star Medal, an award bestowed for heroic service in a combat zone.
“As a distance learner, I understand the issues that others have and would like to be a voice for them,” he said. “We’re still a relatively small body compared to those that attend class in person.”
Senators failed to approve senior Christian Contreras, 2-13-4, to the College of Professional Studies undergraduate seat and Scott Whetsell, 4-11-4, to the School of Business undergraduate seat.
President Zidouemba said in his SA president report that the presidential search committee chose Education Executives as the firm to assist with finding a new University president because it caters to “those who do things differently.”
The presidential search committee announced the selected firm in an email Monday due to its previous involvement in presidential searches for other universities.
“We want input from our communities and the ones who work for the Board of Trustees and the faculty on deciding those things,” Zidouemba said.
The next senate meeting will be held on July 11 at 8:30 p.m. over Zoom.

Risa Zwerling Wrighton, the wife of University President Mark Wrighton, is a social worker, educator and community activist. In 2015, she and her husband, the then-Chancellor of Washington University, launched the Gun Violence Prevention Initiative at Washington University in St. Louis to raise awareness of gun violence and explore ways to address the epidemic as a public health crisis. The initiative spawned increased understanding of the drivers of gun violence and ongoing life-saving programs in hospitals, public health settings and highly impacted communities. 
In 2014, a beautiful 16-year-old girl named Chelsea Harris was shot and killed after school by a bullet intended for someone else. Chelsea lived in a crime-ridden neighborhood in St. Louis, where countless of our fellow Americans live every day and try to stay alive. I was a mentor to Chelsea since she was 9 years old, and her death pierced my bubble of privilege – being tucked away in an upscale zip code no longer protected me from the pain that guns have wreaked upon countless Americans. After Chelsea died, my husband Mark Wrighton and I joined the movement of brave people working tirelessly to combat gun violence through education, research and activism.
These heroes keep victims alive long enough to get them to a hospital, prevent survivors from retaliating and secure guns in the homes of suicidal people. Some, like former trauma surgeon Dr. LJ Punch, have founded clinics that treat the physical and mental scars that come with gun violence. Others, like members of D.C.’s Cure the Streets program, work to stop or mediate conflicts before they start.
These and many other crucial violence interruption practices save lives, but they are not enough – Chelsea’s death, one of hundreds of gun-related homicides in St. Louis each year, was preventable. As I wrote at the time, our leaders failed to act after Rep. Gabby Giffords was shot in 2011 and the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012. Carnage is commonplace in America – we’ve become inured to gun violence, accepting active shooter drills at work and school, buying bulletproof backpacks and bracing for the next tragedy in the face of government inaction. What, if anything, will make a difference?
We have now hit that breaking point – almost eight years, hundreds of mass shootings and tens of thousands of gun-related deaths later, the murder of 21 people in Uvalde, Texas finally pushed our government to act. After a month of negotiations in the U.S. House and Senate, President Joe Biden finally signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act into law Saturday.
The law’s provisions, which include stricter background checks on 18 to 21-year-old buyers among other new regulations, will save many lives. Yet it didn’t go nearly far enough. To get the legislation passed, lawmakers took banning assault rifles off the table. These guns are weapons of war, designed to injure or kill as many people as possible in a short amount of time. And over and over, from Sandy Hook to Orlando to Las Vegas to Parkland, Florida, they have done exactly that.
Yet, just as we took this small but necessary step forward, the Supreme Court struck down a New York law permitting licensed firearm owners to carry a concealed weapon outside the home. Some will remind us that the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution gives us the right to bear arms. But I don’t believe our Founding Fathers intended the Second Amendment to arm and protect our most blighted neighborhoods, to arm and protect mentally disturbed individuals, to arm and protect criminals and anyone whose ego needs bolstering with assault rifles. Do we need concealed weapons and assault rifles to pursue our happiness? To protect our liberty? I don’t think so. Our nation is nothing short of a battlefield. It’s war – and the innocent people of our country are paying with their lives every day.
Guns are nothing less than weapons of mass destruction. They are demeaning and destroying our nation. From my dear Chelsea to Parkland to Uvalde, we have already failed so many. The next preventable shooting is happening right now. None of us are safe – but we can be. We, and especially our leaders, need to own up to our shameful failure to protect all Americans. We legislated mandatory seat belt use and smoking restriction laws to save lives. Now, we need to better protect our citizens from the deadly force of guns – is that too much to ask?
But as we round up these weapons, we also need to reach out to those who use them – those who feel they don’t have much to lose by embracing a culture of violence. There are endemic, insidious reasons that influence why someone pulls the trigger, like a lack of employment or mental health resources and even the built environment. We know that providing these resources and strengthening the communities gun violence most affects reduces violence. The battle doesn’t end at guns – we need to fight this war on multiple fronts.
I’m just so sad, as many of us are. The vast majority of Americans want the senseless killing to end and the guns off the streets. We can channel that sadness and anger into action that goes beyond slow-moving legislative compromise. There is more work to do, and we must vote for government representatives who are willing to stand strong and save America from its own destruction. For Chelsea, the children of Sandy Hook, Parkland and Uvalde and for children across the nation, we must dare to dream of a better world.

In print and online, The Hatchet’s opinions section publishes a wide array of viewpoints and insightful analysis from members of the GW community each week. With this work continuing through the summer and a new semester on the horizon, I wanted to explain the opinions section to our readers – how it works, what we publish, where such content fits within The Hatchet and why we want your help.
How does the opinions section work? 
The opinions section, which contributing opinions editor Riley Goodfellow and I run together, consists of dozens of students of various backgrounds, majors, affiliations and points of view. Each week, our writers and columnists – staff members who have written more than five pieces – publish work based on their experiences, interests and passions. The opinions section has covered everything from the cost of printing and lab fees to the University’s new dining plan and misogyny on campus.
Once we approve a piece for publication, Riley and I, along with editor in chief Jarrod Wardwell, carefully edit each piece to make it as impactful as possible. The editing process is collaborative – it’s our job to make each piece as strong as it can be, and that means several rounds of back-and-forth edits on grammar, style, clarity and so on. From start to finish, the process of pitching, approval, research, writing and editing takes slightly over a week.
What does the opinions section publish? 
First and foremost, we publish pieces that are timely and relevant to the GW community – in other words, things that are happening both here and now. Opinions writers and columnists have outlined why they’re suing the University, called for the restoration of RAs and argued to move classes outdoors. Opinions pieces also frequently address ongoing efforts to foster change at GW, like divesting from fossil fuels or replacing the Colonials moniker. Our writers and columnists also contribute personal essays in which they reflect on navigating anti-Black racism in the United States and the difficulty that comes with making connections in college.
We also look to issues that may not be directly related to GW as an institution but which would still have a profound impact on our University and its community. We’ve covered topics like D.C. statehood, federal student loan forgiveness and abortion access, and they are no less important than our more GW-centric analysis. These broader, sometimes national debates matter to our readers, and they matter to us, too.
Riley and I also write a weekly staff editorial during the academic year – you can think of these as the official position of The Hatchet’s editorial board on any given issue. Staff editorials allow us to amplify the issues that are already catching the attention of the GW community or draw a focus to areas, like facilities issues, that we feel have failed to muster a sufficient response from the University. We base these staff editorials on discussions with our editorial board, a group of non-news editors that includes research assistant Zachary Bestwick, sports editor Nuria Diaz, copy editor Jaden DiMauro, culture editor Clara Duhon, design editor Grace Miller and contributing social media director Ethan Valliath.
How is the opinions section different from the rest of The Hatchet? 
Both the editorial board and the opinions section as a whole are entirely editorially independent from the news section, and vice versa. Our news section tells you the who, what, when, why, where and how of a story, and they restrain their own personal biases and views to report the news as objectively as possible. But the opinions section is not bound by objectivity – what our writers believe and who they are is at the core of what they do. Their expertise, perspective and experience informs their arguments, and I believe it makes them better.
I don’t like what you published – now what? 
It’s your right to disagree with the various views and arguments we publish. You may find something ill-conceived, inane or irrelevant. But rather than turn the page or close the tab, I would urge you to keep reading. Perhaps you’ll learn about something you’ve never considered before or find a better way to articulate your own beliefs. 
The opinions section does not claim to offer capital T “Truths.” What we do offer are a multitude of perspectives on various issues written by people who care about their community. Whether you’re a student, faculty member, administrator or member of the broader GW community, the opinions section is worth reading.
How can I get involved?
If you have an opinion to share, we want to hear from you! Op-eds give members of the GW community more freedom to express their views and detail their own unique experiences without having to contribute regularly. Op-ed writers have discussed antisemitism on campus, criticized GW for its failure to support deaf and hard of hearing students, made the case that a brighter future is possible and demanded real change on Juneteenth.
If you want to comment on a specific article, you can also submit a letter to the editor. Such letters are more reactions to our work than original content, but they’re another way to let us know what we got right and especially if, or when, we’ve gotten something wrong.
Riley and I may run the opinions section, but it belongs to you. That’s why we want to ensure our writers and coverage reflect GW as much as possible. If you feel that The Hatchet fails to represent you, your background or your perspective, reach out to us. And if you’re especially passionate about the issues facing GW and D.C., then consider writing for The Hatchet’s opinions section.
Ethan Benn, a rising junior majoring in journalism and communication, is the opinions editor.

This past week, we saw one of the most disheartening headlines in recent history – the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, stripping the basic right to abortion away from people who can get pregnant. It is a very scary time to even be able to get pregnant in the United States, and this headline immediately made my heart drop. The government took control over bodies that do not belong to them and violated the access to healthcare that all people deserve.
Following the decision, GW refused to remove Supreme Court Associate Justice Clarence Thomas from GW Law’s faculty, leaving students hurt and devastated by the lack of University support. There was also a discovery of the first confirmed case of Monkeypox on campus.
On lighter notes, the Smithsonian Board of Regents released a list of potential new museums and President Joe Biden’s administration proposed changes to reinstate Title IX protections that former President Donald Trump dumped.
Here are the best and worst of this week’s headlines:
Thumbs Down:
The Supreme Court decided 6-3 to overturn Roe v. Wade, pulling back federal protections for abortions. The ruling will strip people who can get pregnant of their right to bodily autonomy and undoubtedly cause major setbacks to reproductive justice. Access to abortions is healthcare and a right that all pregnant people deserve. The overturn immediately triggered bans in at least six states with seven more expected soon. The decision to leave abortion laws up to the states disproportionately affects people that are queer, of color and disabled because rich, white, cisgender women will continue finding access to abortions with resources that marginalized people do not have. GW has not released any statement condemning the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, only sending an email defending the idea of debate and civil discourse among differing opinions as a way to justify Justice Thomas’ teaching position at the University.
After the decision, students started a petition calling on GW to remove Thomas from his position as a professorial lecturer at GW Law. As of Thursday night, more than 8,500 people have signed it, but officials rejected the demand in their email. Despite claiming he does not represent the views of GW Law and promoting debate amid different opinions, their decision to retain Thomas sends the blatant message that stripping people of their reproductive rights is valid. Not only did Thomas support the overturn of Roe v. Wade, but he also called on the Supreme Court to reconsider the protection of contraception and same-sex marriage. Allowing him to continue as a lecturer at GW is dangerous, insulting and invalidating to the student body and more specifically to those who can get pregnant and are queer.
GW also announced the discovery of the first confirmed case of monkeypox in the GW community. Monkeypox broke out in England this May and has spread quickly throughout the world, now including the United States. The individual is in isolation and receiving care off campus while three other people were contacted for being in close proximity with the infected person. While the University is making sufficient efforts to contain this disease, this discovery does not bode well for the future. We should take preventative measures to not come in contact with infected individuals and remain isolated if infected. If COVID-19 has taught us anything, a spreadable disease can stick around on a college campus.
Thumbs Up:
The Smithsonian Board of Regents announced four new possible locations for the National Museum of the American Latino and American Women’s History Museum – a list that will be narrowed down by the end of 2022. Their possible locations include the Arts and Industries Building, a Northwest Capitol site, a South monument site and a Tidal Basin site. These new locations are exciting because they offer the GW community a free opportunity to explore the city more and learn about the pivotal history of marginalized communities.
The Department of Education announced it will bring back the Title IX protections that the administration of former President Donald Trump had removed. These restored rules include more language that’s more inclusive of sexual orientation and gender identity, which can better protect queer students, and enhanced protections for victims of sexual assault, which can better combat sexual discrimination. While these proposed updates must go through a public comment phase before final certification, they are the right steps toward creating a supportive and harassment-free environment in schools, workplaces and society in general.

Mayor Muriel Bowser announced that starting Friday D.C.'s minimum wage for tipped and non-tipped employees is set to increase. 
Mayor Muriel Bowser announced in a release Wednesday that Washington D.C.’s minimum wage will increase.
The minimum wage for D.C. workers, starting Friday, will increase from $15.20 per hour to $16.10 per hour for non-tipped employees and $5.05 per hour to $5.35 per hour for tipped employees under the Fair Shot Minimum Wage Amendment of 2016, the release states. GW student employees are paid at least the minimum wage for D.C. and will be paid at the increased wage starting Friday, according to GW Career Services.
The Fair Shot Minimum Wage Amendment of 2016 states that the D.C. minimum wage will increase each year corresponding to the Consumer Price Index, a measure of how the costs for goods and services have changed over a period of time. The amendment states the minimum wage of $11.50 for non-tipped employees and $2.77 for tipped employees in 2016 should jump to $15 for non-tipped employees and $5 for tipped employees by 2020.
“The Fight for $15 didn’t end at $15, and beginning July 1, workers should expect to see this latest increase reflected in their pay,”  Bowser said in the release.  “We know that a strong economy and a strong workforce means having a strong, competitive minimum wage. We were proud to make D.C. a leader in the Fight for $15, and now we are proud to build on those efforts as our work continues to give all Washingtonians their fair shot.”
The D.C. Board of Elections in April added Initiative 82 to the November ballot, which will allow D.C. residents to vote on raising the minimum wage for tipped employees to $15.20. Students who are proponents of the initiative said the increased wage will give employees consistent pay that is not dependent on their tipped earnings.
The Department of Employment Services Office of Wage-Hour Compliance will hold employers accountable for complying with the wage increase by conducting compliance audits and compensating employees who have been paid less than the minimum wage, according to the release.
“D.C. is open and our workers deserve a fair shot at economic prosperity,” Department of Employment Services Director Dr. Unique Morris-Hughes said in the release. “We want to make sure all businesses are aware of the changes in the District’s minimum wage so they can stay compliant, and workers are paid what they earn.”

The athletic department is partnering with a public affairs advisory firm to ramp up revenue and rally fan engagement among GW’s athletic community, officials announced in a release issued Monday.
The partnership with Bullpen Strategies, an advisory firm that partners with organizations to increase profit through new strategies and practices, will aim to identify new revenue streams while strengthening GW’s relationships with the business community and fan experience, according to the release. The announcement comes after administrators and student leaders worked to harness a rebound in energy during the first season with crowds at basketball games since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
“We are excited to begin our partnership with Bullpen Strategies,” Tanya Voguel, the director of athletics, said in the press. “As our passionate student body, alumni and fanbase knows, GW Athletics champions success in the classroom and competition.”
Vogel said the partnership would build up GW’s relationships of the University with the business community while allowing the athletic department to grow “resources” for student-athletes on and off the field.
Bullpen Strategies specializes in business development, marketing, innovation and training that will help partners like GW connect with brands and “innovative” partnerships, according to the firm’s website. GW will become the newest addition to the firm’s 15 partners, which include George Mason, American, the Washington Capitals and the Washington Wizards, among other teams and organizations.
“We are grateful and honored by the opportunity to work alongside the leadership of GW Athletics to connect brands through innovative partnerships,” Graham Dunn, the principal of Bullpen Strategies, said. “This is an exciting time for GW Athletics, and we are eager to tailor partnerships that connect corporate partners to this incredible fanbase, alumni, and students.”

As one of the dish’s greatest strengths, the eggs in the center are warm right when the wontons are served, and they stay heated for as long as you and your friends enjoy the thumb-sized cuisine.
The right group of people can make any restaurant an enjoyable social outing, but few are designed for the social experience quite like the recently-opened Sura in DuPont Circle.
Since opening in May, the Thai eatery has already made its mark, cracking Eater’s list of the 15 hottest new restaurants around the District and claiming ownership of the best Thai food in D.C. The spot is just about a 15-minute walk from campus, and it’s an ideal location to sample a variety of shareable plates with friends.
The small undecorated corner shop of Sura may not look like much when you first walk up. But after descending the stairs with Thai newspapers lining the walls from floor to ceiling, you will enter a restaurant packed with tables and an environment conditioned to facilitate a memorable time with friends.
Dimly lit with white and green, the room enclosing the restaurant is small in size but uses every last available inch. Four-person seating lines the sides of the restaurant surrounding a cluster of taller tables in the middle. On my visit, nearly every spot was filled in what was a loud and bustling environment.
In the corner, dazzling red lights shine on a small bar with a wide array of drinks and a small counter. Nearby, patrons can find a stand with two guitars. A red and green neon circle with the word “Sura” in the center sits on the furthest back wall from the entrance. Thai soda, wine, beer glasses and bottles are displayed on the side walls, creating a memorable decoration that connects back to Thai culture.
After sitting down, I found that most of the menu consisted of “finger foods,” including skewers and wontons served on multiple small plates that are intended for a group to share. Though the restaurant also offers more traditional entrees like chili noodles, salmon and shrimp crudo, the finger foods pack more bang for your buck ($8-13) if you come with company. Among Sura’s top picks are corn kai kem ($10), a spicy salad that combines corn and duck eggs, and their special chili noodle dish, offered with ($19) and without ($15) shrimp.
I ordered the na-tung chips and dip ($8) and the esaan beef skewers ($9) in hopes of finding two classic Thai dishes during my visit. The former consisted of a plate of crispy, savory rice chips and a Thai coconut curry dip with ground pork, shallots and peanuts.
The dip comes in a small bowl with a spoon, making it perfect to share. While the dip has a strong taste, the chips have a much more subtle flavor, so the two complement each other well.
The waiter brought us three beef skewers for a single order. The beef was tough and covered with a very spicy seasoning and came accompanied by a sweet tamarind salsa.
For my main course, I opted to indulge in the quail egg wontons ($8). The order comes with six wontons with a side of pickles and shallots. The wontons come with a small quail egg in the center and the “wings” fried on the sides. Tamarind sauce, a savory fruit-based paste, covers the entire dish.
Because they are fried, the wontons are nearly impossible to eat with a fork, lest you crack them apart entirely. They lack an abundance of sauce, meaning you can eat them as finger food without getting your hands completely covered in sauce.
The shell of the wonton is crunchy and tangy from the tamarind sauce, while the egg in the center provides a soft, subtle contrast along with a burst of warmth. As one of the dish’s greatest strengths, the eggs in the center are warm right when the wontons are served, and they stay heated for as long as you and your friends enjoy the thumb-sized cuisine. The sauce, while present, is not smattered all over the wonton, putting more focus on the shell and quail egg.
The quality of the food is as high as the restaurant promises. Between the delicious Thai offerings, its atmosphere and the easily shareable bite-sized delicacies, Sura serves as the perfect new spot to indulge in Thai cuisine surrounded by friends.
