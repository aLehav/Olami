SA Vice President Kate Carpenter said she ultimately decided against running after becoming an increasingly frequent target of disparaging social media posts.
Two contenders will face off in this year’s Student Association presidential race, but the most anticipated candidate has opted against running, citing cyberbullying that nearly led her to take time off from school and appeared to trigger a student conduct complaint.
Sitting in the airport to head home for winter break, Student Association Vice President Kate Carpenter decided on Dec. 20 that she would run for the SA’s top job. She drafted a campaign platform and sent it to Anna Weber, the senior policy adviser to the executive branch.
The platform included roughly a dozen ideas, like installing exercise bikes at library study stations and rentable telehealth rooms for students to participate in therapy sessions privately. Members of Carpenter’s team said they had also planned to highlight her record as vice president, accomplishing GW’s enrollment in U-Pass, a long-stalled initiative, and the expansion of SafeRide to several off-campus locations.
“There was a ton of momentum,” Weber said. “And it’s always better when you have actual stuff to be able to run on.”
When classes resumed in January, Carpenter and her aides had continued preparing for a campaign, taking headshots and beginning to film an announcement video. The campaign would also focus on maintaining new traditions Carpenter started to improve school spirit, like Raise High Wednesdays and President’s Weekend Palooza.
“I started those very confident about the future of them, but I wasn’t sure where they would go if I didn’t do them for the SA,” Carpenter said.
But Carpenter’s name didn’t appear on the candidate list finalized by the Joint Elections Commission on Wednesday.
In interviews, Carpenter and her team said she ultimately decided against running after becoming an increasingly frequent target of disparaging social media posts, many of which were made anonymously, that Carpenter said constituted cyberbullying.
Dozens were published on the largely anonymous social media platform “Jeti,” which shares content posted close by to a user’s location.
“Yea we bully racists get off Jeti kate carpenter,” one anonymous user wrote in a post on Feb. 21.
An Instagram satire account that became active Dec. 11 under the username “@gwheadlines” frequently targets Carpenter, maintaining a story archive titled “Kate” that includes anonymous messages about her sent from the account’s followers.
“If there was a drinking game where you’d take a shot every time a sorority girl says Kate has done so much, you’d be dead,” one post read.
The account also has a story archive with anonymous messages about SA President Brandon Hill, including criticisms that Hill did not immediately release a statement in response to allegations of racism and ableism in classroom settings earlier this year.
Catherine Morris, Hill’s chief of staff, said he was supportive of Carpenter but declined to provide further comment.
The owner of the account, which is run anonymously, said Carpenter has a history of “dismissing” and “suppressing” minority voices to further her political agenda. They said Kate has an “exceptionally rude demeanor” when talking to student org leaders and sports coaches.
“As for cyber bullying, our page believes in criticism that reflects her behavior and policies,” they said in an Instagram message.
On Dec. 17, an Office of Student Rights & Responsibilities staff member sent letters to Carpenter and at least two other students, writing that a report led officials to believe they may have been harmed by an Instagram page that may be targeting specific members of the GW community. Senior Justin Diamond and SA Sen. Yan Xu, ESIA-U, who were also named in @gwheadlines posts, said they received the letters.
Carpenter said she did not file the report and was unaware who did. The letters did not specify what Instagram account was reported.
Christy Anthony, the director of SRR, declined to confirm whether the office received a complaint in connection with the social media posts or say if GW is currently investigating the posts.
“We review all reports we receive and address them as fully as the provided information allows, consistent with University policy and our ethic of restorative practices,” Anthony said in an email.
She added that anyone concerned about student behavior can report incidents on the office’s website. She encouraged students to combat harmful speech with their own speech in support of transparency and care for all community members.
“A challenge of social media is that people often use its anonymous features to hide their own identity while causing great harm,” Anthony said. “Research suggests that this harm is perpetrated disproportionately against women and other people who hold historically and currently marginalized identities. When online attacks decrease leadership diversity, our entire community is negatively impacted.”
Weber, the senior policy adviser, called the posts a “disingenuous” campaign targeted at Carpenter herself, rather than her policies.
“I know the extent to which she cares about this role and cares about students,” Weber said. “But to see that amount of pushback – no one deserves that.”
As the posts continued, Carpenter said she struggled to maintain composure in classes and go about her daily routine. She said she started wearing a mask outside and changed her wardrobe so people wouldn’t recognize her walking around campus.
“I’m a 21-year-old woman that can’t pull myself out of bed because I’m being cyberbullied,” she said. “That is, frankly, extremely concerning. And I’m very strong, and I have always been a very independent person and have not cared about what other people thought about me.”
On Feb. 9, the Instagram account @gwprotectsrapists, which had become a focal point for students’ recent criticisms of the Title IX Office, lambasted Carpenter, arguing that she was not doing enough to protect sexual assault survivors on campus. The post included a screenshot of the email Carpenter sent to the Title IX office and said Carpenter did not follow up with members of gwprotectsrapists.
“Hey Kate Carpenter, remember when you said gwprotectsrapists was your number one priority as SA VP but then sent one email to Asha Reynolds asking for a meeting and never followed up with us after asking for our numbers,” the post, which has since received more than 420 likes, read.
The account owner did not respond to an Instagram direct message requesting comment.
Carpenter said she began changing her mind about running on Feb. 10 and made a final decision the following Wednesday.
Carpenter said she considered temporarily leaving her classes to travel home but decided against it so she could still attend President’s Weekend Palooza, which she had been planning for months. The four-day series of events included a student organization banner contest and blood drive.
Junior Chris Johnson, Carpenter’s chief of staff, said the “constant” posts took a toll on Carpenter, which ultimately led to her decision that running for president was “not worth it.” He said the executive team kept track of the posts and checked in with Carpenter as the posts become more frequent.
“I feel like as chief of staff, I’m supposed to be like, ‘How can I fix this?’” Johnson said. “And to be honest, it’s a lot out there and there’s not much you can do, so it was just more information gathering.”
Carpenter acknowledged “shortcomings” during her tenure but said many posts claiming she was making decisions in pursuit of an SA presidential campaign came after she decided against running, adding that the posts often attributed blame to her for actions she couldn’t control.
“I do believe that I was held to an unfair standard of every action that every single person in the SA took,” she said. “And that’s something that one woman cannot do nor be in charge of.”
Junior David Lee, Carpenter’s deputy chief of staff, called the posts “horrendous.” He said tracking the posts became a constant part of his role.
“Seeing her in so much pain, it’s the first time where it was visible,” Lee said.
Despite recent weeks, Carpenter said she did not regret running for vice president.
“But when I was broken that much to the point where I was going to fly home, something had to change,” she said.

Teashi served traditional Chinese flavors and dishes like rice bowls, noodle soup, hot pot and bubble teas.
Asian restaurant Teashi shuttered its doors late last month, becoming the final Shenkman Hall food court vendor to close as the University continues its transition to a dining hall-based meal plan.
Assistant Dean of Students Seth Weinshel said a dining hall will replace all of the food court dining space as part of officials’ plans to build new dining halls in Shenkman and Thurston halls and District House by the fall. Officials aim to resolve food insecurity on campus under the new system that will offer a selection of limited and unlimited dining plans with meal swipes instead of a declining GWorld balance.
Teashi’s closure marks the fifth Shenkman Hall vendor to shut down since the start of the pandemic, following Dunkin’, Baskin Robbins, Gallery Gourmet Market & Dry Cleaners and Gallery Salad Bar & Grill. Officials will renovate the building’s food court area after the end of the semester in preparation for the new dining hall.
Weinshel declined to say when Teashi’s lease was set to expire and when construction of the dining hall will begin.
Sandwich shop Potbelly is the only vendor that will remain in Shenkman Hall next year, and officials plan to revitalize the vendor with a “new retail concept.”
Teashi served traditional Chinese flavors and dishes like rice bowls, noodle soup, hot pot and bubble teas. The restaurant also participated in the University’s meal deals and discounts initiative to offer students more affordable, discounted meals from select GWorld vendors.

President Joe Biden’s State of the Union Address last Tuesday attempted to soothe a nation beset by crises at home and abroad. The soaring rhetoric that earned the president standing ovations and the occasional heckler also briefly mentioned his education policy. Biden said that the government should “increase Pell grants and increase our historic support for HBCUs…and invest in America’s best-kept secret: community colleges.” 
If the president’s speech outlined his vision for the future, the picture I saw of U.S. college education was hazy at best. Biden offered funding for students and schools and not much more. While his proposed programs are undoubtedly important, Biden’s agenda can and must go further. After Congress scrapped a truly transformative proposal for free four-year community college in October 2021, Biden and Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona have yet to apply the full extent of the Department of Education’s power. Biden’s barebones agenda ignores both the policy and politics of education to the detriment of colleges, their students and their staff. 
Biden’s Department of Education has already had a huge impact on U.S. higher education. Billions of dollars’ worth of COVID-19-related relief funds in the American Rescue Plan went to support colleges and universities, including GW. Biden has also imposed a moratorium on student loans, extending it several times past its original end date amid other action.
And increased Pell grants and investment in community colleges and HBCUs, like the District’s own Howard University, would have a positive impact for hundreds of thousands of college students across the country. But these proposals seem small and readily achievable. Reducing students’ tuition costs through expanded Pell grants and providing vague support for HBCUs and community colleges is hardly a long-term vision: it’s an objective that could and should be achieved in a single piece of legislation. 
Many of the initial and far bolder policy ideas that motivated Biden’s campaign and early presidency have already fallen flat. Free community college and more progressive plans to unilaterally cancel all student debt quickly died without support from Congress. 
Whether the president’s reduced ambitions are a result of his limited political vision or thinly-stretched political capital, Biden’s educational policy lacks a broader strategic goal. There’s little planning beyond getting students back in schools as the COVID-19 pandemic hopefully subsides. Biden’s comprehensive view of education amounts to a meager to-do list rather than an enterprising vision of the future.
Perhaps Biden and Cardona haven’t been able to outline a future in a world that seems ever-changing. But what do their respective offices require if not precisely that? Biden’s popular mandate gives him and by extent Cardona the right to govern, but they are governing without a fully articulated vision. This lack of a unified, long-term ideological vision plagues the Democratic party at large and it’s a particularly pernicious problem here. 
Biden and Cardona should ensure colleges and universities provide their debt-saddled students with something beyond a diploma and college-educated elite status. They have an opportunity to make American higher education more affordable and accessible – if only they would seize it. 
Biden’s and Cardona’s predecessors in former President Donald Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos understood the might of the Department of Education. DeVos, a crusader for school choice and religious education, acted like the political appointee she was. She rescinded Obama-era guidance meant to protect transgender students, repealed separate guidance meant to counter racial disparities in school discipline, and oversaw new Title IX-related regulations that some critics saw as unfairly favoring college students accused of sexual misconduct. DeVos also made the process of obtaining college student loan debt forgiveness much more difficult. 
DeVos undeniably harmed the Department of Education and the people it was meant to serve in pursuit of her partisan agenda, but she thoroughly applied the full force of her agency to do so. Cardona ought to do the same, just to different ends. While Cardona’s moderate approach of big-spending federalism is preferable to the damage DeVos left behind, it leaves much to be desired. 
A Department of Education that only fulfills its most basic function as a multibillion dollar piggy bank fails college students and their institutions. It’s not enough to keep the apparatus of the Department of Education running: students, staff and institutions need new and bold ideas to address skyrocketing tuition costs, crippling debt and low pay. 
I know Biden and Cardona must believe something: the president’s speech was more than empty bluster and applause lines. There’s a smacking of racial justice implicit in the president’s support for HBCUs, but it’s unclear if, or how, he’ll tease this thread into actual policy. And Biden appears passionate about protecting the rights of LGBTQ+ Americans, many of whom are overwhelmingly younger and of college age. 
If Biden and Cardona act with even half as much fervor as DeVos to translate their words into action and articulate their vision, they’ll have realized a new idea of a more diverse, equitable and perhaps even affordable system of higher education in the United States. 
Perhaps Biden’s appeal was in his calm, moderate, middle-of-the-road approach to politics. But in trying to offer something for everyone, the government’s higher education policy has come up short. Amid bold and exciting visions for the future, the president launched an uninspired and barebones agenda as if it were an afterthought. 
The president can do, and Americans deserve, better. To quote Biden himself, “C’mon, man!”

The Colonials ultimately fell 55-47 to the fourth seeded Rams despite a valiant effort, going blow for blow with one of the A-10’s top teams.
Women’s basketball made a run to the Atlantic 10 quarterfinals behind wins over Saint Bonaventure and La Salle before falling to defending A-10 champions VCU.
The 12th seeded Colonials (13-18, 4-11 A-10) started the week in Wilmington off strong and beat the Bonnies (12-16, 4-12 A-10) 54-49. The team was led by 17 points from graduate student guard Kyara Frames and a 14-point, 10-rebound double double from redshirt junior forward Mayowa Taiwo.
GW started off strong and had a 16-9 lead at the end of the first quarter, with freshman forward Maxine Engel scoring 10 of her 12 points in the first eight minutes. But Saint Bonaventure bounced back in the second stanza, outscoring the Colonials 14-2. At halftime, the Bonnies led 23-18.
The teams traded baskets throughout the third quarter and the Colonials went into the final period still trailing by five points, 41-36. But down the stretch it was the Colonials who had the advantage, with Frames and Taiwo scoring 14 of the team’s 18 points in the final quarter.
Frames came up big, knocking down a three to give GW its first lead of the second half with 1:36 remaining. She followed that up with a dagger from behind the arc to put the Colonials up 51-46.
Just 22 hours after they took care of the Bonnies, GW returned to the Chase Fieldhouse to take on fifth seeded La Salle (16-12, 9-6 A-10), who they beat 64-54 after controlling much of the game.
In arguably their most complete performance of the season, the Colonials got revenge for a 62-55 Explorers win on GW’s Senior Day only five days earlier. Frames once again led the team in scoring, this time with 14 points.
Taiwo got another double-double, this time scoring 10 points and grabbing 10 rebounds to go along with a season high seven assists. It was her sixth double double of the season and fifth in the previous seven games.
For the second game in a row GW led 16-9 at the end of the first quarter. The Colonials kept their foot on the pedal in the second quarter, a deciding difference between their match the previous day of the tournament.
Although the scoring fell off, the Colonials still managed a 12-11 advantage in the second quarter to end the half with a 28-20 lead.
GW continued to build their lead through as the second half began, finishing the third quarter with a commanding 47-33 lead. Although the Explorers looked better in the fourth quarter, it wasn’t enough to close the gap.
The Colonials ended the game shooting a season high 50% from the field while limiting La Salle to just 32.8% from the field and 5-25 from three point range.
In their third consecutive 1:30 p.m. tip-off, GW took on a VCU team that had come off back to back trips to the A-10 Championship.
The Colonials ultimately fell 55-47 to the fourth seeded Rams despite a valiant effort, going blow for blow with one of the A-10’s top teams. With a win, the Colonials would have been the lowest seed to ever make the A-10 semifinals.
“I’m really proud of this group,” head coach Caroline McCombs said. “They embody a lot of the characteristics that we’re trying to build in our program. We’re tough, we’re gritty, we have heart, we have togetherness, we have connectedness. We just do a lot of things. I’m really proud to be their coach.”
GW was led by a 15 point, four steal, three rebound, and one block performance by junior guard Sheslanie Laureano. Meanwhile, the Rams racked up 19 points from graduate student guard Taya Robinson and 17 points from sophomore guard Sarah Te-Biasu.
Although GW wasn’t as sharp offensively as they were in the prior two games, the defense continued strong, a defining facet of the team this year. At the end of the first quarter the Rams led 11-9 behind seven points from Te-Biasu.
But the Colonials rekindled their offensive flame to begin the second quarter, shooting 4-of-8 from three-point range. They were led by junior guard Nya Lok who scored all nine of her points in the second quarter, hitting a perfect 3-of-3 from deep.
At halftime, GW led 26-21 and had forced eight VCU turnovers while keeping the Rams at 33 percent or 8-of-24 from the floor.
The Colonials were held to six points on 2-12 shooting in the third quarter and didn’t score a field goal for the first 3:20 of the second half. Fortunately for GW, the Rams also struggled on offense to start the second half.
The teams started the quarter a combined 0-of-8 from the field before Robinson got the Rams on the board.
The Rams went on a 9-0 run mid-way through the quarter and VCU finished the third quarter with 15 points on 7-of-17 shooting, boosted by an 11 point quarter from Robinson. VCU led 36-31 going into the final frame.
Frames once again scored in double digits, this time finishing with 11 points to go along with three assists, and two rebounds. The Laurel, Maryland native and Albany transfer was playing in her last college basketball game and was quick to express her gratitude following the Colonials run in the conference tournament.
“I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else besides here,” Frames said. “Coach McCombs gave me a great opportunity to come here with my COVID year. And I’m just grateful that I came here. You know, it’s been a wonderful experience.”
GW began to wake up offensively a few minutes into the fourth quarter, ripping off an 8-0 run to take a 42-40 lead with 6:21 remaining, spearheaded by Laureano, who had two steals and four points in just over a minute.
But GW had no answer for 6’3 junior center Chloe Bloom down the stretch, who had all seven of her points in the fourth quarter as she dominated the paint. The teams were tied at 45 with 2:43 remaining but after VCU took the lead off a Bloom free throw, the Rams led the rest of the way.
The Colonials went 7-6 in non-conference play before starting conference play 0-8 in the midst of COVID troubles. But after a few close losses the team went on a four game winning streak and picked up some momentum going down the home stretch, which culminated in a run at the conference tournament.
“You’re gonna have failures, you’re gonna have setbacks, you’re gonna have adversity,” McCombs said. “How you respond to that is so important.”
Although GW had an up and down season, McCombs’ first year in charge has proved to be a successful one.
The team ended the season ranked 19th in the country in scoring defense, letting up only 55.2 points per game. The defense-first culture that McCombs and her staff have instilled is one that will pay dividends in the long run, especially as she is able to put an even bigger fingerprint on the program through recruiting and play style.
Taiwo will return to GW for her fifth year, looking to use her first year under McCombs as a springboard for her final season as a Colonial.
“This year, we were really focused on building our foundation,” Taiwo said. “And that comes with all the little details and all the character traits, and just being the team that outworks every other team.”

La hamburguesa was stacked high with a beef patty and intriguing toppings as it approached with a mountain of golden fries on the side. 
Visitors to Espita in Shaw likely come for the upscale Mexican cuisine, but you might not know that the restaurant is also home to a hidden smash burger kitchen accurately named Ghostburger.
Situated at 1250 9th St. NW in the Mt. Vernon Square neighborhood, Ghostburger grants you the exceptional flavors of authentic Southern Mexican food in an American-style burger. Beginning as a pop-up addition to keep mother restaurant Espita alive during the COVID-19 pandemic, Ghostburger’s success has earned their smash burgers a permanent place on Espita’s “secret” menu.
Expecting a casual burger joint with a dress code similar to Shake Shack, I was instead met with an insulated outdoor seating area, full of lush plants and well-dressed customers, as I neared the restaurant. Looking down at our immensely casual clothes, my friend and I double checked Google maps to make sure we were at the right restaurant.
After the hostess assured us we were at the correct spot, home of Ghostburger, she led us to the moody large open-style dining area inside. The modern room was dimly lit, but I could still notice the slick concrete floors and dark wood finishes.
The candlelight illuminating each table and the subtle soul music playing in the background made the large space feel intimate. I immediately thought this would be perfect for a date.
Surrounded by wall murals and wooden beams hanging from the high ceiling, it’s hard not to feel like a muse sitting in this trendy, yet charming space. Although we sat at a table, the bar was even more alluring – made of solid dark oak and covered in their coveted mezcal selection with choices like the oaxaca sour ($14) made with Angostura Bitters, mezcal, ango, pineapple syrup and lime juice.
Oaxaca – a state in southern Mexico – is the inspiration for the authentic, but not traditional, items you can order from the Espita menu. With an array of salsas ($4 to $12), served with heirloom blue corn chips, and fresh appetizers ($12 to $17), I was torn between the options on each menu.
I decided to get a taste of the Espita menu, ordering the ensalada ($12) to start. With lentils, roasted beets, avocado and savory granola on a bed of kale, this healthy appetizer would make any vegan friend happy.
The tender kale was easy to chew, and the beets tasted fresh, making a hearty salad base. Savory granola, acting as a healthy carb to replace something like a crouton cut the acidic lemony dressing perfectly.
When you’re finished deciphering the Espita menu along with many drink options, like the smoky specialty cocktails, make sure to specifically ask your waiter for a Ghostburger menu. Their signature smash burgers and fries lie solely on the elusive pop-up menu.
The waiter suggested his favorite burger, la hamburguesa ($10). With a potato bun holding a four-ounce smashed patty covered in queso, salsa, smoked tomatillo relish and cilantro, the waiter did not have to convince me to order this Mexican American fusion masterpiece.
La hamburguesa was stacked high with a beef patty and intriguing toppings as it approached with a mountain of golden fries on the side. The no-frill plating kept the classic American hamburger energy you’re accustomed to at all the best casual burger joints.
With a soft potato bun and a decadent beef patty, the rich queso that coated the burger was cut by fresh cilantro. This balanced flavor combination was complimented by the sweet and spicy tomatillo relish. A thin layer of salsa on the bottom bun added additional moisture and flavors to the already divine burger.
I love eating queso at Mexican restaurants, and I adore a classic American burger, but I never thought the two would combine to make an indulgent Mexican-American fusion dish.
The restaurant’s classic Ghostburger ($9), which my friend was hesitant to share, combined the delicate bun and crispy beef patty I adored from my burger with the classic toppings I desired out of comfort – American cheese, red onion, dill pickle and spooky sauce.
With intricate burgers and sandwiches, Ghostburger was Espita’s missing half – destined to cure the cravings of herbivores, carnivores and everyone in between.

Tyler’s entire set displayed an excessive opulence that contrasts his grandiose on-stage presence with the hopeless romanticism heard in songs like “CORSO.” 
Tyler, the Creator quite literally brought the fire to a packed crowd at Capital One Arena Monday night with an electric and dynamic performance highlighting his 2021 album “Call Me If You Get Lost.”
The Grammy award-winning rapper built up anticipation as he was raised through the stage in a 1939 Rolls-Royce luxury car at the start of the show and sustained his signature intense performance energy throughout his hour-and-a-half-long set, which featured songs from each of his six albums. Littered with comedic quibbles with the audience in between his songs, Tyler’s show encapsulated the bizarre and exciting vigor that propelled him to stardom.
R&B and hip hop musicians Kali Uchis, Vince Staples and Teezo Touchdown each performed as opening acts. While Teezo and Vince kicked off the show with noble set and light design, Kali’s stunning vocals and choreography positioned her performance as the stand-out among the openers.
Emerging onstage alongside a trio of backup dancers, Kali’s mere silhouette illuminated the stage. The R&B pop singer flawlessly performed hit songs like “telepatía” and “Dead to Me,” evoking well-deserved cheers from the audience whenever an instrumental break began.
During Tyler’s performance, the stage was furnished with a green house, accompanied by silhouettes of brass musicians in the windows when trumpets or horns were played in the songs. Tyler performed songs like “WUSYANAME,” an R&B-inspired banger featuring YoungBoy Never Broke Again and Ty Dolla $ign, as he transitioned from his new album to older works.
Tyler split his performance across two stages, gliding on a yacht through an open path in the crowd from the main stage to a secondary stage adorned with tumbleweed-like shrubbery, surrounded by the enthralled crowd in the pit. The crowd erupted and recited lyrics as he rocked some of his most iconic songs, like “Boredom,” “See You Again” and “Yonkers.”
When Tyler returned to the primary stage, the pyrotechnics came alive as towers of flame erupted during his performance of “Who Dat Boy” and showers of sparks down poured just feet behind him as he sang the groovy hit “EARFQUAKE.” Tyler illustrated his ability to connect with his fans when he sang the last verse of “EARFQUAKE” a capella, using the crowd’s clapping as a beat for the spontaneous and stirring moment.
Before starting a performance of what he called his favorite song – the brilliantly eccentric “NEW MAGIC WAND” – he jokingly apologized to the parents who attended as chaperones for the chaotic showing, which included him dramatically flinging himself around the floor.
“This next song is me yelling and not making any sense for four minutes,” Tyler said. “I know you’re going to be like ‘Man, that was terrible.’ That’s the point.”
Tyler, who starred in an Adult Swim comedy show called Loiter Squad between 2012 and 2014, used his comedic presence to keep the audience engaged while he rested between songs. Tyler’s 31st birthday was the day before the concert, but when fans tried to sing him ‘Happy Birthday,’ he shushed them and asked to be booed instead, saying he doesn’t celebrate birthdays much.
“That gets me off,” he said as the boos rained down.
Tyler concluded the show with hype-up song “RUNITUP,” a crowd-pleaser with a catchy chorus that left the audience desperate for more.
Tyler’s stage presence was otherworldly, as the stage lights seemed to ignite his eyes into exotic colors, and he rumbled around the stage with reckless abandon. His dancing jarringly transitioned from the divine to the crude – a smooth moonwalk at the beginning of a song could easily transform to his sprinting in place, limbs flailing wildly as columns of flame ascended behind him.
But his chaos was not without a purpose. Tyler’s entire set – the mansion, the Rolls-Royce, the yacht – displayed an excessive opulence and absurdism that contrasts his grandiose on-stage presence with the hopeless romanticism heard in songs like “CORSO.”
“Eyes is cryin’ on the jet cruisin’, ’bout to spend millions just to fill voids up,” he rapped.
But the absurdism wasn’t omnipresent. During “See You Again,” the crowd moshed and chanted during Tyler’s rap verses but heartily sang with him during its emotional chorus.
“You’re the one that’s always running through my daydream, I can only see your face when I close my eyes,” the chorus recites.

Waking up and falling asleep to the news is my latest habit – my screen report shows that I spend more than an hour on twitter each day. Between the anti-LGBTQ+ legislation in Florida, Iowa and Texas, the war between Russia and Ukraine and heading into year three of the COVID-19 pandemic, the volume of headlines to keep track of has been dizzying. When I give into doom scrolling, I start to feel that the world is in a horrible place and there is nothing I can do about it.Attending a school like GW can feed the feeling to have to be plugged into the current events at all times. Politics is always a topic of conversation, whether during class, on social media or with friends. Limiting media is important for students to take care of their mental health and encourage thoughtful discussion of current events. To achieve this and combat the overconsumption of information, students at GW should take breaks from their social media apps, engage in deep conversation only when mentally capable and seek out good news to balance out the disheartening headlines. Constantly intaking information is just not good for the human brain, especially when the information is anxiety-inducing. Staying updated on current events is crucial to avoid ignorance, but taking a break from the consumption of media is equally as valuable to remain mentally healthy and truly understand current events.Social media desensitizes people to tragedies due to the presence of too much information, misinformation, lack of context and unpreparedness, as reported by HuffPost last year. These platforms are troves of a wide range of information, from cute dog videos to violent content documenting war. It is common to rapidly click through horrific images of current events instead of processing the information because viewing traumatic images causes feelings of numbness in order to avoid the reality of the situation. This is because on platforms such as Instagram, posts can be viewed through stories that give no indication as to what the content will be before clicking on it.The accessibility of social media makes it so that tragic events become normalized and seem like simply another headline. Repetition of bad news also conditions consumers to continuously anticipate tragedies. This can cause people to become irritable and stressed because bad news makes humans release stress hormones. Students at GW who post infographics and headlines about the current news should include trigger or content warnings to give viewers a chance to prepare or look at it later which could avoid desensitization.If a conversation in class or with friends is too overwhelming, students should feel comfortable opting out. Listening to a debate about the rights of the LGBTQ+ community or how COVID-19 is not going away anytime soon can be extremely draining, specifically for those directly affected by the issues. Students should engage in serious conversations about the current news only when they’re mentally prepared to do so, because it is not only more responsible for the sake of personal mental health, but also to contribute more meaningful insight rather than obligatory participation.Students have a responsibility to create a culture at GW that values thoughtful discussion of current issues and prioritizes mental health. Students should avoid pressuring others into sharing their views about current events and encourage their peers to step away to re-center or wait until a new topic arises is nothing to be ashamed of.Focusing on personal responsibilities, like schoolwork and jobs, or participating in relaxing activities, like exercising and indulging in a hobby, can keep students from feeling doomed. Helping those in one’s immediate community or finding local and smaller issues to tackle are imperative and make the world feel less out of control. GW students should use some of the extra time they spend consuming the news to instead allow for a reset that helps personally regain energy.Students should also balance out their doomscrolling with some positive headlines. Sources like Good Good Good, The Optimist Daily and Good News Network are great outlets to find uplifting stories. Gaining perspective on the overall state of society includes the articles that are happy as well. 
Nothing is beneficial in excess and with the accessibility of social media and constant discussion among politically involved people, students must go out of their way to balance their intake of information. The next time you find yourself appalled at your screen time, like I have been, consider taking a break from social media, limiting conversations about heavy topics and seeking out some good news too.

Head Coach Gregg Ritchie said he was proud of the team for bouncing back from a defeat Saturday with a big victory Sunday. 
Baseball collected its first series victory of the season this past weekend, winning two of three games against Maine following a six-game losing streak and a win against Towson to start the season.
GW opened the series with a 5–2 victory on Friday but were bested 11–3 on Saturday before snatching the series win with a decisive 12–4 finish over the Black Bears Sunday. The Colonials accomplished a total of 20 runs in three games while giving up 17 runs to the Black Bears.
Redshirt senior right-handed pitcher Harrison Cohen allowed just two runs on five hits in seven innings in the opener while redshirt senior designated hitter Derek Ripp batted in three runs to close out the series.
Head Coach Gregg Ritchie said the team showed resilience over the course of the weekend and after taking a loss on Saturday.
“And as you can see, they’re very resilient,” he said. “They shake off a loss, and that’s a big deal.”
Game One
Led by strong pitching performances from Cohen and graduate student Trevor Kuncl, the Colonials beat the Black Bears 5–2.
Freshman catcher Tim Nicholson scored on a sacrifice fly from senior second baseman Noah Levin to kick off the scoring in the third. Graduate student outfielder Michael Ludowig followed shortly afterward, hitting a single into left to score junior shortstop Steve DiTomaso.
Levin hit a two-run home run to right field in the fifth for his third of the year and second at home. Senior centerfielder Cade Fergus hit a solo homer in the eighth to close out Colonials scoring.
The Black Bears would manage single-run innings in the fourth and eighth but could not overcome the Colonials’ defense.
Cohen lasted seven innings, giving up only two runs on five hits while striking out eight to collect his first win of the season. Kuncl closed out the final two innings, giving up no runs, no hits and only two walks to collect his first save of the year.
“Our defense played well,” Ritchie said. “We walked less guys, hitters kept the chain connected, and that’s the end result.”
Game Two
The Colonials fell to the Black Bears 11–3 to give Maine its first and only win of the series.
Redshirt sophomore infielder Joe Biancone led the GW offense, batting in all three runs of the day. The Colonials would finish with a .161 batting average on the day after only five hits in 31 at-bats.
The Black Bears were led by sophomore second baseman Quinn McDaniel who scored three runs, batted in two and collected three hits in four at-bats.
Five different Maine players batted in two or more runs, and four had multi-hit games. The Black Bears managed a total of 16 hits in 39 at-bats.
Despite a season-high 11 strikeouts, the Colonials’ pitchers struggled. Junior Connor Harris picked up his third loss of the season, and the five total pitchers gave up 11 runs on 16 hits and six walks.
Game Three
The Colonials returned Sunday to close out the series with a 12–4 win, giving them their first series victory of the season.
Ritchie said the Saturday game was a test for the Colonials, and the squad responded the way he hoped they would.
“Because it’s one of those games where you can not be there after you took that little bit of a thrashing, right?” he said. “And I was really, really proud of them. I can’t tell you how proud I am of them right now.”
The Colonials came out swinging, scoring six runs and batting all the way through the lineup in the first inning. They followed suit in the second, scoring another three runs.
Fergus hit a two-run homer in the second to score designated hitter Ripp for his third home run of the season and his second of the series.
The Colonials’ pitching showed improvement over Saturday, allowing only four runs on eight hits and four walks. Graduate right-handed pitcher Justin Solt went five innings, giving up only one run while striking out five to collect his first win of the season.
Ripp led the offensive onslaught, managing three hits in four at-bats while batting in two runs. Four Colonials had multi-hit games and six collected extra-base hits.
Freshman second baseman Ty Acker doubled in the sixth, batting in a run, to collect his first hit in his second career start with the Colonials.
The Colonials will start off another three-game series at 3 p.m. on Friday against Hofstra at home to begin an eight-game homestead.

Mark Shaffer, a parent of a female student, filed the lawsuit in 2020 to call on the University to provide a partial refund to his daughter and other students.
A federal appeals court revived a lawsuit Tuesday that demands tuition refunds from the University to repay families for the second half of the spring 2020 semester when classes turned online for the first time during the pandemic.
Mark Shaffer, a parent of a female student, filed the lawsuit in the D.C. District Court in 2020 to call on the University to partially refund his daughter and all other students who paid for “tuition, fees and/or room and board” in the spring 2020 semester. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed the D.C. District Court’s March 2021 dismissal of Shaffer’s requests for tuition and course fee refunds and returned the case – which includes a similar lawsuit against American University – to District Court, according to court documents.
The ruling, written by Judge Harry Edwards, will require the District Court to reconsider whether the universities’ failure to distribute tuition refunds after the transition to online learning constitutes a breach of contract. Edwards also directed the District Court to reconsider whether the universities unfairly profited from lower operational costs during online learning in a reversal of its earlier dismissal.
“There is much in the record to suggest that the Universities did the best they could to protect and advance their students’ educational interests,” Edward wrote. “But determining whether the transition to online learning resulted in a net enrichment to GW and American is a fact-intensive question inappropriate for resolution at the motion-to-dismiss stage.”
In his 26-page opinion, Edwards said the District Court dismissed the breach of contract allegations too quickly before the universities could address them.
“The universities will likely have compelling arguments to offer that the pandemic and resulting government shutdown orders discharged their duties to perform these alleged promises,” Edwards said in the opinion. “However, because the universities have not raised any such defense before this court, we leave the issue to the District Courts to resolve in the first instance.”
Shaffer’s initial complaint called on officials to deliver refunds for course fees from laboratories and materials that students could not access during remote classes. The appeals court dismissed Shaffer’s request for a Student Association fee refund because it is not inherently tied to “on-campus services, activities and programs.”
Shaffer’s attorney, Daniel Kurowski, said he was “pleased” with the appeals court’s decision to reverse the dismissals, and he looks forward to continuing his efforts to represent students who claim to have received a lower-quality education with remote classes during the pandemic.
“The D.C. Circuit correctly reversed the lower courts’ dismissal and agree with the panel’s conclusion that the lower courts erred in dismissing breach-of-contract claims and implied promise to provide on-campus services, activities and in-person education in exchange for tuition and fee payments,” he said in an email.
University spokesperson Crystal Nosal said the University transitioned to online learning because of recommendations from public health experts and orders from the District to conduct remote learning in the spring 2020 semester. Nosal said the University will continue to plead its case in court in spite of the setback.
“While we are disappointed with the Court’s decision, we look forward to defending the case on its merits,” she said in an email.
Nosal also thanked faculty and staff who assisted students through the transition to remote learning during the early stages of the pandemic.
“We are thankful to our faculty, who worked hard to provide our students with a quality academic experience by distance, and to our staff for providing mechanisms for students to meaningfully engage with each other,” she said.
Sandra Rodriguez, a spokesperson for American University, said AU is reviewing the decision and will “continue to defend” American from the lawsuit.
