Junior Liza Malinsky’s Instagram post sharing footage of the confrontation with her professor has received more than 13,000 likes.
Thousands have signed a petition calling for officials to fire a professor who a student said incorrectly claimed she couldn’t have a service dog in class.
Liza Malinsky, a junior majoring in business, said Disability Support Services officials told her that she didn’t need an official letter to attend classes with her service dog, Charlie, this academic year. But Marie Matta, an assistant industry professor of decision sciences who teaches Malinsky’s Operations Management class, raised an issue when Malinsky brought her service dog to class without paperwork earlier this semester.
Malinsky said she had told Matta during the first week of spring classes, which were held online, that she didn’t need documentation because her service dog did not require a DSS accommodation. But in a Jan. 25 class session with Charlie in the room, Matta and Malinsky argued openly in class, which Malinsky captured on video and shared on social media.
Matta did not return a request for comment, but Malinsky said her professor apologized over email Wednesday and acknowledged her actions were a mistake.
GW’s policy for service animals states that students are not required to submit an accommodation request to bring a service animal into campus buildings, except for residence halls. The Americans with Disabilities Act states that colleges can offer voluntary registries for service animals that “serves a public purpose,” like ensuring that emergency staff know to look for service animals in the event of an emergency.
“If I told you I needed glasses or a wheelchair to come to class, or I was using a hearing aid, I can tell you those things if I want to, there’s the voluntary reporting system,” Malinsky said in an interview. “But I’m not required by law to tell you ahead of time I’m coming with my medical device.”
A week after informing her professor about Charlie during virtual classes, Malinsky said Matta claimed the service dog wasn’t allowed and she had discussed the issue with DSS.
But Malinsky said when she contacted the DSS office later that day, officials reiterated that the service dog was allowed.
Malinsky began recording her interaction with Matta in the next class, later posting the footage to Instagram Sunday. Malinsky said Matta raised an issue with the fact that Charlie is a pitbull before the recording began.
The video shows the two arguing and a GW Police Department officer eventually arriving in the classroom to discuss the dispute with Malinsky privately. Malinsky said she had wanted GWPD to come to intervene.

“This student won’t get rid of the dog from the class and has been told repeatedly that a disability support policy and procedure is that you’re not allowed a service dog in a classroom without paper accommodations,” Matta said to the officer in the video.
The officer asked Malinsky to step outside the room, where Malinsky said she showed the officer the email exchange with DSS confirming service dogs were permissible in class. The officer agreed with her, and Malinsky did not attend the remainder of the class, she said.
University spokesperson Crystal Nosal said officials from the Division for Student Affairs, DSS and the Office for Diversity, Equity and Community Engagement are “actively working” to provide support to those adversely affected by the “incident.”
“The University is also working with the GW School of Business leadership and will remain involved to ensure that GW students have an inclusive classroom experience,” Nosal said in an email. “Our students’ well-being is our highest priority.”
Nosal declined to say whether officials are planning to take disciplinary action against Matta, if they had received formal complaints about the incident and what training faculty receive on how to best accommodate students with disabilities.
She declined to say whether the GWPD officer filed a report for the incident.
Matta emailed an apology to Malinsky Wednesday morning, saying she was “operating on information that I now realize was incorrect” and acknowledged the “pain and distress” the situation caused Malinsky.
“I am deeply sorry for the pain this incident caused,” Matta said in the email. “I am committed to learning from this experience and moving forward in the most productive way to foster a more inclusive classroom experience for you and your peers.”
Carly Shaffer, a junior studying political communication who is one of Malinsky’s teammates with GW Cheer, started a change.org petition calling for officials to fire Matta “on the basis of discrimination.” As of Wednesday night, the petition reached more than 3,700 signatures.
They said they sent the petition to Anuj Mehrotra, the dean of the business school, on Monday and received a “very politically correct email” in response that didn’t address her questions.
“As the GW community, we must come together to stand with Liza Malinsky and everybody she is fighting for,” the petition reads. “Professor Marie Matta must be held accountable.”
Jhurney Hairston, a junior majoring in marketing, who is in the course with Malinsky, said Matta overreacted to the situation and should have talked to Malinsky privately, rather than in front of the whole class.
“She called Liza and her dog a liability,” she said. “It felt like she was just trying to make it seem like Liza was this aggressive person with this aggressive dog and everyone was in danger, when that just wasn’t the situation at all.”
Several student organizations, including GW College Democrats and the Panhellenic Association, posted statements on social media in support of Malinsky.
The Disabled Students Collective posted a statement on Instagram Tuesday condemning Matta’s actions and calling for officials to investigate Matta and GWPD’s actions to the “fullest extent.”
“The Disabled Students Collective is not an organization meant to fact-check ableist experiences,” the statement reads. “We wholeheartedly support and believe the victim of the situation, as well as every other student with accommodations on our campus.”

The Colonials were led in scoring by junior guard James Bishop and sophomore guard Joe Bamisile, who had 27 and 24 points, respectively.
Men’s basketball got their second consecutive win and third in four games in a 89-87 nailbiter over La Salle at home.
The Colonials (8-12, 4-4 A-10) were led in scoring by junior guard James Bishop and sophomore guard Joe Bamisile, who had 27 and 24 points, respectively. Bamisile had 17 points in the first half and Bishop chipped in 23 second half points.
Although GW led for 34 of the 40 minutes, the Explorers (6-13, 1-8 A-10) kept it close throughout the game and had a chance to win it at the buzzer. La Salle was led in scoring and assists by sophomore guard Jhamir Brickus, who finished with 20 points and eight assists.
GW set a season high for assists with 19 and 3-pointers with 13, but struggled rebounding, getting outrebounded 46-26. Similarly, La Salle had a 21-6 advantage on the offensive boards and a 20-4 edge in second chance points.
“It was a great college basketball game to watch,” head coach Jamion Christian said. “It’s kind of a tough college basketball game to coach. But it was good our team was able to step up and play offensively at the level we needed to. Obviously, defensively we really struggled guarding those guys tonight and they had some guys that had some really good nights and they did some things that we just struggled with today.”
GW started the game with a strong showing from junior forward Qwanzi Samuels, who had 8 points in the first eight minutes of the game, including two 3-pointers. Recently, opposing teams have been leaving Samuels open beyond the 3-point line, daring him to take long range shots.
This was the first time the District Heights, MD native has hit multiple 3-pointers in one game in his GW career. He finished the game with 8 points, four rebounds, two assists, a block and a steal.
For the rest of the half, it was the Joe Bamisile show. He seemingly couldn’t miss from behind the arc, finishing the half going 5-of-6 from 3-point range, with smiles and celebrations abound following each bucket.
GW as a whole finished with a staggering 10 3-pointers in the first half alone, tying the team’s season high for 3-pointers made in a game. The team excelled in transition throughout the game, especially in the first half, although Christian said it could have been even better.
“I think if we started making some better decisions in transition, we might have had like 24 assists tonight,” Christian said. “So, definitely some areas we can get better at, but I’m encouraged in our ability to move the ball.”
Going into the half, the Colonials led 48-46. Coming out of the break GW started strong offensively but struggled to get a stop.
On the first possession of the second half, Christian designed a play to get Bishop a look on a mid-range jumper. Bishop hit the shot and never looked back, scoring 23 points on 6-of-10 shooting in the second half.
Freshman guard Brayon Freeman had a great night, ending the game with 12 points, seven assists, three rebounds, two steals, and only one turnover. The DMV native showed his prowess driving into the lane, creating scoring opportunities for himself and his teammates.
Freshman guard Khalil Brantley helped the Explorers creep back into the game mid-way through the second half, scoring 8 of his 11 points in the second half and providing a spark for La Salle. Brantley finished the game with four rebounds, four assists and a steal to go along with his points total.
Hunter Dean had 13 points, six rebounds and a steal on 4-6 shooting from the field and 5-5 from the free throw line, a notable achievement as he had only made 8-20 so far this year.
Dean also tied a career high with five blocks. However, with 5:23 remaining, he picked up his fourth foul, limiting his minutes down the stretch.
After a relatively quiet second half, Bamisile popped up and hit a 3-pointer to extend the Colonials lead to 5 points heading into the final media timeout. A few minutes later, he took some contact on a Brickus layup and went down grabbing his ribs for a few moments.
But he soon popped back up and was able to finish the game with 24 points, four steals, two assists and two rebounds on 8-14 shooting from the field and 7-10 shooting from three. The seven made 3-pointers is a career high for Bamisile, who has steadily improved his 3-point shooting as the year has gone on.
“I’m a trooper,” Bamisile said.
The Explorers were able to pull within 3 points with 24 seconds left before Bishop crossed up La Salle sophomore guard Anwar Gill at halfcourt, causing the D.C. native hit the scorers table. Bishop then drew a foul and hit both free throws to put GW up 88-83 and seemingly ice the game.
But the Colonials didn’t make it easy on themselves, as Bamisile fouled Brickus on a made 3-pointer with five seconds remaining.
“We actually reviewed it yesterday in practice and two days before that, so you know, we got to obviously go back and review it again to make sure the guys understand,” Christian said. “In those situations where threes are the only things that can beat you, you just got to understand that once that guy dribbles inside the 3-point line, everybody should be expanding out.”
After Brickus made the free throw to make it 88-87 and La Salle head coach Ashley Howard took a timeout to draw up a full court press, Bishop was fouled again. This time he made the first shot and missed the second one.
Redshirt senior forward Clifton Moore grabbed the rebound and heaved up a halfcourt shot that would have won the game for the Explorers.
“I just said a prayer,” Bishop said. “I was just hoping he didn’t make that”
Fortunately for GW, the shot clanged off the back iron and the Colonials made it out victorious to remain in eighth place in the Atlantic 10.
The Colonials will look to win their third game in a row when they take on Davidson for a 2 p.m. tipoff at home. Davidson was ranked in the AP Poll last week and has wins over Alabama, Richmond and VCU this season, all away from home.

After receiving a text from my friend informing me that he tested positive for COVID-19, I scheduled a symptomatic test at the Colonial Health Center. The incubation period for the virus can take several days, so I decided to isolate until I received a negative test result five days after my exposure. But an email I received from the CHC stated that I was able to attend class and work, without a required quarantine period. Though I did not end up testing positive, there is a very real possibility that I could have and been attending in-person activities with the virus.
While many public health experts claim it is not necessary to quarantine due to exposure, infected individuals are still considered contagious two days before they receive a positive test result. It also took approximately 80 hours to receive my first test results, during which time I could have been spreading the virus. Though it is true that cases both in D.C. and at GW have been leveling off to pre-Omicron levels, hospitalizations for those D.C. area residents who have contracted the Omicron variant are at an all-time high. To protect the D.C. community, officials should improve either their test response turnaround time or tighten COVID-19 isolation protocols to stem the spread of the virus.
If GW is going to allow for all in-person activities to resume, they should take stronger precautions in terms of quarantine and self-isolation. It is too early to be relaxing COVID-19 protocol as those who have been exposed could have COVID-19 and pass it on to immunocompromised individuals.
Taking several days to return test results, especially to someone who has been exposed to COVID-19, is unacceptable because it leaves room for students to unknowingly be in public spaces, both on campus and off campus, while infected. To minimize the spread of this virus, officials should bolster the University’s testing apparatus to allow students to receive results within a day of testing.
Officials could also consider administering saliva-based tests – like SaliveDirect, a COVID-19 testing program created by Yale University’s School of Medicine – which delivers accurate results, most of them within 24 hours. The testing system also saves up to 75 percent of the costs by not requiring laboratory materials that are in short supply. It is currently a limited program but set to expand and could help achieve quicker, more accurate results.
Rapid saliva tests are also used by many universities, like the University of Illinois, which established a program that has sending individuals who receive a positive test are sent to quarantine within 30 minutes of receiving their results. GW could adopt a similar system by using rapid saliva COVID-19 testing that would ensure quicker results and consequently, quicker quarantine.
GW was recently approved to offer at-home COVID-19 tests. If the University moves forward with relying on at-home testing to report accurate results, there is the possibility of many false negatives. Currently, rapid at-home tests are missing almost 15 percent of positive cases, The New York Times reported. GW should ensure that these tests are as accurate as possible, which could be done if they are modeled after the saliva tests.
Morgan State University in Maryland switched to using rapid antigen testing in fall 2020 because they noticed that many students were experiencing anxiety while waiting for a prolonged period of time to get their results, according to a study conducted by the National Academies Press about COVID-19 testing strategies for colleges and universities. GW officials could use rapid antigen tests to quell students’ anxieties.
Some may argue that GW cannot afford to quarantine more students just for being exposed, but this is precisely why students should self-isolate in their rooms after exposure to decrease the likelihood of COVID-19 spreading – it will lead to fewer hotel rooms needed for those who do test positive.
Similar to Omicron, it is possible that the United States faces another variant of COVID-19 that sweeps across the community. The number of positive COVID-19 cases is currently decreasing, but to prevent the spread of another variant and the current one, it is important that the GW change its COVID-19 protocol to be more strict.
Almost 900,000 lives have been lost to COVID-19 in the United States alone. Resuming all in-person activities may be plausible, but officials have a responsibility to return test results in a more timely manner and require community members exposed to the virus to self-isolate until they receive a negative test result five days after exposure.

Metrobus had been operating on a Saturday schedule during weekdays since Jan. 10. 
Regular weekday Metrobus service will return Monday after COVID-19 outbreaks limited staffing and service for nearly a month.
Metrobus routes have been cut by about a quarter since Jan. 10 after “above-average absenteeism” forced the system to operate on its limited Saturday schedule for most of January, according to a release issued by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority last week. The release states staffing shortages have become less severe as COVID-19 cases continue declining, enabling the expansion of bus service.
WMATA officials announced in late December that 52 bus routes were experiencing delays and disruptions because of “periodic” operator shortages resulting from the number of drivers who had recently contracted COVID-19.
“I want to thank our customers for their patience as we took swift action to protect the health and safety of riders and employees in the face of the unprecedented COVID surge, which has impacted about 10 percent of our workforce since the holidays,” WMATA CEO and General Manager Paul Wiedefeld said in the release.

Meyers Taylor will not attend the Opening Ceremony as she recovers from COVID-19. 
Alumna Elana Meyers Taylor was elected by her Team USA teammates to walk the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics as a flagbearer, becoming the first bobsledder to carry a flag since 1956.
But speed skater Brittany Bowe will walk on behalf of Meyers as the bobsledder announced on Instagram that she tested positive for COVID-19 Saturday. Meyers, along with her husband and son, tested positive two days after their arrival in Beijing.
“I can’t think of a better honor, other than walking by myself, than having the opportunity to give to Brittany,” Meyers Taylor said in an interview with The Today Show on Wednesday. “Brittany is an absolutely amazing human being.”
A wave of uncertainty has arisen regarding Meyers’ participation in the bobsledding squad with the events being held in just 12 days. Meyers is a favorite contender for gold in the monobob event. Currently, Meyers holds first place in the world ranking of women’s monobob.
“I am asymptomatic and currently at an isolation hotel – and yes I am completely isolated,” Meyers said in her Instagram post. “This is just the latest obstacle that my family and I have faced on this journey, so I’m remaining optimistic that I’ll be able to recover quickly and still have the opportunity to compete.”
Meyers is one of nine members of Team USA to test positive since Monday night, The Wall Street Journal reported.
The 2022 COVID-19 protocols for the Beijing Olympics require athletes who test positive to isolate at a facility where they must stay until they have no symptoms and test negative three consecutive days.

This year's theme, Homecoming – Been Black, is in response to the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Black communities. 
A D.C.-based fashion designer delivered the keynote address of GW’s 17th annual Black Heritage Celebration Tuesday, recapping her career as a “changemaker” in business.
Dionna Dorsey – the creator of District of Clothing, a progressive lifestyle brand that uses social-justice-oriented messages to inspire action – said she has spearheaded a pair of businesses in recent years to serve the Black community through the COVID-19 pandemic and widespread racial justice movements. Dorsey’s keynote address was the first of this year’s BHC events headlined by the theme, “Homecoming: Been Black,” which aims to represent how Blackness has endured despite circumstances that have exacerbated racial inequity, including the pandemic.
Dorsey said the theme encourages students to recognize how past generations of Black Americans struggled and made sacrifices for the benefit of modern-day Black entrepreneurs. She said young Black people should take advantage of modern economic opportunity, connect with one other and pursue their passions with purpose.
“It’s really about remembering what they did to get you here and just knowing that you literally are their wildest dreams,” she said during the keynote address. “To me, that’s what ‘Been Black’ is.”
Dorsey said she first struggled to find work in the fashion industry in the wake of the Great Recession in 2009 before finding the courage to create Dionna Design, her branding company that launched in 2010, and District of Clothing, which launched in 2014. She said her family taught her to persevere through challenges like imposter syndrome in the fashion industry.
“I can very clearly point that to my family,” Dorsey said. “The way in which they’ve always spoken to me is like, ‘No is not an answer – no means next opportunity,’ and you just have to keep pivoting until you get where you need to be and also understanding that life is filled with challenges, and you can’t allow those challenges to stop.”
Dorsey called District of Clothing her “ministry,” the vehicle she uses to pursue her passions and goals. She said she can encourage pride and confidence through her business as a way to serve her community.
“You have to be of service to your community, and District of Clothing is just that,” she said. “The goal is to encourage progression, to inspire action and to support self love.”
Dorsey said a changemaker who acts as a “global citizen” should have empathy for people impacted by social issues and injustice, which can fuel their passions and advance their goals.
“Having the courage to follow your heart and to follow your dreams and the things you really want to do, that in itself is being a changemaker,” she said. “Because seeing someone else do it can be inspiring to whoever is watching.” 
Dorsey said working during the pandemic and posting information like mask-making tutorials created a “realm of peace” for her as she sought to maintain community. She also noticed demonstrators wearing her branded clothing during Black Lives Matter protests, which she said motivated her to continue working in 2020.
“The pandemic really has been very challenging, and yet it has also been a very eye-opening experience but also a very community-building time for me,” she said.
Dorsey said Black entrepreneurs need to embrace what they can learn through struggle and failure, like a lack of money or supplies. She said her experience struggling to start and maintain her companies through the Great Recession and the pandemic taught her to believe in herself and proved she had all the skills necessary to be successful.
“I would tell myself, ‘You’re going to be OK to fail forward, to fail fast,’” Dorsey said. “And that failure is actually really important because if you don’t fail, you’re not really giving yourself the opportunity to learn from failure.”

Bauman will develop a clinical cancer program through expanding the oncology service line and provide fundraising initiatives to more than 180 participating faculty across SMHS.
Julie Bauman, a professor of medicine and the deputy director of the Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Arizona, will become director of the GW Cancer Center next month.
Officials announced in a release last week that Bauman will “enhance” the clinical, research and academic operations of the center, which can become the leading provider of cancer care and research in the District. Bauman will also teach as a professor of medicine in the School of Medicine and Health Sciences upon joining the University.
“I look forward to engaging the superb basic, population, and clinical scientists across GW schools in a shared vision to defeat cancer,” she said in the release. “I am dedicated to understanding the cancer priorities of the vibrant and diverse D.C. communities and growing the multi-disciplinary cancer services that will bring cutting-edge science to our patients.”
Bauman will expand the oncology service line and provide fundraising initiatives to more than 18 participating faculty across SMHS to develop a clinical cancer program, according to the release. She aims to work with the GW Hospital and the Washington D.C. VA Medical Center and assist underserved patient populations with equal access to cancer care in the area.
Officials said Bauman’s plans will improve patients’ lives and further cancer research to educate future generations in the medical community.
“We are thrilled Dr. Bauman will lead the George Washington University Cancer Center,” interim University President Mark Wrighton said in the release. “She is well-equipped to oversee cancer care, research, prevention and education in collaboration with faculty and leadership across our campuses.”
Barbara Bass, the dean of SMHS and the CEO of the Medical Faculty Associates, said Bauman’s experience as a clinician-scientist will help her build the “necessary” infrastructure for clinical trials and promote health care studies enrollment with her research.
“I look forward to working with Dr. Bauman to expand the critically important cancer-focused efforts at GW and provide high-quality care to those throughout our expanding metropolitan region,” she said in the release.

Officials said on-campus students can “pull-in” friends to their room if their roommates decide to move off campus or forgo participation in the room renewal option.
The University will allow some campus residents to stay in their current residence hall units during the next academic year, according to an email that the University sent to students Tuesday.
Students can submit room renewal applications between Feb. 15 and Feb. 22 if they’re living in Amsterdam, Francis Scott Key, Fulbright, Guthridge, JBKO, Munson, Shenkman and South halls, District and International houses, The Dakota, 1959 E Street and 2109 F Street, according to the email. Officials cannot guarantee room renewals for next year if students submit applications through the Campus Living and Residential Education portal after Feb. 15, according to the Division for Student Affairs website.
Students cannot request room renewal if they’re living in Potomac House, the Aston, One Washington Circle, Building JJ, Lafayette, Madison and Mitchell halls, Mount Vernon Campus housing, Fraternity and Sorority Life housing and District House affinity suites.
Officials said on-campus students can “pull-in” friends to their room if their roommates decide to move off campus or forgo participation in the room renewal option. Students can still opt for the standard housing application process, even after they are approved for renewed housing, according to the email.
Students can also remain in their current rooms if they plan to live on campus during the summer, according to the University’s website.

The team had been known as the Washington Football Team for the past 18 months as they searched for a new, permanent name. 
After 18 months of speculation, the Washington Football team NFL franchise unveiled the Washington Commanders as its new name Wednesday morning on the Today show.
“As an organization, we are excited to rally and rise together as one under our new identity while paying homage to our local roots and what it means to represent the nation’s capital,” co-owner and co-CEO Dan Snyder said in a release. “As we kick-off our 90th season, it is important for our organization and fans to pay tribute to our past traditions, history, legacy and the greats that came before us.”
Team president Jason Wright and former Washington Superbowl winning quarterback Doug Williams revealed the new uniforms on the Today show. The team will be clad in sets that maintain the traditional burgundy and gold colors but will now incorporate three stars and two bars inspired by the D.C. flag.
Wright said the team is still looking for a mascot but will continue listening to fan feedback to help work on an idea.
“I’m going to hug Commanders, because that’s what we are, and we’ve got to go forward with it,” Williams said on the show.
The announcement received mixed responses on Twitter as reactions ranged from unimpressed to hopeful over the new change in the team. Mayor Muriel Browser released a statement on Twitter saying the name change represented the “next chapter” for the team.
“Washington football franchise has had a storied history, and we are excited that today will begin a new, necessary chapter as the Washington Commanders,” Bowser said in the tweet. “Sports means so much to our civic pride and are an essential part of our economic engine, creating jobs, and opportunities for our residents and revenue to fund essential services.”
The team was originally founded in 1932 as the Boston Braves before it changed its name to the Boston Redskins the next year. In 1937, the franchise moved to D.C. and became the Washington Redskins.
Snyder purchased the team in 1999. He told USA Today in 2013 that he wouldn’t change the Redskins as long as he owned the team saying, “We’ll never change the name. It’s that simple. NEVER — you can use caps.”
The name change comes after the team did away with its previous name, the Washington Redskins, in July 2020 after a rise in criticism from Native American advocacy groups, dating back to the 1960s, that emphasized the derogatory nature of the name. At the time, the club’s top sponsors threatened to terminate their deals and D.C. elected officials guaranteed the team’s removal from the city if there was no name change, providing the final push to change the name.
In August, the team updated their stadium policy and protocol to prohibit fans from wearing Native American inspired ceremonial headdresses or face-paint, marking a move away from their 87-year-old moniker.
“We are very excited about our final selection, which aligns with our values, carries forth our rich history, represents the region and, most importantly, is inspired and informed by you, our fans,” Wright said on the Today show.
