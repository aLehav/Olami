During the chase, Archie brandished a 3- to 4-inch brown knife and threw a plastic water bottle at Harling, which missed and struck a nearby pedestrian, according to the report.
A pregnant woman was arrested at the GW Hospital Tuesday after chasing another woman with a knife, according to a Metropolitan Police Department report.
The report states Tawanda Archie chased Kejuana Harling from the Metro station to GW Hospital with a knife drawn after the two briefly interacted near the station’s entrance. Archie tried speaking to Harling outside the station a few moments earlier but failed to notice Harling’s hearing impairment that prevented her from communicating, prompting Archie to take “an aggressive stance” and rush at Harling, the report states.
During the chase, Archie brandished a 3- to 4-inch brown knife and threw a plastic water bottle at Harling, which missed and struck a nearby pedestrian, according to the report.
The report states Metro Transit Police Department Officer Logan Kent responded to the scene at 4:04 p.m. and found Archie yelling in front of the ascending escalators outside the station. MTPD Officer “L Jensen” couldn’t find the brown knife when he searched her for weapons, and he transported her to the GW Hospital “for a complaint of high blood pressure and being six months pregnant,” the report states.
The report states MTPD officers arrested Archie at the hospital after she was medically cleared and found a small glass pipe in her jacket pocket, which Archie said she used to smoke crack cocaine. MPD officers transported Archie to the Second District Police Station for processing at 7:49 p.m., the report states.
MPD officers charged Archie with assault with a dangerous weapon, simple assault and possession of drug paraphernalia, according to the report.
MPD spokesperson Sean Hickman declined to comment.

Deans and unit leadership will identify reductions in non-recurring expenses to fully eliminate the remaining deficit, LeBlanc said.
Faculty and staff will not receive salary reductions as part of budget cuts following weeks of deliberations by top administrators.
University President Thomas LeBlanc said officials are no longer considering “across-the-board” salary cuts for faculty and staff to close the remainder of GW’s annual budget gap, which has now been reduced from $180 million to $160 million, according to an email sent to faculty and staff Thursday. Officials have already announced $100 million in cuts during the first phase of financial mitigation and will close the remaining $60 million through reducing non-recurring expenses and using some of the University’s unrestricted assets.
“I especially want to thank the Faculty Senate and its committees for the hundreds of hours of thoughtful and deliberative consultation with leadership to navigate the challenges,” LeBlanc said in the email. “And to all of our faculty and staff, I remain grateful for your dedication to GW and for your resilience, your patience and your understanding, as we have worked together to prioritize health, safety, care and our core academic mission.”
LeBlanc said at a senate meeting earlier this month that officials had discussed an employee salary cut but had not made a final decision. The Faculty Association condemned a future salary cut last month.
Officials will use “up to” $20 million of GW’s unrestricted assets to help close the budget gap, LeBlanc said in the email. Deans and unit leadership will identify reductions in non-recurring expenses to fully eliminate the remaining deficit, he said.
“Although the pandemic and its effects on our University have been very fluid, members of University leadership and I feel confident that the totality of the actions taken and announced will now address our current financial challenges,” LeBlanc said. “To be clear: Barring a significant change in the pandemic and its impact, we believe that these final steps will conclude our budget mitigation for this fiscal year.”
Officials suspended most capital projects and hirings, froze all salaries with an additional pay cut by some top administrators and laid off hundreds of staff during the first phase of budget cuts, which reduced expenses by $100 million.
LeBlanc said these actions will be completed “in the coming weeks.” He said at the senate meeting earlier this month the first phase would be completed by Friday.
Some of these decisions have led hundreds of faculty, staff and students to sign onto statements and petitions condemning officials’ financial mitigation strategy, with some calling on LeBlanc to resign.
LeBlanc said he is “hopeful” the suspension of the University’s retirement contributions for employees, which will begin Oct. 1, may be shorter in duration if GW experiences a “robust” spring enrollment, and administrators will provide an update in December.
“Every member of our community can help in this regard by giving our students the highest quality experience this semester,” LeBlanc said. “I have heard from many students about the positive experience they are having so far, and I want to thank each of you for your work to make the fall virtual term a success.”

It’s easy to complain about the online semester and list all the ways it might hinder your education. We don’t have our friends to push us through late nights in Gelman Library, and Peet’s Coffee is no longer at our beck and call. Given this new reality, we need to find ways to stay virtually engaged with our professors and each other this semester to maximize our learning.
For starters, students should try to find a quiet place to work and designate it as a studying spot. That will help us set boundaries between work and home and better maintain a balanced lifestyle. It may be tempting to attend class laying in bed or on the couch, but these areas are not conducive to productivity. Writing notes by hand becomes difficult and even more so, the urge to nap can become overwhelming. Try to find a spot outside the bedroom or away from couches while you’re focusing on class.
Next, turn off your phone and turn on your Zoom camera. It’s difficult to avoid the never-ending distraction of a cell phone, but it can make all the difference in focusing during online classes. We know multitasking hurts productivity and focus, so every time we’re scrolling through social media, we’re averting our attention and missing information and discussion. We should instead turn on our cameras to ensure professors know we’re present and listening. In my experience, even after my lab facilitator asked the class to turn on our cameras during the first week, I was the only one who followed suit. Her eyes lit up, and she even waved at me. This interaction made me realize how off-putting it can be for instructors to only see names on a screen. If you don’t want to use a live camera, you could at least consider adding a profile picture to your account. That way, your professor can put a face to your name.
Finally, take the time and energy to get to know your classmates and professors. Faculty have set up weekly office hours to make themselves available to students – use them. It’s our responsibility to meet our professors halfway and use the resources they’re providing to us to get to know them this semester. We could also stay engaged with our peers by setting up group chats or virtual study sessions using platforms like GroupMe. Moreover, GW should utilize the roster feature listing everyone in our classes on Blackboard as an additional resource to build connections.
At the end of the day, it is our responsibility to make the most out of our education and build a community with our professors and classmates. Despite all of the challenges of virtual learning, we must find a space conducive to learning, get rid of distractions that are within our control and reach out to the people in the same situation as us – our peers and professors.

The Berliner's German street food is an affordable alternative to Oktoberfest that will keep you coming back.
In a COVID-19-free world, millions would be gathering in Munich for Oktoberfest this fall. But a flight to Germany isn’t exactly possible right now, so I settled for the next best thing.
Just a 20-minute walk from campus at 3401 Water St. NW in Georgetown, The Berliner is a beer hall that dishes out German fare and an assortment of craft beers. The pub offers an abundance of outdoor and indoor seating at long picnic tables, so you can share a few drinks with a large group of friends.
The beer menu is extensive and relatively affordable. You can order domestic beers from breweries in cities like D.C., St. Louis and Baltimore, as well as international options from Germany and Austria. A .25L of beer starts at $6, and a full liter starts at $12.
Non-beer drinkers can also sip on a selection of wines like an Italian pinot grigio ($10) or an Austrian pinot noir ($11).
The beer selection is what initially attracted me to The Berliner, but I was unexpectedly blown away by the food selection. The Berliner focuses on German street foods, serving dishes like currywurst ($14) – a fried bratwurst cut into pieces and topped with curry ketchup – chicken schnitzel pitas ($16) and a selection of German sausages.
Each sausage is placed on a New England-style hot dog bun and comes with a choice of topping. You can choose from toppings like sweet peppers, onions, mustardy chili sauce, sauerkraut and caramelized onions. And for just an extra $1, customers can add on an additional topping.
Since I don’t eat meats like veal or pork, I was stoked to see a chicken option on the menu. The dish ($8) was made with fennel, fresh herbs and a bit of white wine. I topped off the sausage with a combination of caramelized onions and beer cheese sauce.
It seemed that the sausage itself was pan-fried – it was golden brown on the outside and glistening. As for the taste, I’m usually off-put by the licorice-like flavor of fennel, but it was cooked down in the sausage, making it milder and slightly floral. The white wine added a slight, but welcome bitterness to the sausage itself.
The toppings took the dish to the next level. The caramelized onions were jammy and sweet, while the beer cheese sauce was decadent, salty and gooey. Even the bun – which is usually an overlooked element of a sausage – elevated the dish with its soft interior and buttery, golden exterior. Paired with my triple peach saison beer ($16 for 1L), the sausage didn’t disappoint.
Georgetown’s restaurant scene sometimes feels a bit touristy or overpriced, but The Berliner stands out from the crowd. With its affordable prices and delicious food and beer, it’s a spot you don’t want to miss.

Students are undoubtedly facing a tough semester, and professors are trying to accommodate as much as possible. We should expect professors to be understanding of students’ needs or situations in the months ahead, but we should never grow to take advantage of their kindness.
A student in a class of 20 said she needed to miss a lecture earlier this month because she had tested positive for COVID-19. The professor was understanding and gave the student a pass on the assignment that was due that day. But later that day while I was scrolling through Snapchat, I saw that same student had instead gone on a brunch picnic with friends during the hour when class was held. I can’t say for sure that she lied to our professor, but it infuriated me. As a student who is working two part-time jobs in addition to taking classes, I need all the flexibility my professors can give me. When students scam their professors into sympathy, those who actually need extensions and compassion are at a major disadvantage.
“There are students who truly need help – don’t be the person to play a crackling noise on your computer to get out of answering a question. It shows a great deal of privilege and is genuinely rude to professors.”
Taking advantage of professors goes beyond something as significant as making up excuses to miss class. It can be something as small as not turning on your camera during class or pretending to have technical difficulties during class. There’s some disagreement about whether professors can require students to turn on their cameras, as some students might not be comfortable sharing the environment where they’re taking the class. Those students should be able to turn off their cameras and not be questioned if they let the professor know in advance. But in large part, a professor sitting in a class full of black, empty boxes is rather sad – the professor looks like they’re talking into the void. Most importantly, it can cause the professor to distrust a student who actually needs the accommodation. 
I have also seen countless posts on Instagram and TikTok where students demonstrate ways to fake technical difficulties by changing their user names to “reconnecting” or playing glitchy sounds to make it seem like their audio doesn’t work. Not only is this ridiculous given what we are all paying for our education, but it shows privilege in some students. Some of us have a terrible Wi-Fi connection and can’t fabricate it over Zoom.
At the end of the day, students need to put themselves in our professors’ shoes. Professors are trying their best to be understanding of students this semester, but there’s a point where they may begin to question whether we actually need the accommodations we’re asking for. There are students who truly need help – don’t be the person to play a crackling noise on your computer to get out of answering a question. It shows a great deal of privilege and is genuinely rude to professors. 
We should want the same thing this semester: to be able to learn and attend classes. In a time of national crisis, we must all be more understanding of each other and the personal situations that we are all in. This is a difficult time for everyone – some students are forced to learn in toxic environments, some have had to pick up additional jobs, some have to take care of their family and some are in less than ideal technological conditions. Not everybody is in the same position in life right now, and it is imperative that we all are able to look past our own selfish wants and needs to consider how our actions may impact others. That starts with our relationships with professors.

With fall sports delayed until the spring semester, The Hatchet is checking in with head coaches from affected programs to gain insight on how each team is handling the pause on competition. Check back each week for new installments.
Women’s rowing and softball are going back to the basics as they prepare for a spring season.
The Atlantic 10 postponed fall competition to the spring, affecting fall regattas and scrimmages across the conference. Head women’s rowing coach Marci Robles and head softball coach Shane Winkler, whose teams were also affected by the canceled spring season, said the teams are holding online meetings and focusing on skills and fundamentals to stay plugged in this fall.
Here’s how the two teams are using the fall to prepare for spring play:
Women’s rowing
About half of the team’s 40-member roster are living in Foggy Bottom this fall, Robles said.
Women’s rowing traditionally competes during the fall term, but the bulk of its competition season comes in the spring. The Colonials usually compete in two to four regattas in the fall and double that number in the spring.
The team has begun specialized skill-focused workouts for student-athletes who are currently in the District. Robles said those who are still at home are working out voluntarily depending on the facilities available to them, and the coaching staff is working individually with them to figure out a training plan.
“There’s a much greater focus on technique,” Robles said in an email. “At this point, we’re only rowing small boats so we’re able to really break things down and take our time. Since we’re not racing this fall, there’s no rush to prepare for competition.”
Robles added that she wasn’t surprised by the decision to postpone the fall season, and coaches are continuing to meet with the squad regularly to keep them engaged. Rowers meet in small groups throughout the week, and the team meets all together at the end of each week, she said.
Softball
Softball welcomed 17 of its 23 players back to campus this fall and recently hit the field to practice for the first time this semester, Winkler said. He said student-athletes who did not return to campus have access to nearby facilities to practice, and the coaching staff is frequently keeping in touch with them.
“A lot of communication, a lot of getting on video calls and keeping them in tune with what we’re doing,” Winkler said. “When we start our team practices, we’ll stream some of those to the girls at home so they can watch how practice is going and learn.”
Winkler said as a spring sport, softball is not missing out on as many activities as other programs. He said the team’s biggest loss is the eight planned scrimmages, which included Power Five competition, that helps players get some extra practice in before the spring slate.
The squad added nine new players to its roster for the 2021 campaign. Winkler said he plans to hold scrimmages against one another to help the first-years get acquainted with college play and build chemistry.
“Right now we’re learning new habits,” Winkler said. “Social distancing, wearing the masks, making sure we’re taking every precaution necessary against COVID, but right now it’s slow-paced and really getting back into things.”

Men's basketball head coach Jamion Christian said he began implementing initiatives for athletes to discuss social justice issues like voting and law enforcement. 
Men’s basketball is partnering with other Atlantic 10 basketball programs to combat systemic racism.
Assistant coaches throughout the league organized Connecting for Change, which looks to educate teams on topics like Black history and voter registration and encourage student-athletes to use their voices to combat racism. Each program will bring in four speakers to cover topics like law enforcement and voting registration, and teams will work to find internship opportunities for their respective student-athletes.
“We want our student-athletes to come here and excel on the basketball court, absolutely, but, we definitely empower them to find their voice, excel in the classroom, connect with mentors and alumni and try to expand themselves and really hone their voice to find their identity,” assistant men’s basketball coach Graham Bousley said.
Bousley said assistant coaches in the A-10 were inspired by their colleagues in the Big East who created a similar program. A group of assistant and head coaches and athletic directors organized the program based on three pillars – educate, empower and evolve.
He said the program is currently led by coaches, but they’re trying to figure out ways to add student-athletes to leadership positions. The organization is composed of just A-10 men’s basketball programs, but it may expand to other sports or conferences in the future, he said.
Head coach Jamion Christian said prior to the program’s formation, the team has already heard from several guest speakers like NBA players and litigators from New York and D.C. about social justice issues.
He added that he’s been working to connect athletes with professionals to help players prepare for jobs post-graduation through the Leroy Charles Mentorship Program, which he instituted in his first season with the program.
“We want to get our players internships in the field that they’re excited about and help them grow their knowledge in those ways,” Christian said. “We’re really passionate, and we’re going to continue to be consistent in that effort because we’ve been able to provide those opportunities for them.”
Players will also wear customized warm-up shirts for all A-10 matchups as part of the initiative. Individuals from Black history will be honored prior to each conference game by a member from each school, who will read and discuss their importance. The discussion will be televised and recorded.
Christian said honoring individuals from Black history will help continue conversations around racial inequality and social justice by ensuring “the world knows we’re not forgetting these people.”
“We’re committed as a league and committed as a team and a program to continue to educate our world about the injustices that are happening all around us, that are affecting us and our communities,” he said.
Women’s basketball players have also taken a stand against social injustice, joining Athletes Driving Change, an organization promoting equality through education and service. Connecting for Change will also work with the A-10’s Commission on Racial Equity, Diversity and Inclusion.
Christian said current student-athletes are the world’s future leaders, and initiatives like Connecting for Change can help them gain the strength to speak up about issues plaguing their community and country.
“We want to empower student-athletes,” Christian said. “We want to hear their voices. We want to hear how they’re feeling, what they’re saying, and then we want to go out and create change in our world.”

The email states the testing center will be located downstairs in the food court area.
Foggy Bottom’s two in-house testing centers are moving to Shenkman Hall, according to an email sent to students Wednesday.
The Foggy Bottom GW COVID-19 in-house testing center and the Medical Faculty Associates’ testing center are moving to Shenkman Hall, located at 616 23rd St. NW, the email states. Both testing locations, previously located at the Smith Center, will start taking student appointments at Shenkman starting Monday.
“All appointments scheduled for Sept. 28 and beyond will be automatically moved to Shenkman Hall,” the email said.
The email comes a day after officials announced the Foggy Bottom testing centers would be expanding services to students living off campus who want to receive a free COVID-19 exam.
The email states the testing center will be located downstairs in the food court area. Students can make appointments through the medical portal and select “Shenkman Hall” as the location in the dropdown menu, the email states.
“The testing center is located downstairs in the food court area,” the email said. “If you have an appointment, you should proceed to the University check-in station. There will be separate check-in stations for University and MFA testing.”

Officials are expanding GW’s in-house testing to include off-campus students if they show symptoms of COVID-19 or believe they have been exposed to the virus.
Administrators said in an email to the GW community Tuesday that the expansion will help protect the “entire community” and provide “insight” into off-campus positive cases. The Delta Tau Delta fraternity shut down their off-campus house last week after some members tested positive.
“The COVID-19 transmission rate in the Washington, D.C. region continues to be significant,” officials wrote in the email. “We have confirmed several positive COVID-19 cases among members of our student population who are not part of the on-campus cohort. It is important to identify, isolate and provide support for all cases, as well as health care, where needed.”
Students will be eligible for the test if they present symptoms of the virus or “are worried” they have had “possible COVID-19 contact.” Off-campus students in these cases can now schedule a test by logging into GW’s medical portal, according to the email.
“If you don’t meet these criteria and you want to be tested for other reasons, you may arrange for testing through the Medical Faculty Associates or other testing sites in the area,” the email states.
Ten members of the GW community have tested positive for COVID-19 since officials began the University’s in-house testing in mid-August, according to the University’s testing dashboard. Officials have conducted more than 10,000 COVID-19 tests since Aug. 15.
Roughly 500 students remaining on campus are required to receive a test regularly in addition to all employees and contractors working on campus.
Officials said test results continue to be made available within 24 hours and are automatically shared with GW’s contact tracing team.
“In this way, we hope to be able to provide prompt clinical care and other support to any of our students in the region who contract the COVID-19 virus,” officials said in the email.
