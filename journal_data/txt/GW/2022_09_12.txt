U.S. News ranks universities based on factors like graduation and retention rates, available financial resources for students and average alumni donation rate.

GW rose to No. 62 in this year’s U.S. News and World Report rankings of the best colleges and universities in the country, which were released Monday.
Up one spot from its No. 63 ranking last year, GW is now tied with Syracuse University, the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, the University of Pittsburgh and Virginia Tech. The 2022-23 rankings mark the third-straight year in which GW has climbed since dropping seven spots to No. 63 in 2018-19 academic year.
“The University’s steadfast commitment to transforming the world through excellence in education, research and patient care remains our top priority,”  Provost Chris Bracey said in a release. “Our advancement in this year’s rankings is a testament to the dedicated, innovative work of our entire university community in fulfilling our academic mission.”
U.S. News ranks universities based on factors like graduation and retention rates, available financial resources for students and average alumni donation rate.
U.S. News banned GW from national university rankings in 2012 after officials admitted to inflating the percentage of students that were top high school students. But it started to include the University again in 2013 after giving less consideration to the percent of students who graduated in the top 10 percent of their high school class in rankings.
Columbia University fell 16 spots in this year’s rankings to No. 18 after admitting to submitting inaccurate data that bolstered its standing in U.S. News’ rankings.
Of GW’s 12 peer schools, 10 of them rank higher than GW. The University tied with two of its peer schools, Syracuse University and the University of Pittsburgh, at the No. 62 spot.
Georgetown University, one of GW’s peer schools, rose to No. 22, while New York University and the University of Southern California tied for No. 25 on this year’s rankings. Tulane, Boston and Tufts universities also tied for No. 44, while Rochester University was ranked No. 36.

Denver Brunsman is an associate professor and the associate chair of the history department.
For the past several years, GW’s faculty have rarely applauded the University’s administration for its handling of pandemic-related layoffs, questionable hiring decisions and plans to cut undergraduate enrollment. But in their handling of the push to change the Colonials moniker, the presidential administrations of Thomas LeBlanc and Mark Wrighton and the Board of Trustees all deserve praise. In June, the Board reached a thoughtful decision to end the use of Colonials after the current academic year, but even more importantly, it did so with a process that is beyond reproach.
The past three years of deliberation over the moniker have raised the ceiling of shared governance – another common lament of faculty – bringing together students, faculty, staff, alumni, athletics and the rest of the administration in a common pursuit of determining whether the Colonials name best reflects the values of the University.
I was an early critic of the administration’s initial response to the moniker issue and felt it moved too slowly in responding to concerns about the offensiveness of Colonials, particularly to Indigenous and international students. Yet, in hindsight, the administration wisely established a two-step process, creating the Naming Task Force to determine the overall process and criteria for evaluating a campus name change and establishing a Special Committee on the Colonials Moniker to decide whether to recommend renaming.
I had the privilege of serving as a member of the Naming Task Force and as an adviser for the Special Committee on the Colonials Moniker. Never in my 19 years as a professor have I been involved in campus efforts with such broad representation. The task force and committee together included 35 alumni, faculty, trustees, administrators, athletic representatives and students, including undergraduates, graduate students and student-athletes.
The special committee met weekly during the 2020-21 academic year and consulted with additional stakeholders, including leaders and representatives of the athletic department, study abroad, international programs, admissions, student affairs and financial planning and operations. The committee held three town halls, open to students, alumni, faculty and staff, and conducted a monthslong survey about those same groups’ feelings toward the moniker.
As with the best research inquiries, the moniker committee did not take a position until gathering all the evidence. After the committee delivered its final report to then-University President LeBlanc in March 2021 recommending that the University change its moniker, the Board took more than another year before accepting the recommendation.
The task force and committee both worked with a spirit of inquiry worthy of a top research university. The final product of the Naming Task Force, a framework for considering the renaming of campus buildings and other names, stands among the most careful and fair processes of its kind at any American college or university. The task force and another special committee have already effected the renaming of the Cloyd Heck Marvin Center to the University Student Center in light of the racist and antisemitic policies that tarnished the namesake’s administration as University president.
Understandably, not everyone is happy with the University’s decision to drop Colonials, but I would hope that even the strongest opponents would recognize the thoroughness and transparency of the process. This exhaustive deliberation stood in marked contrast to the original, arbitrary manner in which a single faculty member and administrator, Elmer Louis Kayser, came up with the Colonials moniker in 1926.
The special committee acknowledged in its final report that it had uncovered a divisive issue. In 2019, the student body voted to drop Colonials by a narrow majority of 54 percent. Similarly, the committee’s survey in 2020 of more than 7,300 alumni, students, faculty and staff determined that 44 percent favored removing the Colonials moniker, 43 percent favored keeping it and 13 percent expressed no preference.
One could logically ask whether it is worth dropping the moniker without overwhelming support for a change. In response, I would ask what percentage of students need to feel uncomfortable or offended by a name before it is changed. 10 percent? 20 percent? More? These students could not take pride in a symbol of conquest and oppression. As the committee determined, the Colonials moniker has worn out its original purpose of unifying and rallying the University community.
Critics of the decision have also resorted to a red herring. Watch out, they warn, the name of The George Washington University is next. I have tried my best to combat this falsehood in conservative media outlets by emphasizing that, as one of its first decisions, the task force determined that the University’s name was off limits.
Another misinformed charge suggests that dropping Colonials is a slight against George Washington. First, Washington and other early Americans almost never used “colonial” as a noun (it was an invention of the Colonial Revival, a historical preservation movement of the early 20th century), but when he did use the word, it was nearly always in a disparaging way. For Washington, who was committed to the American Union, “colonial” was synonymous with provincialism and small-mindedness, not the marks of either a great nation or a leading research university in the 21st century.
As a University community, we now have the chance to replace Colonials with a name that reflects George Washington and GW’s diverse stakeholders. In making this decision, I encourage the administration and Board of Trustees to follow the same inclusive, deliberative and stakeholder process that it used for the Naming Task Force and Colonials Moniker and Marvin Center special committees. I urge all students, alumni, faculty and staff – especially critics of the decision to drop Colonials – to become involved in this new naming process. My vote is for Buff & Blue. How about you?

Bracey said officials have agreed to adopt three of the task force’s data privacy core principles and relocate GW’s information technology division and the Office of Ethics, Compliance and Risk.
Updated: Sept. 19, 2022 at 4:10 p.m.
Officials announced that GW will adopt a new set of data privacy “core principles” after officials tracked community members’ whereabouts without their knowledge last fall.
Provost Chris Bracey said officials are implementing three new principles to be in line with “applicable” data laws and regulations, to make decisions around data and privacy principles transparently and clearly communicate new rules on how to use community members’ personal information. The new principles come from GW’s data privacy task force which made a series of recommendations for data privacy on campus over the summer after officials used the Wi-Fi system to track community members without their consent.
“The recommendations from this group — the data privacy task force — were submitted over the summer to the administration for the administration’s consideration,” Bracey said in a Faculty Senate meeting Friday. “I’m grateful for the work that the task force has done here and the collaborative effort that was undertaken to identify core principles and additional actions as we continue to work to develop a data governance policy.”
Bracey said officials have agreed to adopt three of the task force’s principles and relocate GW’s information technology division and the Office of Ethics, Compliance and Risk. Officials have reshuffled much of the University’s administration, placing GWIT back under the Office of the Provost, slotting communications and marketing under the presidential purview and putting human resources under the Chief Administrative Officer.
“In addition, since the data privacy task force was formed, the University has implemented several structural changes that better align the IT infrastructure and office with the academic mission of the University,” Bracey said in an email to community members Friday.
GW’s privacy policy states that any party acting on behalf of the University and processing data from the GW community must make a privacy notice to online users explaining how the information will be used.
Bracey said officials are considering several additional policies, including establishing a new data governance plan with the Faculty Senate’s input, allowing Student Association leaders to take part in data sharing policy decisions, amending the University’s privacy notice and implementing a new review and approval process for potential future data analytics projects similar to the one conducted last fall.
In interim University President Mark Wrighton’s original email to community members notifying them about the data tracking project last February, he said officials “de-identified” the data, meaning staff could track information like gender, but not community members’ names. He said in February while some officials may have had the ability to view individualized information, officials did not review individual information in the collected data, and any remaining data from the Wi-Fi tracking and collection would be destroyed.  
Last February, officials came under harsh criticism from faculty senators for lacking the appropriate infrastructure to monitor data collection on campus and failing to stop the data tracking program. At the time of the tracking last fall, both GWIT and the Office of Ethics, Compliance and Risk fell under the purview of former Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Mark Diaz.
“Through the careful implementation of these measures, we expect to create a more collaborative and more transparent environment that allows the University to realize the benefits of data analytics while protecting the privacy interest of our community members,” Bracey said at the meeting Friday.
This post has been updated to correct the following:
The Hatchet incorrectly reported that Bracey said the new principles were in line with the “appropriate” data laws and regulations. Bracey said the new principles were in line with the “applicable” data laws and regulations. The Hatchet incorrectly reported that the Communications and Marketing was under the chief financial officer. The office was under the Office of the President. The Hatchet incorrectly reported that Human Resource Management & Development was placed under the Office of the President. The office was placed under the chief administrative officer. The Hatchet also incorrectly reported that officials will review the data principles. Officials will provide updates regarding the principles. We regret these errors. This post has also been updated to clarify that the University is implementing new “core principles” of data privacy.

Cyclists whizzed by the Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument and the Capitol Building along the route, which hugged the National Mall, Potomac River and Capitol Hill.
Throngs of cyclists descended upon the streets of D.C. Saturday for the District’s sixth annual DC Bike Ride, breezing past quintessential landmarks along the National Mall and Potomac River.
The only organized bike ride sectioned off from city traffic in D.C. shut down 20 miles of streets – running along the Potomac River before passing campus via E Street and finishing near Capitol Hill – to unite bikers of all experience levels with a chance to get active, enjoy the outdoors and explore D.C. The event raised $50,000 from participant donations for nonprofit Dreaming Out Loud to fund its initiatives combatting food insecurity, Danielle Berman, DC Bike Ride’s events and partnerships coordinator, said.
DC Bike Ride spokesperson Kimber Westphall said about 9,000 riders joined the event in total.
“This is a bike ride for all,” Berman said. “Whether you love biking and you compete and you ride all the year round, or you’ve never picked up a bike before, this is for you.”
As the event expanded over the years, Berman said the event’s route has incorporated live music near the finish line, more sightseeing landmarks – like the Jefferson Memorial and the Arlington National Cemetery – and even entertainment, like a pit stop at Shake Shack. She said the ride continues to attract serious cyclists, though they understand that the event is about having fun instead of competition.
“People are coming more for the entertainment and seeing everything than necessarily trying to ride 20 miles,” Berman continued.
Cyclists, pedestrians and astute eyes alike have criticized the District for failing to prevent soaring traffic deaths – like one near campus over the summer – which have increased every year since 2015 and reached a 14-year high of 40 in 2021. Berman said she hopes the event provides a secure opportunity for cyclists to enjoy a ride, away from any risk that D.C. traffic may pose.
“We hope it means for the D.C. cycling community that cycling can become safer for D.C.,” Berman reflected. “It’s more accessible, hopefully, and that we can actually bring people together from all different parts of D.C. to make a big cycling community.”
Cyclists whizzed by the Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument and the Capitol Building along the route, which hugged the National Mall, Potomac River and Capitol Hill. Berman said the organizers worked with the District’s Department of Parks and Recreation and the Executive Office of the Mayor to close roads along the route and avoid ongoing construction projects without missing the notorious sights of the nation’s capital.
“We’ve had a really great relationship with the city – they are a huge reason why we’re doing it, why we’re able to keep doing it,” Berman commented. “It’s really important to us just to continue that relationship.”
Cyclists at the event could give back to the community with donations combatting food insecurity through Dreaming Out Loud – which works to create an equitable, healthy food system for marginalized communities in the D.C area. Berman said DC Bike Ride has donated about $170,000 to charities like the Wounded Warriors Project and the Washington Area Bicycle Association in its six-year history through rider donations.
“We love having them as partners,” Berman explains. “Every year, there’s a community component. And that’s a huge part of why we continue to do what we do.”
Kelvin Gordespe, a New York native who has lived in D.C for the past decade, said he participated because of his love of cycling, the crowd of participants and traffic-free roadways. He has biked to work the entire time he’s lived in the District, which he views as a better alternative to driving.
The ride offered free admission for children, making it especially family-friendly. Addie Rosado, a fourth grader from Alexandria, rode the 20-mile course with her parents. This was one of Addie’s first races after an incident in which she fell off her bike, scarring her chin.
“We just got her a bigger bike a year or two ago, and now she can ride up and down these hills and do the whole 20 miles with us,” her mother, Debbie Rosado, said at the event.
Like many other participants, the Rosado family participated to tour the District and bike through the National Mall without traffic. Debbie said she enjoyed the cheering audience, which included enthused spectators who rang bells as the riders emerged from underpasses along the route.
“I liked when we would go up a hill and then whenever we went downhill was probably my favorite part,” Addie said when reflecting on her accomplishments.
The event continues to grow each year and attract more people, including cyclists who participated in the event last year. Pansy Walker, who attended with a large group of friends, including one who came from Charlotte, North Carolina, said they participated in the DC Bike Ride in 2021 and hope to again next year.
“Cycling especially brings people together from different parts of the country,” Walker reflected. “We have something common that people like to do together.”
Through the hugging, cheers and revelry along the course that lasted through from the start of the ride to the live music at the finish line, DC Bike Ride was a diverse, feel-good party all around. Whether the cyclists participated by way of Capital Bikeshare, a rusted bike from their parents’ garage or the finest model on the market, everyone rode as one.
“So that’s really the goal, right,” Berman, of DC Bike Ride, said. “It’s to get people more excited about biking, to bring people to biking that maybe never would have gotten there in the first place.”

The Colonials gained their footing during the second match where they were able to win three out of the four sets played against the Rider team, increasing their offensive play to outshoot their opponent.
The Colonials split a doubleheader hosted at the Smith Center Friday, securing their first home victory in a pair of matches against Binghamton and Rider.
The Colonials (3-6) entered the day with a two-match winning streak after overtaking Long Island University and NJIT in Pennsylvania taking the two matches with 3–2 and 3–0, respectively. The GW team is currently totaling 373 kills, 33 aces and 341 assists after nine matches.
The GW team began the first match of the day with a powerless defensive effort as they were unable to overcome the Binghamton team, failing to win any set during the match. The Colonials gained their footing during the second match, where they were able to win three of the four sets played against the Rider team, improving their offensive play to outshoot their opponent.
“It was just taking care of our side we were, all credit to Rider, they were a very steady team, they did not make a lot of errors,” Head Coach Katie Reifert said in a post-match interview Friday.
Here’s a recap of the two matches:
Match 1
GW fell to Binghamton in straight sets in its first match of the doubleheader. The Bearcats maintained control throughout the match, grabbing early leads and forcing GW to try and claw their way back.
In the first set, Binghamton jumped to a 10–3 lead fueled by an aggressive offensive attack, and both sides traded points before Binghamton went on an 8–6 run and built their biggest lead of the set at 18–9, led by freshman opposite hitter Giulia Bonifacio. The GW defense locked up soon after as the offense pulled to within four, led by two kills from junior opposite Liv Womble.
Binghamton closed it out in what would be the tightest victory of the match at 25–20. The Bearcats notched 15 kills in the set compared to the Colonials’ 13, while maintaining an attack percentage of .324 against GW’s .216.
The second set was tighter early on and knotted up at eight following a four-point GW run with senior middle blocker Addie Feek serving. Mid set, GW’s defense faltered around the net as the Bearcats’ offense regained its footing and took a lead they wouldn’t lose, taking the second set 25–16.
The total kill comparison widened in the second set, with Binghamton scoring 15 to GW’s nine. GW’s attack percentage dramatically dropped to just .036.
The third set was the most dominant for Binghamton, as the Bearcats snatched it 25–14 and closed out the match. GW did their best to keep it close early, but a mid match, 8–3 run by the Bearcats put the match on ice.
“They put the ball on our side of the court over and over and just forced us to mess up,” Head Coach Reifert said.
Liv Womble and junior outside hitter Elizabeth Drelling led the way in kills for GW, scoring nine and eight, respectively. Freshman setter Dilara Elmacioglu topped the assist total for GW at 13.
“I just think that tonight we definitely started out we had people just doing their jobs which allowed everyone to really thrive instead of having to take care of one another,” Reifert said.
Match 2
The second matchup of the day came against the Rider University Broncos who fought the Colonials in a tightly contested match that stretched all the way to five sets.
The first set was tight, and neither squad led by more than four points. GW got the scoring started after Rider sent one soaring out of bounds, jumping to a 3-0 start. Womble showcased her craftiness early, faking a spike and tapping it over the net to regain the lead at 5-4.
GW narrowly held the lead throughout though, never extending beyond four points. Rider racked up 13 kills to GW’s 11 but could not capitalize near the end of the set, finally handing GW their 25th point after an errant serve.
Attendance at the Smith Center spiked from the first match to the second, creating a more intense atmosphere and a spirited match.
“I love playing in the Smith Center because you really feel the crowd right on top of you,” Reifert said. “That’s your home crowd cheering for you, it makes it all the better.”
Rider responded early in the second set, setting the stage for a battle where the lead changed hands seven times. After the Broncos took a 7–5 lead, Reifert called a timeout to regroup.
The back-and-forth action continued before the set tightened when a diving save from Drelling tied it up for the Colonials at 24. Rider managed to take the set after a classic bump, set and spike to make it 27–25, knotting up the match at 1–1. The Broncos notched 21 kills to the Colonials’ 12.
The third set continued the night’s back-and-forth theme as both teams looked to overtake the court but were ultimately unable to finalize the scoring run. The Colonials held a mid-set lead of 14-6, the largest of the night before Rider mounted a 7–1 run to pull it within three. The Colonials anchored around the middle all night with graduate middle blocker Tierra Porter, who managed to block many Rider’s spikes, meeting them at the net repeatedly.
“She steadied in, relied on her teammates a bit more, which allowed her to have a really great night,” Reifert said.
GW closed out the third set narrowly, 25–22, after a battle of blocks at the net that Porter led. The Broncos took the fourth set 25–17 in the largest margin of victory of the night and tied up the match 2–2. The lead went back and forth until Rider began to build a lead they would go on to hold, accumulating 13 kills to the Colonials’ nine.
The fifth and final set led GW to build an early 7–1 lead that Womble led. She guided the match in kills with 13, but the final point came on a block from Feek, which sealed the victory for GW.
The team’s first home win drew massive enthusiasm on the court and in the stands.
The Colonials coordinated the front line attacking players with back line defense players to take control of the court to increase their offense’s response capacity. Reifert said this helped the team play more confidently as they were able to communicate plays with each other.
“I think this was a huge confidence builder for us, just understanding that they played really confidently, our front and back row together,” Reifert said.
The Colonials prepare to take on Coppin State Tuesday, and tipoff is set for 6 p.m.

Officials said the pandemic led to "hundreds of millions" of dollars in losses for the University.
A District Court judge Wednesday dismissed a lawsuit that GW filed last year against an insurance company to seek compensation for building damages allegedly caused by coronavirus particles that infected residents spread through the air.
In the lawsuit filed last October, officials said Factory Mutual Insurance Company owed the University millions of dollars that the company refused to concede for the alleged damage despite an “all-risks” insurance policy that GW purchased from the firm in 2019. In the 12-page filing, District Court Judge Dabney Friedrich said the damages were not substantial enough to enact the insurance policy because coronavirus droplets can be cleaned off of surfaces and don’t present long-term structural alterations or damage to GW properties.
The dismissal is a blow to GW’s efforts to recover from financial strains caused by the pandemic, which officials said in the lawsuit cost the University “hundreds of millions” of dollars and led to a $180 million budget gap during the fiscal year 2021.
The University argued that the presence of COVID-positive individuals within campus buildings in 2020 spread coronavirus droplets through the air to settle on surfaces in GW facilities, leading to building closures and causing “physical loss or damages” that the firm should cover. Friedrich cited the lack of “tangible alterations” and lasting damage in the campus buildings in the dismissal.
Officials argued the insurance company should reimburse the University for pandemic-related improvements to buildings, like HVAC system upgrades and installations of Plexiglas barriers and hand sanitizing stations. Officials pointed to rulings in Colorado and California as precedent for coronavirus exposure to constitute physical damage, but the judge rejected those claims, saying the argument is invalid because droplets don’t cause long-term damage.
“Both courts accepted that viral droplets attach to surfaces, but they failed to explain how COVID-19 – which can be cleaned – plausibly causes long-lasting damage,” the judge said in the dismissal. “It is because of this missing link that the Court finds these cases unpersuasive.”
Friedrich said while D.C. courts have not considered whether COVID-19 can cause physical loss and damages to property, the “overwhelming majority” of other courts that have examined the question have ruled that the virus does not meet the definition.
“While COVID-19 poses a serious risk to humans, it does not threaten the integrity of physical structures,” the dismissal stated.

The student center workout space provides access to equipment like rowing machines, upright bikes, free weights and training balls and is open seven days a week from 7 a.m. to midnight.
On the third floor of the University Student Center, eight exercise bikes, two rowing machines, two benches and various medicine balls and barbells scatter an otherwise-barren conference room.
The makeshift gym is the new physical fitness space on the Foggy Bottom Campus, open seven days a week from 7 a.m. to midnight as the Lerner Health and Wellness Center enters its fourth month of renovations. Until Lerner’s targeted mid-fall reopening, the third-floor room in the student center and the West Hall gym on the Mount Vernon campus remain the only options for free gym access at GW.
“I was very, very unimpressed with the space,” sophomore Cameron Mays said about using the student center workout space. “And really, it didn’t allow me to do what I usually do, especially in Lerner.”
Lerner closed its doors in early May to update its HVAC system, upgrade equipment and redesign the building’s layout, and officials are offering alternative exercise spaces in the University Student Center and West Hall until the building reopens to students later this semester. More than 10 students said they are looking past GW’s scant fitness offerings to join off-campus gyms, play sports with friends and run outdoors.
Mays, who studies political science and economics, said he’s worked out in the student center about five times since August and was surprised to see how “underequipped” the space was, especially the lifting equipment that he typically uses. The student center workout room currently includes barbells but not dumbbells.
“I think it’s unfortunately forced a lot of people to go to off-campus gyms and to spend more of their money that way,” Mays said.
Mays said he relied on affordable alternatives, like running outside and playing basketball at a court in Georgetown, to avoid additional gym fees off campus. He said he looked into local gym memberships that the Lerner website recommends, but he was disappointed to see membership prices reach as high as $199 per month and modest student discounts varying by gym.
Students can display a school ID at gyms like Orangetheory Fitness, Soul Cycle and Washington Sports Club for a student discount at those gyms. Lerner also promotes the Active & Fit program, which grants access to 7,500 partnered gyms for $29 per month plus a two-month minimum, an enrollment fee and taxes.
“I think what really made me the most upset was the campus recreation site recommending and advising people to pay more money,” Mays said. “They’re like, ‘Oh, you can just get this special discount,’ but it’s like, why are you telling me to do this?”
Andre Julien – the senior associate athletic director of recreation, wellness and club sports – said to replace Lerner’s facilities, campus recreation staff drew maps of walking and running routes to replace treadmill cardio, decided to keep the Mount Vernon Campus pool open on weekends until Oct. 2 and created group fitness classes in the District House dance studio.
“The GW campus recreation team continues to provide for our students’ physical well-being needs while the Lerner Health and Wellness Center is temporarily closed this fall,” Julien said in an email. “Since we cannot host students inside the building while work is being performed, physical well-being opportunities in other locations both on and off campus are being offered until the building reopens.”
Julien said the University offering discounted memberships at local gyms has allowed students to partake in specialized exercise offerings like spin classes if the on-campus offerings haven’t appealed to them.
Piper Macke, a junior studying data science and a member of the GW women’s basketball team, said exercising at Lerner was crucial for her to strengthen her skills off the court. She said she would regularly utilize Lerner’s weightlifting rooms before its hiatus, but now she has started paying for a Gold’s Gym membership to stay active because of Lerner’s closure.
“I really like to just have something that I do that’s completely outside of basketball and isn’t always about getting better in my sport,” Macke said. “I like to have something just for me, and if I have to pay 15 extra dollars a month for a few months before Lerner is opened again, I’m willing to do so.”
Macke said driving to the Gold’s Gym in Rosslyn, Virginia has added an extra “hassle” in allotting time to work out alongside classes, practice and other commitments. She said she has had to skip workouts if traffic was too heavy or if she didn’t have time in her schedule to make the commute.
“I really wish that there were some other discounts or even anything that was just in walking distance because I looked really hard when I heard it was going to be closed all summer for some kind of gym within walking distance,” Macke said.
Senior Kate Carpenter, who studies political communication, said she has started attending CorePower Yoga’s Georgetown, Dupont Circle and Adams Morgan locations since Lerner’s closure while receiving a 10 percent student discount and an additional 50 percent off for helping clean yoga mats and other equipment after her classes. CorePower Yoga charges $15 if members cancel their class reservation after the deadline, a charge Carpenter said has been a burdensome expense.
Carpenter said she likes to keep in mind that future GW classes will benefit from the renovations officials are working on in Lerner.
“I think to the future, and I’d rather the students in the future be able to experience a one-of-a-kind gym, and so that means we have to miss out for four months,” Carpenter said. “But the costs that I’ve endured are very hefty, and do weigh on me.”
Carpenter said Lerner’s closure inspired her to start an intramural pickleball league where she meets daily to play with friends at the Federal Reserve tennis court near campus and organizes monthly tournaments.
“I do feel like there are definitely ways to stay active,” Carpenter said. “I don’t know if they’re super cost efficient. I have not found one that is, unless I’m running outside in 98 degrees.”
