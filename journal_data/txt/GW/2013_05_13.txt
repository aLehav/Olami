The University will add about 30 percent more language courses for non-native English speakers this fall, as administrators predict even greater international student growth.
GW has steadily added the for-credit courses in the English for Academic Purposes program, which are mandatory for foreign students lacking English skills, as it amps up its recruiting of international students. For instance, the number of Chinese students has increased fourfold in the last five years.
The University will offer a total of 44 sections, most of which are geared toward the graduate student population, which swelled by a quarter last year. The University also will offer more English skills classes in the summer to better acclimate students to GW and the U.S.
The wider language offerings come as the University is expecting a larger international student population in the Class of 2017. While the number of students enrolling in GW next year is not yet finalized, Senior Vice Provost for Academic Affairs and Planning Forrest Maltzman said he believed the number of international students would again outpace last year’s.
“Last year we had about, a little bit under 10 percent, and I would expect us to have a little bit over this year,” he said Thursday.
The University will also offer three types of English for Academic Purposes classes for undergraduates this fall, compared to the one offering last year. The number of foreign undergraduates increased by 16 percent last year.
Megan Siczek, an English for Academic Purposes professor, said the program expects more graduate students to take the summer courses than undergraduates, especially those graduate students admitted to the School of Engineering and Applied Science and the GW School of Business.
The Writing Center has needed to adjust to the rising number of appointments made by international students. The office’s director, Christine Zink, said that foreign students comprised 47 percent of appointments last fall, adding that the data for the entire school year was not yet available.
“We’ve found this year, as we’ve paid close attention to our international student population, that tutors are often working with those students to help them understand the mindset and conventions of academic writing in the American university, so those conversations about the assignment itself and its expectations are an important part of our work,” she said.
The University is looking to ultimately fill 15 percent of its undergraduate population from abroad – a goal outlined in its decade-long strategic plan. Typically, international students pay the full sticker price, which benefits the tuition-dependent GW as it attempts to make its mark as a global institution.
The English for Academic Purposes program was once an obscure part of the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences, but Dean Peg Barratt said the department was forced to bulk up as the number of international students increased.
“We’ve been doing this for a long time. We’re not seriously changing the nature of the class. It really does help students a lot and we’re going to keep doing it,” she said.
Barratt said most international students that come to the University have adequate reading and listening skills, but need additional help with their speaking and writing skills.
The outgoing dean added that graduate students would cease to take placement exams this year, but would instead be placed in classes based off of English exam scores required for admission to the University. She said the change would save time for the students and department.
Siczek said earlier this year that the program should be able to handle the increased students, but, “in general, we would benefit from more staffing and more space.”
Charles Mueller, an assistant professor of English for academic purposes, added that the program still needed more technology-equipped classrooms and tutors for one-on-one support. Barratt said the college would continue to evaluate the program’s needs accordingly.

I’m writing in response to the article “Student’s mother suing professor, University for $150,000” (May 2, online).
The conduct of the woman suing assistant philosophy professor Eric Saidel, the philosophy department, the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences and the University is akin to a man using a cigarette lighter to peer inside his mobile home’s gasoline tank to make sure it’s full.
Several of the mother’s claims in the lawsuit can be conservatively called “curious.” For example, she stated that Saidel created an “environment of deception” for her daughter, yet the mother still recommended her a logic tutor. Furthermore, it is evident that the daughter was not “performing really well” because her performance necessitated the assistance of a tutor. It seems clear that one would only be recommended a tutor if academic performance was subpar.
The grade, however, was very troubling for the student and the mother because it was not “consistent with her academic ability,” which is a clever twist of language. This merely indicates that, from the mother’s perspective, her daughter had the ability to get an A, not that the student’s grade in the course should have been an A.
But I think it is fair to say that this is when the case starts to fall apart.
It does not make sense that the student waited two years to sue Saidel after he committed acts of “loss, detriment, injury and torture” against her. She should not have acted slothfully in bringing him to justice if his offenses were so egregious.

The Atlantic 10 will welcome Davidson – a consistent March Madness contender – to the conference for 2014-2015, the league announced May 8.
Davidson’s signing is the second by the A-10 this off-season, after regional rival George Mason agreed to join the A-10 in March for next season. The addition is a big get for a conference that recently lost powerhouses Xavier and Butler to the new Big East, Charlotte to Conference USA, and Temple to the American Athletic Conference.
“Once again the Atlantic 10 has shown its commitment to being a premier conference, and in the always-changing landscape of conference realignment, the conference has proven to be proactive in adding quality universities that will augment our reputation and keep us thriving,” GW’s athletic director Patrick Nero said in a release Wednesday.
The deal not only makes up for one of the vacant slots, but could also entice other potential A-10 fleers like Saint Louis, Dayton, Richmond and VCU to stay in the basketball-heavy conference that is trying to gain prominence as realignment shakes up the college sports world.
Davidson, located in southern North Carolina, previously turned down an opportunity last year to leave the Southern Conference for the CAA, George Mason’s former conference. The Wildcats have played in the Southern Conference for eight decades, and is one of its oldest members.
Last season, Davidson finished with a 26-8 record overall, and a 17-1 record in conference. The team came up just a last-second layup short from defeating No.3 seed Marquette in the first round of the NCAA tournament. Since 2002, the team has gone to the NCAA tournament five times.

As graduates from the Class of 2013 jump into the slowly rebounding economy, they may wind up back at GW.
The University boasts that 1,400 employees, or 6 percent of its workforce, hold GW degrees – far higher than schools like the University of Georgia, which counts .1 percent of its employees as alums. Recent graduates say part of the draw in working at their alma mater is the facilitated path to a second degree. Employees can take graduate classes at a 96 percent discounted rate – higher than nearly every other university in the country.
For 2010 graduate Jason Lifton, the offer was one he couldn’t refuse. Faced with a rough economic outlook, Lifton was hired to work at the Student and Academic Support Services office by its former head Robert Chernak. He began working toward his MBA at the GW School of Business soon after, and said, “There was no better place for me.”
He said there are a mix of recent alumni who work at GW: some who want to give back to their schools, and others who keep their work-study jobs long-term or take on new positions.
“The strongest incentive to me was just having the ability to give back to a place that has given me so much,” Lifton said. But he added that once he finishes his master’s degree, he is “not really sure” if he will stay at the University.
Lifton will ultimately save about $75,000 out of the about $78,000 tuition it would typically take to earn a GW business degree. The payday far exceeds those offered by other schools like Northwestern and Vanderbilt universities, which give a 75 and 70 percent tuition cut, respectively, to staff. The University of Chicago and Washington University in St. Louis both give a 50 percent break.
GW employees looking to take classes can also work for a shorter period of time before seeing that discount – about 90 days. Other schools, such as Washington University in St. Louis, require at least a year as an employee before the discount applies.

Ten years ago, New York Avenue didn’t have a Metro stop. One of Columbia Heights’ main shopping complexes was an empty lot. The boardwalk along the Anacostia River in Navy Yard was still just a dirt trail.
In the last decade, a booming job market has caused thousands of recent college graduates to flock to the District, and, in GW’s case, to stay here.
The percentage of 25-to-34-year-olds in the D.C. area skyrocketed by more than one-fifth between 2006 and 2011. That growth helped D.C. rank as the 15th largest job market in the nation, and has spurred the development of more apartments, restaurants and shops that cater to a younger crowd.
The outer corners of the city are in transition, and GW graduates have long helped fuel those changes, finding cheap apartments in Columbia Heights or settling into the quieter northern Virginia area. More recently, new graduates are also heading into up-and-coming neighborhoods such as Navy Yard and H Street Northeast, which mix daytime accessibility with an exciting nightlife.
Columbia Heights
Less than 10 years ago, Columbia Heights was just starting to move big-name stores like Giant into its storefronts. Fences surrounding empty lots were covered in graffiti. Most buildings were just one story, and the shops were quiet.
Now, the lineup around 12th and Irving streets includes Target, Bed Bath & Beyond, Five Guys, IHOP and Chipotle, all within a block of the Metro stop.
The neighborhood has a vibrant Hispanic culture and offers popular bars, restaurants and shops. Performances and art vendors are common on street corners.
The overall population in Columbia Heights has remained mostly steady in the last 30 years, though the number of children fell by 8 percent over that time, indicating the young professionals are flocking there.
Kristen Peck, 25, a Catholic University alumna living in Brookland, said she often comes to Columbia Heights to shop and the area is becoming more popular among young people.
“I really like this area because they have a lot of new things, like the restaurants that they have down on, like, 11th Street,” she said.
Arlington
Arlington, Va., which boasts the highest concentration of 25-to-34-year-olds in the D.C. region, is also heating up as a destination for recent college graduates. Almost 70 percent of Arlington residents hold bachelor’s degrees, according to Arlington Economic Development.
One of the fastest growing areas of the city is the Rosslyn-Ballston corridor, which has seen a 30 percent population spike in the last decade.
Aria Varasteh, a 2012 alumnus, moved to Rosslyn after graduation, where he said rent prices were “leaps and bounds cheaper” than options in Foggy Bottom.
“It’s important that close to home has nightlife,” Varasteh said, adding that easy access to happy hours is always a plus.
While Virginia’s quiet, residential life turns away some graduates who prefer not to rely on the Metro for late night bar-hopping, it can be easier to avoid high housing prices. One well-tended apartment complex there – the Gates of Ballston – offers a studio apartment with an outdoor patio for $1,080 a month, plus in-room laundry.
Arlington locals are also proud of the neighborhood restaurants, such as Rock Bottom Restaurant & Brewery, which draws in recent college graduates on Wednesdays with $1.50 drafts available until 9 p.m.
H Street  Northeast
Probably best known to GW undergraduates for its bar scene, the H Street Northeast neighborhood has undergone an arts revival in the last few years.
A local theater company finished renovating the decades-old Atlas Theater in 2006, and the space now serves as an anchor in the arts-focused neighborhood.
The restaurants here cater to a hip crowd, offering everything from happy hours and live music to coffee shop hangouts and ramen bars. It is also home to the popular concert venue Rock & Roll Hotel, and has made a name for itself the around the city with its playful and colorful H Street Festival.
The neighborhood, which is about a mile and a half long, has also added a local farmers’ market near the Union Station metro, and will implement a streetcar system in late 2013.
“I think it’s a lot places that were once, you know, perceived as kind of sketchy, are becoming less sketchy because a lot of younger people are moving in there,” Peck, the teacher from Brookland, said.
Mount Vernon Square
Mount Vernon Square has shed its “bad neighborhood” reputation in recent years, as a new convention center, condominiums and grocery stores have boosted its image. The neighborhood is the eighth most walkable for daily errands in D.C., according to walkscore.com.
The area also houses the Kennedy Recreation Center with basketball courts, a baseball field and a tennis court.
The neighborhood mostly caters to business professionals, but nearby Chinatown offers access to hotspots like the National Portrait Gallery, the Verizon Center and entertainment food venue Busboys and Poets.
About 6,000 people call the Mount Vernon Square neighborhood home, and about half that number are single. The average monthly rent stands at about $1,100.
Amid the rush of activity in and around Mount Vernon Place, the massive Washington Convention Center towers above apartment buildings, churches and schools. Young professionals can grab a bite to eat at local restaurants that cater to the after-work crowd, then head home to brightly-colored residential neighborhoods.
Navy Yard
Navy Yard has been both a historic shipbuilding site – with its glory days mostly between U.S. independence and the War of 1812 – and a valued weapons supplier during America’s worst overseas crises.
After shutting down many operations in the 1960s, the Navy moved one of its largest systems commands centers back on site in 2001, sparking revitalization of the area.
It now features a boardwalk along the Anacostia River, which provides a view of hundreds of docked boats along the pier. Yards Park is also nearby, not to mention the baseball stadium home to the Nationals.
A key draw is the average $909 monthly rent, beating out most other neighborhoods for affordable living.

What is typically the stuff of sci-fi fantasies will soon come to life for one senior.
Brandon Minor, a University Honors Program student who is double-majoring in physics and computer science, will enter the School of Engineering and Applied Science in the fall to pursue a Ph.D. in robotics. He works on robotic movement, which focuses on building machines that are aware of their surroundings and react accordingly.
The program can take anywhere from four to seven years, Minor said, meaning the senior could earn his doctorate by age 25.
As an independent research student with the department, Minor worked on autonomous movement of vehicles and became fascinated with the subject, ultimately deciding to pursue a degree within the GW program.
While the program is intensive and exclusive, housing only seven Ph.D. students, Minor emphasized the applicability of the degree in professions ranging from banking to government.
“It’s not just about getting a salary, you work on things that are valuable,” Minor said. “In banking, they use the same statistical analysis I use in robotics. Pretty much, name me a field and I could name you some skill that I could utilize [from robotics].”
In considering his future plans, he noted an interest in potentially bringing his work to California’s burgeoning tech industry.
“The definition of a Ph.D. is breaking the barrier of science – doing things that no one has done – which is all I want to do with my life,” Minor said. “If getting a job meant not making an original contribution to the world, then I’d much rather get a Ph.D.”

It only took until Colonial Inauguration for Kayley Sullivan to make her first college decision that would scare her parents: changing her major from business to psychology.
“I had some resistance from my parents, because there’s a tone when you say you’re majoring in psychology: ‘Oh, what are you going to do with it?’ But I had the attitude of, ‘Oh, I’ll figure that out,’ ” Sullivan said.
Now a graduating senior with that same major, with a concentration in cognitive neuroscience and a minor in mind and brain studies, Sullivan’s figured it out  by landing a job in education.
KIPP, short for “Knowledge is Power Program,” is a group of public charter schools that started in New York City and serves low-income communities across the country.
Sullivan, an Alexandria, Va. native, said she had never considered teaching at a traditional elementary school, but thought the KIPP schools offered a unique opportunity for her to make a difference.
“I found the reason KIPP is the dream company for me: working on an issue that’s working on closing the education gap in D.C. And when you look at trying to change the world, you can start with the problems in your own backyard,” she said.
Sullivan said most of her time at GW was consumed by athletics, as she was captain of the women’s soccer team this year. She also spent time tutoring for the District Youth Empowerment program at Maury Elementary and at Francis-Stevens Elementary through the College for Every Student program.
Sullivan also “tried her hand at research” with the American Psychological Association at George Mason University on a child development study, but found the scope of public impact too limiting.
After she lost out on a Fulbright fellowship to teach English in Ecuador, Sullivan was recommended to the KIPP program by a friend, and said she thinks this will be a better fit.
“KIPP’s whole theme is ‘Work hard, be nice,’ and the athlete in me loves that, because I don’t see any other way than giving yourself 100 percent of what you’re doing,” Sullivan said.u

FRIDAY
11 a.m. – District History
Dumbarton House
2715 Q St. NW
$5 for adults, free for college students with school I.D. and children
The Dumbarton House is a time capsule of the post-Revolutionary period, and a veritable architectural museum itself. The former home of Joseph Nourse, the nation’s first Register of the Treasury, the Dumbarton House and museum features over 1,000 Federal period pieces, including traditional furniture, paintings and early documents of the Nourse family history. Even cooler? The building was a sanctuary for former First Lady Dolley Madison when British troops stampeded the District in the War of 1812.
1 p.m. – Local Lunch
Cafe Tu-o-Tu
3421 M St. NW
Grab lunch at a local haunt. Located right before the shops in Georgetown, this cozy cafe offers modern Mediterranean cuisine on the cheap. It specializes in wraps and paninis, but features a substantial breakfast menu, a breadth of coffees and tea and specialized desserts like homemade baklava.

3 p.m. – Art in the City
Renwick Gallery
1661 Pennsylvania Ave. NW
Free
Steps from the White House, the Renwick Gallery is an artistic splendor. Although the gallery didn’t open until 1972, the building itself was completed in 1859, and features both contemporary and 19th century craftwork from national artists.

8 p.m. – DuPont Dessert
Yocake
1829 M St. NW
Capitalizing on both frozen yogurt and cupcakes, Yocake may have the monopoly on the trendiest of desserts. Its expansive menu of both traditional and eclectic cupcake flavors – mimosa and maple raisin cupcakes, anyone? – is enticing enough, but the dessert shop’s signature item is its Yocake, a cupcake encased in frozen yogurt and fruit on top. Patrons can pick from more conventional combinations like strawberry and cheesecake or create their own concoction, enjoying two dessert staples in one.
