Commissioners discussed how residents should address off-campus parties when they arise.
A local governing body solidified plans to create three committees involving commissioners and constituents during a monthly meeting Wednesday.
The Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission voted unanimously to create three committees that will tackle business and development, transportation and infrastructure and strategic planning and coordination. Jeri Epstein, the chair of the commission, said the committees will feature commissioners, “business members,” members of the University community and other local residents who can weigh in on neighborhood governance.
Here are some the meeting’s highlights:
Approving committees
Epstein said she will chair the transportation and infrastructure committee alongside alumnus James Harnett, who chaired the ANC until his term expired last month. She said Commissioner Joel Causey will chair the business and development committee, while commissioners Donna Barbisch and Adam Friend will co-chair the strategic planning and coordination committee.
Commissioners had previously mentioned plans to create a neighborhood life committee chaired by commissioners Trupti Patel and Yannik Omictin, but the ANC didn’t include any such committee in a vote. Commissioners said they will consider adding additional committees and specify basic function and requirements once they finish updating its website.
Epstein said the committees will create a “forum” where locals can have a say in matters brought before the commission and carve out the time to discuss local issues, like business development.
“What I’d like to see is community involvement and community engagement, and that was the whole point,” she said. “Some of us will be here for two years. Some may be here for four years. A lot of these people have lived here for 50 years. I want to make sure they have a voice in everything we do, and the way we let them have a voice is to encourage them to be part of a committee.”
Epstein said she’s held “a couple of good meetings” with the transportation and infrastructure committee so far where members discussed roads, sidewalk repairs and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. She said the first business and development meeting last week featured more than 20 residents from the Columbia Plaza Apartments who discussed plans for the facility’s development.
Investigating COVID-19 parties
Metropolitan Police Department Lieutenant Ledet Williams said MPD officers assigned “enhanced patrols” around an ANC district covering the northern and western ends of campus. She said she’s working with GW Police Department officers on a complaint about “students partying in a residential building” where security has struggled to handle the situation.
Williams said she’s heard of individuals in the neighborhood holding large gatherings and throwing up, noting how the recent off-campus complaint, which came via text, involved a “party bus” that officers had to escort away. She said residents should dial 911 as opposed to the District’s 311 non-emergency hotline so officers can track the incident and confront the issue in person.
“We can get officers out there, boots on the ground, visually see what’s going on and address the issue when it’s happening – not an hour later when we get a text tip that finally comes in if someone does their job,” Williams said. “The 911 system is, I think, more robust in having our response show up in a timely manner.”
Residents and students voiced their concerns about a trend of off-campus parties that percolated off campus, despite COVID-19 guidelines last semester.
Continuing 2100 Penn construction
The ANC unanimously approved an extension of an after-hours permit for Boston Properties, a real estate company spearheading the construction project at 2100 Pennsylvania Ave. The permit will be effective from March through the end of July and allow the company to continue construction later into the night from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. – with “noisy work” stopping at midnight – and earlier into the morning from 6 a.m. to 7 a.m. with a restriction against vehicle motion alarms.
The ANC also authorized after-hours construction on Sundays from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Emancipation Day, tabbed for April 16, from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Sean Sullivan, the vice president for development at Boston Properties, said inspection delays at 2100 Penn has set construction work at the site behind schedule during the pandemic. He added that construction stoppage amid security measures ahead of the presidential inauguration, and pauses during recent snowfall have prolonged work.
Sullivan said the new permit is an extension of Boston Properties’ previous after-hours permit that was initiated in December and is set to expire at the end of February. The company has relied on after-hours work in hopes of accelerating the project while fewer students live on campus this academic year.
“The goal here – overarching goal – is to get as much of this work done as possible and to catch up on as much time as we can before the students can arrive back on campus, which we anticipate they will be back and in more full force this fall, and then just generally, the workforce should be coming back and the neighborhood will be more populated this fall.”

GW is now offering self-administered COVID-19 tests for asymptomatic students.
Officials said in a release earlier this month that the new testing method will use “pooling” to test multiple samples at once and is intended to provide more support for students as the University seeks to reopen as much as possible in the fall. Students and experts in COVID-19 testing and higher education said self-testing could be slightly less accurate than health care provider tests, but the option could help more students get tested frequently.
“As our understanding of best practices around COVID-19 has evolved, we’ve been slowly but surely adding to our on-campus cohort – this semester we added approximately another 1,000 residential students, and at the same time we’ve added additional in-person classes and increased our on-campus research,” Scott Burnotes, the vice president for safety and facilities, said in the release earlier this month. “So we’re putting the tools in place to support a continued increase.”
Asymptomatic students are being tested at the Virginia Science and Technology Campus test center and the Marvin Center, and symptomatic testing is happening at Shenkman Hall, according to the release.
Charlie Wild, a freshman living in Potomac House, said the entire self-testing process takes less than “three or four minutes,” which he said is the same amount of time as the staff-administered tests.
He said students must make an appointment to get tested through their Colonial Health Center portal, which provides them with a barcode that is scanned when they arrive at the testing center. They are then asked to provide their birthday, which is written on their respective test tube along with their name, he said.
“Basically, you then uncap the tube, you pull out the swab, break it in half and you spin it around in a circle eight times in each nostril,” he said. “And then you put it in return to the swab, to the tube and basically put it in a little biohazard bag and then put it in the box and then you leave.”
Omer Reshid, a freshman living in District House, said he would feel more comfortable with health care providers administering the tests because he doesn’t feel confident that he performs the test correctly on himself.
“They show you what to do a little bit, but there’s no supervision,” he said. “So as a student, you don’t really care as much so you just swab a little bit and go about your day.”
Self-administered tests use nasal swabs or saliva to collect a sample, but they are processed in a lab in the same way as health care provided tests, which public health experts said offers efficient results.
He added that having more testing centers available to students instead of conducting testing in the same area could free up appointment slots and make students feel more protected from COVID-19 as they get their test.
“If they had more testing centers, instead of just one big hall, it would be a lot less crammed and you can make a lot more appointments because the appointments fill up really quick and the hall usually is packed with people,” Reshid said.
Freshman Georgia Turpin, who lives in District House, said the self-test process is more efficient than the clinician-administered tests used in the fall semester.
“The testing process during the fall semester lasted longer given students had to wait for the COVID staff to change gloves, handle the collection and clean the testing space,” she said. “Now the staff has to monitor students during the collection process and clean the areas after, so it’s more effective in regard to time.”
Experts in COVID-19 testing said self-administered tests that are processed using a pool system are typically efficient for testing a large population because they provide results quickly.
Guy Nicolette, the assistant vice chancellor of university health sciences at University of California, Berkeley, said his institution has been using self-administered tests that are analyzed using a pool system, which gathers a group of test samples to compare at once. He said a sample doesn’t need to be re-tested as long as a pool does not detect any presence of the virus.
“Pooled samples increase lab capacity dramatically and can decrease turnaround time in most cases,” Nicolette said in an email. “In a setting of low pretest probability, most samples do not need retest as most pooled samples will be negative. The higher the local rate, the more samples will need separation and retest.”
Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the John Hopkins Center for Health Security, said false negative results depend on whether officials use a polymerase chain reaction test, a lab technique GW uses to detect the virus’s genetic material, or an antigen test, which searches for the virus’s proteins present in the body.
He said PCR tests tend to produce more false positives because it detects minimal amounts of debris while antigen tests tend to produce false negatives, wrongly indicating a patient is not contagious.
“It’s more about the frequency and the ease of testing and what level of capture you get and what you do with that test result,” he said. “If your test result can be linked to actions of isolation, quarantine, contact tracing, that’s the key.”

Located a block from the White House, MXDC serves an open-faced quesadilla featuring three types of cheese.
Level up your Tex-Mex takeout by heading to MXDC Cocina Mexicana.
MXDC, located a block from the White House at 600 14th St. NW, serves up fresh Mexican cuisine including tacos, burritos and quesadillas. The contemporary yet rustic style restaurant is currently open at 25 percent capacity, but it also fulfills takeout and delivery orders, which I opted for in the interest of convenience and safety.
The restaurant serves lunch and dinner from noon to 8 p.m. Tuesday through Friday. Its menu offers several small plates like shrimp ceviche ($14), salads and entrees with an extensive drink menu for patrons over 21.
For starters, or if you don’t have a big appetite, try out one of its soups and salads like the soup of the day ($14) or the Jicama salad with red chile orange vinaigrette ($10).
If you go for dinner, you could order a plate of three tacos ($14), like the Mahi Mahi tacos or tacos with huitlacoche, wild mushroom and truffled corn salsa. Other dishes include salmon ($12), shrimp ceviches ($14), queso fundido with tortillas ($14) and sides of lemongrass rice ($5), black beans ($5) and smoked chiles ($6).
Its lunch menu includes burritos (about $14) and bowls served with your choice of meat, lettuce, pico de gallo, beans and rice, avocado, crema in addition to a choice of fries or mixed greens. Or, like I did, you could opt for one of three different quesadillas (14) topped with arugula and cotija cheese.
The Huitlacoche Quesadilla grabbed my attention for its combination of truffles and cheese. Unlike a traditional quesadilla, this one was open-faced and made on a crispy corn tortilla. The top of the tortilla was coated with corn, roasted mushrooms and topped with crisp arugula for garnish. The quesadilla featured three types of cheese – mozzarella, mild and salty chihuahua and salty cotija crumbled on top of the arugula.
To complete this vegetarian and gluten-free dish, a bag of tortilla chips and two green tomatillo salsas were served on the side. The quesadilla cost $14, but with delivery fees it came to about $20.
The quesadilla was delivered in a flat cardboard box and was divided into six slices. I initially assumed I would not be hungry enough to finish the whole quesadilla, but each slice tasted so fresh I didn’t want to have it as leftovers.
While the cheese, corn and mushrooms delivered the main, umami flavor, the quesadilla was drizzled in an epazote-black truffle chimichurri sauce that elevated the dish with garlic and vinegar tinges. There was a substantial amount of arugula, chimichurri and crumbled cotija, but none of the toppings were overpowering.
As a fan of extreme spice, I missed the heat that Mexican food usually delivers. The quesadilla was fairly mild. Next time, I might try the tacos with chipotle aioli or the queso fundido with poblanos and chorizo for a stronger punch of heat.
While I’m not old enough to order an alcoholic drink, MXDC sells cocktails, beer and wine. Its list of to-go margaritas looked especially tempting. The house margarita can be purchased in a quart ($40) or half quart ($20) and flavor can be added for $5 and $3 respectively.
For your next takeout night, try out MXDC Cocina Mexicana for distinctive twists on classic Mexican recipes.

This letter to the editor was written by staff representatives from the Office of Advocacy and Support; the Office of Diversity, Equity and Community Engagement; the Office of Student Life; the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities; and the Title IX Office.
In the recent opinions piece, “Ethics violations should be grounds for student organizations to remove members,” the author correctly stated that the Code of Student Conduct prohibits student organizations from taking “adjudicatory or sanctioning action” for behavior that could also violate University policy without written approval from the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities. 
As representatives from offices across the University, we write today to offer student organizations some information and resources, as well as concrete steps organizations can take now to bolster their ability to respond to members that fail to meet organizational expectations. 
The University takes seriously all reports of policy violations, including sexual harassment, and we encourage individuals to report policy violations they experience. Whether reported to the Bias Incident Response Team, the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities, the Title IX Office or another office at the University, our processes are intentionally designed to provide support, rights and procedural options to all parties involved so that all members of our community can fully access their educational experiences. This policy prohibiting student organizations from adjudicating potential Code of Conduct violations has the care of students front of mind. Investigating, hearing and determining appropriate action on issues related to your peers can be incredibly taxing and challenging, and this is not a burden that any student or organization should take on independently. The University offices that support students through these situations are trained to handle reports with discretion, care and respect for the privacy and wellness of all involved. 
If a member of your organization has experienced discriminatory behavior, a bias incident or sexual harassment – whether by another member of your organization or otherwise – please encourage them to consult one or more of the following resources.  
To report an incident to the University and to seek supportive measures, please consult one of the following resources:
Student Rights and Responsibilities: Students can report potential policy violations to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities. Additionally, SRR can provide support with conflict management and support resources. 
Bias Incident Report: Students who have been the target of, or who witness, a bias incident may use this online form to make the University aware of these incidents. In addition, bias incidents may be reported through other reporting options outlined on the How To Report a Bias-Related Incident page.
Title IX: The Title IX Office responds to reports of sexual harassment, sexual assault, stalking, and dating and domestic violence. The office provides supportive measures to individuals affected by these issues and offers prevention education University-wide to promote an inclusive educational atmosphere free from discrimination, harassment and violence. Community members are entitled to support from the University regardless of whether they choose to file a formal complaint or pursue a formal resolution of their case. The Title IX Office is the University’s exclusive resource to formally resolve these reports. In addition to formal investigations, the Title IX Office offers a voluntary alternative resolution framework that incorporates restorative justice principles. The Title IX Office can be reached at titleix@gwu.edu or at 202-994-7434.
SARC: The Sexual Assault Response & Consultation team is a resource for any GW community member affected by sexual harassment, sexual assault, stalking, and dating and domestic violence. SARC is available 24/7 by phone at 202-994-7222.
To seek supportive measures, please consult one of the following resources:
Counseling and Psychological Services: The University’s Counseling and Psychological Services Office can offer resources as well as counseling support. CAPS is available 24/7 by phone at 202-994-5300. 
Office of Advocacy and Support:  The Office of Advocacy and Support is committed to ending power-based oppression and violence through prevention programming and reducing its impact by offering confidential support to any GW community member affected by trauma, harm or violence. OAS can be reached at oas@gwu.edu or at 202-994-0443.
Should your organization become aware of alleged member behavior that violates University policy, you are encouraged to reach out to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities to discuss the most appropriate path forward.
Student organizations are permitted to remove members for behavior that would not be a violation of University policy, and organizational advisers or SRR leaders can help student leaders determine whether or not University policy applies to a specific case. To promote clear expectations and accountability among members, student organizations should define their organizational standards and member requirements and incorporate written reactive measures in their formal membership documents. Your organization’s staff adviser or Org Help are resources to support your organization through the drafting of such standards and written removal processes. 
Student organizations are the heart of our campus, and it is only right that the leaders of this community hold each other to high standards of behavior and offer mutual respect for one another. The processes and policies that are in place ensure accountability while promoting an inclusive, safe and productive culture among our diverse community of student organizations.

The Student Association’s Graduate Senators Caucus released a statement Tuesday criticizing officials’ decision not to grant graduate students a tuition reduction during virtual instruction.
After graduate students were not included in a 10 percent tuition reduction provided for undergraduate students for the academic year, the caucus submitted a tuition report, documenting graduate students’ experiences related to the cost of virtual instruction, to University President Thomas LeBlanc and Provost Brian Blake in December. SA Sen. Sebastian Weinmann, Law-G and the chair of the Graduate Senators Caucus, said not treating graduate students the same as undergraduates “is nothing new.”
“I have seen and experienced first-hand how the University prioritizes the needs and concerns of undergraduate students over graduate students, despite the fact that GW is a majority-graduate institution,” Weinmann said in an email.
He said the letter demands officials commit to a 10 percent tuition reduction for graduate students and provide an “actual” explanation for why graduate students did not receive a tuition reduction for the fall and spring semesters.
The tuition report found that more than 80 percent of graduate students do not believe officials are supporting them as they are undergraduates during the COVID-19 pandemic. The report also states 50 percent of graduate students were unable to find a source of income and more than 60 percent are “not likely” to recommend their graduate program to a potential student because of the lack of a tuition reduction.
Officials announced before the fall semester that graduate students’ tuition would not be increased for the academic year rather than a reduction similar to that for undergraduate students. Graduate students sent a petition, which gained more than 700 signatures, to officials in late July and launched an email campaign to Board of Trustees Chair Grace Speights but did not receive a response, according to the statement.
Weinman said he believes officials do not treat graduate and undergraduate students the same way because administrators think graduate students “will not fight back” and actions from graduate students will not result in any “consequences” for the University.
“I hope the GSC has made them realize that is not true,” Weinmann said.
Graduate students were also able to request funding from the University’s CARES Fund – money allocated to support students facing financial difficulties amid the pandemic.
Blake and other top academic leaders released a letter in late January in response to the tuition report, stating officials chose not to increase graduate school tuition in light of the pandemic. The letter states all schools “strived” to provide graduate students a “fulfilling student experience and a high-quality education” during virtual learning.
Officials kept graduate tuition at the 2019-20 rate for “most programs” but do not currently have plans to further reduce graduate student tuition, the letter states.
“We will remain mindful and understanding about the ongoing pressures that our graduate students face in the pandemic,” the letter states.
The letter added that graduate students have access to the Academic Commons and Counseling and Psychological Services and the Office of Graduate Student Assistantships and Fellowships to find opportunities for school and department funding.
Blake did not immediately return a request for comment through a spokesperson.

Officials plan to tear down the Nashman Center for Civic Engagement and Public Service building later this year and move its offices to the new GW Hillel building soon to open on H Street.
Amy Cohen, the executive director of the Nashman Center, announced the University’s plans last week to replace the area surrounding the Nashman Center with green space “to create an enlarged outdoor space for community use.” Cohen said officials with the Division of Safety and Facilities will “coordinate the details of the move” of the Nashman Center’s offices into the third and fourth floors of the Hillel building before the end of June.
“We are excited to move this bright and welcoming space,” Cohen said in an email to local residents. “The building will serve as a gateway to campus, improving the Center’s ability to fulfill our mission as a crossroads for community-university partnerships. In addition, Hillel’s strong commitment to service and racial equity dovetails with the work of the Nashman Center, and we look forward to expanding our work together on these issues.”
Cohen said officials previously approved development at the site of the Nashman Center as part of the 2007 Foggy Bottom Campus Plan. The District accepted the University’s application for a raze permit late last month, authorizing the building’s demolition.
Senior Yannik Omictin, a member of the Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission, said the ANC could approve the Nashman Center raze within three months.
While he’s “saddened” by news of the building’s destruction, Omictin said the new green space would help clear the corridor and create more sidewalk space.
“That whole block now with Rome, Phillips is destined for redevelopment at some point,” he said. “The building is much older. It doesn’t fit the style of GW. There are several plans ongoing right now to envision what a different building could look like on that site.”
ANC commissioner Adam Friend said he and other commissioners hope to learn more about the project as it progresses toward completion.
“From my perspective, I am optimistic that the space at 837 22nd Street can become a vibrant part of the campus and the neighborhood with the proper plan,” he said. “We on the ANC look forward to working with the community and GWU on guiding its improvement.”
This post has been updated to correct the following:
A previous version of this post stated the District has approved the University’s raze permit. The permit has been accepted but is still in the approval process.

The squad has missed eight straight games as a result of the pause.
After a five-week hiatus from competition, men’s basketball will return to the court Sunday to take on Rhode Island, according to a release and tweet Tuesday.
The Colonials (3-9, 2-3 A-10) have not played a game since Jan. 17 after head coach Jamion Christian tested positive for COVID-19 and the team went into quarantine Jan. 19. The squad has had to postpone eight straight Atlantic 10 games as a result of the pause, and the team has delayed 10 total conference games this season.
The squad slotted in a game against Rhode Island to replace a home matchup against St. Bonaventure that will no longer be played, the release states.
The squad’s first postponed game – a Jan. 6 home contest against Massachusetts – was put off after Mayor Muriel Bowser instated a District-wide curfew following an insurrection at the Capitol.
GW’s next game – a Jan. 9 road trip to St. Bonaventure – was delayed after a staff member in the Colonials’ traveling party tested positive for the virus. But after conducting additional testing and contact tracing, the team returned the practice the next night.
As a result of the team’s current COVID-19 protocol, the Colonials postponed games at Dayton Jan. 20, Rhode Island Jan. 24, George Mason Jan. 27, Fordham Jan. 30, Saint Louis Feb. 6, Richmond Feb. 9 and La Salle Feb. 13.
Most recently, GW’s matchup with Saint Joseph’s, slated for Wednesday, was postponed as both teams continued their return to play protocol, a release states. The Hawks also experienced virus-related issues too, postponing four games in a two-week period.
Currently, the Colonials have played just five games in A-10 play, which is the lowest number in the 14-team league.
The team will take the court for the first time in 35 days when it hosts Rhode Island Sunday. The long-awaited tipoff is slated for 11:30 a.m.

Hill said the JEC opinion divides CCAS students instead of “empowering an underrepresented” population in SMPA and Corcoran.
Updated: Feb. 19, 2021 at 1:08 p.m.
SA President Brandon Hill filed a complaint with the Student Court Tuesday, seeking to increase voting rights for some students in the upcoming SA elections.
Hill filed the complaint against an advisory opinion from the Joint Elections Commission – the body that oversees SA elections – stating all Columbian College of Arts and Sciences students will be allowed to vote for the CCAS senate race but cannot vote for the School of Media and Public Affairs or Corcoran School of the Arts and Design races if a voter is not a member of one of those schools. Hill said he wants to extend voting rights for all of those races to all CCAS students regardless of if they are in SMPA or Corcoran.
He said he served on the constitutional committee task force – a group charged with voting on changes to the SA’s constitution – and was a “strong advocate” for allocating seats to CCAS, SMPA, Corcoran and the Trachtenberg School of Public Policy and Public Administration. He said the senate seats aim to “elevate” the voices of students in schools who “often don’t get heard.”
The advisory opinion allows SMPA and Corcoran students to vote for a CCAS candidate and a candidate from their respective school.
Hill said the JEC opinion divides CCAS students instead of “empowering an underrepresented” population in SMPA and Corcoran.
“It is my hope that all students will be able to vote on all the seats allocated to them,” he said. “I hope the court swiftly overturns the advisory opinion and guarantees this right for all students.”
Chloe Wagner, the chairperson of the JEC, said the body made “careful” decisions when approving the advisory opinion to take into account the guidelines of the updated SA constitution, 2021 JEC bylaws and the “interests” of students. She said the updated constitution includes “limited” guidance about the allocation of CCAS undergraduate and graduate seats, so the opinion was necessary for the body to prepare the upcoming election.
“We believe this advisory opinion effectively balances the importance of student representation in the SA with the language in the new constitution as written by the SA Senate and approved by the student body last year,” Wagner said. “We look forward to hearing the Student Court’s decision in this matter and to a productive election season.”
Riham Yousif, the student court registrar, confirmed the court had received Hill’s complaint.
The court issued an order Thursday stating the judges will meet on Sunday to give “initial consideration” to the complaint. The order states the JEC is temporarily suspended from accepting registrations from candidates for senate seats for “any division” of CCAS until February 26, unless the court “extends, modifies or cancels” the decision.
The order states the two sides, Hill and the JEC, are required to submit their available hearing dates through March 6 by Sunday at 5 p.m.
Hill intends to have Jean Hyun, the SA vice president for judicial and legislative affairs, represent him, but he must submit a written statement to the court explaining why Hyun should represent because Hill is acting in his personal capacity as a CCAS student and not as SA president, the order states. Hyun must almost submit a written statement explaining why she should be able to represent Hill.
“Failure to respond to this order shall render the noncompliant person or party liable for sanctions and further discipline by the Court,” the order states.
The court had no comment in regard to the order, said Yousif, the court’s registrar.

An unknown subject robbed a 7-Eleven near the GW Hospital Tuesday, fleeing before Metropolitan Police Department officers arrived at the scene, MPD spokesperson Hugh Carew said.
Carew said the suspect stole money from the cash register at the store located on New Hampshire Avenue, and officers received a call about the incident at around 2:20 p.m. University officials issued a GW alert notifying the community about the crime around 3 p.m.
“POLICE ACTIVITY Robbery of Establishment,” the alert states. “MPD investigation in the 900 block of NEW HAMPSHIRE AVE NW. Avoid the area.”
The University issued a second alert at 3:46 p.m., announcing that the site of the crime had been cleared.
