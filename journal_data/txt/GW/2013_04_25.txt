The Residence Hall Association spent about $1,300 on upscale dinners and apparel for a newly  elected executive board, prompting its president to resign Saturday after attempting to disband  the organization.
Freshman Patrick Wohl said he stepped down after University officials ignored his concerns that the student-run organization, which deals with facilities issues in halls, was abusing funds from its $30,000 budget from the Center for Student Engagement. He stepped down just weeks after accepting the post, after learning that the group’s executive board had used funds on outings to Outback Steakhouse and Carmine’s Restaurant, Starbucks coffee runs and hoodies for the executive board.
“I was sick of being a part of an organization that wastes student money so recklessly, and I hope that this will change,” Wohl said. He said he pushed to cut travel costs for a national conference in Pennsylvania this summer, which will likely cost thousands due to travel expenses. RHA spent about $7,000 this year on travel and conference tickets for a handful of executive board members. Wohl called RHA’s use of funds inefficient, because many of its responsibilities could overlap with the Student Association cabinet’s. The RHA also runs annual events such as Martha’s Marathon and Target Takeover, which Wohl said could easily be merged with  Program Board’s duties.
CSE director Tim Miller shot down Wohl’s call to revoke the organization’s charter and move its role of  overseeing residence hall life under the Student Association, he said, adding that he will continue pushing top administrators to disband the RHA in future weeks.
“I think people ought to know what their money is going to and how organizations are spending it, so students can hold them accountable,” Wohl said. “While RHA has a purpose, it’s inefficient and could be done in better ways.”
Miller said his office has reviewed RHA expenses for the past year and said staff members “feel really good about where the RHA is for the remainder of the year.” He added that they have “significant funds to continue their planned end-of-the-year programs.
“In addition, the decision to attend the national conference will not dramatically impact the remaining funds or the organization’s ability to support life on campus,” Miller said.
Executive board members are given debit cards to pay for the organization’s expenses, which mostly go toward planning events in residence halls. The president gets a personal stipend of $6,000, compared to $15,000 scholarships for Student Association executives.
Former RHA President Jacob Thayer said Wohl’s power as president was limited, because presidents do not have  voting power within the organization. He seconded the freshman’s concerns about funding and said RHA should upgrade parts of residence halls, like buildings’ basements, to make better use of the money. Wohl’s sudden resignation, announced to hundreds of members, sparked presidential candidates to stress frugality and financial accountability in their platforms.
RHA, which comprises students from every residence hall who have been elected by their hallmates, does not receive funding from the SA, which doles out an average of about $3,000 to each of the University’s about 400 student groups.
All three candidates at the organization’s meeting Monday promised to trim expenses and improve financial planning. Freshman Casey Syron said RHA has been “shamefully run,” and said he was disgusted to learn that his hard-earned tuition money was used to fund lavish leadership dinners.
“I am sick and I am tired of how irresponsibly our funds are being managed. Every single dime needs to go to our residences. Every single dime needs to go towards advocacy,” Syron said during his two-minute election speech. Syron got two votes in the race after a pros and cons debate that skewered his speech for not taking the position seriously.
While running for RHA president, Wohl pledged to cut down the group’s $7,000 conference expenses. Still, Miller defended the leadership training that conferences provide.
Three members of the organization are scheduled to attend the National Association of College and University Residence Halls Conference in Pennsylvania this summer. Several members were flying in from the West Coast, and Wohl said they pushed to scrap the plans in favor of using the funds for more residence hall events.
RHA Vice President Matt Scott said the amount of members going this year will not change, adding that he is  excited that GW’s RHA is up for two awards at the conference.
“This experience will allow us to refine our ideas and learn from successes and failures at otherUniversities – something we feel will be extremely beneficial for the campus community,” Scott said.

Students could win a year’s worth of free tuition if they pitch a plan that saves or pulls in $1 million for the University annually.
The incentive marks an attempt to involve more students in the Innovation Task Force, which conducts a series of brainstorming sessions that will last five years as GW looks to cut costs and raise funds through ideas like telecommuting and training for international judges.
While six students have been on the task force annually since 2009, they have never championed an idea.
The group has floated 28 projects – nearly all of which have stemmed from administrators or faculty members. About three-quarters of those ideas have been carried out, tallying $34 million in slashed waste or new revenue since 2009.
The scholarship was one of seven ideas presented at GW’s sixth idea showcase Wednesday.
The student selected next year would help GW tap into “the creativity and innovation of the student body,” should University President Steven Knapp choose to follow through with the project, said Megan Flood, one of GW’s internal consultants.
To ramp up interest in the project among students, Flood also said the task force would look to add a student intern to aid promotion across GW and keep track of deadlines.
“The tricky part for students will be figuring out what GW is doing already and working from that,” Flood, a junior project manager within the Office of Finance, said.
She added she hoped to see between 30 and 35 student finalists working with faculty and alumni mentors by January or February of next year. Students would present their ideas the same way as administrators working on the committee, complete with objectives, financial analysis and a list of the plan’s benefits and drawbacks.
Finalists would be judged on how the proposals fit into the University’s mission and how long the ideas will take to implement. The student would not be tied to helping implement their own idea.
“This is really an idea to get more ideas,” Flood said. “We are still fleshing it out, but it is a way to get more students involved in ITF.”
Senior Associate Vice President for Finance Dave Lawlor said the task force has identified $56 million that will be available in 2015. By 2017, the group is projected to rake in $75 million yearly, surpassing the original goal of $60 million.
The Innovation Task Force was created by President Steven Knapp in 2009. Charged with funding an additional $60 million for research and academic programs in five years, the group has helped launch ideas such as new online degree programs and a master’s program in public contracting.
The group of faculty and students also proposed Tuesday an on-site master’s program with employers, which would be developed based on an existing model in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Students will enroll in an on-site or partially online master’s program, and their curriculum will be tailored by an employer.
The engineering school already offers online and off-site courses in which students work with employers. It connects students with alumni, and students are reimbursed for their work if they receive a “B” or better in the course.
Expanding the online master’s program is expected to bring in about $2 million for the University, Lawlor said. The University has increased online programs within the School of Nursing and the GW School of Business this year, as well.
The Innovation Task Force is also pushing for renewable energy through power purchase agreements, after noticing the market for sustainable products becoming cheaper. The group hopes to reduce energy costs through renewable power purchase agreements.
The initiative would not require any capital investment, but the task force does not know what the exact benefit would be or when it would be implemented.
The group also proposed a regulatory training certificate for attorneys and senior executive technical professionals, which would produce $1 million in revenue annually.
Previous ITF initiatives have included training certificates in areas such as sustainability and organizational ethics.

The Metropolitan Police Department added foot and bike patrols to Foggy Bottom neighborhoods along the edges of campus this month, responding to complaints of noise and vandalism on weekend nights.
Neighbors who helped lobby for patrols said they will cover 16th, 24th and 25th streets and H, I and K streets between midnight and 3 a.m. MPD spokeswoman Gwendolyn Crump declined to provide details on the patrol changes, saying the department is “adequately staffed in this area.”
A group of locals say they brought their concerns about student behavior to the University in October, but have been ignored. GW has maintained that out-of-boundary residences fall under the jurisdiction of MPD, and said the University’s off-campus student affairs office provides information to students about how to be good neighbors.
“Some of the incidents are minor, but there have been several incidents of significant damage to sculptures,” longtime Foggy Bottom resident Kenneth Durham wrote in a community email thread Monday.
University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard said MPD informed the University of the patrols, but UPD Chief Kevin Hay would not comment on the patrol schedules or operations.
Sherrard said last week that UPD, which previously sent officers off campus to ask students to lower noise levels, will change its response protocol after the University realized those actions exceed UPD authority.
The city’s noise laws ban “unreasonably loud noise between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. that is likely to annoy or disturb one or more other persons in their residences.” Breaking that law after receiving a verbal warning could land an offender fines of up to $1,000, up to 10 days of prison time, or both.
Some neighbors have said this year’s disturbances are at record levels, but the total number of off-campus complaints has dropped by 30 percent – from 115 to 80 – between the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 academic years.
Durham, who has met with the University’s community relations office several times each year for the past six years, criticized GW’s off-campus policies in January, while lauding neighboring Georgetown University’s mandatory housing contracts and off-campus orientation program.

Gelman Library has long gotten a bad rap, but concerns heightened in the last month after consultants said it doesn’t  measure up as a research library – a shame as the University tries to ramp up its research output. And if that wasn’t enough, the library temporarily closed due to excessive heat two weeks ago, creating an even more uncomfortable environment as students prepare for final papers and exams. The ongoing construction to the first floor and in Kogan Plaza looks promising, but going forward, the University needs to make upgrades that are not purely cosmetic.
A generous alumnus marked in his will that he will leave $2.5 million for the University, part of which will go to the Department of Theatre and Dance. This is a great sign for the arts at GW, especially since these departments often go overlooked. The fund will be used in part to help pay for MainStage productions and provide scholarships for student actors. The District has a growing theatre and dance scene, and this gift is a great opportunity which will hopefully permit GW students to continue to embrace this burgeoning culture.
The University has had its fair share of embarrassing headlines this year. And two weeks ago, The Washington Post published a story that drew ire from students and aministrators alike. Instead of delving deeper into a university at a crossroads, The Post favored scandalous tidbits and drunken man-on-the-street reporting to provide a surface-level snapshot of GW. We tip our hats to University President Steven Knapp for defending our school and lambasting the article as a “distorted characterization of our students.”
After administrators largely dispelled students’ appeals for more student space earlier this semester, it is reassuring to see that the most recent plans for the “superdorm” include meeting rooms with couches and pool tables. With these new changes, the residence hall – which will replace The West End, The Schenley and  Crawford Hall and is slated for completion in 2016 – has potential to fit the bill as a much-needed campus hub.
The Hatchet reported Monday that after years of operating outside of its jurisdiction, the University Police Department would change its protocol. But UPD Chief Kevin Hay declined to provide any information regarding reports of a change in his department’s off-campus response policies. UPD is responsible for keeping campus safe and enforcing the rule of law, and it is troubling that at a time when officers apparently were operating outside of the law, the department’s leader refused to comment. And UPD’s off-campus actions are even more frustrating because unlike the Metropolitan Police Department, UPD keeps its records under lock and key. When MPD responds to an incident, it maintains a record that any member of the public can view. This lack of transparency, coupled with the refusal to comment, is unacceptable.

Before making it to the big screen, Zach Braff was smoking weed and riding drunk in the back of vans with his fellow fraternity brothers.
The star who got his big break on “Scrubs” spoke Wednesday about everything from an on-screen make-out session with Natalie Portman, which he called “wonderful,” to a run around Paris looking for morning-after birth control pills for a recent hook-up.
The writer-actor-director of “Garden State,” who was a member of Phi Kappa Psi at Northwestern University, joined roughly 1,000 students in Lisner Auditorium. The event, hosted by the Interfraternity Council, Panhellenic Association and Multicultural Greek Council, cost $20,000, IFC chair Casey Wood said.
Within minutes of arriving on stage, Braff had flashed his chest, sung songs, and cracked jokes that made the GW administrator sharing the stage with him cringe.
Braff instructed the moderator, Vice President for External Relations Lorraine Voles, to put on “earmuffs” each time he joked about sex and drugs on college campuses.
The 38-year-old, who graduated with a degree in film in 1997, said he first bonded with his fraternity brothers in Phi Kappa Psi because “they smoked a shitload of weed.”
Initially hesitant about joining Greek life, Braff said soon after rushing, he had already dated a sorority girl, rode in the back of a moving van and bonded with his pledge brothers while the upperclassmen hazed them.
“As fucked up as it was, we really did bond. But I’m sure they don’t have that here,” Braff said, prompting laughter in the crowd.
Braff also recounted losing his virginity, calling it “more of a short story than a novel” because of his lack of experience.
He also talked about a pregnancy scare after having sex on a train in Europe, and the struggle to obtain a morning-after pill from a French pharmacist.
“There has been an accident,” Braff said he scribbled on a note, written with help from a friend whose French was out-of-practice. “The baby of my lover is inside of me. I do not want it there.”
He arrived on the Lisner stage after raising more than $1 million in a 12-hour period for his next movie – half the total goal. The funds, raised through the crowdfunding site Kickstarter, will go toward his next movie, “Wish I Was Here,” which will follow the tone and style of “Garden State.”
Braff called crowdsourcing a “new frontier for filmmakers who won’t get help from studios to make money.” He said he plans to start production this summer.
Braff also told the crowd that he wanted to “impart some knowledge on you and not just make weed jokes.”
He explained that the opportunity to star in “Scrubs” only came about because he was turned down for a role in a New York City play.
“At times when you don’t get that huge job or you don’t get into that thing that you wanted to get into, in my experience, something ten times more amazing has been the result,” Braff said.

Detroit federal officials charged a former student Tuesday for illegally obtaining nude photos of more than a dozen women and threatening to distribute them.
Adam Savader, 21, is in federal custody in New York, facing charges of cyberstalking and extortion. He allegedly sent threatening messages anonymously to 15 women between May 2012 and February 2013, according to a release from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Police officers from Ann Arbor, Michigan initiated the investigation after an alleged victim came forward and said someone had hacked her email account and obtained nude photos.
With the help of FBI investigators, the detectives then identified 15 victims in the District, Detroit and Long Island, New York. The Washington Post reported that many of the victims are “college students who knew Savader.”
When Savader used a Google Voice account to message one girl last fall, he threatened to send nude pictures of her to the Republican National Committee, her parents and her sorority if she didn’t send more photos, according to the complaint filed by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.
He also allegedly texted another girl last fall: “do u want ur family and everyone in DC to see ur tits? Just agree to e-mail me a pic of u in a bra.”
Savader transferred to GW as a sophomore in fall 2010, and University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard said Savader was a student through spring 2012. He was featured in a story in GW Today, the University’s newsletter, in February 2012 for his work on Newt Gingrich’s presidential campaign.
The 21-year-old is also well-known on the campaign trail, previously interning for former presidential candidates Gingrich and Mitt Romney, as well as vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan.
Alexander Miller, chairman for GW College Republicans, said Savader was a member of the student organization but his involvement was “minimal.”
If convicted, he could face up to five years in prison, according to the FBI release.

Zelenkov follows through on a serve while practicing at the Mount Vernon Campus.  Despite his lack of experience, he has proven himself as a team leader.
When Danil Zelenkov lost his singles match at UC Santa Barbara five weeks ago, the promising freshman from Macedonia saw his singles record slump to 9-8.
The rest of his team followed suit, and the Colonials ultimately fell to the Gauchos, 6-1.
But since the poor showing in southern California, GW has lost just one match, and Zelenkov has yet to lose again on the singles court.
With the team now focused on the Atlantic 10 tournament – which starts Thursday in Ohio with GW as the No. 2 seed – the straight-talking freshman has his sights set even further.
“This season is like the first battle of a major war,” Zelenkov said. “With what we are trying to accomplish, forget the rankings and the NCAAs. Forget everything. It’s about building that discipline and that image and values in the team so that when new players come to the team they know the culture.”
Recently, that culture has become one that demands winning. The team is now hoping to grab a third straight conference trophy and clinch a third consecutive NCAA tournament bid.
Zelenkov will enter the A-10 Championship riding an eight-match winning streak at the No. 3 singles position, and a six-match winning streak at the No. 2 doubles slot.
He’s setting a new standard for freshman athletes, having won A-10 Rookie Performer of the Week seven times, including once this past week. That’s the highest number of weekly honors given to a men’s tennis freshman in the conference since 1999.

Before coming to GW, head coach Greg Munoz asked the incoming freshman to gain some experience on GW’s hard courts. Zelenkov previously had exclusive experience playing on clay courts where the ball travels much slower, but he’s adjusted quickly to the faster courts, eliminating any concerns Munoz may have once held.
“He’s not a typical freshman. He’s a little different than the others. He’s very goal driven and very serious,” Munoz said. “He shows his true self at all times, so he is easy to work with.”
Though Zelenkov admits he lacks experience and doesn’t know exactly what to expect at the conference tournament, he said he is eager to compete with what he describes as a close-knit team with strong senior leadership.

“They’ll know that we aren’t a team that has gotten lucky,” he added. “It’s about building that reputation and showing that we have a good program and will continue to have a good program that is only getting better. I want to have that kind of impact on the program and on the school.”
Munoz added that even the most talented collegiate tennis players experience mid-season struggles, as evidenced by the UC Santa Barbara match.  Zelenkov, though, changed his approach on the court midway through the spring, which has helped him avoid what Munoz called “the rookie wall.”
“He started off the spring being conservative, but he realized that he couldn’t win consistently unless he plays aggressively,” Munoz said. “Many of the freshmen that I’ve had in the last seven years have hit that wall during the season. He’s not one of them. His entire game is getting better and better. I have complete faith in how he’s going to perform moving forward.”
Zelenkov has proved vulnerable when he plays conservatively and allows for opponents to act as the aggressor.  He has learned, however, to use his particularly strong forehand and his considerable power to win points quickly and immediately put his opponents under pressure.
The Colonials nabbed the second seed in the conference tournament after losing their final match of the regular season against new conference foe and top-seeded VCU, 4-2. Despite the team loss, Zelenkov easily defeated his opponent in straight sets, 6-1, 6-2.
 Zelenkov will look to build on that personal win as he competes in postseason play for the first time as a college athlete, hoping to continue the poise and focus that his teammates and coaches say have been an asset.
“College tennis is different. Team unity defines how we develop and how well we do. I’ve learned that even when you think you are playing your best there is still chance for improvement,” Zelenkov said. “We definitely should believe that we have a shot to win conference and then make it to NCAAs. I’m excited.”

Historic streaks can come to a close when a team least expects it.
GW, riding a 12-game, program-record win streak into the second game of Wednesday’s double header, had a chance to sit tied atop of the A-10 leader board with Saint Joseph’s. The stage seemed set for the 13th straight win, the Colonials taking the field after the last place team in the A-10, La Salle, a program they had defeated earlier in the afternoon.
But the team could not solve Explorer freshman Mary Cate Scott’s changeup. In a complete game with five strikeouts and four hits allowed, Scott puzzled the potent Colonial offense. They went a combined 1-for-7 from the plate in game two Wednesday as they lost 6-4, after winning the first contest of the afternoon 7-4.
“We weren’t able to make the adjustment. She was just like our pitcher [junior] Courtney [Martin]. What we usually do to other teams was done to us. So we got a taste of our own medicine,” head coach Stacey Schramm said.
The Colonials could not find a rhythm at the plate, but they seemed like they might pull ahead in the final frame as they loaded the bases with two outs.
Valos walked to bring in one run, closing the gap to two, but a Taylor ground out on a nice play by the La Salle shortstop up the middle ended the game, and with it, the winning streak.
“At first we weren’t swinging at it unless we had two strikes. Then once we went through the lineup one time, we decided we were always going to swing at the changeup and that didn’t work,” Schramm said on GW’s strategy at the plate. “The La Salle pitcher did a great job.”
The Colonials were also stunted by a few close calls that, if they went the other way, might have swung the final tally on the scoreboard. In the second inning, GW tried a double steal but senior Autumn Taylor was called out at third base.
“If Autumn is safe on that [play], then that’s another run. Little things just didn’t go our way,” Schramm said.
Freshman Meghan Rico started the game but was chased early after two innings of work, giving up four runs on four hits with three walks. All four of the runs came off the bat of Explorer junior Megan Hodgson, and exemplified the sort of shaky performance that seemed to spread through GW’s lineup.
“The other team was calling her on illegal pitches, I just don’t think she was really able to get into a groove and be comfortable on the mound, ” Schramm said.
The Colonials climbed out to a comfortable 6-0 lead by the fourth inning of game one. La Salle’s defense was shaky throughout the game. The first earned run GW scored was its fourth overall. The Explorers could not field cleanly to the count of four errors, and the Colonials’ first run actually came off of an error by the misplay of a ball hit by sophomore Victoria Valos to the center fielder, scoring the runner from the second.
The game continued on in this fashion until the fourth inning, in which the Colonials scrapped three runs off of two hits. One of the hits was from the already GW single-season RBI record holder, Valos, who drove in senior Tara Fogarty. The senior, who traditionally has performed well against La Sallem had another solid series against the Explorers Wednesday, going a combined 3-for-6 with two runs scored and one RBI.
“Tara Fogarty had an outstanding defensive game and an outstanding offensive game. She was solid all the way through,” Schramm said.
Martin started out strong in game one before walks plagued her. With two outs in the fifth, three singles in a row left La Salle in a good spot to get back into the game. Martin proceeded to walk the next two batters, allowing the Explorers to tack two runs on. When Martin then walked the first two batters of the seventh inning, Schramm pulled her from the game to bring in Rico.
“The umpire’s strike zone was pretty tight, and the La Salle hitters were pretty patient at the plate. The more balls she [Martin] threw, the tighter she got and started pressing,” Schramm said. “It’s really not like her, she just got a little tense, but we were able to score enough runs so it wasn’t an issue.”
Rico then walked two batters and gave up a sacrifice fly to give up two runs before she recorded the final out of the game. Martin ended up giving up four runs on five walks and five hits in six innings of work.
GW will move onto play Dayton as they continue their road swing through A-10 play.
“[La Salle is] a team we really should beat. Our offense wasn’t on and their pitcher had our number. I told them not to hang their heads for too long. We have to move forward and bounce back and that’s what this is all about. We have to be able to overcome it,” Schramm said.
