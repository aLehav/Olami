Thomas Mallon, a professor of English and director of the creative writing program, will be inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in October.
He is the third person affiliated with the University in two years to join the research center and prestigious academic society, which honors diplomats, scholars, writers, scientists, corporate leaders and others. University President Steven Knapp and Martha Finnemore, a University professor of political science and international affairs, were inducted last fall.
“We look forward to drawing on the knowledge and expertise of these distinguished men and women to advance solutions to the pressing policy challenges of the day,” Leslie C. Berlowitz, the academy’s president, said in a statement.
Among the more than 200 new members to be inducted into the academy this fall are Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, musician Paul McCartney and director Clint Eastwood.
“I’m very pleased and surprised to be in such wonderful company,” Mallon said in a news release.
Founded more than 230 years ago, the academy honors leaders in a variety of fields who produce non-partisan research.
Mallon is the author of essays, non-fiction and eight works of fiction, most recently penning “Watergate: A Novel,” a political commentary that dramatized the scandal.
Mallon was on the creative writing faculty at Vassar College for 12 years before holding leadership positions at GQ magazine and the National Endowment for the Humanities. He has been an adjunct professor at GW since 2007 and became director of the creative writing program in 2010.
Dean of the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences Peg Barratt was excited to learn of Mallon’s nomination.
“We are so appreciative of the role he plays in sparking the imagination of our students while continuing his work as an accomplished and successful writer,” she said.

The biggest money-making ideas pitched at Tuesday’s Innovation Task Force showcase would expand academic programming to outside groups like federal agencies, national service members, high school students and international students.
Out of the dozen proposals introduced in the fourth round of the initiative, an undergraduate online degree program for military members and their families, online college courses for high school students and an expansion of master’s programs to corporations and other outside organizations could make the biggest dent in the task force’s goal to find $60 million in annual academic investments.
“Over the past several cycles [of the ITF], we have attempted to bring some focus to each phase which allows the committee to explore in greater depth certain thematic areas,” task force co-chair Dave Lawlor said. “The items in Phase 4 that stand out to me are those focused on alternate delivery methods to selected target audiences, both the attention on military families, corporate clients and outreach to high school students.”
The showcase drew students, faculty and administrators to the Marvin Center to discuss the proposals, which were presented by phase four co-chairs Richard Cosentino, associate vice president for financial management, and James Mahshie, a professor of speech and hearing sciences.
Feedback from the event will help the ITF shape which six ideas GW should implement before University President Steven Knapp, Provost Steven Lerman and Executive Vice President and Treasurer Lou Katz determine the winning proposals next month.
Knapp created the task force in 2009 to funnel money into student, faculty and academic initiatives by raising money through philanthropic sources, increasing the productivity of the University’s research and instructional programs and finding savings in business processes.
Provost Steven Lerman is in charge of divvying up campus-wide funds based on appeals from the deans of the University and his senior staff. Resources saved within an individual college remain in that school and are administered under the purview of each dean.
Mahshie said while it was tough to keep up the momentum in another phase of the initiative, he was confident in the proposed ideas.
“To be honest, we sort of panicked,” Mahshie said. “We thought, ‘Oh God, all the good ideas have been taken.’ However, through the process of assembling the 13 people that were on this task force, we really started cranking. In the end, the 13 came up with 12 [ideas].”
The University may be able to count on $3.3 million in revenue from an new online degree program geared toward military families and veterans that would offer engineering and management courses at reduced tuition rates.
One benefit of all three online program proposals in the showcase would be not needing classroom space on the Foggy Bottom Campus, an increased focus for the ITF as the University nears a city-imposed enrollment cap.
Another proposal to offer GW courses online to high school students could generate $2.5 million in revenue while drawing in potential applicants. The University would first consider launching a pilot program with a local high school before it is offered to students around the world.
“I like the idea of tapping into a different market, of getting into the high school market in a way where perhaps you take advantage of the schools that have the highest reputation,” Lawlor said. “The best students are those that are likely to be thinking about these things while they’re still in high school.”
Gary Naegel, the Graduate School of Education and Human Development’s director of personnel and finance, said the program would “get GW out of geographic zones that it’s been dependent on for the last couple of years,” referring to the reliance on key feeder states like New York and New Jersey.
Marketing master’s programs to employees at outside organizations, like the World Bank, would generate about $2 million by attracting adult students who would take classes as an employee cohort.
The program, taught by adjunct faculty, would be modeled after an existing program in the School of Engineering and Applied Science, which runs an average of eight of these groups at the same time.
Among the other ideas introduced was a pre-health professional certificate program on the Virginia Science and Technology Campus, which would allow recent college graduates to take math and science credits before applying to medical, nursing or veterinary schools. The certificate program could add $1 million in revenue by bringing in students who would not count under the city-imposed enrollment cap.
“I’m super confident this is going to be a winner for us,” Cosentino said.

Stephanie Kendall was eating breakfast when she saw an e-mail with the subject “Fulbright Status.”
Kendall is one of six GW students so far this year to win a Fulbright scholarship, a prestigious grant funded by the State Department that pays for American scholars to conduct research or teach abroad.
“My hands started shaking, and I just dropped my breakfast and started screaming and crying. I was shell-shocked for the first two days,” she said.
The senior, who will begin an English teaching assistantship in Germany in September, said German culture pervades her life at GW. She majors in the language, is a member of a German honors society and serves as a research assistant in the Department of Romance, German and Slavic Languages and Literatures.
She said she took her first German class to annoy her parents.
“They wanted me to take Spanish so I decided to take the opposite of that,” Kendall said. After discovering that she liked the language and was good at it, she spent her entire junior year abroad in Freiberg, Germany.
When she told her parents about winning the fellowship, she said her mother started crying, and her father had to pull his car over because he was celebrating.
Kendall believes her year abroad gave her an edge on the Fulbright application, something Director of the Center for Undergraduate Fellowships and Research Paul Hoyt-O’Connor said can often be an advantage.
“People who have been [to a country] before generally bring a level of detail and vividness that somebody who hasn’t been there before has a tougher time doing,” Hoyt-O’Connor said.
By living in a dorm with native students, Kendall said she got the full German college experience.
“I really liked how old the culture is. Everything in the United States is so young, so going there and just seeing all the old buildings and the culture there was super fascinating,” Kendall said.
Kendall is an exception among GW Fulbright applicants, who tend to be international affairs majors looking to work in developing countries, Hoyt-O’Connor said.
This was true for GW’s two other Fulbright winners, who will both teach English in Indonesia this year. Shaylen Foley, a 2010 graduate, hopes to pursue a career in public health and Lauren Jacobson, a senior and former Hatchet reporter, is writing her thesis on national disaster campaigns and in particular, the effects of the tsunami in Indonesia.
Foley chose Indonesia because it allowed her to explore her interest in public health in developing South Asian countries. She works as an AmeriCorps member at a community health center in Adams Morgan. She also teaches yoga twice a week and tutors every Saturday through a nonprofit organization, For the Love of Children.
“I’ve definitely gotten a lot of insight into dealing with children and their learning experience,” Foley said.
Hoyt-O’Connor said, given the program’s budget cuts and growing interest nationally, “I think I’d be very, very happy if we ended up with 10 winners this year, just given the number of applications.”
This year, 42 students from GW competed for the Fulbright. Last year, GW ranked No. 12 nationally with 16 winners, a figure that Hoyt-O’Connor said could shrink as the program faces federal budget cuts.
Each country announces its winners on a rolling basis, and all decisions are typically handed down by mid-May.

The University is taking another step to improve everyone’s favorite campus eyesore – Gelman Library.
Two administrators were appointed last week to head the Future of Libraries Committee, which will determine how to best organize library space. The committee will examine how to potentially digitize Gelman’s book collection, which could potentially open up additional study space in the building.
And with the ensuing plan to revamp the first and second floors of the library beginning this summer, the future of the 39-year-old building looks promising for students.
But the community hasn’t been engaged or kept abreast of the building’s financial situation, which is critical to the future of the library’s renovations.
The University has appropriated $16 million for Gelman renovations on the first and second floors. Renovations to upper floors will have to come directly from Gelman’s operating budget or from additional fundraising efforts by the library or University, unless the University plans to direct more money towards Gelman.
The University provides a budget to cover administrative and operational costs, but Gelman is forced to solicit additional funding from external sources and voluntary gifts. The University is reluctant to fund a building like Gelman, because it is not a revenue-generating aspect of the institution.
Last year, The Hatchet reported that because the library’s budget had been stagnant for six years, it was forced to cut subscriptions to magazines, newspapers and journals. University Librarian Jack Siggins also noted that purchasing online subscriptions is a more costly endeavor than buying print ones.
Gelman spokeswoman Anne Ward first said that Siggins would not be available to contribute to this editorial but then said it was too early to tell how Gelman’s budget would impact renovations moving forward.
The only publically available information about Gelman’s finances is on the budget office’s website, but these details fail to give an in-depth account of its operating budget, as in the fiscal years 2011 and 2012, the University did not specifically name Gelman in its budget. University spokeswoman Candance Smith said that beyond what is available on the budget website, there is no additional public information.
Many students use the library more than any other facility on campus. Yet a lack of study space and chronic overcrowding will still plague students throughout the building, even after the first and second floors have been revamped.
The community deserves to know the financial situation of Gelman. The University cannot delay making the proposed changes from the Future of Libraries Committee. Failing to have a transparent budget inhibits the ability to move forward quickly.
The plan to put more money toward Gelman renovations is promising. But without information about the library’s budget, the community is left only to guess the extent of and timeline for these changes.
If it is clear that Gelman’s budget is lacking, then there will be increased urgency to shore up its finances.
And that can serve a huge benefit to the University and its projected renovations.
As the profile and prestige of the University continues to rise, students need a library to match the high standard of the institution within a reasonable time frame.

Because of student outcry, Santa Monica College, a community college in Southern California, was forced this month to abandon a plan to charge $180 per credit hour for its most popular courses over the summer, while the least popular ones would remain $46 per hour.
Administrators hoped the plan would allow for less crowding in popular classes, while also preventing additional cutbacks. Students immediately protested the additional costs, arguing that it would create an economic stratification within the school. The measure was postponed in early April.
Sunday, the Los Angeles Times reported that administrators were frustrated the plan was not viewed as a progressive solution to the college’s fiscal issues.
It is surprising the administration and students could have such polarized reactions to the plan. And this divergence represents a dangerous schism in how young adults and academics alike view higher education.
As SMC continues to ponder whether or not the plan can be salvaged, other universities, including GW, should certainly take note of this debate.
Nationally, the unemployment rate is more than 8 percent, and cost of attendance has increased exponentially in higher education. While there are uncontrollable forces that cause increases in tuition, this does not matter to students.
And maybe that’s unfair, but the old adage that perception is reality is certainly true in this case.
Because when students hear that their peers, who have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for a degree, are now taking jobs as waiters, continuing to raise tuition even more seems ridiculous. The justifications for raising tuition, such as inflation or the rising costs of health care and pensions, are not adequate responses for many.
To be sure, nobody is being pepper-sprayed at GW because of increasing tuition, but we do see inklings of frustration with the cost of attendance. The debate over fees this year is a prime example of discontent, a fight the Student Association’s fee commission took up with their comprehensive list of fees.
The same goes for those who bemoan University President Knapp’s high salary. Students cannot seem to grasp why he and other administrators should make so much at a time when students are struggling to afford college. It may not be a fair judgment, but students do make it.
Can anything be done? There is no easy solution, but the best solution is for the University to communicate with students about tuition and campus costs.
Engaging in dialogue with students about any additional fees is one way to do this. Students become frustrated when they feel they are paying fees that go into a massive bureaucracy that constantly dries out their – and their parents’ – bank accounts. Allowing students to understand the purpose of paying fees and the services that they fund will help alleviate this sense of irritation.
Beginning to partially itemize tuition bills will also make students aware of how their money is being used throughout the University. If students are able to understand the breakdown of how their money is spent, then they will have more of a sense of ownership over their tuition.
Students should not leave GW feeling like they were sneakily nickel-and-dimed while they also incurred thousands of dollars in debt. Rather, they should trust that their money is being used in a manner that directly benefits them.

I did not make it to GW for April Visit Days. I’m from Utah, and the distance was too great to travel for the one-day event.
But I still wanted to learn more about the University before sending in my tuition deposit. So I scoured the University’s website, but there was little worthwhile information, save for an admissions blog and a few briefs about what my life as a Colonial could be.
GW should give those who can not make the trip to campus the resources to experience GW before making a final enrollment decision. Students need to see more than a few pamphlets, and thanks to the technology available today, this is possible.
To cater to students unable to travel for April Visit Days, the University should offer a virtual admitted students day where prospective students can tour GW, get students’ perspectives and even see what the residence halls are like.
The website could make use of pictures of residence hall rooms, as well as answers to common April Visit Day questions such as, “Can I choose how many people I want to live with?” or, “Is the Mount Vernon Campus the same as Colonial Mount Vernon?” It might seem silly, but getting friendly answers to parent and student concerns often give the last wave of relief before students come to GW. It could provide a video of the average STAR tour, with the bubbly personalities of tour guides to help settle last-minute enrollment qualms.
Prospective students would be able to experience GW before matriculating. Student Admissions Representatives and the Office of Undergraduate Admissions already do an excellent job of selling the University to prospective students, but it is important that the University also targets those who can’t make it to D.C.
The University will offer virtual campus tours beginning this summer, but these will be year-round resources. So in addition, the University should create virtual admitted students days to engage students in the college acceptance process.
Other colleges across the country already offer prospective students ways to engage their admissions departments and campuses, even if those students can’t step foot on them. Villanova University has admissions representatives walk viewers through a virtual tour of campus. Rice University provides panoramic views of everything from buildings to the inside of dorm rooms. The University of California-Berkeley website has virtual tours and an informative, interactive map.
GW needs to be next on that list.
It is time the University rethinks its focus and gives April visits a chance to reach those perceived to be out of reach by embracing the recent growth in technology. With all the boasting about being ahead of the curve, the University must take this chance to show admitted students just how forward-thinking and accepting it really can be.

George Washington envisioned a university that would train students to become citizen-leaders and help forge a student identity that would transcend regional differences and local prejudices. As we embark on a strategic plan for the next decade, we find that Washington’s vision is as relevant today as it was during his own time.
But his vision has global implications; we no longer train citizen-leaders of our country alone, but citizen-leaders of the world.
The theme “Citizenship and Leadership” in the strategic plan reflects a view that the University must determine how best to advance the important areas of intellectual inquiry related to these concepts.
The citizenship and leadership strategic planning task force will think deeply about the issues of citizenship, leadership and civic responsibility, as well as how to create responsible and responsive students who are prepared for their roles in a diverse and globally connected society.
In her commencement address to graduates in 2010, First Lady Michelle Obama said, “We are no longer isolated from what happens on the other side of the world.”
Teaching students to be citizen leaders – to take up the demands of securing our most cherished community values with others – is one of the greatest services we can provide as a University.
The task force will consider an array of questions, including the following: how the University will engage with the communities in which we are embedded; how we train our students as future leaders and responsible citizens; and how the research we produce translates into thoughtful leadership around the issues of individual, corporate and university citizenship.
The fundamental aim is to invest in GW’s capacity to solve globally significant issues in diverse communities by developing and utilizing the social, intellectual and civic capacity of our students, faculty, staff and alumni.

Dressed in traditional Union blues, civil war re-enactors marched down Pennsylvania Avenue as a reminder of history at the Emancipation Day celebration Monday.
City politicians used the April 16 event commemorating President Abraham Lincoln’s signing of the Compensated Emancipation Act that freed D.C. slaves on the same day in 1862 – nine months prior to the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation – to rally marchers for the District statehood cause.
“We have come from slavery, to Lincoln, to [Barack] Obama, to a monument on the Mall for Martin Luther King,” Clarence Davis, D.C. public records administrator and historian, said. “All these issues are tied into this struggle around freedom, liberty, justice and equality that came out of slavery and discrimination and segregation, and fighting those battles.”
Davis was one of hundreds of people at Freedom Plaza’s festivities marking the 150th anniversary of the signing. Festival-goers wore tags with the number 3,100 – the number of slaves freed by the act.
Tents cropped up at the plaza celebration, featuring singers and jazz music, as well as food and drinks. The celebration also featured a stage for speeches from political participants. A line of stalls sold commemorative T-shirts and marching band figurines.
While Monday’s celebrations lasted through the day and led into an evening fireworks display, the planning committee organizes events year-round that explore themes of race, slavery and life in the District. For example, an April 18 lecture series panel featured Andrew Zimmerman, an associate history professor at GW, who discussed international perspectives on emancipation.
The panel, “DC Emancipation: The Struggle for Freedom, Liberty, Justice and Equality” focused on the years leading up to emancipation, as well as its aftermath and impact on D.C.
“The idea of rebelling against slavery was not just a U.S. phenomenon,” Zimmerman said. “It was something that existed in colonies all over the world.”
He called emancipation one of the great examples of social change.
Mayor Vincent Gray tied the freedom gained 150 years ago to struggles D.C. faces today.
“I think we all recognize that this was as much an economic issue as it was a social issue. We are hardly free in this city – although we’re not enslaved in the way we were in 1862,” Gray said.
Davis said Emancipation Day has grown over the years from a small-scale event to one that includes a parade, musical performances and big-name speakers. Legislation passed through the D.C. Council in 2004 to turn the day into a city-recognized holiday, shutting local government offices to commemorate the event.
Loretta Carter Hanes, a D.C. resident, was responsible for “single-handedly bringing back this glorious history to the D.C. community,” Davis said.
“It was primarily an African-American community and neighborhood event that started out in the home of Ms. Hayes. It grew,” David said. “Universities, churches and local organizations began hosting programs and eventually the District planned Emancipation Day as a citywide event.”
Rev. Jesse Jackson capitalized on the celebration as an opportunity to spread the statehood message.
“We want representation! We want our rights! We want change,” Jackson said. “It’s a mixed joy, a blessing, a pain because the people are saved, but not free for democracy. After 150 years, we still do not have the right to vote.”
He said he laments the 15 decades that D.C. residents have spent without full representation in Congress since the city’s slaves earned freedom.
