Director of the GW Institute for Nanotechnology Michael Keidar spent the last three years developing a cancer cell-killing medical device that he said could revolutionize the disease’s treatment worldwide.
The associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering earned a license for his product May 16, becoming the University’s 11th patent in the last two years – three more than the previous two years.
“This is exactly what you talk about, putting basic lab research into the commercial world,” Keidar said. “To put this in the market, I sense some urgency.”
The licensing deal, which will give the company patent rights and grant the University and Keidar a stake in potential profits, is a reflection of the University’s intensifying efforts to blend research with business.
Vice President for Research Leo Chalupa said he knows that for the University to earn a name as a major research institution, it must pick up its commercialization efforts, which he believes have picked up steam since GW founded its Office of Technology Transfer two years ago. To measure up to research powerhouses like Stanford and Columbia universities, which sponsor a flood of patents each year that pull in millions of dollars, GW is looking toward scientists with big ideas, like Keidar, to incrementally build up its research prowess.
“If we had one faculty member who was able to start a successful company, that would get everyone’s attention like that,” Chalupa said, snapping his fingers.
The University has been ramping up its research focus, which has been a signature of University President Steven Knapp’s tenure since he came to GW in 2007.
Knapp said the technology transfer office was essential “to enable your faculty and students to get their ideas out there where they can really make a difference,” even though those the products licensed by the office rarely make money.
Jim Chung, director of the Office of Entrepreneurship, said his four-person staff has redoubled its outreach this year to faculty involved in research, meeting with researchers and departments to spread the word about how to commercialize the fieldwork.
He added that the office has been building relationships with major D.C. companies and angel investors to increase exposure to the office’s work. The office held its first ever open house last month to promote innovation, holding a competition to recognize the researcher with the best potential for licensing commercialization.
He pointed to other recent successes for GW researchers whom his office helped, including a cell phone service to help cigarette smokers quit that was developed by public health researcher Lorien Abroms and licensed by the technology company Voxiva in 2010. But he said most faculty members are not in a mindset of commercializing their research.
“A lot of them to be honest underestimate what the commercial impact of what research they might be doing,” Chung said.
Such deals rarely rake in large earnings for universities, Chalupa said. The University has only earned about $100,000 from licensing products since his office was created in 2009, while Chalupa’s former school, University of California-Davis, made about $10 million.
“It’s one of those things if you say, ‘Boy, it’s going to big source of income,’ that’s a mistake. But to be a research university you have to have that,” Chalupa said. “We started this thing pretty much from ground zero, because we had nobody here before.”
The Research Advisory Board, a 13-member panel of outside experts and administrators, convened for the first time May 15. Future discussions may involve how to bolster GW’s commercial efforts, Chalupa said, adding that he is not sure whether the panel board will make the subject its main focus.
Chalupa said the results are slow but promising as the University looks to build on the momentum that lifted GW into the National Science Foundation’s top 100 research institutions for the first time last month.
The Science and Engineering Hall, which will open in 2015, and hiring a burst of upstart researchers would add to commercial research potential, School of Engineering and Applied Science Dean David Dolling said.
The $275-million building will boast 480,000 square feet, including a lab for nano-scale research, and house almost all of the 40 researchers hired between 2010 and opening day.
He believes new laboratories could magnify the potential for big discoveries.
“It’s sort of like a snowball going down a hill. My theory is it will only take one or two successes to really get the ball rolling,” Dolling said, adding that the University needs to give researchers “the freedom, facilities, the structure, the community to think those kind of thoughts.”
Keidar said more faculty are seeing commercial possibilities for research, and as he tries to draft his own success story, it would take many more to put GW on the map.
“I don’t see this as a game change, and that overnight our professors will be developing commercial products,” Keidar said. “It has to come natural, because the main goal is basic research to understand science and technology.”

The problem with growing up is that there is always someone telling us we are not old enough. And yet, you would think that as young adults, we would finally be over it.
But even as college students, there is still one hurdle we cannot quite clear, one word that brings our youth crashing back down upon us every time – being called an undergraduate. It is the last stage of growing up that we can cling to, and the only name someone can call us to make us feel insignificant and young all over again.
As a rising senior, I have finally started to feel a little old and nostalgic while trying to figure out where exactly the last three years have gone. I suppose they are scattered about Foggy Bottom, running by the White House, stuck to the floor at The Guards, fried in the tater tots at Tonic or desperately carved into a desk at Gelman Library. But all it took was the instant feeling that I am unbearably young to make me want to rush through the next year.
The sensation hit me upon reading a post on the #whenindc Tumblr. “When I go out in Foggy Bottom and find myself surrounded by undergrads,” it read, above a photo of a man in a hospital gown saying, “I have made a huge mistake.”
Just like that, I was ready to grow up and no longer be one of those juvenile, annoying undergraduates.
Whether it be the nasty but incredibly cool eighth grader on the back of the bus, or that government official who says we cannot yet legally drink, we are always being told we’re too young.
More often than not, we find ourselves racing toward the next age deadline – until we run out of them. That Tumblr post made me realize that being an undergraduate is, in fact, the last of these deadlines. It is the last time foolishness will ever be expected of us.
The idea of taking advantage of our youth and appreciating our time in college is not a new one. But as undergraduates, we are trapped. We are not quite old enough to be taken seriously, but we are told we should still be pleased with our youth.
With another year of college coming to an end, freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors are ecstatic and distraught at the same time. Underclassmen await the day they can finally live in Ivory Tower or drink at McFadden’s, nervously realizing they will soon have to start taking college seriously. Upperclassmen are counting the days until they never have to fill out another one of GW’s bureaucratic forms, but are still in denial that graduation is quickly approaching.
When coming to college, we expect time to slow down, but instead it races by. Whether we spend four years sprinting toward the next deadline or scrapbooking every moment, our experiences as undergraduates are entirely what we make them. No one else can make our decisions – or our mistakes – for us.
We are always in a rush to grow up, but shouldn’t be. College is one of the last times we get to explore our passions and interests. It is a cluster of years during which foolishness and mistakes are actually expected, and even encouraged.
So while I expect adulthood has its perks, for now I am content with being an undergraduate. And more importantly, I suspect the person who created that Tumblr post wishes they still were one, because well, who wouldn’t?

To teach students about drinking alcohol responsibly, you have to give them a beer.
The Center for Alcohol and other Drug Education conducted a listening tour last month to hear student feedback on the University’s programs, looking to redefine CADE’s reputation as the “alcohol police” by starting a dialogue between students and the administration.
But if the University wants to send the message that it trusts students, it should find ways other than just a listening tour. To educate students on safe alcohol consumption and grab their attention, involve alcohol in the process.
Open a bar on campus.
I know, I know. But hear me out.
A University-run bar would be a place where students of age and faculty could meet to swap stories over a beer and meal. The purpose of the bar would not be a place for students to “get hammered,” but rather it could be a central location for the community to interact with one another in an informal, fun setting.
People always say GW lacks a sense of community. They argue that the lack of student space on campus makes it difficult for students and professors to have casual conversations outside the classroom. A campus bar or pub could close that gap.
Hundreds of D.C. bars attract students on weekends and sometimes weekdays. But an on-campus bar would provide a safe space for students to drink with friends without having to worry about trekking back to campus and potentially curb binge drinking at pre-games.
Before the remodeling of Ames Hall, the Mount Vernon Campus had a bar. But with Ames Pub gone and Froggy Bottom Pub relocating next year, the University should take this opportunity to attract students to a campus bar where it could promote safe drinking practices.
Students are less likely to fall into danger or get into trouble with alcohol if they are drinking on campus at a safe place, surrounded by friends and familiar faces.
St. Mary’s College of Maryland opened a campus bar at the end of its yearlong “responsible-drinking campaign” this month. The college insists the bar is not meant to be a place where students go to get drunk, but rather a place where they can meet their professors and friends for a casual beer. Its purpose is to instill a greater sense of community among students and faculty.
Students will drink regardless of whether the University holds town halls and information sessions, and opening a bar on campus might actually establish a sense of trust between students and the administration. If students feel the administration trusts them enough to open up a pub, they will be more likely to listen to the guidance on alcohol consumption.
Sometimes the problem is also part of the solution. Sometimes the poison is a part of the cure.

What’s not to love about graduation season? It is filled with senior send-offs, family get-togethers and free food.
But for more and more students and families, graduation season also marks the time to begin repaying loans that financed their education.
Student loan debt has become a hot national issue since news surfaced that it was hovering near – and eventually crossed – the $1 trillion mark this spring, and now Congress must act to prevent interest rates on subsidized Stafford loans from doubling from 3.4 percent July 1st.
Yet these outrages over the amount of overall student debt and the debate over interest rates miss a larger, more important point: Higher education has failed to help students and families responsibly finance a post-secondary education.
Nobody wants to see students fall deeper into debt, but the financial benefits of a lower interest rate on Stafford loans would not be overly significant. Even if rates doubled, students would pay just $6 a month extra for one year of loans, Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of the online sites FinAid and Fastweb and Lynn O’Shaughnessy, author and higher education journalist wrote in a New York Times op-ed May 9.
What the debate over the Stafford loan interest rate should focus on is the perpetual cycle of soaring tuition rates, easy credit and loans for students and families to pay for college that hopelessly leave them in tens of thousands of dollars of debt.
This has occurred in large part because loan providers such as the government have expanded loan opportunities and kept interest rates low for students and families. For example, the balance of federal student loans has increased by 60 percent over the past five years, according to the Department of Education.
Allowing the Stafford interest rate to remain lower would only continue this cycle of lower rates for families and incentives to secure loans, and would fail to send a message to loan providers, families and universities that the current system of “making college affordable” is broken. 
All of the actors involved in higher education have helped create a scramble to achieve a post-secondary education, but have failed to control the process of securing funding and ignored the potential consequences of the current system.
Continuing tuition increases and a weak economy have caused almost one in 10 borrowers who began repayment in 2009 to default within two years – nearly double the rate in 2005, according to the Department of Education. 
These harrowing figures do not mean a bachelor’s degree is not a smart financial investment. Yet this push to attend a four-year university, accompanied by competition between universities, a weak economy and soaring tuition has pushed many families to the brink of financial disaster.
What could GW do to change all of that, if anything? While Universities cannot control the loans private lenders or the government provide, they have a duty to serve as an honest broker with students and families.
And behaving responsibly means taking every step possible to ensure students and families make the best financial decisions. 
The University has an enviable and generous financial aid program, but requiring students and families to meet individually with financial aid counselors to discuss the lending process and potential consequences can only have positive results. While there is a designated session for financial matters during Colonial Inauguration, mandating specialized meetings would guarantee students and families are making the smartest financial choices.
Colleges and universities must begin to do their part to ensure that students are financially literate and understand the consequences of their decisions. To make the community more economically savvy, the University should make a financial literacy course a graduation requirement for all students. This would be a step toward transparency and honesty.
So here’s to a graduation season filled with drinks, food and loan repayment plans.

As camera flashes flickered over a sea of tassels, two Columbian College of Arts and Science professors urged graduates to cast their fears aside and forge fresh paths to success.
Associate professor of geography David Rain and director of GW’s art therapy program Heidi Bardot encouraged graduates to chart new courses and serve as examples for generations to come, even if it means deviating from others’ expectations of them.
“Society and the marketplace want you to believe that the market for success is a house in the ‘burbs and a cubicle. Resist this,” Rain said at the first of two ceremonies for the University’s largest school. “Model a different way of thinking.”
Dreams that are terrifying are the dreams that are most worth pursuing, Bardot told graduates at the college’s second graduation ceremony.
“Do the one thing that you cannot possibly do, but know that you should,” she said, emphasizing that the easiest path is rarely the most fulfilling course of action.
“Feed your soul, and fate will put you in the right place at the right time to find your dream…and hopefully, a realistic way to pay back your student loans,” she added, prompting laughter and applause from the audience.
Students at the second Columbian College ceremony heard from museum studies master’s degree recipient Sarah Stierch, who flunked out of college as an undergraduate and made a living as a make-up artist and club D.J.
Without those experiences, she said, she would not be earning her degree.
“I am in a future that I never thought I’d have,” she said. “I did this by embracing who I am. I took the boldness and rebelliousness of my youth and molded it into my future.”
Columbian College Dean Peg Barratt delivered the final messages to graduates, commending them on their academic journey and quelling concerns of a precarious job market.
“Employers today want employees who can read and write, who can be creative and analytical, who can assemble facts to outline a coherent picture of the present and use that as a foundation for achieving goals,” Barratt, who will step down as dean next June, said. “That’s what [the Columbian College does]. Judging by the caliber of our graduates here today, we do that very well.”

Transfer students do not enroll at GW for the Mount Vernon Campus experience. They come here to take advantage of city life in Foggy Bottom.
Yet this past year, the University placed transfer students on the Vern in an effort to establish a community for the group. But an administrator determined that transfers would live in Lafayette Hall on the Foggy Bottom Campus.
 Shifting transfer student housing to Foggy Bottom is a laudable change, especially after transfer students left their Mount Vernon Campus assignments en masse after the fall semester. That said, putting the overwhelming majority of transfer students in the same building gives rise to a new set of concerns and potential setbacks that the University should acknowledge.
  While transfer students may have a lot in common, they do not all share the same needs when it comes to housing. Some of these students will undoubtedly benefit from immediate access to other transfer students, but some students may not need a housing community to ease their transition into Foggy Bottom. And some might actually prefer to live in a place outside of the transfer student bubble.
As administrators experiment with the transfer community in Lafayette Hall, they should actively seek feedback from students regarding whether or not they feel that living in one cluster is worthwhile.
There might not be a one-size-fits-all solution to transfer student housing. Some students may feel isolated if they are placed in a residence hall entirely composed of transfer students, while others might find it makes for an immediate group of friends.
But that is why the University should constantly take the pulse of this important percentage of the student population that is sometimes overlooked. And if this endeavor fails or is met with poor response, the University should be willing to make the necessary changes to help the transfer community thrive.

GWids are the equivalent of students’ social security numbers on campus.
That is why it is troubling that last week, a Columbian College of Arts and Sciences academic adviser accidentally emailed 274 students a spreadsheet with the personal information – including GWids and addresses – of more than 5,000 students in the school. This mistake places private student information in the hands of an undisclosed group of students.
While the occasional administrative mistake is unavoidable, the Columbian College should have taken this opportunity to firmly protect student security.
Instead, Dean of the Columbian College Peg Barratt gave students the option of changing their GWids but also said it was not mandatory, leaving some students unsure of whether or not it is necessary to actually change their GWids.
In a digital age where people are able to access all kinds of information online, students constantly run the risk of having their private information leaked and shared with strangers. The adviser who attached a spreadsheet with GWid numbers to an email and sent it to a group of individuals left Columbian College students even more vulnerable. The University should consider the fact that accidentally sharing GWids via email poses a significant security threat, and it should have made that clear to students.
If there really is no risk, tell students that. Sitting on the fence leaves students wondering if changing their GWids is worthwhile.
