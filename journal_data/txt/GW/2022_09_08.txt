GW recently announced the Student Health Center is partnering with the DC Department of Health to assess and diagnose monkeypox cases on campus. 
DC Health officials reported 450 monkeypox cases in the District as of Tuesday since the outbreak began in the city in late May.
The District is recording the highest rates of monkeypox in the United States, with about 65 cases per 100,000 residents followed by New York and Georgia which have reported about 17 and 14 cases per 100,000 residents, respectively, according to an NBC News analysis. DC Health officials reported that more than 28,000 monkeypox vaccine doses have been administered to District residents as of Sept. 6.
GW announced late last month that the Student Health Center is partnering with the DC Department of Health to assess and diagnose monkeypox cases on campus after officials reported the first case of monkeypox in the GW community in late June and have since treated a “handful” of cases within the University community.
“It is important to understand that monkeypox is an infection that every member of the GW community should be aware of because everyone is at risk for infection if exposed, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity,” Rebekka Christie, the medical director of SHC, said in an email in August.
Monkeypox is spread through direct and indirect contact with skin lesions or through respiratory droplets, most commonly during sexual interactions. Symptoms like fever or chills, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, rash and skin lesions can occur five to 21 days after exposure.
District health officials are offering monkeypox vaccines to adult residents, employees, college students and patients in D.C. who’ve had multiple sexual partners in the last two weeks, as well as sex workers and staff at establishments where sexual activity occurs.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recorded more than 21,000 monkeypox cases nationwide, with the United States reporting the highest global case count followed by Brazil and Spain, which reported more than 5,000 and 6,000 cases, respectively.

GW applied pressure leading a 15-11 offensive shootout with nine corners compared to the Mountaineers’ five but failed to capitalize on the shot opportunities.
Men’s soccer fell in its first defeat of the regular season Monday with a 2–1 loss against Mount St. Mary’s, failing to execute several shot opportunities in the box.
The single point from the Colonials (2-1-1) came from freshman forward Alex Nicholson after GW failed to penetrate the defensive wall of the Mountaineers (2-2). Nicholson netted his first career goal after stealing the ball from the Mountaineers’ backline and slotting it in with a right kick, but the Mountaineers came out on top via two headers that graduate student forward Ruben Kiers netted in through the net’s right side.
The Colonials’ shooting percentage dipped below .200 for the first time this season, averaging .067 overall with a .400 average for shots on goal. GW applied pressure leading a 15-11 offensive shootout with nine corners compared to the Mountaineers’ five but failed to capitalize on the shot opportunities.
Junior midfielder Tim Neumann said the Colonials need to continue working on set plays to ensure they build their shots from the corners of the field or box instead of falling into the wall of the defense.
“This was obviously the first loss of the season, so right now it hurts a lot,” Neumann said in a post-game interview. “But I think the takeaway is that we fought as a team, and even though we had a lot of injuries, and we’re down on people with COVID, we did our best and we really acted as a unit and could have been a different result in the end with a lot of chances.”
GW kicked off the match with a corner kick within the first 11 minutes from junior midfielder Carter Humm who shot from the right but missed the box. The Colonials attacked the middle from the left side of the box but failed to penetrate the Mountaineers’ defense.
The Mountaineers saw their first chance to score eight minutes into the match when a corner shot from junior midfielder Jesus Salazar crossed the top of the box and a header by Kiers rolled past the outstretched hands of GW senior goalkeeper Justin Grady.
The Colonials suffered two early exits from graduate student attacker Oscar Haynes Brown and senior midfielder Elias Norris, who sustained an apparent nose injury after he was tackled twice by the Mountaineers.
Injuries sidelined four of GW’s starters – senior forward Tom Cooklin, senior defense Jared DeMott, freshman defense Keni Winger and freshman defense Connor Braun – at the start of the season. The depleted starting lineup has forced Head Coach Craig Jones to switch players around the field to accommodate the holes in the GW defense early in the season.
The Mountaineers collected the first two yellow cards in the match after a couple of hard tackles against the GW team, giving the Colonials a pair of penalties from senior midfielder Tiago Carvalho.
“This is not something that we’re new to, I think we’ve played with like one to two subs multiple times over the past few years,” graduate student midfielder Alhaji Turay said. “It’s awesome that we have the next-man-up mentality, so whoever’s next up, that’s all we have, we have a deep squad of players who have a lot of quality, a lot of grit, have a lot of intensity to them and are very cutthroat.”
In the final nine minutes of the first half, senior midfielder Tiago Carvalho found another chance for GW to score from the top of the zone, but he couldn’t sneak it by junior goalkeeper Ethan Russell. The rest of the first half remained scoreless as both teams struggled to rally their offense on the field.
The second half of the game began with one GW substitution and eight substitutions from the Mountaineers, boosting their energy on the field as they came out attacking at the top of the box. Within six minutes, they netted their second goal of the afternoon.
The Colonials responded with a corner kick that helped Nicholson net the first goal for GW after stealing the ball from the opponent’s backline and slotting it into the pipes. But it was too little too late as time ran out before the Colonials could tie the game with a final goal.
“It was definitely frustrating, we had so many chances, one on one on the goalie in the box where we could have just tied the game or maybe went on to lead,” Turay said. “So definitely with every play that we missed, it got more and more frustrating or we kept on going, and really, we really kept on creating chances, so I think he had a really good bounce-back effect. And I’m glad that we didn’t give up until like the final whistle.”
On the defensive end, Grady logged a season-high four saves on 11 shots on goal, holding on to a tight margin for the GW team until time expired.
The Colonials prepare for their first away game against Navy Friday, where they look to shake off the loss. Kickoff is set for 7 p.m.

DC Health will also offer take-home rapid antigen tests and walk-up testing sites where residents can administer PCR tests themselves at each of the eight clinics.
Updated: Sept. 8, 2022 at 10:31 a.m.
The DC Department of Health is providing free updated COVID-19 booster shots targeting the Omicron variant at walk-up clinics in each of the eight wards as officials are “considering how to approach the inclusion” of the new vaccine into the University’s COVID-19 protocol.
Members of the GW community can receive their Moderna or Pfizer booster shot at the Ward 2 walk-up clinic at 926 F St. NW with a walk-in appointment every day except Sunday, according to the Health Department’s website. University spokesperson Tim Pierce said GW’s Medical Advisory Group is “considering how to approach the inclusion” of the Omicron vaccine into the school’s COVID policy but declined to comment on if officials plan to mandate the new booster.
“We will share updates with the community as appropriate,” Pierce said in an email.
DC Health will also offer take-home rapid antigen tests and walk-up testing sites where residents can self-administer PCR tests at each of the eight vaccine clinics.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention authorized the use of the updated COVID boosters from Pfizer-BioNTech for people 12 years and older and from Moderna for people 18 years and older on Thursday.
The updated COVID booster vaccines offer protection against the two strands of the Omicron variant and the original strand of the coronavirus and represent the first time the COVID vaccines were reformulated since their creation.

The sustainability office will collect compostable materials and products like produce scraps, egg shells and pizza boxes at the 21st Street entrance of Kogan Plaza. 
Sustainable GW will expand its compost collections to operate six days a week this fall after running on a weekly schedule since 2018. 
The University will hold compost collections on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m., Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1 to 4 p.m. and Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m during the fall. The sustainability office will collect compostable materials and products like produce scraps, egg shells and pizza boxes at the 21st Street entrance of Kogan Plaza. 
The sustainability office suggests students review the D.C. Compost Guide for more information on what compost is, which materials can be composted and why composting is important for the environment.
The waste drop-off program was first launched in the spring of 2018 as a two-hour weekly collection to educate students about why composting is important while delivering the food waste to Prince George’s County Organics Compost Facility. 
Sustainable GW runs the compost collection program as a part of their Zero Waste Approach to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills and promote recycling, reusing and composting materials.

Starting September 12, Metro trains will service every station at least every fifteen minutes, and the Foggy Bottom station at least every four minutes.
Metro trains will increase service and visit every station at least every 15 minutes after the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority announced updated rail service times earlier this week.
Starting September 12, WMATA will close six Yellow and Blue line stations south of National Airport through the middle of October as they conduct maintenance on the southern portions of those lines and repair the Yellow Line tunnel through next March. The Yellow Line will cease operations until March, but Green and Blue line trains will service Yellow Line stations with increased frequency.
The service updates come after WMATA reintroduced a dozen 7000-series trains to its fleet last week.
“Providing customers with more travel options and more frequent service delivers on our priorities for the region,” General Manager and Chief Executive Officer Randy Clarke said in a release. “As we invest in infrastructure, open new stations and maintain our existing system, we move towards safer, more reliable service.”
Green Line wait times will drop from 15 minutes to eight minutes, as the Yellow Line closes for repairs. The Blue, Silver and Orange lines wait times will drop to every 15 minutes, while trains running between Rosslyn and Stadium-Armory will run every four minutes. The Red Line, which operates every 10 minutes, will remain unchanged.
Free shuttles will be available to commuters while Yellow Line stations close.

Since my freshman year, a pandemic overturned life as we knew it, the National Guard occupied campus and a Supreme Court justice stepped down from teaching a course in the face of demands for his removal.
That’s just to name a few special highlights.
The past three years have been wild and unpredictable, but every story we’ve confronted had to be told – each one cast light on the people, systems and issues that would define the current moment in University history. And through all of the major events that have rocked our campus, The Hatchet has been there to cover it all.
The 2022-23 academic year marks The Hatchet’s 119th year serving the GW community as the storyteller and record keeper for our student body. The Hatchet is an independent student newspaper completely unaffiliated with the University, meaning we can cover the institution with complete honesty, integrity and interrogation, holding the administration accountable for its actions at all times.
We have reported on GW’s hundreds of pandemic-induced layoffs, systemic racism in higher education and a University project that tracked students’ movement through campus without their knowledge. We have received numerous regional and national awards for our work across all sections, including news, opinions, culture, sports, photo, video and many more.
But we are also a student-run newspaper for a reason. We are by the students and for the students, intending to both inform and represent. After joining the newspaper during my freshman year, I quickly realized that we have not always lived up to that promise in the past.
Throughout its existence, The Hatchet has been a predominantly white organization that many students have viewed as out of touch with the larger GW community and its total diversity. We have been isolated from our student body at large, oftentimes neglecting underrepresented student groups and only covering them when some harmful, often racially-charged incident takes place on campus.
That is no way we intend to lead the paper. Starting this volume on a platform grounded in external and internal reform, The Hatchet is placing diversity, equity and inclusion at the forefront of what we stand for and how we operate.
First and foremost, our top priority is to improve our relationship with student organizations on campus. We strive to represent our student body in an equitable manner so we can tackle those shining achievements or pressing campus issues that are affecting underrepresented groups, like those that The Hatchet has overlooked in the past.
Leading our push toward progress, Volume 119 introduced the community relations director position in May to strengthen our connection to students across campus through newly established partnerships with student organizations. Senior Abrigail Williams has filled this role and already started developing our relationships with multicultural student organizations through one-on-one meetings, which we intend to continue on a regular basis. Our student life team is collaborating with Abrigail to establish a routine of attendance at student organizations’ general body meetings, where we hope to listen and connect with their members on a more personal level as familiar faces. We care. And we want to be there.
We are also making active efforts to open new opportunities for editorial collaboration with other students, even those who are not direct members of the paper. Anyone should be able to get involved and become published, no matter what. The Hatchet recently expanded Snapshot, a weekly photo feature of images taken across campus and D.C. at large, opening submissions to the general student body. A new freelance program is also in the works for students outside of The Hatchet to pitch stories that they can write or film through the Hatchet. We want to open more opportunities for students who may not have time to fully commit to our newspaper to still reap the benefits of the bylines and real-life journalism experience that we can offer. The program is meant to elevate more voices from our talented GW community that deserve to be heard.
Our plans to prioritize diversity, equity and inclusion also include extending our recruitment efforts outside the walls of our townhouse. We plan to host joint events with other student organizations with guest speakers and require DEI training for all our members with GW officials and professionals from the field of media. Educating ourselves on how to best report with a commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion is the least we can do as a newspaper striving to respect and represent the community we cover.
So under so much ongoing change, why join The Hatchet?
There’s no better time than now. We are expanding and growing like never before, bringing on new talent that will push the newspaper forward to a future that better represents our students. Campus life is only going to get busier from here on out as students continue to find their footing on the campus they lost for more than a year leading up to our first school year back in person. Traditions are returning, and new ones are being formed. Students are as vocal as ever. The overhaul of GW’s administration is just beginning. The lack of D.C. statehood continues to endanger the rights afforded to the District government and its constituents.
The news won’t be slowing down anytime soon, and you can count on us to never miss a beat. Don’t forget we are here for you, the students, through it all. You may not agree with every single editorial decision we make, but we will always welcome your feedback and criticism. Hearing you react to our coverage is a major way for us to learn and continue changing for the better. We take our responsibility very seriously – to keep you informed and always tell the full story, and every story. We view our jobs as an honor and a privilege, and we hope the work we do will serve you well.
Thank you so much for reading. Feel free to email jwardwell@gwhatchet.com, message me on social media or stop by The Hatchet’s townhouse to say hello, ask any questions or share your concerns. I look forward to what the year ahead will hold.

Crunchy sourdough bread, crispy sliced granny smith apples and gooey brie cheese seamlessly combine to create a sensory experience and a memorable moment for your tastebuds.
Nestled near a quiet corner off M Street in Georgetown, Say Cheese’s mom-and-pop feel combined with high-quality cheeses like smoked gouda, brie and grilled halloumi make it a must-visit.
Just a 20-minute walk from the heart of campus, Say Cheese has offered an extensive menu consisting of all-day breakfast, sandwiches, smoothies and more since opening in 2018. Bright oranges and yellows light the festive exterior of the 29th Street eatery, and its scenic view of the historic shopping area in Georgetown gives a warm welcome to customers before wowing them with creative grilled cheese sandwiches and delicious smoothies.
Immediately upon entering the small, quiet shop, the owner and sole employee inside at the time ensured I received the best possible experience in the establishment. The exceptional customer service and hospitable, welcoming environment put customers at ease before they enjoy what feels like a home-cooked meal with a thoughtful presentation and cozy interior. Since the restaurant became a GWorld vendor in fall 2019 and adopted Meal Deals this year, the owner says student presence has slowly been increasing.
I ordered the signature Apple & Brie Sandwich ($8.50), an out-of-the-box grilled cheese sandwich and a popular Say Cheese specialty that packs a medley of complementary flavors and textures. Crunchy sourdough bread, crispy sliced granny smith apples and gooey brie cheese seamlessly combine to create a sensory experience and a memorable moment for your tastebuds. To finish off this delicious trio, patrons can choose a fig spread or mango chutney that top the contents. I chose the fig spread, which added substantially to the dish overall and brought out the most prominent flavors.
Not only were the flavors incredible, the presentation and service took this dish above and beyond. Each sandwich is made right in front of you, ensuring fresh and high-quality ingredients.
Other specialty sandwiches include the Taste of New York, the Turkey & Apple Butter and The Goat, all of which come with options for wheat, rye or sourdough and a bag of chips. Jumping over to the main sandwich menu, the Gouda Crunch ($8.50) once again boasts a rare combination of textures with melted gouda cheese over crunchy potato chips. This scrumptious sandwich pairs exceptionally well with the warm and hearty tomato soup dip ($2 extra).
It is impossible to ignore the appeal of the Classic Combo, a classic cheddar grilled cheese with a side of tomato soup ($10.50), perched atop the sandwich menu. A childhood favorite for people everywhere, few can resist such a comforting meal – particularly when surrounded by the homey interior decor of Say Cheese.
The menu doesn’t stop with sandwiches – there is something for everyone to enjoy on the seemingly never-ending list. Whether you are looking for soup, salad, coffee, tea, smoothies, shakes or just a bag of chips, Say Cheese should be the first stop on your next walk through Georgetown.
Although coffee may not be first on your list of menu items to try at Say Cheese, don’t skip out on their extensive list of caffeinated beverages that also includes chai and matcha. Not only are these beverages tasty, but they are also some of the cheapest coffee you will ever find in the District, especially where coffee shops frequently charge a big buck for added flavors or alternative milks. I tried the 20 oz. iced chai latte with almond milk ($3.95), which was just the right afternoon pick-me-up.
While dining on campus may seem more convenient, especially as the weather starts to cool down and walking becomes less desirable, consider making the short trip with your friends and cozying up with a grilled cheese and some warm tomato soup just a short walk away at Say Cheese. You won’t find a better grilled cheese sandwich in the District.

Kamau Louis is a senior majoring in political science.
Everyone knows about the classic GW stereotype – those rich kids who only talk about their “Hillternship,” too focused on themselves to carry any real sense of school pride. The first half of that statement may be true, but I wholeheartedly disagree that school spirit is missing from our student body. From the ranks of George’s Army to the River Horse by Lisner Auditorium, school spirit is alive and well on campus – you just have to know where to find it.
Does the University have the same amount of school spirit as Florida State, the University of Michigan or The Ohio State University? Of course not – we are an extremely nerdy school for people who want to become president but just end up as middle-level career bureaucrats. But the one-of-a-kind experience of a GW student is a privilege that many take pride in through University events or special traditions that celebrate our history.
Unfortunately, GW’s history of intense academics, toxic internship culture and extracurricular competitiveness might engender a cutthroat sense of intense individualism among the student body. Our non-traditional city campus and lack of athletic success leave some students wanting more school spirit and community.
Much of the perceived shortage of school spirit at GW stems from our missing football team – a source of exuberant crowds and flashes of school colors at other colleges. Dating back to 1967, the termination of GW’s football program drained much of the school spirit that the University could ever muster from its sports. When people think about school spirit in the traditional sense, they often think of tailgates, huge marching bands and, most importantly, football games. But restarting the football program would be an extremely costly and long endeavor, especially in the DMV, where viable venues are few and far between. 
But GW still shows school pride at other sports events that students should view as equally as important. If you have attended a GW men’s basketball home opener at the Smith Center, then you know what it’s like to see the pride and energy of the student body. Student organizations like George’s Army rally massive amounts of energy through the stands of the Smith Center at basketball games with flashy costumes and cheers that bounce off the bleachers. The constant booming chants coming from George’s Army, their funny signs and jeers against the opposing team create an infectious atmosphere with a palpable sense of school spirit. 
And now that in-person classes have been back for more than a year, my friends and I feel more welcoming and outgoing than ever. Before the pandemic, we felt that students at GW were less interested in getting to know other people or reaching out. But GW has found a renewed sense of school spirit with students desperate to make up for lost time on the heels of the pandemic. The year of online classes and isolation has created a sense of necessity for our GW community. 
Students looking for an everyday solution to the so-called school spirit void need to only look as far as the surrounding campus culture and the array of student organizations. Get involved and you’ll find that school spirit at GW. For me, that meant joining the GW Rugby Club. The decision delivered an incredible and rewarding experience where I could represent the Buff and Blue against local rivals, like Georgetown, American and Catholic universities. The competition was one perk, but I stayed for the camaraderie that I found with the friends I made on the team. Playing for the University gave me a sense of pride and spirit that I needed. I wasn’t rooting just for the school, but I was rooting for myself and my teammates.
Above all, the collective passion for social and political change defines the true school spirit that shines at GW uniquely and pulled me to enroll here in the first place. When I transferred to GW in 2020, the students whom I first met were proud that GW was such a politically active campus. Many students throughout the school year join in the protests in the D.C. area at key moments in history, like Black Lives Matter rallies or the overturn of Roe v. Wade. Several student organizations grounded in activism on campus build their own community through advocacy for crucial causes on campus, like racial justice, D.C. statehood, sustainability, reproductive rights and gender equity. Dozens of student organizations like the Model United Nations team, theater troupes, cultural dance teams or comedy groups have helped many people find their niche here at GW with a tight circle to call their family away from home.
Your community is here at GW. Go to a basketball game with your roommates and cheer at the top of your lungs. Celebrate the fall harvest at GW Apple Day or welcome the spring bloom at the Mount Vernon Campus for Fountain Day, just to name a few University traditions. Maybe attend an info session of a club where your classmates are members. School spirit is more than a football team, a loud booming band at a stadium or tailgates – it is the community you foster here.
Who knows, maybe one day when we are all alumni, we will see the Buff and Blue return to the football field and feel that traditional school spirit we hunger for. But until then, there are plenty of other ways to show school spirit. Join that student organization or start a club. Rub the ears of the River Horse for good luck before your next test. School spirit is what you make of it.

The list of nominees, unveiled in July exactly two months before the awards show, has generated both excitement and controversy.
With the 74th Primetime Emmy Awards rapidly approaching Monday, critics and fans alike are speculating who will come out on top in stacked, star-studded categories filled with big names like Zendaya, Reese Witherspoon and Sandra Oh.
The list of nominees, unveiled in July exactly two months before the awards show, has generated both excitement and controversy. Because multiple acclaimed series like “Ozark” and “Killing Eve” are in their final seasons this year, the pressure is on for all of the Academy’s favorite shows and actors to receive their rightful recognition – but snubs will be inevitable with many of these series up against one another.
We’ve narrowed down our top picks and predictions in major categories to highlight the shows and performances we think stood out from the pack.
Outstanding Drama Series:
Top Pick: “Euphoria” (HBO)
Sam Levinson’s autobiographical hit series returned last winter for its highly anticipated and long-awaited second season – aside from two standalone episodes released in December 2020 and January 2021, loyal viewers have been longing for more of the popular series since Season 1 aired in summer 2019.
Season 2 did not disappoint, taking the world by storm – it was essentially impossible to scroll through Twitter from 9 to 10 p.m. on a Sunday night without a Euphoria-filled timeline. Fans almost always watched live, bringing back the lost art of weekly episodes in a new world of streaming and binge-watching. Impeccable acting performances from Zendaya, Hunter Schafer and Sydney Sweeney paired with hard-hitting storylines made Euphoria’s Season 2 a memorable one, overall deserving of a win.
Prediction: “Euphoria” (HBO)
2022 is clearly the year of “Euphoria” – not only is the series itself nominated, but Zendaya and Sweeney are each nominated for Lead Actress and Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, respectively. Zendaya took home the same award in 2020 for the show’s first season, making history as the youngest ever to win in the category. While it is unlikely that the Academy will give her the award twice in a row, there is most certainly hope for the show itself, given its historic and record-breaking year in addition to the Academy’s affinity for HBO shows.
Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series:
Top Pick: Reese Witherspoon (“The Morning Show”)
Reese Witherspoon’s recent television performances, particularly in Season 2 of “The Morning Show,” are severely underrated in comparison to her film career. Witherspoon shines as Bradley Jackson, a local journalist thrust into the spotlight, aided by her new scene partner Julianna Margulies. This season, her character deals with familial addiction, a coming-out storyline and a newfound level of power, all of which create a career-defining performance for Witherspoon.
Since 2016, Witherspoon has starred in and produced three television series simultaneously – “Big Little Lies,” “Little Fires Everywhere” and “The Morning Show” – under her production company Hello Sunshine. Witherspoon has yet to win an Emmy for her acting work in television, despite being nominated for all three of her recent series. This track record in addition to incredibly tough competition does not bode well for Witherspoon this year, no matter how deserving she may be.
Prediction: Sandra Oh (“Killing Eve”)
Acclaimed actor Sandra Oh made a name for herself with five Emmy nominations for her role as Cristina Yang on Shonda Rhimes’ “Grey’s Anatomy.” But after departing the show in 2014, Oh achieved something few Grey’s alumni could find following their departures – even more success. In her titular role in BBC’s “Killing Eve,” Oh received much critical acclaim, earning back-to-back Emmy nominations for her portrayal of Eve Polastri in all four seasons of the series and two nominations for executive producing the show.
While critics have showered her in immense praise for her role in “Killing Eve,” Oh has yet to take home an Emmy for the series. With her luck and the Television Academy’s clear affinity for her, she just might bring home the win for the show’s final season – that is if “Ozark” star Laura Linney, also finishing a successful final season, doesn’t beat her to it.
Outstanding Limited Series:
Top Pick: “The Dropout” (Hulu)
A critically acclaimed performance from Amanda Seyfried combined with stellar writing places “The Dropout” among the most memorable limited series of the year. The fascinating story of infamous Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes has been told through media in countless ways, beginning with the popular 2019 HBO documentary “The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley.” But no storytelling was as riveting as Seyfried’s surprising portrayal of Holmes, somehow simultaneously humanizing and vilifying the fraudulent figure.
Prediction: “The Dropout” (Hulu)
Seyfried has received an abundance of acclaim for her transformative and career-defining portrayal of Holmes – so much so that this series is sure to come out on top, especially considering many of its competitors overwhelmingly fell short this year. “Inventing Anna” features a similar, based-on-a-true-story take on a controversial blonde protagonist-villain, yet ultimately falls short in the places where “The Dropout” shines.
Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie:
Top Pick: Sarah Paulson (“Impeachment: American Crime Story”)
Ryan Murphy’s third installment of his “American Crime Story” series was long-anticipated after its two-year COVID hiatus, and with good reason. This season outdid both of its predecessors, “The People v. OJ Simpson” and “The Assassination of Gianni Versace,” two extremely tough acts to follow.
Sarah Paulson, who plays the fascinating role of Linda Tripp, the woman responsible for leaking her personal phone calls with Monica Lewinsky detailing her affair with former President Bill Clinton, is the absolute cherry on top of this incredible ensemble. She was nothing short of remarkable in this role – it is truly difficult to determine where Tripp ends and Paulson begins. The two women appear one and the same, essential for a series re-examining a public sex scandal through the lens of the women involved.
Prediction: Sarah Paulson (“Impeachment: American Crime Story”)
The Television Academy has a clear fondness for Paulson – not only has she received eight nominations for her work, but she also won her first Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series Or Movie for her portrayal of Marcia Clark in “The People v. OJ Simpson.” If this trend continues, Paulson is a shoo-in for this award. Paulson has a natural talent that forces viewers to re-examine the controversial women at the center of public scandals, and this role is no exception.

Cordelia Scales, the former executive chief of staff for the SA, filed a complaint last week alleging Zidouemba is not the legitimate president of the SA after the executive cabinet voted to remove him from office in July.
Former Executive Chief of Staff Cordelia Scales said Student Association President Christian Zidouemba and his defense misinterpreted the SA Constitution in her Tuesday response to the defense’s statement.
Scales called for the court to reject Zidouemba’s motion to dismiss the case and asks the court to schedule a full hearing to address the complaint in her reply to the defense’s Saturday statement. Scales’ reply to Zidouemba comes after the Student Court announced Wednesday that Scales submitted a complaint alleging Zidouemba is not the legitimate president of the SA and that she should be reappointed to the chief of staff position after the vote to remove Zidouemba from office in July was reversed.
Dylan Basescu – the former legislator general, who also was terminated and subsequently resigned after the July power struggle –  wrote that according to the wording of Article 15 of the SA Constitution, if the executive cabinet determines the president is permanently unfit to hold the office, the executive cabinet holds the power to remove them.
The defendants argued in their response that all individuals holding the titles specified in Article 15 of the SA Constitution – which include the chief of staff, communications director, vice president, treasurer and legislator general – had to be present and vote for removal for the invocation of Article 15 to be valid. Keanu Rowe, one of the two chiefs of staff, was not present for the July removal vote, but all the title holders specified in Article 15 – including Scales, one of the chiefs of staff – voted for Zidouemba’s removal.
“This court should deny the defendant’s motion to dismiss the plaintiff’s complaint with prejudice because the defendant’s central arguments are either misguided, unsubstantiated or incomplete,” Scales’s response states.
Zidouemba’s defense asks the court to declare Zidouemba as the rightful president and affirm that Scales is not an executive chief of staff.
The court met Sunday to consider the case. It will release an order on whether it will hear on the case by Friday.
