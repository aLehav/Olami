The research team's grant will allow them to investigate memory T cells in animal models, but the research could have implications for humans too. 
A team of researchers received a $1 million grant late last month to study how memory cells recall past events when responding to attacks on the immune system and injuries on the skin.
The project’s lead researchers said the team is looking into how memory T cells can memorize certain events, like an attack from a virus, and recall that memory once those events appear a second time. Rong Li, the chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine in the School of Medicine and Health Sciences and the lead researcher on the project, said the team hopes to learn the molecular process these memory cells use to recall past events and to eventually mimic this process in treatments like cancer therapies and inflammation care.
“That phenomena has been around for quite some time,” Li said. “But really, at the molecular level, at the cellular level, you ask really the fundamental question, ‘In that case, how did cells remember that?’ That is really what this grant is about.”
Li said the three-year grant from the W.M. Keck Foundation is exclusively for pre-clinical work, meaning the funds will cover the investigation of animal models and molecular tools. But he said if his research team is successful at working with the animal models, their findings could be applied to humans.
“It would be very interesting to, for example, take human memory T cells from cancer patients, culture them in a laboratory setting and then introduce this human version of that key molecule back into those memory T cells and then put them back in the same cancer patient and see whether that can boost the host’s immune system to fight tumors,” Li said. “We are very excited about the long-term potential.”
Li said the key to this research is the “different expertise” of each member of the research team.
He said he comes from the molecular biology perspective, while Brett Shook, an assistant professor of biochemistry and molecular medicine, is looking at this research through a physiology lens, including the healing of skin cell wounds and inflammation. He said other contributing researchers are helping with the immunological side of the research.
Shook said the team is applying an irritant to mice’s  skin and then will “precisely manipulate” one gene at a time to determine the effect it has on memory. He said they can use tools in their lab to express a gene at a higher level than it’s typically expressed to try to emphasize a memory in certain cells, or they can eliminate the gene of interest entirely, completely disrupting the cell’s ability to remember any previous events.
Shook said the researchers are using these mice models to observe skin inflammation to determine how the memory cells respond.
He said they first apply an irritant to mice’s skin, which will cause inflammation in the tissue and eventually a rash. The researchers then manipulate the specific gene in the mice, which they believe controls the skin cells’ memory of the inflammation, and then reapply the irritant to determine whether the memory cells can recall the event and eliminate the rash more quickly.
“Anytime you have a rash, that area now has some memory of inflammation,” Brett said. “We are able to injure the same area, and what has been documented is that regions of skin that have previously experienced inflammation will heal faster.”
Experts in medicine and infectious diseases said this research is a relatively unexplored area and the findings could pave the way for enhanced cancer treatments.
Joaquin Madrenas, a professor of medicine at UCLA, said the implications of this research are “very important,” especially in terms of immunological memory. He said vaccines give the immune system exposure to foreign antigens so that upon exposure, the immune system can mount a memory response.
“If we know what is the mechanism to induce memory, you can make better vaccines that will ensure the development of long lasting memory,” Madrenas said.
Madrenas said studying cellular memory may also help cancer patients, especially those with types of cancer associated with a lack in immune response.
“If you know the mechanisms of memory, you can induce memory in the immune system of a patient that can then get rid of the cancer and keep the cancer from growing,” Madrenas said.
He said laboratory mice are inbred animals that are kept under clean conditions and should have no history of exposure to infections, making the task of translating the research findings to humans complicated.
“We live in a completely exposed and uncontrolled environment,” Madrenas said. “Each one of us has a completely different antigen history. Your exposure to different viruses and bacteria and other infectious diseases is very different from mine, so the ability to manipulate your memory pool may be very different from mice.”
Girish Kirimanjeswara, a professor of immunology and infectious diseases at Pennsylvania State University, said studying memory cells allow researchers to understand how the body encounters and responds to infectious diseases. He said this area of research is “relatively less explored” and this project could pave the way for a deeper understanding of how immune cells can recall a past exposure to a virus or cancer.
“While we know how memory T cells may recognize a second encounter of a foreign substance, we are still learning about how these cells may be regulated, how long can they last, how do they function at various times etc,” he said in an email. “This research will explore many of those areas and also study the inherent cellular memory.”

The Colonials' resounding 68–39 victory over the George Mason Patriots this season marked the largest A-10 win since the Colonials routed the Patriots by 31 points in 2017. 
After starting Atlantic 10 play with just one victory in its first 10 games, women’s basketball ended its A-10 slate with four straight wins ahead of the conference tournament.
The Colonials (8-13, 5-9 A-10) secured a No. 11 A-10 tournament playoff berth, three places lower than the squad’s seeding last year, for a date with No. 14 George Mason Wednesday. GW routed its last four conference opponents, winning each of their games by 15-plus points, firing at a 45.7 percent clip and holding opponents to just 41.8 points per game in that time frame.
“It’s just been nice to have a little bit more of a balanced scoring attack on the offensive end, but we’ve definitely taken the most strides on the defensive end,” head coach Jennifer Rizzotti said after the team’s regular season finale against Fordham Thursday.
The Colonials tallied a 3-4 nonconference record, winning their first two games over Lincoln and Old Dominion before hitting a three-game slide and capping the regular season with a loss to Fordham.
A comeback victory over Delaware sent the squad into conference play on a positive note. But GW initially struggled in conference play, opening the season with a loss to Davidson Jan. 1.
Redshirt junior guard Gabby Nikitinaite became eligible at the start of the A-10 slate. After averaging 3.3 points per contest in her first four games, Nikitinaite found her stride as the season closed, averaging 11 points an outing in her final four games.
The team went on to lose against No. 1 and No. 2-seeded Dayton and Fordham, respectively. The program struggled to score from the three-point line in its first nine games, going 23-of-127 from distance.
The Colonials captured their first win of conference play against George Mason Jan. 17 in a resounding 67–47 victory.
The team would not find its way back into the win column until Feb. 12 against Duquesne. In the monthlong span in between, the Colonials dropped five straight games and then postponed two games after a member of the team tested positive for COVID-19.
The squad came back from its brief five-day pause refreshed, and its offense took on a new life, averaging 61.5 points – 7.8 points more than its 53.7 points per game average in its previous 10 A-10 matchups. In the team’s last five games of the season, the squad connected on 40 percent of its attempted triples.
“There have been good days, there have been bad days, but overall we’ve been climbing slowly,” Nikitnaite said after the team’s win over George Mason Feb. 28. “We still haven’t achieved all. We can get to higher places, but we’re taking it day by day, and I know we can be better every day.”
During the team’s four-game win streak, the Colonials dominated their second matchup against the Patriots, marking the largest A-10 win since an 80–49 victory over George Mason in 2017. The Colonials bullied the Patriots defensively, forcing 24 turnovers to score an additional 26 points to cap their largest win of the season 68–39.
“We’re going to take one game at a time,” Rizzotti said. “We expect there to be a fight against George Mason. We understand that it doesn’t matter what’s happened in the past. Every game is different now.”
The Colonials are heading into the tournament off a four game conference win streak, but they endured a nonconference 48–43 loss to Fordham Thursday. Rizzotti said redshirt sophomore forward Mayowa Taiwo was the “common denominator” for the team’s strides this season, like holding Fordham to a season-low 48 points and allowing just four three-point buckets to a team that averages nine per game.
Taiwo suffered a lower body injury in the team’s first meeting with George Mason, missing all five games during the team’s skid. She returned to the court, and the squad has won all but one game with her in the starting five.
In the stretch of five games Taiwo missed, the Colonials allowed 62.8 points a game on 42.9 percent shooting from the floor. Since Taiwo’s return, the Colonials have allowed 41.8 points a game on 32.4 percent from the field.
In addition to Taiwo, freshman center Ali Brigham emerged as a threat in the post, scoring 12 points per game on 50.7 percent shooting on the season. Graduate student guard Jasmine Whitney and redshirt junior forward Neila Luma sit No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, on the team in minutes per game and are the only two players to start all 21 games.
Whitney tallied 100 assists for the fourth time in her career and nabbed 61 steals as she led the offense. Luma rips a team-leading 6.3 boards a contest and averages 8.2 points.
“It’s win or go home,” Luma said after the game against Fordham. “We’re all pretty much feeling that heading in these games are really important. And we’re going to need to be sharp and to carry everything that we’ve learned into these games because we want to win.”
With two victories already in the books, the Colonials will look to complete the trifecta over No. 14 George Mason. Tipoff is slated for 4 p.m. in Richmond.

For many workers in the District, navigating overloaded state unemployment insurance systems proved to be a difficult task. 
When the COVID-19 pandemic first reached the District, businesses scrambled for support.
Many businesses laid off workers, while others closed temporarily and applied for government assistance. But those same issues are continuing to plague local businesses, as continued closures and delays in receiving financial benefits deepen workers’ struggles.
Sidney Lee | Graphics Editor
The District’s unemployment rate jumped to 7.3 percent during fiscal year 2020 after remaining at 5.6 percent the year before, as the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic prompted closures and layoffs across the city, according to last month’s report from the D.C. Office of the Chief Financial Officer. Unemployed workers in Foggy Bottom said they’ve struggled to obtain unemployment benefits and find new jobs in the area, citing a lack of District and federal government assistance.
Trupti Patel – a member of the Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission and lead D.C. organizer for One Fair Wage, a national nonprofit advocating for workers’ rights – said 150 to 200 Foggy Bottom workers are currently unemployed because of a lack of business demand to recruit workers. She said between 50,000 and 75,000 workers have been indefinitely laid off across D.C. in the hospitality industry, a sector accounting for 1,000 jobs in Foggy Bottom and the West End.
“It’s been tough,” Patel said. “People have felt embarrassed, humiliated and ashamed to talk about their plight to survive in an industry that has been part of the economic vitality of our commission.”
The CFO’s report states unemployment claims in the District have slightly dipped since August, down to about 65,000 in December after peaking in July at about 87,000. The hospitality, business services and education industries have been hardest hit by the economic effects of the pandemic, according to the report.
Laid off from her bartending job at the onset of the pandemic, Patel said her former employer operated with about 100 workers before the pandemic but currently only employs 20.
Patel said some workers were ineligible to receive unemployment benefits because of wage theft from employers’ incorrect fillings or wages they received from multiple states, disqualifying them from in-state benefits. She said the District’s failure to upgrade its IT infrastructure that operates the city’s unemployment system has worsened struggles for local workers.
Patel and other ANC members voted for the D.C. Department of Employment Services to reform its unemployment insurance system last May when the website was flooded with applications for benefits. She also helped fundraise more than $30,000 for unemployed restaurant workers last spring with the D.C. chapter of ROC United, an organization advocating for workers’ rights.
“What has been difficult is trying to get people help,” she said. “It’s the fact that we have not made information easily available and easily accessible in multiple languages, among multiple platforms.”
Patel said a lack of awareness has worsened the ongoing issue, and she’ll continue fighting to connect workers with their “rightfully entitled” unemployment benefits, like insurance, food stamps and Medicaid. She said the District should ensure people receive their benefits in “a timely fashion” to help them recover financially.
Patel called the application process for unemployment benefits “traumatizing” and “difficult,” citing low staffing and a failure to spread information across more languages and platforms.
“We have no empathy and no sympathy for anyone who has lost their job through no fault of their own, and we need to address this from a humanitarian aspect versus a utilitarian aspect, which is very cold and dehumanizing,” she said.
Patel said The River Inn and Melrose Georgetown Hotel in her district “drastically” reduced their staffs and closed their restaurants and bars because of the pandemic. She said five to 10 staffers at each location lost their jobs, while local restaurants lost their clientele base.
“Just in my single-member district alone, we could be facing empty storefronts, empty hotels if this continues to be a pervasive problem,” she said.
John Kilker, a former full-time bartender at Cafe Deluxe, said losing his job last March was “shocking,” and he later “briefly” worked as a pollster for the AFL-CIO from mid-September to Election Day. He said he currently has enough savings for basic necessities like meals but has experienced three-week delays in receiving his unemployment relief from the federal government since September.
“When I initially called unemployment to file, it took me several days to reach anybody, and I just kept my phone next to me with the speaker on and stayed like that for eight hours a day and no one picked up,” he said.
Kilker said he didn’t earn enough money from his job working as a pollster in Virginia to be eligible to receive federally granted benefits.
“I reached out to one person who was helpful,” he said. “He pointed me in the right direction. Once I got there though, the next person wasn’t as receptive.”
Kilker said finding a new job feels like walking “between safety and financial security” because of the pandemic. He said he hopes for a more “efficient” unemployment system to be “proactive” in maintaining technical operations once the pandemic is over.
“When we get out of this pandemic, we get out of our current situation, we have to look and be proactive instead of just being reactive, because I think what we’ve seen is that when we react, when the situation’s present, there’s not enough time,” he said. “And then the people are the ones who are really going to suffer.”
A former restaurant waitress, who requested anonymity for future employment reasons, said she was laid off last March following the virus outbreak and has remained without a job for nearly a year. She said a family member and a friend passed away during the pandemic, adding to the emotional toll of the past year.
The worker said she’s since struggled to maintain financial security while trying to find a new job and pay off her debts.
She said she waited for 26 weeks of unemployment to receive her first benefits but never received help from the Virginia unemployment office. She said she made several attempts to contact the office in the past three months about the lack of assistance.
“It’s hard too,” she said. “You can speak to nobody. It’s only sit or call back right now. If customer service is busy, call back again.”

Now that mask orders, restaurant closures and social distancing are the norm, even mundane experiences like grabbing lunch with some friends are nostalgic to reflect on.
During her last few days on campus last March, then-sophomore Cece Michalowski went on one last monument walk with friends from her theater company.
Michalowski said she walked around the National Mall for three hours with some of her closest friends from 14th Grade Players, most of whom were graduating seniors at the time, and sat together at the backside of the Lincoln Memorial. The next day, she had a picnic under the magnolias and the cherry blossoms at the George Mason Memorial. 
“It was really just a magical last few moments, really solidified some really great memories to keep me going through the rest of quarantine,” Michalowski said. “I still look at the photos I have from that night every once in a while when I’m really sad to just remember how good and innocent we all were back then when we thought we’d be back.”
Michalowski is one of four students who recounted their last fond memories in D.C. before packing up their rooms and heading home for the rest of the academic year. The students said their last recollection of an in-person college experience involved eating in bustling restaurants, sitting outside in Kogan Plaza as the days warmed up and walking around the National Mall with friends.
Bella Courchesne, a junior majoring in political communication, said she sat with her friends on a picnic blanket in Kogan Plaza doing homework, drinking lemonade and eating fried dough from a nearby food truck the week before spring break. She said her internship at Hill TV had taken up most of her free time that semester, and she had more time off that week to catch up with friends.
“It was one of those really fun times when GW actually all comes together and every single person is outside on campus at the same time,” she said. “Obviously it doesn’t happen very often at GW, but everyone was in Kogan that day.”
Dylan Basescu, a senior majoring in physics and political science, said last year on Valentine’s Day he surprised his girlfriend, senior Eleanor Paul, by taking her out to eat her favorite type of food at Pho 14, a Vietnamese restaurant in Mount Pleasant. He said it was the last dinner they’d have together before the pandemic hit – Basescu went back to New York and Paul went to California to quarantine.
“We didn’t know if we’d see each other again, and we still haven’t seen each other in coming up on a year, which really sucks,” he said. “I really miss her because being apart has been a very big strain on our relationship.”
He said while in the following weeks the virus would prove to be an increasingly “serious” issue, the date was one of the last times that he didn’t have to worry about the virus.
“I was not forecasting the degree of devastation that it would have on the country,” he said. “So it was, that was roughly around the last time that I wasn’t thinking about it.”
Rebecca Radillo, a senior from Huntington Beach, California, said she was directing a production of “Julius Caesar” with the GW Shakespeare Company in the weeks leading up to the transition online. She said a friend of hers from out of town visited the University to take a photoshoot of the cast for the show’s posters, and she took her friend to see another Shakespeare show, “Macbeth,” premiering the last weekend of February. 
That was the last show they were able to put on before leaving campus, and Radillo’s production of “Julius Caesar” was canceled, she said.
“Seeing the show, it was really, really fun just because live theater is always fun,” she said. “And it’s one of the things that I miss the most, getting to go see shows a couple times a month, just because there were four theater companies at GW, and I saw almost all of their shows all the semesters I was there.”
Radillo added that she showed her friend around Smithsonian museums, walked around the District and enjoyed a meal out that weekend.
“In a strange way, I knew then that I had to savor that weekend as much as possible, because I knew that there was never going to be another one like it,” Radillo said.

During the pandemic, it seemed like a different TV show each month commanded the attention of everyone online. 
One year ago on Wednesday, officials announced that classes would be held online for two weeks after spring break.
Then, administrators said classes would be held remotely for the rest of the spring semester. Two major announcements followed in the next year: The fall and spring semesters would also be held online. 
Since then, students spread out across the globe have picked up new ways to trudge through the pandemic, be it by endless scrolling on TikTok or picking up new baking recipes. From the debut of “Tiger King” to a virtual Coachella concert, take a look down memory lane at all of the ways we’ve found some good news in a lot of dark days.
Cooking trends
To fill open schedules, avoid grocery store runs and try some new recipes, many turned to baking in the early months of quarantine. Sourdough starters left local grocery stores perpetually out of yeast last spring. Focaccia bread was elevated with intricate floral designs made of tomatoes and herbs. Pasta recipes like penne alla vodka and feta pasta went viral on TikTok, and mug cakes and banana bread became some of the most searched recipes. 
The rise of TikTok
On top of infiltrating food trends, TikTok exploded as one of the most popular social media platforms for college-aged students. When TikTok user Nathan Apodaca went viral for his video skateboarding while drinking Ocean Spray and singing along to Fleetwood Mac’s “Dreams,” the video received more than 41 million views and was replicated by everyone, including Mick Fleetwood himself. His video also prompted “Dreams” to reenter the Billboard Hot 100 after 43 years and No. 1 on Apple Music. Apodaca’s video impacted his own life – Ocean Spray, the brand of cranberry juice he had been drinking, purchased him a truck to replace the one that had broken prior to filming his viral video. 
Virtual concerts 
As world tours, festivals and concerts were postponed, artists found a new venue in social media. Diplo hosted his “Corona World Tour,” with multi-weekly streams of his sets on platforms like Twitch and YouTube. In March, the Dropkick Murphys hosted “Streaming Up From Boston” on St. Patrick’s Day in place of its usual live show. In April, Post Malone streamed an hourlong Nirvana tribute from his home where he sang Nirvana songs with Blink-182’s Travis Barker on drums. In October, YouTube hosted a virtual festival in support of “Save Our Stages,” a fundraiser that worked to pass the legislation that would allocate $15 billion to independent music venues and employees struggling through the pandemic. The lineup featured more than 35 artists including G-Eazy, the Foo Fighters and the Black Pumas. 
Trending shows
We’ve all had our fair share of time in front of our screens this quarantine, and a lot of that time has been dedicated to binge-watching movies and TV shows. The number of Netflix subscribers soared since last spring, and viewers blew up Netflix Original series like “Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness,” “Outer Banks” and “The Crown.” Hulu subscribers binged “Little Fires Everywhere” and “Euphoria” while Disney+ subscribers geeked out over “The Mandalorian” original series.
Mock graduations 
When in-person graduations were ruled out last year, most colleges and universities moved their festivities online. High schools across the country held online ceremonies, socially distanced outdoor events and car parades where graduates received their diplomas through rolled-down windows. GW graduates also had graduation festivities at home to celebrate.
In an effort to prop up the graduates, celebrities and other influential figures worked together to produce televised graduation specials like “Graduate Together: America Honors the High School Class of 2020” created by LeBron James. The videos featured public figures like former President Barack Obama, Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai and U.S. soccer player Megan Rapinoe, who delivered uplifting words of wisdom and advice to graduates.  
‘Some Good News’
It has been difficult to find good news over the past year, but actor John Krasinski found a way to offer people a bright spot. In March, he launched the news network “Some Good News,” where he streamed entertaining home videos sent in by viewers, shared stories of triumph and hosted famous guests for a healthy dose of comic relief. 
Fashion
As much as baking dominated the start of quarantine, other creative trends continued to circulate social media and kept professional and first-time artists occupied. Knitting became a particularly popular trend after singer Harry Styles’ JW Anderson cardigan went viral. TikTok users began posting their renditions of the cardigan, and the trend’s hashtag garnered more than 41 million views. Jonathan Anderson, the original designer of Styles’ cardigan, responded to the trend by posting the patterns for public use as well as a detailed tutorial on how he made the garment. Following its internet fame, Styles’ original cardigan was donated to London’s Victoria and Albert Museum. Following his December debut as the first man on the cover of Vogue, and in a dress no less, Styles contributed to the social movement of blurring gender lines in fashion. 
The fashion world, like many other industries, needed to drum up innovative ways to carry out long-standing traditions, which in their case meant Fashion week. Paris Fashion Week, which took place in January of this year, was forced to online because of continuing pandemic concerns in Europe. The Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, the French fashion industry’s governing body, instructed fashion houses that runways could be held with models, provided they were closed to the public. Many fashion houses broadcasted their shows, while others took advantage of the digital format to try something new.

While the pandemic forced the postponement of most major sporting events, by the end of the year, many leagues had prevailed after a season of enacting COVID-19 safety precautions. In February, 25,000 fans joined 30,000 cardboard cutouts of fans for Super Bowl LV between Tampa Bay and Kansas City. 
The NBA successfully created a bubble for its players and staff as they completed the 2019 season and throughout the 2020 season. The participants isolated themselves at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando Florida beginning  July 6 in anticipation of the season’s July 30th start. Rules for those quarantined were kept extremely strict with an enforced no-guest policy, monitored schedules and even disposing of card decks following their use in card games. In conjunction with the live games, the NBA created a virtual audience experience in collaboration with Microsoft that allowed fans to be projected inside the arenas and even cut to by the cameras on the broadcast.

Remote working at NASA's headquarters meant alumni watched live and celebrated their work on NASA's Perseverance rover with friends and family at home. 
Alumnus George Tahu watched from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California last month as the Perseverance rover completed its 300-million-mile journey to Mars.
Tahu said he was responsible for setting objectives and constraints needed to keep the project on schedule while also reducing costs and risks of the project. The rover, which weighs more than 2,000 pounds and traveled through space for seven months, landed on the surface of Mars on Feb. 18, culminating nine years of planning and research.
Tahu, the program executive of the Mars 2020 mission who earned two master’s degrees from the University, is one of at least four GW students and alumni working on the newest Mars rover as a part of the project. Others who have worked on the mission said they contributed by collecting meteorological data or serving as engineers.
NASA was unable to open its doors to guests for celebrations of the Mars mission because of COVID-19 restrictions, but Tahu said he was still able to watch the landing live at JPL and celebrate with teammates while respecting safety protocols in person.
“It was really an incredible day to be watching the team, knowing everything they’ve done over the past eight years and all the many obstacles that they overcame,” Tahu said. “Once you hear that touchdown confirmed, everybody’s got their hands up in a victory.”
Tahu said one of the main goals of the Mars 2020 campaign is to begin an effort to return Martian rock samples to Earth, which will be studied for evidence of past microbial life on the planet and to learn how rocky planets like Mars form. He said the Perseverance rover sets the stage for a Mars sample return project, with cooperation from the European Space Agency, that may happen as soon as 2026.
The Perseverance rover’s payload contains a weather tool called the Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer, which could provide information to help enable future human exploration of Mars, Tahu said.
The Mars 2020 mission first came under consideration after a 2011 survey of the international scientific community found that scientists believed that a deeper analysis of Mars rocks via a sample return program should be a top priority for NASA, Tahu said. NASA announced the project in December 2012, and Tahu has worked on it since then.
Tahu said he hopes Perseverance excites the public for future NASA missions. He said he has been excited to see an outpouring of hope from the public and from officials, including in a video call with President Joe Biden and the Perseverance team at the JPL.
“This is an example of what humanity can do when we come together on a focused goal,” Tahu said. “I certainly hope that what the Perseverance team has done, and in the way they did it, particularly in the environment over the past year, can serve as that inspiring arc and give hope.”
Mariah Baker, a first-year graduate student studying in the Space Policy Institute in the Elliott School of International Affairs and a postdoctoral fellow with the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum, said she was unable to be at the JPL for the landing of the Perseverance, but she still celebrated at home with her mother and virtually with her teammates.
“It was a crazy day, so I almost didn’t even get a moment to breathe,” Baker said. “There were a lot of different media things going on, different team meetings that were being held virtually and press briefings.”
Baker’s work, which focuses on the wind-driven movement of sand and dust on Mars, began after the landing of the rover. She said the research coming from Perseverance could play a role in future missions because of the potential effects the sand and dust may have on energy and weather on Mars.
Baker said she primarily uses images and meteorological data to study wind-driven processes happening on the surface and will present results to the Perseverance team.
She said her work may also help plan projects that will put humans on Mars, as unpredictable movements of sand or dust have doomed Mars missions in the past, including a dust storm that disabled the Opportunity rover’s ability to recharge its batteries.
“Wind-driven movement of sand and dust plays an important role in Mars’ geology and climate, but it can also pose risks to spacecraft and astronauts on the surface,” Baker said. “The Opportunity rover’s mission came to an end because of a global dust storm, so understanding these events is going to be crucial for keeping instrumentation and human explorers safe during future Mars missions.”
Baker, who has worked on two other Mars rovers with NASA, said she’s taking classes at the Space Policy Institute, which conducts research and offers courses on space policy, to expand her opportunities within the field.
“I’m really more interested in being in the programmatic side of things and being behind the space missions,” Baker said. “I thought that getting a better understanding of other sides of the industry, the economics and all of that, would be useful for moving forward and expanding my understanding of the field as a whole.”
Leila Meshkat, a senior engineer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and an alumna, also worked on the project as an engineer on the mission control system. She said the mission control system “conducts processing, channelization and visualization” of data from the spacecraft before delivering the information to the ground system at NASA sites for analysis and planning.
Meshkat said she developed software with the mission control team and assisted with data management for ground operations.
After finishing her master’s degree in operations research at GW, she said she earned her doctorate in systems engineering from the University of Virginia and began working at JPL in 2002. She said her systems engineering background led to her being assigned to work on the Mars 2020 mission, which she said is “pivotal” for the future of space exploration.
NASA also plans to test new equipment on Mars like the Ingenuity, a small helicopter that NASA will attempt to fly this spring.
“This is the first time ever that there’s going to be a helicopter flying on a different planet, so that’s a technology demonstration to demonstrate that it’s possible to do something like that,” Meshkat said.

Most of GW's online programs moved only slightly in rankings last year. 
With thousands of students learning through online classes during the COVID-19 pandemic, GW’s online programs held steady in their rankings in U.S. News and World Report earlier this semester.
The ranking placed the School of Nursing’s online master’s in nursing program seventh, the School of Engineering and Applied Science’s online master’s in engineering program 14th and the School of Business’s online master’s in business administration 20th nationwide. A majority of GW’s online programs saw slight improvements in their rankings this year, according to data provided by officials at the Office of Institutional Research and Planning.
“GW’s ranked online programs demonstrate our investment in virtual education and the dedication of the University’s faculty and staff in supporting and enhancing these programs,” Provost Brian Blake said in a University release. “We have gained valuable insight over the past several years of online education, particularly during the pandemic, and now are poised to embrace all the possibilities of academic innovation on the other side of COVID-19.”
Most of the online programs saw slight tweaks in their standing, with the online bachelor’s program increasing from 20th to 19th, the online MBA program from 22nd to 20th and the online master’s in engineering program from 15th to 14th.
Other programs saw some drops in their rankings, with the master’s in nursing program dropping from sixth to seventh and the master’s in education program having the most significant fall from 31st to 52nd, according to officials’ data. The education program ranked the lowest of all programs.
Others like the online master’s in non-MBA business programs were ranked around the middle of the pack compared to the rest of GW’s online programs at 24th.
Officials did not return a request for comment about the reasons for the changes in the rankings, whether they plan to expand and provide more support for online programs in the future and the implications that the rankings will have for the University.
Shahram Sarkani, the director of online and off-campus programs for SEAS and Engineering Management and Systems Engineering, said officials in the engineering school are “extremely proud” about the online master’s in engineering program reaching its highest ranking since about a decade ago, when it was ranked in the mid-60s. He said the achievement will help the program attract more “quality students” by raising the program’s profile.
“We believe, in the online stage, that the ranking is very significant because people aren’t bound geographically to go to the nearest college or university,” he said. “Actually, they can go anywhere in the nation or in the world for that matter.”
He said the program’s emphasis on assuring students have access to professors in an online environment, through strategies like frequent office hours and taped class sessions, has helped differentiate it from other universities’ programs that may not be using these techniques.
“A lot of universities just have lectures that play over and over like a horror movie so to speak,” he said. “But we made a conscious decision of offering live classes via the web so that students can actually ask professors live questions during class, listen in live and interact live with the professor and other students.”
He said SEAS officials reached out to him last spring to serve on a committee to help the engineering school’s initial transition to virtual instruction because of his experience with teaching online.
“We believe our experience and our program helped launch the rest of the school to successfully go online,” he said.
Sarkani said administrators for the program hope to reduce class sizes to no more than 20 per class from the current average of 30 to raise the University’s name recognition.
“Obviously, as you get closer to the top, it gets harder and harder to move up,” he said. “It’s getting tougher to move up, but our goal is to break into the top 10 in the near future.”
Experts in online education said online programs will likely play a greater role in higher education in the aftermath of the pandemic by boosting GW’s name recognition and providing students with a “valuable tool” to select high-quality programs.
Cassandra Ott-Kocon, the assistant director of online and transfer programs at the University of Arizona’s Eller College of Management, said online programs have seen “some growth” recently as many prospective students may be out of work or looking for career changes due to the pandemic.
She said the widespread transition to distance education over the past year has created new virtual resources that were previously unavailable to online programs, like electronic signature capabilities on online documents that speed up administrative requirements.
“There are processes being built to be long-term,” she said. “I don’t foresee, when things return to in person, that those tools will go away for our students.”
John Watret, the chancellor of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University Worldwide Campus, said officials can improve their online programs’ design by “treating online as a separate modality of delivery” since the learning style in online classes is different from in-person classes. Embry-Riddle has in-person campuses in Florida and Arizona but largely operates online.
“Many schools fail in providing quality online programs when they try to recreate their face-to-face course and then just publish some of the content online and expect it to be similar to that,” he said.
Watret said he expects more schools to invest in creating and supporting the “online arms of their institutions,” especially since traditional faculty now have experiences in teaching virtually.
“One of the big takeaways is that the use of technology in the classroom is going to increase, whether it be in a truly online course or whether it be in a traditional in-person course,” he said.
