Johnson left the position in 2014 to work on a project to improve educational and workplace conditions in a South African children’s hospital.
Officials announced the founding dean of the School of Nursing, Jean E. Johnson, will take charge of the school as interim dean.
Provost Christopher Bracey said in a release Monday that Johnson, the first dean of the nursing school, would return to the position “effective immediately.” The announcement comes after officials began the search for an interim dean for the nursing school in March after former Dean Mei Fu, the school’s third dean since July 2021, resigned two months into her tenure.
“From the beginning, Dr. Johnson has been a champion of nursing education at GW and an innovative and dedicated leader for students, faculty and staff,” Bracey said in the release. “Her vision of excellence for nursing education has been foundational for the school’s continued growth, and her experienced leadership will ensure it remains on a trajectory of success in its second decade.”
Former Dean Pamela Jeffries vacated the position in July 2021 after six years in the role to head the nursing school at Vanderbilt University. Following Jeffries’ departure, Pamela Slaven-Lee, the School of Nursing’s senior associate dean for academic affairs, led the school as an interim dean from July 2021 until January 2023, when Fu took over the position.
Bracey said at a Faculty Senate meeting in March that Forrest Maltzman, a professor of political science and the former provost, would oversee the nursing school and help appoint an interim dean while officials search for Fu’s permanent replacement.
Johnson, who served as dean from 2010 to 2014, originally left the position to work on a year-long project in collaboration with the University of Cape Town to improve educational and workplace conditions in a South African children’s hospital. Johnson returned to the nursing school as a faculty member in 2015 and has since held several positions, including interim executive director of GW’s Center for Health Policy and Media Engagement and president of the National Organization of Nurse Practitioner Faculties, the release states.
During her four-year tenure, Johnson received praise for including faculty in decision making processes, rallying faculty around the decision to move the school to the Virginia Science and Technology Campus and encouraging distance and simulation educational models within the school. During her tenure, Johnson doubled enrollment at the nursing school and created an accelerated bachelor’s degree program, according to the release.
“I am honored to serve as the interim dean of the School of Nursing,” Johnson said in the release. “The School of Nursing has made great progress since its inception, with many of the programs being ranked in the top 10 of the country and faculty research having a national impact on policy and patient care.”

After arriving at the University of Maryland, the GW Ballroom Dancing Team got dressed and prepared for the day ahead. 
When the first event began, screams of encouragement erupted from various members of the GW team. As more teammates joined in, the intensity of their screams morphed a presumably calm activity into a competition that was as fierce as the most cutthroat of sports. 
The GW teams’ high energy throughout the day captivated judges and other teams alike. By the end of the day, the team had traded their voices for ribbons, winning tens of events in various categories of the competition.
Check out these photos from the GW Ballroom Team’s competition from earlier this month:

About 2,500 donors donated during last year’s Giving Day. 
GW’s third annual Giving Day amassed more than $1 million for the second consecutive year but fell short of the $1.6 million raised last year.
The University received $1,282,437 in donations from Tuesday to Wednesday during its annual Giving Day – where officials try to fundraise as much money as they can in a 24-hour period – about $400,000 below last year’s $1.6 million total. The Columbian College of Arts & Sciences received $219,832 from a total of 425 donors – the largest total donation to one of the funding options – which the school will use to fund the Cisneros Hispanic Leadership Institute and Trachtenberg School of Public Policy and Public Administration’s Catalyst Fund.
A total of 3,193 donors gave a financial contribution to the University, the largest amount of donors that have donated to GW’s Giving Day, while also surpassing GW’s 2,750 donor goal. About 2,500 donors donated to last year’s Giving Day, and about 2,100 donors donated during the first Giving Day in 2021.
Daniel Burgner, the executive director of annual giving in the Division of Development and Alumni Relations, said the Giving Day advocates, donation promoters that have the chance to earn prizes and compete to win a grant that funds an area of their choosing, “secured” 450 donations and “pushed” to achieve the 2,750 donor goal.
“As a community, we surpassed the goal by over 400 donors!” Burgner said in a statement on the Giving Day website. “Thank you for making this day a victory for the Buff & Blue.”
Officials altered fundraising strategies this year, including shifting from a single, 24-hour day to a 24-hour event spread across two days and focusing on renewing donations from “loyal” donors that have submitted donations in prior years.
Students could donate at in-person events in Kogan Plaza, the Mount Vernon campus, the Milken Institute of Public Health, the School of Medicine and Health Sciences and the School of Nursing.
Donors were able to contribute a minimum of $5 through the online giving form to an area of their choice, including athletic teams or scholarships like the Elliott Equity Fund, which provides financial aid to students in the Elliott School of International Affairs who are from historically marginalized groups.

With more than 5,000 followers on Instagram and active engagement in numerous student organizations across campus, Kate Carpenter has emerged as one of the most prominent faces within the GW community.
Readers’ pick: @gwu_affirmations
Being an influencer in today’s world may only be a dream to most Gen Z students, but for senior Kate Carpenter, it’s her reality.
You might know Carpenter, a political communication major from Stillwater, Oklahoma, for her blue-and-white striped overalls dripping with school spirit at GW basketball games, her pun-filled Instagram captions or her list of achievements as vice president of the Student Association last year. With more than 5,000 followers on Instagram and active engagement in numerous student organizations across campus – from the Panhellenic Association to her self-founded festival celebrating school spirit GW Palooza – she has emerged as one of the most prominent faces within the GW community.
From her thrifting TikToks to aesthetic photos of her excursions on Instagram, Carpenter doesn’t restrict herself to any one type of lifestyle content. Carpenter said she lets go of “hesitations” or any “embarrassment” that restrains her from living her life to the fullest, an attitude her social media presence reflects.
“It’s basically an art form to me on social media, as funny as it sounds,” she said. “So I’ve loved being able to have an impact through that. I’ve really grown my influencer base and my impact since I’ve been at college.”
As of this winter, Carpenter turned her social media presence into a paid partnership to promote her passion. She said MtoM Consulting, a digital marketing agency based in Falls Church, Virginia, hired her through the athletics department to promote GW sports like basketball and baseball games to rally fan engagement for GW Athletics.
“Getting people to sports games and events and being able just to do a lot of things that I care about – it’s been a really special and unique experience for me to start using social media for that,” she said.
Carpenter’s social media skills have grown enormously on Instagram and TikTok, amassing around 2,000 more Instagram followers and more than 4,000 followers on TikTok throughout her time at GW. During her campaign for SA vice president in April 2021, while GW was fully online, social media was the only platform Carpenter had to make sure her voice was heard.
“My entire campaign was only based on social media, and that’s where I really got refined skills for social media, influencing and spreading the message because I had to,” she said. “If I wanted to be successful, I really needed to get the word out there.”
But Carpenter said she’s never considered herself an influencer. While she often does paid content for GW and other organizations, she said she sees her content as just putting her “exciting life” on display for her and other people to see.
With interests like photography and videography, social media gives Carpenter an outlet to share her work and free her “creative mind.” Her goal? To show people what it’s like to follow your passion.
“You can live this life that you’ve always dreamed of,” she said. “Don’t feel held back – just do things you’re passionate about.”

Keanu Rowe, who serves as chief of staff under SA President Christian Zidouemba, said his experience in the executive cabinet led him to create policies he thinks are “both attainable and completely feasible.”
Year: Junior
Major: Political science
Hometown: Honolulu, Hawaii
Student organizations/activities: Intramural basketball, Campus Living and Residential Education operations assistant
SA experience: Executive chief of staff
Favorite restaurant in the District: Le Diplomate
Your favorite “Only at GW” moment: Participating in the MLK Day of Service and Leadership with Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Marcia Fudge
Favorite class: Film Theory with Michael Shull
Go-to study spot: Sixth floor of Gelman Library
Role model: My father
Moniker choice: Blue Fog
Deli order: Bacon, egg and cheese on sourdough
Keanu Rowe looks to bring a sense of family from his hometown in Hawaii to the Student Association.
Rowe said improving students’ perception of the SA starts with “changing the culture,” and he hopes to replicate the sense of community prevalent where he grew up in Honolulu with the professional aspirations at GW embedded in D.C. He said as president, he plans to go to students directly and bolster the University’s sense of community through University-wide initiatives, like a field day and monthly community service opportunities in hopes of supporting and uniting the student body.
“My unique background being from an island in the Pacific Ocean has made me more community-oriented and community-minded because we’re all we have,” Rowe said. “I would like to apply this kind of mindset that has been instilled in me at a very young age to this office.”
Rowe, who serves as chief of staff under SA President Christian Zidouemba, said his experience in the executive cabinet led him to create policies he thinks are “both attainable and completely feasible.” He said his work as chief of staff was “at the discretion of the president,” and he regularly attended senate meetings and facilitated communication between senators and executive branch members.
“Connecting people has been a huge part of this position,” he said.
Rowe said he feels there is a general lack of school spirit across campus, which he hopes to bolster through events like his field day idea. Rowe said for the event, he would collaborate with Fraternity and Sorority Life and student organizations to plan activities like basketball, Spikeball and volleyball on green spaces around campus and inside the Lerner Health and Wellness Center.
“The main purpose of this is attracting as many students as possible through activities we all like,” Rowe said.
Rowe’s platform also includes enhancing safety infrastructure on campus, like the blue light system and SafeRide. He said while working with Zidouemba, he was able to work with GW Police Department Chief James Tate to discuss campus safety.
“One of the good things about Christian’s administration was regular meetings with GWPD Chief Tate, and I’d like to continue that great relationship,” he said.
Rowe said he plans to assess where the University could install new blue light phones to improve the range of the cross-campus system. The University had 39 blue light systems installed across campus in 2014 and added “several” in 2017.
“The most essential thing a University must provide is student safety, first and foremost,” he said.
He said he also hopes to improve the accuracy of estimated arrival times for SafeRides after hearing complaints from students about extended delays. The University expanded SafeRide to 2400 M Apartments, The Flats at Dupont Circle and the Lincoln Memorial in 2021 in response to advocacy from former SA Vice President Kate Carpenter.
“It’s been very spotty,” he said. “And they’ve been told one time, and it’s just been far, far off from that.”
He said he would seek additional revenue for the SA from external sources, like nonprofits, to fund student organizations and host monthly community service initiatives in the D.C. area.
“If you vote for Keanu, what you’re voting for is uniting a stronger campus and leading with accountability, responsibility and agency,” Rowe said.

Spanning 18 miles from George Washington's Mount Vernon Estate to Theodore Roosevelt Island, the trail takes outdoor adventurers through some of the most awe-inspiring landscapes the region has to offer.
Location: From George Washington’s Mount Vernon Estate to Theodore Roosevelt Island
Readers’ Pick: Rock Creek Park
When D.C.’s iconic monuments and historic buildings get old, take a breath of fresh air on any of the 18 miles of the picturesque Mount Vernon Trail.
From its breathtaking views of the Potomac River with the national monuments looming in the background to the convergence with several regional trail systems, including Potomac Heritage Trail, Four Mile Run and Rock Creek Park, there is no shortage of adventure to be had on the Mount Vernon Trail. Whether you are a seasoned hiker or a novice, the trail system offers easy-to-navigate terrain and diverse views sure to captivate your attention.
Spanning 18 miles from George Washington’s Mount Vernon Estate to Theodore Roosevelt Island, the trail takes outdoor adventurers through some of the most awe-inspiring landscapes the region has to offer. The trail is paved, making hiking, biking or running easy in comparison to more rocky trails.
The Mount Vernon Trail not only offers an outdoor experience but also serves as a gateway to the past. The trail follows the same path as the Potomac River, which was used to transport goods in the 18th century, including from Georgetown and Alexandria, Virginia to George Washington’s Mount Vernon home. Interpretive signs and markers dot the trail, highlighting the canal’s historical significance.
The Mount Vernon Trail is also conveniently located just minutes from the Foggy Bottom campus. A simple walk across the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge will lead you to the tail end of the trail on Theodore Roosevelt Island. Students can easily hop on the Blue or Yellow Metro lines from campus and head to the Arlington Cemetery, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport or Rosslyn Metro stations, which are all a short bike ride or walk away from the trail.
As spring brings warmer temperatures to the District, head down to picnic at Gravelly Point at mile 15 of the trail, get your sweat on with a long run or hop on a Capital Bikeshare and go for a ride along the expansive trail.
The next time you need a break from the city, be sure to explore the serene and historical beauty of the Mount Vernon Trail.

If the breakup is quick and easy, you and your ex still have time to play with the kittens after it’s over.
Location: 3109 M St.
Readers’ pick: Georgetown Waterfront steps
Starting to feel like your situationship is lasting a little too long fur your liking? Do you think meows the time to break it off? Have you been looking for the purrfect place to call your current relationship quits?
Look no further than the Georgetown cat cafe, Crumbs & Whiskers.
If you’re getting that gut feeling that your significant other is going to end things or you’ve recently discovered a new ick you can’t look past, initiate the breakup on your own terms at a spot where no one could be left feeling sour. Over the gentle meows and mewls of the cafe’s cats, the cozy atmosphere of Crumbs & Whiskers will cut the bitterness of a bad breakup.
A few days ahead of your intended breakup date, book yourself and your soon-to-be ex a 30- or 70-minute time slot ($25 to $40) to pet and play with the adorable and adoptable cats.
As you walk into the cafe, you’ll find an open space filled with purring cats, play toys and plenty of soft rugs for you, your partner and the cats to share. If you’re looking for a place to get comfy, head to the bed at the back of the cafe. If the bed is already taken by a couple building their relationship up instead of breaking it down or you’re looking to replicate that authentic bawling on-the-ground experience, pop a squat on one of the fuzzy floor rugs spread around the room. Once you’re settled in, let the cat out of the bag.
Breakups can be incredibly difficult conversations, leaving both the dumped and the dumpee feeling all scratched up. But at Crumbs & Whiskers, you won’t have to go through the pain alone – you’ll have dozens of furry friends surrounding you as your immediate emotional support.
If the breakup is quick and easy, you and your ex still have time to play with the kittens after it’s over. If your split goes bad, don’t fret – a snuggly cat in your lap will soothe you and your ex while you push through the tough conversation.
For a spoonful of sugar to help the breakup go down, savor some macarons ($3.50 each) or a cup of coffee ($3.85). Crumbs & Whiskers also supplies cat toys and treats so you can become best friends with your fur balls. While you might not want to remember a messy breakup, Crumbs & Whiskers does offer a free Polaroid picture with your cat of choice if you’d like a final memento before you part ways.
After an emotion-filled day at the cat cafe, you may have bonded so much with some of the kittens that you’ll have a hard time resisting the urge to adopt them by the end of your visit. Those crazy cat ladies might be onto something – a pretty kitty certainly beats a painful heartbreak.
