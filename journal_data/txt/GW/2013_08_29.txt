The University’s counseling office was in turmoil nearly a year and a half ago when its director stepped down amid accusations of mismanagement.
At the time, the University Counseling Center was plagued by incompetent leadership, and wait times for appointments sometimes lasted six weeks.
It was especially frightening that these services were at stake, given that about one in four people 18 years and older have diagnosable mental health problems – including anxiety and depression – according to the National Institute of Mental Health.
Leaving such a large number of students to fend for themselves is a discouraging prospect.
But with guidance and ideas from new director Silvio Weisner, as well as an infusion of cash from GW – about $200,000 extra over the last two years – the counseling center has made a series of positive strides, including plans announced this semester to hire two new counselors who specialize in veteran and international student issues.
It’s reassuring to see that after a bout of disorganization, the administration is directing sharper attention and more funding into essential University services. Adding specialized counselors is a smart way to reach those populations that GW is attracting with more frequency, and putting $150,000 into the office’s budget this year alone shows a strong commitment to mental health.
But mental health services at GW are still catching up. Helping students hinges not only on extensive outreach to publicize that these counselors are available, but also on using future UCC money to increase the number of free counseling sessions per student.
So far, the UCC, located blocks from the center of campus, has done little to publicize its new niche services. This year, the office should channel its outreach efforts to specific student groups on campus who can spread the word to their members about specialized counseling.
It is generally acceptable for University resources to be reactive. It’s okay that the Career Center doesn’t knock on residence hall doors asking for resumes to critique, and nobody expects Lerner Health and Wellness Center to try to corral students onto treadmills.
But when it comes to the University Counseling Center, a department charged with cultivating and maintaining the strong mental health of the student body, administrators need to take a more active stance.
The transition to college can be particularly difficult for international students, many of whom may feel isolated by language or social barriers. Student organizations help create a closer campus community for them, and for most students.
Granted, not all international students are involved in international student organizations. And an advertising campaign tailored specifically to student groups won’t reach every student in need of counseling. But it’s a good start to bring in more students who need help.
As the University looks to expand these specialized counselors to other populations – like the LGBT community – the office should make a similar marketing effort to ensure that these services reach a wider breadth of students than merely the active ones who seek out help on their own.
Going forward, the counseling center should also use its larger budget to offer more services to students for free. The University now provides students with six free counseling sessions. After that, students are either required to pay for their meetings, or seek help elsewhere.
If GW was truly committed to mental health, it would offer more than just short-term services. It is concerning that the UCC only sees itself as a short-term care center. It’s also not the norm, given that 93 percent of universities offer unlimited services free of charge, according to data from 320 schools in the 2010 National Survey of Counseling Center Directors.
Money, of course, is limited, and GW has a host of options for added funding. But while GW is now prioritizing mental health more, we know the University is still leaving behind some students who need help.
As students at GW, we’re customers of the University, whether we realize it or not. We pay for these important resources, but they do us no good if they stay hidden or if our access to them is restricted.

Fifty years after a 34-year-old reverend trumpeted a call for racial justice, President Barack Obama stood on the same steps and said inequalities continue to burden the nation’s minorities.
Tens of thousands stood in the shadow of the Lincoln Memorial as Obama praised Martin Luther King, Jr. for ushering in the era of integration – with “a power and prophecy unmatched in our time” – that eventually shaped a nation that could elect a black president in 2008.
He lauded the 1960s civil rights leaders for their courage and commitment to nonviolence. And he urged the crowd – especially those who have been born in the 45 years since King’s death – to renew the movement in this era centering on economic injustices. 
“As we mark this anniversary, we must remind ourselves that the measure of progress for those who marched 50 years ago was not merely how many blacks could join the ranks of millionaires,” Obama said. “It was whether this country would admit all people who were willing to work hard, regardless of race, into the ranks of a middle-class life.”
Obama highlighted issues that still trouble minorities, like poverty and education, “from the corners of Anacostia to the hills of Appalachia,” linking them to a widening gap between economic classes. The speech, given blocks from GW’s campus in front of a crowd peppered with students, struck a careful balance of praising civil rights milestones while pressing for further progress.
“To dismiss the magnitude of this progress – to suggest, as some sometimes do, that little has changed –  that dishonors the courage and the sacrifice of those who paid the price to march in those years,” said Obama, flanked by two former Democratic presidents and members of the King family. “But we would dishonor those heroes as well to suggest that the work of this nation is somehow complete.”
Marchers headed into the rain as early as 9 a.m., and those without tickets to the event clustered around the Washington Monument. The crowd was not as vast as that of 1963, but the atmosphere was infused with a similar mix of personal emotion, frustration with the pace of progress, pride in what activists had previously accomplished, and optimism for future change.
Leann Rimes’ voice, singing “Amazing Grace,” floated over the crowd and mixed with cheers in the early afternoon. Images of King appeared every few steps on buttons and t-shirts. Signs read, “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere” and “We March for Jobs and Freedom.”
The lineup of speakers included Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., who was the youngest to speak at the March on Washington in 1963, as well as former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter and billionaire philanthropist Oprah Winfrey.
Before the speeches, hundreds walked through a soaked downtown to retrace the path of civil rights leaders in 1963, chanting for justice and singing “Let It Shine” as they donned rain ponchos and jackets.
Michelle Mitchell, a D.C. native, marched to honor the memory of her father, Maurice Clark, who risked losing his job in the federal government to participate in the 1963 march.
“People were scared. Both the marchers, black and white people, were scared for different reasons,” Mitchell remembers hearing from her father. “They had a lot to lose by just coming, even though they felt very strongly about what Dr. King said.”
Fifty years earlier on the Mall, Clark climbed a tree to see over the crowd of more than 250,000.
“When he was marching, I’m sure he was thinking about all the different struggles he was going through, trying to make a better life for all of us,” Mitchell said.
Cindy Jaffe, who worked on both of Obama’s presidential campaigns, traveled from Florida to hear the speeches. She remembers hearing King’s speech when she was a sophomore in high school in Cleveland.
“This was an opportunity for me to participate in something that really moved me at the time although I couldn’t go,” Jaffe said.
Avra Bossov, a GW junior, skipped class to hear Rabbi Israel Brezner, who spoke at the Religious Action Center about his relationship with King, a Baptist minister. The two clergymen discovered they shared the same problems with prejudice and discrimination.
“Dr. King is known not only for his words but also for his deeds. It’s not just the talk-the-talk but also the walk-the-walk,” Bossov said.

Student organizations could be required to dole out extra cash to hire insured bartenders because of a new alcohol policy written to help reduce GW’s legal liabilities.
Student leaders who met with administrators this month expect a new policy will include a streamlined event registration process – a key piece of recent lobbying. But the policy reportedly would force groups to hire insured vendors with bartenders and require food be served alongside any alcoholic drinks.
The proposed changes are expected to come within the next week after a nearly two-year review of the University’s alcohol policy.
While administrators would not speak to policy details publicly, leaders of the Student Bar Association, the Student Association and Greek life explained the policy proposals shared with them. Some said imposing extra costs on student groups would cause financial hardship.
Alexis Janda, the Center for Alcohol and other Drug Education’s associate director, declined to provide information about the policies, but said feedback from student leaders “has impacted our decisions.” She said some possible pieces of the proposed policies “will not happen,” but declined to elaborate.
“We recently began another round of outreach to seek additional, final input from students and student leaders on a few specific proposed modifications we plan to enact this fall,” Janda said in an email.
Nicole Tyrell, the Student Bar Association’s chief of staff who has worked with GW to reshape its alcohol policy, said Janda and Senior Associate Dean of Students Mark Levine indicated that the mandate to hire insured vendors would likely remain in the policy.
“We are now having to figure out where we are going to be able to get that extra funding from to be able to meet those requirements,” Tyrell said. “Everything is up in the air right now, depending on whether we can get additional funding for vendors.
Tyrell said Janda planned to share the last round of changes to the policy during a meeting Friday.
If finalized, the reworked policy will also squeeze money out of student organization budgets by requiring  food to be available at all events with alcohol, even at a cash bar where attendees purchase their own drinks.
The Student Bar Association is considering requesting additional funds from the SA to comply with the policy, Tyrell said.
SA President Julia Susuni said any appeals in response to funding shortfalls from the new policy would be addressed on a case-by-case basis, but pointed to the SA’s $241,843 co-sponsorship fund as a potential source of money.
During her meeting with University administrators on the alcohol policy, Susuni said she suggested the University work with vendors to offer discounts to student organizations or pitch in more funds.
“I would love to see if there could be some funding from some kind of department within the University to sort of compensate, or to help student organizations out,” Susuni said. “I would love to see them taking on more of a role in terms of making this – if this proposal does become a policy – something that isn’t such a financial burden.”
The changes will come two years after the Student Bar Association began lobbying GW to clarify language in its alcohol policy and loosen the rules for graduate student groups. That pressure from student groups ignited an overhaul of the alcohol policy that covers registered student and faculty events.
The revamped policy would also help cut down red tape to register events.
Staff advisers would be allowed to approve events, cutting out extra layers in the registration process. The policy would also require signatures from just two sober monitors to complete event registration paperwork, instead of from all the sober monitors required to attend the event.
Additionally, students who go through Responsible Alcohol Management training one time would be able to test out of the requirement to take the training again two years later, a change the Student Association pushed for.
The revised policy is also expected to formalize changes for graduate students in effect since last fall that reduced the sober monitor ratio from 1-to-20 to just one monitor for every 50 attendees.

When GW fired Doug Guthrie for $13 million of overspending last week, the University did not just lose an ambitious business school dean.
Administrators also got rid of their chief China strategist just as GW explores opening a campus in Beijing. Now, after GW’s plans for a three-continent degree dragged last year, GW’s international campaign has to regroup.
“In a way, it’s a test of how important it is to the University leadership to move forward with something in China,” said Richard Edelstein, a research associate at Berkeley University’s Center for Studies in Higher Education. “So it certainly doesn’t help the cause if they fired a key person, but it doesn’t necessarily result in a serious problem that can’t be confronted in various ways.”
GW has heaped time and money into the country, where they have added academic programs, research partnerships and donor connections since Guthrie came aboard three years ago.
For years, colleges have struggled to dig deep stakes into China. But since Guthrie was hired as dean in 2010, the GW School of Business started two masters programs in Suzhou, China and landed high-profile partnerships in the country.
People like Guthrie, an expert in Chinese economic reform who is fluent in Mandarin, help bridge the gap between universities in the two countries, said Chronicle of Higher Education reporter Karen Fischer, who specializes in international education.
“China is a complex place to navigate and one where relationships matter. Having someone who is familiar with the culture and can build bridges always helps,” she said. “How big of a loss Guthrie’s departure is depends on how much the broader university bought into the importance of the work in China.”
University officials say they have made enough progress and gathered enough buy-in for Chinese expansion that Guthrie’s departure will not curb those efforts. In particular, the University has been in talks with Beijing-based universities like Renmin University and the University for International Business and Economics.
Knapp fired Guthrie after they disagreed on how to move forward after he spent $13 million more than planned last year on GW School of Business programs, but maintained that planned growth in China would continue without him. Lerman will temporarily steer its operations there.
“Dr. Guthrie indeed has important relationships that were helpful in developing our initiatives, but he is by no means the only member of our faculty or administration with important relationships in China,” Knapp said in an email Wednesday. “Our potential partners have already indicated their readiness to continue our discussions.”
Guthrie was also the executive director for Qiaohua Management Consulting, another position stripped from him last week. The firm, located in China, has three Chinese employees working on University initiatives since foreign companies cannot hire Chinese residents who live in China.
David Shambaugh, director of the China Policy Program in the Elliott School of International Affairs, said many of GW’s expansion in China would continue, citing the strength of various China programs within his own school.
He added that Guthrie’s was not the University’s only China expert, and that many others at GW, like himself, are also fluent in Mandarin and travel annually to China. But he added that the University would benefit from greater coordination of its China-related programs.
Shambaugh warned that as the University looks to increase its presence in China, they should study universities like New York and Duke.
“GW needs to give very careful, deliberate, and strategic thought as to what kind of presence it seeks in China, and it needs to carefully study the successes and failures of these other universities’ experiences before embarking on our own initiatives,” he said in an email.
Hired away from the No. 5 Stern School of Business at NYU in 2010, Guthrie’s vision for expansion in China was a significant reason why he was selected as the business school dean. Some business school faculty had objected to the hire because of his lack of management experience.
“There is no question that Dr. Guthrie’s knowledge of China was an important part of the vision he brought to the deanship, and that vision was an important factor in the faculty search committee’s selection of Dr. Guthrie as a finalist for the position,” Knapp said.

Updated Aug. 29 at 4:18 p.m.
The University’s effort to extend its policing power off campus is gaining traction across the city, though neighborhood officials and civil liberties groups are questioning why the private police force should step out of its boundaries.
Georgetown University and D.C. Council chairman Phil Mendelson have voiced early support for a GW-backed plan that would be proposed by a consortium of D.C. universities. GW hopes the tentative plan will reach the Council this fall, allowing University police officers to respond to some incidents of student misconduct off campus.
The University is pushing the legislation after admitting last spring that it had spent years operating outside its jurisdiction.
But groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union and Student Press Law Center are paying attention to the policies, which expand the power of campus police but do not hold them to the same transparency standards as city law enforcement.
UPD can enforce, arrest and carry weapons on GW’s campus, or off the grounds when chasing a suspect, under city law. GW officials, including UPD Chief Kevin Hay, have repeatedly declined to discuss why officers skirted D.C. law.
Mendelson, the District’s second-most powerful representative, said he would support the legislation but Council members would first have to determine the limit of that authority with Metropolitan Police Department.
“If a crime occurs, particularly a violent crime such as assault or robbery, but also something minor like disturbing the peace, it makes no sense to preclude campus police from being able to respond, especially if it is across the street,” Mendelson wrote in an email.
Officials said GW and neighboring universities have not yet reached a consensus or crafted a specific proposal. Multiple Council members and spokespeople for Howard, Catholic and Gallaudet universities declined to comment on the potential legislation. But Georgetown spokeswoman Rachel Pugh confirmed the university’s backing.
“If we can get all other universities to join forces with us, we think we have a decent chance,” Hay said at a community meeting last month.
The proposal, however, has critics. Students and neighbors, including Advisory Neighborhood Council commissioner Asher Corson, have blasted GW for lack of communication as they shape the proposal.
Corson said he wasn’t completely opposed to an expansion of power for UPD, but he wants the process to be more transparent and take community feedback into account.
“If we could create a system where there is some sort of accountability like real police, I wouldn’t be opposed to expanding authority,” Corson said.
The ANC has invited neighbors, students and administrators to an open forum Sept. 10 at the School Without Walls to address the off-campus policing policy. Corson invited the American Civil Liberties Union, the nation’s leading civil rights group, because he said the University’s police should not have more power unless it releases its crime records to the public.
When UPD responds to an incident, it does not release a record of the case – unlike municipal police departments, including MPD, which keep reports that can be accessed by the public.
Franke LoMonte, the executive director of the Student Press Law Center, said he would consider introducing an amendment that would designate incident reports, whether prepared by officers at private or public institutions, as matters of public record.
“I feel pretty strongly that if they’re going to be running around in residential neighborhoods in the District of Columbia, doing work that would otherwise be done by D.C. city police, they should be held to the same disclosure policies as the city police,” LoMonte said.
Fritz Mulhauser, an attorney with the ACLU, said the organization would carefully review the proposal and raise questions about campus police exerting their authority beyond campus.
“But once they are empowered to roam the streets, first how can campus police, out in the community, tell who is a student over whom they have authority?” Mulhauser said.
At an August meeting with Foggy Bottom neighbors, the University’s top officials announced plans to work with other D.C. colleges to craft the legislation so UPD officers could patrol off campus on weekend nights when neighbors have the most noise complaints.
Senior Associate Vice President for Safety and Security Darrell Darnell said then UPD officers would refer to a directory of students’ off-campus addresses after GW announced plans to ensure students register their D.C. addresses with the University.
“It would give us the authority if we knocked on the door, we could ask for GWorld cards and who’s in there just like we do in our residence halls right now. And they would have to produce it,” Darnell said.
ANC commissioner and GW senior Patrick Kennedy said conversations about expanding jurisdiction did not begin until MPD clarified university police boundaries in the spring, when UPD discovered it was operating outside its jurisdiction.
“I think other universities were operating like GW was until April – a see no evil, hear no evil type thing. GW had set a precedent that police power extended to adjacent areas. So it wasn’t until this was dispelled that the conversations began to take place,” Kennedy said.
But the chief of police for the University of District of Columbia said the proposal was spearheaded by the Consortium of Universities of the Washington Metropolitan Area – which links the city’s 13 universities and one college.
“This affects all of the [police departments] in DC, but it has not gathered much speed so far. GW is not doing this, the Consortium is doing this,” the chief, Michael Rogers, wrote in an email.
D.C. Council members have also hesitated to weigh in before more details emerge. Jack Evans, whose constituency includes Foggy Bottom and who typically introduces GW-related bills, said he would first talk with students before he advocated for any legislation.
Council member Tommy Wells, who chairs the Council’s public safety and judiciary committee, echoed Evans and said he would have to “receive public feedback from the impacted communities before any major shifts were implemented.”
This story was updated on Aug. 29 to clarify that GW hopes the proposal would be taken up by the D.C. Council this fall, not necessarily that it is set to.

Correction appended
The Office of Sustainability is taking steps to purchase more solar panels and partner with engineering professors to build a small-scale wind turbine this year, as GW tries to reduce its dependence on coal power over the next decade.
The solar panels would heat campus water systems and capture rays for electricity, Director of the Office of Sustainability Meghan Chapple-Brown said. GW will go forward with the plan if costs and zoning regulations are favorable, which would make it will be the first time the University uses solar energy for electricity on a larger scale, after having used solar panels on three residence halls to heat the buildings’ water for the past two years.
While the office is still working out details and will put out a request for proposal this academic year, the move would put GW on track to reach its ambitious goal of slashing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2025 and 80 percent by 2040.
The solar panels would be the newest added since GW first began collecting solar energy in 2011 with rooftop installations on Ivory Tower, 1959 E St. and Building JJ.
Those panels collect enough power to heat most of each building’s water use the year. In the last three years, the system saved a total of about 300 tons of carbon dioxide, said Shannon Ross, a coordinator in the sustainability office – which is equivalent to the energy use of 14 homes for one year.
The University’s Climate Action Plan, released three years ago, also calls for the campus to produce 10 percent of its own low-carbon energy technology by 2040.
The two renewable energy projects are part of a massive University-wide sustainability plan, which sets goals for GW to grow its own food, produce zero waste and eventually stop producing carbon altogether.
Going carbon-neutral is the most important step GW can take to become a more sustainable college – and to jump in national rankings of green colleges, said Avital Andrews, an environmental expert who is an editor for the Sierra Club’s magazine.
“Climate change is probably the most dire environmental issue that we face right now – not that water pollution and landfills aren’t a huge problem as well, but it’s what we’re most concerned about,” Andrews said. “We’d love to see as much solar as possible.”
And boosting GW’s sustainability score is a big priority for the University, Chapple-Brown said.
Five years ago, the Sierra Club named GW one of the nation’s least eco-friendly schools. That failing score came a year after University President Knapp arrived at GW with sustainability as one of his highest priorities.
This year, GW crept onto the list of the top 25 green schools, coming in at No. 23.
GW, though, lags behind competitor schools such as American University, which is on track to become carbon neutral in just seven years. In addition to converting solar power into electricity, AU has the largest solar-powered water heating system in the District. It also converts used cooking oil from its dining halls into electricity.
Andrews, who has studied colleges’ uses of renewable energy, said it can take years for schools to make broad changes in their energy consumption, but that process can be sped up if an administration fully buys into the plan.
“It seems like something that can happen quickly if schools put their mind to it, and especially if there’s a demand from students and alumni,” Andrews said. “They can make it happen quickly if they want to.”
The types of clean energy a school uses depends on its location and what resources it has available, Andrews said. The University of Washington, for example, which sits on a bay that opens into the Pacific Ocean, is almost entirely hydro-powered.
Solar panels are more suited to city life, especially in D.C., which sees lots of sunlight and heat almost daily, Andrews said. She noted that the White House recently added more solar panels to its roof.
As GW tries to use alternative sources of energy, it is also going through a multi-million dollar effort to upgrade the electric and heating systems in the University’s buildings. The project, dubbed the “eco-building program,” began last year and will reduce energy use in each upgraded building by 15 percent.
This story was updated on Aug. 29 at 5 p.m. to reflect the following:
The Hatchet incorrectly reported that definite plans were in place for GW to add solar panels. GW is actually still in the planning stages.

The University’s endowment grew 5 percent over the last year, a $70 million rebound that still kept GW’s finances plodding along and administrators planning for stubbornly small gains in the near future.
The University’s treasurer said he was pleased that the $1.37 billion endowment grew slightly – an improvement after it eroded by 2.25 percent last year. But he said he does not expect the University’s nest egg to keep pace with GW’s boom years.
“There were years when you were having 20 or 30 percent returns. That’s not in the cards right now. It’s much more difficult to get those kinds of returns in the recent past and probably will be in the future,” Executive Vice President and Treasurer Lou Katz said.
He said GW’s total endowment is likely to remain near $1.37 billion for the next several years as global markets continue to stabilize and GW funnels more money into academic programs as part of its likely $400 million strategic plan.
With endowment growth slowing, pressure will mount on GW to fundraise more heavily. The Board of Trustees allows GW to draw about 5 percent of its endowment for its operating budget to fund academics and financial aid. GW used about $68 million of its endowment last year.
The small endowment growth comes on the heels of the University’s first fundraising decline in five years. GW raised $103 million last year, a 14 percent decline from the year before’s record fundraising haul, which included one of the biggest gifts in GW’s history.
Last year, the University spent about $20 million more than it earned as it paid for its most expensive academic and residence halls to date.
Katz said this year’s gains were due to increased investments in domestic companies – a shift in strategy that began a few years ago.
But the markets – especially overseas – are still volatile, and Katz said the gains from domestic firms this year come in part from a post-recession mentality that cuts out workers and forces companies to work more productively, increasing profit margins.
GW’s endowment – the financial foundation for the University –  is relatively small compared to schools it calls its peers. Lee Gardner, the finance and policy editor for the Chronicle of Higher Education, said large endowment returns are vital to fund institutional transformations, like the ones GW is pushing through in its 10-year strategic plan.
“It’s important for any school with a strategic view to grow its endowment,” Gardner said. “Endowments can be important to institutions’ financial stability and also provide some financial cushion.”
Ken Redd, director of research at the National Association of College and University Business Officers, said GW’s foreign investments likely contributed to the sluggish growth because “internationals did not do well last year.”
“At some point, the international markets will turn around as well, we just don’t know when,” Redd said. “That could be three to five years from now, but who knows? That’s the optimistic view.”
American stocks performed better than the previous year, though Redd said universities should still be wary while managing their endowment in the “volatile investment environment.”
“Financial markets have been really stressed. Risk is going to be the biggest challenge for institutions moving forward,” he said.
GW has also invested vigorously in real estate around Foggy Bottom in recent years, which has offered consistently solid returns compared to more shaky investments in national or global firms.

Student Health Service will hold fewer HIV testing clinics this fall after participation plummeted 80 percent compared to the previous year, when tests cost $25.
The free clinics – a top priority of last year’s Student Association – will be held monthly, rather than weekly, after another year of declining interest.
Participation in the program peaked in 2011, when 711 students got tested. Last year, 95 students took the free tests – which is 433 fewer students from last year.
University health officials have said waning interest could be due to the availability of home testing kits or tests more regularly being conducted during students’ regular physicals.
Philip Horowitz, president of the Student Global AIDS Campaign and also a leader of Allied in Pride, said the most common deterrent for students is the fear of having their blood drawn, because few know that the test is a cheek swab.
Of the more than 1.1 million people living in the U.S. with HIV, 18 percent of them do not know they are infected with the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The D.C. Department of Health showed the area surrounding Foggy Bottom has the third-lowest proportion of people living with HIV out of D.C.’s eight wards. About 2.1 percent of Ward 2’s population is afflicted with the disease, according to its most recent annual report.
GW receives HIV testing kits for free by the D.C. Department of Health, but in the past has charged to cover the cost of staffing.
Susan Haney, associate director of Student Health Service, said access to free testing removes “one significant barrier” to learning an individual’s status.
“Although it is very rare to have a positive test result during this type of clinic, it raises the awareness of HIV and hopefully provides an opportunity for students to look at their behavior, assess their risk and make changes if needed,” Haney said.
The monthly clinics will be held on the first Wednesday of every month from 4:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.
Student Association president Julia Susuni, who stressed health issues in her platform, praised GW for offering the free service. She called it a success of the SA’s task force on student health, which will focus on GW health care policies all year.
She added that she hopes to push back the clinic by 30 minutes in the evening to give more opportunity for students to get tested after classes or work.
