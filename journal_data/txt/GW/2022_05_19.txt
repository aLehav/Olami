The University bought the building in 1996 and have used it as a residence hall since.
Officials announced the hiring of a property advisory firm to aid the process of selling The Aston, a New Hampshire Avenue residence hall, in a release Monday.
The University said they will work with Savills, a London-based real estate firm, to sell the building by the fall, a goal that GW said depends on market interest and the quality of offers from potential buyers. Vice President of Finance and Treasurer Bruno Fernandes said The Aston’s distance from campus and the current demand for housing in the District led the University to put the building on the market.
“The Aston has been a valuable asset to the university for many years, but its off-campus location is not ideal for student residences,” Fernandes said. “The strong demand for well-located multifamily properties in Washington, D.C., renders this a perfect time to market the property in support of our broader academic goals.”
The University first housed undergraduates in The Aston when they bought the property in 1996, but converted the building into law student housing in 2007. Officials moved juniors and seniors back into The Aston in 2019 while Thurston Hall underwent renovations.
However, dozens of Aston residents complained to officials about ongoing maintenance issues on the property like water outages, flooding and lapses in security in early April. The University issued a $250 housing credit to residents shortly after in an email response, partially attributing the problems to the building’s old plumbing system.
“We recognize there have been other challenges not addressed here throughout the year that have caused frustration and intermittent disruptions that may be affecting your overall living experience,” officials said in the email sent to Aston residents.

Wrighton called on University community members to “advocate for change” in their commitment to problem-solving across disciplines and partisan lines.
Interim University President Mark Wrighton expressed sorrow Wednesday for the victims of Tuesday’s school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, urging the GW community to call for change following the deadliest school shooting in nearly a decade.
In a statement issued via Twitter, Wrighton said he is “sickened” and “devastated” after an 18-year-old gunman killed 19 children and two adults at Robb Elementary School Tuesday. The tragedy marked the deadliest school shooting since 26 children and adults were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012.
Wrighton called on GW community members to “advocate for change” as part of their constant work to devise solutions to “seemingly intractable” issues like gun violence across disciplines and partisan lines. Wrighton said the GW community must mobilize its research, teaching and policy work to oppose the “public health crisis” of recent gun violence in communal areas like schools, places of worship and grocery stores.
“We can and must do something – anything – to turn the tide on gun violence,” the statement reads. 
 The Uvalde mass shooting marks the 27th school shooting in the United States in 2022, bringing the total number of victims who have been killed or injured to 83, according to Education Week. The elementary school shooting follows a racist mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, where an 18-year-old gunman killed 10 Black people in a grocery store earlier this month. 
GW community members who need support in the wake of the Uvdale mass shooting can turn to the Office for Diversity, Equity and Community Engagement, Student Life at GW, the Health Center, Human Resources and Faculty Affairs for support, according to a subsequent tweet by the University.

Dean Cissy Petty has served as the vice president of student affairs, the dean of students and the executive director of the colonial health center since joining the University in 2018.
Cissy Petty will retire June 30 after four years of service as a University administrator, according to a release Tuesday.
Petty has served as the vice president of student affairs, the dean of students and the executive director of the Colonial Health Center since joining the University in 2018. She said in the release that she hopes the University will continue to “show up” for students after she retires from GW and moves to Louisiana to join her wife, who she married in December.
“There is never a dull moment in a crowd of students, which is what gives our campus a sense of vibrancy,” Petty said in the release.
Transition plans will be announced before Petty departs GW, according to the release.
Petty moved into District House last fall to attend more student events and foster relationships with students to better understand their needs. She said while living in District House, she hosted North Village Neighborhood meetings with residents from Lafayette, Munson and JBKO halls and District House to rebuild a sense of community undergraduates lost with the removal of the resident advisor program this academic year.
Petty said she gave out her phone number to families to serve as a resource in the case of an emergency which helped foster relationships and build connections with new-student families during students’ move-in.
“I have a sense that our student leaders have come to trust that they will get straight answers from me, and they know that even when we disagree, I care deeply about each and every one of them,” Petty said.
Petty was initially hired as the dean of the student experience and was promoted to vice president of student affairs and dean of students after one year at GW. She said she encouraged students to leave their dorms to bond with each other throughout her first year at GW.
“It’s our job to push boundaries and not stay tied to any one way of doing something,” Petty said in the release.
Petty served as the executive director of the CHC after her hire in 2018 and became the permanent leader of the center last fall after speaking with students and families about their demands for the center. Petty extended CHC service hours on the weekends and established a clinic on the Mount Vernon Campus.
“Our focus on the student experience and being with and for students has been embedded in the culture of the Division for Student Affairs,” Petty said.

All juniors who apply to live off-campus by the end of May will have their applications approved, according to an email from officials.
Officials reopened the off-campus residency exemption application period for rising juniors through May and extended some students the opportunity to add a third roommate to their two-person rooms until May 27 in emails sent to residents earlier this week.
In emails to residents, Seth Weinshel, the associate vice president of business services for Campus Living and Residential Education, said officials are offering discounts to students who accept another roommate and are allowing juniors to live off campus to free up beds while residents remain on waitlists. Weinshel offered to reduce students’ price of housing between $4,000 and $5,000 for students who agree to receive a third roommate in Fulbright, JBKO, Munson, Guthridge and FSK halls and The Dakota.
Officials said about 250 students were placed on the housing waitlist in early April and aim for the students to receive housing placements by the start of June. Since then, some students report being taken off the waitlist, but many who remain on the list received the email offering off-campus living requests Monday.
Weinshel said bed spaces become available over the summer when students decide to study abroad, transfer or take a leave of absence in the email, and that the original layout of some of the targetted halls — like Fulbright Hall — were designed to fit more people. He said students who decide to receive a third roommate next fall can either choose their own roommate or allow the University to assign them one randomly.
“In previous academic years, your 2022-2023 room in Fulbright Hall was designated as a four person unit,” Weinshel said in the email to a student living in Fulbright Hall next year. “In our initial planning for fall 2022, we assigned housing based on our current scenario of two students in a room.”
Ellen Zane, the vice chair of the Board of Trustees, said during last week’s Board meeting that the University’s ongoing project to renovate Thurston Hall is “on time” and will finish sometime during the summer. The University housed nearly 300 students in One Washington Circle Hotel to make up for lost space due to the Thurston renovations, which started in 2020 and are scheduled to end this summer, opening up about 820 beds.
One Washington Circle Hotel and The Aston, another upperclassmen residence hall, are not listed as student housing next year, according to GW’s website.
Weinshel also extended the period for rising juniors to live off-campus in an email Monday. He said officials were “pleased” to reopen the housing exemption process in light of hearing many students needed more time to consider their fall housing options.
GW typically requires freshmen, sophomores and juniors to live on-campus and limits the number of exemptions allowed, but Weinshel said in the email that all juniors who apply for a residency exemption will be granted one.
“All rising third-year students who apply by 5 p.m. EDT on Tuesday, May 31, will be granted a residency exemption and your 2022-23 housing assignment will be canceled,” Weinshel said in the email.

Bishop is slated to begin the permanent role in July after officials said they conducted a national search to fill the position, according to a University release.
Officials appointed Kelley Bishop as the new associate vice provost for the Center for Career Services in the Division of Enrollment and Student Success. 
Bishop is slated to begin the permanent role in July after officials said they conducted a national search with a campus-wide interview process to fill the position, according to a University release. Georgette Edmondson-Wright, the associate vice provost for student success, has served as the interim associate vice provost for the Center for Career Services since Rachel Brown, the former associate vice provost, left the University in October. 
“It is an honor to join this great university and have the opportunity to build on their strong tradition of fostering high levels of student and career success,” Bishop said. 
Bishop served as the interim assistant vice president for Living and Learning at the University of Maryland, a position he has held since January after directing their University Career Center and The President’s Promise for about nine years. Bishop was also the director of career services at Syracuse University for about five years before joining Michigan State University as the executive director for Career Services for about 10 years. 
“His extensive insights for aligning career development within academic programs, specialized employer services and students’ professional growth opportunities will undoubtedly serve the GW community extremely well,” Jay W. Goff, the vice provost for Enrollment and Student Success, said in the release.
