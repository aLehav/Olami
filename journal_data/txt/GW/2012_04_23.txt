The School of Nursing will extend its global reach when an administrator helps a university in Singapore implement its own advanced nursing program.
The project, taken on by the school’s director of community and global health initiatives Joyce Pulcini, will initially only involve nursing students at the National University of Singapore, but administrators believe her consultative work could lead to foreign exchange programs in Southeast Asia for nursing students.
Developing international partnerships has become a focus for the Virginia-based nursing school, which formed in 2010, because students demand a more global understanding of health care issues, Pulcini said.
“These experiences will help broaden students’ perspectives and make them understand in a concrete way what poverty is and the role public health plays abroad, since chances are that these nurses will end up treating immigrants or patients that have been exposed to different diseases in another country,” she said.
Pulcini said she will return to Singapore in the fall to consult on the national university’s upcoming pediatrics program after delivering an initial consultation there in March.
The consulting work by Pulicini, who specializes in pediatrics, will help the Singaporean university set up a pediatric advanced practice nursing program – and start a dialogue for the school to work on exchange programs for students and faculty.
She stressed that while the school is working on long-term arrangements internationally, no plans are finalized.
GW’s nursing work in Singapore could allow for a smoother transition to other countries in the region and around the world.
Pulcini, who came to GW in January, said Thailand could be the next site of a global partnership where students and faculty would travel to hone their nursing skills in populations facing varying health issues. Ecuador and Central American countries are also possible destinations for nursing students at GW.
“Even if [GW] nursing students don’t end up working in another country, they will still have to deal with a multicultural group of patients here at home,” Pulcini said. “Experiences like these change the course of their careers. They look at what they want to do in terms of public health and it really changes their lives.”
Jean Johnson, the nursing school’s dean, said students’ inaugural trip to Haiti in February – with another trip slated for July – has also helped the two-year-old school get off the ground with its international offerings.
Three nursing students joined assistant nursing professor Carol Lang on the first trip to Haiti, part of a collaboration with Florida-based nonprofit Project Medishare, which assists more than 800 patients through health education programs and medical treatment.
“One of the strategic partnerships [with Project Medishare] is in Haiti and we are looking to develop them in other countries,” Johnson said. “This is a goal because we all recognize the benefits of our students providing service to other countries while learning how the social, economic and political environment of a country affects health and how health care is delivered.”
The school’s population of more than 500 nursing students – mostly based on the Virginia Science and Technology Campus – have expressed desire for more readily available academic and professional opportunities, said Andrew Goretsky, director of graduate, distance, and professional student experience at the Center for Student Engagement.

GW is fine-tuning its sustainability goals as part of a continuing effort to make the urban school more eco-friendly, University President Steven Knapp announced Friday.
The new targets, dubbed the “ecosystem plan,” include recycling half of total waste produced by 2017, reducing light pollution in construction projects and purchasing more food from local sources. These goals will become the tenets of a formal plan, set to be released this summer.
Overall, the new guidelines, which Knapp hopes will serve as a template for other colleges in the District, also zone in on animal habitats and paper waste.
“We want to become the chief model of urban sustainability in a city that itself aspires to be a green city,” Knapp said at the University’s annual Earth Day Fair. “It’s not a question about just being kind to the environment, it’s a question about human survival on this planet, at least with the kind of life that all of you want to enjoy and want your fellow human beings to enjoy.”
The Office of Sustainability plans to review GW’s waste program and revamp specific components in the new plan, including a greater focus on composting, Sophie Waskow, GW’s sustainability project facilitator, said prior to Knapp’s announcement.
“Zero-waste is something you can’t do overnight, so the sort of more immediate goal is the 50 percent recycling rate. It was very important for us to set those longer term vision goals, as well as things that we can really implement and work on right now,” Waskow said.
The University will also plant more native trees on G Street between 20th and 21st streets to encourage biodiversity and release hundreds of ladybugs and praying mantises, which feed on insects like mosquitoes.
The ecosystem plan is the third step in implementing the American College and University Presidents’ Climate Commitment, which Knapp signed at GW’s first official Earth Day celebration in 2008. The institution was the first college in the District to sign.
Knapp also signed a commitment in February with eight other presidents from area colleges to promote sustainability in tandem with Mayor Vincent Gray.
The University’s 2010 Climate Action Plan, which aims to achieve carbon neutrality, and its 2011 GWater Plan, which focuses on water conservation on campus, were the first two steps in GW’s sustainability strategy.
“The whole purpose is to figure out how we create a healthy ecosystem with this built environment that we have here on campus and in the way that we reach other ecosystems,” Meghan Chapple-Brown, director of GW’s Office of Sustainability, said.
The University will also try to better connect the GW community to local ecosystems by hosting outings and service-learning projects in areas like Rock Creek Park and the Potomac River.
Students, faculty and staff are “not signing up for a less sustainable lifestyle because they are in a city, but in fact, they’re signing up for a more sustainable lifestyle because of the resources that we have in a city to use things more efficiently,” Chapple-Brown said.  Green initiatives also come with financial perks, helping to cut back water and electricity consumption, Knapp said.
“We’re actually expecting to have net savings in energy that will translate into part of the [Innovation Task Force] funds we can invest in our academic programs, which I think is very exciting,” Knapp said in an interview Friday.
The task force, launched in 2009, identifies areas where the University can increase cost efficiency and funnels the savings into academics.
Waskow declined to give the costs associated with implementing the ecosystem plan, citing ongoing expenses as policies are rolled out.
Sustainability has been a priority for Knapp since his arrival at the University in 2007, when he founded the Office of Sustainability.
GW was among hundreds of other colleges nationwide lauded for their sustainability in a report released last week by the Princeton Review and the U.S. Green Building Council. The nod pointed especially to GW’s academic offerings, including its launch of a sustainability minor for next fall.

Sustainability
Through a few key steps taken this semester, the University has further signaled its dedication to going green. From University President Steven Knapp signing a citywide sustainability pledge – the first of its kind between city governments and institutions of higher education – to the creation of a sustainability minor, it has become clear the University takes environmental welfare seriously. Lafayette Hall and the Smith Center earned gold LEED rankings and the University hopes the Science and Engineering Hall and the renovated Ames Hall will also achieve at least silver LEED rankings. However, GW still falls behind its D.C. higher education rivals American and Georgetown universities when it comes to recycling. Of course, our location near the National Mall and government buildings means more non-GW visitors who might bring our recycling rates down, but there is room for improvement. And let’s face it, it would be really nice to make Georgetown green with envy at our sustainability achievements.
The Mount Vernon Campus
The Mount Vernon Campus has gotten a facelift this year and it’s doing wonders for the blighted reputation it carries among Foggy Bottom dwellers. The renovated Ames Hall that opened at the beginning of this semester provides a comfortable home for the University Writing Program and some of the University Honors Program. Undergraduate housing applications for the Vern surged by 40 percent this year, signaling that the campus is becoming a student destination instead of just the butt of tired jokes. That said, not everyone is feeling so warm toward GW’s second campus in D.C. Transfer students, many of whom are placed on the Vern, have overwhelmingly demonstrated their dissatisfaction with their housing assignments, and many ended up moving to Foggy Bottom. Despite this exodus, GW Housing Programs does not plan to change this policy, as it seeks to foster a so-called “transfer student community.” Rather than forcing transfer students to live on the Vern, the University should allow them to indicate their preferences when signing up for housing.
Student Space
Students are still clamoring for space on campus. And this issue isn’t going away. February’s Student Association election cycle largely focused on candidates’ plans for student space, and SA President-elect Ashwin Narla and SA Executive Vice President-elect Abby Bergren have highlighted student space as a key objective for their terms. We wish the two of them luck and persistence, as the University has deflected many of this year’s SA and Marvin Center Governing Board suggestions for student space. GW needs a communal area where students can collaborate, hold events or even just unwind. Without this campus nucleus, it will be difficult for the community to achieve the sense of GW affinity the University is striving to foster.
Transparency
At a time when the University has so much to boast, it’s a shame that it keeps so much secret. The University will soon unveil its rebranding campaign, a nearly yearlong undertaking which will clarify and unify its image, yet it will still not disclose the amount of money the effort costs. The University plans to make improvements to Gelman Library, but it will not disclose the details of its budget that might just secure it the donations it needs. Satisfaction is up 11 percent for the revamped J Street, but oddly enough, the University will not disclose what the satisfaction level used to be. And in times when there is so much changing and evolving on campus, it is critical that administration creates an active and open dialogue with the community. So like the University so often does, we decline to comment on the grade the University receives for its transparency this semester. But here’s a hint: it’s not an A, B, C or D.

Summer is all about escaping the day-to-day grind of academia.
But those who need to take classes during the summer should not be restricted to spending the entirety of these three months locked in a classroom.
This year, the University will offer 10 summer institutes that allow students to take courses toward their major, while also getting actively involved in the D.C. area. These institutes range from Japanese Language and Culture to an archaeology field study in Alexandria, Va.
Every department with 75 or more students pursuing a major should offer summer institutes. These represent the ideal summer school experiences, since they give students a chance to take courses for credit while also taking advantage of the District.
Each summer, the psychology department offers a 10-week program called the Summer Institute for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention in Minority Communities. Stephen Forssell, one of the directors of the institute, said students take four courses throughout the program, including: cross-cultural psychology, health psychology, principles and methods of health psychology and either supervised research or a field experience course. The program plans one event each week, where students might, for example, take a field trip to the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Silver Spring, Md. or listen to a guest speaker present research. By participating in this summer institute, students not only earn 13 credit hours toward their major, but they also gain invaluable experience in public health and diversity.
The program is also more affordable than if the classes were offered during the academic year. A 13-credit summer institute costs $10,923, which not only saves students money but also makes their schedules lighter and for some might allow them to graduate early.
Many departments offer courses during the summer that are the same as those offered during the academic year. For example, the sociology department offers Introduction to Sociology and Urban Sociology, which are also offered during the academic year. But with more summer institutes, students will have the option to take courses toward their majors, to use D.C. as a resource to enhance in-class learning and to work closely with professors on research and fieldwork.
For example, the geology department could establish an institute that focuses on the geological makeup of D.C. Students would work closely with their instructors, do fieldwork and conduct research that would help them better understand the topography of the District. Or the Department of Theatre and Dance could create an institute where students write and perform their own plays while also spending the summer seeing performances throughout D.C.
These institutes also provide a way for students to explore and gain new intellectual experiences in a particular subject that they might not have otherwise had the chance to study. All too often, people think of college as a time when they are supposed to become experts in a single area of study. But in reality, college is the place to cultivate a number of talents and interests.
As the University pushes for more opportunities for undergraduate research, summer institutes could be a perfect way for students to work alongside their professors. Students would not only get hands-on experience doing research in their field but professors would also benefit from having research aids interested in the subject matter.
No student should spend his or her entire summer holed up in the library with his or her nose pressed to a book. By increasing the number of summer institutes, the University will give students a chance to both study and immerse themselves in all that D.C. has to offer.

There’s something admirable about being so devoted to a cause that you are willing to risk arrest to achieve it.
Last Wednesday, four students did just that. U.S. Capitol Police arrested the D.C. Statehood Student Association members, who were accompanied by two non-GW students, when they blocked traffic as part of a protest advocating for District statehood.
The students did not back down, even after they were handcuffed and put into the back of a police van. It is this sort of behavior that solidifies GW’s status as one of the most politically active colleges in the country. But even better, it makes GW a school where students not only support important causes, but also act to change them.
Sideline activism runs rampant on college campuses, and showing support is as easy as sharing a video on Facebook or retweeting a story on Twitter. But that sort of activism is a passive and not very meaningful way to raise awareness. But what Patrick Kennedy, Matthew Laurinavicius, Moo Bae and Markus Batchelor did took effort and courage, as they stood up for what they believed in, even though they knew it would result in being put in the back of a police van.
Their plans started small; the advocates spent the past few months meeting with city leaders and trying to gain traction for the statehood movement. GW established a D.C. Statehood Student Association chapter in November, and the organization has expanded to include about 40 members. They obtained a permit to congregate at the corner of Constitution Avenue and First Street – the same location where a resurgence to the D.C. statehood movement occurred last April. After staging a protest in Kogan Plaza Wednesday, the students walked through the rain toward the Capitol, armed with signs and chants. The students who agreed to get arrested for their cause moved into the streets, blocking traffic and raising awareness about a critical issue. The police arrived at the scene shortly after to handcuff the protesters.
Whether it’s D.C.’s lack of statehood, the recent health care debate or even the fight for student space in the Marvin Center, students at GW care about pressing issues. This doesn’t mean students should run to be arrested to support any and all causes, but everyone should make an effort by throwing themselves into the issues about which they are passionate.
Students should take advantage of the opportunities that come with living in the District. We live in such close proximity to the most important policy makers in the country, and we need to tap into the resources our sheer location provides us. Whether it is through protests, lobbying efforts or even becoming a member of one of the many advocacy groups across D.C., making a difference is something that is not just an option, but an obligation here.
And big action pays off. The group of students who protested was small, but it garnered city wide attention and contributed to the dialogue about D.C.’s lack of representation. Even the mayor noticed them.
“We’re really thankful that GW students are stepping up for statehood,” Pedro Ribeiro, Mayor Vincent Gray’s communications director said. “As an alumnus the mayor is particularly impressed and proud.”

There are 168 hours in a week. What will you do with them?
For sophomores, the answer is increasingly to spend time at an internship.
Twenty percent more sophomores than freshmen spend time at an internship or job, according to an April Center for Student Engagement survey. And it makes sense. At GW, it is often considered a logical step for upperclassmen to begin pursuing internships. But while D.C. offers students tons of internship opportunities, getting involved in campus organizations at GW is particularly important.
Freshmen: As tempting as it might be to get a jump-start on your career off-campus, stick with your campus student organizations next year – they provide unique opportunities for finding friends, connections and leadership roles that are hard to find elsewhere.
The best way to build a community at GW is to make your own, and to do that you have to get involved in campus organizations. From the first day of Colonial Inauguration, we are told that to feel at home at GW, we must find our niche in a student organization.
If finding a campus community is an extra challenge at GW, students should work hard to find one, instead of exclusively working off campus where they likely won’t gain that same sense of unity with the student body. Campus organizations offer us the ability to make friends who share our interests and passions. We can grow as student leaders and also develop lasting relationships with fellow Colonials.
Although internships and jobs are ways to gain real world experience, we shouldn’t forget the useful experience one can obtain by becoming a leader in a student organization. Student leaders learn important skills by overseeing finances, planning high-profile events, recruiting members and drafting newsletters.
Involvement in student organizations also speaks volumes about a student’s passions and interests, which allows employers to get an idea of the person behind the resume. Whether you’re a member of a political organization, a community service group or even a dance team, being aligned with a student organization is a way for you to define yourself.
Indeed, internships are revered because they provide work experience, reveal an individual’s passion for a field of study and demonstrate experience in a particular area. But student organizations can also provide effective resume-building opportunities and leadership experience with lasting benefits.
Often, it’s the passion behind student organizations, as well as the vast array of them available to the student body, that makes students proud to be Colonials.

Each year, graduating editors are given 30 final column inches – “30” was historically used to signify the end of a story – to reflect on their time at The Hatchet, published in the final issues of the year.
I am terrible at sports.
But my high school’s mandatory two-varsity-sport requirement landed me in the middle of a soccer field my junior year. To this day, I do not know what position I played, as my coach constantly yelled at me to just stay “somewhere in the back,” explaining that my only job was to try and stop the ball.
I think she was hoping I would just stay out of my teammates’ way.
Not too surprisingly, we never won a game, but we were awarded the “Class D Sportsmanship Award” – hardly a desirable consolation prize.
Despite my career total of zero goals to match our zero wins, I loved the team. I loved team dinners and bus rides, and complaining while running – or in my case, walking – laps around the field in the pre-season summer sun. I loved my teammates, our inside jokes and nicknames that would spill over from the field into the hallways, making me feel like I had a familiar place and group where I actually belonged.
With all the late night prodos, potluck dinners, inside jokes, constant e-mails and phone calls – I talk to Lauren more than I talk to my entire family combined – The Hatchet has become my soccer team. I also think my writing skills are slightly better than my soccer skills, making this team far more enjoyable.
Before the paper, I never felt I had a place where I belonged at GW. I signed up for a dozen clubs during my freshman year Welcome Week  – I still get student organization e-mails for meetings I never attend – but I never really followed through. I joined Greek life and loved my sorority, but still felt like I hadn’t found my home away from home.
But 2140 G St. changed all of that. Our quaint and lovably repulsive townhouse has become that home for me, and not just because I spend the majority of my waking – and sometimes sleeping – hours there. It isn’t the walls that make it, but the people found inside.
Priya – Our newest leader, you have some pretty big shoes to fill. Best of luck, and keep a level head. Meow.
Michelle and Francis – You guys are awesome. I don’t know how you do all that you do and make the not-always-easy administrator portraits look great every time. Francis, we will always have Hawthorne Heights.
Josh – My first mate, you were the best contributing editor I could have ever asked for. Hold down the fort next year.
Allison, Madeline and Lauren – The prodo area is the only place where I can happily dance to Justin Bieber, “Call Me Maybe,” Jack’s Mannequin and T-Swift without feeling any degree of judgment. Thank you for making my page as beautiful as you all are.
Lyndsey – Thanks for developing me. You are such an amazing person, and you give me a much-needed dose of nice in my life. I’m so glad we had class together too.
Ferris – You are awesome. I don’t know how you do all you do and do it so well, but I am always impressed and a little astonished.
Andrea – You are truly the funniest person on staff. I can’t wait to visit you in Malaysia with a big bowl of rice for breakfast. Get ready.
Gabe – Oh Gabe. If we were in third grade, I think I would awkwardly send you a “Do you have a crush on me? Circle yes or no” note and you would circle “no,” and I would yell at you, and you would yell at me and then we would be friends. I honestly can’t imagine next year without you, but you are so talented and smart and I know great things are in store. I miss you already.
Radler – This is the one time there aren’t enough words – not even a 1,000-word story to capture how I feel. When we left for Ocean City, I thought I wouldn’t know anyone. I knew I had made the team, but wasn’t sure if I was ready to play. We played, and we played hard. I can’t wait for our adventures to come and to visit you in whatever corner of the world you end up in. No matter where in the world a story takes you, I know you will tackle it with diligence, grace and poise. DTS.
Traynor – I love you even more than I love men’s basketball. Seriously. I don’t know when the sparks began to fly, but it is a fire I never want to put out. You are so smart, beautiful and talented. Don’t ever doubt that. I can’t wait to see what you have in store for next year.
French – You changed my life. I always wanted to be on staff but thought with study abroad, internships and work-study it could never happen. You made it happen – with a lot of pushing along the way – and despite my lackluster knowledge of parallelism, a passionate infatuation with sources and my utter disregard for AP style, you never gave up on me. You weren’t just my editor in chief. You were my shoulder to cry on, the first person to call with a question, the first text after a rough Thursday night and the one who always seemed to have the right answers, no matter if I wanted to hear it or not. Thank you for everything.
To all of Volume 108: Thank you for everything – for the jokes at prodo, hundreds of Whole Foods runs and coffee at Ivory, nights out together and countless hours in the townhouse. You made this the best experience I have had at GW, and I can’t thank you enough for that.
The Hatchet has given me more than I ever thought possible. I have slept on an EMeRG bunk bed, was within 10 inches of Shakira, covered Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke, went to more shows and festivals than I can count and reported on a landmark Supreme Court case.
It defined my time at GW and has begun to define me too.
And the best part of it all? Knowing you’ll always be a part of the team.  -30-

Each year, graduating editors are given 30 final column inches – “30” was historically used to signify the end of a story – to reflect on their time at The Hatchet, published in the final issues of the year.
The Hatchet is unforgiving of carelessness and irresponsibility – by those whom it covers and its creators. Triumphs and errors are recorded in ink, demanding timeliness, dedication and honesty from University leaders and the paper’s editors alike.
But The Hatchet is also unforgiving of time. Churning on year after year, it is indifferent to the students who forfeit a normal college experience to create it. This legacy demands forgoing nights out, grades and friendships, which pile up as Mondays and Thursdays creep insensitively by. Equally as punishing as it is rewarding, The Hatchet defined my time at GW. Yet unsympathetically, it will bowl on past my contribution as soon as I reach out my hand for a diploma.
It’s easy to get caught up in the day-to-day hustle, but looking back, I realize The Hatchet is essentially a relic of the past as soon as it’s published. “The first draft of history,” we always say, and appropriately, the first issues of Volume 108 are already yellowing – so quickly tossed into recycling bins, shuffled off newsstands, filed into blue leather binders that collect dust in 2140 G St.
What we must hope, in our brief turns at the helm, is that we manage to slightly alter its trajectory. We strive to leave some legacy behind, create some small uptick in the arc of progress that means The Hatchet might be better – or at least not worse – for us having made the sacrifices we did.
It’s liberating and horrifying to think of being forced out of The Hatchet microcosm, to admit that most people on this campus don’t know what goes into making the paper, or don’t notice it at all.
My favorite part of production nights is the walk home. Shouting goodnights to the few stragglers still in the townhouse in the early hours of publication day, often receiving only halfhearted nods from the sleepy editors left inside, I pound down the narrow staircase and out the front door. Hopping down the steps, I suck in a huge breath of clean air and pace the few dozen steps toward home, reflecting on the upcoming issue. The ever-present stress of juggling stories with homework, work with socializing, Hatchet life with everything else, melts away as I congratulate myself on another issue survived. Knowing I can no longer tinker with the words, I revel in satisfaction and accept the potential criticism, proud to have done my best to contribute to the paper.
In a way, writing this feels like a walk home. I’ve said that 30 pieces are a self-indulgent tradition. Perhaps that’s true, but they’re also a chance to make our peace with the sacrifices we made for the paper, and reflect on what it gave us in return. Though at times the relationship felt one-sided, I now realize that The Hatchet gave my life an unyielding routine, without which I would not have learned nearly as much as I did in my college years. More importantly, the paper gave me a true family and the chance so few people get – one that I fear other jobs won’t offer: the chance to be part of something bigger than myself.
Of course, the toll claimed at the door of the townhouse at 2140 G St. comes with precious benefits. Aching to avoid the clichés that keep traipsing onto the page, I can only begin to thank the people who shared my time here.
For teaching me and supporting me more than anyone else could. French, your office was my sanctuary this year because, from my first day on staff, you opened it to me – for belly-aching laughs, criticism, tears and love. You challenged me more than anyone ever has, and I’m a better journalist, and person, for it. You leave impossibly big shoes to fill. Remember our pact, and follow your dreams.
For patience, poise and unfailingly high standards. Andrea, your skill and intelligence astound me. Berlin was truly a highlight of my time at GW. If you only live once, I plan to spend it appreciating having a friend so dedicated. I look forward to tackling the roads less traveled, wherever they may be, with Team Campus News, which has and will always only mean you.
For your perspective and your sass. Turley, you are always full of energy and laughter, always there to have a late night heart-to-heart in Ivory’s basement or to comfort me after a tough day. I’ve been intimidated by your talent since we met, something I suspect I will have in common with everyone you ever meet. I am certain you won’t waste it, in whatever you do.
For your smile and your love. Traynor, since the day I met you, I’ve been desperate to impress you, to be counted among the people that can make you belt out that deep belly laugh when you’re not just chuckling to be polite. I may not be a Bruin or have a Boston accent, but I will always appreciate your strength and raw sincerity. Keep DTS alive, and don’t forget me.
For your compassion and your talent. Ferris, never change. Your ability to rise to a challenge and push tough issues make me sure you will succeed in whatever you do. Do not sell your talent short, and more importantly, follow your heart home.
For being my anchor outside The Hatchet. Julie, Patty, Dana, Tatum and Sarah, you’ve gotten me through every challenge, Hatchet or otherwise. I couldn’t exist without you, and wouldn’t want to.

Team photo, thank you for your tireless work to keep desk portraits interesting. Priya, make me proud – I’ll bring word home to Marlboro.
