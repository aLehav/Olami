LGBTQ+ healthcare advocates spoke about health equity policies and their organization during a virtual lecture Monday.
The final lecture of the 2022 Fall Colloquium series of the GW LGBT Health Policy & Practice Graduate Certificate Program was presented by program alumnus Nicholas Grant, president of the GLMA: Health Professionals Advancing LGBTQ+ Equality. Grant spoke alongside GLMA Executive Director Alex Sheldon, and the two focused on GLMA’s efforts to improve LGBTQ+ equity within the healthcare field and the promotion of policies protecting LGBTQ+ patients.
GLMA, founded in 1981, is the largest association of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer healthcare providers in the world. Grant said the organization’s mission is to ensure equality for LGBTQ+ healthcare professionals and individuals and to be a leader in public policy advocacy related to LGBTQ+ health.
“The majority of the work that GLMA engages in is advocacy and the strength of GLMA comes from our multidisciplinary membership and expertise that membership brings to our work,” Grant said.
With a membership of about a thousand healthcare professionals and students, GLMA’s committees focus on specific issues and make policy recommendations to healthcare organizations and lawmakers. Grant referenced these committees, including the Lesbian Health Fund Advisory Committee, which raises funds to provide grants for research focused on the health of queer women.
Sheldon said one of the policy priorities of GLMA is ensuring access to gender-affirming care.
“Most legislators and the folks that are anti-LGBTQ right now are zooming in on our youth and they’re doing so because they want to zoom in and really focus and target on our most vulnerable populations,” Sheldon said. “The bans on best-practice medical care represent the most extreme and coordinated attacks on trans life.”
Sheldon said the organization is working to support gender-affirming care providers who have been attacked and threatened online for their work. They said education policy is a priority for GLMA and the exclusion of transgender people from some educational spaces results in mental and physical health issues.
“Those things actually have health outcomes that are negative and deleterious,” Sheldon said. “Not only would they be less likely to be working with folks to actually access the care that they need, but actually not going to the bathroom when you need to has resulted in long-term issues with urinary tracts and other issues that can stem from stomachs and intestines from not having your actual access to something that is a multi-daily need of everyone.”

Starting Sunday, the most talented soccer players will travel to Qatar to compete in the world’s most-watched sporting event – the FIFA World Cup. And while the United States is still relatively new to soccer, anticipation is at an all-time high with a hopeful new generation led by players Christian Pulisic and Brenden Aaronson representing the country. This year’s World Cup is especially meaningful to me because a series of legends I grew up watching in Germany are ready to retire, including Thomas Müller, Lionel Messi and Karim Benzema. Watching the World Cup is usually never out of the question for me, but for the first time, I won’t be tuning in.
After FIFA selected Qatar as the host back in 2010, U.S. federal prosecutors charged and arrested about two dozen FIFA officials in 2015 for arranging payments to secure Qatar’s 2022 World Cup bid. Even Sepp Blatter, the former president of FIFA who resigned in 2015 over charges of criminal mismanagement, acknowledged the organization’s mishandling in assigning the World Cup to Qatar in 2014 because of “social considerations” and “human rights” concerns. Qatar’s unfair and inhumane treatment of migrant workers is reflective of the overall corruption in the FIFA organization, overshadowing the joys of this event and exposing the true cost of this so-called “beautiful game.”
The 2022 World Cup was nearly entirely built on the exploitation of South Asian, low-income and male migrant workers. Thirty thousand workers were recruited for the World Cup alone – all former subjects of the now-outlawed Kafala system. The system requires migrant workers to have a sponsor, oftentimes European or American corporations who exploited Qatar’s callousness and withheld workers’ passports to keep them from leaving the country.
At least 6,500 estimated workers died building the Qatar World Cup stadium, mostly from heatstroke while working 12 hours a day, seven days a week sometimes without drinking water. If fans held a minute of silence for each of those who died, they would have to remain quiet for the entirety of each of the tournament’s 64 games. When asked about these deaths, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said, “the workers have gained dignity and pride” because of the minor labor reforms their deaths brought to Qatar. While it is one thing to minimize the role FIFA played in these deaths, sarcastically labeling their deaths as dignifying speaks to FIFA’s general disregard for human rights and commitment to sweeping issues under the rug.
Qatar also outlaws all same sex-relations and punishes sexual acts between men as sodomy with up to three years of imprisonment, a law discouraging fans, journalists, sports agents, sponsor representatives and more from attending due to their sexual orientation. Ten team captains from countries including the Netherlands and Germany will wear pride armbands to raise awareness about the mistreatment of the LGBTQ+ community in the country, but because FIFA has not yet approved them, they will bear colors duller and nontraditional compared to the iconic rainbow pride colors to fit with organization regulations. FIFA also vowed to keep politics out of soccer, proving that this form of activism is simply performative.
Western countries have voiced their outrage over Qatar’s human rights abuses after conveniently ignoring the state of basic civil liberties in other World Cup host countries in past years. When Brazil hosted the tournament in 2014, there was little protest over the forced removal of hundreds of thousands of people from their homes to make way for stadiums. Instead, World Cup fans pointed to Brazil’s general passion for the sport to justify their support. Similarly, when Russia hosted the tournament in 2018 while bombing Syria and annexing parts of the Ukraine in 2014, protests were scarce. But people in countries like France are boycotting this year’s event, the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East. And while France is not wrong to question Qatar for its human rights violations, Qataris are asking when France – where islamophobia is on the rise – will begin to defend the human rights of the asylum seekers from Africa and the Middle East on its very own shores or when it will end its exploitation of former colonies.
Granted, some believe that hosting the World Cup in Qatar has led the country to implement a minimum wage and abolish the Kafala system due to international attention and pressure from other countries. But the fear remains that such reforms are only a result of international attention, not a long-term commitment to progress. And the wealth of Qatar and other countries in the Persian Gulf continue to fund popular football clubs like Manchester City and Bayern Munich, showing how wealth still corrupts football on the world stage despite small efforts to bring reform to Qatar.
A boycott at this point will likely not change the fact that Qatar will host the 2022 World Cup – it certainly won’t bring back the lives lost in the building of the stadiums. But dissociating from brands sponsoring the World Cup, avoiding broadcasters charging subscription fees for the matches and not buying official merchandise are some of the many ways to truly change the way FIFA plans its renowned tournaments. Under even the slightest threat of reduced fan revenues, FIFA may pay more attention to such issues in the future.
What defines the World Cup are the communal events it creates for friends to watch the games and enjoy the suspense, arguments and joy all at once together. That can still be found elsewhere. You can hit bars, play pool, do trivia or watch many other sporting events – but the 2022 World Cup shouldn’t be one of them. Come late November, this tournament I’ve grown up loving won’t have my support.

After promising three all-you-can-eat dining halls would open in time for the school year roughly a year in advance, GW conceded their debut would not go as planned this summer. Instead, officials have clung to their dining dollar meal plan this semester while the state of food insecurity that they sought to combat persists across campus and inflation drives sharp food price increases. To address an already-fragile dining system foiled by high prices and inflation, GW should accelerate its long-overdue transition to an unlimited system and offer free meal swipes at its two dining halls so students can afford to eat on campus for the remainder of the semester.
After restaurants in Foggy Bottom raised the price of menu items in response to inflation last spring, GW has failed to pad its students’ pockets with dining dollar balances adjusted to the changes in the economy. The Consumer Price Index indicates inflation spiked the price of food by nearly 11 percent over the last year, a change that reduces the value of students’ stagnant dining dollar balances. Campus staples like GW Deli, Tonic and Carvings were all forced to make food more expensive to accommodate the rising costs of goods in the United States. John Ambrogi, the owner of GW Deli, said current food and produce prices are the highest he has ever seen them.
Students who relied on the same dining dollar meal plan last spring were forced to evaluate which meals mattered most while soaring prices threatened to break their banks under the pressure of inflation. Such financial burden should warrant action from officials who set up residential students for inevitable food insecurity without any extra financial support. Officials are right to transition their dining system to a meal-swipe-oriented plan for the spring semester. GW ought to own up to the shortcomings of its current system and switch over to meal swipes even sooner for residents looking to conserve their dwindling GWorld funds.
GWorld vendors’ rising prices make budgeting a much more difficult task than it should be. Students can spend their dining dollars at 80 partnered private GWorld vendors ranging from Starbucks, with drinks reaching up to $7, to Tonic, where more than half the menu exceeds $15. The University boasts the Meal Deals that GWorld vendors offer, but these student discounts – which can cost between $10 and $18 – only apply to a fifth of those restaurants and are hardly advertised outside of District House.
Students can add funds to their GWorld cards at any time to make up for missing dining dollars, but not every student can afford to do so. The $2,700 allocated to freshmen under the current meal plan amounts to roughly $23 a day, while upperclassmen are left with less than $15 a day. By assigning funds that do not logistically last an entire semester for students who eat three meals a day, GW’s assumption that every student can refill their balance whenever it hits zero is terribly shortsighted.
A conversion to unlimited meal swipes at newly opened dining halls was supposed to be the saving grace for students suffering from food insecurity this fall. Off-brand versions of Chick-fil-a and Chipotle in the District House food court substituted plans for an unlimited dining hall, while delays to the opening of the dining venues in Thurston and Shenkman halls forced officials to pause the switch to meal swipes until the spring. Shenkman’s dining hall will alleviate some of the long lines and overcrowding caused by an overflow of students at the recently opened Thurston dining hall, but the implementation of meal swipes is essential to the success of its new dining venues. And while buying groceries might seem like a simple alternative, Whole Foods remains far too expensive for students to buy groceries with their GWorld funds, which the more affordable Trader Joe’s won’t accept. Without cheaper dining halls, restaurants and grocery stores, students truly have no option for affordable food.
Though October’s consumer price index reading showed that prices were rising at a slightly slower rate across the country, food prices in D.C. shouldn’t be dropping anytime before this semester ends. GW’s switch to a traditional meal swipe system next semester can’t come soon enough, so much so that officials owe students a “soft launch” – one that allocates three meal swipes per day at Thurston’s dining hall and The Eatery at Pelham Commons so students can afford to eat. The country’s fifth most expensive city’s food prices might remain at historic-highs, but buying a coffee shouldn’t mean a student can’t have lunch, too. The University must address its miscalculated meal plan to ensure that students can afford to eat at both GW’s dining halls and GWorld vendors before their funds run dry prior to the semester’s end.

Officials will install temporary walls and scaffolding on the first- and second-floor atriums and the second-floor galleries in December to begin upgrades to the HVAC system, according to a Corcoran release. 
Officials announced plans to renovate the Corcoran School of Art and Design’s Flagg Building Tuesday.
The renovation will restore the Flagg Building’s windows, roof, heating, ventilation and air conditioning system, according to a Corcoran release. The release states most of the work should wrap up by fall 2023, while the window restoration that began this summer is set to finish by the end of 2023.
The construction work inside the building is expected to take place Monday to Friday from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. starting in January, the release states. Workers will conduct “significantly disruptive” work during early mornings or after hours when possible, while classes and exhibitions move to avoid interruptions, according to the release.
“We apologize for any inconvenience this work may cause, and we will endeavor to minimize disruptions to your academic or work routines,” the release states.
The release states that officials are removing and restoring existing windows to “meet historic restoration requirements” after the Historic Preservation Review Board designated most parts of the building’s inside as a historic landmark in 2015. Window renovations will also bolster how the Flagg Building, which is located on 17th Street across from the Ellipse, “regulates” its environment, the release states. 
The release also states that officials will install temporary walls and scaffolding on the first- and second-floor atriums and the second-floor galleries in December to begin upgrades to the HVAC system. Officials are “expected” to complete the atrium upgrades by January, but scaffolding will be in place until fall 2023. 
The University signed an agreement with Corcoran and the National Gallery of Art in 2014, beginning a series of construction projects in the Flagg Building, including a two-year, $80 million renovation that added classrooms, gallery space, ramps, elevators and additional bathrooms and updated the building’s safety, mechanical and electrical utilities in 2018.
But after the 2018 renovations, the Flagg Building experienced water leaks from ceilings, which officials fixed the roof the following year.
“You will continue to receive updates on this project through physical building signs, monthly emails and online at go.gwu.edu/reno,” the release states.

Bishop’s 44 points are the most points a GW player has scored in a game since the Colonials entered the A-10 in 1982 and the most any player has scored in the country this season.
The Colonials recorded their first loss of the season after traveling to Long Island to take on Hofstra Monday, with senior guard James Bishop netting in a career-high 44 points.
The Colonials (2-1) were locked in a hard-fought battle with the Pride (3-0) all game, but Hofstra pulled away at the end with a 9–0 run that secured them the win. Bishop’s 44 points are the most points a GW player has scored in a game since the Colonials entered the A-10 in 1982 and the most any player has scored in the country so far this season.
Bishop finished just five points shy of alumnus and former NBA player Joe Holup’s 49-point all-time school record in 1956.
“He took 24 shots, but 44 points and 24 shots is a hell of a night,” Head Coach Chris Caputo said in a post-game interview. “He’s pretty efficient in that regard, I definitely think he’s a guy who should be considered an all-conference player and potentially the player of the year.”
Caputo said the team struggled to press the Hofstra offense from entering the paint. He said they took time learning how to adjust to the 3-point scoring, allowing the Pride to take advantage.
Graduate student guard Brendan Adams hit double figures for the third straight game with 15 points, followed by senior forward Hunter Dean who put up 10.
Redshirt senior guard Aaron Estrada led the Pride with 33 points and five rebounds while shooting 6 for 10 from the 3-point line. Redshirt senior guard Tyler Thomas scored 17 points for the Pride on a .508 shooting percentage.
Hofstra kicked off the game with a 9–3 run while the Colonials quickly fell behind at the top of the first half. GW started to gain momentum with a 3-pointer by senior forward Brendan Adams before entering a 5-point run in the final 10 minutes.
The Pride did not back down, holding on to a firm 27-20 lead after a 3-pointer from Estrada to keep the Colonials at bay in the final seven minutes of the game. Freshman guard Maximus Edwards supported the GW offense by drilling a 3-pointer to kickstart the Colonials’ 7-point run of the final seven minutes but were only able to chip down the lead 23-29.
Hofstra regained possession with a final 11-point run that ended the first half with an 11-point lead for the Pride. The Colonials were left scoreless in the final two minutes as they could not move their offense back into the paint, marking a 37-48 score for the half.
“We played a number of different defenses by man played zone, the press couple of verses, we played different pick and roll coverages as the game goes on, and especially because of Estrada’s shotmaking ability, we really needed to adjust to him,” Caputo said. “Obviously, there are other guys, are very good as well, in particular, Thomas made two threes, and they got some good shots making off the bench as well.”
After the break, the Colonials switched to a zone defense that sparked a 7-point run that brought them back into the game, with Bishop guiding the team. Hofstra eventually was able to overcome the Colonials defense hitting six 3-pointers in six minutes to pull ahead with a 68-64 lead.
Bishop countered the Pride with a 3-pointer that gave GW a 71-70 lead with five minutes left. But the Hofstra team regained possession and entered a 5-point run that would earn their win for the night.
The GW offense entered the game with a leading A-10 field goal percentage as they shot at a .547 clip from the floor while netting 11 3-pointers, marking the team three-straight games reaching the 80th point threshold for the first time since 2018.
Caputo took his initial statement at the post-game interview to talk about the events at UVA in Charlottesville, where he said he was “deeply saddened by the events.”
“It’s very, very disheartening to think that college students who were on a field trip and still very bright futures ahead of them were killed the way they were killed,” Caputo said in the post-game interview. “Obviously, it can happen anywhere in this country, but now it was the university setting where people should be saved. It’s just very, very sad to me that this keeps happening in the United States, I want to just extend my condolences to everybody in Charlottesville.”
The Colonials will play four home games that kick off on Friday against Maryland Eastern Shore. Tipoff is scheduled for 7 p.m. and will be available on ESPN+.

Freshman guard Nya Robertson lit up the box score, scoring 27 points and shooting above 60 percent on the night including a four for seven showing from deep.
Women’s basketball notched their second win of the season Monday, toppling Howard 83-62 after taking off with an early lead in a high-scoring first quarter.
The Colonials (2-1) put 26 on the board in the first quarter on their way to the program’s highest-scoring game since 2015, powered by freshman guard Nya Robertson who nailed four shots from 3-point range. The GW team was in sync on both sides of the court, beating down the Bison (1-2) with 20 turnover points and a powerful performance from the bench, which accounted for 53 points in total.
Graduate student Mia Lakstigala got the action started for GW when she knocked down a three in the first 14 seconds off an assist by junior guard Asjah Innis. Innis scored a bucket of her own minutes later on a tough mid-range jumper to put the Colonials up 6. Innis would go on to score 10 points, shooting 5 of 7 shooting from the field.
Freshman guard Nya Robertson extended the lead with two minutes left in the first quarter on a contested fast break layup. Robertson, in just her third collegiate game, lit up the box score, scoring 27 points and shooting above 60 percent on the night including a 4 for 7 showing from deep.
“Some of the things that are outstanding about Nya is just her ability to play with or without the ball in her hands and we have some veterans around her as well that really help out,” Head Coach Caroline McCombs said in a post-game interview. “She’s learning and I think our system and style allows her to get the shots that she can be successful at shooting.”
To seal off the first quarter, junior guard Aurea Gingras knocked down a 3-pointer that put GW up 9 with just 5 seconds remaining on the clock.
The second quarter didn’t feature the same shooting display as the first, but the Colonials still managed to extend their lead. After the Bison cut their deficit to 7 in the early minutes of the quarter, GW would go on a 15-7 run on their way to a 15-point halftime lead.
Redshirt senior forward Mayowa Taiwo pulled down 6 rebounds in the quarter, tallying a game high 14 through four quarters.
“Her being a dominant force down low is really important for us,” McCombs said of Taiwo’s solid presence in the paint.
The third quarter followed a similar pattern as the second, with the Bison managing to trim the lead early before a late GW run put it out of reach. This time Robertson led the charge, dropping 11 in the quarter, including three makes from long range.
The Colonials ended the quarter up 18, their largest lead of the night to that point, propelled by a 4 for 8 shooting performance from beyond the arc.
The lead never fell below 15 points in the fourth quarter, and McCombs began to cycle out some of her starters for reserves, allowing 11 different players to see the floor.
GW not only set its highest score of the young season but also tallied the most points since dropping 85 points against Grambling State in 2015. The Colonials’ 12 3-pointers fell at a 48 percent clip, nearly matching the 52 percent shooting percentage from the floor.
The bench also showed up for GW, scoring 53 points while Howard’s reserves only managed 19.
“We do believe everyone can come in and contribute,” McCombs said. “I think we might have played 10 people in that first quarter as well. So I thought we were pretty deep in our rotation.”
The Colonials will take on American University in another District showdown Thursday at 7 p.m.

Each component of the dish – from the schmear to the soft texture of the bread – left me satiated without feeling too stuffed as opposed to other breakfast toasts that tend to go overboard on the toppings.
For busy students on the lookout for a cafe with tasty breakfast bites, impeccable coffee and a pleasant atmosphere to meet all their studying needs, Slipstream Cafe could easily become your next staple.
Although it is a 10 minute drive from campus, Slipstream’s location in Logan Circle offers a reprieve from the crowds of decaffeinated students in Foggy Bottom. The atmospheric cafe boasts an impressive array of coffee options, including seasonal drinks and coffee infused cocktails, as well as simple yet enticing breakfast options, optimal for a quick study bite rather than a hearty meal.
My journey out of Foggy Bottom to Logan Circle was a refreshing one. Slipstream’s location on 14th Street is charming, the streets dotted with passersby and artwork from local Logan Circle artists. Stepping inside the cafe past the few outdoor tables, I took in the brightly lit space and chic farmhouse decor and chose a spot toward the front where I could people-watch through the large windows facing the picturesque street lined with autumn leaves.
Like most cafes in the District, Slipstream’s environment was bustling, but there were still plenty of spots available on a bright but chilly Sunday afternoon. Instead of table service, patrons are invited to order from QR codes at each table. The baristas behind the counter were friendly and helpful, coming over to chat and ask how I was enjoying my order, which arrived promptly in about seven minutes.
The menu had a variety of classic breakfast picks like the breakfast sandwich ($9.90), granola bowl ($9.50) and breakfast burrito ($9). Slipstream also serves lunch after 11 a.m., with around five sandwich options ranging from $9.50 to $13.50. There is also a specialty seasonal latte called the Sweater Weather with cinnamon, tahini, vanilla, orange zest and oat milk ($6).
It’s easy to get lost on a large coffee menu, but Slipstream presents an organized assortment of coffee flavor profiles with corresponding colors outlining the roaster, tasting notes and geographic origin of each. Coffee grounds from each of the roasters are available for sale starting at $20.
I chose to try the salmon toast ($13.50) from the breakfast menu along with one of the iced vanilla lattes ($5) to provide a quick midday pick-me-up in the midst of studying for finals.
The salmon toast featured a slice of lightly toasted sourdough, spread with a house-made dill caper schmear and layered with a few pieces of smoked salmon. Thinly sliced radishes and a handful of herbs adorned the toast, providing an optimal garnish that aided in both texture and flavor.
Each aspect of the salmon toast was just as delectable as it was aesthetically pleasing. I expected it to be served with cream cheese, but the dill schmear was by far the highlight of the dish, not too heavy and the right complement to the herbs that gave the toast a fresh, earthy taste. The schmear was noticeably house-made, without the artificial taste of something out of a jar.
The radishes were the cherry on top, providing a crunch that contrasted the naturally gummier texture of the salmon. Each component of the dish – from the schmear to the soft texture of the bread – left me satiated without feeling too stuffed as opposed to other breakfast toasts that tend to go overboard on the toppings.
Slipstream is a pleasant place to grab a drink and bite. The portion of food was the ideal amount to snack on while I worked, and the soft chatter of those working around me created a lovely ambiance that made me want to stick around long after I’d taken the last sip of my coffee.

Through the star-studded cast’s heartfelt performance of a reverent script, audiences are immersed in a film that above all else celebrates the life and continues the legacy of a king.
The long-awaited sequel to Marvel’s iconic “Black Panther” was released in theaters Friday, arriving two years after the death of Oscar nominee Chadwick Boseman, who played superhero and King T’Challa.
“Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” tells more than just a comic book story. Through the star-studded cast’s heartfelt performance of a reverent script, audiences are immersed in a film that, above all else, celebrates the life and continues the legacy of a king.
The first film of the franchise, “Black Panther,” premiered in 2018, becoming an international sensation and breaking box office records. The film grossed $202 million on its opening weekend alone and went on to earn multiple Academy Award nominations. But what drew me and many others to the theater two years ago was the promise of seeing Boseman become the first Black superhero to have their own franchise and headline the big screen. “Black Panther” became one of the few blockbuster films in history to feature an all-Black ensemble while selling out theaters around the globe.
But most importantly, Black Panther became an icon for young children of color who had yet to see a hero who looked like them on screen. The character set a precedent for the on-screen portrayal of more superheroes of color, like Spiderman Miles Morales, Moon Knight and Ms. Marvel, who kids could look up to, continue to be empowered by and aspire to embody as they grew up. So when Boseman passed away August 2020 after fighting a private battle with colon cancer, audiences and writers alike were especially cognisant of what a sequel would mean for the legacy of such an inspiration.
How does one celebrate life while it’s the loss they’re grieving? Who inherits a legacy? Who has to step up to protect your own when your people are under attack? These are questions filmmakers posed to audiences while telling the story of “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” knowing full well they transcended far beyond the cinematic universe.
Writers and actors of “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” intentionally celebrate Boseman’s legacy through the modem in which he touched the lives of so many – through film, through acting and through Black Panther. As the sequel parallels the loss of King T’Challa with the real-life loss of Boseman, cast members like Letitia Wright, Angela Bassett, Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong’o give outstanding performances that leave audiences with a palpable sense of the raw emotion and revere they bring to the screen.
As their respective characters Princess Shuri, Queen Ramonda, Okoye, and Nakia navigate life without T’Challa and the Black Panther, the characters find themselves answering those essential questions about grief, legacy and protecting one’s own. And as old threats, like nations greedy for their protected resources, face Wakanda, and newer ones arise, our favorite Wakandans find ways to overcome in more ways than one.
“Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” introduces a new antagonist named Namor, the Feathered Serpent God, played by Tenoch Huerta, a Mexican actor who has starred in a number of films in Latin American and Spain in addition to Netflix’s Narcos: Mexico. What often sets the “Black Panther” franchise apart from other superhero movies is that the film’s antagonists are products of the realities of historical evils like colonialization, national greed and slavery. Similar to Micheal B. Jordan’s Killmonger, Huerta’s Namor emerges less as a villain and more as an anti-hero, waging war to avenge the enslaved, protect his own and reclaim stolen land. 
Huerta gives a stunning performance – in the telling of his origin story, audiences are transported to the gorgeous tropical scenery of ancient Mesoamerica. The sequel also unveils immersive underwater visuals as filmmakers display their talented artistic eye for gorgeous scenes that propel a story full of love, heartbreak and reverence along.
This sequel meets every expectation and reveals some surprises many viewers may not have even anticipated. But one thing was clear when watching the film. “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” did not just pay homage to a man who was a pillar to the Black Panther universe. It intentionally continued Boseman’s legacy. As Wright’s character Princess Shuri and many others iterate throughout the film, T’Challa is dead, but he is not gone – and neither is the Black Panther.

GW sued Factory Mutual Insurance Company late last year in an effort to force the company to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in COVID-related damages.
An insurance company filed a document Monday asking the D.C. Court of Appeals not to consider the question of whether the presence of COVID-19 droplets cause “physical loss and damage” in the next stage of GW’s lawsuit against the company.
GW last week asked the court to require a judge to rule whether the presence of COVID-19 droplets counts as damage for the purposes of an insurance policy that GW purchased in 2019. GW sued Factory Mutual Insurance Company late last year in an effort to force the company to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in COVID-related damages after GW moved online during the spread of COVID, but a judge dismissed the case earlier this year saying COVID droplets did not constitute physical damage under the insurance policy.
GW appealed to the D.C. Court of Appeals last week to ask judges to consider the question of whether COVID droplets constituted damage, but Factory Mutual fought back Monday, saying there was no need to consider the question. Factory Mutual’s attorneys referenced District Court Judge Dabney Friedrich’s September lawsuit dismissal, who ruled in the company’s favor by stating the droplets did not constitute enough damage to be considered “tangible alterations” to GW property for insurance purposes because virus droplets can be cleaned off of surfaces.
“This is not the rare exception requiring guidance from the D.C. Court of Appeals,” the motion states.
Last year, GW’s lawyers said COVID-19 droplets “damaged” buildings, making them unusable and falling under the physical damages insurance policy GW bought from the company. University officials said financial strains caused by the pandemic cost the University “hundreds of millions” of dollars in last year’s lawsuit and separately said the pandemic led to a $180 million budget gap during the 2021 fiscal year.
Factory Mutual defended Friedrich’s September dismissal in the Monday motion, referencing the judge’s ruling that insurance coverage was unavailable to the University because of “unambiguous” texts and precedent. The document states that despite the lack of D.C. precedent specifically addressing COVID-19 in coverage context, “hundreds” of other federal, district and appellate courts have come to the same “common sense” ruling as Friedrich, that COVID droplets don’t cause physical damage.
“That argument falls far short,” the document states. “This Court regularly resolves contract disputes in diversity cases and does not burden state courts with certified questions merely because there is no precedent that is factually directly on point.”
The University’s motion earlier this month states there is undetermined D.C. law on whether COVID droplets present “physical loss and damages,” referencing similar cases being considered in other state courts like Maryland and Vermont, some of whom ruled in the insured’s favor.

The new extension, which provides rail connections to stations including Ashburn, Loudoun Gateway and Washington Dulles International Airport with 11.4 new miles of track, is the product of more than 12 years of construction and $3 billion in funding.
Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority officials celebrated the grand opening of six new Northern Virginia Metro stations to riders Tuesday, marking the completion of the region’s Silver Line extension project after more than a decade of construction.
The new extension, which provides rail connections to stations including Ashburn, Loudoun Gateway and Washington Dulles International Airport with 11.4 new miles of track, is the product of more than 12 years of construction and $3 billion in funding. Officials like D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg visited the new stations Tuesday along with 100 Metro riders during the Silver Line Extension’s inaugural train ride, according to a Metro news release.
Bowser said the extension – WMATA’s largest in eight years – is a “game changer” for the city and region that will bring new possibilities for business and travel. She said the stations’ debut marks the beginning of riders’ uninterrupted access to Dulles airport via public transportation, which is one of the city’s primary hubs for air travel with almost 400 domestic and international flights arriving and departing per day.
“Dulles was already known for the many direct flights it offers to and from destinations across the country and around the world, and now we finally have a direct and convenient connection from Dulles to downtown D.C.,” Bowser said in the release.
The total travel time for riders who board the Silver Line at the existing Wiehle-Reston East stop and get off at the final northernmost Ashburn stop is about 22 minutes, according to a Washington Post report. Silver Line trains will run every 15 minutes, but wait times will decrease to 10 minutes during rush hour as WMATA begins servicing more 7000-series trains.
WMATA officials said in an October release that the extension’s opening hinged on the number of 7000-series trains being approved to return to operation, teasing that the extension could be ready to operate by Thanksgiving. Metro removed its 7000-series railcar fleet from operations last year after a derailment on the Blue Line in October, but officials reintroduced 20 of the cars back into service between June and September as safety inspections on the 7000-series cars continued.
The opening of the Silver Line stations also marks the end of the two-phase Silver Line expansion plan that began construction in 2009, after officials added six stops in Virginia’s Fairfax County in 2014, completing phase one. Officials began construction for the second phase in 2014, originally planning to open the extension in 2018, but pushed back the debut due to construction complications and the COVID-19 pandemic.
WMATA officials said in a release Tuesday that the extension provides “high quality, high capacity” transit between the Dulles corridor and the District and is among the largest capital construction projects in the country.
“The completion of the Silver Line means a better, greener, more affordable way to get to work, school, shopping, entertainment and events, as well as easy access to Washington Dulles International Airport, a gateway to the world,” Metro General Manager and Chief Executive Officer Randy Clarke said in the release. “As one of the largest construction projects in the United States, the Silver Line provides high-quality, high-capacity transit service between the Dulles corridor, Downtown D.C. and Prince George’s County, Maryland.”
