Men's basketball will limp into the A-10 tournament with a dismal record and reduced roster.
With just eight Atlantic 10 games under its belt, men’s basketball will now turn its attention to the A-10 tournament, where one loss ends the season.
The Colonials (4-11, 3-5 A-10) will enter the tournament as either the No. 11 or No. 12 seed, and they will face either Saint Joseph’s or Fordham. After experiencing a 35-day COVID-19 pause, an ever-changing roster and 10 canceled games, head coach Jamion Christian said his team has earned the opportunity to close out the season on its own terms.
“We’ve been through a lot,” Christian said after the team’s loss to St. Bonaventure. “A lot of teams have been through a lot. I think we’ve been through more than most teams, and we’ve earned the right to finish this thing how we want to finish it. And so let’s get our collective energy in the right place so we can go tackle it, and let’s expect more opportunities after that.”
The last time the squad entered the tournament at the No. 12 spot was during the 2018-19 season. That year’s team won just eight games, including four in conference play. Last season, the squad was seeded No. 11 and bowed out in the first round after a loss to Fordham. The tournament was canceled prior to completion as the COVID-19 pandemic reached the United States.
This season, the Colonials have played just a handful of their 13 league opponents – Fordham, Duquesne, VCU, Dayton, Rhode Island, George Mason and St. Bonaventure. In the squad’s conference opener, GW routed Fordham 71–47. But the team has yet to meet with Saint Joseph’s, who holds a 2-11 A-10 record and 3-14 overall record.
GW also saw members of the team leave midseason, and COVID-19 disruptions led to 10 canceled games. After an abysmal 1-6 nonconference slate, the team’s roster shrunk from 16 to 13 as senior guard Maceo Jack, senior forward Ace Stallings and sophomore guard Jameer Nelson Jr. left the team in December. Later in the season, Christian said junior forward Sloan Seymour opted out.
“He’s not going to be joining us for the rest of the year,” Christian said. “We wish him the very best, hoping that he’s doing well, and we know he’s watching and supporting us, but we won’t see him for the remainder of the season.”
Seymour played in 12 games without a start. He shot at a .368 clip from three-point range and averaged 12.3 minutes and 4.3 points per game.
The challenges didn’t let up in the new year. After kicking off conference play with wins over Fordham and Duquesne, men’s basketball was rolling into its league slate near the top of the A-10 standings. But a District-wide curfew after the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol and a positive test among a staff member in the team’s traveling party sidelined the Colonials for two straight games.
The squad came back a day after the positive test, now armed with junior forward Ricky Lindo Jr., who originally decided to sit out the 2020-21 season but opted to suit up to help his team. Lindo Jr. has since recorded three double-doubles and averages 11 points and 9.4 rebounds per contest.
The Colonials returned to play Jan. 13 for two games but hit another roadblock shortly after when Christian announced he had tested positive for the virus. From there, the team went on a 35-day hiatus, postponing multiple games along the way.
Finally returning to action Feb. 21, the squad notched a win against Rhode Island, but it dropped its subsequent two matchups against George Mason and St. Bonaventure. Christian said his team will take a few days to “refresh” and get ready for the emotional control needed to succeed in the tournament.
“We’ll refresh, mentally, physically first,” he said. “We’ll do a great job of that and then getting prepared, getting ready to play. Conference tournament basketball is all about emotional control and emotional understanding. We will do a great job and be ready to go do that.”
The A-10 tournament, which is scheduled to begin Wednesday, was originally set to start a week later. But COVID-19 disruptions prompted the league to edit its start dates, opting to play the first round through semifinals March 3 through March 6 and the championship game March 14. All games will be played at Richmond and VCU, and Dayton will host the championship.
The adjusted timeline left no room for the Colonials to reschedule its 10 postponed games, leaving the team with just eight conference matchups – the lowest number among all A-10 teams.
Despite the challenges and setbacks, Christian said the tournament opens a clean slate for the team to regroup and get back on track to end the season on the right note.
“Everyone is going to be a little tired, that’s sort of part of it, but you’re going to be playing with adrenaline,” he said. “That’s part of the tournament. That’s the best part of the year. It’s the time of year when magical things happen. It’s a chance for everybody to get their collective energy together in one place and give us the opportunity to win.”
The Colonials will return to action Wednesday to take on either Fordham or Saint Joseph’s. Tipoff is still to be determined, but the squad will open tournament action at VCU’s home court in the Siegel Center.

The women's soccer team took a 4-0 loss to Georgetown ahead of its home opener Thursday. 
With fall and spring sports playing during the spring semester amid the COVID-19 pandemic, keep up to date with weekly recaps of home and away games.
Tuesday
Men’s soccer
The Colonials (1-1) hit the road for the first time this season, taking UMBC (1-0) to the wire in a 0–1 double overtime loss. GW outshot the Retrievers 14-12 and launched four more balls on frame. Senior forward Oscar Haynes Brown and graduate student midfielder Sandro Weber pelted three shots apiece, but freshman goalkeeper Quantrell Jones made nine saves to keep a clean sheet.
In the 105th minute, freshman forward Taylor Calheira squeaked a ball by sophomore goalkeeper Justin Grady, who played the full game between the pipes for GW.
The squad will be back in action Saturday to take on James Madison at 7 p.m.
Friday
Women’s tennis
The squad (1-1) bounced back from a season-opening loss to dominate Coppin State (0-3) 7–0. Sophomores Luciana Kunkel and Sarah Bodewes, playing in the No. 2 doubles pairing, dominated their match, winning by a clear 6–0 decision.
Freshman Stella Wiesemann and graduate student Alexis Nelson nabbed the other doubles victory at the No. 1 spot, giving the Colonials the early lead heading into singles matches. All six spots emerged victorious, with Wiesemann, Kunkel and Bodewes winning in straight sets.
The Colonials will be back in action March 7 at Delaware after their Sunday matchup with James Madison was postponed.
Saturday
Men’s water polo
In the first two of three games this weekend, men’s water polo (1-3, 0-3 MAWPC) dropped a doubleheader to No. 9 Navy (6-1, 3-1 MAWPC) and Bucknell (3-1, 3-1 MAWPC). In the first game against the Midshipmen, the Colonials were narrowly defeated 16–12. The squad led after the first frame, but offensive bursts in the second and fourth quarters gave Navy the advantage. Senior utility player Andras Levai led the team with four goals.
In the second game of the day, one goal was the difference in an 8–7 matchup with Bucknell. Senior center Gabriele Simonti notched three goals and a team-high four blocks, and freshman goalkeeper Luca Castorina tabbed 17 saves in the effort.
The squad faced another matchup Sunday.
Lacrosse
Navy (3-1) trounced the Colonials (0-1) in its season-opener 22–2. The Midshipmen scored early and often, notching 14 unanswered goals in the first half. The squad almost averaged a goal every two minutes. GW got on the board within the first two minutes of the second half after senior attacker Ionna Mantzouratos found the back of the net.
Navy responded with a five-goal streak, and junior attacker Sophia Watkinson tacked on GW’s final goal with 13 minutes to play. Three more scores from the Midshipmen buried the Colonials further. GW was only able to get six shots, three of which were on goal, while Navy threw 46 shots, 36 of which were on goal, at GW’s goaltenders.
The squad will play again Saturday at Old Dominion at 1 p.m.
Volleyball
The Colonials (1-7, 0-5 A-10) dropped its third straight game to Rhode Island (3-4, 2-1 A-10) in straight sets. The squad swung at a .138 clip, recording 24 kills on the road. But the Rams’ offense dominated the matchup as they notched 48 kills on a 34.3 attacking percentage. Junior outside hitter Paz Dozie-Nnamah paced the squad with six kills and senior middle blocker Callie Fauntleroy followed up with five of her own.
The squad narrowly lost the first set by a slim 25–20 margin. But the Rams turned up the heat in the second and third sets, winning them by nine and 10 points, respectively.
GW will be back in action Saturday to take on Fordham in the Smith Center. First serve is slated for 1 p.m.
Men’s swimming and diving
Two divers – sophomore Spencer Bystrom and senior Nick Tomczyk – competed at the James Madison Duke Dog Invitational. Bystrom led the field for the men’s 3M, earning a 303.15 and the victory. He also took second in the men’s 1M, and Tomczyk finished right behind him at No. 3 with a score of 269.85. Tomczyk also nabbed No. 4 in the 3M competition.
Women’s swimming and diving
Sophomore Caitlin Inall and junior Carolina Stocchi represented GW at the James Madison Duke Dog Invitational on the women’s side. Inall paced the Colonials on the 1M and 3M, earning No. 9 and No. 10 finishes. Stocchi followed behind with No. 13 and No. 16 finishes, respectively, in the same events.
Softball
The Colonials (0-3) fell to Virginia (4-5, 2-3 ACC) and James Madison (2-0) in its doubleheader to kick off the season. Against the Cavaliers, redshirt junior utility player Sierra Lange singled in the fourth and scored on a fielder’s choice to give GW the early lead. Virginia found the scoresheet in the bottom of the sixth, batting in two runs from a triple and scoring a runner on an error. The squad recorded one more run in the seventh but couldn’t make up the deficit.
Graduate student utility player Faith Weber singled up the middle to give GW the edge in the bottom of the second and a Lange single in the bottom of the fifth pushed the lead to 3–1. Graduate student utility player Jessica Linquist brought another run in with one inning to play. But the Dukes scored seven unanswered runs in the seventh inning to walk away with the comeback victory.
Sunday
Men’s water polo
The Colonials closed out the regular season, earning their first win of the season over La Salle (2-4, 2-4 MAWPC) 9–8. The team jumped out to an early 3–1 lead after the first frame and kept a one-goal advantage heading into the half. GW held a steady 8–6 lead heading into the fourth quarter before La Salle knotted the game at eight in the final frame. Levai netted the game-winner with just under three minutes to play.
Five different Colonials scored, and Levai led the pack with three goals. Castorina stopped 14 Explorer attempts in his first collegiate victory.
The second game of the doubleheader against Navy was canceled, and GW will be back in business Saturday at the Mid-Atlantic Water Polo Conference Championship.
Softball
The squad returned to action for another doubleheader against Virginia. The Cavaliers started game one off hot, scoring two runs in the first inning. The Colonials responded in the top of the second to take a 3–2 lead thanks to a RBI from Linquist and Lange. Virginia knotted the score in the bottom of the sixth, sending GW into extra innings for the first time this year. A double to left center would give the Cavaliers the walk-off win and GW’s third loss of the weekend.
GW wrapped the weekend winless as it fell to Virginia in game two of the doubleheader. After four scoreless innings, Virginia scored in the bottom of the fifth. The Cavaliers would add two more runs in the next inning. Freshman pitcher Alexa Williams scored the Colonials’ lone run of the game, smashing a home run over the center field wall.
GW will play again Saturday against Mount Saint Mary’s for its home opener. First pitch is slated for noon.
Women’s soccer
The Colonials (0-1) kicked off the season with a 4–0 loss to Georgetown (2-0). The Hoyas, who paced two goals each half, outshot GW 16-5. The Colonials only placed two shots on frame. Junior midfielder Maria Pereja and senior midfielder Kelly Amador took all five shots for the team, with Pereja leading the team with three shots.
Redshirt sophomore goalkeeper Tamaki Machi started in goal and notched four saves. Junior goalkeeper Erica Lorenzana also saw nearly 10 minutes of action between the pipes and didn’t face a shot.
The squad will host Delaware State Thursday at 3 p.m. in its home opener.
Men’s swimming and diving
The squad found the top of the podium four times in its dual meet with Navy but couldn’t catch up to the Midshipmen, who notched 55 more points on the day. Sophomore Zach Hu nabbed first place finishes in the 500 yard freestyle and the 1,000 yard freestyle. Freshman Karol Mlynarczyk took the No. 1 spot in the 100 yard backstroke with a time of 47.44. Sophomore Eddie Cosic paced the field in the 200 yard breaststroke with a 2:12.39.
The men’s program will be back in action March 5 at the Navy Invitational.
Women’s swimming and diving
On the women’s side, swimmers grabbed 64 points with two finishes atop the podium but still trailed the Midshipmen’s 162 points. The Colonials swept the top-three finishes in the 200 yard IM with senior Andrea Ho, junior Ann Juneau and junior Isabel Berdecio claiming the No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 spots, respectively. Ho and Juneau also combined with freshmen Ashley Khoo and Marlee Rickert to nab the 400 yard freestyle relay victory with a time of 3:36.19.
The Colonials will return to the pool March 5 at the Navy Invitational.

Congrats, GW – you’ve made it 200 years strong.
Since your establishment two centuries ago, you’ve changed nicknames, altered admissions practices and participated in tons of protests. In commemoration of this milestone, the editorial board deliberated GW’s best and worst moments. Opinions editor Hannah Thacker looks into the history of the Colonials moniker; contributing opinions editor Andrew Sugrue lays out the evolution of GW’s tuition costs; culture editor Anna Boone comments on campus expansion; managing editor Parth Kotak breaks down the racial history of GW; managing director Kiran Hoeffner-Shah talks about student activism; design editor Olivia Columbus weighs in on gender equality; and sports editor Emily Maise sheds light on the history of sports.
From each member of the editorial board, here’s a look at some of the University’s highs and lows over the years, as well as what we can learn from these events moving forward:
Hannah Thacker, opinions editor

In 1926, GW rebranded itself as the Colonials amid dissatisfaction from students over the former name, the “Hatcheteers.” Since the change, the University has pretty much altered everything around campus, from sports jerseys to store apparel. In hindsight, switching to a new nickname was good – it demonstrated that officials were listening to students. But as we reflect on GW’s history and look to prosper, we need to look into another change.
The Colonials moniker has had its fair share of criticism, and the editorial board has joined several student organizations in calls for it to be removed. The concerns are valid – the Colonials moniker is divisive and harmful to several student groups. It’s been time for the University to adopt a more respectful nickname, and officials should use this period of reflection to ditch it once and for all.
Andrew Sugrue, contributing opinions editor
GW spent its early decades as a commuter school. Low tuition and the D.C. location made it an ideal choice for students looking to split time between college and building their careers. Notable alumni like former Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., were among the many up-and-coming professionals who got a quality education on the cheap. But things changed a bit in the ’90s – GW reinvented itself as the more traditional campus we know today. Tuition began to soar, with the University’s yearly cost becoming the highest in the nation at one point.
Now, GW has a reputation as a pricey institution. Its career-building bona fides remain incredibly strong – GW is the internship capital of the American higher education system, and programs like the Elliott School of International Affairs and the School of Media and Public Affairs are top-notch feeders into the professional world. But the skyrocketing tuition prices that began a few decades ago helped blaze the trail for the exorbitant cost of attendance that hallmarks American higher education today.

During his time as University president, from 1965 to 1988, Lloyd Elliot oversaw the building of three libraries: Melvin Gelman Library, Jacob Burns Law Library and Paul Himmelfarb Health Sciences Library. He was also responsible for the creation of the Academic Center, Funger Hall, The Charles E. Smith Center for Physical Education and Athletics and the Cloyd Heck Marvin Student Center.
While athletes and introverted nature fiends might disagree, the affiliation of the Mount Vernon Campus to the University, which was established in 1999, is inefficient and confusing. For some, the Vern is quiet and relaxing, and for other students it is infuriating and a waste of time. GW has a chance to invest more in the campus or nix it, especially while it’s cleared out during the pandemic.
Parth Kotak, managing editor
Over the course of its two centuries of existence, GW, a predominately White institution, has had a fraught relationship with racial minorities on campus, including a particularly thorny history involving Black students. An infamous letter penned by racist then-University President Cloyd Marvin barred a Black applicant from consideration and laid bare that GW was a school for Whites only, an attitude that attracted controversy when the school barred Black theatergoers from viewing Lisner Auditorium’s first commercial production in 1946.
Ultimately, administrators were forced to integrate the school in 1954 following the Supreme Court’s decision in Brown v. Board of Education. In the years since, the institution has tried to become a more welcoming place for Black and other minority students. Although GW is celebrating its 200th anniversary this year, for hundreds of students on campus, GW’s gates were closed to them until about 67 years ago – and every member of the GW community should endeavor to ensure that those students who until recently were barred feel like full citizens of GW’s campus.
Kiran Hoeffner-Shah, managing director
Hannah Thacker | Opinions Editor
For 200 years, students have used their prime location in the District to protest wars, policies and injustices. At the height of the Vietnam War, students used Thurston Hall to mobilize protests and wash down demonstrators who had been stung by tear gas. Later, students continued their opposition to war – protesting against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Students protested a speaking engagement with former Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, joined Black Lives Matter protesters in the District and marched to the White House to object to former President Donald Trump’s election.
For several of those years, GW was considered among the most politically active schools in the country. Everyone has experienced the Hilltern who sees themselves as the future president or the security policy concentration future warmonger. But sometimes GW’s political activity leaks into student government. Three times in the Student Association’s history, a candidate has attempted to abolish it. But GW’s propensity for scandals in student politics does not only include the SA. Most recently, members of the GW College Democrats’ executive board were accused of rigging an election for a freshman representative, prompting half of the board to resign.
Political activity on campus can be good, but it can also be detrimental to a healthy campus life. Sometimes, students take it too far.
Olivia Columbus, design editor 
While most people associate her name with GW’s famed freshman residence hall, Mabel Thurston was the first woman admitted to GW as an undergraduate student in 1888. One year later, the University opened admission to 11 women, paving the way for the admission of women throughout the years. GW was by no means a pioneer in admitting women to the University, and not all women were given equal opportunity for admission. Nevertheless, the admission of women was an important and significant step for the University to become more equitable.
While the University began regularly admitting White women for undergraduate programs in 1891, not all women were afforded the chance to be admitted to their preferred academic program. Any woman seeking a higher degree in the legal or medical fields were not admitted until 1913 and 1911, respectively, and women of color were not admitted at all until the school desegregated in 1954. We can learn from our unequal history that these events were not so long ago and are still impacting women around the world today.
Emily Maise, sports editor:
GW broke its athletic color barrier in 1963, seeing the first Black athlete compete in the buff and blue and granting its first scholarship to a Black athlete. Rocky Wright became the first Black student-athlete to play for GW, joining the freshman men’s basketball team. Norman Neverson became the first Black scholarship athlete in March of the same year, competing with the football team as a linesman. Wright and Neverson opened the door for Black athletes at GW. Their integration of the athletic department created a pathway for other Black student-athletes to hone their craft and become trailblazers in their sports.
The Colonials reduced the size of the athletic department three times in the University’s history, displacing more than 150 student-athletes and coaches due to program cuts. Football was the first program slashed in 1966, followed by wrestling and badminton in 1989. The most recent cuts came just a few months ago in July when the athletic department axed seven sports. The final wave of cuts were sped up by the COVID-19 pandemic as the athletic department sought to reduce its size to match other schools who were winning championships at a more frequent pace. Despite our many winning teams, GW has been consistently slimming down on the sports offerings throughout the years. GW should take a step back, learn from our history and start to reimplement some of the sports that have been cut throughout the years.
The editorial board is composed of Hatchet staff members and operates separately from the newsroom. This week’s piece was written by opinions editor Hannah Thacker, contributing opinions editor Andrew Sugrue, managing director Kiran Hoeffner-Shah, managing editor Parth Kotak, sports editor Emily Maise, culture editor Anna Boone and design editor Olivia Columbus, based on discussions of the whole board.

Monica Ruiz, an associate professor of prevention and community health, said the project will rely on "citizen scientists" observing and collecting data on mask usage in their communities.
Milken Institute School of Public Health students are tracking mask-wearing and social distancing adherence in communities throughout the East Coast to determine COVID-19 prevention strategies.
The research is part of a nationwide study, led by health care organizations Kaiser Permanente and the RAND Corporation, to follow compliance with COVID-19 prevention protocols in communities nationwide. Deborah Cohen, a science research assistant at Kaiser Permanente’s Department of Research & Evaluation, said the project seeks to determine how communities differ in abiding by COVID-19 recommendations, like wearing a mask and avoiding crowds.
Cohen said the research is being conducted at nine universities, and more than 100 students are partaking in the data collection. She said she hopes the data will be used to inform local authorities on intervention strategies with low-adherence communities.
“The goal is to conduct them not just at universities but also in diverse local communities,” Cohen said. “We are asking all sites that are collecting the data to share their findings as widely as possible and to work with local health departments to make best use of the data. Knowing where there may be gaps in adherence can inform interventions.”
Monica Ruiz, an associate professor of prevention and community health, said the project relies on observational data collection from “citizen scientists,” who take notes on mask-wearing and social distancing twice a week from their respective communities or wherever they take remote classes.
“We have folks who will hopefully be on the GW campus, we have folks who are in Northern Virginia, in D.C., Bethesda, in Georgia, in Illinois,” Ruiz said. “They can be anywhere and they are able to access places just because it’s part of their neighborhood and their community, so we are getting little snapshots of communities by the people who live there.”
Ruiz said local leaders can use the data to adjust messaging on COVID-19 protocols for communities that are less compliant with mask-wearing or social distancing measures.
Amita Vyas, the director of the GW Center of Excellence in Maternal and Child Health in the public health school, said students have sat in public places in their cars or in indoor spaces during the winter to observe COVID-19 adherence measures.
“It really can help us design and develop more targeted messaging to certain groups of people in hopes that that would resonate more clearly with them, but before we can do that, we need to understand, ‘Who are the folks who are more adherent to mask wearing versus others?’” she said.
Vyas said health officials can target low-adherence community groups through pinpointed messaging, guided by the data the citizen scientists collect.
“If there’s one thing that we’ve learned is that generic messaging isn’t always the most effective,” she said. “The hope of this research is that it’s going to guide more targeted and specific messaging to people in hopes that they will adopt more mask adherence in terms of the behavior.”
The next steps for the research team is to analyze trends in the data that they have observed over several months and produce data-driven reports throughout the spring and summer, Vyas said.
“We’ll start that analysis of data and all of the students are going to be involved,” she said. “We’ll be training them on that analysis. All of the students are going to look at different aspects of the data. Some people are looking more focused on a specific region or population.”
She said even as vaccines continue to roll out, this data collection and analysis will remain relevant because the virus will still be prevalent the rest of the year and into 2022.
“Even though we have a vaccine and we started vaccinating people, I do think that we will still be addressing issues related to COVID-19 through the rest of this year, given where we are with the vaccinations, given possible new variants,” she said.
Jaqueline Carlton, a first-year graduate student in the physician assistant and public health programs in the School of Medicine and Health Sciences and the public health school, said she wanted to get involved with the project after becoming infected with the virus while working at the D.C. Veterans Affairs Medical Center in the hospice unit.
“I firsthand saw how it affected families and affected the community in a broader sense,” Carlton said. “It just became something I was really passionate about, especially when you see peers and colleagues not taking it quite as seriously as others.”
She said a personal benefit of working as a citizen scientist is developing her observational research skills through data collection and collaboration with others during weekly meetings. She said she hopes the data can inform health officials on the number of people that aren’t adhering to COVID-19 prevention protocols.
“If someone on the team is looking at a specific variable, whether that’s physical activity or have an interest in children, you may take note of specific observations on one of your data collection times for them,” she said.
She said citizen scientists have more influence with their respective communities than government researchers because they are active members of their own communities.
“When you have community stakeholders who are getting involved, citizen scientists who look like you and me, who look like normal people, it’s a little bit easier to take the advice that they’re giving you and recognize, ‘OK, this isn’t just coming from some faceless society,’” Carlton said. “It doesn’t feel quite as government-controlled and threatening, perhaps, to some people.”

GW's endowment growth remained positive this year, avoiding the drop in value experienced by some of the University's peers' endowments. 
The University’s endowment growth for fiscal year 2020 is consistent with its peer institutions but falls slightly below the national average.
GW’s endowment increased in value by 1.35 percent in FY 2020, which ran from July 1, 2019, through June 30, 2020, ticking up from $1.779 billion to $1.803 billion. In an analysis of 705 institutions that included GW’s peers, the National Association of College and University Business Officers found that the University’s endowment return was slightly lower than the national average of 1.8 percent.
The report also states that most schools have targeted an annual increase of 7.5 percent on their endowments, and next year’s data will shed light on how universities performed during most of the pandemic. During FY 2019, the national average increase was 5.3 percent, but GW’s endowment value decreased by 1.13 percent that year.
“With data through mid-year 2020, the study captures the first several months of the higher education community’s experiences with the global COVID-19 pandemic,” Susan Whealler Johnston, the president and CEO of the NACUBO, said in a press release. “In next year’s report, the fiscal year 2021 findings will help complete the picture of how institutions and their endowments coped.”
Officials vowed to not tap into GW’s endowment to weather a $180 million annual budget gap this year, instead making cuts in areas like employee travel and hirings.
Of GW’s 12 peer schools, the University saw more significant growth than New York, Northeastern, Syracuse, Tufts, Tulane and Wake Forest universities and the universities of Pittsburgh and Rochester.
The University of Miami and Boston University had the best performance with increases of 5.3 percent. Other peer institutions like Pitt and Wake Forest saw their endowments decrease by 3.2 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively.
John Longo, a professor of finance at Rutgers University and the chief investment officer at the wealth management firm Beacon Trust, said universities’ endowment growth may be explained by factors like a strong governmental fiscal and monetary response to the pandemic as well as speedy vaccine development that happened toward the end of the fiscal year.
“If you told me that we would have the worst pandemic since the early 1900s and the world economy would have a deep recession, I would have been very surprised that most endowments wound up in positive territory,” Longo said.
Robert Kelchen, an associate professor of higher education at Seton Hall University, said he was not surprised that most universities saw their endowments grow given recent market trends. He said the stock market’s strong performance last year helped many universities see an increase in their endowments.
“If a college mostly invested in the stock market, they did better than if they were invested in hedge funds that were in areas that went down,” Kelchen said.
Universities paid out about 4.5 percent of their endowment value in FY 2020 on average, a slight increase from 4.4 percent in FY 2019. Officials took a payout from the endowment of $90.2 million – or 5 percent – during the past fiscal year.
“Right now is a good reason to spend more than normally,” Kelchen said. “Because the pandemic has a fairly clear end date at this point. It was different than last year when we didn’t know how long this would last and colleges had to save their resources. Now spending a little bit more is OK because you have a sense of when things will get back to normal.”
Ken Redd, the director of research and policy analysis at the National Association of College and University Business Officers, said most universities seeing an increase in their endowments shows their true purpose of providing long-term financial stability and support.
“Endowments are long-term assets that are designed to protect universities and to provide support for students in good times and bad times,” Redd said.
Redd said endowments are just one part of university finances, but universities’ other funding sources can change their financial picture.
“Their ranking on a list doesn’t necessarily equate to quality or value of service,” Redd said. “It’s just a ranking. University finances are much more complex than what one would see in any of our tables.”

Administrators will break down the campaign against single-use plastics into four phases aimed at University operations, vendors and students. 
Officials said GW is the only university in the District to commit to eliminating single-use plastics on its campus.
University President Thomas LeBlanc said he hopes GW will send a positive message to other D.C.-area schools about the possibilities for environmental change on campus. He said plastics contribute to a large amount of trash on campus streets, and he hopes to provide students with accessible, reusable alternatives to single-use plastics over the next couple of years.
“If you walk around campus, and I do because I live here, regularly I’ve seen an increase of trash in the streets, and it’s remarkable to me how much of it is single-use plastics,” LeBlanc said in an interview last month. “It’s not just the impact on the oceans and the impact on the landfills and all these other things. We can actually see it on our streets, so I think this is a wonderful initiative.”
LeBlanc said he hopes to collaborate with GW’s vendors and encourage them to eliminate disposable plastics. He said while GW will cooperate with its partners, the University will be unwilling to purchase products from vendors that aren’t made from the appropriate materials.
He said he hopes to provide students with reusable dining ware to divert them from using single-use plastic packaging from GWorld vendors.
“If all of our students are given, very early on, reusable dining ware, then they don’t need to take plastics at any of those locations and over time, the demand for those plastic utensils will dissipate as well,” LeBlanc said.
LeBlanc said Take Back the Tap, a student organization that works to educate the GW community on the dangers of plastic pollution, played a role in “sensitizing our whole community” to the issue of single-use plastics and introduced the idea of encouraging students to use reusable water bottles.
The United States produced 292 million tons of plastic waste in 2018, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
The Class of 2023 received reusable water bottles and a barcode tag tracking the number of plastic water bottles that students were saving at the start of their New Student Orientation in 2019.
“I want to distinguish between the reusable water bottle and then the water that comes in plastic bottles,” LeBlanc said. “We’re not going to buy plastic bottled water for University events. We’re going to have refill stations and make sure the students all have access to a multi-use water bottle.”
Meghan Chapple, the director of the Office of Sustainability, said administrators are planning to implement the University’s plan in four scopes. She said the first scope involves reducing disposable plastics on campus, which the University has direct control over, and the second scope will address single-use plastic use at the University’s vendors.
She said the third scope includes adapting GW community member lifestyles to exclude plastics, and the fourth includes dialogue and engagement in the community about the ban. She added that the scopes will occur simultaneously.
Junior Jennifer Cuyuch, the co-president of Take Back the Tap, said the organization has been pushing officials to implement refill stations on campus and take plastic water bottles out of vending machines since 2018. She said students can take steps, like using a water filter and reusable water bottle, to reduce their plastic waste, but administrators should aid students in accessing the necessary reusable materials.
“It is a bit privileged to just be like, ‘Oh, you know, just get a hydro flask,’ for example,” she said. “A big part of this should come from the administration.”
Cuyuch added that the group is pushing for administrators to commit to a date by which GW will have phased out these plastics and said their plan for eliminating them was “very ambiguous.”
“It was like, ‘We’re going to do this,’ but they don’t necessarily say how they’re going to do it,” she said. “In the event they do actually have very specific actions that they want to take, we want to make sure that’s released to the public because people need to know so that they’re held accountable.”
Experts in sustainability on university campuses said eliminating disposable plastics on campus helps create a more sustainable world and the move should be paired with a committee to hold the University accountable to its goal.
Joseph Gardella, a professor of chemistry at the University of Buffalo, said these plastics are leading to “extraordinary impacts” on the environment and, eliminating them is just one step in the right direction.
“Getting rid of single-use plastics is just a part of the problem of reducing plastic waste, and while that will make people feel good, it’s not enough to really deal with the plastic waste that we have in the environment that is just having extraordinary impacts on freshwater systems, on the marine environment, on animals and even all the way down to single-celled organisms,” he said.
Officials formed the Single-Use Plastics Task Force at the start of the academic year, with Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Mark Diaz as its organizer. The task force convened in September to develop a plan for the implementation of the ban, before submitting recommendations to officials in October.
Ryan Bell, the associate director of sustainability at the University of California Office of the President, said the UC system committed to eliminating disposable plastics in all 10 of its campuses. He said it’s easy to “pass a broad general sweeping policy that is aspirational” but the key to the policy’s success is in its implementation.
“The devil is really in the details,” Bell said. “You need to think through what plastics are being used, what alternatives are available and especially who should be brought into the conversation.”

Administrators will retain an updated version of Banweb for student services, breaking from a prior decision to retire the system. 
Officials are no longer considering phasing out the Banweb administrative system, instead making gradual updates to improve the existing sites.
Officials announced in January 2018 that GW would move away from Banweb after its vendor, Ellucian Banner, retired the version, but that summer, GW Information Technology adopted the Banner 9 Administrative Pages, an updated version of the system. Jared Johnson, the interim chief technology officer, said officials’ focus is now on modernizing Banweb’s functions.
“Since 2019, GW IT’s focus has been on updating the functionality in the GWeb self-service product through an iterative release cycle,” Johnson said in an email.
Administrators previously said last January they were reviewing the Banner roadmap with “campus partners” to consider future functionality for implementation.
Johnson said the first most visible improvements came last summer when the IT department released “a completely new course registration experience for students.” Later that year, the division revealed a new employee dashboard, he said.
He said technology officials announced an updated version of DegreeMAP last fall that included “enhanced planning tools” for students and academic advisers.
DegreeMAP launched at GW in 2011 in a deal with the software developer DegreeWorks, operated by the California-based Sungard Bi-Tech Inc.
Officials rolled out a chain of updates to the system in December, including a mobile-friendly “look and feel” and improved planning to assist advisers in mapping out degree completion requirements. The updates also featured new functionalities to support concentrations and view the status of students’ graduation applications.
IT department officials also announced a new “report format” that added the ability to conduct a “historic audit” and a “what-if” report and other tools geared toward helping students and advisers in the registration process, according to the Office of the Registrar.
The “historic audit” shows students a “snapshot” of how close they are to graduating from a particular program. The “what-if report” feature allows for students to visualize the path to complete different degrees and concentrations and the course loads involved in them.
Students said they have had mixed experiences with the changes to Banweb and DegreeMAP. While some said the website works faster and is easier to navigate, others found that some functionalities have been replaced with tools that are difficult to use.
Sophomore Ananya Sampath, an international affairs student, said the performance of Banweb and the registration systems have been “subpar.”
“The site would always crash during class registration, and I found that I would often have to wait in long lines to get support from GWIT,” she said. “Overall, I honestly felt like there could have been more of an effort to make the registration technology have the capacity to support all the students while registering with less barriers.”
Sampath said she had not noticed many updates, and information like academic transcripts and earned credits remain difficult to find, as students have to go through a few different web pages within Banweb to view them. But she said registration has become “smoother” and the general system seems to work faster.
Sophomore Christian Williams, a psychology and political science major, said the upgraded version of Banweb is somewhat easier to maneuver, as some pages and tools can be located more intuitively. But he said the system instructs him to exit his internet browser if he is signed on for too long – which he said did not happen with the older version.
“Since going virtual, I feel like I’ve adjusted pretty well to it all, whether it be Banweb or DegreeMAP, old or new,” Williams said. “I thought the old systems worked well, but I understand why they upgraded it, especially since the older version Banweb was sort of already unpopular, at least from what I heard.”
Vishva Bhatt, a junior majoring in international affairs, said Banweb and the registration process have become easier to navigate over time. She said she found some parts of the site’s reorganization, like the upgrades to the academic auditing services and website design released in December, made Banweb more “user-friendly” to navigate.
“It took some adjustment because it was new, but it’s way more organized now, and it makes more sense intuitively,” Bhatt said.
She said the newly updated DegreeMAP, with its “new mobile-friendly look and feel,” is much easier to use. But she added that the new academic planning tools can be confusing to use, and it is often simpler to plan out what future classes and credits she will need independently or with an academic adviser.
As the COVID-19 pandemic has forced GW into a virtual setting, students have had to register for classes from home, with most support from the IT department taking place via video calls.
Sophomore Thomas Litchfield, an international affairs major, said IT department officials replaced the registration site’s schedule viewer with a “less-helpful” version.
Litchfield said the schedule viewer that was removed was more compact and easy to view for later use. He said the version now available on the registration site does not fully capture a weekly schedule on the screen and is difficult to copy or screenshot.
“I think it’s OK, but it can be a bit annoying to use sometimes,” Litchfield said.

Snow blanketed areas across Texas following two weeks of a winter storm, leaving students without power and mentally and physically drained. 
For a few days two weeks ago, senior Denice Rios could only hope her home in Texas would receive internet power to charge her laptop and complete assignments.
Below-freezing temperatures reached her hometown near Houston, causing power outages and a lack of clean water for four days while the state initiated rolling blackouts to conserve energy and prevent Texas’ power grid from failing. Rios said she fell behind in classes during that time because she couldn’t always charge her technology or connect to the internet for class.
“I felt really helpless because there’s really nothing we can do without internet power,” Rios said. “And then the day is getting darker, faster because it’s really cold. So there were very limited things that we could do.”
Rios is one of five students currently taking classes remotely in Texas who said they went without heat, power and water for multiple days as the state experienced unusually strong winter storms and widespread power outages. Students said their professors accommodated their situations by offering extensions and emotional support as students focused on staying safe and warm throughout the week.
Sophomore Anushka Hassan, an international affairs major taking classes in Houston, said the power in her house turned off and on for three days after Feb. 14. On the first day, she got power back within two hours, but it shut off soon after and did not turn back on for three days, she said. 
She said her family went without heat, power and water, which left her drained and unable to stay on top of her work as her focus turned to staying warm.
Hassan said she had to keep her windows shut and huddle close to her gas fireplace after her house dropped to 40 degrees. She said she emailed her professors to alert them she would be absent from class because of the power outages, but some asked if she could use her phone as a hotspot to log in.
She said she felt like her professors were understanding overall, but she would not have had the energy to attend class during the storm had she had power.
“It was really hard to stay warm because the fireplace is only so big and it’s in the middle of our living room, so we just did our best shutting the windows,” Hassan said. “My room was intolerable because it has a really big window and it’s at the front of the house, so I just really didn’t spend any time in my room.”
Junior Lucas Miller, a Middle East studies major and Hatchet photographer taking classes from home near Austin, Texas, said he was about to log into one of his classes on Feb. 11 when the power cut off. He said he was still able to attend that class through his phone but had to keep it plugged into a portable charger because he could not charge it through any outlet.
Miller said the next few days were “stressful” between communicating his absences to professors during the “infrequent” periods he could get service.
“It was pretty difficult just trying to make sure that the email actually went through,” Miller said. “I couldn’t access Blackboard or do any coursework really that needed internet access.”
Miller said before the snowstorm, his family had never turned on their fireplace, but his entire family huddled around it for three days and “rarely” left the living room.
“I was nervous, just because we’re not used to having freezes that last more than a day or so,” Miller said. “So I was just completely unaccustomed to anything like that. And I was also just thinking about people who don’t have homes, and things like that, that live around here.”
Sophomore Sofia Packer, who takes classes in Woodland, Texas, said she had been in the middle of a Student Association diversity and inclusion committee meeting when her power suddenly shut off. All power lines were shut off in her neighborhood, leaving her disconnected from her peers and the rest of Texas for 14 hours, she said.
She said Woodland is separate from the Texas power grid, located on the eastern power grid, meaning her family did not experience the same rolling outages as other cities. She said she spent the rest of the week concerned that another power outage would happen at any time.
Packer said by last Sunday, Woodland was returning to its normal warm temperatures.
“The timeline was the snow really started hitting Monday – it stuck through Tuesday,” Packer said. “And then it started going away on Wednesday because we had a rain that was just above freezing. And then by Friday, it was completely gone.”
She said all of her professors were “fully understanding” of her situation and offered to waive any potential absences after she warned them of the power outage. She said she did not have to miss any classes but had “nothing but praise” for how her professors handled the situation.
“The temperature drop was rather dramatic,” Packer said. “It first started getting cold over the weekend, before all of the power outages and all that. And then it really plummeted down to some of the coldest temperatures I think we’ve ever had.”
