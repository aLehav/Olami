When Student Association President Ashwin Narla spoke with The Hatchet’s editorial board at his endorsement hearing last spring, he said he would not only represent students if elected, but also give them an integral role in the advocacy process.
He pledged to be the voice of the student body – not an arm of the administration.
Narla is fulfilling that promise. The SA will hold a rally in Kogan Plaza Thursday, through which the group hopes to marshal student support for construction on the third-floor terrace in the Marvin Center – the next phase of the ongoing student space initiative. They plan to collect student signatures for a petition that they can then present to the Board of Trustees.
Bringing more students into the fold just might be the key to success on this issue. And it is a stark contrast from past SA administrations, which did not seek student support with a rally.
But admittedly, getting students to participate in the rally will be a challenge. And it is unknown whether it will have any meaningful impact. There is a perennial problem of student engagement with campus issues, and the SA has its work cut out for itself.
What we do know is that when student-related initiatives have been put up for a vote in the past, apathy was high and voter turnout was low.
During the smoking ban referendum last spring, less than 20 percent of students cast a ballot. And when the SA proposed another referendum on the student fee increase in November, only 16 percent of the student body took the time to express their opinion. Both referenda passed, but the majority of students simply weren’t involved.
This rally is an admirable attempt to encourage student engagement on campus, but it can’t be the only effort. Students must recognize that a long-term battle is necessary if any real progress is to be made.
And while focusing on long-term objectives, Narla’s administration has also successfully tackled quality-of-life issues this year.
So far, he has delivered free HIV/AIDS testing clinics at the Student Health Service, convinced the administration to open Duques and Funger halls later for students to study and passed a student fee increase to enable the SA to offer more funding to smaller student organizations.
It’s unlikely that any building projects for the third floor terrace will take off this semester. But it is possible to build real momentum.

Most finance majors share the same goal: a lucrative internship or job offer at a large financial institution. But at a non-target school for big banks, GW finance students are sometimes overlooked for summer internships.
This has changed to some extent over the past two years due to the work of the F. David Fowler Career Center and the launch of the real estate and finance mentorship program in 2010. Nevertheless, administrators and finance students are struggling to figure out how to make our students more attractive to high-profile banks.
The ongoing discussion in the business school is whether or not incorporating more liberal arts classes in the curriculum will make GW business students more appealing to future employers.
Clearly, both liberal arts and finance classes provide a unique educational experience. The former stretches the mind and teaches students critical thinking. And the latter provides students with practical skills used to create value for the firm.
For some students, college is about taking a variety of courses and exploring interests. Others believe college is about specializing in a field that will provide tangible skills which will in turn help them find jobs. I fall in the latter category, but it has become increasingly apparent to me that finance students need a background in both areas to be successful in today’s global work environment.
The idea to create a Bachelor of Science degree in finance is a step in the right direction. Finance students should be encouraged to take a variety of courses, such as psychology or African politics, as they have major implications for understanding financial markets. Additionally, these courses will encourage students to develop writing skills more than traditional business administration courses do.  This knowledge will serve students well in the future when conducting equity research, organizing information for pitch books or summarizing Financial Times articles for superiors. I am confident that this new degree will be well received by the students who pilot the program.
However, the school must address the problems with the bachelor of business administration degree.
For example, there are too many core requirements that should either be consolidated or eliminated completely. Students are required to take 13 business administration classes that are incredibly repetitive. This is apparent in courses like Organizational Behavior and Management, Organizations and Society.
Business students also do not write enough. A simple solution is to increase the required number of WID courses for these students. By consolidating the number of required business administration classes, students would have the opportunity to take more courses in which writing is an integral part of the curriculum.
At the end of the day, it is unclear whether or not a specialized degree would improve one’s chances of securing the ideal summer internship. But what is clear is that a well-rounded educational background will provide students with the tools they need to make a lasting impression while on the job. And for that reason, I support the specialized finance degree.

If you picked up a print copy of The Hatchet in the past few days, you might have noticed a change to the top of the opinions page. For years, the upper right-hand corner was home to a “quotable” comment from that day’s issue.
But from now on, in its place there will be a box titled “What the University Won’t Talk About This Week.”
This University has perpetuated a culture of declining to comment on a range of issues, from sales at J Street to the cost of an unpopular rebranding campaign by top-tier firms. As stakeholders in this community, students have the right to information.
Yes, when officials decline to comment, it hinders reporting. But more importantly, it leaves the public less informed.
After the University disclosed in November that it had inflated admissions data for a decade, administrators left students with many unanswered questions. GW tasked an external firm to audit its admissions data, but only received an oral report of that investigation. University leaders declined to comment when asked critical questions – like why they did not task the firm with producing a report, or how they determined that the flawed formula which skewed admissions data was inadvertent. And they refused to make the former dean of admissions, Kathryn Napper, available for comment, and then announced her retirement a month later.
These are not isolated incidents.
The inaugural post on “What the University Won’t Talk About This Week” featured a spokeswoman’s decline to comment on the number of FIXit requests submitted last semester. And in the fall, the University Police Department declined to say how many elevators broke down that year.
We have a duty to our readers to diligently report fair, unbiased and accurate news. To honor that relationship of trust, our readers deserve to know what information is being withheld from the community, and we will continue to post the declines to comment in hopes of encouaging a shift away from secrecy and toward transparency and clearer communication.

To the GW community:
Student space means additional study rooms on campus, more places to hang out and more opportunities for student organizations to assemble, hold events and make an impact.
It’s about more than just the physical area — it is the idea that the community has its own place to pursue its goals, fulfill the tasks that fill to-do lists and spark a sense of identity on campus.
GW provides us with endless opportunities. But when things like an over-crowded Gelman Starbucks or a booked Marvin Center impede students’ ability to collaborate with peers, we find ourselves disappointed.
If we push for more student space together with one united voice, the administration will listen. The Student Association cannot tackle this initiative alone. The need for more student space is a campus-wide problem that all students at GW face. The more space we have, the more room we have to grow as a community and as an institution.
In the past few years, we have witnessed the loss of WOW Café and Wingery, the Hippodrome and the Fishbowl. The upcoming departures of Froggy Bottom Pub, Mehran, Thai Place and Panda Café from their homes on Pennsylvania Avenue will add to the list of venues that are in alumni’s memories but will soon vanish.
Students at GW are unique. Some are here to study hard and get their degrees. Some are here to become actively involved in the community.  Students’ ambitions take them outside the classroom to work, collaborate and do good.
That’s why investing in student life and student space is the best thing we can do for GW.
Friends tell us that they lack the space to practice for performances, to meet in groups to collaborate on upcoming projects or to simply have a place to call their own in between commutes, which is especially important for graduate students who live off campus.
If we are expected to turn knowledge into action and become the next generation of doctors, lawyers, engineers, diplomats, teachers, politicians, community organizers and entrepreneurs, we need the space to come together.
We hope you will join the student space rally in Kogan Plaza Thursday from noon to 2 p.m. and sign the petition that will be presented to the Board of Trustees in February. This is our university, and our tuition – let’s make it our space, too.
Sincerely,
Patrick Kennedy, Avra Bossov, Julia Susuni, Daniel Egel-Weiss, Tyler Calder and Ari Massefski

The Student Association will look to stir up a campus-wide push for more student space on campus this week, continuing a year-and-a-half battle.
Before the Board of Trustees meeting next month, the SA will “dorm storm” every building on campus and hold a student space rally Thursday with enough free food for 1,500 students. The group hopes to get more than 5,000 signatures on a petition asking the Board of Trustees and University President Steven Knapp to build up the Marvin Center third-floor terrace and reserve the future basement of the superdorm for study and lounge areas.
SA leaders have blasted the more than $300 million allocated toward academic buildings recently, compared to $17 million spent on GW’s library and Marvin Center student offices.
September 2011
The Fishbowl, a hang-out hub on the corner of 22nd and G streets, is replaced with administrative offices.
February 2012
Then-Student Association President John Richardson lobbies for fourth floor Marvin Center construction at the Board of Trustees meeting.
May 2012
The Board of Trustees sets aside $225,000 to renovate the fourth floor of the Marvin Center and expand student organizations’ offices.
September 2012
SA President Ashwin Narla and Executive Vice President Abby Bergren submit a 22-page proposal outlining 10 ways to allow greater use of campus space, including turning academic halls into study rooms at night. Administrators agreed to few demands in full.
January 2013
Narla and Bergren amp up lobbying with a second proposal, a student rally and a petition they hope will get more than 5,000 signatures.
Sen. Ryan Counihan, SoB-U, who drafted a resolution this week condemning the University’s lackluster approach to increasing student space, called it an “ultimatum” for administrators to take their voices seriously. The senate passed the bill unanimously.
“It’s been a perpetual issue. The fact that it’s perpetual shows that it wasn’t dealt with before,” Counihan said. “The Student Association is definitely taking a more aggressive approach, because we’ve gotten nowhere over the past year and a half. Space makes students happy and makes them more likely to give back to the University.”
Last semester, the SA sent a space proposal to administrators’ desks, pitching 10 ideas, including 24-hour access to academic buildings and the elimination of fees for student organization events. The University only partially agreed to the plan, giving students access to seven conference rooms in the Marvin Center after business hours and allowing students into Duques and Funger halls until 2 a.m.
SA President Ashwin Narla said those were positive gains, but students need to see a more serious commitment to space.
Narla said the lack of space hampers students’ experience at GW. Narla said if GW pledged to carve out more space for students, more students would “love GW and not love being at GW because it’s in D.C.”
The executive duo sent a second proposal this month. Narla said he and Bergren met with Executive Vice President and Treasurer Lou Katz last week and will meet with other administrators over the next two weeks to discuss this plan.
This is the second year the SA president has campaigned for student space at a Board of Trustees meeting.
To draw in student support at the rally, sandwich shop Jetties will provide free sandwiches, and the SA will spend about $500 for pizza, Narla said.

 (out of five stars):


It’s been about a year since I left GW to study abroad in Spain, and I’m beginning to feel a little nostalgic – especially for the food.
Luckily, Boqueria Tapas Bar and Restaurant, located just a short walk from campus on the corner of 19th and M streets promised to cure my cravings. The restaurant was packed when I went on a Thursday evening with some friends, but we still managed to grab a high-top table at the bar within 15 minutes.

Don’t miss these: 
Albóndigas ($14)
Rosemary Manchego ($5)
Jamon Serrano ($9)
Churros con Chocolate ($7)
Signature Red Sangria ($34)

The bar, which takes up almost half of the restaurant, is framed by chalkboards listing daily specials in funky handwriting. Dim lighting, a room full of chatter and Spanish music made me feel like I was truly back in Europe.
After reading over the menu, my friends and I placed a hefty order of assorted tapas. Our waitress advised us to order two to three plates per person – the portions are on the smaller side – so we could try different vegetable, potato and meat dishes.
The first dish to arrive at our table was Coca de Setas ($14), a homemade flatbread with tender, roasted wild mushrooms, mixed Spanish cheeses, sweet caramelized onions and crisp frisée lettuce. Each element of the dish was unique in texture and flavor, but together they melded perfectly.
Next we received Gambas al Ajillo ($13): juicy shrimp in a spicy garlic pepper oil. The shrimp were sweet and tender, and there were more than enough for all of us. The next three dishes to arrive at our table were three of my favorites from Spain: Patatas Bravas ($9), Espinacas a la Catalana ($8) and Croquetas Cremosas ($11). The Patatas Bravas rivaled those that I ate in Spain. The crispy potato wedges were generously doused in spicy fire-roasted tomato “salsa brava” and creamy garlic aioli. The potatoes, though covered in sauce, maintained their crunch and temperature, and the two sauces balanced each other very well.

The potatoes, though covered in sauce, maintained their crunch and temperature, and the two sauces balanced each other very well.
The spinach in the Espinacas a la Catalana was briefly cooked so that it was hot without losing its crunch. The addition of pine nuts, garbanzo beans and golden raisins paired well with the greens.
Finally, the croquetas were filled with sautéed mushrooms and salty serrano ham – a traditional Spanish meat, similar to prosciutto. I could tell they were freshly fried from their crisp, golden exterior and creamy inside. We washed our meal down with a pitcher of seasonal sangria ($34) made with sparkling rosé wine and cranberries.
The quality of food was worth the wait, and although it may not be suitable for an intimate meal, the atmosphere was conducive to catching up with friends and winding down over tapas and sangria. I would highly recommend making a reservation, though, as you are bound to wait on any weekend night, and the aroma of fried potatoes, garlic and ham might drive you crazy if you’re starving.
As they say in Spain, ¡Buen Provecho!

While millions will gather around their televisions Sunday for the biggest football game of the year, one junior will stand on the sidelines.
Casey Wood, a junior correspondent for CBS, travelled to New Orleans Saturday to prepare for Super Bowl coverage alongside his idols: Bob Costas, Jim Rome and Kevin Frazier. On game day, he will be on the sidelines, covering everything from the pre-game action to the game itself and the post-show.
The journalism and mass communications major and station manager for GWTV said he always knew he wanted to go into broadcast journalism and describes his experience on- and off-air at CBS as a dream.
Wood, 21, began working for CBS last year. He has since covered major events like Superstorm Sandy and Inauguration Day, doing everything from prep work to interviewing celebrities. His list of past interviewees already covers actors, TV personalities, high-profile athletes and business moguls, including Piers Morgan and brothers Peyton and Eli Manning.
“It’s been surreal,” Wood said. “It’s every young avid sports fan’s dream.”
Growing up in a suburb north of Chicago, Wood started working when he was 15 to help support his family. Both Wood and his identical twin brother Tobey received soccer scholarships to GW and enrolled in 2010.
“We were brought up under, ‘Hard work will always beat talent, because talent stops working hard,’ and, ‘When you’re tired, work harder,’ ” his brother said, adding that he considers his brother very ambitious.
Since arriving in New Orleans Saturday, Wood has interviewed Dan Marino, a former quarterback for the Miami Dolphins and a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The interview took place as they played a game of catch.
Wood’s work days at CBS begin at 5 a.m. and end at 11 p.m. He first adjusted to the schedule when he arrived at the studio before sunrise for Hurricane Sandy coverage.
“Every day, I wake up with a smile on my face like a kindergartner on the first day of school,” Wood said, adding that his optimistic attitude has earned him the nickname “puppy” at work.
He will graduate in December and hopes to continue working for CBS. His goal is to be a reporter or associate producer after college and eventually advance to reporting network news like his idol Brian Williams.
“Being side-by-side by every major reporter in the sports world – it’s totally a dream come true,” Wood said.

What does double overtime against a team tied for first place for the conference, undefeated in league play, say?
It spells tenacity. And fight. And heart – three qualities head coach Jonathan Tsipis thinks his team has.
That’s why, even though the Colonials ultimately fell 63-59 in double overtime to Duquesne, Tsipis immediately emphasized the pride he has in his team during his postgame press conference.
“I thought our kids had an unbelievable will to fight, and did a great job getting the lead in the second half,” Tsipis said. “We fought. And that’s what I’m most proud of in our team. We challenged them at halftime to come out and throw that first punch, and I think we threw some good combinations and got out, and got in our transition game.”
Still, dropping a double overtime contest was a heartbreaking turn of events for the Colonials (8-12, 2-4 A-10). It was a loss born of  equal parts fatigue, and Duquesne doing more to close the game out, Tsipis said.
“We were struggling to score, and we felt like we couldn’t rely on jumpers,” Tsipis said. “I think the difference, from that point, was their activity level was better, and when they broke us down defensively, somebody had a wide open shot.”
After a slow start early in the game, the Colonials revamped their approach, boxing out with greater energy and fighting harder to hold their ground against the Dukes.
The team went on an 8-0 run to halt Duquesne’s dominance, exiting the half with an advantage on the boards and the game tied at 24.
In the second, the Colonials opened with a quick run that gave them the lead, continuing to crack down on the Dukes’ chances. The team shot 33 percent overall on the game, and its true offensive success came when it cracked down on the glass and got out in transition, its head coach said.
“Then, I think , it makes the basket bigger, and you start running your half court sets, and everything like that,” Tsipis said.
The team’s attack was led by graduate student forward Sara Mostafa and senior guard Danni Jackson, who each tallied 17 points. Mostafa added nine rebounds, and Jackson supplemented her points total with three assists. It felt like the offense was clicking best when the whole team pushed its attack together, the two said.
“We were able to run the plays properly, I got open a few times from my teammates setting good screens,” Mostafa said. “That’s just something that we always stress. Setting good screens, hitting someone to get your teammate open, and hitting the boards.”
The team was able to keep within striking distance from the Dukes despite turning the ball over 25 times, tying GW’s second-highest total of the season. Duquesne scored 27 points off of turnovers on the game.
“Besides a number, it’s a matter of a confidence level,” Tsipis said. “I didn’t feel like in either of the overtimes that played a factor, but it definitely did when they made their run. We were forced to have to score just in the half court.”
Despite a GW crackdown on defense, the Dukes weren’t the kind of team to go quietly. Even when faced with GW’s revamped pressure, they continued to battle, going on a 16-2 run to regain the lead with six minutes remaining. Regulation ultimately ended in a tie at 48, the game heading into two overtime periods before Duquense walked away with a narrow victory.
Still, it was a performance with many highlights for the Colonials, including their defense. They cracked down on the perimeter, holding the Dukes to 1-17 shooting from beyond the arc.
“I thought today we played really well on defense. I just think that sometimes, we miss some key things and details, what we know we should have done, we just missed them,” Jackson said. “They were just mental lapses.”
But though it was a game with many positives for the Colonials, the loss still stung as GW walked away from the Smith Center Wednesday.
“The thing that gave me confidence was seeing the good things that my teammates and I were doing,” Mostafa said. “I do feel confident moving forward, but this one just hurts really bad. Because it was right there.”
