Friday

Portraits of Resilience
Surround yourself with a stunning show of projected photography and more personal storytelling at the Town Hall Education Arts Recreation Campus. The Portraits of Resilience exhibition highlights the challenges facing immigrants and amplifies immigrant voices from more than 10 countries, projecting their stories and experiences across a darkened room and striking the silhouettes of the museum-goers inside. The photo series tells the stories of dozens of journeys to raise awareness of the ongoing immigration crisis, marked by instances of oppression in the home countries of the photos’ subjects. Jonathan Banks, the artist behind this installation, aims to bring light to the beauty within the complex nature of those he photographs through his use of bright colors and captivating light projection work to complement the series. Friday is the last full day of the exhibition, so take advantage of this extraordinary learning opportunity while you still can.
Phillips at The Town Hall Education Arts Recreation Campus. 1800 Mississippi Ave. SE. Open from 1 to 6 p.m. Thursday and Friday. Free. Find more information here.

The chocolate aroma wafted out of the box holding the berger cookie pie as soon as I popped it open. The soft texture of the custard contrasts the crunchy crumbled pieces of shortbread cookie that lay atop the pie.

Pie Shop isn’t any old hometown bakery.
Though the pastry shop has everything you’d expect of a modest bakery, Pie Shop on the H Street Corridor offers customers an unexpected twist – enjoy a sweet treat of your choice with a side of punk rock. While patrons can choose to indulge in a variety of sweet or savory pies, they can listen to the musical stylings of punk rockers dedicated to playing at this underground venue.
The venue is somewhat of a journey from Foggy Bottom – the Metro ride to Union Station and the subsequent walk through Northeast D.C. totals about 45 minutes. Upon entering the shop, the bakeshop’s affinity for rock music is immediately clear. Photos of rock artists line the walls as punk music plays from a speaker next to the counter. The entry floor of the two-floored shop is primarily devoted to the fresh pie portion of Pie Shop, with a lit-up sign near the speaker that reads “In Pie We Crust.”
After heading downstairs from the entrance, patrons can order pies by the slice ($7-$9) or by the pie ($36-40) at a counter in the back. Pies can be ordered hot or at room temperature, and you can enjoy them under the glow of the restaurant’s ship wheel chandeliers. There is ample seating in the small bakery, with multiple wooden tables and benches. Sounds of guitar riffs and song lyrics from the singer performing on the floor above jolt the shop to life from its otherwise subtle environment.
On my visit to Pie Shop, I ordered a slice of the berger cookie pie and a slice of the roasted apple cinnamon chess pie. Both were about palm-sized, came in metal tins and were placed in paper boxes. You can eat the pie with your hands after the first few bites, but not too soon lest your slice fall apart, soft and fresh out of the oven.
The chocolate aroma wafted out of the box holding the berger cookie pie as soon as I popped it open. A warm buttermilk custard fills the middle of the pie and quickly melts in your mouth. The soft texture of the custard contrasts the crunchy crumbled pieces of shortbread cookie that lay atop the pie.
A dollop of chocolate syrup sits in the middle of the slice, which certainly caught me by surprise but provided an extra burst of sweetness for the pie. My one criticism is that the slice came lukewarm, even though I ordered it hot.
Granny Smith apple slices cover the roasted apple cinnamon chess pie slice, coated in cinnamon and filled with a sugar custard. While the filling is mostly flavorless aside from its extreme sweetness, it provides the necessary contrast to the tarty taste of the apple slices.
The upper floor of Pie Shop turns the rock-loving theme up a notch with live music that can captivate a crowd. To attend a show, one must purchase tickets for concerts ahead of time, with prices typically ranging from $10 to $15.
The music level features a bar and tables on one end and an open area in front of the stage on the other. Across from the bar, signed magazines, posters and photos commemorating the history of punk rock and the 12-year-old Pie Shop line the wall. Patrons can purchase merchandise for each night’s performer, also hanging along the wall.
The show I attended started 50 minutes late, so you shouldn’t stress too much about showing up on time to a show. If you arrive too early, take a breath of fresh air on the terrace, which sits next to a wall of ivy with more seating.
Pilau, a D.C. based band, performed during my visit. The band is a Pie Shop veteran, first holding its debut concert together at the venue. The group is a heavy metal band that has been releasing music since 2020, and its third, most recent album dropped in February.
Grungy guitars, heavy drums and gravelly tunes set the tone as the band opened into a bellowing guitar riff. Jumping around and throwing his head back, the lead singer called out to the crowd to rally the Pie Shop audience, where people nodded their heads to the music and erupted with cheers after each song.
After the set was complete, a bakery employee went up to the band to ensure that they had each gotten some pie to complete the Pie Shop experience. A dining excursion filled with both pastries and head-banging music can only be found at Pie Shop, making it well worth the journey for anyone from pie-eaters to punk-rock lovers.

D.C.’s newest memorial rests along the outskirts of GW’s campus at the corner of I and 21st streets. Adorned with flowers and photos and erected by members of D.C.’s cycling community, a white bicycle stands alone. The memorial, known as a “ghost bike,” honors Shawn O’Donnell – a cyclist who died last week after the driver of a Mack truck fatally struck her at that intersection. She was the third bicyclist to die in a collision this month and one of 21 traffic fatalities in the District so far this year. But O’Donnell’s death was no accident – our streets, even in relatively pedestrian- and bike-friendly Foggy Bottom, are unsafe.
O’Donnell was struck when a truck driver turned right onto I Street as she continued to travel southbound on 21st Street through the intersection, according to a Metropolitan Police Department release last week. Photos and videos posted to Twitter show O’Donnell’s bike caught beneath the truck. But what really happened? Who wasn’t paying attention? Who’s responsible?
I don’t care to answer these questions, not least because we still don’t know the full story. In fact, it’s unclear if the traffic signals at the intersection were operational at the time of the collision. No amount of personal responsibility can make up for the fact that D.C.’s streets and the city itself failed Shawn O’Donnell, just as it has failed cyclists and pedestrians across the District for nearly a decade.
Under Mayor Muriel Bowser’s Vision Zero plan, the District is supposed to entirely eliminate traffic fatalities in D.C. by 2024. Yet traffic fatalities have increased nearly every year since the program launched in 2015, cresting at 40 deaths in 2021 alone. The 2022 total has already passed the halfway mark of last year’s count, currently at 21 traffic fatalities as of Thursday. But both these figures downplay the extent of the issue – hundreds if not thousands of people sustain non-fatal injuries on the city’s streets annually. Instead of safe streets, we have traffic bollards snapped like plastic straws and city-owned vehicles blocking bicycle lanes. It’s true that the city has made some tangible progress here and there, rebuilding intersections and creating new bike lines in places where injuries are likely. But Bowser and the D.C. Council are still blind to the problem before them.
Alongside O’Donnell, cyclists Michael Gordon, Michael Hawkins Randall and pedestrian Charles Jackson also died after being struck by vehicles this month. Vehicular violence is quite literally out of control in D.C. – a driver even crashed their car into the Watergate complex last week – though fortunately, no one died. While traffic injuries and fatalities disproportionately affect minority and lower-income pedestrians and cyclists, recent deaths show how such violence cuts across communities regardless of race, age and ability. If it can happen in Foggy Bottom, it can happen anywhere.
But the goal behind Vision Zero is a noble one, and I still think we ought to eliminate or at least significantly reduce traffic deaths in D.C. So how can we transform D.C.’s streets, especially its intersections, from fatal “failures” to safe “successes”? There’s no shortage of tools to choose from. Raised crosswalks and intersections that lie level with the curb can act as speed bumps that force drivers to slow down as they approach. On wider roads like Pennsylvania and Virginia avenues, pedestrian islands can shorten the distance required to cross the road while prone to oncoming traffic, shielding pedestrians and cyclists from cars. And using a combination of bollards, planters and curbs, we can create protected bike lanes and intersections that keep pedestrians and cyclists away from dangerous vehicle traffic.
But street design alone isn’t enough – we also need to rethink the vehicles that travel on our streets. To its credit, D.C. has required all heavy-duty vehicles registered in the District to have side guards since 2019. Whether individual bars or a continuous barrier, side guards block the empty space between the front and back wheels of large trucks to prevent pedestrians and cyclists from being swept beneath the vehicle in a collision. Yet the truck that killed O’Donnell didn’t have side guards – it belongs to a Maryland construction company, limiting the District’s ability to regulate it. Though it runs into the same jurisdictional issues as mandating side guards, the District could also require private operators to use cab-over-engine trucks. These “high-vision” vehicles have a flat front instead of a larger nose that could block pedestrians and cyclists from the driver’s view. As difficult as it may be to regulate large trucks both within and outside of D.C., our streets are only as safe as the most dangerous vehicles on the road – we have to address the deadly potential of oversized vehicles.
The bottom line is that everyone uses the street, and everyone should feel safe doing so. These proposals can help us move toward a better future, even if they cost time and money and need public support. In Foggy Bottom, it’s time to redouble our efforts to create safe streets. In too many parts of the District, those efforts are just beginning.
We cannot and should not tolerate the alternative – we already know what a world without safe streets looks like. It’s a world in which drivers have hit students again and again and again on H Street. It’s a world of inaccessible sidewalks and unmarked crosswalks for people with disabilities. It’s a world in which Shawn O’Donnell, Michael Gordon, Michael Hawkins Randall, Charles Jackson and countless others died needlessly. It’s the world we live in now. But it’s a world we can change.
Better, safer streets are possible. We only have to build them.

Hard fought-activism wins – Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas is no longer teaching at GW. In a recent commitment, the University is also taking steps to reduce gun violence in the United States with other schools. On the downside, we found out we lost two historical GW community members who shaped the GW we attend today.
To catch you up with the latest, here is the best and worst of this week’s headlines:
Thumbs Up:
In an email obtained by The Hatchet Wednesday, lecturer Gregory Maggs, who co-taught a Constitutional Law Seminar with Clarence Thomas, told students Thomas is no longer teaching this fall. His name has already disappeared from the GW Law course list. The reason for his absence is simply that he is “unavailable,” according to the email. Whether Thomas willingly made this decision or not, it reflects the desires of more than 11,000 people who signed a petition in the past month, demanding his removal from the law school’s faculty. Thomas supported stripping the basic right to bodily autonomy away from all people who can get pregnant when he voted to overturn Roe v. Wade in June. His stances against gay marriage and protecting contraceptives further prove he is unfit to teach any course at the University. Even though GW itself did not directly remove Thomas as the petition had urged, his absence is still a resounding victory. 
The University should officially fire Thomas to keep him from teaching here ever again. Good riddance.
GW joined the other schools in the District last week in a national initiative to end gun violence. The Consortium of Universities of the Washington Metropolitan Area – a coalition of 20 colleges and universities, including GW – created the 120 Initiative to advance plausible and actionable solutions to fighting gun violence in the United States. The name of the initiative honors the consortium’s estimate of 120 or more victims of gun violence who die every day on average, an unacceptable number that should be reduced to zero. This epidemic deserves more attention, and this initiative is a great first step toward depoliticizing deaths due to gun violence. Risa Zwerling Wrighton, interim University President Mark Wrighton’s wife, is personally joining the initiative after she penned an op-ed in The Hatcher earlier this month calling for better gun control in the United States. This initiative outlines potential solutions that can pressure leaders and officials to develop an action plan that they can implement in six months’ time. No more words, thoughts and prayers – this country needs action.
Thumbs Down:
Two impactful and historic GW community members have died within the last month. Roderick French, a former professor and vice president of academic affairs, died in June at the age of 93 after dedicating 28 years of service to GW. Norma Lee Funger, one of the namesakes of Norma Lee and Morton Funger Hall, died earlier this month at the age of 90. She was a philanthropist and donated to improve GW’s schools, like the Columbian College of Arts and Science and the Elliott School of International Affairs.
An expected heat wave in the District nearly sent temperatures into triple digits last weekend. In preparation for D.C.’s hottest conditions in six years, Mayor Muriel Bowser enacted an emergency heat plan that opened cooling centers and 11 public pools throughout the city. D.C. residents experienced over 95-degree heat throughout the day Sunday, and Monday had a heat index of 102 degrees. If you’re outdoors as the extraneous heat continues into this week, stay safe and make sure to cool off!

The Senate unanimously passed legislation creating a committee that will re-evaluate the governing documents and standardizes the documents' organizational system.
Student Association senators passed two bills to improve and clarify the body’s governing documents at their meeting Monday in the wake of the SA’s presidential power struggle last month.
The Senate unanimously passed legislation creating a committee that will reevaluate the governing documents and standardizes the documents’ organizational system. The reevaluation of the governing documents comes after executive cabinet members used Article 15 in the SA constitution to unanimously vote to oust SA President Christian Zidouemba from the top position earlier this month, citing a lack of confidence in his ability to lead. That move was later reversed, and Zidouemba continues to hold the presidency.
Sen. Henry Deng, CCAS-U, sponsored the Governing Documents Committee Review Act, which will create an eight-person committee to “examine and evaluate” the current Student Association governing system. Deng said the Act follows a requirement that the governing documents be updated every three years, but the importance of the revision period has “increased” after the SA presidential power struggle earlier this month.
“Some parts of governing documents, such as Article 15, can be and need to be amended to prevent anyone in the SA from abusing their power,” he said.
The SA constitution mandates that the document be reviewed every three years. SA members last transitioned to an updated constitution in April 2020, and this bill requires the committee to finalize its findings by spring 2023.
Senators unanimously passed the Unified Coding System Act, which will combine the SA bylaws with the Student Court’s bylaws and will standardize the numbering system to alleviate confusion by using either sections or articles as the organizational units. Sen. Kai Simson, CPS-G, who sponsored the bill, said he intends to keep all the documents in the same place to make them “more accessible.”
“If left unaddressed, we will continue to see misinterpretations of our governing documents, especially on how our branches of the SA are supposed to operate, leading to more unnecessary Student Court cases,” he said.
Senators unanimously voted to confirm three senators and four other students to the Joint Committee on Faculty and Students.
Three senators will serve on the Joint Committee on University-Wide Programs Fund. Vice President Yan Xu said the committee will allocate about $200,000 to $300,000 on large-scale events that contribute to “campus-wide culture.”
The newly created University-Wide Programs Fund uses funds that used to be part of the SA finance committee’s budget and reallocates them to large-scale and multicultural events. Funds are allocated to the finance committee and the program’s fund from a class credit fee that students pay during registration.
President Christian Zidouemba said in his regular presidential report that he will meet with executive director of GW Dining Douglas Frazier Thursday to get an update on the dining halls and fall dining plan, after officials announced dining halls would not be complete in time for the fall semester.
The final summer Senate meeting will be held August 8 at 8:30 p.m. over Zoom.

Metro said they are also rolling out more 6000-series railcars, bolstering the number of cars available for service. 
The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority announced Thursday that service on the Blue, Orange and Silver lines during weekdays would increase next month. 
WMATA announced that because of the increase in trains, riders can expect a train every 15 minutes on weekdays and the wait will not exceed five to eight minutes, the transit agency said in a release. Metro said they are also rolling out more 6000-series railcars, bolstering the number of cars available for service. 
“Improving service for customers is how we will restore the confidence of the National Capital Region,” Randy Clarke, Metro general manager and chief executive officer, said in the release.
WMATA pulled all of its 7000-series railcars — 60 percent of total trains — from operation for safety inspections last October after a train derailed near the Blue Line’s Arlington Cemetery stop, resulting in delays at all stops. Metro said in the release that they are working to return the 7000-series rail cars as part of a “phased approach.”

Officials reimplemented University-wide hiring efforts last fall after lifting the hiring freeze put in place in spring 2021 to limit the financial fallout of the pandemic. 
The Columbian College of Arts and Sciences will add 24 new permanent, full-time faculty members this fall, according to a University release.
The release states that the 24 new faculty members will join departments in the sciences, social sciences and humanities and will raise the total number of full-time faculty members to 491, a figure that does not include full-time visiting or research faculty. The slew of new hires comes after faculty department chairs reported difficulty hiring new full-time professors last year and officials reported a 6 percent drop in full-time faculty hires during fall 2021 when compared to fall 2020.
“Columbian College will welcome 24 new permanent full-time faculty this fall, adding expertise to disciplines across the sciences, social sciences and humanities,” the release states.
Officials reimplemented University-wide hiring efforts last fall after lifting the hiring freeze put in place in spring 2021 to limit the financial fallout of the pandemic.
CCAS officials looked to make a dozen faculty hires as part of a school-wide push to bolster diversity within the school after community members launched a petition that garnered more than 1,000 signatures in spring 2021 asking officials to “cluster hire” minority faculty.
“We now have an opportunity to transform our curriculum, our teaching approaches and our faculty through these new hires,” CCAS Dean Paul Wahlbeck said in an email at the time. “This effort will continue on searches going forward.”

The Metro has been in crisis for nearly a year, as half of its train fleet has been forced offline due to wheel malfunctions for almost ten months.
New Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority General Manager Randy Clarke started his role amidst a challenging era for the Metro on Monday.
Clarke’s start date was originally scheduled for earlier this summer but he needed a “break” after resigning from running Austin, Texas’ transit system, according to a Washington Post article. Clarke said improving safety for passengers and service frequency are his top priorities as general manager.
“Crawl, walk, run,” Clarke said in a Washington Post article. “We’ve got to get service back to a reliable, frequent level that everyone can rely on and be really proud of.”
Clarke said addressing the Metro’s more long-term problems like the finances and business model will come after addressing safety and frequency. On his first day, Clarke rode the Metro to work from the Foggy Bottom station, leading a long trail of media into the station.
Clarke has worked in the transportation industry for more than two decades, including serving as the chief executive of the Austin-based Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the chief safety officer at the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority in Boston.
Metro’s last CEO, Paul Wiedefeld, stepped down in May along with two other top executives after officials announced further train service delays due to a failure to properly recertify more than 250 train operators.
The Metro has struggled to regain passengers after the COVID-19 pandemic and is experiencing its biggest crisis since 2015 after a train derailed on the Blue line last October that led to major delays and suspended rail services.
The derailment forced Metro officials to pull more than half of the city’s railcars after an investigation linked the derailment to a wheel and axle assembly malfunction on 7000-series trains. The 7000-series trains remain sidelined nearly 10 months later, continuing the delays.
“You’re not going to hear me differentiate a lot between service and safety,” Clarke said in an article. “I’m a fundamental believer that if we are delivering service, it is safe. That’s not a choice.”

Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas' role as a lecturer at GW Law faced scrutiny after he voted to overturn Roe v. Wade.
Updated: July 27, 2022 at 4:33 p.m.
Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas will not teach a Constitutional Law Seminar this fall, according to an email addressed to students in the seminar that was obtained by The Hatchet.
Gregory Maggs, who has co-taught the course with Thomas since 2011, stated in an email addressed to the class that Thomas is “unavailable” to co-teach the course in the fall, and Thomas is no longer listed as a lecturer on GW Law’s course list. Thomas’ withdrawal from the course comes a month after more than 11,000 community members signed a petition demanding his removal from GW, but officials declined to remove him from his role after he voted to overturn Roe v. Wade.
“Unfortunately, I am writing with some sad news: Justice Thomas has informed me that he is unavailable to co-teach the seminar this fall,” Maggs said in an email obtained by The Hatchet. “I know that this is disappointing. I am very sorry.”
Thomas did not immediately return a request for comment. Maggs deferred multiple requests for comment to GW’s communications office.
“The seminar has not been canceled but I will now be the sole instructor,” Maggs said in the email. “For those of you still interested in taking the course, I assure you that we will make the best of the new situation.”
University spokesperson Tim Pierce said Thomas notified GW Law that he was “unavailable” to co-teach the seminar this fall.
“The students were promptly informed of Justice Thomas’ decision by his co-instructor who will continue to offer the seminar this fall.” Pierce said in an email.
Pierce declined to say if Thomas’ withdrawal is permanent or if the University expects Thomas to return to teaching in future semesters. Pierce also declined to say whether Thomas’ unavailability is related to the reversal of Roe v. Wade and the subsequent student protests against the justice.
Fifty student leaders penned an open letter last month calling on GW to remove Thomas from teaching after the reversal of Roe v. Wade. Thomas wrote a concurring opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the case that overturned Roe v. Wade, also calling on the Court to reconsider rulings that protect contraception, same-sex relationships and same-sex marriage.
“Academic freedom means to learn freely and fairly – absent of discrimination,” the letter reads.
Provost Christopher Bracey and GW Law Dean Dayna Bowen Matthew said in an email to the University community last month that Thomas’ views “do not represent” the views of GW Law or the University as a whole, but said employing Thomas will allow students to exchange ideas and that debate is essential to the University’s educational mission.
“Just as we affirm our commitment to academic freedom, we affirm the right of all members of our community to voice their opinions and contribute to the critical discussions that are foundational to our academic mission,” last month’s email states.
This post updated to include the following:
This post was updated to include Maggs’ deferral of requests for comment to GW’s communications office. This post was also updated to include Pierce’s comment.
