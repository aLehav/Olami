The COVID-19 pandemic has placed financial strain on millions of Americans. Some of these cash-strapped Americans have used sex work through websites like OnlyFans to make some extra cash. The only issue facing these workers is that the practice is criminalized – and we’re still trudging through a pandemic. 
While sites like OnlyFans are not exclusively used for sex work, the platform has rapidly become a haven for sex workers because they can make connections and get paid through the platform – a relatively safer way of finding clients during the health crisis. But its online popularity has also brought to light the validity of sex work that has been debated in the District for years. The only issue standing in the way of the profession is the D.C. Council, which has the opportunity to recognize it and ensure sex workers can continue their work. 
Late last month, the D.C. Council struck down a bill that would have decriminalized the selling and buying of sex. But with the new year comes a new Council. On Jan. 2, those who were elected to office in November will be sworn in. As this new wave of legislators rolls in, the Council must reconsider the legislation and recognize sex work – one of the oldest professions in history that is worthy of protections. 
Sex workers have been advocating for their profession’s decriminalization for decades. While they have made a little headway nationwide, there is still a long way to go until the country changes its mind on the validity and morality of sex work. If the District decided to decriminalize sex work, it would set a precedent for other major cities like Los Angeles, New York and Chicago to follow suite. 
The bill is especially important to pass during the COVID-19 pandemic. During this crisis, sex workers were excluded from receiving a stimulus check in the CARES Act – putting them in an even more dire situation than they previously were. Should sex work be decriminalized, it would be one step closer to allowing their trade to be federally recognized and given the assistance they need during these tumultuous times – be it legal or medical assistance. 
In Nevada, the decriminalization of sex work in certain counties has allowed for the legalization of regulated brothels that create tax revenue, provide regular tests for sexually transmitted infections and get workers off the streets where they are likely to be victims of other crimes. While some workers have faced issues with the high bar that is set for sex workers in these counties, there is no denying that working within the law is safer than working outside of it. 
The criminalization of sex work also puts those in the industry in serious danger because it promotes no police contact. If a sex worker is a victim of a serious crime that should be reported to the police, it is likely that they will not seek help or assistance because they are likely to get slapped with fines and charges. In some states, more than one prostitution charge equates to a felony – encouraging those within the industry to try and fly as below the radar as possible, which makes them more susceptible to being victims of violent crimes. 
Organizations like The Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have called for the decriminalization of sex work after staggeringly high victimization rates among prostitutes. Sex work is one of the most dangerous professions to be in, and those within it deserve to protect their health and safety. 
You don’t have to agree with the moral and ethical actions surrounding sex work, but that should not get in the way of providing a vulnerable community with the ability to organize and protect themselves. Decriminalizing sex work is not a moral issue, it is a human rights issue and needs to be seen as such.

The arrival of the COVID-19 vaccine has placed the end of the pandemic within view, as the first round of shots is administered to health care workers at GW and beyond. Despite the good news, cases and deaths are rising as the country barrels toward a dark pandemic winter.
Here’s the best and worst of this week’s headlines.
Thumbs Up: 
After months of waiting and hoping, the rollout of the Pfizer-NioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is finally underway. Five GW Hospital workers became the first people in D.C. to receive the shot, and the rest of D.C.’s 85,000 heath professionals will follow. The District, like virtually every jurisdiction around the country, is planning a phased rollout – health care workers and vulnerable populations will be offered the vaccine before the general public.
Initially, the federal government only allotted about 7,000 doses of the vaccine to the city due to its scarcity at this early stage. But both Maryland and Virginia will each provide the District with 8,000 more shots to help the inoculation effort, citing the fact that three-quarters of D.C. health care workers live in those states.
This is incredible news – full stop. The arrival of the vaccine is the beginning of the end for a pandemic that has taken thousands of lives and destroyed countless livelihoods. As D.C.’s political class likes to say, “our long national nightmare is – almost – over.”
Thumbs Down: 
Even though the COVID-19 vaccines are here, the pandemic’s death toll is shattering records for cases and deaths. The COVID-19 crisis is the worst it’s ever been in the United States – and the District is feeling the pain too. The onset of the frigid D.C. winter and the holiday season have delivered a one-two punch to people’s adherence to gathering and distancing guidelines.
As a result, Mayor Muriel Bowser issued an order closing down indoor dining throughout the District until Jan. 15 and extending D.C.’s state of emergency through March.
This move was absolutely necessary, even though it’s painful for residents and businesses. It will take months before the vaccine reaches the general public, meaning mask wearing, social distancing and avoiding gatherings remain the best ways to slow the virus’s spread.
Students who are coming back to D.C. for this spring need to be especially mindful of the crisis in the District. The temptation will be undoubtedly strong to pile a dozen of your closest friends into a tiny apartment to hang out for the first time in months. But throwing caution to the wind is how you infect yourself, your family and your community. Being smart about COVID-19 does not mean you have to totally cut yourself off socially, but it does mean sticking to the guidelines for just another couple of months. We’re almost there.

Though the GW community was scattered across the globe this year, we’ve gone through a lot together.
The year started with a bustling campus and ended with an empty one. Just three days after the District confirmed its first presumptive COVID-19 case, the University sent students home for, at the time, two weeks of online learning. Responding to increasing cases nationwide, GW quickly changed course, announcing that the rest of the semester would be held remotely like hundreds of schools across the country.
Faculty and students quickly adapted to remote learning. Dozens of Foggy Bottom community members rallied to help vulnerable populations weather the health crisis. Students and professors grappled with life at home, picking up extra jobs, taking care of their families and trying to find time away from a computer screen.
The pandemic pushed The Hatchet, like offices, organizations and departments across campus, to make changes of its own. We stopped printing a newspaper in late March as campus emptied out and began operating over Zoom from all over the world. We’ve kept in touch with our readers through copies of our print edition, newsletters and social media posts. Thank you for supporting us every step of the way.
Thanks to you, we’ve been able to cover the University’s slew of decisions, from laying off hundreds to halting GW’s 20/30 Plan. We traced students’ and faculty members’ calls for University President Thomas LeBlanc to resign throughout the year, which met an obstacle after the Board of Trustees reiterated its support for him.
Our staff has followed student, staff and faculty activism both on campus and from afar. In February, we covered a week’s worth of protests over GW’s fossil fuel investments after LeBlanc revealed GW’s holdings in the industry. As protests over racial injustice took shape around the world, we covered calls for police reform and ongoing pushes for changes to the Marvin Center and Colonials’ namesakes, which culminated in task forces evaluating each name. And after banding around political hopefuls for months, we reported celebrations over President-elect Joe Biden’s win.
We’re honored to be recognized for our work. Our coverage picked up several awards from the Society of Professional Journalists and Associated Collegiate Press, including best online college newspaper. Our stories covering basketball games, demonstrations over police brutality and the University’s pandemic response earned honors, and we couldn’t have done it without readers like you.
The pandemic has shed light on the importance of independent student journalism, even when it’s perennially threatened by finances. We’ve leaned on readers like you more than ever to help us through the year, and we hope you continue to support us through the end of the year. Please consider supporting student journalism with a tax-deductible donation this holiday season. You can donate here.
Thank you for reading The Hatchet in 2020. From everyone on staff: Have a safe and happy holiday season.

Restaurants in D.C. hope to use bubble tents, or "igloos," to keep diners eating outdoors as temperatures plummet this winter.
For many working in the food industry, restaurants are not just a place of work. Coworkers are like family.
Saying goodbye to some of those family members was one of the most difficult parts of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tonic at Quigley’s Managing Partner Jeremy Pollok said. Tonic laid off about 75 percent of its employees in mid-March, cutting its staff down to about 25 people.
“You get really close with people and then all of a sudden – I’ve never seen anything like it, people are just gone,” Pollok said.
In the past nine months, restaurants across the District have been forced to lay off staff, reduce menu offerings, temporarily shut down or permanently shutter. Restaurant owners across Northwest D.C. said the personal toll of the pandemic on their businesses is just as bad as the financial one, and they’ve tried to help out their former employees by recommending them for other jobs or creating new business models to get employees rehired.

The personal toll of the pandemic 
Constantine Stavropoulos, the owner and CEO of the Tryst Trading Company, which owns The Diner in Adams Morgan, said the pandemic and related layoffs have taken a toll on staff morale.
Some of the people who were laid off had been working at The Diner for more than a decade, and he said it hurt for him to lay off staff who depended on their jobs to support their livelihoods.
“This is my life, it’s been my life for 22 years now, and it’s the life of my family,” he said. “On a personal level, it was just sad not to have staff there, not to go to work and see faces and see people that we know.”
The Tryst Trading Company’s staff shrunk from 324 to six employees after the shutdown in mid-March, but they’ve since been able to “slowly build it back up.” Staff is required to wear masks and gloves at all times and take their temperatures when coming into work.
Although The Diner has employed both outdoor and indoor seating in the past months, Stavropoulos said sales are still down about 80 to 85 percent.
“We’re all about community gathering, coming together,” Stavropoulos said. “Tryst is like one big public living room. So the idea of not being able to share and have the community come, it was a big hit to us. It was a big hit to all restaurants, but ours in particular in the sense that we weren’t doing a lot of to-go business.”
Since 1958, Ben’s Chili Bowl on U Street has withstood long-term construction and riots, but the D.C. classic faced one of its biggest challenges yet in the pandemic – sales were down 90 percent overnight after the shutdown in March and the restaurant has not offered indoor dining since March 15.
Vida Ali, one of the family members that owns the restaurant, said the U Street location quickly pivoted their business model to rely on delivery and contactless pickup services like Uber Eats, GrubHub and Toast. Ali said some workers had young kids or lived with elderly people and were worried about coming in to work, so the owners gave employees the choice to come back.
Despite the financial challenges presented by the pandemic, the restaurant has donated about 6,000 meals to hospital workers, teachers and protesters in the past nine months. Shortly after, Ben’s Chili Bowl started to receive monetary donations with requests to send food to hospitals around D.C.
“People started hearing that we were doing that,” Ali said. “And then they started donating money to us and saying, ‘Hey, can you do some for Washington Hospital Center? Can you do some for GW?’”

Working to rehire staff
Some restaurant owners said they needed to recreate business to get staff rehired by expanding take-out options or launching new dining options.
Dan Simons, the co-owner of Farmers Restaurant Group, said in mid-March the company laid off 1,100 employees across its locations in D.C., Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania.
To get back some employees, the company launched an e-commerce platform called Founding Farmers Market & Grocery in which customers could purchase anything in their supply chain, from prepped meals for brunch at home to flour, hand sanitizer and toilet paper. The group also added Founding Farmers chocolate, a collection of house-made chocolates available for pick up and delivery, to their product line.
The new business model allowed the company to rehire about 800 employees to fulfill the online orders, he said.
“We diversified the operations by just expanding the product line to anything that would naturally come through our supply chain that we knew that our customers wanted or needed at home,” Simons said.
Farmers Restaurant Group employees are required to go through an in-person health screening before each shift, and the company employed an app that allows employees to track their co-workers’ health and even conduct a health screening from home.
The group also publishes an updated COVID-19 dashboard that details employee health including confirmed coronavirus cases, flu vaccinations, days of paid sick leave and the safety precautions taken by each restaurant. He said the system helps build trust and confidence with staff who may be hesitant to return to work.
Kramerbooks and Afterwords, a 44-year-old bookshop and café in Dupont Circle, said the restaurant invested in 10 dining igloos, or “bubble tents,” to add to their 19th Street “streatery” as temperatures continue to plummet to keep business afloat. The joint also created a sandwich pop up called Fedwich, allowing them to rehire staff to fulfill orders.
“If you’re a server, there’s no tables to serve,” Salis said. “And having to tell those people they were furloughed was really tough. And then, you know, cooks, there’s no food to cook, and booksellers have no guests to talk to. And so we were able to reallocate a lot of those tasks to fulfill the orders.”
Looking ahead 
As of early December, more than 80 D.C. restaurants and bars have closed due to the pandemic, including former GWorld vendors Burger, Tap & Shake and Bertucci’s.
Tonic at Quigley’s, Farmers Restaurant Group, Kramerbooks and Afterwords Café, The Diner and Ben’s Chili Bowl all received loans or grants from the Paycheck Protection Program, or the D.C. government, like the Streatery Winter Ready Grant Program, which set aside $4 million to help restaurants winterize with $6,000 grants.
Despite the funding, Mayor Muriel Bowser’s office implemented new restrictions on dining amid rising cases both in the District and nationwide. Effective Wednesday at 10 p.m. until 5 a.m. Friday, January 15, restaurants in the District may not seat patrons indoors, and non-essential businesses must use telework options.
Despite the added challenges of staying afloat, restaurant owners said they are still optimistic about the months ahead with the new dining innovations that have come about as a result of the pandemic, like the igloos and take-out options, which are permitted under the temporary regulations.
“It’s a very resilient industry,” Salis said. “There’s a lot of really great ideas not really always coming from us, calling around and asking what others are doing. And it’s really been a trying moment, but I’m very optimistic about what we’re going to do this winter.”
Ali, a Ben’s Chili Bowl owner, said the restaurant faced several challenges since the restaurant’s founding more than six decades ago, from the Metro’s construction in front of the store to the 1968 riots following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. She said if Ben’s could withstand these obstacles, then the pandemic “shall pass.”
“When those kinds of things happened, it gave us more credibility in the community and in the culture,” Ali said. “This is a place that withstood the time, it withstood all the ups and downs and is still standing.”

Locals are gathering donations to fund the burial of a homeless man who died at an encampment near campus earlier this month.
The man, referred to as Karim, passed away at the E Street encampment across the street from the Elliott School of International Affairs earlier this month, according to a tweet last Wednesday. The fund has raised more than $1,500 from 44 donors so far, with a goal of reaching $1,800.
Qaadir El-Amin, the fundraiser’s organizer, posted an update on the GoFundMe page last Friday, thanking donors for their support and contributions.
“Thank you all so much,” El-Amin said on the site. “When I try to explain what community means, this is it. All of the love and support for my family just fuels me to find better and more ways to help people that need it. Thank you all for being a blessing from God.”
El-Amin did not return a request for comment.
Students have fought to protect the residents at the E Street encampment for years, most recently helping them clear out their belongings as city workers cut down a tree and scattered wood pellets across their settlement earlier this fall.
Washington City Paper reported that 75 individuals experiencing homelessness have passed away in 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the public health inequity plaguing the city’s already vulnerable population. This year’s total marks a slight decrease from 2019, when 81 unhoused individuals passed away.
The District plans to cut funding for homeless services, which could make local nonprofits less capable of aiding the homeless population in the city, DCist reported earlier this month.

Contee said he expects MPD officers "to demonstrate compassion for people wherever they are on the road of life" and resolve conflict with care and discretion to forge a partnership with community members.
Mayor Muriel Bowser named GW alumnus Robert Contee III as her choice to be the next chief of the Metropolitan Police Department during a press conference Tuesday.
If confirmed by the D.C. Council, Contee will succeed Peter Newsham, who announced last month he will step down to head the Prince William County Police Department after leading MPD for more than three years. Contee, a D.C. native who’s worked for MPD for 31 years since he joined the department as a cadet during his senior year of high school, said he hopes to focus on reducing violent crime, which currently stands at record-high levels, and fostering community engagement across the District.
“It is my great honor to lead the Metropolitan Police Department, to be the standard of excellence for policing in the 21st century,” Contee said at the press conference. “There’s room at the table for anyone and everyone who is committed to ensuring focused, balanced and fair policing in our nation’s capital. It’s time to go to work.”
He said he plans to listen to local residents to ensure the department’s crime-fighting strategy grounded in “communication, cooperation, collaboration and participation” aligns with the community that he hopes to involve in open discussion.
With community engagement as one of his top priorities, Contee said he expects MPD officers “to demonstrate compassion for people wherever they are on the road of life” and resolve conflict with care and discretion to forge a partnership with community members.
“It has been my distinct honor to serve this city for all of my adult life,” Contee said. “You can expect me to model the behavior that I expect from you. You can expect fairness, and I expect you to be fair with members of the community. You can expect me to build relationships because we cannot have partnership without relationship.”
Contee said that as assistant chief, he created a training program in which officers visit the National Museum of African American History and Culture to learn about and understand the experiences of African Americans.
MPD’s website states that before he became assistant chief, Contee served as commander of three of the city’s eight police districts, and Bowser said he has also overseen three of the department’s five bureaus.
Contee earned his bachelor’s degree in professional studies with a concentration in political science at GW, according to MPD’s website.
Contee said the current rate of crime in D.C., where more than 800 people have been shot this year, is “unacceptable,” and he plans to hold violent offenders accountable to ensure safety is enforced within crime-ridden communities.
“I know there are many families in our communities that seek justice for loved ones that have been victims of violence, and I assure you that the Metropolitan Police Department will be relentless in our pursuit of criminals that make communities unsafe,” he said.
Contee said his immediate priorities as chief will be to ensure New Year’s celebrations and the presidential inauguration remain within the boundaries of public health and safety protocols amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Bowser said she decided to select Contee for the job because of his longstanding familiarity and understanding of D.C. and its communities.
“Not only is he going to bring his experience as an officer but as a resident of this town as a Black boy and now a Black man who has experienced the best and worst of Washington D.C. to the table, to all of those discussions,” Bowser said.
Bowser noted how Contee’s relatability to the city’s youth drives his ambitions for the department’s role in the city.
“What strikes me most about Chief Contee’s many many experiences and talents is his belief in young people,” she said. “When we spoke last week, he said the highest honor for him is to give back to the city that raised him and that becoming chief is a testament to what happens when you give kids a fair shot.”
Outgoing MPD Chief Peter Newsham congratulated Contee on his appointment and attributed his experience with MPD and his native ties to the District to his character and qualification to serve as chief.
“His story is the man who he is,” Newsham said. “I could not be more proud of him today. He has a very deep bench at MPD that will support him, and I know that he will be successful in this job and will continue to move the Metropolitan Police Department in a positive direction.”

A student who was arrested while praying on campus in 2018 is suing the University for enabling a “negligent, discriminatory and intentional act,” allegedly having been assaulted by police during the arrest.
In a five-page complaint filed in the D.C. Superior Court Thursday, Juanita Abii, a fourth-year graduate student, alleges the University harmed and discriminated against her when a priest’s request for her to leave the GW Newman Center, which houses a Catholic chapel, after closing time escalated to her arrest and allegedly violent assault while in custody. The $1 million lawsuit levies allegations of intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligence against the University, which Abii alleges is responsible for unnecessarily calling in police.
“Ms. Abii went seeking after solace at the GWU Newman Center that night, but she was most unfortunately met with discriminatory treatment and brute force,” the complaint reads.
The complaint states Abii, who was experiencing depression and anxiety at the time, was praying in the chapel following evening mass at the Newman Center on Dec. 5, 2018, when a presiding priest asked her to leave without telling her why. Abii said she didn’t realize the center was near closing time, but after continuing to kneel in prayer despite the priest’s calls for her to leave, the priest called GW Police Department officers, who arrived and in turn called Metropolitan Police Department officers, who arrested her.
“MPD did not need to be called,” Abii said in an interview. “I don’t know why they brought MPD, so that’s kind of the crux of this entire thing – is it didn’t need to be escalated to that point.”
University spokesperson Crystal Nosal said officials are aware of the complaint but have not yet been served with it.
“The complaint only presents the plaintiff’s side of the story,” Nosal said in an email. “The University looks forward to vigorously defending the case.”
Abii alleges that MPD officers “pounced on her” as she was still kneeling in the chapel, arrested her and brought her to jail where she was “assaulted, choked and maced in the face” by police. The complaint states Abii was not allowed to contact her family members, namely her mother and sister, while she was in custody.
“I’m not sure why it had to be escalated to that point,” Abii said. “It was an extremely traumatizing, extremely unnecessary situation that I don’t think anybody, any student should have to go through.”
An MPD report filed after the incident states a man named William Brendan Keene asked Abii to exit the building 15 times before GWPD officers arrived, and the officers also asked Abii to leave. The report states Abii resisted GWPD officers before MPD officers arrived and arrested her, and she was placed in hand restraints, patted down and transported to the Second District station “without incident.”
The report states Abii was “not cooperative” with GWPD and MPD, and she declined to share her personal information upon arrest. The incident occurred between 6:36 and 7:36 p.m., according to the report.
Abii was charged with unlawful entry, the report states.
Abii needed to receive medical treatment for her injuries from the alleged police-involved assault, creating additional expenses, according to the complaint. Since the arrest and alleged assault, Abii has suffered “extreme stress, worry, anxiety and nightmares,” the complaint states.
“Plaintiff deserved better from the University she called home since 2010,” the complaint reads. “The University she has paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to in order to secure a quality education from. Her humble posture (kneeling in prayer) was not enough to grant her empathy or grace in that moment. Instead she was treated cruelly and like a criminal.”
The complaint states the Nwaneri Law Firm, whose attorney Ogo Nwaneri represents Abii, sent the University a demand letter in hopes of settling the dispute outside of court last month, but officials rejected the terms. The letter requested officials to issue Abii a written apology, reimburse her with $500,000, seal her criminal record and roll out “campus-wide reforms” through anti-bias, de-escalation and mental health training.
The complaint notes the incident’s alleged continuation of GWPD’s “well-known record of racist and discriminatory practices against African-American students on campus.”
“I can categorically state that this extreme response that the Plaintiff was met with would not be the same response a similarly situated White student would receive,” the complaint states. “There was a myriad of other appropriate ways of handling this situation.”
Abii said she hopes the lawsuit will help influence “systemic change” and reform within GWPD’s and the University’s handling of crisis management so other students don’t have to encounter a similar experience. She said officials should focus on protecting students rather than punishing them or calling MPD for assistance.
“If every time there’s a situation on campus that they escalated to MPD, then what’s the point of having GWPD on campus?” she said.
GWPD Chief James Tate, who joined the department in January, has focused on reforming the department and amending students’ relationships with officers over the past year after an officer allegedly pushed a student down a set of stairs in February. He has overseen the implementation of body-worn cameras and upgrades to its training program and hiring process, and he plans to release the department’s first-ever racial profiling report and start limiting police presence in low-crime areas next year.
Tate called GWPD training “woefully inadequate” in June before his new reforms started rolling out this fall.

Metrobus riders will be required to pay a $2 fare again beginning Jan. 3, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority announced Thursday.
Metro officials suspended the fare in March, when passengers were required to board through the rear entrance to minimize passenger contact with drivers at the front of the bus, where the ticket collection box is kept. Starting Jan. 3, riders will board the bus via the front entrance and pay for a ticket, which Metro officials said will help the authority navigate the financial toll of the pandemic.
“With everyone wearing masks, shields for operators on every bus, and enhanced daily cleanings, front-door boarding is safe, expands our capacity for more riders and helps us resume some normalcy,” Metro General Manager and CEO Paul Wiedefeld said in a press release. “We also need to collect fares from every rider to keep essential Metro transit employees working and continue to provide essential service.”
WMATA is currently facing proposed budget cuts that would drastically reduce service, including eliminating weekend train service, closing 19 stations, instituting train arrivals every 30 minutes and cutting several bus routes.
The press release states that reinstituting bus fares falls in line with the transit recovery plans in cities like Chicago and Philadelphia.
Congress also passed Monday a $900 billion coronavirus relief bill, which included millions in aid directed for public transportation authorities like WMATA to circumvent the drastic service cuts.
