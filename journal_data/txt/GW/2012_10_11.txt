Full details of GW’s 10-year strategic plan draft surfaced Tuesday, proposing between $300 and $400 million worth of investments for ideas like a center for classified research and academic programs devoted to AIDS and obesity.
The 29-page plan reaches far across each part of the University and includes a new section devoted to enhancing the arts, social sciences and natural sciences, including improving performing arts venues and paying to bring “prominent policymakers” to campus to lecture and teach.
It also sharpens the University’s focus on becoming interdisciplinary, putting actions and ideas behind the often-used GW buzz word. The full draft – to be finalized in February – outlines how students’ academic choices could completely change over the next 10 years to allow them to study multiple fields at once.
Provost Steven Lerman announced some major parts of the plan last week at the Faculty Assembly. He said instead of enrolling students in separate schools – which “undermines students taking full advantage of all that our university has to offer,” according to the plan – they would be admitted to the University as a whole.
The restructuring of undergraduate academics would also pave the way for more interdisciplinary programs, like the one in sustainability the University launched this year. The plan proposes minors in topics like security, AIDS, obesity and poverty.
“GW students frequently come to the university because of an interest in addressing societal problems and these additional minors will provide more opportunities to integrate this interest with their academic program,” Lerman and Senior Vice Provost for Academic Affairs and Planning Forrest Maltzman said in an email.
GW would also create more pathways for students to earn a dual bachelors-masters degree in policy tracks across disciplines, especially for students with vast Advanced Placement credits.
To give students more opportunities for internships, the University would also launch a scholarship program to make up for the unpaid positions.
Research expansions are also significant parts of the plan. GW expects to spend $20 million to $30 million over the next 10 years to create new interdisciplinary research centers. The University will also review existing centers and cut them off if they’re not producing enough research.
But the University would also look to widen research by rolling back its ban on classified research to build a facility for it on the Virginia Science and Technology Campus.
“Allowing classified research will help ensure that GW researchers interested in doing research of importance to our national defense and homeland security are able to address some of the nation’s most important needs,” Lerman and Maltzman said.
That would reverse GW’s 2003 policy on classified research, which says it “is not compatible with open communication of knowledge within the academic community because it places restrictions on which faculty and students can access research data, the facilities required to carry out research, and/or research results.”
The draft also solidifies details already confirmed, like increasing the international undergraduate population from 7 to 14 percent and creating up to 100 new tenure-track faculty positions.

Student Health Service will begin offering free weekly clinics for HIV testing later this month.
The two-hour clinics, which will be held every Wednesday, will save students the highly criticized $25 fee, which campus leaders say deters students from getting tested.
SA President Ashwin Narla and Executive Vice President Abby Bergren began lobbying for the fee’s removal this year, but the University said free weekly clinics would make it easier for staff to handle the expected influx of appointments.
“It’s a move in the right direction. it brings a lot of awareness to the issue,” Narla said, “The hope would be that there are more students who get tested.”
SHS administered 528 HIV tests last year, about 200 fewer tests than the year before. Narla and Bergren said the drop in numbers showed that costs were a barrier to students.
Medical Director for SHS Isabel Goldenberg said the clinics would be an expansion of the SHS free testing events held twice yearly around campus, which drew about 40 students from around Foggy Bottom last year. She said the tests would be held at the center to ensure confidentiality for students getting tested.
“We have done similar clinics throughout the year, at SHS as well as other locations around campus. The idea would be to do them more regularly than in the past,” Goldenberg said.
Eight schools that GW considers its peers, including New York, Boston and Emory universities, already provide free HIV testing through their student health offices. Six including Northwestern and Georgetown universities charge fees ranging from $15 to $80 for their HIV testing.
Narla said he and Bergren will now work on raising awareness about the new option and also publicize GW Hospital’s free HIV tests. Walk-in testing has been free at the hospital since 2006, but the SA leaders say few students know about the option.
Samuel Garrett, co-chapter leader and policy director of the Student Global AIDS Campaign, has lobbied to remove the HIV test fee for two years. He worked with the SA to increase free HIV testing options on campus.
He said the best option is keeping the format of appointments to get tests, rather than the clinics, but added that he said he is happy the University is willing to “expand access to free testing on campus” through events or clinics.
“For too long, expensive appointment fees, along with a perceived lack of risk and the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS, has served as a barrier to students who want to get tested,” Garrett said.

The Hatchet incorrectly reported that Samuel Garrett is the vice president of Student Global AIDS Campaign due to misinformation on the online directory for student organizations. He is in fact the co-chapter leader and policy director. We regret this error.

More than 300 men joined fraternities this year, bringing the total number of men involved in Greek life to an all-time high.
Fraternity membership jumped nearly 15 percent this year, to a total of about 1,273 members, after chapters wrapped up their fall rush Friday night.
The fall pledge class totaled 15 more members than last year, with a net growth of 196 across fraternities, more than filling the spaces left by last year’s large graduating class, said Mateo Forero, vice president of recruitment for the Inter-Fraternity Council.
Ten of the University’s 17 chapters now have more than 80 members, with four tallying more than 100 members. Chapters took an average of 18 new members – identical to last year’s average, but Forero said six chapters exceeded the average fall pledge class size.
Forero said after rush, the IFC would begin seeing the effects of a new policy this fall that allows chapters to extend bids outside of the formal rush. He said there are about 115 men who did not join chapters but are registered on the IFC’s registration website, Interactive Collegiate Solutions. His chapter, Beta Theta Pi, plans to keep in touch with some.
Delta Tau Delta had the largest pledge class this year, a total of 38 men. The chapter grew nearly 80 percent to 82 members.
The University’s smaller chapters, including Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Kappa Alpha Order, saw the greatest percentage increases besides Delta Tau Delta. Sigma Alpha Epsilon more than doubled its four-member chapter and Kappa Alpha Order grew by 66 percent when it added 20 new members.
Forero said he saw not only numbers increase, but also the quality of the men who decided to join, which he credited to more intentional talks about the benefits of Greek life beyond its social scene.
“Yeah, we’re social fraternities, we have fun, but there are other great things that we do and we’re able to show and lead by example,” Forero said.
IFC President Dan Gil agreed, and chapters spent more time training members this year to talk about other parts of fraternity life.
“We’re getting the message across that we’re not just here to party,” Gil said. “We’re here to form a brotherhood, learn from each other, get leadership opportunities, do service and philanthropy. We’re bringing out the guys we want to see in our fraternity and the people who really share our values.”
Christina Witkowicki, director of Greek life, said chapters tried to communicate all the “responsibilities of being a member of a fraternity” before students officially joined.
“Our IFC fraternities have made a conscious effort in the recent past to tell their stories better,” Witkowicki said.

GW will pour more money into tenure-track faculty hires after at least a decade of some schools clamoring for more funds.
With the University’s education, medical and public health schools inching toward meeting GW’s benchmark for a tenure-track faculty core, the draft of the 10-year strategic plan calls for up to $100 million in spending on permanent professor positions.
The plan said the spending would reverse a University-wide trend of student body growth outpacing tenure-line faculty hires.
Fifteen years after its founding, the School of Public Health and Health Services says it has collected enough funds from the University to finally meet the Faculty Code mandate to fill three-quarters of professor spots in each school with tenure-track professors.
Josef Reum, SPHHS’s senior associate dean, said a lack of funds had forced the school to slow down its hiring plans, which hurt their prospects of attracting top professors.
Reum said the school now employs 74 percent of its about 80 professors in tenured or tenure-track positions, its highest rate ever. Four years ago, that figure was 42 percent of SPHHS faculty.
The public health school expects to meet the full-time, tenure-track faculty mandate by January, looking to fill a total of five spots.
“It’s been a 10-year process, and every year we’ve been able to contribute more to hiring new faculty,” Reum said, adding that he did not know how much has been invested in faculty hires.
Reum said SPHHS, hamstrung then by a nonexistent endowment and squeezed facilities, has now become the University’s best success story. The school controls the largest research portfolio of any college at GW and will move into a new building in 2014.
The percentage of tenure-track faculty at the University has declined from 66 to 61 percent over the past decade, which follows national trends, Jenn Nichols, a senior program officer at the American Association of University Professors, said.
She said hiring fewer tenure-track faculty hurts what universities get back in research and teaching.
“If you’re worried come April or May [of] every year that you may not have a job in a few months, you can still be committed to students and teaching, but you have to keep one eye open to what you have to do to support yourself,” she said.
The Graduate School of Education and Human Development and the School of Medicine and Health Sciences are also redoubling their efforts to hire full-time, tenure-track faculty this year.
GSEHD Dean Michael Feuer said the school, which employs about 66 percent tenure-track faculty, could soon reach the threshold because of financial support from the University for new full-time positions.
Out of eight faculty searches that will be underway this year, he said three will be brand new full-time positions.
“In the next couple years, it’s going to be paced a little more quickly, and it means a lot to us,” he said, declining to give a target date for when the school could meet the Faculty Code.
Mary Futrell, who led GSEHD from 1995 to 2010, said the school has historically lacked support from top administrators and trustees for hiring, which hurt its ability to attract top faculty, despite growing enrollment and high rankings.
Lerman said he and Feuer had worked out hiring plans to prioritize tenure-track hires.
“Full-time hiring in his school fell behind,” Lerman said, adding that he supports Feuer’s efforts to rework budgets to prioritize hires.
The medical school is also making strides to improve its tenure-track rate, which was 67 percent last year.
Jeffrey Akman, the school’s interim dean, said in an email that he recruited four new tenure-track faculty this year, but that the school is at a disadvantage because there is a “shortage of applicants in some disciplines of Health Sciences who are qualified to teach in programs like Physical Therapy and Physician Assistant studies.”

Athletic success depends on a healthy lifestyle. To achieve either, it takes extensive practice and dedication. And both demand making the right decisions when grocery shopping.
After an early morning practice Saturday, the men’s rowing team headed to the Foggy Bottom Whole Foods Market to meet with healthy eating specialist Katherine Albers to learn tips and tricks for making the right daily nutritional decisions.
The session began with a simple mandate from Albers, who gave the Colonials a quick way to make snap decisions about food purchases: “If your grandmother doesn’t know what’s in it, don’t get it.”
From there, the team walked through just about every aisle in the supermarket, beginning with an array of fresh fish arranged on ice. Salmon is the best choice, Albers said, because it is relatively inexpensive and boasts important fatty acids. The Colonials passed rows of colorful fruits and vegetables, finishing with Whole Foods’ varied selection of rice and grains.
Albers told the team to stay away from any food that includes trans fats, and cautioned them to read ingredient lists instead of blindly trusting packaging. For example, just because the label says the bread is wheat, Albers explained, does not always mean it is made from whole grains. It was an important lesson, senior Adam Bair said – especially for student-athletes, who already require more food than the average student.
“Bigger guys have higher base metabolic rates, like most of us are over 2,000 calories based on metabolic rates anyway,” Bair said. “So that means if I just sat and did nothing the entire day, I would burn over 2,000 calories.”
The tour was interactive, with the team trying samples of sweet potato chips, trail mix, performance bars and almond butter as examples of food that would work well with their training regimen.
Knowing what food to choose to supplement their exercise is vital, senior rower Sam Goldberg explained. He said members of the men’s rowing team typically burns about 1,000 calories in an hour-long workout – and GW tends to have 18 hour-long workouts over the course of a single week. Bair estimates the Colonials eat between 4,000 and 6,000 calories daily to make up for the deficit, about two to three times more than the normal recommendation.
“An hour of us working out, that burns about a thousand calories, so just to get back to zero we have to eat a thousand calories,” Goldberg said. “And then we need to eat more because we have fast metabolisms and need to be gaining muscle.”
Attempting to juggle being a student, athlete and make healthy food choices can be daunting, Bair acknowledged, and there’s always temptation to grab whatever’s easily at hand, rather than consider its nutritional value.
“Sometimes, with exams and everything and just being exhausted, there’s a point where you’re burning so many calories you do just eat to eat because you have to get it in,” Bair said.
But drawing upon the lesson of the team’s Whole Foods trip, he explained that the wrong nutritional choices can detract from the time spent training.
Education on a healthy lifestyle might seem like a different approach to rowing than time spent training on the water and on erg machines, but supplementing the team’s physical activity with the proper food intake makes those workouts more worthwhile.
“If you’ve ever eaten McDonald’s, it feels like it’s almost taking food out of you instead of putting it back in,” Bair said. “Taking the time to actually have something more nutritious just generally benefits you in the long run.”

Senior Rosemary Holt clutched rosary beads and bowed her head Tuesday afternoon.
Outside an F Street abortion clinic, the Washington Surgi-Clinic next to The Dakota residence hall, Holt stood with a weekly prayer group. For four years, the weekly demonstration – a gathering that  Newman Catholic Student Center chaplain Father Greg Shaffer has dubbed “Rosary for Life” has run. Sixteen students turned out Tuesday.
Holt, co-president of Colonials for Life and a member of Army ROTC, said her connection to her anti-abortion stance is deeply personal.
“I exist because my mother chose life. Life for me. She made this choice knowing she faced opposition from family and friends and that it would not be an easy route,” Holt said of her mother’s unplanned teenage pregnancy.
Holt said she uses her personal story to give a face to unintended pregnancies, which she said are often construed as burdens. Her 
mother’s sacrifices – turning down a chance to go to Harvard or Rice universities – put aside “the selfish desire to be young and carefree.”
 “She taught me a valuable life lesson: that women deserve better than abortion, because no woman should be forced to choose between sacrificing her future and sacrificing her child,” Holt said.
The prayer session, as the group calls its meeting, is “not just a protest,” junior Chris Crawford, director of the Newman Center’s pro-life ministry added.
“We’re praying for change of hearts, for women considering abortion, for the doctors, for the workers in the clinic, and we’re praying that they’ll have that change of heart and take up a different line of work or make a different decision,” Crawford said. “It’s very important to us not to bother anybody or be aggressive.”
He added that the group is also meant to show support for women considering abortion.
The medical office offers both chemical and surgical abortions through the second trimester of pregnancy – up to 26 weeks after conception. Clinic employees declined to comment.
Sophomore Lisa Campbell, vice president of GW Catholics, also said her involvement was inspired by personal experience with unplanned pregnancy. Campbell’s sister found herself pregnant at 19 and chose to have her baby despite pressure to get an abortion.
“My niece is the biggest blessing that my family has ever had bestowed upon us,” Campbell said. “I just encourage everyone to give that blessing a chance.”

Dark comedy will shock the West Hall Theater this weekend with the graphic and controversial play “The Pillowman.”
While the show’s themes range from child abuse to psychological trauma, its central element largely revolves around the limits of artistic expression. Katurian, the play’s main character, is arrested when child murders in his town are similar to the events of the twisted stories he authors.
“The content is horribly dark,” senior Nick Barbara, who plays Katurian, said. “Without the energy and the jokes, [the show] would be horrible.”
To maximize the show’s emotional impact, it will be staged in the round, with the audience surrounding the actors. The small, 
intimate cast – consisting of only four actors – and the black box theater space will serve to enhance the drama.
Director of the show, senior Jenna Duncan, said she proposed “The Pillowman” not only for the shock factor of its twisted plot, but also for the cathartic experience it provides audience members.
“There’s such a deep, human connection between these really twisted characters,” Duncan said. “It’s the idea that they’re complex enough where you do sympathize with them, even when they’re torturing a prisoner or writing stories about murdering children.”
Senior Sean Quitzau, who portrays a volatile and vengeance-seeking police officer, added that beyond the dark material, the show ultimately reflects upon the human experience. He said that each character “leaves his mark and leaves a piece of themselves behind.”
A faulty light board in Lisner Auditorium Downstage also moved the production to the Mount Vernon Campus’ West Hall Theater, adding another challenge on top of limited resources and the difficulty of coordinating schedules.
“I think it’s sort of something to be doubly proud of. In any setting, the show would be incredibly difficult, but I think that it’s a wonderful production, particularly considering our hindrances,” Duncan said.
“The Pillowman” will premiere at the West Hall Theater Oct. 11 at 8 p.m.

More than a year after mounting cameras to monitor City Hall balconies, the University is warning students they could lose access if noise and smoking complaints persist.
University Police Chief Kevin Hay said the department received three noise complaints from students about other residents this year for rowdy balcony behavior.
In response, signs were posted throughout the residence hall and house staff sent out emails threatening to revoke balcony access.
A student was caught smoking a cigarette on a balcony, which Hay said contributed to the crackdown on balcony usage in the junior and senior residence hall. Smoking is “not allowed in residence halls for both health and safety reasons,” he said, adding that one student this academic year was reported to the Dean of Students office for smoking on a balcony.
One resident also reported finding a “broken, glass smoking device” on the balcony, expected to have fallen from a floor above.
The University also threatened to ban balcony use last year, after neighbors reported finding broken glass bottles on their property – thrown by students off their City Hall balconies. In August 2011, UPD installed three surveillance cameras to watch the terraces. UPD has not received any injury or disorderly conduct complaints from Foggy Bottom residents neighboring City Hall so far this academic year, Hay said.
“We believe the cameras serve as a good deterrent,” Hay said. He did not respond when asked if the cameras were effective in catching balcony incidents, but added that incident numbers fluctuate from year to year.
“The decision to put up the signs was a proactive measure by the University, based upon complaints brought to the attention of housing staff,” Hay said.
Vernon Williams, a Center for Student Engagement staff member, said most residents behave appropriately and that the University is “not venturing down the road” of restricting balcony access.
“In previous years, similar signs have been helpful in drawing awareness to community issues,” he said.
Senior Joshua Perkins, who lives in a City Hall room with balcony access, said he does not understand why the University would threaten balcony privileges for every resident as a result of few individuals’ actions.
“Even though [the University] installed these cameras, instead of confronting one or two people, they’re taking route to close balconies to everyone,” Perkins said. “It seems pretty draconian to be honest.”
He added that the policies are a “bit hazy” pertaining to smoking since smoking is not stated as prohibited on balconies, according to the University’s housing website.

This election season, the role that the federal government plays in higher education is at stake.
Vice President Joe Biden and Congressman Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., will square off Thursday at this year’s vice presidential debate. And while the performance of the candidates is unlikely to sway the election in either direction, the audience will get a chance to see the two competing philosophies and their parties’ approaches to solving the problems that plague higher education.
But the GOP platform is out of step with the realities facing students in this election.
As a member of Congress, Ryan proposed an economic plan which called for significant funding cuts to education. And by asking Ryan to be his vice presidential candidate, Mitt Romney has signaled to the public that he shares Ryan’s visions, priorities and values on education. If they take the White House, the GOP has plans to cut education funding by 5 percent – a fact Romney denied at the first presidential debate.
Republicans take the position that education should be funded through the private sector, making it more difficult for students to receive federal grants and loans to pay for college. Effectively, the Romney-Ryan ticket discourages getting a college education.
By making it harder for students to pay for education, the GOP suggests that a college degree is not important. The fact of the matter is that a college education is increasingly becoming a critical component in finding success in America today. But Romney’s comments about his views on education are startling, to say the least. In his view, “Flooding colleges with federal dollars only serves to drive tuition higher,” according to Romney’s campaign policy paper on education.
Statements like this indicate Romney’s disconnect with reality. He doesn’t seem to understand that, by making it harder to receive student loans, it would be more difficult for many to afford college. He doesn’t seem to really believe education should be a priority for the majority of Americans.
Ryan’s plan would drastically shrink the number of students who would be eligible to receive Pell Grants. These grants are one of the ways the government can help fund college for those who cannot afford to pay increasingly expensive tuition costs. And realistically, cutting federal funding in this respect will limit the number of students who will be able to attend college.
Ryan’s plan would also cut funding for elementary and secondary schools. And while, upon first glance, it seems as though these budget cuts will not affect college students, cuts to education anywhere hinder students everywhere.
During President Barack Obama’s term, he has worked – despite pressure and blowback from Congress – to make education a priority through consistent federal funding. For instance, he created a tax credit for college students that could add up to $10,000 in savings over their collegiate careers. And unlike Congressional Republicans like Ryan, Obama has advocated to maintain the Federal Pell Grant and Stafford loan systems – not destroy them.
For the past four years, the government has shown a vested interest in the finances of college students. If Romney and Ryan took office, there would likely be less concern shown toward students and their finances.
It should be the role of the federal government to work to help students afford college. Under a Romney and Ryan administration, students would be treated more like the perpetrators of the financial crisis than its victims. Romney has to realize that students didn’t create the financial mess that plagues the state of higher education. They didn’t ask for student loans, debt or a difficult job market after college. But they do expect their public servants to help them work through their difficulties.
And leaders from both parties should oblige them.

Hundreds of brightly dressed, sign-waving women packed University Yard on Tuesday to greet their chapters’ newest crop of members, which for the first time in several years halted growth.
Chapters gave out 17 percent fewer bids, or formal invitations, to join a sorority this year. A total of 408 women received bids Tuesday, the final day of fall recruitment. Last year, about 512 women received bids.
Eight out of the 10 chapters participating in recruitment this year reached the Panhellenic Association’s chapter quota, which is based on the level of potential new member interest on the final day of recruitment.
Chapter quota was set at 42 members this year, and the average chapter size was 41. Last year, that figure was close to 50 new members.
A total of 610 women registered for recruitment, meaning 202 women dropped out throughout the process, similar to past years.
Chapters did not have to report the number of women who accepted bids by publication time, Valerie Berg, Panhel’s vice president of recruitment said.
GW has 11 chapters, but Kappa Delta, the University’s newest sorority, will hold recruitment later this month.
Tuesday, known to chapters as Bid Day, marked the end of recruitment, an intensive weekend-long process that acquaints potential new members with each of the University’s chapters.
As chapters greeted their new members for the first time with balloons and new t-shirts, singing and chanting could be heard from blocks away.
Marta Cofone, president of the Panhellenic Association, said she is looking forward to seeing the new members gel with their chapters. She said the new members should feel proud for completing the stressful recruitment process, which she said she began planning in January.
“Bid Day is just so great when you get here and you meet with your new chapter, and it’s just such a warm feeling,” Cofone said at the event.
Angela Link, a freshman who will join Phi Sigma Sigma, said initially said she was not sure if she wanted to join a sorority, but said she is excited to get to know her sisters better.
“I’ll have connections and be able to ask for advice from people who are older than me,” Link said.
Megan Lehrer, who decided to join Sigma Delta Tau, said she was a little overwhelmed by the chaos of the event. She said she was excited to see the benefits of Greek life, calling it a “lifelong sisterhood.”
After welcoming the pledges, Pi Rho Chi members, or Panhellenic Recruitment Counselors, rejoined their sororities after temporarily disaffiliating from May to October to serve as unbiased representatives of Greek life,.
About 25 percent of students are involved in Greek life. The Panhellenic community has more than doubled in the last decade.
