Students and community members can now submit their complaints or praise for the University’s security personnel and policies directly to GW’s top safety leader through an online form.
The form that went live Jan. 6 serves as a gateway for individuals to lodge formal feedback straight to Senior Associate Vice President for Safety and Security Darrell Darnell, a move designed to increase communication with leadership on public concerns.
“One of the things I wanted to achieve out of the website was making sure I didn’t have one-way communication, that there was ability for people to communicate with me, which is the reason I started my Twitter and the reason for this [form] as well,” he said. “I think it’s very important that people have a way to give us information as well.”
The form includes the University Police Department, the Office of Emergency Management and the Office of Health and Safety – divisions that fall under the umbrella of Darnell’s Office of Safety and Security.
He estimated that his office previously received about one comment monthly without a formal system for filing the notes.
“I don’t know if I will get an increase in complaints or commendations, but I thought it was important to provide the GW community with an efficient and hopefully easy process in which to communicate directly to me their concerns, suggestions or ideas for maintaining our safety and security, or improving the safety and security services my office provides,” Darnell said.
University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard said comments would help keep Darnell’s office in the loop about concerns. Based on the scope of each comment, his office would either handle the complaint or commendation, or reroute it to the appropriate department.
One UPD officer, who asked to remain anonymous because officers are not authorized to speak to the media, said he thinks the new form would help solicit more feedback from students.
“It makes it seem like everyone’s got a hand in what goes on,” he said. “If an officer is acting out, it should be reported.”
The form can be found at www.gwu.edu/safety, and individuals may submit comments anonymously. Commenters can choose to designate whether they are students, staff, faculty, parents, neighbors or other.

The headline for this article was updated on Jan. 18, 2011 to reflect the following:

A recently launched shuttle service is giving Foggy Bottom’s senior citizens a ride to local supermarkets, following the shutdown of the Safeway at the Watergate Complex in December.
The free bus service transports residents ages 60 and above to and from the Trader Joe’s on 25th Street and the Georgetown Safeway.
The solution came after 1,300 local residents signed a petition in the fall attempting to keep Safeway open, citing concerns ranging from food affordability at other grocery stores – like the recently opened Whole Foods Market at The Avenue – and a lack of convenient access to options further away.
“A lot of people are pleased to know the shuttle is there,” Armando Irizarry, who represents the Watergate Complex on the neighborhood’s top advocacy group, the Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission, said.
After hearing his constituents’ food shopping woes, Irizarry contacted Family Matters of Greater Washington, a social service organization, to arrange the shuttle service.
Rinaldo Washington, the organization’s coordinator for the project, said up to 14 passengers at a time can ride. He added that nearly every seat has been filled during rides and passengers have expressed enthusiasm and gratitude for the service.
“We are pretty excited about working with Ward 2 seniors, and we are here to work with seniors in the District, so we are happy to do that,” Washington said. “As long as seniors in Ward 2 see a need, and we are able to do it, it is something we will continue to do.”
The shuttle will run every Wednesday this month, departing from the Watergate East driveway at 10 a.m. and returning between 11:30 a.m. and noon.
Marija Hughes, a senior citizen who lives at the Watergate and started the petition to keep Safeway open, said the service seems to be a hit among her elderly neighbors, who typically face issues including immobility, limited Internet access and tight income.
“Some of the people are not mobile and cannot get around without a car,” she said. “If we don’t have a grocery store today, we are happy, we are ecstatic, to have at least the bus.”
She said Watergate residents still hope another grocery store will eventually move into Safeway’s old location at the complex.
Penzance, the management group for the space, did not return a request for comment.

Universities will have to shoulder higher salary costs for researchers working with grants from the National Institutes of Health, a new rule that this fiscal year’s federal budget mandates.
The NIH, an agency that provided nearly half of GW’s research money in 2010, lowered its salary cap for outside researchers by $20,000 in the federal budget passed by Congress and signed by President Barack Obama Dec. 23. The drop in coverage means that thousands of dollars for researcher salaries, previously paid for by federal money, will now come from university budgets because of federal funding constraints that have embroiled Congress over the last year.
“I realized it would have an impact the moment I heard about it,” Anthony-Samuel LaMantia, the director of the GW Institute for Neuroscience, who is performing three research projects supported by NIH grants, said. “The main thing though is that it’ll have less of an impact on [researchers] initially and more on universities as they figure out how to pay people at their current salary levels when they can’t cover it with grants.”
Sally Rockey, deputy director for extramural research at the NIH, said the agency will send out directions to universities about the salary cap soon, but did not elaborate on a specific time frame for the guidance. Universities are still waiting to hear whether the rule will apply to all outstanding NIH grants or only for grants awarded this year.
GW’s senior leadership “is poised to address this issue and make any necessary changes once official guidance is provided by the NIH,” Vice President for Research Leo Chalupa said. He declined to elaborate on his office’s reaction to the announced change.
The NIH’s application of the rule will likely dictate how much additional money the University will have to spend and how it will finance future medical research.
The University received $56 million from the agency in research grants and fellowships in 2010, most of which was awarded to biostatistics.
Medical researchers at GW expressed concern that the squeeze will put their compensation for research in jeopardy and make their work less attractive to the University.
“It is potentially very damaging to our research center,” Sarah Fowler, a research professor in the GW Biostatistics Center, said.
Fowler added that the center’s researchers depend on salary support from the NIH because, “of the 110 people at our center, almost all are 100 percent on research grants from NIH.”
LaMantia said universities could resist hiring researchers in the future if paying their salaries would incur higher costs.
“It will hit universities hard because they weren’t prepared for it,” LaMantia said. “GW’s research leadership is superb, so they will weather this well, but it may cause all institutions to detract somewhat because they won’t be able to afford a larger faculty.”
The University has tried to ease its reliance on federal grants by engaging in more corporate-backed research since the hiring of Tom Russo, GW’s first assistant vice president for industry research, in October.
Still, Katrina Billingsley, who oversees the financial management of NIH grants as director of administration in the biostatistics center, said corporations might not be as helpful with medical research.
“Industry research only funds the things that industry is interested in. It doesn’t necessarily fund all research that would be good for the public,” she said.

The University will announce its new leader for the Center for Alcohol and other Drug Education Tuesday, the first step in reevaluating its approach to substance abuse prevention.
Alexis Janda will serve as CADE’s associate director, a position that has been vacant for four years.
Janda formerly worked as assistant director for programming at Fordham University, where she managed drug education services and student organizations.
She and Assistant Dean of Students Tara Pereira – who oversees the University’s abuse prevention and behavioral offices – will begin a “listening tour” in February to explore how CADE can more effectively communicate with students, including specific outreach to athletes and freshmen.
The office – which runs the “BeWiser” campaign, Responsible Alcohol Manager training and student organization event registration – could do more to interact with students, Janda said. Goals for the overhaul will be formalized after Janda and Pereira gather input from the GW community.
Last summer, Pereira directed the revamp of Student Judicial Services – now two offices that respond to behavioral violations based on severity. Janda’s hiring also comes on the heels of the University’s revisions to its alcohol policy, a process that began in November.
“I want to get to know people and see what they need and want, and what it is that they’re looking for from CADE, so we as a community can mold CADE into what it is that GW wants and needs,” Janda said.
Janda most fondly recalled working directly with students at Fordam, where she coordinated student organization events.
She graduated from the University of Maryland in 2010 with a master’s degree in higher education administration. During that time, she lived in a fraternity house as a mentor to its members.
Pereira said Janda’s approachable personality distinguished her from other candidates during the months-long search for CADE’s leader.
“I felt like Alexis just could connect with the student population and connect with this area and felt really strongly that she was the right one to help us move CADE forward,” Pereira said.
Pereira previously emphasized her desire for a candidate with experience preventing sexual violence to complement the University’s launch of its formal sexual assault policy. Janda does not have a background in that field.
CADE has been without an official leader since 2008, when Brian Hamluk left for another post at the University. Katie Bean, assistant director and the highest-ranking member of CADE after Hamluk’s departure, left earlier this year for a similar job at St. Joseph’s University. Bean and Pereira took on larger roles in the office to compensate for the vacant associate director position.
The hiring decision came after last month’s public presentations by the final two candidates open to staff and students. During her presentation, Janda emphasized her approachable nature, but didn’t lay out details on how she would change or lead CADE.
Representatives from Janda’s previous post at the Office of Student Leadership and Community Development at Fordham did not return requests for comment.

Welcome back GW! While most of us have probably already broken our New Year’s resolutions, here are some that we hope the University community keeps over the next semester.
The men’s basketball season opened with heightened excitement as head coach Mike Lonergan ushered in a new era for Colonials basketball. While it is no secret that the team has struggled in recent weeks, students should still come out to the Smith Center to support the Colonials.
Fans must have patience with Lonergan, as he is implementing a new coaching style for a team almost exclusively made up of players recruited by former head coach Karl Hobbs. Constructing a new system of play takes time, as a team cannot start over and build from the ground up in a matter of months. So give the new team time, as miracle turnarounds for sports teams only happen in the movies.
Fans should not abandon Lonergan, especially after his outreach efforts toward the student body last semester. He should be rewarded by continued home game attendance despite the team’s recent struggles.
The Colonials still have a chance to regain their footing with conference play, and will certainly need the full support of the student body. After all, Lonergan has always stressed the importance of having a strong home-court advantage.
Students continue to suffer through the effects of cutbacks in the University student life division, most notably in facilities. This past semester, students often expressed frustration over FIXit requests while Facilities Services was unable to thoroughly clean and inspect all residence hall rooms.
The University should consider funneling some of the savings from the Innovation Task Force directly to student life, or creating a similar system of cost-saving measures for student life. Extra funds for student life could relieve the pressure of cutbacks on programs such as facilities, or perhaps provide additional resources to the new Center for Student Engagement.
Where the University finds sustainable savings solutions it should direct funds equally toward student life and academics. The community will surely benefit in the long run from major ITF funding, but there are basic student concerns today that must be addressed as well.
Last year was a turbulent year for the University Counseling Center, marked by both a major triumph and troubling leadership. At the start of the academic year, the University made the first six UCC sessions free – a promising move for increased access to vital mental health resources. But a slew of public allegations of mismanagement by former UCC director John Dages and Associate Director Barbara Brown seriously crippled UCC’s credibility and community trust in the organization.
Dages’ resignation is a signal to the community that the University is responding to these troubling statements, but Brown remains as the associate director. As long as she remains at the UCC, the center’s reputation remains tenuous. Recently-hired Vice President of Human Resources Sabrina Ellis should make it a priority to reconsider Brown’s continued leadership.
The University’s month-long review of UCC has been keen to curate student concerns and recommendations, but it must be transparent in its plans as it moves forward. Dean of Students Peter Konwerski needs to reconsider his decision to not make the report public, as hiding the results does nothing to increase public trust in the organization. Providing information about the effort it is taking to improve UCC’s battered image will only restore student body faith in the organization.

The University filled the vacancy of its top human resources executive this week, a move that dovetails with its mission to establish itself as a top employer in academia.
Sabrina Ellis emphasized the top priority in her new role will be to raise the visibility of GW as an excellent place to work, echoing a goal voiced by University President Steven Knapp in December.
Chosen after a months-long nationwide search, Ellis assumed the role of vice president of human resources Tuesday. She will supervise the University’s personnel records, benefits, staff recruitment and learning, compensation, client services and equal employment opportunity programs.
“GW is an institution of exceptional academic quality; my goal is to build an HR infrastructure that mirrors the excellence that is apparent across the University,” Ellis said. She plans to develop more specific plans after familiarizing herself with the University.
The top HR position was vacant for five months after former Chief Human Resources Officer Louis Lemieux resigned in July to return to the private sector.
“Her experience in human resources management, faculty and staff development, employee engagement and information technology will enhance the University’s capability to respond to the complex and diverse needs of its workforce,” Executive Vice President and University Treasurer Lou Katz, who ran the search, said.
Ellis previously served as assistant vice president and chief human resources officer at the City College of New York – an experience she said taught her how to build a high-performing team. Before her time at City College of New York, she was a human resources director at New York University, where she earned her bachelor and graduate degrees.
In her former position, Ellis worked closely with the provost to combine hiring processes for faculty and administrators under one umbrella. She also redirected discussions of tenure and research activity through human resources – benefits that schools often funnel through academic offices.
Ellis also implemented a PeopleSoft personnel software system, which streamlined City College of New York’s digital records.
“The most important lessons I’ve learned over the years is the importance of listening, showing compassion and always treating others with dignity and respect. In my view, the best workplaces are those that incorporate these principles,” she said. “When it comes to HR, everything starts and ends with people.”
City College of New York President Lisa Staiano-Coico called Ellis’ appointment to GW “an important acknowledgement of the caliber of our staff here at City College” in a statement. During her time at City College of New York, Ellis expanded on-campus student employment and expedited foreign employee visa processing, Staiano-Coico said.
Ellis will assume the title of vice president – a change in name only from chief officer, Katz previously said, although Ellis will assume a new place in Knapp’s cabinet.
Knapp said in December that he hoped the new HR executive would help “build internal trust” and a “culture of fidelity” at the University, as well as facilitate benefit selection and training opportunities for faculty and staff.
Ellis declined to comment on the resignation of the University Counseling Center’s director, John Dages, after he faced charges of mismanagement from former employees – a complaint handled by the human resources office. She also declined to say if the center would be a priority in the early stages of her tenure at the University.

The experience offered by the Student Association is something like sitting through a bad movie. While the names and faces of the characters might be different, it feels like you’ve seen the same ending a dozen times before.
With a new semester upon us, it is difficult to measure just how much SA President John Richardson and Executive Vice President Ted Costigan have achieved during the first half of their terms as they have been working on bigger picture University-backed projects and programming. Costigan points to the removal of the $50 University Counseling Center fee as a major breakthrough for the community, and a success for the SA.
“People have come up to both John and I over the past months and said that they now seek help because the fee no longer exists,” he explained.
Richardson did not respond to requests for comment.
But that fee was removed at the start of this academic year,  and since then, few reforms promised by our top student leaders have taken shape.
Sadly, this is politics as usual at GW. Since the foundation of the organization in 1967, the Student Association has been mostly locked in a routine of overwhelming promises and underwhelming action. The community saw great success from the SA last year when former president Jason Lifton and EVP Rob Maxim picked perennial student problems and lobbied for change. But that was the exception to the SA rule.
Rather than standing around and pointing fingers, the time has come to diagnose the problem itself. And with this new semester, the SA – and the GW community – must seize this opportunity to make improvements to the community in earnest.
The first and most obvious barrier to legislative success at GW involves the priorities of student senators.
The Student Association is modeled after the United States federal government for no logical reason. Senators are not only bound by an 11-article constitution, but must also be familiar with an array of official bylaws and senate rules. Richardson’s executive branch is composed of nearly two dozen separate cabinet members and directors, each of which boasts a job title more elaborate than the last.
In 2006 and 2009, the senate was so preoccupied with rewriting the Student Association constitution that little other legislation was even mentioned. Again, in 2010, senators spent nearly two whole meetings debating changes to the election system and to their own bylaws.
These unnecessary complexities serve only to create distractions. When the Senate enters office riding on promises of grand campus improvements, its efforts should not end up directed toward unimportant internal changes. It impedes progress they pledged to work on. Rather than becoming wrapped up in internal matters, senators must instead direct their full focus towards the actual demands of the community. Even though the Senate can only pass non-binding resolutions, these leaders should use their influence to work with the administration on student issues. Senate lobbying would reenforce the work done by the executive branch, or could bring smaller issues to light. When the administration sees collective effort by student’s elected leaders, they will be more apt to listen than if only visited by the executive branch.
Come election time each March, students momentarily rekindle their excitement for the SA. They help plaster posters to the walls of the Marvin Center. They attend rallies in University Yard. They line up in front of ballot boxes, eager to cast a vote for change. But as soon as the winners are announced, students are all too willing to curtail their own involvement in campus reforms.
Rather than entrusting elected leaders with the task of reforming GW, students should willingly offer their own support.
Junior Phil Gardner, who campaigned in 2011 to abolish the SA, says a unified, assertive student body is the only way to guarantee results on campus.
“Imagine if to protest the 9-cent printing fee, students started calling [University President] Steven Knapp’s office all day every day. It wouldn’t be able to function. You think they’d still be unable to plug that hole in their budget that would be created from the lost printing revenue? Highly doubtful.”
Costigan affirms that the Student Association’s successful campaign to eliminate the University Counseling Center fees stemmed from its ability to “coalition build with other students, house staff and administrators”.
If we hope to see progress on an even larger scale, we have to preserve that spirit of a community effort – if any shreds of it remain. While the SA itself must maintain a clear focus on student advocacy, contributions from the administration and student body are equally important to the success of future reforms.
We’re sick and tired of predictable endings. It’s time to rewrite the script on the Student Association.

“I know myself, but that is all.”
That was Amory Blaine’s final epiphany in F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel “This Side of Paradise.” It represents the culmination of his journey to finally define who he truly is.
Amory can be viewed as an ambitionless young man who seemingly wastes his youth, accomplishing little and struggling to determine his purpose and path in life.
Yet despite his shortcomings, many students at GW would likely be envious of Amory, especially now. Amory’s journey of self-exploration and soul-searching seemed quite foreign to me this winter break as I immersed myself in internship applications, networking leads and résumé-boosting activities.
This is what a long break has become for students.
One of the University’s greatest strengths – access to prime internships and jobs – is also a weakness. The hype surrounding the sexy internship and job options here can make students too career-programmed, which can be harmful for us as students and young adults.
In my dreamy conception of what college is supposed to be like, it is four years that largely shelter one from real-world issues such as jockeying for a job or planning a career path.
And while college should be a time to think about the future, there is a danger in hastening its arrival. The problem with the rush for the coolest internship or job is that it creates pressure to have a defined career-path and plan for the future, potentially diminishing one’s college experience.
This stress can lead many to believe that they must pick only majors that are marketable to employers, rather than ones that they truly love. Or, one might avoid a philosophy class because it supposedly doesn’t provide the skills necessary for the modern workforce. It can create the false perception that in these four years, there is no time for personal exploration, for experimentation or for – gasp – mistakes.
Now don’t feel threatened, GW Career Center. My point is not that all internships are evil or that students should immediately walk out of the Hill office where they work. But too often, we fail to maintain perspective on what these four years of college should really be about.
As I look forward to my final few semesters, my idealized image of college is quickly crumbling. My future shouldn’t be pestering me, because I am only 20 and still have time to make sense of the world just as Amory does.
So as I begin a new semester, I can only hope that such a college experience will become reality. I might not want my life to be just like Amory’s, but his own self-discovery is truly a triumph of its own, and one we should more often seek.
Even if it doesn’t fit perfectly into the ideal résumé mold.
