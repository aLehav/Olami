Congratulations, graduates.
What you’ve witnessed in the last four years as students in D.C. was nothing short of amazing.
Those interested in the social sciences saw the election of the first black president and the demise of Osama Bin Laden. To mark those occasions, you rallied at the White House, a treasured symbol of the democratic ideal, just blocks from GW.
Students studying science and engineering saw historic natural events like “Snowpocalypse,” a tsunami in Japan with nuclear consequences, a rare D.C. earthquake and a devastating hurricane that struck our northern shores. In the aftermath of these disasters, you dug out, pitched in, navigated social networks to raise funds and road-tripped to rebuild.
Aspiring journalists witnessed extreme examples of homegrown domestic and international terrorism, and worked to explain the chaos through tweets and other social media tools — which were barely imagined a short while ago.
Time and time again, when issues around the world erupted — including the Arab Spring and the drawing down of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — emerging diplomats and policymakers engaged in advancing the concept of civil society and fostering fruitful discourse.
Those of you in business and economics saw the federal sequester, and each of you and your families focused on financing a college education during the greatest recession in generations.
As each of these monumental moments swirled around us, you persevered to achieve an incredibly important academic milestone, and today you can call yourself a college graduate. I hope you take a few moments to reflect not only on your time at GW, but also on how you have grown. I hope you continue to learn life lessons from these historic experiences, happening both here and abroad.
Hopefully, being at this unique epicenter of action will help you long into your future, particularly as you put your passions into action through all that awaits you after graduation.
And remember, no matter your major, industry or future academic or professional path, continue to apply the leadership skills gained from study groups, team membership or student organization roles. Long after you leave GW, your degree will represent your responsibility to serve as a citizen and contribute to make our planet a better place.
Thank you for choosing to earn your academic achievements at our university. You enriched the lives of so many across our campuses and the District, and we all look forward to supporting and celebrating your successes for years to come.
Peter Konwerski is the senior associate provost and dean of student affairs.

The Board of Trustees approved a nearly $2 million decrease in financial aid funding Friday, the first drop in six years.
The aid pool will fall to $161.5 million for next academic year, down from the University’s $163.4 million allocation last year – ending a trend of consistent aid hikes since the 2008 recession, a period in which administrators have committed to using generous scholarships to draw in smarter and more diverse students.
Vice Provost for Academic Affairs and Planning Forrest Maltzman defended the move, attributing the smaller aid pool to a diminished undergraduate population as of next year. The University is expecting a freshman class of 2,370 students, while graduating an unusually large class this year.
Maltzman said in an email that funds will still allow for a larger amount of aid per student because of the smaller freshman class.
New freshmen will see a larger aid pot. The discount rate – the percentage of tuition revenue that goes toward scholarships and grants – will rise from 35.7 percent to 38 percent for new freshmen. For the undergraduate population as a whole, the discount rate will slim down from 39.6 percent to 38.7 percent.
Maltzman said that decrease is also due to the Class of 2013 being more highly discounted than later classes.
The move comes on the heels of a 3.4 percent tuition hike for new students, a standard increase that the board approved in February.
About 10 to 15 percent of students asked for more financial aid this year, marking the first year the number of appeals did not decrease since the U.S. pulled out of the recession in 2009 and GW began pouring more funds into aid.
University President Steven Knapp said Friday that the University was still committed to using financial aid to diminish students’ debt loads.
“When it comes to student aid, we’re doing what we can,” Knapp said. “What we would like to be in a position to do, in cases of meritorious students, is replace more of their loans with grants, if we could do it — if we can reduce their debt burden — and that’s something we have been focused on.”
Although 87 percent of GW grants went to students who demonstrated financial need last academic year, a study this month by the New America Foundation revealed that low-income students often aren’t the largest benefactors. GW was listed as part of a group of private colleges with low percentages of Federal Pell Grant recipients – who are appropriated funds based on need – and high net prices for low-income students.
While students whose families earn between $30,000 and $48,000 owed a net price of $13,879 after scholarships and grants, that cost rose to $14,670 for students whose parents’ income fell below $30,000.
The University’s operating budget, approved Friday, shows that GW will use some of the cost savings from a smaller aid pool to fund increases in salaries, benefits, travel and communications.

The Hatchet incorrectly reported that returning students would see a lower discount rate. The undergraduate population will have a lower discount rate than the year prior, but the decrease is due to a graduating class that was more highly discounted the previous ones.

The University is firmly entrenched in an era of growth. Increasingly, new faculty members teach in state-of-the-art facilities, and cranes and workers in hardhats seem to occupy a plot of land every few blocks.
But this expansion has also included growth in the size of the administration and number of University staffers, which could hurt, not help, students’ educational experiences.
Across higher education, ballooning bureaucracies have helped accelerate tuition faster than healthcare costs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
At GW, deans’ offices and Rice Hall have reorganized and hired high-paid administrators. And these University leaders earn, on average, almost twice as much as their peers at other institutions, The Hatchet found two years ago.
But administrators do not have a full grasp on just how much their offices have grown over time, and whether it’s been worth the cost.
That’s why it is reassuring that the provost’s office will conduct a review of the bureaucracy, administrators announced this month.
The University should allocate its dollars toward improving the educational experience for students, especially as more of them take on debt to finance their four years. And hiring too many unnecessary administrators takes money away from students and challenges their well-being.
The University has taken many encouraging steps toward this goal already. Most notably, the Innovation Task Force, a group formed five years ago that aims to make GW’s operations more financially responsible, has already saved more funds for academic and research ventures than initially expected. But their work isn’t over, and continued consolidation of high-level offices is needed.
We already see this move to combine administrators’ responsibilities in several recent University decisions.
For example, the University took advantage of its incumbent administration and gave the position of vice president for China operations to GW School of Business Dean Doug Guthrie, instead of hiring a new administrator to fill the role. This was likely a more financially responsible decision, because the University avoided hiring another administrator who would require a six-figure salary.
And instead of bringing in a new admissions dean to replace Kathryn Napper – who resigned in December – the University hired an administrator to oversee numerous departments, including admissions, financial aid and the registrar.
Decisions like these – where the administration maximizes resources at a minimum cost – help the University move in a productive and efficient direction. But we must see more.
If these efforts are continued, it will help combat the stigma of excessive bureaucracy at GW.
Students are often overwhelmed by the red tape they must wade through to achieve any significant progress in common tasks like declaring a major and applying for financial aid. Too many people work in too many offices, and students often rightfully complain.
Students shouldn’t feel distanced from the administration through time-consuming bureaucratic redundancies and paperwork.
Whether or not streamlining the administration will improve these problems has yet to be determined. Regardless, the review – if it produces fruitful results – has the potential to at least alter this damaging campus perception.

Nelson Carbonell was unanimously approved as the new chairman of the Board of Trustees.  He has helped shape the University over the past 11 years, including being a part of the process that selected currently University president Steven Knapp.
Ten years ago, Nelson Carbonell’s software engineering company flamed out — a casualty of business risks and the dot-com bust.
Since then, the 49-year-old’s business career has rebounded, and now he will bring his penchant for risk-taking to his new position as the head of GW’s highest governing body.
Carbonell, who was unanimously approved as Board of Trustees chairman Friday, will take the helm as a slow-moving University tries to develop its own entrepreneurial streak amid collisions of digital offerings and global competition. He begins his tenure July 1, replacing former chairman Russ Ramsey.
Colleagues and administrators say Carbonell, a 1985 School of Engineering and Applied Science alumnus, will help the University capitalize on the $275 million engineering building he envisioned, and steward GW’s dip into digital course offerings.
“People are willing to sign on with Nelson, knowing it’s not going to be a smooth ride, knowing his ambitions for us are so great, and his sense of urgency is so intense,” trustee Diana Henriques said. “We know he’s going to be pushing and shoving and pulling and grinding us along, maybe faster than some of us feel comfortable prodding along.”
The Board, comprised of 36 wealthy alumni, donors and business leaders, has typically served as more of a rubber stamp for administrators’ decisions. But that perception may be changing, particularly as Carbonell takes over.
The group played a central role in shaping the strategic plan it approved Friday, debating the merits of a one-college admissions model at summer strategy sessions and forging a compromise now detailed in the plan.
Boards across higher education are also under pressure because of recent scandals at the University of Virginia and Penn State University, which put trustees in the spotlight.
University President Steven Knapp said Friday he leans on board chairmen when weighing key decisions, and took weekly phone calls with Ramsey. Knapp added that Carbonell has said he wants more face-to-face meetings with the University president.
Carbonell attended the engineering school on a full ride and has since given back, matching the participation rate for the last two years’ senior class gifts — totaling $101,000. He and his wife also started a scholarship fund four years ago, with the first student on the scholarship graduating Sunday.
On the Board, Carbonell said he will encourage a start-up culture, which he added “feels more like a cause than a company.”
“I think I’m good at getting people to do things they wouldn’t normally do, like getting people enlisted in a cause,” said Carbonell, CEO of Reston, Va.-based Snowbird Capital. “It’s a different leadership style. I’m not a top-down leadership person. I want to know what you think.”
During his 11 years on the Board, Carbonell has served as the point man during the University’s most challenging times. Most recently, he led a committee in November that handled the University’s response to the discovery of decade-long admissions data inflation.
He also spearheaded a series of town halls in 2007 to gauge student and faculty needs – input he used to help poach Knapp away from Johns Hopkins University.
Former University President Stephen Joel Trachtenberg, who described Ramsey and Carbonell as a “Batman and Robin” duo, said the pair hand-picked Knapp with a clear vision of a future more reliant on GW’s strength in science and engineering.
“He really has been involved with framing and giving structure to those aspirations that developed during the last presidential search,” Knapp said.
Some, though, have resisted the direction in which Carbonell and top administrators have been steering the University.
Economics professor Donald Parsons noted Carbonell forced the idea of building a $275 million “engineering palace” on professors.
“He’s the one that came in to push it,” Parsons said, calling him a “very aggressive leader.”
Henriques, a trustee and New York Times staff reporter, said Carbonell is also looking to map out GW’s digital push, mirroring his mid-1990s advising of newspaper publishers to adapt their businesses for the web.
She said he’s been brainstorming ways to help GW bring higher education online, especially as universities scramble to adopt massive open online courses.
“I don’t know he’s right, but I know he’s thinking about it, and we need to be thinking about it. And under his leadership, we will be thinking about it,” Henriques said.
Still, Carbonell said he will strategically choose the transformations he leads during his tenure.
“I learned you have to be really patient with GW. Things don’t change like business. They don’t turn on a dime. The place has been here for almost 200 years. You have to respect that right,” he said.

The eight-story residence hall will include more common spaces and while the University is still planning the building's new look, the 120-unit residence hall of single and double rooms could house a graduate academic community similar to living learning communities for undergraduates.
The much-maligned residence hall for graduate students, the Hall on Virginia Avenue, will likely be demolished and get a nearly $35 million makeover starting next summer.
The Board of Trustees approved $2 million to plan the building’s new design Friday, paving the way for a more modern residence hall featuring collaborative work space, aimed at drawing top graduate students.
Construction crews will break ground next summer on the historic building that served as a hideout for one of the convicted conspirators in the Watergate scandal. It is expected to be finished by 2016, pending approval from District agencies and another funding green light from the Board of Trustees next year.
The University will dip into its $1.4 billion debt pool to fund the upgrades, details on which are scant, as the designs will just get underway this year.
Executive Vice President and Treasurer Lou Katz said he expects the University to pay off the construction through housing charges. The last batch of residents before the building’s demolition will pay $12,250 next academic year.
In 2011, students circulated a petition calling on administrators to address what they called “poor living conditions.”  Residents reported that maintenance crews were slow or unresponsive in addressing issues, ranging from yellow water to rodents in the now-48-year-old building, located at 2601 Virginia Ave.
The renovations will look to appeal to the rising caliber of graduate students that GW is looking to attract, University President Steven Knapp said.
“Traditionally, universities as a whole tend to focus on undergraduate students’ life and experience, and have tended to think of graduate students as belonging to their individual departments and schools,” Knapp said. “That will still be the case, but we can do more to build more of a sense of community.”
Graduate student issues came to a head this year as the University’s student life office failed to find a successful way to support the widely varied group of roughly 10,000 students. The Student Association took up the issue after months of what they called stalled efforts to increase spaces for graduate students and strengthen a sense of community for commuter and part-time students.
The eight-story residence hall will include more common spaces and, while the University is still planning the building’s new look, the 120-unit residence hall of single and double rooms could house a graduate academic community, Katz said, similar to living and learning communities for undergraduates.
“Right now, we’re talking about building the building, and then as it gets closer, they’ll talk about what group of grad students — maybe it’ll be for just two of the schools, or maybe it’ll be for all of the schools,” he said.
The University’s only other graduate resident hall is The Aston, which is available for first-year law students. GW also owns Columbia Plaza apartments, which typically house graduate students.
The University will also spend the year “assessing potential demand for a faculty housing program,” Senior Associate Vice President for Operations Alicia Knight said.
To house students in the building for another year, the Hall will see its carpets repaired or replaced and new light fixtures installed.

University Steven Knapp and outgoing Board of Trustees Chairman Russell Ramsey spearheaded the decade-long strategic plan, which will begin its implementation phase next year. 
The Board of Trustees unanimously approved the nearly $400 million strategic plan Friday — a blueprint that the University will use to reshape its undergraduate structure starting next year.
The far-reaching plan, stretching the University’s priorities around the world and across research disciplines over the next decade, will strip away the burdensome process of transferring between GW’s colleges by next academic year.
Currently, students must apply to a different college through the admissions office, and are not always given the green light.
“I want to encourage students to take risks and be able to make changes. And I don’t want what you told an admissions officer when you were 17 in high school to be a barrier to you taking risks,” said Senior Vice Provost for Academic Affairs and Planning Forrest Maltzman.
That will be one piece of the new admissions model outlined in the plan, which calls for high school students to apply to to the University as a whole rather than to specific colleges and will likely be implemented within two years. The move drew criticism from some colleges — like the Elliott School of International Affairs — last fall for potentially weakening their brands and chipping away at the influence of GW’s individual schools.
These changes are also part of an administrative push for students and faculty to dip into different academic disciplines and link together more curricula.
The plan calls for $30 million worth of new interdisciplinary research centers, like those underway that will combine statistical analysis of big data with fields like genomics and engineering.  The University will also put aside $50 million to $100 million for new faculty who study in multiple fields.
Faculty leaders and administrators will also begin to create a core curriculum next year, implementing new GW-wide classes similar to the University Writing model. Lerman said top administrators in his office and on the Faculty Senate educational policy committee will discuss the changes next year.
“We can do this without having a different core curriculum, but I think it would miss a real opportunity to have a conversation with the faculty as a whole about what every GW student should learn and every GW student should know how to do, independent of school,” Lerman said Friday after the plan was approved.
To lead students through these changes, the University will train academic advisers to guide students through interdisciplinary courses.
Maltzman said he hopes administrators will re-engineer DegreeMAP, an online tool where students can track their progress toward graduation requirements, to be more conducive to students taking courses in different schools.
Lerman and Faculty Senate executive committee chair Scheherazade Rehman will work with groups of administrators, faculty and students next year to help implement the rest of the plan. GW’s different colleges will also create their own strategic plans as they adjust their agendas to fit the University’s goals.
The plan includes a wide range of other initiatives to take shape over the next 10 years, like doubling the number of international students, improving performing arts venues and loosening GW’s ban on classified research.
Overall, the strategic plan could cost up to $400 million for the University. Mike Morsberger, vice president for development and alumni relations, said he has begun planning small dinners for the fall with alumni, parents and grateful patients of GW Hospital who are likely to contribute larger donations.
In 2014 or 2015, the University will roll out a comprehensive fundraising campaign, which will, in part, finance the strategic plan, though administrators have not established a fundraising goal.
The University will also turn to the Innovation Task Force, a group formed by Knapp in 2009 to mark $60 million per year in savings and new revenue for the University. About $5.2 million will come from the ITF annually for the 10-year plan.

The site of the future GW Museum, near University Yard.
Correction appended
The GW Museum opening next fall adjacent to University Yard will expand its size and cost by 50 percent to house additional exhibits and maximize space on the site.
Administrators said they opted to have the museum fill the entire construction site, putting more money into the project that was originally slated to cost $22 million. The project is funded by donations and by accumulating debt.
Executive Vice President and Treasurer Lou Katz said administrators expanded the project in part because the University must receive approval for 70 percent of the square footage in its massive 2007 Campus Plan by 2027, or it must resubmit its building plans to the city.
“The value of density rights is significant because of where we’re located, so to the extent possible, you do want to maximize what you are building on any of the sites,” Katz said earlier this month at a Faculty Senate meeting.
The University has fundraised about $11 million thus far for the project, with almost all of it coming from the Textile Museum and donor Albert Small’s Washingtonia collection. Katz said the University could expect some additional fundraising, but that most of the remaining cost will be covered by debt.
Construction on the 46,000-square-foot building, on track to open in the fall of 2014, has already displaced classes in the building, which currently houses the chemistry and physics departments and several labs.
The building’s construction shifted closer to Corcoran Hall after a mandate from the city’s historic preservation society demanded that it not overshadow the historic Woodhull House next door, associate dean for special projects of the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences Chris Sterling said.
The GW Museum will hold collections from the Textile Museum, including 18,000 textiles and a 20,000 volume research library along with Small’s collection. It will also house other galleries and space for educational programming. John Wetenhall was named the museum director earlier this year, and will start his tenure next month.
The Textile Museum will move into the Woodhull House, which forced the University Police Department to relocate to Rome Hall last year.
Last year’s budget alotted $8.2 million for the museum, while this year’s budget set aside $20 million for the museum and conservation buildings on the Virginia Science and Technology Campus.
The museums have been scorned this year, serving as a punchline in Hugo Scheckter’s Student Association presidential bid to become the “King of GW”. He vowed to add four more museums to campus, mocking administrators for what he called putting business above academics.
But Vice President for Development and Alumni Relations Mike Morsberger said the ventures have heightened the University’s prestige and added research opportunities at a minimal cost to GW, although he stressed the University’s selectivity when it comes to choosing collections to house on campus.
“We don’t want to become the nation’s attic. You can’t accept every collection in the world,” Morsberger said earlier this year.
Former SA President Ashwin Narla criticized the museum in April, saying the space in the Woodhull House could have been used for student space. He said students should have been involved in discussions about what to do with the the open space, even though the museum development aligned with University President Steven Knapp’s goals to showcase the arts and humanities on campus.
“If you don’t have any students in that room, it’s going to be thrown into a different cause or priority,” Narla said.

The Hatchet incorrectly reported that the Winston Churchill Archives would move to the GW Museum. In fact, it will still be housed in Gelman Library. We regret this error.

Food trucks have become a common fixture at GW over the last few years. Each day, nearly a dozen of these vendors serve up diverse cultural cuisines and build social connections on the Foggy Bottom campus.
But food trucks are under attack from the D.C. government.
The regulations under consideration would limit “food truck row” – on H Street, between 21st and 22nd streets – to a mere three trucks. This arbitrary limit would severely stifle students’ choices and take away from the University’s urban atmosphere – an unacceptable result for consumers.
These rules would not only cap the number of trucks that operate on campus, but would set up a monthly lottery system to determine which trucks can sit in those spots. If the same three trucks are there for a month before they are reassigned elsewhere, you can forget about variety.
Food trucks have become a part of the University’s fabric — and not just because they can quickly and easily satisfy a kabob craving. They have shared profits during Greek philanthropy and worked with a marketing class to better understand business models. The D.C. government’s decision to limit their numbers would signal the demise of an important part of our university.
Over the past year, the Student Association has worked with University administrators to place food trucks on the Colonial Cash system, increasing demand for food truck services.
But this becomes a moot point if the proposed food truck regulations become law. Many food trucks will be driven out of business for good.
Students are often underrepresented within the D.C. government, but on this important issue, the GW community asks that the City Council and Mayor Vincent Gray not pass this bill in its current form.
We hope that when students come back to campus this fall, they can still find their favorite food truck on H Street.
