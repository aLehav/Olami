Commissioners said the traffic signal's lights at the intersection were not visible at the time of the collision but appeared to be functioning shortly after, placing the city's operation of the signals in question.
After a fatal traffic collision in Foggy Bottom Wednesday, a local governing body demanded that the District Department of Transportation answer to its potential cause hours later Wednesday night.
The Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission voted unanimously to pass a resolution urging city officials to explain potential traffic signal issues at the intersection of 21st and I streets during the time of the traffic death Wednesday. A Mack truck driver struck and killed 40-year-old cyclist Shawn O’Donnell, who was riding alongside the truck as it turned onto I Street outside of Lafayette Hall.
Officials also voted in support of a resolution requesting DDOT to revamp safety measures on Virginia Avenue and backed a bill that expands the right to vote in local elections to permanent residents who are not yet citizens.
Here are a few of the meeting’s highlights:
Investigating the cyclist death near campus
Commissioner Yannik Omictin introduced the resolution that the ANC passed, pressing DDOT Director Everett Lott to explain the factors that contributed to the collision that took place at the intersection of 21st and I Streets Wednesday.
Before the ANC could hear the resolution, the commissioners took part in a 30-second moment of silence in honor of the victim, which a constituent attending the meeting proposed.
Commissioners said the traffic signal’s lights at the intersection were not visible at the time of the collision but appeared to be functioning shortly after, placing the city’s operation of the signals in question. The resolution calls on DDOT to explain the status of its installation and activation of the intersection’s traffic signal, which can prevent road collisions like Wednesday’s fatal accident.
Omictin said commissioners are “sick and tired” of their constituents dying in potentially-avoidable traffic accidents and called for a special meeting to discuss the subject August 8. Commissioner Trupti Patel proposed a walkthrough of the intersection with other commissioners next week to identify potential causes for the accident.
“This is really hard, so I definitely want to make sure we proceed very thoughtfully and carefully,” Patel said during the meeting. “I do think we need to be as aggressive as possible in making sure we get all the answers on this.”
Tightening safety measures on Virginia Avenue 
The ANC unanimously voted to request that DDOT addresses pedestrian and driver safety concerns along several intersections on Virginia Avenue during ongoing construction of a protected bike lane.
Commissioners asked for an expedited timeline for the completion of the project, which includes adding signals to the G Street intersection, and a DDOT analysis of the pedestrian conditions at the avenue’s intersections. The resolution also proposes lengthening crosswalk times at the New Hampshire Avenue, 25th and 27th Street intersections.
Commissioner Joel Causey, the ANC’s chair, said the protected bike lane project wasn’t “fully thought-out” in a way that could accommodate differently-abled pedestrians because of the city’s rush to complete the protected bike lane. He cited the lack of “refuge islands,” which create space for a pedestrian stopgap in the middle of a wide intersection, as part of the city’s failure to fully furnish the avenue with appropriate protections for locals like elderly residents.
“I believe that in a rush to get the bike lanes in and claim victory for bike lanes, they failed to understand that we have constituents who are elderly,” Causey said.
Expanding voting rights to non-citizen residents
Commissioners unanimously passed a resolution backing a bill that Ward 1 D.C. Council member Brianne Nadeau proposed last June to allow non-citizen permanent D.C. residents to vote in local elections.
The resolution amends D.C.’s Election Code of 1955 to include permanent residents in the definition of the term “qualified elector” for mayoral, D.C. Council, State Board of Education, ANC and attorney general elections. Council member Brooke Pinto of Ward 2, which encompasses Foggy Bottom, co-introduced the bill along with five other Council members last year, but it has made little progress because of issues creating an additional registry for non-citizen voters.
Commissioner Trupti Patel said the bill was necessary in the District because of the city’s high population of immigrants. She said the D.C. Council bill has continually gained traction after Mayor Muriel Bowser first proposed it when she was a Ward 4 Council member.
“Basically what this resolution is stating for the record is that one out of every seven D.C. residents is an immigrant, one in nine has a parent that is an immigrant,” Patel said.
Pre-registering for Monkeypox vaccines
A spokesperson for Bowser said about 7,600 individuals have pre-registered to receive the Monkeypox vaccine, and the city has offered 2,500 appointments since last week’s preregistration launch.
Pablo Velasquez Rodriguez, a representative for Pinto’s office, said while individuals who aren’t currently eligible to receive the vaccine may still pre-register, the District is currently prioritizing the vaccinations of those most at risk – individuals over the age of 18 in the LGBTQ community – while actively requesting more vaccines from the federal government.

Two D.C. buildings – GW’s Staughton Hall and RFK Stadium – are surprisingly similar. Sure, one is a 1912 apartment building and the other a massive sports complex, but they’re both abandoned, steps away from the Metro and occupy prime real estate. In as many words, they’re practically crying out for redevelopment, so much so that crews demolished Staughton Hall in May and will do the same to RFK Stadium by the end of 2023.
While both GW and the District are well within their right to knock down old, albeit historic, buildings for new construction, Staughton Hall and RFK Stadium show where their strategies diverge. GW acted first and thought later – it used its broad leeway to demolish Staughton Hall without a clear plan for what comes next. But at RFK Stadium, the D.C. Council and Mayor Muriel Bowser won’t go forward until and unless they agree on the site’s future. So while city officials plan to redevelop the stadium’s grounds, even if they can’t agree yet, the University has been mum about what, if anything, will replace Staughton Hall. Without a clear vision for redevelopment, I’m worried that GW will keep turning vacant buildings into vacant lots.
With the city’s approval, GW has broad permission to transform its Foggy Bottom Campus as it sees fit. The University’s 2007 Foggy Bottom Campus Plan allows GW to develop about 3.5 million square feet of real estate, whether planting new trees or tearing down buildings like Staughton Hall. And in fairness, even naysayers like me can acknowledge that Staughton Hall’s demolition (or the similar razing of the former Nashman Center for Civic Engagement and Public Service building last October) was long overdue. Petite Victorian row houses and brick apartment buildings look nice, but ultimately form doesn’t beat function – their age, and the presence of equally outdated materials like asbestos, made them largely inaccessible.
But officials demolished Staughton without an immediate plan for its future development. A University spokesperson told The Hatchet as much in an email in January, saying “While a timeline has not been developed for a new building,” the vacant Staughton Hall is “well suited for additional green space until the redevelopment occurs.”
To return to the campus plan, GW must build or receive approval to construct at least 70 percent of that 3.5 million square feet to retain the rights to continue developing its land. I doubt the University will simply sacrifice its development rights – it’s going to build something. But that’s a far cry from knowing what said building will look like, or when they’ll build it. You can see what might replace Staughton Hall looming in the background of this render of a reimagined Kogan Plaza revealed at a Faculty Senate meeting last year. And documents submitted with the 2007 campus plan list other nearby buildings, like Gelman Library, the GW EMeRG building and the small park area next to GW Deli, as areas for future redevelopment – though they don’t specify what officials have in mind.
So without plans for immediate or otherwise rapid development, GW has turned a vacant but arguably still usable building into “green space.” But a strip of grass, some trees and a bench or two don’t exactly fit in with the University’s mantra of “Grow Up, Not Out.” Officials say they want to increase density on the University’s current property rather than sprawl out into the rest of Foggy Bottom and the West End, which local residents have historically resisted. But these mini parks are missed opportunities – even old, vacant structures can find a new purpose and house more people, offices and classrooms than a grassy lot. If there’s no timeline to replace Staughton Hall, then what was the rush to tear it down?
RFK Stadium is the reverse of Staughton Hall – the D.C. Council and Mayor Bowser know just how they want to redevelop the sprawling site, though they don’t exactly agree. While replacing asphalt parking lots and a run-down stadium with homes, businesses, public parks and recreational facilities is a no-brainer, Bowser and the Council have gone back-and-forth over whether the new site should include a new professional football stadium. The federal government, which owns the land the stadium complex sits on, won’t sell or transfer it to D.C. until both sides come to a consensus. And of course, there’s also the fire that broke out in the stadium earlier this month.
As dysfunctional as the city’s plans for RFK Stadium may seem, they have a plan, and an ambitious one at that. Compare that to GW’s new “green spaces,” which allow it to cop out of new construction and vaguely gesture to a timeline in the distant future.
I want the University to literally put its money where its mouth is – if Staughton Hall had to come down, then invest in a building to replace it. I’m ready to support new development, but seeing is believing. I hope officials will prove me wrong if, or when, they break ground on Staughton Hall’s successor – hopefully, a large, beautiful building that represents the progress GW has made since its predecessor was erected in 1912. But until then, I’ll treat that “green space” less as a park, and more as a cemetery for something taken from us far too soon.

Along with its salad and hummus bowl options, Little Sesame offers three oat milk soft serve ice cream choices – vanilla tahini, chocolate Turkish coffee and a swirl with the two combined (each $4.95).
On the busy block of the Capital One Arena, a casual yet lively restaurant named Little Sesame is packed into a small storefront at the corner, with big bold cursive letters marking an enticing dining destination.
We found ourselves in Chinatown, but Little Sesame’s L Street location makes for an even shorter walk from campus for GW students looking for a quick bite in between classes. While it may be known for its trademark hummus sold at local grocery stores, Little Sesame – which specializes in fresh Mediterranean dishes with a vegan twist – also offers some refreshing vegan ice cream that the restaurant’s founders created to help more people enjoy an environmentally-friendly lifestyle.
The restaurant sports a simplistic style furnished with booths, round tables and wooden chairs that are complemented by plants over a tiled floor.
Along with its salad and hummus bowl options, Little Sesame offers three oat milk soft serve ice cream choices – vanilla tahini, chocolate Turkish coffee and a swirl with the two combined (each $4.95). For some extra flair, you can add one of three toppings for one dollar – cocoa nibs, or broken cocoa beans; halva, a Middle Eastern confectionery; or Soomsoom crumble, a sesame cookie crumbled into small pieces.
The three of us chose to divide the ice cream flavors one by one. Isha decided to try the tahini vanilla and chocolate Turkish coffee swirl, and Nuria went for the chocolate Turkish coffee, leaving Zach with the vanilla tahini.
Vanilla tahini
If you’re looking for a tasty, dairy-free alternative to vanilla bean ice cream, Little Sesame’s Vanilla Tahini oat soft serve delivers the goods. The ice cream comes served on the top of a small cup, a perfectly creamy afternoon snack on a hot day.
I ordered my vanilla cream with the cocoa nibs, which gave the dish a crunchy, contrasting sweetness compared to the vanilla.
The tahini, a sesame paste with a distinct nutty flavor that’s usually added to hummus, didn’t overpower the vanilla. Texture-wise, the oat milk made the ice cream about as creamy as normal ice cream.
While the taste of the oat milk soft serve doesn’t quite stack up to its dairy adversaries, the vanilla tahini ice cream is still a great option for any hot D.C. afternoon.
Chocolate Turkish coffee 
Served as a creamy chocolatey swirl, my first bite refreshed the palate after a hot afternoon in the DMV. The dessert filled up its plastic container with just the right amount, about the size of a single scoop of ice cream that leaves you full with a fair price.
The chocolate flavor overpowers the bitter taste of Turkish coffee due to its unfiltered coffee beans – a disappointing loss to the mix. Compared to other DMV ice cream options, this flavor falls short of encapsulating the extravagance it promises. Instead of creating a new fresh original flavor, it emulates a typical ice cream serving that you could expect from a soft serve machine.
But there is nothing wrong with classic soft serve. The consistency is so cooling that you will not be able to stop taking bites until the ice cream is gone due to the richness of the oat milk.
Tahini vanilla and chocolate Turkish coffee swirl
If you’re struggling to pick between the two, the swirl with both flavors is the way to go. The light sweetness of the Tahini vanilla cuts the somewhat bitter flavor from the chocolate Turkish coffee, serving as an extra refreshing reprieve from the hot D.C. weather.
Both flavors weren’t overwhelmingly sweet, and the two paired well in the cup. I didn’t opt for a topping, but any of the options would have made for a pleasant textural contrast with the soft ice cream.
The swirl is also a great option if you want something more exciting than just plain vanilla but are hoping to avoid a potential caffeine boost late in the day. And even with both flavors combined, this plant-based treat tastes close enough to the real thing!

While recent changes to GW’s Foggy Bottom Campus are no doubt improvements, this week’s headlines are a reminder that progress isn’t so simple. The newly-opened Tatte Bakery and Cafe is a welcome addition to the community’s dining scene, and high-tech upgrades to the University’s parking garages should make them and their users safer and more secure.
But a fatal collision between a truck and bicycle on I Street – just steps from Tatte’s shiny new front door – means that Foggy Bottom’s streets are still as dangerous as ever. Meanwhile, the hospitalization of three construction workers at Thurston Hall makes for an inauspicious end to the residence hall’s ongoing renovations.
Here’s the best and worst of this week’s headlines.
Thumbs Up:
Tatte’s Foggy Bottom location opened to the public last week, offering a bakery, all-day brunch menu and coffee bar to the University community and locals alike. Tatte’s scrumptious, albeit somewhat pricey, selection of comfort and Mediterranean-inspired cuisine is worth trying, especially given its location just across the street from District House, where GW scrubbed its plans for an all-you-can-eat dining system last month. And with Tatte planning to accept GWorld, I can see the establishment becoming something of a more laidback community anchor on the otherwise busy I Street corridor.
While Tatte may sate your appetite, new security measures at GW’s parking garages should hopefully put your mind at ease. A new scanning system, high-speed doors and light detection and ranging cameras are meant to allow students, staff, faculty, contractors and non-University-affiliated drivers to park their vehicles while keeping unauthorized pedestrians out. After a man assaulted a GW staff member in the G Street Garage last year, the University is addressing its vulnerabilities – better late than never.
Thumbs Down: 
The driver of a Mack truck struck and killed 40-year-old bicyclist Shawn O’Donnell at the intersection of I and 21st streets Wednesday morning. The collision comes less than a week after a dump truck driver fatally struck 65-year-old bicyclist Michael Gordon at 7th Street NW and Rhode Island Avenue NW. O’Donnell’s and Gordon’s tragic deaths add to the hundreds of traffic fatalities and injuries that have occurred across the District this year. My sincerest condolences to their friends and family.
What’s so infuriating about these collisions is that we know how to stop them – don’t mix automotive and non-automotive traffic. This crash and others like it stemmed from institutional failures as much as the driver’s decision making. Photo and video taken from the scene show traffic lights at the intersection covered in what appears to be a fabric-like material, making them seem out of use. Coincidentally, local officials greenlit Tatte’s new location – adjacent to the site of Wednesday’s tragedy – and called on the D.C. Council to pass an act improving pedestrian and bike crossings at the same Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission meeting in February. After its only public hearing in March, it seems the act – the Walk Without Worry Amendment Act of 2021 – is still under review. At that same February meeting, ANC members identified dangerous street locations that could benefit from raised crosswalks, which would reduce the speed of traffic and make crossing the street easier. And you better believe I and 21st made the list.
Also on Wednesday morning, D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services rescued three construction workers at Thurston Hall. The workers lost consciousness after inhaling concrete sealant in a confined space, and all three were transported to local hospitals with serious but non-life threatening injuries where they’ll hopefully make a quick recovery. While it’s currently unclear whether the University bears any legal responsibility for what happened, working in a confined space is no joke. Fortunately, the future residents of Thurston Hall will likely be fine since this accident was construction related, but it’s worth remembering that buildings don’t spring up from the ground fully-formed – it takes people to get a job done, but it shouldn’t take their lives.

Roderick “Rod” French, the former vice president of academic affairs and philosophy professor, died last month after 28 years at GW. He was 93. 
French came to the University as a Ph.D. student in 1968, receiving his doctorate in American civilization, according to a University release. Shortly after, officials appointed him as the associate director of GW’s division of experimental programs in 1969 and then he became director of the division by 1979. 
In 1984, French was named vice president of academic affairs, a position he held for the next 11 years until stepping down in 1997 to serve as the first chancellor of the American University of Sharjah in the United Emirates, where he worked until 2002. The release states that he then served as professor emeritus and a member of the American University of Sharjah’s board of trustees. 
After stepping down from his position in the administration, French worked with the University Honors Program and was a faculty advisor for a GW undergraduate research journal.
“Rod French lived and worked as a true GW scholar, driven by the purpose of making the world a better place through scholarship and service,” Provost Chris Bracey said in the release. “He had a profound impact on GW and beyond, and we are extremely grateful for the nearly 30 years he devoted to this university.”
In addition to his service within the GW community, French was involved with organizations like the D.C. Council of Humanities and the National Endowment for the Humanities, the release states. 
In 2011 and 2014, French donated collections of his personal papers dating from 1969 to 2013 to GW, including notes, press releases, speeches, correspondence and publications regarding French’s work for GW and other organizations. 
Early in his career, French also served as the executive director of the World Council of Churches in Geneva youth department and later as the special assistant to the director of the office of public affairs of the Peace Corps.
French is survived by his wife Sally and his two children, Eric and Sarah. 
There will be a memorial service on Sunday, Aug. 14 at 2 p.m. at Maplewood Park Place in Bethesda, Maryland. The service will also be accessible online.

The release states that the initiative will pressure officials to develop an "action plan" for addressing gun violence in the United States. 
Updated: July 22, 2022 at 2:29 p.m.
GW will join other D.C. schools in a national initiative dedicated to fighting gun violence, according to a University release Wednesday.
The Consortium of Universities of the Washington Metropolitan Area, which is comprised of 20 colleges and universities in the D.C. area and is spearing the effort, said they created the 120 Initiative last week in response to recent mass shootings in Buffalo, N.Y., Highland Park, Ill and Uvalde, Texas. The release states that the initiative will try to pressure officials to develop an “action plan” for addressing gun violence in the United States.
Interim University President Mark Wrighton, who will personally join the initiative along with his wife Risa Zwerling Wrighton, said in the release that GW has the capacity to come together and provide research on how best to address the gun violence epidemic.
“The George Washington University and our Consortium partners across the region have a unique ability to convene and bring to bear the research and expertise to address the most pressing challenges of our times,” Wrighton said in the release. “Our university must help contribute solutions to overcome this major public health crisis.”
Adnan Hyder, a professor of global health at the Milken Institute School of Public Health and the director of the Center on Commercial Determinants of Health at Milken, said in the release he joined the initiative to create “global dialogue” on the issue of American gun violence.
“When the federal government appears not to work, then you try to do what you can at the local level,” Hyder said in the release.
Other Milken faculty to join the initiative include Amita Vyas, an associate professor and director of the Maternal and Child Health Program, Naomi Seller, an associate professor of health policy and management, Mark Edberg, a professor of prevention and community health, Jack Sandberg, an associate professor of global health, Katie Horton, a research professor of health policy and management and Nino Paichadze, an assistant research professor of global health.
This post was updated to correct the following:
The Hatchet incorrectly spelled Risa Zwerling Wrighton’s name. We regret this error.

Shawn O'Donnell was rushed to an area hospital but died after the collision, according to Metropolitan Police Department officials.
A cyclist died Wednesday morning after a Mack truck struck her at the intersection of 21st and I streets.
Metropolitan Police Department officials said in a release that the truck driver struck 40-year-old Shawn O’Donnell when the driver tried turning onto I Street from 21st Street while she was cycling alongside the truck. Officials said O’Donnell, who appears to have a LinkedIn account that showed she was a State Department official, was transported to a local hospital where she was pronounced dead after all life-saving efforts failed.
The release did not name the truck’s driver or say whether the driver may face charges or receive a ticket for the incident. Photos posted on Twitter showed the mangled bike underneath the truck as police investigated the collision.
Street lights had been installed in recent weeks but had not been operational. Chalk drawings on the street Wednesday night marked the spots where the truck’s wheels had come to a stop following the collision.
Vito Maggiolo, the D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services’ public information officer, said first responders received a call at 8:11 a.m. about a person struck by a vehicle before arriving on scene and transporting O’Donnell from the scene.

D.C. joined the nationwide initiative, 988 Suicide and Crisis Hotline, which replaced the previous 10-digit suicide hotline to 988 on Saturday.
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said in a press release anyone experiencing a mental health, substance abuse or suicidal crisis can call the 988 number and be connected to a local crisis center. The shorter number, which resembles the 911 emergency number, is designed to be more memorable and offer easy access to a trained professional to people experiencing suicidal ideation or any other mental health crisis.
“We are very focused on how we connect more residents to mental health care, and that is especially critical for people who are in crisis. Just like people know 911, now we also want people to know and use the 988 lifeline,” Bowser said. “In calling 988, people can get connected to trained crisis counselors and lifesaving services – any time, day or night.”
The previous National Suicide Prevention Lifeline number – 1-800-273-TALK (8255) – will still work if dialed, but will direct callers to the 988 line. The new three-digit number will also feature a 24/7 live chat function.
The D.C. department of behavioral health will continue to operate the district’s 24-hour mental health hotline at 1-888-793-4357 for those who want to talk to a professional about their mental health before it reaches a crisis, the release states.
Bowser said the new hotline will contribute to the initiative to decrease law-enforcement response to mental health crises and instead field calls to mental health specialists.
Bowser included a $5.1 million investment to the 2022 fiscal budget to add 14 staff members to D.C.’s mental health hotline and 27 new members to the community response team which provides a clinical response to mental health crises before an automatic law-enforcement response.
The release states that the department of health is adding 14 new staffers to the local call center to prepare for a potential increase in calls because of the number change. The city currently reports a 91% call-answer rate.

Officials named a new dean for the College of Professional studies after almost two years without a permanent dean, according to a University release published Wednesday.
Updated: July 22, 2022 at 2:25 p.m.
Officials named a new dean for the College of Professional studies after almost two years without a permanent dean, according to a University release published Wednesday.
Liesl Riddle, currently a vice dean for strategy at the School of Business, will take over as the head of CPS at the beginning of August. Melissa Feuer, the interim dean of CPS, has held the mantle of the school’s top spot since August 2020 when Christopher Deering, the former interim dean, left the position after almost three years in the role.
“The opportunity to lead our GW school that is at the forefront of interdisciplinary innovation is an honor that I am thrilled to accept,” Riddle said in the release. “The portfolio of applied programs across our College of Professional Studies benefits lifelong learners in ways that advance business, government and society. I look forward to collaborating with colleagues within the school to build additional bridges across the university and with external partners to develop programs that enhance students’ professional careers.”
Riddle has worked in the School of Business for more than 20 years, starting as an assistant professor in 2001, and gradually working up into the school’s administration, including as associate dean of graduate programs in 2018, the release states. She only took over as vice dean of strategy last year, where she oversees the Business school’s 14 research programs.
“Liesl Riddle is a strategic thinker, an experienced collaborator across schools and has demonstrated a commitment to enhancing diversity, equity and inclusion in the student body and faculty,” Hugh Agnew, professor of history and international affairs and chair of the search committee said in the release. “We are excited to see where she will take CPS in the coming years.”
Officials announced in the spring that they had hoped to fill both CPS and the School of Nursing’s interim dean positions will full-time candidates by the fall. Riddle’s appointment to the permanent dean role checks one of the two boxes officials said they would fill.
“Dr. Riddle has many years of experience and a proven track record of leadership at GW,”  Provost Chris Bracey said. “In her 20 years with the School of Business, she has been a visionary leader who has worked to design and implement a strategic plan, established and expanded D.C. partnerships, increased graduate rankings, boosted enrollment and maintained retention and diversity within the student body. Dr. Riddle will be a tremendous asset to the students, faculty and staff in the College of Professional Studies and lead it into an exciting future.”
