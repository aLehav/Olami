Commissioner Trupti Patel, the lone vote against the bakery’s application, aired concerns about how Tatte's West End location handled COVID-19 safety restrictions during the earlier stages of the pandemic.
A local governing body approved a request from Tatte Bakery and Cafe to open a new location in Foggy Bottom.
The Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission accepted Tatte’s public space application, in a 7-1 vote, to construct a cafe on I Street across from the District House entrance. The ANC also elected Joel Causey as its new chair and Adam Friend as its vice chair during its virtual meeting Wednesday.
Here are a few of the meeting’s highlights:
Tatte expands to Foggy Bottom
The ANC voted to support Tatte’s application to open a new bakery at 2129 I St. with tentative plans to open in June. Brendan Boyle, a representative from Tatte, said the bakery plans to accept GWorld when it arrives on campus this summer.
“We call our offerings ‘elegant comfort food’ and its Mediterranean-inspired fare,” Boyle said during the meeting. “We’re a scratch kitchen. We make everything that we serve on a plate, and we’re looking forward to coming into the neighborhood.”
The public space application requested permission to open a sidewalk cafe with 16 seats, six tables and three umbrellas.
Commissioner Trupti Patel, the lone vote against the bakery’s application, aired concerns about how Tatte’s West End location handled COVID-19 safety restrictions during the earlier stages of the pandemic.
“​​One of your locations, during the COVID-19 crisis, was not a good actor,” Patel said. “You did not adhere to the community guidelines, and I was really disappointed about that because I had the workers from Tatte reach out to me personally.”
Commissioner Jeri Epstein said members of Tatte’s upper management, based in Boston, were responsive to COVID-19-related protocol concerns and resolved the initial issues in about a week.
“You were right, and they came in immediately to correct it after you pointed it out,” Epstein said in response to Patel.
Commissioners elect chair, vice chair
Epstein announced she is stepping down as chair to spend more time with her mother and father-in-law after assuming the position atop the commission last January. Epstein said she will maintain her role as a commissioner.
Commissioners elected Causey, the ANC’s previous vice chair, to lead the commission with five votes in favor, two votes against and one abstention. Patel and Commissioner Margaret McDonald voted against his nomination, and Commissioner Yannik Omictin abstained.
The ANC also elected Commissioner Adam Friend to replace Causey as vice chair in a 4-3 vote that edged out Omictin. Causey abstained from the vote.
Friend said he hopes to improve relations between the ANC and the D.C. government, as well as among commissioners, as vice chair.
“That requires building consensus, which is not something that exists just by itself,” Friend said. “It’s something that has to be made, and efforts that we want to get done aren’t something that happen just because of willpower. They happen because of getting people on your side and aligned on the same issues.”
ANC pushes for infrastructure upgrades
The ANC also unanimously called on the D.C. Council to pass the Walk Without Worry Act, which would lead to the construction of raised crosswalks and raised intersections in high-traversed areas to protect pedestrians from collisions. Omictin, who introduced the resolution, said he identified about 50 locations in the Foggy Bottom and West End areas that could be eligible for improved infrastructure, like several spots of H Street on campus that may receive raised crosswalks.
“It essentially calls for proactive, safe infrastructure construction in areas that we know are already dangerous for pedestrians to walk,” he said.

The first event will take place on Wednesday, March 2 at 7 p.m. and will feature CNN journalists Brianna Keilar, John King, Abby Phillip and Manu Raju.
GW will host a series of in-person conversations between journalists and public figures in partnership with CNN this spring.
The series, titled CITIZEN by CNN, will feature discussion between the network’s journalists and “newsmakers” about political topics in the news, according to a CNN release. The series will take place in the Jack Morton Auditorium in the School of Media and Public Affairs and will allow in-person audience members to attend by invitation only, the release states.
The first event, focused on President Biden’s State of the Union address, will take place on Wednesday, March 2 at 7 p.m. and will include CNN journalists Brianna Keilar, John King, Abby Phillip and Manu Raju.
“As a partner to the Citizen by CNN series, our University is helping to inform the public, facilitating civil discourse on critical issues, and giving our students and other members of our community access to engage with the leaders who are shaping our country and the world today,” interim University President Mark Wrighton said in the release.
Attendees may register to watch the event virtually and submit questions for the speakers.
A “limited number” of seats for the in-person event were available for SMPA students, according to an email sent to SMPA students.
The CITIZEN by CNN series started in 2018 as a day-long conference in New York City featuring discussions and debate amongst leaders in fields like academia, media, business and technology and would recur one to two times a year in the following years.
Officials will announce the remainder of the dates for CITIZEN by CNN at a later date, according to the release.

During his time as interim provost, Bracey has spearheaded the University's internal diversity review.
Interim Provost Chris Bracey has been named to the role permanently, interim University President Mark Wrighton announced at a Faculty Senate meeting Friday afternoon.
Bracey had served in the role in an interim capacity since last summer when Brian Blake left GW. Wrighton said he has worked with Bracey, formerly the vice provost for faculty affairs and a professor of law, since last year, and he was named to the permanent position effective Feb. 1.
“I know that Chris is eager to begin his work in this official capacity, and he’s been very hard at work,” Wrighton said at the meeting.
The move comes as officials have been working to improve shared governance at GW through a series of town hall meetings and surveys. Bracey represents administrators on the shared governance task force’s steering committee.
Wrighton said officials named Bracey as permanent provost after consultation with members of the senate’s executive committee. Arthur Wilson, the executive committee chair, and other senators congratulated Bracey during Friday’s meeting.
Bracey has also been named an executive vice president in line with tradition for past provosts.
“It’s my privilege to have your confidence in leading the academic enterprise at the George Washington University,” Bracey told Wrighton at the meeting.
During his time as interim provost, Bracey has spearheaded the University’s internal diversity review. He also oversaw a reclassification of postdoctoral researchers from staff members to trainees in September, which he said at the time would improve the University’s research profile.
Bracey joined GW in 2008 as a GW Law faculty member, recently serving as interim dean for roughly a year. He has served as vice provost for faculty affairs since 2016.
“Leading the University’s academic enterprise is a significant test that I take very seriously,” Bracey said. “And I recognize that this requires a valued and committed partnership of the University’s administration, deans and faculty leaders, particularly the Faculty Senate.”

Officials who spoke at the ceremony said they hope the addition of the new facility will be the first step in addressing inadequate access to health care in eastern parts of the District.
Mayor Muriel Bowser kicked off construction of a long-awaited Southeast D.C. medical care facility staffed by GW’s medical enterprise at a ceremony held alongside top University officials Thursday.
Bowser announced the facility will be named Cedar Hill Regional Medical Center, a reference to the D.C. estate of abolitionist Frederick Douglass located a short drive away from the hospital in Anacostia. The facility, set to open in 2024 at St. Elizabeth’s East campus, will be operated by the GW Hospital’s majority owner, Universal Health Services, and is the first trauma center constructed east of the Anacostia River. 
“We are honoring an iconic Washingtonian, but we’re not just honoring one person,” Bowser said at the ceremony. “We are honoring all the people who have fought to preserve his legacy and tell his story. We are honoring the family and generations of women, Black women in particular, who persisted, persevered and eventually succeeded in preserving the Douglass family home.”

Former University President Thomas LeBlanc and interim University President Mark Wrighton both attended the ceremony.
D.C. Council members Vincent Gray of Ward 7 and Trayon White of Ward 8, interim University President Mark Wrighton and GW Hospital CEO Kimberly Russo, who represented UHS, all spoke at Thursday’s ceremony. Former University President Thomas LeBlanc, who led GW during the project’s negotiations, was also in attendance for the ground-breaking ceremony.
Health care disparities have long affected Southeast D.C. residents, who are majority Black, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Officials who spoke at the ceremony said they hope the addition of the new facility will be the first step in addressing inadequate access to health care in eastern parts of the District.
“I just want to thank you for being dedicated because there’s hundreds of thousands of people that’s going to benefit from this quality health care system right here in Ward 8,” White said.
The ceremony marks the culmination of years of debate surrounding the need for a hospital in Anacostia after Bowser announced plans for a new facility in 2018. Officials halted original negotiations after receiving backlash from Foggy Bottom community members and Howard University, which submitted a proposal with Sibley Memorial Hospital to operate the facility before GW was chosen, voicing frustration with its diminished role in the process.
“I am extremely proud that today we will break ground on the next premier hospital in the District of Columbia right here at St. Elizabeth’s,” Bowser said.
Bowser announced a new agreement in 2020 to build the St. Elizabeth’s facility in addition to a hospital run by Howard in Ward 1.
Russo, GW Hospital’s CEO and UHS’ group vice president for the D.C. region, said Southeast D.C. residents have received insufficient healthcare for “too long.”
“Far too long, residencies for the Anacostia River have had inadequate access to important health care services, resulting in health care inequity and lower health care outcomes,” Russo said. “This is simply unacceptable, and we must do better. And together, we will.”
Wrighton thanked LeBlanc, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Mark Diaz and Barbara Bass, the CEO of the Medical Faculty Associates and dean of the School of Medicine and Health Sciences, for their contributions to the project.
“We have a great team, and we have many outstanding members of our faculty,”  Wrighton said. “Those medical clinicians are going to make important contributions to the well being of our entire community.”
Bowser said she met Wrighton in person for the first time before the ceremony on Thursday. 
“I had the opportunity to meet with him virtually and in person today for the first time in person,” Bowser said. “He clearly understands GW’s huge role in the District, and I look forward to getting to know him and his vision for the University a little bit more.”

The Colonials have surpassed preseason expectations and are currently in eighth place in the Atlantic 10 with only three weeks remaining until the conference tournament.
Men’s basketball dominated Duquesne in Pittsburgh on Wednesday night to bounce back from their blowout loss to Dayton on Saturday.
The Colonials (10-14, 6-6 A-10) put in a wire to wire performance to win 73-52, closing out their three-game road trip where they went 2-1. The Dukes (6-18, 1-11 A-10) looked overmatched offensively, struggling from anywhere outside the paint, scoring 40 of their 52 points down low and shooting just 1-of-21 from three point range.
“They run stuff offensively that’s really hard to guard, so it was good that our guys were able to take it and really play fast tonight by understanding what they were trying to do,” Head Coach Jamion Christian said. “I think they went 1-21 from three tonight and that’s groundbreaking defense from the three point line.”
Duquesne jumped out to a 2-0 lead to open the game and it ended up being their only lead of the night. The Colonials went on a 13-4 run going into the first media timeout, leading by nine points on 4-of-4 shooting in the first six minutes from sophomore guard Joe Bamisile.
“He gives us such great spurtability,” Christian said. “And it means we’re never really out of the fight, with our ability to score the ball, and I think that’s important. To be a good team you got to be able to put the ball in the basket and you got to be able to go on these runs and I feel like we are a team that can do that.”
Bamisile finished with a game-high 21 points on 9-of-13 shooting from the field and 3-of-7 from beyond the arc while showing off the skills that Colonials fans have come to adore. The Virginia Tech transfer added three assists, two rebounds, a steal, a block and one of his signature windmill dunks.
Freshman guard Brayon Freeman also flourished early in the game driving to the basket and finishing at the rim. He struggled with turnovers early on, committing four in the first half, but cleaned it up in the second half, forfeiting the ball zero times.
“I thought his ability to get downhill and really push the tempo in transition was something that opened up some easy shots for us,” Christian said.
Freeman finished with 10 points, four rebounds, three assists and a steal.
After the Colonials established a large lead midway through the first half, they began to coast and struggled a bit on offense. The Dukes held a 15-2 advantage in offensive rebounding in the first half and forced 11 first half turnovers.
But the Colonials maintained a commanding 33-19 halftime lead thanks to a 9-of-40 first half shooting performance from Duquesne, who scored 18 of their 19 first half points in the paint, with the other one coming at the free throw line.
“They had 15 offensive rebounds in the first half,” Christian said. “But they were missing. At the end of the day, the job of the defense is for them to miss, and we were finding ways, even with all those offensive rebounds, to continue to get to the miss because we were rotating well and staying connected.”
GW started the second half well and dispelled any notion of a Duquesne comeback thanks to back-to-back three pointers from Bamisile and junior guard James Bishop.
The hot start gave the Colonials a 39-19 lead a minute into the second stanza. Bishop averaged 19.1 points per game, finishing with nine points on 4-of-13 shooting and one assist.
Duquesne continued to only find success down low as the second half wore on. But the Dukes finally hit their first field goal outside of the paint with 14:02 remaining thanks to a three pointer from freshman guard Primo Spears to cut the GW lead to 49-26.
The Colonials were in control for the rest of the game and got out to a 71-44 lead, their biggest of the night, with 2:49 remaining before Christian emptied the bench and fielded some players who don’t typically see the floor.
One of these players was senior guard Theonafis Stamoulis, who served as the team manager last season after transferring from Division II Adelphi. Stamoulis finished with two points and one rebound and was awarded the team’s player of the game award, otherwise known as George’s Chain of Command.
“He’s a guy who has put everything into this program for two years,” Christian said. “And it’s good to see him be rewarded.”
The Colonials have surpassed preseason expectations and are currently in eighth place in the Atlantic 10 with only three weeks remaining until the conference tournament.
GW returns home on Saturday to face Rhode Island for a 6 p.m. tip-off as they look to move above .500 in conference play for the first time since January 3, 2021.

The Colonials (11-14, 4-8 A-10) managed to hold off the Patriots (8-16, 2-10 A-10) 65-57 in a close one, relying on a hot start offensively. 
Women’s basketball notched their fourth straight win in conference play against George Mason at home Wednesday night.
The Colonials (11-14, 4-8 A-10) managed to hold off the Patriots (8-16, 2-10 A-10) 65-57 in a close one, relying on a hot start offensively and complete control of the boards in the first half to hand George Mason their fourth straight loss.
“I think we’ve really made a commitment to spend more time on the offensive end really working on getting shots within our offense,” Head Coach Caroline McCombs said. “And so we’ll do a lot of break downs throughout practice.”
Redshirt junior forward Mayowa Taiwo led the way for GW, notching a monster double-double scoring 18 points and grabbing 17 rebounds. The Colonials routed the Patriots on the glass 4-to-24 on the night.
“I just had to keep my offensive mindset and keep attacking the defense,” Taiwo said. “It was a frustrating game with calls and physicality. But my teammates kept encouraging me and had my back.”
Junior guard Sheslanie Laureano also netted 14 points while hitting 3-of-7 from deep. On the visiting team, sophomore guard Taylor Jameson accumulated 20 points on 5-of-11 shooting from beyond the arc in a strong outing as well.
The Colonials got off to a hot first-quarter start, catalyzed by an early offensive showing from Laureano, who hit three shots from beyond the arc in the first half.
Defense has continued to be the fulcrum of the GW squad, as they limited the Patriots to just 22 attempts and 41.5 percent from the field in the first half. That defense gave way to fast-break scoring opportunities resulting in 12 points off of fast breaks and turnovers.
Deep in the second quarter, after George Mason made two free throws, the early GW lead had been cut down to just two before Laureano capped a 7-0 Colonial run with another 3-ball.
The Patriots were forced into two shot-clock violations as the half came to a close, allowing GW to maintain a five-point lead of 29-24.
Junior guard Essence Brown kicked off the scoring in the third quarter with a pair of jumpers. Graduate student guard Kyara Frames then hit a trey while being fouled and converted the “and-one” opportunity to put the Colonials up by 11, their largest lead of the game up to that point.
George Mason countered with a 3-ball of their own, but Taiwo converted a layup, and freshman guard Maxine Engel put up a basket, prompting the Patriots to call a timeout with 5:51 left in the quarter and GW ahead 41–29. Engel scored once more, but George Mason found themselves in a groove soon after.
Following a layup on the prior possession, Jameson drilled a 3-point bucket and then pickpocketed Engel near midcourt, before pulling up to drain another 3-ball to cut the lead to six. McCombs called a timeout with 3:26 left to stem some of the momentum.
“We had to lock back in on defense and take care of the ball,” Taiwo said. “We started giving them easy points, and we needed to get more stops.”
Taiwo converted a difficult layup out of the timeout, showing off her extension while falling away from the basket. But the Patriots closed out the quarter on a 12-2 scoring run, with Jameson sinking another 3, and had managed to cut the deficit to four at a score of 45–41.
George Mason shot 4-of-6 from beyond the arc and capitalized on the Colonials’ mistakes, scoring six points off turnovers and the fast break.
The Patriots opened the scoring in the fourth quarter, cutting the lead to two, before Frames drew a foul and converted one from the free throw line. Brown hit a wide open jumper off a pass from Frames, and Taiwo made another difficult layup, twisting and turning away from the defender to will the ball into the basket.
After George Mason clawed their way back within two once more, Taiwo secured her double-double with a layup and 4:37 left to play before powering her way through a foul on the next possession and sinking the “and-one” opportunity to put the Colonials up 55-48.
“She has tremendous composure on the floor,” McCombs said.
Taiwo continued to keep the Patriots at bay, finishing a backwards layup with 2:08 left. On the next Colonials possession, she created some space for herself inside the paint, hitting a contested jumper that swirled around the rim of the basket before finding its way into the net with 1:17 left.
Laureano drew a foul and missed both of her attempts at the line, but she drew another foul and redeemed herself, converting both from the charity stripe to put GW up 63-55.
“It felt good,” Laureano said. “I’ve been frustrated. So my team had my back – they’ve been talking to me – so I knew I had to make those two free throws.”
Engel made both of her shots from the line, and Brown played some tenacious defense on the other end to force a rare Jameson airball before Frames ran the clock down a few plays later.
McCombs said the team has learned from a string of close losses they had earlier in the season as they have built their win streak.
“I think we’ve learned from those experiences, VCU, St. Bonaventure,” McCombs said. “It hurts, it hurts when you lose those close games at the end, so you really start evaluating that and start practicing your end game situations even more.”
The Colonials will hit the road again for a Sunday matchup against Saint Joseph’s at 2 p.m.

D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services Chief John Donnelly and Chief Financial Officer Mark Diaz attended Tuesday's ribbon cutting ceremony alongside other officials.
D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services celebrated the reopening of Foggy Bottom’s Engine 23 Firehouse with a ribbon-cutting ceremony Tuesday after renovations forced an extended closure of the site last year until December.
The District funded $2.36 million in renovations that will help preserve the 112-year-old building for continued emergency use to promote heightened safety for the local community and firefighters stationed in the facility, according to a release issued by FEMS Tuesday. About 50 people gathered at the event, which included remarks from the District’s fire chief, the deputy mayor for public safety and justice and GW’s executive vice president and chief financial officer Mark Diaz before firefighters offered tours of the firehouse for visitors.
John Donnelly, the chief of the department, said FEMS invested in the renovation to enhance safety throughout Foggy Bottom and across the District. He said the building’s history and central location as the fire engine assigned to the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial, U.S. State Department, Lincoln Memorial and other spots in Northwest D.C. make the firehouse a centerpiece of the community.
“This firehouse was built about the same time that Foggy Bottom became home to George Washington University,” Donnelly said during the ceremony. “It was clearly a commitment to safety in this community. That commitment remains in place with this renovation.”

The Engine 23 Firehouse reopened in December after recent renovations kept the site closed for much of 2021.
The renovations upgraded sleeping quarters, lighting, kitchen equipment, HVAC operations, ventilation equipment and a lactation room within the building, according to the release.
Donnelly said local 20th century architect Snowden Ashford designed the two-story red brick building to hold a horse-drawn fire fighting steam carriage for its opening in 1910 before its modern-day use. Now the smallest firehouse in D.C., Donnelly said Engine 23 is one of the only firehouses in the city with spiral staircases, which were first intended to prevent horses from climbing.
Donnelly said Engine 23 also needs to line up its firetruck and ambulance one in front of the other because of the limited space – making it one of the only firehouses to not place the two side by side, each with their own driveways.
Danielle Towers | Assistant Photo Editor
After the ribbon-cutting ceremony, firefighters offered tours of the firehouse for visitors to scope out the facility, including the historic spiral stairs.
Philip Stevens, the captain of Engine 23, joked that the reopening of the alleyways on each side of the firehouse, which students use to walk between Kogan Plaza and G Street, could be the most major change that students notice to come out of the renovations at the site.
“Of all the upgrades and improvements to the firehouse, the alley on this side of the firehouse may be the most important feature,” he said. “It’s a popular route of travel for students going to and from class, and I think we’ve got more comments that the alley is open now than anything else.”
Stevens said the improved facilities will ensure Engine 23 will continue to save lives during past emergencies that have drawn responses from the station, like the 1922 Knickerbocker Theater fire that killed 98 people near modern-day Adams Morgan, the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon and a Q Street fire where firefighters saved a man from a burning apartment this past December.
“Every day, members of Engine 23 perform their jobs in a selfless and professional manner that’s come to define the District of Columbia fire department,” Stevens said.

The District funded $2.36 million in renovations that include upgraded sleeping quarters, lighting, kitchen equipment, HVAC operations, ventilation equipment and a lactation room within the building.
Stevens said members of Engine 23 wanted to preserve parts of the building’s history that were at risk of being destroyed during the renovation process, and officials did extensive roof and exterior work to protect the building’s historic facade. He said although the station first planned to throw out a large door from the second floor that was originally used to transport hay when horses were stabled in the firehouse, one firefighter preserved it and turned it into a table that is now placed in the building’s kitchen.
“Keeping the history alive is very important in this job, and we tried to do that as best we could,” he said.
Diaz, GW’s executive vice president and CFO, thanked the firefighters of Engine 23 for their presence on campus and voiced his support for GW’s relationship with the fire department.
“Safety is second to none at GW,” Diaz said. “I can’t think of a better symbol in the virtual center of our campus as a firehouse – a newer one at that – to align with our safety standard.”

My first day as a freshman began with the University Honors Program course, The Origins of Modern Thought: Justice. In our small group of 14 students, each was allowed to introduce themselves. Unsurprisingly, more than half of the class, myself included, said they intended to major in International Affairs with a particular concentration. But one student in the group said “I’m a classical studies major–like Ancient Greece, Latin and philosophy… that kind of stuff.” 
Wow – classical studies and philosophy? Why study something so ancient? How will that be relevant to any future career?  I, like probably many students would, thought that besides becoming an academic, a classical studies major is pretty useless. Clearly I still had quite a bit to learn. 
One semester later, having dipped my toes into philosophy, I’ve considered pursuing a classics major too. I’ve decided not to switch majors, but I intend to add philosophy to my International Politics major, given that the two disciplines are actually quite similar – philosophy has humanized the theories emerging in my international relations and political science classes and allowed me to dive deep into how individuals are inclined to act in both times of war and peace. While not all majors have to, or even should be taught completely with theory, students can benefit from incorporating philosophy into career-oriented studies and everyday life alike. So much for my useless assumption. 
Besides philosophy and classics majors, only a tiny minority of students take philosophy classes, usually through special programs like the University Honors Program among other academic or religious groups, like MEOR’s Maimonedes fellowship, a Jewish philosophy discussion group. Students a part of UHP – 500 of approximately 12,000 undergraduates – make up only 4 percent of GW’s student body. While political science courses do integrate some classical theory, they barely scratch the surface. GW does have many pathways through which students can explore the classics and philosophy, so GW should definitely surpass that 4 percent baseline implemented across all fields of study. Students will benefit in each facet of their life, from school to their career, and in their relationships with each other. 
The slow death of classical studies among the broader humanities is nothing new. Universities across the United States have substantially cut such programs due to financial reasons and the rapid decline in demand for this coursework in recent years. On the flip side, career-oriented majors, notably STEM, have seen explosive growth. Advancements in fields of medicine and science have peaked. Academic administrators must recognize that, at the base of these sciences – for both hard sciences and social sciences – is philosophy. It’s the foundation for not only the field itself, but how to engage with it for effective outcomes. Objectives are weakened by merely possessing knowledge without the critical thinking and analysis skills to execute that knowledge. 
Philosophy is personified in the workplace, where human interaction, teamwork and critical thinking are key to a productive environment. Today’s hyper-competitive and stressful environments tend to unveil people’s true colors, and understanding how human beings tend to think under pressure can help students better manage their own conduct. Studying philosophy can teach how to navigate workplace challenges by mitigating personal reactions and assertive, respectful communication. Knowledge of the facts is useful, but with people-management skills and critical thinking absent from its application, outcomes are poor or mediocre at best. 
Developing different ways of thinking through stressful situations arising from school, work, relationships and general interactions, can be effective tools to deal with day-to-day issues. Therapists and guidance counselors consider mindset shifts – from fixed mindsets to growth mindsets – the antidote to the surging anxiety that students and adults in the workforce experience today. These mindset shifts are actually philosophical models applied to their respective situations and specific issues. I speak from experience and can tell you that studying philosophy has enabled me to obtain a resilience of the mind like nothing else has. 
Reading Stoic philosophy, for example, has helped set frustration aside by disregarding the external forces out of my sphere of influence and focusing on actions within my immediate control. For instance, rather than stressing out over exams, I have come to acknowledge that I studied the best I could and the results are not in my control. Each exam is just a test of some knowledge, where the grade can often be a subjective representation, so as long as I give studying a solid effort, the rest is out of my control. 
Classical studies and philosophy must be integrated into the curricula of all majors. Each major requirement should involve at least one basic philosophy class and be taught through the lens of how certain philosophies are applicable to that particular field of study. Students will reap skills in critical thinking, respectful and assertive discourse, together with relationship management to allow them to better navigate their present college lives and future careers. Most important are the tools that students will gain to lead happier, fulfilling and confident lives. 
Although many people might consider philosophy to be abstract and out of reach, people are philosophizing daily as they contemplate decisions and manage adversities. To help students succeed in all aspects of their life at GW and beyond, GW should incorporate classical studies into curricula across the University.

This November, Mayor Muriel Bowser is facing a credible Democratic primary challenger for the first time since she was elected to lead the city. At-Large D.C. Council member Robert White threw his hat in the ring in October, announcing a campaign largely focused on criminal justice reform, restorative justice and crime prevention. 
Bowser has made a solid effort to enact policies on crime prevention and criminal justice reform in the past eight years, but her efforts have produced mixed results. But it’s also unclear if White’s current plan to tackle criminal justice reform will be much of an improvement. White has proposed comprehensive plans on numerous topics, from violence interruptions to investments in restorative justice programs. But many of his ideas include investments in existing programs under the Bowser administration that produced less-than-stellar success. And under that circumstance, it’s not clear whether the situation will improve if White took over as mayor. 
During Bowser’s second mayoral victory speech in 2018, she posed a rhetorical question about crime in the District.
“We demand prosecutors and the courts share our resolve to have safe neighborhoods. Are you with me?” she said. “Because we are going to make sure that there are jobs and opportunities for everyone, and we demand safe streets in our city. And together with all of our neighbors, mI am your mayor. We’re going to get it done together.” 
In the four years that have passed since she gave this speech, Bowser has overseen actions like granting the D.C. police authority to search a person or property with no warrant – an initiative that failed – a bill passed in the D.C. Council to give those under 25 convicted of crimes a chance to reduce their sentences and an agreement with the U.S. Marshals to address concerns with the D.C. jail. But even despite those efforts, crime remains high in the District, and criminal justice reform has not advanced much. Homicide cases have increased by more than 40 percent since 2018. Carjacking cases have also skyrocketed by 153 percent from 2019 to 2020 and 18 percent from 2020 to 2021.
But can the efficacy of solving crimes and reforming the criminal justice system be improved under a new administration? It’s still unclear. Bowser, as somebody who promised and took actions on pushing for a safer city, has not been able to change a lot. While White has proposed many ideas to expand criminal justice reform, much of his framework is too dependent on the expansion of existing programs that have already proven to be ineffective. 
White has proposed bolstering investments in violence interruption programs and mental health services and emphasized the prevention of juvenile crimes. He also lists drug use as a public emergency in his platform. Although it is good to see mayoral candidates focusing on preventing juvenile crimes by putting more effort into education, the investment in the violence interruption program needs clarification. White’s plan currently fails to emphasize both how to invest more in violence interruption and make the current pilot program more effective in combating crimes.
But White’s plan to reduce violence throughout the city does have promise. In the second part of the “Responding to Violence” portion of his platform, White details plans to expand restorative justice programs and police reform from police tactics to building more accountability from each community. 
Many of those proposals – especially by expanding restorative justice programs, which are aimed to help convicted criminals realize their crimes and discourage them from committing crimes again – can make a difference. Many existing restorative justice programs are proven to lower incarceration rates in other major cities. For example, in Brooklyn, New York, the Red Hook Community Justice Center is designed to treat the people who walk through its doors with respect, even housing GED information and housing resources on the floors above the courthouse. The result has been that the number of people being sentenced to jail dropped by 35 percent. And based on a study in a restorative justice program of victim-offender mediation across the United States, the recidivism rate for those who participated in the program, 18 percent, is lower than those who did not participate, 27 percent.
In 2021, D.C.’s incarceration rate reached 899 out of 100,000 people, the eighth highest incarceration rate throughout the United States, according to a report by the Prison Policy Initiative. By investing more funding and efforts in restorative justice, pushing for such a system is the right direction to eventually reduce the incarceration rates in D.C. and help convicted individuals to reenter society better.  
It’s promising to hear that the two leading candidates for D.C. mayor are prioritizing restorative justice programs in their platforms, but they both still have work to do to detail better crime prevention tactics.
