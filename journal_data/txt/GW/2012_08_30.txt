For men’s head soccer coach Craig Jones, patience is as much a virtue to live by as it is a strategy on the pitch.
And as players have learned from their new leader, patience has the potential to pay off in a big way.
After 14 years with the Colonials, as a player and then 10 seasons as an assistant coach, Jones is no longer waiting in the wings.
When George Lidster retired at the end of last season, it only took athletic director Patrick Nero four days to promote the alumnus to the head coach position. The team for which Jones once played is his to manage.
“I’ve said a bunch of times that this is like a dream job to me,” Jones said. “If you want to be successful, you set yourself career goals – you set yourself a path. This was something I wanted to do, and I had set my mind to do it. I was just lucky enough that I got to do it at GW instead of having to go all around the country to do it.”
A native of Wales and the son of a semi-pro soccer player, Jones was just 4 years old when he started kicking around the soccer ball. And despite a quick fling with rugby, Jones always preferred “the round ball to the oval ball.”
But a career in sports is not always a sure path. Confronted with the likelihood of an unsteady professional life following his four years as a Colonial, Jones considered coaching at the collegiate level as an alternative.
“There wasn’t really that much of a safety net in terms of what was available – one week you could have got paid, and the next week you didn’t,” Jones said. “So I started to focus a little more then on the coaching side of stuff.”
After helping the A-10’s 13th-ranked Colonials take a share of the 2011 regular season title and travel to the championship game, Jones was promptly hired to take the place of a seasoned veteran coach in Lidster, who was also the program’s all-time winningest coach.
With last season’s successes still fresh for players and fans alike, Jones acknowledges the certainty of high expectations for the team this year, too. There’s a renewed focus on the team in his first year at the helm of the program, but it’s a level of examination the Colonials’ coach welcomes.
“There’s certainly pressure. Last year we kind of overachieved in many people’s eyes. People want that every year, once they have a taste of it,” Jones said. “But if you don’t feel the pressure to win, \you’re probably in the wrong profession.”
He is aware of his players’ desire to return to the title game – and they are open to the new coach’s strategies to get them there.
“I think he expects a lot out of us. I know he wants to win the A-10, and so do we,” co-captain Seth Rudolph said. “He’s doing his best to guide us along the right path to make that happen.”
Jones is focused on the short-term changes and tweaks he plans on imprinting on the program’s culture. He is pushing for more accountability on and off the field – hoping his players will embrace rounded academic and extracurricular lifestyles – and emphasizing the importance of player-to-player support.
On the field, he’s preaching a more possession-oriented style of play, a style that requires increased patience and fewer impulsive attacks. That method may lead to more slow-paced offensive maneuvers, but Jones said he would take methodical play over hasty play any day.
“We are a little bit more possession-focused. Sometimes that doesn’t produce instant results,” Jones said. “When we do go forward, we want to go with numbers. The best way to do that is play through the lines and make sure we have numbers supporting the attack.”
Strategies, play books and team bonding aside, Jones also boasts a skill that will likely prove useful for the team, a tool central to giving his Colonials the lethal edge they need. His players said he understands the art of a good pep talk.
“Coach has some great pregame speeches,” he said. “He can really get you motivated and going.”

Sept. 5 | Black Cat | $15
On tour to promote their 12th studio album, “Breakup Song,” Deerhoof never fails to test the limits of punk rock with experimental sound. Fusing pop, blues-rock and distortion, the San Francisco-based trio balances roughness and levity, aggressive guitar sounds and gentle vocals. Even as Deerhoof’s music reaches the height of its frenzy, the trio maintains its sense of technical precision, proving that even the most discordant sounds can boast musicality.
Score: Deerhoof’s eclectic punk style promises an entertaining live set that is more than the usual raucous, sloppy sounds.
Bore: Two hardcore, noise-heavy opening bands at one small venue could lead to some moshing bruises.

Sept. 15 | Merriweather Post Pavillion | $40-$55
A Wisconsin cabin-dweller and a Vermont-raised farm girl are a folk-rock duo made in heaven. Bon Iver, led by Justin Vernon, emerged in 2008 with the eloquent and elegantly rendered “For Emma, Forever Ago,” a musing on heartbreak and solitude that shot the indie group to fame. Anaïs Mitchell rose to prominence in a similar fashion: Her debut album was recorded in one day, with little additional sound editing. Both artists boast folk-rock chops and a rare shrewdness for instrumental expertise, delivered with unparalleled emotion.
Score: An acoustic singer-songwriter pairing of epic proportions at an airy, relaxing outdoor venue.
Bore: The combination of two mellow folk artists could rock audiences to sleep.

Sept. 19 | Merriweather Post Pavillion | $40-$55
In 2008, Florence + The Machine captivated listeners with the sprightly “Dog Days Are Over.” The rest is history. Florence delivers commanding vocals and an effortlessly brazen tone. The September show’s diverse line-up also features breakthrough R&B artist The Weeknd, whose ingenuity and sheer talent elevated him from relative anonymity to underground stardom after  gaining thousands of YouTube hits.
Score: One would be hard-pressed to find a more powerful female singer to showcase her vocal prowess on the stage.
Bore: The show comes at a hefty price tag, in addition to travel expenses to the Columbia, Md. venue.

Sept. 30 | 9:30 Club | $35
Few would dispute that 2012 was a breakthrough year for electronic dance music, and experimental duo Crystal Castles was at the helm of that expansion. Bold, rambunctious and typically culminating in a cacophony of noise, the pair’s sound ventures into piercing synth with no hesitation. Since the band’s 2004 inception, the electronic pioneers have polished their sound without sacrificing tenacity, remaining at the forefront of progressive dance music. Don’t be misled by their refined style: Crystal Castles remain committed to delivering a rebellious clamor which demands permanence in the realm of popular music.
Score: Crystal Castles are notorious for their chaotic, high-energy live sets.
Bore: Emerging from this show unscathed and without temporary hearing loss may prove difficult.

Skewers are the perfect party food – you can eat them without even putting down your drink. Biting into one of my chicken potato skewers is a party in itself. Flavors of tender chicken, savory roasted tomatoes and rich baby potatoes balance perfectly in this dish. Dipped in tandoori raita – made with healthy Greek yogurt and infused with lime, garlic and mint, it’s a fun appetizer that will make your kitchen a destination.
Serves about eight
1 bag of baby potatoes
1 container of grape tomatoes
Olive oil
Salt
Fresh thyme leaves
Greek yogurt, a few tablespoons
2 garlic cloves, minced
Tandoori spice
Half of one lime
Cumin, a pinch
Mint, chopped
Honey (optional drizzle)
2 chicken breasts

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.
2. Rinse potatoes and tomatoes, and toss with olive oil, salt and thyme. Scatter on a sheet pan, and bake, turning once, until potatoes are tender and tomatoes are soft and slightly shriveled.
3. Meanwhile, mix together the yogurt, garlic, tandoori seasoning, lime juice, salt, cumin and mint. You can also add a drizzle of honey. Allow the flavors to marry while you prepare the chicken.
4. Cut chicken breasts into bite-sized pieces. Heat a sauté pan over medium-high heat and add a tablespoon of olive oil. Then add the chicken, and season with salt and tandoori seasoning. Add curry powder for an extra kick.
5. Slide pieces of chicken, tomato and potato onto each skewer. Repeat until all skewers are assembled. Serve on a platter or on a cucumber boat. To make the cucumber boat, peel the bottom so the cucumber lays flat, and slice off the top quarter of it. Scoop out the cucumber, and fill with sauce. Garnish with cucumber strands.

In the past year, GW hired 96 new full-time faculty members, up from 76 new hires in the fall of last year. At a time when many universities have been forced to freeze spending and hiring of new faculty members, the University emerged largely unscathed.
While Northwestern University, a competitor, was forced to cut back on its hiring due to decreases in their endowment in recent years, administrators said GW has diversified its faculty by hiring some of the most talented and accomplished scholars in the country.
In a crucial time, when administrators are looking to raise the bar for academics, bringing in new and talented professors is an example of making moves in areas that administrators have been highlighting as major priorities. New hires across a vast array of educational disciplines will provide undergraduate students with more opportunities to conduct research and enjoy personal attention from academic leaders in various fields.
It is no secret GW wants to become a top-tier research institution. This past week, the University unveiled a rebranding campaign that seemed out of sync with the desire to increase its prestige and national recognition. In that instance, the University’s goals and actions didn’t coincide.
Unlike the rebranding campaign, new professors will have a tangible effect on students and the University. And for that, GW deserves praise.

The School of Medicine and Health Sciences is the University’s most selective school. But it has been without a permanent dean for about 21 months. Over the past year, internal reorganization of the school’s leadership halted the search for a new dean.
The medical school was placed under probation by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education due to high student debt and poor clinical training in 2008. On the whole, a lack of permanent leadership creates some level of instability in a school. An interim dean, as a placeholder, is only in the top seat of power for a limited period of time – also limiting the power he or she has.
And while Interim Dean Jeffrey Akman has been popular among faculty and students, there is only so much someone who is known as a short-term figurehead can accomplish. The Board of Trustees approved the start of a search for a new permanent dean in May. But since then, little progress has been made.
The hiring processes for such prominent positions is always time-consuming, and the University cannot realistically expect to make a decision on a dean for months after the search does begin. But expediting the process as much as possible will ensure progress does not stall.
GW is not unfamiliar with vision and leadership issues. A survey of Columbian College of Arts and Sciences faculty in April revealed that professors largely believed Dean Peg Barratt, who will step down in the spring of 2013, lacked the ability to articulate her goals for the future of the school.
The School of Medicine was rated No. 55 in the U.S. News & World Report research rankings this year. A new dean could elevate the school’s status with a long-term vision.
Medical school students should not have to wait any longer.

An athletics department campaign is stressing the University’s commitment to discrimination-free recruitment.
“If you can play, you can play,” the video begins, establishing the University’s position that athletes will be judged solely by how well they perform and not by other factors, like sexual orientation.
The You Can Play Project, a nonprofit that seeks to ensure fairness and support for LGBT athletes nationwide, establishes a culture of tolerance on campuses and in locker rooms, sending a clear message to all student-athletes that they are supported. The athletic department, under athletic director Patrick Nero, stresses a culture of inclusion that could inspire more universities to establish their own advocacy campaigns.
But then again, GW had the opportunity to be a national model for this cause in its not-so-distant past. And it dropped the ball.
In fall 2010, women’s basketball player Kye Allums came out as transgender, making history as the first openly transgender player ever in NCAA Division 1 Athletics.
After Allums’ announcement, he became an international role model for LGBT athletes. The University and its athletics department – then headed by Jack Kvancz – were the first to be tasked with supporting a transgender Division 1 athlete. Not only did they have a tremendous obligation to foster a culture of inclusion and support, but they could have offered a model for supporting LGBT athletes and ensuring that if someone can play, he or she can play.
The University could have immediately hired a psychologist to help Allums, the basketball team and then-head coach Mike Bozeman make the adjustment to both Allums’ announcement and the publicity the program was receiving. But Bozeman told Sports Illustrated the University did not bring in a psychologist until the spring. The University could have encouraged Allums to share his story with the world, but Allums’ mother Rolanda Delamartinez told The Hatchet the University barred her son from speaking to the media.
The University is not always proactive about sharing information, but that was a time when it needed to be transparent and supportive. Going forward, GW should make sure to fully embrace and support its players, not just emotionally, but also by providing instruction on how to handle public reactions and the media.
Since the Sports Illustrated article published in May, Allums has called his GW experience supportive.
“They wanted me to be happy,” Allums said in the Fearless Project video. “They cared about my feelings, and they wanted me to be in a comfortable environment where I could perform well.”
These recent comments might seem to contradict Allums’ remarks to Sports Illustrated, but instead they reflect the intricacy of the situation. The athletics department and the women’s basketball team are both under new leadership, and it is encouraging to see athletic director Patrick Nero making LGBT inclusion a hallmark of his term.
It is encouraging to see the University taking such an active stance to support LGBT athletes.

The first time I felt politically inadequate was during my second week of GW.
While talking to other freshmen – who were also worried about the nervous introductions that accompany the first few weeks of college life – I told them my major: English. And then they asked about my political stance.
I explained that I was a moderate.
“Moderates are bullshit,” one student said. “You gotta choose one.”
Now that election season is underway, I’m reminded of that freshman year instance and how alienating political conversations here can be. In a single instant, the other student had completely written off my thoughts.
In the upcoming weeks, as red and blue signs plaster corridors around campus, we independents will put in our headphones and walk through November like any other month.
Don’t get me wrong. I’m planning to vote in the presidential election this November. I just don’t plan to wear my political persuasions on my sleeve.  I may not rally in front of the White House or refresh Politico every 10 minutes for updates, but that doesn’t mean that my opinion is any less relevant.
Political involvement is not necessarily an indicator of social awareness. A Democratic or Republican candidate may stick to the party line, but when it comes to the issues, he or she may still be utterly disconnected from the concerns of followers and supporters. Independents, looking in from the sidelines, can offer unique and unbiased insight by voting based on issues instead of along party lines.
Above all else, I am bothered by the emptiness of political speeches. Politicians spit evasive answers to scripted questions. Mitt Romney refuses to release his tax returns. His reasoning?
“Our church doesn’t publish how much people have given,” he told Parade Magazine.
Political speeches are full of promises and crowd-pleasing gimmicks, but they are often devoid of any real information.
“What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them, that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply,” Barack Obama said in his inaugural address.
Call me a cynic, but I do not believe the state of political arguments will ever change. As long as there are political parties, there will be a constant tug-of-war that hinders progress.
But by rejecting opaque and meaningless political rhetoric, independents are able to judge the news objectively. We provide a balance in society. We are the bystanders who try to make sense of the tension between both sides. In a world of bias, we are the ones who maintain level heads and listen to all sides of an argument – not just the jargon of speechwriters.

Rally around the new logo
I was very excited to see the new logo that has been developed for GW. It was disappointing, however, to see the rather negative coverage by The Hatchet on the introduction of the University’s new visual identity. A design project, such as the rebranding of a major university, is a complicated effort.
No task is ever more subjective than a design project, and even though everyone might not agree on some details, the University should at least be supported in its attempt to create a distinctive, updated and attractive visual identity.
The new brand features a unique yet accurate image of our namesake. It ties the new logo to the historical heart of the Foggy Bottom Campus and University Yard, as it was inspired by the statue there. The new visual identity also restores the use of the school colors, buff and blue, and uses a bold font that is eye-catching and also stands out from lettering styles used by other institutions.
Change is not always embraced by all, but as a university community, let’s celebrate the “new look” of GW and continue to work together to help our university reach its great potential. Hail to the buff and blue.
Michael La Place is an alumnus of the Class of 1985 and a member of the George Washington Alumni Association’s board of directors.
Rebranding doesn’t prioritize students
After much hype, GW unveiled a new logo Sunday.
Let me state this simply: It’s awful.
The University decided to do away with the portrait of George Washington and replaced it with a cartoonish picture and a bland font. It’s a downgrade, to say the least.
But what is most frustrating is that the rebranding campaign was likely very expensive. This is irritating not only because the uninspiring visuals are undeserving of that expense, but also because of all the other ways that the money could have been spent.
Over the past four years, I have heard the same complaints from students. Dining continues to be a major problem, despite efforts to remedy it. And what about Gelman Library? The first floor improvements that are underway barely address the overcrowding on all the other floors. How about academic advising? Or the Lerner Health and Wellness Center, with limited hours of operation?
Is our logo really more important than the happiness of our student body?
It seems that way. It’s downright disappointing to see the University prioritize its image over its students’ wants and needs. Of all the complaints I’ve heard over the years, the logo looking outdated was not one of them.
If GW really wants to change its look, it should start paying attention to the real problems at hand.

The University is housing most newly enrolled transfer students under the same roof this year in the latest round of a guessing game on how to help new non-freshmen transition into GW.
About 120 students live in Lafayette Hall, as opposed to last year’s housing assignments that scattered transfers across the Foggy Bottom and Mount Vernon campuses. Center for Student Engagement director Tim Miller said his staff will use this year’s findings to craft a formal plan on how to make transfers feel at home, tugging at one perennial question: whether to group those students in one community or embed them with other students.
One large transfer community could ease the transition into the University by linking up students who are looking to integrate into GW, Tim Miller said.
The office will gauge how feedback compares to last year – when nearly half of transfers were placed on the Mount Vernon Campus – to determine which housing environment best suits students and aims to keep in touch until graduation.
“I don’t know which one is better – which is part of the reason why we’re trying this,” Tim Miller said. He said students’ wide range of backgrounds makes him hesitant to lock in one option for all of them.
“Half of them want to be treated like freshmen and say they’re starting brand new, and the other half say, ‘I’ve done it before, leave me alone,’ ” he said.
For the first time, the University is also rolling out a one-on-one mentorship program called TEAM that will pair incoming transfers with older transfer students, similar to the freshman-focused Guide to Personal Success concept.
Graduate student Ben Miller, the assistant program coordinator for transfer support services, will run the semester-long program. He said 72 new transfers signed up for a guide, while 55 returning transfer students volunteered to be mentors.
“It allows returning transfers to share their knowledge with new transfers and to share their ‘how to do GW’ information,” he said. “It’s opt-in, so everyone who wants to be a part of it will be.”
Tim Miller added that it is difficult for the University to allow transfer students to choose their own housing due to their late application period – after returning students apply for housing.
About 40 other transfer students live in other Foggy Bottom halls, and about 220 transfers live off campus, Director of GW Housing Programs Seth Weinshel said.
About 380 students transferred to GW this fall, about 10 fewer than last fall’s figure, which was the highest in four years.
Last year, GW faced fire from transfer students placed on the Mount Vernon Campus who claimed they felt disconnected from Foggy Bottom. Several transferred to housing on the Foggy Bottom Campus, though the housing office did not track the precise number.
Coming up with a one-size-fits-all approach to housing transfer students is tricky, Ari Massefski, the transfer and new students representative to Student Association, said.
Living only with other transfer students is good for “meeting others who are also new to the community, but on the flip side it will be hard for them to meet new students from the rest of GW,” he said.
“The thing about transfers is that you can’t stereotype them,” Massefski said. “There are transfers who are old, some come out of big universities, some come out of community colleges. Others are straight out of the military.”
Peter Metelski, a sophomore transfer student, said so far, living in Lafayette Hall has eased him into GW.
“We’ve gotten to know everyone through the hall parties,” said Metelski, who was previously enrolled at a military college. “It’s been great.”
Natasha Cases, a new junior on campus, said that the close proximity to other transfers has made everyone “very eager to get to know each other.”
But sophomore transfer Andrew Barksdale said living in Lafayette makes it tough to meet the rest of the student body.
“Since we’re all in the same building, it isn’t convenient,” Barksdale said, adding that he plans to meet other students through clubs and classes.

Alumni descending upon the Republican and Democratic national conventions will take a pause from party politics to gather at receptions for their alma mater.
About 75 people are on the guest list for Thursday’s alumni reception at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla., hosted by the Office of Alumni Relations, associate director of Regional Alumni Programs Renee Thomas said. About 190 individuals are registered for the Sept. 4 Democratic gathering in Charlotte, N.C.
Omar Woodard, who has served on the Board of Trustees, began coordinating the events in May.
Woodard, a two-time alumnus and former Student Association president, will host the reception in Charlotte, N.C., Thomas said. Woodard has donated $750 to the Democratic party since 2010.
Mark Kennedy, director of the Graduate School of Political Management and a former Republican congressman from Minnesota, will host the Tampa, Fla. reception.
Both hosts will “provide their perspectives on the role GW plays in the political landscape,” Thomas said. She added that they will also provide commentary on both conventions, and alumni and students will get the opportunity to mingle over free appetizers and drinks.
Kennedy said the gathering would give alumni the chance to meet others with similar ideologies while keeping them in touch with the University.
“It’s a chance for alumni that share political passion to get together from a school where, whether you studied science or politics, you were still studying four blocks away from the White House,” Kennedy said. “I think most GW alums have some connection or interest in politics.”
The receptions will mirror those held during the 2008 conventions – the first time GW marked its presence at both conventions.
Four years ago, 70 attendees signed up for the DNC reception, Thomas said. She said she did not have attendance numbers for the RNC reception.
Thomas said the events could not include fundraisers for either side of the aisle. She declind to disclose the cost of each event.
University President Steven Knapp increased the number of alumni networking events across the nation by about 100 since he took the helm in 2007, looking to forge stronger relationships with graduates.
