As the Class of 2012 celebrates graduation on the National Mall next month, there will be four Colonials missing from the procession.
Taylor Hubbard, Benjamin Gupta, Jennifer Gonzalez Perdomo and Ismail Ginwala would have graduated May 20, but there is still a chance to honor their memories at Commencement.
The University should start an annual tradition of placing a white chair at the front line of the University-wide Commencement for each deceased student during the year he or she would have graduated.
Already, the University recognizes student deaths with memorial ceremonies and candlelight vigils, bringing together friends and family to mourn losses and share stories, but starting the tradition of placing white chairs for lost Colonials at graduation is a way to pay tribute to both the memory of the students as well as their academic accomplishments.
This memorial would be in addition to the wooden plaque on the ground floor of the Marvin Center that honors Colonials who died during their time at GW. The right-most panel has rows of empty plaques – an eerie anticipation of losses to come.
But you might not have seen the plaque, because it is tucked away under an exit sign in a dimly lit hallway between the GW Bookstore and the WRGW offices.
The spot is hardly the place for an homage to community members who are no longer with us.
A series of plaques similar to the Distinguished Alumni Achievement Award, which prominently rests in the Marvin Center, would serve as a more appropriate marker for students who have died. Kogan Plaza may also be a more visible location.
The plaque has an aging, neglected look and it is not a fitting way to honor the memory of those students who are no longer with us.
GW highlights the achievements of its graduates who go on to do great things, but for those students whose contribution to society will forever remain unknown, there should be a more notable way for the University to show respect.

Finals are a demanding time for students but this year, the last weeks of the semester will be even more tense due to construction blasting.
Controlled blasting began Thursday at the Science and Engineering Hall site as a means to excavate large rocks. The blasting will occur every morning for the next four to six months, temporarily closing surrounding streets. The University advised residents in adjacent buildings to close windows to prevent smoke and debris from blowing into their rooms.
The University should halt the blasting until after finals so students in Gelman Library and nearby residence halls are not distracted by the loud rumbling and accompanying air horns each morning.
The actual blasts will last only for a few seconds, University spokeswoman Jill Sankey told The Hatchet last week, but the blaring of air horns three times prior to the blasts and once afterward to signal the activity will inevitably be disruptive. The sound might be brief, but as students study late into the night, any unnecessary noises that would disrupt morning sleep should be avoided.
In the Infomail sent to students April 25, the blasting was compared to “more intense vibrations likened to the vibrations associated with a minor earthquake.”
Increasing construction during finals week is a serious issue for students who should be preparing for exams – not planning their study and sleep schedules around clamor.
The initial plan for the future site of the Science and Engineering Hall was approved in the 2007 Foggy Bottom Campus Plan, and the University has had ample time since the D.C. Zoning Commission issued an order of approval in July to establish a construction timeline that respects the needs of students. Construction should continue through finals in a benign fashion, but any intensification should wait until after finals end.
This is not the first time students have felt their needs were neglected in the name of improving campus structures. In the fall, the Residence Hall Association voiced concerns about exceptionally boisterous construction in the early morning. The University promised, in response, to regulate loud noise coming from the construction site before 8 a.m. But this minor adjustment has a minimal effect on students.
Many college students study late into the night, and I speak for many when I say waking up at 8 a.m. is far from ideal. Construction at such an early hour contradicts University efforts to foster student success and well-being.
Construction is not a bad thing. State-of-the-art facilities like the future Science and Engineering Hall will boost the University’s academic reputation, but blasting during finals represents a significant oversight on the University’s part.
When considering the University’s long-term success, students’ immediate needs – like adequate time for sleep and study – should not be shoved to the wayside.

The number of student organizations on campus has skyrocketed from 400 clubs last year to a record 471 this year, presenting a problem on how to fund the groups.
The Student Association funding will plateau starting this fall because the last increase in SA fees has finally cycled through students. This means that money for student groups will decrease if the number of student organizations continues to rise.
In the past four years, funding for student organizations has steadily increased because of a previous increase in the student fee.
To compensate for the new student organizations without affecting existing and more established student groups, the SA should call for an increase in student fees.
Students pay $22.50 each semester to the Student Association to help put on events such as Spring Fling, Fall Fest, speaker events and sports games. To subsidize the increase in funding for student organizations, it would make sense to slightly raise this already small charge to benefit students by $5 per semester.
Incoming Student Association Finance Chair Alex Mizenko said with the current funding model, the only way to adequately fund new student organizations is to cut money to established organizations.
To pass a fee increase, there would have to be a vote in the Senate and a school-wide referendum.
Students should call on the Student Association to quickly move on this proposal, which represents students’ investment in their time at the University. The amount paid into the system will benefit students during the next year.
After all, the growing number of student organizations on campus is a good thing for student life.

Because of Steven Knapp’s focus on sustainability, GW is a dramatically greener place than it was four years ago.
The University has encouraged students to become more involved in sustainability through programs like Recyclemania, the Eco-Challenge and Earth Hour. Separately, green-focused student organizations provide outlets for students to start green initiatives, such as the student-run co-op café and the GroW Garden on H Street. Students who want to pursue sustainable practices can earn a minor in sustainability starting next year.
These initiatives demonstrate that the University is dedicated to sustainability at both an institutional and student level. At a time when decreasing our footprint is critical, these moves are crucial in proving GW is fit for the future.
To futher fuse student and administrative efforts, the University should launch and fund a Student Sustainability Collective.
A student-run collective at GW would promote the administration’s ongoing sustainability efforts. Keeping a student-run arm of the sustainability office will empower the student body to take improving campus sustainability upon itself and promote larger undertakings than just recycling and eco-challenges.
This collective would emphasize student concerns that surpass the general sustainability goals already established by the Office of Sustainability. If students wanted a change in what is recycled – for instance, the University does not recycle Solo cups – the collective could focus its efforts on reaching that goal.
Keeping the collective student-run would allow students to lead their own initiatives. Student organizations work toward improving the environment through small sustainability projects, but with the help of the University and the motivation of student leaders, a collective could drive important change.
And in crafting such an office, administrators should look to the University of California – San Diego’s Student Sustainability Collective as a model. At UCSD’s collective, students lobby for environmental issues and projects in which they are involved.
UCSD’s office simultaneously runs seven to 12 programs including topics like food policy, public health and civil and human rights. There are food and health student organizations at GW, but if students had their own University-funded collective, these green student organizations would have the potential to make a greater impact throughout D.C.
Sustainability does not have to be isolated to one student organization. A collective would foster a dialogue on campus among the various student organizations. As a partner with the University, it would also establish conversations with other students on campus.
And the student organizations could come to the collective for guidance on how to make their efforts more sustainable and to work with like-minded students, as well as to support and help plan green events.
Jillian Du, a coordinator for The Green Initiative Fund and a UCSD collective employee, said even at UCSD “everything is growing and developing,” but that working with your university is the best way to build lasting green initiatives on campus.
A collective would give Colonials the chance to see their green ideas blossom.

Sophomore Bokum Lee wants to work as an Arabic translator, but the Middle East studies major has to get over one roadblock: GW does not offer a degree in Arabic.
That could change this fall, as the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences will make a preliminary decision May 1 on whether it will create an Arabic major and minor.
Lee, who has twice been rejected by the Columbian College to create her own Arabic major, said without the degree, she may not be able to study the language in graduate school.
“I want to be acknowledged that I majored in Arabic,” Lee said. “Majoring in Arabic only would allow me to include more dialect classes and enable me to further my proficiency in Arabic to a professional level.”
The Arabic program was folded into the Department of Classical and Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, which also includes Hebrew, Greek and Latin, in 1994. A 15-credit minor in Semitic languages and cultures requires two semesters of Hebrew along with the Arabic coursework.
Columbian College Dean Peg Barratt, Provost Steven Lerman and the Board of Trustees would all have to sign off on the new degree.
“As with any proposal for a new major, the committee will want to examine whether the program is academically sound, whether the course offerings are well structured and whether the faculty expertise is strong,” Barratt said. “The Arabic proposal will get serious attention, owing to the strong student interest and the University’s strategic commitment with regard to globalization.”
Seven students advocated April 23 for the major and minor at a separate Columbian College internal review committee meeting – part of each department’s periodic review that sketches out its mission and resources.
Both reviews come on the heels of lobbying by Mohssen Esseesy, an associate professor and the head of the Arabic program, to earn approval from the Columbian College for the degree.
More than 80 students in the Arabic program said they would major or minor in the language if the Columbian College offered the options, according to a survey distributed by Esseesy to students in Arabic classes last month.
If approved, Esseesy said he would hope to offer the degree by this fall, but added that “these things take time.”
Esseesy did not answer questions about the Arabic program’s push for the degree, the potential major’s requirements or why there has never been an Arabic degree before because the change is under review.
More students have streamed into Arabic classes over the past decade, expanding the courses nearly sixfold from the 2003-2004 academic year to hit 700 students in the 2009-2010 school year, the latest data available.
The Arabic program offered 29 course sections this spring, taught by five full-time and eight adjunct professors. Last fall, Esseesy said the Arabic program would look to hire two more full-time professors to meet growing demand for the language.
The number of students learning Arabic has also surged nationally, with enrollment at universities around the country growing by 46 percent between 2006 and 2009 as two American wars in the Middle East shined a light on the region, according to a 2010 study by the Modern Language Association.
This week, Columbian College administrators will receive the internal review committee’s report, which associate professor of English Margaret Soltan – one of three professors on the internal review committee – said would have weight, but not act as a final decider on expanding Arabic offerings because the separate undergraduate studies committee will also play a role.
“Inevitably, I’m sensing enormous pressure for an Arabic major,” Soltan said. “We don’t know what we’re going to recommend, but there’s undeniably surging interest in the field from students.”
Most of the University’s market basket schools offer a major in Arabic or an Arabic studies minor, including Washington University in St. Louis and Georgetown and Tufts universities.
Junior Sally Ashkar grew up speaking Arabic in a Syrian household and hoped to hone her reading and writing skills in the language as well as learn more about her culture at GW.
In her sixth course in the language, the international affairs and philosophy double major said she and the surging number of students taking Arabic are shut out from adding it to their official academic credentials because of the lack of a major or minor.
“With GW being such a hub for international students, and with a recent influx in students focusing their studies on the Middle East, an Arabic minor is something GW should have had in place a long time ago,” Ashkar said.

Marjane Satrapi brought her range of experiences to the stage Friday to discuss her life as a best-selling author.
The award-winning Iranian graphic novelist and writer sat on Lisner Auditorium’s stage, explaining that she aims to write stories that transcend cultures to strike at personal and emotional chords.
“I write not just about Iranian questions, but human questions,” the blunt-speaking Satrapi said. “It’s not just Western culture and then Eastern culture. Everything is a hybrid.”
Her most notable graphic novels-turned-films, the two-volume “Persepolis” series, chronicles her tumultuous youth in Iran amidst the Iranian Islamic Revolution and the Iran-Iraq war from the perspective of young Satrapi, maturing in a family of revolutionaries.
The adolescent Satrapi proves unconventional and subversive, questioning God, sneaking Iron Maiden records into her home and defiantly lambasting the Islamic regime that imprisoned members of her family.
“When they tell me I’m rebellious, I just don’t understand,” said Satrapi. “What I say, everyone who lives in Iran already knows.”
Satrapi’s work has earned her a reputation for being sarcastic and progressive compared to the widely held stereotypes of demure, reserved Middle Eastern women. The outspoken author drew parallels between generalizations about Western politics and Eastern culture, noting that to suggest that former President George W. Bush’s policies reflected the opinions of American liberals is the same as believing that all Iranians share the ideology of Iranian male clergies.
“We would never say the Inquisition is the Christian culture and that lasted a lot longer than the Islamic Revolution,” Satrapi said.
Interviewed by Iranian-American scholar Azar Nafisi, whose book “Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books” made the New York Times bestseller list, related to Satrapi’s experiences in their home country.
“The first thing a totalitarian regime does is mutilate your voice,” Nafisi said. “So constantly you want to tell people so you can rid yourself of the regime’s identity.”
Against a turbulent political backdrop and rough global relationships between the West and the Middle East, Satrapi said her writings are meant to be personal – not political.
“When a bomb is dropped on your neighbor’s home and your friend is killed, whether you’re 14, 18, 24 or 45 [years old], what difference does it make?” she asked. “The feeling is the same.”
This article was updated on April 30, 2012 to reflect the following:
The Hatchet incorrectly reported that Marjane Satrapi was Iranian-American. She is of Iranian descent.

Campus dining officials want students to know J Street has changed.
The often-criticized dining hub is seeking feedback from student leaders to redefine its brand, after one of the largest overhauls in the venue’s history last summer failed to increase sales.
The marketing revamp will become the second major change in a year to make J Street more appealing to students. With perpetual student dissatisfaction despite large-scale improvement efforts over the last six years, Director of Campus Dining for Sodexo Richard Yokeley declined to say how the latest strategy to rebrand J Street differentiates from past plans.
“We’re continuously trying to bring innovation to J Street,” Yokeley said. “We think that the more we can continuously change, the better we will do.”
After swapping out nearly all outside vendors for Sodexo venues in the most recent overhaul, the University reported a 25 percent drop in sales last fall that then flatlined early this semester. University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard said Sodexo would not release information about its total sales this academic year, citing a policy change since The Hatchet last reported the numbers in February. She did not explain why the policy changed.
University officials lauded Sodexo for an 11 percent increase in student satisfaction with J Street in late January, but refused to provide past approval ratings – making it impossible to discern the impact of the summer overhaul.
GW Campus Dining formed five focus groups this month to strengthen outreach to students, looking to draw in upperclassmen that might overlook the menu options added last fall. The dozen-member focus groups met for the first time last week and will continue to identify solutions for problem areas, such as food quality and menu options, until the end of May.
When asked how this effort would produce better results than past endeavors that created larger changes but could not boost J Street’s image, Yokeley did not answer the question, instead saying this year’s new marketing plan is “standard procedure” for Sodexo.
He added that he is “not aware of any major changes in food set.”
The focus groups include students from the Student Association, the Marvin Center Governing Board and house staff. Working with students who are well known on campus will help enhance the dining center’s reputation and could create a potential partnership with student groups, Yokeley said.
“We all have a favorite restaurant, but if we ate there seven days a week, it wouldn’t be our favorite. We’re trying to keep our customers interested in what we’re doing so they keep coming back,” Yokeley said.
The marketing plan relies on creating partnerships between campus dining and major student organizations, helping the University advertise to students through organizations’ listservs and group leadership and creating “communication avenues to students through their organizations,” Yokeley said.
Campus dining underwent a landmark change in 2006, ditching longtime food vendor Aramark for Sodexo, which added multiple new venues including Quiznos and Chick-fil-A. J Street’s massive overhaul last summer again welcomed new vendors.
Chair of the Student Dining Board Ben Leighton, who has worked with the campus dining office this year to coordinate programming, said the marketing campaign could help defy negative stereotypes about Sodexo’s food – a perennial student complaint.
“People have written it off. It’s about opening peoples’ minds to eating at J Street,” Leighton said, adding that some upperclassmen do not realize there are healthier and fresher eating options at the venue since last summer’s revamp.
Students will also see more themed programming during the year, which Yokeley said has increased sales and is “more memorable for our customers.”  The plans will expand events like last fall’s crab boil, the annual Thanksgiving meal before break and Freshman Feast earlier this month.
The campus dining team will step up its use of visuals online, adding more photos of food options on existing social media outlets like Twitter and Facebook, in addition to e-mail newsletters.
“We have heard back from students and staff that students often don’t know about programs, events and daily information that they might find relevant,” Yokeley said.

Pushpa Basnet could not get the image of a young girl smiling, reaching out to her from behind a jail cell’s bars out of her mind.
The then-21-year-old saw the smiling child during a visit to a Nepalese jail while studying for her bachelor’s degree in social work. Nepalese law forces parents who face incarceration to choose between bringing their children along to prison or leaving them with a guardian.
“When I came back, I was thinking about her. It was in my mind,” Basnet said. “I wanted to help her.”
She soon founded the Early Childhood Development Center in 2005 in Kathmandu, Nepal to give children whose parents are incarcerated a place to avoid a life behind bars themselves. Basnet’s humanitarian work was recognized by CNN, which awarded her the title of CNN Hero in March.
Basnet will visit GW for a banquet May 1, held in her honor by the student organization Babies Behind Bars to commemorate her win.
As part of the planned festivities, GW students will sing the national anthem while members of the Nepali community will be sing theirs. GW Bhangra will also perform. Basnet will also give a presentation about her humanitarian work, which will be followed by the presentation of the CNN Hero video made in her honor. The $20 tickets sold for the celebration banquet will help fundraise for Basnet’s work in Nepal.
“Our first goal and purpose is of course, helping better the lives of children in Nepal by supporting the Early Childhood Center of Kathmandu,” Michael Franzi, chairman of the event planning committee said. “Not only does BBB help a great cause on the international level, making the world a smaller place, it also has given a group of mostly freshman college students the experience of working in a quasi-nonprofit organization, a status which we plan to file for this summer.”
In Nepal, Basnet wakes up at 5:30 a.m. with four staffers to care for more than more than 40 children whose parents are locked up.
“I don’t want them to suffer like their parents so that tomorrow they will have a better life,” Basnet said.
CNN heroes are nominated by an admirer during a rolling application process accessible on the media outlet’s website. In 2011 there were 24 heroes selected.
Basnet was selected as the fifth hero in 2012 in the second week of March. CNN created a video about her mission and center in Nepal and wrote an accompanying article.
Basnet said she has seen big changes in her children at an international and local level.
“The most important thing, more than me, is that the concept of the people has changed,” Basnet said, adding that as her children walk to school people recognize that they are from the center and ask “Oh, you are from CNN Heroes?”
Children at the center in Kathmandu make their beds, get ready and eat lunch by 9 a.m. – before their 11 a.m. dance classes – and spend afternoons hiking or playing outside, Basnet said, adding that her goal is to give children a chance to craft their lives outside of their parents’ constraints.
Babies Behind Bars, a student organization which she founded to raise money and support Basnet’s work in Nepal, president freshman Sarah Freeman-Woolpert said she volunteered with Basnet’s organization for six weeks during her gap year in 2010, when she traveled to Nepal. She called the CNN Hero a “child at heart.”
“I think that she does so well with the kids because she just has so much fun doing those things. She likes playing games with them and singing songs with them and making crafts,” Freeman-Woolpert said.
Freeman-Woolpert became the U.S. ambassador for the Early Childhood Development Center, trying to raise awareness for the center and it’s work, a role she continued at the University in fall 2011 by founding GW’s chapter of Babies Behind Bars.
She created the student organization as a way to support Basnet by selling handicrafts created by mothers imprisoned in Nepal and to raise awareness on campus in hopes of forging support and involvement with other organizations.
Basnet said earning the award was a “really big honor,” adding that it has given her children a sense of pride in the community and added a drive to her mission.
“I want to fulfill their dreams,” Basnet said.
