You have drunk too much. It happens. But what happens next doesn’t have to. Your friends casually suggest you “pull trig” — self-induce vomiting — to avoid a hangover. After mulling it over in your head for a while, you decide to. But the next morning, your hangover is still there, and you have, without realizing it, normalized an eating disorder tendency.
National Eating Disorder Awareness Week passed just more than a week ago, but we should not only spend a few days educating ourselves on the issue – especially as college-aged students. The difficult transition from a largely dependent life to independent life laced with an incredibly persistent diet culture, harmful party culture and toxic academic culture is a breeding ground for eating disorder symptoms that cannot go unnoticed. We must continue to analyze these harmful personal and cultural tendencies that happen right on campus and work to quash them.
For one, binge drinking is universally on the rise despite parties and large gatherings being paused because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The issue is incredibly prevalent in colleges – we tend to adopt a “work hard play hard” mentality that everyone wants to follow. But binge drinking can lead to the adoption of “drunkorexia” – eating too little to compensate for the excessive drinking that will ensue. People more likely to binge drink have a higher tendency to binge eat, causing negative gastrointestinal, dermatological and endocrine effects. We don’t need to “rally” or be able to shotgun 10 beers – on an empty stomach or in general – to fit in in college or even have fun.
Let’s also talk about the “freshman 15,” because who cares if we lose or gain weight in college. First of all, the freshman 15 is fake. Not only is it made up to tack on another student stressor, but it allows for a running fatphobic joke. How frequently have you heard someone drop a comment about weight gain to validate a disordered eating habit? We develop new stressors and should not head into college in fear that our late-night french fries will cause us to gain weight. The mentality, which disproportionately affects female students, can lead to poor body image as well as restrictive eating practices. In order to maintain a healthy relationship with food and our bodies, we must empathize with stressed out students, while making healthy coping habits more mainstream. Instead of villainizing weight gain, associate going out to dinner with friends as a memory, not a calorie count. It is OK to eat fries at midnight, I promise.
At the end of the day, we just need to care about what we say and do when we talk about eating habits. Promoting binge drinking, encouraging forcibly throwing up after parties or criticizing weight gain in college is harmful. Especially during the pandemic, when students already experience more depression and anxiety than a typical year, we cannot normalize talking about disordered eating habits like they’re the college standard.
While it is important to avoid falling into these culturally perpetuated bad habits for your own health and safety, monitoring your relationship with party culture and stress will dramatically benefit the people around you. If you are one to casually drop how little you had eaten in a day, calories burned, jean sizes or assumptions about others based on their bodies, notice that and work to eliminate it from your vocabulary to protect your friends and strangers from potential triggers. Consider reducing your alcohol intake to reduce the urge of pulling trig. Eat with friends and family to ensure that you are not only taking a break from school but also feeding yourself food that nourishes your body and mind.

Fans of La Bodega Bakery stranded at home need not worry – the restaurant offers nationwide shipping for some of its classic desserts.
For eclectic pastries inspired by flavors across the globe, head to La Bodega Bakery.
Located at 1346 T St. NW, the bakery is housed inside of the restaurant Compass Rose. At the bakery, the restaurant’s executive pastry chef Paola Velez – who co-founded Bakers Against Racism – offers a variety of pastries for customers to pre-order and pick up on Saturdays, along with a rotating pastry case for walk-ins.
If you’re not in the District right now, La Bodega Bakery offers nationwide shipping for some of its classic desserts, like a whole golden rum cake ($45) or a variety pack of “thick’em” cookies ($20) in flavors like chocolate chip and cranberry raspberry white chocolate.
Right now, the bakery’s storefront location is baking up an assortment of desserts ranging from dulce de leche donuts ($5) topped with a toasted white chocolate glaze and plantain chips to Milo buns ($10), a swirly pastry filled with malted chocolate powder and doused in milk chocolate glaze.
Along with pastries, La Bodega Bakery also serves bodega-style breakfast sandwiches on homemade brioche buns, like the Lucky #7 ($7.77) with scrambled eggs, cheese and smoked bacon and the glazed guava bacon, egg and cheese ($8.88).
Customers can also order a range of cocktails, including the Chamoy Sunrise ($14) with mezcal, apricot, chili and orange juice or the Cafe & Coquito ($14) made with coffee and the classic Puerto Rican creamy, coconut and rum beverage.
To ensure I could get the baked goods I wanted before trekking to the bakery, I opted to pre-order for a mid-morning Saturday pick up, which included a $3 packing fee and $1 order fee.
Even through my mask, I could smell sugar, butter and yeast drift through the storefront when I walked in. The pickup process was seamless, and each of my pastries were expertly packed and remained intact during my Metro trip home.
Out of my selection of pastries, my favorite was La Bodega Bakery’s plantain buns ($10), which are a staple of the bakery’s menu.
The massive sticky bun is stuffed with a mixture of plantains and pecans. Grains of paradise, a spice indigenous to the west coast of Africa, finished off the bun as a glaze.
Each bite was packed with sweetness and spice, and the crunchy bits of pecan paired well with the saccharine and gooey plantain filling. The dough of the sticky bun itself remained soft and pillowy on the inside, but it was still sturdy enough to hold the bun’s generous amount of filling.
The $10 price point is also well warranted – the plantain buns are made in limited quantities, and they’re easily shareable among two or three people.
For pastries you can’t find anywhere else in the District, a Saturday trip to La Bodega Bakery is your best bet.

The Post reported that Metro General Manager Paul Wiedefeld remained quiet about the effects of the third relief package during a Monday meeting with the Prince George’s County Council.
The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority could stave off the remainder of its expected budget cuts during the COVID-19 pandemic after receiving an additional relief package, The Washington Post reported Monday.
Congress passed a third relief package amid the pandemic Wednesday, and the D.C. area is set to receive $1.4 billion for public transit agencies, the majority of which is expected to go to WMATA, The Post reported. WMATA spokesperson Ian Janetta told The Post that Metro officials are “encouraged” by the package, as officials hope to wipe out service cuts currently tabled until 2022.
WMATA officials proposed a devastating lineup of service cuts late last year for fiscal year 2022 – which starts this July – with plans to eliminate weekend service, shut down 19 stations and terminate nearly half of all bus lines to offset a massive budget shortfall caused by low ridership. Following the passage of the second COVID-19 relief package in December, agency officials delayed the cuts until the start of the 2022 calendar year after receiving $610 million in federal funding.
The Post reported that Metro General Manager Paul Wiedefeld remained quiet about the effects of the third relief package during a Monday meeting with the Prince George’s County Council.
“We don’t know exactly what that means yet,” Wiedefeld said. “As soon as we know more, we will be communicating that.”
The report states that Jeff Davis, a senior fellow at the nonprofit Eno Center for Transportation, found that the recent package would provide the 15 largest transit agencies in the United States, which includes WMATA, with enough funding to account for half their annual budgets.

Alumnus Michael Regan was confirmed by the U.S. Senate Wednesday as the next administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
Regan, who was confirmed in a 66-34 vote, earned a master’s degree in public administration with a specialization in federal policy, politics and administration from the Trachtenberg School of Public Policy and Public Administration in 2005. President Joe Biden nominated Regan in December as the first Black man to lead the EPA in its 50-year history.
“We will be driven by our convictions that every person in our great country has the right to clean air, clean water and a healthier life, no matter how much money they have in their pockets, the color of their skin or the community that they live in,” Regan said at his nomination announcement.
Before his nomination, Regan served as secretary of North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality, where he received national recognition for his coordinated approach to regulation and enforcement.
Regan also holds a Bachelor of Science in earth and environmental science from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical University. Regan worked for the EPA as an intern and went on to work at the agency for nine years in various offices and roles.
“I knew I wanted to find a way to serve,” Regan said at his Senate confirmation hearing. “That led to my first summer internship at EPA. I spent nearly 10 years at EPA under presidents of both parties. It is an honor of a lifetime to be invited back.”
Regan has served as both an environmental protection specialist for the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards and a special assistant for the director of radiation and indoor air, according to his LinkedIn profile.
Regan said as EPA administrator he would address ongoing issues like climate change and disproportionate effects on marginalized communities with a “sense of urgency.”

Golaszewski, the elections director, said roughly 44 percent of voters turned out on election day Feb. 23 and 40 percent voted during the runoff the next day, respectively.
The Student Bar Association Senate unanimously ratified the group’s spring election results after a runoff election for the SBA’s top spot at a meeting Tuesday.
Aneta Golaszewski, the SBA’s director of elections, announced that second-year law student Jordan Michel was elected SBA president and SBA Senate Secretary Yun-Da Tsai was elected executive vice president for the upcoming term. Senators also unanimously passed a resolution calling on GW Law officials to lobby against a D.C. Bar Association action requiring law students pursuing a master of laws degree to take 12 in-person credit hours despite the COVID-19 pandemic suspending most in-person classes.
Golaszewski, the elections director, said roughly 44 percent of voters turned out on election day Feb. 23 and 40 percent voted during the runoff the next day, respectively.
“It was a really great campaign season,” she said.
Michel, the SBA president-elect, defeated second-year law student Tyrus Jackson in the runoff, with 41 percent of the vote over Jackson’s 31 percent. Tsai, the executive vice president-elect, received 61 percent of the vote in the original election, not requiring a runoff.
The senate also unanimously passed a resolution calling on law school officials to condemn a D.C. Bar Association vote only allowing LL.M. students to take 14 of their 26 credits virtually during the pandemic to be permitted to take the bar exam.
The resolution, introduced by SBA Sen. Jordan Jones, requests that administrators provide a “unified condemnation” of the bar association’s action and recognize the “detrimental effect” it will have particularly on international students. Jones said the SBA is trying to unify D.C.-based law schools to protest and demand the repeal of the amendment.
“We’re trying to make it more of a joint effort,” she said. “The more people that are aware of it and the more people are filing petitions and comments and appeals, the better.”
Jones said international attorneys pursuing their LL.M. degrees are required to take 26 credit hours at an American Bar Association-approved law school. She said the recent measure is a “disqualification” for all students pursuing their LL.M. degree because it forces them to take classes in person while they mostly remain unavailable.
“We’ve been in contact with a lot of people at this point,” she said. “We are just trying to fight as hard as we can.”

SA Sen. Cordelia Scales, SEAS-U and the sponsor of The Code of Academic Integrity Approval Act, said the updates clarify procedures in handling academic integrity violations “in certain situations.”
The Student Association Senate unanimously approved legislation to support updating language in the Code of Academic Integrity at a meeting Monday.
Updates to the code include allowing certain violations to not remain on a student’s transcript after graduation and requesting “a restorative and educational approach” be taken for “low-level” violations. Senators also approved two co-sponsorship requests amounting in total to more than $40,000 and confirmed three new members to the senate.
The senate unanimously approved a resolution in favor of updating the procedures of the Code of Academic Integrity, like supporting a review of the code every five years. SA Sen. Cordelia Scales, SEAS-U and the sponsor of The Code of Academic Integrity Approval Act, said the updates clarify procedures in handling academic integrity violations “in certain situations.”
She added that members of the Faculty Senate have reviewed the changes, and the changes will go into effect July 1 if officials approve it “smoothly.” The faculty body is set to vote on the changes at a meeting on Friday.
Christy Anthony, the director of the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities, said at the meeting that the updates include alterations that adjust consequences based on the significance of an assignment where a violation occurred. She said violations on smaller assignments would be treated less harshly than for larger assignments under the updated guidelines.
“We have added language to say that the significance of the assignment in question can be a factor in sanctioning so presumably cheating on a homework set is less serious than cheating on a final exam,” Anthony said.
Senators also approved a co-sponsorship request to WRGW for nearly $30,000 to help the organization purchase new equipment, update software and computers and soundproof the group’s studio located in the Marvin Center.
Pooji Jonnavithula, WRGW’s general manager, said budget allocations from the SA have decreased “significantly” since 2016 and said the funds given to the organization last fall, roughly $3,000, cannot sustain the group as their ongoing expenses alone are more than $8,000.
She said WRGW leaders spoke with officials from the Division for Student Affairs, the Office of General Counsel and Facilities Planning, Construction and Management but said all administrators told them “you are on your own.” She said the station will shut down within five years if they do not receive funding for the “critical renovations” because their current equipment is not enough to support the organization.
“We do not have the funds in our revenue account to do this on our own,” she said. “We not only will we not be able to broadcast during the pandemic and during the virtual space, but when we go back in person, we will not be able to function in the same way that we used to or just at all.”
Members of the organization had originally presented their almost $30,000 request to the SA finance committee, which opted out of allocating funds to go toward “in-person” needs, like soundproofing the studio, because students are still taking classes virtually.
But after members presented their case to the senate requesting a co-sponsorship fund of about $15,000, the senate voted overwhelmingly to allocate the total, original amount.
SA Sen. Thomas Falcigno, CPS-G, said the idea of student organizations coming to the SA to address issues like space maintenance or housing issues – as did the Beta Theta Phi fraternity when requesting $30,000 to cover University housing costs – is “absolutely ridiculous” because the University should cover those expenses.
“Every time we’re forced in these situations where if we don’t give the money then the org is going to go under or something’s going to be bad and it’s the University doing this to us and it’s absolutely ridiculous and I’m so tired of being used as pawns by them,” Falcigno said.
Senators also approved a $12,500 co-sponsorship request to the GW South Asian Society to fund a virtual charity event. Members of the organization said the occasion is part of a Multicultural Student Services Center event, which highlights the people and traditions of South Asian communities on campus.
Aarshi Kibria, the president of the South Asian Society, said the fundraising event will support the DC Mutual Aid Network, which provides resources and funding to members of the D.C. community, and the Asian Pacific Islander Domestic Violence Resource Project, which supports Asian and Pacific Islander victims of domestic assault or violence in the D.C. area.
Junior Viarun Vijay, the financial officer for the group, said the event in total will cost $13,700, more than 90 percent of which will be allocated for the organization’s virtual performer – Raveena – a “headliner for the intersectional R&B style of music.”
“We wanted to highlight her given our theme of connectivity that’s been running through this month and her leaning toward progressive movements as well as the fact that she was able to build a following online is really important for us to highlight our theme and the charities that we’re looking to support,” said senior Vishal Nyayapathi, another member of the organization.
Senators also reviewed language and provisions that will be included in the body’s updated constitution, like increasing the number of committees in the senate from four to nine and changing the name of SA caucuses to “resource groups.” The senate will vote on the proposed changes at the next meeting.
Senators also confirmed junior Patrick Burland and sophomore Athena Atsides-Del Valle to fill vacant undergraduate-at-large seats and Negus Assefa, a second-year graduate student in the Elliott School of International Affairs, to a graduate-at-large seat.

Officials also eased COVID-19 restrictions more than two months into the fall semester with 500 campus residents, shifting from the no-guest policy to permitting one guest per student.
Students on campus can now invite one guest from their residence hall into their room, following a rollback of campus COVID-19 restrictions.
In an email sent to on-campus students Friday, Stewart Robinette and Seth Weinshel, the assistant deans of students for Campus Living and Residential Education, said students can invite one guest to their room between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. with overnight stays prohibited. The policy change comes after officials have enforced a no-guest policy since the start of the semester while about 1,500 students live in campus residence halls.
“We have confidence in our residents’ ongoing commitment to the health of our campus as we implement this revised guest policy for, hopefully, the rest of this semester,” the email states.
Officials also eased COVID-19 restrictions more than two months into the fall semester with 500 campus residents, shifting from the no-guest policy to permitting one guest per student. The email states the University still restricts guests from any outside buildings, including other residence halls, off-campus sites or athlete affinity housing, and guests must continue abiding by social distancing guidelines in each room.
“The host resident is responsible for their guest’s behavior when their guest is in their unit,” the email reads. “A violation of the guest policy may result in the resident and the guest each receiving similar sanctions.”
The email states student-athletes who live in an affinity space must maintain their “testing bubble,” only gathering with their teammates within COVID-19 guidelines. Officials said the policy was subject to change based on shifts in COVID-19 cases, transmission rates “and/or other public health or behavioral assessments” on campus or across D.C.
“Thank you for your patience and flexibility in adapting to decisions made to keep our community healthy and safe during this unprecedented time,” the email states. “Any adjustments to the guest policy will be communicated to building residents by email and building notices. Please continue to read all email updates and observe all posted notices to maintain the health and safety of our residential community.”

President Joe Biden has named a School of Medicine and Health Sciences doctor to be his physician, officials announced last week.
Kevin O’Connor, an associate professor of medicine and of health, human function and rehabilitation sciences, has been serving as Biden’s personal doctor since Inauguration Day in January, according to a University release. The release states O’Connor, who first served as Biden’s physician during his vice presidency, is overseeing the White House’s medical unit.
“When we are on a movement, we work hand-in-glove with the United States Secret Service for what’s called executive protective medicine, providing emergency medical planning and coverage for all of the president’s trips,” O’Connor said in the release. “That’s the part that makes it unique and different from the responsibilities of a typical primary care physician. That’s what makes it a tactical job.”
The release states that O’Connor served in the U.S. Army for 22 years before becoming a part of the White House team. O’Connor continued to serve as the Biden family physician after Biden’s term as vice president ended.
O’Connor is remaining a faculty member within the medical school during Biden’s administration because of a federal regulation allowing federal government employees to maintain simultaneous positions in higher education and the government, the release states.
This post has been updated to clarify the following:
This story has been updated to clarify that O’Connor has been serving as the president’s personal doctor since Jan. 20.
