GW opened the game aggressively, playing at a high tempo through the first three minutes.
Women’s soccer defeated Duquesne 2-1 at the Mount Vernon soccer field in the last game of the season Sunday, where the GW team bid goodbye to seven senior players.
The Colonials (7-5-6) outlasted the Dukes (6-6-3) with a combination of tactical offensive pushes at the top of the zone and a heightened focus on defense. With the win, the team shifted up to 11th place in the Atlantic 10, but failed to qualify for the A-10 Championship tournament for the third consecutive season.
Head Coach Michelle Demko said the team hoped to honor the senior class with a win in its final match against a competitive opponent. She said the win showcased how much the team cares about and celebrates its senior players.
“I think in terms of us having the ability to show up, it’s an emotional day for the seniors, but to kind of withstand those emotions and put those aside and still come out and complete the task at hand,” Demko said in a post-game interview.
GW opened the game aggressively, playing at a high tempo through the first three minutes. But after a shot in the third minute by senior forward Isabella Buck missed high, Duquesne was able to clear the ball and begin their first offensive set of the game.
After a lengthy back and forth in which both teams pushed the ball upfield to take shots on goal, the first score came by way of Duquesne midfielder Mackenzie Muir in the 33rd minute. A shot on goal hit the top of the crossbar and bounced straight down, drawing freshman goalkeeper Grace Crowe out of position and leaving Muir open to score off the rebound, putting the Dukes on top 1-0.
The Colonials pushed upfield seven minutes later, setting up midfielder Abby Mansoor for a shot that Duquesne’s sophomore goalkeeper Maddy Neundorfer stopped. Midfielder Isabelle Eskay recovered possession for the Colonials, crossing it from the left side of the field to midfielder Sammy Neyman in the box.
“​​We talked about coming out and really making sure that we continue to press the game and press it in their final third and really try to go after a goal, within the first 15 minutes if we could,” Demko said. “I thought that they really stuck to the game plan well, and the changes that we made brought energy and they brought confidence.”
While Neyman attempted to corral the ball after it bounced off of the crossbar, Duquesne goalkeeper Maddy Nuendorfer clipped Newman’s legs from behind, sending her falling to the ground and affording her a penalty kick.
Neyman’s penalty kick careened into the top left corner of the net, just past a diving Nuendorfer, giving GW the goal and knotting the game up at 1-1.
In the second half, Duquesne had possession for the majority of the 45 minutes but was unable to capitalize on any of its five shot attempts. In the 56th minute, Duquesne had two opportunities to score, but GW sophomore goalkeeper Ainsley Lumpe, who checked into the game at the start of the second half, made a diving stop, and a follow-up shot by sophomore forward Emma Bundy missed wide to the left of the goal.
Two minutes later, Duquesne senior defender Kayla Winicki fired another shot that hit the top of the crossbar and bounced directly down, but she was unable to score off the rebound.
GW scored the game-winning goal in the 65th minute after taking possession off of a Duquesne throw-in. The Colonials pushed the ball upfield and junior midfielder Elizabeth Cruz lined up a shot from just outside the box.
It missed right, ricocheting off of the post and toward freshman midfielder Aoi Kataoka, who sent a cross pass back to Cruz in the middle, who lined up a shot and buried it into the left side of the net.
For the rest of the game, the Colonials abandoned any substantial offensive push and focused most of their energy on defense by adjusting to tighten their coverage of the zone. They allowed Duquesne to make multiple drives upfield, but consistent stops both on the sides and in the box coupled with timely saves by Lumpe allowed GW to hold on.
The Colonials goalkeepers notched a total of three saves, with Crowe notching one save and Lumpe two, good for a combined .750 save percentage.
“It was the last game of my career, so I just wanted to win,” Neyman said. “I didn’t care if I played good or bad. It was more about our class, so tight-knit all seven of us. So it’s kind of just more about winning and getting momentum from winning a game that we knew we could.”

After GW’s acceptance rate jumped by six points to 49 percent last school year, higher education experts voiced concerns that the change would hurt the University’s academic standing with prospective students. They theorized that the higher rate would make the University appear less competitive and therefore deter students from applying in the first place.
But in a firm rejection of the outside criticism, officials have asserted that GW’s acceptance rate had no major effect on the last applicant pool. The higher education industry’s obsession with the image of exclusivity for the sake of yielding more applicants is shortsighted and misinterpreted the actual drivers of student interest in the University. Officials should continue accepting more applicants to shift their focus to maximizing academic merit instead of potentially intimidating exceptional students from giving GW a shot.
The idea of rejection from a prestigious and exclusive university is nothing short of soul crushing. The last thing students want after working to boost their GPA and stockpile academic credits through their high school years is to be told they’re not good enough. Because of the stress-inducing college application process, some students might hold back from applying to the universities that minimize their acceptance rate. These low percentages not only deter qualified applicants but also narrow opportunities for the incoming class of college students. These repercussions have already taken effect – undergraduate enrollment across the United States dropped by 1.1 percent since last fall, the third straight year with a decrease in that category.
When universities tout their exclusivity, students lose out. They may have an intense drive for academic success, professional expansion and intellectualism, but an overly competitive admissions process can push away prospective students who would otherwise be an excellent fit for these institutions. Students of all backgrounds are hungry for the resources that GW has to offer, like its location, research capabilities and connections to both private and public institutions with immense power. Why turn them away?
Jay Goff, the vice provost for enrollment and success, and Ben Toll, the dean for undergraduate admissions, argue the higher acceptance rate will help enrich and diversify the University’s student body for the future. By accepting more students, they said GW will attract more diverse classes among future generations and continue to grow the quality and academic output of those who enroll. Instead of attempting to come off as overly prestigious, GW could flip the script and become a home to more of the scholars whom it intends to foster.
With a slightly higher acceptance rate, GW signals that it appreciates its students as people, not just numbers on a stat sheet. If officials truly saw applicants as human beings, a higher acceptance rate expands a wider net of qualified students who can contribute to GW’s community through creativity and academic prowess. GW could attract more merited students without being just another selective university. A more inclusive campus identity that welcomes a broader coalition of academics who can still engage in rigorous coursework and professional connections unlike any other institution is the image worth promoting.
Balancing resources for the entire student population, like campus housing, dining options and Counseling and Psychological Services should remain a top priority when officials are considering accepting more students. There are obvious limitations to expanding this enrollment strategy, and in the face of economic struggles, it would be reckless to admit more students than we can sustain and educate in D.C. But GW has the chance to break the mold that the higher education industry has created for itself – one that has made college a commodity, and students the consumers.
GW can give more students with brilliant minds a chance to engage with a civically active student body, connections to private and public institutions that make a difference in our world and academically challenging courses that inform their perspectives of the world in a meaningful way. By doing so, we not only enhance the student experience for those who have already chosen GW, but we enhance our image with more to offer than just prestige to those who have yet to choose Foggy Bottom as their college destination.

John King, an anchor and the chief national correspondent at CNN, said Latino voters could significantly impact results in swing states with tight races.
A panel of CNN journalists discussed next month’s midterm elections at the Jack Morton Auditorium last Wednesday.
The event was the second Citizen by CNN event held this semester in partnership with GW and journalists discussed midterm election topics like Hispanic voters and their influence, the consequences of the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade and Donald Trump’s effect on the midterms. John King, an anchor and the chief national correspondent at CNN, led a conversation about the Nov. 8 elections with CNN colleagues Nia-Malika Henderson, Abby Phillip and Rachel Smolkin.
The panelists talked about the increasing importance of candidates targeting Latino voters. Over the past decade, the population of Latinos in the United States grew by 23 percent to about 62.1 million people and continues to rise.
King said Latino voters could significantly impact results in swing states with tight races. States like Nevada, Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania are projected to have tightly contested Senate races this November that will decide which party gains control of the chamber in 2023.
“In Nevada, it’s the big constituency, especially in Clark County,” King said. “In other places, even when it’s only by three or four percent of the vote, if it’s a 50-50 contest, that’s enough.”
Henderson, a senior political analyst at CNN, said she felt the Democratic Party has overlooked Latino voters. Henderson said that Democrats often mistake how much they believe immigration as an issue matters to Latino voters.
“I think Democrats in some ways have taken Latinos for granted, in assuming that some of Donald Trump’s rhetoric would draw them to Democrats, some of his rhetoric around immigration,” Henderson said.
The group also discussed the effects of the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade in June on voter turnout and election results. The panelists also discussed the ways in which political campaigns are using the issue to drive turnout as Democrats focus on abortion in advertisements and speeches.
Rachel Smolkin, the senior vice president of global news for CNN Digital Worldwide, said the big motivators for voters continue to evolve through the election cycle. Smolkin said it is hard to predict what influence abortion will have in the midterms.
“This race has been so volatile this year,” Smolkin said. “It looked like abortion rights would be the big driver, then it looked like the economy and inflation would be the big driver and now maybe it’s crime.”
Abby Phillip, a CNN anchor and senior political correspondent, said Democrats are campaigning too much on abortion. Phillip said she thinks abortion is still important to voters, but not important enough to be the number one topic for Democrats to focus messaging on.
“It’s not going to be the issue that for most voters is going to decide how they cast their ballot,” Phillip said. “They have to shore up their economic messaging and cannot rely on abortion.”
The panelists talked about former President Donald Trump’s influence in the race, especially as he hints toward another presidential run in 2024.
Nia-Malika Henderson said Trump has a hand in the decisions regarding what Republicans are actually on the ballot.
The panel also spoke about the importance of voting to the attendees. They said young people are especially needed in the election, which is projected to be close.
“We need you and we need your fresh ideas, we need your interest in technology,” King said. “You’re the generation that is just naturally so much more tolerant and open minded than the generations that came before you.”

Shushan Gabrielyan, the co-president of the Armenian Law Students Association, said members of the Armenian community felt “disheartened” by the lack of knowledge and action regarding the recent conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia.
The Student Bar Association Senate Tuesday unanimously passed a resolution calling on GW Law to suspend all school activities associated with the Republic of Azerbaijan.
The resolution calls on the law school to reconsider academic curriculums that partner with Azerbaijan and may exclude Armenians based on ethnicity, like the Manfred Lachs Moot Court Competition, which is holding its finals in Baku, Azerbaijan. The resolution also calls on GW Law to devote adequate resources to the exploration of xenophobia and violence toward Armenian populations within the context of international law.
Shushan Gabrielyan, the co-president of the Armenian Law Students Association, said members of the Armenian community felt “disheartened” by the lack of international knowledge and action regarding the recent territorial conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia.
“Examples of this are omnipresent and exemplified by our school sponsorship and tacit endorsement of academic programs that further normalize and amplify the marginalization of our youth,” she said. “Today, we ask you to stand in solidarity with the Armenian community at George Washington University by condemning Azerbaijan’s unprovoked attack on Armenia and reconsidering academic programs and external competitions that exclude students on the basis of their race.”
The resolution references a program through the Graduate School of Education and Human Development in partnership with the Azerbaijan State Pedagogical University, and it says graduate programs within the graduate division of the Elliott School of International Affairs “sponsor academic programs in the Azerbaijan.”
The senate also unanimously granted the Student Animal Legal Defense Fund $1,549 to finance their attendance to the Animal Law Conference, which will be held Nov. 4-6 in Portland, Oregon, where the student organization will be receiving the national organization’s Chapter of the Year Award for their advocacy last year.
Laura Mezzanotte, the organization’s president, said that the conference was an “important networking opportunity” to secure influential guest speakers for the following year.
“This is a great publicity moment for us,” she said. “It’s a great publicity moment for GW because they’re trying to expand this program.”
SBA Sen. Charles Schmidt said the senate should fund requests “for students to do enriching events” that reap “profound benefits.”
“I’m proud of us for passing the bill to give money to the Student Animal Legal Defense Fund to attend their conference,” he said.
The SBA Senate unanimously confirmed Natalie Smith and Johann Choo as associate judges of the SBA Supreme Court. The court now has five associate judges and a chief judge.
The senate unanimously authorized $99.08 to cover costs associated with the International Refugee Assistance Project’s general body meeting.
The SBA Senate rejected legislation that would have granted $100 to the SBA Supreme Court to purchase judge’s robes. Eight senators voted in favor of the funding, and 12 senators voted in opposition.
SBA Sen. John Tuley, the chair of the finance committee who brought the request to the full senate, said he voted against the request because he thought it did not justify spending students’ money.
“The way I put it in debate was that if a student came to me at the end of the year and asked ‘What did we spend money on?’ and I said ‘We spent it on robes for the judicial branch,’ I don’t know that they would be particularly happy with that decision,” he said.
SBA President Nicole Karem said historically, the SBA Supreme Court has not been viewed as a “co-equal” branch of the SBA. She did not speak in favor or against the bill, deferring to the senate.
“What I will say is don’t let the fact that they haven’t been given money as part of the beginning of the year allocation color your opinion,” she said. “Because I think they’ve been a branch that’s been overlooked in the past.”
SBA Supreme Court Chief Judge Deja Williams said in her three years on the court, it has not weighed in on any cases, but the lack of cases in the first year may have been due to the pandemic.
SBA Sen. Raisa Shah announced on behalf of the student life committee that the SBA has placed menstrual products in bathrooms on the first floor of Lerner Hall in the law school as part of a pilot program. She said the baskets have been placed alongside signs asking people to take only what they need.
Shah said the committee’s “ultimate goal” is to place menstrual products in six bathrooms in law school buildings and every bathroom in the Law Learning Center. She said she is in contact with a graduate student Student Association senator who worked on installing menstrual product dispensers on the main campus.
The next SBA Senate meeting will be held on Nov. 8 at 9:15 p.m at the Law Learning Center.

At least eight fire trucks responded to the emergency after in-unit sprinklers extinguished the fire. 
In-unit sprinklers extinguished a kitchen fire on the eighth floor of the Residences on the Avenue apartment complex Tuesday.
Sprinkler systems at the Avenue apartment complex on the 2200 block of I Street, a popular off-campus housing location for students, extinguished a “small kitchen fire” in an East Tower 29-tier apartment, according to an email to residents, which was obtained by The Hatchet. Jennifer Donelan, the director of communications for D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services, said the fire was extinguished prior to their arrival on the scene.
“Residents in the below and surrounding apartments: There will be water in your apartment and we have flood disaster relief teams on route to begin mediation,” the email reads.
At least eight fire trucks responded to the emergency, and responders reached the scene at about 4:11 p.m. Tuesday, according to a FEMS tweet.
“No injuries reported,” the post reads. “Sprinklers save lives and property.”

Bracey said subgroups of the Diversity Program Review Team will discuss the findings of the survey with “advisory councils” and other campus stakeholders early next semester.
Officials plan to release the results of a University-wide survey of GW’s diversity, equity and inclusion climate this academic year, Provost Chris Bracey said at the annual Faculty Assembly Monday.
Bracey told the faculty at the meeting, which took place in a hybrid format at the Jack Morton Auditorium and via Webex, that reports on the survey results will be available for “leadership review” in November. The Diversity Program Review Team – a 26-member group of administrators, faculty and students – launched the climate survey in April after forming in February to develop recommendations to improve diversity at the University.
“This is a massive undertaking, as you can imagine, so I want to thank everyone for participating in the diversity program review process, as well as everybody who was able to complete the climate survey itself,” Bracey said at the assembly.
Bracey said subgroups of the Diversity Program Review Team will discuss the findings of the survey with “advisory councils” and other campus stakeholders early next semester. He said officials will present the survey results to the wider GW community, and subgroups will work together to draft a final report on the survey’s findings shortly after.
“We want to make sure that we’re performing a thorough analysis before we release this information more broadly,” he said.
Bracey said officials in the provost’s office are working to make a “five year budget planning process” and hope to shorten the process of doing so by communicating with academic leaders earlier than usual. He said officials held meetings with deans, associate deans and financial directors from the University’s schools to discuss the budgeting process last week.
“We will continue to have more conversations with the academic and nonacademic divisions as the budgeting process unfolds,” he said.
Bracey said the Board of Trustees’ committee on audit and compliance has expressed “concerns” about the low completion rates of Title IX modules among faculty members. He said officials “strongly encourage” faculty members to complete the modules.
“The high faculty completion rate will be a powerful signal to members of our community that the faculty takes seriously the University’s commitment to the elimination of harassment and the prevention of harassment and that the faculty understand their critical role in protecting our students as designated reporters,” he said.
Bracey added that officials have completed “more than a dozen” academic reviews of programs and departments as part of a process that takes place every seven years, since last September.
“In general, what we’re finding is that our departments are performing well, although some need a few nudges here and a tweak there, all have substantial enrollment that support our overall academic enterprise,” he said.
Sylvia Marotta-Walters, a professor of counseling and a faculty senator, presented a report on the Faculty Senate’s activities and the ongoing search for the next University president on behalf of Jim Tielsch, the senate’s executive committee chair and the vice chair of the Presidential Search Committee, who was absent from the assembly.
Marotta-Walters said the senate’s executive committee met with the Board of Trustees earlier this month as the first of a series of ongoing meetings to promote shared governance between faculty members and trustees. The senate overwhelmingly approved a set of shared governance principles in April to improve collaboration between faculty, administrators and trustees.
Interim University President Mark Wrighton welcomed new faculty members to the University, including more than 90 new faculty in the School of Medicine and Health Sciences. He also celebrated the hiring of new officials over the past 10 months of his tenure.
Officials appointed five officials to new leadership positions within the Office of the Provost in July, and Wrighton announced four more administrative appointments about a week later.
“During this year, in my first 10 months, I’ve been very pleased with the recruitment of a significant number of leaders who are now in place and contributing to the administration of this University,” he said.

“Midnights,” which paid stylistic homage to many of Swift’s previous records, has proven to be her most successful body of work yet – Swift broke the record for most-streamed album in a single day in Spotify history.
When international superstar Taylor Swift announced her 10th studio album “Midnights” in late August, fans were unsure of what to expect given the wide range of her discography, which has blended seamlessly between country, pop and alternative genres.
Coming on the heels of two highly acclaimed albums, “folklore” and “evermore,” fans were divided into two camps – some hoped for a return to pop, while others longed for the stunning lyrics and vivid storytelling Swift achieved while recording alternative music during COVID-19 lockdowns at the Long Pond Studio in New York. With the release of “Midnights” Friday, Swift appeased both groups by detailing 20 sleepless nights throughout various stages of her life on 13 tracks and seven bonus tracks on a “3am Edition,” paying stylistic homage to past records like “Lover,” “reputation” and “folklore.”
“Midnights” has proven to be Swifts’ most successful body of work yet, breaking the record for most-streamed album in a single day in Spotify history with 184.6 million streams.
“Meet me at midnight” are appropriately the first words fans hear at the start of the album’s hyperpop opening track “Lavender Haze” – a line that Swift frequently teased leading up to the album’s release. The track’s synth pop production is reminiscent of songs like “I Think He Knows” on Swift’s most recent pop record, “Lover.” The electric chorus captures the euphoric feeling of being in love, but for Swift, these feelings come with the drawback of public gossip and tabloids. In “Lavender Haze,” she addresses the constant rumors about her alleged engagement to longtime boyfriend Joe Alwyn with the lyrics “All they keep asking me / Is if I’m gonna be your bride / The only kinda girl they see / Is a one night or a wife.” Despite the constant speculation that follows her relationships, Swift chooses to “stay in that lavender haze.”
The track list continues with “Maroon,” a pop ballad that many quickly associated with the title track of her fourth studio album “Red,” a motif she has used in songwriting to describe love and lust throughout her career. The song employs various shades of red as a lyrical technique – maroon, wine, burgundy, scarlet and ruby – acting as a parallel to songs like “Red” and “All Too Well.” These signs in the track point to the high-profile relationship between Swift and actor Jake Gyllenhaal more than a decade ago. Swift and Gyllenhaal’s relationship made headlines again in late 2021 after Swift re-recorded her “Red” album, which featured a 10-minute version of “All Too Well,” widely speculated to be about Gyllenhaal.
“Anti-Hero,” the highly anticipated third track accompanied by the album’s first music video released the next morning, details Swift’s inner thoughts and self-doubts. Swift called the upbeat-yet-introspective song “a guided tour through all the things I tend to hate about myself,” which include insecurities about her weight and perceptions of her status as a public figure. “I’ll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror / It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero,” she laments as she delves into one of the album’s overarching themes of self-loathing.
Swift continues the self-reflective mood on “You’re On Your Own, Kid,” the latest of her infamous “Track Fives” – like “All Too Well,” “my tears ricochet” and “The Archer” – known among her fans to be some of the most heart-wrenching songs on each of her albums. Fans were quick to recognize that her commencement address at New York University last May featured a hidden Easter egg about the song when Swift told the Class of 2022, “The scary news is you’re on your own now. The cool news is you’re on your own now.” The wistful nostalgia of the song ends on a comforting and uplifting note as Swift sings, “Everything you lose is a step you take / So make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it / You’ve got no reason to be afraid.”
“Midnights” balances themes of self-loathing with revenge, most notably in tracks like “Vigilante Shit” and “Karma,” each widely speculated to be about her public feuds with Kanye West, music producer Scooter Braun and their now ex-wives, Kim Kardashian and Yael Cohen, respectively. Swift muses “Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride / Picture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife / And she looks so pretty / Driving in your Benz / Lately she’s been dressing for revenge,” which many believe to be in direct reference to Kardashian’s severed relationship with West. “Karma,” co-written by actress Zoë Kravitz, provides a more lighthearted take on Swift’s many disputes with figures like West and Braun with the lines “Karma is my boyfriend / Karma is a god / Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend / Karma’s a relaxing thought.”
The standard edition of the “Midnights” album closes out with “Mastermind,” a revealing track diving into Swift’s romantic relationships, creative process and reckoning with her own image in perhaps her most personal track yet. Swift echos sentiments of songs like “mirrorball,” “The Archer” and “Anti-Hero,” confessing that “No one wanted to play with me as a little kid / So I’ve been scheming like a criminal ever since / To make them love me and make it seem effortless.”
The “3am Edition” tracks reveal increasingly personal details about Swift, particularly in songs like “Would’ve, Could’ve, Should’ve.” Swift re-examines a past relationship with a large age gap, which many listeners attribute to musician John Mayer because of her references to being 19. Swift was 19 and Mayer was 32 when the two dated. Lines like “If I was a child, did it matter / If you got to wash your hands” and “Give me back my girlhood / It was mine first” provide a deeper view into Swift’s retrospective feelings about the inappropriate relationship now that she is 32.
The album concludes with “Dear Reader,” an ode to Swift’s longtime fans that often look to her music for advice or support. This track urges her followers to “Never take advice from someone who’s falling apart,” “Find another guiding light,” despite their loyalty to the acclaimed musician.
“Midnights,” like each body of work Swift has released, encompasses a wide range of emotions from heartbreak to regret to self-doubt to revenge. The album differs from her previous nine records with the vast sonic variations in each track that jump between various stages of her life. Swift has created her most personal album yet in “Midnights,” and with the Easter eggs she has left behind pointing to forthcoming albums, it is clear that fans still have more to expect from the magical world she has created.

Ranging from the classic fries at Carvings to unexpected options at Bindaas, campus vendors offer a mix of taste, texture in their selection of fries that will not disappoint if you keep these calculated rankings in mind.
After covering GW’s finances, administrators and academic offerings at The Hatchet for years, I decided to pivot to a far more high-stakes subject – writing about fries.
Four weeks, six orders of fries and many hours of deliberation later, I’ve come up with a highly strategic and calculated ranking of some of the best and worst fry offerings around campus. Ranging from the classic fries at Carvings to unexpected options at Bindaas, here’s a comprehensive list of where to get the best fries around campus:
5. Whole Foods
Sorry Jeff Bezos, but Whole Foods fries ended up dead last for me. I ordered both the plain fries ($4) and the truffle parmesan fries ($5). Of all the fries I tasted as part of this effort, these were the smallest, both in individual fry and overall portion. The plain fries weren’t particularly crispy and didn’t have much going for them in terms of seasoning. And in the face of my high expectations for the truffle parmesan fries, I was disappointed by this otherwise identically plain option, with a truffle taste as its only redeeming quality. A half-hearted sprinkle of parmesan and little to no salt undercut what little flavor these packed.
It’s worth noting that these were the only fries I tried with potato skins left on them, ostensibly to increase their crispiness, but this was not the case – the fries were either soft or dry, nothing in between. I was initially drawn to Whole Foods fries after hearing rave reviews from a friend, but while the fries are a half-decent option with a burger from the hot bar, they’re generally pretty hit or miss. 3.5/10 – this gets the job done, but I wouldn’t recommend.
4. True Burger
With my days of residence hall life behind me, I don’t often find myself frequenting campus dining options, but I took a trip to True Burger in District Hall to try out their fries. The touch screen ordering method caught me off guard in the wake of the long lines at True Burger’s ethically dubious predecessor Chick-fil-A, but in its place I found one of the most affordable fry options on this list. Coming in at $2.99, True Burger’s fries were clearly freshly made and burning hot. These fries were crispy and also slightly peppery, but to quote a friend of mine who joined in on this venture, “One word to describe it: salt.” The overwhelming saltiness also ensured that these fries didn’t age well – once they cooled down, they became soggy and unenjoyable. I’d still give these a 6/10, in a stark contrast to Whole Foods.
3. Carvings
Carvings lies smack in the middle of this list because although they’re a decent fry option, maybe even a subpar one, consume them after 11 p.m. and your ranking shoots up to a 10/10. This classic late-night establishment frequented by Potomac House residents and predominantly underclassmen sells fries ($3.50) that are sufficiently crispy, a welcome contrast with the soft, almost mashed potato-like texture on the inside. Though they could have used more salt, these fries aged much better than those at True Burger. A cold Carvings fry was edible and enjoyable, too. After docking half a point for Carvings’ distinct lack of accessible seating (a post-COVID change) and adding a point for the startling and hilariously out of place giraffe mural on the wall that glared at me as I ordered my fries (also a post-COVID change), I give these a 7/10.
2. Falafel, Inc
Ever since its arrival to Western Market earlier this year, Falafel, Inc has been known for its affordable meal options with falafel sandwiches and bowls coming in at $4 and $5, respectively. But its za’atar fries ($4) are a not-so-hidden gem on the menu because of their quality and how well they pair with the diverse array of sauce options. These were the softest, and thinnest fries we tried by a long shot. They weren’t particularly crispy – though I’ve had notably crispy fries here before, so they could be hit or miss – but the seasoning was lightly nutty and added ever so slightly to the crunch on the fries. The sauces were the real star of the show. After trying each of the six options, the best sauces to pair with these fries were the garlic, habibi and green sauces. The garlic sauce was smooth and creamy and the habibi sauce had the perfect level of spice. But I especially loved the flavor of the jalapenos and cilantro – an herb I don’t often encounter nowadays living so far away from my mom’s Indian cooking – making it perhaps my favorite of the three. Pro tip: mix the garlic and habibi sauce for a spicy, garlicky flavor. Exercise caution if caucasian. 8.75/10.
1. Bindaas
While Bindaas’ desi street food offerings may not be the most authentic, their gunpowder fries ($6.15) were my absolute favorite on this list. The fries are seasoned with gunpowder, which is the English name for a classic South Indian seasoning made of ground sesame seeds, curry leaves, Kashmiri chillies and more. The fries came with a spicy ketchup that also had the distinct sweet-sour taste of tamarind, all of which paired exquisitely with the gunpowder and the fries. The fries themselves were perfectly crispy – which was elevated by the slight crunch from the gunpowder seasoning – and contrasted with the softness of the potato on the inside. Though these were the priciest fry option I tried, the cost is worth it. To leave room for 10/10 perfection, Bindaas gunpowder fries are a 9.5/10.

Leading up to my freshman year at GW, I was so convinced I knew everything. People would ask me if I was scared or nervous about starting college and the answer was always “no” because I thought that my 18-year-old self was fully prepared to move all the way across the country and live alone. That all changed within my first month here – I came down with the flu, realized I didn’t know how to do about a million everyday activities, failed my first test and felt the most homesick and empty loneliness I’ve ever experienced in my life. Coupled with intense academic pressure, these past few months seemed pretty impossible at times.
That sense of emptiness and confusion is a familiar feeling for many freshmen. The transition to college can often take a toll on the mental and physical health of students navigating the new emotions and experiences that come with a new environment. To addresses the heightened academic pressures that coincide with these freshman year adjustments, GW offers the Academic Forgiveness Policy, which allows undergraduates to repeat three courses in which they received a D+ or lower. But a similarly beneficial pass/no pass system for juniors and seniors in the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences stops far too short of freshmen across the University. To prioritize students’ mental health during their first year of college, GW should expand the pass/no pass option to freshmen for their first semester so they can spend more time enjoying the university where they are trying so desperately to succeed.
After one semester, enough time has passed for freshmen to adjust to their new lifestyle and tackle their academics in a healthy and sustainable manner. But there is no denying that the first semester of college can be jarring and emotionally turbulent for most students. Freshmen are often experiencing independent life for the first time, which can be a huge adjustment socially and academically. While this transition is exciting and essential for personal growth and maturity, it is also emotionally taxing. Homesickness is incredibly real, especially for students like myself who would need to pay the high price of a six-hour flight that you can’t just buy on a whim. Starting college is even harder for introverted students who struggle to meet people, make friends and cultivate a whole new support system. Taking grades out of the equation for a short period of time will allow students to fully adjust to their surroundings before being thrown back into the endless cycle of chasing an A and obsessing over GPA.
When I’ve spoken to my peers about their experience balancing school and adjusting to their new life in D.C., they all agreed with that the constant academic pressure we face makes the transition undoubtedly harder. Academic pressure is healthy until it interferes with mental and physical health. Learning to take care of ourselves, whether by eating nutritious meals, exercising or finding time to socialize and experience life beyond the walls of Gelman Library is difficult to prioritize.
Students will need need to apply substantial effort to learn and retain information in classes that they take as a pass/no pass, even without the pressure of perfecting the letter grade. The parameters for a pass still require students to demonstrate a level of understanding that shows that they have attended class, retained content and turned in assignments. The letter grade is what forces more of the pressure-cooker environment that students are facing right now, creating an unhealthy relationship in which students place more value in a class score than actually learning. Grading breakdowns create a complex in which students feel pressure to reach higher and to score above a 90 percent. While a passing grade may be a 70 percent, students have been conditioned to want to do better and score higher, creating a culture in which a 70 doesn’t quite cut it anymore. The pass/no pass option takes away that dynamic, temporarily relieving students of the academic pressure to reach 100 percent every single time.
Some people may disagree with the pass/no pass system and argue that grades provide an incentive for students to work and learn, but research actually shows that the use of letter grades and point systems only exacerbate the harmful narrative that grades mean everything. Instead, a pass/no pass system derails the focus on grading and brings it back to what school exists for – learning. Grades do not always motivate students in the healthiest ways because it often leaves them to focusing on academic validation rather than personal education benefits when grades are part of the equation, according to Susan D. Blum, an anthropology professor at the University of Notre Dame. Freshmen should establish their own healthy lives to harness the energy and passion to succeed in the classroom.
It is simply unrealistic to expect a student to perform at their best in such an unfamiliar environment with so many uncertain variables in their life. Many of us attend GW for its high-quality academics, but college is also a time for personal growth and maturing. Students should have the chance to take a break from academic pressure for a semester, make new friends and take the time to learn about themselves in this new environment. GW should transition classes to a pass/no pass grading system for the first semester of freshman year to demonstrate to students that officials care about students’ mental and physical health while balancing change in their lives with a college transition.
