Point: Revere, don’t fear, ChatGPT
by Anaya Bhatt
Our world is ever-changing, especially when it comes to technology, education and where they intersect. We type essays instead of writing them and look up information on the internet rather than in books. And with the arrival of AI programs like ChatGPT, we can take advantage of new and developing technologies to enhance our education and synthesize information.
Whether we like it or not, AI exists in various forms all around us from Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa to even more common forms like algorithms that generate personalized social media feeds. Just as we have adopted these popularized technological tools in our everyday lives, we can use ChatGPT to educate ourselves and advance our society.
While search engines like Google require you to look across different websites for answers, ChatGPT immediately produces a detailed, coherent answer to your question just like another human would. The way the program synthesizes information eliminates the need to scour the internet for answers, giving you access to information and advice from prestigious universities, professors and libraries that once only belonged to the elite.
I spoke with executives at a Silicon Valley startup last week about the implications of ChatGPT, and they said the new software can level the playing field in the workplace. Someone who has a great business idea but lacks the formal education and language skills to present them in a formal manner can turn to ChatGPT for an AI-generated business proposal. Now, you don’t need a graduate-level education to draft a report, develop academic syllabi or write a story – just give ChatGPT a prompt, and it can most likely spit back a response. ChatGPT can bridge the economic and educational divide that makes social mobility and success so difficult to achieve.
And ChatGPT’s potential to alter our lives goes beyond the workplace and into the classroom. Thanks to its advanced knowledge, the system can pass graduate-level master’s tests, compose essays and source information. This has led its biggest critics, especially academic instructors, to fear that students will turn to the software for essay writing purposes and exam answers instead of learning or understanding a topic. At GW, officials are trying to stop students from using ChatGPT for assignments through the Code of Academic Integrity.
But what these critics fail to realize is that the way we learn and what we learn is not stagnant. Fifty years ago, coding and computer science classes were not nearly as prevalent in schools as they are today. We’ve moved from teachers and textbooks to digital entities, taking advantage of the internet, and through it, Zoom and online courses and resources. And while having immediate and practically unlimited access to information may have been frightening at first, try imagining life without Google today – the status quo changed.
We should revere technological advancements like ChatGPT, not fear them. The only way to keep up with the fast pace of our world is to embrace new technology and learn how to use it to its fullest potential.
Counterpoint: ChatGPT may be quick, but it’s no author
by Terra Pilch-Bisson
What makes someone an author? The job typically involves creating essays, paintings, poems and other works that reflect our perspectives, identities and the stories only we can tell. There’s a sense of ownership and pride that comes with being an author, but artificial intelligence programs like ChatGPT threaten to replace authorship with computer-generated imitation.
My first assignment of this semester for my Modern American Cultural History class, taught by associate professor of American studies Dara Orenstein, was to use ChatGPT to generate a poem in the style of an author I chose describing myself. I prompted the program to write a poem in the style of Sylvia Plath about a college student who moves from the Pacific Northwest to D.C. to study history, politics and philosophy.
Like an online horoscope, the resulting poem contained illusionary specifics that made me feel special for a moment before I realized the words could apply to countless other people – “Beyond the familiar, I sought something new/To fill the life I was living with meaning.”
The cold, inhuman style of ChatGPT failed to mimic Plath with any real attention to detail, except for a few gloomy words. None of the poems my peers and I generated had any real theme, moral or purpose. They were mechanical, impersonal and lacked figurative language and hidden meanings. They followed the prompts we provided and were more efficient than our own creative labors – the assignment took 10 minutes, tops – but none of us felt like the poems were really ours.
With the help of technology, I created something supposedly artistic but felt no more like an author than I would have scribbling down a grocery list on a Post-it note. ChatGPT excels at creating study guides and outlines, but the moment we treat computers like authors, we forget the importance and nuance of human perspective and end up with meaningless corporate art and Twitter spam bots.
Yet if ChatGPT takes away our sense of authorship, what about programs that check our grammar or help us find the right word? The difference is that neither directly infringes upon our expression of ideas. This technology can be extremely useful right up until the point where it consumes our efforts, erases our personalities and erodes our inspiration. It can help us expedite everyday activities like writing emails and typing up notes. But to quote “Dead Poets Society,” “Poetry, romance, love, beauty? These are what we stay alive for!”
We shouldn’t fear ChatGPT. It will, and should, inspire classroom conversations regarding the philosophical purpose of academic writing altogether. But there is a difference between writing purely to communicate information versus writing to articulate thoughts, feelings and emotions – and ChatGPT cannot perform the latter.
Faculty and students alike can utilize AI software in a way that supplements learning without stifling creativity. To do so, we must value authorship above expediency and not allow ChatGPT to infringe on our intellectual and creative abilities as students and authors.

Clinical psychology professor Lara Sheehi, who is the subject of a federal civil rights complaint for allegedly engaging in “erasive antisemitism,” is not teaching courses at GW this semester. But at the core of the complaint that Zionist nonprofit StandWithUs filed with the Department of Education last month is the purposeful blurring of criticism of Israel with allegedly antisemitic behavior. Anti-Zionism and antisemitism are not the same, but StandWithUs aims to remove Sheehi from her position and send a chilling message to supporters of Palestine by conflating the two forms of speech. The complaint against Sheehi follows a several decadeslong systematic effort by Israel-backed lobbyist organizations to repress speech critical of the Israeli government on college campuses.
StandWithUs and these lobbying, watchdog and media organizations either receive funding or work with the Israeli government to conflate anti-Zionism as antisemitism to suppress this kind of free speech through similar federal complaints and legal action. In 2010, the previous Deputy Foreign Minister of Israel asserted the country uses StandWithUs and other organizations to “amplify our power.” These organizations also harass and surveil Palestinian activists and dedicate significant resources to combat efforts they consider to “delegitimize” Israel, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu identifies as one of the country’s priorities.
Academic institutions like GW have traditionally been hubs for anti-Zionist activism. But instead of protecting free speech, GW has institutionally discriminated against Palestinians and supporters of Palestine on campus, punishing students, faculty and staff perceived to be critical of Israel or supportive of Palestine. Despite removing faculty for their views, punishing students, threatening to fire staff and close offices and enabling outside organizations to intimidate students, the University has never acknowledged it has suppressed academic freedom for those seeking to discuss Palestinian rights.
In 2015, the administration and GWPD threatened and disciplined a student for hanging the Palestinian flag in their dorm window. In 2018, following a Student Association resolution urging GW to divest from nine companies contributing to Palestinian oppression in the West Bank, Canary Mission – a Zionist blacklisting site – doxxed and harassed supporters of the resolution on campus. In 2019, GW Hillel refused to disaffiliate from the Israel on Campus Coalition – another Zionist nonprofit that doxxes Palestinian student activists, receives funding from Canary Mission and funds StandWithUs. Hillel International only allows campus affiliates like GW Hillel to partner with organizations supportive of Zionism as a matter of policy, in turn excluding voices in the anti-Zionist Jewish community.
Just last semester, the University investigated Students for Justice in Palestine following a postering campaign leading up to a protest outside the GW Hillel building against an event inside featuring a former IDF commander of a military unit notorious for its authoritarian and abusive surveillance of Palestinians. The University disciplined SJP President Lance Lokas following an unsubstantiated allegation that he caused “tens of thousands of dollars in damage” by attaching a sign reading “Zionists f*** off!” to a concrete bench outside of the Hillel building. Interim University President Mark Wrighton quickly condemned the postering as “disturbing” and “antisemitic.” The charges against SJP and Lokas were dropped after Lokas’ hearing in December.
In 2020, GW replaced Dr. Ilana Feldman as the interim dean of the Elliott School of International Affairs after GW for Israel and other Zionist organizations alleged she was an antisemite for supporting Boycotting, Sanctioning and Divesting from Israel in the past. BDS, which civil rights activist Angela Davis called an “ethical imperative” to implement across academic institutions, is a nonviolent cause that advocates for political and economic institutions divesting from Israel as a means to end Israel’s occupation of Palestine. The University posted a statement affirming its institutional stance against BDS after replacing Feldman.
In 2021, then-University President Thomas LeBlanc threatened to close the Office of Advocacy and Support in response to its plans to host a “virtual processing space” for Palestinian students after an IDF attack in Gaza killed 260 Palestinians, including 66 children, to further Palestinian evictions from the territory. Assistant Vice President of Health and Safety Kathleen Fox also threatened to fire OAS staff if they did not cancel the event, according to Palestine Legal. To date, the University has not allowed trauma support events for Palestinian students, and two of the three permanent OAS staff members have resigned.
The complaint against Sheehi from last month alleged she facilitated an unsafe environment for Jewish students by inviting an internationally renowned Palestinian legal activist to deliver a guest lecture that criticized Israel’s weapons and pharmaceuticals testing on Palestinian prisoners and children. Sheehi defended the lecture, arguing that criticism of Israel was not antisemitic, a distinction the allegations against her purposefully blur. While the complaint alleges Sheehi made comments targeting students for their Israeli identity, which is clearly inappropriate if true, StandWithUs wrongly argues that legitimate criticism of Israel is antisemitic.
Conversations around Israel’s occupation of Palestine are extremely contentious and controversial, but that is precisely the kind of speech that requires the most protection. GW must publicly acknowledge and apologize for its patent violations of its own policy on academic freedom – to afford University community members “the broadest possible latitude to inquire, speak, write, listen, challenge and learn” without threat of being punished, harassed or fired – and extend these freedoms to speech critical of Israel.
The University must clearly distinguish antisemitism from anti-Zionism in its nondiscrimination and nonretaliation policies. And officials must begin repairing the harm they have done to Palestinian students by reinstating trauma support services for them and reversing the University’s policy on BDS.
It is incredibly irresponsible for academic institutions to repress speech for fear of bad press or retaliation. When our political institutions fail to promote rigorous civic engagement with dissenting views, academic institutions must step up to the task of fostering that environment – and it is about time GW stepped up.

Interim University President Mark Wrighton said at a Faculty Senate meeting last month that masks are still required in classroom settings to limit the transmission of COVID-19 during the spring semester.
The University remains one of the few universities in the country to maintain a mask mandate in instructional settings, a continuation of an early pandemic policy that experts say still protects public health on campus.
GW is the only institution to still require masks in classrooms in the United States among all “large” and “urban” universities, characteristics based on metrics set by Forbes’ America’s Top Colleges list ranking the top 498 higher education institutions in the country. A Hatchet analysis of mask policies across the 229 universities that Forbes classifies as “large” and “urban” shows that GW stands alone among fellow institutions of similar size and setting despite a national shift away from aggressive masking policies three years after COVID’s initial outbreak.
Experts in public health and biology said they expect GW to drop the mandate as transmission rates slow, but GW’s lasting mandate has exhibited “leadership” in COVID policy because the requirement has continued to protect community members who are vulnerable to more severe symptoms from viruses.
Within D.C., GW and Gallaudet University are the only higher education institutions with mask mandates still in place. The University of the District of Columbia and Georgetown, American, Catholic and Howard universities each dropped their mandates last year.
The United States contains a total of 5,900 higher education institutions across the country, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.
Despite universities not requiring masks, several like Yale, Harvard, Stanford and Brown universities strongly recommend masking and allow professors to require masks in their classrooms.
Interim University President Mark Wrighton said at a Faculty Senate meeting last month that masks are still required in classroom settings to limit the transmission of COVID-19 during the spring semester. DC Health has categorized the District’s COVID community level spread as low since late July, and the department hasn’t classified transmission levels as high since late January 2022, according to data from the District’s website.
“We are going to remind everyone that we still have the need to be mindful of infectious diseases as that in the classrooms,” Wrighton said at the meeting. “We’re going to require that there be masked students, so thank you all for your cooperation on that matter.”
GW dropped its indoor mask mandate for all University spaces in September, keeping the requirement in place in classrooms, health care facilities and on GW-operated transportation. Students said they experienced “mask fatigue” last semester as the number of students wearing masks in classrooms and on the Mount Vernon Express declined.
Immunocompromised students raised concerns last year after officials lifted the biweekly COVID testing requirement in June, saying lax COVID policies put them at disproportionate risk for severe COVID symptoms.
Experts said although GW could drop the mask mandate at any time, its masking policy demonstrates a “cautious” approach to the pandemic. Some said continuing the policy is a “fantastic” decision given the number of circulating viruses, both COVID and non-COVID.
Emanuel Goldman, a professor of microbiology at Rutgers University, said GW’s mask mandate represents a more cautious approach toward limiting COVID transmission, but GW’s administration could decide mask wearing is “excessive.” He said officials could instead “redirect” their focus to instituting an updated vaccine requirement with the new bivalent booster, which the Food and Drug Administration authorized in August.
GW does not require students or faculty to receive the bivalent booster, but two of GW’s peer schools, Tufts and Wake Forest universities, require students, faculty and staff to receive the shot. GW officials require students, faculty and staff to be vaccinated against COVID with the first booster shot the FDA approved, strongly recommending the bivalent booster.
“I can only assume that GW administration wishes to maintain the most cautious approach to managing the pandemic, while other schools presumably are satisfied that vaccination requirements provide sufficient protection,” Goldman said in an email.
Laura Corlin, an assistant professor of public health and community medicine at Tufts University, said Tufts no longer requires masks, but most of her students still opt to wear them in her classes. She said having a mask mandate in effect is wise because it protects students who are more vulnerable to viruses.
“It shows some leadership that they’re willing to be protective of the community’s health,” Corlin said in an interview.
John Swartzberg – a clinical professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley’s School of Public Health’s infectious diseases division – said masks are “strongly recommended” on the UC Berkeley campus, but outside of its School of Public Health, most students don’t wear masks. He said UC Berkeley dropped its mask mandate at the same time as the City of Berkeley’s health department last February with 98 percent of students vaccinated on campus under the university’s vaccine requirement.
He said in an email that masks prevent some transmission of the virus, which he “assumes” is a priority for GW, while most other universities have opted to give students and faculty the choice to mask. Swartzberg said he “suspects” GW could drop the mask mandate if the pandemic continues to become less severe.
He said the new XBB.1.5 subvariant is especially serious for immunocompromised people who have not received a vaccine and can evade drugs that help individuals build antibodies that can help fight off the coronavirus.
“If you’re up to date with your vaccination, the chances of being hospitalized and dying are very, very small, even with XBB.1.5, so it’s not like the vaccines aren’t working,” Swartzberg said. “They just are not as potent against this as they were against some of the other variants.”
Two GW instructors said students in their classes are adhering to the mask policy and are willing to cooperate when asked to put on a mask as the University’s mandate continues to remain in place.
Mika Natif, a professor of art history specializing in Islamic art, said students in her art history classes adhere to the mandate, and some of her students have tested positive for COVID during the first three weeks of the semester. She said she hopes GW decides to drop the mask mandate only if data shows that such a move would not risk community members’ health.
She added that a reinstated mandatory monthly COVID testing policy at GW would give the community a better picture of COVID transmission around campus.
Natif said she will comply with GW’s decision if they decide to drop the mandate, but professors who currently teach without a mask are “irresponsible.”
“I told them if they pass the classroom threshold, they need to have their mask on and that’s what they’re doing,” Natif said of students in her classes.
Matthew DeMaio, a graduate student teaching Foundations of Anthropological Thought, said students who didn’t wear masks have not been a problem this school year.
“When someone wasn’t masking, it was always just a case of someone absentmindedly forgetting, and they were perfectly happy to put one on when prompted,” DeMaio said in an email.

At a Faculty Senate meeting in November, faculty senators said multiple departments within CCAS, including the Writing Center, experienced hiring issues and “inadequate” financial support.
The University Writing Center opened last week at full capacity after Columbian College of Arts and Sciences officials scaled back hiring efforts and hours due to budget cuts last fall.
Faculty overseeing the center – which provides free support to students aiming to enhance their writing skills – said following a “productive” meeting with officials, the center opened for 59 hours per week at full capacity this spring. The budget increase comes after officials decided against hiring two graduate student writing consultants and suspended services at its three satellite centers in Eckles and Himmelfarb Libraries and the Multicultural Student Services Center after officials cut the center’s budget in the fall but made plans to replenish the budget this spring.
Phyllis Ryder, the director of the University Writing Center and an associate professor of writing, said the center typically hires more consultants in the spring after consultants complete the required Pedagogy for Peer Tutors training class. She added the budget constraints in the fall did not impede the spring hiring process.
“All of these processes were the same this year as they have been in the past,” she said in an email. “The budget process did not affect our spring operations.”
At a Faculty Senate meeting in November, faculty senators said multiple departments within CCAS, including the Writing Center, experienced hiring issues and “inadequate” financial support.
Officials reduced the center’s hours of operation last semester to cut its expenses, introducing a lunch hour from noon to 1 p.m.
Ryder said the center will reopen satellite centers in Himmelfarb Library and the Multicultural Student Services Center later this semester, but the Eckles Library center will remain closed due to its reduced hours.
Officials reduced Eckles library’s hours of operation last semester after finding out that a limited number of students used the library in the mornings and after midnight, drawing criticism from freshman students and other Mount Vernon campus residents who frequently use the library to study.
Nearly “every one” of the University’s 3,000 first-year students will utilize the writing center during their time at GW, according to the Center’s website.

Freshman Holland Ley, the event coordinator for Art n Soul, said he is excited to see a “student touch” added to the white walls of the student center.
Sophomore Melanie Rocha wants to splash culture, color and history onto the barren walls of the University Student Center.
The Office of Student Life commissioned Rocha, the president and founder of the student organization Art n Soul, to paint a 52-foot mural on the wall outside of the student center’s fourth-floor elevators after upgrading the building’s interior with fresh paint, light fixtures and flooring during the summer. Rocha said the mural, which Art n Soul aims to complete by April, comes after multiple emails that officials sent students last year asking about their interest in the mural project.
“In terms of that space, I’m hoping that it excites people to want to be part of orgs and be part of our club and study there and just enjoy their space and feel like home,” Rocha said.
Rocha, a political communications major and fine arts minor, said she will send officials the initial mural outline Monday – including a Metro railcar and a cherry blossom tree as the centerpiece, with books hanging off the branches to symbolize “education and growth.” Rocha said she met with Miles Feacher, a program associate for student involvement who will oversee the overall painting process, to finalize the design last week.
Rocha said she hopes the colorful, student-led mural in the common space on the floor, which houses student organizations like the Student Association and GW Program Board as well as Org Help, will raise students’ enthusiasm about joining student organizations. She said she hopes the mural brings a wave of new public art to campus that will brighten student spaces.
“I think that being in a sterile environment is not great for your mental health,” Rocha said. “And so having something pretty to look at while you’re studying or while you’re doing whatever, it inspires you.”
Rocha said Art n Soul is an outlet for students who don’t major in the arts to express their creativity through art projects, and the USC mural is the focal point of the student organization’s launch this year. She said that during an Art n Soul general body meeting last month, about 50 people expressed interest in assisting with different pieces of the mural, like sketching, tracing and painting the design.
Rocha said Art n Soul’s five executive board members will oversee the mural’s execution by dividing participating students into small groups to paint their own respective portions of the wall.
Rocha said the e-board is recruiting more students to paint the mural with sign-ups offered to nonmembers via posters with QR codes in the student center’s elevators. She said interested students can also sign up for email updates about painting days on Engage.
“I love painting and being able to share that creativity and experience with everybody is really exciting for me,” Rocha said.
Brian Joyce, the assistant dean of student life, said officials are working to engage student organizations in the student center’s ongoing “activation” post-renovations, including the grand opening of the department’s Involvement and Leadership Office, free meals to students on Reading Day before finals and the debut of a new commuter student lounge this spring.
He said officials asked student leaders to submit mural design suggestions that highlight GW’s values like inclusivity and collaboration in an August interest survey about the mural’s development.
Joyce said the mural will be unveiled to the public April 13, around the same time cherry trees around the Tidal Basin begin to blossom. He said the mural’s premiere will come as part of the University’s “Buff and Pink Week” festival series, which will celebrate the District’s flourishing cherry blossom season.
“Art has the ability to beautify and highlight the vibrant student organization ecosystem,” Joyce said in an email.
Freshman Holland Ley, the event coordinator for Art n Soul, said he joined the student organization upon hearing about it at the Fall Org Fair because of his passion for art. He said he is excited to see a “student touch” added to the white walls of the student center.
“It helps to make students know that this floor is like a safe space for them,” Ley said. “That doesn’t matter what interest they have or if they like art or if they like sports, they feel identified.”
Ley said the mural represents a shift to more student engagement in the University’s physical appearance. He said students can better engage with the rest of the student body through artwork like the mural because student feedback plays a direct role in its display.
“It’s not the school by itself,” Ley said. “It’s more of the school and the students working together.”
Karly Martinez, the finance director of Art n Soul, said the student center’s walls are “institutionalized” and “depressing” due to their blank appearance that fails to foster a feeling of community on campus every time she exits the elevators.
She said she hopes the student center’s mural will promote similar artistic projects in other buildings like Gelman Library, the exterior of which she said looks “blunt.”
“I think that adding our own stamp, and it’s not just like Art n Soul,” Martinez said. “We’re kind of adding stuff from all different orgs and the whole student body. I think it’s going to foster more of a creative feeling on the floor.”
Zoe Swiss, the vice president of Art n Soul and a senior studying political communications, said the preparation for the mural has been a “learning curve” for members, most of whom have never planned a mural before. She said the student organization’s leaders are limiting the number of students who can work at once to mitigate the chaos of too many “chefs in the kitchen.”
“I think we are doing pretty well for ourselves and leaning on one another to figure things out,” Swiss said. “So there’s a lot to do, but I think it’s going to end up really great.”

The statements include a letter from more than 100 students and alumni from GW's Professional Psychology Program where Sheehi teaches and a letter from the US Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel signed by more than 1,800 people like political activist Angela Davis.
A psychology professor responded Friday to allegations of antisemitism from a pro-Israel nonprofit, contesting that its claims are false and used “racist, anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian tropes” to disparage her.
Lara Sheehi, an assistant professor of clinical psychology, said in an article published in the liberal-leaning magazine CounterPunch that the allegations – which the advocacy group StandWithUs filed in a civil rights complaint with the Department of Education last month – are a “misrepresentation” of what occurred in the Diversity I course she taught in the fall and “targets” her for being an Arab woman who advocates for Palestinians. The complaint alleges that Sheehi created a “hostile environment” for Jewish and Israeli students and “retaliated” against students who raised concerns about her class discussions, a guest speaker and course materials that addressed the Israel-Palestine conflict.
“The objective and irrefutable facts do not support StandWithUs’ specious claims that I target my Jewish and Israeli students,” Sheehi said in the article. “They do not support the unethical and dangerous allegations that I am antisemitic and retaliatory. What the facts, in glaring clarity do support, is that, like others before me, StandWithUs exploited students’ political beliefs and targeted me because I am an Arab woman who is involved in scholarship and activism for Palestine and Palestinians.”
Sheehi said since StandWithUs filed the complaint last month, she has received racist messages and death threats, and her address, professional license and personal email address were leaked online. She said StandWithUs’ decision to redact every name in the complaint except hers subjected her to racism and sexism over the past month.
Sheehi did not return a request for comment.
Roz Rothstein, the co-founder and CEO of StandWithUs, said she and other members of StandWithUs “appreciate” the Jewish students who raised concerns about Sheehi’s conduct and are calling for an “unbiased” investigation after University officials announced a “third party” would investigate StandWithUs’ allegations against Sheehi.
“We are confident that attempts to slander StandWithUs (a nonpartisan organization) will be seen for what they are: a means of shifting the focus away from serious claims of anti-Jewish bigotry,” Rothstein said in an email. “We hope that such attempts will either be disregarded or called out as a diversionary tactic to make this complaint about politics rather than about identity-based, discriminatory antisemitic conduct, such as that experienced by Dr. Sheehi’s Jewish and Israeli students.”
More than 2,000 students, alumni, faculty and advocates signed more than half a dozen statements in support of Sheehi over the past month.
The statements include a letter from more than 100 students and alumni from GW’s Professional Psychology Program where Sheehi teaches, a letter from the US Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel signed by more than 1,800 people like political activist Angela Davis and a statement from the Health Advisory Council for Jewish Voice for Peace – a progressive Jewish activist organization.
Sheehi said StandWithUs “unethically” represented a guest “brown bag” lecture by Nadera Shalhoub-Kevorkian, the chair of law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, who discussed how psychologists work can inadvertently contribute to state projects, like the Israeli government’s mental and public health initiatives in the Global South.
Sheehi said the Title VI complaint “fails to mention” students were not required to attend the guest presentation, and the event took place in the Elliott School of International Affairs building, so students would not feel “obliged” to attend outside of the program’s space.
StandWithUs alleges in the complaint that students felt Shalhoub-Kevorkian’s presentation “targeted” Israeli and Jewish people and played into the antisemitic stereotype of Jewish people “using money for nefarious purposes.”
“Rather than exclusivizing Israel and alienating students as the complaint cynically asserts, students across cohorts lauded how the brown bag spoke to the ethical responsibility of clinical psychologists to recognize how they may be mobilized, even inadvertently, to serve state projects, no matter the state,” Sheehi states in her article.
Sheehi spent the class following the speaker event discussing concerns a few Jewish students raised about Shalhoub-Kevorkian’s presentation, according to her article. She said several students in the class “extended their empathy” to understand Jewish students’ perspectives on the presentation, but the Jewish students engaged in “racist rhetoric” about Shalhoub-Kevorkian, like suggesting she was a “terrorist” who supported violence against Jews.
“Because of the inappropriate and relentless anti-Arab, Islamophobic and anti-Black tropes, several students attempted to deescalate the combativeness by alerting their classmates that perhaps despite their intention, their message was clouded by racism and being lost in the process of berating a professor,” Sheehi states in the article.
Sheehi said StandWithUs’ allegation that three of the course readings portrayed Israel and Jewish people in a negative light is “false.” Only two of the readings mention Palestine in passing, according to the article.
Sheehi added that the accusation that she “retaliated” against the Jewish students who voiced concerns with “disciplinary proceedings” is false. She said faculty in the program initiated a “nonpunitive” remediation process following a monthslong back and forth between the students, Sheehi and administrators, but no student received less than an A in the zero-credit course.
She alleged that in two instances during the semester, some of the Jewish students who voiced concerns yelled in class, using discriminatory language against Black and Arab people.
“These students were disruptive, yelled at and berated a professor twice and used explicitly pejorative, demeaning, inflammatory and racist language against Black people and Arabs,” Sheehi states in the article.
Sheehi said she is “certain” the third-party investigation the University announced last month after StandWithUs filed its complaint will corroborate her perspective, but GW’s move to investigate sets a “reckless precedent” of giving StandWithUs “even a modicum of credibility.”
“This move not only preempts adjudication by the Department of Education but encourages right-wing political advocacy groups, empowering them to believe that their tactics of harassment and intimidation to silence critical voices yields results,” Sheehi states in the article.
The Palestine-Global Mental Health Network – an organization working to promote mental health and social justice in Palestine and around the world – published two letters in support of Sheehi last month signed by 65 students and 55 alumni of the program and 230 of Sheehi’s Jewish colleagues.
“The resulting allegations of her creating a hostile learning environment for Jewish students and of retaliating against them could not be further than the truth,” the letter from students and alumni states. “We are concerned that as an Arab woman, she is the only individual whose name was not redacted from the Title VI complaint filed by StandWithUs, underscoring the extent to which both her scholarly focus and her identity are motivators for this attack.”
A student who was in Sheehi’s course last semester who requested to remain anonymous due to fear of public retaliation for speaking out on Sheehi’s behalf said the students at the center of the StandWithUs complaint made racist comments about Shalhoub-Kevorkian and Arab people, during the Oct. 3 class session following the guest speaker presentation.
“There was an understandable and acceptable level of discomfort over some of the things that were said or discussed by the brown bag speaker,” they said in an interview. “But in class on Oct. 3, several classmates allowed their discomfort to turn into defensiveness that then proceeded to actively harm and speak ill of groups of people that represent not only their classmates, but also our professor and our guest speaker.”
Another student who was in Sheehi’s course last semester who also requested to remain anonymous due to fear of public retaliation said StandWithUs’ complaint subjected Sheehi to a racist, xenophobic and sexist response from alt-right spaces online.
“They are building up the fire, putting all the materials down and handing the gasoline to people who are more than happy to show the darkest and meanest sides of themselves and calling a person they’ve never met a slur because some article said that she’s a terrible person without doing any concrete evidence themselves,” they said in an interview.

“I'm happy to say the faculty and the scholars across campus really have a growing interest in diversifying our research portfolio,” Vice Provost Pamela Norris said.
Updated: Feb. 8, 2023 at 9:31 p.m.
Health-related research accounted for about 67 percent of all University research expenditures in fiscal year 2022, according to a report on GW’s research enterprise at the Faculty Senate meeting Friday.
Pamela Norris, the vice provost for research, said in the report that officials plan to modernize infrastructure like myResearch – a website for faculty to better track research proposals and awards –  diversify GW’s research portfolio with more international collaboration and capitalize on the University’s location to add new research partners going forward. She said research in the social sciences, arts and humanities, science and engineering and other research accounts for about 30 percent of GW’s overall research expenditures.
“I’m happy to say the faculty and the scholars across campus really have a growing interest in diversifying our research portfolio,” Norris said.
GW’s total publications increased by 911 between 2019 and 2021, but they fell off by 131 between 2021 and 2022, according to the report. Total federal expenditures have increased from more than $150 million in FY 2019 to about $190 million in FY 2021, according to the report.
She said in December 2022, The National Institutes of Health awarded GW’s Biostatistics Center a $51 million grant over five years for a research project that aims to stop, prevent or reverse Alzheimer’s Disease in individuals with prediabetes or Type 2 diabetes. Norris said the principal investigator of the study, Marinella Temprosa – an assistant research professor in the Milken Institute School of Public Health – will “coordinate” clinical trials that provide administrative and clinical operations and data management support.
GW’s total research expenditures from the federal government, businesses, nonprofit organizations and institutional funds have largely remained flat at around $250 million per FY since 2018, according to the report.
The NIH granted GW $80 million in FY 2022 for research, according to the NIH website, which ranks ninth out of GW’s 12 peer schools in terms of research funding. Total NIH funding has dropped 28 percent in the past three fiscal years, but Norris said NIH award data by itself does not completely “reflect an institution’s research productivity or impact in a given year” since many awards are distributed over multiple years and researchers receive funds from nonfederal contributors.
Norris said the launch of myResearch last February consolidated the research application process into a streamlined system, modernizing GW’s research infrastructure. She said faculty members submitted more than 893 research proposals through the website, drawing $85.1 million in research awards.
She said faculty are interested in international collaboration, doing work with “export-controlled information,” clinical research and contracting with “faculty-controlled spin-off companies,” which transfer research out of laboratories and into the world. Norris said strengthening the research enterprise will require more faculty training in areas like human trials, export controls and human subjects research.
“It’s really important I think that they understand first what we have to offer is a really well-educated student, educated in a broad University who understands technology of these companies as it connects to ethics and to policy and to broader decisions,” Norris said.
Norris said the U.S. presidential memorandums released in January 2021 to guard against “undue” foreign influence in research, imposing stricter guidelines on researchers.
She said scholars like GW must develop a research security program in response this year, which includes training in cyber security, foreign travel, research security and export control – the process of regulating the export of goods, software and technology – to ease the “burden” of scholars’ compliance with the new federal regulations.
Norris said research faculty should set up an Open Research Contributor ID, a form of a persistent digital identifier, to hold their research information like publications, board services, editorial roles or presentations because it sticks to researchers when changing institutions or jobs.
“It follows you, so heaven forbid you leave and go to another institution, it goes with you,” Norris said. “You get married, your name changes, it knows who you are and it continues to link that information.”
Norris said she has been “leveraging” the University’s location to increase funding from corporations like Raytheon and build GW’s reputation to foster partnerships with federal organizations like the Office of Naval Research and research organizations in the District like the Southeastern Universities Research Association.
“I think part of my job is really talking to the external audience about the excellence of GW to promote our reputation and also to make connections for scholars within the community,” Norris said.
Later in the Faculty Senate meeting, interim University President Mark Wrighton said incoming University President Ellen Granberg visited campus last week and is planning to visit GW in three- to four-day periods every month until she begins her term in June.
“The Board of Trustees has done an outstanding job in recruiting Ellen Granberg to be the 19th president,” Wrighton said.
Officials also delivered updates on GW’s freshman retention rate and undergraduate application numbers at the meeting.
Provost Chris Bracey said in a report to the Senate that freshman fall to spring semester retention rates increased to 97.7 percent, which he said is “comparable” to pre-pandemic numbers. Officials said during a 2021 senate meeting that the first to second year retention rate for the Class of 2024 was 91 percent, higher than the Class of 2023’s 88 percent and near the Class of 2022’s 92 percent.
“This, I think, is a testament to the strength of a student experience that we offered in the fall,” he said. “And I’m confident that we’ll continue to offer the same sort of experience in the spring semester.”
Bracey said the number of applications for the Class of 2027 is also “similar” to pre-pandemic levels. He added that officials launched a pilot program deferring the enrollment of Class of 2026 applicants for a semester so they would begin in spring 2023 rather than fall 2022.
“Traditionally, we had about 10 to 15 first-year students start in the spring, but it’s clear that our academic reputation and relentless pursuit of excellence continue to attract talented students, and we are indeed worth the wait for someone,” he said.
The Senate also approved a set of changes to the Faculty Organization Plan that the Professional Ethics and Academic Freedom Committee presented in a resolution. The changes included instituting procedures for determining whether Faculty Assembly meetings are held virtually or in a hybrid format, updating the official titles of administrators and incorporating gender-neutral language into the governing document.
The committee’s resolution also changed the number of faculty needed to call a special meeting of the Faculty Assembly from 50 or more members to 10 percent of the Faculty Assembly.
Linda Briggs, an associate professor in the School of Nursing, proposed an amendment to the committee’s resolution to allow members of the senate to decide by vote whether or not the senate meets in a virtual, in person or hybrid format for the next academic year, but the amendment failed 18 to four.
This post has been updated to correct the following: 
The Hatchet incorrectly reported that health-related research accounted for 70 percent of GW’s research expenditures. Health-related research counted for about 67 percent of research expenditures. The Hatchet incorrectly reported that officials plan to update myResearch with more internal collaboration. Officials plan to update myResearch with more international collaboration. The Hatchet incorrectly reported that Biden released memorandums in August 2022. The U.S. presidential memorandum was released in January 2021. The Hatchet also incorrectly reported that GW has launched a security research program. Norris said universities like GW should develop a security research program. We regret these errors. The Hatchet also clarified that faculty are interested in various research initiatives and clarified the total expenditures of GW.
