The call to “do something” is an all-too-familiar part of the cycle of grief and outrage that follows mass shootings in this country. When the bursts of gunfire at schools, businesses and places of worship come to a tragic end, we look toward those in power to take decisive action. From Capitol Hill to our own community at GW, what can we do to stop gun violence?
Officials told all of us their answer earlier this month when they announced the GW Police Department will arm about 20 of its officers with handguns this fall. Arming GWPD officers demonstrates officials’ commitment to “doing something,” but it would endanger the University community, not protect it.
Officials are gambling that the guns they place in GWPD officers’ hands will stop more violence than they beget. But the simple truth is that when universities equip their police departments with firearms, their officers may use those weapons on the very people they’re meant to protect – us. A Georgia Tech Police Department officer shot and killed a student who was believed to be holding a knife and yelling “shoot me” at officers in 2017. A single University of Chicago Police Department officer shot a student wielding a metal pole in 2018, and that same officer shot another student who was armed with a gun in 2022. Both UChicago students, who were reportedly experiencing mental health episodes at the time, survived.
Because GW’s Foggy Bottom Campus is interwoven into the rest of D.C.’s urban fabric, there’s also the chance a GWPD officer could injure or kill a passerby with no ties to the University while engaging in routine patrols and stops. Such a tragedy would not be unprecedented – a University of Cincinnati Police Department officer shot and killed Samuel DuBose, an unarmed Black man unaffiliated with the university, during a traffic stop in July 2015.
The sense of fear and unease that could taint interactions between GWPD officers and the community they serve, let alone the chances for a fatal encounter, should have given the Board of Trustees pause as they were planning this decision. Instead, officials said the Board arrived at its decision to arm GWPD officers in a little under a year and in what was practically utter secrecy. Save for a few faculty senators and student leaders, officials skipped deliberation – think town halls, feedback forms and special committees – over their plans in favor of forcefully implementing them.
After deadly shootings at the University of Virginia in November and Michigan State University in February, we too wanted GW to do something to respond to potential shootings and other violent acts on or near its campus. We encouraged officials to better publicize GW’s discussion-based active shooter training and stock buildings with kits that contain tourniquets, bandages and other medical equipment to treat traumatic injuries, like a gunshot wound, so the University would be ready to respond to a crisis.
But it’s unclear if officials see the threat to GW coming from inside or outside of it – or both. GWPD Chief James Tate told The Hatchet armed GWPD officers could have more effectively intervened in armed robberies of Canada Goose jackets on and near campus while interim University President Mark Wrighton told The Hatchet he couldn’t recall a single incident during his tenure where it would have been necessary for GWPD officers to use a firearm.
If officials are concerned that a member of the GW community could inflict violence on their peers, there are other ways they can pursue a safer, more secure University that avoids the risks inherent in arming any campus police force. Two such measures could include increasing the number of staff involved in mental health resources like those at Counseling and Psychological Services – which currently employs 10 staff clinicians and one staff psychologist – and ensuring staff respond to CARE reports quickly.
And if officials fear a more external threat, like armed criminals committing robberies and assaults around Foggy Bottom, they can put GW’s research and financial capabilities to use. The University joined 20 colleges and universities in the D.C. area last year to explore how best to address gun violence – it can take those lessons, which surely don’t include throwing more guns into the mix and work with city and community leaders to apply them to D.C.
Granted, some of these measures are more reactive than proactive. But unlike giving GWPD officers guns, there’s no chance testing the University’s blue light system or more strictly enforcing tap access – solutions that could make GW’s campus safer – end in the death of an innocent person.
In the aftermath of the shooting at UVA that killed three and injured two students, we wrote that it was OK to feel afraid, angry or numb. And in our collective sorrow, it can be all too easy to grasp for a simple solution – fight gunfire with gunfire. A previous staff editorial even called on GWPD to “hire and arm” experienced officers amid a period of turnover at the department in 2019, a stance the following editorial board rescinded in 2020 during nationwide protests over police brutality. Arming GWPD would have been wrong in 2019 – it wouldn’t have made our campus safer then, and it won’t make it safer this fall.
We need a holistic approach to campus safety, not one born of desperation and resignation over mass shootings. Twenty-odd 9 mm handguns send a message that officials know there’s a problem, but arming GWPD is no solution to gun violence. These weapons and the officers who will wield them won’t “do something” unless they’re used to stop a crisis – or to start one.
The editorial board consists of Hatchet staff members and operates separately from the newsroom. This week’s staff editorial was written by Opinions Editor Ethan Benn and Contributing Opinions Editor Julia Koscelnik, based on discussions with Sports Editor Nuria Diaz, Managing Editor Jaden DiMauro, Culture Editor Clara Duhon, Design Editor Grace Miller and Social Media Director Ethan Valliath.

Laila Salaam is a senior majoring in international affairs and Maddy Niziolek is a first-year Master of Public Administration student with a focus in health and gender policy. Salaam and Niziolek are co-presidents of GW Reproductive Autonomy and Gender Equity.
As the primary reproductive justice student organization at the University, GW RAGE has been at the forefront of campus advocacy since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, stripping millions of Americans of the right to access abortion. But the University’s only response to the greatest rollback of civil rights in our generation was to install a Plan B vending machine in the University Student Center in January. The vending machine is neither affordable nor accessible and does not address the larger problem of insufficient reproductive health care resources at GW.
We are petitioning GW to make the vending machine accessible 24/7, reduce the cost of its Plan B from $30 to $7 and include student organizations in the development of campus initiatives that are relevant to their missions. You can sign the petition at tinyurl.com/gwplanb and follow along @gw.rage. GW can and must do better to provide reproductive health care on campus, and more than 500 students, 20 professors and 39 student organizations who have signed our petition agree.
At $30, the Plan B in the vending machine is the same price as the generic Plan B at the CVS across the street. Other universities have been able to provide Plan B for a significantly reduced cost – Northeastern University sells Plan B for $7 and Boston University sells Plan B for $7.25 in their respective contraceptive vending machines. GW’s vending machine is not even available when the student center is closed from midnight to 7 a.m., a time when students may need to urgently access Plan B. The Mount Vernon Campus has no vending machine, meaning the closest option for Vern residents is an off-campus, non-24/7 CVS about half a mile away.
Other methods for students to get affordable, accessible Plan B on campus have already been in place for years. The student-led reproductive health care advocacy organization Foggy Bottom Plan B, one of our partner groups, already provides free Plan B to students through confidential peer-to-peer delivery. Founded by GW students in 2019, FBPB runs completely on donations and works with Carafem, an abortion and reproductive health care clinic, to get Plan B at a reduced cost that allows FBPB to distribute more pills for free.
Students can get free Plan B confidentially from FBPB via a Google Form at fbplanb.com, and more than 50 students have requested Plan B from FBPB through that form since officials installed the vending machine. Some students have told distributors like ourselves they sought out FBPB’s services because the vending machine is not affordable.
Students shouldn’t have to fund their own reproductive health care, especially not at one of the most expensive universities in the country with a $2.4 billion endowment. Students also shouldn’t have to spend their time or risk their safety to provide basic reproductive health care to their peers. FBPB’s confidential hand-off system requires distributors to meet with strangers – both students and other people in Foggy Bottom – with unknown intentions on and off campus at any time of the day. This routine becomes increasingly dangerous as abortion providers and abortion-rights supporters face a rise in violence, stalking, harassment and assault for providing reproductive health care.
The University has rejected FBPB’s attempts to become a student organization in both 2019 and 2023, citing liability concerns about students distributing over-the-counter medication. But FBPB distributors require each recipient of Plan B to sign a liability waiver upon receipt of the medication. Recognized student organization status would give FBPB a secure presence on campus and funding, two things it needs to ensure there is always accessible Plan B on campus if GW cannot commit to improving the vending machine.
Plan B is also available for free at the Student Health Center for students who are on GW’s Student Health Insurance Plan, but a majority of students at GW are not enrolled on SHIP. Obtaining Plan B through SHIP also requires students to get an appointment, which undermines the effectiveness of Plan B – it works best if taken as soon as possible after unprotected sex. And students who get Plan B through their parents’ insurance risk their parents finding out about their sexual activity.
GW has made it abundantly clear it has no interest in funding the reproductive health care students deserve. Do they consider access to health care too controversial for the University to fund? GW does not subsidize the cost of any products in the machine, which are donated by Vengo – the company that installed the vending machine in the student center, according to Assistant Dean of Student Life Brian Joyce. We met with Joyce in February after we released a statement in response to the vending machine in January. Dean of Students Colette Coleman reiterated that information last month in her response to our petition for officials to make the vending machine more affordable and accessible. We followed up with officials the next day about the potential for additional machines on campus to be stocked with more affordable Plan B, and they have still not replied weeks later.
To be clear, there are also ways for GW to provide Plan B at a lower cost without subsidizing it. The same brand of emergency contraception in the vending machine is available to purchase on Amazon for $19.95. There are other generic brands of Plan B that frequently retail for under $10 that could go in the vending machine – FBPB gets Plan B pills for $10 from Carafem, and the University could do the same.
GW has ignored the concerns about the vending machine students have brought to its attention, instead highlighting the incremental change the machine represents in our discussions. Officials have not met with GW RAGE despite multiple requests since we sent them our petition last month, and they have repeatedly ignored our calls for change with their inaction.
GW RAGE remains undeterred, and we will continue fighting for access to all reproductive health care on campus as we have done since 2009. We have organized student protests, provided free sexual health materials and information, kept students up to date on the status of abortion access, fundraised for local abortion funds, created resource guides for students and developed a training series for reproductive justice student organizers. We encourage you to join us.

Dr. Dwayne Kwaysee Wright is an assistant professor of higher education administration and the director of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives at the Graduate School of Education and Human Development.
As a professor here at GW, I am truly blessed to teach some of the brightest students in the world. One of the most complicated concepts my students engage in and among the most difficult problems we ask them to address are “wicked problems” – problems that are difficult, if not impossible, to solve because of incomplete, contradictory and sometimes changing constraints and conditions.
As a microcosm of our society, it is no coincidence college campuses are places where we engage with many of our country’s wicked problems, especially how to keep our communities safe and secure from an epidemic of gun violence. To that end, interim University President Mark Wrighton announced last Thursday that the University will arm about 20 “specially trained” GWPD supervisory officers. It should be noted that Wrighton both deserves and has earned the accolades and admiration of the GW community. His short tenure here at GW has gone a long way to reestablish community trust in the administration and improve cooperation between administration and faculty, which underlines why I am disappointed that he would support such a decision.
Wrighton was the chancellor and CEO of Washington University in St. Louis when police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed an 18-year-old, unarmed Black man, Michael Brown, in Ferguson, Missouri on Aug. 9, 2014. The protests following this incident catalyzed the Black Lives Matter movement. This movement would go on to be at the center of the protest of the public lynching of George Floyd, another unarmed Black man executed without a trial by yet another armed police officer in Minneapolis in May 2020.
You would think that an academic leader who has the benefit of such an experience would counsel his university’s Board of Trustees to move with caution and prudence when deciding to arm campus police in a city like D.C., which already has a large and armed police force. Yet either with or at the behest of the Board, Wrighton announced the Board’s decision to arm some officers – a decision taken with little to no faculty or student consultation.
This rather abrupt turn in campus safety policy sparks several questions.
Why wasn’t the Faculty Senate’s Committee on University and Urban Affairs, at the very least, informed and consulted prior to the Board’s decision? I share the frustrations of other faculty troubled by the lack of transparency around officials’ decision to arm GWPD. It seems for every step forward to true shared governance at GW, we insist on subsequently taking two steps backward. Are we really making strides toward true shared governance at GW if a limited group of folks continues to make the most impactful “governance” decisions? After we have seemingly made so much progress on shared governance principles and procedures, the process behind the decision to arm GWPD mimics the same draconian, paternalistic practices that poisoned the heart of the GW community during the administration of former University President Thomas LeBlanc.
Why wasn’t this change announced before this year’s Student Association elections took place on April 13 and 14? Such a move could have permitted the candidates to weigh in on the proposed policy change and permitted the student body to allocate their votes accordingly. Perhaps fearing an inevitable backlash, our Board seems to have chosen to employ a top-down, neoliberal, corporate-ish process to decide a community issue rather than favor student democracy and collective input.
Where is the money for these shiny new weapons and the special training for the officers who will carry them? As the administration forces colleges and units around GW to consider devastating if not debilitating budget cuts, it is particularly frustrating that the Board decided to fund tools of destruction instead of methods of academic inquiry. Yet it seems we have the money to hire yet another consulting group, this time to guide the plan to arm officers.
Where on campus and in D.C. are the academic centers, like those at Johns Hopkins and Rutgers universities, that dedicate themselves to researching the causes of and solutions to gun violence? And why wasn’t this announcement coupled with an effort to research and strengthen our safety practices and those on campuses throughout the nation?
A silver lining in all of this is that Chief James Tate, one of the few Black male leaders on campus, currently leads GWPD and will oversee the implementation of this hasty adjustment to campus policy. I have come to know Tate and can say that he is a man of great moral clarity and a stellar leader of our campus police. I have enjoyed working with him when the opportunity has arisen, whether that be when he sets time aside to hold open hours for the GW community or when he has taken time to engage with the Black Men’s Initiative at GW. I am sure he has a great understanding of the many complexities within this policy debate and will do his duty to the best of his ability.
But I will remind readers that in January five armed Black police officers in Memphis – a city whose chief of police, Cerelyn Davis, is also Black – punched, kicked and bludgeoned Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old unarmed Black man. Nichols later died from the injuries the officers inflicted on him. Systemic gun violence – much of which occurs at the hands of police – also disproportionately impacts Black and brown people. Police were nearly three times as likely to kill Black people than white people between 2013 and 2023, according to police reform initiative Campaign Zero. We must be careful to remember that anti-Black policies, even when Black faces in high places implement and oversee them, remain anti-Black policies.
Just over a month since we observed the third anniversary of the death of Breonna Taylor, we mourned yet another tragedy two weekends ago in Missouri when 16-year-old Ralph Yarl was shot in the head when he rang the wrong doorbell after mistaking a friend’s address when he went to pick up his siblings. I have been struggling to figure out how more guns, rather than fewer, could have prevented that tragedy. With its decision, the Board seems to have embraced the illogical, empirically flawed strategy that the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.
Whatever trustees have in store, my hope is simply that they start listening to others besides themselves and stop embracing the disease of guns as the only cure for gun violence.

Officials said they plan to open a new market offering “grab and go items” and groceries in District House to fill Crisp's place.
Officials permanently closed a District House dining vendor after less than a year of service Wednesday.
GW Dining announced staff at Crisp, a salad vendor in District House, will stop serving students after April 19 in an Instagram post April 13. The post states officials will announce the vendor replacing the salad bar at a later date.
University spokesperson Julia Metjian said officials will open a new market offering “grab and go items” and groceries in District House to fill Crisp’s place.
“As part of the continued dining implementation, there will continue to be changes and modifications made each summer,” Metjian said.
Crisp, along with DH Pizza & Pasta Co., True Burger, The Halal Shack and D.C. Taco House, opened in the District House basement Aug. 22. Officials announced in August 2021 they would be closing previous District House vendors – Chick-fil-A, GRK Fresh Greek, Sol Mexican Grill, Kin’s Sushi and Wiseguy Pizza – to construct an all-you-can-eat dining hall in the building’s basement.
Officials reversed their decision last April and retained their traditional vendor format in the District House basement, replacing the vendors with stations owned by food service company Chartwells Higher Education. Officials switched from a dining dollars program, with a declining balance of funds to be used at local restaurants and grocery stores, to a meal swipe program with unlimited and block plans to use at University-owned dining halls at the beginning of the semester.
All five District vendors offer “meal deals,” which include an entree, drink and side for $8.

The newly renovated venue of the Songbyrd Music House still has a warehouse feel, which lends itself well to the experimental nature of punk and hardcore concerts.
From sticky floors to untamed moshing, small venues have created a vibrant underground rock community in D.C. based on comradery and inclusion for decades.
Hardcore and punk rock music emerged in the late 1970s as a rebellion against elites and economic inequality to create a colorful counter-cultural scene in the District and cities nationwide. While local venues around the city are known to host a wide variety of music genres like R&B, hip-hop and go-go, the owners and employees of these spots have continued to promote local rock artists to keep the scene alive across a series of small venues, including The Pocket, Songbyrd, The Runaway and DC9 Nightclub. 
The hardcore and punk community thrived off the do-it-yourself and anti-conformity ethic, working with whatever instruments, equipment and performing space artists had, making the music experimental and thrash. With the rise in popularity of bands like Bad Brains and Fugazi, the city established its prominence on the rock scene. Commenting on capitalism, gender and sexuality, hardcore punk in D.C. developed with help from the District’s small rock venues that have uplifted amateur artists, including punk rockers Ekko Astral, a band recognizable for addressing gender transition, and anti-patriarchal band Bacchae. These venues, defined by their confined physical space and rugged atmosphere, have lived on through an intimate community of rockers.
We spoke to owners and staff members of these local venues about the evolution, culture and community of D.C.’s rock scene.
The Pocket
Miles Ryan started 7DrumCity, a local center for musicians to learn and perform together, when he began offering drumming lessons out of his living room in 2010. Today, the community center has grown from a one-man show to an entire staff residing in Truxton Circle. Its current building houses The Pocket, an intimate 70-person venue lit up with multi-colored lights and black sound-dampening panels lining the walls.
Amanda Dove, 7DrumCity’s director of marketing and community development, said The Pocket hosts open mic nights for bands and solo artists, masterclasses taught by local “rockstars” and FLASHBAND, a program that matches solo artists together to form bands. She said the events 7DrumCity hosts throughout the year create a learning and rehearsing environment that helps strengthen the District’s rock community. 
“We definitely want to be a champion for our local bands,” Dove said. “So much of 7DrumCity and The Pocket ethos is about supporting the local music community. Everyone’s so ambitious and supportive. I think that’s like the coolest thing about 7DrumCity. It definitely feels like a family atmosphere.”
Dove said The Pocket got its name from a term used in go-go music to describe its underlying beat, and the venue has hosted go-go bands over the years. Go-go, a genre that originated in D.C. during the late 1970s, fuses genres of funk, blues and rhythm with African and Latin influences. Washingtonians like bandleader Chuck Brown, who is credited for the creation of the genre, and Rare Essence, one of the most prominent bands in the local music scene, have defined the music.
“If you walk around and you hear someone banging on buckets or whatever, it’s generally a go-go beat, and that’s just the soundtrack of our city,” she said.
1508 North Capitol St. NW. Open daily from 7 to 11:30 p.m. 
Songbyrd Music House
Owners of Songbyrd Music House Joe Lapan and Alisha Edmonson relocated Songbyrd from Adams Morgan to Union Market District in 2021, opening the new space with a cleaner sound system, wider stage, large floor space and 17-foot-high ceiling teeming with string lights. The newly renovated venue still has a warehouse feel, which lends itself well to the experimental nature of punk and hardcore concerts.
“It’s a clear sound system without kind of blowing your ears out,” Edmonson said. “As a shorter person, I built the stage for my viewpoint.”
Lapan said the venue’s capacity of 250 people allows him and Edmunson to draw in crowds with touring musicians while also booking local artists to build the performers’ prominence.
Edmonson said she noticed D.C.’s rock scene has a sense of inclusivity, staying true to the origins of the punk scene and encouraging people to get involved at any age.
“This is the only city I’ve ever lived in where it’s all ages all the time, and I think that started from the punk scene,” Edmonson said.
540 Penn St. NE. Open Sunday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. to midnight, Monday to Thursday from 7 p.m. to midnight, Friday from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m. and Saturday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. to 3 a.m.
The Runaway
In early 2022, Christine Liyea opened concert locale The Runaway, named after iconic 1970s all-woman band, The Runaways. With string lights, sequin curtains and vintage tchotchkes, the space feels like you’re stepping into a 1970s, patchouli-scented fever dream.
Brain Dudolevitch, the manager of The Runaway and its sister venue Slash Run, said the “killer” sound system and solid stage allow the restaurant and bar to turn into a full-fledged music venue at night.
“A lot of the neighborhood regulars are hanging out in the bar, and they hear soundcheck,” he said. “And it sounds cool – they’re like ‘Yeah, let me buy a ticket and stick around.’ So you actually end up exposing some of the neighborhood regulars who are just hanging out on Friday afternoon.”
Dudolevitch said The Runaway books a diverse array of genres for performances, from indie to emo to ska, but their favorite acts are punk and rock n’ roll.
“People still hang on to the hardcore punk thing from the ’80s, but D.C.’s got these cool little pockets and everything, like there’s a driving metal scene,” Dudolevitch said. “We got all these touring acts with some local support, but people come out to support them.”
3523 12th St. NE. Open Sunday from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m., Monday through Wednesday from 5 p.m. to midnight, Thursday from 9 to 2 a.m., Friday from 8 to 3 a.m. and Saturday from 9 to 3 a.m.
DC9 Nightclub
In 2004, Bill Spieler co-founded DC9, a three-level music venue, bar and restaurant in the same building where he DJed rock music in past venues like Asylum and Club Hollywood during the 1980s and 1990s.
Today, the first floor and roof deck serve as a bar area, but most of the action happens on the red-and-black-painted second level featuring a corner stage. The floor’s dark ambience, proximity to the musicians on the low stage and surrounding speakers make it the perfect place to throw your hair around and stomp your Dr. Martens.
As an owner, Spieler said it’s a balancing act when booking artists. He said he wants to uplift local bands but also get enough people in the door to keep the venue alive. He said many times they’ll “take chances” on local bands’ ability to draw an audience, which usually pays off.
He said the rock scene in D.C. has become incredibly vibrant, noting that the District’s close-knit rock community makes it distinctive from other cities.
“It’s kind of the benefit of being a quote-unquote small town,” Spieler said. “People get along with each other quite well.”
1940 9th St. NW. Open Sunday through Thursday from 5 p.m. to 1 a.m., Friday from 5 p.m. to 3 a.m. and Saturday from 3 p.m. to 3 a.m.

Liesl Riddle said she will implement programs like “Semester in Washington” and “Professional Access Roundtables” to connect students to local professionals.

Updated: April 25, 2023, at 12:21 p.m.
With her first year as the dean of the College of Professional Studies approaching an end, Liesl Riddle said she is proud of the college’s commitment to interdisciplinary studies and hopes to increase industry opportunities for students in the coming years.
After taking the helm of CPS in August, Riddle said she developed a strategic plan that launched earlier this month to grow community and industry engagement in the college and a paralegal studies program that will kick off this fall. She said CPS attracts students with a wide range of career-oriented learning goals, which requires the school to focus on preparing them for entering industries through professional connections.

Riddle said she will implement other programs like “Semester in Washington,” which gives undergraduates exposure to political careers and “Professional Access Roundtables,” which connect students to local professionals working in fields they are considering joining.
“I really believe that passion for the special students that are attracted, the faculty, the staff that are attracted to this really special unique place right here in the heart of Washington, D.C. and everything in its history that we stand for, is something that I’m really very passionate about,” Riddle said.
Riddle first joined GW as an assistant professor of international business and international affairs in 2001. She later moved to administrative roles in the School of Business, where she became the associate dean of graduate programs in 2018 and the vice dean for strategy in 2021.
Riddle transitioned into her current role as CPS dean in August 2022 after Melissa Feuer, the former associate dean for student and academic affairs in CPS who served as the interim dean after Christopher Deering, left in August 2020. Riddle said her transition was “incredibly smooth” because CPS students’ specialized goals and desire for flexibility are similar to those in the business school and added that Feuer provided support in the process.
She said The Graduate School of Political Management, housed within CPS, will debut “Semester in Washington” in the summer of 2024, which will connect undergraduate students to D.C. political professionals to explore potential careers over eight weeks. Riddle said she wants to give undergraduate students from all over the country this “special experience” and connect them with CPS.
“It’s going to be experiential learning,” Riddle said. “We’re going to go out, and we’re going to go to Capitol Hill, we’re going to meet with those alumni, we’re going to learn firsthand from them, we’re going to do debates, we’re going to have incredible guest speakers.”
CPS is also launching the “Professional Access Roundtables” program in the next academic year, which consists of virtual on-campus forums for students to connect with professionals in their field of interest, primarily alumni. Riddle said there are a lot of parallels between this program and the “Industry Roundtables” program she helped design for the business school as vice dean of strategy because both prioritize students capitalizing on access to faculty who are experienced in professions like homeland security, technology and paralegal studies.
“The way that this thing is structured is that the alum or other industry leader that’s going to be the roundtable leader will come up with three questions that they want the students to think about and research and bring talking points to the conversation about, so that the students learn more about the industry,” Riddle said.
Riddle said CPS faculty play a vital role in advancing the school’s interdisciplinary focus because many bring perspectives on current industries to the classroom as working professionals in their field. She said 95 percent of the faculty are employed full time in fields like political science, technology and security, while CPS students are, on average, in their early 30s and attend college to receive their bachelors degrees, complete masters programs and transition into specific careers.
“I really appreciate the fact that we have faculty here that think very similarly and they’re very creative, interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary, in some cases, thinkers, so it’s a great home to be in,” Riddle said.
The Faculty Senate voted earlier this month to pass a resolution giving the college two nonvoting members in the Senate after CPS faculty advocated for their right to representation in discussions about broader University goals and initiatives. CPS faculty are not tenured and thus do not meet the tenure requirement outlined in the Faculty Organization Plan that would allow them to represent themselves in the senate.
Riddle said she is “really glad” CPS faculty are using their voice to advocate for the change they want because the senate is a faculty-driven body.
“I really believe faculty governance, particularly at GW, is sacred, and as such, I really do believe that the faculty senate is a faculty body, and it really should govern how it should operate,” Riddle said. “And I really don’t think that that’s something that administrators should be a part of.”
Riddle said she uses her administrative experience from her time in the business school to bolster interdisciplinary studies and professional partnerships within the school.
“I think the experience of understanding a diverse portfolio, being able to market that to very diverse market segments as well is something that I have familiarity with, that you might not have had in sort of, in every administrative experience,” Riddle said.
Riddle said her understanding of CPS’ diverse interests stemmed from her multidisciplinary undergraduate and graduate education at the University of Texas at Austin, where she obtained an undergraduate and graduate degree in Middle East studies and a master’s in business administration in international business and marketing. She said she understands wanting to pursue multiple topics and wants to work with students to find careers that align with their identified passions in areas like politics, leadership and cyber studies.
“When it came to Ph.D. time, I chose sociology, but the work that I did drew on every experience that I had had before that,” Riddle said. “My research fell in between sociology, political science, international affairs and business.”
This post has been updated to correct the following:
The Hatchet incorrectly reported that Riddle said CPS is “great to be in.” Riddle said CPS is a great home to be in. We regret this error.

Students might know LinkedIn as the app where their classmates flex their internships and student organization titles, but others have had run-ins that stretch the bounds of the networking site
While most use LinkedIn to secure that ever-elusive summer internship, several GW students have had some shockingly unprofessional encounters on the employment-centered platform.
Students might know LinkedIn as the app where their Elliott classmates flex their internships, but others have had run-ins that stretch the bounds of the networking site. From disturbing declarations of love to sketchy sponsorship deals, we spoke to students about their wildest stories on the app known for job postings and braggadocious employment updates.
Businessman by day, nauseating poet by night
Victoria Robertson, a senior majoring in international affairs, said a man in his mid-30s who worked for an energy innovation corporation viewed her LinkedIn page and proceeded to ask her out on a date through her GW email account which she unknowingly had included in her profile.
“I got the email, and I was freaked out because I didn’t realize that you could get someone’s email off of LinkedIn,” Robertson said.
In a somewhat incoherent two-paragraph message, the man tried to dish out some poetry.
“I do believe everything is possible if we put our mind and heart together, just like I believe that good things can be found in the least places and when we least expect,” the email states.
Robertson said the man attached a series of casual selfies in the email, particularly disturbing her. She said the photos had the makings of a Tinder profile, complete with a photo of him posing in front of the Lincoln Memorial.
In the email, the man said multiple times he realized it was unprofessional to message her through the site, breaching the unwritten business-only rules of LinkedIn.
“The fact that he starts off with ‘I know that this is an invasion of your privacy,’ it felt like he felt as though he was entitled to talking to me, even though he knew it was wrong,” she said.
Robertson blocked him on LinkedIn immediately after seeing the email. She said the encounter, along with the fake humility people present in their profiles, has cemented LinkedIn as the worst social media platform in her eyes.
“It was just another reminder that as a woman, the internet is just a cesspool no matter where you are and that people even presenting themselves professionally can still behave inappropriately,” she said.
Separation between church and LinkedIn 
Kate Carpenter, a senior majoring in political communication, had a similar off-putting experience with an older man while using LinkedIn.
When she was a junior in high school, Carpenter said she was playing tennis with a group of friends and noticed a man standing by himself on the court, so she asked him to join. Carpenter invited the man to go to church with her after the game ended, and they exchanged email addresses so they could discuss their thoughts on religion.
His messages about faith slowly turned into expressions of romantic interest in her. Naturally, Carpenter found this email “horrifying” and ignored it, only for him to follow up a week later.
“A week later, he responds to our original email chain like nothing had ever happened and asked me what I believed about Mary, the mother of Jesus,” Carpenter said.
Three years later, after searching to find his current whereabouts on LinkedIn, she discovered he had moved from Oklahoma to London.
“I was wondering ‘What is this guy up to – is he okay?’” Carpenter said. “Did I drive him to move away, or have I caused mass destruction in his life – let me check in on him.”
As an active user of LinkedIn, Carpenter sent him a request without thinking too deeply about their history. After he accepted and sent a message asking if she wanted a romantic relationship with him, she immediately disconnected with him on the platform.
Carpenter said this experience taught her the importance of guarding herself on social media, and she continues to use the app with caution to help grow her network.
“I’m still so pro-LinkedIn,” Carpenter said. “I’ve been able to expand my network, keep in touch with so many people at GW. Beyond GW, I’ve even helped grow my personal business.”
LinkedIn and chill
A junior majoring in political communication described herself as a casual LinkedIn user, but her relationship with the app entered a new level of intimacy when she accepted a Bumble hookup’s connection request while they were naked in bed together in 2021.
After their hookup, they began discussing internships when she mentioned she had applied for a job at a company where his friend coincidentally worked. Before they even got dressed, he offered to send his friend’s number to help them connect.
“I just jokingly asked ‘Oh, what’s your LinkedIn?’” she said, laughing. “And then he actually pulled out his phone.”
She said the hookup was a data analyst who flexed his career in his Instagram bio, where he dubbed himself “NPR referenced.” Despite acknowledging the pair had no romantic future, she still connected with him on LinkedIn to gain exposure to a wider network of connections.
“I’ve overheard many people in the city say even if a date goes poorly, you can still add them on LinkedIn, and you’re growing your network,” she said.
A sketchier-than-usual sponsorship
Cameron Cayer, a senior majoring in international affairs and a Hatchet reporter, filled out an internship application that he thought was a scam on the platform in a joking manner, but it resulted in a full-fledged sponsorship deal.
“I actually got a DM from an account over the summer, and it said ‘How would you feel about getting free technology and monthly pay for a remote job, and all you have to do is post on Instagram?’” Cayer said.
Despite his skepticism about the seemingly too-good-to-be-true offer, Cayer had applied for what turned out to be a legitimate sponsorship deal with Samsung, which agreed to send him new devices for him to advertise the products on social media in return.
He said this sponsorship deal helped him realize some risky LinkedIn job offers are worth taking after his hesitation to apply could have cost him this once-in-a-blue-moon gig.
“So, my advice is, have a judgmental eye because sometimes they are scams but then other times it can be an opportunity,” he said.
