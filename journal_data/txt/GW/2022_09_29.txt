Hundreds marched down Constitution Avenue Sunday for the Parade of Nations, a celebration of Latino cultures as part of the District’s annual Latin festival.
Fiesta DC marked its 50th anniversary this year as the largest festival celebrating Latino culture in D.C. with two full-day events Saturday and Sunday. At the Parade of Nations Sunday, participants wore the traditional colors and fashion from their home countries in a show of pride during Hispanic Heritage Month.
Here are some scenes from the parade:

Officials said Wednesday that GW has partnered with marketing consultant Sullivan & Company to determine the new moniker after a “competitive” bidding period. 
Officials said they will solicit recommendations and feedback about the University’s moniker change from community members at this year’s Alumni and Families Weekend, according to a release issued Wednesday.
The release states that community members can submit feedback on the change through an online engagement form, and staff will set up a booth in the University Student Center to ask for direction on the moniker decision Thursday and Friday afternoon and Saturday morning. The Board of Trustees announced it would start a “broad University engagement process” to decide on a new moniker by the 2023-24 academic year after trustees voted to retire GW’s nearly century-old Colonials moniker in June, following decades of student activism protesting the symbols’ connection to colonialism, slavery and racial discrimination. 
“Community engagement is truly at the heart of this whole process for developing the new moniker,” Ellen Moran, the newly installed vice president for communications and marketing, said in the release. “From the very beginning, we are striving to ensure that the GW community is the key to creating a moniker that we can all rally around for generations to come.”
Officials also announced the University has partnered with Sullivan & Company – a New York-based marketing consultant that specialized in branding and marketing in the higher education sector – to determine the new moniker after a “competitive” bidding period. Sullivan has been involved with branding projects at Brown, Duke, Columbia and Cornell universities, according to the firm’s website.
The release states that the moniker project team will attend the GW Athletics Hoop Fest to have informal conversations about the symbol with sports fans on Saturday. The release states the moniker project team will also host discussions with University stakeholders and GW archivists and historians to learn more about the University in a “deep, meaningful way.”
“GW was an incredibly formative place for me, and this project is personal – we want to make our school proud,” Alumna Rachel Quintner, a principal at Sullivan said. “I know what it means to be part of the GW community and want to ensure our team gets it right by doing deep research, doing a lot of listening and engaging with all the various constituents. We feel how important it is to find the right moniker that honors our past but also telegraphs something about our future as an institution.”

All the SBA seats are now filled, meaning the senate fully represents law students in each graduating year and each of the six school subdivisions.
The Student Bar Association swore in 11 first-year and transfer senators at the SBA Senate meeting Tuesday following the school’s election last week.
SBA President Nicole Karem presented a report that said between 20 and 90 law students voted in each of the senate races to select first-year and transfer student senators on Sept. 22. The SBA has now filled all their senate seats, meaning the law students in each graduating year and each of the six school subdivisions are represented in the body. 
Executive Vice President Garrett May said because nine of the 11 races were contested, there was “good competition” between candidates.
“There were multiple candidates,” he said. “I would love in the spring to see multiple candidates for every senate position that is running.”
Senators unanimously voted to confirm Katrina Ramkissoon as director of the elections committee after Ramkissoon created the report on the election they held last week.
SBA Sen. John Tuley informed the SBA of a PayPal account that law school organizations had access to that contains $70,000 in potential profits from SBA locker and book sales, but recorded profits from the sales only amounted to about $40,000, $30,000 short of the PayPal funds.
Karem said the rest of the money likely came from SBA events, but there is no way to track which specific organizations made deposits.
“Unfortunately the past administration did not require anyone to say ‘this money is for buying a locker’ when they paid the payout,” Karem said. “So we don’t have any way to technically know, specifically, what each of those payouts is for.”
Tuley said the $70,000 will be used for executive spending after the University cut the executive branch’s budget by $24,000 and redirected funding into the University-wide program fund last year.
SBA Sen. Leila Diallo said the student life committee is working to distribute free menstrual products in law school bathrooms. She said officials will pay for the hygiene products but the committee is working with officials to discuss how to refill dispensers and prevent students from taking too many pads and tampons at once.
Officials installed free menstrual products in restrooms across the Foggy Bottom campus in District House, the Milken Institute School of Public Health, the Elliott School of International Affairs, Gelman Library and Duques Hall last year.
Diallo said she hopes to have an update by the next senate meeting.
“The idea is to give people access to products if they need it,” she said.
The next senate meeting will be held on Oct. 11 at 9:15 p.m. in the Law Learning Center.

The search for a DEI director follows broader efforts to promote diversity and inclusion in the school over the past year, like the Inclusive Excellence Initiative, which officials launched in 2021 to bolster diversity in faculty and curricular offerings.
Columbian College of Arts and Sciences officials said they hope to appoint a diversity, equity and inclusion director for the school this fall.
Kim Gross, the CCAS vice dean for programs and operations, said a search committee of CCAS faculty and staff is working to select finalists for the DEI director position and will invite the finalists for on-campus interviews this fall. The search for a DEI director follows broader efforts to promote diversity and inclusion in CCAS during the past year, like the Inclusive Excellence Initiative, which officials launched in summer 2021 to bolster diversity in the school’s faculty and curricular offerings.
“This search is embedded in our broader commitment to inclusive excellence, which encompasses faculty searches, DEI events and programming, curricular inclusivity and the establishment of the CCAS DEI Council made up of faculty, staff and student representatives charged with advancing DEI initiatives,” Gross said in an email.
A political science professor is no longer teaching a human rights course after he defended racist comments that he made on a phone call with a provost. Students in the class said they filed bias reports after the incident, but feel “frustrated” because of ongoing instances of racism and discrimination across campus.
Gross said the on-campus interviews of the finalists for the DEI director position will include opportunities for “stakeholder groups,” including students, to share feedback on the search.
Gross said the DEI director will develop a strategic plan “grounded” in CCAS’ Inclusive Excellence Initiative. She said the director will also work with CCAS officials, the CCAS DEI council and faculty to provide diverse academic programming and support CCAS officials’ efforts to recruit and retain faculty and staff from marginalized backgrounds.
“This position will further advance the college’s commitment to creating a diverse, equitable and inclusive environment for our students, faculty, staff and other members of our community,” she said.
Officials created a team of 26 students, faculty and administrators in February to review GW’s diversity and propose recommendations to improve campus-wide diversity in spring 2023. The team launched a survey to collect data on the University’s diversity, equity and inclusion climate in April and officials will collect and review additional data and complete their reports on diversity at GW in the fall, according to their website.

The design and manufacture of specific chip designs can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, limiting access to the chips, and these designs aim to make more-affordable versions of chips that are already on the market.
GW is partnering with Google and the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology to manufacture chips to be used for nanotechnology and semiconductor technology, according to a press release issued earlier this month.
GW is one of the five universities, along with the University of Michigan, the University of Maryland, Brown University and Carnegie Mellon University, partnering with Google and NIST in agreement to design the chips. NIST expects to develop at least 40 types of chips that will be “optimized for different applications.”
The designs will be publicly accessible, giving start-up companies, research universities and researchers the freedom to create and expand how the chips can be used.
“By creating a new and affordable domestic supply of chips for research and development, this collaboration aims to unleash the innovative potential of researchers and startups across the nation,” Laurie Locascio, the NIST’s director, said in the release.
The collaboration between Google and NIST was announced before the enactment of the CHIPS for America program, a $50 billion strategy Biden signed in August that is designed to create access to innovation and expand well-paying manufacturing jobs.
The design and manufacture of specific chip designs can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, limiting access to the chips, and these designs aim to make more affordable versions of chips that are already on the market, according to the release. The chips will be designed as industry-standard 200-millimeter discs that are compatible with the manufacturing robots used to increase productivity at semiconductor facilities.
Both NIST and the partnering research universities will design the chips’ circuitry, which will create new specialized structures to work together with existing technologies. The chips’ innovations will be used to improve devices that can be used for memory devices, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, bioelectronics and nanosensors.
“Google has a long history of leadership in open-source,” William Grannis, the CEO of Google Public Sector, said in the release. “Moving to an open-source framework fosters reproducibility, which helps researchers from public and private institutions iterate on each other’s work. It also democratizes innovation in nanotechnology and semiconductor research.”

The panel also discussed the bipartisan gun legislation bill, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which provides funding for community violence interrupters, enhances the gun purchase review process for people under 21.
Two politicians discussed their views on gun control and safety at the School of Media and Public Affairs Tuesday.
Sen. Chris Murphy, D-CT, and former Rep. Will Hurd, R-TX, spoke about the deep polarizations of the American public and Congress and how language and external political forces negatively impact civic engagement on issues like gun safety. The event was moderated by former CBS News correspondent Jacqueline Adams and co-sponsored by nonprofit organization the Common Ground Committee, the Nashman Center for Civic Engagement and Public Service, Bridge GW and The Christian Science Monitor.
Interim University President Mark Wrighton spoke to the audience briefly before the speakers came on stage and touched on his own experience with gun violence.
“I mentored, together with my wife, a young woman for about seven years,” Wrighton said. “And she was murdered by gunfire in St. Louis.”
Hurd, who represented Uvalde, Texas in Congress from 2015 to 2021, said implementing changes in gun laws like age restrictions on weapons purchases begins with finding issues that people on both sides of the political aisle see as something to be solved. He said emotionally charged language, like asking people if their kids should fear school because of potential shootings, does nothing to further talks on the issue, and is only a “trigger” for unproductive arguments.
“That’s why we have to change some of the language in how we talk about this in order to find the things that we ultimately agree upon,” Hurd said.
The panel also discussed the bipartisan gun legislation bill, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which provides funding for community violence interrupters, enhances the gun purchase review process for people under 21, signed into law in late June by President Joe Biden. Murphy, an anti-gun violence advocate who also helped lead negotiations on the bill, said the Uvalde mass shooting, along with years of other mass shootings, forced members of Congress to face their constituents’ calls for reform and prompted bipartisan support.
“Members of the Senate went home and really saw a sense of panic and anxiety from families and kids and parents that they hadn’t seen before,” Murphy said.
Murphy and Hurd then answered questions from the audience on how to shape policy around modern American gun culture. When asked about combating illegal interstate gun trade, Murphy said weak state gun laws in some states attributes to higher shooting and homicide rates in nearby states.
“State laws make a difference,” Murphy said. “The gun homicide rate in Florida is 400 percent higher than the gun homicide rate in Connecticut.”
When questioned by another audience member on how the U.S. will face the future of gun control as weapons like 3D-printed guns rise in prominence, Hurd said the U.S.’ moves on policy surrounding these weapons are related to Americans’ faith in the institutions which run the country and whether possible regulations will be enforced by them.
“Access to weapon is a part of this problem,” Hurd said. “And it’s not the only part and that’s why some of these other issues have to be tackled as well.”

Infiltrating the halls of campus buildings, a highly controversial direct sales company that former employees have called a pyramid scheme, is targeting students desperate for a wage. Posters advertising a lucrative employment opportunity with a base pay of $25 per hour hang in hallways and classrooms on posters and whiteboards from Funger Hall in Foggy Bottom to West Hall on the Mount Vernon Campus. They claim to offer full- and part-time positions and working hours without any previous experience required. The only thing missing? An explanation of the work itself. The only description is a vague label that reads “Customer sales/service” near the bottom of each poster. But the truth behind these posters is darker than one may think at first glance.
Headlining the posters, you’ll find the name Vector Marketing, a sales company that promotes cutlery. With a self-reported employee base of nearly 85 percent college students, Vector Marketing sustains the growth of its company with a revolving door of easily replaceable young adults who are prone to be fired or forced into quitting. After reading the controversial reviews about the company, I wanted to see for myself what working at the establishment was really like. From my experience, I can attest to the company’s exploitation of its workers through a hostile work environment that takes advantage of students on campus.
It often felt like Vector Marketing cared more about saving money and resources than spending time on preparing me for my job. I expected to gain experience in sales but ended up just feeling overwhelmed and didn’t learn anything substantial about marketing. This system is so deeply intertwined within the operations of Vector Marketing that prospective employees need not submit an application, but just sign up for a group interview with as many as 20 individuals who joined without even saying a single word to their employer. At a subsequent three-day mandatory training session, the company attempts to sell its employees on the dream of earning thousands of dollars with ease and $1,000 within three days without much focus on marketing strategies.
The truth is, Vector Marketing’s impressive claim of a $25 an hour wage is misleading. One of the only conditions in which Vector Marketing is required to pay its employees is when they earn commission from a sale – which starts at a base rate of 10 percent per sale – or for every hour when employees physically demonstrate the quality of their products, like CutCo knives, during a formal appointment. But the regional manager clarified none of these facts during the interview. In 1992, Wisconsin consumer protection investigators found that Vector Marketing employees made an average of less than $3 a day. Nearly half of all the company’s employees in Wisconsin either earn zero weekly pay or lose money because of costs for supplies, according to the investigators.
Unfeasible and stress-inducing sales deadlines made me feel like I was set up for failure. The company expects six sales of roughly $600 each within the first week. Additionally, staff expect employees to find 10 more leads for potential clients after each successful sale. Missing these deadlines could mean termination from the company, harassment from supervisors or even being forced to make up the difference, according to some former employees’ personal experiences. Unreliable pay is particularly insidious with a workforce made of college students who are particularly vulnerable to job and wealth insecurity. At a time when college debt is at an all-time high and many inexperienced young adults struggle to make ends meet, they need a stable source of support and income. But all Vector Marketing provides is a false promise of riches, and all they demand in return is an immense amount of time and effort.
Vector Marketing thrives on the concept of riding the thin line between legal and illegal business practices – namely the many lawsuits against them for refusing to compensate employees for time spent in training. From its intrusive advertising practices on campus to the exploitation of its employees, Vector Marketing is a predator organization at its heart. Students should spread awareness to fight back against the immoral business practices of the company. A quick Google search of “Vector Marketing” results in several articles exposing the business as a scam and barely legal. Don’t let them obfuscate the truth behind layers of false legitimacy and aggressive student advertising. Tear down the posters, erase the ads and always make sure that you fully understand exactly what kind of business you are getting into, instead of letting your future be sold to you in an interview.

In Loyola Chicago’s first year in the A-10 they have gone 2–1 so far, while the Colonials have netted two losses and two ties in conference play.
Women’s soccer fell to Loyola Chicago 3-0 in the first-ever matchup between the two programs following the Ramblers’ integration into the Atlantic 10 last fall.
The Colonials (3-2-5) were unable to get any real offensive momentum against the Ramblers (6-3-2) near the box throughout the game, only firing three shots on goal and one corner kick on the day. Both teams fought at midfield for the majority of the game, where Loyola countered and managed to get out in front of the GW defense on two of their three scores.
Frequent change of possession defined the first minutes of the game as both sides began to get a feel for their offensive attacks. The Ramblers got their first corner kick of the game in the sixth minute, launching a floater into the box that was successfully deflected by the Colonials.
Just a minute later, Loyola Chicago was able to reset their offense and attack again.
Ramblers junior forward Sarah Noonan received the ball on the right side to draw GW freshman goalkeeper Grace Crowe out of the net before sidestepping and tapping a simple pass to fellow forward Megan Nemac who easily found the back of the net.
Sophomore forward Kelly Poole launched GW’s first shot of the match in the 18th minute with a long one from straight on, collected by Ramblers goalie Naya Lipkens. The Colonials attacked again, but graduate student forward Rachel Sorkken was flagged for an offsides penalty.
With 11 minutes to go in the first half, GW gained a free kick in Ramblers’ territory that senior Isabelle Eskay took for the Colonials’ fourth shot of the game.
After Loyola managed to clear the ball, freshman midfielder Aoi Kataoka slipped the Ramblers’ defense for a one-on-one matchup that would give the Colonials arguably their best chance to score of the game with an open box, but the Loyola goalkeeper tipped the ball out.
With seven minutes to go, Loyola Chicago gained its fifth corner kick of the game, setting up another opportunity to get one in the box. Sophomore midfielder Jaimee Cibulka found the net coming off a pass from freshman defense Emily Roberts to extend the Ramblers lead to 2–0.
Neither team would have another major scoring chance before the end of the half. GW trailed Loyola Chicago in shots 6–5 while the Ramblers outpaced the Colonials in corner kicks 5–1.
The second half opened with Loyola Chicago on the kickoff, and the midfield possession battles continued. Just three minutes in, the Ramblers kicked another shot on goal, striking the crossbar before GW managed to clear the ball back to Loyola Chicago territory.
Crowe, who has played every minute of conference play this year, had her hands full during the match as the Colonials allowed a season high 18 shots, and the aggressive Rambler offense continued through the beginning of the second half.
After repelling a series of Loyola offensives, Eskay gained a free kick in Ramblers territory with 22 minutes to go, which she floated toward the goal before Lipkens collected the attempt. Sorkken was able to get in even better position after a foul and set up what would be GW’s last best chance to score, firing a cross to senior midfielder Tori Minda that just escaped the right post by about a foot.
In the 74th minute, Crowe made two quick saves in succession out of her total of four on the day. Four minutes later, the Ramblers put the match on ice after Amanda Cassidy tapped in a cross that gave Loyola Chicago a 3–0 lead.
The Ramblers shifted into a conservative defensive posture, content to milk out the rest of the clock. In Loyola Chicago’s first year in the A-10 they have gone 2–1 so far, while the Colonials have netted two losses and two ties in conference play.
GW will play their next match on Sept. 29 at conference rival Dayton starting at 7 p.m.

I opted for the Crunchy Boi ($15), a signature sub with turkey, provolone, shredded lettuce, garlic mayo, oil and vinegar and the star of the show – potato chips, a relatively childish combination that my inner five year old could simply not ignore. 
A classic New York or New Jersey-style deli might be hard to come by in a city like D.C., but burrowed in the midst of Dupont’s many culinary offerings is Compliments Only, a nostalgic sub shop with a memorable menu featuring quintessential Italian ingredients.
Located on P Street in Dupont after opening in June 2022, Compliments Only sits nestled between the area’s picturesque townhouses and facades. The menu leans into this aura, with Italian cold cuts like capicola and genoa featured on multiple of their signature sandwiches.
The downstairs space might seem small on the outside, but a wide-open expanse and plentiful seating allow customers to enjoy their meal in the cozy dining area. Alternatively, patrons can take their sandwich outside to one of Dupont’s many public eating areas, like the long benches around the perimeter of the circle.
At first, I wasn’t too impressed by the relatively simple interior of the restaurant. But as I took a closer look, I noticed the decor gave off more of a charming air, with campy paintings of vegetables and shelves with random knick knacks showcasing far more personality than you’d expect from a typical sandwich shop.
Despite being in the heart of the District, you could easily mistake Compliments Only for a classic New Jersey deli with retro drink and snack logos, an old-school ticket dispenser for ordering and bar-style seating along the brick wall.
The menu is exclusively sandwiches, but Compliments Only does provide several options in the form of signature subs and ingredients for building your own sandwich, so even the most anti-Italian customers can still find a sub they’re likely to enjoy. Ingredients available include classic meats like turkey, ham and salami, veggies like hot peppers, cucumbers and tomatoes and sauces like Dijon mustard and mayo ($10 to $21.75).
The build your own section only really matters if you somehow don’t find a worthy option in the signature sub section, which sports delectable options like the Marisa Tomei Eats Free, a stockpile of capicola, genoa, mozzarella, basil and arugula salad and honey chili aioli ($14.5), and the Farmers Market After Dark, made with cucumber, hot and sweet peppers, onion, arugula, shredded lettuce, green goddess dressing, oil and vinegar ($11.5).
I opted for the Crunchy Boi ($15), a signature sub with turkey, provolone, shredded lettuce, garlic mayo, oil and vinegar and the star of the show – potato chips, a relatively childish combination that my inner five year old could simply not ignore. The sandwich came within five minutes, and I soon found myself seated outside eager to eat, watching the pedestrians and cars of Dupont race by me in the early afternoon rush.
The first thing that popped out was the sheer amount of lettuce, a staple of Northeast sandwiches that immediately made me feel at home. As I took my first bite, I knew the sandwich lived up to its name – this was, in fact, a crunchy boi. The softness of the lettuce, bread and turkey blended exquisitely with the stable crunch of the potato chips.
The most unexpected element of the sandwich was the mayo, which the staff certainly didn’t shy away from using. Creamy, rich in flavor and seemingly everywhere, it was the perfect compliment to the already-solid ingredients featured.
The bread also pleasantly surprised me – its fluffy interior and crispy exterior far surpassed an Italian loaf you might find at a chain sandwich joint like Subway. Finally, the potato chips solidly earned their place among the ingredients, adding the necessary texture needed to complete an already-delicious sandwich.
With a charming interior, stacked menu and unbeatable deli vibe, Compliments Only is a worthwhile stop for any day spent in Dupont.

As bright blue lights flashed on stage, MUNA opened their set with their hit track “What I Want,” a fun-loving, energetic anthem about abandoning long-standing societal restrictions.
Indie pop three-member band MUNA brought their North American tour to the 9:30 Club Monday, delivering a dynamic and personal performance that marked the group’s second sold-out show at the venue within a week.
The sold-out crowd, many of them devoted fans who saw MUNA on the same tour last week, created the optimal high-energy setting for the band to perform songs from their third self-titled album “MUNA” as well as fan favorites from their sophomore effort and their debut album. Although MUNA has been on the music scene since 2016, the band reached unprecedented success last year with their viral hit “Silk Chiffon,” which amassed over 31 million streams on Spotify featuring the widely adored Phoebe Bridgers.
As bright blue lights flashed on stage, MUNA opened their set with their hit track “What I Want,” a fun-loving, energetic anthem about abandoning long-standing societal restrictions. The song sent a visceral reaction through the crowd – evidently, “What I Want” was the right choice as an opening song. The band continued with “Number One Fan,” the lead single from their sophomore album, “Saves The World.” The crowd expectedly sang along to every word of the song with lines like “I would give my life just to hold your hand” – an ode to the fan culture playing out below the stage.
After singing the 80s-inspired synth-pop track “Solid,” lead singer and co-producer Katie Gavin greeted and thanked the crowd, acknowledging many familiar faces from the band’s first show in D.C. last Tuesday. She then transitioned into “Stayaway,” followed by the slower “Runner’s High” and “No Idea,” relaxing the ecstatic crowd.
One of the most memorable moments of the concert came when the band played their 2019 track “Pink Light.” Fans all around the crowd passed out bright pink cardstock squares for them to hold over their phone flashlights when Gavin reaches the lyrics “But there’s a pink light in my apartment.” The fans did just that, creating a pink hue around an already lit-up stage, matching its shade. The moment showcased the powerful sense of community created by unapologetic, honest musicians, like the members of MUNA, who develop genuine connections with their fans.
After the song concluded, an emotional and surprised Gavin said “That’s never happened to us before,” in reference to the stunning pink display of light from the crowd. Before she could elaborate, a fan in the front row handed her a gold paper crown that Gavin placed atop her head. “We love you and we wouldn’t be doing this without you,” Gavin affectionately told the crowd.
She transitioned into the ballad “Loose Garment” – which she described to the audience as representing “having a really tender relationship with those moments of suffering” – before playing “If U Love Me Now,” one of the band’s very first songs, as the stage lights radiated a deep purple hue.
Pulling out an acoustic guitar, Gavin introduced the country-inspired introspective ballad “Kind of Girl” as the orange stage lights glowed above her, matching her vibrant red hair.
“This is a song that we wrote about learning to be really conscious about the words we use to describe ourselves,” Gavin said, before dedicating the song to queer people in the audience.
MUNA continued the ballad section of their set with “Taken,” an emotional song about falling for someone who is already in a relationship and struggling with self-worth. Slowly transitioning to more upbeat songs for the final third of the show, Gavin happily danced and twirled around the stage to “Home By Now,” a fan favorite from their self-titled album featuring synth-pop melodies.
One of the most lively and dynamic moments of the entire show came during the next two-song run of MUNA’s optimistic breakup anthem “Anything But Me” followed by a cover of  The Killers’ “Mr. Brightside.” The fiery and passionate crowd screamed both at the top of their lungs, sending the club to a new level of euphoria. Gavin put on the fan’s paper crown again for the latter track but danced so hard that it flew off by the song’s second chorus. Unsurprisingly, she didn’t miss a beat.
After one of the most enthusiastic and impassioned live performances I have witnessed, MUNA introduced their hit song from their debut album, “I Know A Place,” which Gavin said was one of the first songs they wrote together as a band. She told the crowd the track was inspired by “hopeful rage that they could find a place to express themselves.” She elaborated that while this struggle has persisted in many ways since the band wrote the song, they are grateful to their fans for creating a space for them.
After “I Know A Place,” the band seemingly left the stage in a hurry, causing some confusion among the crowd. After fans excitedly chanted “MUNA” for about a minute, the group came back on stage to perform a two-song encore. With acoustic guitars, the band played “Shooting Star,” the optimistic final track on their third album, as beams of light glimmered across the audience, projected from the mirror ball hanging over the stage.
Finally, MUNA played the song every member of the audience had been awaiting since they arrived on stage – “Silk Chiffon.” Though Bridgers was not present to sing her verse, keyboard and electric guitar player Naomi McPherson took over with vocals, amassing boisterous cheers from the crowd. The upbeat, energetic track was the necessary culmination to their 17-song setlist, and the pure joy coursing through the audience was contagious, lasting even after the attendees began to leave the venue.
The District clearly has an affinity for MUNA. With an electrifying and dynamic performance, the band managed to foster a personal connection with every member of the audience while simultaneously commanding the crowd as one entity. MUNA is undoubtedly coming into their true form as a group, with each member visibly more confident than ever. Their third album is certainly aptly titled – this is the most “MUNA” the band has ever felt.
