The search for a new director of the Graduate School of Political Management was a year-long drama, characterized by a disillusioned faculty who sought involvement in the decision. Then-Dean of the College of Professional Studies Kathleen Burke had originally required that the director hold a terminal degree, a rule that also drew complaints from faculty and led to the rejection of some potentially strong GSPM leaders. Overall, the hiring process was one mired by poor leadership that was allegedly untrue to the essence of the school. This saga has finally come to a close with the hire of former Congressman Mark Kennedy, R-Minn., and we wish him well as the director of the prestigious and first-of-its kind school.

It’s a new year, and we’re still telling ourselves that we’ll be hitting HelWell often to finally get in shape. But students, who often juggle internships and student organizations along with classes, are busy during the day, and they should still be able to access the gym after hours. The fact that Lerner Health and Wellness Center will now close right at 11:30 p.m. is frustrating for our health-concious contingent – particularly when several other schools offer 24-hour access to their gyms.

University Police officers are now stationed in some upperclassman residence halls at night, a reassuring new policy in light of recent events of non-University affiliated people entering residence halls by piggybacking. But this policy remains inconsistent; often UPD officers are nowhere to be seen at night in a few of the residence halls. Indeed, placing UPD officers every night in some of the upperclassman residence halls is a major undertaking, but it is worrisome that after launching this initiative, the officers are still so often missing from their stations. The piggybacking incidents led to some dangerous results – a man allegedly entered City Hall last year and attempted to sexually assault a female student – so this service is clearly one that is necessary for student safety. Hopefully the University will take measures to ensure more consistent coverage for the officers in these halls.

The Student Association has provided students with two excellent cost-saving services this semester: four weeks of complimentary New York Times issues in the Marvin Center and reduced-cost printing – down from 9 cents to 7 cents – in Gelman and Eckles libraries. The Collegiate Readership Program, which ended this year, might not be revived in its full form, but allowing students the ability to pick up free copies of the Times is an important service. Both of these are major achievements for the SA and demonstrate the power of continued lobbying on behalf of student concerns. Now we can really say that the SA gave students their two cents.

It’s Super Bowl Week, and we’re excited to spend Sunday watching football and consuming massive amounts of  beer and pizza. But the Boston and New York fans who dominate campus are particularly obnoxious this year, and we secretly wish Tebow had gone all the way.

A student leader is pushing back against a new policy at the Lerner Health and Wellness Center that cuts late-night workout hours.
Complaints from students cropped up early this semester after the gym began kicking patrons out at 11:30 p.m., an hour and a half earlier than in past years.
While the gym’s official 11:30 closing time remains the same, the previously lax approach to clearing exercisers from the building has been replaced this semester with a firmer rule designed to make the center’s operations more efficient.
Now with a “hard-close” at 11:30 p.m., all those working out or staffing the gym will be required to leave.
Student Association Senator Josh Goldstein, U-CCAS, plans to meet with Associate Athletic Director Andre Julien next week to attempt to forge a compromise on the hours.
Goldstein said he hopes “to make a solution that works for everyone,” adding anecdotally that the 11 p.m. to midnight time frame was popular for many students. He decided to take on the issue after hearing about 10 complaints from students that the new hours restricted their ability to fit exercise into their school and work schedules.
But a spokesperson for the Athletics and Recreation Department said, after a review of the building’s operations last fall, staff learned that the gym was infrequently used after 11:30 p.m.
Brian Sereno, executive director for athletics communications, described the review as an “ongoing assessment of our efficiencies.”
“To ensure peak efficiency and staffing during the hours the center is used, we decided to close operations at 11:30 p.m.,” he said. “The expenditures to operate the facility as compared to the relatively low number of users after 11:30 p.m. does not justify staying open any later.”
Sereno declined to provide an estimate of how much money would be saved by stopping operations earlier in the evenings, but emphasized that the new policy was geared toward “efficiency of financial and human resources – not strictly about saving money.” 
Sophomore and Lerner Health and Wellness employee Nike John estimated about 15 or 20 students per night had utilized the facilities during the late-night hours. John, who sometimes works the closing shift at the gym, said she turned away upset students who didn’t know about the change.
The gym at West Hall will remain open 24 hours a day by the end of January, Mount Vernon Campus Life announced last week in its weekly newsletter. Students can access the facility by tapping a GWorld.
The gym – much smaller than its Foggy Bottom counterpart – opened last fall.

The University’s refashioned student life arm has developed broad themes to steer programming for its four class-year-focused teams over the next semester.
Since the launch of the student services umbrella organization last fall, the Center for Student Engagement’s four teams spent months gauging the needs of their specific populations – freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors, and graduate and off-campus students.
This spring, leaders in the center will begin gradually aligning each class year’s services and programs into six central goals that were informed by a University-wide research phase last fall that included focus groups, surveys and conversations with students.
The themes, designed to standardize CSE policies across class years, are transitions, personal improvement, community building, residential experience, extracurricular engagement and leadership development. This framework will help the teams ensure they are offering support to the many areas of student development, the center’s director, Tim Miller, said.
“Everything from now on will reflect these six things,” Miller, who is also the associate dean of students, said. “These are what students need across every single year.”
While he does not want to drastically alter services mid-year, Miller said the gradual rollout of services and programs is part of the organization’s “concerted effort to not look or feel all that different” to students.
The most visible change can be seen in student life operations, where different parts of the CSE are now more tightly connected than before – a link that Miller said facilitates stronger communication among formerly distinct departments. The CSE brings together staff from across the Dean of Freshmen Office, the Guide to Personal Success program, the Student Activities Center, Mount Vernon Campus Life and Housing Programs.
To support more programming, Student and Academic Support Services will make its case for added financial support for the branches it oversees, including CSE, at February’s Board of Trustees meeting, Robert Chernak, senior vice president and head of SASS, said earlier this month. Chernak declined to comment on whether the CSE’s current budget was lower than operationally necessary but said “there have been deficiencies in some of our departments.”
Miller added that the teams will face a challenge in integrating the six principles into their class-based services, because few colleges across the country operate under similar models. For every university consolidating student resources, the team found another school breaking them apart, he said.
“We couldn’t find this model at many other places, so we’re breaking new ground,” Miller said. “It’s both good and scary.”
The CSE’s emphasis on student transitions is one example of a common goal between class years. Miller explained that freshmen, study abroad students and students entering the job market all go through major adjustments in their lifestyles that require support.
The Third and Fourth Year Experience team has begun working with the Office for Study Abroad to further develop existing activities to help students segue back to campus, such as welcome back events for members of GW’s Focus on Fall Abroad Community.
Vernon Williams, director of the team, said last semester’s information gathering “helped us prioritize and fine tune other areas” and, based on the results, the group will put an emphasis on service opportunities, career exploration and graduate school preparation as it continues its programming in the spring.
Alongside career services staff, Williams’ team hosted a gap-year event Jan. 26 for graduating seniors considering taking time off before entering the workforce. The group is also planning to hold graduate and professional education seminars in conjunction with Kaplan Test Prep this spring.
A major focus for the CSE is bringing attention to GW’s budding graduate student body, a population that University President Steven Knapp has highlighted throughout his tenure. From 2007 to 2010, the number of students seeking graduate degrees has climbed by about 4 percent.
Andrew Goretsky, director of the Graduate, Distance and Professional Student Experience, said his department will coordinate more social programming, after learning from graduate students on Foggy Bottom and the Virginia Science and Technology Campus that they lacked opportunities to meet students outside of their school.
The team is also working on a centralized website that will function like a virtual Colonial Central for off-campus students, offering virtual office hours for students unable to meet in person.
“[Graduate, distance and professional] students are coming from all over the D.C. metro area and many are taking classes virtually from around the world,” Goretsky said. “This will increase our accessibility and ability to connect with the GDP population.
The first year team, led by Jeffrey Llewellyn, will bolster its traditionally strong support for freshmen by connecting students to internship, research and fellowship opportunities around campus with the help of the Center for Undergraduate Fellowships and Research and the GW Career Center.

Few black people at GW can avoid what I call those ill-fated “black moments,” whether it’s a racially insensitive remark from a peer or a missing GWorld.
See, I can still remember the look of skepticism on my fellow City Hall resident’s face as I tried to explain to her I was a student who lost his GWorld and needed to get into his residence hall. She thought I was just another person on the street auditioning for a role in the newest crime alert.
Black people still face adversity that many Americans refuse to acknowledge, especially within the echelons of academia. At GW, racism is an ever-present elephant in the room.
But students of all races need to know that the black community is one with pride. And this February, the black community will share that pride and history with the greater community through the annual Black Heritage Celebration. This year’s theme, Bleeding Black, speaks to that pride in the black experience. These events are not exclusive to black people, and as members of this diverse community, it is imperative that all students take time from the quick pace of college life to attend at least one event. Despite cultural differences within the black community, our sense of responsibility to our families and the rest of the global black community brings us together.
It’s hard to understand how there is still a level of ignorance that allowed a GW Patriot writer in 2008 to criticize the Student Association for allocating funds to the Black Heritage Celebration or prompted the Young America’s Foundation to hold an anti-affirmative action bake sale last spring.
These instances only prove that the entire community has work to do before GW is truly a campus without hate. This generation of young and educated black people has provided ample opportunities for the student body to create an honest forum for discussion and sharing knowledge, especially in “Real Conversations,” an event series with different topics often co-hosted by the Student Activities Center (now known as the Center for Student Engagement) and black organizations. Yet despite these opportunities for dialogue, that discussion has rarely involved people who are not black, other than members of the panel.
All that can easily change this February. No matter your racial or ethnic background, celebrate black history with GW’s black community. Immerse yourself in the culture, and learn about a history often overlooked. This is a critical step in building a more progressive and truly inclusive campus.

There are few things more frustrating in collegiate life than constructing your class schedule.
As I sat in my room this holiday break, tweaking my schedule for spring semester and scanning a long list of open courses, I had a familiar epiphany: There are a number of economics and science classes that I would like to take but won’t, as they might hurt my GPA.
The truth is, the University’s current pass/fail policy has students running scared when it should be encouraging and inviting them to experiment academically. All too often, students are given no incentives to take academic risks. This should not be the case. As a solution, the provost’s office should encourage students to take intellectual risks by expanding the current policy to allow all students to take two general curriculum requirements pass/fail.
As the policy currently stands, many schools allow upperclassmen to take their electives pass/fail. But despite this option, pass/fail is still not a popular or integral part of the university’s academic community or culture.
It should be.
While it makes sense that the pass/fail policy be used for electives, schools should extend this option to the general curriculum requirements. Take for example, a student in the Columbian College who needs to fulfill a science or math GCR. Students might decide to take a more challenging chemistry or calculus course if they had reassurance that their hard work would be evaluated on a pass/fail basis.
Often a student’s undergraduate education feels like a long list of requirements and years devoted to bolstering one’s GPA. But let’s not forget that the real purpose of college is to give students a chance to obtain a broad based education. One’s years as an undergraduate should be a time when students are encouraged to step outside of their comfort zones and take academic risks.
Of course, extending GW’s pass/fail option would create opportunities for students to slack off. With 10,000 undergraduates, some would undoubtedly try to abuse the system. To combat this problem, the University should insist that all students who elect to take a GCR pass/fail gain approval from their academic advisors.
Providing students more freedom to shape and cultivate their own education will allow them to take intellectual and academic risks that they might not have previously thought possible. This kind of academic personalization will give students the chance to capitalize on the value of their college experience and to broaden their undergraduate education.
As much as I’d like to take an economics class, I won’t. And that’s a shame.

NEW YORK – If you ask Nemanja Mikic, he probably wouldn’t say that the best part of his game against Fordham Saturday afternoon was the four three-pointers he drained.
They were sweet shots, carving through the air, some passing through the net without so much as brushing the rim. But they left Mikic unimpressed.
If you asked Mikic, he probably wouldn’t highlight any portion of his game as being particularly outstanding, a combination of his quiet, humble nature and his remaining distaste for GW’s 63-58 loss to the Rams. Looking past the final score and examining the forward’s aggressive performance in the game, there were signs of an increasingly heads-up play the sophomore has been bringing to the court this season – pointing to a rapidly developing skill set.
“I just pretty much try hard. Just become better, a better defensive player,” Mikic said. “Just a better player in general.”
Against Fordham, Mikic was dominant at the glass, pulling down a team-high seven boards, including six defensive rebounds that clearly point to the time he and GW’s coaching staff have spent working on developing his game. Last season, Mikic averaged 2.7 rebounds per game, a benchmark he’s echoed this season. His presence in the paint is tangible, highlighted by a more aggressive nature that often sees the forward swiftly applying heavy pressure as soon as his opponent touches the ball.
Last season, Mikic was known as a hot-handed three-point shooter, pacing all Division I freshmen in three-point shooting percentage. But as scouting reports caught up with him, he found himself increasingly limited from long range. Mikic worked to develop a more varied offensive attack, pushing himself to become a dangerous shooter from all areas of the floor. This year, the demands of a new system have pushed the forward to focus instead on his defense, working to fill the role envisioned by new head coach Mike Lonergan.
Lonergan builds his teams around the post. He emphasizes the importance of being dominant on the glass to execute an offensive attack, and demands his team shut down an opponent’s attack with commanding control of defensive rebounds. One of the most important statistics in a game, Lonergan believes, is the other team’s shooting percentage – a statistic GW can limit by flexing its muscles on defensive boards.
Faced with a new coaching style, the Colonials have struggled to implement Lonergan’s defense-first method, highlighted by a seven-game slide in December and four straight A-10 road losses. Sitting in Fordham’s press room after dropping yet another game away from the Smith Center, Lonergan was frustrated by his team’s performance, but he identified Mikic’s play as a bright spot. The forward’s defensive growth is exactly what Lonergan wants to see from the rest of his team.
“I’m also looking with Nemanja and guys to the future, and Nemanja’s the one guy that’s showing improvement. I mean the last eight games, I’d say he’s really become a pretty good defender, when a few months ago he was probably our worst defender,” Lonergan said. “And he’s started to score, which is nice, because we need his scoring.”
Mikic’s scoring is still perhaps the most visible part of his game, his reputation preceding him to the court. Saturday’s game marked his third-straight in double-digits, and Mikic said he’s focused on furthering his skills at both ends of the court. Mikic wants to be a true threat on the court striving, he said, “to be a better basketball player.” As his performance improves, Mikic takes the court with a greater confidence, using pump-fakes and pick-and-rolls to beat defenders, and setting up chances for his teammates with increasing ease.
“Nemanja’s at that level, but we have to get everybody back,” Lonergan said. “We have to get everybody to a higher level.”
Late in the first half against Fordham, Mikic zipped a hard pass to junior forward Dwayne Smith, who spun, dribbled and drove in for a layup. It was a play crafted by Mikic, who glimpsed an opening and set his teammate up to score.
It was an unselfish move from a player exhibiting an eye for the game. And if you ask Mikic, that was probably one of the best parts of his play Saturday afternoon.

Head coach Mike Bozeman is known for his candid quotes. It was ironic, then, that he chose to borrow a phrase from arguably one of the least quotable figures in sports to describe the challenges his team faces with its depleted roster.
 “I learned something from the head coach in New England: ‘Everybody’s good,’ ” Bozeman said with a chuckle, referring to Patriots head coach Bill Belichick.
Bozeman’s teams have struggled with injuries for the past three seasons, as one-by-one his players were forced to the sidelines in their warm-up gear by a series of ailments that are classified as freak coincidences at best.
The Colonials were able to dress only six players for Saturday’s game against Dayton, the same number that took the court against Saint Louis Wednesday. But unlike the gutsy win over the Billikens, the Colonials (10-11) couldn’t grab a victory over the Flyers, falling 74-56 Saturday afternoon at the Smith Center.
GW fell behind early in the game, trailing 16-4 just over six minutes into the contest. The team couldn’t recover from the early hole, working all game to overcome its slow start.
“I think the energy was fine. The execution and how we started off from the beginning of the game,” junior point guard Danni Jackson said. “We just dug ourselves deep, and we couldn’t get out of it.”
Usually the team’s offensive firepower, Jackson struggled from the field Saturday, shooting just 3-for-18. She finished the game with nine points, seven rebounds and five assists, but with the bench down to one player, the junior’s most impressive stat was her 40 minutes of playing time.
That high amount of playing time isn’t ideal, and Bozeman knows his team needs to capitalize on the minutes in the game when players are the most rested. Learning to build on those crucial moments, he said, is key in adjusting to the depleted roster.
“What we were talking about in the locker room after the game was the start of the game and the start of both halves,” Bozeman said. “We have to get better in those five-minute spurts in order for us to stay or to capitalize on our quickness and our abilities against these teams.”
The Colonials were outscored by 12 in the paint and bested by 12 on the boards. GW had no answer for Dayton’s dominant presence under the net, particularly guard Andrea Hoover, who dropped 22 points and grabbed eight rebounds for the Flyers, pushing Dayton to its 44.3-percent shooting from the field.
Senior forward/guard Tara Booker lead the team in points, netting 13, and in rebounds, pulling down nine. Junior forward Megan Nipe and senior guard Tiana Myers each added 12 points – Myers falling one point shy of reaching the 1,000-point mark for her career, and freshman guard Chakecia Miller added 10 points of her own. The Colonials closed the day shooting 31.3 percent, unable to capitalize on 19 Dayton turnovers.
The Colonials next head to St. Bonaventure Feb. 4, with tip set for 1 p.m., and the team isn’t ready to give up quite yet, Jackson said.
“I think we need to just keep going to the hot hand. We have a lot of shooters on the team, especially with these six, everyone can score,” Jackson said.

International students will face fewer barriers to studying in the United States because of a recent effort by President Barack Obama to simplify visa applications.
An executive order issued Jan. 19 is designed to encourage travel and tourism in the U.S. and spark economic growth for American businesses.
“Every year, tens of millions of tourists from all over the world come and visit America. And the more folks who visit America, the more Americans we get back to work,” Obama said.
The changes – which aim to cut backend waiting time for visa applicants – mark the easing of more stringent restrictions imposed on the student visa process after Sept. 11, 2001, director of GW’s International Services Office Greg Leonard said.
“The more multicultural the GW student body, the better the University can prepare its students to live and thrive in an increasingly multicultural world,” he said.
Universities nationwide, including GW, have ramped up efforts in recent years to attract more international students – who generally pay full tuition – while American students increasingly demonstrate higher need for financial aid in the face of the recession.
International student enrollment in the U.S. increased 5 percent to reach more than 723,000 students in the 2010 to 2011 academic year, according to the most recent Open Doors report by the Institute of International Education.
Foreign students still make up less than 4 percent of all college enrollments – representing a largely untapped market for American universities.
“Streamlining our processes and procedures and making them more user-friendly for students and visitors will save them time and money and encourage them to choose the United States as their higher education destination,” President and CEO of the Institute of International Education Allan Goodman said.
The executive order tasked the departments with interviewing 80 percent of non-immigrant visa applicants within three weeks of submission, expediting the overall process.
Obama also charged the Departments of State and Homeland Security to expand the Visa Waiver Program, which allows travelers from 36 pre-approved countries, including the United Kingdom and Japan, to enter the U.S. without a visa for stays of fewer than 90 days. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton nominated Taiwan to join the waiver program in conjunction with Obama’s executive order, according to the White House release.
Last semester, more than 2,500 international students were enrolled in undergraduate and graduate programs at the University – a figure Leonard said he hopes to see grow. International students represent 12 percent of GW’s total student population, according to data from The Office of Institutional Research and Planning.
“In many programs, the goal is to have an appropriate balance of U.S. and international students to best prepare all students to function professionally in an environment that is increasingly global in nature,” Leonard said.
This academic year, the largest populations of international students at GW are from China, South Korea and India, internal data show.

NEW YORK – As his shot ricocheted into a scramble for the rebound, senior guard Tony Taylor sank to the floor.
Just seconds before, Taylor had pulled up for a crucial open three, releasing an arching ball without tearing his eyes away from the net. The shot clanged off the rim, and with four seconds left, Taylor knew the game was over.
He dropped to a crouch, head in his hands, getting back up only to bend over again. It was a gut-wrenching miss, the kind that forces the bottom to drop out of a player’s stomach. Junior guard Lasan Kromah walked across the court, pulling his captain back to his feet with a steadying hand on Taylor’s shoulder.
“Coach drew up a great play, gave me the ball and I just thought I was going to make it,” Taylor said. “It just hurt me a lot. I just missed the shot that could have tied the game up and gone to overtime.”
Taylor’s shot was the final salvo in a rally that started after a media timeout with just under six minutes to play. Down seven, the Colonials (8-13) returned to the court to embark on a 7-0 run, tying the game at 51 off junior forward Dwayne Smith’s driving layup.
“I think we just realized that there was five, six minutes left and we have to bring our best effort and play as hard as we can and try to get a run,” sophomore forward Nemanja Mikic said.
The teams traded baskets, tying once more at 53 and then again at 55. But a slew of late fouls sent Fordham to the line for valuable points, and the Colonials were stuffed on their last chances of the game.
When the buzzer sounded on the five-point defeat, GW exited the court dropping its fourth straight A-10 road game, yet to win a league match away from the Smith Center this season.
“I thought we were going to be a little better in the first half. I didn’t expect to be down, chasing them the whole game,” head coach Mike Lonergan said. “They did a good job. We battled all the way back. It takes a lot of energy to take the lead, and then they come right back down and just drive on us and get a three-point play out of it.”
There were pockets of strong defense from the Colonials Saturday afternoon, highlighted by an aggressive man-to-man effort that GW switched into after starting the day in a full-court press. On a few possessions, junior guard Bryan Bynes forced his man to backtrack to the halfcourt mark. On others, the Rams couldn’t get around the Colonials for open looks and were forced to hand the ball over as the shot clock sounded.
GW’s pressure translated into sloppy play from Fordham, who turned it over 21 times and allowed the Colonials to snag 10 steals on the day. GW converted those turnovers into 33 points, but it wasn’t enough to cement a victory.
“We’ve got to get other guys to understand that defense and rebounding are really what is going to win games. And effort. And we gave effort today, we’ve just got to put the ball in the basket, too. I’m disappointed for Tony, because he’s from here, and he played today,” Lonergan said. “I’m his biggest critic at times. He’s our best player – he should be one of the best players in the league – but today he played. And that’s what you’re supposed to do.”
It was another game where lackluster shooting doomed the Colonials, who shot just 33.3 percent from the floor on the game. The team had slightly better luck from beyond the arc – shooting 45 percent from the perimeter, but stepping outside the arc alone couldn’t make up for 19-of-57 shooting, a continuation of GW’s tendencies to go cold on the road.
Playing his last collegiate game in his home state, Taylor was the team’s most successful shooter, adding 17 points and dishing out seven assists. His offensive dominance was so clear, Lonergan said, that the game plan became one the Colonials are familiar with: Get it to Taylor.
 “At halftime, he had two shots. I thought he played very well, he had a couple assists. And truthfully, he would have had more assists, guys dropping balls, missing layups. I look, somebody’s 0-for-5, somebody’s 2-for-7, you know, you’ve got to be selfish. He looked like he had it today,” Lonergan said. “I said, ‘You’ve got to take at least 10 shots in the second half.’ ”
Taylor wasn’t the only Colonial to hit double-digits: Kromah put up 13 points, pulling down four boards, and Mikic netted 12, sinking four three-pointers that were crucial to keeping GW in the game. More telling for Lonergan, though, was Mikic’s team-high seven rebounds. Though a sign of the forward’s defensive improvement, the head coach allowed, it also spoke to the Rams’ dominance in the post.
Rebounding is the cornerstone of Lonergan’s game plan, and when the team is successful, its players trace victories back to one key aspect: beating an opponent on the boards. But it was Fordham who exerted its might under the net Saturday, besting the Colonials in rebounds 44-24. The Rams tightly controlled the low post and kept GW to just 20 points in the paint, holding the team to six in the first half.
“Missing layups and getting killed on the boards is really the story of the game,” Lonergan said. “I don’t know, we just have to get tougher as a team, especially on the road. But it’s really hard to even stay in a game when you’re not battling in there. That’s the whole game.”
Though the furious rally put forth late by the Colonials kept the score close, the Rams’ shooting was far and above that of GW, posting a 46.8 shooting percentage on the game. When it came down to the wire, Lonergan said, Fordham just played harder. His team didn’t hold a lead until the final minutes of the game, and it scored just five points off the bench over 40 minutes of play.
It was a game that could have vaulted the Colonials to the top of the A-10 standings, but instead they left with a narrow defeat that visibly deflated the team as it exited the court.
“I feel terrible,” Taylor said. “You know, we lost. That was my only goal of the game, to get a win in front of the home crowd. And we just came up short today.”
