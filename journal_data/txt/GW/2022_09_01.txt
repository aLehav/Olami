Ernest Hayden was charged with the murder of his wife Pauline hours after jumping in front of a Metro train.
The man who jumped in front of a Metro train at the Foggy Bottom station Sunday morning has been charged with the first-degree murder of his wife, according to a police statement Monday.
Ernest Hayden was arrested at the GW Hospital for the murder of his wife Pauline Hayden, who was found dead in her Lewisdale, Maryland home by her daughter Sunday morning, according to a Fox 5 report. Charging documents show Ernest Hayden intentionally jumped in front of a train at the Foggy Bottom stop in an apparent attempt to take his own life, and the train struck him and left him with minor leg injuries, the report states.
“The preliminary investigation reveals the suspect murdered his wife and then fled the home,” a release issued by the Prince George’s County Police Department Monday states.
Silver and Blue line trains single-tracked through the station following the collision while several D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department vehicles responded to the Foggy Bottom station.
Hayden is being held at the Psychiatric Institute of Washington and will be extradited to Prince George’s County.
The Metropolitan Police Department referred a request for comment to the Metro Transit Police Department, who did not immediately return a request for comment.

Student Bar Association Sen. John Tuley, the chair of the finance committee and the sponsor of the act, said the Student Association reduced the SBA’s budget due to the SA’s budget shrinking.
The Student Bar Association unanimously voted to disburse more than $80,000 in annual funding to 44 law school student organizations at their meeting Tuesday.
The Student Bar Association Budget Allocation Act disbursed a total of $194,537 into three categories – $88,708 for student organizations, $30,000 to an ad hoc fund to be disbursed throughout the academic year and $75,289 for the executive budget. The act cut the executive budget to maintain funding for student organizations consistent with previous years despite a smaller overall budget due to the University officials separating funding for university-wide events.
SBA Sen. John Tuley, the chair of the finance committee and the sponsor of the act, said the SA reduced the SBA’s budget due to the SA’s budget shrinking. He said the executive branch of the SBA has “other sources of revenue,” like money it saved during the pandemic, to make up for cuts to its budget.
“The budget is significantly less than it was a year ago,” he said.
Tuley said the finance committee ensured it would provide student organizations with at least the same amount as it received last year. The budget denied appeals from four student organizations asking for more funding than was recommended by the finance committee.
Tuley said the finance committee also cut the ad hoc budget because last year, senators donated leftover ad hoc funds to the Student Assistance Fund, which will give money to students who need assistance with funding needs like emergency food and transportation. He said he did not recommend using ad hoc funding to fulfill appeals to the budget because it will take from money that organizations may unexpectedly need later in the year.
“That’s where the ad hoc budget will be used, so I would caution against pulling from that,” he said. “The only other option would then be to pull from what’s recommended to other organizations.”
The three organizations that received the most funding from allocations were Law Revue at $12,068, the Black Student Law Association at $10,990 and the International Law Society at $7,100. The SBA rejected the Black Student Law Association’s appeal for an additional $2,000 to make up for an unfulfilled funding request last year.
The SBA also unanimously passed the Senate Fall 2022 Organizing Resolution, which sets the SBA’s meeting calendar, creates a template for SBA agendas and sets out the rules of debate.
SBA Vice President of Finance Scott Glaser said in his executive report that the executive finance team will have a “strict policy” on reimbursement requests from student organizations. He said an organization has three attempts to submit proper reimbursement documentation to the SBA executive cabinet, which will in turn submit the request to the University finance office before the cabinet asks the organization to submit their request to the University finance office directly.
“We’re essentially the middle man, me and my team,” he said.
The next Student Bar Association meeting will be held on Tuesday, Sept. 13 at 9:15 p.m. in the Law Learning Center.

Updated: Sep. 3, 2022 at 10:17 a.m.
The Student Association Senate unanimously approved its own operating budget for the academic year in its first meeting of the semester Monday, marking the first time the senate has publicly released the body’s spending.
SA Executive Vice President Yan Xu sponsored the Legislative Operational Budget Act, which allocates $12,750 for office supplies, food and drink and “program development activities” like meetings, town halls and other senate gatherings. The budget allots the senate $7,250 for hosting events, $500 for office supplies, $1,000 for travel and $4,000 for food.
Xu said this year’s operational budget is smaller than last year’s private operational budget, which clocked in at a total of $19,254.48.
Xu said this year’s travel funds can go to graduate student senators who live outside the standard Metrorail and bus system.
“Some graduate students either live far away from campus and have to drive all the way to campus to attend an SA meeting,” Xu said. “This is the senate taking its support to support its senators.”
Senators also unanimously passed the Graduate Seats Conversion Act, which converts a graduate nursing school senate seat into a graduate-at-large seat. The resolution states that the seat has not been filled after multiple rounds of vacancy applications that started last May.
The at-large seat will be open to graduate students from all schools at the University. The new seat is the only at-large seat in this year’s senate.
Juan Carlos Mora, the senate chief counsel, announced the formation of a new senate task force to address tentative updates to Title IX that the White House proposed in June, which include changes that would eliminate the requirement for live hearings and include protections for LGBTQ+ students from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The task force will publish a final report at the end of the academic year.
The task force is open to undergraduate and graduate students and representatives from “stakeholder student organizations,” like Students Against Sexual Assault. The Senate has not yet selected members for the task force, and it will receive applications on a rolling basis.
“As students and stakeholders in our college community, it is within our power to make our campus a safer and more equitable place,” Mora said in an email.
Officials from GW’s Title IX office will provide further information on the new proposed guidelines and regulations at the next SA senate meeting.
Dean of Students Colette Coleman also spoke to senators, emphasizing the need to welcome and accommodate the freshman class. Coleman said the incoming freshmen class needs GW role models and that the SA is the perfect place to find them.
“Whatever your reason, whatever your inspiration, it brought you to the seat you’re in tonight and into the seat you will serve in through this academic school year,” Coleman said. “I want to encourage you to think about the ways that you can impact the student experience, not just for you and your classmates, but for all the students who will come behind you.”
The senate unanimously confirmed seven new executive nominees to serve in President Christian Zidouemba’s cabinet through the academic year after at least seven cabinet members, including the legislator general, the executive secretaries for dining services and undergraduate academic affairs and diversity, equity and inclusion resigned this July. Zidouemba replaced these four members and appointed executive secretaries for graduate academic affairs and alumni relations.
Andrew Harding, the newly confirmed legislator general, said his main priority is maintaining “political stability.” He said the attempt to remove Zidouemba this summer “should have never happened.”
“I will do everything in my power to ensure this body and University continues to move on,” he said.
The senate confirmed sophomore Neharika Rao as the executive secretary of diversity, equity and inclusion. Rao said her experience in high school student government and her deep passion for leadership will help her organize change and streamline dialogue between the student body and the SA.
“My first goal and my position is to create a safe environment for all students to feel as though their problems are going to end with us,” she said.
The next senate meeting will be held Monday, Sept. 12 at 8:30 p.m. in the Elliott School State Room.

This post has been updated to correct the following:
The Hatchet incorrectly reported that the SA disbursed its yearly operating budget. The body allocated the funds. The Hatchet also incorrectly reported that undergraduates and graduates were eligible for the newly converted at-large seat. Only graduates are eligible for the at-large seat. We regret these errors.

U.S. News and World Report ranked GW No. 63 in last year's rankings of higher education institutions.
GW rose 10 spaces to No. 61 in Forbes’ annual “America’s Top Colleges” rankings list, which the magazine published Tuesday.
GW has been gradually rising in Forbes’s college rankings over the past few years, including when it rose from No. 78 in the country in 2019 to No. 71 in 2021. Forbes determines the ranks of each university based on metrics including alumni salaries, debt, graduation rates, return on investment, retention rate, academic success and the number of people that make Forbe’s American Leaders List like the Forbes 30 under 30.
GW is also ranked as the No. 42 private college and No. 50 research university.
U.S. News and World Report ranked GW No. 63 in last year’s rankings of higher education institutions.
Half of GW’s 12 peer institutions rank above the University on the Forbes list, including the University of Southern California, Boston, New York, Tufts, Wake Forest and Georgetown universities. The University of Miami, the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Rochester, Northeastern, Syracuse and Tulane universities all ranked below GW in this year’s list.
Forbes “grades” U.S. colleges and universities based on their financial security by examining a string of statistics including the amount of assets, expenses, number of students and endowment. Forbes gave GW a “B-” grade with a financial GPA of 2.76 in a list released last week.
In 2021, the University held a “B” grade with a financial GPA of 2.87, indicating GW’s financial standing degraded as it emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Don’t miss a chance to try the Jerusalem Artichoke & Asparagus Quiche, an absolutely scrumptious and lesser known menu item.
Think you know Tatte Bakery & Cafe? Their extensive menu filled with a multitude of delicious pastries would beg to differ.
Tatte has finally arrived on GW’s campus after first opening its doors in the Boston area in 2008, and since spreading to numerous locations across the DMV. But if straying away from your go-to order intimidates you, we’ve got you covered.
We tried and ranked Tatte’s best pastries and dishes so you don’t have to:
1. Ham & Cheese Croissant ($5.50)
Given that Tatte offers a selection of extremely out-of-the-box dishes, first-time customers may not be inclined to go for the Ham & Cheese Croissant, a standard pastry that can be found virtually anywhere. But don’t be fooled – Tatte’s version is unlike any other in the District. Not only is the flakey dough made with fresh and authentic ingredients unmatched by other rival bakeries, but the combination of ham and gruyere paired with mouthwatering dijon mustard makes this ordinary pastry stand out from the competition by adding a new flavor to the mix. The everything seasoning sprinkled on top of the croissant is the cherry on top of this incredible dish, a must-try for loyal Tatte patrons.
2. Jerusalem Artichoke & Asparagus Quiche ($10)
Most frequent Tatte visitors typically opt for the pastries or breakfast sandwiches visible in the glass case, and the quiches listed on the back page of the menu may not be top of mind. So don’t miss a chance to try the Jerusalem Artichoke & Asparagus Quiche, an absolutely scrumptious and lesser known menu item. Artichoke in a quiche is a rare find and its pairing with the equally earthy and crunchy asparagus makes for a memorable dish. Each slice is not only a generous portion, but also served with a side salad, making this all-day menu item an optimal choice for any meal of the day.
3. Roasted Strawberries Tea Cake ($3.25)
Although this adorably small tea cake may be only a few bites, don’t let that discourage you from trying this tasty menu item as a quick snack in between nearby classes. The distinct flavor of roasted strawberry is not found in many typical pastries or cakes, blending together to create a tart yet sweet tasting combination. As a bonus, this tea cake is also one of Tatte’s gluten-free options, ideal for those with dietary restrictions. This miniature cake is a wonderful option for a dessert as well as a snack or a sweet addition to a savory breakfast.
4. Cinnamon Walnut Coffee Cake ($4.50)
Tatte’s take on this commonly found dish turns an everyday classic into a memorable find that you’ll want to come back for again and again. The delicious combination of cinnamon and walnuts takes the cake in terms of flavor as well as texture. This dense and rich cake paired with one of Tatte’s signature lattes, such as the Honey Halva Latte, is the ideal way to start your morning before a packed day of classes.
5. Mixed Berry Linzer Tart ($6.50)
Tatte’s Mixed Berry Linzer Tart is not only ideal to have a slice of for dessert – it’s also an easy option to bring as a dessert to share at a get-together or even for an out-of-the-box alternative to a birthday cake. Linzer, a traditional Austrian pastry dough, forms a lattice design over top of the mixed berry compote, making the tart as aesthetically pleasing as it is delicious. The standout quality of this dish is the individual notes of each berry – from strawberry to blackberry to raspberry, the delectable flavors are sure to keep you coming back for more.

GW Athletics Director Tanya Vogel announced that former tennis Head Coach Torrie Browning departed GW in May after coaching the team for the past six seasons, citing “other professional opportunities.” 
Tennis will enter the spring season with a new head coach hailing from Fresno Pacific, graduating from a Division II background upon his arrival to GW Athletics.
George Rodriguez, who coached Fresno Pacific’s men’s and women’s tennis teams for two seasons, took the helm of GW’s coaching staff last month as the Colonials look to build upon their A-10 Championship caliber play from last spring. Rodriguez led the Sunbirds women’s team to a 16-10 record that led them to the PacWest Tennis Championships, where they placed third in the league of 13 teams – their best run in program history.
“I’d like to thank Tanya Vogel and Andy Ruge for the confidence and trust they have in me to lead the GW women’s tennis program,” Rodriguez said in the release. “The pride, excitement and the warmth of the people at GW makes it an amazing place. I’m beyond excited to be joining the GW family!”
The Colonials finished with an 11-10 record last season, entering the A-10 Championship before falling 4–3 to No. 3 Fordham in Orlando. The team registered a .442 winning percentage in the singles category and a .371 percentage for doubles.
GW Athletics Director Tanya Vogel announced that former tennis Head Coach Torrie Browning departed GW in May after coaching the team for the past six seasons, citing “other professional opportunities.”
Rodriguez spent the past two seasons with the Sunbirds, earning Wilson ITA Coach of the Year honors for the West region this spring. During his first season in 2020 at Fresno, Rodriguez led the women’s program to a 7-10 regular season record before they finished in sixth place at the PacWest Tennis Championships.
Vogel attributed the search that ultimately selected Rodriguez to Andy Ruge, GW’s senior associate athletics director for external operations.
“I want to thank Andy Ruge for running a competitive search, and I am extremely excited to welcome George to GW,” Vogel said in the release. “His experience at Fresno Pacific is one exhibit of his commitment to student-athlete success on and off the court. George has the energy, enthusiasm and experience to lead our talented women’s tennis program to be a top competitor in the Atlantic 10.”
Rodriguez served as an assistant coach and interim head coach at Grand Valley State in 2019, where he was named ITA Midwest Region Assistant Coach of the Year after guiding the women’s team to an 18-3 record.
Rodriguez began his tennis career at Ferris State University, where he played with the men’s tennis program for four years, leading the team to the GLIAC Conference Championship during his senior season.

Richards is the latest coaching staff addition under Head Coach Chrissy Schoonmaker, who was named A-10 Coach of the Year last spring, guiding softball to a championship bid.
A former coach for New Zealand’s national baseball team joined softball as an assistant coach for the upcoming season last month.
Kris Richards – who coached for the Baseball New Zealand national team for more than five years – will bring extensive experience from the baseball diamond to the softball squad as part of Head Coach Chrissy Schoonmaker’s staff. Richards served as a hitting coach for New Zealand’s U-15 and U-23 programs and managed the U-18 team before overseeing coach and player development from Baseball New Zealand’s administration.
“It’s an honor to take on this role and represent such a respected institution,” Richards said in a release. “I want to thank Coach Schoonmaker for giving me the opportunity to be a part of her experienced coaching staff. I am eager to get out on the diamond, meet the players and compete for an A-10 Championship.”
Richards joins recent graduate Sierra Lange as the latest coaching staff addition under Schoonmaker, who was named A-10 Coach of the Year last spring, guiding softball to an A-10 leading 36 wins and a championship bid.
“We are thrilled to welcome Kris Richards to GW, to the softball program and to our coaching staff,” Schoonmaker said in the release. “Kris has a passion for player development, a love of coaching and a deep knowledge of the game which will make an immediate impact.”
Richards joined New Zealand’s national baseball organization in 2017, when he started as the U-15 hitting coach – a position that earned him International Coach of the Year honors from international baseball agency Baseball Jobs Overseas.
He served as a regional development officer of the Wellington region of New Zealand the same year, where he oversaw administrative functions, like scheduling in-season games, coordinating coach and player development clinics, developing budgets and coaching elite players.
Richards got his first national coaching gig in the Czech Republic from 2015 to 2016 before heading to the Down Under, serving as hitting coach for the U-23 national team while also managing the Kotlářka Praha baseball club in Prague, which he guided to its first-ever league title.
Richards played in the Baltimore Orioles’ minor league system for three seasons as an infielder and pitcher before Tommy John surgery gave way to his coaching career.
“Kris has a wealth of experience at both the professional and international levels from his time in MLB and with Baseball New Zealand, and his offensive expertise will be a game changer for us,” Schoonmaker said in the release. “Kris’s energy is infectious, and he will be an asset to our team culture and out on the recruiting trail. We look forward to seeing the lasting impact he has on our student-athletes.”

Two weeks ago, I received one of the District’s more than 20,000 doses of Jyennos monkeypox vaccine. D.C. has received the ninth highest number of vaccines in the United States with 24,175 doses shipped to the city as of Aug. 29. Because I am not a man who has sex with other men, I did not think that I would qualify for the vaccine. But after further research, I found out that those who qualify for the monkeypox vaccine in D.C. include people of any gender and sexual orientation who have had more than one sexual partner in the past two weeks, sex workers or staff members “at establishments where sexual activity occurs.” I was excited to play my part in preventing the monkeypox disease, but getting my first dose of the vaccine was an uncomfortable experience, both emotionally and physically.
Before my appointment, I assumed only gay men had access to the vaccine because of homophobic language surrounding the spread of monkeypox. To prevent other people from believing in the same misinformation, it is vital to avoid stigmas and stereotypes that fuel lies instead of slowing the disease, like blaming monkeypox on gay men. Other people like myself may qualify for the monkeypox vaccine but do not know it. While I am very thankful to qualify and receive the vaccine, I was misgendered several times at the appointment and continue to wait out longer-than-expected side effects, which made my whole experience unenjoyable altogether.
The first disappointment came when I got immediately misgendered while walking into the monkeypox vaccination site. My heart dropped into my stomach. “Can we see verification of your appointment ladies,” the police officer said in front of the D.C. Department of Health building. After showing them my QR code, the officer showed me to a waiting room full of chairs where the volunteers and doctors began to add “ma’am” to every phrase directed at me. Because monkeypox is mostly reported among men who have sex with other men in the United States, I thought I would be surrounded by a queer community that understood my non-binary identity. Healthcare establishments are typically stressful to me because of the heteronormativity that seeps through them. It is impossible to go to the doctor without discussing my queer identity because of questions about sexual activity and discussions about my body. I found myself in a similar situation at the monkeypox vaccination site, which felt unsafe, unwelcome and overwhelming.
Even after disclosing my gender identity and use of gender-neutral pronouns on the forms that all patients fill out, the staff working at the vaccination site continued to misgender me. Being misgendered is exhausting because it is a constant self reminder that society categorizes me as a woman before anything else. Even when filling out the forms, I had to specify which gender I was assigned at birth, and while that information is necessary, it still stings to repeatedly be considered female. Getting my monkeypox vaccine showed me how even in predominantly queer spaces, LGBTQ+ people are still misunderstood and discriminated against. But nothing will change the fact that I got misgendered. Instead, my desire to practice safe sex and protect others from the spread of monkeypox outweighed the discomfort.
When the time came to receive the dose, confusion and panic set in – the injection was the most painful vaccine that I have ever received. The Jynneos vaccine was injected through intradermal administration, a superficial injection that doesn’t reach the fat of the forearm as most vaccines do, creating a red, irritable lump right under the surface of the skin. The insertion itself was more painful than I anticipated. I was not prepared for the sheer discomfort that would come with the shot, making the physical side effects extra stressful.
Now two weeks out from vaccination, irritation from the shot has lingered. My forearm is still itchy, and the punctured patch of skin still hurts when touched – symptoms known to last up to a month. Other side effects include headaches, muscle pain, fatigue and nausea, which are all common with other vaccines as well, but the extended period of discomfort tied to the vaccine has been a first for me. 
The initial and enduring pain and itching has definitely been manageable but also unexpected – uncertainty that has generated unnecessary panic that I was not prepared to handle. All people planning to receive the vaccine should know what to expect about the shot and its side effects well before getting it – not right before the needle enters their forearm. 
Ultimately, getting the vaccine and avoiding monkeypox was worth the experience, but I wish D.C. Health informed me better ahead of time. The department could have included videos or pictures to explain the vaccination process in emails they sent about my appointment. Health care professionals at the site should also communicate better about the experience and what it entails. I left the vaccination site jarred in both an emotional and physical sense, not looking forward to returning in a month for my second shot. Since no one told me, I’ll tell you – be aware of misgendering and lack of queer knowledge at D.C. Health. The injection might also hurt, and side effects can last up to a month.
Here’s to a second dose that goes better than the first.

If you’re excited to use U-Pass to commute to Capitol Hill, party all night in Adams Morgan or root for the Nationals at Navy Yard, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority can take you there – if you’re lucky. Metro is in a transitional phase, and things are going to feel worse before they get better. With upcoming construction work on the Yellow Line and the slow return of the 7000-series cars, riders can expect infrequent and unreliable service for the foreseeable future. You can’t use your U-Pass to take the Metro when there’s no bus or train, so what needs to happen for Metro to get back on track – and for you to get the most out of U-Pass?
Students’ multi-year advocacy for U-Pass finally paid off when officials announced a “free trial” for students last fall. Officials enrolled all undergraduate students in U-Pass last spring for a $100 semesterly fee that has continued into the current school year while allowing graduate students to opt out of the program. With fares ranging from $2 to $6 depending on where and when you travel, paying $100 upfront for unlimited trips each semester is a fantastic deal. Basically, you’d have to take between eight and 25 round trips on Metrorail or Metrobus to make back the $100 U-Pass fee in a semester. Metro’s unlimited monthly passes, which cost between $64 and $192, give riders the equivalent of 32 pre-paid trips for a specific fare.
Free transit may get you into the station, but it won’t get you aboard a bus or train. U-Pass is a success story, but its success depends on Metro’s ability to take you where you want to go. In October 2021, one month before GW joined the U-Pass system, Metro pulled its 7000-series cars from operation after a train derailed outside the Arlington Cemetery station. The model accounts for about 60 percent of Metro’s fleet, so its removal scaled back operations back to double-digit wait times on every line. Metro owns 748 7000-series cars but only eight 7000-series trains are operating across the network as of Aug. 1. There are plans to run 27 additional 7000-series trains, but that depends on the agency’s ability to inspect their wheels for defects and re-certify them for service.
And starting Sept. 10 through Fall 2022, Metro will lose service in Virginia south of Reagan National Airport to destinations like Alexandria. The Yellow Line will also close completely until May 2023 as the agency prepares to build a new station and overhaul the tunnel and bridge that connects the line across the Potomac River. While the Blue and Green lines will pick up some of the slack, local and express bus services will make up for the lack of trains in Virginia. But that’s a far cry from taking a train with its own dedicated right-of-way – getting stuck in traffic or multiple transfers can discourage riders with other means of travel. And with the interconnected Blue, Orange and Silver Lines now the only way into Virginia on Metrorail, a single incident – like a trespasser last Saturday – could strand riders on either side of the river.
These projects could make riding the Metro an unattractive option, but they’re absolutely necessary to ensure operations are safe today and ideally more efficient tomorrow. Just as we ground certain planes after accidents, it would be unconscionable to allow the 7000-series cars to remain in service in the wake of their derailments. Longer headways and outdated rolling stock are far from ideal, but wait times have dropped from 20 to 30 minutes closer to 10 to 15 minutes on most lines. And it’d be nearly impossible to repair half a century’s worth of damage to the bridge and tunnel on the Yellow Line overnight – it’ll take time, but who wants to go for an unplanned swim in the Potomac River when you can just take the train?
While these improvements will make Metro better in the future, they’re sabotaging its effectiveness in the present. It’s hard to practice delayed gratification when you’re stuck in a tunnel or rush-hour traffic. If you’re willing to put up with sporadic service, delays and temporary bus transfers, you can get your money’s worth from Metro. But not everyone can, let alone should, patronize a transit network that simply isn’t the best option for every journey right now. For relatively short trips, walking, rolling, biking or scootering might be faster than a bus or train. U-Pass is a great way to get students interested in taking public transportation, but it’s up to Metro to keep them coming back.
As General Manager Randy Clarke and WMATA’s employees do their best to pull the ailing transit service back from the brink, it’s also worth exploring how you can make Metro – and U-Pass – work for you. If you commute to campus from outside Foggy Bottom or outside D.C. entirely, you’re almost guaranteed to make your $100 fee back by the end of the semester. A quick trip once or twice a week within the District will also put you on track to recoup your costs. If it’s use-it-or-lose-it when it comes to U-Pass, then it makes sense to maximize the amount of times you travel and how far you go. You can also use WMATA’s trip planner and next arrivals tools to see the best way to get where you’re going and when your train or bus will arrive or use apps like MetroHero to gain even more insights about your trip.
It’s a tricky tradeoff for GW students when it comes to U-Pass – taking Metro will save you money, but delays, transfers and ongoing maintenance will cost you your time. It’s up to you to decide which is more important.
