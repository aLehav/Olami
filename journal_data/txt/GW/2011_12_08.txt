Students and community members will have an opportunity to share their opinions about the University Police Department at a public comment session Monday.
The forum will take place at 7 p.m. in room 309 at the Marvin Center as part of UPD’s recertification process with the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies.
The international credentialing agency is also reviewing UPD’s records from the past three years. It last accredited the force in 2009, after initially stamping UPD with a seal of approval in 2006.
The commission tests law enforcement agencies on nearly 500 different benchmarks, including training, hiring practices and use-of-force procedures. UPD is among 51 campus police forces nationwide to receive the credentials.
The last public hearing session held for UPD’s 2009 recertification saw scant attendance, with just three students and feedback from two administrators. About 20 individuals attended the previous town hall for the department’s initial accreditation.
Maya Mitchell, a program manager at the commission, said feedback from the public provides a chance for assessors to hear how community members evaluate the force’s service and back up what paper records may show.
“We want to know if, in fact, the agency is doing what they say they are doing,” she said.
Mitchell added that if a standards-related issue came up, the assessors would go back and look at those policies or complaints to verify UPD’s procedures. The extra layer serves as another way to receive information on law enforcement agencies, she said.
For UPD Chief Kevin Hay, student feedback at the town hall session would help point the department toward areas with room for improvement.
“We are hoping that a fair amount of students attend the event, as it will provide them an opportunity to share their experiences, both good and bad, with the department and with the assessment team,” Hay said.

James Haley started trading fake stocks when he was 13 – and he’s been hooked ever since.
Like many finance majors in the GW School of Business, Haley will gun for prestigious internships with financial firms over the next four years. But despite the blows to the image of Wall Street after the financial crisis and amid Occupy protests, Haley doesn’t feel like the 1 percent.
“I’ll probably be working for free for the next four summers at these banks, so I feel frustration too,” Haley, a freshman, said. “When I get in, I’ll be the little the guy, and the guy above me will be making a lot of money.”
After a dip in business school graduates entering the financial sector in the wake of the 2008 crisis, students are once again pining for Wall Street jobs – but with an increased social conscience. Thirty-one percent of 2011 business school graduates earned jobs in the financial services industry, up from 19 percent in 2010.
Haley was one of 30 business school students who piled into a Duques Hall conference room Monday night for a panel with banking and career experts, searching for answers on how to break into the grueling field.
Aaron Brachman, who graduated from GW in 2002 and now works as a senior financial associate at Royal Bank of Canada Wealth Management, spoke at the discussion, advising students on interview techniques. After conducting hundreds of interviews with potential interns for a decade, Brachman said he’s finally getting one question from applicants he never heard before.
“I’ve never had people, except in the last couple of years ask, ‘What kind of value do I add to society?’ I think that’s wonderful. Before it used to just be ‘I want to work hard and make a lot of money,’” Brachman said. “The general public is starting to ask those general questions of people on Wall Street, which is important.”
Banks and investment firms will stream in and out of the business school throughout the remainder of the academic year, scheduling interview rounds with top students who stand out as prospective hires. Representatives from the Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of America have set up shop in Duques Hall this week for private interviews. This fall, Goldman Sachs came to GW for the first time.
Business school administrators are pushing students to think more ethically in order to curb another generation of Enrons and Bernie Madoffs. Bloomberg Businessweek ranked the school No. 71 for ethics last year, a figure dean Doug Guthrie said he is determined to bring up.
Guthrie tapped Tim Fort, the school’s highest-ranking ethics professor, to lead a curriculum overhaul this year as the interim dean of undergraduate studies.
“Without endorsing all the aspects of the Occupy movement, there are reasons why people are legitimately angered by some of the behavior on Wall Street and in other business,” Fort said. “And I think GWSB is at the forefront of constructively trying to correct such behaviors with our attention to ethics issues.”
The school’s career center is also focused on reform, aiming to improve on GW’s No. 87 business recruiter survey ranking, according to Bloomberg Businessweek.
“GW people have to scratch and claw their way in,” Brachman said. “I even went as far as to try to sneak into a Georgetown career recruitment center because the recruiters were there.”
To attract more attention from recruiters, the school’s career center, looked at as a model for the University, has made small changes this year by adding specialized advisers to guide students through individual career goals and ramping up alumni mentoring and career coaching.
Students, flocking back to finance jobs, approve of any efforts that will help them break into the field.
“I know there’s a lot of controversy with the Occupy Wall Street movement, but I’m in this because it’s what I’m interested in doing. It’s not about making a lot of money. It’s not about getting rich quickly,” junior finance major Drew Litavis said. “If you’re passionate about the work, it doesn’t matter what people say about it. It’s what you make it for yourself. That’s how I’ve internalized it.”

Student rights and responsibilIties
A
From the alcohol consequence flow chart created this year, to the University’s efforts to formalize a sexual assault policy and its updates to the graduate alcohol policy, the University’s judicial system has demonstrated that it is working in the student body’s best interest. The Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities, under Assistant Dean of Students Tara Pereira’s purview, has demonstrated incredible awareness of student needs, and the changes made to the system will foster a safer campus, as students will hopefully be less afraid to report campus incidents, such as alcohol overdose.
Knapp
B+
With a new five-year contract extension granted by the Board of Trustees, University President Steven Knapp will continue to lead and transform GW. With initiatives such as strengthening research, a rebranding campaign, diversity and inclusion and sustainability, Knapp has proven that he is a multi-talented administrator who has the capability to raise the national profile of the University. Yet it often seems that Knapp is noticeably less concerned with student life issues, and many students continue to feel disconnected from their president. Furthermore, the Knapp administration continues to operate an extensive public relations machine – a serious step back for transparency at the University.
Student Safety and Security
B
It has been up and down for campus safety and security, beginning with the crimes in the City Hall and West End residence halls. Then there was a malfunction that delayed a Crime Alert e-mail following arrests on campus and a shooting Halloween night in Georgetown. Yet the University responded to both of the issues swiftly. The University Police Department tightened security in upperclassman residence halls by adding officers to monitor the front doors in an attempt to curtail piggy-backing. A texting alert system was unveiled to notify the community of any potential ongoing threats after Halloween’s delayed Crime Alert. While the semester got off to a rocky start for student safety and security, the University’s swift moves to improve these issues are comforting.
Student Association Executives
C-
Student Association President John Richardson and Executive Vice President Ted Costigan began the year with a great deal of promise. Their advocacy assisted in the University Counseling Center fee removal and through G-Voice and town halls, they’ve curated student concerns in order to best serve the community. But their focus since those initial months is disheartening. Costigan’s organization of the GW Debate Series is not the best use of the access he has to administrators. Richardson, who was elected to serve as chief advocate for the student body, should have been more vocal about attending the initial Marvin Center fifth floor talks with administrators. As advocates for student concerns and not leaders of programming initiatives, Richardson and Costigan just barely pass, and hopefully the student body will see more from the SA executives next semester.
Farewell to Four hatchet staffers 
F
Next semester, greener pastures, diplomas and overseas adventures will take away several staffers from The Hatchet. Gaby, Jordan, Caroline and Lisa: You will be sorely missed, but we wish you the best in exploring all the wonders the future has in store for you.

“When in doubt…listen to Beyoncé!”
These words, outlined in thick, black marker, are proudly emblazoned on a beige study cubicle in Gelman Library as if Beyoncé wrote them herself. I gladly oblige.
The wooden divider in front of me is an unconventionally honest open forum. It is almost as if students feel it is their obligation to leave their marks for others to see, whether it be a smiley face with bloody fangs or a philosophical message about love, happiness and equality.
Students like having their voices heard because it is the only thing they have direct control over, but these voices need to be visible beyond the confines of scribbles on a desk. There needs to be a place where students can openly express individual opinions – foolish, insightful or otherwise – on campus.
The University already uses student evaluations to assess classes and even holds public forums to speak up about issues that the University wants student input for, but where is the forum for all the musings that fill our days?
Every spring, Chalk-In Day kicks off the return to warm weather by blocking off 22nd and H streets to give the cubicle artists – and everyone else on campus – a chance to express themselves outside the classroom.
But why can’t this happen every day?
Students need an outlet. If the library is being renovated, I’m sure the University doesn’t want that outlet to be the new desks. But why not include a few areas of the library where students can express themselves before going back to the books?
Drawing boards, dry erase markers and some creativity will make sure the drab library is more inviting and provide a greater center for self expression that GW is lacking.
This could provide students with an open forum to post topics, draw pictures or offer inspirational quotes that show just how important an individual’s voice may be.
Students frequent the library, so let’s give it a student voice.
 “Sleep is for the dead” is too enduring a gem – particularly now, when the library is bursting with overtired, finals-frenzied students – to let it remain in a cubicle.
I would be lying if I said the cubicle quotes do not keep me sane and entertained during late-night library stints.
So students, leave your mark, even if it’s just a burst of finals-induced inspiration.

A University-wide initiative to use less paper will be kicked into action next semester – a switch administrators say will slash expenses and increase sustainability.
The paperless plan, which University President Steven Knapp signed off on late last month, is part of the cost-cutting Innovation Task Force and could bank up to $600,000 in savings to be redirected to academics.
A completely paperless graduate admissions process, fewer paper-based course evaluations, more electronic syllabi and fewer printed copies of the University Bulletin are early ideas for reducing GW’s dependence on paper.
The Innovation Task Force – a group launched by University President Steven Knapp in 2009 to trim operational spending and funnel the savings toward academics – hopes to save $60 million per year after its first five years. In the last two years, the task force identified potential savings of $34 million by 2015.
Along with the paperless strategy, GW will move forward with five other cost-saving plans in the fields of customer service, cloud software utilization, undergraduate housing, internal consulting and facilities usage – the savings of which will total $5.1 million.
The paperless effort, still in the planning stage, will not be implemented until at least May 2012, Innovation Task Force co-chairman Craig Linebaugh said.
“One of the areas in which paperless can have an impact is in dealing with graduate applications, and there are others, related to various administrative processes,” Linebaugh said.
Eliminating paper can go a long way toward helping achieve a smoother student experience, Linebaugh said, while admitting that a certain level of paper consumption cannot be avoided.
Gregory Squires, a professor of sociology and public policy and public administration, was curious to hear details of the paperless plan, but said he already opts for online file-sharing instead of printing his course materials.
“I don’t suspect it will affect me much because I use Blackboard in all of my classes and put the syllabi on there,” Squires said.
The plan will also help the University in its efforts to be environmentally-friendly, a priority for Knapp since he founded the Office of Sustainability in late 2008.
“Reducing paper use at the University directly impacts the University’s waste and recycling footprint,” Sophie Waskow, project coordinator for the Office of Sustainability, said. “Obviously there are times when items need to be printed, but there are many efficiencies to be gained by converting to paperless solutions for many operations on campus.”
She added that the entire GW community would need to adopt paperless efforts in everyday activities for it to be successful.

A District think tank is pressuring federal officials to incorporate student perspectives in the formation of higher education policies.
A study by the Center for American Progress, released last month, advocated for greater student participation because “rising tuitions and student debts mean rising stakes for college students.”
The report noted that the Occupy Wall Street movement allowed students to bring concerns about student debt and loan forgiveness to the forefront of national discussion, but that they were rarely able to contribute to the government agencies, philanthropic organizations and non-profits that create guidelines surrounding these issues.
Incorporating student voices on federal panels – including the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity and the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance – would trigger more efficient and up-to-date legislation, which could mean lower tuitions and debt, according to the report.
Leaders from those groups did not return request for comment.
Omitting students from the decision-making process leads to misunderstandings about their concerns, the study’s co-author, Julie Morgan said.
“When a committee includes only one student or tries to speak on behalf of students without really knowing any, you have this result when they don’t necessarily understand what the needs [of certain students] are,” she said.
Student debt is increasingly in the national spotlight. Nearly three-quarters of adults aged 18 to 34 said college graduates have more student debt than they can manage, according to a November report by The Institute for College Access and Success. GW graduates in the Class of 2010 had, on average, $32,547 in debt upon graduation, about $7,300 more than the national average, annual data from The Project on Student Debt show.
The study placed the onus of adding students to federal groups on the policy-makers, suggesting that federal officials should seek out student representatives, “one of whom is elected by a national body that represents student governments, such as the American Student Government Association, and one of whom has demonstrated experience dealing with the particular policy issues the committee will discuss.”
Students should use social media and grassroots groups to stay informed about higher education issues, the report added.
Morgan said student groups will have to work hard to attract the attention of federal policy-makers, but added that she believes it is possible.
“I think that student groups are going to need to push for these ideas and hope that they grow. We worked in conjunction with some student groups in writing the report and coming up with the ideas for it, so hopefully we’ve sort of built some consensus around some of the ideas,” Morgan said.
Paul Wahlbeck, chairman of the political science department, said intermediary organizations like the American Association of University Professors convey the concerns of faculty members to policy-makers, but said similar groups aren’t established solely for students.
The Student Aid Alliance is a coalition of higher education groups that lobbies for federal financial aid. The group – co-chaired by the American Council on Education and The National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities – doesn’t have independent leadership and is not student-run.
Wahlbeck supported the ideas laid out in the report, especially in a university context.
“I think it’s a great idea to always include all parts of the University in discussions about policy decisions,” he said. “I think that includes faculty, staff, administrators and students.”

I have a secret that I would like to confess to the world before I graduate. I have a really bad habit of Googling my name to see what the Internet has to offer.
Thanks to power of The Hatchet, many of the top results link to a column I wrote in the spring of my sophomore year, “Marijuana should be a medicine” (Feb. 1, 2010, p.4). Now my persuasive insights have been immortalized on truly upstanding websites like marijuana.com and ganja.com.
I hope what I have written over the past three and a half years has caused readers to rethink Foggy Bottom reality, pivot to an ethnic food lifestyle or be amused for a few minutes in a boring lecture.
Okay, I’m not naïve.
I just hope I was the catalyst for someone to try some ethnic food in Northern Virginia, and hopefully my columns kept a few people awake in class instead of sending them into a mid-lecture slumber.
As I Google myself for the last time of my undergraduate career, I realize that much of what I have written for The Hatchet has been critical of the University or some other aspect of District life. I can see how some might think that I come off as a bit of a complainer. But, I would rather think of myself as a constructive criticizer.
My Yankee up-bringing (meaning New England, not the spawn-of-Satan baseball team) drilled the cliché into my head that if something is worth doing, it’s worth doing right. GW is without question worth doing, and it’s worth doing right. That is why criticism from students, faculty and even our Foggy Bottom neighbors is meant for the betterment of the University. Criticism is not something that should be feared – it is something that should be taken in stride.
I don’t take myself too seriously and I don’t live in an ivory tower. Despite my ramblings about plastic piggy banks in residence halls, pre-graduation donations or the amount of money spent on parking garages instead of Gelman Library, I genuinely have enjoyed my overall experience.
I like to think of myself as a good Catholic, so I will make another confession: I arrived at GW rather cynical about what the next four years would hold for me. Admittedly, I was not a terribly happy camper to have ended up at G-Dub. But after a few years, that stupid admissions slogan about something happening here came to fruition. Whenever I fall into counterfactual thinking about my life, I always come to the same conclusion – I wouldn’t have had the opportunities, friends, free food or good times that I have enjoyed without GW.
GW would not have been the same without all the wonderful people I have been honored to meet and now call my friends. It might not be very good at crafting scholarship criteria, but it puts together an amazing group of individuals in Foggy Bottom. My life will forever be changed because of the people I met here.
Four years ago, I wouldn’t have believed I would say that I can’t imagine what my life would be like without GW. Yet I say that with pride today.
Two weeks from now I will be returning to my native homeland of New Hampshire, college educated and (temporarily) unemployed. I will have graduated from GW (God willing), but all the good and all the not-so-good about GW will remain a part of me, my memory and my Google search results.
