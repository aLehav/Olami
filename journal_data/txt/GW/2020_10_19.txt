A student launched a petition last week calling for officials to review their decision to hold the spring semester online.
The petition comes after officials announced earlier this month at a Faculty Senate meeting and in an email to the student body that all undergraduate courses and “most” graduate programs will be held virtually in the spring. The petition, which had attained more than 1,800 signatures as of Sunday, states that students were “disappointed” with the lack of effort to create a plan for students to return to campus and calls for officials to “put the work and effort in” to allow students to return, “at the very least, for freshmen.”
“With a well-articulated return plan and mutual responsibility, respect and effort between the students and staff at GW, the student body is confident that we can return to campus for the spring semester,” the petition states.
The petition states that the decision to hold the spring semester virtually was made “prematurely,” as the COVID-19 pandemic may change “a lot” within the next few months.
“As GWU students, we are prepared to ‘Raise High!’ by working together and following safety guidelines for a safe and successful return to an on-campus experience in Washington, D.C.,” the petition states.
A University spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.
Lucas Souza, the student who started the petition, did not return multiple requests for comment.

Three students were victims of an armed robbery near campus Saturday night, according to a Metropolitan Police Department report.
The report states that the students were located near the World Health Organization building on Virginia Avenue when two suspects pulled up next to them in a tan Chevrolet at 9:40 p.m., exited the vehicle and pointed knives at the three students, “demanding money and property.” The two suspects stole more than $420 in cash and two pairs of AirPods that were together worth a total of $350 before getting back into the vehicle and fleeing up 23rd Street through campus, according to the report.
About an hour later, a GW Alert sent to the GW community stated multiple suspects fled from the scene of the robbery, and the alert instructed locals to avoid the area as officers searched the scene.
“Armed Robbery at corner of 22nd St. & Virginia Ave,” the alert stated. “Suspects fled off campus in white SUV. Police on Scene. Avoid the area.”
Four MPD officers responded to the incident, the report states.
“This case remains under investigation,” MPD spokesperson Hugh Carew said. “Anyone who has information related to this case is asked to contact us at 202-727-9099.”
University officials released a second alert at about 11:20 p.m., announcing police had cleared the scene.
“ALL CLEAR!” the second alert stated. “Police cleared the scene at corner of 22nd St. & Virginia Ave. Report any suspicious activity to GWPD 202-994-6111.”
A GW Police Department spokesperson declined to comment on the incident, deferring to information provided in the alerts. A University spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.

Over Fall Break, we got the notification that we all knew was coming: Classes will be online once again in the spring.
Emotions from the GW community have been mixed, with some students expressing grief, anger and bleak resignation. Students are questioning the decision to cancel commencement events this far in advance, whether or not residence halls will be open and what college will look like in a third pandemic semester. They are posting and petitioning for changes, like a chance at coming back to campus this spring.
Meanwhile, other students are blasting their peers for their grief, calling upset students “selfish” or “spoiled.” Conversations have broken out on social media, with many students expressing their sadness about the situation, while others are going as far as to suggest that students should not be upset because GW made the right decision. This sentiment is misguided. Students are trying to grab control of a situation that is completely out of their hands, and they have every right to do so.
The bottom line is that we all know the University made the right call to move online and consider halting in-person commencement events once again with a pandemic that is still raging. We know deep down that an in-person semester would be dangerous. We know officials are trying to accommodate the wants of both students and professors by offering one pass/fail course. But that does not mean students should happily accept a grim reality. We have every right to be upset that we have been dealt another crushing blow by the pandemic, and students should lend a hand to one another rather than try to be a voice of reason.
“From the abrupt cancellation of the past semester, to a lost summer, to a virtual fall semester, students have been made to run through the gauntlet because of the pandemic. Adding the double-whammy of a virtual spring and no Commencement just heaps more disappointment on top.”
Over the summer, the University’s final decision to close down campus came only weeks before students were slated to move in. Even though the wait was fully justified, it made it even more painful for students. In letting us know about the spring as early as possible, the University prevented students from getting their hopes up for naught.
The same holds true for Commencement. The Class of 2021 has been told since they stepped foot on campus that their Commencement, GW’s bicentennial, would be a special moment in the University’s history that they could celebrate. The health crisis is what made this promise impossible to keep, forcing the University to make yet another difficult call. Students in their final year at GW are rightfully upset, just like last year’s graduating class that got the brunt of the University’s pandemic response.
Planning for the University’s bicentennial has been years in the making and was supposed to be a point of pride for the University and its students. Canceling the yearlong ceremonies almost certainly was not taken lightly. Speakers and other logistics needed to be planned and paid for right away, so the University likely was not in a position to belabor making the call. This is fully justifiable and rational – but that does not in any way, shape or form invalidate what a letdown it is for students.
From the abrupt cancellation of the past semester, to a lost summer, to a virtual fall semester, students have been made to run through the gauntlet because of the pandemic. Adding the double-whammy of a virtual spring and no Commencement just heaps more disappointment on top. There is no reason why students should not be angry, sad and grieving about what they have needed to go through. So while students should acknowledge that the University made the right decision in this particular case, none of us should think or be made to think that our negative feelings about this situation are unjustified. Students shouldn’t pit themselves against each other and instead try to navigate this year together. We need to hear out each other’s complaints and try to understand where we are all coming from.
We have heard this time and time again, but we are all living in unprecedented and unpredictable times. We barely have control over the pandemic and its detrimental impact on our jobs, families, social connections and academic lives. We get it, coming back to campus in person is probably not safe, and students should not go out of their way to say that to their peers. But we must show compassion for one another and try to understand that every frustration is someone’s way of grieving, which they should not feel ashamed to do.

When you’re a kid growing up with LGBTQ parents, you don’t realize that your family unit is “different” until you’re told. For me, this came in the form of some first grade biology experts, who, when I told them I didn’t have a dad and that I had two moms, declared it to be impossible. “You can’t have two mommies, you need a mommy and a daddy to have a baby,” they said, arms crossed, faces smug with their own self-assuredness. I never brought this interaction up with my parents, nor any of the other increasingly vile homophobic vitriol I would hear as I got older. But at such a young age, the confidence with which those kids made their statement, coupled with my own 6-year-old ignorance, left me questioning whether or not my family was normal, and even worse, if there was something wrong with us.
Lucky for me, it was right around this time when one of my moms sat me down and gave me “the talk” all LGBTQ parents have with their kids at some point. She told me some families have two moms, some have two dads and some have a mom and a dad. She said it doesn’t matter what your family looks like as long as there is love. I knew my parents loved each other. I knew they loved me and my sister. And that was all the explanation I needed.
Since then, a lot has changed for my family and families like mine. In 2008, two years after that conversation, gay marriage was legalized in our home state of Connecticut. My parents had been together for 17 years at that point and were finally able to exchange rings and vows and have their love recognized in the eyes of the law. While that was certainly meaningful, marriage also held more pragmatic benefits. When both me and my sister were born, my mother had to go through the process of legally adopting each of us so that if anything happened to my other mother, she would have legal custody. Additionally, before they were married, the other would not be able to make life or death decisions if something tragic did happen to either one of them, or in some cases even be allowed in the hospital room, as they wouldn’t be considered a “family member.” It would take another seven years before this right to marriage, and the right to the benefits that come along with it, was extended to LGBTQ couples all across the country, when the Supreme Court ruled in the case of Obergefell v. Hodges that same-sex couples are entitled to the same right to marry as straight couples.
Now, all that may seem to be a great deal of progress to be made in nine years, and that’s because it is. It’s undeniably easier and safer to start a same-sex family today than it was in 2006. But there remains a vocal minority who, just like those first-graders, staunchly believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman and a family should consist of “a mommy and a daddy.” From the moment Obergefell v. Hodges was decided, these individuals have been attempting to sidestep the protections it affords with their ultimate goal being its reversal.
And a mere five years later, this goal appears to be in reach, as one of their number, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, is a Senate confirmation away from becoming Justice Amy Coney Barrett. If confirmed, she would join justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, who just last week publicly criticized Obergefell v. Hodges and called for the case to be revisited on the grounds of violation of religious liberty. Barrett, a religious dogmatist herself, would almost certainly side with Thomas and Alito, as would the other two conservative justices already on the court. If confirmed, Barrett would serve as the vote needed to overturn the case.
While Barrett’s confirmation hearings have already begun, there is still hope that her confirmation and the potential confirmation of more conservative justices over the next four years, which could have disastrous results for LGBTQ families, can be prevented. So when you cast your vote this November, think about the lives that vote could directly and fundamentally impact. I hope that you choose to vote for kindness, for compassion, for families and ultimately, for love.

Bloom said the town hall allowed the senators to update the community on information regarding the spring semester and hear concerns from their constituents to advocate on their behalf in the SA.
Student Association first-year senators hosted a town hall with parents and students to hear participants’ concerns about the virtual spring semester, a decision attendees said is causing “confusion and distress.”
Officials announced earlier this month that “most” graduate and all undergraduate courses will stay virtual for the spring semester. SA first-year undergraduate senators Jack Bloom, Charlene Richards and Yan Xu facilitated the Zoom meeting with more than 50 participants who voiced concerns about freshmen’s “serious” mental health issues, an “inadequate” financial aid response from officials and an overall poor commitment by the school to freshmen students, many of whom said they’re considering transferring to other schools.
Bloom said the town hall allowed the senators to update the community on information regarding the spring semester and hear concerns from their constituents to advocate on their behalf in the SA.
“It’s a bummer, but it’s pretty much a done deal that all undergraduate courses will be conducted online next semester,” he said. “That’s a decision made by the faculty and the administration is not going to change.”
Richards said housing options will still be available for students with “extenuating” circumstances, but plans for increasing the number of students on campus have not been announced yet.
“If we do advocate for ourselves and push for that option of on-campus housing for the spring semester, there is hope that things can change with adequate guidelines and safety protocols in place,” she said.
Participants said the lack of experience of being on campus and interacting with the GW community has caused freshmen in particular to feel “isolated” in the virtual learning environment because they have not created communities on campus. Multiple students said a lack of mental health resources offered by the University have further worsened their experience.
Freshman Treasure D’Souza said if they were on campus, the experience would give them an opportunity to make friends because freshmen are “lonely” and “really struggling” in the virtual setting. She said administrators did not send out a survey to ask students how they felt about returning to campus before making the decision – a survey students intended to receive – and officials settled on a virtual semester too soon.
“I don’t think that they could decide for the entire spring based on what is going on right now because things could change,” she said. “I think that was a big mistake on their part.”
A parent of a freshman said the decision to have a virtual spring semester was “simply an excuse,” and further action should have been taken by administrators to try present possible models of in-person instruction. She referred to institutions across the country, like the University of Michigan and Syracuse University, that are also holding virtual classes but with their students living on campus.
“I totally understand the fall, but they had five months to figure this out,” the mother said. “So to say that they probably won’t open in the spring when they could use the models that other schools used and were successful with – that’s pathetic.”
Syracuse University officials allowed students to move back to campus for the fall 2020 semester with face coverings enforced on the grounds and  regular testing and with students ending the semester before Thanksgiving.
Freshman Brooke Stallman said she does not have any ties to GW because she has not lived on campus and therefore she and fellow freshmen have a bigger incentive to change schools.
“As freshmen, we have more opportunity to just switch to another school or defer or completely abandon GW, so I don’t really understand why they’re not doing more to try to hold on and retain those freshmen,” Stallman said.

Arie Dubnov, the director of the Judaic studies program, said faculty and students have bonded as they navigate the online semester.
Professors said they have adapted well to virtual learning, but the threat of budget cuts has damaged their confidence in GW.
Faculty said last semester that online learning forced them to adapt their teaching methods and develop new teaching strategies, and some struggled to replicate arts and science activities. At the start of this semester, professors said they were “excited” about the online fall semester, but almost halfway through the fall, they said they are bogged down by the stress of school-wide layoffs and other financial cuts.
LaKeisha McClary, an assistant professor of chemistry, said she feels stressed by the “uncertainty” of layoffs and worried about faculty salary cuts before GW ruled them out late last month. She said she needed to find ways to cope with the uncertainty of her job in addition to virtual learning. 
Officials also decided not to raise salaries for promoted faculty as part of budget cuts, a decision the Faculty Senate resisted last month.
“It took up a lot of brain matter,” McClary said. “And the unfortunate thing about it is that was mental energy I wasn’t spending working on my class, trying to help students, and all that because I was just literally trying to function myself, and if I can’t function myself, I can’t really help other people.”
“We have seen faculty and students protest against the administration, though they have remained mostly silent. So I really hope in the near future more bridges are built so the University shares more of their thoughts and ideas.”
McClary said she appreciates that officials announced the spring semester will be held online “sooner rather than later” so professors have more time to prepare, but she added that she was looking forward to teaching some of her upper-level chemistry labs in person.
“For the lab classes there is some concern, frustration about what that’s going to be like, especially for the upper-level classes, because we’re preparing them for the next level of upper-level classes,” McClary said.
She said some students have been understanding that faculty are limited in their teaching abilities this semester while others have largely checked out of online learning. She said she has noticed more students have chosen to stay after class to ask her questions or attend her office hours this semester.
Ivy Ken, an associate professor of sociology, said her students have been treating each other with “a little more grace than usual.” She said her students seem to appreciate the time she spent this summer making her classes visually interesting.
But she said the University’s ongoing budget cuts have hurt morale for herself and other faculty.
Ken said officials could have drawn more money from GW’s endowment to alleviate the stress of layoffs, a suggestion made by Columbian College of Arts and Sciences faculty while GW considered other budget cuts this summer.
“Faculty are despondent, thinking about our staff colleagues struggling because of this,” she said in an email. “It didn’t have to be this way. We know the administration could have made other choices than to fire the most vulnerable members of our community during a pandemic.”
But Ken said despite the impending budget cuts, faculty seem to be “banding together” to resist the “harmful actions” of administrators.
Students, faculty, staff and alumni have launched more than a dozen petitions, letters and statements in the past few months calling for University President Thomas LeBlanc to resign or to reverse recent financial decisions.
“People talk about the ‘negative press’ our University has gotten like that’s a bad thing,” she said. “But it’s not. It’s wonderful when there’s a forum to speak truth to power, and the publicity GW has gotten is about students, staff and faculty raising their voices to remind the administration and the public what a university is all about.”
Paul Carrillo, a professor of international economics, said he is “optimistic” about the rest of the fall semester and is “happy” to work at GW despite the financial cuts and transition online. He said while layoffs are “unfortunate,” they are a necessary part of keeping GW “financially healthy.”
“COVID-19 is a public health crisis that affects all institutions, and some adjustments need to be made,” he said. “We are all suffering from this national health crisis, but this situation at GW is not necessarily that different from any other private institution.”
He said officials have provided faculty with online resources to facilitate virtual learning, like their own Zoom accounts to hold online classes. GW offers FLEX, or Forward Looking EXplorations, teaching camps to teach professors “effective course design” during remote learning.
But Carrillo added that administrators should be more transparent about ongoing layoffs and budget cuts, which he said has worried faculty and other GW employees.
“We have seen faculty and students protest against the administration, though they have remained mostly silent,” he said. “So I really hope in the near future more bridges are built so the University shares more of their thoughts and ideas. I’m optimistic we can get over this, but we need more communication. That is key.”
Arie Dubnov, an associate professor of history and the director of the Judaic studies program, said faculty have expressed that they feel they’re “in the same boat” as students, which has helped them navigate the virtual semester.
“The students are doing the best they can, and that motivates us,” he said. “There is something very humbling about having students see that the professor on the other side of the screen is human.”
Dubnov said virtual learning has allowed officials to open up experiences like alumni or author speaking events to a larger public via Zoom and has given students the time to attend events that they might not have been able to in other circumstances.
“Our menu as a university is not as rich as it would have been in a normal year, but at the same time in a normal year students are so busy running from internships to class, and now you’re stuck at home,” he said.

Students interviewed said their motivation and enthusiasm have tanked as they prepare for another few months of online classes.
After working toward her bachelor’s for about nine years, senior Stephanie Ratajczak was looking forward to celebrating Commencement as the first in her family to graduate from college. 
Then, GW announced that for the second year straight, students will likely not graduate on the National Mall, and the rest of the academic year will be held online.
Ratajczak said her focus in classes has been “completely shot” since the University moved online in March and has struggled to balance her time between two in-person jobs and classes. She said she’s set up a study corner at her home in Hyattsville, Maryland, and is thankful for her professors who have granted her extensions when she is overwhelmed about completing assignments.
“And it’s not even general laziness or distractions by the things in my house,” Ratajczak said. “I sit down in my study corner, and I’m ready to go. And I open research articles to look up sources for referring to while writing. When I read, my eyes go over the same sentences five, six, seven times, and none of the words stick in my brain.”
“Luckily, I saw one professor because we had a happy hour. Other than that, I’ll never see any of them again, that I’ve been working with for three, four years and even friends.“
Ratajczak is one of a dozen students who said while they understand officials’ decision to continue virtual instruction this spring, they’re worried about feeling burnout after months of learning away from campus. Students said they are bracing for the next online semester by taking easier classes and moving out of their homes to maintain focus. 
“For safety’s sake, I’m glad we’re doing online classes, but my morale is shot,” Ratejczak said.
Senior Kayla Larmore, a speech, language and hearing sciences major, said receiving the news that her final semester of college would be online in the same email as learning about Commencement made her feel like officials “dismissed” the significance of graduation for students.
“I think it was also premature to say [Commencement is] not possible after they also promised that the class from last year would graduate with us if they wanted to,” Larmore said. “You’re letting down two years of students that have also paid so much money and committed so much time to then getting dismissed in a little chunk of an email.”
Students launched a petition earlier this month calling on officials to reconsider holding an in-person Commencement on the National Mall, which has garnered more than 450 signatures.
Larmore said she wishes officials would allow seniors to take upper-level classes, like a senior seminar or capstone, in person to make the most out of the demanding class. 
She said it’s been hard to find motivation this semester to complete her classes and graduate school applications knowing she lacks connections and communication with peers and professors while studying online. She said it was disappointing to know she may not see professors she’s worked closely with throughout her college career again.
“Luckily, I saw one professor because we had a happy hour,” Larmore said. “Other than that, I’ll never see any of them again, that I’ve been working with for three, four years and even friends. All of it together, it does not feel like it’s the way to end this education even going into graduate school.”
Freshman Brooke Stallman, a biological anthropology major, said she’s been looking forward to attending college for years now, but her mental health has tanked since she started classes at home in Phoenix. She said she was confused why administrators had not made any accommodations for freshmen and seniors to take classes in person. 
Administrators had considered gradually phasing a spring in-person reopening that would prioritize freshmen and seniors. 
Stallman said she plans to apply for a spring housing arrangement because she has struggled to focus and find friends during the remote semester. She said if she is not accepted, she will have to continue taking classes in Arizona because she can’t afford D.C. housing.
“I’ll have bursts of productivity,” Stallman said. “I won’t really want to do anything for a day or so because the previous day was just so overwhelming. But then I’ll sit down and work on my computer for eight hours.”
Sophomore Katelyn Monostori said she wasn’t expecting the University’s spring announcement so early into the fall but is now considering taking a leave of absence next semester to focus on her mental health and possible internships. She said she’s had difficulty remaining optimistic and productive in classes, which have hurt her ability to retain information in class.
Monostori, a philosophy major, said the majority of her classes are discussion- and paper-based, which has required her to spend more time studying to understand new concepts. She said having classroom discussions over Zoom has made it harder to interact naturally and would prefer to wait to experience them in person.
“It’s very easy to fall behind because teachers are being flexible with due dates, which I really appreciate,” Monostori said. “And it’s been a big help. But then it’s also very easy to say, ‘Oh I’ll watch this week’s lecture next week,’ but next week also has a lecture.”
