Correction appended
The Panhellenic Association announced Feb. 10 the three chapters  in the running to become GW’s 11th social sorority.
After months of reviewing 12 applications from chapters across the country, Panhel narrowed the candidates for colonization to Kappa Alpha Theta, Zeta Tau Alpha and Kappa Delta.
Panhellenic President Marta Cofone said an extension committee, which included a representative from every chapter on campus, scored each potential chapter “based on their values and characteristics deemed important and similar to GW.”
The committee also considered the number of nearby chapters, alumnae groups and chapter leadership qualities, Cofone said.
Representatives from the three chapters will visit campus between Feb. 15 and March 2 to present to Panhel’s extension committee. The group will make its final selection March 10.
Valerie Berg, vice president of recruitment for Panhel, said the selected chapter would likely bring in new members next fall, but she does not know what its recruitment process would look like.
Chi Omega’s first recruitment was held in October 2008, a few weeks after the other nine chapters gave out their bids, and included information sessions for women interested in joining.
“My goal is to work with the new chapter to develop a plan for their first recruitment that will best suit both GW and the needs of the chapter,” Berg said.
When the committee voted last October on the idea of bringing a new chapter to campus, two chapters voted against it. Cofone said those two, which she declined to name, have since reversed their opposition to the expansion.
“Everyone is now on board because we have a growing community with an increasing number of girls going through formal recruitment each year,” Cofone said. “To sustain these numbers, a new chapter must be brought campus to join our GW Greek life community.”
In the last five years, the percentage of GW women involved in Greek life has nearly doubled, swelling from 15 percent in 2006 to nearly 30 percent in 2011 – a spike that has pressured existing chapters “to exceed their capacity and take unprecedentedly large new member classes,” according to an October report from the extension committee.
Kappa Alpha Theta was active at GW from 1946 to 1976, when Greek life participation started to wane on campus. The group was considered for recolonization in 2008. The organization is also colonized at the University of Maryland.
Kelley Galbreath Hurst, director of chapter services for the sorority’s national organization, said the chapter would be “delighted” to return to GW.
“It would be a tremendous honor to have the opportunity to bring that back to those women, as well as the Panhellenic community at GW,” Hurst said.
Zeta Tau Alpha, which had been a chapter at GW briefly in the 1920s, was invited to recolonize in 1995. The chapter declined the invitation, citing lack of housing and multiple chapters on campus that were below quota, according to the GW Greek life website.
Kappa Delta was colonized at the University from 1922 to 1968.
Representatives from the national organizations for Zeta Tau Alpha and Kappa Delta did not return requests for comment. Both chapters are also colonized at UMD.
The final chapters were scheduled to be named Feb. 3, but the announcement was postponed to allow the committee “more time to go over the applications to make sure we learn as much about each chapter as possible,” Cofone said.

This article was updated on Feb. 13, 2012 to reflect the following:
The Hatchet incorrectly reported that Kappa Delta had not been colonized at GW. The chapter was colonized from 1922 to 1968. We regret this error

Administrators are skeptical about the trajectory of online education after a startup company made a splash last month by offering free online courses taught by universities’ top professors.
Udemy, a for-profit company that allows users to create and sell courses, tapped into professors’ knowledge base with the launch of The Faculty Project Jan. 26. Twelve professors at universities like Vanderbilt, Northwestern and Colgate have developed free courses in subjects ranging from public health to Russian literature and music.
The Udemy courses – which are offered for no academic credit – are presented through a combination of media, often including video mash-ups in which the professor is seen talking and outlining graphs next to a presentation. Students can post comments and questions under the lectures to which professors might respond.
GW professors are not offering any courses through the project, which cost about $500 each to develop, director of The Faculty Project Tim Parks said. The company has to select professors to participate.
Academic administrators have yet to jump on board with free online courses, citing their costly upkeep as a deterrent.
Provost Steven Lerman said the University is looking closely into the online education marketplace, which “has a lot of different models floating around,” including Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s OpenCourseWare, which Lerman helped launch 10 years ago when he was a professor there. After a decade of offering free lecture videos to students around the world, MIT will start granting certificates to students who take the courses this spring in a new program called MITx.
“The hard question is how do you sustain those [courses]. Even if you get some money to help do it at first, there’s a care and feeding cost to these things,” Lerman said. “The courses have to be updated, certainly if you want to do something like give examinations to students and give them certificates.”
The University is making strides in offering more hybrid courses – taught partly in the classroom and partly online – as a way to mitigate dwindling classroom space and the pinch of the city-imposed population cap for on-campus student enrollment. GW also offers 60 degree and certificate programs that use a standard distance learning model where students never have to set foot on campus.
To keep up with the expenses of developing online options and help subsidize free course materials, some universities rely on grants or donations.
Stephen Ehrmann, vice provost for teaching and learning, said the separation between GW and elite institutions that are taking up free online education models comes from the significant grants pulled in yearly from foundations.
“GW has no plans to offer free online non-credit courses comparable to the ones offered by MIT and Stanford,” Ehrmann said. “When we get large gifts or foundation support, I’d like to see us use it to improve the education of GW students who are working hard to earn a degree,” instead of outside students seeking free online courses, he said.
Likening free online courses to “public television or the New York Public Library,” Ehrmann said, “You have to have a lot of money to offer them. If you can do it, it can be a real public service.”
Especially as tuition costs are spotlighted nationwide, Robert Garland, a Colgate professor who is teaching ancient Greek religion through Udemy, said no-cost courses open doors for people who cannot otherwise afford higher education.
“This is an important issue for all institutions of higher learning, that online learning is here to stay. What format classes will be in and how they’ll impact higher learning is not clear at this moment,” Garland said. “I certainly believe in trying to promote learning to a wider group of people.”
Other online education issues, including the costs of courses, will be on the docket for GW’s six-month-old Teaching and Learning Collaborative this spring, the advisory board’s lead faculty member Rahul Simha said.
The 19-person board was created to examine teaching strategies toward boosting student engagement in the classroom.
“It’s exciting that today’s technology allows certain kinds of scaling and cost efficiencies, so institutions of higher education need to figure out how to make use of that,” Simha, who is also a computer science professor, said.

The Metropolitan Police Department is ramping up tactics to shrink the number of robberies of electronics, which have accounted for nearly half the District’s robberies so far this year.
About 40 percent of the 476 robberies in 2012 involved snatching cell phones, iPods or tablets, according to MPD data. D.C. saw 4,146 total robberies last year, a slightly higher total than the 4,028 in 2010.
The unit began offering rewards up to $10,000 in late January for those who turn in robbery suspects or others who are illegally selling electronics, MPD spokeswoman Gwendolyn Crump said.
MPD Chief Cathy Lanier held a press conference Feb. 10 with Mayor Vincent Gray warning against electronics-targeted robberies. Gray touched on the issue in his State of the District address last week, saying MPD is working with the federal government and cell phone carriers to “render stolen devices useless” in response to a spike in robberies this year compared to the same time frame last year.
“Now we want to get the message out about how you can help give us information about who is committing robberies where electronic devices have been taken or who is illegally selling electronic devices,” Crump said. “Police want to make turning someone in for these crimes more profitable for folks that give them information than it is for those committing the robberies.”
As of Feb. 7, Crump said the department has arrested 141 suspects for robberies and is encouraging individuals to text message tips. The texting program, which saw 292 tips when it began in 2008, received 1,225 messages in 2011.
Three robberies hit the Foggy Bottom Campus this year as of Feb. 10, the University Police Department crime log shows.
UPD Chief Kevin Hay commended MPD’s new strategies.
“Once word gets out that arrests are being made as a result of reward generated tips, robbery numbers will decrease,” Hay said.

Where: 224 7th St., SE
Cover: No
Carded: Yes
Happy Hour: Monday through Friday 4 to 7 p.m., $4 house wines and $1 off all beers. Mondays: $4 Svedka vodka drinks 7 p.m. to close; Wednesdays: $4 pints of Fat Tire 7 p.m. to close
Bar Bells: 

Our Bar Belle roams around D.C. reviewing bars as she sees fit – if she can see straight after visiting them.
During a streak of mid-week drinking stereotypical of senior year, a trip to Eastern Market for a chill night with friends was exactly what my Wednesday night needed. With Hawk and Dove – a GW favorite – closed, we thought we would try the new owner’s Boxcar Tavern for a different neighborhood flavor.
Boxcar is a gastropub with a distinctly British décor. It offers an extensive wine list, a decent beer selection – including some imports – and unusually good food for a pub. On a separate menu, it boasts an eccentric selection of cocktails, including several that we were eager to try, and others that frankly scared me; one cocktail featured Irish whiskey, lemon peel, nutmeg syrup and hot water.
We came during prime dinner hours but waited only a few minutes before getting a comfortable table for five in the back. One benefit of dining and drinking at a gastropub is that you’ll have food infinitely better than normal pub fare, even if it comes at a higher price. As a result, the crowd is mainly young professionals and 30-somethings willing to pay slightly higher prices, as well as recent graduates living in the area. Maybe it’s because the bar is still new or because of the trip required to get there, but Boxcar doesn’t have a college student feel.
Boxcar offers an assortment of dishes that put a chef’s flare on typical pub options. Rather than eating your food out of a greasy basket with fries, you’ll have it on a white dish with a gourmet presentation. Unfortunately, the portions are a bit smaller than average. My mushroom and cheese ravioli – in a cream sauce, topped with Parmesan cheese and caramelized onions – was delicious, but I’m not sure the five small raviolis were worth the $11.
Eager to get to the point – drinking – I decided first to take advantage of the Wednesday night special of $4 Fat Tire draft pints, which are available from 7 p.m. until close at around 11 p.m. Then, I settled for the safest looking specialty cocktail. The Lockout Farm, $9, with light rum, Luxardo Maraschino cherry liqueur, lime juice and white grapefruit was tasty and strong, but a little too sweet.
At the other end of the spectrum, my friend bravely tried a drink that was a bit manly for her taste. The Stained Glass, with red burgundy and brut champagne on the rocks, $8, was a little rough for her first time trying burgundy, so when she couldn’t finish it, I stepped in to help. I couldn’t let perfectly good alcohol – even if it is bitter and woody tasting – go to waste. Again, the drink was strong, so no complaints in that department.
Intimidated by the other cocktails – many of them featuring scotch, brandy or whiskey – I turned to my trusty go-to, rum and Coke. It was weaker than I would have liked, especially after the strength of the other drinks I tried. But for less than half the price, at $4, it’s certainly a good alternative if you’re looking to have more than one or two well-crafted drinks.
By the end of the night, just after the 11 p.m. closing time, most of the seats and booths had emptied out. Even though the cocktails were slightly over-the-top, and we probably should have just stuck to beers and rails, Boxcar is ultimately a good choice for comfortably enjoying a couple of relaxed drinks with pals.

Robert Chernak’s office walls are plastered with Boston sports memorabilia, GW apparel and personal mementos. It’s always been a place where students feel free to speak about their concerns, seek his advice or share a suggestion.
This unique office represents a noteworthy individual whose relationship with the University began before some of us were even born – a senior administrator who has a strikingly laid-back and easy-going demeanor, someone who was always willing to have a frank and open conversation with students.
But after 24 years of service to the University, one of the student body’s enduring allies has decided to retire.
Chernak’s down-to-earth personality has allowed him to keep the pulse of student concerns. He trusts and respects students. Conversations with Chernak are never a one-way street – he is always willing to listen and to take any issues or concerns to heart. To Chernak, all students are mishpocheh.
And he is never afraid to wrestle with other top administrators in advocating for student causes.
His ability to be a constant supporter for students is critical at a University that often hides behind an opaque public relations cloak, which can distance the institution from students. While administrators often are guarded and vet their comments to the media and students, Chernak has always carried himself with a refreshing candor.
And while we will surely still see Chernak in his usual seat at basketball games – where he was once spotted rocking Ugg boots and argyle, redefining winter style – and will hear his unmistakable laugh on the street as he continues on as a professor, his retirement represents a tremendous loss for administration.
Whoever is Chernak’s eventual successor will have big shoes to fill.
And even though his distinctive office decorations will be gone, hopefully his legacy will remain.

Last week Student Association President John Richardson took his advocacy efforts above administrators’ heads to the Board of Trustees.
This move represents the last leg of Richardson’s efforts to accomplish his initiatives and goals – one where he must run at a full sprint.
Yet while the Board is the University’s highest governing body, it cannot be relied on to advocate for student concerns and issues.
Given that time is running out in his term, Richardson must now use his access and power in the most effective way possible and thoroughly lobby all relevant administrators for his causes.
He must present a formalized plan for fee transparency and funding for student space with the administration before his influence ends.
While it may have been helpful to put these day-to-day issues such as fees and student space on the board’s radar, the fate of his final efforts now hinges on his lobbying efforts within the administration.
Even if Richardson receives pushback from administrators regarding his advocacy efforts, he must continue to exhaust all of his lobbying options within the University before he turns to the board once again.
These final weeks of Richardson’s presidency will prove to be the final test of whether or not he can work with administrators to come to a final solution on the issues he has lobbied on for months.

Two more candidates entered the race for the Student Association’s No. 2 spot, bringing the total executive branch contenders to eight after registration closed Friday.
Efforts to preserve student space and expand career services have dominated platforms this spring. Candidates have also pledged to broaden SA outreach and streamline student organization funding – issues that have appeared annualy on election platforms.
Junior Abby Bergren, the first female to enter the race, said she would fight to expand student space on campus, create an electronic database of grants and fellowships aligned with career services and give greater freedom to graduate student groups, in line with many other candidates’ platforms this election season.
“GWork is incredibly successful in terms of finding internships, but there’s a lack of availability of different financial and academic resources,” Bergren said. She hopes to work with the Career Center to expand the database to include grants, fellowships, departmental scholarship opportunities and research assistant positions.
Bergren said she would also prioritize graduate student outreach, particularly to those in student organizations.
“We can’t turn a blind eye to them,” Bergren said, explaining that, in the past, this population of students has felt spurned by the SA. She said she would look at involving more graduate students in programming efforts or creating a committee exclusively charged with soliciting feedback from these students.
Regarding her role as leader of the SA senate, Bergren said she would adopt an “all hands on deck” approach to encourage senators to step up their commitment to the organization.
“I see the role of EVP as bridging the gap between the executive and the senators. I want everyone to be involved,” Bergren said.
Bergren is the vice president of College Democrats, the treasurer of the GW Band Program and a member of Colonial Brass.
Junior Austin Brewster avowed to take a different approach to the position than other candidates. Rather than “pushing” his own agenda, he said he would focus on concerns as they arise from the student body.
“The position of the executive vice president is to preside over the senate. I felt it not necessary to come in with an agenda,” he said.
Brewster said he intends to utilize his future connections with administrators to support the efforts of senators and cabinet members rather than his own ideas.
“I’m more of a passive leader. I try my best to support those I’m supervising,” Brewster said.
He said his primary goal is to create a centralized tutoring service to offer academic support across departments, potentially within the Marvin Center fourth or fifth floor. Under the existing model, students must seek out tutoring from their specific schools, which Brewster said deters students from taking advantage of the program.
He also wants to create a nationwide community service network for students and alumni to connect over the summer to volunteer in their communities. Brewster could not provide specific steps for launching the project, but said he would start by polling students to identify prime locations for service sites.
“GW is a service institute and we pride ourselves on the community service we do,” Brewster said.
Brewster is the president of the leadership-focused Black Men’s Initiative, an officer in the Black Student Union and a representative in the GW School of Business’s undergraduate programs office.
Five students will battle for president and three for executive vice president. The Joint Elections Committee will work to verify candidates’ applications, in addition to their academic and disciplinary records, by Feb. 13. Postering for campaigns begins Feb. 15. Student Association elections will be held Feb. 22 and Feb. 23.

Last week, I came across The Hatchet’s article, “Culture clash spurs unease in LGBT center’s space” (Feb. 2, p. 3). As an openly gay student who regularly uses the LGBT Resource Center, I was shocked.
What was this “culture clash” that I had somehow missed since the Resource Center began sharing space with the Multicultural Student Services Center?
As I read through the article, I became confused. I looked and looked for a culture clash, but I never found one. All I managed to find were one student’s concerns that others might be afraid to use the Resource Center for fear of being “outed.” A valid concern? Yes. A culture clash? Definitely not.
The collaboration and cooperation of different communities at the MSSC is the Center’s greatest attribute. Students, faculty and staff are all welcoming and supportive. I have never witnessed so much as a disagreement, let alone a culture clash.
The writers would also have you believe that the LGBT Resource Center is still “adjusting to its new leadership.” In reality, however, the center’s director Timothy Kane has gone above and beyond to expand the resources and accessibility of the LGBT Resource Center. He is fully dedicated and committed to supporting LGBT and questioning students, as well as the rest of the community.
The students, faculty and organizations using the Multicultural Student Services Center serve as a fine model of how communities can come together to celebrate diversity and promote unity. The incorporation of the LGBT Resource Center into the MSSC building has been an example of positive progress at GW, not a clash of cultures. To use the unsubstantiated complaints of one student to create an inflammatory headline and article is deplorable.
It is beneath the journalistic standards of this paper and an insult to the George Washington University community.
