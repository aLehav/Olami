Allee Sangiolo often sees films at the E Street Cinema, but Tuesday she will get to watch a work of her own.
Sangiolo, 24, co-wrote a short documentary titled “The Capital Buzz,” one of 140 films featured in the ninth annual DC Shorts Film Festival. The alumna originally helped create the film as a project for her six-month graduate program at the GW Institute for Documentary Filmmaking.
“It’s kind of cool to come out of graduate school with a film,” Sangiolo said. “I mean, that’s not really an experience a lot of people get, and I have something to show for it.”
The documentary centers around the concept of urban beekeeping and the growing trend of hobbyist beekeepers who operate from their metropolitan homes.
Sangiolo and her seven team members have entered “The Capital Buzz” in four film festivals since their graduation in June 2011, an effort pushed forward with $250 from the Documentary Center program.
DC Shorts is showing the film at three separate screenings, the first of which happened this past Saturday at the U.S. Navy Memorial.
“Ultimately, we just wanted people to see it. You spend all this time working on something, and to just show it once would be kind of a shame,” Sangiolo said.
Diana El-Osta, the producer of “The Capital Buzz,” first conceptualized the film after reading an article about urban beekeeping in Brooklyn, N.Y.
“When we were generating ideas for the program, sort of a light bulb went off, and I wondered if that was a trend that was taking place in Washington, D.C.,” El-Osta said.
The film’s main character, Jeff Miller, maintains various beehives from the roof of his Georgetown townhouse. He accesses his hives through a passage in his bathroom ceiling, which he reaches by climbing a ladder placed in his bathtub.
Miller founded the non-profit DC Honeybees, an organization dedicated to educating people about the process and benefits of beekeeping. DC Honeybees has installed 65 hives across the District, according to “The Capital Buzz” website.
El-Osta said the team grew to appreciate Miller for his quirky personality.
One scene shows Miller, assuring a passerby that his bees are friendly as they swarm a nearby tree.
Even though one team member was stung five times in a row during one of the first shoots, Miller’s casual nature around the bees was comforting, El-Osta said.
Miller wore little to no protection as he handled the hives, and El-Osta said many members of the team began to do the same.
“We would be at shoots, and sometimes we wouldn’t even wear the protective veil, because we became so comfortable around bees,” El-Osta said.
Nina Seavey, the director and founder of the Documentary Center at GW, said Miller himself contributed to the film’s success.
“The film in particular has had a really long life,” Seavey said. “Some of it is because the main character is just charming. When you get a character like that, you just know you’re golden.”
Seavey said “The Capital Buzz” offered a great window into an important issue, and added that the film’s character-driven nature makes it truly entertaining.
A large part of that, she said, is because the film’s team was able to work so well together.
“Every once in a while, you just kind of hit a high note, and this team definitely hit that note,” Seavey said.

A housekeeping employee is suing the University for upward of $1.3 million, claiming she faced racial and gender discrimination, assault and negligent supervision.
Rebecca Ashitey filed a lawsuit in D.C. Superior Court Sept. 1, alleging that a University Police officer had discriminated against her since May 2011 and assaulted her five months later.
Ashitey worked 5 a.m. to 2 p.m. shifts in the Marvin Center and claimed in her complaint that she faced an “endless barrage of questions” from an officer – identified in the complaint as J. Cates – at the building’s entrance before being allowed to enter. She is a citizen of Ghana and a resident of Alexandria, Va.
All individuals entering the Marvin Center outside of business hours are required to show identification, but Ashitey alleged that Cates also asked for her name, social security number and date of birth, in addition to her GWorld identification number, each time she arrived to work starting May 2011.
Ashitey began working at GW in 2001, according to court documents. She also claimed she was assaulted by the officer on Oct. 17, 2011.
Cates allegedly “attacked her from behind and threw her to the ground,” according to court documents. Other UPD officers arrived on scene and allegedly handcuffed her.
Ashitey claims she was then taken into a room for a short period of time before being released, and later experienced “intense pain” and visited GW Hospital, according to court documents.
She claimed she had to miss at least 12 weeks of work and has undergone physical and emotional therapy as a result of the incident.
University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard declined to comment on whether or not Cates is still employed at the University, saying GW does not comment on pending litigation.
Sherrard also declined to comment on whether or not UPD was notified of the allegations.
Ashitey and her attorney, John Davis, declined to comment.

For months, GW has been turning away food trucks that have tried to add GWorld machines to attract student customers.
Nearly a dozen trucks, like CapMac, Tasty Kabob, AZN Eats, Sauca and Best Mexican Burritos and Tortas said they want to accept GWorld payments, but the University does not offer trucks that option, hindering their business.
Matt Gray, owner and co-founder of Amorini Panini, said GW turned down his sandwich shop’s truck last spring. He applied again this week, looking to draw students to his shop on the corner of 9th and F streets by becoming a Colonial Cash vendor. He said he plans to add a GWorld machine to his truck, which frequents H Street.
“I would really love to offer GWorld,” Gray said.
The Lebanese truck Kababji D.C. added a GWorld machine to its truck last May after manager Reginald Cooper found a loophole in the system. Because his Dupont Circle shop, Kababji Grill, is a Colonial Cash partner, he was able to purchase an additional machine for his truck.
But not all of the dozens of food trucks that line H Street started as brick-and-mortar shops, and these mobile eateries have called on GW to expand its Colonial Cash partnerships.
“We receive constant requests about the GWorld card,” Ivan Miller, owner of the ice cream truck The Orange Cow, said. “Opening up the ability to accept the GWorld Card beyond brick-and-mortar establishments would be a win-win for all.”
Brian Arnoff, owner of CapMac, said he wanted to add GWorld to make payments easier for students, but knows the University does not offer the card readers to food trucks. He said he was interested when former Student Association president John Richardson approached him last year about lobbying the University to add food trucks to GWorld.
“I replied [to Richardson’s email], but they never got back to me,” Arnoff said, adding that he has not applied to be a Colonial Cash partner, because he knows the policy has not changed.
Richardson said his campaign to add GWorld to food trucks last spring looked promising, because the card office was initially receptive. At the end of the year, he said he thought it was “a done deal,” adding that the process must have been halted by a rule similar to the GWorld requirement that vendors are based in D.C.
University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard declined to provide the number of food trucks that have requested to apply to the Colonial Cash plan.
“The University is reviewing the possibility of adding food trucks to the GWorld program. Details are not yet finalized,” Sherrard said. “We would evaluate food trucks becoming members of the GWorld program through the same process we have used in previous years with other merchants who have requested to join the program.”
Freshmen, sophomores and juniors who live on campus have $1,000 pre-loaded onto their GWorlds, with on-campus seniors receiving $500 a semester on their cards.
There are 111 Colonial Cash partners across D.C.

The University is looking to establish a pre-college program to bring foreign students to the Virginia Science and Technology Campus in order to help them brush up on their English and prepare for a potential academic future in the U.S.
The program, still in the early planning stages, would launch as the University and colleges nationwide see sharp rises in the number of foreign students – some of whom would need training in English before enrolling in American universities.
The pre-college program is one of six initiatives announced Sept. 4 by the Innovation Task Force, which pitches ideas to add revenue and cut costs for the University. It will be headed by dean of the Virginia campus Ali Eskandarian.
Some details – like where GW would house the students – are still up in the air because the program’s launch is likely years away, ITF co-chair Craig Linebaugh said. But classes would take place at the Ashburn, Va. campus to help GW meet the city-regulated enrollment cap that limits the number of full-time students at the Foggy Bottom Campus, forcing the University to use online programs and satellite campuses to boost tuition revenues.
“The international gap year would allow students to spend a year getting ready to really dive into academic programs in the States, whether it be on a language basis or cultural basis,” Linebaugh said. “It would really help them prepare for rigorous academic pursuits.”
David Lawlor, ITF co-chair and senior associate vice president for finance, said the program is designed for students not enrolled at GW, but added that it could become a recruiting tool to attract students from other countries.
The program could also balance the drive for foreign tuition dollars with enhancing academic quality, said Richard Edelstein, a research associate at University of California-Berkeley’s Center for Studies in Higher Education.
But he warned that as universities push recruitment strategies in countries like China and India – whose students mostly pay full tuition – it can lead to “a corrupted admissions process where the agency recruits students who may not have the requisite competence in English or are otherwise poorly prepared for university level studies.”
Enrollment of foreign graduate students climbed about 39 percent this year, with enrollment surging 60 percent for foreign undergraduates over the last eight years. Most international undergraduates do not receive merit aid from the University or federal grants to enroll, so their tuition bills could cushion the GW’s budget as it increases financial aid overall.
University spokeswoman Latarsha Gatlin said Eskandarian could not comment on the program because it is in the early planning stages.
The School of Engineering and Applied Science offers a similar program to students already accepted into its department of computer science and department of electrical and computer engineering. Dubbed the Bridge Program, international students who struggle with English skills take 20 hours of classroom instruction every week through Georgetown’s intensive English as a Foreign Language Program.
While the idea of a distinct gap year for non-matriculated international students has little precedent among U.S. universities, the University of California-Davis offers a Global Achievement Program for international high school graduates.
Wesley Young, director of services for the program, said he stresses programming and cultural integration for participating students.
“It’s important during this year to provide lots of opportunities to interact and get to know a variety of Americans and American experiences,” Young said. “Just coming to the U.S. and sitting in classes with international students misses one of the major advantages the gap program can provide.”

Freshmen in the Dean’s Scholars in Shakespeare program joined a living community and will take part in expanded course offerings on sonnets and soliloquies this fall.
The University added scholarships and housed the 15 students in the Shakespeare program together in Cole Hall on the Mount Vernon Campus to establish it as an anchor for the English department, which has declined by about 30 percent since 2008, according to the Office of Institutional Research. Students will also take a 10-day trip to London, partially subsidized by GW, during their sophomore year.
Alexander Huang, the new program director and a Shakespeare scholar, said he hopes the program will encourage students to think about literature and play production in a global context, spurring undergraduate research.
“There is no other program focused solely on Shakespeare in the country,” Huang said. “It allows students to develop the skills most relevant to their later career.”
The program, established in 2006, now requires students to take part in five Shakespeare-focused courses over two years instead of the previous format of two courses in one year.
Students will visit theaters in D.C. to learn about the life and works of Shakespeare.
GW hopes to further expand the Dean’s Scholars program in other departments as well, using the Shakespeare one as a model, Huang said.
English department chair Robert McRuer said he hopes the program will increase student interest in the department. The English department counted about 112 major students this year – just one more than last year.
“I think it will absolutely bring more people through our doors,” McRuer said, adding he was not concerned about enrollment, because English is still one of the most popular majors in the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences.
Freshman Katherine Bradshaw, who is double majoring in English and classical studies, praised the program’s living-and-learning component.
“I think the best part is that we have multiple opportunities to discuss Shakespeare informally throughout the day, because we live near each other. We’ve already had some lively debates about plays and characters,” she said.

No institution of higher education is immune to cheating – even on a large scale, and even at what has been called man’s greatest university.
The cheating scandal at Harvard University has dominated the national conversation about higher education since it broke this August and has raised several questions about the prevalence and nature of cheating on college campuses.
There, 125 students are under investigation for unauthorized collaboration on a take-home final from last spring in an Introduction to Congress course. If proved, this will be the largest-scale cheating occurrence at an Ivy League university in recent memory.
Sometimes, cheating is as obvious as answers scrawled on the back of a hand or copying and pasting excerpts from published sources. But more often, it’s a murky infraction, ranging from misunderstood instructions to unapproved collaboration.
There’s no doubt that academic cheating is reprehensible. But the events being investigated at Harvard show us that it isn’t always black and white, and there’s a lot GW can learn from the incident – especially as its curriculum increasingly stresses collaborative learning.
But to begin, let’s look at the numbers.
Two-thirds of college students have admitted to “cheating on tests, homework and assignments,” according to a 2011 study of more than 14,000 undergraduate students by International Center for Academic Integrity co-founder Donald McCabe. And the biggest predictor of cheating is knowing someone else who cheated, according to a 2009 study by the American Psychological Association.
So most students cheat, and knowing someone who cheats makes you more likely to do the same. It’s a catch-22 that is tough to police and tough to beat.
GW has a modified honor code, which means students are dealt consequences based on the nature of their infractions. The Office of Academic Integrity is separate from the judicial arm of the University, and a hybrid of students and faculty determine what consequences students receive.
Under the University’s modified honor code, Harvard students being investigated for “unauthorized collaboration” would likely only receive a failing grade on the assignment, Director of the Office of Academic Integrity Tim Terpstra said.
Fortunately, the University is willing to acknowledge the existence of cheating on campuses with its modified honor code and its dedication to case-by-case consequences – a laudable position compared to that of Harvard, which has no codified set of infractions and penalties when it comes to academic integrity.
But as GW continues to push collaborative learning and online education, it must better prepare for the dangers that accompany group work. Professors can’t just explain the academic honesty policy as a cursory aside during syllabus week – expectations for each assignment should be outlined for students.
Can students work with each other when studying but not when completing a take-home test? Are they prohibited from turning in the same answers, but still permitted to share sources with each other? Tell them.
And professors shouldn’t just be clear about what is and is not authorized for an assignment to justify their consequences, but instead to defend the student from infractions. Students should, without confusion, be able to point to the guidelines and how they met them.
In addition, longer-term projects should have checkpoints throughout the semester to keep students from plagiarizing in an eleventh-hour effort to finish a big assignment. We all procrastinate, but breaking up assignments can thwart that threat.
And as in the case of Harvard’s cheating incident, huge lectures lead students to believe they can get away with it. So much of that mentality stems from students’ apathy toward large lectures, compared with their engagement in small seminars and classes. While professors teaching courses with hundreds of students can’t check in with each one, making syllabi, lectures and projects as engaging and clear as possible could help curb cheating in big classes.
The truth is that it’s tempting to cheat, especially when work is diffused in a group, allowed to be done at home or assigned over a long period of time. And whether we like it or not, cheating happens – a lot. It’s naive to think one code or strategy can be the silver-bullet solution to this issue.
Students today are spread thin and overworked. Expectations are tremendous. We have to get the grades, have extracurriculars, excel at internships, maintain a social life and attempt to get a job straight out of college.
Succumbing to cheating – especially milder forms of it – isn’t just something that students do because they know they can get past the professor. It’s something they do to get by.
So while cheating is an egregious offense, particularly in the world of academia where there is no greater good than truth, there are more factors at play than the face value of a stolen excerpt or shared answer.
It’s heartening to see that the Office of Academic Integrity understands that. But the culture that remains so often tempts students to cheat because it’s easy and there’s so much more to get done.
And until that culture is reversed, everything else is just a short-term solution to an issue that plagues even the most revered of campuses.

Despite a brief flurry of success, the Colonials’ early season woes continued this weekend.
After tallying its second win in a row in Wednesday’s home opener against UMBC, GW (2-9) hoped to carry some of that confidence into the Spring Hill Suites at Arundel Mills Invitational.
But once again, the Colonials found themselves departing a road competition winless, falling to No. 16 Tennessee as well as Maryland in straight sets, before losing to Boston College 3-1 in their finale.
“Even though our record is what it is, we’re learning a ton right now,” head coach Amanda Ault said. “We’re really going through adversity, and I know it’s gonna be a good thing for us later down the road, because we’ve already gone through it.”
In Friday’s matchup against Tennessee, the Colonials fell victim to a Volunteer defense that totaled 12 team blocks and forced 22 errors in the match. This, along with GW’s lackluster .127 attack percentage was enough for the sweep by scores of 20-25, 22-25 and 16-25.
The Colonials’ best chance to stop Tennessee’s momentum came in the second set when they hit a match-high .256, but some late clutch kills helped seal the win for the Volunteers. Senior hitter Lauren Whyte was the bright spot for the Colonials, recording 14 kills and nine digs, while sophomore Kelsey Newman added nine kills and seven digs of her own.
“Friday night, we really battled,” Ault said. “That’s something we’ve been talking about up to this point, just going in and playing our game and seeing what happens. It showed them that we can play at a high level – we just need to be consistent.”
Saturday’s match against Maryland brought to light another key issue that GW faces: allowing early leads. In the first set, GW let the Terrapins jump out to a commanding 8-1 advantage, forcing the Colonials to go on a 7-2 run of their own just to keep it close. Maryland, who hit .387 in the set, would eventually score seven of the final 10 points to secure the win 25-18. It was a hole that Ault said underlined the Colonials’ need to establish dominance early in the match.
“The biggest obstacle for us is putting ourselves in a hole early in the game,” Ault said. “To our credit, we fight back, and we’re even the game, but if we could just establish ourselves early and do that throughout the games, they would go much differently.”
The Colonials were able to win their first set of the tournament in their final match against Boston College. A 7-0 Colonial run helped the team take a 21-19 lead and then a small 3-0 run allowed them to take the first set 25-21. But BC returned with a vengeance, winning the second set 25-23 and then using a 14-7 closing run to take the third set 25-17.
GW did everything it could to try and force a deciding fifth set, but another early 9-2 hole put the team in a bind. Despite a late 24-23 advantage, the Eagles closed out strong to end the match 28-26. Freshman setter Jessica Lubic posted a double-double for the Colonials with 42 assists and 13 digs, while senior libero Candace Silva-Martin solidified GW’s defense with 18 digs of her own. Despite the three losses in the tournament, Ault was positive about the effort and discipline her players showed.
“This past weekend, you know the win-losses don’t really show it, but we did take a big step,” Ault said. “We played some pretty high-level volleyball. We’re still just missing that last piece of really putting it all together to get those wins.”
Looking ahead, the Colonials will face their next five opponents at home, a change of pace from the 10 road matches they’ve already played thus far. Ault sees this as a time to further the progress the team has made over the past few weeks and continue to get comfortable with one another on the court.
“We talked yesterday about taking steps forward and taking steps backwards, and if you continue to do that, you’re not going to go anywhere,” Ault said. “We did some good things this weekend, but now we have to build on them and continue to move forward, because A-10’s is right around the corner.”

Head coach Craig Jones looked at his players after a two-goal loss Friday afternoon and demanded a charged response Sunday.
He knew his team could rebound from the 3-1 defeat at the hands of VMI to respond decisively, regaining ground in both its record and its confidence. So when GW took the field Sunday in the second game of the Jay Sculley Memorial Tournament, the team played its way to a solid 2-0 victory over Liberty.
“We asked the players for a response, so I think today, defensively, we just seemed to work a lot harder,” Jones said. “Overall, the team as a group just defended a lot better. That was the biggest lesson for us … that if we don’t give goals away, we’ll look like we’re going to score. And that happened today.”
The Colonials allowed two goals in the first seven minutes of Friday’s game. Though sophomore Andri Alexandersson netted his first goal of the season to put GW on the board, VMI responded once more before the end of the half to bring the score to the eventual final tally, 3-1.
Allowing three goals pointed to the team’s defensive breakdown Friday, Jones said, a lapse in play he looked to his team to correct in time for Sunday’s competition.
“The biggest disappointment from Friday was the goals we conceded,” Jones said.
The Colonials headed into Sunday’s game mentally prepared to rebound from the loss, with an extra emphasis on maintaining strong play in the back to avoid defensive breakdowns. In the first, GW traded shots with Liberty, highlighted by senior Seth Rudolph’s dramatic breakaway, which ended with the keeper stopping his shot. Neither team found the back of the net, and the half ended in a scoreless tie.
After the break, the Colonials made adjustments to their play and focused on getting the ball wide. And in the team’s first chance to get the ball past Liberty’s defense, freshman Ross Higgins sent a pass to Rudolph at the far post, who headed the ball into the net for the first tally of the game.
Less than 10 minutes after the first goal, Rudolph – who had been practicing free kicks throughout the weekend – had the chance to take one. He buried the ball in the back of the net, bringing the score to 2-0 and scoring both goals in what would eventually become a Colonial shutout victory.
“I’m absolutely delighted. We were looking for a response from the team after Friday’s loss. I thought the guys came out strong, which is what we wanted to do,” Jones said. “And they showed a little fight and a little character and a little toughness that we may have lacked on Friday and got the win.”
The weekend’s 1-1 record for the Colonials shows the team’s mentality: After a mistake, Jones said his players are focused on staying mentally tough and responding to slips in play or losses with renewed effort.
The Colonials travel to Providence next Sunday, when they will take on the Bryant Bulldogs.
“For me, it’s a very good team. They’re going to win some games this year,” Jones said.
