A student launched a petition earlier this month calling on officials to reinstate Deborah Baker, the senior academic adviser for pre-law students in the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences, who was recently laid off.
Sophomore Karina Ochoa Berkley, a political science and philosophy major who started the petition, said the petition was signed by students, faculty and alumni who have responded to the situation with “outrage, disappointment and overall concern.” Provost Brian Blake said his office ran a study in June to determine the efficiency of many academic units including GW’s advising structure, which found that GW had about 193 students per undergraduate adviser compared to the national average of 250 students per undergraduate adviser.
He said he made the “hard decision” to change the ratio to 220 undergraduate students per adviser after seeing the results of the review, which he said is still better than the national average but “more in line with what we can afford.”
“I collaborated with a group of faculty senators and deans to evaluate the structure and assure that the University is appropriately sized, considering our need to mitigate budget challenges due to the pandemic,” Blake said in an email.
He said he subdivided the reduction in “certain” schools, colleges and units, and deans made decisions on how to manage the reductions.
Blake said there are still “several” advisers in the CCAS advising team who hold law degrees, and some have played “key roles” in pre-law advising before. He said these advisers will coordinate with the Elliott School of International Affairs to “coordinate the pre-law effort across schools.”
“They also have secured support for pre-law from the Writing Center, which has the capacity to review applications, and Career Services, which has alumni in legal fields who can offer advice and mentorship,” he said.
Berkley said students are worried about their “future prospects in law” without access to a pre-law adviser, alumni are upset that a “crucial asset” that helped some of them get into law school will be taken away and faculty are upset that students do not have the resources for the “quality education” that they signed up for.
She said officials are making decisions that are “adversely and directly” impacting students’ futures, and they need to understand that student resources are not “pawns” and their decisions have “serious consequences” on students’ livelihoods.
“We understand the financial implications of the pandemic and the uncomfortable situation it puts the administration in,” Berkley said in an email. “However, the administration has shown a clear disregard for mitigating the impact their decisions have on traditional academic values and the student experience.”
She said she sent the petition to Blake, University President Thomas LeBlanc, Vice President of Student Affairs and Dean of Students Cissy Petty, Vice President for Development and Alumni Relations Donna Arbide and Vice Provost of Enrollment and Student Success Jay Goff. She said more than 500 people have signed the petition, and “roughly” 300 chose to express their grievances with the decision.
Berkeley said she intends to send one of these messages to officials every day to show what Baker meant to the GW community and “what it has lost in her termination.”
“Her reinstatement is of paramount importance,” she said in an email to the officials. “We hope you will make the right decision.”

In early June, less than 10 blocks from campus, President Donald Trump held a photo shoot in front of St. John’s Church in the midst of protests over Black lives and police shootings. Later reports indicated that during this political stunt, the Department of Defense considered deploying “heat rays” and sound cannons against protesters who stood between the White House and church. 
When I first heard this news, I thought it had to be a joke. Beside the fact the government contemplated violence against peaceful protesters, even thinking about using a “heat ray” – formally known as an Active Denial System – made the event seem straight out of science fiction. But this weapon, like the government’s inquiry, was real and is a jarring exemplar of over-policing at relatively peaceful protests around the country. Not only that, but it’s an indication of the racism prevalent in the response to demonstrations pushing for social justice. Protesters, many of whom were students and recent graduates, shouldn’t worry about facing pain or death at the hands of their own government at a demonstration. 
Hannah Thacker | Opinions Editor
The issue of over-policing isn’t unique to the District. Police across the country have overmilitarized their forces and brought in additional officers even though it was never necessary. In small towns and cities, routine police matters like drug arrests are often addressed with far more firepower than needed – literally. Protesters pushing for racial justice nationwide have faced down military-style tanks and weapons used allegedly to keep the peace. In the nation’s capital, protesters saw more than four different types of law enforcement, from the Metropolitan Police Department to the National Guard. Weapons developers originally designed the aforementioned heat ray for use on the battlefield in Iraq, but ethical concerns indefinitely delayed deployment. What message does it send that the president felt that the walk between the White House and St. John’s Church merited the use of a weapon deemed unethical for use against the country’s enemies?
The excessive force hundreds of thousands of Americans have encountered pose a serious threat not only to those peacefully protesting but to everyone who lives in cities across the United States who encounter the police in mundane contexts. The job of police is to protect and serve its residents, not to attack them and commit violent acts against them in the name of maintaining civility.  
And, as with every issue, race plays a role in who faces the brunt of police militarization. At a “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, hundreds of White supremacists took to the streets to chant incendiary slogans until the rally devolved into violence between those marching and those opposing them. During this whole event, the police did not step in until things got violent between the two groups. Initially, this rally was devoid of violence, and the police allowed it to continue as such. That’s a stark contrast to what has happened at Black Lives Matter protests across the country. There’s no question that the treatment of BLM protesters is far worse than that of White supremacist marchers. While those in Charlottesville chanted and marched, police never once saw them as a threat to the peace that they needed to forcibly remove them from the streets as they have done at recent BLM protests. 
Many students are politically active and were likely to be at various protests, not only in D.C., but in their home cities nationwide. The prospect of any student facing assault by police officers simply for protesting should scare everyone, no matter your political views. It should be common sense that the use of military-grade weapons against civilians, especially those fighting for Black lives, is tantamount to fascist and racist behavior. 
It doesn’t matter if you stand with the BLM movement or not – excessive police force should not be used on protesters. Heat rays and sound cannons should only exist in the pages of comic books and plots of movies, not opposite demonstrators at the White House.

A flurry of statements, bad press and protests have escalated calls for University President Thomas LeBlanc’s resignation. And this week brought a new form of protest: a pledge from the Student Association president asking people not to donate to GW until LeBlanc is replaced.
The pledge is part of SA President Howard Brookins’ executive order calling for LeBlanc to leave his post. It implores students, faculty and alumni to withhold donations from GW until LeBlanc is ousted and “shared governance is implemented” among staff, faculty and the student body. Hundreds of people and groups – including The Hatchet Editorial Board – have been asking for LeBlanc to step down for months now. This pledge could be an even more effective way of actualizing those demands because it hits GW where it hurts – its wallet.
We could begin to make some headway in much-needed changes at the University if every member of the GW community – students, faculty, staff and alumni – sign the pledge. We must sign on to ensure new leadership and a greater voice at the top.
“Students very often do not have a say in the happenings of the University, but signing this pledge can change that. Students, alumni, staff and faculty must take advantage of the SA’s protest and join the pledge.”
These criticisms are getting old, but let’s rehash the series of missteps throughout LeBlanc’s three-year tenure at GW. LeBlanc lost the trust of students and faculty through his hiring of a string of former colleagues at the University of Miami, a racially insensitive comment, plans to cut enrollment while increasing funding to STEM programs at the cost of the humanities and recent layoffs and disdain for student activism. There is near-unanimity among the GW community that he should step aside – but even in the face of opposition, LeBlanc has refused to even answer questions about whether or not he will step down. This pledge goes beyond just words, which is a necessary step given LeBlanc’s refusal to hear what students are saying.
This pledge could have substantive effects – taking a financial angle is a key tactic of effective protest. Lack of donations can negatively impact GW’s rankings in U.S. News and World Report and The Wall Street Journal, which are tentpoles of the University’s prestige and pitch to prospective students. During a financially stressful time amid a pandemic, the University also cannot afford to lose donations. The prospect of further financial woes is a nightmare for administrators and could feasibly force them to accede to student demands for new leadership.
While protests and statements signed by dozens of student organizations and faculty did not sway LeBlanc and the Board of Trustees into considering new leadership, the prospect of reducing GW’s appeal to potential students would be a jolt – and rightly so. A pledge is a commitment to action, not just words on a page or people holding signs. A pledge to not donate to the University until things change demonstrates commitment and impacts the University where it matters most – its wallet. It won’t be effective unless students, faculty, staff and alumni sign on.
Aside from placing financial pressure on the University, this pledge is also beneficial to the SA. Brookins, the organization’s president, is demonstrating his message to the entire University community – and that carries a lot of weight. Not only was Brookins voted into office to represent all students at the University, but he is the only student member on the Board. And he decided to strike while the iron is hot – the Board is set to convene next week and Brookins has an opportunity to express students’ and faculty’s frustration toward GW leadership.
Students very often do not have a say in the happenings of the University, but signing this pledge can change that. Students, alumni, staff and faculty must take advantage of the SA’s protest and join the pledge.

Head women's basketball coach Jennifer Rizzotti said female athletes are used to fighting against sexism and discrimination in their field, and the fight for social justice is no different. 
Head women’s basketball coach Jennifer Rizzotti and a former men’s basketball hall-of-famer discussed the intersection of sports and social justice at an Elliott School of International Affairs event Wednesday.
Rizzotti and former men’s basketball standout Pops Mensah-Bonsu talked about racism in sports and the ongoing push for social justice in the Atlantic 10. Lindsay Krasnoff, an international sports writer and expert on sports diplomacy, moderated the event.
Rizzotti said if she had received the invitation to participate in this talk six months ago, she wasn’t sure she would have accepted. She said she didn’t know enough about the Black Lives Matter movement and has worked hard in the past few months to expand her knowledge.
“We didn’t have these conversations when I played back in high school and in college,” Rizzotti said. “I thought, ‘Well, I’m a part of the women’s basketball community. We’re diverse and we’re accepting doesn’t matter what race, sexuality, we’re one of the most inclusive communities in the world.’ I never put the work into understanding.”
She added that she had talks with her team after the police killing of George Floyd, and several members of the squad involved themselves in Athletes Driving Change, an Atlantic 10-wide organization seeking to create equality through education and service.
“It’s important for me to be a role model for my student-athletes, for my family, for my kids at home, for people to understand that it’s our responsibility to continue our evolution, regardless of our background, regardless of our upbringing, to make sure that we’re educated to make a difference going forward,” Rizzotti said.
Women’s basketball and the WNBA has been at the forefront of the BLM movement as players took knees during anthems, wore social justice warm-up shirts and even took time away from the game to advocate for social equality.
Rizzotti said women have always needed to be on the defense against sexism or critics doubting their ability to play the game, and fighting for social justice was no different.
“They’re always having to play defense,” Rizzotti said. “And this summer, they played offense, and they set the message that they felt like needed to be set. And every one of them was on board, every single player – American, non-American, White, Black, moms, single women, straight women, gay women – they were all on the same page. And it was a beautiful thing to see.”
She added that the lack of sports as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic actually benefited the team’s push for social and racial equality. She said players and fans were not consumed in normal seasons and had more time and energy to dedicate to social justice.
“It was actually the absence of sports that made us pay attention to something that’s way more important,” Rizzotti said. “When those sports came back, every one of them – soccer, baseball, football, basketball – their focus was on the right things.”
Mensah-Bonsu, a 2006 graduate and former hall-of-fame forward for men’s basketball, said he had teammates from across the United States and world, like Ukraine. But he said the topics of racial equality or social justice weren’t discussed in a sports setting until he played on the British National Team.
He added that a crowd in the Czech Republic made racist gestures toward him while he was shooting free throws, which sparked a conversation between him and his teammates about the injustices Black people and other minority groups face.
“That was probably the one situation overseas where it really stood out to me and some of my teammates were like, ‘Man, how do you feel about that? How do you feel?’ and we had to explain to them that it’s just everyday life for us,” he said.
Mensah-Bonsu said Black athletes were previously afraid to speak out about racism in sports, but the recent movement for social causes has empowered more athletes to speak up against injustice.
Mensah-Bonsu, who operates a Sports for Education and Economic Development camp in Ghana, said he wants to use his experiences playing around the world to educate future basketball players about culture and their rights. He added that he wants to reduce “culture shock” when players from Africa come to play in the United States.
“Anything I’m going through, I really want to speak to that so that they don’t have to experience it too,” He said. “It was difficult coming up. Again, I wouldn’t change anything because it made me the man I am today. And it allows me to use that experience to help others to not have to go through that.”
He encouraged attendees to vote in national and local elections and use their platform to support social justice movements. He added that he will continue to use his platform to fight for a time when “we will not be judged by the color of our skin but by our work, ethics and morals.”
“I’m glad to be a part of it because it’s history,” Mensah-Bonsu said. “And you have to look yourself in the mirror and say, ‘Which side of history do I want to be on?’ I want to be on one side when my grandkids ask me in the future what did I do, I want to tell them this is how I championed this cause.”

Tanya Vogel, the head of the athletic department, said she mandated a six-week-long unconscious bias training for teams after talking with women’s basketball assistant coach Ganiyat Adeduntan.
The sports that members of the GW community knew before the COVID-19 pandemic are “gone,” Student-Athlete Advisory Council President Lauren Bennett said.
All spring and fall sports have been halted, and the athletic department needed to make cuts of its own – including slashes to seven teams, a pay reduction and scaled back travel budgets. As the pandemic dragged into the fall and social unrest swept the United States, athletic officials began to formulate a return plan for student-athletes and implement a slew of diversity and inclusion initiatives.
“We are having to move forward, and move forward better now, while trying to stay as safe as possible,” said Bennett, who rows for the women’s program.
Some student-athletes have returned to Foggy Bottom and abide by safety protocols, while others have stayed home to train solo or with a nearby club team. The men’s and women’s basketball programs are also gearing up for a delayed season start, which Athletic Director Tanya Vogel said will resemble a slow but steady return to practice and the possibility of playing in front of fans.
Department cuts staff, shrinks budgets
Vogel said she needed to lay off “some” employees and decrease operating and administrative budgets to account for financial loss brought on by the pandemic. The department’s proposed plan to expand the Smith Center and replace the pool with a practice basketball court has been paused along with the suspension of other capital projects.
Vogel took a pay reduction along with other top officials, but the rest of the athletic department did not face pay cuts, she said. She declined to say how much of a pay reduction she took.
Programs’ operating budgets were decreased “25 to 35 percent,” Vogel said. She said the department cut back on teams’ travel budgets and nixed the training table, which provided breakfast to athletes every morning.
The Atlantic 10 regionalized fall sports’ regular season and championship schedules amid the pandemic, and the modifications will remain when fall sports compete in the spring.
“We really approached it that way, knowing that travel makes up a large percentage of what we do,” Vogel said. “That was the area I felt like we could make the biggest impact.”
The department announced July 31 it would eliminate seven programs at the conclusion of the 2020-21 season. Vogel called that Friday a “horribly difficult day for GW athletics,” saying the department had been considering reductions “long before” she arrived at GW.
She added that a 27-program department outsized market basket schools, and the conversation about cutting the teams became “more active” in the last year and a half. Officials said in the summer that the pandemic sped up plans to slim down the department.
“A lot of analysis pointed to us being smaller, to look more like some of the schools that were winning championships across the board,” she said.
Vogel said the University weighed criteria like Division I and Atlantic 10 sponsorship, donation and engagement and how much investment a program would need to compete at a higher level.
In response to the cuts, Bennett said SAAC created Team FORWARD, a committee made up of SAAC members, Vogel and a representative from each of the seven eliminated programs. The committee will act as a space for student-athletes to air their thoughts and learn about mental health resources, options to transfer to another school and resources about converting to a club program, Bennett said.
Vogel, SAAC work toward racial equality
Vogel said conversations about racial equality spawned in March after the killing of Ahmaud Arbery and have prompted officials to create a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion task force and increase focus on diversity in recruiting practices.
She said the Smith Center will also receive updates to honor the Black Lives Matter movement, but the additions have not been revealed yet. Student-athletes are also forming the Black Student-Athlete Alliance, led by head women’s tennis coach Torrie Browning and Administrative Associate Shatara Stokes, to discuss improving inclusivity in the department, she said.
“My commitment to our staff and our students is that we’re going to continue to have conversations and work to make real actionable change,” Vogel said.
Vogel said the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion task force existed for about a year, but it was recently revamped to include events and a film series highlighting the push for racial equity.
Vogel added that she mandated a six-week-long diversity and unconscious bias training – an idea sparked by conversations with women’s basketball assistant coach Ganiyat Adeduntan.
“It was the right place to start,” Vogel said. “We’re also working with some guest speakers that can come in and talk with our coaches about things that are sports-specific areas of the country, i.e. schools, clubs, et cetera, to make sure that we’re casting the widest net.”
Bennett added that SAAC partnered with Athletes United for Social Justice, an offshoot of the Grassroots Project that aims to educate student-athletes and involve them in local social justice initiatives.
Department prepares for winter, spring seasons
Vogel said the department established committees to plan each team’s return to athletics and competition. The groups will help transition athletes and coaches back into practice and set up protocols for programs to follow, she said.
During the first weeks of the return to athletics plan, Vogel said student-athletes’ training hours are limited, and masks and social distancing are required. The plan will then progress to zero-contact training that includes small group workouts before student-athletes can partake in scrimmages or full team practices, Vogel said.
Bennett said she cannot take her mask off until her boat has been pushed off the dock and floated into the Potomac. She added that small practice bubbles are strictly maintained.
Vogel added that not all student-athletes are on campus, but the athletes in Foggy Bottom receive a weekly COVID-19 test and must complete daily health checks to participate in team activities.
She added that the upcoming basketball season, the first athletic events since March, will look differently as a result of the pandemic. With the basketball season set to start Nov. 25, Vogel said the Colonials may begin the season in an empty arena depending on the latest guidance from D.C. health officials.
She added that the Smith Center, which seats 5,000 people, has ample room to accommodate social distancing if D.C. allows fans to attend sporting events.
“Right now, the District does not allow fans,” Vogel said. “It is possible that we’ll play in the Smith Center without fans. Our hope is that we can continue to move in a direction where we can safely have people back inside Smith Center.”

The Colonials knocked off Hofstra, Monmouth, Florida, San Diego State and Valparaiso to win their first postseason title. 
In lieu of fall sports, we’re dusting off the history books and taking a look back on 10 of the best GW sports moments, ever. Here’s to hoping some old-fashioned nostalgia can keep us going until the restart.
No. 7: Men’s basketball nabs first NIT Championship
The 2015-16 men’s basketball team made its mark in GW’s history books when it claimed the 2016 National Invitation Tournament title.
Head coach Mike Lonergan led the team to its winningest season in program history, racking up a 28-10 record. The roster was chock full of talent, featuring redshirt junior forward Tyler Cavanaugh, senior forward Kevin Larsen and senior guard Patricio Garino. Cavanaugh nabbed the NIT MVP award during the tournament run.
The Colonials started the season with six straight victories in their nonconference schedule. GW received an early season boost when it knocked off No. 6 Virginia at the Smith Center 73–68 in the second game of the campaign. Cavanaugh and Garino both scored 18 points in the statement win.
A 61–56 loss to No. 24 Cincinnati did not deter GW. The team bounced back with three straight wins over Power Five schools, including eventual Big East champion Seton Hall. The victories elevated the Colonials to a No. 20 national ranking.
Despite going 11-2 in nonconference play, the Colonials would struggle against Atlantic 10 opposition. A 10-8 conference record earned GW the fifth seed in the A-10 Championship.
Sophomore guard Yuta Watanabe’s 19-point performance in the second round of the tournament lifted the Colonials over Saint Louis by eight points. In the quarterfinals the Colonials’ run ended as Saint Joseph’s eliminated GW 86–80, leaving the Colonials’ postseason fate in the hands of the selection committee.
GW did not receive an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament, but it did accept an at-large invitation to the NIT as a No. 4 seed, facing Hofstra in the first round.
The Pride put up a tough fight, eventually falling 82–80 to a bucket from graduate student guard Alex Mitola with less than three seconds on the clock. Cavanaugh powered the team with 20 points and 11 rebounds.
The second round went smoother for GW. The Colonials knocked off No. 1 seed Monmouth 87–71 behind Cavanaugh’s second straight 20-point plus double-double.
Power Five opposition awaited the Colonials in the quarterfinals. The No. 2 seeded Florida Gators came to the Smith Center for GW’s final home game of the season. The Gators were led by redshirt senior Dorian Finney-Smith, who now starts regularly for the Dallas Mavericks in the NBA.
At the end of a game that saw 19 lead changes, GW came out on top with an 82–77 victory. Finney-Smith had the chance to put Florida ahead with less than a minute on the clock, but he missed the open look from beyond the arc and Larsen snagged the rebound.
Just after a Colonials’ timeout, Cavanaugh drilled a triple of his own to put his team in the driver’s seat for the waning seconds of the game. He and Mitola combined to hit all five of their late free throws to seal the win. Cavanaugh notched 23 points, while Larsen controlled the paint with 13 rebounds.
Six days later at Madison Square Garden, defense was the name of the game in GW’s semifinal showdown with San Diego State. The Aztecs shot 13.6 percent from three-point land as the Colonials trampled them to a 65–46 win.
The Aztecs’ nationally top-rated defense couldn’t cool down Cavanaugh, who still led the charge with 20 points and 11 boards. The Colonials became the winningest team in program history and captured a postseason title in one fell swoop in their next meeting with Valparaiso.
Valparaiso’s success came from the standout duo of senior forward Vashil Fernandez and junior forward Alec Peters. Fernandez won the Lefty Driesell Award as the nation’s best defender after amassing 119 blocks, while Peters led the team in scoring with 18.4 points per game.
GW went into halftime with a slim 32–31 lead but came out swinging in the second period. The Colonials left Valparaiso in the dust, outscoring their opponents 44–29 in the final 20 minutes. Mitola cut down the nets to commemorate the program’s first postseason title.
Just months after the win, Lonergan was fired amid reports of abuse toward his players. Assistant coach Maurice Joseph slid into the head coaching role for the next three seasons before he was ousted.
Cavanaugh, Larsen and Garino currently play professionally in Europe, while Watanabe competes for the Memphis Grizzlies organization in the NBA and G League.

In one of my creative writing classes last week, our professor invited students to discuss former history professor Jessica Krug, who deceived her students and colleagues of her race for most of her life. When it was our turn to ask questions, another student and I explained Krug’s mistaken hiring was rooted in the lack of racial diversity in academia and in the GW history department. 
But these ideas were acknowledged and then quickly dismissed by the professor. Instead, he was far more interested in steering the discussion toward the “character-building” element of the Krug debacle. Assuming he was equating creating a fictional character to Krug creating varying types of Black and Caribbean personas, his comment conveniently glossed over the racial nuances of the Krug debacle. 
But this kind of White-washed environment is common inside GW classrooms. Students are often subject to the professors’ narrow understanding of subject matter, rather than having the opportunity to discuss a more diverse set of interpretations. Instead of focusing on a single aspect of a topic or text, professors need to consciously discuss the intersection between their respective subjects and their complexities like racist ideas, sexuality and gender identity.
This professor’s selective interpretation of Krug hiding her race is analogous to most classroom discussions. In most of my past English classes, we discussed the literary worth of Shakespeare’s plays, but never how his ambiguous sexuality might have affected his work. We discussed Emily Dickinson as a shining example of a talented female writer in a male-dominated field, but we barely discussed how her White privilege gave her the opportunity to sit down and write while women of color rarely had the chance to do so. 
The professor who coined the term “intersectionality,” Kimberlé Crenshaw, used the term to describe how race, class, gender and other characteristics overlap with one another. In an academic setting, acknowledging intersectionality would mean professors acknowledging different identities in their interpretation of the course material and encouraging their students to discuss these interpretations. This approach can be achieved across all disciplines.  
In practice, intersectional discourse on course material would give students a holistic understanding of the subject at hand. This approach can be applied to all subjects, not just English or creative writing. For instance, in one of my history courses last year, we were discussing Mohandas Gandhi’s understanding of “swaraj,” or home rule in India. A narrow discussion of his writing would focus on his understanding of culture and why he believed that Indians – South Asians – were fit to rule over their own subcontinent instead of the British. An intersectional approach would include a discussion of the elitism and sexism that influenced his writing. This way, students would receive a better understanding of what views Gandhi actually held when it came to his ideas about which Indians should govern. 
Had my creative writing professor welcomed a discussion on the racial aspects of the Krug scandal, we might have discussed what we can do in our classroom to add different voices to the currently monotonous voices of academia. Because we primarily read short stories written in the mid-twentieth century, we could have consciously created a space where we could seriously engage in the racial context that those stories were so heavily influenced by. 
Classroom discussions are often bound by the professor’s interpretation of the material. Because of the overall lack of diversity in academia for generations now, these interpretations are looking at the material in a very narrow way. An intersectional approach will illuminate different aspects of the professor’s interpretation of the topic or text at hand, and will enrich students’ understanding of the subject matter.

GW's revenue losses from COVID-19 are now estimated at $160 million a year, according to University President Thomas LeBlanc. 
Administrators have been grappling with the financial impact of the pandemic on the University for months. But now, officials say they have identified the cuts needed to close GW’s projected budget gap.
University President Thomas LeBlanc announced to employees late last week steps that will be taken as part of the second and final phase of financial mitigation, which will include reductions of non-recurring expenses and use of the University’s unrestricted assets. GW’s annual budget gap is currently projected to reach $160 million this year in addition to an estimated $45 million in lost revenues last fiscal year, which ended June 30.
“Barring a significant change in the pandemic and its impact, we believe that these final steps will conclude our budget mitigation for this fiscal year,” LeBlanc said in an email, which was obtained by The Hatchet, to employees Thursday.
Since the pandemic began affecting the University’s operations in March, officials have stressed that financial projections are subject to change until more information becomes available about enrollment and the ability to bring students back to campus. Total undergraduate enrollment fell sharply this year based on preliminary estimates, and administrators began meeting this month about spring operations.

March
Days after students started taking classes online following spring break, administrators began implementing the first phase of financial mitigation.
Officials announced on March 25 they would suspend most capital projects and hirings, the first public action taken to reduce expenses. Administrators had previously suspended non-essential international travel and urged employees to delay all domestic travel out of health concerns, which also led to savings.
April
In early April, LeBlanc provided the first known estimate of the pandemic’s financial impact on the University. Officials anticipated a $25 million loss from the original fiscal year 2020 budget, driven by a $45 million annual revenue shortfall.
The projection did not account for the impact of the pandemic on the University’s medical enterprise. The GW Hospital temporarily suspended elective surgeries to allocate more resources toward COVID-19 patients.
On April 27, officials announced they would freeze all employee salaries and top administrators, including LeBlanc, would take a pay cut.
At the time, LeBlanc said administrators were not planning any “immediate” layoffs and would only do so if “necessary.”
The Faculty Senate subsequently requested layoffs be used only as a “last resort.” Board of Trustees Chair Grace Speights and LeBlanc said they wouldn’t commit to implementing layoffs only as a last resort, adding that it would only effect administrative support rather than faculty.
May
As the pandemic’s impact persisted, GW’s financial outlook continued to worsen.
On May 8, administrators announced a projected annual revenue shortfall of between $100 million and $300 million for fiscal year 2021, which runs July 1, 2020, through June 30, 2021, depending on when students return to campus. The Board delayed the passage of the fiscal year 2021 budget from its May meeting given the financial uncertainty of the pandemic’s impact.
Officials said during fiscal year 2020, which ended June 30, they projected the $45 million revenue shortfall would yield a net loss of $13 million after running out the University’s budgeted surplus and implementing various mitigation steps.
As officials discussed more drastic measures to close the budget gap, they vowed not to use GW’s endowment, arguing it would jeopardize the long-term financial stability of the University.
“Tapping the endowment or reserves today would not be a prudent decision or in the best interest of GW because it will only hamper our financial standing in the future,” Speights, the Board chair, said at the May senate meeting. “We cannot sacrifice our long-term future to resolve the challenges posed by this pandemic.”
The decision quickly led to criticism from some faculty who said using endowment funds could prevent potential layoffs and other cuts.
June
At the summer’s start, administrators said layoffs were no longer just a possibility – they were inevitable.
On June 4, LeBlanc wrote in an email to Andrew Zimmerman, the then-president of the Faculty Association, saying that officials would be unable to avoid layoffs for “any longer” – marking LeBlanc’s first known confirmation of impending layoffs.
As administrators prepared for layoffs, they continued planning for an in-person fall semester. Officials submitted a plan to the District on June 15 for students to return to campus in August with an extensive testing and social distancing plan.
July
But uncertainty remained as cases began rising throughout the United States during the summer. The new fiscal year began without an annual budget, and the Board instead granted officials temporary financial authority until the financial situation became clearer.
On July 27, administrators announced classes would remain online for the entire fall semester with a 10 percent tuition discount for Foggy Bottom undergraduates, leading to tens of millions of dollars in lost housing revenue and an expected annual revenue shortfall of $220 million.
August
As the end of the summer neared, officials laid off hundreds of staff in administrative units, including the Center for Career Services, technology offices, event departments and academic advising. LeBlanc said at the September senate meeting that officials had laid off about 250 staff members with more expected in the coming days.
Multiple faculty senators met with trustees to discuss officials’ financial mitigation strategy and requested the Board use endowment funds to help close the gap, according to a senate executive committee report. Speights, the Board chair, did not return a request for comment about the meeting through a spokesperson.
Hundreds have called on LeBlanc to resign, citing the layoffs as part of their rationale.
September
As fall enrollment levels became clearer, GW’s projected losses became more optimistic.
LeBlanc said earlier this month that total undergraduate enrollment fell about 7.2 percent this year based on the latest known estimates, significantly better than May expectations, reflecting a $180 million revenue shortfall.
LeBlanc said the “first phase” of GW’s mitigation efforts, which included all budget actions taken through September, reduced expenses by about $100 million, leaving tens of millions of dollars of the budget gap unaddressed. Officials have declined to say how much money was saved by each individual action taken, including staff layoffs.
But LeBlanc said Thursday that updated projections reduced the estimated annual revenue shortfall even further, now estimated at $160 million. The second phase of cuts, which include suspending the University’s base and matching retirement contributions, reducing non-recurring expenses and using up to $20 million of the University’s unrestricted assets is expected to close the remaining gap.
“I anticipate things could get better,” LeBlanc said at a senate meeting earlier this month. “We built in fairly conservative projections, so I don’t see it getting much worse than this.”
