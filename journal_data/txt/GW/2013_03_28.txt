All upperclassmen applicants for campus housing nabbed a spot in residence halls next fall, the first time in nearly a decade that juniors and seniors stayed off the waitlist.
The University must still place about 120 rising sophomores – who are required to live on campus – into rooms. That figure is about the same as past years, and all will receive housing assignments by the summer, Director of GW Housing Programs Seth Weinshel said.
Weinshel said he thought fewer upperclassmen signed up for housing anticipating a housing crunch because GW will close two sophomore residence halls this summer to prepare for the “superdorm.” Last year, about 350 students opted for the waitlist – all of whom were given housing by the end of May, Weinshel said. In 2011, the waitlist included 700 students.
Sophomores will be shuffled into Philip Amsterdam Hall, which previously housed mostly juniors, and quads in several sophomore buildings that were previously triples after the University shutters Crawford, The Schenley and The West End.
With fewer upperclassmen living on campus, two nearby apartment buildings, The Statesman and The President Condominium, reported an increase in student applicants this year. An employee of the Letterman House Condominiums, which houses about 65 percent students each year, said it has not yet seen an increase, but said most student applications stream in closer to the summer.
The University also saw twice as many students request fall-only housing, tallying 280 applications this year. This is the first year that GW allowed students to leave their housing in the spring – the more popular season for study abroad.
Weinshel said last-minute study abroad decisions are among the most common reasons students cancel housing assignments.
But Weinshel said he does not expect many students to ditch housing assignments. Last year, the office implemented a steep $700 fine for students who dropped their assignments a month or more after the deadline to deter them from seeing campus housing as a fallback.
“We still anticipate a high occupancy rate like we have in previous years,” Weinshel said. “When students want housing, we’ll continue to provide them housing.”
He said that because he does not expect many students to take their names off the list, he doesn’t think rooms around campus will go empty next fall.
“The fact that there are fewer people on the waitlist will not negatively impact us. The fees, regardless of where the funding goes, are meant to be a deterrent,” he said.
Weinshel said he did not think housing prices, which went up about 3 percent this year, similar to past years’ increases, were a factor in students’ decisions because it they are less than the housing market’s yearly inflation.

After more than a year of planning, administrators will consider next month whether to go through with a much-hyped global program that would split undergraduates’ four years across three continents.
The Columbian College of Arts and Sciences program, which would take students from D.C. to China and France, could elevate the University’s international reputation.
The University’s president and provost will weigh factors such as revenue projections, financial aid, housing and student interest in mid-April before moving forward – a flagship goal for dean Peg Barratt in her final year.
The program would launch in fall 2014. Some competitor schools have beaten GW in terms of international expansion by adding campuses across the continents.
Barratt, who will step down in June, said earlier this year that GW would recruit an initial cohort of up to 50 economics and political science majors for the Class of 2018 for the degree program. She has spent more than a year traveling, negotiating and planning the initiative.
The program’s future may be shaky because it puts GW close to the District-imposed student enrollment cap, Columbian College Associate Dean for Undergraduate Studies Dan Ullman said Tuesday.
“It’s one of the things [to work around],” Ullman said. “We’re not launching anything we don’t think is going to work. We’re going to blend them into the campus, but we’ve got to do some planning for the caps.”
Students would spend two years in D.C., and then spend two years at Sciences Po in France and Renmin University in China, respectively.
Barratt has tried to lift the program over hurdles, traveling to China in November and December. But questions remain, she said in an interview last month.
“Part of it is financial,” Barratt said. “Can we make a go of it? Will it be the experience we want students to have? Can we figure out how to deal with the cap of not bringing more students into Foggy Bottom?”
One school has already executed how to launch a complicated, cross-continental program. University of Southern California, a peer school, will launch a business program next fall that will take students to Los Angeles, Hong Kong and Milan. Another peer school, New York University, has propped up campuses and programs in the United Arab Emirates and China.
And officials at GW are feeling the pressure to globalize. GW planned to double its number of foreign undergraduate students over the next decade in its near-final strategic plan this year.
“These programs are becoming commonplace at other universities so this is just GWU keeping up with the competition (which is what we should be doing) rather than a high-risk innovation,” economics professor Anthony Yezer said in an email.
But universities still face heavy challenges to set up these programs, said John Douglass, a senior research fellow at University of California at Berkeley’s Center for Studies in Higher Education.
He said administrators should make sure the program’s rewards match the work put into it, especially if it enrolls few students. He added that several international programs have lagged because of unsustainable funding models.
“There’s a lot of institutional energy and finances put into these efforts,” like coordinating faculty assignments, student marketing and building relationships internationally, he said. “There are some real positives to these kinds of programs, but they’re logistically significant and it’s not clear what the funding model is and their longevity.”
The University has adjusted the program over the past year and a half. Initially, the GW School of Business was going to launch it for its majors by fall 2013, but the Columbian College took the planning reins this fall and pitched it for economics majors, adding a political science component to broaden its appeal.
GW will look to hire a handful of French and Chinese professors to teach abroad and ask some current faculty to spend time in those countries, economics department chair Barry Chiswick said.
“The emphasis will be on meeting GW’s standards so that the courses will be of the same high quality as the courses in Foggy Bottom,” Chiswick said.
Students will learn in Foggy Bottom, though administrators initially considered housing them off campus or in Arlington, Va. classrooms.
“We came to realize that students would feel cheated in such a program and they would miss out on something GW students look forward to,” Ullman said.
In 2011, when GW launched a Master of Science in finance program that takes business students to China one year and D.C. the next, it opted to put the Chinese graduate students in Virginia-based classrooms.

If you were to look at the Supreme Court from a distance, you might not notice it’s under construction. But if you get close enough, you’ll see that the scaffolding covering the exterior of the building is masked by a mere picture of the real thing.
The physical changes the court is undergoing are fitting, though, given the social and cultural upheavals present on the court’s steps when I was there Tuesday morning.
It was loud outside as masses on both sides of the marriage equality debate protested outside the courtroom, while inside, lawyers and justices heard oral arguments on Hollingsworth v. Perry.
The case, which concerns the same-sex marriage ban in California, Proposition 8, could have sweeping effects. In fact, the national media has branded this court case – as well as the arguments on Wednesday over the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act – as the be-all-end-all of the American LGBT rights movement.
These cases are tremendously important in the scope of LGBT rights. But the decision the nine justices hand down in June may not create the sea change activists are hoping for.
Millions of people across the country struggle with – and sometimes actively oppose – marriage equality and gay rights in general. But regardless of the court’s ruling, people’s minds can’t be changed overnight.
The court cases have drawn media attention on a national scale. But true change happens most effectively when it’s on the local level through a strong grassroots effort. Legal changes are essential, but so are the cultural ones that take years to solidify.
And even though it will take time, that reality shouldn’t discourage us. It should inspire activists to work even harder.
Let me be clear: Marriage equality is an essential issue. LGBT rights are the civil rights of the modern era, and were the Supreme Court to uphold flawed measures like Prop 8 and DOMA, it would hold back progress and perpetuate oppression.
And yet, the justices expressed skepticism Tuesday about their future ruling on Prop 8.
“If the issue is letting the states experiment and letting the society have more time to figure out its direction, why is taking a case now the answer?” Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked.
And Justice Anthony Kennedy, who some say will be the deciding vote, questioned whether or not the court should have taken the case in the first place.
It’s frustrating to hear that even liberal-leaning justices might be reluctant to rule on Prop 8. But perhaps their hesitation is an important wake-up call for the LGBT-rights movement.
Slowly but surely, across the nation, people are understanding the value in expanding marriage rights. In November’s election alone, three states joined the growing list – which now includes nine states and the District – to legalize same-sex marriage.
And in the past two weeks, prominent Democrats like former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., announced support for the movement. Even other politicians, like Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, have come out in favor of equal marriage rights under the law, locking in their footing on the right side of history.
But the issue of LGBT rights is still emotionally charged. At the rally, representatives from the National Organization for Marriage and the infamous Westboro Baptist Church walked through the street shouting “one man, one woman,” and holding red, eerily Medieval-looking tapestries bearing the words “tradition, family, property.”
Clearly, there are millions of people across the nation that still need to be convinced. And maybe some never will. But even though striking down old legislation can only help the cause, it’s not the only step that should be taken.
Controversy surrounding the marriage equality debate still looms large.
In the same way that the Supreme Court building’s facade can try to hide the construction underneath, rulings in favor of marriage equality will merely give the impression that the underlying issue has been completely resolved.

A lot of elements made this year’s Student Association election notable.
With 4,855 ballots cast, the election saw a record student voter turnout. Julia Susuni will be the fourth-ever female SA president in its nearly 40-year history. The two highest student lobbyists each won the race by a wide margin. And who could forget the satirical SA presidential bid by textile museum-loving monarchist “King” Hugo Scheckter?
But despite these factors, nothing is more pivotal about these past few weeks than the fact that the elected second-in-command placed sexual assault awareness as his capstone platform point.
In 2011, there were 16 reported sexual assaults on GW’s campus, up from 11 in 2010, according to Department of Education statistics. And that number is flawed: the vast majority of sexual assaults go unreported. Studies have found that nearly 20 percent of women who attend a college or university are victims of sexual assault.
Executive Vice President-elect Kostas Skordalos focused his candidacy on broadening sexual assault awareness and improving the University’s sexual assault policies. And considering Skordalos’s experience lobbying on behalf of victims of sexual assault throughout his GW career – he is co-president of the student organization Men of Strength – he clearly possesses the passion and credentials to follow through with his goals.
It is refreshing – and frankly, long overdue – to see this campus issue top a candidate’s platform.
But this past SA election shouldn’t be the only time we focus on sexual assault awareness.
Let 2013 be the first year of many to make sexual assault awareness a priority. Let this campaign serve as a message to the University that this issue requires student input. And let 2014 be the year candidates for both SA president and EVP to stop comparing student space plans and instead speak to how they will focus on heightening sexual assault awareness.
As visible leaders on campus, SA officials would be able to lobby and speak on behalf of the entire student body with regards to sexual assault issues. It would send a powerful message to the community if the chief student lobbyists made this their focus.
The University has been in the process of updating its sexual assault policy since it released an initial plan in the fall, which was troubling for a range of reasons. To start, the plan added a 180-day time window for students to file to take disciplinary action against their attackers. While the University is now working to extend the statute of limitations to one and a half years, Skordalos said he hopes to further extend this statute of limitations.
The University already offers quite a few resources for victims of sexual assault, including counseling and medical attention. However, simply raising awareness about those resources just isn’t enough. SA leaders should foster a community where victims feel comfortable reporting attacks and getting the help they need to heal.
The executive pair could also use SA finances and backing to create events that call attention to sexual assault on campus. Sexual assault awareness and justice groups should not be the only ones to give this cause visibility; it is a campus-wide issue that deserves more attention than it currently receives.
And given the SA’s resources and connections to administrators, it could likely accomplish more than any single student organization could handle on its own. We must expect leaders to constantly question our conventional wisdom about safety and sexual assault. Advocacy for this cause is not a one-time or short-lived act. If SA leaders are really ambitious, they should lobby the GW Hospital to finally get much-needed rape kits, which are only available in D.C. at the Washington Hospital Center.
Skordalos stressed that he wants to widen student understanding of the issue. This is admirable, and this is crucial. But this is a task that requires years of focus and effort from SA leaders.
And as for the student space plans that might get scrapped in place of this cause? Well, I think Skordalos answered it best during his endorsement hearing with The Hatchet’s editorial board.
“If it’s affecting one person in this community, it’s affecting the entire community,” he said. “And if a goal of ours is building community, as I believe it is for GW – strengthening our community – we have to make sure people feel safe here.”
And that thought should rake in votes every year.

Everyone knows about the $275 million Science and Engineering Hall project. The massive hole at 22 and H streets is nearly impossible to miss.
But there’s a less obvious perk that engineering students already enjoy: functional academic advising.
The School of Engineering and Applied Science assigns academic advisers to students based on their declared or anticipated majors. The University should provide students in the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences from day one with an adviser who is knowledgeable of the student’s specific area of interest and also aware of the departments’ academic requirements.
Academic advising is a perennial issue at GW, one administrators have repeatedly attempted to tackle by throwing money and resources at the problem. In the past few years, GW has established an online audit system to help students track their graduation requirements. And now, the University is considering cross-training academic advisers so that faculty can know more about departments and schools outside their expertise.
Yet CCAS – which houses a diverse group of majors and the largest percentage of the University’s students – assigns freshmen advisers according to last names.
While this may be the simplest way to pair students and advisers, it is not the most effective. Students would benefit from a system where each freshman is matched with an adviser who specializes in an area the student finds interesting, as is the case with engineering students.
Columbian College advisers are frequently criticized for being unaware of the major and minor requirements within different programs. Under the current system, a freshman’s adviser is often someone from a field completely unrelated to his or her academic interests.
It’s easy for anyone to get lost freshman year. But the problem is compounded by the fact that many freshmen often feel as though they don’t have an adviser who can give substantive suggestions tailored to their academic interests.
Since students would not arrive at GW enrolled in a specific school under a new admissions model described in the University’s 10-year strategic plan, it would be necessary for each student to have someone who could tailor academic advice to their interests.
This isn’t a problem in all of GW’s colleges. The GW School of Business, for example, has a limited number of majors, so the advisers can provide accurate and functional advice.
Without an adviser who is knowledgeable about students’ academic interests, it is impossible to guide freshmen effectively.

Near collapse. Stuck inside his run-down home in Washington state, Jason felt the walls closing in as his father’s heroin addiction threatened to ruin both of their lives.
As a senior in high school, he moved into his best friend’s spare room at college. Five years later, that friend, GW graduate student Kellen Russoniello, began drafting a progressive drug policy to reduce fatal overdoses in D.C. The legislation went into effect last week.
Russoniello said the time he spent at his childhood friend Jason’s home – watching his father laying on the couch in crippling withdrawal – shaped the policy. He remembered when the father, Francis, pawned Jason’s guitar and video games, chasing his next fix.
“I basically watched him destroy himself and almost take my best friend with him,” Russoniello, a law and public health student, said. “[Jason] needed to get out – he needed to have a different starting point.”
Under the new law, D.C. residents can dial 911 to prevent a potentially fatal overdose without the fear of prosecution for simple drug possession, possession of drug paraphernalia or underage drinking. D.C. joins a list of 10 states with similar good samaritan laws.
Seventy-nine people died from accidental drug overdoses in 2010, accounting for 26 percent of all accidental deaths in the District, according to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. It is D.C.’s second-leading cause of accidental death.
Student drug users who dial 911 will also receive immunity from arrest by Metropolitan Police Department officers, but could still face disciplinary sanctions – including suspension or expulsion – at the University.
Disciplinary offices will take a student’s emergency call into account when deciding whether to pursue disciplinary action, University spokeswoman Jill Sankey said. GW will review the newly enacted D.C. legislation to determine if it will change University policies, Sankey said.
Russoniello, who serves on the Board of Directors of Students for Sensible Drug Policy, said his team has only won half the battle by getting the law. They are gearing up, alongside a coalition of national and local groups, for a massive campaign to promote the law.
“It’s great that the legislation passed, but it’s not going to do much unless people know about it,” Russoniello said.
Russoniello, who hopes to partner with city organizations, clinics and the D.C. Department of Health, plans to organize informational sessions and distribute wallet cards laying out residents’ rights under the law.
He said he has earned $4,500 in grants from the GW Public Service Grant Commission, a student-run fund that supports service projects. More than $2,000 went toward advertising, and Monday, the commission awarded him another $2,400 for the education campaign.
Breana Uhrig, a recent public health graduate, teamed up with Russoniello in 2011, after they met at a rally marking the 40th anniversary of the “War on Drugs.” Uhrig, now a research associate in the School of Public Health and Health Services, discovered that she and Russoniello shared a passion for drug policy reform while they were collaborating on crack cocaine sentencing reform.
“I see drug use as an addiction – as a medical issue,” she said. “I don’t think we should send folks to jail for this issue, and if folks are fearing arrest in calling – I wanted to erase that.”
The pair met with D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson, who quickly threw his support behind them, in 2012.
The D.C. Council ultimately struck many provisions from Russoniello’s draft – including protection from arrest for outstanding warrants and eviction from public housing – but he and his coalition fought to create the nation’s first drug policy to require an educational public awareness component.
It also protects individuals under 25 years old who seek medical attention for young people older than 16 who could be overly intoxicated. The age limit was created to  ensure parents are vigilant in preventing parties involving alcohol.
Uhrig and six students in associate professor Caroline Sparks’ health advocacy class researched substance abuse and drug overdose statistics for a policy brief that introduced the bill to the council.
Now graduates, the former classmates have maintained ties with groups that helped lobby for the legislation, such as the Drug Policy Alliance, Helping Individual Prostitutes Survive and Bread for the City, and have secured their support for the educational campaign.
GW students also tapped Grant Smith, a policy manager for the Drug Policy Alliance, in August 2011 to support their efforts. Smith testified in favor of the bill before the D.C. Council’s judiciary committee less than a year later alongside Russoniello, Uhrig and another public health student Sheila Moen.
“It means that residents of the District of Columbia will – once they are notified that the law has protections – they will know their own lives and the lives of their families and friends mean more than the desire to arrest people for drug use,” Smith said.
The law also requires the D.C. mayor’s office to compile and analyze data on drug overdoses, emergency calls and police arrests at the scene of overdoses. Uhrig said the provision will help measure the law’s impact and boost outreach.
A 2011 University of Washington study reported that 88 percent of opiate users aware of the good samaritan law in that state were likely to call for help.
More students have called the University Police Department or EMeRG since GW became one of more than 90 universities nationwide to develop a good samaritan policy, offering disciplinary amnesty to students who seek help for over-intoxicated friends even if they are underage and have been drinking. Over the last three years, the number of student calls rose to 33 percent, from 22 percent, of EMeRG’s alcohol-related transports.
The University policy shift away from sanctions and toward education came after sophomore Laura Treanor died from alcohol poisoning in 2009.
The education coalition will target universities in the District, but Russoniello said the group’s primary focus is on city wards that report disproportionately more overdoses.
“I can give someone a copy of this and say, ‘This law has passed, these are your rights and don’t fear calling – you can save a life,’ ” Uhrig said.

Since 2010, the @fakeStevenknapp Twitter account has skewered and satirized administrators and students. But last week, 2010 alumnus Hunter Patterson announced that he would retire the account. We’ll miss the candid, snarky quips and jabs. It’s no exaggeration when we say we felt closer to him than the real University President Steven Knapp. RIP @fakeStevenknapp. You will be missed.
The men’s basketball season ended with a narrow loss to the University of Massachusetts at Brooklyn’s Barclay’s Center for the Atlantic 10 tournament. And while the post-season ended just as it started, GW has a lot to look forward to next season, with young Colonial talent and local rival George Mason’s addition to the A-10. Here’s to many exciting games and match-ups next season. #RaiseHigh
GW might be known as a politically active school, but when it comes to Student Association elections, turnout has historically been abysmal. This year, a record 4,855 ballots were cast.  While that number still only accounts for a small fraction of the student body, the higher participation rate is encouraging and hopefully an indication of future student involvement in campus politics. With this reassuring momentum, The Hatchet’s editorial board looks forward to seeing what President-elect Julia Susuni and Executive Vice President-elect Kostas Skordalos accomplish over the course of the next year.
It’s a running campus joke to refer to Gelman Library as “GelHell.” But that joke took on new meaning this month when consultants sounded alarms that Gelman resources are subpar for a research library. Despite the fact that the library is undergoing major renovations, including a new entrance from Kogan Plaza, and additions to the first and second floors, the library is in desperate need of more funding for collections and staffing. As the University completes a review of the library this year, administrators must make Gelman a priority.
More than 81 percent of faculty surveyed by Hatchet reporters this month said they did not know about the University’s CARE network, a program that allows individuals to anonymously report the names of students who appear to be struggling emotionally, financially, academically or personally. The network is intended to be a resource to identify students who could be falling through the cracks, and it is alarming that few faculty are comfortable using it. GW should actively inform professors about the network, as they are the primary link to students.
