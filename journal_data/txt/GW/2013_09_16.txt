If you miss out on a bid from your top chapter during recruitment, the Interfraternity Council wants you to know it won’t be too late to still join Greek life. 
For the first time this fall, chapters are being explicitly encouraged to bring on new members after formal recruitment ends Sept. 27, a year after the IFC adopted a year-round open recruitment policy. Chapters will set up around campus after handing out bids to try and follow up with students who came up empty-handed during the official rush period.
Jack Leech, the IFC’s vice president of recruitment, said he hopes it will keep students interested in Greek life even if they rush unsuccessfully.
“The last thing we want is for someone to get uninvited from one chapter and just be dismissive toward Greek life in general when they actually have this other option they could’ve explored,” he said.
Those additional members can join chapters’ fall pledge classes if recruited in the first days and weeks after the formal rush period ends.
The move is likely to grow a Greek life population that has already exploded in size in recent years. About a third of GW students are in fraternities or sororities this year, up from about 24 percent four years ago. The number of students in Greek life has nearly tripled in the last decade.
Open recruitment has been successful at other universities that are also members of the North-American Interfraternity Council, Leech said, adding that the new format will level the playing field for smaller fraternities by giving them more time to draw in members.
Sigma Nu, one of GW’s smallest fraternities with about 20 members, has already jumped on the chance to recruit year-round.
David Pepin, president of Sigma Nu, recruited three of its 11 new members outside of the formal rush period.
“[The chapter] sets up personal meetings with potential new members, we get to know them, and consider offering an invitation for membership,” Pepin said in an email. “Hopefully the new focus on year-round recruitment will allow us to be even more successful.
Beta Theta Pi chapter president Colin O’Brien said that unless his chapter offers a bid in the first few weeks after formal recruitment, newly recruited members will wait to join the next pledge class. And while his chapter hasn’t recruited any new members outside of the spring and fall rush cycles, the year-round recruitment policy will help new students get to know chapters on a deeper level, he said.
“Rush happens too quickly and too superficially for brothers to get a real sense of whether or not they feel the rush is a good fit or not sometimes,” O’Brien said in an email. “365[-day recruitment] slows that process down.”
O’Brien said putting in place open recruitment is a “difficult and tedious change” because the formal rush cycles are “very ingrained” in Greek life, but added that his members are open to the year-round policy.
IFC president Casey Wood said the open process will keep potential members from falling through the cracks.
“There’s always a story about a guy who’s just really upset because he got excluded from Greek life because he really wanted one fraternity and ended up getting cut. And that’s so silly,”  Wood said. “We’re just trying to refine the process so that we keep as many guys as possible within the rush process, instead of completely losing them from Greek life.”
One way to minimize the losses, Wood said, is an online system to keep track of all male students who express interest in joining Greek life. The system will give the IFC a roster of potential members and email addresses to stay in touch with them and keep track of who goes to recruitment events.
Freshman Michael DeMinico said he has been asked to sign in to the online system at each recruitment event he has attended and that he is encouraged that fraternities are keeping track of students interested in Greek life.
But while Wood likened the open recruitment to drafting a free agent, DeMinico said he was concerned that students would see joining Greek life during late recruitment as a consolation prize.
“It’s like [the chapters are] picking leftovers,” he said. “How is that going to make you feel about yourself?”

As a freshman, Chelsea Lenhart found comfort in GW’s lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community at large. There was gender-neutral housing, a resource center for LGBT students and an open-minded campus.
But something was missing: She saw a shortage of prospering student groups specifically for LGBT women.
Now a senior and president of the Association of Queer Women and Allies, Lenhart is looking to build a closer community of queer women, or women who identify as LGBT, on a campus known for its sizable population of gay males.
“It is a great thing to be part of a LGBTQ organization as a whole. But it’s also nice to have your own little group,” Lenhart explained. “It’s almost like if you’re in band, but all the piccolos hang out. We are still part of the overall community, but it’s just nice to talk to people who know exactly what you are going through.”
Allied in Pride, GW’s largest LGBT advocacy group with about 1,000 students on its email listserv, provides similar resources and a familial atmosphere to students. Its 12-person executive board, however, is almost entirely male, with two females in the organization’s highest positions.
AQWA, which had about 30 students attend its first meeting this month, hopes to collaborate more with Allied in Pride this year to create a “unified force” for LGBT students.
“We are still going to be two distinct organizations, but we are going to do a lot more things together so there isn’t this idea that doesn’t permeate through that only gay guys exist or only lesbian women exist. They exist as a whole,” Lenhart said.
Nicholas Gumas, Allied in Pride’s president, reinforced the interest to work together, saying that one of the group’s goals this year is to have more events specifically for queer women and to establish an integrated LGBT front on campus.
“I think this year, with [AQWA’s] new membership, they are looking to expand and partner with us, and I’m really excited to work with them,” Gumas said.
AQWA was not recognized as a formal student organization when Lenhart with a sophomore due to low membership, but existed informally among students.
Making up for its one-year hiatus, AQWA aims to create a bigger presence on campus. Vice-president Emily Schirvar said the group has received an influx of junior and senior students interested in joining.
AQWA organizes events on and off campus, such as mixers with local universities or trips to Sparkle – a queer open-mic night at Busboys and Poets – and movie screenings run by other LGBT organizations in the D.C. area.
“Every single person goes through their own process of self-discovery, coming out, or even staying in, and it was nice for me to have this connection right away,” Lenhart said. “I want to make sure that I can give that to other people.”
A sophomore and second-year member, Caitlyn Collett is looking forward to the new programming. She is also looking forward to the group’s growth.
“I would like it to be as well known on campus as Allied in Pride is, to see our partnership with them be successful and to remain in the positive public eye, while also being a continued supportive community,” Collett said.

Women's volleyball head coach Amanda Ault has had less depth to put on the court for the Colonials this season because of injuries. As a result, GW has started 4-6.
For weeks, women’s volleyball head coach Amanda Ault has theorized that her team’s deep roster would make up for its lack of a consistent starting lineup.
But with recent injuries to some of the team’s key veterans, that strategy has come up short during the Colonials’ lackluster 4-6 start.
“We haven’t really found our lineup yet and we’re kind of still working through that,” Ault said.
When the women’s volleyball team played its first match on Aug. 30, Ault’s starting seven consisted of Jordan Timmer at setter, Kelsey Newman, Rachael Goss and Maggie Skjelbred as outside hitters, Chidima Osuchukwu and Jamie Armstrong as middle blockers and Maddy Doyle at the libero position.
The Colonials would lose the match in three sets to Maryland.
Fast-forward to Sept. 13, seven games into the season. Three of Ault’s opening day starters turned over, with Emily Clemens as her setter, Loren Williams as outside hitter, and Gabrial Rushton as middle blocker.
The Colonials would lose that match to North Carolina in three straight sets, as well.
Without a dependable seven-player rotation, the Colonials haven’t shown the kind of consistent production Ault has looked for. Case in point: GW has not been able to string together a winning string, with every victory followed by a loss – and most losses coming in straight sets.
“There are some games that got away from us that we played extremely well in,” said Ault. “I think that games like [Saturday night versus JMU] are disappointing because it’s definitely a match that we should have taken.”
Struggling to find a balance between on-court experience and chemistry, Ault has seen the team surrender points to opponents because of young mistakes, or as Ault calls them, “growing pains.”
“We talked about volleyball not being a game that’s perfect, there’s going to be errors, there’s going to be mistakes made that you just have to brush aside,” said Ault, who added that she wants confident players on the floor who aren’t easily rattled.
With just two weeks before the team heads into Atlantic-10 Conference play, Ault must now decide how to best use her young roster, while knowing that she will be without two of the team’s veterans and past statistical leaders, at least for the time being.
On opening night against Maryland, senior middle blocker and team leader Armstrong sustained a concussion that has sidelined her for the majority of this early season. For the past two seasons, Armstrong led the Colonials in service aces, blocks, and attack percentage. So far this year, though, Armstrong has appeared in only 12 sets for the Colonials, with Ault cautious to put her back in the rotation.
Newman, the outside hitter in the team’s original starting lineup, has also played sparingly. After sustaining an injury to her back, Newman has been backed away from the pin, as the coaching staff attempts to manage the injury and give her rest. Ault sat Newman for most of last Wednesday’s match against Georgetown and used her little as a passer in last weekend’s Carolina tournament. Before being sidelined, Newman led the Colonials’ attacking front in kills and kills per set.
With those injury setbacks in mind, a record that sits just under .500 may not be cause for outcry. Ault is no stranger to injuries affecting her roster, as each of her last two years have been plagued by injured players, so she knows how to make the best with what she has.
Senior outside hitter Rachael Goss has emerged as the attacking force in Newman’s absence, now leading the Colonials with 86 kills and ranking second in digs, with 77.
Another key for the Colonials will be the progression of freshman Osuchukwu, who was recently named Atlantic 10 Rookie of the Week. She leads the A-10 with a .353 attack percentage (minimum 3.0 attempts/set) and leads the team in solo blocks (15), block assists (25), and total blocks (40).
Lastly, GW will look to Doyle, who has clearly been one of the Colonials’ most consistent players this season, for leadership. Doyle ranks first in the A-10 with 5.11 digs per set. On the season Doyle leads the Colonials with 189 digs, making her second in the conference.
Doyle will need to carry her strong defensive play into conference play if the Colonials want to contend against conference powerhouses like VCU and Dayton.
“Volleyball is very much a game of momentum, and as long as we can grab it and keep the momentum as high as possible, that’s what we need to do,” Ault said.
The Colonials head to DeKalb, Ill. this weekend for the NIU Invitational.

The University reversed course on a key part of its sexual assault policy this week, lifting its time limit for victims to file formal complaints.
Victims previously had two years to report sexual assaults to GW, a time frame that was established in the spring because officials said the crime is nearly impossible to prosecute after months or years have passed.
The latest policy, which was amended Monday, says a victim should file a complaint “as soon as possible after the alleged harassment occurs.” It does not list a precise time limit.
“The University recognizes that victims of sexual harassment may not always file complaints immediately, but notes that its ability to perform an administrative review may be limited by the passage of time,” the policy reads.
The change comes after 19 Student Association leaders lashed back at the policy, signing an open letter calling on administrators to abolish the time window last spring.
GW first added a time frame of 180 days last fall, before extending it to two years. That restriction set GW apart from at least 50 other universities without a reporting deadline.
University President Steven Knapp said in an interview Friday that University leaders decided to revert to GW’s original policy on timelines after receiving feedback. He said there was a misunderstanding that a statute of limitations “meant you absolutely must raise the issue after that period of time.”
He added that the policy’s current language, which does not set a deadline, still asks, “but, please, hurry up.”
“It’s a very, very serious matter that we want to take seriously and want to give everyone the opportunity to have their situations addressed in a fair way, and how you do that exactly is exactly what had to be worked out in more detail,” he said.
He said the original two-year restriction was meant to encourage quicker reporting.
“The concern is, if people wait too long and students graduate, witnesses disappear, it’s very hard to investigate, to do a fair investigation of something if it goes on too long,” Knapp said.
Senior Vice President and General Counsel Beth Nolan told The Hatchet in May the deadline would ensure “complaints are still fresh and memories haven’t faded.”
The cut-off only applied to filing formal complaints, and victims could come forward to ask about support services at any time.
GW began to revamp its now eight-year-old policy after the Department of Education penned an open “Dear Colleague” letter in 2011, asking universities to update and strengthen their sexual violence codes.
Nearly 20 percent of women who attend college are victims of actual or attempted sexual assault, according to the Department of Education, but an overwhelming number of those incidents go unreported. The number of sexual assault reports at GW totaled 12 in 2010 and 16 in 2011.

In the wake of Monday’s tragic shooting at Navy Yard, many people have rallied in favor of stricter gun laws, as is typically the case.
While immediately denouncing gun ownership and supporting tighter regulations might seem like the clear position to take after a shooting of this magnitude, the solution for the District – and our campus – is quite the opposite.
The District has some of the most stringent gun laws in the country, barring people from carrying concealed or open firearms, so you would think that we should feel safe and secure within the confines of the Beltway.
Clearly, we are not. A man with a long history of mental instability was able to transport a shotgun through the city, gain access to a gun-free military base and open fire on a crowd of people, killing 12.
But if District authorities won’t allow their residents to carry guns to defend themselves, at the very least, trained law enforcement officials must be equipped with guns to protect us. For GW students, that means the University Police Department, where officers don’t carry much more than pepper spray and handcuffs.
UPD has recently talked of expanding its authority to break up loud parties outside of GW campus boundaries. But it’s turning away from its primary mission: ensuring safety. Instead, UPD should focus its efforts on keeping students safe on campus by petitioning for the right to bear arms.
Despite serving as our primary enforcer of law and order, UPD has little ability to respond effectively to violent crime on campus, especially if these events were to involve deadly weapons. Granted, Metropolitan Police Department is armed and able to come to our aid. But UPD is our first line of defense. And right now, it’s frighteningly weak.
GW wouldn’t be the first to arm our campus police, since the call for armed university patrol officers has gained momentum recently.
Many states, including Colorado and Virginia, allow their schools’ campus police officers to carry weapons and share jurisdiction with the local police. Wayne State University – in the heart of Detroit – arms its officers. Penn State University police carry guns.
And GW has had this debate before, when administrators and consultants determined it was too risky in 2009. That decision came despite the University’s former police chief calling on campuses to arm officers.
Now is the time to reconsider.
These officers are extensively trained, often hired by the state or through an agency affiliated with the state, and held to the same standard as any other police department, as they should be.
If we are going to trust UPD with our protection, we should trust officers to carry firearms responsibly. It’s a move GW should make now to avoid a messy situation later.
This past April, campus police at the University of Rhode Island responded to the threat of a gunman with pepper spray and batons, causing an uproar over their ineffectiveness had the threat been real. State police did not arrive for another 20 minutes.
Remember, UPD officers are real members of the police force with the responsibility to make arrests and enforce order. These aren’t mall cops. Of course, GW should ensure the highest standard of training and institute strict standards to regulate which officers to arm.
Although homicides decreased in D.C. in 2012, violent crime remains all too real, as we saw Monday. With students unable to defend themselves, we need every tool in place to ensure that campus police can keep us safe.

The popular joke among students over the past few weeks goes something like this: “Doug Guthrie was the dean of the business school, responsible for teaching students how to manage money and become successful entrepreneurs. And he doesn’t even know how to balance a budget?”
The scariest part is that the joke retains a strong connection to the truth.
Guthrie was fired from his posts as dean of the GW School of Business and vice president for China operations a few weeks ago for what Provost Steven Lerman called a “profound disagreement” over how to budget for the business school. On the heels of that came the news that he spent an extra $13 million on business school operations – or roughly the amount spent on the recent renovations to Gelman Library.
Guthrie’s firing may have come as a shock to the GW community, but across higher education, top leaders being thrown out before their contracts expire is an unfortunate trend.
To that end, former University President Stephen Joel Trachtenberg – always provocative and unapologetic – provides a series of case studies of university presidents who fail at their jobs in his new book published this summer, “Presidents Derailed: Why University Leaders Fail and How to Prevent It.”
Trachtenberg, along with co-writers Gerald B. Kauvar and E. Grady Bogue, were smart to write the book when they did: “During 2009 and 2010, fifty college, university, and system presidents either resigned, retired prematurely, or were fired,” the dust jacket reads.
How serendipitous, and oddly unintentional, that a few short weeks after a former GW president releases a book on various upheavals in leadership, the University experiences some administrative turmoil of its own.
In “Presidents Derailed,” Trachtenberg enumerates six “derailment themes,” or headings under which nearly all leadership issues fall. He lists “poor interpersonal skills” and “inability to lead key constituencies” as numbers two and three.
These are exactly some of the problems that Guthrie faced. Guthrie’s firing seemed abrupt. But if we all had been aware of the warning signs, none of us would have been really surprised.
Like college presidents, deans are, by nature, torn between their responsibilities to students, faculty and administrators. And while many students credit Guthrie for his clear vision for the business school – one with a laser-sharp focus on ethics and social responsibility – it’s clear that he couldn’t build a consensus with the people who mattered.
He wanted to catapult the business school higher in the rankings – but he couldn’t convince the people who mattered to jump on board. He wanted about $35.5 million of investments from GW over five years, but only got $10 million over three years. He wanted to buy out sub-par faculty and take stronger control of the tenure process, but received immense opposition.
Then came the rumors and bizarre accusations.
Guthrie endured about 16 months of anonymous complaints that he was and having sex with colleagues and siphoning profits from the China programs he helped run, according to Monday’s Hatchet report.
The Hatchet also reported that a Faculty Senate member and nursing school associate professor Kimberly Acquaviva went to the Board of Trustees this month with claims that Faculty Senate executive committee chair and international business professor Scheharazade Rehman was behind those attacks.
The University has said that its legal office found no evidence to support allegations against Guthrie or Rehman – and until we have conclusive facts and details, we should assume the allegations are false.
But is it a coincidence that the man experiencing backlash – verified or unverified­ – from all the constituents who matter is now no longer in the top spot? I don’t think it is.
“How the president makes decisions, conveys the messages, and responds to reactions can be as important as the decisions themselves,” Trachtenberg writes in his book. And this conundrum applies to Guthrie.
Over his three-year tenure, Guthrie participated in writing the University’s strategic plan and forged a strong partnership between the University and academic programs in China. As far as achieving his goals went, Guthrie was not totally unsuccessful. But he couldn’t sell himself or build a consensus around his efforts, making his demise seem eminent, sooner or later.
What does Trachtenberg, who led GW for 17 years through ascendance and controversy, think about this?
He has made a point not to speak on the record about contentious campus issues that take place under University President Steven Knapp’s tenure. It’s unprofessional, he said, to weigh in: “Elliott never did it to me,” he reasoned, referring to Lloyd Elliott, his predecessor in the role of GW’s president.
But if he could, for a minute, ignore his objective ground rules to weigh in on the business dean drama, I wonder what he would have to say. I think his book spells it out.

Four years ago, freshman Colin Kennedy was hitting the water at a simple practice session for his Long Island youth sailing team. There, he met the man to whom he would later entrust his athletic future.
John Pearce, now GW’s sailing head coach, got an early, and rather short, glimpse at Kennedy, but the close-knit world of sailing kept the two close together.
Out on the Potomac River this fall, Kennedy and Pearce are reunited again, working together to serve as examples of the young program’s potential.
“He’s coached me along the way at different stages,” Kennedy said, “and now for it all to come back together and have him as my coach again is a tremendous opportunity that I couldn’t be any happier with.”
With only a year of varsity competition under the program’s belt, Pearce has said GW is realistically two or three years away from adding some trophies to the Smith Center shelves. The team finished toward the back of the pack in most of its tournaments last year.
Therefore, while searching for his first recruiting class last summer, Pearce had the inauspicious job of pitching an unproven program.
“As a first-year varsity program last year, the first batch of recruiting, it’s sort of a different discussion because you’re selling the potential of the program and the investment being made,” Pearce said.
But that didn’t scare Kennedy away from GW. In fact, it encouraged him.
“It makes me want to say that maybe if I do come here, and if I do put in that work and that time and effort, I can help push the team over to that point where we’re really starting to see some really good numbers up on the board, and definitely a bunch of trophies,” Kennedy said.
And he couldn’t pass up that opportunity – or that of GW’s engineering program or compete under Pearce. As Kennedy said, “every little kind of detail fell insanely into place.”
Now that he has made it to campus, Kennedy’s biggest hurdle is adjusting to the different pace of college sailing.
Since Kennedy and Pearce first met, the freshman’s expertise has always been on the laser boat – a one-person Olympic class boat.
He showed off that specialty last weekend at his debut event, the Middle Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association Laser South qualifier, when Kennedy grabbed the sixth and final qualifying spot for the MAISA Laser Championships in October. His teammate and fellow freshman Daniel DelBello finished second.
However, GW’s program, and college sailing as a whole, mostly focuses on FJ sailing – a two-person teamed boat. With all-day regattas, multiple races and different boats per day, Pearce said Kennedy has plenty to add to his tournament repertoire in order to thrive.
“For Colin and our other freshmen [DelBello and Brendan Shanahan], they can focus mostly on becoming a part of the team, blending in with our team culture, and then when they go and compete they can just focus on competition,” Pearce said.
So despite years of training and tournament experience, for the first time, Kennedy is the outsider. He’s coming into an inexperienced, but close-knit team that experienced the steep learning curve that comes with being a varsity sport last year.
Kennedy is embracing the situation, though, already seeing places where he can be a teacher and where he needs to sit back and listen to the upperclassmen. In the end, Kennedy said the high-level of competition is enough for him, as well as the opportunity to help build a program from the ground up.
“Being able to go out and sail out on the Potomac after classes, I don’t think I could be any happier than to do that. It’s like, 2 o’clock rolls around and it’s time to go sailing,” Kennedy said.

Instead of a cramped space in a corner of the Marvin Center’s first floor, the Department of Theatre and Dance’s scene shop relocated to a refurbished warehouse in Maryland this fall.
Though the space is improved, the trek underlines performance groups’ nagging space issues. The new warehouse is 30 minutes away from Foggy Bottom – in light traffic – and requires either a trip in a GW van or a Metro ride to Landover and then a five minute walk to the warehouse.
About 16 students taking Basics of Production Design and a handful of students with work-study jobs in the shop will take a GW van to Landover, Md. The students taking the Basics of Production Design class will be allowed to count travel time towards the class’s required 44 cumulative hours of outside-of-lecture work over the course of the semester, but still must find enough time once a week for a 3-hour lab, plus the drive both ways.
Many students said they have struggled to find time in their schedules to factor in the commute.
“It’s certainly farther than we would hope, and it’s less convenient than our former shop but in D.C. it’s hard to come across a good space so I think that’s what they had to settle on,” senior Aaron Pollon said.
Students also said they were worried about moving a number of set pieces back and forth during the end of each semester, when there are six main department shows and several senior thesis projects playing at once.
Matt Nickely, a senior majoring in dramatic literature who worked in the scene shop last fall, said he doesn’t see it running smoothly.
“In my head, the problem is that you’re going to have to have stuff going back and forth, and it’s not going to be so simple anymore as when [if] you need another leg, someone can go to the shop and cut one. Now, that it’s miles and miles away,” Nickely said.
The move comes after the fight for student space on campus last year came to a head, when performing student groups said they had a hard time finding a space to practice and sometimes danced in parking garages.
The department’s previous space was demolished earlier this fall to make room for the Marvin Center’s new loading dock. The building’s old loading dock was knocked down during the first stages of the construction of the “superdorm.”
And while the space crunch on GW’s urban campus is a common problem, theater groups have fought for more space and upgrades to stages for several years.
The department will test the Maryland space for this academic year, which could become permanent if logistics work well, said Carl Gudenius, a professor who teaches production design.
He added it could be a good thing because the building would allow the department to “correct some chronic issues that existed in the laboratory’s previous location” with more space to create the sets and upgraded equipment.
He said he hopes that the inconvenience will be offset by the extra space in the warehouse, which will allow students to lay out sets in the exact configurations they will sit on the stage. He said this will make it easier for designers to see the need for alterations before pieces are brought back to campus for installation.
Gudenius added that it was an “unexpected opportunity,” which is the most modern space GW has ever had to use for set production.

The University is investigating its highest faculty leader for allegedly running a smear campaign that falsely accused former GW School of Business Dean Doug Guthrie of making illegal financial deals in China and having sex with colleagues.
Faculty Senate executive committee chair Scheherazade Rehman is under investigation for allegedly making claims that Guthrie had inappropriate relationships with senior University officials and was taking extra profits from GW’s work in China.
The Office of General Counsel found that the allegations against Guthrie were false in separate investigations. Guthrie was fired as dean and vice president of China operations on Aug. 22, but remains a tenured professor.
Guthrie said he believes the controversy surrounding the 16-month-long attack played a role in his firing last month. His lawyer sent a letter to GW a week before he was fired to meet about possible defamation claims. The University fiercely denied a connection between his dismissal and the allegations.

Kimberly Acquaviva, an associate nursing professor and a member of the Faculty Senate executive committee, went to the Board of Trustees Sept. 4 with the accusation that Rehman was behind the attacks.
Acquaviva provided the board 50 pages of emails and notes during the time she allegedly witnessed Rehman trying to oust Guthrie.
“She’s very focused on destroying Doug [Guthrie],” Acquaviva said in an interview.  “It continued to escalate and got worse and worse. I decided to come forward because there was a real effort to try to run Guthrie out of the deanship.”
Acquaviva wrote in a letter to the board that she believed top officials initially ignored her complaint.

Rehman, who was elected Faculty Senate executive committee chair this spring, called allegations that she tried to bully Guthrie out of office “outrageous” and “groundless” in an interview with The Hatchet.
University President Steven Knapp and Provost Steven Lerman said GW fired Guthrie over the fallout from the business school’s $13 million worth of overspending last year – not the debunked allegations.
“Like any other allegations, we investigate them. But the conversation about the budget problems stood completely independently,” Lerman said. Knapp said he stood behind the provost’s comments.
GW’s legal office also combed through the financial details of GW’s programs in China and found no wrongdoing, Lerman said.
Guthrie said he thinks his dismissal was partially prompted by a letter from his lawyer that asked to meet with University officials about the alleged defamation six days before he was fired.

“The financial argument of the University doesn’t match up with what the reality is,” Guthrie said in an interview last week. “We also know that the timing is strange, as I was fired shortly after I hired a lawyer. And we know I had been defamed by somebody for a long time.”
He called Acquaviva a “whistleblower,” and said her claims provided “so much clarity on the context of exactly what was happening.”
Acquaviva said one day before he was fired, another senior GW administrator credited Guthrie’s threat of legal action to his dismissal.
Acquaviva claims that vice provost Terri Harris Reed told her on Aug. 21 that “the Provost had been hoping to work with Doug on the budget issues but ‘now that Doug’s threatening to burn the whole house down,’ the Provost and President are ‘done with him.'”
Reed declined to comment because the investigation is ongoing.
Emails sent to the Faculty Senate executive committee obtained by The Hatchet show Rehman raising skepticism about Guthrie’s potential conflicts of interest in China, in addition to some instances when she also attacks his character.
Rehman wrote in a July 25 email that the Faculty Senate executive committee should question potential conflicts of interest in Guthrie’s work in China because Guthrie has a “track record” of retaliation against professors.
“No [business school] faculty member is going to take on this dean directly because of retaliatory concerns on all levels,” she wrote.
The allegations of improper financial dealings in China were discussed in private meetings between the senate’s executive committee members, Acquaviva said. She alleged that Rehman told her on June 28 that Guthrie was “receiving money from a separate corporate entity related to GW’s work in China.” Rehman said Guthrie had been sharing profits with Lerman and other top administrators, according to Acquaviva’s complaint.
Several executive committee members declined to discuss those meetings because they were confidential.
Board of Trustees Chair Nelson Carbonell said top administrators had briefed him on Acquaviva’s allegations before Guthrie was fired. He said he did not know that Guthrie’s lawyer had reached out to GW.
“The administration is in the process of reviewing the matter, and the board will be briefed at the appropriate time,” Carbonell said. “That’s where it stands today. I don’t know what’s true or what’s not true. I don’t have that information.”
A power struggle
Since Guthrie’s abrupt ousting last month, his inner circle, including the school’s No. 2 administrator Philip Wirtz, has demanded a more complete explanation from GW.
Professors across the business school confirm that Guthrie was disliked by many faculty during his three years as dean.
After he was hired from New York University in 2010, Guthrie – one of the University’s highest paid officials – was quickly favored by Knapp and Lerman for his China expertise.
But a power struggle between professors and deans marred Guthrie’s tenure.
Professors said the attacks on his character were burdening – and threatening to end – Guthrie’s deanship before this summer.
“He told us one day, ‘I really have to step down because people are damaging my reputation and this defamation is unbearable.’ He was really traumatized,” said Sok-Hyon Kang, an accountancy professor who served as Guthrie’s vice dean of faculty and research for two years.
Guthrie arrived in the summer of 2010 with a mission to fix the faculty’s “deficient scholarship,” according to his original budget plan obtained by The Hatchet. He took on more power to decide tenure cases, raised research and teaching standards and pitched the idea of buyouts for faculty with lower research credentials.
“The financial argument of the University doesn’t match up with what the reality is.”  – Doug Guthrie
“I think when you’re in the position of dean, trying to move aggressively in the rankings and trying to reform a lot of practices, inevitably some people are going to be upset,” Guthrie said in an interview. “Sometimes these hard decisions upset people.”
Charles Garris, an engineering professor who also served on last year’s executive committee, said he and many of his colleagues deeply distrusted Guthrie’s plans for China.
“Dean Guthrie really was very secretive about the whole process, and that created a lot of resentment among the faculty. It violates the way we do things at GW,” Garris said, adding that the faculty brought their concerns to the provost. “We got very few answers. Dean Guthrie was very tight-lipped about everything.”
Garris pointed to two GW companies as being “fishy”: a Chinese-based company called Qiaohua Management Consulting, for which Guthrie served as executive director, and a D.C.-based company called George Washington Worldwide, which also had his name on it.
Lerman has previously told The Hatchet that the companies helped GW navigate bureaucracy, such as the ban on foreign companies hiring Chinese residents who live in China. Guthrie, a Mandarin scholar, has helped run GW’s programs in China since 2012.
Faculty dissension has boiled over in two other GW colleges in recent years, with the deans of the GW Law School and the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences also facing harsh scrutiny from professors that eventually led to their departures.
Knapp said in an interview Friday that creating a culture of respect in GW’s colleges, like in any community, is a “work in progress.”
“Especially when you have a complex institution with multiple schools, multiple departments, there are all kinds of disputes that can arise, like promotion processes where a person may not agree on one side or the other,” Knapp said. “You have to constantly work on trying to create the kind of atmosphere…you want in a community of scholars.”
The raw inner workings
Rehman defended the criticism she levied on Guthrie, saying she was helping the senate fulfill its duties of faculty governance by asking questions about partnerships in China. She staunchly denied making the verbal statements alleged by Acquaviva.
In an email to the Faculty Senate executive committee obtained by the Hatchet, Rehman said she had been “kept in the dark” about programs such as GW’s China Research Institute, its Master of Science in Finance China Program and its Confucius Institute.
“Every faculty member has the right to express themselves. But does that mean it is wrongdoing?” –  Scheherazade Rehman, Faculty Senate executive chair
“We have absolutely no formal communication in terms of actual agreements signed, legal entities created in China, activities taking place, programs delivered, involvement of compensation and faculty, etc.,” Rehman wrote in the July 30 email.
Rehman has a long list of credentials and an influential voice at GW. She worked her way up to the Faculty Senate’s top position, often speaking at Board of Trustees meetings and helping write the University’s strategic plan.
In an interview, Rehman said she has seen the emails Acquaviva sent to the Board of Trustees, which included blunt messages written by the executive committee chair that criticized administrators.
Rehman said while those emails may show an embarrassing side of the Faculty Senate’s raw inner workings, she had no issues with Guthrie’s deanship or the University’s China operations.
“Every faculty member has the right to express themselves. But does that mean it is wrongdoing?” she said.
