Student Health Service may scale back its free HIV testing clinics next year if it doesn’t see an increase in visitors, Student Association president Ashwin Narla said.
The free weekly clinic opened in November, after SA leaders lobbied to nix a $25 appointment fee they said deterred students from getting tested. About 120 students took the free tests in November and December – just 17 more than the same time last year when the fee was in place.
To draw more students, SHS is tapping student organizations like Allied in Pride and the GW Student Global AIDS Campaign to help with a marketing push. But if it fails, Narla said the clinics could be scaled down to two or three times per semester.
Chapter Leader for the GW Student Global AIDS Campaign Katherine Wynne said that the organization is “going to fight like heck” to preserve the free HIV clinics. “Other campuses have free testing. GW should not be an exception,” Wynne said.
SHS provided 528 HIV tests last year, a 200-test drop from the year before.
Narla said he was hopeful for the clinics’ success after more than 30 students came to the first session. But he said participation waned after midterms.
“Hopefully we can raise the numbers up a little bit, but if they continue to decline, I’ll be the first person to say we tried this program. But we didn’t see as much involvement as we would like, so we’ll take the next step forward and see what we can do differently,” Narla said.
Associate Director of Student Health Service Susan Haney said some students have found other avenues to get tested, such as routine office visits and through agencies like the D.C. Department of Health. The GW Hospital has also offered free walk-in testing since 2006. CVS also sells over-the-counter tests.
Haney added that the SHS did not have “any expectation of the numbers we would serve” and that she was pleased students were coming in.

It’s easy to grow cynical as institutions of higher education become more business-like, driven by what is best for their wallets rather than their students.
But the University’s move toward offering open online courses for anyone to take, regardless of enrollment status, demonstrates a commitment to shaping an educated and informed global citizenry.
Massive open online courses, called MOOCs in the field of higher education, allow anyone with computer access to learn from top-notch academics and scholars through video lectures and slides for free or for a low cost.
These free online courses help democratize education for those who crave knowledge but might lack the ability to pursue a college degree due to financial or other constraints.
Some estimates have pegged the cost of creating the courses at $50,000 each, and the move toward MOOCs is an indication that the University is financially confident.
It is worth it to spend resources in the name of sharing knowledge with others. The positive returns for GW might not be in the form of money, but that does not mean it will have been a lost cause.
And professors will feel encouraged to join the online education community because it will afford them the chance to reach a wider audience than in a traditional classroom setting. Conversely, having students that are genuinely interested in the subject matter makes for a better learning environment.
For those truly invested in higher education, massive open online courses are a win-win.
An online program of this nature could also afford GW indirect benefits. For example, if a student takes a free online course through GW while in high school, he or she might be inspired by the professor and choose to apply to the University as an undergraduate.
The courses are also a sign of prestige. With this move, GW will be joining the ranks of a small group of elite universities at the academic vanguard. It is a direct way to increase the University’s publicity at a time when institutions across the country are competing for an international audience.
Critics of these burgeoning programs might say that if GW decides to offer online courses, it will be trying to blaze a path in areas that have already been tread by other elite institutions. They say GW would be a small fish in a very large pond.
But GW can make an impact. The University should plan to create courses in areas where it can exercise its strengths – subjects that have not necessarily been extensively explored by other institutions online, like government and policy.
This is why universities exist – to educate. It is noble to improve access to education and worldwide enlightenment.

Hurricane Sandy left destruction and devastation in its wake, but student artists have harnessed the storm’s after-effects and channelled them into works of art.
Gallery 102, the art department’s student-run exhibition space, located in Smith Hall, will host an art show featuring student works commemorating the resilience and perseverance that stemmed from the October storm.
“It was something that was proposed because of its relevancy,” said Travis Beauchene, president of Gallery 102 and a master’s in fine arts candidate. “We like to make this space a really diverse space, so we don’t want just paintings, we don’t want just sculptures. For this piece, it’s more of the humanistic qualities, and we really want stories.”
A committee of around 10 undergraduate and graduate students approved the show, titled “Sandy’s Stories,” for the exhibition. Beauchene added that the exhibit not only reflects upon the damages caused by the storm, but also the strength of the communities it afflicted – what he called “the triumph of the people.”
The showcase features the artwork of fine arts majors junior Christie Malvin and sophomore Crystal Ghantous, who each used their artistic talents – Malvin’s collage and Ghantous’ time-based art – to interpret the effects of the storm.
Malvin created two pieces, a collage and a manipulated photograph.
She said she was concerned about whether to focus solely on the devastation nationally, or branch out and depict the storm’s international impact. She put her worries aside and instead began working on a collage starring children’s books characters.
“I decided…to really reinterpret [the storm] and not use images from it whatsoever, and rather allude to it,” Malvin said, of her piece which focuses more on the themes of the storm than its physical aspects.
Her second piece is a large photograph in which she created what she calls a “false landscape through artificial means.” Unlike the collage, the photograph was not made specifically for the show.
“It includes a lot of different moving horizontal lines to emphasize a little bit of frenzy or anxiousness,” Malvin said.
Malvin added that the show is important because events like Sandy allow people to focus on the lasting impacts.
Ghantous’ piece is a woven sculpture-like installation that she constructed from round reed, a material commonly used to create woven baskets. Originally created for an assignment in a class about gravity, she calls the cylindrical work “The Parasite.”
She hung it in a small space outside Phillips Hall during the hurricane.
“It’s warped, like, a ton… It survived it so gracefully,” she said.
One artist documented a local art gallery that the hurricane affected, which will also be featured in the show.
“So many times, when bad things happen, we want to forget it and move on. But I think when that happens, we sort of forget the good that comes out of it,” Beauchene said.
The show debuts Jan. 20 will run until Feb. 1.

Almost.
It’s a word that rings in your ears without bringing any comfort. You could almost see the Colonials thinking it as the final buzzer rang. Almost beat Temple, as Bryan Bynes dropped into a crouch. Almost had a statement win, as Lasan Kromah punched the air. Almost, finally, nabbed a game at the wire, as Patricio Garino stared on in disbelief from the bench.
The scoreboard read Temple 55, GW 53. The Colonials had almost done it – but with a sickening sense of deja-vu that seems to loom over the team, it had come down to a final possession. And the ball didn’t go in.
“It’s very frustrating. I thought we had a chance to have that lead late, and we just didn’t do a good job in ‘time-to-score’ situations,” head coach Mike Lonergan said.
The Colonials watched the game slip out of their hands over the final few minutes of play, tinged by questionable calls that left Lonergan screaming from the sidelines.
“I think our crowd, when they’re that loud, I thought there was a couple of times they were pushing off, the ball went out of bounds,” Lonergan said. “There was one obvious one across from our bench, it went out of bounds. Guy told me he didn’t see it, well, you’ve got to ask your partner. They’re a good crew, they’re very good referees, I just thought the calls didn’t go our way. There were a lot of them.”
What pushed the Colonials so close Wednesday night – indeed, what put them solidly in control of the game before the break – was their defense. GW set up in a man-to-man scheme with heavy pressure that seemed to mount as the game went on. Many times, Temple was forced to end possessions with desperation shots. A lid seemed to be on the basket as shot after shot clanged out.
The Owls closed the game shooting 40.8 percent, most of their baskets coming off re-energized play in the second half. In the first, Temple could only make seven baskets and entered the break down by 10. The second saw better shooting from the Owls, including potent forward Khalif Wyatt, who lit GW up for 18 after only scoring five in the first half.
“I told our guys, look at that stat sheet. The reason we’re in the game against a very good team with a very good coach and a chance to win is our defense,” Lonergan said. “We just have to figure out a way to score some more baskets.”
The Colonials’ shooting wasn’t lights-out, but they displayed key follow-through that gave them the edge at the end of the first 20 minutes of play. The players stuck with shots if they didn’t fall, grabbing a 10-6 advantage on the offensive boards and a 34-31 overall rebounding victory.
GW was paced by senior forward Isaiah Armwood, who shot 32 percent for the game and fell one rebound short of his sixth double-double of the season with 13 points and nine boards. Senior forward Dwayne Smith and senior guard Bryan Bynes each added nine points off the bench, Garino posted eight.
“We got outrebounded at Xavier in front of a sold out crowd,” Lonergan said. “The thing I like about our team, we always learn from our mistakes. I feel bad for the guys. I’m proud of their effort. But we need to get that win, something to show for it.”
It was a scoring drought that, in the end, was GW’s undoing. The Colonial tally didn’t change over the final seven minutes and 53 seconds of play. That stall, along with the team’s 63.2 percentage from the charity stripe, were missed opportunities Lonergan said GW could ill afford.
“They came out in the second half, they trapped us, we turned the ball over a couple of times,” Armwood said. “That’s really what got them going, got them on the fast break.”
His head coach agreed, adding that the setback rattled the team.
“I think we panicked. We had some veterans take some threes that – just hacked up some threes. We went away from getting the ball inside,” Lonergan said.
And slowly, over the second half, Temple came chugging back, first tying the game and then taking the lead with two minutes left off of a pair of free throws.
With 30 seconds left, Bynes had it. He dribbled for seven seconds, drove in and missed. Smith couldn’t put it back. And the buzzer sounded on another almost.
“We were down two, I was playing for overtime. I didn’t want to shoot a three. We’re not a great three-point shooting team,” Lonergan said. “We were really just trying to spread it and attack the rim. [Bynes] was having a good game, he’s by far the quickest player, we just didn’t execute.”

The city has forced two of Ivory Tower’s four elevators to close until they are brought up to code and reinspected, after the University illegally installed new parts without a permit.
GW was hit with a $2,000 fine and two violations from the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs over winter break, including one for a disabled smoke system, agency spokesman Helder Gil said. Students are barred from using the two out-of-service elevators – congesting the two working elevators – until GW provides proper documentation to the regulatory body, which will reinspect the facilities over the next week.
The violations come on the heels of dozens of student complaints about building elevators. Students said they have been trapped in elevators in buildings including Schenley, Strong, City and Ivory halls, with others reporting elevators that suddenly dropped several floors and temporarily trapped students. Sororities in Strong Hall told members to avoid the elevators last December, after one dropped several floors on the way down.
The elevator contractor was conducting maintenance when he “was informed that [GW] would be required to apply for and receive a permit, which was not the understanding of the contractor given past experience with this type of work,” Senior Associate Vice President of Operations Administration John Ralls said. He said the elevators will be back in service after the regulatory agency processes the permits. GW is appealing the Ivory Tower fine.
“Following notification of this request from DCRA, the university’s contractor took all steps necessary to have the requested permit issued and inspection conducted and is currently awaiting action by DCRA,” he said in an email.
With two elevators out of service, Ivory Tower residents have been frustrated by long lines in the 10-floor building’s lobby, particularly during move-in last weekend. Some students have also said they don’t feel safe taking the elevators that are running, instead choosing to take the stairs.
Ninth-floor Ivory resident Jordan Halevy said he has been caught in one of the building’s elevators before.
“Usually, one elevator will not be working, and that’s inconvenient in itself,” Halevy, a junior, said. “Now with two, it’s even more so. It’s really annoying and it takes forever.”
When asked how many times University police had responded to elevator outages, University Police Chief Kevin Hay said Jan. 8, ”Elevator outages during this academic year have not been higher or lower than previous years.”
University officials have refused multiple times this academic year to release the number of reports of malfunctioning elevator to FixIT or UPD. The department records when someone is stuck in the system.
GW has invested millions of dollars in elevator and building upgrades in its residence halls in recent years. Upgrades to Guthridge cost $2.05 million in fiscal year in 2012, followed by a combined $3 million in upgrades to Munson, Dakota and Strong halls in fiscal year 2013.
One elevator replacement in The Dakota about $300,000, according to GW’s 2013 capital and operating budget.
Junior Alex Theofanides said it’s never been this bad.
“We pay so much money to go here. They can at least have working elevators,” said Theofanides, who added that she didn’t know the elevators were shut down by the city.
Another Ivory resident, senior Alexander Zafran, said there have been times none of the elevators work.
“Sometimes you get a nice surprise in the morning when there are no elevators working. So it’s always important to expect the unexpected,” he said.

The number of undergraduate science and math majors in the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences shot up 25 percent in the last four years, according to newly released data.
The surge shows that students are buying into the University’s rapid build-up in technical fields, as it invests $275 million in the Science and Engineering Hall and millions more into new science faculty and research money to join the ranks of top research institutions.
“The growth in [science, technology, engineering and math] majors is consistent with the University’s goal – and the push at the national level for greater emphasis on STEM education – to build the science and engineering enterprise,” Columbian College dean Peg Barratt said.
Some departments have expanded after being some of the college’s smallest four years ago. For example, the number of biological anthropology majors grew from 12 to 34, and math majors have shot up from 10 to 28, along with smaller gains in larger programs like biology and physics. The data does not count double majors in its total.
The Columbian College has added about 10 new faculty positions overall in the last three years. Barratt refused to say how many of those positions were in science and math, and how many were in social sciences, arts and humanities.
Reza Modarres, head of the statistics department, said it has hired two new faculty members and is looking to bring on four more this year. Likewise, Yongwu Rong, head of the math department, said his department has hired adjunct faculty to cover additional teaching needs.
Both Modarres and Rong said class sizes have increased over the past few years, an issue they said they’ve done their best to keep under control.
“We have been stretched quite a bit,” Modarres said. “We hope it continues – but at a rate that we can handle.”
Barratt said the economy and workforce demands may also influence students’ majors. The college has also doubled the number of Chinese students since 2008, with many favoring technical fields.
Over the same period, which increased the college’s enrollment by only 0.5 percent overall, some social science and humanities programs saw sharp declines, potentially putting those programs’ budgets and hiring priorities at risk.
The number of art history majors fell from 46 to 28, while Hispanic languages and literature dwindled from 24 to four students.
But Barratt remained mum on what the shift in science and math majors meant for other fields.
She said she hasn’t needed to tighten resources for humanities and social sciences by slowing down hiring or cutting funding because the school’s overall budget has grown and the college has “a bigger pie, so nobody’s hungry.” She declined to say by how much the budget has increased.
She also refused to say how many professor positions the school had added or taken away in social sciences or humanities saying she did not think it was relevant.
While hiring budgets are set by the provost’s office, deans decide which departmental faculty requests to pitch to Rice Hall.
Barratt said the college is not trying to reach its science and math goals at the expense of programs in the humanities, arts or social sciences, pointing to strong growth in the number of students majoring in economics, fine arts and criminal justice.
 The history department has dropped to 125 majors, down from 149 in 2008, but history professor Tyler Anbinder said the department has still seen strong enrollment in classes from students taking general requirements.
The former department chair said he thinks students will return to more humanities-based majors when the economy rebounds.
Robert McRuer, who chairs the English department, which has seen a decline of majors from 160 to 121 over the last four years, said humanities are not facing cuts at the expense of technical fields. The department got a green light to hire for a new faculty position in poetry this year and a interdisciplinary role in disability studies, he said.
“Not only have we gotten what we’ve asked for, recently, but we’ve actually been surprised to get more than we thought we would,” he said. “So as far as science is concerned, we in the English department are in favor of the science study being part of the liberal arts education.”
Due to misinformation, The Hatchet incorrectly reported that the 10 new faculty hires in Columbian College over the last three years were for science and math majors. The 10 hires were actually for all fields.

The University is organizing a second service event to recognize the civil rights movement because the original date clashed with inauguration weekend.
Students can volunteer with the Unite America in Service event Jan. 19,  in addition to the Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Service Jan. 26. It is the first time the service day honoring King has coincided with inauguration festivities.
Nearly 200 students are slated to participate in the Jan. 19 service day, with 250 students – the full capacity for the event – committing to serving Jan. 26, as of last week. About 400 students served at last year’s MLK Day of Service.
GW will coordinate with National Day of Service efforts, part of the president’s inauguration service challenge. Volunteers will pack 100,000 care kits for deployed U.S. service members, wounded soldiers, veterans and first responders. The event, coordinated by the nonprofit Point of Lights and Target Corporation and cosponsored by several other service groups, will be held near the D.C. Armory.
“It will allow our students to serve alongside volunteers from across D.C. and with people who have traveled to D.C. from across the country to participate in the inauguration festivities,” Executive Director of the Center for Civic Engagement and Public Service Amy Cohen said. She added that serving on that day is important because the President asked all Americans to take part.
Rap artists Pharrell Williams and MC Lyte will serve alongside volunteers, and University President Steven Knapp will speak, among others.
Over the next few weeks, the Multicultural Student Services Center is also launching a series of events commemorating black history, including the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation and the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, this fall. Programs will include lecture series, awards ceremonies and other service events.
“For me, this is one of the first all-University community-oriented approaches to diversity and inclusion programming,” Director of the MSSC Michael Tapscott said. “It’s a really, really great kick-off to this part of the celebration.”
The University is also planning a culminating service day, specifically focused on the March on Washington, which will be held once students return to campus in the fall.

The University will spend almost $700,000 to throw an inaugural ball, dress up Union Station with GW billboards for D.C. visitors and advertise during a television broadcast of the parade.
The expenditures total about $10,000 less than GW shelled out on the extravagant ball and much-hyped float in 2009, though Vice President for External Relations Lorraine Voles said the University tried to curb spending this year while still using the event to push its brand.
The University will pay about $600,000 for this year’s ball, about $40,000 more than it spent in 2009 in today’s dollars. GW recouped two-thirds of 2009’s ball costs from ticket sales.
“I was trying to cut some corners here and there, but if people pay $100 for a ticket, they want a nice experience, and they’ll have that. We’re not going to recoup 100 percent but a significant part of that cost,” she said. “The University will absorb the costs of the activity within the regular budget.”
The University did not design a float for the inaugural parade this year, a project that cost $134,000 in 2009. Instead, it’s taking a “different strategy,” Voles said, focusing on the marketing momentum built up from the fall unveiling of its rebranding campaign.
GW will broadcast a 30-second spot on “cable and major TV networks around inauguration,” University spokeswoman Candace Smith said. It also filled the halls of Union Station with a dozen lighted billboards that chronicle the success of students who are veterans or interested in environmental policy. It also paid for billboards in the Metro last fall after officially launching GW’s new look.
“We think there are these really special things about our university that people don’t necessarily know. These stories haven’t been highlighted over the years,” Voles said.
Neither Smith nor Voles would disclose the costs of the advertising campaign, but Voles said the total costs of inauguration-related activities would not quite reach the 2009 amount.
Administrators have also pumped out an elaborate social media contest as an expense-free way of generating student excitement, keeping its name buzzing and instilling GW pride during throughout inaugural weekend.
Students who give GW shoutouts in their tweets, Facebook posts,  YouTube videos or Instagram posts can win a MacBook Air, an iPad or an iPad mini.
Social media guru Jon Hussey, who tagged onto the University’s online strategy team in August, said the challenge can help prospective students connect to GW.
“Really, social media is about building community, and the byproduct of that is prospective students have an easy way of getting a real sense of the GW community,” Hussey said.
He added that the University will also launch a social media campaign around Commencement, held on the National Mall.
Voles said it was not just appealing to potential students in its advertising campaign, but shooting for more exposure overall as a university in the nation’s capital.
“There are so many audiences. We know we can’t be all things for all people, but for the inaugural activities at large, we hope there’s something for everyone. We want new visitors coming to D.C. to get a picture for GW and spark their interest,” says Voles.
GW is the only Beltway school with major inauguration plans.
Instead of scheduling a ball or inauguration-related activities, Georgetown University will launch its Martin Luther King, Jr. Week celebration with community service days and local awards. American University will have a similar celebration and plans to host a inauguration champagne brunch Jan. 23.
University of Maryland-College Park will send its marching band to the inaugural parade, but is without big plans because its students will not yet be back on campus. George Mason University will host a free on-campus dance party Jan. 25 but has no plans to advertise the school in the areas surrounding inaugural festivities.
