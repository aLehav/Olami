Athletic events will open to ticketed fans beginning Sunday, and campus facilities with public access will reopen to the public on Monday.
All in-person activities will resume beginning Monday as GW’s COVID-19 caseload continues to decline, officials announced Thursday.
Athletic events will open to ticketed fans beginning Sunday, and campus facilities with public access will reopen to the public on Monday, officials said in an email. Classes had resumed in person earlier this month after officials moved the first week of the semester online, but administrators had held off on removing further restrictions amid a continued high number of coronavirus cases driven by the Omicron variant.
“We are able to take this action thanks to the collective efforts of our community members to keep one another healthy and safe,” officials said.
The Lerner Health and Wellness Center and the West Hall Fitness Center will also reopen Monday, and library study rooms will no longer be restricted to one occupant, the email states.
The loosened restrictions will allow fans to attend Sunday’s men’s basketball game against Fordham, which begins at noon. Club and intramural sports will also resume Sunday.
“We are now positively thrilled to welcome our fans back as our teams have greatly missed your loud and GW-proud support,” the Athletics Department said in a release. “There is nothing like a packed Smith Center.”
Officials have required the COVID-19 booster shot, offered free N95 masks, reserved off-campus housing for students who contract the virus and implemented regular testing plans to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. Officials said campus visitors are expected to be fully vaccinated and boosted.
GW’s seven-day positivity rate has fallen below 3 percent in recent days, a steady decline since the first week of classes when 548 community members tested positive. Despite the larger number of cases, interim University President Mark Wrighton said in an interview earlier this month that no community members who contracted the virus this semester had severe illness.
“We acknowledge that the past six weeks have been challenging for all of us,” officials said. “We appreciate your continued patience and for working together to adhere to our health and safety protocols.  Your efforts have directly contributed to our ability to return to our campuses for a comprehensive in-person semester.”

D.C. is reporting an average of about 417 new cases each day, which is down from a daily average of about 2,000 new cases a day at the beginning of January.
Mayor Muriel Bowser announced Wednesday she is extending D.C.’s indoor mask mandate until the end of February.
The mandate, reinstated in December as cases began to surge with the spread of the Omicron variant, was set to expire next week, but Bowser said D.C.’s falling but still high caseload has necessitated the extension. Earlier this month, the District started to require proof of vaccination for entry to certain indoor venues, like restaurants, bars and gyms.
Bowser also extended the public health emergency – which would have expired Wednesday – until Feb. 15 to mitigate staffing shortages and other concerns at hospitals as they address a surge of patients. Although the number of cases has decreased since December, the order states hospitals are still under “stress” from the number of people seeking COVID-19 tests, treatment and ventilators.
“By extending the limited public health emergency, the District and our health care partners can continue to respond expeditiously and safely to COVID-19 and its ongoing and changing impacts,” the order reads.
D.C. is reporting an average of about 417 new daily cases, which is down from an average of more than 2,000 daily new cases at the beginning of January. Cases at GW have also fallen in recent days, with officials reporting 238 positive cases last week.

The loss continues the program’s 15-game winless streak outside of the Eastern time zone stretching back to Dec. 25, 2014.
Men’s basketball fell to a talented Saint Louis team Wednesday night.
The Colonials (6-12, 2-4 A-10) got a strong scoring performance from junior guard James Bishop, who finished with a career high 30 points, two assists and a rebound on 9-of-19 shooting from the floor. But the Billikens’ (13-6, 4-2 A-10) offense was too much for GW to handle in a 80-67 loss in which the home team never trailed.
“Overall I’m disappointed with our defensive toughness,” Head coach Jamion Christian said. “I felt like we were getting to a point where we’re really doing well defensively and we had a setback tonight.”
The loss continues the program’s 15-game winless streak outside of the Eastern time zone stretching back to Dec. 25, 2014. The last time the team won an Atlantic 10 game outside of the Eastern time zone was Feb. 13, 2006.
“When you’re in the A-10, you’re playing in really, really great basketball environments,” Christian said. “So there’s always a great home court advantage. At the end of the day it just really comes down to the physical toughness on the road.”
Saint Louis was led by redshirt freshman Gibson Jimmerson, who finished the game with 28 points and four rebounds on 11-of-20 shooting from the field and 6-of-11 shooting from 3-point range. Jimmerson gave the Colonial defense fits all night with his backdoor cuts and off ball movement.
“I feel like if we made Jimmerson be a passer, you know, he had 30 tonight,” Christian said. “He’s a great offensive player. I thought we could have done a better job on him.”
The Colonials struggled with turnovers to begin the game, and the Billikens made them pay, finishing with 19 points off 14 GW turnovers. Meanwhile, GW had 9 points on eight Saint Louis turnovers.
“It really put us off to a bad start because you can’t afford to do that,” Christian said. “You got to take care of the basketball. And we just didn’t do that.”
GW struggled on the offensive boards, with Saint Louis out rebounding GW 14-8 off the glass. The Billikens were able to score 15 second chance points, compared to GW’s five. Overall, the Billikens had a 39-30 rebounding advantage on the night, spearheaded by junior forward Francis Okoro, who had 22 points and 11 rebounds.
The return of senior forward Ricky Lindo following a 44-day absence due to COVID-19 and an injury could have helped the Colonials in the rebounding department. But the D.C. native only scored two points and grabbed four rebounds through 22 minutes in his return.
The Colonials saw some history unfold, as sophomore guard Yuri Collins etched himself into the Billikens record books, recording 12 assists tonight to become the all-time assists leader in Saint Louis men’s basketball history with 444.
He is second in the country in assists per game, averaging 8.26. Collins also had 11 points and five rebounds, going a perfect 5-5 from the field.
GW struggled offensively in the first half, scoring only 25 points compared to the 42 they scored in the second half. Although they found their groove in the second half, the Colonials offense was stymied by the Billikens defense, which forced them into tough shots late in the shot clock early on in the game.
The Colonials had a sluggish start to the second half, with Saint Louis scoring 4 unanswered points to start the half. Christian responded by taking a timeout 1:56 into the half to prevent further damage.
GW showed some life after that on the offensive end, but they couldn’t get the defensive stops to go along with it. By the under 12-minute media timeout, the Billikens were up by 21 points and never looked back.
GW continued to have success offensively in the middle of the second half, thanks to some impressive finishes by Bishop, sophomore guard Joe Bamisile, and freshman guard Brayon Freeman, but couldn’t get within striking distance.
Bamisile was GW’s second leading scorer with 18 points on an efficient 8-of-14 from the floor to go along with three rebounds, a block, and an assist. Freeman came to life offensively in the second half, scoring all 8 of his points, while finishing with three assists, a steal and a rebound.
The Colonials front court offense sputtered after impressing in the team’s 63-61 win over Rhode Island. Lindo was the only GW forward to get on the board, chipping in 2 points.
Although Lindo came back from injury, the Colonials were still without sophomore center Noel Brown, who has also been out with an injury. Christian said the team hopes to have Brown back for the Colonials next game.
“We’ll get back to campus, we’ll kind of see where he is,” Christian said. “We were hoping to have him tonight but he had a little bit of a setback. So hopefully we’ll get him on Sunday.”
The Colonials return to the floor on Sunday for a noon tip-off on USA Network against Fordham. The matchup with the Rams begins a crucial stretch of three consecutive home games, which also includes matchups with La Salle and No. 25 Davidson.

Davidson controlled the game on both sides despite conceding one more turnover than GW, racking up 17 points off of Colonial turnovers compared to GW’s nine.
Women’s basketball dropped their fifth consecutive game, marking a winless conference slate, as the Colonials continue to struggle to set in a win.
The Colonials (7-11, 0-5 A-10) scored the first bucket of the match but fell behind soon after as the Wildcats (12-6, 3-3 A-10) routed them at home 67-37. Davidson controlled the game on both sides despite conceding one more turnover than GW and racking up 17 points off of Colonial turnovers compared to GW’s nine.
Junior guard Nya Lok led the Colonials, notching 7 points on 2-of-5 shooting from the field while graduate student guard Sierra Bell followed with 6 points, ripping three rebounds for the team.
Freshman forward Elle Sutphin led the Wildcats with 16 points on a perfect 5-of-5 from the floor along with a pair of rebounds. Senior guard/forward Sarah Konstans followed closely behind with 13 points and a steal.
GW shot 22.2 percent from the floor on the night, only netting 5.9 percent clip from beyond the arc. Davidson hit 56.5 percent from the court, while sinking 7-of-15 from deep.
Redshirt junior forward Mayowa Taiwo, graduate student guard Kyara Frames, sophomore guard Taylor Webster, junior guard Sheslanie Laureano and Lok combined for a 10 points in the first quarter. Taiwo kicked off the scoring with a layup in the opening minute.
But the Wildcats came out hot to start the game, hitting 7-of-9 from the field and 4-of-5 from deep. A 3-pointer by Konstans with 8:05 left to play gave Davidson a lead that would last for the remainder of the game.
The Colonials entered a scoring drought after a jumper from Laureano pulled them into double figures with 2:36 left in the first quarter, lasting through the first minute of the second quarter.
Despite converting just 3-of-11 from the field in the second quarter, GW was able to keep Davidson from running away with the game, holding them to 13 points and 38.5 percent from the floor. The Colonials cashed in on 4 points from the line to net 10 points of their own in total.
GW fell into another scoring drought in the third quarter, scoring just 4 points through its entirety, thanks to a layup by Bell at the 5:51 mark and two free throws in the final two minutes. The Wildcats took advantage of the drought, netting 6-of-12 while holding the Colonials to 1-of-8 to increase their lead to 23 points.
GW returned to the fourth quarter, continuing to struggle on both sides of the ball. The Colonials allowed 14 points in the paint while scoring just two of their own inside their opponent’s paint. The Wildcats improved their shooting in the final frame, finishing with eight field goals, the most of any quarter while adding another 3-point bucket.
While Davidson refused to let up, GW faced another four-minute scoring drought that was finally ended by a free throw from Bell with 5:55 left in the game. The Colonials then went on to score 7 more points from the charity stripe despite finishing 2-of-12 from the field and 1-of-7 from 3-point range.
GW ended the match with a duo of free throws by freshman forward Sophie Haydon as the Wildcats finished ahead 67-37.
Though GW finished their nonconference slate with an overall record of 7-6, the Colonials have begun their conference schedule with zero wins. GW has struggled to generate offensive production in the absence of graduate student forward Ty Moore.
The Colonials are back on the road Saturday where they will face George Mason in the hopes of snapping their five-game losing streak and capturing their first conference win. Tipoff is set for 3 p.m.

The day before the start of the second semester of my freshman year, it snowed heavily. Having grown up in California, I had never experienced wind or snow at this level, and it was a new and exciting environment for me. There was an immediacy to the weather, a biting cold that necessitated certain clothes and shoes. As a freshman, the snow felt like one more way in which college was proving to be a novel experience. 
I lived on the Mount Vernon Campus at the time, but my roommates and I were in Foggy Bottom when we found out that all the Vern Express shuttles were halted because of the snow. Us Vernies were herded out of the Vex and left to our own devices to get back to the safety of our residence halls. My roommates and I decided it was best we walked, reasoning that Ubers, like the Vex’s, also did not have the desire nor the capacity to drive uphill in icy conditions to drop us off at the Vern. 
Though I was excited by the atmosphere of the snow, and our adventurous walk home, I also happened to be insanely depressed around this time. So when we got home from the walk, I kicked my roommate out of the room, turned off the lights, burrowed in my bed and cried. But what is most memorable from that day is not the next two hours of feeling like I was drowning in my own tears, nor was it the feeling of not being able to get out of bed to make myself some dinner. What is most memorable from that day is hearing the cries of pure joy my roommates let out just beyond my closed door when we all got a text saying that classes would be canceled the next day due to snow. That feeling of joy is emblazoned in my mind, and I associate it with every snow day that has come thereafter. 
In pandemic times, the University has made it easier to capture lectures and hold discussions over Blackboard or Zoom. This has been helpful in continuing what needs to get done throughout the pandemic, but I worry that online learning will continue to bleed into our lives in ways it doesn’t have to. The pandemic’s side effects should not begin a culture of prioritizing work regardless of what is happening in the world. Rather, we should preserve and continue to embrace the few times that the outside world penetrates our insular lives. 
Every time it snows, I look forward to my Instagram feed looking the same shade of white – my friends posting pictures of their day on the soccer field on the Vern to play in the snow or their venture out to see the newly blanketed National Mall. But if snow days are overruled by a simple shift to online learning for a day until the snow clears, this pure, elemental joy that we all share will evaporate. 
For professors and administrators, shifting from in-person to online learning to account for the weather is forgivably an easy mistake to make. After all, the temptation of not missing a day’s worth of work on the syllabus, or avoiding having to coordinate makeup days, is difficult not to give in to. But for students, a snow day is sacred. It means taking a break from staring at our laptops, it means that school isn’t everything. 
A snow day puts life in perspective for students, allowing us to remember that we’re not bots doomed to  searching for keywords on JSTOR until the end of our college days. Snow days provide us the opportunity to remember that we’re human and that our lives have space for the serendipitous prospect of enjoying a day out with friends in a fairly rare, snowy environment. 
A snow day has the possibility to mean many things. It can mean an extra day to fold the laundry you haven’t been able to get around to, a day to enjoy streets with fewer cars and more people enjoying their new, snowy surroundings or maybe just a day to call all the friends whose schedules never align with yours and hang out. What a snow day shouldn’t mean is another day of school a la Zoom instead of in person. For students, a snow day should be restful, restorative and joyful.

GW promised to create a healthy and safe environment for the GW community in their COVID-19 Campus Health and Wellbeing Policy, but the 25 percent of students who live off campus are not provided the same support as on-campus students. 
The University requires students who test positive for the coronavirus to quarantine until the Colonial Health Center clears them from isolation. On-campus students are expected to follow these guidelines, but if a student does not live on campus, then GW offers no assistance for them to isolate away from their roommates. 
Instead, GW should offer every student, including those who live off-campus, a place to quarantine to keep the community safe and support students during the stress of a positive result. Otherwise, off-campus students may have no choice but to isolate themselves in their apartment and potentially risk infecting others they live with. 
Because all students, including those who live in non-GW housing, are attending in-person classes and are exposing themselves to the same risks as every other student, the University should provide contigency plans for all students to minimize the risk of the virus spreading throughout campus. 
The University has diverged from Georgetown and American universities in returning to in-person classes before the end of January. GW made this decision while D.C. was experiencing a surge of COVID-19 cases among the largest in the country, even though the amount of COVID-19 cases in the District is now trending downward. Mayor Muriel Bowser has even responded to the circumstances by declaring a public health emergency on Jan. 11th.
When a student tests positive for COVID-19, they’re offered a different level of resources and assistance based on their living circumstances. On-campus students are assigned a member of the Division for Student Affairs team to help them receive meals and medications. If they have a roommate, the student who tested positive is provided with another room on campus where they can isolate and the Student Support Team delivers food and other necessities to their quarantine location. Off-campus students who test positive for COVID-19 are expected to figure out how to isolate wherever they live and do not have access to subsidized food deliveries like on-campus students do.
The consequences of contracting COVID-19 in class will be harsher for those who live off campus, because off-campus students might not have access to a room away from their roommates or might not have access to affordable food delivery services. Those who live among other students off campus must manage the expense of a hotel or force their roommate to leave their shared apartment. 
Though the CDC does not require people to quarantine if they’re exposed to COVID-19 so long as they’re vaccinated, the University offers on-campus students with roommates or suitemates with no access to a private bedroom and bathroom a place to quarantine until they are cleared by the Colonial Health Center. Thus, the University has a clear standard to limit the spread of COVID-19, and it would be beneficial to the entire community if a similar standard and offering applied and was given to off-campus students as well.
Students who do not pay for on-campus housing and the dining plan associated with it are still use campus spaces, eat at GW dining vendors and share living spaces with other students. The University could require off-campus students to pay a small, additional fee for these services. This way, students would have a guaranteed way of securing meals and not face food insecurity. Additionally, they would not have to pay for delivery service fees that might cost more than the University’s subsidized charges and cannot be paid out of the allotted GWorld allowance like on-campus students. 
The pandemic has damaged GW’s budget, but it has also caused distress for students. A significant portion of students live in non-GW housing and they’re still part of the community. This offer would prove the University is actually considering the whole student body.

Senators also filled one vacancy Monday as the body has faced a large number of resignations throughout the year so far.
The Student Association Senate did not debate any legislation at its second meeting of the semester Monday.
Senators have passed more than 20 pieces of legislation so far this academic year, marking the third straight fall semester they did so. SA Sen. Yan Xu, ESIA-U and the chair of the finance committee, announced at the meeting that the finance committee will create guidelines this semester to explain how student organizations can request co-sponsorships from the finance committee and “info sheets” explaining certain financial concepts like areas the SA is prohibited from funding.
He said these guidelines will help student organizations understand how to request general allocations for the fall 2022 semester.
“We will have more guidelines and info sheets in this upcoming semester to help everyone to navigate this very complicated financial process,” Xu said at the meeting.
Senators unanimously passed a bill at a meeting earlier this month, adding three sections to the SA’s finance bylaws – prohibited spending of SA and University funds, temporary funding policies and political activities.
Xu also said the finance committee has approved nearly $9,400 in co-sponsorships for nine student organizations in January leading up to this week. About $72,000, or 32 percent of the SA’s co-sponsorship fund, is still available for student organizations through the remainder of its term this semester.
Senators also confirmed junior Maram Baider to fill an open seat for the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences in the senate – the ninth empty seat left by senator resignations this term.
Baider, who transferred to GW earlier this year, said she plans to take on initiatives catered toward transfer and Muslim students, including plans to offer more inclusive food options to serve more students’ diets. She will serve on the undergraduate policy and student life committees.
“I want to help make educational transfer policy more transfer-friendly and make the transition process more easy,” Baider said. “I hope to serve in the student life committee to make sure that events we host are welcoming to everybody, and that includes offering halal options.”
Senators confirmed sophomore Benjamin Flaherty, an Air Force ROTC cadet majoring in political science, as assistant secretary of military affairs. Flaherty said he would work to give Army cadets better access to gyms in D.C. and to waive course fees charging Air Force cadets who take more than 18 credits per semester to fulfill degree and ROTC requirements.
He said he helped secure free transportation for ROTC cadets last semester through meetings with SA leadership, and he wants to continue that advocacy in his new position. The University started providing free transportation for Army and Air Force ROTC students enrolled in off-campus classes in August to decrease travel expenses after the SA advocated for the service.
“I would like to give our Army cadets better access to gyms, as we currently have the worst physical fitness scores in our consortium,” Flaherty said.
The next senate meeting will be held Feb. 7 at 8:30 p.m. in the Continental Ballroom in the University Student Center.

The 2022 Student Association elections will take place March 29 and 30, the Joint Elections Commission decided at a meeting Sunday night.
Students can register to run for president, vice president or senator between Feb. 28 and March 6, and eligible candidates can start campaigning March 10 at 9 a.m. The announcement of election results will take place March 31 at 5 p.m. at an undetermined location on campus, according to a Facebook post from the JEC, which oversees SA elections.
Students considering running for a position on the SA will need to attend one of the candidate information sessions Feb. 16, 24 or 27 before the registration period launches Feb. 28, according to the post.
The SA Senate passed legislation last year scaling back the minimum number of signatures required to run for office. SA presidential and vice-presidential candidates must now gather at least 1.5 percent of their constituency’s signatures, undergraduate senator candidates must collect one percent and all other candidates must compile .25 percent, according to the legislation.
The SA’s bylaws previously required 500 signatures for SA presidential and vice-presidential candidates to qualify for the ballot, 100 for Columbian College of Arts and Sciences candidates, 75 for Elliott School of International Affairs candidates, 50 for School of Business candidates and 20 for all others. Graduate senator candidates previously needed five signatures from their constituency to run for office before the change to percent quotas.
After a candidate gathers signatures for their petition, the JEC will verify the signatures and hold mandatory candidate meetings on March 8 and 9 for the official, verified candidates, according to the post.
JEC commissioners said the SA presidential and vice presidential debates will take place March 27. The post states that the time and location of these events will be announced at a later date.

SBA Sen. Garett May sponsored a bill to request GW Law Dean Dayna Bowen Matthew to submit an audit to disclose protocols that officials implemented or should establish to handle digital platform failures.
The Student Bar Association Senate rejected a bill at its meeting Tuesday to launch an audit examining online service outage protocol after GW Law’s “MyLaw” platform suffered a cyberattack last month.
Officials restored service on the MyLaw platform earlier this month after the outage disrupted law students’ final exams and potentially compromised information including GWIDs, course schedules, academic and degree programs, faculty office locations and office phone numbers in December. The Online Portal Outage Protocols Audit, which first-year law student and SBA Sen. Garett May sponsored, called on Law School Dean Dayna Bowen Matthew to submit an audit before spring final exams to disclose protocols that officials implemented or should establish to handle digital platform failures.
The senate failed to pass the bill with a minimum two-thirds majority because some senators found it “unnecessary” to request the audit in the form of legislation. Senators can usually pass legislation with a simple majority, but the two-thirds rule was in place because the bill was submitted to the senate past the deadline.
“The internet outage, as a result of a cyber attack, upended finals week for so many students as we all know, we were there,” May said at the meeting. “And this is trying to not so much pin down who to blame but just to answer questions that I, and I assume others, have, such as was there a plan in place before this happened, or what do we do when critical internet-hosted school infrastructure goes down?”
The University’s online time reporting system for employees, Kronos, also shut down after a second cyberattack potentially compromised employees’ information in mid-December.
Senators who opposed the bill said it demanded too much from the University, and the SBA could send officials an email to ask questions instead of urging them to release an audit.
SBA Sen. Pat Bruny said senators could send the questions through email because it would “facilitate dialogue” with administrators, like discussions he had with Matthew about the MyLaw outage in the wake of the cyber attacks last month. He said Matthew was open to talking about the situation, so he is unsure if the legislation was necessary.
“I don’t oppose it, but I’m still on the fence of whether or not this official bill was needed,” Bruny said.
The senate also passed a bill approving a survey that the senate will send to faculty and administrators for feedback on holding virtual or take-home exams next semester instead of the “traditional” in-person proctored model. The bill states that law students have grown accustomed to taking exams online and at home instead of during in-person class, and it asks faculty to share the testing formate that they prefer.
Senators also approved a nearly $300 ad hoc financial request to the Space Law Society, a student organization that promotes the discussion and expansion of space law. The Space Law Society will use these funds for three separate events, including a general body meeting, a career panel and a documentary night.
SBA President Jordan Michel said he vetoed the senate’s Spring 2022 Community Town Hall Act for the second time this month, rejecting plans to schedule at least one student-run town hall in the first four weeks of the spring semester for students to discuss “stories of struggle” at GW and policy suggestions for the SBA. He said he vetoed the bill again because “direct engagement and advocacy,” like holding office hours, is more effective than a town hall.
Senators voted to send the twice-vetoed bill back to the student life committee, where committee members will adjust its terms before reintroducing it to the senate at the next meeting.
The next SBA senate meeting will be Feb. 7 at 9:15 p.m.

The new Alexandria location is one of seven MFA primary care clinics scattered throughout the DMV area.
The Medical Faculty Associates opened a Primary Care Clinic in Alexandria earlier this month.
Michael Knight, the associate chief quality and population health officer, said the newest addition to the MFA community administers clinical services like chronic illness management and physical checkups to existing and new MFA patients. He said the clinic’s goal is to provide high-quality, equitable health services to patients in the DMV.
He said specialists in the MFA can assist patients who need specific care for illnesses and health issues in communities like Alexandria, and expand their clinical services beyond the MFA’s existing 25 locations in the region.
“As we continue to grow to meet the increasing demands for high quality care in our region, we selected Alexandria as one of our newest primary care locations to provide care for existing and future MFA patients who live in that community,” Knight said in an email.
Knight said the new clinic currently has one primary provider seeing patients, but the MFA expects to increase its services with additional providers in the coming months. He said the MFA plans to expand existing locations or add more primary and specialty practices to increase its clinical care services in the DMV.
The Alexandria location operates from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on the weekdays, and is one of seven primary care clinics that are scattered throughout the DMV area.
“We are committed to bringing world-class primary care to neighborhoods where our patients work, play and live,” Knight said.
