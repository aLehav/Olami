Hamdar said the research project is in its early stages because his team is currently collecting data from their simulations and preparing to integrate it into GW’s hardware and software.
A professor in the School of Engineering and Applied Science received a $140,000 grant last month to research artificial intelligence tools that can detect oncoming symptoms of health conditions in drivers.
Samer Hamdar, an associate professor of science and engineering and the director of the transportation engineering program in SEAS, received a grant from Moment AI, a technology company that develops systems to monitor drivers’ health irregularities on the road. He said his team will work to create an app that drivers can use to detect for oncoming signs of health conditions like strokes and epilepsy in themselves as well as autonomous driving technology to take control of the wheel after the health condition has been identified.
Megan Gray, the CEO of Moment AI, said the research is also focused on discovering how to use autonomous driving technology to maintain lane control for the driver and the car’s speed, something that researchers haven’t accomplished before.
“The detection of these disorders have not been done to the extent that we have done it, Dr. Hamdar and Movement AI, and that’s really where the difference is,” she said. “Dr. Hamdar has years of experience with [Advanced Driver Assistance Systems] technology, so with his past issues and our Moment Al technology, we believe we can build really great AI.”
Gray said by the end of the project, which will likely last about two years, she hopes to increase equity in transportation for people with conditions like epilepsy and strokes.
“That was one aspect is by being able to monitor these disorders we would allow more people to drive and therefore have access to work and increase the overall economy,” she said.
Hamdar said the research project is in its early stages because his team is currently collecting data from their simulations and preparing to integrate it into GW’s hardware and software.
“It is very important to reach out to all these communities that are disadvantaged in terms of accessibility and mobility,” Hamdar said.
Hamdar said his project will utilize simulating laboratories, which are maintained by the transportation engineering program in SEAS’ civil and environmental engineering department. Researchers can use the labs to automate vehicles and control the driving environments they’re attempting to simulate with computing screens and 3D projectors.
“You will be sitting in a car, you will be driving, in the environment that you choose,” he said. “And we can collect data related to the driver’s either fatigue or health-related issues, and that’s how we use a simulator.”
The research will provide accessibility to safe driving technologies for communities that have limited access to transportation because of underlying health conditions, Hamdar said. He added he was excited to work with Movement AI because of Gray’s “vision” to make transportation more accessible and equitable to a “very important” part of society.
Drivers with epilepsy are about one to two times more likely to get in a car crash behind the wheel than the general population, according to the Epilepsy Foundation.
Experts in engineering said the research could increase driving safety for those who experience health conditions that limit their ability to drive.
Ram Pendyala, the director of the School of Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment at Arizona State University, said this research may give a higher “degree of confidence” to drivers who suffer from health conditions because they will be able to rely on the technology to take over if something “catastrophic” were to happen. He added the research may even allow drivers who are more “homebound” to have the opportunity to travel safely.
“For those who have health challenges, the systems can take automated action or inform drivers, give them a greater sense of confidence, and therefore enhance mobility for those who are nervous about driving on their own currently,” Pendyala said.
Pendyala said simulator studies are “very commonly” used when researching transportation. The benefit of using simulation technology is that it allows researchers to perform large numbers of tests for scenarios and technologies that would be difficult to replicate in the real world, he said.
“A simulator-based study is very controlled,” he said. “You can do very controlled experiments. You can do statistically valid laboratory research that can give you more definitive results as to the effectiveness of a certain technology or intervention, with respect to understanding driver behavior under a wide variety of conditions.”
Susan Shaheen, an environmental engineering professor in-residence at the University of California, Berkeley, said this type of technology could lead to fewer crashes and deaths because the technology can detect for driving patterns, like drowsiness and fatigue, that lead to crashes.
“Drowsiness, driver fatigue and chronic fatigue are areas of research that have been applied to driving and AI,” Shaheen said. “Sensing and AI could become more standard in vehicle design and software. In the case of driver fatigue, advanced technologies could provide drivers with extra support.”
Shaheen said this research may extend to modes of transportation beyond driving and could potentially benefit air transportation by aiding airline crews during flights, who already utilize some automated technology.
“This research could benefit other modes of transportation, such as active transportation, by protecting other road users,” she said.

For many restaurants, health and safety meant closing down in-person dining and operating with a barebones crew for delivery and takeout.
Some eateries are now referred to as “ghost kitchens,” but don’t worry, they’re not haunted. 
Since the onset of the pandemic, many establishments have chosen to shut down their dining rooms and switch entirely to takeout and delivery service. With new COVID-19 variants becoming more and more prevalent, you may want to ditch your dinner plans and instead order from these “ghost” kitchens for takeout or delivery using apps like UberEats and Doordash. 
Here’s a rundown of restaurants where you can grab your meal to go:
Thamee
Eric Wang — the owner of D.C.’s only full-service Burmese restaurant — said that he has chosen to keep his dining room closed for the safety of his staff and customers.
“The only way we’ll fully open back up for dine-in services is when the vaccines are available to people of all ages and backgrounds in DC, and when all of our key staff members have completed their vaccinations,” Wang said in an email.
For now, you’ll have to settle for takeout and delivery from Thamee through UberEats, Grubhub and Doordash. For people afraid of spice, Burmese food is a great way to introduce yourself to southeast Asian flavors because of its milder ingredients, so be sure to try a bowl of delicious curry stew, like Thamee’s catfish Mohingar ($19). 
1320 H St. NW. Open from 4 to 8 p.m. Wednesday through Sunday.
Cane 
This Caribbean street food joint was known in pre-pandemic times for its small, narrow and intimate dining room where no reservations were ever taken. The chefs have elected to remain a takeout and delivery restaurant only for the time being, according to the restaurant’s website. You can order its mouth-watering jerk wings ($12) or grilled oxtail ($22) on Grubhub or UberEats.
403 H St. NE. Open for lunch Monday through Saturday 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. and dinner from 4 to 8 p.m., and until 9 p.m. on Friday and Saturday.
Ben’s Chili Bowl
Perhaps the backbone of D.C. cuisine, this nationally famous restaurant was recently featured in the History Channel’s #SaveOurRestaurants initiative – a philanthropic effort that highlight’s some of America’s historic eateries that have been impacted by the pandemic. While the Nationals and FedExField locations remain closed, you can order classics like the original half-smoke ($7.70) on UberEats, Grubhub and Doordash for pickup or delivery from the U Street or H Street locations.
1213 U St NW and 1001 H St. NE. Hours differ by location: Check here for details.
The Red Hen
An Italian-inspired restaurant using “mid-Atlantic bounty” according to the joint’s Instagram, this eatery will keep its dining room closed until further notice. Instead, you’ll need to download Toast for delivery or place an order for pickup on the restaurant’s website. Try The Red Hen’s pasta like its garganelli with Tusacn duck ragu ($21) or squid ink linguini ($19) that you can pair with one of their several wines from their extensive drinks menu.
1822 1st St. NW. Open from 5 to 8 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and until 9 p.m. Friday through Saturday. 
Timber Pizza Company
In addition to its food truck that you can often find at Foggy Bottom Market, you can order homemade pies from Timber Pizza Company’s Petworth location. The restaurant does not offer delivery, which means you’ll either have to call or use the pizza shop’s Square site – a takeout and payment service – to place your order. Timber Pizza Company’s pizza menu changes depending on the ingredients in season. For instance, the winter offerings currently include pizzas, like the “Green Monster” ($15.50) pie with pesto, kale and zucchini.
809 Upshur Street NW. Opens for dinner daily at 4 p.m. and weekend breakfast at 8 a.m. 
La Betty
If you’re looking for fusion comfort food, you’ll want to check out La Betty in Mount Vernon Triangle. La Betty was closed for much of 2020, but the chefs are back in business with a new menu optimally designed for takeout and delivery through Grubhub. There’s a subtle central American flare at La Betty, so don’t be surprised to find pupusas ($12) – a thick piece of stuffed flatbread similar to an arepa – alongside a chicken schnitzel sandwich ($14). 
420 K St. NW. Open from 5 to 9 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday.

Legacy admissions originated in the 1900s, when colleges and universities started to reward the families of their alumni in the hopes of donations. But over time, it became used to discriminate against Jewish and Catholic students. The process has evolved to favor White and wealthy students today.
Despite the negative implications of legacy admissions on students of color and low-income communities, many colleges and universities across the country continue to use the process. School administrators give preferential treatment to children of alumni who tend to be from wealthier families, and as a result, place those who are not related to alumni at a disadvantage. Legacy admissions is unfair, racist and classist and must end at the University and schools nationwide.
A decade ago, children of GW alumni were reported to be one and a half times more likely to be accepted than applicants who did not have a parent who attended the University. To this day, the University offers special programming, like information sessions and orientation activities, to new and prospective legacy students. Off the bat, officials should publicly disclose whether or not their admissions process still favors legacy applicants. But even the notion that legacy families have access to exclusive events is inherently elitist. GW must, like all other colleges and universities that engage in this discriminatory behavior, stop giving legacy students and their families the upper hand. There are a slew of other ways GW and other schools can bring in donations without leaning on wealthy alumni with college-aged kids.
About 42 percent of private colleges and universities considered legacy status in their admissions process, according to a 2018 survey by Inside Higher Ed. In a 2019 study, Inside Higher Ed found that children of alumni were more than three times more likely than non-legacy applicants to be admitted into some of the most selective institutions in the country. At Harvard University, the rate of acceptance for legacy applicants was more than five times higher than that of non-legacy applicants. These applicants are strongly preferred in the admissions process, making it more difficult for non-legacy students to be accepted. This means that a large portion of admissions spots are being filled by people who already had a leg up, excluding qualified applicants who may not have had the same privileged background.
Many students, at no fault of their own, do not have parents who attended the universities to which they are applying. An analysis of the racial and economic factors involved in the admissions process makes clear that these processes are not only just unfair, but also discriminatory against people of color, first generation students and people from lower-income communities. 
Only 27 percent of Black children and 21 percent of Hispanic children have a parent with a bachelor’s degree, compared to 53 percent of White students. It is far less likely for students of color who apply to college to have a parent that attended a university, and specifically the university to which they are applying, than White students. They are also less likely to benefit from the preferential treatment given to legacy students. Some have even referred to legacy admissions as affirmative action for White people. 
Aside from being a discriminatory practice, legacy admissions favors wealthier students and families. A study by the Institute for Higher Education Policy found that about half of the 2,000 institutions they analyzed were affordable only to the wealthiest students. Not only that, 54 percent of lower-income students attended college compared to nearly 70 percent of higher-income students. Already, lower-income families are less likely to be able to afford a college education. Giving such a large advantage in the admission process only to students whose parents could afford college hurts lower-income students and communities even more. 
Universities often defend their use of legacy admissions by arguing that it helps with donations, but this claim is largely unfounded. Studies have found there is no causal relationship between legacy preference and alumni donations. Accepting more legacy students will not necessarily result in increased donations, contrary to the arguments of universities that continue to honor this process. College officials concerned about donations need not rely on legacy admissions as a source of funding. 
While GW is currently trying to work on its diversity and inclusion efforts, they are simultaneously celebrating legacy students — students who have a leg up, come from privileged backgrounds and are more likely to be wealthy and white. Legacy admissions are a step back from their supposed goal. 
Continuing legacy admissions would perpetuate a racist and classist cycle, and universities – GW included – must stop considering this factor in their admissions decisions.

Hill touted achievements related to student refunds for dropped courses and Pass/No Pass policies as part of his record of listening to student voices. 
The current Student Association president became the first to announce his campaign for the SA’s top spot for the next term Tuesday.
SA President Brandon Hill – a junior who previously served as executive vice president and assumed the presidency last month – is running on a platform to improve course affordability, student inclusivity in governance and internal operations in the SA. Hill said he will work with members of the SA Senate and officials to help students regain stability following the COVID-19 pandemic and expand cultural resources on campus outside of the Multicultural Students Services Center.
“I think I am someone who doesn’t take myself too seriously and still takes the work I do seriously,” Hill said. “And that’s how you add personability to the work that we do and allow students to feel comfortable bringing issues to you and believing that you’ll actually act upon them, rather than them shouting into an empty hole.”
Hill is required to gather at least 250 signatures during the candidate registration period from Feb. 24 to March 3 and be approved by the Joint Elections Commission to qualify as a candidate. The senate approved legislation in November that cut the number of required signatures in half for candidates to run this year.
Hill said the relationships he has built with officials throughout his time in the SA will give him an advantage if elected as president because he “won’t have to start from the ground up.”
He said he has built a “super collaborative” relationship with Mark Diaz, the executive vice president and chief financial officer. He said they have worked together to advocate for financial policies for students in the past, like extending the timeline for when students can receive a refund after dropping a course.
“Having those powerful and strong relationships with administrators just makes it more of a collaborative effort rather than a fight,” Hill said.
Hill said in his three years in the SA, he served on the student engagement committee where he collected “anecdotal data” from students on the Mount Vernon Campus to gauge interest in providing lockers for those students on Foggy Bottom. He said as a Columbian College of Arts and Science senator, he established the Black Senators Caucus, which he said has sparked the creation of other caucuses in the body.
He said as the executive vice president, he worked with officials to increase the amount of refunds a student can receive if they drop a course and implement an optional Pass/No Pass policy for students during virtual instruction.
“I think these are all issues that have been driven by the students and for the students,” Hill said. “And they all start with students expressing concern or students raising their voices.”
Hill said he hopes to work with administrators to ensure financial support policies implemented due to the pandemic will remain in effect in the future. He said officials should continue to allow students to register for classes with an outstanding tuition balance of up to $2,500 instead of reverting back to a previous threshold of $1,000.
“The University has been doing some really positive things to impact the student experience,” Hill said. “They’ve been deemed as temporary, so I want to make sure that the University doesn’t rubber band back in terms of the financial policies that were implemented this year.”
He added that he plans to work with the financial aid office to move forward with creating an advisory board for students to collaborate on improvements to financial aid policies.
He said he intends to work with officials in the Office of Diversity, Equity and Community Engagement to create an Office of Spiritual Life as a partner for the Department of Business and Auxiliary Services. He said the office could examine GWorld vendors to create more cultural food options, be an outlet for students looking to explore more religious-based courses and allow them to receive spiritual guidance and counseling outside of the Colonial Health Center.
SA leaders worked with officials to expand the number of religious holiday accommodations for students, which were approved for the spring semester.
Hill said he is currently working with Provost Brian Blake to gather faculty input about a possible mandate that all course syllabi are posted to Blackboard before students register for courses. He said allowing students to gain access to syllabi before courses start will allow them to know what textbooks they need before classes begin, and Blake has expressed support for the policy.
Hill said if elected, he will prioritize increasing accessibility to buildings on campus for disabled students, which he said has been an ongoing issue before the pandemic started. He said he wants to continue to push the University to appoint an Americans with Disabilities Act compliance officer, which he said officials have yet to hire because of the University-wide hiring freeze and a lack of students on campus.
With a new SA constitution going into effect for the next term, Hill added that he will focus on ensuring the SA’s internal operations run efficiently. The new constitution, which students approved during last year’s elections, simplifies the language of operations for the executive, legislation and judicial branches.
He said the executive cabinet is not outlined in the updated constitution and therefore the new president will be able to “set a new precedent” in the executive branch. Hill said the president must know the “intention behind the constitution” to avoid “internal conflict” or potential lawsuits that could arise due to a lack of understanding of the governing documents.
He said he wants to create “the most robust cabinet in SA history” because the new constitution allows for the president to set the precedent of what the branch looks like. He said he plans to have an executive branch of 40 to 50 members, nearly double the number in previous years, to ensure SA leaders represent “as many students as possible.”
When Hill stepped in as SA president last month, he took over a cabinet that several students departed amid allegations that the former president fostered a “negligent and careless work environment.”
He said a “successful transition” after the election will require “extensive” knowledge of SA bylaws and the president’s position – knowledge he said he has gained through his current role as SA president and in serving on a committee that revised the SA constitution last year.
“My experience as president thus far will allow me to continue my current advocacy efforts without having to take the time to pause for a transition,” Hill said. “Students, at this moment, really can’t afford a transition process.”

Sunrise GW is a student organization dedicated to fighting the climate crisis. The following op-ed is an abridged version of a letter delivered to officials and the Board of Trustees last week.
One year ago, we wrote to you outlining the two primary ways GW was complicit in the climate crisis – its fossil fuel investments and its continued affiliation with the Regulatory Studies Center. At the end of June, thanks to the hard work of relentless student advocates, you committed GW to the most aggressive steps in the University’s history to combat the greatest crisis of our time. In committing to full divestment from fossil fuels, carbon neutrality by 2030 and reversing GW’s entire 200-year carbon footprint, you aligned with science and acknowledged the need for our society to transition off of fossil fuels as quickly as possible. Why, then, has the University continued to lend its name and credibility to climate deniers and efforts to deregulate the fossil fuel industry by harboring the RSC?
The problem starts at the top. During her time in then-President George W. Bush’s administration, RSC Founder and Director Susan Dudley was the official responsible for the suppression of a finding from her own administration’s Environmental Protection Agency scientists that greenhouse gas emissions pose a danger to human welfare. Dudley has a long history of advocating for increased emissions and downplaying the existential threat of climate change. She has argued that there are benefits to climate change, such as preventing the next ice age. She also once argued that smog is beneficial because its blocking of the sun can reduce skin cancer and cataracts. This type of advocacy work from Dudley and others at the RSC was described in a recent article as continuing “to harm the most vulnerable communities impacted by environmental racism.”
An issue that should be of utmost concern to the University is that Dudley has repeatedly used her position to elevate and lend credibility to climate deniers, fossil fuel cronies and other discredited backers of pseudoscience by allowing them to use GW’s name, despite a lack of affiliation with the institution. Among these individuals is Julian Morris, who wrote a public comment for the RSC on GW letterhead advocating for the rollback of the Obama-era fuel efficiency standards. Morris is a well-documented climate denier who “has called global warming a myth created by a coalition of self-interested scientists, governments and environmental groups.” This group also includes Richard Belzer, a former Exxon consultant, who has advocated that the EPA strike the finding that greenhouse gases pose a threat to human welfare. He made his intent to undermine climate science very clear: “The goal here is not to change the policy but to correct the science.” Dudley has also lent GW’s name and credibility to Tony Cox, yet another industry consultant and “fringe” scientist who has been paid to undermine science that could hurt his clients’ products. Cox is so discredited that even Bush’s Food and Drug Administration commissioner struck his testimony from proceedings. “The agency found that he ‘intentionally misquoted published articles,’ and ‘Dr. Cox’s credibility was such that his testimony was so unreliable that it was inadmissible,’” according to GW professor and former OSHA head David Michaels. These three examples are part of a long list of anti-science individuals that Dudley has allowed to trade on GW’s name and credibility through the vehicle of the RSC.
Even if you decide it is acceptable to house a center that uses GW’s name and credibility to elevate climate deniers and promote fossil fuel interests at the expense of your students’ futures, there are serious ethical concerns that the RSC must answer for. In 2018, 10 funding agreements for the Mercatus Center at George Mason University were released and showed clear violation of the norms of academic freedom by giving donors influence over hiring. Dudley was the director of the Regulatory Studies Program at the Mercatus Center while some of these practices were ongoing. In addition, three of these 10 norm-violating agreements were with the Koch Foundation, including one from 2009, the same year the RSC was founded. Other RSC donors have been found in violation of the principles of academic freedom in the past as well. It is reasonable to ask if RSC funding agreements with the Koch Foundation (or any donor) from the same era similarly violated the norms of academic freedom. Part of the reason these practices have potentially been allowed to permeate the University is because GW lacks an institutional conflict of interest policy and does not mandate its centers and departments to disclose funding or terms of funding agreements.
With its historic commitments in June, GW has the opportunity to be one of the nation’s leaders in combating climate change. Unfortunately, when you look the other way as climate deniers, fossil fuel cronies and discredited backers of pseudoscience trade on GW’s name and credibility, you undermine your positive actions at every turn. Time is running out before the planet blows past the warming targets set in the Paris Agreement, to which GW claims to be committed. The fossil fuel industry is fighting tooth and nail to delay any action that hurts their bottom line, even right here at GW. Which side are you on?

GW joins nine of its peers in conducting a school-wide probe of diversity at the institution. 
Updated: Feb. 16, 2021 at 2:07 p.m.
Experts said the University-wide external diversity audit officials announced late last month could lead to campus-wide improvements in diversity and inclusion if it can effectively reveal both GW’s strengths and weaknesses.
Administrators said they will use the findings to create an action plan to improve GW’s financial aid policies, the GW Police Department’s interactions with staff and students and diversity in the University’s hiring practices. Experts in diversity in higher education said a diversity audit can provide data about GW’s potential shortcomings to help officials choose where they need to allocate the most resources needed to address issues of diversity, equity and inclusion.
“This independent evaluation will be a critical step in informing our efforts moving forward,” the email announcing the audit states. “Based on the findings of the audit, the University will develop a diversity action plan that includes goals, action items and regular assessments to track our progress both on campus and within the broader D.C. area.”
Nine of GW’s 12 peer schools, like Syracuse University and the University of Rochester, have conducted a university-wide pulse or temperature surveys to gauge student and faculty opinion on diversity within the schools. Other institutions, like New York University, have implemented similar diversity assessments using third-party audits to improve campus climate.
Officials said in late January they would complete the audit by late spring and will use the “coming weeks” to find an external party to conduct the audit.
Lisa Coleman, the chief diversity officer at NYU, said administrators implemented an assessment called “Being@NYU” in 2017 to assess diversity, inclusion, equity and belonging by surveying students, faculty and staff across all of NYU’s campuses globally.
She said officials hired three external firms – Rankin and Associates, Helios Data and the Center for Diversity Education and Inclusion at the University of Maryland – to conduct the survey and report the findings to the institution.
“If you are going to hire an external company or organization, make sure that it maps onto whatever your organization is,” she said. “I might not have hired that same organization if I were at a liberal arts school, a small school.”
Coleman said GW officials should not approach the diversity audit “looking for problems” but searching for goals.
“If you go looking for problems, that’s what you’ll find,” she said. “We went looking for ‘What do we want to be? Who do we want to be?’ And that’s the name of the assessment. ‘Who do we want to be together? Who do we want to be as we imagine our community?’”
Coleman said the assessment found overwhelmingly “positive” results and highlighted key areas of improvement, with 83 percent positive responses and 17 percent negative. She said NYU officials developed 12 “themes,” or areas of development based on the negative responses, with three committees to tackle the 12 areas.
She said the assessment also allowed NYU officials to localize the negative responses to specific departments and “borrow” successful practices from some departments and apply them to others lacking in mentorship or innovation. Officials were able to identify exclusionary conduct, problems with program recruitment and retention discrepancies in the climate assessment, she said.
“Think about faculty diversification as an asset,” Coleman said. “When we are thinking of hiring policies, far too often the approach is, we are solving a problem and that’s why we are hiring. But I think it has to be, we are trying to build the best faculty and excellence.”
Faculty members have recently been calling for officials to hire more diverse faculty at GW. An informal group of department chairs and program directors began circulating a petition earlier this month calling for officials to implement a “cluster hire” of underrepresented faculty members.
Prior to the audit, officials have also engaged in other diversity initiatives like implementing GW’s first-ever online diversity training in February 2018 and initiating a series of annual trainings during freshman orientation in 2018.
Ron Idoko, the diversity and multicultural program manager at the University of Pittsburgh, said Pitt has conducted several “climate assessments,” both campus-wide and program-specific. He said these surveys try to assess feelings of inclusion on campus from both students and faculty to find identity groups who “may require more engagement.”
GW officials conducted a campus climate survey to assess inclusivity on campus in 2015 and conducted a similar campus climate survey on unwanted sexual behavior in 2018.
“It’s not always easy to reflect on what the current challenges are of certain groups – we don’t gain direct feedback,” Idoko said. “So the assessments are more meant to be feedback from these different groups so we can understand how we work to make this campus as welcoming or as inclusive as possible.”
Idoko said past assessments Pitt conducted found a need for introducing mentoring programs for some students’ prospective fields, hiring more faculty from diverse backgrounds and adding multicultural programs to “uplift” certain identities and equal restroom access for all gender identities – something GW students have pushed for in the past.
He said the way institutions “frame” these assessments is key for a successful audit. He said with GW’s audit, administrators should be prepared to act on the data that comes out of it regardless of if the results are overwhelmingly positive or negative.
“There are always ways we can improve and so we should have an open mind with the data that is provided via these assessments,” Idoko said. “Recognizing that if it doesn’t tell the best story, that you have an opportunity to improve upon the services and the environment that you foster.”

In his first year, SMPA Director Silvio Waisbord's priorities have included bolstering diversity efforts and keeping the SMPA community intact virtually.
As the University was gripped by the COVID-19 pandemic, Silvio Waisbord was just stepping into his role leading the School of Media and Public Affairs.
Waisbord, who previously served as SMPA’s associate director, said he initially agreed to take the position for one academic year until officials could conduct a full external search for a long-term director. But after the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic and a University-wide hiring freeze, Waisbord said he agreed to remain in the role for an additional year while GW continues to respond to the academic and communal effects of the virus.
“To me, it was a great opportunity to contribute to the school, to continue to raise the profile of the school and provide opportunities for students,” Waisbord said. “I strongly believe in everything that SMPA has done, so that’s why I wanted to do it.”
Waisbord replaced former SMPA Director Frank Sesno, who served in the role for about a decade.
In his first year, he said he prioritized maintaining relationships with students and faculty, especially in light of the pandemic. Waisbord added that he has encouraged professors to integrate diverse course materials into their curricula and hired a diverse group of faculty.
Tackling remote learning 
In his first semester as director, Waisbord said the largest challenge he’s faced has been overseeing the implementation of virtual teaching methods, which included restructuring course content, readings and assignments to fit an online platform.
He said SMPA officials sent a survey to students over the summer to gather their feedback from the spring 2020 virtual semester in preparation for the “technology needs and situations” of the coming fall semester. The survey asked students about their experience with virtual classes last spring.
Waisbord added that while he understands school members may be “maxed out” during the pandemic, he asked faculty to carve out time to provide feedback about how the school could improve.
Waisbord also said he communicates with members of the National Council for Media and Public Affairs – an advisory board made up of alumni and “friends” – about ideas to improve the school’s areas like philanthropic and internship opportunities for students.
“My job is basically always inviting and encouraging people to reach out and let me know what it is that we can do – what we can do better,” he said. “That’s the way that I see myself as a manager is not something that I decided on my own. It’s informed by what I hear.”
Improving diversity
Waisbord said increasing SMPA’s faculty diversity is an “obvious” goal but how to effectively achieve that goal is more complex. He said one approach could be recruiting officials in SMPA to develop contacts with fellow schools, newsrooms and media organizations with employees who might be interested in teaching full time or part time at GW.
SMPA administrators established a student-led diversity task force in 2016 to suggest ideas to increase diversity in the school.
School officials have also hosted virtual events regarding the topic of race, like a conversation in October about the role of the media during Black Lives Matter protests last summer.
He said SMPA professors should incorporate resources like diverse readings, materials or podcasts in course syllabi to appeal to all “experiences and interests” to support students’ community engagement.
Waisbord said the feeling of belonging has always been central to him because of his background as a first-generation student and immigrant, and he understands that each student’s experience at GW will differ based on their background.
“That to me is central to the way that we make everybody – faculty, staff and particularly students – feel included in our school,” he said. “Then it’s a question of what we teach.”
He said he has found an advantage in virtual learning in that faculty can more easily bring in speakers with “different experiences and backgrounds” from around the world. He said he has pressed professors to seek guest speakers and has planned conversations with faculty about fostering diversity in the materials taught in the classroom.
“You have to be creative as an instructor in how you foster creativity, how you foster diversity of voices in the classroom – not just among students but what students are exposed to the materials,” Waisbord said.
He said he facilitated a survey at the beginning of the year regarding diversity and inclusion in SMPA to gauge students’ feedback about the issue.
“It’s always important to have formal and informal opportunities for students to express themselves, and with my colleagues, I said ‘I’m always available. If you have any ideas, please let me know,'” he said.
Engaging the SMPA community
Waisbord said he has met monthly with SMPA’s Student Advisory Board – a student group that provides feedback to SMPA officials – to hear comments and ideas that help shape students’ experiences. He said the meetings are “very important,” especially in a virtual environment, for students to provide suggestions, even as small as updating a website, on issues officials may not be aware of.
“It is good to have these opportunities for a free-flowing conversation,” Waisbord said.
He said settings like “lunchtime chats” with faculty and students and “informal conversations” every other week have helped create a community for students, especially for freshmen living on campus.
“Regardless of how many people showed up, it’s a good opportunity for people to know and symbolically sends a very powerful message that we are active, that we are here and that we want to hear from you,” Waisbord said.
He said no matter in what capacity students are back on campus in the fall, his first priority will be to “celebrate” everyone’s return. Waisbord said he will also prioritize figuring out what strategies the community used well during the pandemic and finding ways to potentially implement them for the future.
“I anticipate that we’ll have to stay creative and innovative and quick on our feet to think about how we transition back to something that probably, at least in the fall, will not be exactly what we had before the pandemic,” Waisbord said. “That’s my to-do list probably toward the end of the spring and during the summer.”

The upside of remote instruction for some students has included the ability to earn extra income on the side with jobs or to catch up on missed lectures via video recordings.
With extra time on their hands, students said they are taking advantage of their relatively open schedules by enrolling in more courses, conducting research and working full time. 
While some students have felt low morale and productivity as online instruction continues, others said the virtual learning has allowed them to be more flexible with their time because they do not have to commute to classes or schedule their courses around a job. In interviews, seven students said they have felt themselves perform more efficiently in classes and are focusing on professional opportunities like full-time internships and course loads.
Senior Tess Peterson, a political communication major living in D.C., said she accepted a part-time nannying job last semester while taking five courses. She said she cut down on time because she doesn’t have to commute to Foggy Bottom for classes.
“A lot of seniors in their second semester try to get full-time positions just to fill up the time,” Peterson said. “I’m not somebody that does well with idle time. I really needed something to do and the family that I’m working for now was really ready and willing to accommodate whatever class obligations I had, and so we just worked out a schedule that works for everybody.”
Peterson said she would not have been able to accept a full-time position if she were taking in-person classes this semester, and she is grateful for the flexibility of an online schedule. She said taking care of a seven-month-old has helped her mental health because her job does not require her to focus on daily news coverage as she would in an internship.
She added that nannying has been “great” because she gets paid full time, which is not guaranteed at an entry-level job or internship.
“There’s a lot of unpaid internship culture within GW, and obviously what I’m doing now is not an unpaid internship,” Peterson said. “But I think the idea of having a more real job was more appealing to me with all this time that I had, and especially one that was so caring and thoughtful.”
Junior Mark Thomas-Patterson, a history major living off campus, said he took five courses last semester in addition to beginning an independent study on foreign relations, which he had more time to dedicate to researching. He said the extra free time during the pandemic allowed him to take on the independent study.
He said he is taking four courses this semester and is continuing his independent study so he can spend more time preparing to apply to graduate school. He said the “biggest” challenge this semester has been not being able to interview people in person and find physical copies of archived sources in Gelman Library for his research.
“There’s a big issue of finding sources, so I have to do research projects that I can do with available online primary sources,” Thomas-Patterson said. “I am a lot better off than a lot of other people. I still have challenges, but they’ve been relatively small and I’ve done some really interesting research.”
Sophomore Michael Martineau, an international affairs major living in Allentown, Pennsylvania, said his grades have improved while attending classes virtually because he had more time to focus on his studies and enjoy learning the material. He said he began to research graduate programs in his spare time, which he said surprised him after a “rough” first year academically at GW.
He said he decided to challenge himself and take a full course load last semester because of virtual instruction, which he otherwise would not have during normal times. He said it was only after offhandedly taking an elective on the philosophy of human rights because of online learning that he found what he wanted to concentrate in.
“It’s not without its challenges, but last time I took a full 18 credits,” Martineau said. “I don’t have to worry about walking to classes or walking to [GW] Deli to feed myself as I eat here at home or when I take classes. So I definitely had a lot more time to focus on studies.”
Martineau added that he has begun to take more challenging courses in his concentration to stand out among his peers when he applies for graduate programs, which he has more time to plan and look into.
“I wasn’t too interested,” Martineau said. “And then since the pandemic, I was getting a lot better grades and into some good material in my classes. And I feel like I’ve missed out on some college experiences, and part of the decision was, I want to gain some of that back during grad school.”
Junior Emma Sauder, an international affairs and history major living off campus, said she originally planned to take her required international economics course over the summer at a local city college. Instead, she decided to take the economics course and two writing-intensive courses this semester because she had more time during the day to work on assignments, she said.
“I like that lectures are recorded, just because it makes it a lot easier for me to go back and watch it at my own pace,” Sauder said. “If there’s material I don’t understand, along with having the options to go to office hours or the TA, I also can rewatch what’s originally taught, which makes it a lot more simplified and easier to understand.”
