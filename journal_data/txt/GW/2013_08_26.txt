Higher education experts are casting doubt on the Obama administration’s highly publicized proposal last week to link financial aid funds to colleges’ academic performances.
The proposal, which Obama announced Thursday at the University of Buffalo, would rank colleges based on factors such as student debt, graduation rates, tuition and graduate’s earnings as well as low-income student enrollment. But experts such as Sandy Baum, a senior fellow in GW’s Graduate School of Education and Human Development, said they are concerned by the lack of details released about the system.
Baum said she had too many questions about the methodology, and did not expect it to materialize.
“It’s not like somebody has come up with, ‘here is a list of the factors we will consider. Here is how each of those factors will be measured and here is how they will be rated,'” she said.
The proposal, which would disburse less student aid funds to universities that falter in the rankings, also does not explain how students with financial need would be protected if the federal government withheld funds to their colleges. If Congress approves the proposal, the government would dole out financial aid based on the value scores as early as 2018.
If a college fails to graduate enough low-income students, for example, it could lose Pell Grant funds under the president’s plan, Baum said, which could impact most college students who attend state universities.
“That just doesn’t make any sense at all,” Baum, who is also a senior College Board analyst, said. “So if you live in a state with lousy state colleges, then we’re going to give you lower Pell Grant awards?”
But Baum said the proposal is not targeted at institutions like GW because the nation’s top schools already dole out massive amounts of financial aid.
University President Steven Knapp, who praised the plan, said he was also pleased that Obama will seek feedback from university presidents.
“Affordability, access, and student success – both while our students are here and after they graduate – are issues about which I care deeply,” Knapp said in an email.
Knapp touted the University’s commitment to increasing financial aid, boosting career resources and freeing up existing University funds for academic programs as consistent with the president’s goals.
But Knapp said that he could not address specific questions about the plan’s impact on GW until more details are released.
Despite the scant details, the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities’ Vice President for Government Affairs Sarah Flanagan said the proposal threatens to change the nature of federal aid allocation.
While she supports the idea of creating incentives and making universities reconsider the depth of their commitment to student aid, Flanagan said the initiative may not in fact “empower” students looking for an affordable education.
“I’m very worried about changing it from student aid to something based on institutional behavior,” Flanagan said. “That’s what the president is implying.”

Updated on Aug. 29 at 2:40 p.m.
A facilities worker filed a lawsuit against GW last week, claiming his supervisor refused to work with black employees and restricted their opportunities for pay increases – a complaint he says the University has ignored for more than a year.
Carl McArthur, a mechanic who has worked at GW for nearly three decades, accused his supervisor, Robert Oakley, of discrimination against black employees and for repeatedly foiling his chances for promotion.
He said Oakley, who is white, once “embarrassed and humiliated” him without cause, according to D.C. Superior Court documents filed Aug. 15. The mechanic also alleged that his supervisor denied black employees in Facilities Services’ heating, ventilation and air conditioning department more “desirable” overtime assignments.
Daniel Kozma, McArthur’s attorney, wrote in an email that he and his client were “in settlement discussions” with GW, and he had not yet served the complaint.
GW promoted Oakley to supervisor in 2005, a position McArthur claims he was more qualified to fill. McArthur also says that Oakley’s direct superior is black, but instead he opts to report to a white supervisor.
In the lawsuit, McArthur demands compensation for lost wages and punitive damages because he alleged Oakley prevented him from receiving promotions multiple times, though his credentials were better than other candidates’. He asserts Oakley most often assigned black employees to duties that were “little more than changing filters,” cleaning and polishing, according to the court documents.
Kozma declined to comment on the exact amount for which McArthur is suing for damages.
McArthur also said a Human Resources committee in June 2012 found “management’s interactions with employees inconsistent with the University’s standard and fair hiring practices,” according to the documents. McArthur filed the grievance with GW, alleging Oakley denied him the opportunity to apply for a higher position.
But McArthur contends the University did not follow up on the finding. He has maintained the same job since 1991 and alleges he has not been able to apply for a position two pay grades above his current salary.
University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard said she was unable to provide a comment before publication time.
D.C. Superior Court has scheduled an initial conference for Nov. 22 to address the claim.

The latest administrative debacle to hit GW, which unfolded last week, becomes more disgraceful with each thread you untangle.
The GW School of Business’ $13 million of overspending last year forced a budget standoff between Dean Doug Guthrie and Provost Steven Lerman to decide next year’s spending limit. To break the stalemate, the University kicked Guthrie out of his roles as both business school dean and vice president for China operations, Lerman told The Hatchet Friday.
The abrupt change, which surprised students, faculty and administrators, will likely stall the lofty goals of the business school and the University at large. And while it’s reassuring that Lerman was transparent about the situation that led to Guthrie’s firing, this mismanagement and poor leadership is especially unfortunate for students, who entrust University leaders with enhancing GW’s reputation and academic stature.
Taking GW off track
GW administrators constantly tout the University’s upward trajectory and claim that the school is “investing in itself.” But those investments – and tuition dollars – are wasted when University leaders can’t get their act together and engage in basic compromises.
Guthrie had his hands on several issues vital to GW’s progress, like development in China and cross-disciplinary studies. The money and institutional energy devoted to these causes are partially squandered when key leadership changes cause turbulence.
Granted, the business school will have an interim dean until a permanent one is hired, but this role will largely be a placeholder. Schools need full, confident leaders in order to hire star professors, court donors and set an academic vision.
And when it comes to online and executive education – two major areas where Guthrie overextended and overspent – the damage is done.
Administrators must remember that the University is not innovating in a vacuum. Everything that GW does is relative to the work of other universities, many of which are developing new programs in the same areas. That stalled progress now keeps GW further behind as other schools charge forward.
Guthrie’s financial mistake undercuts the legacy of his three-year deanship, which showed promise because of his forward thinking and high standards for faculty.
But the administrative issues did not come out of nowhere. Under his tenure, the school faced issues of staffing turnover and faculty discontent.
Over the past two years, the business school also saw a steady slip in its rankings. While many deride these lists as irrelevant, a school’s standing has real effects for alumni. A college’s prestige and name recognition matters to potential employers, especially to those of business graduates.
Problems run deeper
The issues at the business school are disappointing. But at GW as a whole, the problems seems to run deeper. This $13 million mistake is only the latest failure.
University President Steven Knapp’s six-year tenure has been marred by a series of high-profile turnovers, with  many stemming from seemingly preventable political gripes and communication disagreements between administrators, deans and faculty.
This is an alarming trend.
The business school joins the GW Law School as another prestigious – and lucrative – college at GW without complete administrative guidance. The lack of stability puts at risk these schools’ ability to generate much-needed revenue and added prestige for the University.
And it’s head-scratching that Lerman and other top administrators could not compromise on a business school budget for next year without resorting to firing the college’s leader. While Guthrie made the major misstep here, Knapp and Lerman deserve some blame for failing to resolve the situation without putting the future of the entire school off track.
If leaders are incapable of basic communication skills, such as listening to advice from others and coming to mutual agreements on issues like spending money, then progress at the University will continue to hit major roadblocks.

As GW rolls out its smoke-free campus policy this fall, it follows suit of colleges nationwide that are mostly ignoring the question of how to enforce their smoking bans.
More than 1,000 colleges now prohibit smokers from lighting up in campus spaces, though most administrations, including GW’s, stress that they’re seeking to create a “culture change” through peer education rather than punishments.
However, there are exceptions. Tulane University slaps violators with a $25 fine – even visitors – while the University of Illinois at Chicago will mark students’ records if they are caught smoking multiple times.
GW’s policy largely delegates enforcement to the University community, though officials said repeat offenders will be sent to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities, Human Resources or the Office of the Provost.
University police officers will also remind passersby of the ban by passing out literature to students, faculty and staff they see smoking.
“I don’t necessarily think we’re going to tell people, every time you see somebody, tap them on the shoulder. It’s just not reasonable,” said Peter Konwerski, senior associate provost and dean of student affairs.
Reginald Fennell, a health professor at Miami University of Ohio who has studied campus smoke-free policies, said policies are typically ineffective without “clearly defined” enforcement. He recommended that violators be fined as much as $100, which could be used to fund health programs.
But Konwerski said enforcement is not the University’s top priority and highlighted the difficulty of enforcement at an urban campus like GW’s, where “you don’t know who’s part of the community.”
“At the end of the day, I don’t think [UPD is] looking to go around and catch people smoking. It’s not practical for them,” Konwerski said. “There’s more important security and security things that they need to be doing, and I think we all recognize that.”
What approaches do other universities take?
*New York University has sought to balance enforcement with education since instituting its smoke-free policy in 2010.
The policy warns of disciplinary action for violators, but school officials say NYU relies on “peer discipline” to enforce the ban.
“We don’t want to be perceived as a police state. There are no fines,” Assistant Dean for Communications and Public Affairs Elyse Bloom said. “We want to treat everyone in the community like the adults they are.”
Bloom said students or administrators may tell community members to stop smoking on campus, but suggested “exceptions” to the protocol when they do not listen.
*Boston University Medical Campus banned smoking after the Boston Health Commission launched a smoke-free campaign in November 2011, though there are no plans for Boston University as a whole to go smoke-free.
Officials patrol the campus grounds frequently during “smoking rounds” and ask smokers to stomp out their cigarettes, said Maria Pantages Ober, director of communications for the medical campus.
She added that while students abide by the ban, the hospital’s patients are less compliant.
“For the most part, it has been successful,” she said. “We have instituted different areas at both ends of the campus where if we do see people smoking, we direct them to those areas.”
*Tulane University, which is set to go smoke-free in 2014, plans to empower campus police officers to fine offenders $25 per offense.
The ban comes six years after an earlier attempt to ban smoking, which created designated smoking zones. Scott Tims, the director for wellness and health promotion at Tulane, said the policy failed then because smokers were unclear of “what they could and could not do.”
He also said that the $25 fine is fair for visitors because the public streets that run close to campus will make it “easier” for them to smoke if they choose to.
*University of Florida outlined strict disciplinary action for its students, faculty and staff, but the school’s 4 million visitors per year don’t not face any type of penalty.
Student offenders face the student judiciary committee, and faculty that continuously violate the ban can be fired.
The university’s Director of Campus Outreach, Florida Bridgewater-Alford, said it decided to rely on word-of-mouth and a “heavily charged” public relations campaign to enforce the policy.
“We also use peer pressure with our students and faculty and staff,” she said. “So if they see someone violating the policy, they will feel empowered and encouraged to at least educate that person on how the University of Florida is tobacco-free.”

One month after GW banned smoking on campus, University employees most impacted by the policy say they have been told little about how it will be enforced.
When asked about the policy, about a half-dozen dining and facilities workers said they believed violators of the policy would face consequences as harsh as dismissal from GW.
“We’re hearing rumors from coworkers, but not from the proper authorities,” Leondre Edwards, a campus groundskeeper, said. “It needs to be put in writing so that all employees know.”
The head of GW’s Human Resources office said the rumors were untrue. But none of the workers interviewed said they’d received official notice from department about the policy, and one employee, Thomas Lavender, said his supervisors told him violators could be suspended or fired after multiple offenses.
Sabrina Ellis, vice president of human resources, denied the existence of a “three-strike policy,” but did not outline specific consequences for policy violators. She said those who continue smoking will be provided with additional policy materials and resources at the end of the policy’s two-month roll out.
“For those that continue to smoke on campus, we will apply a progressive approach through our administrative and disciplinary process,” Ellis said in an email. “It is not our goal to get smokers in trouble.”
GW has made quitting resources – such as counseling, patches and gum – available to students, faculty and staff. Low-income workers are statistically more likely to smoke, according to a nationwide survey by Gallup in 2009: three-quarters of smokers earn less than $60,000 and 53 percent earn less than $36,000.
So far, 27 University employees have signed up for the Quit for Life program GW is offering through the American Cancer Society.
Everson Guerrier, a University groundskeeper and 20-year smoker, said the ban is helping him cut down.
“I suck on lollipops more often now,” Guerrier said. “If I’m thinking, ‘I need the nicotine,’ let me just pop a lollipop and that just stops the craving.”
But without a consistent message about the ban’s impacts, an advocate for tobacco-free policies said the community may ignore it.
“You have to educate and take time and build support and just dropping a policy on an organization immediately raises the question: what will be the consequence?” said Ty Patterson, executive director of the National Center for Tobacco Policy.
Patterson, who has helped urban schools like City University of New York enforce smoking bans, also said administrators are more likely to see a campus culture change if the University explains the health and environmental impacts of tobacco.
Some employees, such as Edwards, added that they weren’t sure how GW officials could enforce the policy – or if they would even try because of the public streets and sidewalks cutting across campus.
“I’m not sure they are going to enforce it and I don’t see how they can enforce it,” Edwards said. “You have public streets, you have public sidewalks, so how can you enforce it?”

Correction appended
Donations to the University dropped for the first time in five years, just as GW prepares to launch its largest fundraising campaign to date.
The University raised $103 million over the last fiscal year, a 14 percent decline from last year’s record fundraising haul, which included one of the biggest gifts in GW’s history.
It is the first decline under Vice President for Development and Alumni Relations Mike Morsberger, who has grown GW’s fundraising staff by 30 percent since he came aboard in 2010. The number of staffers tripled between 2005 and 2009.
Morsberger attributed the decrease to an inflated total last year, when the University tallied a $25 million donation to establish the GW Museum and the Textile Museum, bringing the total fundraising to $120 million.
“It’s a rather extraordinary gift and an extraordinary partnership. We don’t expect those every year,” Morsberger said. “We’re always gunning for big gifts and I’m always hoping that we break a record again, but we feel pretty good about the $103 million.”
The rate of fundraising began to slow during fiscal year 2012, after two years of double-digit growth.
Both the 2012 and 2013 fundraising totals will count as part of the University’s massive years-long fundraising campaign, which will likely be launched within the next year. That heavy fundraising will support GW’s 10-year strategic plan, which was approved in May.
GW’s total this year is less than what the Council for Advancement and Support of Education’s Fundraising Index projected schools nationwide would see. It estimated schools would see a 7.1 percent growth from the year before.
But Lee Gardner, a senior editor at the Chronicle of Higher Education who covers finance, said while fundraising totals are on the rise nationally, GW’s drop is “not to the degree that it’s concerning.” He also said one-time gifts make it difficult to compare school’s fundraising totals from year to year because they “skew” totals.
“A big gift will make you seem like you have a great year, but if you do well all things considered but don’t have an enormous gift, you still may have done well, but not as well,” Gardner said. “While no one wants to turn down a large gift, it can make other years look more feeble in comparison.”
University President Steven Knapp has made fundraising a priority since he arrived in 2007, tying deans’ job performances to pulling in donor dollars. Donations more than doubled last year from Knapp’s first year when total donations totaled a paltry $58 million.
But compared to other institutions, which have spent decades building up its fundraising base, particularly among alumni, GW’s fundraising rates are far behind.
The year also brought some good news for GW’s fundraising team.
Patty Danver, a spokeswoman in the Division of Development and Alumni Relations, added that the number of parents who donated to GW nearly tripled after the office increased visits and mailings to students’ families. Staffers also targeted parents based on region.
GW officials and staff members also took 5,500 donor visits, about a 27 percent increase from the year before, Danver said.
The amount of money raised from annual gifts also increased by $2 million, reaching an all-time high at $12.8 million in annual gifts.
Morsberger also noted that total gifts in cash was up this year by $10 million dollars, which is an 18 percent increase from fiscal year 2012. He attributed the $85 million in cash on hand mainly to people paying off commitments more quickly.
This article was updated Aug. 26 at 12:02 p.m. to reflect the following:
Due to an editing error, The Hatchet incorrectly reported that fundraising staff tripled since Mike Morsberger arrived at GW in 2010. In fact, it tripled during the four years before he arrived and only increased by 30 percent since he was hired.

Marijuana smokers in the District could get more legal leeway soon – but that’s not something to cheer about.
D.C. already makes marijuana legal for residents with medical prescriptions. The first legally sanctioned medical marijuana sale happened about three weeks ago at Capital City Care, a new dispensary merely blocks away from the Capitol and Drug Enforcement Administration buildings.
Now, D.C. Council member Tommy Wells, D-Ward 6, is pushing a bill that would decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana for citizens of the city. A majority of legislators said this summer that they would support this bill.
And on the surface, it seems like many GW students would support decriminalization. Marijuana is illegal under federal law, but about 30 percent of college students have smoked weed in the past year, according to a recent survey by Core Institute at Southern Illinois University.
But enacting looser laws on marijuana use in the District would have serious economic and social consequences.
I spent the majority of my summer in Denver – a city in a state perhaps best known for winter sports and weed. Walking around downtown, the smell of marijuana was almost always overwhelming. Weed is legal there for recreational purposes, regulated like alcohol and available for purchase to people 21 and over.
Residents’ newfound liberties took their toll on me. Eating in restaurants with stoned workers made ordering food frustrating. It was so outrageous that I found myself saying, “The fact that I don’t want lettuce on my cheeseburger is not the funniest thing in the world. Please stop laughing.”
Of course, I can empathize with other students who want marijuana legalized. I’m from Austin, Texas, another city known for its perpetual Woodstock vibe. Half of my graduating class’ research papers argued for marijuana legalization, and many of them were no strangers to every form of ingestion. I was constantly updated on the latest and so-called greatest waterfall bongs, vaporizers, pipes, joints, edibles and strains. You name it, they used it.
But I’ve seen firsthand these same friends lose their motivation. The subject of their paper, not actually writing the essay itself, became their priority. This laziness by excessive marijuana users was pervasive. I can only imagine what it would have been like had marijuana been legalized in Austin, making it even easier to access.
Proponents of medical marijuana – most recently, CNN’s Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta – argue that it has legitimate uses. And others say that D.C.’s medical marijuana regulations are stringent, and that marijuana will only be provided to individuals with certain specific and otherwise incurable illnesses.
But even if that’s so, this national debate, which has now made its way to the District, has established a dangerous precedent – a slippery slope.
Do we want D.C. – the center of American politics and policymaking – to turn into Austin or Denver? I don’t think so.

Two weeks after summer residents called out GW for what they called unsanitary conditions in residence halls, the housing office released a “Bill of Rights” Friday for students living on campus.
The list promises that the University will provide a clean room before a resident arrives and will respond to FIXit requests “within a reasonable time,” giving priority to emergencies. The second half of the letter calls on residents to keep up their rooms by taking out trash and to prevent mold or mildew by cleaning their bathrooms.
Over the weekend, the University emailed the Bill of Rights to all students who live on campus. Dean of Student Affairs Peter Konwerski said in an email that the document was sent in response to recent news coverage of a damning Facebook page called “GW Housing Horrors.”
Konwerski said the Residence Hall Association and the Student Association helped craft the document, which was based on discussions with students, interns, staff and administrators after a string of complaints about residence halls.
The list is an effort “to communicate more clearly what our residents can expect of us and also serves to reiterate the part residents play in maintaining our high quality residential communities,” Konwerski said, adding that the list is similar to what hospitality industry offer their guests.
Student complaints about mold, crumbling ceilings and filthy appliances in a residence halls like The Aston and JBKO Hall went viral among national, and even international, news outlets this month. GW often touts the quality of its residence hall rooms, which placed No. 10 on the Princeton Review’s “Best College Dorms” list.
The University has also racked up complaints about conditions in Mitchell and Fulbright halls and the Hall on Virginia Avenue over the years.
Shortly after the media coverage of the most recent residence hall complaints, GW announced it would review how it handles maintenance requests. The official Facebook page for GW Housing has responded to the posts with photographs of repairs.
Senior Associate Vice President for Operations Alicia Knight said Friday that the University has yet to firm up details of the review, but maintenance departments “consistently review” the way they handle requests.
She added that FIXIt requests are higher during move-in and that both facilities employees and house staff members have already performed inspections on all rooms to preclude some requests.
The FIXIt response staff, which students have long criticized for slow responses to residence hall problems, stepped up its communication about requests this summer. The department added email notification for emergency requests so staff can confirm requests and provide the applicant’s work order number.
The University plans to roll out another notification layer for routine calls later in the fall, sending students an email when FIXit assigns a request to a facilities employee and offering an estimated completion time for the job.
The University launched a mobile-friendly website for FIXit in July, and an app could be in the works in the future. GW’s maintenance team will now process requests via iPod touches, which Knight said improves timeliness.
