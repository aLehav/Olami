Moskowitz, who runs the course, said adding Kushner to the lineup of contemporary Jewish-American authors was a snag for the three-year-old class, which brings students together with the authors they read.
The class filled up with 25 seniors on the first day of registration. In past years, authors like Michael Chabon have also visited the course, which is funded by an undisclosed gift from alumnus David Bruce Smith, a former trustee.
It took an extra gift from Smith to attract Kushner, who asks a hefty speaking fee, which Moskowitz would not disclose.
Kushner is most famous for writing “Angels in America,” a two-part play that sets religion, sexuality and politics behind a backdrop of a country enduring the early part of the AIDS epidemic.
“It aroused a lot of attention at the time and it’s remained a very important play. Not only because of its politics, but because of the power of Kushner’s writing,” Moskowitz said.

There’s no place like home for the holidays, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t places we’d all rather be. If Thanksgiving break taught us anything, it’s that we don’t really want to spend any more time with these people than is absolutely necessary. After you’re tired of running into kids from your high school at the local bar, gather a few people you can stand, pop in a holiday movie, crack open your favorite seasonal adult beverage and play the Bar Bro’s Holiday Drinking Game.

The University said last month that it had been inflating admissions data for a decade. However, when it hired an audit firm, it only had the company review this past year’s data to determine what went wrong and how it happened.
The University said the audit found that the inaccuracies were “without malice” – but it could not determine the origin of the error.
The University did not release a written report from Baker Tilly, one of the country’s largest accounting and auditing firms, when asked because administrators say a formal audit report does not exist.
Wait. What?
Yes, the Board of Trustees allegedly only received an oral report from auditors at Baker Tilly in a closed-door meeting.
Since the administration held a town hall to discuss the data misreporting and U.S. News & World Report unranking before Thanksgiving break, they thought the issue would quickly become a matter of the past. But with so many pressing questions left unanswered, it is impossible to put this behind us.
GW will return to the U.S. News rankings list next year. What remains an issue is how the University has responded to this situation, and that it failed to release evidence to support its claims.
It is inconceivable that the University would pay a firm to examine its records and then not receive any documentation of that investigation. The whole purpose of conducting an audit is to set the record straight.
Administrators claim that in the oral report, auditors said no other data was calculated inaccurately. And when asked for evidence, University President Steven Knapp said, “There is not a formal audit report.” But it is mind-boggling that there is allegedly no written record and furthermore, that the University apparently did not request one from Baker Tilly.
How can this school’s leaders not have proof to substantiate the findings of Baker Tilly’s audit?
The president of the Association of College and University Auditors, Phillip Hurd, told The Hatchet he has worked on hundreds of audits for institutions of higher education.
“To not have a written [report] on something so important would be questionable,” he said. “If it’s going to be an official response to an issue, it’s always going to be something written. It’s kind of like, if you didn’t write it down, it didn’t happen.”
We cannot fathom why GW’s practices would be any different from other schools. And rather than getting peace of mind from this audit, we are left only with more questions.
Why didn’t the Board of Trustees get a report from Baker Tilly? Why would a reputable firm like Baker Tilly conduct an audit and not bother to provide a written report? Wouldn’t the University want physical documentation for its own records, at the very least?
Is it possible that the University purposely chose not to ask for a report? Could it be that administrators didn’t want one? If that is the case, is there something in the report that the administration doesn’t want the community to know?
The auditors supposedly gave a presentation to members of the Board of Trustees in a closed-door meeting in October. More than a dozen board members declined to comment on the presentation, provide their reactions to the audit, say if they received any documentation or explain whether or not they specifically asked the firm not to create any records.
When put in these kind of situations, it is standard practice for an institution to release a report. After reporting incorrect information to U.S. News, Claremont McKenna College and Iona College released a 25-page report and six-page report, respectively, outlining the nature of the error, the steps the college took to find its source and the audit’s overall findings.
If the University wanted a formal report, it could have had one, and administrators would have something to release to the community – a much-needed display of transparency.
But by leaving students and alumni empty-handed, the University further tarnishes its reputation and insults our intelligence as a community.
Somewhere inside Baker Tilly’s office, there must be a file on its investigation of GW’s admissions statistics. The University should demand that report and release it to the public.
It is in the University’s best interest to release a formal report. Otherwise, it is blatantly failing to be transparent with a community that is asking for answers to glaring questions.
It has been almost a month since GW announced it was inflating data, and as more details – like the lack of an actual audit report – have come out, more questions have arisen. Administrators and the Board of Trustees can’t expect this to just blow over.
We want to move on, but we can’t until we have more answers.

I’ve come to accept that self-deprecation comes with being an English major.
When I tell a business major that I study creative writing, I don’t wait for a reaction. Instead, I immediately follow with, “and I’m going to be the best barista Starbucks has ever seen.” The student usually laughs as if to say, “Yeah, because what else could you do?”
I am proud of my discipline, but voicing my liberal-artsiness too often results in an infantilizing eyebrow-raise or a dismissive “oh.” The liberal arts are stigmatized, conjuring words like “irrelevance,” “debt” and “Applebee’s.” These stand opposite to words used to describe the business discipline, like “lucrative,” “esteemed” and “Wall Street.”
And with the recent announcement that the GW School of Business could require liberal arts minors for its undergraduates, the tension between liberal arts and business majors has arisen again.
Business school students have voiced their dissatisfaction with the potential encroachment of the liberal arts into their discipline, declaring a liberal arts minor wasteful and unnecessary. But they’re wrong. General education requirements alone aren’t enough to expose business majors to the important lessons learned from a humanities degree.
A liberal arts education teaches students how to articulate and organize ideas. In the words of the late author David Foster Wallace, the humanities, among other things, “teaches how to think.” I spent a semester in the School of Business and then transferred into the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences for just that reason: I wasn’t learning how to think.
Not to mention, I wasn’t learning important communication and writing skills.
I could have learned my business school course material from reading a textbook or even by going online. In the entire semester that I was a business student, I didn’t have any group projects that taught me how to collaborate creatively with my classmates or professors.
Requiring a minor will only advance the business education and expand post-graduate opportunities for business majors. Business school undergraduates can’t succeed in the business world if they’re not proficient in the skills that are offered to English, history and sociology majors.
If business majors took on a liberal arts minor, they would learn how to prepare written essays as well as projects that involve more interaction with their peers – skills that are essential in the world of boardrooms and pinstriped suits.
College business students who took the Collegiate Learning Assessment, which focuses on writing and reasoning skills, scored lower than humanities and social-science majors, according to a April 2011 article in the Chronicle of Higher Education.
This dismal trend for business students also exists for the GMATs, the entry exam for M.B.A. programs. Undergraduate business majors scored lower than all other majors, according to “Academically Adrift: Limited Learning on College Campuses.”
And a University of Missouri-St. Louis survey of GRE scores between 2006 and 2009 comparing 44 different majors found that business majors ranked 35th in verbal reasoning and 36th in analytic writing. Liberal arts majors, on the other hand, filled the top seven slots in verbal reasoning and the top nine in analytic writing. Philosophy majors scored 13 places above accounting majors.
Business students are falling behind those in liberal arts fields. The skills assessed on the GRE are basic – math, writing and critical thinking – and business school students are graduating without having had enough practice in those areas. A minor in the liberal arts would change this.
Bringing liberal arts to the School of Business would mean that students would get more training in the skills applicable to GMAT and GRE tests.
So, business majors, no need to fear: A required liberal arts minor will not land you a permanent spot on the other side of the Starbucks counter. It may actually be your key into the business world.

My parents met as undergraduates in College Park, Md., so I grew up rooting for the University of Maryland. Naturally, I was saddened when UMD announced in November that it was leaving the Atlantic Coast Conference – which it helped found in 1953 – to join the Big Ten in 2014.
But I feel as though I’m watching a bad movie I’ve already seen one too many times. As Colonials, we know how difficult it can be to spark interest in the men’s and women’s basketball games. And we know what it’s like to lack school spirit and campus tradition.
And now, GW’s problems could just as easily begin to plague the University of Maryland.
It saddens me because this was a move done without consideration for the most important aspect of college sports: tradition. In a blatant money grab in the name of student athletes’ so-called wellbeing, the University of Maryland has sold its priceless tradition and thrown away its identity for pennies on the dollar.
As a kid, ACC basketball games against the University of North Carolina and Duke University were exhilarating. The hatred fans had for those teams was intense, and it made the games special and fun to watch.
Whether we won or lost, the games were exciting because of the history and tradition that came with them.
But that was then. Today, collegiate sports are stuck in a broken business model that relies on ticket sales, merchandising, TV deals and lots of money from alumni just to survive.
Of course, money is important, but to build a strong athletics program, you need a strong campus tradition too. The familiarity that comes with being in the same conference and playing the same teams for decades is just as important as the revenue the teams collect. It builds a sense of rivalry between schools and creates memorable games.
And while this move might shoot some revenue into the school’s athletic programs, Maryland is alienating generations of graduates and students. There is a time for rebranding, but this is not a simple facelift. This is massive reconstructive surgery.
Unlike UMD, GW’s athletic program lacks a great history and tradition, mostly because we have no rivals.
I worry that this move for UMD will garner the same results.
Maryland’s administration justified this move as a way to solve its athletic department’s financial woes. But those problems won’t disappear when Maryland leaves the ACC. Dave Brandon, athletic director at Big Ten powerhouse University of Michigan noted on 60 Minutes Nov. 18 that only a handful of colleges have athletic departments that break even – let alone earn a profit.
Maryland already plays in a competitive conference and has developed decent football, basketball, soccer and lacrosse teams. Those sports are part of the tradition and culture of the University, and Maryland will likely be short-changed with this deal.
One of GW’s greatest flaws is its lack of tradition. And that manifests itself most harshly in our turnout for games at the Smith Center.
I’m afraid by moving to the Big Ten, Maryland will find itself caught in this same trap.

When I went home for Thanksgiving, I made an offhand remark about GW’s unranking at the dinner table, only to find something surprising: Not a single member of my family had heard about it. In fact, I had to explain the gory details of how it had occurred.
It just goes to show that GW could have done worse than this admissions data scandal.
This isn’t to trivialize the administration’s admissions mistake by any means. A decade or more is a long time to continually use a system of estimation and inflate freshman profile statistics. And the University hasn’t handled the unranking situation with much transparency. In fact, GW has refused to release a formal audit report, claiming that it never received one.
But this misstep shouldn’t stop people from giving back to GW, and alumni shouldn’t ditch their alma mater. They have to realize that the University is reliant on their continued support. GW can recover from this, and over time, it is likely it will rebound from this and ultimately  emerge even stronger than it was before.
In the past decade, GW has made strides in alumni fundraising. In 2012, the University raised $120 million in donations, $31 million of which was from alumni. Plus, the University is in the quiet phase of a capital campaign, in which administrators will call upon donors and supporters from across the country to ask for their support. As a school that has been playing catch-up in fundraising, this trajectory must be maintained.
U.S. News & World Report rankings actually mean very little and appeal to few other than high school upperclassmen who are just beginning the college application process. GW’s unranking will not change the quality of the education we receive here, and it will not alter students’ quality of life.
The University has an opportunity to turn this disaster into something positive. But it must call on its alumni to help.
In November, the University emailed alumni and donors to help curb any potential concerns. During this time of uncertainty, it’s even more important for the development office to remind its supporters of how essential their commitment to the University is today and will continue to be in the months and years to come.
Just because GW made a very public mistake doesn’t mean we have to lose support from the larger community. If anything, it is a time when the development office should increase its push to solicit donations.
After this scandal, the University should do everything in its power to keep alumni giving flowing.

The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill Friday that would draw more foreign students to graduate science, technology, engineering and math programs and could increase GW’s admissions selectivity – though it has become the target of political opposition.
The bill would create 55,000 additional working visas for foreigners who receive advanced degrees in STEM fields from American universities, intended to encourage international students to stay in the U.S. after graduating.
But the bill drew harsh criticism from the White House last week, with a spokesperson for Barack Obama describing it as a set of “narrowly tailored proposals that do not meet the President’s long-term objectives” in a release. The STEM visas would replace a green card lottery system that previously allowed foreigners from countries with typically low immigration rates, such as African nations, into the U.S.
The Republican-backed bill will likely fail in the Democrat-controlled Senate, as it passed the House with votes cast largely along party lines. Representatives shot down a similar bill in September.
Some organizations have also attacked the bill, like the National Association on Foreign Student Advisors’s Association of International Educators, which announced its opposition to the bill last week, saying “it perpetuates a divisive, us-versus-them approach to immigration reform.”
Engineering professor Charles Garris said the bill would increase the number of international students who would want to study STEM fields at GW, because they would have an easier time staying and working in the country after graduation.
“There are fine international students in the STEM areas here, and this bill will only attract more,” Garris said. “GW has a good international reputation, and a bill like this will only increase our image and our competitiveness internationally.”
Nearly 30 percent of all graduate students in SEAS were foreign last year, the most foreign students in any of GW’s 10 schools.
Last May, Forbes Magazine ranked D.C. as the No. 2 city in the nation for job growth in STEM fields. Jobs in D.C. science and engineering industries have increased more than 20 percent since 2001.
A potential influx of applications could also mean stronger applicant pools for GW just a few years before it will open the $275 million Science and Engineering Hall. The academic complex will add thousands of feet of lab space as GW looks to become a top-tier research institution.
Garris said the move could also help alleviate the American scientist and engineer shortages facing companies around the U.S.
“Americans typically don’t go further into the STEM doctoral programs because they are more interested in getting jobs and getting into business and making money. They don’t have any interest in sitting in a laboratory knocking their heads together,” Garris said.
James Brown, an alumnus and executive director of the lobbying group the STEM Education Coalition, said many of the 500 businesses and professionals in his network complain that there are not enough advanced STEM graduates in America.
“There’s a very shortage of real talent out there. They’re challenged to hire people with the right skills,” Brown said.
He added that companies support the bill but acknowledge that it is short-sighted. To create real immigration reform, he said, there needs to be a focus on the big picture of how to institutionalize a greater number of STEM graduates and job seekers in America each year.
“We want the smartest people in the world studying and working in the United States. It  doesn’t make sense to provide them with a world class education in a field and then we lose them to going back to their home country because they can’t get a visa,” Brown said.

More students have complained this semester about smoking in Ivory Tower, prompting the University to email residents warning that officers could soon crack down on indoor cigarette use.
Twenty-two students have been charged with violating residence hall smoking policies so far this school year, Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities director Gabriel Slifka said.
Last academic year, 51 students were charged, a drop of 15 cases from the previous year.
The University Police Department sometimes steps in when incidents or complaints are reported to GW house staff members. But UPD Chief Kevin Hay said the office could not count how many reports were specifically from Ivory Tower by publication time.
“As we head into final exams, please take this opportunity to examine how your choices affect those around you.  If you choose to smoke, please exit the building to do so in the future,” the email read.
Greg Rheault, who oversees juniors and seniors in the Center for Student Engagement, said the goal of the message was to make residents “aware of their responsibilities as members of the GW campus community, to recognize how their behaviors affect others and to inform residents how to report concerns to [the University Police Department].”
He said most of the incidents occur late at night or early in the morning, and students were voicing concerns to their house staff members about smoke coming into their rooms through ventilation systems.
When students are caught smoking indoors, they are brought before the University’s judicial branch for disciplinary action, with punishment ranging from warnings to probation. The severity of disciplinary action depends on whether other illegal substances are present in the room at the time of the bust – an incident Slifka said is rather common.
Students are also punished for covering smoke detectors or tampering with fire safety systems in other ways, Slifka said.
“The Office of Student Rights & Responsibilities only receives a small number of reports each academic year for a smoking policy violation not in conjunction with other policy violations,” Slifka said in an email.

Where: 1353 H St., NE
When: Every Friday evening. First 40 to sign up play. Sign-ups start at 6 p.m. Game starts at 8 p.m.
Carded: Yes
Cover: No
The Bar Bro brings you the best dives in the District. He isn’t classless – just low-class.
In the months since my 21st birthday, H Street corridor has emerged as my favorite scene in the District. There’s something for everyone: tasty food, great music venues, legitimate, pre-gentrified hipster cred – if you’re into that sort of thing – and some of the coolest and most innovative bars in the city. Still, it’s rare that I see another group of GW kids along H Street. It may be a little far for some of you – the closest Metro stop is Union Station, after which you may want to grab a cab or, God forbid, walk. But if you put in the effort, H Street is sure to provide some of the most fun nights you’ll have in college.
Every Friday night, H Street staple Rock N Roll Hotel hosts a “Spelling Buzz” from 8 to 10 p.m. As a lover of drinking games, and one of The Hatchet’s best spellers, I decided to try it out this weekend with a few friends. Worst case scenario: I would have a couple drinks, get knocked out early and go hit a few other bars. Best case scenario: I could win the first prize – a $60 bar tab – and bragging rights for the rest of the night.
The setup had all the familiar trappings of a classic, grade school spelling bee. Contestants sat in rows of chairs and approached a podium with a microphone when it was their turn to spell. But there’s a catch: Contestants must have a drink in hand at all times, and the emcee, or whoever is spelling at the podium, may order competitors to drink at any time. It’s sort of like what the Scripps National Spelling Bee would be if the 12-year-old Indian kids were hammered, rowdy adults.
The master of ceremonies, a man by the name of King Baby Shoes, carried himself like a less flamboyant Cee-Lo Green, exchanging good-natured barbs with the contestants. The words in the first round, he reminded us, were from the sixth-grade spelling list. Still, of the 30 or so competitors, about half were cut in the first round, flubbing words like “refrigerator,” “hyphen” and “chauffeur.” When it was my turn, he made fun of the fact that I had unbuttoned my shirt to show a little chest hair. I laughed and correctly spelled my first round word, “indictment.” Not everyone took the game so lightly, however. The first girl to be eliminated – after butchering the word “barrette” – proceeded to curse Baby Shoes out for the next half hour. He had more than enough in his arsenal to deal with her, but after a while, even her friends got tired of her antics. I came to understand that in any public drinking event, you’re going to get your share of douchebags, but, for the most part, the atmosphere during the game was more collegial than collegiate. Friends and strangers alike rooted each other on.
The next round got a little tougher, partly because we had moved up in word difficulty, and partly because we had been drinking pretty steadily. With PBR tallboys at $4 a pop, only feelings get hurt at the spelling buzz – not wallets. When my friend went out on “poinsettia” she was absolutely furious. This is a unique quality of one-and-done spelling bees. There is something maddening about the fact that no two words are the same. You correctly whisper the spellings of the five preceding words into your friend’s ear, only to screw up when you get to the podium. “Capoeira?” one may say, “But she got ‘bizarre!’ How is that fair?” Needless to say, my friend will never misspell “poinsettia” ever again. Luckily, I conjured the second “n” in “legionnaire” and skated through to the advanced round.
By the final round, I felt a real camaraderie – incidentally, a first-round word that someone missed – with my competitors. Most everyone there had already bested his or her friends who were made to wait by the bar. Everyone here was winner in spirit. Which was a good consolation, because the final round was a bloodbath. Foreign word after foreign word dispatched the spellers. My friend lost on “babiche,” a type of American Indian lacing. I went out on “alette,” incorrectly pronounced “elite” by the King, but hey, who’s keeping track? It’s an architectural term for a supporting post or arch, or the wing of a building. The second-place finisher missed “sarsaparilla,” while the winner correctly spelled “saccharin.” After the winner was announced we headed out to H Street – drunk, happy, a little smarter and hungry to come back and win that bar tab. If nothing else, I’ll know how to spell “alette” the next time I see one.
