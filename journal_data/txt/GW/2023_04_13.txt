Just two blocks away from the Eastern Market Metro station in Capitol Hill, a dive bar has dished out the best of American food classics for more than six decades.
The Nardelli family opened Tune Inn in 1947, serving up greasy diner food favorites from burgers to breakfast meals and attracting customers from politicians to hungry tourists mesmerized by its history – the spot even has the second-oldest liquor license in the city dating back to the repeal of prohibition. Right off Pennsylvania Avenue, the restaurant has sincere wait staff and no frills – its charm is in its rugged atmosphere and come-as-you-are attitude, keeping loyal regulars coming back for decades.
Old neon signs that spell out “Tune Inn” and “Breakfast Anytime” cover the brick facade of the restaurant and illuminate the outside sidewalk at night. Inside the constrained narrow space, 10 booths are split between a pair of side walls behind a long bar to the left of the entrance.

Taxidermied animals, vintage beer advertisements and sports memorabilia line the wooden panel walls. The decor is reminiscent of an old man’s hunting cabin in the Appalachian forest, pretty impressive considering its urban centrality. Dusty hunting rifles and heads of stuffed wild hogs, boars and deer are mounted throughout the restaurant, complimenting the large antler chandeliers that dimly light the restaurant. My friends and I arrived on a Saturday at 1 p.m. and seated ourselves in one of the black leather booths by the back of the room.
The all-day menu was divided into appetizers, burgers, sandwiches and breakfast dishes accompanied by salads, soups and sides. Tune Inn has quite an eclectic and grotesquely American burger menu consisting of a “Smoky Mountain” burger with ham, Swiss cheese and BBQ sauce, “The Fireman” made with mashed pork scraps and “The Hangover” with sausage patty and fried egg. All cost $16.
With large appetites, we first contemplated appetizers like jalapeno poppers ($11), wings ($14) and gravy fries ($10). We decided to split the “Mac Wedges” ($12) – fried mac and cheese balls in the form of triangles. Eight of these deep-fried wedges came out hot and oily in a red basket on red and white checkered paper and served with a side of ranch dressing. About the size of a McDonald’s hashbrown, the wedges were cheesy and perfectly crispy, almost reminiscent of the Kraft mac and cheese we grew up eating but with the added edge of a warm breaded crunch from the panko breading.
For my entree, I ordered from the sandwich section, which had all my favorites like the Philly cheesesteak ($15), classic Reuben ($15) and BLT ($13). I settled on the “Joe’s West Virginia” sandwich ($15), which I presumed to be the signature dish of the restaurant, holding the name of its former owner Joe Nardelli, also known as “West Virginia Joe.” The sandwich consisted of grilled rye bread with thinly sliced homemade roast beef topped with American cheese and the “house sauce.”
Cut diagonally, the crisp and warm rye bread added acidity that combined with the sweet, tender and high-piled roast beef for a complex flavor profile. The sandwich tasted like a Smoky Mountain take on a classic Reuben, losing the typical sauerkraut and subbing in roast beef for corned beef. The melted American cheese and house sauce emulsified, making the sandwich more decadent and creamy. The sauce, the star of the sandwich, was slightly sweet and tangy, overall a more zesty and flavorful version of thousand island dressing. Without it, the sandwich would be too dry. The dish was incredibly savory, and I could immediately feel its weight in my stomach, the perfect choice if you’re absolutely ravenous.
After finishing our meal and sitting back in our seats completely satisfied, my friends and I spent the next 10 minutes observing the carefully curated clutter of trophies, framed photos of police officers and caricatures of bartenders that cover the walls and shelves of the restaurant. Upon exiting, the sunlight strained our eyes as we were transported back from a far-off hunting cabin back to the busy hubbub of D.C.
Tune Inn is the perfect spot to step out of the oftentimes over-the-top D.C. food scene and indulge in simple American classics, all in the busy Capitol Hill neighborhood.

If you’ve lurked around the ground or fourth floors of the University Student Center late at night and heard students cheering, dice clacking or a medieval cover of Britney Spears’ “Toxic” playing, allow me to apologize – you’ve overheard the Dungeons & Dragons game I run on campus.
Since October, a handful of The Hatchet’s staff and I have gathered every week in the student center’s conference rooms and study spaces and when they’re booked, the basement of The Hatchet’s townhouse. What was supposed to be a single session or one-shot – think a standalone episode of a television series – has morphed into a monthslong saga, and the size of our group has grown from five to nine players total. I wanted friends, and I got them thanks to D&D.
For the uninitiated, D&D is a tabletop roleplaying game. You and your fellow players create characters – a cunning thief, a charismatic bard, a cool-headed wizard – before acting out a variety of scenarios and rolling dice to determine the outcome of your actions. The higher you roll, the better the chances of success are. All you need is a little luck to get a discount at a local shop or slay an ancient dragon, two common encounters in D&D’s medieval fantasy setting.
I haven’t dueled with a dragon, but the game has been key in an even greater quest – making friends in college. I didn’t know where to start, but I did know about D&D. So with my collection of multicolored polyhedral dice and guidebooks, I searched the land of Foggy Bottom for a group of people to roll with when I arrived on campus for my sophomore year in fall 2021. Since then, I’ve found D&D isn’t just about fantasy. For me, it’s been a tool to turn strangers into friends – and all it takes is a little initiative.
I started playing D&D with some friends in high school, and it wasn’t long before I stepped up to be our Dungeon Master to keep our adventures going. The Dungeon Master runs the game and orchestrates the story, and my parents’ dining room table soon became a stage to tell tales of brave and daring heroes from haunted houses to frost-covered caverns.
It takes quite a bit of work to tell these stories – being a Dungeon Master involves keeping the history of a world that exists largely in your imagination. I can tell my players the date on a made-up calendar. I can whet their appetites with fictional foods. And I can greet them as the townsfolk from the largest cities to the smallest hamlets. My Google Drive is bursting at the seams with documents full of details about this mystical world that have taken me days to put together.
But all that work is, was and always will be worth it. The five of us – Orr, Anuj, Garrett, Afek and yours truly – and the characters we created spent hundreds of hours together over the course of high school. In the game, we explored ancient ruins and collapsed mines. Once our four-hour sessions wrapped up, we talked over pizza, soda and chips about our classes, girlfriends and, in the early days of 2020, the emerging pandemic.
Our games came to an end that year, and our friendships withered without D&D to bring us together. After a full year of online classes, the only other person I knew when I first moved on campus sophomore year was my roommate.
In search of a new friend group, I started attending weekly meetings of the GW Tabletop Gaming Society that fall. I eventually offered to run my own D&D campaign for three of the society’s members who were then strangers. We’ll have our 26th meeting on Friday, a year and a half since we started playing D&D together. Our games and our friendship have continued despite the occasional case of COVID-19, many last-minute cancellations – usually mine – and a transition from in-person to virtual meetings.
When I became the opinions editor of the Hatchet last spring, I knew my fellow staff members more as email addresses or names on a Google Doc than as actual people. A few emails, Slack messages and texts later and our D&D group was off and running. Though we still halt for breaking news and late-night edits, we’ve gone from coworkers to confidantes over the course of 16 D&D sessions. All it took was me asking if anyone was interested.
Between two D&D campaigns, classes and The Hatchet, my workload as Dungeon Master hasn’t gotten any lighter. That’s okay – D&D has allowed me to share something I love with others who have quickly become my friends precisely because I shared that passion with them.
You may not have to consult a list of monsters to challenge your players during that week’s session, take notes in Google Docs or consult tomes of D&D-related information, but good friendships don’t come to those who wait – you have to put in the work.
Your soon-to-be friends are going to need a reason to stick with you and with each other, and you can almost certainly parlay your passion into something you can do with other people who can quickly become part of your life. So make plans, send out a when2meet and get a head count – that’s what I do.
It doesn’t take much to turn strangers into friends, just the right place and the right time. Whether they’re a group of adventurers looking for their first quest or acquaintances looking to get to know each other better, all they need is you to lead the charge.

Facing a problem yourself? Annie has answers. Ask away!
Nicholas Anastacio | Graphics Editor
Dear Annie,
Ever since coming to college, I’ve developed a bad habit of borrowing things…forever…from stores. I guess you call that stealing? I feel that stores like [redacted] don’t need my money or won’t miss [redacted]. But lately I’ve felt this may be a problem. What should I do?
Xoxo,
Winona Ryder
Editor’s Note: We can neither confirm nor deny that this is the famous actor Winona Ryder.
Dear Winona Ryder,
While I don’t condone shoplifting, I hope you are only stealing items that will help you look good in your mugshot for when you inevitably get caught – perhaps some skincare from [redacted], chapstick from [redacted] and maybe some wine from [redacted] to help you pose with confidence.
Jenna Baer | Staff Cartoonist
Miss Ryder, shoplifting is a problem. Stealing squash from a bald man’s corporation probably won’t land you in the slammer with mugshot clout, but you’ll likely get banned from the store or slapped with a fine far more than the price of the stolen item. The consequences of being caught are not worth the risk.
It’s easier to pay for the item at the cash register than sneak it away with possible punishments looming…so why do you, tons of other people and (once) admittedly myself shoplift? You need to ask yourself that question. Does it make you feel more in control? Does it allow you to avoid awkward conversations about your spending habits with your parents? Whatever your reason for stealing, there are other solutions.
If you steal to grant yourself the illusion of control over your life, focus on other, less illegal ways you can do so. You can control whether you avoid the political fever coursing through GW’s campus. The consequences are much lighter than an arrest. Refusal to vote in SA elections may end with a candidate’s deflated ego rather than handcuffs.
If you want to buy something without someone finding out, just ask a friend to buy it for you and pay them back. If your parents ask why you Venmoed Veronica $11, say she bought you a coffee rather than a mango-flavored vape at McReynolds.
You need to develop some lost willpower to stop stealing. There was a time when shoplifting wasn’t your thing – you can get back to those days before becoming a kleptomaniac. Reward yourself each time you go to the store and pay for all of your items. Perhaps watch an episode of your favorite trashy reality TV show like the new season of “Love Is Blind” or go to bed early to get your beauty sleep.
Ask your friends to accompany you while shopping to hold you accountable. With your permission, they could check for items you may have hidden in your pockets or backpacks to make sure you scan each barcode. Who doesn’t love shopping with their friends – even if they are there to hold you within the law? To make the shopping excursion fun, you could even coordinate outfits as Blair and Serena from Gossip Girl do for their outings.
You could replace shoplifting as a bad habit with a not-so-illegal habit. If you feel the need to behave inappropriately at the store, start crop-dusting on people – annoying and childish, but not illegal. If the illegality of shoplifting brings you joy, do something less legally severe, like send a tweet giving a false weather report. The U.S. government outlaws this silly prank. Imagine the rush of telling your followers they need a sweatshirt when it’s sweltering outside – the perfect revenge for unwashed dishes!
Though shoplifting may start for quick, adolescent pleasure, it may spiral into an addiction that causes more shame than satisfaction. Even if you’re not an Elliott kid chasing a security clearance, you should aim to nip the habit in the bud before you face outsized consequences.
Stay outta prison,
Annie<3

Grammy-nominated country singer Kelsea Ballerini sent shockwaves through the country music industry after performing her single “IF YOU GO DOWN (I’M GOIN’ DOWN TOO)” at the Country Music Television Awards, which she hosted alongside Kane Brown earlier this month. But her impressive vocals, tongue-in-cheek lyrics and engaging stage presence had nothing to do with it.
Following her performance with a group of four “RuPaul’s Drag Race” alumni, Ballerini has faced backlash and even accusations that her music is “not country” at all. Yet the criticism contradicts the fact that the track, like the vast majority of her discography, is undeniably a classic country song both sonically and lyrically. But these accusations are not and have never been about what is or isn’t “country.” In a genre built on authentic storytelling, Ballerini is as country as it gets. The incessant hatred thrown at Ballerini is just the latest attempt to silence women in country music who experiment with the genre, uplift marginalized groups or speak out about uncharted, more progressive territory with their art.
Despite the heavy criticism levied at them, Ballerini and other outspoken progressive country artists like Maren Morris and Kacey Musgraves draw in an otherwise disassociated group of listeners who stand by the classic blanket statement that they hate country music. Even those who have come out in support of Ballerini after the CMT Awards have prefaced by saying they aren’t country fans but will listen to Ballerini’s music because it underscores a more progressive subgroup of the genre. While everyone is entitled to their taste in music, many people who say they dislike country music don’t mean that they hate traditional country lyrics, sounds or instruments. They mean that they’ve become disillusioned with the one-dimensional ideas that the industry continues to push – country artists must fit into a strict mold. In the minds of many radio station executives, unless they play male country artists singing about beers, trucks and women, no one will listen.
But this limited viewpoint is far from the case – country music at its core is about storytelling, and it must tell the stories and appeal to the interests of a diverse group of people rather than a select few. Sticking to the latter only limits experimentation and individuality, alienating artists and audiences alike. But new artists are apprehensive to take creative risks for fear of being blacklisted from radio stations, causing their career to end before it begins.
These fears are not unfounded – from the infamous silencing of The Chicks in 2003 after members said they were “ashamed” of former President George W. Bush due to the Iraq War to the incessant backlash toward Ballerini two decades later, it’s clear not much has shifted within a genre so resistant to change. And even without any controversy, it’s hard enough as it is for a new female artist to break into the country scene – in 2020, employees at country radio station KCQ admitted the station bars them from playing two women back to back. In one of the few genres where the radio still carries immense weight, this matters – and it’s happening in plain sight.
Despite what it has become, country music used to be something entirely different than it is today with iconic artists like Dolly Parton publicly supporting the LGBTQ+ community far before it was popular. But the post-9/11 era of country music led to a wave of social conservatism and ushered in a new silencing of artists like Ballerini, Morris and Musgraves who make the same statements of support more than three decades later.
If country artists felt comfortable enough to push boundaries without risk of getting blacklisted and censored, they would draw in a new fanbase to the genre beyond a narrow-minded following ready to boycott them at the drop of a hat. But if record labels refuse to sign them and the radio won’t play them, these artists are forced to either conform or be ousted from the genre entirely. Like many of her predecessors, Ballerini has already hinted at wanting to “cross over” to pop, and it’s not because the Tennessee native doesn’t want to sing and write country songs – it’s because the industry no longer welcomes her.
Freedom of expression is essential in all aspects of media, particularly in the universal language of music – a connector of cultures, identities and backgrounds. The music industry – in all genres – should be a place where every person can see themselves positively reflected, and country music shouldn’t be the exception.
The country genre continues to sabotage itself by alienating artists and audiences alike, and the industry must evolve to broaden the scope of its talent and fanbase. It’s difficult to force an antiquated industry to shift, and it may seem like an easier feat for disillusioned fans to stop listening and frustrated artists to make a genre switch. But this issue can only be fixed if artists push boundaries and fans continue to listen. So even if you’ve “never liked country,” give artists like Ballerini, Musgraves and Morris a try. They’re putting their careers in the genre they love at risk to make art they care about in an immensely polarizing climate. Fans outside of their typical pool of listeners may find themselves surprised at how authentic country music can be when it’s free of constraints.
Julia Koscelnik, a senior majoring in political science and minoring in journalism and mass communication, is the contributing opinions editor.
This post has been updated to correct the following:
The post incorrectly stated that Ballerini is facing criticism a decade after The Chicks faced backlash in 2003. Ballerini faced criticism two decades after The Chicks faced that criticism. We regret this error.

During the catchy single “How” featuring Roddy Ricch, Ella Mai sang about her independence on the heels of an overly attached relationship.
British R&B singer Ella Mai brought her euphonious, high-soprano vocals and in-sync dance choreography to D.C. with a stop at Echostage on her “Heart On My Sleeve” Tour Saturday.
After a four-year hiatus from touring, Mai showcased the extended version of her 2022 sophomore album “Heart On My Sleeve,” which released in February with three bonus tracks. She brought her unmatched vocal wonders onto the stage, moving on from the nostalgia of her self-titled 2018 debut album into a composed lyrical genius in charge of her own narrative.
Inside the venue, a large red pixelated heart that read EMaiX – short for Ella Mai Deluxe – filled the stage’s backdrop as the lights dimmed to a deep blue, signaling showtime. The crowd erupted as the R&B star entered the stage to the interlude of the beloved single “Trying,” the first track of the album. In a stunning denim, two-piece outfit with tied straps on each arm and long curls sweeping to her side, the artist smiled at the crowd as she started singing the fast, chopped verses of the song’s intro followed by a “How are we doin’ tonight, D.C.?”
Dreamy glows of orange lights warmed the stage for the next song, matching the lyrics of my favorite track “Not Another Love Song,” a single that emanates crackling summer romance as she hovered on the smooth “Ohs” in the chorus. In her honeyed tones, Mai sang “I just wanna know what’s up / Do you feel it? ‘Cause I think I’m in” with the help of her two backup singers. They finished the verse with a synchronized, harmonious “love,” grabbing their microphones with both hands for a moment of sincerity in the otherwise upbeat choreography. Mai’s performance confronted the former relationships she cast with apprehension in her older music, now singing with fixed emotions about the former version of herself – someone living in her dreams yet waiting for her goals to happen on her own terms.
During the catchy single “How” featuring Roddy Ricch, Mai sang about her independence on the heels of an overly attached relationship. She sang to the crowd about her commitment to “drive” to the next chapter on her own time instead of letting someone take over her life with lyrics like “Back to business, caught my fuel again / You out so I can let me back in.” Her lulling voice didn’t need to finish the lines in the microphone for it to carry across the room – she soothed the audience with her refreshing conviction in her movements and long soprano tones that floated in the air.
The stage gleamed in a crimson hue as she jumped into the song that everyone was waiting for, Grammy-award-winning “Boo’d Up.” With an ode to attendees, she asked who in the crowd came to the concert with their “boos” and told them to gear up for the single made for them. Mai motioned for everyone to move their hands back and forth as she paced across the stage with the music, the vocals of her and her backup singers reverberating within the building.
In a switch-up to the track “Didn’t Say” that delighted fans due to her quick execution and swift arm movements, Mai started rapping the lines “Said it’s all in the things that you didn’t say, didn’t say / Too busy hidin’ anyway” in rapper Latto’s verse. She poured absolute confidence into the song’s intimate words as she walked around the stage with the microphone while gazing at the crowd as she motioned for them to sing along with the words.
Mai acknowledges support from her fans every chance she gets – from her award speeches to her interviews to endless social media dialogue. That gratitude was evident across the venue when she pointed out at fans, held out her mic when they were singing the loudest and praised her background vocalists’ clean-cut movements. Fans sang their hearts out, even assisting in a quick “Happy Birthday” serenade when Mai announced it was her hairstylist’s special day, ushering her out from behind the stage.
I left the concert astonished by the paradoxical vulnerability and confidence she exuded in each song and line she performed. The ethereal range from her deep, rich tones to her higher pitches kept the audience transfixed and ready to mimic her sound.
Mai’s performance embodied a self-made artist who has taken power into her own hands. From the moment her producer and close friend DJ Mustard discovered her on Instagram, she has transformed 21st-century R&B. In an empowering moment, Mai even addressed the ladies in the crowd during the concert, asking why women let “sh*t” happen when they know they shouldn’t.
Mai’s gratitude and excited air as she directed the audience to sing along made the concert all the more electrifying. She wooed the D.C. crowd with her impeccable, potent lyricism and showed fans how she wore her heart on her sleeve.

Junior Jaylee Davis, co-chair of Students Against Imperialism, said she helped organize the vigil because national news outlets and GW community members were not paying “enough attention” to the cause.
Student demonstrators from three campus organizations hosted a vigil in front of the White House Saturday to honor victims of a fire at a border detention center in Juárez, Mexico late last month.
More than 50 demonstrators joined UndocuGW, League of United Latin American Citizens GW and Students Against Imperialism in Lafayette Square to mourn 40 migrants killed in a fire at an immigrant detention center in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, across the border from El Paso, Texas. Gatherers said the recent tragedy highlights problems with U.S. border policies, like Title 42, which have triggered overcrowded shelters and strained conditions in centers because of the high number of migrants denied asylum.
A fire broke out at a Juárez migrant processing facility near the major border crossing at the Paso del Norte Port of Entry March 27. Authorities alleged migrants started the fire by igniting their mattresses to protest their impending deportation, and facility surveillance footage showed security guards walking away from the fire and not attempting to release the inmates. 
Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Tuesday that the guards didn’t have the keys needed to unlock the migrants’ cells.
On March 28, a Mexican court launched an investigation into the fire and arrested three officials from the National Migration Institute – the agency that operates the Ciudad Juárez facility – two agency-contracted private security guards and the inmate accused of starting the fire. 
Junior Ángel Lagunas, the vice president of UndocuGW and the main organizer of the vigil, said they heard about the fire on Instagram and felt the initial report that migrants were burning their beds was “justified” as a protest of detention facility’s poor conditions, like overcrowding and a lack of accessible medical professionals.
“They were just gonna go back to their deaths,” Lagunas said. “And now, knowing that they were set on fire and left to die, it only enrages me more.”
Lagunas said demonstrators hoped to urge U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Department of Homeland Security officials to put an end to “xenophobic” immigration policies and called on government officials to abolish Title 42, which allows the United States to suspend migrants’ entry to “designated places” to prevent spread of communicable diseases. The federal government created Title 42 as a part of the Public Health Service Act of 1944 and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention reenacted it in March 2020 because of COVID-19 concerns. 
Julian Abeledo, president of LULAC GW and one of the other vigil organizers, described the tone of the demonstration as “mournful and indignant,” with demonstrators holding candles and signs around a floral offering as they chanted “no more dead migrants.” He said he was horrified to see footage of the guards failing to help the imperiled inmates.
“It speaks to the horrible reality we live in where I saw it, and just the headline almost glazed over me because it just feels like we’re seeing death all the time at the border,” Abeledo said. “But then, you see the video, and you see the guards just leave the migrants there to die, just ignore them as they’re begging to be freed, and that was just really horrifying.”
Abeledo said the deaths at the Ciudad Juárez facility are “on the hands” of the U.S. government and believes the fire is a product of U.S. border policy. He said the government should repeal Title 42, which he believes has exacerbated poor conditions in Ciudad Juárez and pushed more asylum seekers into Mexico.
Abeledo said the federal government should stop considering the President Joe Biden travel ban proposal in February, which would bar asylum for most non-Mexican migrants who do not seek it in other countries or have opted out of other asylum options.
“The U.S. government, at the very minimum, needs to repeal Title 42, and it needs to not enact the transit ban that is currently being considered by the Biden administration,” Abeledo said. “And then I would say also, generally, that it needs to have a much more open policy towards migrants and towards refugees.”
Junior Jaylee Davis, co-chair of Students Against Imperialism, said she helped organize the vigil because national news outlets and GW community members were not paying “enough attention” to the cause. Davis said she hoped to increase awareness about issues migrants are facing while attempting to gain entry into the U.S. by drawing attention to the fire and border policies through the vigil.
“We talk about the border in theoretical terms about policies and a little bit of entrenchment and bureaucracy,” Davis said. “It actually affects people’s lives, and it kills them.”
Davis said as government officials ease pandemic restrictions across the country, COVID-era immigration policies like Title 42 have been “contradictory” in continuing to bar access for migrants seeking asylum within U.S. borders. 
“If you’re going to say COVID is over, then why do you have these immigration policies that restrict people who are seeking asylum at the border?” Davis said. “It’s just fundamentally egregious.” 
Sophomore Javier Orellana, president of UndocuGW, said accusations that the migrants caused the tragedy by igniting their mattresses overlooked that the migrants were in danger of being deported and that immigration authorities would have “taken everything from them.”
Orellana said he was “connected” to the issue because of his own identity as an immigrant from El Salvador and added that immigrants currently have “limited” access to healthcare and educational programs in the United States.
“I feel connected in the same way that we all came here: in search of the American Dream,” Orellana said. “We all come here because we believe that our lives are going to be better.”

The Committee on Educational Policy and Technology will present their annual report, which addresses faculty concerns over classroom recordings, after 500 faculty responded to a survey on classroom recordings that a subcommittee administered.
Faculty senators will present reports on policy changes for classroom recordings at the Faculty Senate meeting Friday.
The Committee on Educational Policy and Technology will present their annual report, which addresses faculty concerns over classroom recordings, after more than 500 faculty responded to a survey on classroom recordings that a subcommittee administered in November. Faculty reported they are concerned about the potential for unauthorized sharing or editing of their classroom recordings, that class attendance was decreasing due to recordings and that officials would use recordings to promote or discipline faculty without their authorization.
The Committee on Appointments, Salary and Promotion Policies will also present a memorandum to the senate on the ownership of course recordings. The committee’s memorandum proposes officials adopt a policy for full-time faculty members similar to the policy that states officials must notify part-time faculty members if they choose to review their classroom recordings for evaluation.
Senators will also vote on a resolution to provide representation to College of Professional Studies faculty in the senate since there are currently no CPS faculty in the senate because senators are required to be tenured – a title no CPS faculty hold. The resolution proposes changes to the Faculty Organization Plan that allow CPS faculty to nominate two “delegates” who have taught at the school for at least three years and earned the position of associate professor or higher.
Joe Cordes and Susan Kulp, the co-chairs of the Fiscal Planning and Budgeting Committee, will deliver an update to the senate on the Fiscal Year 2023 budget and the FY 2024 budget planning.
Interim University President Mark Wrighton and Jim Tielsch, the chair of the executive committee, will present reports to the senate. Emily Hammond, the vice provost for faculty affairs, will also present a report on salary equity.
The senate will acknowledge eight senators whose terms are ending – Eric Grynaviski, Alice Alexa Joubin, Anthony Yezer, Nicholas Vonortas, Patrick McHugh, Sylvia Marotta-Walters, Kim Roddis and Kurt Johnson.
The senate will also vote on nominees for the Faculty Senate Executive Committee. Senators will also vote on nominee Joan Schaffner, an associate professor of law, for Dispute Resolution Committee chair.

Lesther Alemán said he joined university protests against the social security pension reform and the corruption of the Nicaraguan government.
An anti-government political dissident discussed the political situation in Nicaragua at the Elliott School of International Affairs Tuesday.
Lesther Alemán, a former University of Central America student and pro-democracy activist that the Nicaraguan government jailed in February 2022, said the country should unite to expand social welfare programs, oust President Daniel Ortega from power and restore democracy in the country, which declined after a series of undemocratic elections over the last decade. The event was hosted by LATAM@GW and moderated by Gema Kloppe-Santamaría, an assistant professor of history and international affairs.
Alemán was jailed on “conspiracy to undermine national integrity” charges in 2022 after telling Ortega to surrender in 2018. That year, Ortega announced his administration would decrease retirement benefits and raise payroll taxes to fund the country’s social security program, sparking mass revolts.
Alemán said protests against the Nicaraguan government arose when the government agreed to build an interoceanic canal between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans in 2015 to bring investment into the country. He said farmers whose land the government planned to expropriate to build the canal and students who opposed the Ortega regime’s social security changes united in opposition against the government’s actions.
“That created the first protests that were too many to count, and they were all repressed,” Alemán said.
Alemán said he joined university protests against the social security pension reform and the corruption of the Nicaraguan government. He said police started beating unarmed university students to silence protesters and the opposition movement from addressing public concerns.
“We were just youth, unarmed,” Alemán said. “We didn’t even have loudspeakers, we only had two or four placards. When we went out, the police surrounded and they started beating us.”
The Nicaraguan government violently cracked down on student and farmer protests between 2018 and 2022. The Ortega regime jailed and exiled hundreds of political opponents for speaking out against the government. The regime also implemented governmental reforms which made it more difficult for opposition candidates to run in elections and banned international organizations from observing the electoral process.
Alemán said there is going to be a power vacuum in the country if the Ortega regime is deposed. He also said relieving social, economic and political agony by 2026 is the top priority of the opposition.
“After Ortega’s departure, the transition is going to be extremely difficult,” Alemán said. “Who is going to take the leading role afterwards?”

Latour started writing songs when she was a teenager, and the now-22-year-old has released two EPs and more than a dozen singles, including a cover of Kim Wilde’s “Kids in America” for the 2022 Netflix film “Do Revenge.”
Indie-pop artist Maude Latour will perform at Spring Fling Saturday night in Potomac Square, according to a Program Board Instagram post Tuesday.
Latour – who is best known for her 2020 single “One More Weekend” – performed at music festivals Lollapalooza in Chicago and All Things Go in Columbia, Maryland last year while completing two tours in 2022, which featured a stop at Black Cat on the 14th Street corridor. Spring Fling, an annual live music festival on campus, has drawn hundreds of students for years and with past performers including hip-hop artist Swae Lee and pop artist blackbear.
Latour’s performance is scheduled to start at 6:30 p.m., according to the post. Latour said she’s excited to return to the DMV for the show and connect with fans as she has during past performances in the region.
“I’m so excited to play!” Latour said in a statement to The Hatchet. “My DMV shows are all perfect memories, I’ve felt so much love and support from the times I’ve come through. From the Black Cat to All Things Go, it’s all been a dream! Let’s make this time the best yet.”
Lydia McGlinn, Program Board’s director of events, said she’s eager to see a shift in the “vibe” of this year’s Spring Fling after the “hype” concert Swae headlined last spring. She said Latour’s indie-pop genre contrasts that of previous Spring Fling headliners, which have largely consisted of hip-hop, R&B and top-40s pop artists.
“As Program Board, we’re super excited to have Maude as our performer this year,” McGlinn said. “I think she’ll bring a new sound to campus that we haven’t had in a long time, and the genre is very new to campus as well. So I think it’ll bring new crowds and people we haven’t seen before.”
Latour started writing songs when she was a teenager, and the now-22-year-old has released two EPs and more than a dozen singles, including a cover of Kim Wilde’s “Kids in America” for the 2022 Netflix film “Do Revenge.” Her latest works include the electrifying synth-pop love songs “Heaven” and “Lunch,” inspired by her current relationship.
McGlinn said Spring Fling merged this year with Student Life’s Buff and Bloom Week, a collection of spring-themed programming the University introduced this year to celebrate the season that runs from April 10 through April 15. She said Spring Fling will follow Put Me On Fest, a music festival in Potomac Square featuring a variety of student artists and bands as a segment of Buff and Bloom.
Put Me On, a music streaming app that a group of students with ties to GW’s music community started developing in 2020, promotes independent artists looking to gain exposure.
Program Board has hosted Spring Fling in University Yard every year since 2013 with the exception of 2019, when a blackbear performance in the Smith Center brought meager crowds.
