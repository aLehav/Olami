A diverse mix of artists lined the program throughout the week, honoring classic jazz sound and introducing new elements to the exploratory genre.
Both internationally recognized and local jazz musicians hit four stages at The Wharf last weekend, rounding out a stunning stack of performances at the DC Jazz Festival.
DC Jazz Festival, an annual week-long celebration of jazz, was packed with dozens of soulful performances and engaging educational programming to expose the D.C.-influenced musical genre to locals and tourists alike. A diverse mix of artists lined the program throughout the week, honoring classic jazz sound and introducing new elements to the exploratory genre.
Chien Chien Lu, a Taiwanese-born vibraphonist and percussionist, brought fresh and unconventional sounds to the festival Saturday through her intricate and heartfelt playing of the vibraphone on jazzy tunes like “We Live in Brooklyn Baby” and “Fall Moonlight.” The audience couldn’t help but groove along to the Mambo Legends Orchestra as the Latin band brought a jazzy salsa sound to the festival while the sun set behind the stage.

Under colorful spotlights, jazz and rock drummer Cindy Blackman Santana rocked the house with a jam session as each instrument joined in one by one, building up to an energetic union of the band. The band’s setlist mixed rock originals like “We Came to Play” with the softer classic “Blue in Green” by Miles Davis.
Willard Jenkins, the artistic director of the festival, said the festival’s lineup balanced emerging and master-level artists with local roots and international fame. He said through partnerships with foriegn embassies in D.C., the festival has reeled in several international jazz artists from countries like Taiwan and France this year.
“We have this aggregate of artists coming to town and performing in different combinations,” he said. “It broadens the jazz perspective of our community, in terms of an opportunity to hear new artists and to hear what some of the great masters are up to in their particular projects at this particular time.”
Thirty groups of musicians performed between Union Stage, Pearl Street, District Pier and Transit Pier at The Wharf alone in addition to several other musical performances, panel discussions and film screenings throughout the week that culminated in an all-encapsulating homage to jazz. Top headliners like singer Dianne Reeves, double bassist Ron Carter and R&B and soul group Chuck Brown Band attracted sizable and enthusiastic crowds that moved along with the music, even in the heat of the summer days.

He said the festival celebrates D.C. as “jazz city,” making a point to hold performances in all four quadrants of the city. D.C. served as a cultural hub for jazz music starting at the beginning of the 20th century and produced iconic jazz musicians, including pianist and orchestra leader Duke Ellington and singer and pianist Shirley Horn.
“Jazz is an international language because it’s learned and played all over the world now, and we have a responsibility to reflect that, I think, being in Washington D.C.,” Jenkins said.
Sunny Sumter, the president and CEO of the festival, said this is the first year the festival has established Arena Stage – a three-stage venue that spotlights American artists a block away from the Wharf – as one of the festival’s core venues. Performances from Grammy award-winner Dianne Reeves and jazz pianist Orrin Evans graced the new stage last Friday, and a screening and discussion of a documentary about world-renowned trumpeter Roy Hargrove offered an enriching glimpse into the work of an influential jazz musician last Saturday.

Sumter said the venue will continue to program performances after the festival year round.
“We do want to create employment opportunities for D.C. artists year round,” she said. “We do want to have an opportunity for people to come whether they’re residents or visitors to hear jazz in traditional, non traditional jazz spaces around the city.”
Chien Chien Lu, who performed at District Pier and Union Stage during the festival, said she was performing a few concerts for the Taiwanese embassy in celebration of Taiwan’s birthday when the festival asked to participate in the DC Jazz Festival.
Lu said after completing intensive classical music training in Taiwan and touring Asia with a percussion group, she realized she never enjoyed covering music and wanted to pursue original music instead of feeling “like a machine doing the show.” She said she decided to enter the world of jazz to cultivate her own music, and soon after discovering the genre, she came to the United States to explore the style of music and collaborate with other musicians.
“Jazz is, to me, to explore or to mix with more people,” Lu said. “I think that’s a human nature.”
She said she loves to see more young people from around the world experiment with jazz, because while these musicians are less experienced and knowledgeable, they have the “groove” and “spirit” to forge a new atmosphere within the genre.
“When people accept that kind of new style or new music, that means we successfully stretch the music so the music becomes more flexible,” she said.

Wiley Brown – a musician in the jazz and go-go group the Chuck Brown Band, which performed for their fourth year at the festival last week – said the festival is a “pivotal” event in D.C. culture, given the vast array of diverse artists included in the lineup each year. He said artists at the festival particularly shine during their solos within their groups because the audience can see “what each musician is made of.”
“These jazz musicians, they’re going to express themselves in ways that will definitely be memorable,” Brown said. “And overall performances from each band, I know everyone is going to bring something different to the table.”
Brown, who is the son of the “Godfather” of go-go music Chuck Brown, said he accompanied his father when he performed in the very first DC Jazz Festival in 2005. Chuck Brown was not only an award-winning pioneer of go-go but also a local legend in the District for hits like “Bustin’ Loose,” which is known for minting the go-go sound, marked by a syncopated rhythm and percussion instruments like the bass drum, conga drum and cowbells. He said he hopes attendants will research and engage with participating artists even after the conclusion of the festival.
“It really just sparks a light in each person’s mind that, ‘Hey, you know what, there’s more to explore,’” Brown said. “Let me go check out this band, let me go check out this other band, and it can have them become new fans to something that they didn’t even know about.”

The majority of 7000-series trains have remained out of operation since a Blue Line derailment last October.
The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority announced they will return a dozen 7000-series railcars to service next week.
WMATA announced the additions will bring the total number of 7000-series railcars – WMATA’s most recent line of trains – in operation to 20 after WMATA was granted permission to run up to eight trains in June. The reintroduction process comes after WMATA pulled all of its 7000-series trains from service after a Blue Line derailment last October.
“Our 7000-series trains are the newest and most reliable in Metro’s fleet, and they are key to providing the level of service our customers want and deserve,” Randy Clarke, WMATA’s general manager and chief executive officer, said in a release Friday.
The additional railcars will run on the Red Line after previously having only been allowed to run on the Green and Yellow lines, according to WMATA’s September return to service plan. WMATA hasn’t said when 7000-series trains will return to the Blue, Orange and Silver lines, which service the Foggy Bottom station.
WMATA will announce new schedules for all six of its lines sometime this week, which will reflect the increase in operating railcars.

The D.C. Court of Appeals denied the attempts to block the vote, confirming the initiative's appearance on the November ballot.
D.C. voters will decide in November if District tipped workers will receive a wage increase after the D.C. Court of Appeals approved the ballot initiative last week.
The initiative would allow tipped workers — who currently earn at least $5.05 per hour — to earn at least the $16.10 minimum wage in D.C. If the initiative passes, pay for tipped workers will gradually increase starting in January 2023 and will eventually match the $16.10 minimum wage by July 1, 2027.
The D.C. Board of Elections added the initiative to raise the tipped minimum wage to the November ballot in April, but last month restaurant trade groups attempted to block the initiative from making it onto the ballot by claiming it did not have enough signatures to be included. The D.C. Court of Appeals denied the attempts to block the vote, confirming the initiative’s appearance on the November ballot.
Students who support the initiative said increased pay will provide a steady paycheck that is not reliant on tips, which can vary between day shifts and night shifts.
In 2018, the D.C. Council overturned legislation ending tipped wage when it repealed Initiative 77, a proposal passed by just more than half of the District’s voters in June 2018.
In July, the minimum wage for D.C. workers increased from $15.20 per hour to $16.10 per hour for nontipped employees and $5.05 per hour to $5.35 per hour for tipped employees. GW student employees are paid at least the minimum wage for D.C.

The initiative aims to address the non-inclusive language that LGBTQ+ and BIPOC people may face.
The GW School of Medicine and Health Sciences will lead an education initiative for primary care practitioners to improve communication about HIV and COVID-19 for vulnerable patients.
SMHS received funding from biotechnology company Gilead Sciences to train primary care practitioners over the next 18 months to engage in “culturally responsive” conversations about HIV and COVID screening and testing with patients who identify as LGBTQ+ and Black, Indigenous People of Color. The Two In One HIV + COVID Screening & Testing Model aims to create better relationships between patients and health care officials to lessen the negative stigma surrounding HIV and COVID screening.
The model hopes to eliminate “discomfort” from patients when talking about the risks and barriers to care patients face when dealing with HIV and COVID.
“Our goal is to make COVID and HIV screening and testing a natural part of every primary care visit in ways that meet the cultural needs of BIPOC and LGBTQIA+/Queer patients,” officials said on the website.
The Two In One Model encourages people who identify as BIPOC and LGBTQ+ to share their personal experience with receiving clinical care for HIV or COVID on the Two In One Model website to receive a $30 Amazon gift card.
The training for primary care providers will be broken into two parts with nine live-streamed monthly lectures and an asynchronous module-based training course. The training will cover history and context about HIV and COVID inequalities among BIPOC and LGBTQ+ communities.
The Two In One Model comprises three elements: research in the experiences of primary care providers and patients, training primary care providers using the research gained from patient and care provider interviews, and social marketing the main ideas gathered from the initiative.
“What we learn from this research will help remove the barriers that primary care practitioners face in providing the best possible HIV and COVID screening and testing,” officials said.

When students find themselves on the frontlines of national issues and officials promise to shake up GW for better or for worse, The Hatchet’s editorial board springs into action to respond to the news – what happened, and why should you care about it?
As we continue to cover topics big and small this year, we wanted to outline what we do and who we are. The editorial board meets each week to discuss topics relevant to GW that might happen on campus, around D.C. or across the country. Whether the news breaks in The Hatchet or other publications, opinions editor Ethan Benn and contributing opinions editor Riley Goodfellow will choose a topic for that week’s staff editorial. After discussion and debate, the editorial board’s collective views form the basis of the staff editorial, which Benn and Goodfellow write as The Hatchet’s official stance.
So what do we believe? Since May this year, we’ve demanded the University declare its support for abortion rights, asked officials to help students make sense of financial aid, endorsed a candidate in D.C.’s mayoral election, introduced freshmen to #OnlyAtGW moments and outlined the values we’re looking for in its next leader.
Our mission isn’t to tell you what to think – it’s to tell you what to think about. Each weekly staff editorial is meant to inform our readers, advocate for their rights and challenge their beliefs. We don’t hesitate to outline the policies and programs we think are necessary for GW’s community, and we’re not afraid of holding officials accountable for their actions.
Eight members of The Hatchet’s staff are on this volume’s editorial board. Our various backgrounds and roles allow us to represent The Hatchet.
Meet the members of the editorial board:
Ethan Benn, a junior from Georgia majoring in journalism and mass communication, is the opinions editor. He runs the editorial board’s weekly meetings and co-writes the staff editorial. He focuses on how urban planning, public transportation and politics intersect to affect our lives.
Riley Goodfellow, a sophomore from California majoring in political science, is the contributing opinions editor. They co-write the staff editorial and help guide the weekly discussion. They often write about the LGBTQ+ community and reproductive justice.
Zachary Bestwick, a junior from the Carolinas majoring in political science, is a research assistant and opinions writer. He hopes to address issues that affect students’ academic experiences and their daily interactions with GW.
Nuria Diaz, a junior from Puerto Rico majoring in journalism and mass communication, is the sports editor. She is interested in the legacy of colonialism in the Caribbean, Spanish language misinformation and urban sustainability.
Jaden DiMauro, a junior from Connecticut majoring in English, is the copy editor. Coming from a household with two moms, he is deeply passionate about LGBTQ+ rights and focuses on issues like sustainability and ethical consumption.
Clara Duhon, a senior from New Jersey majoring in anthropology and international affairs, is the culture editor. She is passionate about uplifting the voices of marginalized communities through various forms of media and advocating for environmental justice.
Grace Miller, a junior from Virginia majoring in English, is the design editor. She is deeply passionate about environmentalism, gender equity and how the University should use its funding to better support students.
Ethan Valliath, a sophomore from New Jersey majoring in international affairs, is the contributing social media director. Alongside advocating for mental health awareness, he aims to address sustainability, healthcare and racial equity on campus.
Jarrod Wardwell, the editor in chief, sits in on our meetings and edits the staff editorial but does not offer his opinion. The editorial board also functions independently from the newsroom – they report the news separate from our discussions, and we discuss its importance without covering it firsthand.
This year’s editorial board features members from various walks of life, and our position allows us to speak on behalf of students like us. Still, we know we don’t represent the entire student body, which is why we aim to consider as many students’ identities, experiences and opinions as possible in our discussions. If that means taking unorthodox or controversial stances, we’ll take them. But if, or when, we get something wrong, we’ll acknowledge and correct our mistakes. When we receive new information or the story changes, we’ll update our views accordingly – previous editorial boards have retracted stances and rescinded endorsements, too.
We aren’t just the editorial board – we’re your editorial board, engaging in commentary and advocacy that’s relevant to our readers and meant to make them think about their community. If you disagree with us on a particular issue, we encourage you to either write a letter to the editor or an op-ed.
The Hatchet is an institution in and of itself, and we are proud of the contributions we have already made to this historic paper. Our platform gives us privilege and power, and we intend to use it to the fullest. For you and for ourselves, Volume 119’s editorial board looks forward to making sense of the news and advocating for change.
The editorial board consists of Hatchet staff members and operates separately from the newsroom. This week’s staff editorial was written by Opinions Editor Ethan Benn and Contributing Opinions Editor Riley Goodfellow, based on discussions with Research Assistant Zachary Bestwick, Sports Editor Nuria Diaz, Copy Editor Jaden DiMauro, Culture Editor Clara Duhon, Design Editor Grace Miller and Contributing Social Media Director Ethan Valliath.

Aaron Kronenberg, pictured falling into a slide, said GW has reorganized its lineup to fill openings that injuries have created, forcing several defensive players to practice at new attacking positions further up the field.
Men’s soccer is off to its best start in 17 seasons this fall with an unrelenting offense that has peppered the net with goals through their first stretch of non-conference play.
The Colonials (2-0-1) are undefeated after scoring eight goals on a .250 shooting percentage, more than doubling their goals per game and shot percentage from last season in their first three games. Star players like senior forward Tom Cooklin, junior defense Aaron Kronenberg and graduate student forward Oscar Haynes Brown have led the offense with a combined five goals.
The wins give GW its best start to a season since 2005, when the Colonials registered three wins and a tie during their first four games before going on to set a 6-8-3 record on the year.
Head Coach Craig Jones said the team is still “a work in progress” continuing to build its defense for tougher teams later in the season. In the Colonials’ most recent match against Columbia Friday, the team struggled to maintain ball possession, but the defense managed to hang on, only letting up one goal in a 2–1 victory.
“If we can take anything into that game, it’s that we can defend,” Jones said in a post-game interview on Saturday. “As a group, we did really well to defend, we could have done a lot of things a lot better, but we’re going to be in a situation where we’re hanging on to win.”
After a series of injuries among GW’s attacking players forced Jones to adjust the starting lineup at the start of the season, he hopes recent additions to the squad this fall will maintain the GW defense. The men’s soccer team has six newcomers, including newly emerging team leaders like defender Lucas Matuszewski, graduate transfer midfielder Connor Stephens, freshman forward Alex Nicholson and freshman midfielder Connor Braun who have shared increased left side play on the field.
After GW rushed to six goals in the first two matches, the Colonials’ offense lost steam against Columbia after scoring in the first 15 seconds of play. In their recent match against Columbia University, The Colonials struggled to surge ahead past the Lions, who outshot the GW team.
Jones said GW needs to make more stops on defense and extend their offensive possessions against tougher teams that challenge their starting lineup.
“Hopefully, we should win more games than we lose, and maybe today we didn’t because of the game, but in the past few games, we have created some chances of being cynical,” Jones said. “So that team is going to continue to improve, we can always improve, but I’m happy with the offensive stop.”
The Colonials began the nonconference season with a 2–2 tie against William and Mary on Aug. 19 before GW notched back-to-back wins against Manhattan College and Columbia University in respective 4–2 and 2–1 victories
Jones said injuries have sidelined four of the team’s starters – Cooklin, senior defense Jared DeMott, freshman defense Keni Winger and freshman defense Connor Braun. He said they have been unable to play complete games, but he plans to slowly return them to competition at full capacity.
Jones declined to share the nature of the injuries and the expected length of recovery for the players because of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act guidelines.
Senior midfielder Tiago Carvalho scored his first goal of his career against Columbia, hoping to continue capitalizing on scoring opportunities for the Colonials. He said the team hopes to better detect offensive plays from the opponents with a better mental game to stave off shots on goal as the season rolls on.
Carvalho said the team was caught playing defense in their own territory, overwhelmed by the Lions and unable to find their footing after their first goal of the match.
“I think for me, it also has to do with composure and not playing into the team’s hands,” Carvalho said in a post-game interview Friday. “We normally are a team that tries to play out of the buck, we try to play like good football or soccer, and today we kind of fell a little bit into the opposition team’s half. We didn’t really play out very much.”
Kronenberg, who scored his first goal of the season during the Colonial’s last match, said the team works in tandem to adjust to every opportunity with composure and organization, especially during more hectic games like the past Friday match against Columbia. He said the team has reorganized its lineup to fill open spots left by the team’s injuries, forcing several defensive players to practice at new attacking positions further up the field.
Kronenberg said the Colonials needs to focus on improving their chemistry on the field to complement one another instead of competing within the same team. 
“Something we definitely need to work on as set pieces, I feel that we should not compete with the group, and we just got to stay organized and got to stay composed,” Kronenberg said in a post-game interview on Friday. “We talk about that a lot, just have that clarity in your head, and it’s just something I feel like everyone can work on together.”
The team also holds a solid defensive showing, with senior goalkeeper Justin Grady snatching seven saves so far this season with a .583 save percentage, which places him at the top of the Colonial’s defense. He displayed an impressive showing against the Lions, where he held off 14 shots from the Lions, ensuring the Colonial’s win.
“We just want every team to make them feel that it’s just not comfortable to play against us,” Kronenberg said. “They go home and just shake their heads and don’t even know what happened, it’s just how we play.”
The Colonials hit the road Friday for a 7 p.m. contest at Navy. Kickoff is slated for 7 p.m.

Ever since hearing the long awaited news of the brand new Thurston Hall renovations, I started looking forward to knocking on my freshman year room – number 722. When I excitedly entered Thurston after its grand reopening and rode the elevator up to the 7th floor, I walked down the hall and passed rooms 720…721…723. I was shocked and thought I must have missed something – I searched in the next hallway, double and triple checking to see if the room numbers were out of order. But to my disappointment, room 722 was gone, a supply closet in its place, erasing the memory of my pre-COVID, pre-renovated Thurston Hall home.
Of course, I knew my old room would not be the same exact living space. The extensive remodeling project features an entirely altered floor plan complete with a stunning courtyard in the center of the building– a reimagined centerpiece to the facility that leaves its original form virtually unrecognizable. But still, I envisioned walking into the room where I once moved in on a hot August day in 2019 alongside other freshmen eager to dive into college. I imagined what the new occupants of my old room would be like – if I would find four girls packed into a far-too-tiny bedroom like myself and my former roommates – how they would decorate, where they would be from, what fields they would study.
Despite only staying in Thurston for about six months until the outbreak of the pandemic, living in the residence hall shaped my GW experience like nothing else. My freshman year was a tumultuous one and in no small part because of Thurston’s notorious black mold poisoning, infamous 2019 fire and overall chaotic character. But Thurston was also the place where I met some of my closest friends to this day.
A quintessential example of the Thurston experience came on a November evening, when I returned home after a closing shift at my retail job in Georgetown only to hear the fire alarm go off about 10 minutes later. Alarms were common in such a large building full of freshmen who triggered the smoke detector with anything from either contraband candles or an overcooked microwave meal, and any evacuation typically lasted only 15 minutes or so. But on this night, a fire triggered a sprinkler system that flooded several rooms on the floor, which displaced residents until the early hours of the morning and about 40 students more for weeks due to the flooding. But don’t worry – we got free pizza in the University Student Center!
Although chaotic events like this were undeniably stressful, inconvenient and raised questions about GW’s facilities management, they also bonded the Class of 2023. The hectic nature of living in Thurston defined our freshman year of college and GW culture as a whole.
Upon entering the remodeled building, the realization sunk in that these new, bright-eyed Thurston freshmen will never experience the mayhem that once came with living in this building. The current seniors are the only remaining students on campus who will ever understand what that experience was like. This year’s freshman class will have their own version of an inevitably hectic first year of college – the photo of a fish in a Thurston communal shower that surfaced during Orientation Week is proof. Their rooms are just as small, if not smaller, as their predecessors, but the structure originally built in 1929 no longer exists in the same way.
The renovation is undeniably a good thing – no student deserves to be exposed to black mold or displaced after a fire damages their room. Yet, this long overdue makeover of Thurston evoked a feeling of personal nostalgia. Seeing the shiny, new building made me realize that my time at GW is coming to an end this year, marked by the fact that my graduating class is the last to know the original Thurston. More than that, the GW I once knew is now a very different place, especially following two and a half semesters of virtual instruction and a campus drained of the life that has since returned in Thurston Hall.
Seeing the new and improved Thurston up close, although exciting and awe-inducing, symbolizes not only a significant change in GW campus culture but also the impending end of my time as a student here. For this reason, I understand that many members of the Class of 2023 may have conflicting opinions about the unveiling of the remodel. GW is continuing to improve and develop, albeit into a campus that drifts further away from the one that first welcomed us as wide-eyed freshmen three years ago.
Despite the seismic shifts in campus culture that seniors have witnessed throughout the past four years, GW is still a place to grow as students and individuals, whether inside the aged building that preceded much of our time here or the fancy new home to the Class of 2026. Incoming freshmen will get to experience the many rewards and challenges of college, too – just hopefully without any black mold poisoning.

Whether you're perched atop the Watergate Hotel or catching some riverside breeze at The Wharf, the views and drinks at these rooftop bars will not disappoint.
The District may not be known for towering buildings, but the city’s rooftop venues serve up gorgeous views above the D.C. streets with cocktails to sip alongside your friends.
Though a trip out for a drink can cost quite the fortune, the striking sights from some of the District’s rooftop bars are well worth the visit if you’re looking to treat yourself. From vantage points looking down upon the National Mall and across the Potomac River into Arlington, here are a few rooftop bars to visit for the ultimate sunset view while sipping on some creative cocktails.
The Rooftop at the Graham Georgetown
Admire the skyscrapers of Arlington and the steeples of Georgetown University from The Rooftop at the Graham Georgetown. This Instagrammable venue, complete with pink and white flowers draped from twisted branches hanging from the ceiling, is a gorgeous place to kick back and grab a few drinks. The bar’s homey atmosphere trades the mundane marble and concrete commonly seen in the District for rustic wood floors and brick walls. As you watch the sun dip below the Georgetown skyline, snag some tasty small bites like the sourdough bruschetta ($17) or the Thai tiger shrimp flatbread ($20), which incorporates coconut curry and Thai basil. For refreshing drinks that offer one last taste of summer, try the Roosevelt Island cocktail ($17), a mix of bourbon, vodka, iced tea and fresh lemon juice, or the Peach Paradise ($17) with flavored vodka, peach liqueur, elderflower and lemon.
1075 Thomas Jefferson Street NW. Open 4 to 10 p.m., Sunday to Wednesday, 4 p.m. to 12 a.m. Thursday to Saturday. 21+ only.
Vue Rooftop DC
If you’re looking for a more traditional view of D.C. with the National Mall’s finest sites, like the White House and the Washington Monument, look no further than Vue Rooftop DC. Perched on top of historic Hotel Washington, this rooftop is all about the glitz and glamor of downtown. Polished marble bar tops and plush light fixtures are the cherry on top of an already breathtaking experience. Chow down on some parmesan fries ($14) or some olives and country bread ($14) as a starter while you admire the perched view. Try Power to the Peaches ($22), a fruity mix of flavored vodkas, Cointreau, spritz, chamomile honey syrup and lemon for a bright, yet smooth sip.
515 15th St. NW. Open Monday to Thursday 5 p.m. to 12 a.m., Friday 5 p.m. to 2 a.m., Saturday 11 to 2 a.m. and Sunday 11 to 12 a.m.
El Techo
Didn’t get enough florals from The Rooftop at the Graham? Look no further than El Techo, a Latin-inspired rooftop bar in Shaw. You won’t find the same grand views as the two previous entries on this list, but the bar offers refuge from the monotonous city blocks outside. You’ll find tons of color throughout the space, from bright yellow chairs to green foliage coating the walls to pink and white flowers hanging from the ceiling. The bar even has decorations sourced straight from Mexico, completing its “Latin jungle vacation-transporting” theme. Sip on a Cinnamon Old Fashioned ($13) while you munch on some carne asada ($5.24) or pork carnitas ($4.49) tacos. Try the papaya or passion fruit margarita for $10 during happy hour on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays from open to 6:30 p.m.
606 Florida Ave. NW. Open Monday to Thursday 5 p.m. to 12 a.m., Friday 5 p.m. to 1:30 a.m., Saturday 12 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. and Sunday 12 to 11 p.m.

The Student Court will consider the original complaint and Zidouemba’s response in a private meeting Sunday evening.
Student Association President Christian Zidouemba and his SA legal counsel responded Saturday in a written answer and motion for dismissal to the complaint filed against them last week in the Student Court, contending he is not the legitimate SA president.
In response to former Executive Chief of Staff Cordelia Scales’s complaint that alleged Zidouemba is not the legitimate president of the SA – Andrew Harding, the legislator general, and Juan Carlos Mora, the chief counselor to the SA Senate – wrote that because both chiefs of staff did not vote to remove Zidouemba in July, he had right to the presidency and the right to terminate Scales immediately after the power struggle. The defendants also motioned for the court to officially assert that Zidouemba is president and declare Scales is no longer chief of staff.
Scales said in a statement to The Hatchet that her team is working on opposition to the defense’s motion to dismiss and that she hopes to have a “full hearing” before the court.
Five members of Zidouemba’s executive cabinet, including Scales, voted in early July to remove Zidouemba as president under Article 15 of the SA Constitution, claiming he created a “hostile” work environment and was unfit to lead. But two executive cabinet members withdrew their votes one day later and declared that Zidouemba would retain the presidency.
The defendants wrote that all individuals holding the titles specified in Article 15 of the SA Constitution – which include the chief of staff, communications director, vice president, treasurer and legislator general – had to be present for the removal vote to be valid.
During the July removal vote, Keanu Rowe, one of the two chiefs of staff, was not present for the removal vote. But all the title holders specified in Article 15 – including Scales, one of the chiefs of staff – voted for Zidouemba’s removal.
“The only other individual who could have fulfilled the role sought by [Scales] is Mr. Rowe, and he was neither present at the meeting where the vote was taken, nor did he consent to the temporary removal,” the motion reads.
The defendants also argue that the removal vote was a temporary action, not a vote permanently ousting Zidouemba from the presidency. The defendants contend that because Article 15 allows the executive cabinet to hold removal votes up to three times throughout a presidency, these removals must be temporary.
The defendants wrote that Zidouemba “did not violate any rights or cause any injustice” to Scales, so Zidouemba requested the court dismiss the case.
The defendants argued Scales is not entitled to the chief of staff position because even if she was wrongfully terminated, she resigned afterward. The defendants attached evidence that Scales resigned after Zidouemba sent the email firing her, arguing her resignation nullifies a part of her case.
“Even if Mr. Zidouemba was temporarily removed from office, [Scales] issued a public resignation on July 2, 2022, thus mooting [her] claim that she was wrongfully terminated,” the motion reads.
The Student Court will consider the original complaint and Zidouemba’s response in a private meeting Sunday evening. Scales and her team have until Sept. 6 at 11:59 p.m. to formally respond, but the court will consider anything submitted before 5:00 p.m. in their meeting tonight, Chief Justice Devin Eager said in an email.
