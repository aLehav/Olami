Senior Ryan Tavares met his girlfriend, Manuela Lopez-Restrepo, on Hinge, and spoke with her for weeks virtually before meeting her in person.
In early March, then-freshman Caroline Nystrum had gone on her first two dates with her future boyfriend. Then, the COVID-19 pandemic forced Nystrum home.
Nystrum said her relatively new connection turned into a long-distance relationship almost overnight, and the two began to keep in touch over the next half year over Snapchat and texts. Six months later, the two moved back to the District and made their relationship official.
“We were always looking toward the future and looking for something to hold on to,” Nystrum said. “We were both just so hopeful to see each other again that we kept it going.”
Without classrooms or bars to meet people, students said they’ve turned to dating apps like Hinge to find dates or locked in connections they had already made in person before the COVID-19 pandemic. Students said they leaned on social media and texts to make their relationships work, and those dating new people over the past year became more cautious about the number of people they were seeing romantically.
Meeting via dating apps
Dating app use soared last March, when most college-aged students were first sent home during the initial wave of COVID-19 cases.
Per a friend’s suggestion, senior Ryan Tavares said he downloaded Hinge and met his girlfriend, Manuela Lopez-Restrepo, a senior at University of Maryland, on the app in August. Lopez-Restrepo said they chatted virtually for a few weeks before meeting up in person.
She said she wanted to ensure she could trust that Tavares was abiding by coronavirus guidelines, especially since she was living with her parents.
“I could tell we got along, it was more like, ‘Can I trust this person’s judgment?’” Lopez-Restrepo said. “’Do I trust them being honest with me about where they’ve been and what they’ve been doing’?”
During a FaceTime call before they met in person, she said the two clicked instantly and made concrete plans to meet in person. For their first date, Tavares brought pasta and Lopez-Restrepo brought homemade pesto for a picnic at Malcolm X Park.
Shortly after the two began to see each other, they became exclusive. Tavares said he was caught off guard at first, but Lopez-Restrepo said sticking to each other would be safer than dating others given the public health crisis.
“I understood where she was coming from, but also it was two weeks into the relationship and I was like, ‘Oh wow, that’s intense,’” Tavares said. “But I’m also like, ‘Who else do I want to talk to right now? This is the only person that I’m enjoying talking to.’ So I don’t see a problem with it.”
The couple added that they’re not sure they would have dated if the pandemic didn’t happen. They had matched on Tinder last year and attended some of the same concerts in New York City, but it wasn’t until they matched again on Hinge while living in D.C. that they decided to give it a shot. 
“I have a philosophy that we were sort of meant to meet now and as the current versions of ourselves,” Lopez-Restrepo said. “I don’t know if me a year ago would have had this connection with Ryan.”
Moving date night outside
Outdoor dates have become a go-to for couples who met for the first time during the pandemic.
Lauren Ofman, a junior and former Hatchet reporter, said dating over the past year has forced her to be more conscious about planning safe dates.
“It’s been so interesting dating during a pandemic, because you have to move really fast, you know, you have to go from dating to essentially doing nothing together and having to be really creative with what you choose to do,” Ofman said.
Ofman said she occasionally used Hinge while she was home in Los Angeles last spring but started using it more seriously once she moved back to D.C. in June, when she met her boyfriend Jon on the app. She was nervous to meet up with Jon in person given the circumstances of the pandemic, but after some convincing from her roommate, she decided to go.
“With the pandemic, I was really terrified to just go meet a stranger out,” Ofman said. “I would be very, very selective of who I would go out with.”
For their first few dates, they ate dinner outside at the Georgetown Waterfront and went for a walk at the National Mall. Ofman said they bonded over their affinity for the Trader Joe’s frozen food section and became a couple within the first few weeks of dating.
Since the cold weather kicked in, Ofman said it’s been more challenging to think of date ideas that are both safe and fun. She said she and her boyfriend enjoy visiting Union Market and checking out fixer-upper houses for sale on weekends.
“It’s possible for people to get through a relationship now as long as they pursue it safely and can feel confident that they can still be creative with their partner to have fun and do things even during this horrible time,” Ofman said.
Making long distance work
What started with an Instagram comment turned into a multi-month holding pattern for senior George Glass and his girlfriend, sophomore Carolina Fujiy-Vieira.
The two were familiar with each other from mutual friends and their biology class last spring, but they didn’t begin chatting over on social media until Glass commented on one of Fujiy-Vieira’s Instagram posts.
“We were both just curious about each other,” Glass said. “I remember she posted a picture on Instagram. I was like, ‘It’s a pretty cool picture,’ I commented something and then I think a week after that she slid into my DMs and said, ‘You’re going to comment on this picture before you slide into my DMs?’”
After being sent home from school in mid-March, Fujiy-Vieira was living in California and Glass in Virginia. They talked daily, and after two months, Fujiy-Vieira said they both recognized they were more than friends, but they wanted to ensure the in-person connection was just as strong.
“It was nine months, and I was really tired, you know what I mean?” Fujiy-Vieira said. “Like we either need to start dating or just end this because it was too much for me.”
The couple hung out for the first time in person in November – Fujiy-Vieira flew from California to D.C. to visit some friends and Glass drove up from Virginia Beach to spend the day with her. The duo said they grabbed lunch at Tonic and walked around campus and found that the connection was there, but they didn’t officially go public with their relationship until last month.
The couple said that setting aside time to chat has made their long distance relationship work.
“One of the earlier things that at least I had to learn was that respect for time,” Glass said. “It’s so much easier in person for us to say ‘OK, meet me here at 7 p.m.’”
Fujiy-Vieira said she recently moved to Philadelphia, which allows the couple to talk without a difference in time zones. They said they also try to visit each other once per month – Glass is planning to visit Fujiy-Vieira for Valentine’s Day.
“Overall, it’s been worth it,” Glass said. “And if we can make it through a pandemic together, I’d like to see what else life can throw at us.”

Traffic incidents on campus are concentrated on Pennsylvania Avenue and 19th, 23rd and H streets.
The District Department of Transportation released a map late last month offering a first-ever look at the spread and cause of traffic injuries and fatalities on campus.
The map pinpoints the time, place and location of every traffic injury and death since 2017 and shows traffic crashes in Foggy Bottom have plunged by about 60 percent, from nearly 1,400 in 2017 to fewer than 600 in 2020. Transportation experts said the map can help city leaders and locals identify safety concerns and craft solutions like tightening enforcement, lowering speed limits and creating bike lanes to protect pedestrians and bicyclists from traffic injuries in Foggy Bottom.

DDOT officials released the interactive map late last month through Vision Zero DC, an initiative that aims to eliminate traffic deaths and serious injuries by 2024. The map displays traffic deaths and injuries and reports whether they impacted drivers, passengers, cyclists or pedestrians.
The data, updated every Friday, show traffic injuries on campus concentrated along Pennsylvania Avenue and 19th, 23rd and H streets, mostly consisting of pedestrian injuries.
Peter Savolainen, a professor of civil engineering at Michigan State University, said the skew toward pedestrian over vehicular injuries in Foggy Bottom corresponds with a nationwide trend in fatalities involving commuters outside of a vehicle. He said the transportation community has promoted walking over driving because of the health benefits, but that leaves more commuters prone to more severe injuries and a higher chance of death during crashes.
“You are also at significantly greater risk of fatalities if you are involved in a traffic crash, and that just gets back to the physics that are involved,” Savolainen said. “If we are struck by another vehicle, and we are in a car, that’s not going to have as drastic an impact as if we are walking or bicycling.”
He said crashes have also been linked to distracted walking and driving from pedestrians and drivers using cell phones in past years.
“You are putting yourself at risk in those circumstances, and accidents happen all the time where people are just walking and they are not paying attention,” Savolainen said.
DDOT spokespersons Lauren Stephens and Mariam Nabizad did not return multiple requests for comment.
The DDOT map shows that Foggy Bottom and West End neighborhoods saw six “major” and 71 minor injuries with zero deaths caused by traffic crashes last calendar year, compared to two deaths and 15 major and 207 minor injuries the year before.
Since 2017, 10 minor pedestrian accidents occurred along 19th Street, and eight minor injuries occurred on 23rd Street. With more than 90 traffic accidents documented over the past decade on the portion of H Street running through campus, DDOT data show only eight crashes in 2020, following the trend of accidents continually decreasing in the area.
Ward 2 experienced a four-year low in traffic accidents on and near campus in 2019, and the trend continued in 2020 with a nearly 52 percent decrease in major and minor injuries, according to the data.
In 2019, two of the 12 pedestrian fatalities in D.C. occurred during an incident outside The Shops at 2000 Penn, and 23rd Street has also been a frequent area for traffic crashes due to the difficulty navigating Washington Circle when attempting to exit and merge lanes.
James Moore, a professor of engineering at the University of Southern California, said the Metropolitan Police Department should consistently enforce its traffic laws by increasing police presence at night to reduce speeding. He said increasing the police’s enforcement will lead to “good behavior” from drivers.
“We pay the police,” he said. “I would go ahead and enforce traffic laws.”
Moore said DDOT has “laudable” objectives, but eliminating traffic deaths entirely is “unrealistic.” He said DDOT officials would have to make “tradeoffs,” like increasing travel delays and congestion in hopes of considerably slashing fatalities.
“We have got to carefully and analytically trade off the costs of saving lives and thinking very specifically about how we are doing that against the costs of increased travel delays for everyone, which could be in the aggregate very considerable,” he said. “Lives are not infinitely valuable. They are valuable, but if they are infinitely valuable, we would never allow an aircraft to take off.”

Provost Brian Blake said at a Faculty Senate meeting last month that cluster hires are a good idea, but the University's financial expenditure during the pandemic might hurt those efforts.
An informal group of department chairs and program directors is in discussions with officials about enacting a “cluster hire” of underrepresented faculty and increasing funding for the Africana studies program.
Joined by faculty, the group is circulating a petition calling on administrators to hire 18 minority faculty members “primarily” in the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences and provide enough funding for the Africana studies program to convert into its own department with a permanent director within the next three years. Professors said conversations that began last summer about deficiencies in funding, faculty and support in the Africana studies program sparked their calls for a broader cluster hire in CCAS.
As of Monday, the petition had gathered almost 850 signatures.
Jennifer James, an associate professor of English and a former director of the Africana studies program, said CCAS has struggled to retain Black faculty members in the past. Black and Latino professors have cited the absence of a “robust” community for underrepresented faculty, the “chronically underfunded” Africana studies program and a “perceived lack of commitment” for Black and Latino studies as reasons for leaving GW, according to the petition.
“Our faculty should reflect the composition of our nation and our students but, instead, it is overwhelmingly White,” the petition states.
James said administrators should demonstrate their support for Black faculty members and students by listening to “longstanding” requests about onboarding more professors of color, especially in light of nationwide Black Lives Matter protests this summer.
She said without more faculty of color, GW misses out on opportunities to deliver a “premier education” that students deserve and that other universities with more diverse faculty can offer.
“Students are robbed of the chance to be exposed to the diverse perspectives and research faculty of color offer,” James said in an email.
James said she led the group of department chairs and program directors to draft and send an initial letter of their concerns to Provost Brian Blake and CCAS Dean Paul Wahlbeck last fall. She said she and other faculty hope officials may be receptive to their initiatives, based on a meeting they had with the dean’s office and email exchanges with the provost’s office.
“No promises have been made, but they are not the villains in this story,” she said. “In fact, both Provost Blake and Dean Wahlbeck have indicated that the recruitment and retention of faculty of color has been on their minds. We believe that we can work together to move GW into its future.”
Gordon Mantler, the executive director of the University Writing Program, said the GW community has been “enthusiastically” responding to the petition so far. He said many of GW’s peer schools have taken similar actions to support diversity within their faculty.
Seven of GW’s peer schools have implemented similar cluster hires during the pandemic, like the University of Pittsburgh, Northeastern University and the University of Miami.
“They all are taking on hiring efforts over several years, making a real commitment to this kind of effort and putting resources behind it, so we think that GW should be doing that as well,” Mantler said.
Mantler added that the petition will be formally sent to University President Thomas LeBlanc and Blake sometime later this month, but faculty have not yet decided when they will officially close the petition.
“I’m excited about the possibility of doing this and I just hope that despite all of the other challenges we’re facing, we don’t use budgets as an excuse not to do this and to make this happen,” he said.
Blake said at a Faculty Senate meeting in January that he is a “big fan” of cluster hires, but it would be “hard” to implement one this year because of the uncertainty of the fall semester.
“We’re probably not going to make those hires in that way during a pandemic, and as a matter of fact as we come out of this, hopefully during the summer, I think we can kind of look at the fall as the new hiring season to look at that proposal,” he said.
Officials implemented a hiring freeze across the University last March due to financial concerns regarding the pandemic. Faculty said the freeze has limited course offerings this semester because departments have been unable to hire as many part-time faculty.
LeBlanc and Blake announced last week that an external firm will conduct a diversity audit of GW this semester to assess and organize diversity-related reforms, using recommendations from the Black Student Union’s “State of GW” report. Officials said the study, which will be completed by late spring, will help officials develop an “action plan” to track GW’s progress of its diversity and inclusion efforts.
But Alexander Dent, the chair of the anthropology department, said administrators should not use the diversity audit as a diversion from tangible proposals, like the cluster hire.
He said faculty are already aware of the need to hire more Black and Latino faculty members. Underrepresented minority faculty have constituted about 8 to 9 percent of all tenured or tenure-track faculty over the past decade, according to the petition and institutional planning data. 
“Given that we already know we need to diversify our faculty and don’t really need a study to tell us that – our petition contains the numbers – why not get started on the cluster hire while we’re looking at the problem in more detail?” he said.
LeBlanc said at a Board of Trustees meeting Friday that officials will not be “standing still” while the audit is underway this semester.
“We will continue to work with urgency on those areas that we already know require our attention, including faculty diversity, financial aid, policies and police engagement,” he said.

GW's bicentennial celebration will kick off Tuesday with a virtual event featuring alumnae, like Kerry Washington, Dana Bash and Reena Ninan.
Officials are kicking off celebrations this week to mark the official bicentennial of GW’s founding on Feb. 9, 1821.
The University will begin its bicentennial celebration Tuesday, exactly 200 years after Congress passed the school’s charter, with a virtual opening ceremony followed by a monthslong event series designed to celebrate the achievements of students, faculty, staff and alumni. The celebrations will begin virtually, but officials have said they hope to conclude in person at Colonials Weekend in early October.
“Our success was never inevitable nor preordained,” the University bicentennial website states. “Through the persistence of generations of students, faculty, staff and alumni, GW has become a top comprehensive global research university in the heart of the nation’s capital.”
Sarah Baldassaro, the interim vice president for communications and marketing, said the event series aims to highlight the progress of the University through storytelling, signature events and a range of engagement campaigns with GW community members.
“We will also highlight how we are leading to a greater world and look ahead to our third century of leadership,” Baldassaro said at a Board of Trustees meeting Friday. “The GW community embraces the challenges of solving the world’s most urgent problems.”
Here is what’s in store for the University’s monthslong celebration:
Opening ceremony
The kickoff “Charter Day” ceremony will take place on Tuesday at 4 p.m., featuring prominent alumni as well as University President Thomas LeBlanc and former University Presidents Steven Knapp and Stephen Joel Trachtenberg. The three presidents, past and present, will be joined by journalist and 2001 alumna Reena Ninan to discuss the highlights of GW’s history.
Provost Brian Blake, Board of Trustees Chair Grace Speights, alumna and actress Kerry Washington and alumna and CNN anchor Dana Bash will also attend the event.
Vice President for Development and Alumni Relations Donna Arbide said more than 4,100 people have registered as of Friday, and the kickoff ceremony will be followed by an “intimate gathering” online with a few key leaders and philanthropists.
Members of the University community can register online to attend the free, virtual opening ceremony by visiting the bicentennial website.
Monthslong event series
Following the opening ceremony, members of the GW community can attend a range of events celebrating the University’s bicentennial through October.
“Many of the events are featuring GW’s many established alumni, students and faculty,” Arbide said. “The calendar is sent through October 2021, but we will really continue to be unveiling and surprising everyone with our guests, so keep your ears open.”
An event calendar shared at the Board meeting Friday included five events during February: the opening ceremony, a MasterClass Feb. 17 presented by EMILY’s List President Stephanie Schriock, a weekend-long series of athletics games between Feb. 19 and Feb. 21, “200 Years of George Washington University” and an installment of the Presidential Distinguished Event Series Feb. 22.
“This historic anniversary is an opportunity to remember and reflect on our rich history while building excitement toward building a greater world,” Arbide said. “It’s a chance to tell our story and engage the GW community.”
Alumni honors
GW Alumni Association President Richard Jones said plans for alumni outreach will directly tie into the bicentennial story once the celebrations begin.
Administrators said GW also recruited 180 alumni to be bicentennial ambassadors. The ambassadors will focus on advertising bicentennial events on social media and connecting with students, Jones said.
“For the spring, the GW Alumni Association wants to expand our virtual alumni engagement around GW’s bicentennial celebration but also through bicentennial volunteerism and bicentennial distinguished alumni recognition award,” he said at the Board meeting.
Officials said they plan to honor some of GW’s most successful alumni with a new recognition. The Monumental Alumni Award, created for the bicentennial celebration, will recognize living alumni who have had “an impact on the world” and embody the values of the University.
Jones said the award will recognize 76 living alumni who have had a lasting impact on their industry or the world. He said recipients of the award will be announced in GW Magazine in March, and he is hopeful that they can come to an in-person event during Colonials Weekend in the fall to receive their awards.
He added that GW will host four “distinguished alumni lectures” discussing the critical issues of the world during the spring and summer. He said the first event is slated for March 25.
“It will be a discussion about our global footprint and role in global events,” Jones said.

Undergraduate tuition will increase by no more than 3 percent next year, while graduate tuition will change based on program, trustees said.
Updated: Feb. 10, 2020 at 11:29 p.m.
Trustees said they will decide on next year’s cost of attendance in the coming weeks, a delay from the typical approval at the Board of Trustees’ February meeting, as a result of financial uncertainty brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Board approved a recommendation Friday to increase the cost of attendance by no more than 3 percent for undergraduates next year but did not vote on an exact pricing model. The Board also approved the graduate program pricing model for next academic year, with an average cost increase of 2.8 percent.
“This is a very complex discussion, given that we all know along with every other industry in the world, higher education, too, is changing,” Ellen Zane, the chair of the committee on finance and investments, said at the Board meeting. “Understanding how we marry pricing with strategy as we evolve is a significant challenge that we are going to be looking at very hard.”
The graduate program pricing model will increase most programs between 1 percent and 3.7 percent, Zane said.
Trustees increased undergraduate tuition by 3 percent last year but later approved a 10 percent tuition discount during remote instruction. Administrators also eliminated GW’s fixed tuition policy beginning with the Class of 2024.
The Board has historically approved the following year’s cost of attendance at their regular February meeting but moved up the vote to October in 2018. Trustees have not maintained the accelerated timeline during the past two years.
The Board said in a statement following the meeting that University President Thomas LeBlanc and other officials have done “great work” managing the challenges of the pandemic.
“On the completion of the February Board meetings, including a comprehensive update on the status of the University, the Board of Trustees commends President LeBlanc and his leadership team for the great work they continue to do managing effects of the pandemic to secure the University’s future,” the Board said in the statement. “The University leadership has the deepest appreciation and gratitude of the Board.”
LeBlanc has faced criticism from many in the University community over financial decisions related to the pandemic, including layoffs and a temporary suspension of retirement contributions. The results of a faculty-wide survey assessing LeBlanc’s leadership abilities are expected to be made public later this month.
Student Association President Brandon Hill, who was sworn in late last month following the resignation of former SA President Howard Brookins, told trustees at the meeting that he plans to build integrity, transparency and justice during his time as president.
“I intend to break with my predecessor and build new and improved relationships with you all on the Board of Trustees,” Hill said. “If my years of student advocacy as a senator and executive vice president have shown me anything, it is that we do better with students and administrators working together instead of lambasting each other on social media and in The Hatchet.”
Board Chair Grace Speights openly sparred with Brookins at the October Board meeting over his calls for the University community to suspend donations to GW until LeBlanc resigns. Speights said she had a “great conversation” with Hill Thursday to discuss his goals for the remainder of the term.
“There have been some difficult challenges, obviously, at the Student Association,” Speights said in an interview. “But I believe that Brandon moving forward will overcome those challenges and move forward to be a partner with the University.”
Speights said she appreciated Hill’s eagerness for the SA to be a “partner” with the University.
“There may be things that we disagree on, and we can disagree – that’s fine,” she said. “But in doing so, we can be professional and civil to each other.”
She added that she and Hill discussed the SA’s mid-year report, which Speights later shared with trustees.
“I was amazed by all of the work that had been done by the Student Association,” Speights said. “Oftentimes when there are challenges or controversy, good work can be overshadowed by that.”
Hill said the Board is “always welcome” to work and partner with the SA.
“Spearheaded by the ideals of curiosity, compassion and creativity, I am confident that our aspirations will become reality,” he said.
Richard Jones, the GW Alumni Association president, said the group hopes to raise $14 million through annual giving programs this year, an increase of $1 million from the annual average over the past three years. Officials are focusing their efforts on soliciting donations online while decreasing phone outreach to optimize donation levels, he said.
“We actually raised more money this fall than we did in the fall of 2019, and our typical best giving time of the year is in the spring, so we’re very optimistic about reaching a $14 million goal,” he said.
Jones added that GW retained 47 percent of alumni donors in 2020 – a slight increase from 45 percent the year prior. The University has struggled to attract alumni donors in recent years compared to its peer schools.
He said officials are also preparing for GW’s first-ever giving day on April 7 to increase donations in conjunction with the bicentennial celebration.
“It is a University-wide giving day, including alumni dollar badges to incentivize contributions,” Jones said.
The Board also approved a rewritten Code of Ethical Conduct for the University to replace the existing Statement of Ethical Principles, which Speights said was implemented as part of a routine review.

Students said spending time in wide-open spaces outside has helped alleviate some of the mental stress that comes with being cooped up inside all day.
After his favorite Karaoke bar, “Big Mikes,” closed in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Michael Fantuazzo brought his musical hobby to Gelman Library.
Fantuazzo, a third-year law student who lives off campus with his dog, Fry, said without in-person social events to attend, he used Facebook Live to stream his Karaoke performances to fight feelings of isolation. He said he held a Facebook Live charity karaoke event outside of Gelman for his birthday in December, which raised money for Doctors Without Borders, and held another performance the day before the inauguration.
“In this time, you have got to celebrate the moments,” Fantuazzo said. “If 2020 was about ‘We have to shut everything down,’ I think 2021 has got to be about ‘We have to let the show go on,’ with protocols of course.”
Students said they’ve felt heightened levels of stress and anxiety dealing with online class and staying inside more than usual. Blaire is one of seven students who said in interviews that they’ve leaned on hobbies like chess and yoga to keep their spirits up as the pandemic rages on.
Fantuazzo said he set up a karaoke livestream in Gelman the day before President Joe Biden’s inauguration to cope with the anxiety and fear he felt about the potential for violence that day. He added that he frequents Black Lives Matter Plaza with his dog to alleviate his sense of loneliness.
“We have all of this open outdoor space, and we should be doing more events, like outdoor singing,” he said. “That’s something you can really space out but people can enjoy. People can bring a chair to the lawn. I would really love it if people tried to commit to more of that.”
Nyle Hutchinson, a sophomore majoring in psychology, said he’s been playing chess and meditating to cope with the stress he feels without friends nearby for emotional support. He said he lived at home in New York for the fall semester and is now living in on-campus housing.
“When you do positive things and have a positive attitude, it makes you want the best for yourself, so you work harder, and when you work harder, you feel better so it creates the potential for a very great cycle,” Hutchinson said.
He said when he was at home in the New York City area, he took hikes with his friends in Central Park, where he worked as a surveyor. He said students who are currently struggling with mental health should take the pandemic one day at a time and reach out to trusted friends or a counselor for help.
Students can call Counseling and Psychological Services every day between noon and 4 p.m. if they need to meet with a therapist and can call at any time outside of business hours for urgent needs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 75 percent of Americans between the ages of 18 and 24 have experienced poor mental health tied to the pandemic.
“Really all you can do is today, so make the most of today so that your tomorrow will be just a little bit better, and sooner or later you will be ready for the future you were so worried about,” he said.
April Mihalovich, a senior majoring in criminal justice, said she’s taking classes at her home in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Mihalovich said the virtual class setting this year has given her the opportunity to have a more flexible schedule, but she’s had trouble adding structure to her day.
“It’s definitely difficult not being able to perform the acts of getting up, getting ready, making my own meals, walking to class and things like that because having that routine and freedom to come and go from my dorm or wherever I’m living is definitely something that helped me take some space for myself,” she said.
Victoria Akinwande, a freshman majoring in political science and economics, said attending virtual classes and completing assignments entirely online from her home in Indianapolis has made her feel fatigued.
“Zoom has become this world where you can’t put down the controller because it’s a live game and you can’t pause it,” she said. “And you have these assignments due that are virtual that need to be completed, and you have all of these responsibilities in the real world too.”
Akinwande said making time to break away from computer work, take mental check-ins and talk to her mom and grandmother has helped her maintain her mental health.
“I say ‘OK, I’m stopping. This is my stopping point right now. I’m going to watch Netflix, eat some food, drink some water, do whatever I need to do to get back to my base point and then I can start doing work again,’” she said.
JJ Yu, an undecided freshman who is currently completing virtual classes from Korea, said she is 14 hours ahead of her professors teaching in D.C., and the time difference prevents her from attending classes synchronously.
She said watching class recordings instead of attending sessions live has made it difficult for her to meet her classmates, but she uses her classes’ GroupMe chats to connect with peers and coordinate study sessions that can work with her schedule.
“Because my classes are recordings, I don’t see my classmates’ faces,” she said. “I don’t study with them. I’m just alone. It’s my own thing. But if I make the study session and go, we talk to each other, we see each other, so it’s better.”

Jason Zara, a co-chair of the task force, said some elements of remote instruction during the pandemic may prove helpful or useful in the post-pandemic era.
Officials formed an 18-member task force late last month to examine and determine the future of the University’s academic environment in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Administrators said the Post-COVID Academic Innovation Task Force will investigate lessons learned from teaching during the public health crisis. Provost Brian Blake said the task force will seek ideas and feedback from “a broad range of sources,” including University personnel and the academic community outside of GW, to submit a finalized list of recommendations to him by late May.
“It also will study emerging literature on the post-pandemic higher education landscape and embrace any ideas or opportunities regarding course delivery, short-term academic experiences like certificate programs, our academic calendar and the research enterprise,” Blake said.
Blake said in an email announcing the task force in December that all academic planning groups, including the post-COVID task force, would be “at minimum” 75 percent faculty and would be chaired by a faculty member.
University President Thomas LeBlanc said he hopes to explore new opportunities once classes are held in person again to make study abroad programs easier for more students to participate in, potentially allowing them to take virtual courses while living outside of the United States. He said he also expects faculty members to continue to hold their office hours virtually and consider holding virtual classes in the event of inclement weather.
Blake said the task force will also review “previous academic innovation work from the GW community,” like lessons learned from GW’s now-obsolete strategic planning process.
LeBlanc announced the launch of a new University strategic plan in September 2019, which included pillars of distinguished and distinctive graduate education, high-quality undergraduate education, world-class faculty and high-impact research.
The undergraduate education committee made recommendations last February to eliminate negative perceptions about introductory STEM courses and improve academic advising, while the graduate education committee made recommendations to improve mental health and financial aid services for graduate students.
Pamela Jeffries, the dean of the School of Nursing and one of the co-chairs of the task force, said the members will aim to generate data and knowledge about the GW community’s “academic innovations and instructional continuity” due to the pandemic and to make “data-driven recommendations” to better fulfill the University’s academic mission.
She said while the task force is currently working on gathering information and is in the “preliminary stages of data exploration,” the work will be collaborative with those involved in the strategic planning committees last year. She said members of the task force will invite the co-leaders of all of the strategic planning committees to speak and present their findings to the task force in the near future.
“The work is only beginning,” she said in an email. “For now, the committee desires to review the reports from the GW strategic plan documents that were put on hold in April due to the pandemic along with other information from surveys that have been completed by faculty, staff and students during the past 11 months in the pandemic.”
Jason Zara, a professor of biomedical engineering and the other co-chair of the task force, said higher education institutions have “done a great deal of work” in adapting to the virtual learning environment and hope to determine which of those changes will be implemented in the long term.
“There are undoubtedly numerous innovations and practices that have been developed that can make GW better even after the pandemic has passed,” he said in an email.
After officials moved classes online for the semester due to the pandemic, faculty said virtual learning helped them develop new teaching strategies to optimize the time they had in class with their students.
Zara said students will be involved with the task force — officials have selected an undergraduate student and are in the process of adding a graduate student.
“As we start to do the work, we are planning to open additional opportunities for more students and faculty to contribute on the working groups,” he said.
Zara said he is approaching the task force with an “open mind” and will actively seek the University’s input and be transparent about the task force’s findings.
“We are committed to working to gather input from as many voices as possible,” he said. “We are all very excited to see what innovations can come from the GW community to make how we operate in the future more effective.”

GW Hillel is connecting students with senior citizens eligible, but unable, to sign up for a COVID-19 vaccine.
GW Hillel is working with a D.C. community center to help senior citizens register for and receive their COVID-19 vaccinations.
In collaboration with the Edlavitch D.C. Jewish Community Center, Hillel launched the Vaccine Sign-Up Support Project last month, which pairs senior citizens with student volunteers who walk them through the process to sign up for the vaccine. Volunteers said the program eases seniors’ stress of navigating the network of vaccination centers online.
Adena Kirstein, the executive director of GW Hillel, said she began the program after talking with friends from the community center who expressed frustrations about seniors struggling to secure vaccine appointments. Kirstein said she thought the program would be “amazing” to launch through Hillel, which would recruit tech savvy college students who could better deal with glitches or complications on the COVID-19 vaccine registration page.
“We figured, ‘What an amazing match right? ‘Let’s recruit these volunteers,’” Kirstein said. “At the beginning, we were really just trying to test the waters to see what the interest level would be, and it has just blown up beyond our imagination.”
Mayor Muriel Bowser announced last month that seniors above the age of 65 could receive a vaccine through the District’s health department website. The website became overbooked with registrations within a few hours and experienced problems with registering seniors.
Kirstein said the program has recruited more than 100 student volunteers on its sign up form shared through Hillel’s social media, weekly newsletter and word of mouth. She said the program eases seniors’ stresses looking for centers with open appointments and gives them a chance to talk with someone if they’ve been feeling isolated through quarantine.
She said Hillel has been matching students with seniors just at the community center so far, but she has been contacted by other local senior citizen communities hoping to pair their seniors with available volunteers.
“We’re trying to think really intentionally while also quickly about either how we can package the model so others can easily use it or how we can create systems where the turnaround time is quick enough and efficient enough that we can accommodate even more seniors,” Kirstein said.
Kevin Place, the associate producer at the community center, said the program has been promoted to community members via email. He said in the last month, the program has successfully registered more than 40 seniors for a COVID-19 vaccine and paired more than 200 other seniors with students walking them through their registration.
He said some seniors who originally signed up for the program had already received an appointment date by the time a student reached out and did not need help.
He said Kirstein updates a shared document daily for volunteers to check which distribution centers have available vaccine appointments in their partner’s area. He and Kirstein also led a training with volunteers on Zoom about how to speak with seniors and tips for navigating technological issues before they were paired, Place said.
“All of our future plans are based on the idea that we’re going to serve each individual who comes to us with as much care as we possibly can,” he said. 
Senior Rachel Amran, a student volunteer, said she has helped at least five seniors register for a vaccine appointment. She said the program pairs her with two new seniors every other day whom she calls over the phone to ask whether they’ve successfully registered for a vaccine and to work to get them pre-registered for an appointment if not.
Amran said the program eases the stress of seniors who do not feel comfortable using a computer to research their state’s distribution plan or open vaccine centers. She said she learned about Virginia and Maryland’s vaccine distribution plans after being paired with seniors from the center who lived outside of D.C. and were confused about the sign-up process.
“It’s great that people are actually wanting to get help and feel that they could find support in Hillel,” Amran said. “I had a conversation today with one woman who said that she knew the call was coming but she was really happy that she and I talked and I had her pre-registered because it made her feel a lot more comfortable.”
Jonathan Kempner, a community center member from Maryland who was helped through Hillel, said he was “anxious” to receive a vaccine and return to his job in Boston, which would not allow him to work in person until he was vaccinated. He said he struggled to find an available appointment because of a shortage of vaccines in his home state.
Kempner said after learning about the vaccine program through his sister, he was matched with a student volunteer who successfully found a location and registered him “a couple hours later.”
“I could not say more about that program,” Kempner said. “It really saved me and allows me now to spend more time with my family and to get back to Boston.”

Blake said administrators are focused on implementing Phase 1 of the University's research ecosystem review to boost research efforts at GW.
Amid an all-time high in research expenditures fueled by the pandemic, experts said universities need to balance COVID-19 research and funding other projects.
The University disbursed a record high sum of $200 million to fund research efforts and notched a 10-year high in published work in 2020, officials announced at a Faculty Senate meeting last month. Research leaders at universities across the country said academic institutions need to prepare to differentiate themselves in the post-pandemic period by prioritizing non-virus-related research areas.

Provost Brian Blake said at the senate meeting earlier this month that he is focused on addressing the recommendations from the first phase of the University’s ecosystem review, a faculty-led review of GW’s research infrastructure, which will determine the next steps for strengthening GW’s research profile. The Phase 1 recommendations include adding more research spaces to campus and improving resource allocation across research projects.
“Our researchers, our faculty remain very ambitious,” Blake said. “I’m using the word ‘hungry’ because they’re still going after awards. They’re pushing us, and I absolutely welcome that push to make this infrastructure the best it can be, because I think the sky is the limit.”
GW boasted a spike in GW-authored documents this past year, rising from about 3,300 to about 4,000, according to data presented at the senate meeting. More than 70 percent of GW’s research expenditures this year consisted of health-related research, with science and engineering and social science research making up 13 and 10 percent of the output, respectively.
Edward Hackett, the vice provost for research at Brandeis University, said an increased volume of publications is a general trend at “rising research” universities like GW. He said limited access to labs and opportunities for in-person research may have contributed to the rapid rise in GW-authored documents.
“This could be a pandemic effect – more time spent writing because researchers have limited access to labs and ability to interact with human participants, which reduces the amount of new data gathered,” Hackett said in an email. “Researchers are spending more time writing up data and perhaps also writing proposals, particularly for pandemic-specific opportunities.”
Hackett said lab rooms at Brandeis could only operate at 25 percent capacity for much of the year, a contributing factor to research activities at universities taking “quite a blow” during the pandemic.
He added that higher education leaders are currently focused on COVID-19 but need to draft plans to prepare for when the pandemic becomes less prominent.
“When the pandemic quiets down, we can’t have every research university in the country working on the same set of problems,” Hackett said. “People are going to have to go back to what they were doing and are best at doing.”
Data presented at the faculty senate meeting also showed that GW’s research was cited nearly 50,000 times between 2017 and 2020 and is on a 10-year upward trend.
Hackett said citation numbers aren’t meant to be used as “evaluation metrics.” Comparing citation numbers is difficult because referencing practices vary across different fields of scholarship, he said.
“In practice, we think that the more citations a paper receives, the better, because papers are written to be read, their findings to be extended, their methods refined, their implications to be explored,” Hackett said. “Frankly, the worst thing that can happen to a paper is for it to be ignored.”
Kate Petcosky-Kulkarni, the director of strategic initiatives and interim chief of staff for the vice president for research and innovation at the University of Oregon, said universities should use clear and frequent communication with faculty to best manage both internal research restructuring, like GW’s transition to the pod model, and COVID-19 research.
“Any change in work that we do needs to involve lots of opportunities for stakeholder engagement, whether that’s research administrative staff or facility staff or faculty themselves, because everyone’s going to have different needs that need to be accommodated in the shift,” she said.
This summer, officials switched the University’s research organization model to a decentralized pod system, dividing research projects into three groups based on subject areas. Experts said the pod model could lead to growth in research output and encourage additional interdisciplinary collaboration.
Officials established an internal fund for COVID-19-related research projects in April, and the School of Medicine and Health Sciences and the Milken Institute School of Public Health have advised U.S. government officials on their response to the pandemic, like conducting a leg of the Moderna Inc. COVID-19 clinical trial.
Pramod Khargonekar, the vice chancellor for research at the University of California, Irvine, said universities have generally been “supportive” and “aggressive” in funding projects related to COVID-19 in both the social sciences and STEM fields.
“That is a very positive development, and I hope that continues beyond this pandemic, where the global research community comes together and advances on major problems by the sharing of information, data and knowledge,” he said.
