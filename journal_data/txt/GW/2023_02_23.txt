In the filing, the University’s lawyers ask a judge to deny the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s dueling motion filed last month, arguing the EEOC consistently lacks citations or uses improper or nonexistent supporting evidence.

GW again asked a federal judge to strike down a pay discrimination complaint filed against the University by a federal workplace civil rights agency in a motion last week, accusing the agency’s lawyers of breaking legal rules by failing to back their allegations with anything but the plaintiff’s “self-serving” testimony.
In the filing, the University’s lawyers ask a judge to deny the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s dueling motion filed last month, arguing the EEOC consistently lacks citations or uses improper or nonexistent supporting evidence, which they say fails to substantiate the pay bias allegations. The motion is the newest development in a six-year legal standoff between the parties, sparked by a former employee filing a pay discrimination complaint with the commission against the GW athletics department in 2017.
The EEOC’s initial complaint alleges former GW Athletics Director Patrick Nero hired Michael Aresco as a “special assistant” in 2016 and tasked him with similar duties as Sara Williams, the plaintiff and the former assistant to the athletics director, but for a salary more than $30,000 greater than hers. GW’s Friday motion argues that while both parties have different descriptions of the tasks Williams performed under Nero, only the University’s lawyers are providing evidence about the responsibilities, pointing out numerous factual assertions that lack a “precise citation” in the EEOC’s previous filings.
“Enough is enough. The EEOC’s flagrant disregard for the Rules throughout this litigation justifies denial of summary judgment to the EEOC,” GW’s motion states.
EEOC spokesperson Victor Chen declined to comment on the ongoing litigation.
GW’s counsel argues the commission is relying on “ambiguous” terms when describing Williams’ responsibilities to exaggerate the extent of her roles, including her involvement with onboarding new staff, submitting performance reviews, managing budgets and negotiating contracts. The University’s defense argues their arguments are supported by references to clashes between the EEOC’s claims and the record of facts.
The University’s lawyers allege the commission describes many of Williams’ responsibilities in a manner that suggests she is performing a role with more leadership than her actual duties, arguing her duties usually involved acting as liaison between members of administration rather than direct involvement.
The commission alleges Williams “coordinated” the hiring process for other athletics department officials and presentations at Human Resources staff meetings, but doesn’t define the specifics of her responsibilities – which were mostly clerical, involving paperwork and correspondence between Nero and others – according to GW’s motion.
The University’s lawyers claim the EEOC inflated the responsibilities of Williams’ jobs like “plotting agenda items” for the department’s meetings by using unspecific language, alleging that she instead simply collected items from other staff, pasted them in a Word document and awaited approval for Nero and Aresco.
“In other words, Williams exercised no independent judgment or decision-making authority, even with respect to the order in which the agenda items were discussed; that judgment and authority resided in Nero and Aresco,” the motion states.
In their argument, the University cites previous motions filed against the University in cases from 2008 and 2010, where judges had thrown out the plaintiff’s argument because of their lack of evidentiary support provided through “precise” citations.
GW’s legal team claims the commission has thus failed to produce any evidence of the University’s pay discrimination based on sex despite being advised to bring out more proof in order to “survive” summary judgment by District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotellar when she refused GW’s motion to dismiss the case in 2018.
The commission abandoned their original argument that GW discriminated against Williams by failing to promote her to special assistant and has instead adopted allegations that the University denied Williams “opportunity for advancement,” GW’s motion states. The University argues the only of such opportunities was their denial of Williams’ request that a new position was created for her, which they say a Title VII claim could not support.
“None of the EEOC’s arguments as to how the University supposedly denied Williams an ‘opportunity for advancement’ has merit,” GW’s motion states.

Adams, by far the most efficient GW player of the evening, went on to make four from beyond the arc on eight attempts.
Men’s basketball narrowly defeated St. Bonaventure Sunday afternoon, 83-81, in an overtime thriller that came down to the final possession.
The Colonials (13-14, 7-7 A-10) held a comfortable lead over the Bonnies (13-15, 7-8 A-10) for most of the game, before blowing an eleven point advantage with just two minutes to go in regulation, sending the game to overtime. Efficient guard play from senior James Bishop and graduate student guard Brendan Adams combined with solid interior defense allowed the Colonials to hang on in the extra period.
Both offenses got off to a slow start and through five minutes only 12 total points had been scored with St. Bonaventure holding a 7-6 lead. GW took their own lead midway through the first half when junior center Noel Brown finished strong at the rim off the assist from redshirt freshman guard Max Edwards, making it 12-10.
The Colonials began to pick up the pace offensively around the seven minute mark, when Adams and Bishop hit back-to-back 3s off assists from each other, pushing the lead to two possessions.
Adams, by far the most efficient GW player of the evening, went on to make four from beyond the arc on eight attempts, paired with an overall shooting performance of eight for 12 from the field for a total of 28 points. Adams also grabbed seven rebounds and dished out four assists.
With just two minutes left in the first half, Bishop stole the ball, passed it down court to Edwards, who found Bishop slicing to the rim to complete the coast-to-coast score that gave GW their first double-digit lead of the afternoon at 29-19. Senior forward Hunter Dean closed out the half with a baseline jumper to make it 32-21 heading into the second half.
The Colonials allowed just 21 first-half points, well below their average of 33 this season, and further stifled the Bonnie offense by only ceding one 3-pointer out of their 12 attempts.
Junior forward Ricky Lindo Jr. got the second half underway with an emphatic dunk of a helper from Dean, pushing the Colonial lead to 13. With eight minutes gone in the second half, the Colonials hit their largest lead of the night when two free throws from Adams made it 48-30.
With seven minutes left, St. Bonaventure began to chip away at the lead, converting an and-one layup to cut the Colonial advantage to 10. Redshirt sophomore forward Chad Venning led the Bonnies in scoring with 22 points on nine of 14 shooting from the field.
With 2:34 to play, GW still held a 10 point lead, but the Bonnies were not done battling, as they converted back-to-back inside scores to slice the lead to 6 with 1:54 remaining. With just under 30 seconds to play, junior redshirt guard Daryl Banks III was fouled on a deep 3 by Lindo, down by 4, Banks made all three attempts, putting the game at 71-70.
Adams was fouled on the other end with 11 seconds to go, and missed his first free throw, but made the second, nudging the lead back up to 2. With just 10 seconds to play, the Bonnies scrambled toward the other end and managed to put up and grab their own rebound on two shots, before finally kicking it to sophomore guard Kyrell Luc for a midrange jumper that tied it at 72 with 0.5 seconds to play.
To start overtime, both sides traded field goals to tie it at 76 with 2:45 to play. The Bonnies then hit a wing 3 and Bishop responded with a free throw off an off ball foul, cutting the score to 79–77 with 1:08 to go.
A pair of free throws put the Bonnies up five before Adams nailed a clutch three off the assist from Hunter Dean to bring the lead back to a single point with just 27 seconds remaining. The Colonials controlled the final possession of the game and with just 0:02 left, Bishop was fouled on a 3-point jumper by Luc that sent him to the line. Bishop nailed all three, sealing the game at 82-81.
Now at 7-7 in the congested A-10 standings, the Colonials sit at seventh but just two games back from fourth place. GW will stay on the road for their matchup Wednesday facing Rhode Island at 7 p.m.

Freshman guard Nya Robertson contributed 20 points off the bench but was ice-cold all night, shooting a frigid 5-23 from the field on the night. 
Women’s basketball suffered a heart-wrenching, 59-66 loss to Davidson Wednesday in their last home game of the regular season. 
The loss throws the Colonials’ standing in the A-10 into a state of flux, with multiple teams vying for a top-four seeding and a double bye in the upcoming A-10 tournament. Graduate student guard Mia Lakstigala finished with a double-double, leading the Colonials with 23 points and 10 rebounds, and freshman guard Nya Robertson contributed 20 points off the bench but was ice-cold all night, shooting a frigid 5-23 from the field on the night. 
“I thought we got caught early on in the game just trying to play at more of a frantic pace,” Head Coach Caroline McCombs said. “And we needed to play at our pace and be disciplined to do the things that we work on every day.”
GW got out to a sluggish start, hitting just two of their first seven 3-point tries. With the 3s not dropping, the Colonials looked elsewhere for an offensive spark, and found it in senior guard Nya Lok and Lakstigala. The pair combined to score 17 of GW’s 19 first quarter points, in addition to Lakstigala pulling down three boards. 
As the second quarter got underway, the game quickly turned into a back-and-forth affair, with the Colonials clinging to a lead but failing to break away at any point. Robertson, unable to get anything going from beyond the arc, attacked the basket with reckless abandon, hitting a layup in the first minute of the quarter and sinking two free throws earned from a hard Wildcat foul to put GW up 31-26 with 1:40 to go in the half. 
And then, with 40 seconds to go in the half, she hit her first 3 of the game from the top of the key, in what felt like slump-breaking fashion. 
However, questionable shot selection coupled with an inability to keep Davidson off the glass would cost GW their already-tenuous lead and ultimately the game in the second half. The Colonials would shoot a putrid 18 percent from the field in the third quarter while going 0-7 from 3-point range. And it would be Davidson who entered the final quarter of play with a 46-45 lead.
“I don’t think we played as well – as a team – as we needed to play,” said McCombs. “We’ve talked about, the last few games, this is our roster and this is what we have and we have to get better at continuing to play together.”
The fourth quarter would be more of the same for GW, with the Wildcats out-scoring them 20-14 in the period thanks in part to the Colonials going 5-14 from the field and 1-5 from 3. 
The loss has knocked the Colonials – once sole possessors of third-place in the A-10 – back into what is now a three-way tie for third and a multiteam battle for a top-four seed and a double bye in the upcoming A-10 tournament. 
“It’s all about us,” Lakstigala said. “No matter who we play, we just want to play our hardest. Every game is so important. We’re just going to give it our all like we do every single game”
The Colonials will travel to Massachusetts Saturday to face first-in-the-A-10 UMass in their final regular season game. Tipoff is at 4 p.m.

Professor Cheryl W. Thompson interviewed Butler, Mayor Muriel Bowser, At-Large D.C. Council member Robert White, Ward 8 Council member Trayon White and comedian Rodney Grant at the mayoral candidate forum in April.
A former D.C. mayoral candidate filed a lawsuit against the University and professor Cheryl W. Thompson last month, accusing Thompson of slander and inflicting emotional distress for comments she made while moderating a mayoral candidate forum at GW in April.
James Butler, a former Democratic candidate for D.C. mayor, alleges in the complaint that Thompson slandered him when she brought up his disbarment and said he broke the law while she moderated the forum in the Jack Morton Auditorium. Butler is suing for $575,000 on claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress, false light, slander and vicarious liability.
University spokesperson Julia Metjian said the University does not comment on pending litigation but “looks forward” to responding to Butler’s allegations in court. Thompson, an associate professor of journalism and an investigative correspondent at NPR, did not return a request for comment.
Thompson moderated the mayoral candidate forum in April that GW hosted in collaboration with the League of Women Voters DC, a non-partisan organization encouraging informed and active citizen participation in government.
Thompson individually interviewed five candidates – Butler, Mayor Muriel Bowser, At-large D.C. Council member Robert White, Ward 8 Council member Trayon White and comedian Rodney Grant on major issues in the 2022 mayoral election. Candidates joined Thompson on stage in a randomly-generated order, and each candidate had two minutes to provide an opening statement followed by a 15-minute question-and-answer period.
Thompson asked Butler about how he planned to rid D.C. of illegal firearms, how he would improve D.C. Public Schools and what he meant in a 2018 interview when he said he would turn over control of D.C. schools to an “independent body” if he won the mayoral election, which he was running in at the time.
Near the end of Butler’s segment, Thompson posed a question about his disbarment, asking how voters could “trust” someone to uphold the law after violating it.
In response to her question, Butler said he never broke any laws nor was he ever charged with doing so. He admitted that he committed ethical violations while practicing law but was not forcibly disbarred, and he voluntarily surrendered his law license and consented to disbarment.
“That is a complete misstatement that I broke a law,” he said during the forum, according to a video of the event uploaded by WUSA9. “I was never charged. There was no discussion of charging me.”
Beginning in 2007, the Office of Bar Counsel – responsible for disciplinary actions against D.C. attorneys – started to receive complaints from Butler’s former clients accusing him of neglect, lack of communication, intentional failure to pursue their lawful interests, dishonest advertising, failure to return files, failure to return unearned fees, dishonest statements and failure to supervise attorneys working for him.
A majority of the complaints originated from incarcerated clients who hired Butler’s firm to assist them in appealing their criminal convictions. Butler told The Washington Post in May that he was in over his head as a young attorney and that he lacks the financial resources to pay back the DC Bar’s Client Security Fund, which reimbursed more than $650,000 to his former clients.
Following Butler’s interview, Thompson introduced At-large D.C. Council member Robert White Jr. for questioning. After White noticed his two minutes to introduce himself were nearly up, he prompted Thompson to ask him questions.
“I see that my time is up so let me get ready for these questions,” he said.
Thompson laughed and responded “Well, unless you were disbarred, it’s going to be a little easy,” to which an audience member yelled “personal attacks” in response. “It is true,” Thompson replied, according to the complaint.
Under D.C. law, Butler must be able to prove the conduct was “extreme and outrageous” and that Thompson had the “intent or knowledge” that severe emotional harm would occur in order to win the lawsuit, according to the complaint.
Butler alleges in the complaint Thompson’s comments qualify as outrageous conduct because she “attacked” him while he was off stage and could no longer defend himself, alleging she became “verbally combative” with audience members.
The complaint said it is unlikely the lawsuit would be filed had it been a “random confrontation,” but Thompson’s behavior as a “seasoned reporter” moderating a forum for mayoral candidates in the District was “extreme.”
Butler said in the complaint her comments “hurt and diminished” him in the eyes of voters and caused him to suffer emotional harm.
“Being out on the campaign trail, being my second time running for office, you can’t be a weak person doing that,” Butler said in an interview. “I just thought it was so blatantly unfair, and it never left my mind and it caused a lot of emotional distress.”
Butler said although voters have a right to ask questions regarding his past legal practices and disbarment, Thompson’s comments felt like a “personal attack.”
“This is about a moderator who failed to remain neutral, detached and unbiased and interfered with an interview process for candidates running for mayor of the District of Columbia,” he said.
Butler alleges the University’s awareness of the incident, employment of Thompson and subsequent failure to pursue disciplinary action against her renders them responsible for the consequences of the forum.
“I believe that Thompson did these things intentionally, and I believe the University knew what she did and failed to act, either prior to – vetting her properly that would be – or subsequently, and I believe they’re very carelessly liable for the actions that occurred,” Butler said.
The complaint states Thompson “clearly” lost her neutrality and engaged in political activity to oppose Butler’s mayoral bid while acting on behalf of the University.
Butler said he spoke with University officials in a dean’s office within the week after the event, and one individual who “appeared to be high up” said they found nothing wrong with Thompson’s behavior in the video. Butler said he could not recall whom he spoke to in the administration.
“Well, maybe a trier of fact, a judge or jury, will see what she did wrong,” Butler said.

Senior guard James Bishop led the Colonials with 25 points and six assists.
Men’s basketball overtook the Rams 89-80 in an overtime thriller, tying George Mason as for sixth seed for the Atlantic 10 standings and marking their second overtime game this season.
The Colonials (8-7) started off the game slow as the Rams (4-11) kept them scoreless in the first four minutes of the first half, but a pair of early substitutions kicked off their momentum. GW kept their lead for most of the game and was ultimately able to hang on to win in overtime.
Senior guard James Bishop led the Colonials with 25 points and six assists, and senior forward Hunter Dean set a new personal season high with 17 points and 12 rebounds.
Sophomore Ishmael Leggett led Rhode Island, finishing with 30 points and seven rebounds and making four of eight shots from the behind the 3-point line. The Rams also got help from senior guard Malik Martin, who finished with 21 points, hitting eight of his 13 shots from the field.
Rhode Island came out strong, jumping out an early 10-0 lead in the first four minutes of the game after both Martin and Leggett netted a pair of 3-pointers. A foul on senior forward Ricky Lindo Jr. in the fourth minute led to GW’s first point, but Lindo failed to convert the second free throw.
Redshirt freshman guard Maximus Edwards hit his first 3-pointer of the night before the first media timeout, waking the Colonials up from a five-minute scoring drought. Heading out of the media timeout, GW made two early substitutions taking out Lindo and Dean in favor of graduate student guard Amir Harris and junior center Noel Brown.
The Colonials kicked up their pace with a 3-pointer from Adams from a Bishop assist to put the score at 11-7. The Rams responded with a fastbreak layup from Martin, but Bishop maintained the 4-point differential with a floater in the paint.
A shooting foul from Rhode Island gave Bishop a chance to tie the game 16-16 off a turnover. A pair of layups from Adams and Bishop put the score in the Colonials’ favor for the rest of the first half.
A second-chance layup in the paint from Harris off a Rams turnover led the Colonials to consolidate a 10-point differential with six minutes to go in the first half, with the score sitting at 28-18. GW would extend their lead to 12 points before the Rams gained back momentum with a jumper from Leggett that would kick off an 11-point Rams run.
GW made 15 out of 28 shots in the first half, good for 53.6 shooting percentage from the field. Dean put on an impressive performance with 13 points in just the first half to go with six rebounds.
The Colonials went into the locker room up 39-31 after a Dean dunk in the final 20 seconds of the half.
The second half kicked off with a second-chance jumper by Leggett in the paint that cut the GW lead to just 6. Adams responded with a made 3-pointer off an assist from Bishop to keep the Rams at bay.
Legget then went on to hit a 3 which Edwards followed with a 3-pointer of his own to defend the Colonials’ lead.
With just five minutes left in the second half, sophomore guard Sebastian Thomas hit a 3-pointer that brought Rhode Island within 7 points. A Rams run punctuated by a pair of Leggett free-throws appeared to grant Rhode Island a come-from-behind victory, until Edwards pulled a defensive rebound that turned into a layup by Adams on the other end to tie the game in the final seconds and send it to overtime.
The Rams struck first in overtime with a layup that Bishop would counter with one of his own on the other end. A layup by Edwards would give GW their first lead of the overtime at 75-73.
Bishop sunk another layup before the first timeout to give the Colonials a 77-73 advantage heading into the remaining two minutes. The Rams would go on to hit three free throws after the media timeout, while Bishop sank a 3-pointer to push the GW lead to 6.
The Colonials would then score three layups in less than a minute, increasing the differential to double digits, but a jumper by Rhode Island cut it back down to 86-78. Dean would then net two free throws in the last 42 seconds, and final free-throw by Lindo would seal the game for GW and give them a 89-80 victory.
With three games left in the regular season, the Colonials find themselves tied for sixth place with George Mason in the A-10 standings. The Colonials will be looking to secure a key road win against La Salle Feb. 25 at 6 p.m.

Sabrina Soffer is an opinions writer and will be the commissioner of the Student Association’s Presidential Task Force to Combat Antisemitism.
Systemic ignorance of Judaism, Zionism and antisemitism at GW has enabled discrimination against Jews in the classroom and created fertile grounds for antisemitism at GW over the past few years. Bigoted notes and drawings of swastikas have appeared in residence halls. Holocaust revisionism and denial have been disseminated in classes. Mezuzot have been removed and damaged. A Torah scroll at the TKE house was desecrated last year. This fall, the GW Hillel building was vandalized and the site of an aggressive protest and it has been alleged that psychology professor Lara Sheehi was hostile toward Israeli-Jewish students.
The time has come to confront our campus’ cultural problem head on. The Student Association issued an executive order last month to create “The Presidential Task Force to Combat Antisemitism,” and, with the SA Senate’s vote next Monday, I will become commissioner. To ensure the protection of every student – including Jewish students – the task force will first propose an anti-bullying resolution drafted by the AMCHA Initiative – a nonprofit dedicated to documenting, investigating and combating antisemitism on U.S. college campuses. The “redefinition, denigration and suppression” of Jewish identity on campus violates GW’s policies and requires attention.
I plan to recruit 10 students to the task force by March 7 regardless of faith or ethnicity. The task force’s members will help create a comprehensive report about antisemitism at GW, research root causes of anti-Jewish bigotry, organize events and implement Jewish history and antisemitism as part of GW’s diversity, equity and inclusion trainings. Discussions between task force members and outside experts will help us understand how we can engage in civil discourse about these topics on campus.
As an Israeli-American and Jewish student myself, I’m grateful for campus organizations like GW Hillel, Chabad and Meor that hold weekly Shabbat dinners and other events where Jews can engage in cultural practices and conversations about our shared identities. But our Jewish peers hesitate to display their identities publicly on campus as a result of vitriolic attacks on their identity. Several of my Jewish friends have told me they conceal their Jewish symbols, like Star of David necklaces or kippot, when walking around campus past other students, some of whom have heckled and spit on them in class or in Kogan Plaza.
When violent, state-sanctioned, anti-Jewish riots known as pogroms broke out in 19th century Russia, Jewish poet Yehudah Leib Gordon wrote, “Be a man in the streets and a Jew at home.” Hiding shouldn’t be how we go about being Jewish at GW. Antisemitism has never disappeared into thin air – ducking our heads only ever exacerbates it.
As anti-Jewish bigotry and social justice rhetoric becomes normalized online and on campus, some Jewish students avoid conversations about Israel with non-Jewish peers and courses about the Middle East for fear of invoking distorted and inflammatory accusations about Jews. Some are so afraid of being singled out for their opinions and identity that they dread going to class. And when students struggle to eat or sleep and face depression due to constant denigration met with no accountability, there’s clearly a problem. Jewish students feel uniquely targeted by faculty who pledge not to discriminate against them and betrayed by an administration promising equal educational opportunities.
Several students have questioned the necessity of this task force to tackle antisemitism on campus given GW’s high proportion of Jewish students. A few Jewish students have even expressed that antisemitism is “normal.” To be clear, any form of hate is absolutely unacceptable. We should rally for the rights of Jews just as we would for the rights of all minority groups.
The task force will work with experts from Jewish organizations that track incidents of and provide education about antisemitism like StandWithUs, Jewish on Campus and others to unpack the evolution of antisemitism over the last millennia. The task force will engage in Zoom calls and workshops to educate themselves on the history of antisemitism around the world and its impact on various communities throughout history. Doing so will allow us to better understand how antisemitic tropes and harmful stereotypes about Jews can have deadly consequences in our modern social media age. Antisemitism is part of an ever-evolving conspiracy theory that falsely attaches Jews to loathsome qualities. Understanding it as such will enable the task force to determine what behavior constitutes antisemitism and hold people accountable for spreading such hate.
The task force will be committed to integrating Jewish students into the Office of Diversity, Equity and Community Engagement’s curriculum beyond the current resources on its website. These resources primarily address antisemitism in the context of Nazism, the Holocaust and white supremacy, but they fail to emphasize how anti-Zionist activism on campus can cross the line into antisemitism. I’ve reached out to the Shema Project, Hillel International and the Academic Engagement Network – organizations whose workshops help faculty, staff and administrators create a more positive environment for Jewish students and handle antisemitic incidents on campus.
We need to have difficult, intimate discussions about the state of antisemitism today. We need open conversations about topics like Zionism and anti-Zionism. The task force plans to use this dialogue to convey constructive messages to students, faculty and administrators about how to identify and respond to antisemitic incidents and heal the rifts in our community.
The whole point of college is to explore our distinct identities, beliefs and values – we can grow from one another’s diverse contributions and perspectives. We do not and will not always agree, but disagreement must never cross into denigration and suppression. Dialogue can exist where all can listen to each other, respect one another and work toward the common goal of our campus’ cohesion.
I encourage you to support this newly formed task force. I’m confident that it will set the precedent for future initiatives that can restore trust in our community.

Foggy Bottom residents can pick up free COVID self-testing kits at Ward 2’s COVID Center located at 926 F Street NW, according to DC Health’s website.
DC Heath will no longer supply free COVID-19 self-testing kiosks and rapid tests to public libraries and senior centers starting Feb. 28, according to a District news release Friday.
DC Health said the end of the distribution of self-testing kits is due to a reported decrease in COVID cases and a decline in testing among D.C. residents since January 2022. The West End Library, north of campus, is currently listed as a COVID self-testing kit pickup location on DC Health’s website and will no longer provide tests after Feb. 28.
“These changes are in line with similar actions at the federal level as a result of falling COVID-19 case counts and the increased availability of testing and vaccine opportunities through medical offices, pharmacies and community health centers,” the release said.
DC Health currently categorizes COVID transmissions in D.C. as low, according to data from DC Health last week.
The District’s weekly reported case rate declined in early February to about 52 cases per 100,000 residents, while in early January officials reported about 75 cases per 100,000 residents, according to data from DC health. Hospital admissions due to COVID have also declined, with zero reported admissions on Feb. 11, according to data from DC Health.
DC Health said in the release that residents should stay “up to date” with their vaccinations and boosters to continue to protect themselves and others from COVID. The release said there are still plenty of locations to receive vaccines, boosters and rapid tests like DC Health COVID Centers, local pharmacies or health care providers.
Foggy Bottom residents can pick up free COVID self-testing kits at Ward 2’s COVID Center located at 926 F Street NW, according to DC Health’s website.
In January, the Biden administration announced that the federal government would end the national COVID emergency after May 11, transitioning the country out of the public health emergency.
The halt of the emergencies will cut off access to “special” Medicaid rules that provide extra funding to states and access to telehealth services and medications that many citizens, like veterans, rely on for a convenient way to receive care. Hospitals will also no longer obtain extra funding from Medicare to treat patients with COVID.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken sent a letter to interim University President Mark Wrighton praising the University’s support for international studies, according to a University release. 
GW was a top producer of student Fulbright scholars during the 2022-23 academic year.
Out of 56 student applicants, 18 undergraduate and graduate students received the award, an increase from the 12 awards granted among 48 applicants to students in the 2020-21 academic year, according to a report from The Chronicle of Higher Education earlier this month. Stacked against its peer schools, GW enrolls the fourth-highest number of Fulbright scholars, tallying the second-highest acceptance rate this year.
Interim University President Mark Wrighton said in a University release that the program is a “meaningful avenue” for students to engage in global service and cross-cultural participation.
“The George Washington University is honored to be among the select institutions with a high number of Fulbright recipients,” Wrighton said in the release. “I am proud of our many students and scholars whose service and research is enabled and enhanced by this distinguished program.”
The Fulbright program is an international academic exchange program created in the aftermath of World War II and signed into law by President Harry Truman to introduce multicultural perspectives into scholarly work and facilitate international research and engagement opportunities on campuses nationwide.
The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs managed the program, assisted by the Fulbright Scholar Advisory Board which includes members from prestigious academic associations including the American Council of Learned Societies, the National Academy of Sciences, the Social Science Research Council and the American Council on Education.
The 32 percent acceptance rate is comparable to universities ranked higher than GW on the list, like Stanford University and the University of Chicago. Stanford received 20 awards at a 32 percent acceptance rate, while the University of Chicago received 21 awards at a 33 percent acceptance rate.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken sent a letter to Wrighton praising the University’s support for international studies, the release states.
“This achievement is a testament to your institution’s deep commitment to international exchange and to building lasting connections between the people of the United States and the people of other countries,” Blinken said in the letter.
Geneva Henry, the vice provost for information technology and dean of libraries and academic innovation, said in the release that many of the students who received the award collaborated with the Center for Undergraduate Fellowships & Research within GW Libraries and Academic Innovation, to complete their Fulbright scholar applications.
“We are incredibly impressed with our students who have been selected as Fulbright scholars, reflecting their hard work, dedication and academic excellence,” she said in the release. “This recognition not only showcases the talent of our students, but it also demonstrates GW’s strength in preparing them to make a global impact.”

The Finance Bylaw Revision Act allows students to request funding under categories like registration or enrollment fees, office supplies, food and drinks, transportation and lodging instead of by line item for specific charges.
The Student Association Senate unanimously amended its bylaws in a special meeting Tuesday in an effort to make the process to apply for funding easier for student organizations.
The Finance Bylaw Revision Act allows students to request funding under categories like registration or enrollment fees, office supplies, food and drinks, transportation and lodging, instead of by line item for specific charges. SA Sen. Linsi Goodin, CCAS-G, said the change will go into effect for the general allocations for the fiscal year 2024 when the funding request process begins on March 1.
She said the current system of line item requests is “too stringent” for student organizations because groups must submit requests to transfer their funds between each individual line item if they want to adjust their funding.
“The biggest change we are making is moving away from the line item format towards category-based funding requests,” she said.
Goodin said co-sponsorship requests for the rest of the semester will still use the line item request system for consistency, so the resolution will go into effect only in preparation for the next academic year.
The resolution adds speaker and performer fees as a category for funding requests, removing the limitation set last year barring the SA from funding guest speakers.
The resolution changes a previous policy approving a maximum of $7,000 for events with fewer than 300 students, instead setting the $7,000 maximum for events with fewer than 350 students. The new bylaws state that the finance committee can allocate a maximum of $10,000 for events attracting 350 or more students.
Events attracting more than 350 students can request funding from the University-Wide Programs Fund.
The resolution mandates the finance committee publicly post its minutes on the SA’s social media within 48 hours of meetings. Goodin said the requirement was installed to improve “accountability and transparency.”
The resolution grants the SA treasurer, a member of the executive cabinet, the power to oversee budget transfers, allowing student organizations to transfer funds across categories.
The resolution removes the ban instituted last year on funding for social media marketing. Goodin said recent successes, like the Career Exploration EXPO and GW Palooza, have demonstrated the need for social media advertising campaigns.
“These initiatives were so successful because of the social media pushes being made to get students involved,” she said. “While there were physical flyers and tabling activities, the outreach made through social media, especially during a post-COVID world, ensured these programs were successful.”
The resolution allows the SA to fund non-religious or cultural food for student organizations, but it stipulates that the finance committee will prioritize funding requests for religious and cultural foods.
The next SA Senate meeting will be held on Feb. 27 at 8:30 pm. in the University Student Center’s Continental Ballroom.

SBA Sen. Anissa Tanksley said students should not have to sacrifice their mental health and their small amount of free time to fight a barrier that is “unnecessary.”
The Student Bar Association unanimously voted Tuesday to call on the GW Law Journal Competition to give part-time students adequate time to submit work.
The resolution will urge GW Law Journal Competition to revise the current start date for the competition to two days earlier in an effort to allow part-time and evening students – most of whom have full-time jobs and other responsibilities on top of their course load – additional time to work undisturbed on writing for the journal. SBA Sen. Anissa Tanksley said she did not believe students should have to sacrifice their mental health and their small amount of free time to fight a barrier that is “unnecessary.”
“I am fully confident that most part-time students in their tenacity and their motivation to do incredible things have figured out, and can figure out, how to make that schedule work for them,” she said. “That being said, I don’t want them to have to do that.”
Senators also unanimously approved funding to reimburse GW’s chapter of the International Refugee Assistance Project for hosting a lunch for executive board members to meet the organization’s national student coordinator.
“I think it’s kind of silly to force someone who’s a student to pay for a meal for someone who came to the campus as part of the organization,” SBA Sen. Delaney Gatine said.
Senators unanimously approved funding to reimburse Hector Gonzalez Magno for expenses associated with his trip to attend the Hispanic National Bar Association 2023 Corporate Counsel Conference, which will take place from March 9th to 11th.
SBA senators unanimously confirmed first-year law student Sidney Lee as director of the elections committee. The former director, Katrina Ramkissoon, resigned in January to pursue an externship.
Roger Johnson, an associate judge in the SBA Supreme Court, said the court found that the senate can constitutionally delegate the authority to set the election date to SBA President Nicole Karem. He said the senate does not need to make any official statement about the delegation.
SBA elections will be held March 10.
SBA Sen. Raisa Shah said she is working with the executive branch to coordinate a diversity week in the beginning of April where students can partake in conversations about “culture and career development” and a world fair with food and music from around the world.
The next SBA Senate meeting will be held March 7 at 9:15 p.m. in the Law Learning Center.
