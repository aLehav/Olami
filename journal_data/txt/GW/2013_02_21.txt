Yes, the Colonials walked away with a win against Fordham Wednesday night, but it was a victory marred by frustration.
GW went just 17-for-37 from the line, a 45.9 free throw percentage that was its second-worst of the season. Shot after shot clanged off the rim, ricocheted off the glass, or – at the worst moments – missed the backboard entirely.
It was the third time in four games the team shot below 56 percent from the line. The frustration was evident on the faces of the players and the coaches sitting on the bench, and it was a statistic that followed the Colonials into the locker room, even after a 68-60 victory over the Rams.
“Yesterday, we actually shot 150 free throws each. Charted them and everything, and sometimes it’s just contagious,” head coach Mike Lonergan said. “It kept them in the game. It’s a shame, because it took away from a really good defensive effort by our team. It got to the point where it was just sort of ridiculous, some people were booing. I probably would have booed, too, if I paid for my ticket.”
Further frustrating the team was the loss of senior guard Bryan Bynes, who left the game after halftime with a right knee injury. 
Lonergan said he had yet to talk to team trainers, and hoped it was not a serious complication. Still, the loss of Bynes disrupted the flow of GW’s offense, taking away a senior presence on the floor.
“I knew his knee was bothering him in the first half, and he was kind of limping around, but [freshman guard] Joe [McDonald] had two fouls and we played him,” Lonergan said. “He was playing well, too. And that really hurt us. That really hurt us against their pressure.”
Trying to make up for its underwhelming performance at the line, GW tried to exploit a smaller Fordham team with dishes inside the paint. Faced with its usual three-point struggles – just 1-for-8 on the night – GW turned its offensive attention to the lane, grabbing a 44-20 points-in-the-paint advantage on the game.
The bench also proved to be an aid in GW’s often slim lead, tallying a commanding 20-3 edge in bench points before halftime. Those efforts were key in the team’s final 44.6 shooting percentage, and a major factor in the Colonials’ eventual victory.
“When the game started, it was a little bit of a slow start. Our position was to just come in and really have a spark, really turn things around, and really provide energy for the team,” senior guard Lasan Kromah said. “We just came in to do what we normally do.”
GW switched between defenses as they tried to halt Fordham’s tendency to score in bunches, finding the most success in heavy-pressing zones that saw the Colonials contain hot Fordham scorers with aggressive double-teams.
The follow-through GW continued to display throughout the game ultimately pushed the team to victory, fighting off Rams rallies until the final buzzer. The Colonials turned it over 14 times, but forced 22 Fordham turnovers that GW converted into 27 additional points. GW’s tenacity came through in its second-chance points as well, posting 20 to Fordham’s five.
“They really care, and the guys really play hard. I give a lot of credit to [senior forward] Isaiah Armwood. He’s really come in here and it’s cool to play hard again,” Lonergan said. “Isaiah leads by example, and when Lasan brings it like he did tonight, when he’s focused and playing defense, we’re kind of a good defensive team.”
Kromah added 13 points and four steals, Armwood paced GW in rebounds, with 12, and added eight points of his own.
A key player for the Colonials yet again was freshman forward Kevin Larsen, who had a career-high 15 points and five rebounds. But beyond his contributions on the stat sheet, Larsen became invaluable in aiding his teammates’ performances, setting screens and dishing out laser passes that helped the rest of GW make plays.
“I was just trying to work off the VCU game and keep being aggressive. My teammates fed me the ball in a position I really like,” Larsen said. “It just went in today.”
Frustrations aside, it was an important win for the Colonials. After facing two of the toughest A-10 teams back-to-back, the game against Fordham was a “must-win,” Lonergan said.
“Obviously, we played a good game against Butler and lost and then got drilled at VCU, so we had to win this game,” Lonergan said. “We’re going to have to play much better now at Saint Joe’s on Saturday.”

The phrase “bookless library” might sound like a bad paradox or the set-up to a cheesy pun.
But in January, the University of Texas at San Antonio announced that it will officially open “the first completely bookless library on a university or college campus” in the fall for engineering and technology students. It will offer everything from e-books to online journal subscriptions.
And while books on Gelman’s shelves may not be gone anytime soon, as students and faculty at this university, the idea of a bookless library is something that we might contend with in the near future.
The Hatchet reported in April 2012 that GW moved roughly 40 percent of Gelman’s third-floor periodicals to an off-site storage facility to free up more study space, which may set a precedent for a bookless library to come to Foggy Bottom someday.
There are some irrefutable benefits to digitization, but there are also a number of drawbacks.
For starters, it’s expensive. GW Libraries conducted a study funded to attempt to analyze the potential cost. The study found that digitizing a physical copy of a work was $1.70 a page. Digitization, after all, does not simply consist of scanning and uploading a page. The document needs to be indexed, recoded for analytics, made searchable and indexable and finally stored on a server.
Publishers present another cost-prohibitive factor. Books that the University has already bought may be illegal to digitize in some cases, and in others, the cost of purchasing a new digital copy may justify keeping the physical source.
Beyond the issue of cost, we also have to ask about what we lose physically when we digitize. Although it may be anachronistic in an age of Kindles and iPads, the physical copy of a piece of literature is irreplaceable. Yes, it’s merely an aesthetic distinction, but who’s to say that we won’t miss the crinkle of the pages and those time-frayed corners of a well-worn book. And there’s something to be said about holding a book and writing in its margins.
Despite these concerns with digitization, it does offer advantages for the science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines. The materials, manuals and instructional resources in an engineering class differ greatly from those used by an English class examining the Canterbury Tales. STEM students have the intrinsic advantage of working within a discipline that can live behind a computer screen. While the University is still figuring out to what extent new STEM materials will be digital, Associate University Librarian for Digital Initiatives and Content Management Karim Boughida told me, in the case of the applied sciences, a bookless library is a viable option.
Whether we like the changes or not, what may surprise the average student is just how “bookless” our library experience has already become. Every time a student uses the Surveyor or any of the other digital reading resources at this University, they are most likely using Gelman’s library resources. Whether we realize it or not, most of us are already using at least some degree of a hybrid bookless library.
The seemingly paradoxical idea of the bookless library will be something that we will all live with in one way or another.

We’ve been hearing Student Association leaders push for increased student space for the last two years through both small-scale and more extensive renovation plans.
But after rallying and collecting more than 4,000 signatures in favor of increased student space to present to the Board of Trustees, their lobbying efforts have proven largely ineffective. In fact, the administration sent a message to the student body last week. Provost  Steven Lerman and  Executive Vice President and Treasurer Louis Katz wrote in a letter to the community that the University feels it is already doing enough to improve student space through building projects like the Science and Engineering Hall and the “superdorm”.
And while I agree with SA leaders that student space is an important issue, this election season, it’s a mistake for candidates to continue to make it a prominent point on their platforms.
But that’s exactly what most of them are doing.
Candidates should think about how to make an impact in the next 12 months, not the next 10 years, finding innovative ways to help students during their terms.
“I think it’s important to tackle those things that don’t take up as much time but are very important because at the end of the day, everyone wants a more efficient system” SA presidential candidate Julia Susuni, a junior, told The Hatchet Feb. 14.
She’s got the right idea. But even Susuni has sworn to continue the student space fight. And she’s not alone.
In the last couple of weeks, SA presidential candidate Mike Morgan and vice presidential candidate Mike Adam, both sophomores, have mentioned student space as a central tenet of their platforms.
There’s no doubt students would benefit if the third floor of the Marvin Center were renovated into a community center where Colonials could meet for clubs and organizations as well as do homework and hang out with friends. But it’s one thing to have ambitious goals for the year and it’s another to be unrealistic.
The administration has been vocal about its opposition to the SA’s student space plan and whether students like it or not, the probability of it going forward anytime soon is very low.
Even though the University rejected Narla’s most ambitious goal, it’s not like his term has been devoid of success.
He convinced the administration to keep Duques and Funger Halls open until 2 a.m., brought regular free HIV/AIDS testing clinics to the Student Health Service and passed a student fee increase that will provide smaller student organizations with more funding for programming.
There’s a common theme here: Each of these accomplishments was a relatively small-scale quality-of-life issue that didn’t require GW to fork over millions of dollars in renovations. They were practical, simple and most importantly, accomplished within a year’s time.
And while Narla created a long term student space plan earlier this year where he laid out what the third floor of the Marvin Center might look like, imagine how much more he and Executive Vice President Abby Bergren could have accomplished with the time they spent on student space this year.
We hear SA candidates talk about the same issues every year. They claim they can improve J Street, lower student fees and tackle rising college costs. And while many of these promises fall short, this year’s batch of candidates have the opportunity to fill their platforms with fresh ideas that could really make an impact on campus. Instead of recycling tired lines and piggybacking off former administrations, the candidates should think outside the box.
The SA president and executive vice president have very little time to accomplish all of their goals. And they shouldn’t waste it on initiatives that are out of reach.

It’s the morning of the midterm in your most difficult class. And to your dismay, you wake with a sore throat, a fever and nausea, in need of a doctor’s note to give your professor.
But there’s a bigger problem – you live on the Mount Vernon Campus, where there isn’t even a nurse.
Students should not have to travel down to Foggy Bottom to Student Health Service for medical attention. The Vern needs its own health clinic with a nurse practitioner.
Vern residents plan ahead to avoid extra trips back and forth from Foggy Bottom. But when you’re sick, the last thing you want to do is travel.
Avoiding the doctor is never a good idea. And with a bad cold or the flu, it is even more unlikely that students will make the trek to K Street.
At the beginning of the fall 2012 semester, EMeRG finally got an ambulance to service the Vern in addition to Foggy Bottom. But as its name implies, EMeRG’s purpose is for medical emergencies – not seasonal viruses or colds. Many students who are sick don’t need an ambulance or a trip to the hospital. They just need a doctor or nurse to diagnose their symptoms and, in some cases, prescribe medication.
Aside from convenience, a small nursing clinic on the Vern would keep contagious students away from others on the often packed Vern Express. Plus, it will make it easier for students to obtain a doctor’s note to excuse a missed class due to illness.
Over the past few years, the University has been trying to encourage students to stay healthy. There are plans to make both Foggy Bottom and the Vern campus smoke-free in the fall, banning smoking within 25 feet of campus buildings. And the Center for Student Engagement is going to start offering cooking classes and weight loss seminars to help students maintain a healthy lifestyle.
While these are all valuable and worthy causes to foster a healthier student body, there is definitely more the University can do to accommodate health needs.
In the past few years, GW has been trying to make the Vern a more attractive place for students. With the reconstruction of Ames Hall,  the opening of Pelham Commons in West Hall and the growing number of courses being taught there each semester, GW is clearly trying to incentivize living on the Vern. Establishing a health clinic on the campus would be a logical step toward creating a sense of community there.
For students who don’t live in Foggy Bottom, it’s easier to stay in bed while sick than venture onto a shuttle and then to K Street to Student Health Service. Opening a Vern clinic during regular business hours would offer residents the care they need.

The Courtyard Marriott hotel on 20th and E streets welcomed its first guests this week, after more than two years of construction that rattled neighbors and nearby student residents.
Devin Denoncourt, the general manager, said the $28 million hotel faced holdups in the fall and again in January, putting off its projected opening until after Inauguration weekend – D.C.’s busiest weekend.
The hotel plans to build a relationship with the University, he said, extending an invitation for anyone “from the students to the professors to tour the hotel.” Its proximity to campus could draw students’ visiting families to stay in one of the 148 rooms.
He added that the hotel has had a “comfortable start,” with a mix of parents, businessmen and professors already booking rooms.
The hotel features full-access Wi-Fi, outlets, a library and a restaurant, as well as a 24-hour market.
The nine-floor building shares a block with three residence halls: 1959 E Street, Thurston Hall and Mitchell Hall, as well as the Elliott School of International Affairs building.
Foggy Bottom residents and students complained of noisy construction when demolition for the hotel began in 2010, saying conditions were “unlivable.”
The hotel is one of more than 20 Marriotts in D.C.

In the past decade, the University has demonstrated a commitment to improving academics by hiring a president from Johns Hopkins University and a provost from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Universities like Harvard will always be acclaimed and revered by virtue of their prestigious history. But for other academic institutions looking to distinguish themselves among a crowded field of universities, the key to success is to pursue cutting-edge disciplines. For the English department, disability studies could be that subject.
The department is expanding its focus on the disability studies program through a new faculty hire, presenting a chance for it to redefine itself. This addition to the existing course offerings is a tremendous step in the right direction.
And hiring a professor with expertise in the field is only the beginning. Minors in disability studies are offered at schools like University of Washington, Ohio State University and University of California at Davis. More and more programs are slowly emerging across the country. Still, the field is largely in its genesis, so it’s wise that GW has chosen to act now, and that it has left the door open to eventually build a minor.
Honing in on disability studies is a tangible way for the University to make a name for itself – especially for a department that is sometimes overshadowed by other areas of study like international affairs and political science. Instead of merely touting GW’s D.C. location to lure students, the disability studies program, a relatively new academic field, could attract burgeoning scholars.
And with new professors who are passionate about their field come enthusiastic and high-caliber students with diverse academic interests that would not only benefit students in the disability studies program, but across the University.
There’s a precedent for success in higher education when it comes to the creation of new programs. For example, the University of Iowa, renowned for its writer’s workshop – the master’s of fine arts program in creative writing – was the first in the country to create such a degree. Colleges are the birthplace of new ideas, and bolstering the academic disability studies program can help the school attain prestige through a unique expertise.
The opportunity to innovate in an emerging academic discipline is not a chance that reveals itself often, and the University should take advantage of it to the fullest extent.

The GW School of Business will help students analyze mammoth troves of digital data and take advantage of job openings worldwide when it launches a graduate program in business analytics next fall.
The 10-month program is the school’s biggest jump into an arena known as “big data,” which has caught fire across business, engineering and statistics.
What would you learn?
How to analyze digital data to make predictions and help businesses make better decisions.
What types of classes are offered?
Data warehousing, data mining, risk analytics, sports analytics
How long is the program?
The program is 33 credits, and can take from 10 months to two years to complete.
The field looks to measure and predict business outcomes based on statistical analysis of digital data, like a bank that predicts consumer habits based on credit card purchases.
New York Times blogger Nate Silver, who used statistics to predict winners state-by-state, popularized “big data” in the most recent election cycle.
GW’s Master of Science degree in business analytics will include courses like data mining and social network analytics aimed at mid-career professionals with a knack for numbers.
Business school faculty approved the program, but is still pending approval by the Board of Trustees. The school has already launched a website touting the program that prompts potential applicants to seek out more information.
Associate professor of decision sciences Srinivas Prasad, who will run the program, declined to comment because the program has not earned official approval.
The business school’s department of decision sciences is spearheading the program, with more than 20 faculty members involved in teaching in the program, according to the program’s website.
The program is an expansion of a similar certificate program, which launched in 2011.
Competitor schools like New York University’s Stern of School of Business, which will launch its program in New York City and Shanghai in May, offer similar programs.
The popularity of business analytics have been propelled by $200 million federal research money committed for “big data” by the White House last March. The initiative looks to grow scientists’ and analysts’ knowledge in the field even wider.
The consulting firm McKinsey & Company also projects 1.5 million openings for business managers with background in big data by 2018.
