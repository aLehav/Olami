 Faculty diversity has inched up slowly in recent years, according to data presented Friday, with administrators counting on a “pipeline” of minority and female professors as the University jumpstarts hiring.
GW’s breakdown of female, black, Hispanic and Asian professors is about in line with national numbers, and stayed flat or increased by 1 percentage points across individual colleges between 2010 and 2011, the latest data available.
About 40 percent of GW faculty are female and 15 percent are Asian, while 9 percent are black or Hispanic.
Vice Provost for Diversity and Inclusion Terri Harris Reed said at a Faculty Senate meeting Friday that the University is leaning on departments and schools to lure diverse candidate pools with new hiring strategies and fellowships, helping to accomplish a major goal of University President Steven Knapp’s administration.
But she said the University has been unable to rapidly increase the diversity of its faculty because the number of female and minority doctoral candidates has increased slowly, and added that the number of new hires every year is limited.
“When we’re doing our work, we try not to get discouraged because we have to look at what’s available in the pool,” she said. “We can’t make change until there’s opportunity. With the tenure-track faculty, it’s harder to make changes, whereas with our student population, it turns over every four years.”
Still, Faculty Senate executive committee chair Michael Castleberry called the data sobering after the University has spent several years trying to make strides toward diversifying faculty.
He pointed to the little growth in the number of females who earn full professorships, the University’s highest rank, which has risen from 20 percent to 23 percent over the last decade.
“I can see that we are doing it at the assistant and associate level. I’m not surprised that we’re not seeing it at the higher level,” he said. “But the increase still seems to be small based on the kind of input and energy we’re putting into it.”
The number of female full professors is also in line with the schools GW calls its peers, like Boston University, which counted 21 percent of its top-ranked faculty female.
The focus on diversifying hiring also comes as the University aims to significantly grow its faculty pool overall. The decade-long strategic plan, to be finalized in May, calls for adding 50 to 100 professors across all schools. GW’s largest school, the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences, is also on track to add about 20 professors over the next two years.
The University closed the gender gap the most among associate professors, increasing the number of female faculty by 13 percentage points over the past decade.
Growth in Hispanic and black full-time faculty has been more tepid, rising only 3 percentage point over the past decade. Most significantly, the School of Engineering and Applied Science increased its number of Asian professors from 17 percent to 32 percent over the last 10 years.
The engineering school continues to have the most minority faculty members at the University, but has struggled to increase its number of female faculty, also in line with a national trend.
Knapp said in an interview Friday that building a larger base of minority faculty is a challenge, but emphasized that the University was committed to diversifying its hiring pool as the number of minority doctoral candidates increases nationwide.
“You know, we have to be aggressive in the way we conduct our searches to make sure we’re not just going to familiar sources, because there’s a great temptation, a great tendency, for any institution, to reproduce itself,” he said.
Since becoming the University’s first diversity and inclusion administrator in 2011, one of Reed’s top priorities has been diversifying faculty hiring searches.
The Graduate School of Education and Human Development substantially increased the number of female faculty members over the last decade as it has ballooned its tenure-track faculty core.
The number of female full-time faculty members jumped from 52 to 61 percent, and the number of black or Hispanic faculty also jumped from 11 percent to 17 percent.
Dean Michael Feuer said his office has made an effort to maintain and increase diversity among its faculty members while “maintaining and raising standards of academic excellence.”
He said GSEHD faculty and administrators have worked with the Office for Diversity and Inclusion, which has improved hiring search tactics by “trying to understand with respect to things like innovations in institutional practices to increase persistence, motivation and mentoring.”

When law professor Thomas Buergenthal was about 6 years old, his mother took him to a palm reader in Eastern Europe before World War II broke out. He would be a lucky child, the palm reader told him.
At about 10 years old, Buergenthal was one of the youngest survivors of the Holocaust – escaping the death march and concentration camps in Germany and Poland to reunite with his mother after a two-year search. A look inside Buergenthal’s journey from Auschwitz to a legal career is one part of a student-designed exhibit in Gelman Library.
Undergraduates in the honors international affairs class Holocaust and Memory pieced together letters, timelines, telegrams and dreary, black-and-white photographs to dive inside the life of a Holocaust survivor. The exhibit opened last week.
For Buergenthal, 78, peering into the four glass-covered cases on the library’s seventh floor was surreal, like a “historical autopsy” of his life. He said that meeting his mother at a train station in Germany – more than two years after they were separated at Auschwitz – was the most profound experience of his life, but still the hardest to remember and discuss.
“You feel sort of like you’re in a mausoleum for somebody else,” he said in an interview last week.
Of the estimated nine million Jews living in German-occupied countries before the Holocaust, two-thirds were killed by its end in 1945. More than one million of those who died were children.
Before he found out his mother was still alive and the two were reunited, Buergenthal was the only child in his Polish orphanage who survived Auschwitz.
The law professor moved to the U.S. in 1951 and joined GW in 1989, holding an endowed position teaching comparative law and jurisprudence. His credentials include time as a judge on both the International Court of Justice at The Hague and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, as well as a dean at American University’s law school.
The student exhibit details the later part of Buergenthal’s life, including his survivor story, which was also documented in his 2009 book “A Lucky Child.” Buergenthal said the book and the exhibit help bring to life “what the Holocaust was like for just one family, not for the six or eight million people, but to just say that this is what happened to my life.”
The professor also worked closely with former President Jimmy Carter as the director of the Human Rights Program at the Carter Center during his career.
Eighteen students in international affairs professor Walter Reich’s class soaked up Buergenthal’s story.
“My children will never get the opportunity to do anything like this. They will never get to hear a survivor’s story firsthand,” senior Omayra Chuquihuara said. “It’s important to connect ourselves with the Holocaust memory at some point, whatever it may be, and make sure that future generations never forget.”
Reich said he organized the project for his class on Holocaust memory to offer a chance for students to understand the horrific events of the infamous genocide through the personal story of one survivor. Students created the four cases that make up the exhibit with some help from a graduate student in the museum studies program.
“It is personalizing an event which is almost incomprehensible – which is really incomprehensible – the Holocaust,” Reich, a former director of the Holocaust Museum, said. “One of the things that can be learned is think of all the people who didn’t survive and what they could have contributed to the world.”

GW will adopt a federal tool to help students compare their financial aid packages across institutions, responding to pressure from higher education organizations and government agencies.
After initially expressing reservations about the financial aid “shopping sheet,” which has been adopted by more than 600 universities over the last year, Associate Vice President for Financial Assistance Dan Small said his office is pinpointing a timeline for implementation.
Small said he feared at first that the online comparison, which includes information such as a school’s total price tag, available financial aid and average indebtedness, might confuse prospective students and their families by presenting too much information without explanation.
“I thought that the uniqueness of GW was not conducive to the shopping sheet,” Small said. “We’re going to adopt it. There’s no doubt that we will.”
Because financial aid offers have already been mailed out to prospective freshmen, the form likely would not be used in full until next year.
The Student Association endorsed the shopping sheet in December with a resolution sponsored by Sen. Omeed Firouzi, CCAS, who lobbied the University’s financial aid office to adopt the comparison tool. He called the decision to adopt the document “extremely positive” for students.
Small said GW would use the shopping sheet partially as a result of external pressure from higher education and aid organizations, the Department of Education and the Department of Veterans Affairs.
The University is striving to meet the Department of Veterans Affairs’ “principles of excellence” criteria. The shopping sheet is one of these benchmarks, Small said.
GW’s software vendor for financial aid data also announced upgrades this week that will allow institutions to at least send a paper copy of the shopping sheet to students.
“This is something we’re going to be working with external relations to say, ‘OK, how can it be presented in the right way that meets the guidelines, but also delivers the right message,’ ” Small said.

At GW Law School, the teaching committee – prompted by a student petition – is reviewing the grade submission policy to determine whether changes are warranted.
What GW needs is a common sense policy on grade release transparency that recognizes the value of early access to that information.
The policy is on its way to a faculty review after the Student Bar Association senate passed a resolution in February. Faculty are reviewing the proposal and should support this initiative and pass it without delay.
Five law school deans answered student questions through a town hall format April 1. Not surprisingly, students asked about the grade release policy.
Grade release transparency hasn’t exactly been a priority at the law school. Students are not given a firm grade release deadline, meaning they often check for grades multiple times a day in the weeks after finals. Grades sometimes arrive late, hurting the job application process in an already competitive legal market. As Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs Christopher Bracey admitted at the town hall, “having those grades earlier is a strategic advantage.”
At the town hall, the panel of school administrators took the wrong approach. They discussed concern for faculty who might not make deadlines due to medical emergencies.
“I may be the only person who knows,” Bracey said of faculty who are sick and cannot turn in grades on time.
Bracey should not be the only one to know. Students should receive communication from their professors or administrators regarding the release of grades and in the case of delays.
Banweb, the online system for accessing grades and transcripts, is an inadequate means for providing law school grades. The law school requires students to report GPAs to the thousandth digit on all resumes and job applications. But Banweb only goes as far as a second digit after the decimal point in unofficial online transcripts.
All told, from exam to Banweb to ordering that fourth digit, the process of obtaining grades at the law school ends up making the job-hunt harder, and thus hurts students.
On paper, the grade release policy as currently written makes some sense. As The Hatchet reported in February, professors have a grade submission deadline determined by a formula unique to each professor that accounts for the number of students in each course.
Still, students usually aren’t told when that deadline is, and delays aren’t communicated. Administrators should keep in contact with professors who have difficulty turning in grades on time, and require that they keep students informed.
Communication would relieve stress and help students understand why grades might not be available when promised. Complaints should be dealt with by the appropriate faculty committees on a case-by-case basis.
And Banweb should offer the option of printing an unofficial transcript that is similar to the official version. After holding job application mailings for weeks, students should not have to wait even longer for that fourth GPA digit.

The provost defended the freedom of speech Friday for the Catholic priest on campus, two weeks after a pair of seniors filed a discrimination complaint against him and launched a campaign to force him off campus for comments and actions they called anti-gay.
Provost Steven Lerman told dozens of professors at a Faculty Senate meeting that the University will continue to encourage an open dialogue on campus, marking his first public comments on gay seniors Damian Legacy’s and Blake Bergen’s complaints that Father Greg Shaffer forced them out of the Newman Center. Newman Centers operate ministries at non-Catholic universities across the country.
“Nothing anyone has said in our view goes beyond our standards of freedom of speech that we treasure in the core of our values,” Lerman said. “We as a community need to sustain those values that this is a place for open, honest and civil dialogue. And we not only permit it, but encourage it.”
Legacy and Bergen launched a campaign earlier this month for Catholic leaders in the District to remove Shaffer from campus and for GW to investigate Shaffer’s alleged discrimination against gay students. If proven, the discrimination charges would partially defund the campus Catholic center.
They are also asking the University to vet future religious leaders that come to GW and work with students.
The seniors claim Shaffer’s anti-gay comments have caused psychological damage to students. Earlier this month, Vice Provost for Diversity and Inclusion Terri Harris Reed declined to comment on specifics about the case.
The conservative blogosphere exploded in response to their efforts, and the issue landed a spot on The O’Reilly Factor on Fox News last week. A nationwide conservative student organization, TFP Student Action, also opened up an online petition in support of Shaffer, collecting about 10,500 signatures as of Sunday.
University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard said the University is still reviewing the complaint and taking it “seriously,” although administrators reviewing the case have taken flak from right-wing groups, including the nation’s top Catholic lobbying organization, for remaining largely silent over the last two weeks.
President of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights Bill Donohue wrote in a statement Friday that University officials deserve an “F” grade for their handling of the allegations. Earlier this week, he called for a quick end to the controversy, which began two weeks ago when the students announced their efforts. He blamed the student-led effort for “seeking to effectively neuter the very purpose of the Newman Center.”
“There is only one party to this controversy that has crossed the line, and it isn’t Father Shaffer. The attempt to silence him shows nothing but contempt for diversity and tolerance, the twin towers of academic virtue these days,” Donohue wrote.
The Newman Center is slated to receive about $500 more in funding from the Student Association next fall than last year, totaling about $10,500. Allocations for hundreds of student groups will go before the SA Senate Monday.
Student leaders said that if the University finds signs of discrimination, however, the SA would rescind some of the funds. Chair of the SA Finance Committee Alex Mizenko declined to comment on the allocation increases, diverting questions to SA President Ashwin Narla. Narla said allocations are meant to support students’ “individual passions and goals.”
“All student organizations that apply for funding are judged with the same criteria for funding every year, and new policies in place would allow us to change their funding if the University found a student organization had broken University policies,” Narla added.
Earlier this semester, the Senate passed an anti-discrimination bill that will defund any student group by at least a third of its budget if the Office of the Dean of Students found it harassed or discriminated against students based on Department of Education guidelines.

GW will strip about $150,000 in funding from a prestigious graduate fellowship program next fall, cutting salaries and housing benefits, and leaving departments to sponsor their own fellows.
The Presidential Administrative Fellow program, which picks a handful of students to work in University offices while earning master’s degrees tuition-free, has previously been funded by the Dean of Students office. But next fall, sponsoring offices will foot the entirety of each student’s paycheck, amounting to about $25,000 a year – a one-third decrease from what fellows earned this year, in addition to their free graduate program. Students will be expected to work about 20 hours a week next year, down from about 30 hours a week in previous years.
The six incoming fellows as well as 13 current and graduating fellows penned letters to University President Steven Knapp last week, calling the change abrupt and unfair.  Current fellows accused GW in the letter of luring students to the program “under false pretenses.”
Recently selected fellows wrote in their letter that they were under the assumption that they would earn $37,000 a year, which includes a housing stipend, on top of free tuition for their two years of graduate school when they signed contracts with the University.
The letter, obtained by The Hatchet, says they were confused and distressed after learning of the new compensation package and revamped work requirements after the fact.  They wrote that the changes, which would cut down hours and eliminate a summer work period, will “substantially change our fellowship experiences.”
Senior Associate Provost and Dean of Student Affairs Peter Konwerski defended the new structure, adding that administrators “carefully reviewed the award package to ensure consistency with other graduate awards,” as a way to make sure the graduate aid budget is “equitable and broadly distributed.”
He said next year’s compensation is still “very desirable,” and said the University is “committed to continuing to provide competitive graduate aid packages.”
Konwerski said the program’s leadership told the incoming fellows that their compensation would change in their acceptance letters in January, and said that the current fellows heard news about the changes “this winter and again later this spring.”
But he said GW’s effort to communicate the program’s new benefits and expectations could have been clearer.
“In hindsight, I have acknowledged to the PAFs that more could have been undertaken to be more proactive in bringing the specific details of these changes to their attention earlier,” Konwerski said. He said officials are preparing a letter in response, and would continue conversations with the fellows.
Konwerski added that limiting the hours will make sure fellows can focus on academics and other extracurricular activities like internships, research opportunities and service.
The fellows argued that with fewer perks, the program, which attracted about 70 applicants this year by its October deadline, would lose students who might choose to work and study elsewhere in future years. They also argued that forcing departments to cough up an hourly rate of $24 to pay the graduate student fellows would hugely deter offices from taking on students.
“This provides no incentive for departments to host fellows, as they could spend much less to hire a part-time employee or a work-study student,” according to the current fellows’ letter.
Konwerski said sponsoring departments previously paid for “a significant portion” of the fellows’ compensation, but said he could not provide how much departments would pay because he said it depends on students’ work schedules.
The current fellows also said they were not involved in the decision-making process and that “attempts to address these concerns with the PAF program leadership have stalled and that little effort is being made to be transparent or act in the best interest of the fellowship.”
The changes stem from a 2010 report from fellows who recommended that the University limit the workload to 20 hours a week and make sure there is an increased academic focus in the program. But the fellows then had also recommended that the decreased hours not affect their stipends so that the students would not have to work part-time elsewhere or take out loans to offset the costs of living.
Current fellows also pointed out that incoming students will have to pay out-of-pocket for rent in August, as they have to be on campus by the middle of the month but will not get their first check until September.
A fellow currently in the program, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the students sign a confidentially agreement, said that while next year’s fellows were notified in their acceptance letters, there is a lot of confusion because more changes have been made since they were originally notified.
“We felt the changes could have been more effectively communicated to both the incoming PAFs and our class. Changes are still being made, and not all of the changes were determined in January when the new cohort was accepted,” the fellow said.

You can probably expect some Student Association senators to demand that the finance committee justifies its steep cuts to the Interfraternity Council and the Panhellenic Association at Monday night’s allocations meeting. But however drastic the cuts might seem, this was a necessary decision.
It is true that this was the second consecutive cut in allocations to IFC and Panhel, down from $25,000 each this past year and $32,500 the previous year. But if you look back to the 2010-2011 academic year, the IFC received just $3,500 in SA funding for the entire year. Although Panhel’s allocation was significantly higher, its single largest expense for the year by far was fall recruitment, as it always has been.
As an active member of Greek life and brother in Beta Theta Pi, I can say with confidence that IFC’s nearly tenfold increase in allocations from the 2010-2011 year to the 2011-2012 year had virtually no bearing on my experience. The cuts incurred this year similarly didn’t affect my experience, and this last set of cuts will have no appreciable impact on the vast majority of our Greek life members.
What makes or breaks a student’s Greek experience? It’s not Greek Week or a handful of mandatory IFC and Panhel-sponsored anti-hazing speakers or a weekend trip to a leadership conference that may or may not get a financial subsidy from one of the Greek umbrella groups.
Individual chapters create their Greek success stories through philanthropy, social events and opportunities to forge friendships that far outlast any programming that takes place during the year. And those things, by and large, do not get funded by the SA.
Greek life will not cease to function properly without a huge chunk of money from the SA. Individual chapters are almost entirely self-funded.
Take a look at Panhellenic recruitment and ask yourself whether student tuition dollars should pay for it. For three days, other student groups are severely limited in their ability to hold events in the Marvin Center because so much of the building is occupied by recruitment. Tons of money is spent putting up sisters of individual chapters at a hotel so they can allegedly remain neutral throughout the process and focus on recruitment for Greek life as a whole – as if staying in a hotel would prevent them from using their phones, listservs, Facebook or any other means of communication with their chapters during the process.
Then, of course, there are the damage fees that the Marvin Center charges Panhel after meeting rooms are left in horrible condition following recruitment weekend. There is no reason why such a huge chunk of money should be taken away from other student organizations for an obscenely expensive event that only benefits a small, specific segment of the student body.
If the money doesn’t come from the SA, it will come from somewhere else.
Of course, this is not meant to be a tirade against sorority recruitment. Panhellenic recruitment is just one of many examples of unnecessary and inefficient spending by our Greek umbrella groups. The question we need to ask is this: What kinds of projects truly warrant a subsidy from student tuition dollars? If you ask me or anyone else who has seen the full breadth of SA-funded student programming, I have no doubt that we can be much smarter and much fairer with our SA budget. If the allocations bill passes in its present form tonight, we will have taken an important step toward that end.
Regardless of IFC and Panhel’s allocations, Greek life will continue to grow and thrive as it has every year, and Greek students will continue to look fondly upon their experiences and cite them as some of their most cherished memories at GW.

The University’s FIXit system will begin giving students status reports of their facilities requests and release a mobile-friendly website this fall in response to student complaints that the maintenance service falls short on communication.
Senior Associate Vice President for Operations Alicia Knight said the repair service is rolling out upgrades to help students keep tabs on the progress of their work requests through mobile updates or email notifications. The website will also help set students’ expectations for the completion of their maintenance needs, based on recent response time for similar requests.
“Through focus groups, students have shared that they put in their FIXit ticket and then they don’t know what happens until they get a hang-tag on their door and it says it’s done,” Knight said. She added that her office hopes to bridge that gap “so that students understand that their service tickets are important and we’re working on it.”
The changes come at a time when FIXit is receiving a larger call volume: Maintenance crews have already responded to 1,300 more calls compared to this time last year, though Knight declined to provide a breakdown of total request numbers or specific data, like completion rates for emergency and non-emergency requests.
“I have some concerns about providing data at a level of granularity that is not the way that we use it and/or set the service standard that we want to talk to the community about,” Knight said. “I have to decide what do I think provides the best representation and how can I measure it in a way that’s consistent with what we do internally.”
The office will also add resources to help students handle their own basic maintenance issues, after an eight-student focus group weighed in with top administrators.
FIXit crews began using iPod touches to report ticket statuses or work requests last year as part of technological upgrades, and also extended work hours during fall move-in.
As of March, work crews completed 76 percent of FIXit requests within five days this year, up from 71 percent last year.
The overhaul also aims to reduce the number of requests handled by maintenance crews by offering self-help tips on the FIXit website to encourage students to resolve issues such as basic plumbing problems. Nearly a third of plumbing work requests – which topped the leaderboard of FIXit categories – involved clogged utilities, Knight said.
Self-help information would help students take care of “the types of things that you would do in your home,” she said.
Students interviewed gave FIXit mixed reviews. Some said their work requests were swiftly resolved, while others took days and weeks of calls.
“They are really slow,” sophomore Brendan McLellan, who lives in JBKO Hall, said. “They’ve been quick with me just because I’ve been a pain in the ass.”
He said he pestered the maintenance service multiple times to get work done this year. Like fellow JBKO resident Dahlia Amade, McLellan said his air conditioner issues were resolved within a few days, but bug and pest infestation issues took weeks.
In addition to general upkeep and proactive maintenance work, facilities crews responded to more than 55,000 calls last academic year, 72 percent of which occurred in residence halls. Students in Ivory Hall, followed by those in City and Thurston halls, generated the most maintenance requests.
