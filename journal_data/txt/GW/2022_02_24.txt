The event coincided with the creation of an online petition with over 360 signatures demanding GW divest from companies profiting from forced labor practices.
Two Uyghur human rights activists who experienced persecution by the Chinese government discussed financial divestment from the companies that reportedly profit on Uyghur forced labor at a discussion Tuesday.
The pair spoke about personal tragedies they’ve experienced actions students can take to end financial support of the genocide individually and at GW. The event was moderated by Elise Anderson, the senior program officer for the Uyghur Human Rights Project – an NGO promoting Uyghur human rights – and was hosted by the Athenai Institute, a student-run non-profit, and sponsored by College Democrats, College Republicans and the GW Uyghur Divestment Committee.
Rushan Abbas, the founder and executive director of Campaign for Uyghurs, a human rights organization, works to raise awareness of the genocide in the United States. She said her sister was imprisoned as a result of her non-profit work.
“I am sitting here and talking to you at the cost of my own sister’s freedom,” Abbas said. “My sister, Dr. Gulshan Abbas, is a retired medical doctor who was taken only six days after my first public speech.”
Abbas said students can pressure lawmakers to strictly enforce the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, a law passed in 2021 aimed at banning goods produced with Uyghur forced labor in the United States. The law does not make companies ensure that goods outside of East Turkestan are not produced through forced labor, which led some human rights organizations to criticize the legislation.
“Cutting off any kind of deals that the University makes with cotton or t-shirts or anything that the University purchases, that’s going to help and that’s where we can start by pressuring the University, the president, and the decision makers and then supporting that we have the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act that’s signed and it’s a law right now,” Abbas said. “But unless we push for the implementation of it, it means nothing.”
The event coincided with the creation of an online petition with over 360 signatures demanding GW divest from companies profiting from forced labor practices.
Abbas said the 1985 anti-Apartheid GW student protest encouraged the University to financially divest from profits earned through the South African regime to spur students to do the same today. GW never publicly divested from Apartheid-related investments due to the riskiness of the new stock portfolio.
“Divestment is not a new concept for GWU, and now you are doing the same thing again as GWU students took part in protest in 1985 against the Apartheid and called for divestment – divestment is critical – the evidence is overwhelming,” she said. “China is using Uyghurs in forced labor programs as modern day slavery. For their ongoing genocide, they have created a profit motive, a financial incentive to continue their genocide.”
Zumrat Duwat, a survivor of Uyghur concentration camps in East Turkestan and a human rights advocate, said she experienced beatings and other forms of physical and mental abuse in the concentration camp.
“When I initially came, I shared my bread with an elderly diabetic woman – as a result, I was cruelly beaten by the guard. The woman screamed and begged the officer to stop telling him that I didn’t understand the rule. I also screamed ‘Oh god’ from the pain of the stress,” she said.
Duwat said the Chinese government conducts forced sterilization as part of its campaign against the Uyghur people. Compulsory sterilization is considered a crime against humanity by the International Criminal Court, of which China is not a member.
“I felt as if I was being led to a slaughterhouse,” she said. “The process began with me being connected to an IV, which caused me to lose consciousness. When I woke up, I was in excruciating pain – when I looked around, I noticed there were other women in the room who were also crying in misery. I can’t put into words how I felt when I woke up. I was absolutely dehumanized.”
The State Department accused the Chinese government of sponsoring mass forced labor programs that force Uyghurs to produce goods that may end up in the United States in July 2021.
“After they detained, I was forced into labor,” Duwat said.
Duwat called on students to volunteer with or donate to organizations like the Uyghur Human Rights Project and the Campaign for Uyghurs to help spread information about crimes against humanity in China and help Uyghur communities and migrants in the United States.
“So what I am asking you, like Sister Rushan just said, is to spread the news, the credible news, about Uyghurs on social media, and please also organize events like this today to enable more and more students to know about what’s really happening to Uyghurs,” she said.

Jamie Cohen-Cole, a faculty senator, said officials' potential plans to renovate Mitchell and Madison halls in the next several years could leave GW with insufficient housing for the number of on-campus students.
Ongoing residence hall renovations may limit GW’s undergraduate enrollment totals, members of the Faculty Senate said in a report at a senate meeting last Friday.
Jamie Cohen-Cole, a faculty senator and professor of American studies, said in a presentation to the senate that projects like the reconstruction of Thurston Hall reduce housing on the Foggy Bottom Campus, in turn limiting undergraduate enrollment space. Cohen-Cole said the 2007 Foggy Bottom Campus Plan, an agreement between GW and D.C., requires the University to maintain a certain number of beds depending on the on-campus population, and almost all of GW’s nearly 6,500 beds were full this year, according to the report.
Cohen-Cole said officials are considering renovating Mitchell and Madison halls during the next several years, which could leave the University with insufficient housing for the current size of the on-campus student population.
“Each renovation like this, while needed, would mean that while those dorms are being renovated, GW would necessarily experience a lower ability to have the enrollment that we currently have,” he said.
Provost Chris Bracey also delivered a report on faculty salary equity at the meeting, which examined whether faculty are fairly compensated for their instruction, research and performance at the University. Bracey said the report did consider faculty’s gender and race, but he would look into how future reports can analyze the possible differences.
Bracey said officials compared faculty’s salaries with others in their department and school and adjusted the earnings given to professors who were considered outliers – falling more than one standard deviation outside of their peers’ salary totals. He said outlier salaries that were adjusted were “largely performance-related” and correlated to low or high faculty performances.
He said there were 37 outlier salaries in the Columbian College of Arts and Science, eight in the School of Engineering and Applied Science, seven each in the Elliott School of International Affairs and the School of Business, five in the Graduate School of Education and Human Development and four in GW Law in August. He said officials made a total of 23 faculty salary adjustments.
“The number of outliers that need an adjustment are relatively small relative to the total number of faculty,” he said. “So what that means is that schools are more or less getting it right in terms of their salary equity.”
Bracey said the Office of the Provost is working independently with the College of Professional Studies and the School of Medicine and Health Sciences to address salary equity issues, so they were not included in the report.
Bracey said he’d like to form a committee that will analyze how officials can address faculty salaries and develop a methodology that would study faculty salaries along gender and racial lines.
Interim University President Mark Wrighton announced at the meeting that he tapped Bracey to be the permanent provost of academic affairs, after Bracey served in the interim role for more than seven months. Wrighton said he made the choice under the advice of the senate’s executive committee and the Board of Trustees.
He said prospective administrative candidates will be glad that Bracey has been selected to be the permanent provost because it will give them assurance in their job stability.
“This will give assurance to any prospective candidate that they will know who they will be working closely with as we undergo those recruitments,” he said.
Wrighton said he would search for two candidates to serve as permanent deans and replace the interim leaders of the College of Professional Studies and the School of Nursing.
Wrighton also said members of GW’s shared governance task force, which hosted four town halls last month as part of its efforts to improve shared governance at the University, will go on a retreat this weekend to discuss the results of a shared governance survey that officials released to faculty, staff and trustees last month.
Wrighton said he has met with members of various departments, faculty and adminstrators across the University to introduce himself and discuss strategic planning. He said he met with the heads of each school to help develop a strategic plan for the school moving forward, but the University still needs to cement an official plan to approach enrollment in the future.
“As we define better our academic priorities by the process that I mentioned earlier and then undertaking a comprehensive strategic plan to make sure that we are on a good course to realize the aspirations that we have – for the moment, I don’t think we have that plan,” he said.
Senators also expressed concerns about decisions that led officials to track community members’ locations without notifying them during the fall semester.
Officials said at the meeting that federal research expenditures increased by $22 million, and the University released 45,000 publications during Fiscal Year 2021. GW also received more than 1,600 active awards from non-profit organizations, the federal government and industry associations in the same year.
“I think research development is an opportunity that I seek to really enhance,” Vice Provost for Research Pamela Norris said at the meeting. “That is a competitive intelligence looking at what the landscape of our peers look like, where we can be distinctive in what our strengths are, perhaps where we might be missing a piece and how we might be able to add to that.”

The team has now notched more conference wins this season than any other during Head Coach Jamion Christian’s tenure. 
Men’s basketball completed the season sweep of Rhode Island on Saturday night thanks to a strong defensive effort.
The Colonials (11-15, 7-7 A-10) were in control all night and won 72-61. The Rams (13-13, 4-10 A-10) have lost nine of their last 10 games, a streak that started with a 63-61 loss to GW on Jan. 22.
“I’m just really happy how our team’s been able to play with laser focus the last few weeks here,” Head Coach Jamion Christian said. “I definitely think we’re getting better every time we’re stepping out there on the floor. I think we’re a dangerous team.”
GW limited the Rams to 45.5 percent shooting from the field and 23.1 percent shooting from three point range while also forcing 17 turnovers.
“We knew what was on the table,” freshman guard Brayon Freeman said. “This would put us in position to start our winning record in the conference.”
Sophomore guard Joe Bamisile led the Colonials in scoring for the second consecutive game with 20 points to go along with four rebounds, three assists and two steals. This was the Chesterfield, Va. local’s ninth 20-plus point game of the season.
“I thought his passing today was even more impressive than his scoring,” Christian said. “He created two or three opportunities for guys that maybe he wouldn’t have earlier in the year and that just shows the kind of confidence that he has in his teammates.”
This is the latest in the season the team has been above .500 since they finished the 2016-17 season at 10-8. This is also the most conference wins the team has had in a season during Christian’s tenure.
Rhode Island took an early 4-3 lead, but after a contested mid-range jumper by Freeman gave GW the lead, the Colonials never trailed.
Freeman paced the Colonials early, driving into the lane and creating shots for himself and his teammates. He had 9 first half points and finished the night with 13 points, three assists, two rebounds and a steal on an efficient 5-8 from the floor.
The Colonials showcased their ball movement early on, dishing out 12 first half assists on 17 made shots to pair with only five turnovers. Senior forward Ricky Lindo Jr. showed out in the ball security front, notching a team-high four assists and only one turnover.
Coming into the matchup with the Rams, Lindo Jr. averaged 2.5 turnovers and 1.4 assists per game. The D.C. native also had 4 points, five rebounds and two blocks.
“I thought his decision making, besides the one turnover, was outstanding today,” Christian said. “His decision making, how he moved the ball, his decision making on the shots that he took, his decision making on the passing that he made.”
On the other end of the court, redshirt sophomore forwards Makhi and Makhel Mitchell gave GW issues down low all night.
The twin brothers combined for 28 points, with Makhi scoring 13 and Makhel scoring 15. The Colonials looked to double team them when they received the ball down low, a strategy that paid off, as they combined for six turnovers and three assists.
GW maintained a consistent lead throughout the first half, with the lead hovering around 10 points. On the final possession of the first half, junior forward Qwanzi Samuels grabbed an offensive rebound, kicked it out to Bamisile, and the Virginia Tech transfer drilled it as the buzzer sounded to put the Colonials up 44-30 at the break.
Rhode Island started the second half on a 10-3 run to pull the Rams within 47-40. But 7 points was as small as the margin would get, as the Colonials clamped down defensively and got timely buckets from an array of sources.
Junior forward Hunter Dean scored 6 of his 7 points in the second half and finished the night 3-4 from the field, capitalizing on the space given to him by the Rams.
Frontcourt foul trouble has been a nagging issue for the Colonials this year, and it was no different against a Rhode Island team that is the 29th best team in the country at getting to the line.
Lindo Jr. picked up his fourth foul with 10:09 remaining in the game, forcing him to sit out down the stretch. Samuels picked up his third foul with 9:02 left, putting Rhode Island on the bonus, and Dean picked up his third with 8:34 remaining.
The Colonials coasted for most of the second half, thanks to continued strong defense and important buckets down the stretch. The team saw three players get into double digit scoring and ended the game with 16 assists on 28 made field goals.
GW is putting the pieces together at the right time and is in position to make it out of the first round of the A-10 tournament for the first time in Christian’s tenure. But the team still has at least three games remaining this season with the potential for a fourth due to a makeup game with St. Bonaventure that is yet to be made up.
“This team can do a lot,” Lindo Jr. said. “We trust each other more and once you have trust in your teammates, you can do a lot of things, a lot of special things.”
Next up for the Colonials is a road matchup with George Mason Sunday at 2:30 p.m. as they look to earn a winning record.

Elana Meyers Taylor was the U.S. flag bearer for the Closing Ceremony on Sunday after being elected by her fellow team members for the honor. 
Softball alumna Elana Meyers Taylor captured her fifth Olympic medal and second of the Beijing Games with a third-place finish in the two-woman bobsled Saturday.
Following her silver-medal performance in the first-ever women’s monobob, Meyers Taylor took home the second bronze of her collection in the two-woman bobsled with Sylvia Hoffman, making her the most decorated Black athlete in winter Olympic history. Meyers Taylor has reached the podium in every showing of her Olympic career, winning the bronze medal in 2010 in her debut and the silver medal in 2014 and 2018 in the two-woman bobsleigh competition.
“I’ve been on Olympic podiums before, but I can’t think of any that’s been harder to get than here,” Meyers Taylor said in a Team USA release. “So it’s just been incredible and I can’t even put into words what this means.”
As the most decorated Team USA Olympic bobsledder of all-time, Meyers Taylor broke a tie with speed skater Shani Davis to become the most decorated Black athlete in Winter Games history while also becoming the first woman to collect two bobsled medals in a single Olympics with the addition of the monobob event this year.
“That is overwhelming,” Meyers Taylor said. “It’s so crazy to hear that stat and know I’m part of a legacy that’s bigger than me.”
Meyers Taylor had been selected as Team USA’s flag bearer, but missed the opening ceremony after testing positive for COVID-19 on Jan. 29, two days after her arrival in Beijing. But Meyers Taylor announced that she had been cleared from isolation on the Today Show on Feb. 5 after receiving two negative COVID-19 tests.
Despite the time spent in isolation, Meyers Taylor placed second in the monobob behind Team USA’s Kallie Humphries who won the gold medal while Canada’s Christine de Bruin won bronze.
In her their medal win, Meyers Taylor and Hoffman came in third in the first two runs behind a duo of German sleds on Friday and then fortified their position over the final two runs on Saturday, setting a record push time of 5.30 seconds in the third heat while finishing with a combined time of 4:05.48 by the final run.
Germany’s Laura Nolte and Deborah Levi captured the Olympic title with a total time of 4:03.96 while Mariama Jamanka and Alexandra Burghardt held up the rear with a second place finish for Germany as well with a combined time of 4:04.73.
Meyers Taylor was the U.S. flag bearer for the Closing Ceremony on Sunday after being elected by her fellow team members for the honor. The last bobsledder to receive the honor was Brian Shimer, who won the four-man bobsled bronze medal in 2002 and has coached Team USA since.
“I can’t say enough about Elana,” Shimer said. “It’s not just how she performs on the ice, but who she is as a person. It brings me back to my own career, when I won the bronze medal in 2002 and carried the flag in Closing Ceremony. I’m reliving that moment, and feel like this is how it was supposed to end.”
Prior to her Olympic career, Meyers Taylor was the first recruit of the GW softball program, named two-time A-10 Student-Athlete of the Year and CoSIDA Academic All-American. Taylor was inducted into the GW Athletics Hall of Fame in 2014, had her number 24 retired a year later and also received an honorary Doctorate of Public Service during Commencement in 2018.

The men’s team repeated its win at the championships, and the women’s team took home first after placing fourth the prior year. 
Building on an impressive season, men’s and women’s swimming and diving both placed first at the Atlantic 10 Championships this past weekend.
The men’s team collected 879.5 points over the four-day tournament to win their second consecutive A-10 title and their fifth in six years while the women’s squad scored 701.5 points to win their second title in three years. With the two victories, the Colonials are the first program with a title sweep since Massachusetts in 2001.
“I don’t know if the meet itself surprised me, other than how exceptionally we performed in the water,” Head Coach Brian Thomas said. “I thought we would win. You know, going into it, having scored it out, I thought we would win if we just did what we’re capable of doing.”
Thomas was named Coach of the Year for the second straight year and the third time in four years.
Senior Marek Osina led the men’s team, winning seven gold medals and the Most Outstanding Performer award.
He set an A-10 record in the 200 individual medley with a time of 1:44.72 and won his third individual gold in the 200 back. The Czech Republic native built upon his four gold medals from last year’s A-10 Championship for a total of 13 medals, 12 of which are gold.
Freshman Connor Rogers picked up the Most Outstanding Rookie Performer award after earning gold in the 500 free with a time of 4:24.11 and a bronze in the 200 fly.
Senior Ryan Patterson said the championship was the first A-10 for “almost half the team” and said the seniors used it as an opportunity to help the younger members in their development.
“I think that the most important part of the senior leaders right now is being able to teach those younger ones who have the speed how to be emotionally invested in a meet and still be able to calm it down,” Patterson said.
Freshman Philip Moldovanu, sophomore Durde Matic and sophomore Karol Mlynarczyk collected individual wins. Mlynarczyk finished the 100 back with a time of 47.46 seconds for his third gold of the meet.
Matic set an A-10 record in the 50 free with a time of 19.56 seconds. He also set a meet record in the 100 fly, finishing the weekend with six gold medals and seven overall.
The men’s 200 medley relay team of Osina, junior Tyler Kawakami, Matic and Mlynarczyk set a conference record with a time of 1:25.78. The men’s squad collected gold in all five relay events.
“One thing I always think about is, ‘Let’s just put the odds in our favor,’” Thomas said. “If we continue to put the odds in our favor of having success, it will come.”
On the women’s side, senior Erin McCarthy won gold in the 500 free with a time of 4:48.47, knocking almost three seconds off her personal best. She also collected gold in 1,650 free, finishing the weekend with three medals total.
Freshman Molly Smyers, freshman Julia Knox and freshman Barbara Schaal also collected multiple individual medals. Knox set a new program record in both the 200 individual medley and the 400 individual medley.
The women’s relay teams medaled in all five events. The 400 medley relay team of sophomore Marlee Rickert, freshman Ava DeAngelis, Schaal and Knox set a new program record with a time of 3:40.52.
“We’re just really, really deep on the women’s side,” Thomas said. “And that’s probably the way to win that conference is to have good depth basically in each event – especially with a conference that has eleven teams in it.”
Senior Isabel Berdecio, who was a part of the women’s last conference championship, said it was an emotional moment for her to win again in her final year.
“This year, I kind of felt just a lot more proud,” Berdicio said. “And because we had won before, I kind of knew what was coming, but this year, I think, being able to look down at all the other swimmers and see the program that our senior class basically helped Brian build, it was a really proud moment for me.”
Thomas said that the team has built a strong culture through the four years that he has coached the program, and that has been the difference in their success.
“Coming to swim at GW means being a part of a culture that’s bigger than yourself,” Thomas said. “And really you’re joining a family here. And they really bought into that, top to bottom. So it’s been definitely gratifying. And I’m just grateful to be a part of it. It was the kind of season I didn’t want it to come to an end.”
Junior diver Jamie Doak said the “best part” of the meet was how supportive everyone was of each other both during and afterwards.
“Like when the women got called up, the men made sure they were all congratulating us – they made a tunnel for us to run through and everything,” Doak said. “It wasn’t just one team winning and the other team winning it was all of us together.”

The newly launched myResearch platform includes a comment section for research proposals and a budget creation tool. 
The University launched a new research administration website Tuesday to allow faculty members to better track research proposals and awards.
The myResearch platform allows faculty members to create research proposals, view new awards like federal grants and easily address reviews from other faculty members in one location. Pamela Norris, the vice provost for research, announced the website’s launch as part of multiple “enhancements” that officials will implement to increase the University’s research output.
The new website replaces Cayuse, the University’s previous electronic research administration platform.
“We look forward to celebrating our complete transition and our successful transition from Cayuse to the much more user-friendly and comprehensive Huron platform of myResearch,” Norris said at a Faculty Senate meeting Friday.
The new website addresses 10 recommendations that faculty propose in a 2020 research ecosystem report, including streamlined communication, greater transparency with workflow activity and flexible, consistent project budgets, according to a video on the University’s Office of Sponsored Projects website. Some of the new features on myResearch include a comment section for feedback to research investigators submitting proposals and a budget-creation tool that allows the researchers to set their own project budget, according to the video.
Researchers needed to enter, review and submit their proposals in Cayuse by last Wednesday before a blackout period shut down the platform from last Thursday to Monday to complete the data transfer process, according to the University’s website. Users could not access or edit research proposals during this time period.
Researchers will be able to log into Cayuse, download documents and view previously submitted proposals until the end of March, but officials are encouraging users to start viewing their proposal statuses and creating new research agreement requests on myResearch, according to the video.

The Colonials remained in control through the first half but could not hold the lead to finish the game.
Women’s basketball fell to Davidson on the road Wednesday night.
The Colonials (11-15, 4-9 A-10) buckled to the Wildcats (14-2, 6-9 A-10) 51-46 in their final road game of the regular season. The Colonials held the lead through the first half, but the Wildcats gained ground in the second half, capitalizing on a struggling GW offense.
Redshirt junior forward Mayowa Taiwo led all players on the court with 15 points, finishing 7-of-11 from the field. On the other side of the court, senior guard Chloe Welch ended the night with 13 points shooting 4-of-13 from the floor and 4-of-4 from the line.
GW put up a strong defensive start to the first quarter, holding the Wildcats to just 4-of-12 shooting from the field. Sophomore guard Aurea Gingras got the Colonials started with a pair of mid-range scores, giving her team the early advantage.
After a 3-ball from graduate student guard Kyara Frames, the Wildcats converted two quick scores off turnovers and cut the GW lead to just one. As the first quarter wound down, GW dominated the paint scoring three straight from inside the box and extending their lead to 16-9.
But a buzzer-beater 3 from Davidson junior guard Cameron Tabor sliced the lead to just four heading into the second quarter.​​
The Colonials remained in the driver’s seat in the second quarter, never relinquishing their lead and extending it to an eight-point advantage mid-way through. Taiwo dominated from down low, netting 10 points and five rebounds through the first half on the way to her second double-double in the last three games.
The second quarter saw better shooting efficiency from both sides and with five minutes to go, GW held a comfortable eight-point lead. But the Wildcats would not go away quietly, going on a 7-0 run led by junior guard Suzi-Rose Deegan, slashing the lead to just one point.
The half finished with two Wildcat fouls, but GW finished just 1-of-5 from the line, an area with which they’ve struggled all season. The Colonials are 59.9 percent from the line compared to their opponents’ overall of 63.7 percent.
By the end of the half, the Colonials were 12-of-26 from the field and 3-of-8 from beyond the arc compared to Davidson’s 9-of-22 from the floor and 3-of-7 from deep.
The second half got off to a slow start offensively, as neither team scored within the first two minutes. After a wide open, game-tying layup for Davidson, the free-throw line woes continued for GW with Taiwo notching a quick 0-of-2 from the stripe.
The Wildcats grabbed their first lead of the night on an inbounds give-and-go, setting the stage for a tight finish. Shortly thereafter, GW called a momentum-stopping timeout to regroup with 7:07 left in the third quarter.
The rest of the third quarter saw both teams trading leads, mostly scoring inside as GW continued to struggle from the line. With just seconds to go, Taiwo drew a foul and converted 1-of-2 from the stripe, trimming the Davidson lead to just one heading into the fourth.
Davidson opened the fourth quarter with a beautiful reverse layup from senior guard Sarah Konstas that extended their lead to three. After trading buckets, the Wildcats signaled a timeout with seven minutes to play leading 42-39.
After another three straight mid-range scores from Davidson, GW found themselves down a game-high nine points with just 6:00 to play. But the Colonials cobbled together a run of their own, scoring five consecutive points, including a big-time shot from beyond the arc by Frames less than 30 seconds later.
Attempting to cut the lead to just one possession, Taiwo stepped up to the line but missed both free shots. Davidson responded with two free throws of their own, going up 49-44 with three minutes to play.
Scoring from the low post again, Taiwo secured a layup to cut the Davidson lead to three, with 2:34 to go. Another defensive stop set the Colonials up for a potential game-tying possession, but they came up empty, turning the ball over with 1:06 left and still trailing by three.
After trading turnovers both ways, the Colonials were forced to foul following a missed layup by Frames, sealing their fate with nine seconds trailing by five points. In what Head Coach Caroline McCombs called their “Achilles’ heel” last week, GW shot just 4-of-15 from the free throw line, a deciding factor in the defeat.
For their final regular season game, the Colonials will take on La Salle at home Saturday for a 2 p.m. tipoff.

SBA Sen. Jacob Linker sponsored the Senate Outreach Act, which senators passed unanimously at Tuesday night’s meeting. 
The Student Bar Association Senate voted to start tabling around GW Law buildings to ramp up student outreach efforts at its meeting Tuesday.
Senators passed the Senate Outreach Act to require at least one senator to run an outreach table biweekly at lounges in law school buildings, where they can answer questions about the SBA, hear concerns and connect with the student body. SBA Sen. Jacob Linker, a third-year law student who sponsored the act, said senators will host a table on weeks when the senate doesn’t meet to accommodate senators’ schedules.
Linker said the SBA should follow the example of other student organizations that run tabling events throughout the year on campus to increase engagement with the student body because senators are responsible to represent and understand law students as elected leaders.
“If you want people to come to SBA, their student government has to be present to them,” he said. “Members of Congress have local offices. They don’t demand you just schlep all the way to Washington.”
Senators also voted to request that law professors provide “relevant, helpful practice exams” to help students prepare for tests. Linker, who introduced the bill, said practice exams should be based on recent and relevant work instead of outdated practice exams from previous years.
“Even if you find some random other professor’s exam, the professors give you different tests, write different styles and formats, time breakdowns and whatnot, and it’s just very helpful as students to have these,” he said.
The senate passed two other acts to modify the bylaws to streamline the SBA’s internal operations relating to legislation submission and committee appointments. Senators voted to move up the deadline for submitting senate legislation from three to seven days before the meeting, and they altered the senate’s committee appointment process with new provisions that allow committee members to record interviews and prohibit members from reconsidering nominees whom the senate previously rejected.
Senators unanimously approved an ad hoc request of nearly $6,400 for the Equal Justice Foundation’s Spring Auction – an annual fundraising event that raises money for students participating in unpaid summer public interest work.
SBA Sen. Sydney Blitman, a second-year law student, said the University typically funds the event, but officials asked the SBA to fund the event this spring. She said the SBA agreed to fund this event only if the University said it would start funding the auction again in 2023.
Blitman said the University’s decision to turn to the SBA for funding support was “inappropriately placed” because it takes money away from the reserved funds the SBA set aside for the Student Assistance Fund – a law school fund that provides grants of about $500 to students with “sudden” financial need.
Senators unanimously passed legislation to remove the chief of staff reports, which provide updates on the executive branch, to simplify and shorten senate meetings.
The senate also unanimously approved an application from the Entertainment and Sports Law Association to publish a blog in the GW Law School Blog and Journal to cover how law shapes entertainment and professional sports, which the GW Law School Blog and Journals do not currently cover, according to the legislation.
The next SBA Senate meeting will be held on March 15 at 9:15 p.m. in the Law Learning Center.

Vice Provost for Research Pamela Norris said she hopes to attain more philanthropic support for research from non-profit organizations. 
Updated: Feb. 25, 2022 at 3:43 p.m.
The University’s federal research expenditures increased by $22 million during Fiscal Year 2021, according to an annual research report delivered during a Faculty Senate meeting Friday.
Vice Provost for Research Pamela Norris said federal expenditures jumped to $189 million in FY 2021, up from $167 million during the previous year, extending what has become a nine-year rise in financial research support from federal funding agencies. She said health-related sponsored research activities made up 71 percent – $199.1 million – of GW’s total expenditures while science and engineering research projects received a combined $20.8 million.
Norris said that 5.6 percent of the University’s federal research expenditures, about $15.7 million, came from federal sponsors supporting research in the arts and humanities, and 3.8 percent, about $10.7 million, came from federal sponsors supporting the social sciences.
“I think there’s an opportunity to increase the non-federal total expenditures while continuing to advance the federal expenditures,” she said.
She said the University expended more than $200 million on research efforts during FY 2021, and there were more than 1,600 awards active from federal organizations, foundations, non-profit organizations and industry associations.
She said while GW received nearly 85 percent of its research funding – $188.8 million – from the federal government, she hopes to garner more philanthropic support for research from foundations and non-profit organizations. The University ranked 86th out of 653 higher education institutions in federally funded research expenditures, according to the National Science Foundation’s Higher Education Research and Development survey, which measures how much a university annually spends from federal agencies on research projects.
More than $157.5 million of GW’s research expenditures in FY 2020, across all disciplines, came from federal sponsors, according to the NSF’s website.
Norris said the University research community published six books, 74 chapters, 117 editorials and 156 letters in 2021, pushing the total number of publications past 4,500 documents. Researchers released nearly 4,000 publications in 2020 and nearly 3,500 in 2019, according to Scopus, a database of scholarly literature.
She said isolation throughout the pandemic allowed faculty members to write and publish their results, which led to a “significant” increase in the number of publications.
Norris said she aims to work more with faculty members to transition their projects from the labs to the markets and establish a foundation for a stronger research enterprise at GW. She said she is aware of the need for additional pod support after officials decentralized the University’s research model in 2020, noting that some research areas still need more attention to funding and development.
She added that meeting with funding agencies will help her better understand research trends to set up federal funding opportunities that the University can benefit from in the future.
“I think research development is an opportunity that I seek to really enhance,” Norris said. “That is a competitive intelligence looking at what the landscape of our peers look like, where we can be distinctive in what our strengths are, perhaps where we might be missing a piece and how we might be able to add to that.”
This post has been updated to correct the following:
An earlier version of this post attributed that researchers released nearly 4,000 publications in 2020 and nearly 3,500 in 2019 to University data. The information came from the online database Scopus. We regret this error. An earlier version of this post also stated that GW received more than $200 million in research funding in FY 2021. The University expended more than $200 million on research in FY 2021. We regret this error.

Officials are considering establishing a student writing and research prize dedicated to Larsen. 
Katherine Larsen, a teaching assistant professor in the University Writing Program, died earlier this month. She was 63.
Larsen joined GW in 1995, with faculty recalling her teaching about seven University Writing courses each year and interacting with more than 3,000 students during her tenure, according to officials. Larsen – a notable academic of fandom, which encompasses fans of media or people – was a founder and editor for the Journal of Fandom Studies, authored multiple books on the subject and regularly spoke at national conferences on the importance of fandom studies in higher education.
She was also a prominent supporter of labor rights for faculty and staff at GW, working to form the first part-time faculty union as an advocate and member of its bargaining committee nearly 15 years ago. Larsen also served on the Faculty Association steering committee and Contract Faculty Group, which specifically advocated for faculty without tenure status at GW.
Gordon Mantler, the executive director of the University Writing Program, said officials are considering establishing a student writing and research prize dedicated to Larsen. He said the talks are still preliminary, and officials are still trying to determine which students would be eligible to apply and what the focus of the award would be.
“Many of my memories of Kathy revolved around our shared conviction for greater equity at the University through our work together in GWUFA – she was a stalwart on the group’s steering committee for years,” he said in a statement.
Faculty and students who knew her said she was a dedicated scholar and faculty member who pushed her students to investigate less-explored academic topics in culture and media.
Abby Wilkerson, an associate professor of writing, said Larsen was a consistent advocate for her fellow colleagues and other faculty members. She said Larsen regularly criticized University policies that prevented or discouraged contingent or part-time faculty members from receiving promotions or serving in administrative positions.
“I’ll always be grateful for her tireless work on behalf of contingent faculty,” she said in a statement. “At that time, when the phrase ‘hotbed of union organizing’ was being applied to GW, the English Department in particular, another colleague did some digging and learned that over 60% of GW faculty had contingent positions then. That has changed, and Kathy played a big part in that.”
Wilkerson said Larsen was always a friendly face in the English Department and would give her colleagues personal and professional advice. She said Larsen would help with topics ranging from lesson plans to making bread with yeast.
“I said I’d be trying to get a sourdough starter going (my first time), and soon Kathy was cheerfully and concisely delivering an invaluable on-the-spot tutorial on the ways and means of sourdough,” she said. “Was there anything she couldn’t do, and do well?”
Heather Schell, an assistant professor of writing, said Larsen’s work had visible effects on the entertainment industry as she researched the viewer base of different media and television networks for a series of books she wrote on the topic. She said Larsen worked with the directors and leading actors of “Supernatural” – a dark fantasy television series – to shape the plots and references in the show and garnered academic respect for her focused area of study.
“Kathy and I regularly attended the same national conference, so I got to witness her star power in action many times,” she said in a statement. “We’d make plans to have dinner one night, and while walking to the restaurant, a number of enthusiastic colleagues would cluster around her, chatting animatedly and inveigling their way into the group.”
Schell said students and faculty would physically gravitate toward Larsen because of her friendly attitude and helpful demeanor.
“I’ve heard another professor refer to Kathy as their ‘acafandom hero,’” she said. “Almost all the fandom tchotchkes in her office were offerings from fans, fan studies colleagues and students.”
After Larsen’s passing, Gelman Library staff added her name and “Fangasm” – the title of her book about “Supernatural” and what fans will do to contact their favoring actors – to the search bar on the front page of their website to honor her research and time at GW.
Anna Connelly, a senior studying English and communications who took Larsen’s University Writing class as a freshman, said Larsen is one of the biggest reasons why she decided to work as a consultant at the Writing Center and continue her studies in the English Department.
“She’s definitely impacted how I go about interacting with pop culture and intertwining academic studies with that,” Connelly said. “But also, the path that she assisted me to get onto through the Writing Center has been really helpful, because after I came to the Writing Center, I’ve been able to get a lot of internships, and then after that I was able to actually get a job before I even graduated.”
Connelly said people who don’t see Fandom studies as a legitimate academic area of expertise often professionally “stigmatized” the topic without giving it much professional attention. But she said analyzing the media industry and its audience is a good way to teach students how to think and write critically.
“I think she was really great about encouraging students to lean into that instead of practicing this academic distance that we’re used to in a lot of other subjects,” she said. “So I think she was great at teaching us how to incorporate our own personal interests into – quote, unquote – ‘respectable fields of study.’”
Danika Myers, the director of the first-year writing program, said Larsen was a hardworking member of the University Writing Program and regularly helped other faculty develop their curriculums and shape lesson plans.
“She’d be sitting there, working on three projects at once, with an episode of Supernatural playing in the background on her computer, but she never acted like it was an imposition to help me think through a lesson plan or listen to me tell her a story about my kid because she had a generous heart,” she said.
