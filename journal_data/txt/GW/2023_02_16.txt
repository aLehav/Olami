Students gathered in Kogan Plaza in December to protest a student conduct investigation into the president of Students for Justice in Palestine for alleged postering damage. The student conduct case is part of an alleged trend of racism that the complaint states Palestinian students have faced in the last two years.
A federal civil rights complaint filed against GW Tuesday is calling on the Department of Education to investigate years of “unabated” racism against Palestinian students on campus, according to a release issued by a Palestinian rights advocacy organization Wednesday.
The release states Palestine Legal filed the Title VI complaint with the department’s Office of Civil Rights to investigate the “years-long, hostile environment of anti-Palestinian racism” at GW, marked by three instances of alleged racism that have sparked heated debate and protest on campus within the past two years. The release alleges the racist treatment occurred when administrators and trustees denied Palestinian students access to mental health services in 2021, GW Hillel wrongfully accused the president of Students for Justine in Palestine of a conduct violation this past fall and students made anti-Palestinian comments in a class that same semester.
Palestine Legal is representing three students who allege they were the target of anti-Palestinian discrimination, according to the release. Radhika Sainath, a senior staff attorney for Palestine Legal, declined to release a copy of the complaint, saying Palestine Legal wanted to protect the students from “backlash and retaliation” from pro-Israel groups.
“There is simply no justification for GW’s racist, bigoted treatment of Palestinians,” Sainath said in the release. “Even if pro-Israel groups don’t like it and complain, the law is clear, Palestinian students are entitled to the same education and services as other students.”
Sainath said in an email that the organization hopes the University will issue a public apology acknowledging officials denied support services for Palestinian students and targeted Palestinian groups in disciplinary proceedings. She said the organization is demanding officials work with GW’s Office of Advocacy and Support to provide Palestinian students support for violence- and discrimination-related trauma.
“So deep is the anti-Palestinian prejudice, that GW even prohibited the provision of mental health services to Palestinian students like our client, who had suffered trauma,” Sainath said in an email. “Even if providing such services to Palestinian students and supporting Palestinian human rights spark complaints from anti-Palestinian groups, the law does not allow GW to discriminate on the basis of national origin or ethnicity with regards to campus services.”
Sainath said Palestine Legal is urging the University against adopting the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism, which she said could facilitate anti-Palestinian discrimination on campus and prohibit individuals from criticizing the Israeli government.
More than 1,000 people signed a petition by the non-profit Combat Antisemitism Movement calling on the University to adopt the definition in November 2021 after a Torah scroll was vandalized in Tau Kappa Epsilon’s on-campus house. Supporters of the IHRA definition said it would standardize the process for university leaders to recognize and respond to acts of antisemitism on campus.
Sainath said the definition would be an “authoritative” tool to combat antisemitism on campus.
“The IHRA definition would require universities to punish faculty whose research suggests the Israeli state has engaged in racist practices – while allowing research that makes the same critique of the U.S. or other governments,” Sainath said.
University spokesperson Julia Metjian said officials have not seen Palestine Legal’s complaint. Metjian declined to say how officials will respond to the new complaint.
“The George Washington University strongly condemns hatred, discrimination and bias in all forms, and we are committed to fostering an environment in which the entire community feels safe and free of harassment, hostility or marginalization,” Metjian said in an email.
A Department of Education spokesperson declined to comment.
The recent filing is Palestine Legal’s second complaint against the University in the last two years.
The organization filed a complaint with the D.C. Office of Human Rights in November 2021, alleging the Board of Trustees and the Office of the President called an emergency meeting in June to direct the Office of Advocacy and Support to take down an Instagram post about a virtual healing space for Palestinian students in the wake of widespread violence in Gaza.
Palestine Legal represented Students for Justice in Palestine roughly a year later when the student organization and its sophomore president Lance Lokas were facing disciplinary charges from the University for “misconduct related to property.” SJP led a postering campaign outside of the GW Hillel building in October to protest a GW Hillel speaker event featuring Doron Tenne, a former Israeli Defense Forces intelligence officer.
The posters read messages like “Decolonize Palestine,” “Zionists F*** Off” and “War criminals GTFO.” GW Hillel Director Adena Kirstein said they caused between $1,200 and $4,500 in damage to benches outside of the building.
The Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities cleared SJP and Lokas of the charges later that month. An SRR investigation concluded that Lokas instructed all participants of the protest before the event to hang the posters exclusively on public property while following guidelines and laws surrounding wheatpasting, a process of hanging posters with a mixture of starch and water.
The complaint filed last week states the University subjected SJP to a “months-long disciplinary process” related to the accusations of vandalism outside of the Hillel building, even though a “white, Jewish” student already admitted to the postering damage, according to the release. Palestine Legal said in a December release that members of Jewish Voice for Peace publicly took credit for the postering weeks before the disciplinary hearing.
An Instagram post from SJP Wednesday states members stand in “full support” of the complaint, and their members have experienced discrimination congruent with its allegations.
“GW has proven time and time again that it will continue to align itself with the Zionist lobby, choosing the interests of right-wing, pro-Israel organizations over the safety and protection of its Palestinian and Arab community members,” they said.
GW Hillel declined to comment.
Palestine Legal also responded to a separate Title VI complaint that pro-Israel non-profit StandWithUs filed against GW last month, which alleged that Lara Sheehi, an assistant professor of clinical psychology, was antisemitic toward and “retaliated” against Jewish and Israeli students in a Professional Psychology Program course last semester. Palestine Legal’s release states officials did not properly address alleged anti-Palestinian comments students made during the class.
StandWithUs’ complaint states officials allegedly brought “disciplinary proceedings” against the Jewish students who raised concerns about an optional guest presentation from Nadera Shalhoub-Kevorkian, the chair of law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, as well as Sheehi’s class discussions and readings. The complaint alleges Shalhoub-Kevorkian and the class discussions and readings portrayed Israel and Jewish people in a negative light.
Palestine Legal’s complaint filed last week alleges that students in Sheehi’s course made “numerous anti-Palestinian comments” during the class that followed Shalhoub-Kevorkian’s presentation, according to the release.
Sheehi spoke out against StandWithUs’ complaint in an article published in the left-leaning magazine CounterPunch earlier this month, contesting that the allegations promoted “racist, anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian tropes” to disparage her. She said she has received racist messages and death threats, and her personal information has been leaked online since StandWithUs filed the complaint.
Sheehi said students who raised concerns with Shalhoub-Kevorkian’s presentation engaged in “racist rhetoric” about Shalhoub-Kevorkian in the class session that followed her presentation, suggesting she was a “terrorist” who advocated for violence against Jewish people.
Administrators reportedly asked one of the students involved in filing Palestine Legal’s complaint to attend a “restorative circle” with students in the class who allegedly made anti-Palestinian statements, like that Palestinians whom the Israeli army have killed are “terrorists,” according to a Jewish Currents article.
A Palestine Legal spokesperson told Jewish Currents the University hired two “external facilitators” responsible for discussing the situation with students who were involved, who then allegedly told the students to “think about the harm” they had caused.

Prior to the announcement, GW was the only "large, urban" university in the U.S. that still enforced a mask mandate, according to a Hatchet analysis of 229 universities.
The University’s classroom mask mandate will end on Feb. 27, according to a Thursday release from officials.
Officials will still require face coverings in University-operated health care facilities, like the Student Health Center and Medical Faculty Associates, as well as mandate community members to wear a mask for 10 days after a positive COVID test, according to the release. The unsigned release states that officials chose to drop the mandate because of the University’s high vaccination rate and low rates of infection and hospitalization from COVID-19 in the District.
“Although masks will be optional on our campuses, their use is strongly encouraged,” the release states.
The District has a daily average of 64 new COVID cases as of Thursday, according to a New York Times dashboard. DC Health has not classified COVID-19 transmission levels as “high” since late January 2022.
Prior to the announcement, GW was the only “large, urban” university in the U.S. that still enforced a mask mandate, according to a Hatchet analysis of 229 universities.
“Individuals may choose whether to wear a mask based on a variety of reasons,” the release states. “We ask that you respect the personal decisions of others.”
The release states officials will continue to provide free N95 masks at COVID-19 testing centers and the University will maintain its vaccine and booster requirements.
Officials dropped its indoor mask mandate in University-owned or operated facilities in September, but required students to continue wearing masks in instructional settings, health care facilities and University-operated transportation. Officials briefly dropped the indoor mask mandate last April but reinstated the requirement just a week later after a surge in positive cases.
After the mask mandate is lifted, Gallaudet University will be the only university in the District with a classroom mask mandate. The University of the District of Columbia and Georgetown, American, Catholic and Howard universities dropped their mask mandates last year.

The National Park Service cleared an encampment at McPherson Square Wednesday, where 56 people lived in one of the largest unhoused communities in D.C.
The crews, who were initially slated to come at the end of April, gave residents a two-week notice before clearing out the space and scattered belongings left behind. NPS spokesman Mike Litterst said the eviction plans were expedited because of a “concern for health and safety.”
Over at the White House, John Kirby, the coordinator for strategic communications at the National Security Council, responded to a barrage of questions Friday about the unidentified flying object that military personnel shot down over frozen waters near Alaska, less than a week after a U.S. fighter jet took down a Chinese spy balloon over the Atlantic Ocean.

Ivan Gomza, the academic director of the Public Policy and Governance Program at Ukraine’s Kyiv School of Economics, presented research Wednesday that found connections between the prevalence of populist beliefs and vaccine hesitancy.
Gomza said he hypothesized that populist sentiments would correspond with more pronounced vaccine hesitancy. Gomza’s findings indicate his hypothesis to be valid and provided insights into the perspectives of middle-class Ukrainians. The virtual event was hosted by the Petrach Program on Ukraine – a program within GW’s Institute for European, Russian and Eurasian Studies – and moderated by Elizabeth Wishnick, a professor of political science and law at Montclair State University in New Jersey.
Gomza, a former fellow with the Petrach Program, said his findings came from a questionnaire sent out in 2021 and largely responded to by middle-class Ukrainians. He said this resulted in some elitist and populist bias, mostly stemming from their affluent position in society.
He also said the views of these Ukrainians can be attributed to their “upbringing, status and internalization of the dominant liberal discourse.”
“Notably, these middle-class members nurture some populist sentiments only when assessing the political performance of the authorities or when contemplating the inflated political influence of the oligarchs whom the respondents consider an interest group and very different from other citizens,” Gomza said.
Gomza said after analyzing the responses from his questionnaire, he found the increase in populist sentiments to not be random but statistically significant with vaccine hesitancy.
“A person who worries that minorities in democratic systems can easily impose their will on the general public, a person who rejects the principle of democratic rotation and seeks the total domination of his or her political forces and a person who opposes the minimization of the influences of ordinary citizens on political decisions under any circumstances,” Gomza said. “Such a person is not just a citizen with enhanced populist expectations, but also a person with a greater probability to question vaccination.”
Gomza said he next checked for other possible underlying causes between vaccine hesitancy and populist, anti-establishment beliefs. He said he found other variables, like high income or good education, did not notably influence vaccine beliefs, which led to his next step, a regression analysis which measured the strength of “the causal relationship between populism and vaccine hesitancy.”
Gomza said his results confirm his key hypothesis linking vaccine hesitancy with populist beliefs, but a regression analysis he ran found there to be other factors besides populism responsible for variations in hesitancy towards vaccinations. He said his conclusions still could not be disqualified, however, as vaccine hesitancy is a “complex, multi-causal belief.”
“Although vaccine hesitancy cannot be attributed solely to the intensity of populist sentiments, populism undoubtedly pushes people closer toward vaccine hesitancy,” Gomza said.

Rogers strutted onstage in a glistening, black leather jacket she quickly shed to reveal a pale blue slip dress with feather detailing. She began her set with “Overdrive,” the first track on “Surrender,” guiding the audience into a thrilling performance.
“It’s good to be home,” alternative indie singer Maggie Rogers told the crowd with affection as she took the stage at The Anthem, performing in the District for the first time since her “Heard It In A Past Life Tour” in 2019.
Rogers – an Eastern Shore, Maryland native – headlined two consecutive, sold-out nights Monday and Tuesday on the second stop of her aptly titled “Feral Joy Tour.” Rogers was supported by opener Del Water Gap, her college bandmate and longtime friend. With stunning vocals and an impeccable stage presence, Rogers took the energetic crowd on a raw, emotional journey complete with cathartic screaming, eclectic dancing and even some tears as she performed hits from her sophomore album “Surrender.”
Rogers said the hometown show was “special for her,” telling the crowd that her mom, middle school math teacher, first-ever friend and childhood neighbors were all supporting her in the audience. Rogers said in an Instagram video that the first show she ever played was at Merriweather Post Pavilion in Maryland, so her performance this week represented a homecoming to the DMV area.
Rogers may have been surrounded by pristine white daisies onstage, but her performance was anything but delicate. Rogers created a powerful buildup to her dynamic performance with a pre-recorded audio of a poem she wrote prior to the album’s release set alongside stunning visuals, prompting an explosive reaction from the audience, who recognized the poem from the official “Surrender” trailer.
“When I’m angry or in love, I feel it in my teeth / Strange harmonic buzzing / Cuts through my hands / My jaw / My breast bone / For a long time I fought it / Resisted / Held up my fists,” Rogers’ voice echoed in an interlude. “This is the story of what happened when I finally gave in.”
Rogers strutted onstage in a glistening, black leather jacket she quickly shed to reveal a pale blue slip dress with feather detailing. She began her set with “Overdrive,” the first track on “Surrender,” guiding the audience into a thrilling performance.
But the intoxicating first notes of “Want Want,” the second single from the album, invigorated the crowd and truly set the tone for the rest of the performance. As Rogers sang the electrifying chorus – “Might die if you can’t live just to taste it” – the audience became so exhilarated that the room felt overcome with a captivating essence.

The band – two guitarists, a keyboardist, a drummer and a percussionist – matched Rogers’ energy precisely, singing along to each song behind their instruments and interacting with one another on stage. Rogers took several dance breaks to rock out with her two guitarists in spirited fits of movement.
Rogers, who became one of the first 11 people to receive a Master of Religion and Public Life degree from the Harvard Divinity School last year, said her education has led her to view “performance as a practice of presence” to make art feel sacred, which was evident throughout her set. She moved across the stage effortlessly, clearly feeling every word of each song throughout her entire body.

Rogers played her hit single “Love You For A Long Time” in honor of Galentine’s Day – the day before Valentine’s Day – and dedicated the heartwarming track “I’ve Got a Friend” to “everyone that came here tonight with their best friend.” As she sang both songs, the audience clutched onto their concert buddies in a touching display of friendship and love, a consistent theme in Rogers’ music.
During her set, Rogers confided in the audience that she used to feel “insecure” about playing guitar when she first took up music as a young girl. She expressed gratitude to her fans for their loyal support, allowing her to reach the self-confidence she experienced while playing “Begging for Rain” on her acoustic guitar.
Del Water Gap joined Rogers about halfway through the set to perform “New Song,” the final track the pair wrote together nearly 20 years ago. Their chemistry was impeccable – each glance they shared made the audience squeal with excitement. The two talented vocalists harmonized beautifully to create an emotionally charged sound matching the song’s lyrics.
Rachel Schwartz | Assistant Photo Editor
Deviating from her slower ballads, Rogers performed upbeat, romantic anthems “Shatter” and “Anywhere With You,” prompting a high-voltage feeling among the crowd with her passionate singing and dancing. Rogers put new twists on many old songs, adding rock elements to typically electronically produced songs like “Fallingwater” and “Alaska.” The masterful performer complimented each song with improvised belting and riffs that showcased her vocal prowess.
Before performing her uplifting track “Light On,” Rogers pointed out two tables set up towards the back of the venue where audience members could register to vote and support Planned Parenthood’s “Bans Off Our Bodies” campaign. She also expressed her support for the movement to protect the Chesapeake Bay in Virginia and Maryland, saying she hopes the bay will remain as blue as her dress.
Rogers closed the show with “Different Kind of World,” a touching ballad about hope and looking toward the future in the midst of fear. Lingering on the final lines of the song, she sang “When we’re riding all together it’s a different kind of world / I’m a different kind of girl.” Rogers’ harrowingly beautiful voice provided a poignant finish to a vibrant performance that served as a testament to Rogers’ ascension as an untouchable force in the music industry.

Rogers appeared elated looking out at the crowd at the end of the show. She made her homecoming, and the District welcomed her with open arms.

Dear Annie,
I’m in love with this boy, but our mutual friend indirectly refuses to try and set me up with him. Should I dump this “friend”?
Xoxo,
DW
Dear DW,
Do you remember the PBS Kids’ series “Arthur?” His younger sister, DW, achieved notoriety for her stubborn and entitled nature. Just check out the memes of her rattling a wired fence with tinted sunglasses and touting her illiteracy as an excuse for breaking the rules. If a friend stood in her way, she would undoubtedly address the issue through direct communication. Explain how you feel.
Jenna Baer | Cartoonist
You do not need to “dump” your friend, but you do need to have an open conversation to discern why they hesitate to help you. Even when elementary schoolers breach each other’s trust, they’ll take a trip to the playground and resolve the issue.
After sharing what makes this crush special, listen to your friend’s piece. They may not feel obligated to orchestrate a romantic interaction – especially if you’re not close enough. In “Arthur,” the ambitious DW made the most of every opportunity, so follow her lead in pursuing the boy some other way. Find another mutual friend or – bold idea – approach him yourself.
It’s also worth considering this friend could be trying to protect you. Even the illiterate DW would take the hint that your friend may have doubts about the success of this prospective relationship. Maybe they’re trying to save you from venturing down the wrong path. Perhaps, like Arthur’s friend Binky Barnes, he only speaks in rhyme. Or maybe the boy just isn’t interested, and your friend is worried about protecting your feelings.
But if your friend already brushed off your request for a conversation, that could be a red flag that they don’t care about your feelings. While friendships may not need total transparency or cooperation, they do need compassion. Can you have a friend who is indifferent to your wants and desires?
If you decide to pursue the boy despite your friend’s reason (or non-reason), make your intentions clear to your friend before finding other avenues to seek him out. Blindsiding your friend who might be looking out for your best interests suggests you don’t value their opinion, and you already know how frustrating a friend’s discourtesy feels. Like DW, don’t fear being brutally honest when it comes to your priorities.
In breaking the news to your friend, be specific about why this boy is the apple of your eye to appeal to your friend’s perhaps dormant romantic side. Does he make insightful observations like Arthur’s classmate The Brain? Do his blue eyes remind you of Arthur’s best friend Buster Baxter’s vivid sweater? Sharing an unforgettable attribute about this boy with your friend may open their heart to playing matchmaker.
Don’t be those clichéd friends who have a fallout over a romantic interest. Before connecting with the boy, focus on communication with your friend. Ask them if they have time for a quick malt – and I know you can read that, DW, so go for it!
Get along with each other,
Annie<3
Facing a problem, yourself? Annie has answers. Ask away!

I had no doubts about applying to GW in high school. My early decision choice was easy – the School of Media and Public Affairs looked like the only place that I belonged. Mere scans of SMPA’s course catalog sparked my ambition more than any high school class ever did. I thought that I was destined to study political communication, a unique major that focuses on my strongest interests in media and government. Excited to have found my calling, I submitted my application and hoped for the best.
When I was admitted to GW in December 2020, the weight of my accomplishment nearly distracted me from the bold print of my acceptance letter. Still thrilled by the news of becoming a GW student, I learned that I was rejected from the political communication program and redirected to the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences. My excitement about attending GW lasted for months, but as time progressed, I started to feel dispirited about my denial from SMPA. I thought that my goal of taking Washington’s political scene by storm was dead, and, worse, that I would never get to pursue my passion for the news. As August crept closer, I started to dread course registration. Without access to political communication classes, choosing my schedule seemed like an exercise in futility.
I loved to read growing up, and English was definitely my favorite subject in high school. As a result, and, at the advice of several CCAS academic advisors, I decided to take some English classes while waiting to reapply to SMPA. I wouldn’t be eligible to submit an internal transfer application until the second semester of sophomore year – two whole years away. But, in the meantime, I wanted to continue reading and writing, and I figured that I might even be able to earn an English minor in the process. Alongside a political science class and some general education requirements, I planned to take Introduction to American Literature II in the fall of my freshman year.
That class transformed my college experience. While taking classes from home because of COVID, I found a familiar comfort in our assigned readings and gained confidence in my ability to write about them through the help of my experienced professors. I was hooked on English electives, and, with still a year between my next application to SMPA, I decided to dive into the discipline and take two more English classes in the spring. I rediscovered my love for short stories in American Novel I. F. Scott Fitzgerald’s tales of yesteryear swooped me out of my seat, and I was stunned to learn that some of my favorite authors were actually friends. After reading Ken Kesey’s “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” and watching the book’s 1975 adaptation in The Beat Generation, I proudly called my dad to tell him all about the foundational text of one of his favorite movies.
After crafting my application all semester, I was finally admitted to SMPA over winter break last school year. I celebrated with my parents and told friends who had tracked my progress toward a goal that often felt insurmountable. Thrilled beyond belief, I knew that credit was due in large part to the enduring breadth of my English curriculum at GW. Through the English minor’s many WIDs, I learned how to write persuasively and concisely — skills which undeniably strengthened my application to SMPA. By engaging with a variety of literary perspectives, I traveled through time and traversed foreign lands in my English classes, deepening my comprehension of the human condition.
By the time I was accepted to SMPA, I realized that my English minor was nearly complete. While I was inclined to feel satisfied, I still wanted more from GW’s English classes. I wanted to discover more poetry and allegorical fiction. I wanted to find out who today’s Hemingways and Dickinsons were, and I wanted to stumble across more sentences that make me stop to think about how I’m feeling. So, in the spring of my sophomore year, I made one of the best decisions of my GW career – declaring English as a second major.
Like SMPA, the English department’s faculty is the major’s greatest strength. Professors sponsor open and endlessly-creative classroom discussions that draw themes from classic novels and apply them to today’s world. As a result, I’ve made more friends in my English classes than I have in any others. English professor Dr. Ormond Seavey breathes a current and comedic life into Shakespeare that captivates students’ attention. I learned how to write fiction from bestselling author and professor Louis Bayard and built a library of classics through my coursework.
My English major has taught me so much, but there lies a greater lesson for other students who feel lost. First, rejection shouldn’t discourage you from trying something new. Chasing an available goal doesn’t mean your old one is out of reach, and a change of pace can open limitless doors to future success. Exploring classes in another major like English will dramatically improve your time at GW. Whether you are an undecided freshman or a sophomore studying civil engineering, English faculty always meet students where they are. My English major strengthened my reading and writing skills to make me a better political communication student. More importantly, though, I discovered so much about the world around me through my English classes by reading how others have “put it best.” My advice is to still follow your dreams – just don’t let them distract you from reaching your potential.

When I left high school, I thought I would no longer have to worry about whether my skirt was “too short,” or – God forbid – if my shoulders were visible. I believed that becoming an adult would come with the freedom of choosing what to wear, but I’ve since realized I was wrong. Dress codes are still forced on adult women, and the general public obsesses over what they are wearing – even when they’re in public office.
The Missouri state legislature imposed a stricter dress code on its female lawmakers last month, requiring them to wear a blazer, jacket or cardigan to cover their arms and shoulders. I couldn’t believe my eyes at the blatant sexism and discrimination etched into the new policy. We should be focused on how lawmakers and elected officials of all genders are doing their jobs rather than what the women are wearing.
Missouri state Rep. and Republican Anne Kelley took time out of a meeting last month to introduce legislation outlining the dress code suggesting that women must cover their arms under the guise of “encouraging professionalism.” But a woman’s outfit will not suddenly become significantly more “professional” by covering her arms – it will only undermine her individuality and signal to the public that a woman’s outfit determines her worth and respect, excusing sexism at the government level.
When I was in high school, fashion was a form of self-expression that made me feel confident. One day, I wore a button-up shirt with a leather blazer, heeled boots and a plaid skirt. But my confidence was crushed when administrators called my outfit inappropriate because my skirt had a slit that was half an inch long. They gave me detention and told me to wear leggings under the skirt. This punishment made me late to class, and it was clear my school viewed my clothes as more important than my education. Despite the fact that I was dressed more professionally than most of my classmates, my entire outfit was deemed inappropriate all because of half an inch of fabric, much like female lawmakers in Missouri, who were apparently not dressing “professionally” without a jacket or blazer to accompany their dresses.
But scrutinizing female politicians for what they wear does not stop at the state level. At last week’s State of the Union address, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-GA, heckled President Biden, yelling “Liar!” from her seat. But despite her egregious actions, people took to social media to mock her for her white coat, comparing her to Cruella de Vil. People should be more interested in the ruckus Greene caused at the State of the Union – which showcased deeper division and polarization within our federal government – instead of gawking at what she was wearing. Reducing women in politics to their looks on both sides of the aisle minimizes their voice, detaching their power and potential from the real issues at play.
Yet even if a woman dresses “professionally” and does not wear anything that might draw attention to them, they will still be under scrutiny. In a now-deleted tweet, Washington Examiner writer Eddie Scarry called out Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-NY, saying “…that jacket and coat don’t look like a girl who struggles.” Women in politics are even criticized for daring to look professional if they grew up in the working class. It reminds me of how I received the same treatment when my peers were surprised to find out I came from a low-income background simply because I dressed nicely when I went to school.
The obsession with what women are wearing permeates all aspects of society, but it is especially disheartening to see in politics. There should be a higher level of respect for the lawmakers of our country. Our elected officials aren’t celebrities walking the red carpet at the Grammys – they are deciding the laws which govern our society. When elite professionals seek to impose public dress code restrictions against women, it sends a message to the country that women’s clothing takes a priority over their actions and voice. Perhaps most importantly, it teaches the young girls watching at home to abandon their individuality if they want respect.
I tried to leave behind the dress codes, fashion-related criticism and appearance-based assumptions in my small hometown when I graduated high school. The fact that they actually exist everywhere – even in government – is a hard pill to swallow. The parallels between my own experiences and the experiences of women in politics are especially painful. The female leaders and lawmakers of our country deserve respect simply for the position, power and influence they hold, but a fashion choice can take away from their actions and be used to make assumptions and draw conclusions about them.
For me, fashion is as essential as breathing. Restricting my freedom of self-expression is like taking away what makes me, me. Fashion gives me confidence and helps me feel comfortable in my own skin. To me, it’s not just about fashion, but the very essence of my being. If we keep scrutinizing women for their fashion, why would they ever want to be themselves?
Women, female lawmakers included, should be able to wear what they want and not fear losing society’s respect. The issues that female politicians face are issues that women everywhere are facing, and if these discriminatory actions continue to be excused at the national level, it will be impossible for change to occur. How will high schools ever abandon sexist dress codes when they are only getting stricter in state government? We as a society must give agency to women rather than directly and indirectly policing what they wear.

DCity Smokehouse should be your go-to spot for leisurely dining with friends, a lively atmosphere and great barbecue. Come for the wings, and stay for the good vibes.
Located in the Bloomingdale neighborhood, DCity Smokehouse is serving traditional southern barbecue with a spicy D.C. twist and casual picnic-style dining.
The restaurant opened its doors in 2013 under owners Scott Jacobs and Melvin Hines and the Southeast Restaurant Group, serving up smokehouse-style barbecue from a small corner lot. The Washington Post ranked DCity Smokehouse as the second-best barbecue joint in the D.C. area in 2020, awarding praise for the spot’s classic dishes like smoked wings, brisket, ribs, homemade coleslaw and mac and cheese.
DCity Smokehouse has a casual, rustic ambiance with an interior decked out in wooden furnishings that set the scene of a neighborhood cookout, especially for those dining on the outdoor patio. The counter service-style restaurant features a full bar and TVs to watch your favorite sports.
Indoor seating is limited, capped at 35 seats spread between the bar and a few large tables along the windows. But the covered patio outside with picnic benches set side by side offers a bit more room with 45 seats and a communal feel reminiscent of a family barbecue.
A bright red sign above the door flashes the restaurant’s name alongside a red pig, cow and chicken, welcoming diners to follow the smell of barbecue inside. Large hanging light bulbs illuminate a rustic interior space where exposed brick and wood panels line the walls. A glass-paneled garage door directly across from the bar exposes the street view of Florida Avenue. An upbeat R&B playlist sounds from the speakers as diners grab at the paper towel rolls that sit on either side of the table and invite them to dig in and get their hands dirty.
The indoor seating was filled when I arrived just after 6 p.m. on a Wednesday, though I had no trouble finding a spot outside, where I shared the patio with only one other party. Despite the early February cold, the tent over the patio ensured a comfortable and heated experience.
The menu features all the barbecue classics – smoked wings ($10-$20), ribs ($17-$33), brisket ($8-$28), pulled pork ($7-$23) and a variety of sandwiches ($11-$14) that pair the smoked meats with a mix of sauces and toppings. The side menu ($6 for a small and $10 for a large) carries beloved barbecue fixings, from potato salad and smoky brisket chili to coleslaw and spicy collard greens. Customers have the option to order à la carte or from several platter options, which feature choices of meat and sides.
As an avid fan of wings, I opted for the smoked wings combo ($23) which includes a dozen wings and a small side. I chose DCity’s signature mac and cheese in addition to spicy fries ($6) and fried onions ($6). The menu also includes family style platters, which offer a combination of ribs, wings and brisket with larger side sides servings.
The food came out in less than 30 minutes, steaming in red and white cardboard baskets. The wings were showstopping – smoked to perfection, crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside and easily falling off the bone. The portion was ideal for sharing, with plenty to split among my three friends.
A classic barbecue blend of spices with hints of garlic, onion, mustard, sugar, chili and paprika coated the wings on top of subtle notes of sweetness and smokiness. The wings are smoked and then fried to achieve the ideal level of crispiness. I dipped the wings in a side of creamy cilantro ranch, which was a herbaceous and savory contrast to the spicy and sweet profile of the wings.
The mac and cheese – dubbed “Mac & Jack Cheese,” an especially popular menu item – came with smoke rising from the noodles as they were served in a cardboard cup. The side dish was rich and creamy with jalapenos that cut through the mild cheese with just the right amount of zest, a spicy twist on a classic barbecue side.
The spiced fries were the standout of the night for me. Like the mac and cheese, they were an elevated, spicy twist to a classic dish. Coated in a spice blend that evoked the flavors of cayenne, chili and paprika, these aren’t fries you can get at any restaurant. The fried onions were a hit too, crispy and just the right amount of greasy. If you’re a fan of shoestring style onion rings, you must try them at DCity, dunked in your choice of the restaurant’s sauces, cilantro ranch, chipotle aioli or house barbecue.
The casual environment, vibrant ambiance and energetic playlist kept us chatting and snacking on wings for two hours. DCity Smokehouse should be your go-to spot for leisurely dining with friends, a lively atmosphere and great barbecue. Come for the wings, and stay for the good vibes.

In Wednesday's rendition of the moniker list, officials removed the Fog, Fogriders, Foghoppers, Cavalry, Firecrackers, the Buzz and the Independence from the list of monikers they presented to some focus groups last month.
Officials announced 10 moniker options to replace the nearly century-old Colonials moniker in a release Wednesday.
Officials released a list of moniker choices – Ambassadors, Blue Fog, Catalysts, Fireworks, Independents, Monumentals, Revolutionaries, Sentinels, Squad and Truth. Officials will gather feedback on the options through a random online survey, an online rating system and an “in-person activity” at an upcoming men’s basketball game against Atlantic 10 rival Virginia Commonwealth University March 4.
Ellen Moran, the vice president for communications and marketing, said in the release that input from the community will play a “critical and valuable role” in selecting the new moniker.
“We invite all students, faculty, staff and alumni to remain engaged in this process so the new moniker is representative of the collective feedback from the University community,” she said in the release.
The potential monikers come after students participated in private focus groups discussing 15 moniker options earlier this month. In Wednesday’s rendition of the moniker list, officials removed the Fog, Fogriders, Foghoppers, Cavalry, Firecrackers, the Buzz and the Independence from the list of monikers they presented to some focus groups. The new list adds the Catalysts, Squad and Truth.
The release states other “popular” options for the University’s new moniker, like the Patriots, Eagles and Capitals, were not considered for the final list of moniker options because other professional and academic organizations already use those names.
The release states officials will launch “Moniker Madness,” a series of activities to create opportunities for students, faculty and staff to continue giving feedback on the moniker options.
Officials will begin the first round of feedback collection in a “First Impressions” stage from Feb. 16 to March 6, offering opportunities for input like randomly sampling students for a 15-minute online survey, opening an online rating system for all GW community members and an event during the men’s basketball game March 4 where attendees will be able to voice their moniker preference.
The announcement comes after the University’s Board of Trustees voted to retire the Colonials’ moniker in June after years of student pressure due to its connections to colonialism, slavery and racial discrimination. Officials plan to select a moniker for the 2023-24 academic year.
In January, officials released a set of guiding principles for the new moniker’s selection, ruling out the possibility of any variation of the Hippos, GW’s unofficial mascot since at least 2001, as the University’s new moniker.
