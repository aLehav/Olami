Sam Doucheman is a superhero.
The junior majoring in international affairs balances a full-time course load and involvement in student organizations with an added level of responsibility that few students can even imagine – Doucheman is an intern on Capitol Hill.
Originally from a small town in Montana, Doucheman works part time for Sen. Max Caucus, R–Mont., a minority member of a subcommittee on agriculture.
Doucheman knew he wanted to work for the government from a young age, so he decided to take a chance in the fall by applying for the prestigious opportunity.
“I just feel so lucky to be working alongside this well-respected official at such a young age,” Doucheman said. “I’m still shocked that I was selected from the really, really large applicant pool for the one available position. Did I mention the applicant pool was really large?”
He first heard about the internship opportunity from his uncle, who works on Caucus’  staff.
Doucheman began working for Caucus in early January, after returning from a trip to Africa with a group of friends – which he added to his resume, claiming he spent his time building houses for low-income families.
After a tiring day of classes, Doucheman treks to Capitol Hill, where he works for an average of 75 minutes over a three-day workweek. The commute is made easier with the help of a generous gift from his parents – an Audi R8.
He was pleased to notice his new car featured on the popular blog “GWU Cars” last week.
As an intern, Doucheman is able to gain firsthand experience with the type of work he envisions himself handling on a professional level later in life.
“My job includes a number of important responsibilities that are crucial to carrying out the overall operations of the Senate. I’m essentially senator Caucus’ right-hand-man,” Doucheman said.
Doucheman usually begins his day by preparing the senator’s coffee. The senator is particular about his afternoon cup of joe, as he only drinks it with two packets of Sweet’N Low and milk from grass-fed cows.
Once this is finished, Doucheman generally spends the remainder of his time shredding paper and removing staples.
“It’s a lot of work, but I’ve never been one to back down from a challenge,” he said.
But the job doesn’t come without its perks.
As an intern at the senator’s office, Doucheman gets a 15 percent off discount on any pair of boat shoes at Brooks Brothers and JoS. A. Bank.
He said the discount has helped to expand his professional wardrobe, though he wishes it also included deals on Bermuda shorts and Vineyard Vines. The internship experience has also provided him with a new level of self-confidence he feels he couldn’t have gained anywhere else.
“Every once in a while I’ll look at some of my friends and just think to myself, ‘I remember when I was unaccomplished,’ ” Doucheman said.
Doucheman plans to continue his work for Caucus until the end of May, after which he plans to spend his summer break in Europe, drinking heavily as research for his senior thesis.

Starting next week, getting fucked will be as easy as pressing A4.
Sex toys will be sold in residence hall vending machines, the culmination of a yearlong bitchfest by the student organization Allied in Whine.
“This is a huge win for gay students, straight students and students who are just into some kinky shit,” Allied in Whine President Trey Hard said. “It’s convenient and progressive, and buying a 14-inch fake schlong without leaving The Dakota is why I came to GW.”
Leaders from Allied in Whine, who also successfully lobbied the University to sell condoms in vending machines two weeks ago, said it was evident that students had not been getting enough pleasure out of GW.
“And condoms, let’s face it, suck,” Hard said. “Everyone can admit it. Yes they’re important and healthy, but we all need a little something extra sometimes.”
Nestled between packets of Milano cookies and Kit Kat bars, students will be able to purchase a variety of pleasure-inducing instruments, ranging from vibrators to cock rings. Associate Dean Miller Lite said the $6.90-per-toy price was competitive with local vendors.
The Sigma Chi Association, the University’s student government, gave the green light to the project after also doing extensive research on the kinds of sex toys would best help students get off.
“Usually we just jack each other off the old fashion way in the SA. This was a nice change of pace,” SA President BJ Richardson said.
Richardson said he found butt plugs, nipple clamps and double-penetration dildos to be the most effective toys for stimulation.
“This is what students asked for. So we’re going to give it to them. Hard,” Dickerson said.
He added that while students have yet to jizz over miniscule fee cuts or an overhaul to unemployment services, this move would have them splooging through the rest of his presidency.
The University stopped short of funding every sex toy the SA and Allied in Whine requested.
“I’m sorry, but it would be an insult to George Washington himself to sell artificial vaginas on campus,” Miller Lite said.

UPD never responded because of malfunctioning radios.Every student is a suspect
The most naïve, stupid fucking student in the world left his backpack with $1,500 laptop, which he uses to type Word documents and browse StumbleUpon, unattended on a table near the door. He didn’t see who took his laptop, because he’s irresponsible, but daddy is writing a check to get an even snazzier laptop. UPD officers arrived on the scene late and were unable to nab the suspect because their radios were not functioning.No suspects or witnesses
A female student slapped her sorority grand-big after being accused of acting like a “slore.” A UPD officer arrived at the scene and determined that the student was, in fact, a slore. The slore then proceeded to throw a punch at the officer, who called for backup, but no officers responded because their radios were not functioning,Referred for disciplinary action
Officers responded to a rockin’ party after ‘Levels’ shook Thurston so hard residents thought there was another earthquake. Upon arrival, UPD officers found a keg and called next on the table.Call Me Maybe

Mike Longstowin loves winning.
After a standout career with the Mount A Cats, Longstowin was perplexed when the Colonials closed his first season with a disappointing record. The solution, the head coach decided, was to get his new team as close to the Vermoney mentality as possible.
“I like winning. That’s pretty much all I like, actually,” Longstowin said. “And you know, our guys…some of them just don’t know nature. They’ve never been taught nature. And as I showed at Vermoney, nature breeds winning.”
Longstowin took the Colonials to the Da Vurn for a retreat designed to get the team closer in tune with the mentality of the Vermoney players. Da Vurn was the most logical choice, he said, because like Vermoney, “it’s in the middle of nowhere.”
Handing out water bottles filled with maple syrup, which Longstowin said was “Vermoney Gatorade,” GW’s coach directed his players to their new rooms.
“Man, smell that? Smells good. Fresh air, nature – smells like victory,” Longstowin said.
The team unloaded their gear and tossed their bags in a Decrepit Hillside Dorm, except for freshman forward Jon Kropfield, whose duffel was lost on the trip and ended up in Australia.
First on the list of activities for the Colonials was a stop at the ropes course, where they cycled through five stations designed for team building. The program got off to a shaky start at the trust fall station, when senior guard Brony Taylormade could be heard refusing to catch junior forward Dunkin’ Phella, protesting, “He’s like, a foot taller than me!”
Things settled down at the next station, where the Colonials had to work together to put a hoop over the top of a tall pole. At first, GW seemed stumped on how to best execute its plan, but Taylormade managed to hand the hoop to Dunkin’, who simply turned around to place it over the top of the pole.
“That exercise was really important, it was good,” Longstowin said. “It all goes back to posting up. You win games in the low post. And you win team building exercises with a big presence under the net, or, you know, pole.”
Once the team-building exercises were done, the Colonials headed to the second part of their trip, an intense skills workshop designed to jump-start the team’s offensive play.
Leading GW to a grove of trees, Longstowin handed each of his players a ball. The objective, they were told, was to weave through all of the trees to the basket on the other side.
“It’s all about penetration,” Longstowin said. “If you can penetrate through trees, you can penetrate through anything.”
With Longstowin waving them on from the sidelines, the Colonials took off, making their way through the obstacle course.
Taylormade got to the end 10 minutes before the rest of GW, and spent the remaining time alternating between yelling encouragement and heading back into the course to help his teammates out.
“It went well, the guys looked good,” Taylormade said. “I mean, we had a few guys turn it over to the trees, but you’re moving fast, it happens. I thought everyone looked good.”
As the first day of the retreat wrapped up, Longstowin was busy trying to schedule a scrimmage between his team and the local Vurnies.
“Maybe we’ll get lucky and get in a brawl or something,” Longstowin said. “It worked for Gorgetown.”

The Office of Greek Liphe issued a mandatory stipulation Friday that all members of Greek Liphe must get RAMMED each semester.
This expert training will focus on the burning issues playing out through the day and night, both inside and out of Greek houses, and the dirty little secrets that unfold in the basements and concrete stairwells on Townhouse Row, in suitemates’ rooms or the shared townhouse bathroom are all fair game to be shared.
“Getting RAMMED is all about feeling good. It can be such a pleasing experience for everyone involved, and there are some very pressing issues this training can touch on,” Director of Liphe Christ Whatintheworldwereyouthinking said. “We hope everyone will leave feeling satisfied.”
Fraternities will learn how to handle the big issues just bursting to let loose. Sorority girls will be able to get so much off their chests, Whatintheworldwereyouthinking said.
“There are some things I regret that I want to discuss. You know, like every Thursday night since freshman year,” Phil Anthropy, a member of Pi America Alpha, said.
Many fraternity members report no problems with getting RAMMED,  but said they aren’t sure their sorority counterparts were as pleased with the experience.
Some are even able to get RAMMED in record setting times, finishing in less than two minutes. They are able to leave immediately after and get a full night of sleep in their own beds.
The Office of Liphe has offered to provide a juice from the jungle – a red liquid concocted in a bathtub – in hopes it will help the Greeks socialize before getting RAMMED together.
Some issues the fraternity brothers have brought up is that they are worried that, upon graduation, they won’t get RAMMED as much without their letters and townhouse.
Overall attitudes have been positive, with some even offering to do it again and again.
“Yeah, I’ve been RAMMED,” Biddie InaPinnie, a member of Alpha Pretty Pi, said.  “I don’t really mind. It’s like YOLO – you have to make the most of it.”
An Unloved Police Department officer volunteered to provide what the Office of Liphe called “necessary back-up” at the important training.
“I just like to watch,” officer Idon’treallydoanything said.
President Stealing a Nap decided getting RAMMED is such an important aspect of the college experience that he will set up a livestream for all students to watch on isanyoneupandreadytopostgame.com.
“I get such an eyeful of the Greeks in Thurston from my house when Ruffles and I Greek-watch out the window. I just feel like I’m a part of their world,” Nap said.
Although Nap hasn’t been RAMMED himself, he is looking forward to experiencing it someday.

Monica Lewinsky finished off Clinton and his Global Initiative Saturday, delivering the keynote address to an auditorium of awaiting students, much to the former president’s dismay.
Lewinsky gave a mouthful of advice, speaking about the importance of staying headstrong as a young professional and how it will lead to endless opportunities where you won’t have to spend your life behind – but possibly under – a desk.
“Suck life’s opportunities dry,” Lewinsky said. “You may not know when a great idea hits you in the face, but you have to be ready when it comes. It might get messy but that’s part of the fun.”
When Lewinsky took the stage in a rather unwashed-looking blue dress, Clinton was seen sweating off to the side of the stage, visibly angered at the idea that she was giving the speech that many members viewed as the climax of the three-day event.
“From the moment she opened her mouth, I was displeased,” Clinton said. “I did not have prior relations with that woman’s communications team, so I was upset that she was selected by the initiative to give the speech. I should be the only one climaxing around here.”
He had been saving a cigar for the moment the event ended, but while backstage, it appeared as though he only had the cigar tube in hand, devoid of any cigar – a further sign of his distaste with Lewinsky.
Secretary of State, Class, Amazingness and Poise Hillary Clinton was unable to attend the event, as she was doing diplomatic work in Bangkok, but she did provide a statement regarding Lewinsky’s speech.
“I had doubts that she would be able to handle the sheer size of the Clinton Global Initiative, but she proved me wrong,” Clinton said. “She was able to take it all in, using that to her advantage to provide a good message.”
Lewinsky said she was very satisfied with the crowd turnout, noting that her reputation hasn’t been the greatest since her scandal with the president in 1998, but she remained optimistic for her address, speaking on lessons from her past.
“Sometimes to get ahead in life, you just need to take your pride and swallow it,” she said.
Junior Ovurr Uhcheever, who applied to attend the conference only to appease his need to fawn over political speakers, did not have anything to say about his actual project, but said Lewinsky’s speech got a rise out of the crowd.
“She truly knew how to blow all the other speakers out of the water,” Uhcheever said. “Her oral skill was something that could not be missed in terms of drawing the attention of every member in the audience.”

Our Bar Belle will roam D.C. reviewing bars as she sees fit – even if she can’t see straight after visiting them.
Where: You fucking know where this is
Cover: No
Carded: Yes
Happy Hour: Yes, but only for hot biddies
Bar Bells:
I went to the best bar last night.
It included a whole night of $2 rail drinks and even the golden opportunity to dance on a bar. Or at least that is what my friends tell me I did, because I don’t remember shit from my night at McPhaddens.
Obviously, before even thinking about going, I made a Facebook group and invited everyone I know. I waited all week until Tuesday night, when the weekend finally came.
After first making it past the giant bouncer man, I stumbled downstairs. In preparation for this moment that only happens once a week, I pre-gamed heavily. It is a bad idea to show up sober to McPhaddens.
I immediately recognized everyone. I had even seen the skanks on the bar during the first week of my senior communication class. I call them skanks, because everyone knows if you dance on the bar before midnight, you’re just asking for negative attention.
My happy hour lasted only until 11 p.m., and we got there with just 30 precious minutes left, so I knew I had to make up for lost cheap alcohol time.
When I got to the bar, I ordered five drinks – all vodka cranberries, of course.
After hearing a mix of Jay-Z, Bon Jovi and Journey, I finished my drink and was starting to feel a little friendly.
As I looked up the stairs I saw that really cute guy who sits near me in my poli-sci discussion. We’ve never really talked, but I just felt like we had a real deep connection, and I wanted to make sure he knew what we could be. I marched right over to him.
“Hi,” I said.
“Hey,” he said, looking a little confused or drunk – I don’t really know.
“So we have discussion together, and you’re just like really smart and stuff,” I said and just gazed right into his eyes the whole time, trying to flip my hair really seductively. I think I got a little drink on it.
“Thanks,” he said, seemingly trying to keep moving.
Obviously, he was playing hard to get.
I went to lean in for the inevitable kiss, but he backed up. I think he was just startled we were moving so fast. One of those skanky girls dancing way too early on the bar must have spilled her stupid rum and diet Coke, because I fell. Hard.
I just started fist pumping on the ground to let everyone know I was okay. I think someone even clapped.
All of a sudden, I heard my song.
“All the single ladies, all the single ladies!”
Oh. My. God. Beyonce just has such a way with words.
I got some old man in a suit to boost me and my roommate up on to the bar.
I danced, like really well. I know because people started taking pictures with their phones.
After staying up there for that Jay-Z New York song, represent tri-state area – even though I am from New Jersey, I can practically see New York from my house – and singing to an Eddie Money jam, I slithered down.
That’s where my night goes black.
I know I had fun, because I woke up with an empty pizza box from Dominos and a text from a number I don’t know, along with some tulips. I mean, it’s McPhadden’s. If you remember it, why would you go back?

The Suck It Up And Play Committee released its findings Sunday, summing the result of its work in a simple mission statement: Just win more.
After a yearlong comprehensive review of GW athletics, its teams and facilities, the committee streamlined its findings into the one overarching desire for the Colonials to increase their number of victories.
It was a long and difficult process, Physical Activity Czar Trick Ne-yo said, but one that ultimately will prove beneficial for the future of athletics at the University.
“When you look at it, what we’re trying to do here is raise high a culture. And I want that raised high culture to be winning,” Ne-yo said. “Really, what we all agreed on was that we like raising high for wins better than losses.”
 The mission statement comes with tangible ways of measuring the Colonials’ progress toward more victories, Ne-yo added.
 The committee’s goal in creating the benchmarks, Ne-yo said, was to establish checkpoints so that it would be easy for teams to discern if they were winning more.
 “We just really have to raise high these benchmarks. And the first will be scoring more points than our opponents. That’s a good first step. The second is to see if our opponents are scoring fewer points than we are. Usually a sign of winning,” Ne-yo said. “And the last one, of course, will just be to look really good while we’re playing. A physically attractive squad is a winning squad.”
The committee’s review also includes measures to ensure the Colonials have the tools they need to put more tallies in the win column. Most important for GW’s teams, Ne-yo said, will be to follow his new W.I.N.S. guidelines: Working out In the New Smitty.
 If the teams follow his W.I.N.S. programs, they should be able to “grab the keys to victory,” Ne-yo said. He’ll back them up, he added, by joining the spirit program to boost morale.
 “We just need to jump higher. Our swim teams should try to swim faster than other people, and we can give them jetpacks for that. Baseball, softball, should catch more balls than their rivals. That new team, sailing, they probably shouldn’t tip over in the water,” Ne-yo said.
 If all else fails, Ne-yo said, the committee included a safeguard designed to help the teams win more. The Oh Horsehockey Student-Athletes Haven’t Increased Triumphs – or the O.H. S.H.I.T. – component of the review is a strategic contingency plan, he said.
 “I mean, we have to prepare for the worst,” Ne-yo said. “Which is why we wrapped it up with a strategic plan that’s sort of part two of this review. If all else fails, we’ll just cheat more.”
