Softball knocked in their 11-game streak after facing off non-conference rival Georgetown Wednesday afternoon.
The Colonials (17-10) edged eight runs against the Hoyas (11-14) adding another game to their undefeated streak with 11 straight wins and improving their home record to 4–0. GW jumped ahead of Georgetown in the bottom of the third inning off a triple from graduate student utility player Sierra Lange that led to four runs for the team.
“Our team is playing well, and our offense is rolling, we’re getting great performances from our pitching staff and defense,” Schoonmaker said. “I feel like we’re playing good, complete softball right now, so it’s great.”
On defense, Lange collected her 13th win of the season on the mound, lasting six innings and conceding five runs on six hits while striking out six batters. On offense, Junior Utility player Maggie Greco followed close with a two-run double at the bottom of the first inning and two hits.
“But on the mound, she’s elite,” Schoonmaker said. “Whe keeps us in every game. She’s competitive, she spins the ball really well. Yeah, I don’t know that I’ve coached a player that’s as competitive as Sierra Lange.”
The Hoyas started off strong with a pair of home runs at the top of the first inning from senior catcher Mae Forshey and graduate first baseman Abby Smith. Smith hit a two-run homer into left field for her second of the afternoon and seventh of the season.
The Colonials quickly responded with three runs in the bottom of the inning after Greco hit a two-run double pushing their advantage 7–2 with bases loaded.
GW scored again in the third inning off an RBI walk from freshman pinch hitter Taylor Puig and a three-run triple from Lange. Lange said she stepped it up on offense because she was grateful her teammates had her back despite having a performance in which she “could have done better.”
“I just feel like I had to do it on offense since I was not doing it on defense,” Lange said. “So to just give back to the girls that were on the bases and get them to score was the main goal there.”
But the Hoyas came back in the fifth inning with graduate student shortstop Savannah Jones hitting a single to left field to score a run.
“We knew they were going to come out swinging – they like to hit the ball. They live by the long ball, so we knew we were going to have out work cut out for us,” Schoonmaker said.
The Colonials scored their final run of the game in the sixth inning after graduate student outfielder Olivia Vinyard scored on a groundout to second base from graduate student right fielder Maddy Dwyer. The Colonials finished the afternoon with eight runs on 10 hits in 28 at bats.
Schoonmaker said the team focuses on playing one inning at a time allowing them to make comebacks against their opponents.
“We talk about playing the game one half-inning at a time – if you try to make the game bigger than it is, that’s when you can get in trouble,” she said. “But our team does a nice job of keeping the game a half-inning at a time and keeping us in the games.”
Dwyer came in to pitch the final inning and collect her first save of the season. The Hoyas scored two runs against her, but it was not enough to overcome the Colonial’s defensive performance.
Schoonmaker said the win over Georgetown was great because they are a “very good team” that live by the long ball, but GW’s pitchers showed they were up to the challenge with a great defensive performance.
“I thought we found a way to win and the mark of elite teams are when you can find a way to win,” she said. “I thought we did a good job of that today.”
The Colonials took a weeklong break before facing Hampton in a non-conference doubleheader April 1 at 1 p.m.

The School of Medicine and Health Sciences first developed the drug that the pharmaceutical companies are planning to sell, which would allegedly infringe on University-owned patents, according to the complaint.
Updated: April 1, 2022 at 5:10 p.m.
The University is suing three pharmaceutical companies in New Jersey federal court in an effort to stop the development, import and sale of a septic shock treatment drug that allegedly infringes on University-owned patents.
In a 59-page complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for New Jersey Tuesday, officials allege Indian pharmaceutical company Gland Pharma Limited, Chinese pharmaceutical company Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical and its American subsidiary Fosun Pharma USA are seeking permission to manufacture and sell a drug that is currently protected under GW’s patents. The University argues that the court should bar the companies from selling the drug while the patents are active and grant the University damages if the companies sell the drugs in the United States.
Officials said the companies should also cover the University’s attorney fees for the suit, according to the complaint.
“Unless Defendants are permanently enjoined by this Court, the acts of infringement set forth above will cause Plaintiffs irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law,” the lawsuit states.
The patents in question are for a drug known as Giapreza, which is used to treat adults with shock – dangerously low blood pressure, according to the European Medicines Agency. In 2019, the University sold a portion of its rights to the sales of the drug, which the School of Medicine and Health Sciences first developed.
La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company, which currently owns the rights to manufacture Giapreza, joined GW in the lawsuit as a plaintiff.
In a statement issued in February, La Jolla CFO Michael Jearne said the company received a notice from Gland Pharma Limited that month, indicating that it applied for Food and Drug Administration approval to sell “a generic version of GIAPREZA.”
Jearne said the notice from Gland Pharma Limited states that its drug sales would not infringe on the patents, which are “invalid, unenforceable.” He said the FDA cannot approve Gland’s application anytime earlier than seven and a half years after Giapreza’s initial FDA approval if the district court rules that the company infringed on the patents.
“The Company intends to vigorously defend its intellectual property rights protecting GIAPREZA,” Jearne said.
University spokesperson Crystal Nosal did not return a request for comment. Spokespersons for Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical, Fosun Pharma USA and Gland Pharma Limited did not immediately return requests for comment.

With allegations and rumors spreading about SA candidates on anonymous social media accounts through mid-week, candidates said the SA campaign had neared an ending with tensions running high.
The winners of this year’s Student Association elections will be announced Thursday evening, concluding a low-profile campaign season that ended with last-minute twists by the time polls closed Wednesday evening.
The Joint Elections Commission plans to announce the election results Thursday at 5 p.m., the maximum amount of time permitted by the JEC bylaws and a shift from past years when results were announced the night polls closed. The head of the JEC said the buffer would prevent mistakes, pointing to an error in preliminary results for a senate election last year, which was the first under new ranked-choice voting procedures.
An unusually low number of candidates has made the voting system less likely to be applicable this year. The campaign season had been low profile, with a record-low number of students participating in postering day and many student organizations not endorsing candidates until the day before the election.
Some student leaders had acknowledged the decrease in participation but rejected the premise that the change was negative at Sunday night’s debate.
But with allegations and rumors spreading about SA candidates on anonymous social media accounts through mid-week, candidates said the SA campaign had neared an ending with tensions running high.
Hours before the polls opened on Tuesday, last-minute candidate Andrew An launched a write-in campaign, saying he wanted to provide students with an alternative to the two candidates by avoiding the “scandals” and “drama” of the campaign.
SA presidential candidate Dasia Bandy released a statement on Instagram early Wednesday morning as students were casting their votes, apologizing for not addressing student concerns of sexual assault on campus but shutting down allegations of “falsehoods” against her character.
Student organizations have called on officials to call for Title IX reform, like participating in silent protests and hanging a clothesline project to signify students’ stories of sexual assault on campus.
Bandy pointed to the Instagram satire account, “gwheadlines,” which posted allegations of homophobia and racism against her. The allegations are attributed to anonymous messages submitted to the account, which appeared to be taken down as of Wednesday evening.
The owner of the account has not made their name public.
The account endorsed An, but he said on Wednesday that some members of the SA spread a “false rumor” that he was the account’s owner, which led to verbal and racially charged harassment from students. He said he’s communicating with officials about hate crimes that he has faced because of the rumors about him.
“I truly believe that I am being targeted for my race, and this rumor seems to be an outlet for that hate,” he said in a statement to The Hatchet.
Bandy denied the anonymous allegations against her in an interview Wednesday, saying they were a smear targeting her to bring down her campaign.
She said the posts pushed her to release the statement on Instagram, which she posted at about 4 a.m. Wednesday.
“It’s been very hard, but I try my best to not let it take over my entire experience because I do know that it is a bump in the road,” she said.
But Bandy did acknowledge the frustrations voiced by student activists campaigning against sexual assault in her statement.
Bandy said the four candidates running for president and vice president headed to Kogan Plaza Tuesday after a student had called on them to do so to discuss her concerns. Bandy said after the meeting, a student confronted the candidates about the lack of sexual assault issues on their platforms.
“I would like to apologize to any student who feels like they have been overlooked,” Bandy’s statement read. “Specifically, victims of assault.”
JEC Commissioner Trip Johnson said the group of candidates is “qualified” to lead the student government body.
“Criticisms have been made citing poor candidate turnout, and while the number of candidates running is lower this year compared to last, the quality of candidates did not decrease,” Johnson said. “We have seen first-hand, through campaigning and the debate, that these candidates are qualified to lead the next installment of the Student Association.”

Since the pandemic began two years ago, masking has become an integral part of my wardrobe. There is no doubt that masks began as a hindrance to the way I breathed and to the way I looked at other people. Soon after masks became the norm, they turned even closest friends and family members into strangers. Wearing a mask signified distance and wariness, even in the face of mutually understood precaution. But as masked gatherings became the norm either in one’s homes or in public places like the mall and restaurants, they soon became my acquaintances. I found myself using the small piece of fabric to complement the colors of the rest of my outfit or the color of my hair. They protected my sometimes tired-looking expressions, and oftentimes, they brought a distinct attention to the eyes.
Over the course of the pandemic, as I looked at my own masked reflection, in windows on the Metro, in store mirrors, on FaceTime with friends and over Zoom during my classes, I stared directly into my eyes. I appreciated their intensity, and I was prompted to do the same when I looked at my peers. Masks refocused my attention to concentrate on the shape of my face, my hair and how one complements the other.  As an insecure person who’s particularly touchy about my looks, masks began simply as a way to cover my face but ended up becoming a tool to refocus my concentration on making eye contact with myself and others. 
Before the pandemic, my eyes used to travel to my nose, to my mouth, my cheeks. When I looked in the mirror, I analyzed every inch, usually trying to rearrange it in a way to make it better. But every day since I’ve worn a mask, my focus has been on my eyes. Without the distraction of thinking about the rest of my face, I feel more self-assured, less critical and more at peace with myself. Even as I become more comfortable taking my mask off in public, I’m glad that my brain got used to the idea of my eyes and my eyebrows. Once I became confident in those two significant features, the confidence about the rest of my face followed. Instead of nitpicking specific features of my face, I now see that the rest of my features are only in service to my frame, my eyes and my eyebrows. 
For someone with little interest in fashion and a crippling insecurity when it comes to wearing new kinds of clothes, masks also became a fun way to personalize an article of clothing that everybody was wearing. Previously, I had struggled to match my sense of style with that of current trends because I was afraid that I would be ridiculed or that I didn’t look good enough to try new clothes on. But with masks, I could easily participate in choosing which cuts I liked and which material I was most comfortable with. Not only did masks help with my self-perception, they also allowed me to go outside of my usually indifferent attitude toward pants or tops. 
Seeing celebrities wear masks that I could afford was a fun way to connect to the fashion zeitgeist. Celebrities began using them to complement the rest of their wardrobe like Harry Styles at last years’ Grammys or Zendaya at last year’s Academy Awards. Fashion designers also embraced masks as a welcome addition to the red carpet. Whether they matched or complemented the patterns of the rest of their outfits, these masks were heightened versions of the ones us plebs wear every day to school or work. Seeing these celebrities matching their mask to their appearance prompted me to look at what type of mask I wanted to wear, whether it was a KN95, a black surgical mask or cloth masks of different colors and shapes, and see which one might frame my face the best. Once I saw Timothée Chalamet wear a blue KN95 to match his blue suit at the Paris Dune premiere last year, I knew I wanted to get a black version to match the color of my hair. When I did, I felt more connected with fashion trends and closer to one of my favorite actors. Instead of battling my inner fashion demons to buy a new pair of pants, all I had to do was get a new mask and choose a color I liked.
Masks are not only a necessity to protect against COVID-19, but they have also become a significant article of clothing for me. By forcing me to reckon with just my eyes, and not the entirety of my face, they have eased me into feeling confident about my entire face. They didn’t ask me to become confident overnight, like so many people without such insecurities do, but instead slowly reintroduced me to myself by asking me to just make eye contact.

District residents will weigh in at an April 25 D.C. Zoning Commission hearing that could determine whether the public will lose access to District House’s basement dining options as part of a planned overhaul of the University’s open dining plan. The Commission reviews proposed changes to how District residents want to use their property and its approval would allow GW to rezone, or reallocate, the building’s retail space to an all-you-care-to-eat dining hall restricted to the GW community. While the change may strengthen the University’s community, banning members of the public from its property threatens its relationship with Foggy Bottom at large.
Concerns over food insecurity, a serious problem at GW, and student safety underline the University’s rationale. While these new dining halls may address food insecurity, there’s no guarantee they’ll make students safer. Student and staff safety is a serious concern, but such boilerplate language portrays Foggy Bottom and its residents as inherently dangerous. “Protecting” students and their neighbors from one another through an unenforceable ban on the public’s access compromises the University’s commitment to a unique urban campus and damages its relationship with the community. GW’s privately-owned, quasi-public spaces ought to accommodate both students and their neighbors.
District House is a public space, albeit one that’s privately owned. Its subterranean selection of counter-service restaurants offers burritos, salads, sushi and more to locals and students alike.
While the Zoning Commission isn’t reviewing the renovation itself, replacing the requirement for public retail space with restricted University “food service” is a prerequisite for District House’s new University-only dining hall.
University officials like Karen Zinn, the associate vice president of real estate, and Kevin Days, the director of community relations, have said the University will maintain its community presence while adding new dining halls exclusively for the GW community.
At a January 2022 Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission meeting, Days said the University “is not interested in reducing public facilities for the community” as it transforms and reallocates its own property. But turning District House’s basement into a student-only dining hall means losing a public facility.
Closing these restaurants may not matter to Foggy Bottom’s wealthier residents, but students at the School Without Walls High School, which lacks a traditional cafeteria, will lose access to more affordable dining options.
The University has also argued that these limited-access dining halls “will provide a buffer that offers students enhanced campus safety.” Students and staff, especially those who are women and nonbinary, are right to be concerned about their safety around and off-campus.
But barring the public’s entry addresses a largely nonexistent or otherwise wholly unreported problem –  threats to student safety aren’t occurring in dining halls, and further, members of the public largely aren’t responsible for on-campus crimes. A review of the University’s crime logs reveals that sexual assaults, stalking and other more serious crimes overwhelmingly happen in students’ residence halls – not public spaces like District House’s basement. Assigning GW Police Department officers or private security to shoo away passersby leaves students vulnerable to far more serious crimes than trespassing.
The University must resort to this constant enforcement if it’s serious about limiting the public’s access. Instituting a swipe-only system like at The Eatery at Pelham Commons would eliminate the public’s ability to dine at District House altogether but won’t stop them from accessing the building. GW’s sophisticated tap access system is unenforceable – you can foil it just by walking behind someone, typically a courteous student holding the door open.
“Student safety” doesn’t need to be and quite frankly isn’t the underlying reason behind the University’s new dining hall push – food insecurity is serious enough. But that University officials would invoke this phrase at all is telling in its own right. If the very presence of non-GW affiliated people on University property threatens its “protected community space,” where, exactly, can locals and residents go? Under the guise of “student safety,” the University could theoretically file for more zoning changes to bar the public from its privately-owned but quasi-public property.
While the University may not intend to criminalize members of the public for entering its property, how and whether it enforces its property rights could easily spiral out of control. Rather than promoting community spaces within and without GW, the new dining halls could engender mutual mistrust between University officials and Foggy Bottom.
Officials have said that “locating a university campus in the heart of a city presents a number of challenges and requires a thoughtful balance of student and city interests.” I agree, which is why it’s a shame that its action seems so thoughtless. The University can renovate a dining hall without invoking “student safety” and the consequences it invites, and it can safely open those dining halls to all residents of Foggy Bottom whether they are students or locals.
Even with the potential for cheaper, fresher food, these new yet traditional dining halls are dangerously conventional – GW’s open, urban campus is one of its greatest features and allows it to navigate tensions with nearby residents. Adopting the model of a gated community is a disservice to the University, its members and the surrounding community. There’s no harm in rubbing shoulders with your neighbors, even if it’s just in line for lunch.

The owners immigrated from Ukraine but still have family members remaining in the country.
To enhance your cherry blossom season in the District, grab a cherry blossom-inspired dish from D Light Cafe, a Ukrainian-owned business helping to raise funds in support of their family and fellow Ukrainians caught in the conflict.
Don’t be surprised if you find a roughly 30-minute line when you arrive at the cafe, located at 2475 18th St. NW. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last month, D.C. residents have rallied support for the Ukrainian sisters who own the cafe, some donating their time to help staff the busy cafe, others by frequently purchasing goods from the shop.
While waiting in line, you can’t miss the arch of colorful hydrangeas, phenones and eucalyptus flowers that adorn the doorway. But the decor doesn’t end there – upon entering the relatively small space you’ll see Ukrainian-inspired blue, yellow and white flower arrangements on every table, swinging gold chandeliers and large mirrors and paintings hanging on the walls.
The cafe is especially fresh and new, only just reopening in February after an arsonist lit the cafe’s arch of flowers on fire, causing a devastating fire and scorching the exterior of the cafe in January. The owners, Anastasiia and Vira Derun, had to rely on GoFundMe, which raised more than $14,000 for the repairs.
Only two weeks after they reopened, more devastation struck with the Russian invasion. The Deruns immigrated from Ukraine and still have family there, which inspired them to launch fundraising efforts at the cafe to raise money for medical supplies and assistance in evacuation.
The sisters’ parents chose to stay in Ukraine, with their father providing neighbors with hunting equipment to take up arms against the Russian forces. They baked cookies decorated with the Ukrainian flag and held a trivia night the first week of March, with a minimum participation fee of $10 going to Ukrainian aid organization Razom, which is working to help evacuate children and provide the wounded with medical attention.
Once you make it through the line to the front of the shop, a glass case filled with French and Ukrainian pastries entices your appetite. Guests can order dine in or to go with indoor dining and curbside seating, perfect for the spring weather. Tables line the sides of the cafe inside, with two bay window-like seats by each window. Outside, two big communal tables are shared by guests.
If you are won over by the allure of baked goods, I recommend trying the D Light Signature Cake ($6.99), a light and fluffy cake broken up with layers of custard cream and caramel and finished with sliced almonds on top. For a savory bite, you can’t go wrong with a turkey croissant sandwich ($12.99) or the cafe’s popular tomato Shakshuka ($13.99), a baked egg dish covered in a spicy tomato sauce.
Spring in the District calls for all things cherry-blossom themed, so consider opting for the cherry-popcorn raf ($3.85), a popular Eastern European coffee drink, for your drink of choice. I decided to fully commit to the festive spring theme and indulge in the cafe’s cherry blossom pancakes ($13.99), served with cherry jam.
I ate the flapjacks outside in the sun at one of the several large, community tables, conversing with friendly customers eager to support the Ukrainian cause. Shortly after I began eating, an Eastern European band began playing next to the seating area. They also provided a QR code for passerbyrs to donate to Razom.
The three, medium-sized pancakes come covered in a light, airy cream mousse that is the just the right amount of sweet to not overpower the cakes. The dollop of cherry jam served on top of the fluffy treats captured the essence of cherry blossoms. The dish tasted like what I picture spring to taste like – light, fruity and subtly sweet.
If you visit on the weekend, be sure to arrive before noon, as the shop has gained so much popularity that they often run out of food before closing time.
D Light Cafe is well worth the wait, so be sure to head on over to indulge in the French and Ukrainian fusion and support a good cause.

Lazo helped GW's squad in its strong A-10 tournament run that saw the team take down No. 13 Saint Bonaventure and No. 5 La Salle. 
Mississippi State has hired former women’s basketball assistant coach Gabe Lazo as an assistant coach for their women’s team, Bulldogs head coach Sam Purcell announced Friday.
Lazo spent the last season as an assistant coach to Colonials head coach Caroline McCombs. Despite an 11-17 regular season record and a 4-11 conference record, Lazo helped GW to a strong Atlantic-10 tournament run in which they took down No. 13 St. Bonaventure and No. 5 La Salle in the program’s first year rebuilding after the exit of former head coach Jennifer Rizzotti.
“Gabe Lazo is a great addition to my staff here at Mississippi State and the community of Starkville,” Purcell said in the press release. “As I finish up helping guide Louisville to the Final Four, it’s important that I have the right people in place in Starkville so that we can get to work recruiting the best talent in the country, and Coach Lazo fits that mold perfectly.”
Purcell said in the announcement that Lazo’s connections to talented athletes across the board will help him recruit players for Mississippi State.
“He has developed players at every level of basketball and has built key relationships with people all around the world,” Purcell said. “Those relationships that he has built at the AAU and high school levels and those at the college level will allow us to recruit the best student-athletes to Mississippi State.”
Prior to his brief stint at GW, Lazo worked for two seasons as an assistant coach at Stony Brook, aiding the then McComb-led Seawolves to an America East regular season title in 2020, a conference title and an NCAA Tournament appearance in 2021, the release states.
“I am extremely excited and grateful for the opportunity to join Coach Purcell and be a part of the Mississippi State family,” Lazo said in the release. “Mississippi State is a special place with the expectation to compete at a high level and win championships in the best conference in the country. I can’t wait to get to Starkville and get to work.”
Before his spell at Stony Brook, Lazo served as an assistant with the women’s basketball program at Florida International for two seasons, the release states. In his first year, Lazo assisted the Panthers to their best record in four seasons and the most Conference USA wins in program history, according to the release.
Lazo also played at the college level with the Panthers for two seasons beginning in 2004, followed by two seasons at Barry. Lazo then went on to compete professionally for two years with Cariduros de Fajardo BSN in Puerto Rico, the release states.
“I have heard nothing but amazing things about the community and their love for women’s basketball and that’s something I am really looking forward to being a part of,” Lazo said. “My commitment to the program, the student-athletes and the community will be felt in everything that I do. I pride myself on building the best relationships and getting the best out of our players.”

SA Sen. Philippa Balshaw, CCAS-G, spoke at Monday's meeting in favor of the Graduate Housing (Goes International) Act, which she co-sponsored. 
The Student Association Senate voted to urge officials to provide graduate-only housing to students during a meeting Monday.
Senators unanimously passed the legislation, calling on officials to provide all graduate students with “permanent and secure” residence halls and requests increased housing options, support networks and mediation resources for graduates, especially those who are international students, trying to secure off-campus housing. Senators also approved $100,000 in unused student organization funding, which the SA will reallocate to student organizations as co-sponsorships for durable goods, which include long-term licenses and sports equipment for students organizations to spend in the remainder of the fiscal year.
SA Sen. Philippa Balshaw, CCAS-G, who co-sponsored the resolution, said although graduate students make up 56 percent of GW’s student population, they are not offered the same housing opportunities as undergraduate students, who are guaranteed campus housing.
The resolution aims to expand graduate housing options on campus for international students, who she said often struggle to find someone to cosign on their rental leases while looking for off campus housing without any available residence hall options. She said international students may need to submit full payment upfront, unlike their peers at GW, who face less stringent domestic cosigning requirements.
The resolution recommends that when the Aston re-opens, the building should be designated as graduate-only housing. The Aston, which used to be a graduate student apartment complex, was converted to house third and fourth year students as Thurston Hall was approved to undergo renovations in 2019.
“International students can’t afford this opportunity,” she said. “We not only deserve graduate student housing in the Aston but also deserve more opportunities to suit individual needs and accommodate the number of graduates.”
SA Sen. Cody Ingraham, Law-G, who co-sponsored the resolution, said the Aston currently contains 120 double units designated for undergraduate students. He said even when the Aston was used for graduate housing, this number of graduate housing units was “far less” than the number of options at GW’s peer schools.
The senate also unanimously passed the Year-End Capital Investment Act, which uses previously distributed student organizations’ “unspent funds” from the SA to reallocate to student organizations for durable goods like sports equipment that will last a year or more. SA Sen. Yan Xu, ESIA-U, who sponsored the bill, said funding for this bill came from the SA reclamation process, where the SA takes any surplus funds that student organizations requested in their fall semester budgets but did not spend during the academic year.
“Fall semester, there were leftover funds that student organizations have to use and based on every previous year’s data, the University can reasonably authorize that this will be still left over,” Xu said.
Earlier this month, the SA designated about $200,000 for the University-wide Events Fund next year that will go toward events with an expected attendance of at least 350 students and heritage celebration programs, like Black Heritage Celebration and South Asian Society events. The events fund is separate from the general allocations fund, according to the Code of Financial Policies, an update and expansion of current SA finance bylaws, earlier this month.
The senate also unanimously passed the Code of Academic Integrity Revisions, which revises the definition of academic integrity, clarifying how University sanctions can differ based on whether students intended to violate GW policy. Christy Anthony, director of the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities, said the definitions are written with the intention of teaching students what constitutes as plagiarism.
“We see it as an obligation of the University and of faculty to really teach what we mean when we talk about plagiarism or other forms of academic integrity violations,” she said.
The next senate meeting will be held April 11 at 8:30 p.m. in the University Student Center’s Continental Ballroom.

Some of the searches would fill positions that have been vacant for months. 
Updated: March 31, 2022 at 5:04 p.m.
Officials are looking to fill at least 10 administrative positions this year, including senior roles in GW’s provost and development offices, according to a series of online job postings.
Interim leaders currently hold at least nine key positions at GW in offices ranging from the University president to chief technology officer, and officials have said a smaller hiring pool during the pandemic has accounted for some of the temporary staff selections. Officials are looking to hire staff for permanent administrative positions like the vice provost for faculty affairs, the vice president of communications and marketing and the vice president and general counsel.
Some of the positions have gone nearly six months without being filled. Experts in higher education administration have said shifts in employees’ priorities after the COVID-19 pandemic – like demands for more working hour flexibility – have made it increasingly difficult for universities to hire more staff and administrators.
Provost Chris Bracey, who previously served as the vice provost for faculty affairs for about 5 years before moving to the interim provost position last June when former Provost Brian Blake left GW to become the president of Georgia State University. Interim University President Mark Wrighton promoted Bracey to the permanent provost role in February.
Stacy DiLorenzo, the interim vice president of communications and marketing, has held her position since November after Sarah Baldassaro, the previous interim, left GW to become chief of staff at American University last summer.
Baldassaro filled the vice president position after Heather Swain, the initial pick for the permanent role, withdrew herself from consideration from the position. Former University President Thomas LeBlanc faced widespread criticism over his decision to hire Swain, who was connected to a sexual assault case while working at Michigan State University.
Officials are also searching for a permanent vice president and general counsel after Beth Nolan, who previously held the position, departed GW after nearly 14 years on the job. Deputy counsel Charles Barber has temporarily filled the position in the interim capacity since last June.
GW has retained company executive search firm, Spencer Stuart, and legal search firm, Major, Lindsay and Africa, to help recruit the communications and marketing and general counsel positions but has not sought assistance for any of the other senior management positions, according to GW’s job listing website.
Officials are also searching for an associate provost of undergraduate affairs and special programs, a vice provost of graduate and postdoctoral affairs and an associate vice provost of career services after Rachel Brown, who previously held the career services position, left GW in October.
The Division of Development and Alumni Relations is also searching for two assistant vice presidents to focus on fundraising in the School of Business and the School of Medicine and Health Sciences.
This post was updated to correct the following:
The Hatchet incorrectly reported that DiLorenzo succeeded Heather Swain in the interim role. DiLorenzo became the interim vice president of communications and marketing after Sarah Baldassaro left to serve as chief of staff at American University. The University tapped Baldassaro last summer to replace Swain. We regret this error.
