Several posters appeared in District House last week denouncing the Chinese government’s actions including its handling of the pandemic and its human rights abuses against the Uyghur people.
Interim University President Mark Wrighton is walking back comments he made last week condemning posters that appeared on campus criticizing the Chinese government, saying they are “political statements” and not examples of racism.
Several posters appeared in District House last week denouncing the Chinese government’s actions including its handling of the pandemic and its human rights abuses against the Uyghur people. Wrighton originally said officials would be taking down the posters but is now changing course, saying GW is not investigating the posters and emphasizing his support for freedom of speech.
Wrighton said in a statement Monday that the University’s responses to remove the posters were “mistakes.” He initially expressed “concern” about the posters in an email to a student who raised the issue with Wrighton and said the University would investigate the incident, which sparked criticism from the artist who created the posters and national academic freedom organizations.
“Upon full understanding, I do not view these posters as racist; they are political statements,” Wrighton said in the statement. “There is no University investigation underway, and the University will not take any action against the students who displayed the posters.”
Wrighton said he learned that the Chinese-Australian artist, Badiucao, designed the posters to protest against the Chinese Communist Party. He said he supports all students and faculty at GW who are researching and advocating against “all forms of discrimination, marginalization and oppression.
“I want to be very clear: I support freedom of speech – even when it offends people – and creative art is a valued way to communicate on important societal issues,” Wrighton said in the statement.
The GW Chinese Cultural Association called on officials to investigate the posters in a statement Sunday and asked for a public response from GW. The CCA specifically criticized one poster that they described as the “most outrageous,” showing a Chinese curler pushing a coronavirus molecule forward, an illustration they said could be linked to the increase of hate crimes against Asian Americans during the pandemic.
“We reiterate that we believe in the freedom of expression of individuals and groups on the George Washington University campus,” the statement reads. “However, we do not regard misleading and offensive propaganda as within that scope. We oppose the politicization and suppression of our demands for equality and inclusion.”

Students have high expectations for the newly launched U-Pass program, which provides unlimited Metro rides to students for a semesterly fee of $100. The program provides affordable transportation to those who commute to campus, travel to internships outside of Foggy Bottom or use Metro frequently to explore the city.
But not all students fit into those categories. For many undergraduates who find themselves swamped in classwork and student organization commitments, there is no reason to leave the campus. The program’s mandatory feature for undergraduates and inflexibility are unsympathetic to on-campus students who do not wish to be enrolled in the program. The University should accommodate an opt-out option or cost-adjustable rates for undergraduate students to alleviate the financial stress the program causes students.
GW’s enrollment in U-Pass is the result of years-long student advocacy and the University’s joint effort. When Metro delays persisted through weeks and months, thousands of off-campus students agonized commuting into and out of campus. Although U-Pass is not going to fix Metro cars that have gone off the rails, it certainly will take a load off commuter students’ shoulders with unlimited Metro rides for $100 per semester. But on-campus students who don’t have a reason to leave Foggy Bottom frequently and who cannot afford to pay $100 for transportation are overlooked in the implementation of the program. GW should consider adding an opt-out option for undergraduate students.
A $100 fee per semester might be a good deal for daily Metro users, but it can be burdensome to non-Metro users. For those who didn’t ask for U-Pass, paying the additional cost to already expensive GW tuition is beyond frustrating. Undergraduate tuition has reached almost $60,000, starting with the Class of 2024, and the total cost of attendance has increased by nearly 3.4 percent since fall 2020. Above all, the pandemic is driving many students into financial challenges to the extent that some are barely making the cuts to access housing and food.
While the program is intended to aid students with affordable transportation, the reality for non-Metro users is that this will cost them more money. To be sympathetic about this situation, GW and WMATA should consider implementing additional options that are mutually beneficial to them and narrowly tailored to students’ circumstances.
Some students have already expressed their wish to opt out of this program, and despite SA leaders’ push for an opt-out option, WMATA spokesman Ron Holzer said it is “not under consideration.” This brings many questions to the logistics of this program. Every student’s $100 is equally valuable and varies in its intended usage, but this requirement asks for the sacrifice of non-Metro users for the sake of Metro users. Just like how students are enjoying the fruits of their labor after so many years of persistent student advocacy, loud and persevering student voices can make an opt-out option possible.
Price accommodations can be another plausible solution. Some students travel outside of Foggy Bottom very infrequently, sometimes once or twice a month. For travels that would cost within a range of $5 to $10 normally, paying $100 is more expensive to non-Metro users. A tier system with different price options to choose from, similar to GW’s system for dining plan rates, could fulfill students’ specific demands. Metro fare could be applied depending on the student’s frequency so that students can choose their preferred Metro rate. For those students who do not want to be enrolled in the mandatory U-Pass program, accommodations like this will provide the necessary travel costs.
There is no doubt that U-Pass is a great program for the vast majority of its beneficiaries. It’s also an achievement of years-long persistence from the student leaders. But there are improvements to be made and room for conversation. Both graduates and undergraduates should be able to opt out of the program, and the University can propose alternative options like a cost-adjustable tier system to further offset costs. As the mandatory feature has been on the talk since the proposal of this program, it should be more thoroughly reviewed now that actual money is coming out of students’ pockets. The University should consider accommodating solutions for those who want to opt out of the program.

Presumably, being a professor is hard. But avoiding the use of racial slurs when teaching should not be hard.
Yet GWTeach Professor Alicia Bitler used the N-word when teaching a course about anti-racism in STEM – and then had the audacity to dismiss it as an “oops moment.” It takes an absurd and depressing parade of failures at the institutional and individual level for this to happen. But racist incidents keep happening at GW – and the University as an institution needs to make it plain that they understand the systemic problem and be clear and communicative about what they’re going to do about it.
The editorial board is not going to attempt to speak on behalf of the Black community at GW – but we can and will amplify and emphasize the fact that racist incidents keep happening at GW, and there’s been a lack of decisive action about it.
This fits in with a broader trend of Black students repeatedly having to endure racism and indignity at GW. In 2019, the head of a popular sorority posted a Snapchat from a plantation musing about whether the historic site “sells slaves.” In early 2020, then-University President Thomas LeBlanc made a comment comparing theoretical support for fossil fuel divestment to “shooting all the Black people” at GW. Later that same year, former history professor Jessica Krug, who is white, confessed to pretending to be Black for her entire career as a professor. Until just months ago, the central nervous system of campus community and activism was housed in a building named after segregationist Cloyd Heck Marvin. About two weeks ago, a professor refused to allow a Black student to have an approved service animal in class.
This is not an exhaustive list of the prominent racist incidents that have plagued GW’s campus – which only further evidences the fact that there’s a systemic and constant problem. And that doesn’t even include the comments and microaggressions that are downstream of the same institutional culture that lets these racist incidents keep happening.
The University’s response to Bitler’s use of the N-word was boilerplate and slow. Students of the class who wrote a letter to administrators demanding accountability were met with responses that could have been copy-and-pasted from any previous statement on racism. Interim University President Mark Wrighton invoked GW’s “stated commitment to diversity and inclusion” while Graduate School of Education and Human Development Dean Michael Feuer offered a trite promise to “do better.”
The University, like most predominantly white institutions, has repeatedly leaned on the term “diversity and inclusion,” using it as a buzzword instead of implementing long-lasting, actionable solutions. Incidents that concern professors and the subject material they teach, like the irony of a professor teaching a course on anti-racism saying the N-word, or professors faking a certain identity to claim subject material they have no real relation to, need to be examined from a pedagogical point of view. The University needs to hire a point person, or multiple point people, to evaluate the courses that are being offered each semester, the person who is teaching them and whether that professor is fit to teach certain courses.
We propose that the University initiate a dialogue to acknowledge that certain courses require lived experience to provide students with the nuance of that particular topic. Hiring someone to have that dialogue with professors will do just that.
The issue that causes these incidents over and over again lies in a lack of understanding of the relationship between professors, students and the subject material. The University’s efforts to add more faculty of color to individual departments through cluster hiring solves the University’s public relation issues and also does important work to add new perspectives that people of color and women of color bring to academia. But what is lacking in the University’s response to these incidents is their acknowledgement of the delicacy of course material of any kind, and how a quality liberal arts education is often made by the people who teach it.
The administration also needs to acknowledge its own limitations instead of providing staple responses that reinforce their “commitment” to diversity at GW. They should instead be open and acknowledge the complexities of the situation and describe the actions that they are planning to take and the actions they are either struggling with or are soliciting advice for. When it comes to issues like this one, students of color are the first to be harmed, and the University should solicit their perspective and input on potential solutions.
Racist incidents keep happening and happening at GW. Administrators obviously cannot solve systemic racism with a policy or statement, but that does not mean that they should not do every single thing they possibly can to make campus safe for Black students’ education and well-being.
Officials need to act. They need to communicate. And if they can’t get results, they need to, at the bare minimum, level with students and candidly acknowledge that there’s a problem in a way that goes beyond buzzwords.

This year's theme, “Homecoming: Been Black,” represents the resilience of the Black community.
The Black Alumni Association kicked off the Black Heritage Celebration Friday, commemorating GW’s 17-year history of BHC events and featuring an address from interim University President Mark Wrighton.
Black alumni at the event said the unity they found with other multicultural communities on campus has lasted beyond graduation and into their careers, and they encouraged Black alumni to continue to stand together into their adult lives. About 45 people attended the event, where Wrighton commended the University’s “palpable” commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion and the support from alumni aiming to advance these efforts.
The kickoff marks the second event of this year’s BHC, which is headlined by the theme, “Homecoming: Been Black,” to represent the resilience of the Black community.
Through pre-recorded videos and live statements, Black alumni reflected on their time at GW and their roles as campus leaders.
Sam P.K. Collins, a journalist who graduated from GW in 2014, reflected on his time as a leader in the Black community while he was editor of The Black Ace Magazine, a publication of the Black Student Union. Collins said after uniting with one another and earning their degrees from GW, Black alumni have become self-sufficient entering their professional careers instead of living as a “beggar class” facing the effects of racial inequity.
“I’m very proud to have been at GW because GW laid the foundation for my African consciousness, so to speak,” Collins said. “It was in that environment where I learned who I was and who I’m not.”
Nikki Lane, an alumna and former BHC committee member, said she was excited to reconnect with other alumni, some of whom she mentored as a Multicultural Student Services Center employee after graduating from the University.
“This is a joyous thing for me to see the Black Heritage Celebration thrive all these years later and to see my Black Alumni Association active and getting us all involved,” Lane said.
Wrighton emphasized the gravity of Black History Month and the BHC during his address, which will continue strengthening diversity, equity and inclusion at GW.
“I’m confident that this emphasis on diversity, equity and inclusion will serve us well,” Wrighton said at the event. “This is what we need to be able to attract the most talented students, the most outstanding faculty members and a great staff. I’ve already encountered strength in this community through the many people that I’ve had the opportunity to interact with, and everyone that I’ve interacted with shares this commitment to strengthen our community.”
Wrighton referenced two “deeply troubling” events that have recently taken place on campus and stressed that GW must improve beyond school policies and programs to enhance diversity, equity and inclusion. He said officials are currently working on a diversity review, which will implement a “diversity action plan” to track progress in implementing diversity on campus and the broader D.C. area.
Thousands signed a petition last week calling for officials to fire a professor who a student said incorrectly claimed she couldn’t have a service dog in class. Two weeks earlier, a GWTeach professor who said the N-word in a Jan. 18 class stepped down from her responsibilities teaching the course.
“I know that many George Washington University alumni, students, faculty and staff are working hard to make our environment more diverse and more inclusive,” Wrighton said. “I’m extremely proud to be leading a University who has this commitment, and I am confident that we will continue to make progress overcoming racism and building a more inclusive community.”
Natasha Dupee, the chair of the association, and Andrew Dixon, a member of the association’s executive board, encouraged students to apply for the GWBAA IMPACT Award, which honors students and alumni for their commitment to GW and achievements in fields like community service, research and entrepreneurship. Dixon said three alumni, one undergraduate student and one graduate student receive the award each year.
“This is an award that is always a great night to see really the excellence that GW has produced through our Black students and our Black graduates and our Black alumni,” he said.

Student donations are evenly divided between The Store and the Abrahms Family Fund.
The University’s partnership with a nationwide program to aid students struggling with food insecurity has raised more than $9,000 since its founding in 2020.
GW teamed up with Swipe Out Hunger in November 2020, allowing students, staff and faculty to donate the remainder of their GWorld balances to other students through The Store and the Abrahms Family Fund, which provides emergency Colonial Cash to students. The fundraising total marks a $6,000 jump in donations in less than a year since about 150 students helped raise $3,000 through the program last March.
University spokesperson Crystal Nosal said community members participating in the cause can donate their funds using the GET app, and the money is split evenly between the Abrahms Family Fund and The Store, which was operational through the previous academic year. She said the funds donated through the Swipe Out Hunger program have helped The Store purchase produce, meats, gluten-free, vegetarian food and dairy products. 
Nosal said the University will update the program during the next academic year so students can donate meal swipes each semester.
“We highly encourage any students who have remaining balances at the end of the semester to consider making a donation,” Nosal said in an email.
Sua Cho Jung, a junior majoring in international affairs and Spanish and the president of The Store, said the number of students who use The Store typically increases as students start to run low on dining funds as the semester wears on. She said The Store does its best to stay stocked year-round for students, but supply chain shortages have caused some stocking issues during the pandemic.
“It’s always a nice circle of students giving back to students in a way, and I think that’s one of the most important aspects of it,” she said. “And that’s what makes it so special.”
She said the program is necessary because of the divide between students who struggle to afford food and those who don’t typically grapple with food insecurity. She said even a small amount of money that students can donate will raise funding for The Store and aid those students who are in need of direct funds.
“I feel like on campus we see a lot of both people that tend to have more GWorld money leftover, and then we tend to have another group that finds it a little more difficult to get by and to have enough funds to get by during the semesters,” she said. “So I think personally, it’s such a great program and idea that we have implemented in our school and our operations.”

A total of four institutions enrolled 56 HIV-negative adult participants in the vaccines’ clinical trials, according to a release.
GW was one of the first institutions in the country to administer doses of the first mRNA HIV vaccines to human test subjects late last month.
The School of Medicine and Health Sciences and its Vaccine Research Unit collaborated with Moderna to test the safety of the vaccine and the immune responses of two participants in the Phase 1 clinical trial. The International AIDS Vaccine Initiative and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation sponsored the mRNA HIV vaccine research, according to an International AIDS Vaccine Initiative release.
David Diemert, the clinical director of the GW Vaccine Research Unit, and Jeffrey Bethony, a professor of microbiology, immunology and tropical medicine, said in an email that the research unit’s team administered the first HIV vaccine dose at the Medical Faculty Associates building in late January. The said researchers are testing two mRNA HIV vaccines in Phase 1, which is the first human clinical trial.
Four institutions including GW enrolled 56 HIV-negative adult participants for the vaccines’ clinical trials, according to the release. The release states 48 patients will receive one or two doses of the primary HIV mRNA vaccine, 32 will receive an additional booster dose and eight participants will receive the booster dose alone.
“The vaccines we’re testing in this study required a lot of knowledge about the human immune response to HIV and the retrovirus itself,” Diemert and Bethony said in the joint email. “It is part of a very large team effort with groups at other institutions both here in the U.S. and abroad.”
Diemert and Bethony said GW’s Clinical Immunology Laboratory played a critical role in creating and optimizing the necessary sample methods to collect blood and tissues from the participants for Phase 1.
They said the research unit’s clinical team and the laboratory developed a procedure called ultrasound-guided lymph node fine needle aspiration. During the procedure, medical professionals would drain a lymph node – structures within the immune system that filter foreign substances like viruses – to remove cells from the germinal center, where white blood cells activate and mutate, using a needle guided by the ultrasound imaging.
They said the technique is unique to the HIV vaccine trials because the vaccine targets the germinal cells in the lymph node to stimulate B cells – white blood cells that produce antibodies – to deter them from entering the blood circulation.
Diemert and Bethony said the mRNA HIV vaccine aims to block the replication of HIV strains and stimulate the production of broadly neutralizing antibodies – which control the virus within HIV-positive patients’ immune systems.
“As with all vaccines at this investigational stage in their development, the primary outcome of the study is to determine the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine for the first time in humans,” they said. “It is the first step in a long developmental process for new vaccines.”
Diemert and Bethony said the research team hasn’t indicated a specific age group or population for the clinical trials’ adult participants, and they hope the vaccines will be made available to protect everyone at risk of HIV infection in the future.
They said they look forward to making a significant contribution toward developing a vaccine to protect people against HIV infection, noting that previous vaccine trials have been unsuccessful in combating the HIV pathogen.
“Using this new strategy, we hope to finally have a critical tool to protect individuals against this pathogen and alleviate the suffering that it has brought,” Diemert and Bethony said.
Infectious diseases experts said the HIV vaccine used mRNA technology, which helped create the COVID-19 vaccine and demonstrates how COVID-19 research can advance treatments for other health issues like sexually transmitted diseases and cancer.
Patrick Jackson, an assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases and International Health at the University of Virginia, said medical researchers use mRNA technology to inject patients with instructions to create their own viral protein cell and develop an immunity to the viral cell. He said the mRNA technology in the HIV vaccine can produce the viral protein similar to how the body could create the actual HIV viral protein, allowing researchers to easily and quickly manipulate the mRNA itself to create antibodies.
Jackson said he expects to see more vaccines with mRNA technology that can adapt to a person’s immune system more rapidly, allowing researchers to try different faster vaccination methods than a protein-based vaccine, like flu vaccines.
“I think that’s going to be the main advantage here, is that they will be able to get some initial responses and learn how their initial priming dose and boosting dose works in the body, and they’ll be able to adapt that and come up with new boosts much more rapidly and figure out what the optimal kind of vaccination strategy is going to be,” he said.
Eleanor Wilson, the associate director of clinical research at the School of Medicine Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland, said HIV is “tricky” because it targets the cells in one’s immune system that should be responding to an infection.
She said traditional vaccine strategies like administering a weaker strain of HIV can’t guarantee reliable results because researchers aren’t certain if they’ve actually weakened the strain enough to not infect a patient with HIV.
Wilson added that the continually changing mRNA technology in the COVID-19 and HIV vaccines allows researchers to consider a preventative vaccine to protect patients from HIV and also potentially create a therapeutic vaccine to reduce immune defects in HIV-positive patients in the future.
“Everything we’re learning in real time about COVID will not only inform our response to COVID but will inform our responses to a broad range of other public health threats like HIV, other sexually transmitted infections, other epidemic infections that we see periodically,” she said.
