When squash head coach Wendy Lawrence traveled to a showcase at Princeton University two summers ago to recruit, she was determined to find players who could take her women’s team to the next level.
At that tournament was a 5-foot tall high school junior from Bogotá, Colombia named Anna Gabriela Porras. Her aggressive style and intelligent play captured Lawrence’s attention.
“She was clearly a player I was interested in, but I knew she was also going to be pretty highly sought after by a lot of other schools,” Lawrence said.
Once she learned that Porras was a standout student, Lawrence started to press harder for the recruit.
Unlike other coaches vying for attention though, Lawrence had an advantage that the rest did not – Porras was already friendly with a player on the GW team, then-freshman Adriana Calderón.
With the help of Calderón, the attraction of D.C., and a large bulk of Lawrence’s scholarship allotment for the season, Porras committed to play at GW.
She immediately became the squash program’s highest-ranked recruit in GW history. It was the coup Lawrence had sought.
“I put a lot of effort and energy into securing her because I knew that she would be a game-changer,” Lawrence said. “It’s proven to be exactly that – the perfect move.”
Although Lawrence expected great things from Porras, she hardly imagined that Porras would make history by the end of her freshman year by becoming the first GW squash player ever, on both the men’s and women’s sides, to earn an All-American title in March.
It was a moment that Porras said brought her journey to the U.S. – and Foggy Bottom – full-circle.
“When I found out, it was an awesome feeling,” Porras, the No. 21-ranked player nationally, said. “The combination of a transition to a new school, a transition to a new country, leaving everything to live independently, so many things at the same time, but at the end I thought it was so worth it.”
The accolade capped her standout freshman season. She slotted as the No. 1 player for the Colonials this season, and won 16 of her 20 matches. Porras said that though the spotlight of the No. 1 slot is intimidating at times, in the end, it elevated her game.
“I feel pressure, but it’s one of those pressures that I like to feel,” Porras said. “For instance, when playing against another team, and we’re tied before I play my match, although that’s a lot of pressure, I like it because it pushes me towards winning. It gives me that sense of responsibility that I need to win, so that makes me give my all on the court.”
That motivation was key for Porras this season as she adjusted to life away from Colombia. Growing up, her family’s love for squash sparked her interest in the sport, she said, and by seventh grade, Porras knew she was interested in pursuing it competitively instead of soccer.
Just two years later, at age 15, Porras had become a member of the Colombian national team, where she found herself representing the country in tournaments around the world. She traveled to Qatar for the Junior Squash Championships, France for the World Championships, won a silver medal at the Pan American Games in Mexico and competed in another Pan American Games in Guatemala.
Even though she boasts a world of experience, Porras said coming to the U.S. was still an adjustment. An added struggle, she said, was her sport’s lower level of recognition in the U.S.
“Here in the U.S., people have asked me before, ‘What’s a squash?’” Porras said. “In Colombia, most of the people know at least what it is, although they don’t play it, they’ll know how to play it.”
Porras will globe-trot again this offseason when she heads to the 2013 World Championship qualifiers in France. Porras intends to start training for the qualifiers as early as July, but will be competing in tournaments in Colombia throughout the summer.
She’s also determined to help GW raise its program profile and eager to boost the Colonials to a championship title. With this season over, Lawrence is looking forward to bigger and better things for her freshman standout as Porras continues her GW squash career.
“I want her to get better every year,” Lawrence said. “Now that she is in the top 20, in terms of national ranking of college players, I want to see her go up that ladder and get as high as she possibly can.”

Hundreds of GW students have chosen to live in gender-neutral housing since the option opened up two years ago – not only sharing bathrooms and kitchens, but entire college experiences.
Junior Henry Morillo saw those situations as the perfect moments for comedy.
The journalism major created GWTV’s second ever sitcom “Gender Neutral,” which premiered Wednesday. The five episodes will run once every two weeks.
The project is Morillo’s independent study through the Department of Theatre & Dance. When he interned at ABC Studios in Los Angeles, he was exposed to the process the network uses to select shows.
“Being in that environment really inspired me to create my own show, especially with this position I have with GWTV,” Morillo said.
The show follows two main characters, Alex and Sam, played by sophomore Madeline Louden and freshman Jon Hering, respectively, as they try to live together in a gender-neutral residence hall.
The catch? Sam pretends to be gay to adjust to living with a female roommate.
“He has to put on this whole big show for everyone around him, except for a couple of his closest friends,” Hering said, “which he gets more comfortable with as the show goes on.”
Despite the show’s intended comedic and satirical nature, Morillo said he hopes the show is relatable, especially as more and more students choose gender-neutral housing options. In fall 2011, 144 students were placed in gender-neutral dorm rooms.
Morillo, a theatre minor and co-director of content development for GWTV, said living in gender-neutral housing himself this year inspired him to write the show.
He said the show also has a social message, satirizing the stereotypes steeped in perceived sexuality.
“By having these characters obsessed with these stereotypes, we’re trying to prove how ridiculous those stereotypes actually are. It’s not the mission, but if we can accomplish something along the way and still be funny, I think we are in the right place,” Morillo said.
The show is carried by a cast of four, including freshman Jon Weigell and junior Emily Nichols.
In crafting a rare sitcom for the student-run station typically known for its news programming, the seven-person writing team spent the fall semester solely developing the idea and the pilot script. The show was primarily filmed on campus, including in Morillo’s room in City Hall, J Street and Kogan Plaza.
The process was also a welcome distraction for the cast.
For Hering, it offered a departure from his GW School of Business curriculum and an opportunity to pursue a professional aspiration.
“Even though I’m majoring in business administration, I really want to be a professional actor,” Hering said. “So this has been one of my dreams since I’ve started acting. Going to a premiere of a show that I’m starring in? It’s really, really exciting and new to me.”

April 14
Jack Morton Auditorium
Presale tickets
$10 for students
$15 for general admission
Food will be served at 6 p.m., and the show will start at 7 p.m.

Cheers erupted as the bamboo poles stopped pounding into the ground and dancers ceased their quick-paced hops between them.
The dance, known as tinikling, is one of the 10 numbers in the Philippine Culture Society’s annual Culture Show Sunday at Jack Morton Auditorium, and it may be the hardest to master.
Participants practiced Sunday at the Mount Vernon Campus’ Hand Chapel, prompting applause from fellow group members as they made it through a perfect practice run.
“All the cultural and traditional dances performed really celebrate and provide a unique insight into a culture that I would otherwise have limited knowledge on,” freshman Emily Luu said. “The show does take a lot of hard work, but the cultural expansion and seeing all the hard work of how invested they are in retaining their traditions and culture really make it worth it.”
Traditional Filipino dances punctuate the Culture Show, weaving in and out of a student-written play about Filipino experiences with discrimination in the U.S. The Philippine Culture Society has organized the annual tradition for 13 years at GW, calling this year’s show “Tandaan XIII: Voiceless.”
“Voiceless,” written by the organization’s cultural affairs coordinators junior Maxine Tagay and sophomore Suty Komsonkeo, follows the challenges a Filipina nurse faces working in an American hospital and showcases key elements of the Filipino culture along the character’s journey.
Tagay said the storyline was inspired by a discrimination case against Filipinos in California.
The student organization’s executive board brainstormed plot ideas over the summer and continued to write and edit the script during the fall semester and winter break. Tagay said the script aims to illustrate important aspects of Filipino culture in a modern context.
“We also tried to capture the struggles of a young, immigrant Filipina nurse as she tries to keep in contact with her family back home but live out her life here in America,” Tagay added.
The Filipino dances, interspersed throughout the play, feature traditional music and authentic costumes, some handmade by students and some lent by the Embassy of the Philippines.
Each dance reflects the mood shown in the previous scene. Some of the show’s music is produced by the students on various drums, gongs and other traditional instruments such as the kulintang, a percussion instrument made from pot gongs which are is with wooden sticks.
“If there’s a fight that goes on in the play, it’s going to be a more passionate, intense dance. If it’s a happy scene, we’re going to do a rural dance where everyone is smiling and laughing,” Tagay said.
The dances display the five traditional suites of Filipino folk dance. Each routine draws from varying global cultures and regions: The Maria Clara Suite is inspired by Spanish roots, while the Igorot Suite comes from the Philippine’s mountain regions.
“I would say that the choreography, for both the modern and from what I’ve observed of the cultural, certainly takes some practice to perfect,” Luu said. “In terms of the modern dance, working with student-created choreography is a lot more fun…you are given a lot more freedom to express your own style.”

After tallying three total victories against Butler and Saint Louis last weekend, and clinching a sweep in its previous home doubleheader against Mount Saint Mary’s this season, the softball team had reason to take the field Tuesday with unbridled confidence.
The Colonials backed up their poise with another doubleheader sweep as junior Courtney Martin pitched masterfully, shutting out the Mountaineers until the sixth inning. Her performance helped the Colonials cruise to an 8-2 victory over Mount Saint Mary’s in the first game of the doubleheader.
GW (16-17) then churned out another dominating win over the Mountaineers, 5-1. Asserting their composure and focus from the start, the Colonials scored five unanswered runs in the first four innings.
“We knew this team was beatable,” head coach Stacey Schramm said. “I just told my girls to take it one play at a time, and then I knew we could get ahead early and get some runs on the board.”
In game one for the Colonials, Martin showed her control of opposing hitters, tallying nine strikeouts, and not relinquishing a walk until the bottom of the seventh. The first inning proved key for the Colonials, leading the scoreboard after two singles up the middle by seniors Amanda Zakeri and Tara Fogarty racked up two runs for GW.
The Colonials maintained a commanding 3-0 lead into the sixth inning, when Mount Saint Mary’s attempted a comeback, adding two runs to the board. But GW countered when senior Autumn Taylor smacked a home run to left field, setting off a rally that saw two more runs scored in the seventh.
The Colonials allowed the Mountaineers to load the bases in the final frame, but GW kept them from scoring, claiming an 8-2 victory.
The team’s success Tuesday, Schramm said, spilled over from its wins last weekend.
“We set smaller goals on Saturday, and we carried that mentality through today,” Schramm said. “I told the girls that if we stayed disciplined, focused and achieved our goals, then the outcome would be favorable.”
The Colonials began patiently in the second game, with three walks by Zakeri, Fogarty and sophomore Victoria Valos, loading the bases immediately in the first inning. It set up a fast start as the Colonials vaulted to a 5-0 lead.
Rico carried the momentum to the mound, tallying eight strikeouts and giving up only one run.
Schramm was impressed with Rico’s performance and persistence throughout the three-hour, seven-inning matchup – which was called due to darkness.
“Rico threw so well today,” Schramm said. “But she did struggle in the middle of the game, with three walks, yet she has so much speed and movement that I think, sometimes, she actually fools the umpires. I think that everyone can agree that she has been working so hard and is maturing every game.”
The Colonials will play St. Bonaventure Saturday, hoping to keep their momentum going.
“As we move on to Saturday, we are going to focus on each inning of each game and stay in the present,” Schramm said. “For us, it is about the journey, not the end result.”

After a six-month search, the University announced Monday that Ben Vinson, a vice dean at Johns Hopkins University, will be the new dean of the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences. He will become one of the highest-ranking black administrators and the only black dean at GW.
On paper, Vinson checks off all the boxes. When he arrives in August, he will bring diversity, experience in leading interdisciplinary and graduate programs and a passion for the humanities to the University’s largest college.
As a university which has prioritized science and engineering over other programs in the past few years, it’s encouraging that GW chose a candidate with a humanities background. And at the same time, as the University strives to make a name for itself as a growing research institution, Vinson’s experience as the head of interdepartmental programs and graduate studies at Johns Hopkins coincides well with GW’s growing emphasis on cross-disciplinary programs and research. His background as a Latin American scholar means he will also bring a unique expertise in the liberal arts to Columbian College, which houses GW’s humanities programs.
Vinson, at 42, could bring energy and enthusiasm as GW’s youngest dean, providing a fresh and innovative perspective from which the Columbian College could benefit.
But he faces many challenges. Though he seems like the ideal candidate on paper, he must prove that he can gain the trust of professors, who harshly criticized dean Peg Barratt last spring in a faculty survey. They said she failed to create an atmosphere of trust, and also lacked a vision for the school. Vinson must prove to faculty that he can communicate as a leader and understand the nuances of each department while crafting long-term plans for the college.
A GW dean’s role has changed in recent years. In 2010, University President Steven Knapp mandated that the academic leaders spend 40 percent of their time fundraising.
Even so, that means 60 percent of a dean’s time is dedicated to the departments, faculty, staff and students who make up his or her school.
There’s a great deal that Vinson can learn from the faculty survey that skewered Barratt last year. A new dean will not find success at the Columbian College – or within any college or university for that matter – without an open dialogue with faculty members. From day one, Vinson must work to cultivate a conversation with both junior and senior faculty.
Open communication is essential for the Columbian College leadership. But it is also important for upper-level University administrators.
After promising that the final round of the Columbian College dean search would be open and transparent, the University backtracked and declined to release the names of the six final candidates during the last stages of the process.
When asked why the search was being veiled, search committee officials said they wanted to protect candidates’ job security at their respective institutions.
In the early stages of a search, this approach is understandable. But in the final stages, the candidates have been vetted, their backgrounds have been scrutinized and they’ve survived several rounds of interviews.
At that point, the search is no longer a private affair.
Students and members of the community have a stake in the Columbian College’s future and deserved a chance to hear from potential leaders. It is a disservice to keep critical information from the community at a time of great change within GW’s largest college. We’ll never know who Vinson’s top competitors were, but we eagerly anticipate the start of his tenure.

The Colonials had just begun to think that their 0-9 start to the season was a mirage.
In a year when the team picked up a seasoned coaching staff and a spruced up stadium meant to reinvigorate their program, the baseball team christened Barcroft Park in conference play with three straight Atlantic 10 series wins.
But the supposed turnaround is starting to skid off the rails again.
After dropping three in a row to Richmond last weekend, GW (11-21, 5-4 A-10) fell again to District rival Georgetown on Tuesday, losing 9-1 in an effort that head coach Gregg Ritchie categorized as “uninspired, ‘don’t care’ baseball.”
The criticism came only four days after he called the Colonials’ performance against Richmond “absolutely putrid.” Now, after the four consecutive losses, Ritchie sees his club’s recent lifelessness as a much more serious – and frustrating – concern.
“They didn’t step up their effort. They didn’t step up their focus,” Ritchie said. “They didn’t want to, care to or desire to.”
The storyline from Tuesday was pretty simple: Georgetown tallied 13 hits while GW managed only two. The Hoyas’ pitching gave up one run while the Colonials’ pitching allowed nine and walked five.
The only ironic plot twist: a pitcher scored GW’s sole run. After a frustrating day at the plate for the entire Colonial lineup, Ritchie called on junior pitcher Colin Milon to pinch-hit in the bottom of the ninth for the number-three batter junior Owen Beightol. Milon singled, and would eventually cross the plate for GW’s first and last time on the day.
In fact, Milon was one of three pitchers to pinch-hit for position players in the Colonials’ final frame. Freshman Luke Olson eventually replaced freshman cleanup hitter Eric Kalman, too. Then, sophomore right-hander Matthew Seedorff took over for freshman catcher Mathieu Robért, who has more home runs this season than the rest of his teammates combined.
Ritchie has never been shy about benching players who don’t perform, but Tuesday’s substitutions perhaps indicate a new level of frustration Ritchie is feeling regarding his players’ level of effort – or lack thereof. Though the Colonials put together what he called an “inspired, activated and fully engaged” stretch before their current losing streak began, Ritchie said they have yet to deal with defeat maturely.
“You have to grow up. You have to be a man. We had no men stepping up today,” the former Pittsburgh Pirates hitting coach said. “Things aren’t gonna go perfectly all the time.”
The club’s attitude, Ritchie said, still at least partially resembles a deep-rooted clubhouse culture that was already part of the Colonials’ psyche upon his arrival.
“These guys are going through something that they have never been able to get over. The talent level gets a little bit challenged, and you get some guys out there that are going to play harder baseball than them,” Ritchie said. “They are still asking themselves, ‘Are we going to play tougher?’”
Still one game above .500 in conference play, GW is in a comfortable position in the A-10 field. And with five conference series remaining, there is still plenty of schedule left for the team to make improvements.
One thing is certain regarding the Colonials’ current jam: Ritchie expects more from his guys and is not afraid to make it known. At a basic level, he expects them to consistently “leave everything on the field” without regard for the opponent or the results of the previous game.
The first part of that might be learning how to bounce back from defeat.
“A squirrel can always find a nut every now and then. It’s the good squirrel that can find consistent nuts and actually lives through the winter,” Ritchie said.
GW will play a three-game series at Charlotte this weekend – the same site of this year’s conference tournament.

By 2018, there will be nearly three times as many job openings requiring computer science knowledge as there will be qualified applicants, according to a study by a Yale University professor.
To adequately prepare students to become productive members of a 21st century workforce, the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences must add a computer science component to its core requirements.
Education needs to be relevant, and computer science is poised to transform nearly every field of academic study, whether it’s politics, economics, science or even English. As the study by Yale professor Elizabeth Stark noted, today’s hyper-competitive job market demands at least a basic understanding of computer science to make a resume stand out, regardless of the industry.
Columbian College students are required to take math and natural science courses, pillars of any liberal arts education. But department heads recognize that some of the skills necessary to flourish in those topics don’t come so easily to everyone, which is why they offer introductory courses like Contemporary Science for Non-Science Majors. Given the range of computer science topics, the department could offer similar courses to fulfill that academic need.
Humanities majors could take advantage of the nearly unlimited Internet platforms and might benefit from the cultural and social dynamics at play in online communities.
The advantage of a liberal arts education is that it exposes students to a variety of disciplines.
Computer science seems like a daunting field. Some think that the skills techies have are so innate that if you’re not born with that mindset, the concepts are hard to grasp.
That’s been proven false by a number of online programs that make code easy for the average person to learn. Codecademy.com offers free, step-by-step lessons in topics and languages ranging from HTML to Python and Ruby.
And recent studies on mental skill development counter the argument that some can’t grasp these concepts, computer science professor Rahul Simha said.
“Over a hundred years of dogma in neuroscience has recently been overturned. It is now understood that the brain is elastic,” Simha told me, referring to the property of the brain known as neuroplasticity, in which it forms new neural connections and networks based on intellectual exposure and activity. “What that means to me is that anyone can learn any skill. How much they put into it is all dependent on effort.”
And while some might disagree, changing times call for an innovative approach. We are on the verge of an academic transformation, and the institutions that recognize it and take advantage of the opportunities will reap the rewards.

The University Police Department logged three times as many liquor law violations during Sunday’s Spring Fling concert than during Fall Fest and last year’s spring show.
Twelve students were charged with liquor law violations in University Yard starting at about 6 p.m., compared to three violations in the Smith Center during last April’s Spring Fling. Officers reported a total of 19 liquor law violations Sunday, four of which occurred in residence halls.
UPD recorded few or no liquor law violations at past Spring Fling concerts, which before 2010 were part of the Mount Vernon Campus event Fountain Fling.
At this year’s Fall Fest, three students were charged with alcohol violations as hundreds swarmed University Yard to see Diplo, a performance that ended in downpours.
GW capped the number of attendees at 800 for last year’s spring show, after it was forced indoors due to predicted thunderstorms. UPD recorded one charge of disorderly conduct that day in a residence hall.
UPD Chief Kevin Hay did not return a request for comment on the concert violations or on how officers prepare for large events that tend to attract students who have been drinking.
Some students said Sunday’s concert, held during one of the first warm weekends of the semester, was rowdier than in prior years. UPD charged six students with disorderly conduct at the show that featured Macklemore & Ryan Lewis and Walk the Moon.
Police arrested a student at about 7 p.m. for assaulting two police officers after he was denied access to the concert. He was not allowed past the gate because students had already packed the area around the stage. Thousands lined up as early as 2:30 p.m. to watch the show.
The student then shoved one of the officers and as police tried to arrest him, he resisted and struck another officer in the ear, Hay said.
UPD also charged a male subject with underage drinking after he was caught trying to get backstage. EMeRG assessed him, but he was not sent to the hospital. Officers barred the man from campus.

Food truck owners have mounted a fundraising and publicity campaign in the face of proposed regulations that could cut down mobile eateries’ parking options and tack on thousands of dollars in fines.
The potential legislation would limit trucks to park only in certain areas – including one spot along H Street from 20th to 22nd streets – to reduce congestion and preclude battles for coveted parking spots. The spots would be assigned through a monthly lottery.
Trucks not chosen in the lottery would have to park at least 500 feet from the designated zones and only along sidewalks with at least 10 feet of unobstructed space. The closest locations for trucks that do not win the H Street lottery would include spaces along Pennsylvania Avenue and another designated area at 17th and K streets.
Violators could also receive fines between $1,000 and $2,000.
The D.C. Council, which originally scheduled a public hearing on the proposed regulations for April 30, pushed the meeting to May because of a scheduling conflict. The city legislature has until June 22 to pass or reject the vending regulations.
Tasty Kabob operator Moustafa Shokry, one of nearly 50 members of the Food Truck Association of Metropolitan Washington, is helping to promote a social media campaign asking patrons to pressure their city representatives to vote the regulations down.
“I’ve been telling everyone to go to the website dcfoodtrucks.org and they can sign their name, email and phone number to say something about it,” he said. He said spreading the word would allow for a greater discussion of the regulations and hopefully a change in policy.
If the council does not act upon the proposed guidelines, food trucks would continue to follow “ice cream truck” rules that require parked vendors to have a line of customers waiting for service at all times.
The city has cracked down on food truck regulations in the last year as it updates its decades-old rules on mobile vending. The number of food trucks in the District has exploded to more than 100, and at least a half-dozen trucks park on or near the Foggy Bottom Campus each weekday.
Nearby Arlington County recently pitched looser regulations that could lure trucks to an area with more places to park.
Kirk Francis, owner of the Captain Cookie and the Milk Man truck that parks near campus, displayed a map of the proposed vending zones and restrictions on the front of his truck last week.
“We’ve been disappointed with the process thus far, and we’re hoping to kill these regulations, and hopefully not put 100 small businesses out of business overnight,” he said.
