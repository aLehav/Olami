WMATA's capital budget of $2.4 billion will allocate funds for infrastructure projects and ensure the Metro is “safe, reliable and efficient” for riders, the release states.
The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority’s Board of Directors approved an operating and capital budget of $4.8 billion for fiscal year 2024 Friday, which includes plans to both increase and reduce fares for certain riders starting July 1.
The budget includes a discount on trips for low-income customers and a Metrorail fare hike for long-distance travelers to prevent a budget deficit in the next fiscal year, return ridership to pre-pandemic levels and support an increase in bus and rail service frequency, according to the FY 2024 proposed plan. The release states WMATA officials will institute a region-wide low-fare program to make services more accessible to low-income customers, which offers Metro riders a 50 percent discount on trips if enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, a federal initiative that offers low- or no-income individuals food-purchasing assistance.
Officials will roll out the fare hike and low-income fare program July 1.
Officials will cap the MetroAccess fare – a shared door-to-door transit service for individuals who can’t use the rail or bus services because of disabilities – at $4 to increase ridership and revenue for MetroAccess after the pandemic caused both to decline. Officials will eliminate weekday peak and off-peak fares, setting the maximum cost for riders who travel long distances to $6 on weekdays, $2 on nights and weekends and adding a base fare price of 40 cents per mile after riders travel three miles.
“This is a win for customers,” Principal Director for the Federal Government board member Sarah Kline said. “We know MetroAccess serves our most vulnerable populations. To make this change for customers who use this service really does highlight our focus on equity across all Metro services.”
WMATA’s capital budget of $2.4 billion – part of the six-year Capital Improvement Plan of $14.4 billion – will allocate funds for infrastructure projects and ensure the Metro is “safe, reliable and efficient” for riders, the release states. Customers can expect officials to build new bus garages for new Metrobuses and MetroAccess vehicles as part of the Capital Improvement Plan, advance the rollout of 8000-series railcars and perform technological upgrades to the Blue, Orange and Silver rail line corridors, according to the release.
Officials state trains on Green and Yellow lines are expected to arrive every six minutes when officials fully implement the budget, with the Yellow Line operating between Huntington and Mount Vernon Square and the reopening of the Yellow Line Bridge on May 7. During peak service, Orange Line trains will run every seven and a half minutes during peak hours, which are 5 to 9:30 a.m. and 3 to 7 p.m., and every 10 minutes in off-peak service from 9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 7 to 9:30 p.m., according to the release.
The release states officials will introduce and disperse new printed system maps over the next couple of months to reflect the Yellow Line changes and the new Potomac Yard station expected to open this May, while updating digital maps immediately.
Three-quarters of Metro trains will run every six minutes once officials fully implement the budget and high frequency-service for the bus network will begin on 21 lines to improve efficiency and ridership, according to the release.
“The result will be a more useful network, offering better access to jobs and other destinations,” the release states. “These improvements address our customers’ top priorities and support the redesigning of Metro’s Better Bus Network.”
The Board approved an amendment to the fiscal year 2024 budget that removes the $2 fee for Senior SmarTrip cards, which applies to riders 65 years old and over, once the Board approves a staff-conducted “Title VI equity analysis and public participation” using data collected from the 2022 Metrorail Passenger Survey. The analysis concluded the proposal will likely benefit minority and low-income customers, according to its draft.
The release states the budget funds the Metro Integrated Communications Center’s creation, a “one-stop-shop” to improve communication among operations. The center will consolidate multiple operations, like Metro’s rail, bus and police, into a single control center working together to boost customer satisfaction and communication.
“This budget represents Metro’s continued commitment to provide safe, reliable, affordable and sustainable service by creating a more simplified and equitable fare system, optimizing the frequency of Metrobus and Metrorail services and increasing public safety throughout the transit system,” WMATA Board Chair Paul C. Smedberg said.

There are only so many puns to make about an intensely local, yearslong dispute over two “Transformers” sculptures outside of a Georgetown townhouse. So here goes nothing – there’s more than meets the eye when it comes to this quintessentially Georgetown quarrel.
The life-size statues are built out of an assortment of car parts and bear a striking resemblance to Bumblebee and Optimus Prime. If you haven’t had the pleasure of seeing these artful Autobots yet, you can find them standing guard on the sleepy sidewalk of Prospect Street. But you should hurry. The Old Georgetown Board, a federal panel with the power to approve or deny architectural and aesthetic changes in the neighborhood’s historic district – which effectively encompasses all of Georgetown – ruled earlier this month that the statues must come down because they threaten the neighborhood and its “historic character.”
The Board and neighborhood groups argue the sculptures stick out like a sore thumb in a neighborhood of federalist architecture, cobblestone streets and grand 18th-century manors. Most neighbors of Newton Howard – the Georgetown University neuroscientist who owns the disputed duo – decorate their homes with planters instead of reflecting mankind’s relationship with machines.
These sculptures don’t spoil the neighborhood’s history or its character. But they are different, and that seems to be a cardinal sin in Georgetown. When I cast my gaze across Rock Creek from Foggy Bottom, I see a deeply suburban mindset behind Georgetown’s drive for sameness. While the neighborhood is far from a master-planned community, its attitude toward anything different reminds me of where I grew up in the suburbs of Atlanta.
Community swimming pools, cookie-cutter homes and, most of all, conformity define towns like Johns Creek and Cumming, Georgia. Homeowners associations measure the height of your grass, check the color of your shutters and track when you put your trash out – at least mine do, anyway. The homes in these tightly run neighborhoods lack the centuries-old history of Georgetown’s housing stock, but the overriding focus on preserving “neighborhood character” – not to mention property values – is the same. Anything out of the ordinary, from an untrimmed shrub to a car parked in the street, incurs the wrath of angry neighbors and the Nextdoor crowd.

But not everyone wants to keep up with the Joneses, even if they live in a historic neighborhood or a shockingly authoritarian subdivision. From Georgia to Georgetown, people are quietly rebelling against the same old same old, the rules of HOAs and federal boards be damned. Come to my neighborhood in Georgia, and you’ll understand what I mean. Stroll past that faux skeletal triceratops that lounges on my neighbor’s lawn, chowing down on the leafy contents of a potted plant. Admire the bravery of the homeowner who dared to use a chain link fence instead of a wooden one. Stop by the house on the corner – though Christmas comes but once a year, its enormous, illuminated sign reading “JOY” is the gift that keeps on giving all season long.
But whether it’s a triceratops or a Transformer, the gaudy and the garish still aren’t world- or neighborhood-ending threats. At a certain point, they’re just part of the neighborhood.
I’ve gone to bat for historic preservation on campus after the University in 2021 demolished Waggaman House, which housed the Nashman Center for Civic Engagement and Public Service, and razed Staughton Hall in 2022. But the Old Georgetown Board’s decision isn’t an attempt to maintain historic or noteworthy architecture – that’s not what’s at stake here. Howard isn’t tearing down his historic, $4 million townhouse or starting new construction, two actions that would fall under the purview of the Old Georgetown Board.
Instead, the Board and residents are focused on preserving a nebulous vibe of “old.” You can maintain a building, but freezing a neighborhood in time is impossible – Georgetown has traffic lights and stop signs, and its well-to-do residents seem to have swapped the horse and carriage for BMWs and Range Rovers. If automobiles pass the test in tony Georgetown, then why can’t Autobots?
Juxtaposition, not homogeneity, gives neighborhoods their character. Just look at Foggy Bottom’s Historic District, where apartment buildings and hotels mingle with historic row houses. The past and the present complement each other and so do historic preservation and self-expression. Who wants to live in a museum piece? A little individuality here or there is a fair price to pay for the maintenance of D.C.’s historic architecture and urban fabric. The best neighborhoods can make room for new buildings and uses or, at the very least, people who want to be different.
Whether I stay in D.C. or move elsewhere once I graduate next year, I’ve realized I don’t only want a neighborhood with character – I want a neighborhood with characters. Georgetown may be as staid as ever, but let’s not let historic preservation quash self-expression.

This past season, Brendan Adams etched himself into the GW record books, playing 37.6 minutes per game, tied for the highest in GW history.
In his final season playing collegiate basketball, graduate student guard Brendan Adams became a true pillar of the Colonials’ offense, finishing second on the team in scoring and assists.
Adams joined the team as a senior in the 2021-22 season following three years at the University of Connecticut, where he averaged 4.9 points in just under 18 minutes per game. In his first and senior year with the Colonials, he teamed up with the talented backcourt duo of James Bishop and Joe Bamisile, and he stepped up in his graduate season to become a consistent starter and number two scorer on the team.
Starting 14 out of 29 games for the Colonials, Adams averaged 8.2 points per game on a measly .380 shooting clip in the winter of 2021-22. The team finished with a disappointing 12-18 record and officials fired coach Jamion Christian after the season, turning to former Miami Associate Coach Chris Caputo to lead the program. 
Bamisile, too, left the team, joining the Oklahoma Sooners and leaving a hole in the Colonials’ backcourt.
With the departure of Bamisile, Adams stepped up to a full-time starter role as a shooting guard, exploding onto the Atlantic 10 scene with a dominant and career-high 17.4 points per game. He shot .470 from the field and earned the A-10’s Most Improved Player award. 
“I don’t think it was just one summer, one offseason,” Adams said. “I think it’s an accumulation of all the work I’ve put in every summer for my whole life. I don’t see growth as an overnight process. You never know when it’s going to come.”
Entering the season with a new coaching staff, Adams found Caputo’s free-flowing, isolation-heavy system easy to adopt and player-friendly. He credits the freedom and trust from Caputo with boosting his confidence to new levels. 
“I hadn’t really scored at a high level, and Coach Caputo came in and he trusted me,” Adams said. “He saw something in me from my previous years, and it kind of allowed me to play with the freedom that allowed me to feel comfortable.”
Adams’ success came hand in hand with his backcourt partner Bishop, who had a career year of his own, leading the A-10 with 21.6 points per game. The Baltimore natives’ existing friendship and rapport from playing against one another in youth games transferred to the collegiate court in the form of communication and cohesion.
“We’ve known each other pretty much our whole lives,” Adams said. “We’ve been playing basketball with and against each other since we were seven or eight years old.”
Adams was a nearly nonstop presence on the court, playing 37.6 minutes per game. His longest game included a 48-minute double-overtime performance against Richmond in February where he scored a career-high 35 points and broke GW’s single-game 3-point with nine shots from deep in a 107-105 win. 
In his fifth year, Adams took pride in his veteran presence, staying level-headed through difficult stretches like the midseason, conference-play slide and understanding that even the hottest teams can cool down. He said Caputo instilled a forward-looking mentality, no matter the score of the previous game – Adams’ career-high, game-winning performance against Richmond followed a three-game losing streak.
Outside of his success on the court, Adams earned A-10 All-Academic honors while majoring in business administration at the School of Business. He credits his success to his ability to stick to a routine, carving out time to study in his room or at tables outside South Hall, where he lives on campus. 
“The routine wasn’t exact, obviously practice changes, things change on different days, but I just knew I had to get my homework done here,” Adams said. “I had to study here. I had to do class, and it was a routine. And I didn’t let myself play video games until I was done with my homework.”
Adams said he also loves spending his time off the court visiting his family in Maryland. When he’s on campus, he likes playing and enjoying the outdoors with his dog.
With his NCAA career in the rearview mirror, Adams says he wants to play basketball for as long as he can. 
“Right now I’m kind of going through all the processes and seeing what’s available,” Adams said. “I just signed with an agent, so I’m just looking forward to seeing what’s next for me as far as a professional career.”
Adams played in the 3X3U National Championship in Houston earlier this month, a showcase of elite college seniors representing their respective programs with their college threads in a pick-up basketball setting. Adams stood out from the competition with highlight-reel scoring and scorching hot 3-point shooting that helped his squad, Team Hoopers, win the tournament title.
He said the tournament gave him the chance to don the Buff and Blue one last time after his collegiate career, which ended in a disappointing playoff loss to Saint Joseph’s in the second round of the A-10 tournament.
“When I got the call and the opportunity to just play in the GW jersey one more time, to show up for GW, it was a no-brainer for me,” Adams said. “I just wanted to go play and do that.”

SMHS personnel will help ISUMS officials train and recruit future permanent faculty, according to a release the medical school issued last month.
The School of Medicine and Health Sciences will start providing faculty, admissions and curriculum development support this summer for a new medical school in Amman, Jordan.
Huda Ayas, the associate dean for international medicine at SMHS, said July 1 will mark the start of a six-year partnership with Ibn Sina University for Medical Sciences, which opened in December, in which GW faculty will help establish the school during its first years in existence. Darwish Badran, the president of Ibn Sina University, said SMHS faculty will temporarily serve in faculty “leadership” roles and teach courses at the ISUMS campus in Jordan until the university can fill those positions with alumni with degrees in basic sciences, like biochemistry and microbiology.
SMHS personnel will help ISUMS officials train and recruit future permanent faculty, including future Jordanian graduates from SMHS, according to a release the medical school issued last month. Ayas said ISUMS will pay GW for its support, including compensation for GW faculty who teach at the Jordan-based medical school, contingent on the number of hours they work.
“It provides academically interesting opportunities to teach overseas for selected GW faculty while enhancing the quality of medical education in Jordan,” Ayas said in an email. “Everyone benefits.”
Ayas declined to comment on the total size of ISUMS’ estimated payment to GW.
She said ISUMS initiated the partnership because of SMHS’ “many successful” medical education programs in Jordan, like the school’s clinical and internship affiliation with Jordan Hospital since 2005.
Ayas said SMHS signed the agreement to provide academic assistance, like expanding faculty and developing curriculum, to ISUMS in 2018, pending the school’s acquisition of a “necessary license.” She said ISUMS officials completed the licensing process a few months ago after meeting Jordanian government requirements.
Ayas said the partnership will allow both universities to achieve their academic missions of providing high-quality medical education. She said the SMHS’ services will vary as the makeup of ISUMS faculty and curricula continue to develop and officials identify educational needs.
“GW is well recognized internationally for our medical education programs,” Ayas said in the email. “That recognition will continue to be enhanced by our support of ISUMS.”
Darwish Badran, the president of Ibn Sina University, said SMHS personnel will hold online courses and seminars for ISUMS faculty to aid in their development when the partnership takes effect. Badran said SMHS faculty will supervise teaching activities, curriculum and student assessment while they teach courses like microbiology, immunology and pharmacology.
He said Jordanian higher education authorities require medical universities to have an agreement with an internationally “high-ranking” university, and ISUMS chose GW because of its reputation and “long-standing relation” with Jordan Hospital. He said GW has collaborated with Jordan Hospital since 2005 through programs including a summer internship program that allows GW’s medical students to study at the facility and do clinical rotations.
He said ISUMS hopes to distinguish its research and medical education with the support of SMHS.
SMHS is affiliated with more than 70 international medical institutions across the world – more than any of its 12 peer schools – through partnerships and projects like research fellowships, according to the medical school’s website.
“The reputation of GW and their help will make it possible to achieve our goals,” Badran said in an email.

The GW School of Business is expanding its 4+1 combined degree program to undergraduate students in four of GW’s other academic schools, according to a University release.
Students from the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences, the Elliott School of International Affairs, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the Milken Institute School of Public Health can now apply for GWSB’s 4+1 program, which allows students to earn both a bachelor’s degree and an accelerated master’s degree in five years, the release states. Anuj Mehrotra, the dean of GWSB, said officials expanded the 4+1 program in response to “employers’ call for multidisciplinary education” as the job market becomes more competitive.
“We are thrilled to extend this combined degree offering to B.S. and B.A. undergraduate students in CCAS, the Elliott School, GW Engineering and Milken Institute SPH,” Mehrotra said.
Officials “encourage” undergraduates to apply for the 4+1 program during their junior year, according to the release. Once undergraduates are accepted to the program, they are able to register for graduate-level courses, which are included in their undergraduate tuition.
The release states that the GWSB 4+1 program provides students with “financial benefits” like the ability to apply for the Grad2Grad program, which awards current undergraduates who pursue a master’s degree or a graduate certificate at GW with a 10 percent discount on tuition.
GWSB will also offer students 25 to 50 percent discounts on graduate classes they take outside of the ones that apply to their undergraduate degree in their 4+1 program, according to the release.
Victoria Abril, an alumna who completed GWSB’s 4+1 program in 2020, said enrolling in the program gave her more time to take electives at the University. She said she took one “meaningful” government accounting elective that gave her skills needed for her current job as a federal audit senior associate at KPMG, a professional services firm and accounting organization.
“Having taken those elective courses really gave me the opportunity and kind of the leg up in my current role,” Abril said in the release. “Everything that I’ve learned in the classroom at GW I’ve been able to put into action during my time at KPMG.”

Freshman Rob Brown said piano key and tuning issues in Phillips and West halls prevent him from getting the “full experience” from practice.
Students looking to practice on University-owned pianos said they have found their sessions off-key.
More than a dozen students studying music said sweltering practice rooms, untuned piano strings and broken keys and pedals have left pianos in Phillips Hall consistently out of tune. Students said the piano issues have made it difficult to improve their piano skills, and GW employees should conduct more frequent checks to tune the pianos and fix broken parts.
Phillips Hall practice rooms contain at least six pianos along with six grand pianos in the building’s classrooms reserved for professor demonstrations and student performances. West Hall has practice rooms in its basement that house three total pianos.
University spokesperson Julia Metjian said GW employees respond to piano maintenance requests “as needed.” She declined to comment on how often GW employees maintain Phillips Hall pianos and how the University intends to prevent functionality issues.
More than a dozen students who play the piano said hot practice rooms and a lack of piano maintenance make playing the Phillips Hall pianos “frustrating,” but they’re left with few other options to play on campus.
Pianos in Phillips Hall are available on a first-come, first-served basis, according to the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design’s website. Students in Corcoran can request free GWorld card tap access to the practice rooms in Phillips Hall, while non-Corcoran students are required to pay a yearly $30 subscription to access the building’s practice rooms.
Freshman Rob Brown, a music minor who has played piano since he was four, said piano key and tuning issues in Phillips and West halls prevent him from getting the “full experience” from practice. He said the keys in Phillips’ vertically strung upright pianos are also in “bad shape” after losing the resistance that controls the pressure musicians can place on the keys.
“That’s not extremely accommodating to people taking piano more seriously in my opinion,” Brown said.
Junior Letong Quin, an international affairs major and music minor who has played piano since he was four, said his clothes get wet after playing piano in the Phillips practice rooms due to high temperatures and humidity, which he said is due to a lack of air conditioning.
“Once it gets into the summer, the problem gets more obvious,” Quin said. “I’m wearing a shirt today. After two hours of practice, I’m expecting this entire thing to get wet.”
Loren Kajikawa, the chair of the music program in Corcoran and an associate professor of musicology at GW, said Corcoran hires a technician to tune and maintain the Phillips Hall pianos at least once per semester. He said students can email faculty if they notice issues with pianos.
The Piano Technicians Guild, an international organization of registered piano technicians, recommends pianos be tuned at least four times a year and pianos with more frequent use be tuned more often, according to its guidelines.
Kajikawa said Phillips, Smith and Rome halls have had “serious” issues with maintaining “consistent temperatures,” a problem that could damage pianos. He said the music department has devoted a “significant” portion of its budget to maintaining the pianos in Phillips where temperatures fluctuate between too hot and too cold in short spans of time due to the District’s inconsistent weather, which can make the instruments go out of tune because piano strings expand and contract rapidly.
“Even with this regular maintenance, some pianos are better than others at holding their tune,” Kajikawa said in an email.
James Colwell, a Maryland-based piano technician who tuned pianos at GW in the early 1980s, said the pianos’ frequent amount of play and the humidity in practice rooms likely weathered the condition of the instruments. He said pianos should be kept at around 45 percent humidity year-round.
Colwell said it could be more affordable for the University to replace pianos more than 40 years old instead of conducting repairs that cost “a lot of money” because aged pianos commonly have “multiple” functionality problems. 
“There’s two things that go wrong in music schools – the pianos get played a lot, and the heating and cooling system is not up to snuff,” Colwell said.
Marilyn Nonken, a professor of music and music education at New York University and the chair of the university’s Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions, said a team of five technicians maintains the 300 pianos at NYU. She said they tune and replace piano strings, keys and pedals on a consistent basis. She said the technicians keep maintenance logs and predict issues like broken parts so they can plan piano maintenance years in advance.
“Some instruments are tuned every few weeks, practice room pianos and some studios receive tunings less often and public-facing spaces and recording spaces will receive tunings more often,” Nonken said in an email.
Junior Nick Anmahian, an information systems and music double major who has played piano for 16 years and performs with the GW Jazz Orchestra, said while there are enough pianos on campus for the number of piano players, the quality of the pianos is lacking because of broken pedals and keys.
“There have been several times where I can’t get access to a piano that I think is good enough to get some good practicing on,” Anmahian said.
Anmahian said playing piano is an “escape” for him, and the feeling of pressing keys and hearing the music helps him deal with stress. He said problems with the function of the pianos can make it difficult to express those feelings.
“When the piano is in a really poor condition, it’s hard to express the things you want to express when there’s that thing nagging at you that’s like, ‘Wow, that sounds like crap,’” Anmahian said.

I was born in the heart of the Shenandoah Valley and raised by the Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia. Feeling connected to or like I was a part of nature, rather than just a spectator, was a critical part of my upbringing. I didn’t have to go out into nature – I was living in it. But I didn’t know how much nature mattered to my day-to-day life until I left Virginia for Foggy Bottom.
The only thing I knew before college was that I wanted to live in a city rather than near one. I didn’t expect to miss everything back home when I chose GW, but the soullessness of concrete buildings and the endless number of heavily windowed offices became a constant reminder of what I left behind – the cows as they grazed in my neighbor’s pasture, the clean and dewey air, the constant horizon of rolling blue mountains and the shadows left on them during cloudy days. Most of all, I missed the tree in my front yard where my hammock lives all summer and I can sit, shaded, staring right at the mountains.
Now, if you walk through Kogan Plaza and turn toward the large patch of trees on the way toward the fire station or Monroe Hall on a spring day, you’re likely to find me nestled in my hammock, reading a book, snacking on a makeshift picnic spread, listening to music or taking a nap.
Often, I find myself surrounded by visitors – other hammockers coming and going in neighboring trees, slightly sheltered from the buzz of people on a nice day in Kogan. They hang their hammocks on the grave of Staughton Hall, along the walkways of Kogan sure to see someone they know, tied from a tree to a railing attached to Corcoran Hall, along Pennsylvania Avenue and scattered in the trees of the National Mall.
It is in the trees that I and my hammocking compatriots can find tranquility in the middle of a cold, competitive city and the fast-paced, rigid sterility of GW. Unlike my nature-filled Virginia valley, campus life in D.C. is paralyzing. I long for the quiet I found in nature back home each time I stand on the corner of 23rd and G streets, waiting impatiently to cross or cannot sleep because of the constant chatter of people outside every night. Even trying to take a walk in the fresh air to clear my mind turns into an annoying game of “dodge the tourists.”
Seeing other people enjoying nature and hammocking in the trees like me is the closest I have come to feeling back at home. In a way, my two-person black and teal hammock has also been the place where I have felt most at ease while in college. I am able to disappear from the hustle of the outside world I share with my peers and return to my roots, a moment to breathe away from my stressful and fast-paced campus life with a good book.
I have found my escape in my hammock – pink flowers rustling in the trees over my head, the wind whistling over me, easing my anxieties away. The breeze transports me back to the mountains and refreshes my mind. I find calmness and purpose in my hammock, where nature becomes the balance between urban life and my rural fantasy.
As for the other people scattered in the trees, I can only hope they also feel connected to nature and the peace it can bring to our busy lives. I feel a camaraderie with my fellow hammockers at the most basic level because of our shared, inherent human need for nature – a place where you can let go of your worries and forget the pressures of the city and monotony of campus life.
When I am in my hammock, I can keep my longing for Shenandoah National Park at bay. It tides me over until it is summer once again, and the Virginia country roads can take me home to the quaint and familiar tree in my grandparents’ yard.

Once you arrive for your scheduled time, you’ll enter the sleek, artsy spot as soft music and the hum of tattoo machines fill the atmosphere.
If you’ve ever wanted a tattoo but weren’t sure about the commitment, Ephemeral Tattoo will make those worries – and your ink – disappear.
At this “made to fade” tattoo parlor, which opened last month on the H Street Corridor, visitors can get real tattoos applied through the regular ink-and-needle process, but with Ephemeral’s first-of-its-kind ink, the tattoo will gradually fade away in about one to three years. Ephemeral’s D.C. studio is the most recent edition to join six other locations in cities like Los Angeles, Atlanta and New York City as a comfortable outlet to test out the world of tattoo artistry without the fear of subsequent regret hanging over your head.
Since tattoo parlors shut down during the onset of COVID-19, temporary tattoos have peaked in popularity as people began experimenting with temporary ink they could apply at home. Ephemeral bases each studio around its respective location, nodding to the club culture of Atlanta for its studio in The Big Peach, drawing inspiration from the desert for its Houston location and highlighting a gallery of local art for its D.C. spot. Since Ephemeral started testing their ink around five years ago, about 50 tattoo artists have administered more than 10,000 Ephemeral tattoos across their locations.
“We’re excited to join Maketto, The Atlas Performing Arts Center and the Mehari Sequar Gallery as another form of creative expression in a neighborhood that feels very evocative of the creative side of D.C.,” Danny Orenstein, Ephemeral’s vice president of development, said in an email.
The key difference between this tattoo parlor and others is the ink. Their ink uses plant-based and bio-absorbable ingredients instead of metal-based pigments or paraphenylenediamine, the most common allergen in temporary tattoos. The ingredients in Ephemeral’s ink shrink as your body breaks them down over time – about 70 percent of Ephemeral tattoos fade in fewer than two years, and the rest takes no more than three, according to a money-back guarantee.
The fading time varies from person to person, depending on the placement and design of your tattoo, your body’s response, skin tone and how well you care for the affected area. Ephemeral provides customers with a complimentary body wash and moisturizer in addition to a protective patch and anti-itch cream if needed, making aftercare simple.
Ahead of your appointment, you’ll fill out a form to share your design idea, placement and style. Once you arrive for your scheduled time, you’ll enter the sleek, artsy spot as soft music and the hum of tattoo machines fill the atmosphere. While you wait for your name to be called, you can leaf through a selection of tattoo designs on the coffee table. Potted plants are spread throughout the naturally lit studio while vibrant paintings and prints adorn the yellow floor-to-ceiling gates, sectioning off space to prep and receive a tattoo.

At Ephemeral, your design will fall into one of two defined categories – “The Subtle” or “The Statement” – depending on the size, shading and complexity of your design. A smaller, more minimalist tattoo will fall on the subtle side, with prices ranging from $195 to $245. For a bigger, prominent choice, your design will land on the statement side, costing between $350 and $550.
Customers can also choose from six designs from Ephemeral’s Y2K Flash Collection, including a pair of dice and “baby” written in gothic font, which each go at $150 a pop and can be up to two inches in length and width. The parlor only offers black ink, and particular locations are not available for inking, like hands and feet. But Ephemeral is in the works to expand its color and placement selection with more complex and vibrant ink designs.

For my visit, I opted for a small and dainty fleur de lis design on the back of my shoulder with strokes of varying thickness but mostly consisting of fine lines. My tattoo artist printed out four sizes of my design for me to choose from, ranging from a few centimeters to about two inches in length and width. My session was complimentary, but a small tattoo like that would cost between $195 and $245.
Walking up to the chopping block, I worried about the intensity of the pain, but my nerves subsided as the process began. In my experience, the pain level felt equivalent to receiving a shot at a doctor’s office. While laying on the bed and chatting with the artist about music, I actually had a quite comfortable experience during the roughly 10 minutes it took him to transfer the design onto my shoulder.

Knowing my tattoo would fade in a few years, I could concentrate on the excitement of how the temporary design would accessorize my body instead of fretting about a lasting permanence. The ink had barely gotten to dry by the time I was itching to show off the design.
While the tattoo is expected to vanish between one to three years, Ephemeral offers a complimentary tattoo if your tattoo lasts less than a year. If your tattoo lasts longer than three years, you’ll get your money back. And if you think your tattoo could use some perfecting, Ephemeral will give you a free touch-up within 60 days after your appointment.
For those eager to experiment with a tattoo or two, Ephemeral gives you an excuse to test the waters. Derek Burgess, a tattoo artist at Ephemeral, said the majority of Ephemeral’s clientele falls within a young, 18 to mid-20s range of people who are often unsure about their first tattoo, but he’s seen them emerge happy with their new ink.
“I understand a lot of our clients are first-timers, and they don’t know,” Burgess said. “And they’re really unsure. To actually see them happy at the end is – it’s rewarding.”
