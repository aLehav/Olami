Correction Appended
The GW bookstore saw a 5 percent jump in rental sales this year, even as it continues to compete with cheaper online sellers.
Store manager Bob Blake called the rental program “a huge success,” comprising 28 percent of total textbook transactions.
Textbook purchases and rentals make up the bulk of the store’s sales, while e-book sales have made up between 1 and 2 percent of all sales since the bookstore began tracking digital sales last spring, Blake said.
The store’s book rentals have fluctuated over the past several years. In fall 2011, the bookstore projected an increase in sales after rental purchases during move-in weekend came in at almost 5,000 rentals.
Sales peaked in fall 2010, when 11,000 books were rented during one semester.
Each rental is sold to GW at 50 percent off the list price, allowing GW to rent the books out at about 25 percent off.
Blake declined to provide the bookstore’s total sales numbers. He said while some students opt for online retailers, the bookstore remains the most convenient because of its on-campus location, easy return policy and textbook sorting by course number and section.
“Students are savvy. There are different outlets for all textbooks. But again, we hone in on the fact that we provide the most options,” Blake said. “We provide the fact that it’s the right book at the right time at the right price, according to our pricing matrices.”
And some sites, like SlugBooks.com compare university bookstores’ selling and rental prices with the same textbooks on Amazon.com, Chegg.com and BookRenter.com.
Online sellers can typically sell books for cheaper. A textbook for an introduction to psychology course costs $197.25 for a new book and $148.00 for a used book, though the same textbook costs $75.50 on eBay and $42.37 on AbeBooks.com, according to a Hatchet review.
Senior Wyndham Ferris said he only goes to the bookstore when he’s down to the wire.
“[I go if] I’m pressed for time and I don’t [have] my stuff together, but normally I get the bulk of my books online for the cheapest I can get them,” Ferris said.
Sophomore Rachel Méndez, a criminal justice major, said websites like Amazon, which provide free shipping, negate the convenience of the GW bookstore.
“I never buy books from the bookstore. My chemistry lab book, which is literally a notebook of worksheets, was $85. Ridiculous. The prices at the bookstore are the antithesis of fair,” Méndez said.
This article was updated March 2, 2013 to reflect the following:
The Hatchet incorrectly reported that the GW bookstore saw a 5 percent slump in rental sales. It actually saw a 5 percent rise. Rentals during the spring of 2013 constituted 28 percent of total sales. Manager of the Store Bob Blake also did not infer that the store turns a profit. We regret these errors.

Before Froggy Bottom Pub relocates in April, owner Hien Bui said she will hand off pieces of its history – signs for pho and pizza, cricket scoreboards and postcards – to the patrons she’s grown close to over the last 13 years.
Before the campus landmark moves to 2021 K St. Bui will auction off more than 100 pictures and signs that hang on the pub’s walls. Cash from the sales will raise money for local veterans and the homeless.
“I love them so much. I appreciate their service,” said Bui, who holds an open house for former soldiers every year on Veteran’s Day. “I appreciate them. I don’t make them feel like they’re different from anybody else. I make them feel like they’re glad that they’re home. I respect them.”
Bui said she will bring just a few pots and pans, and maybe a few photos of her favorite customers, to the new address. She will sell some items, like signs for beer and posters of the menu, on eBay for about $2 each. The pub will also sell $10 glasses that typically serve house beer, allowing customers to keep the mugs with the signature green Froggy logo.
Bui will hold the invite-only auction and gathering on April 28, a few days before the move. All proceeds will go to Joseph’s house, a hospice home for the homeless, and VietNow, an organization for veterans and their families.
“The people who are going to come that day are the people who have been engaged with the pub for the last at least four or five years,” Bui said. “It will be very intimate. We should be able to talk – be able to share some memories before we leave the place.”
The University owns seven properties along the 2100 block of Pennsylvania Avenue that will be torn down to make way for a new office building over the next year or two. The D.C. Zoning Commission greenlighted the project Monday.
Bui was born in Vietnam and lived in France for several years before coming to the U.S. in 1982. She and her husband, Hoang Bui, took out a loan on their home and borrowed money from friends to buy the decades-old college bar in 1999. At the time, they had less than $10,000 in their savings account.
Bui said she wanted to send the money along to a veterans organization because the U.S. has given her family “so much.”
Class of 2011 graduate Jason Lifton called the pub his “first kitchen” as an undergraduate. Now a graduate student at GW, he said he still frequents Froggy twice a week.
He said Bui often works with the University’s Office of Veterans Services and veteran student organizations.
“Everyone likes to have that home away from home, and she’s really become that comfortable place for veterans,” he said. “She’s always going out of her way to support student veterans and the veteran community as a whole.”
The Buis originally planned for the pub to leave its Pennsylvania Avenue home on Feb. 1, but reservations with tour groups put off the move to late April, she said.
The new location, which will feature the bar and restaurant in one spot, with about 30 seats outside under a veranda. Bui said many locals have shared their excitement about the new place – which will offer the same menu and cheap beer prices.
“They know we’ll be there, and no matter what – new place, old place – we’ll still be there. It’s still the same. We still welcome the veterans every year. It won’t be any different,” Bui said.

Former law school Dean Paul Schiff Berman was an innovative leader.
He quickly established new student-oriented programs – like the Inns of Court – and worked to tailor legal education to fit students’ specific interests and career goals.
But he failed to garner faculty support, and his tenure ended after a mere 18 months, at which point he took a position in the provost’s office. Frustrated with his confrontational approach, some professors argued that he was trying to undermine the faculty governance process. To faculty members, some of whom have worked at the law school for decades, Berman’s approach seemed disrespectful.
Berman is not alone. He is one of three deans in the last year who have been openly criticized for their leadership styles and inability to work well with faculty.
Columbian College of Arts and Sciences Dean Peg Barratt announced last May that she would resign over the summer, a month after her own faculty said in a school-wide survey that she failed to work with them and could not foster an “atmosphere of trust.”
Professors in the GW School of Business told The Hatchet in December that they felt largely shut out from the decision-making process under Dean Doug Guthrie’s autonomous leadership style.
During this time of uncertainty for law schools nationwide, professors who spoke with The Hatchet did not say they took issue with the new programs Berman sought to institute at GW. It was not his initiatives that angered faculty members, but rather the alleged abruptness and forcefulness with which he sought to achieve them.
It is worth noting that when it comes to deans at GW, grievances have hardly focused on policy issues. Faculty frustrations over the last year have stemmed from deans’ inabilities to govern in a way that effectively galvanized the support of the professors.
Even a leader whose objectives are in line with faculty can see his plans go awry. Strong rapport with one’s colleagues holds  an importance that extends beyond simply fostering a positive work environment; it has proved necessary to getting things done.
At a time of shrinking law school applications and a sour legal job market, many professors felt as though their thoughts and opinions were not taken into consideration.
A leader must have the support of the people who answer to him. In this instance, Berman failed to obtain the confidence of faculty before going forward with his ambitious goals.
In contrast, Interim Dean Gregory Maggs, a long-time law professor, plans to focus largely on teamwork and collective action between the faculty and administration.
And while an interim dean has little time to accomplish long-term goals, it is reassuring to see that Maggs has at least indicated that he hopes to engage the faculty in an ongoing dialogue.
Going forward, across all of GW’s schools and disciplines, open and constructive dialogue is key. There are undoubtedly changes that will need to be made in the future, but any new dean has to include the faculty at the center of the conversation for upcoming initiatives.
Professors are the closest link many students have to the University. They know what students need and expect from their education, and help guide them during their time at GW. Faculty voices are critical.
GW aims to achieve lofty goals. But every time a deanship upset happens, that momentum is broken. Communication and faculty harmony have proven crucial to carrying out an agenda, and we hope this pattern urges future leaders to earn their confidence.

I am part of a large fraction of students who will graduate early from GW.
My decision to do this is advantageous for many reasons, almost all of which are financial. Instead of spending money on tuition, expensive GW housing and a mandatory meal plan for another year, I’ll hopefully join the workforce early.
Graduating early is made possible in large part by Advanced Placement credits. As it stands, they can be applied toward the total 120 credits required to graduate, and they can be put toward students’ majors and minors.
However, AP credits do not fulfill general curriculum requirements. And that hurts students.
The University should allow AP credits to fulfill general requirements. That model existed before the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences revamped its curriculum in 2010 and should return.
All students – not just those who plan to graduate early – should spend their college years advancing within their fields of study instead of bogging themselves down with redundant general requirements.
The University already offers credits for specific AP courses. For example, a high score on the AP Calculus AB course is considered equivalent to MATH 1231, single variable calculus. But although the University offers equivalent credit for that course to students majoring in mathematics, students in other fields aren’t so lucky.
The policy prohibits students from applying credit they earned in high school to anything other than their major or minor.
But if a student passed the AP Calculus exam, he or she should not have to repeat the course.
The Columbian College wants each student to graduate with a specific set of skills, and the theory is that the general education requirements ensure these skills are imparted.
But a student who received a high score in AP Calculus would surely benefit more from courses in his major than a redundant general education requirement. The University virtually tells students that they already have the particular skills the course imparts, but cannot receive credit for them.
Preventing students from applying AP credits for required courses forces them to spend time taking the same course at GW that they already took in high school. The system prohibits them from enrolling in courses toward their field of study, and gaining the skills that would really maximize the amount of knowledge students get out of their degree.
Changing this policy could attract more students to GW at a time when the application rates have plateaued.
The University wants students with AP credits, who already show academic excellence in high school, to apply. Allowing their AP credits to count toward general education requirements is just another way the University could convince and incentivize prospective Colonials to matriculate.
The playing field is changing, and by improving the AP policy, GW can improve along with it.

The presence of international students is growing on campus, and while it has gradually climbed to 12 percent, administrators hope to double that number over the next decade.
So the question becomes: What are the best ways to help international students adapt to a new environment and encourage them to get involved in campus life?
This semester, the Center for Student Engagement launched a pilot program that seeks to help international students navigate the student organization fair and learn how to get involved in different organizations on campus. The pilot was successful, and the CSE is looking to expand the program on a wider scale in the fall.
Special programming for international students is crucial, but at some point, it is the student’s responsibility to get involved. Regardless of how much the University or the International Services Office reaches out to individual students, international students have to take the initiative.
Transitions are never easy. But it is easy to feel lost in the first few months of college. As an international student, I was overwhelmed by the college experience my first semester. Initially, I was not very involved in campus clubs and organizations, despite the fact that some of my friends were extremely active. This semester has been different, largely because I chose to get involved in a number of student organizations.
Putting yourself out there is difficult, especially for students who are new to the community and the country. But it’s necessary. Step outside your comfort zone and seek out what interests you. It is the most effective way to make the most out of the college experience.
For most students, college is the place where they figure out what they want to do with their lives. And student clubs and organizations play a central role in that process.
The University works to assist international students academically as well. For example, the summer English for Academic Purposes courses are meant to help non-English speaking students prepare for college-level writing courses such as University Writing and Writing in the Disciplines classes. The English program allows students to get a few credits before they’ve even officially started freshman year.
Whether it is because of a language barrier or a cultural difference, some students may decide to never join a student club or organization. And that’s okay – not every student has to be involved in campus life.
But at the end of the day, the University can only do so much to ensure that international students are involved on campus. The responsibility is on the students.

Fraternity leaders will spend the next few weeks considering how much to overhaul the formal rush process to draw more men into Greek life.
The Interfraternity Council charged chapter presidents Monday with planning changes to GW’s recruitment, officially bringing it in line with national policies that allow chapters to give out bids 365 days a year.
“By opening up bidding, we’re trying to lessen disappointment and increase the number of young new members that are excited to be a part of this community,” Interfraternity Council President Casey Wood said.
Wood said he expects any policy changes to be approved by May – more than a year after the Northeast Greek Leadership Association amended its bylaws to offer year-round recruitment. The organization has granted campus leaders some latitude in determining their recruitment structure.
Chapters have been permitted to offer bids in between recruitment periods since last fall, but several chapter presidents said their understanding of the policy was still hazy. Wood said he expects the most contentious part of the new policy to be whether to scrap formal rush periods.
The Greek community sometimes gets nervous when tradition is challenged, Wood said. While smaller fraternities would more willingly embrace open recruitment, larger fraternities might be warier of the process, he said.
He said he hopes the group will strike a balance between the regional policy and the GW community’s needs.
“No structure is scary,” Wood said.
Beta Theta Pi President Colin O’Brien said he’d like to see GW keep formal recruitment in the fall, but nix the spring process.
Cutting down on events would also cut costs, O’Brien said. He added that allowing IFC’s 17 chapters to hand out bids throughout the year would help members focus on more “meaningful” recruitment.
“This would allow those who are interested in Greek Life from the get-go to jump right in, but would give those who need more convincing the proper avenue for that,” O’Brien said.
The University’s director of Greek life defended the current recruitment model, with twice-yearly events.
“I believe a period of time set aside each semester is helpful to connect potential new members to interested chapters,” Christina Witkowicki, the IFC adviser, said.

The University released an updated interim sexual harassment and sexual violence policy in September. Thanks to thoughtful feedback from the community, the University is considering several changes, including increasing the time period for filing a complaint of sexual harassment against another person.
In addition to enhancing the readability of the policy, clarifying certain sections and better explaining our procedures with the use of flow charts, the final policy will lengthen the time during which an individual can initiate a formal review that often leads to a disciplinary process. This change will replace the 180-day time limit included in the interim policy.
The reason for setting a time limit to file a formal complaint after an incident occurs is to encourage individuals to come forward as soon as possible so we can take action to protect our community while balancing the rights of both parties in resolving claims of sexual assault and other forms of sexual harassment. The policy will permit exceptions, but the window to file a complaint with GW will close when the alleged perpetrator graduates or leaves the school.
We also believe there may be some confusion within the University community about what the time period will apply to. The time period will only apply to the initiation of formal grievance procedures.
To be clear, the University will have no time limit for reporting a sexual assault or any other form of sexual harassment, or accessing any of the support services or resources the University makes available to victims.
The issuance of no-contact orders, changes to academic or housing accommodations and referrals to medical and mental health care providers are examples of the services and resources available, depending on the circumstances. Regardless of whether any person has filed a formal complaint within the prescribed time frame, whenever an incident involving sexual harassment is reported on campus or in connection with a GW program, the University will conduct an inquiry to determine whether any sexual violence or other form of sexual harassment has occurred. And then it will take steps to eliminate any harassment that is found, remedy that harassment and prevent it from recurring.
The University takes seriously its commitment to securing a campus free from harassment, discrimination and violence. We believe the debate that has taken place regarding the interim policy has been useful and constructive and will lead to a policy that treats all members of our community fairly. As we come to the end of the review and comment period, you are strongly encouraged to share your thoughts and feedback on the interim policy by contacting Tara Pereira, Deputy Title IX Coordinator at 202-994-2657 or at Taraw@gwu.edu.
Terri Harris Reed and Tara Pereira are the vice provost for diversity and inclusion and Title IX coordinator, and director of campus inclusion initiatives and deputy Title IX coordinator, respectively.
