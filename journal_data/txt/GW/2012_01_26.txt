GW ranked first among medium-sized schools for producing Peace Corps volunteers, a title it has now held for four consecutive years.
Seventy-eight undergraduate alumni serve in the Peace Corps, an increase from 72 last year. 
The second-place honoree in GW’s bracket, Western Washington University, has 73 alumni serving. American and Cornell Universities were also commended among colleges with undergraduate populations between 5,001 and 15,000 students.
The top-ranked schools in the large and small categories were the University of Colorado Boulder and University of Mary Washington, respectively. 
Peace Corps public affairs specialist Stephen Chapman cited an “emphasis on service” and “curiosity about life outside the United States” as the qualities that most often inspire students to volunteer.
“GW students embody both of those traits,” Chapman said.
Julie Hyman, who graduated in 2010 with a degree in journalism and mass communication, is volunteering with the Peace Corps to create a library in northern Namibia. She lives without electricity on a homestead with a host family, cattle, goats, donkeys and chickens.
“Going to school in D.C. definitely piqued my interest in all things international and allowed me certain internship and job opportunities that fed this interest,” Hyman said.
Hyman added that she was inspired to serve by First Lady Michelle Obama’s University-wide 100,000 hour service challenge, issued before she spoke at commencement last May.
“Students come to GW with a disposition to serve. Many students choose GW because they are interested in making the world a better place through service, policy or community partnerships,” Amy Cohen, executive director of GW’s Center for Civic Engagement and Public Service, said.
Since its founding in 1961, a total of 1,094 alumni have served in the Peace Corps. The program requires a 27-month commitment in any of 76 current host countries.
GW’s long-standing relationship with the organization was celebrated alongside the initiative’s 50th anniversary at an on-campus reception last fall, where Peace Corps director Aaron S. Williams thanked the University for its leadership in producing volunteers.

Drink more water, eat healthier, go to the gym more and study more.
These are just a few of the goals I set for myself this semester. A more extensive list would include further challenging feats, such as sleeping at least seven hours every night and earning straight “A’s.”
After a week and a half of classes, I’m doing fairly well at living up to my goals. But judging from past experience, I know I should expect to see these goals fly out the window in the upcoming weeks.
It seems like everybody comes back to school with newfound gusto after weeks of relaxing over winter break. You feel like you could take on the world and accomplish anything. Living up to goals and having a happy and healthy semester seems like a piece of cake…until it isn’t. After a couple weeks pass and the grind of the semester sets in, resolutions fall by the wayside.
Is there anyone who is actually able to commit and follow through on his or her goals for an entire semester? If such people do exist, I beg them to share their secrets with the rest of us pathetic flakes. In the meantime, I’ll be racking my brain for the answer – that magical solution to complacency.
Maybe the way to be most successful with new semester goals is by accepting that it is impossible to be perfect.
See, if I followed through with all of my goals this semester, I would be a happy, well-rested, straight-A student with a rockin’ bod and plenty of spare time for community service and pleasure reading.
In other words, I would be living a reality practically impossible for college students.
Self-improvement is not an all-or-nothing kind of game. It is easy to think, “I already ate a ton of chips, so why bother going to the gym?” or “I’m not going to get a good grade anyway, so why not go out instead of study?” But just because you fall through on one goal or momentarily slip up, doesn’t mean you should lose sight of them altogether.
I am not suggesting we should let our goals fall by the wayside, because setting standards and expectations helps us improve who we are. All I am suggesting is this: We shouldn’t lose all hope just because we can’t live up to the lofty and unrealistic expectations we set.
So this semester, rather than kicking yourself because you don’t get straight “A’s,” keep the image you have created of the “perfect you” and try a little bit every day to become more like that person.

Few things are more invigorating than a fiery political debate between two GW students.
On this politically charged campus, conversations – and sometimes, screaming matches – about controversial issues are ubiquitous. While such intellectual interactions might be worthwhile, these conversations have an inherent problem. They are often so abstract that they become more like hyperbolic boxing matches in which each debater is overly motivated to win the argument, rather than exchanges of ideas.
I am guilty of enjoying such debates with friends about everything from the need for a government mandate for health insurance to the justification for higher marginal tax rates on the wealthiest Americans. But my trip to Israel with GW Hillel over winter break served as a necessary wake-up call for me. Political debates, I realized, should be about actual people and the implications of policy on their lives.
We debate politics, war and peace because we want to flex our own persuasive muscles, but too often these duels never go anywhere. Now I see why: Students rarely focus on the units affected by the issues they discuss. We should not debate in the abstract, but rather with a focus on the impact that the issues or policies we are discussing has on individuals’ livelihoods.
The University is preparing to enter an even more debate-laden era; an election year is just beginning, and the political debate series has been established. At this time, we’re all going to find ourselves talking the issues whether we want to or not, wearing our political affiliations like badges and using our extensive knowledge of given topics like weapons.
Prior to my trip, I engaged in dialogues with friends and peers about Middle East politics in wonky, political terms. We would argue about armistice lines and whether the Democrats or Republicans were more pro-Israel.
But my travels led me to view the conflict on a local, humane level. My conversations with Israelis allowed me to see beyond the politics and understand how tensions in the region impacted their daily lives.
But now that I am back to the GW bubble, it is tempting to revert to old tendencies of trying to out-duel peers and feel a sense of pride from beating them in debate. But I am mindful that, while it may be important to talk about such topics on campus, it would be wise to take a deep breath and not feel the need to triumph over someone else’s position merely because it is self-satisfying to do so.
This is not to say that every debate we have is to boost our egos. In fact, many student organizations – including those dedicated to Middle Eastern peace – have very productive dialogues attempting to foster mutual understanding of beliefs. I admire their efforts to better educate themselves and the community about different viewpoints.
But too often, such forums become contests for who can raise their voices the loudest or make the other side look the most foolish. Such debates would be more useful if participants were less concerned with trying to out-perform one another and instead were more willing to genuinely listen to the other side and ask questions to better understand his or her position.
By all means, debate health care until you are ready to pull your hair out. Stay up all night discussing a two-state solution. But do not forget that at the root of the politics and policy is something as personal as a woman’s access and ability to pay for a mammogram, or an Israeli family’s fear of not seeing their children come home because of indiscriminate bombings.

The University unveiled a new plan to create a smarter and more effective alcohol policy for graduate and undergraduate students last week, an overhaul to be commended for its innovative and student-oriented roots.
Spearheaded by Assistant Dean of Students Tara Pereira, the revamp includes potential goals, such as altering Responsible Alcohol Management guidelines for law students, revising the “reasonable person” standard for student organizations and allowing cumbersome paperwork to be submitted online.
What is most encouraging about these changes, along with other recent overhauls Pereira has overseen this year, is the manner in which these reforms have been accomplished.
Pereira, with the support of Dean of Students Peter Konwerski, started and framed these reforms based on feedback from students. Not just Student Association leaders, but average students who otherwise would have gone unheard in the University’s bureaucracy.
This model of frank and direct conversation with students is laudable, and it should serve as an example of how the University must approach its students and its reforms.
Without hearing individual testimony and responses from students, Pereira said she would not have been able to grasp critical complaints and concerns about certain alcohol, drug and judicial policies.
Pereira not only reached out to large and prominent student leaders and organizations; she also made attempts to communicate and connect with ordinary students. By doing this, she was able to obtain a comprehensive view of student complaints and concerns.
Konwerski should also be recognized for not only allowing Pereira to carry out her vision, but also for supporting this crucial type of student-administrator interaction.
This appears to be a shift from previous administrative policies in the Dean of Students office, as Pereira has finally been encouraged and allowed to engage with students after Konwerski assumed his post in May 2010.
This form of communication can be seen in other student-life initiatives across campus. In particular, the new Center for Student Engagement is seeking to work directly with individual students in an exciting manner. Director of the CSE, Tim Miller, and his staff have been interacting with students on a personal level by touring dorms.
While each department in the University is distinct, administrators dealing with students or student issues should heed these models of effective outreach.
High-level administrators should always be sure to allow their staff to fully engage with students to receive the most informative portrait of students’ views on any pertinent issues.
But what these open lines of communication with students represent is the willingness of administrators to be truly innovative.
And in GW’s criticism shy administration, it is refreshing to see high-level administrators take risks that could have earned GW bad press, and pursue those ideas anyway, because it was what was best for students. Each staffer, employee or administrator who has an idea to better student life should be allowed to explore and push for new programs, even if it ends in failure, as the main goal of the University should always be making its student body feel educated, safe and satisfied with their time at GW.
Increased outreach is essential at a University that students often criticize for having a vast web of bureaucracy. By working with students on important issues that will affect their campus experience, opening networks of communication will clearly serve to benefit both students and administration.
More effective policies and plans will be formulated, and students will feel that they have more of an active stake in their University.

If you haven’t already noticed, Student Association elections are just around the corner. Letters about the Joint Elections Committee’s newly proposed goals dominate The Hatchet’s opinions section, while the news section contains juicy SA gossip like the apparent clash between the president and the SA Senate.
Last week, the chair of the JEC, Phil Gardner, reported there is typically a 20-percent voter-participation rate at GW. Because of this staggeringly low statistic, I commend the JEC’s new goal to “get out the vote.” Encouraging voter participation is essential in a democratic system of governance.
That said, I think the other new goal – to put less emphasis on rule violations – is a mistake.
Elections will always be unfair without solid law enforcement. The rules need to be enforced, because students who choose campaign managers, attend endorsement interviews, dig dirt up on their competitors and violate campaign rules dominate the Student Association presidential field. In other words, the field is made up of students who take winning the election too seriously.
Until the campaign field presents ordinary alternatives to student-elitists in the election who are just running to play politics, the Joint Elections Committee must sternly enforce the rules. Indeed, the only reason the JEC exists at all is because these elections attract aspiring politicians.
If the JEC de-emphasizes rule enforcement, it will underpin the reason 80 percent of students don’t vote to begin with: They detest the candidate pool.
Here’s the good news: We can change that pattern, because almost anyone can run for SA president. All someone needs is a passion to better our school. I was a candidate last year, but I didn’t fit the fraternity-backed “career politician” mold. I was a student seeking the attention of other students who couldn’t care less about the people in student government who don’t care about students in the first place.
The Hatchet’s endorsement for SA president described me as having a “blatant lack of knowledge…regarding how the University operates.” That may have been correct, but how much does that even matter?
You see, I don’t even know what the phrase “how the University operates” means. Are there some top-secret methods GW administrators use to make major decisions? Do they not discuss, debate and decide like everyone else? Is that not how normal institutions work? Is that not how we all operate in our everyday lives?
Elections will be what we make them. Give us someone to vote for, and we in the 80 percent might just show up.

When uprisings began steamrolling through Arab countries about one year ago, revolutionaries saw the opportunity to transform the region’s politics and society.
But the excitement from Tahrir Square has reverberated halfway around the world to create another kind of opportunity for policy experts and scholars studying the region: to re-engage students and the public in Middle Eastern affairs.
“If you go back a couple years [before the Arab Spring], there was a certain sense of repetition – boredom – the same issues being discussed again and again and again,” Marc Lynch, associate professor of political science and international affairs and director of GW’s Institute for Middle East Studies, said. “Now there is a wider range of issues that people care about. They actually care about Tunisian domestic politics.”
Since the first spark of reform hit Tunisia in December 2010 and surged into Egypt last January, Lynch said he noticed a mobilization of related programs like the Project on Middle East Political Science – housed at GW and funded by a recent $2 million Carnegie Corporation grant – and his popular blog on ForeignPolicy.com.
His website traffic skyrocketed, media requests flurried, event crowds overflowed and the White House called him for policy advice.
All of the attention, Lynch said, gave him and his colleagues a platform to educate, and was a springboard for true experts to have a voice.
“Too often the public debate about the Middle East has been poorly served,” he said. “For a lot of the war on terror after 9/11, people who know nothing about Islam or about the region – have never lived there, don’t speak the language – were treated as experts. I think that had a really distorting effect about how Americans and American policy understood what’s going on.”
Policy experts were caught off guard by the rapid toppling of revolutionary dominoes, but they quickly looked to academics to track down trends in communication and culture that stirred the uprisings. Now, those academics are putting more pieces together – from the cause of continued bloodshed in Syria to the Muslim Brotherhood-backed party’s recent victories in Egyptian parliamentary elections.
Lynch’s book “The Arab Uprising,” set to be released March 27, will also try to add a unique stamp to the Middle East buzz, which has yet to spawn comprehensive books on the topic. The book will focus on the interconnectedness of the region and what consequences the last year of unrest will hold.
“The questions that non-specialists and specialists are asking are, for once, not that different: ‘Why is this happening now?,’ ‘What are likely outcomes?,’” international affairs and political science professor Nathan Brown, who also works in the Institute for Middle East Studies, said.
Brown said he has been surprised by the support American students have demonstrated since the Arab Spring, as revolutionary images captivated the classroom and the country. A survey by Hart Associates last April showed that 73 percent of college students in the U.S. were following the Arab uprisings.
“This is the first time in my lifetime that a group of Middle Easterners demonstrating are seen to be the good guys in many Americans’ eyes,” Brown said.
The Arab Spring has also emphasized the Elliott School of International Affairs’ strength in Middle East studies, Lynch said. The school was listed as the ninth-best undergraduate international relations program in the country by researchers at the College of William and Mary Jan. 3, which cited the school’s number of experts in the region.
Sophomore international affairs major Marielle Velander is taking Lynch’s Middle East survey class this semester – the first undergraduate course he has taught since the Arab Spring began.
“You get a sense that all eyes are turned on the Middle East and, by focusing on the Middle East, you’re able to understand what is going on in the news. I’ll feel like I understand it on a deeper level,” she said.
As questions linger, Lynch hopes to use the uncertainty as a learning tool, leaving his syllabus open for the potential of breaking news in the region.
“People can tell that they’re living through world historical times,” Lynch said. “It’s nice that you don’t know how it ends.”

The Hamilton’s slogan is “Eat, Drink, Listen.” And the newly opened, refined, yet chic jazz house is the perfect place to do just that.
The five-week-old club never closes; offering breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner and late-night options all under one roof – a rarity in the District.
And this late-night food oasis has the best after-midnight menu I’ve ever seen.
From midnight to 6 a.m. hungry night owls can dine on sliders with grilled onions, pickles and American cheese ($12), milkshakes ($7), chicken and biscuits ($15) and “The Big Hot Weiner,” ($8) a hot dog slathered with chili, mustard and onions.
Our waitress told us that the restaurant, a member of the larger, well-established Clyde’s Restaurant Group, has been busier than expected for late-night dining, especially on weekends.
The restaurant layout also offers maximum entertainment value. The main floor of the restaurant seats 800 people and has two bars. The dining rooms are furnished with leather booths and wood paneling, accented with paintings and statues of birds everywhere. It sounds odd, but somehow it works to give The Hamilton an old-fashioned charm.  And while our party was, at first, a bit skeptical about the fowl-themed paintings and bronze statues, but we were more than won over by the food.
There is also an extremely unique concert space on the first floor. The famous gospel singer Mavis Staples – the same singer who wowed folk legend Bob Dylan and even rejected his marriage proposal – already graced the stage Jan. 19. Later this month local blues band The Tommyhawks are scheduled to perform Jan. 27, as well as unique folk-pop-rock group The Dreamscapes Project Jan. 28 and big-band group The Natty Beaux Feb. 2.
Our three-person party started with the District Wings ($7), which have a mumbo sweet-and-sour sauce and come with delicious fries, the Maitake Tempura ($6), the Fire Cracker sushi rolls ($12) and spicy tuna rolls ($6). We followed our appetizers with the filet mignon ($19 5 oz./$25 8oz.) on the waitress’ recommendation, the Grass-Fed Piedmont Ridge Farm Beef Hamburger ($10) and the jumbo lump crab cakes ($17 single/$26 double).
Everything received rave reviews and we almost didn’t have room for dessert, but we opted to share the Chocolate St. Louis Gooey Cake ($8), which is a chocolate lover’s dream.
The dessert list has 12 items, including The Hamilton Split ($17), a banana split with candied bacon, and even a dessert beer. Keeping to the local, homemade theme, the restaurant even has its own Hamilton-blend coffee. Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable, although it did seem that the entire staff was still getting used to maneuvering the 37,000 square-foot restaurant.
In total, the restaurant was a $24 million investment, our waitress explained. She also explained that the establishment prides itself on small craft drinks, local, grass-fed beef from Piedmont Ridge Farm in Maryland, organic pinot grigio, all natural, humanely raised meat and poultry, local draught beers and even Sidea water, which is made through an environmentally friendly Naturizzata purification system S.I.D.E.A. Italia – it tastes much better than regular tap water and is free.
With four bars, an awesome concert venue, three chefs, delicious food and a great drink list, not to mention the location and hours, I will definitely return to The Hamilton very soon.
The Hamilton is located at 600 14th St., NW.
