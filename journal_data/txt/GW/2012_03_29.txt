The D.C. Council is holding public hearings for the next month to review a budget proposal released by Mayor Vincent Gray last week.
The budget for fiscal year 2013 comes in at $11.3 billion and looks to close a $171.2 million budget shortfall through extended hours for alcohol sales and stricter enforcement of traffic regulations.
Gray said in testimony Tuesday to the D.C. Council that the budget’s theme is “seizing our future.”
“It is with that goal in mind that this budget makes many key investments to ensure all District residents are able to fully participate in the new economy that we are building for the District,” he said in council testimony.
The budget proposes an extension of hours for alcohol sales at bars and nightclubs by one hour, leaving them open until 3 a.m. on weekdays and 4 a.m. on weekends. Liquor stores could also open an hour earlier, at 7 a.m.
Last fiscal year’s budget also looked to alcohol for more cash flow, increasing the tax on liquor from 9 to 10 percent and extending sale hours until midnight Mondays through Saturdays. It also made it legal for bars and eateries to open their taps Sundays at 8 a.m. – two hours earlier than before.
During the next two presidential inaugurations, the budget calls for bars to get a green light to stay open until 4 a.m.
D.C.’s streetcar project that will span all eight wards would see an additional $2.8 million from Gray’s budget to push the launch of the line down H Street and Benning Road.
Plans for the 37-mile network began in 1997 with a public transit strategy study by the District Department of Transportation that pointed to streetcars as a way to alleviate congestion in public transportation options.
District taxis would also see upgrades under Gray’s proposed budget, including offering customers the ability to pay with credit cards and give all cabs a uniform color.
The budget slashes $23 million from the D.C. HealthCare Alliance program, which aids individuals ineligible for Medicaid.
DC Fiscal Policy Institute budget analyst Elissa Silverman said the mayor’s budget reflects an even-handed approach that weighs revenue and cuts, adding that the council would have difficulty making overarching changes to the proposal, because it must maintain a balanced budget.
“Expenditures have to equal revenue, so we often see a lot of small changes,” she said.  “It’s hard to make really big changes because they would have to find the revenue to replace it.”
The budget will face public hearings through late April before undergoing revisions in May during the council’s mark-up phase. The D.C. Council will take a final vote on the bill June 5, passing it along to Congress for approval.
Ward 2 D.C. Council member Jack Evans said he has concerns with parts of the budget proposal, including the plan to raise $24.8 million from increased speeding and red light ticket cameras.
“I disagree philosophically with this nickel-and-dime approach to balancing the budget,” Evans, who chairs the council’s finance committee, said.
Gray also included a “revised revenue priority list,” if the city were to collect more revenue than projected, including extra money for homeless services and restoration of health care funds that were cut in the proposal.
“Mayor Gray is hoping there will be sort of a windfall of dollars that will come over the years that will help him fund more programs,” Silverman said. “I’d say this budget bets on good times ahead.”

When John Soriano took AP economics during his senior year of high school in 2008, a busted economy made for a booming curiosity.
Amid the fallout of the financial crisis, the junior opted to pursue a degree in economics – a move his classmates are increasingly choosing as the department has seen a 100 percent increase in majors since 2007.
“It seemed like the most relevant issue in the world for me,” Soriano said. “You could turn on CNN or any news and see what was happening that day and then talk about it in class.”
Soriano is one of 378 students majoring in economics this year – a 10 percent bump from last year. He says the major has a dose of practicality mixed with versatility.
After the recession of 2008 hit the nation hard, people scrambled to make sense of the crisis, drawing more students to the field, economics department chair Barry Chiswick said.
“When there are problems in the economy, it makes the front page of the newspapers,” Chiswick said. “There’s more interest in learning about what’s going on in the economy. So we’ve done some things that have made taking courses in economics more attractive.”
The department has looked to answer the demand from students for economic knowledge by ramping up rigor, including more mathematics in the curriculum this year and bringing real-world applications to the classroom, like the addition of a health care economics course this summer.
Professors have also looked to highlight the stable job prospects that an economics degree can deliver in areas like consulting, financial analysis and accountancy, Anthony Yezer, an economics professor, said.
“I always tell the students that one reason to study economics is they don’t want to live with their parents,” Yezer said, citing the field’s ability to advance critical thinking and math abilities.
Universities across the country have likewise seen a rise in economics majors. While total undergraduate degrees have jumped by 11 percent since 2007, the number of students majoring in economics has risen 18 percent, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.
This financial crisis has piqued students’ interest in the economy more than others because the significance of the housing crisis, Steve Cobb, the director of the Center for Economic Education at the University of North Texas, said.
“I think this all fits together in that when there’s a downturn in the economy, particularly one in this case that had the housing and the banking aspect to it, it just increases the focus on the economics,” Cobb said.
As student interest is growing, the size of the economics department has fallen slightly over the last five years due to a combination of retirements and funding shifts, deputy department head Bryan Boulier said.
After carrying 26 full-time professors this year – three fewer than in 2007 – the department hired five professors to start in the fall for subjects like development economics and international trade. With the new hires, who earned their doctorates at schools like the University of Chicago and the London School of Economics, the department will be back up to pre-recession faculty levels.
The total number of professors in the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences, which houses the economics department, has risen slightly over the same period. Roy Guenther, Columbian College’s executive associate dean, said requests for faculty searches are part of three- to five-year “strategic projections.”
To fit in more students, Boulier said the department has raised the enrollment cap level in intermediate and advanced classes. The department has also hired more adjuncts, he said.
“We cannot always accommodate student demand, so that students might have to wait until a subsequent semester if they are closed out of a particular course,” Boulier said. “However, we do work pretty hard for seniors to make sure they can get in all the courses that are required to graduate on time.”
The diversity of courses Soriano hopes to squeeze in for graduation, like the economics of crime and law, has also boosted the field’s appeal, he said. He added that amid a turbulent job market, an economics degree seemed most sensible.
“Economics can come down to weighing the costs and benefits of things,” he said. “[It’s about] making rational decisions.”
This post was updated on March 29, 2012 to reflect the following:
The Hatchet incorrectly reported that the economics department had seen about a 50 percent increase since 2007. In fact, enrollment has increased by about 100 percent since that year.

The University’s admissions were stagnant this spring, in a year when comparable universities saw an increase in selectivity.
About 33 percent of applicants were admitted during the three cycles of GW admission for the Class of 2016, a trend identical to last spring.
The admissions office admitted 7,105 applicants from a pool of 21,700, the University admissions office announced Wednesday.
Last year, the University accepted 7,022 students from the original application pool of about 21,497 – an acceptance rate of 32.6 percent.  Thirty-three percent of those students eventually submitted deposits to the University, which was 4 percent lower than the number of deposits for the Class of 2014.
Identical to last year’s goal, the University anticipates a freshman class of 2,350.
Both Boston and Northwestern Universities accepted about 3 percent fewer applicants this year.
GW, BU and Northwestern all saw varying degrees of growth in the number of applicants. GW received 200 more applications this year while BU and Northwestern both saw growth of more than 1,000.
Editor of Inside Higher Ed Scott Jaschik said the dip in selectivity is relatively insignificant.
“These trends are long-term, not short-term,” Jaschik said. “Admitting 1 percent more students just isn’t a big deal – especially if those admitted are equally strong candidates.”
Jaschik also said the schools reporting their numbers now are the ones that have the most flattering percentages.
“If you are a competitive college and you are proud of your admit rate, you issue a press release right away and shout it to the world. And this is the time of year you hear that shouting,” Jaschik said.
Associate Vice President and Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Kathryn Napper declined to comment on the percentage of students accepted, but said in an e-mail that she is excited to see the impact the incoming freshmen would have.
“Each year, our freshmen come with their own set of experiences and world events that shape the personality of the class.  I look forward to seeing how the class of 2016 will make their mark on the GW community,” Napper said.

Earlier this year, the community learned that cases of academic dishonesty have risen by 10 percent since 2005, a problem that should concern everyone at an institution of higher learning.
One reason for this trend appears to be the rate at which international students are found to cheat and plagiarize. This group accounted for almost 25 percent of all academic dishonesty cases last year.
The Hatchet’s editorial board previously called for a more standardized approach in dealing with issues of plagiarism and academic dishonesty, and the University should take this opportunity to implement such a tactic in dealing with this trend of international students cheating.
While the Office of Academic Integrity already partners with the International Services Office during fall and spring orientations to discuss academic dishonesty, the office should be given more freedom to continue these steps of preventative outreach.
And given that many international students might not have been taught the same guidelines as American students regarding academic dishonesty before they came to GW, a model that strongly hinges on preventative outreach is critical.
A stronger partnership with the language center and the professors teaching English for academic purposes courses would go a long way in directly working with students whose first language is not English.
Peer educators from the Office of Academic Integrity could be required to directly speak with international students in English for academic purposes courses about what constitutes cheating and the consequences of academic dishonesty.
And professors who teach these courses should be further encouraged to have standardized discussions about issues of academic dishonesty before major assignments, as well as explanations regarding their specific definitions and rules for  and academic dishonesty.
This opportunity to focus on preventative outreach for international students will hopefully serve as a model that can be used when dealing with the general student population.

The National Institutes of Health is clamping down on professors involved with health research across the country.
New mandates such as lowering the financial disclosure threshold from $10,000 to $5,000, revealing sponsored travel, providing online training for professors and creating a public-access database of conflict-of-interest cases will soon be in effect for research institutions.
The University will also look to review its entire conflict-of-interest policy this fall, opening up the opportunity for the implementation of increased safeguards and stricter policies for faculty involved in research.
The new NIH guidelines demonstrate the significance of a transparent and detailed policy regarding conflict of interest, an approach that should be applied to those professors who have industry or corporate research partnerships.
As the University continues to promote and foster connections between industry and faculty, any review of the conflict-of-interest policy should take into acount this enhanced partnership with the private sector.
The University could implement a stricter definition of what it means to have a significant financial interest. The current threshold for disclosing an interest is either $10,000 or 5 percent ownership depending on whichever is lower. This interest should be lowered to the NIH standard of $5,000.
As of now, faculty are required to report any compensation or income related with an outside entity that exceeds $10,000 over the past 12 months. Not only could this threshold be lowered, but expanding this rule to 24 months or longer would allow the University to gain a better perspective of any involvement by a faculty member over a period of time.
Any major conflict-of-interest incident would be embarrassing and would significantly hurt industry-backed research endeavors at a time when the University is just beginning to intensify its efforts. Implementing specific preemptive measures regarding faculty-industry partnerships is a crucial step for the future of research at the institution.

With growing strains on family and university spending, study abroad offices are under increased pressure to prove the value of their programs.
Study abroad offices across the country are prioritizing surveys and anecdotal reports from participants to demonstrate the academic and social advantages of international learning and to justify its expenses.
“For a long time, people just believed that study abroad worked, without really stepping back to try to measure its impact,” Karin Fischer, a senior reporter for The Chronicle of Higher Education, said. “But there’s growing outside pressure to ascertain if it really does produce the outcomes its advocates say it does.”
The heightened importance of bringing transparency to participants’ assessments – the focus of a national study abroad conference last Wednesday – comes after a December 2011 report by researchers from Forum on Education Abroad questioned the conventional wisdom that overseas experiences strengthen intercultural knowledge. As universities nationwide underscored studying abroad as a prerequisite for employment in a global economy, students with greater cultural competency are in demand, the authors of that report stressed that cultural take-aways vary greatly with each program.
Mark Salisbury, one of the co-authors and a speaker at the conference, said in an interview that many university administrators across the country are increasingly using assessments to determine funding from universities for study abroad programs, making sure “the institution meets certain standards of practice, organization, and fiscal responsibility.”
Salisbury said that colleges have long collected anecdotal evidence about students’ experiences by talking about what the students learned from their programs. He said that assessment must now compile data that can more clearly demonstrate what a program offers, based on student feedback.
“If done right, assessment can be an incredibly valuable means of designing and improving study abroad programs,” Salisbury said.
To measure the success of GW study abroad programs, Robert Hallworth, the director of the Office for Study Abroad, said surveys are conducted both before and after students go abroad.
He said the surveys, created with colleagues from Graduate School of Education and Human Development, gauge learning outcomes from cultural self-awareness to worldview frameworks and openness.
His office also uses focus groups with returning students to gauge “what they’re learning, how they’re learning and what we can do to help better prepare students to live and learn abroad,” Hallworth said.
“Aside from the academic gains from taking courses abroad, we believe that study abroad helps broaden a student’s perspective and increases their ability to deal with new surroundings and adapt to challenging situations,” Hallworth said.
Salisbury said many study abroad offices are still learning how best to evaluate student learning in their programs, and “there still aren’t a set of surveys that could be considered a gold standard.”
Study-abroad rates at GW have been steadily increasing over the last decade, hitting a peak in 2007, when 1,651 students left the University for at least one semester.

Are the humanities dead?
That is the question many students who major in English, history, philosophy or the arts face from skeptics of a humanities education as they prepare to enter the workforce.
Doubters of the humanities question how classes that teach students about long-deceased philosophers or authors could possibly impart the practical knowledge or skills needed for the modern economy.
A humanities education is critical in the 21st century and provides students invaluable skills for the workforce and beyond.
The job market has not been kind to humanities majors, though, as the work force today increasingly seeks graduates of fields that appear to be most practical in the future: science, technology, business or health care.
Just more than 45 percent of recent humanities graduates are employed in jobs that require a college degree, and humanities majors have higher unemployment rates than those recent graduates who majored in computers and math, engineering and business, according to a report by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce.
All of this is just proof positive for skeptics of the humanities.
And maybe rightfully so. With those numbers, it seems that history majors better start making plans to move back in with their parents. Or perhaps just prepare to sleep an engineering major friend’s couch.
The Gates-Jobs Dichotomy
So does this mean reading and studying “Crime and Punishment” by Fyodor Dostoyevsky is useless? Has Plato overstayed his welcome in college classrooms?
Two of the country’s most prominent visionaries – and college drop-outs – have weighed in on this issue.
Bill Gates, chairman and co-founder of Microsoft, promotes education with a career purpose. In February 2011, Gates argued at a National Governor’s Association meeting that there is no point in investing in areas of higher education that are, he said, “not that well-correlated to the areas that actually create jobs.”
Under Gates’ manifesto, philosophy and English classes would likely be the first to be eliminated.
But this line of thinking promoted by Gates and others fails to capture the importance and essence of the humanities.
Studying the humanities equips students with a variety of lifelong skills, such as critical thinking, creativity or analysis that are inherently dynamic and transferable to many different employment fields, a belief held by the late Steve Jobs, co-founder and chief executive officer of Apple Inc.
In March 2011, Jobs said at the iPad 2 unveiling that, “It’s in Apple’s DNA that technology alone is not enough. It’s technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the results that make our heart sing.”
And those who will be hiring graduates agree with Jobs.
A 2009 survey commissioned by the American Association of Colleges and Universities found that 59 percent of employers believe the key to career success is not just in-depth skills in a particular field, but also a wide range of knowledge that a humanities education provides.
Companies and employers will look for someone who is a strong writer, or who excels at thinking critically and creatively. And a humanities education can provide that.
Same subject, new approach 
So Plato and Dostoyevsky still belong in the classroom. But that doesn’t mean they cannot be taught differently than they were in the past.
And with this changing and internationally competitive economy, the humanities can be combined with skills-based curriculum and courses to best demonstrate that.
The University must ask itself how the existing framework of a humanities education can be used to teach students the practical skills and knowledge they will face when they graduate as well.
One way to do this is to use the humanities as a basis for interdisciplinary studies.
At Stanford University, a report released in January called upon the university to revamp its undergraduate education by exposing students to a core curriculum along with a wide variety of skills.
Stanford’s “Thinking Matters” courses are similar to changes the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences made with the creation of new GPAC requirements, which seek to expose students to a variety of skill-developing courses ranging from critical thinking to quantitative reasoning.
And while these changes in CCAS did include some new courses, Stanford also took its approach one step further by creating new courses that truly connect the humanities with practical skills and knowledge.
Take for example “Social Animals, Social Revolutions, Social Networks,” a Stanford course taught by three professors from different departments: French, biology and computer science. The class examines how individuals organized themselves and communicated their messages before Twitter and Facebook, comparing and contrasting how social networks are created and influence society. A student taking this class will be able to apply humanities-based skills such as historical analysis to modern technology and communications issues.
As GW continues to contemplate how interdisciplinary studies will be part of the future of academics, it should ensure that humanities majors can blend an old text with today’s issues.
One way to do this is to expand classes that are taught by multiple professors, as it allows students to be exposed to a wide breadth of knowledge. Professors can combine their expertise to provide humanities majors a more expansive education.
But just like how the humanities force students to think critically and creatively, so must the University when devising a curriculum going forward.
Connect a standard art history class with digital design or online portfolios. Use the classic novel “Catch-22” to teach students about moving through a web of bureaucracy in a modern day business or institution. Maybe even connect the psychological and mental trials and tribulations of Raskolnikov in “Crime and Punishment” to new advances in science about the brain and mind.
Connecting a humanities education to career-oriented fields would only enhance the traditional university education. Surely not every single class would need to be delivered in this way but taking the next step with the humanities is critical to providing students a well-rounded and comprehensive classroom experience.
And now is the time to start asking these questions as the University begins to consider the value of interdisciplinary studies, or even the purpose of having a core curriculum in the new strategic plan.
And while some of these changes might seem unrealistic or even scary, they represent an exciting future for academics at the institution.
But it is not only the content of a course that matters, but also how students actually learn and wrestle with the material they are taught.
At Eastern Michigan University, professor Mark Higbee teaches a history class using the teaching method “reacting to the past,” which uses interactive games to help students learn. In his class on Frederick Douglass, students argue the viewpoint of different historical figures regarding slavery at the time. As they debate, students actively develop skills such as critical thinking, persuasion and analysis, which are all applicable to a wide range of careers and professions.
By delivering a standard history or philosophy lecture where students wrestle with the knowledge they are provided, a professor can see whether or not students can actually use and implement the information or skills they supposedly gained by taking a class.
Teaching active courses like this will help to ensure that humanities students can transfer the information they learn in class to a wide variety of settings in the workforce. And in the fast-paced global economy, graduates will need to have a variety of skills that are easily applicable.
The basic skills of argumentation, critical thinking and analysis are already built into philosophy, history and English courses. All it takes is shifting the curriculum to meet new demands.
Maybe the humanities aren’t dead, after all.

High school students are mulling over their college options right now, asking themselves, should I go to a public or private university? Is it better to be far from home or stay nearby? Do I want to attend a big or small school?
But there is another question that often goes overlooked. Is college worth it at all?
Hendrix College dropout and UnCollege founder Dale Stephens says no.
After dropping out of college his freshman year, Stephens received a $100,000 Thiel Fellowship to start UnCollege.org, a website that enables students to pursue their own intellectual interests without ever stepping foot inside a classroom.
The main problem with higher education, he said, is that students are all too willing to be told what to study and learn when they should be taking charge of their own educational interests.
Stephens’ assessment of college is a gross over-simplification of a complicated field. He doesn’t seem to realize that by going to class, doing reading and assignments and participating in class discussions, students are in fact taking charge of their educations.
“People like being told what to do, and the sad fact is the real world doesn’t work like that,” Stephens said.
“At work you might be given a deadline, you may be given a project, but you as an individual, as an employee, have to figure out how to break that project down into smaller steps,” he said. “And in school, often you’re told exactly how to do that.”
I remember my first week at GW. I was terrified of how much freedom I was given.
Unlike what Stephens says, there was no one in college to tell me “exactly how to” do anything. There was no one looking over my shoulder. Teachers, for the most part, didn’t care whether I came to class. There was no set time for lunch or extracurricular activities. I was left to live my day as I saw fit.
Students who participate in self-guided education like UnCollege are more often than not so focused on one subject, such as computer science or creative writing, that they lack exposure to other academic areas.
One of the features that makes an undergraduate education so robust is that students gain exposure to a broad-based education. Sure, you majored in chemistry, but you also have a background in history. By choosing not to go to college, you limit yourself to a select field of study when you could be exploring a variety of intellectual options.
There are plenty of reasons to criticize college today. Call foul on the rising cost of tuition. Speak out about skyrocketing student debt. If you think like Rick Santorum, blame colleges for being “indoctrination mills.”
But to dismiss college altogether is short-sighted. The country is bursting with four-year colleges, each with its own philosophy, student body and culture. So if the school where you matriculated isn’t a perfect fit, then you should probably transfer.
I’m reminded of a line in Herman Melville’s Moby Dick where Ishmael muses, “a whale ship was my Yale College and my Harvard.”
Melville didn’t need a college, or even a high school, degree to write his masterpiece, after all. But for most, the college experience is an opportunity for self-discovery and a place to explore and grow.
So, Stephens, before you tell us college isn’t the right solution, maybe you should try out a few others. You might just not have found the right fit.
