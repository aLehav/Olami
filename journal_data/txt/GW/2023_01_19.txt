The letter encourages officials to redirect the funds D.C. spends on street parking upkeep toward improving nonvehicular transportation in the District, like incentives for biking and walking.
Representatives of local governing bodies across the District are calling on D.C. government officials for a “renewed focus” on equitable public transportation and increased support for Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners that extends beyond government-issued parking passes.
As of Friday, more than 75 ANC commissioners cosigned a letter requesting officials incentivize and allocate more funds toward public transportation and traffic safety infrastructure in Wards 5, 7 and 8, where many residents rely on noncar transit and are subject to higher rates of traffic fatalities and public health effects like asthma, the letter states. Commissioners are also calling for increased support for ANCs, including adding office space, printing services and a stipend or salary after commissioners who signed the letter said the parking passes that D.C. provides upon their election reinforce existing transportation disparities.
The letter states at least 67 commissioners rejected their passes for the 2023-25 term.
Commissioners addressed the letter to Ward 6 Council member and Committee on Transportation and the Environment chair Charles Allen, At-Large Council member and Housing Committee chair Robert White and Executive Director of the Office of ANC Kent Boese. Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners Yannik Omictin of single-member district 2A01, Trupti Patel of 2A03 and Jordan Nassar of 2A08 have signed in support as of Friday.
“We call on the D.C. government, including the D.C. Council’s Committee on Transportation and the Environment, to meaningfully prioritize equity in public transportation and traffic safety infrastructure, centering those most impacted by our city’s inequities,” the letter states.
The letter encourages officials to redirect the funds D.C. spends on street parking upkeep – which they said totals about $1,750 to build and another $450 to maintain annually – toward improving nonvehicular transportation in the District, like incentives for biking and walking and Metro subsidies proposed in the Metro for D.C. Amendment Act of 2021.
The act, which awaits D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser’s signature, currently allocates $10 million per year to improve transit access or service in “historically underserved communities,” but the letter states that amount is not enough to execute its mission.
“We know ten million dollars will not go far in addressing public transportation and traffic safety infrastructure, and more money is likely necessary to meet the need,” the letter states.
The letter also encouraged commissioners from Wards 5, 7 and 8 to form a group that assists the D.C. Council transportation committee in its policy-making and budget work, including the Metro Amendment Act’s implementation. The letter states the D.C. government’s issuance of parking passes to commissioners is a “deflection” of their real governing needs that reinforces inequities in D.C. because commissioners in “transit-starved” neighborhoods are forced to rely on the parking pass, while those from neighborhoods with more public transit access can more easily ignore using the pass.
Some commissioners rejected using their passes in the 2019 and 2021 terms. The letter proposes bolstering “equivalent incentives” to commissioners who ride Metro, bike and walk instead of spending the funds on passes.
“The D.C. government, including the D.C. Council’s Committee on Housing and the Office of Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, should holistically assess the money it is willing to provide to support Commissions and whether ‘free’ parking is where that money should go,” the letter states.

It was devastating to find out that being who I am meant I couldn’t experience studying abroad to the fullest extent.

Officials said they will periodically close each Media and Public Affairs building floor in the coming months for active construction.
Officials said they will close the fourth floor of the Media and Public Affairs building Monday for nearly two weeks of heating, ventilation and air conditioning upgrades.
Baxter Goodly, senior associate vice president of facilities planning, construction and management, said the fourth floor will be closed from Jan. 23 to Feb. 6 while officials replace HVAC vents in offices and hallways and install new controls in the building’s ceilings. He added that officials will periodically close each floor of the building in the coming months for active construction.
“Crews are taking down the ceiling tiles, removing the old equipment, installing the new high-performance vents and controls, reinstalling the ceilings and then cleaning up any construction debris,” Goodly said in an email. “This work cannot be safely completed in an occupied space.”
Goodly said officials will close the first floor and Jack Morton Auditorium of MPA during the first part of the summer session when no events or classes are scheduled for renovations. He said officials will conduct repair and replacement work in classrooms during spring break.
“Accommodations for limited access to offices and support spaces are available for individual requests,” Goodly said.

The start of the spring semester may have you longing for the halcyon days of winter break when vacations replaced Blackboard notifications. In classroom icebreakers and catch-up conversations with friends, those trips back home and abroad to see family or journey somewhere new bubble to the surface. Yes, the syllabi have come out, but those memories of winter break – and the people you spent it with – remain.
I spent my winter break with my mom’s extended family. After failed attempts to reconcile school vacations, work schedules and other dynamics over the past several years, the 15 of us – my grandparents, two aunts, two uncles, five cousins, mom, stepdad, sister and I – embarked on a weeklong cruise aboard the Norwegian Prima for my grandpa’s 80th birthday. Split between Boston, Atlanta and Florida, it was the first time we’d all seen each other together at least since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, if not earlier.
Absence makes the heart grow fonder. At the very least, it helped make the hedonistic excess of cruising feel like valuable family time. I put down my copy of Naomi Klein’s “This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. The Climate” – not exactly light pleasure reading by any stretch of the imagination – to race around the ship’s three-story go-kart track and play cards over lunch at the oddly Western Market-adjacent “Indulge Food Hall.”
Yes, there were quite a few firsts and plenty of laughs on the Prima, just as Norwegian Cruise Lines’ marketing implies. I’ll never forget when Grandpa puffed out strawberry-scented clouds from a borrowed vape in the ship’s cigar lounge, or how he and Grandma, respectively nicknamed “Papa Smurf” and “Mama” by our tour guides, braved the rapids of the White River in Ocho Rios, Jamaica during our one-and-only shore excursion of the trip.
But just as gray clouds and stormy weather had turned three days at sea into a six-day circuit of the Caribbean, I found myself beating back a dark thought at the back of my mind – how much time do I still have left with my grandparents? Spending a week together made me realize how much my family means to me. What will I do without them?
While I may not have hit up the ship’s casino to count cards at blackjack, I still understand statistics. Based on the average life expectancy in the United States, I can expect to have eight more years with my 80-year-old grandpa and between nine and 12 more years with my 77-year-old grandma, according to the Centers for Disease Control. In the strange blur of COVID and college, that doesn’t seem like a lot of time – it’s not enough.
No amount of included gratuity will make it easier to sit a party of 15 together, and I saw how the years had already passed looking across the multiple tables we sat at every night. For my younger cohort of cousins, there’s first dates and first jobs, internships and apartments, classes and college. They talk about professional misogynist and alleged human trafficker Andrew Tate and debate which bodybuilders are “natty” – the ones that don’t use steroids.
At the table for the parents and grandparents, where glasses of wine replace rum and cokes, cosmopolitans and mudslides, there’s pain – back pain, hip pain, knee pain, joint pain, eye pain. Pain that stings, pain that burns and pain that never really goes away. They take steps a little slower and a little more carefully, and every conversation is a few decibels louder than it was a few years ago. Grandpa’s eye drops come out after every meal, and Grandma’s wrist brace is another accessory in her ensemble.
I’ve cruised before, happily sipping from a virgin strawberry daiquiri or piling my plate high at the buffet. And even though my maternal grandparents are generally healthy, save for my grandpa’s ongoing cornea transplant, this year didn’t feel like an escape. As a wake follows a ship, so too did the idea of death follow me.
The truth is obvious, and it is inconvenient – everyone is simply getting older, including you and me. I turn 21 next month, which means there’s 54 years to go based on those life expectancy estimates. Like the cruise, that should be a celebration, but it’s also a moment to reflect about time, life and death – how you want to spend the former and what, if anything, you’re going to do about the latter two.
So here’s some advice, courtesy of Norwegian Cruise Lines and Donna Summer. Taking up an entire row of seats in the ship’s theater one night, the 15 of us basked in a production of “Summer: The Donna Summer Musical,” a tribute to “Queen of Disco’s” life that ends with a show-stopping rendition of Summer’s “Last Dance.”
In “Last Dance,” Summer may have been singing about hitting the dance floor in search of love before the club closes – “Last dance/Last chance for love/Yes, it’s my last chance/For romance tonight” – but there’s a lesson in there, too. Even when the end is here, you can stomp to the beat, clap your hands and head out to the dance floor for the performance of the lifetime – “So, let’s dance the last dance.”
If those life expectancy predictions really are true, I have quite a few dances left. There’s hundreds of phone calls and FaceTimes left to make, and maybe even a few more vacations to take. I’ll still have time to feel Grandpa’s prickly mustache and watch him cheat at Uno by hiding the cards under the table, and Grandma will still call shopping carts “buggies” and wear her necklace of little jeweled shoes, one for each grandchild.
There’s still time. And when it comes to an end, I’ll be ready to dance the last dance.

Among GW students and in the larger D.C. area, food insecurity, or the lack of access to sufficient food to meet one’s basic needs, is extremely prevalent. Food insecurity is on the rise across the United States and college campuses, and many organizations fighting to address this issue are struggling to meet increasing needs. Systemic socioeconomic inequities ever-present in the D.C. area create varying degrees of food insecurity across the District, with less-wealthy wards left without the resources to manage such a pressing issue. GW, we as students cannot continue to turn a blind eye to the epidemic of food insecurity occurring on our own campus and within its surrounding communities.
As the District’s population has swelled in size and affluence over the past decade, the existence of a “grocery gap” between wards has grown. It is no coincidence that as wealthy wards like Ward 2 have expanded, fewer resources go to Wards 7 and 8. A 2017 study by D.C. Hunger Solutions found that nearly 70 percent of the city’s supermarkets in 2016 were concentrated in its richest, predominantly white neighborhoods – Wards 1, 2 and 3 – while the remainder were in underprivileged areas that are predominantly Black – Wards 7 and 8. Even with recent redistricting efforts, which have delivered two new grocery stores to Ward 8, food insecurity disparities driven by grocery gaps remain in the D.C. area.
Transportation, lack of financial means and understocked storefronts remain decisive factors within this issue. A 2020 Capital Area Food Bank report revealed one out of 10 residents of the metropolitan Washington region – nearly one-third of them being children – are food insecure, lacking regular access to sufficient and nutrient-dense food. These residents are someone’s parent, sibling, child or student – they deserve the same, if not more resources, than anyone else. Since then, the pandemic has gone on to exacerbate food insecurity, trending upward after 2020.
With such staggering inequity in mind, we must examine the privilege, or perhaps blissful ignorance, GW showcases in its nonchalant attitude when handling the epidemic of food insecurity among students. GW ought to recognize the financial privileges granted to students by simply existing in Ward 2. But while GW lacks economic diversity in its student body, lower-income students and families are also part of our community. If anything, our location in such a wealthy ward is a detriment to food insecurity, especially those facing financial barriers, given the steep costs that come with existing in Ward 2.
The University’s efforts to address food insecurity among students have been nothing short of abysmal – a 2018 report revealed 40 percent of students face food insecurity at GW. The larger dilemma of food insecurity among college students is one that must be addressed and quickly – Health Affairs, a peer-reviewed public health journal, recently called food insecurity on college campuses the “invisible epidemic.” This is especially true at GW, where on-campus students are tasked with managing dining dollars – $15 to $20 a day – in an immensely expensive environment. But we students cannot forget our immense privilege to use these dining funds in a ward that has greater access to food, let alone education and housing, than most of the rest of D.C.’s population.
But although more needs to be done, GW has made some progress this semester. The University implemented an unlimited “swipe” meal plan for new dining halls in Thurston and Shenkman this semester and added a weekly shuttle between the Foggy Bottom Campus and the Safeway grocery store in Georgetown. After GW Dining officials announced Whole Foods will no longer accept GWorld starting in June 2023, the Safeway shuttle will bring about a way for students to better access a different grocery store at one with much lower prices than those of Whole Foods.
But the University providing a method of transportation to a grocery store for students is the bare minimum – this service does not aid students who don’t possess the means to buy groceries or students without GWorld. GW should provide student vouchers at Safeway once the shuttle takes effect for those who cannot afford to purchase a dining plan or lack the means to refill their GWorld balance. The University should also organize sponsored programs using school funding to give free meal swipes to GW students in need, partnering with grocery stores dedicated to combating hunger. Safeway has demonstrated a dedication to addressing food insecurity, particularly in D.C., in partnership with programs like DC Hunger, Mission DC and Capital Area Food Bank. GW must ensure that all students, regardless of their family’s tax brackets, receive equitable access to their basic needs while attending GW.
To live in an environment where so many lack access to adequate food without taking action is shameful. In my privileged position as a GW student, it would be irresponsible and inconceivable for me not to use my voice to amplify this issue – food insecurity directly affects my fellow students and the larger communities that surround me. The administration should take further steps and action to combat the epidemic of food insecurity for their own students and D.C. residents, beyond attempts to get students easier access to groceries. A recognition of the stigma surrounding food insecurity, particularly at such a wealthy institution, should be a guiding solution to combating the issue among students.
There are a number of ways GW could work to address basic needs across their student body, while setting a strong example of serving those in need for the larger D.C. community and surrounding areas. GW must act swiftly, in a manner that is reflective of dedication to and awareness of food insecurity. Privilege is power. It is time for us to demonstrate this and properly allocate this power, to better serve those in need.

Dear Annie,
I’m in love with my roommate. We were great friends last year, but this year feels different. We have chemistry and a great time together, but I can’t tell if the deep feelings are reciprocated. What should I do?
XOXO,
Love With Roommate
Dear Love With Roommate,
Roommates share a freakishly domestic relationship for just a couple of young adults. Cooking for each other, adorning a shared sink with twin toothbrushes and peeing in the darkness of night so the bathroom light does not wake up the other comprise just a few of these intimate habits. My three roommates and I argue over who takes out the trash, does the dishes and sweeps the floor like a graying couple. After living with each other for the past three months, we have so much familiarity with one another’s habits that it’s not the defining aspects of our personalities that annoy each other, like my chatterbox mouth, but the little things, like leaving flammable items on the stove (in my defense, the stove is off!).
As roommates, you mimic marriage, so why not add a higher level of intimacy or take a more euphemistic approach to your regular Netflix and chill time? While making a move on your roommate may create an uncomfortable living situation if not reciprocated, it could also result in a special relationship without the awkwardness of learning each other’s quirks for the first time.

Your first step, if you haven’t already found confirmation, is to find out if they like you back. I recommend dropping hints gradually increasing in romantic suggestiveness. Start with spending extra GWorld on them at Whole Foods, bringing them home a pint of strawberry cheesecake ice cream – the sexiest ice cream, as it combines the velvety texture of cheesecake with the scarlet undertones of fruit. With the pink love tones dancing throughout ice cream as smooth as satin pajamas, they are sure to get the hint – or, if edible metaphors do not work, they will at least appreciate the thought.
If you share conversations about your love lives, say that you would love a partner with whom you already have a history, like a friend or a roommate. Your roommate may share what they want in a partner in return. They match your description – do you match theirs? To explore your compatibility, invite them to an activity outside of the room, like trying a new restaurant with only the two of you or inviting them to a party for your student organization (frat or sorority formal date?). Create new memories together. Experiences outside the dorm give you and your roommate a more holistic view of each other. Do you still like them outside of the confines of your room? If the chemistry persists, communicate. Your life is not a Jane Austen novel – there is no reason to let decorum lead to brooding looks and sleepless nights dreaming about them. If your feelings haunt you day and night, swallow your pride and tell them you love them (or, okay, maybe just say you like them a lot and want a relationship).
Whatever you do, however, do NOT live together next year. In the case that you’ve begun a relationship, you will need your space to preserve your own individuality, and it doesn’t hurt that absence makes the heart grow fonder. If your love confession did not result in a relationship, continuing to share a space may feel awkward for both parties. A friend of mine from high school dated her freshman-year roommate for a few months. They chose to room together the following year after making things official…and broke up two months later. The enmeshment as both roommates and lovers strained the relationship because neither felt they had their own personal life. I only wish the two of them had asked for my advice on navigating roommates to lovers – they might still be together.
Your dilemma is not the first of its kind – roommate romance books abound and beloved sitcoms like “New Girl” romanticized the arc of roommates to lovers. Worst case scenario – remove one bed from the room, it always works in the books. Crazier things have happened than those in close quarters becoming lovers – I would say take your shot!
Best of luck,
Annie <3

Bullfrog Bagels managers looked for a spot in Western Market before it opened in 2021, but plans were delayed until after the pandemic.
Bullfrog Bagels, a growing bagel shop chain based in the District, will be leaping into Western Market this spring.
Bullfrog Bagels owner Jeremiah Cohen said he is still awaiting final inspections but is aiming to open the chain’s fourth location in the food hall by March 1. He said the cafe will open seven days a week at 7 a.m. and continue service until bagels run out, which he said typically happens at about 3 p.m.
The bagel chain, which operates brick-and-mortar stores in Eastern Market and on H Street NE and a food truck in Tenleytown, serves customizable bagels and a number of “bagelwiches,” including bagel Reubens, BLTs and tuna melts. Cohen said Bullfrog Bagels’ new Western Market space can seat five people, but customers can use open dining space on the cafe’s patio and in the market’s dining area.
Cohen said the chain is already working with the University to set up GWorld payment for the store’s opening and said Zeke’s Coffee, a local coffee roastery with two D.C. locations, will provide coffee beans for the cafe’s drinks.
Cohen said he forged Bullfrog Bagels’ original bagel recipe in 2014 with “hard-to-please” bagel critics in mind, like individuals from New York and New Jersey, and said he’s won the approval of many of the bagel hardliners.
Bullfrog Bagels managers looked for a spot in Western Market before it opened in 2021, but plans were delayed until after the pandemic, when they joined a waitlist for an unoccupied property space in the market to debut its new location, according to Cohen. He said while the market hosts PAUL Bakery, which serves breakfast food like coffee and baked goods, Bullfrog Bagels offers a breakfast that’s “enticing” and “completely different.”
“I love the GW campus,” he said. “I was going in there before it was even Western Market. It just seemed like a really lively place.”
Cohen said the Western Market space isn’t large enough to accommodate bagel preparation in-store, so bagel-makers from the chain’s nearest kitchen will send a shipment of fresh, ready-to-eat bagels each morning.
“All bagels are different,” Cohen said. “There’s always something, some element that’s different about them, but people really like our bagels.”

If “Kaleidoscope” had focused more on rounding out its characters and their relationships, it would not have had to hide behind a flashy format that barely conceals its conceptual failures as it is.
Netflix’s original series “Kaleidoscope,” which was released this month, centers around a traditional money heist mystery with a twist – viewers can watch the episodes in any order.
With its one-of-a-kind “choose your own adventure” approach, the streaming platform orders the episodes of “Kaleidoscope” randomly on each Netflix profile, with the exception of the finale, “White,” which depicts the heist itself. Each order combination alters the viewer’s experience while watching the series, but if the prospect of selecting your own order for these episodes overwhelms you, you’re not alone.
We checked out the episodes in three different orders so you don’t have to:
Viewing Order: “Green,” “Yellow,” “Blue,” “Violet,” “Orange,” “Red,” “Pink,” “White”
Annie O’Brien | Research Assistant
As a toy with reflective surfaces tilted to create everchanging patterns, kaleidoscopes reveal their colors in more than one way. As a TV show, I wish the colors had not revealed themselves to me in this order. Viewing “Green” first established the connection between the show’s protagonist Ray, a wizened experienced robber, and his partner Stan – a younger, whiny criminal. His relationship with Stan is vital to the formation of the heist group.
But the next two episodes – “Yellow” and “Blue” – failed to capture my interest. This order jumps from a jailbird escape to heist planning, which feels inverted. Most of Ray’s recruits lack depth. Stan, Bob and his wife Judy seem as out of order as the show’s episodes – other than a penchant for criminal activity, they have no motive for joining the heist now that they’re free of captivity.
“Violet” dives into the backstory of Leo, the mastermind and leader behind the heist, explaining the motives for the first seemingly unnecessary heist. After spending time with the lost trio of Stan, Bob and Judy, Leo brings a breath of fresh air. The story loses momentum in the next episode – “Orange” jumps back to the backstory of the investigating FBI agent. In focusing on the FBI agent instead of the heist planning, the audience is not inclined to root for the FBI agents who were introduced in depth too late or the criminals whose plan is not clear to viewers. Due to a lack of character development, I lacked the emotional attachment to root for either the criminals or the FBI, turning my viewing experience into mediocre, befuddling entertainment.
Viewing order: “Green,” “Yellow,” “Violet,” “Orange,” “Blue,” “Red,” “Pink,” “White”
Katrina Hauser | Reporter
My viewing began with the episode “Green,” which takes place seven years before the heist. This episode differs drastically from the others in both tone and setting. The story begins inside a prison with two of the main characters and no details about the circumstances that put them there. Though the introduction is vague and confusing, the episode makes up for a lack of clarity with enticing action.
The transition to the second episode “Yellow” was easy as the main protagonist Leo starts to pull together a crew to perform the heist. “Violet” reveals Leo’s motivations which trace back 24 years into the past. Although this format enables the show to quickly and easily explore relationships that span over two decades, “Violet” is slow – its sole central plotline could have easily been retold within minutes in another episode. The following two episodes in my viewing order, “Orange” and “Blue,” also failed to gain the proper momentum. Rather than ramping-up anticipation for the heist by generating tension between characters, the episodes provide more details about how the heist is set to play out. Instead, “Kaleidoscope” should have kept the events of the heist vague and saved its exposition for strengthening relationships.
Episodes “Red” and “Pink” reveal the aftermath of the heist, but all viewings end with “White,” the episode that portrays the heist itself. Though I appreciated that this order gave me an original perspective, the content of the series itself failed to execute itself in a massively entertaining way. The result is unsatisfying and lackluster in comparison to most iconic cinema heists.
Most of the ensemble’s characters do not come across as criminal masterminds but instead as greedy fools, so the series never gives audiences reason to root for any of the crew except Leo, the protagonist. If “Kaleidoscope” had focused more on rounding out its characters and their relationships, it would not have had to hide behind a flashy format that barely conceals its conceptual failures as it is.
Viewing order: “Yellow,” “Violet,” “Orange,” “Green,” “Blue,” “Red,” “Pink,” “White”
Clara Duhon | Culture Editor
Rather than letting Netflix choose my randomized viewing experience, I followed a viewing pattern recommended by a Vulture reporter that briefly introduces each of the characters before giving the audience a window into their past. This order provided an engaging way to learn about the background of each character, and I especially appreciated the placement of “Yellow” as the introductory tone of the series. In this episode, Leo forms his team to take on the heist and viewers catch a glimpse into each of the main characters ahead of diving deeper into their backgrounds and motivations.
“Violet” and “Green,” which both take place years before the heist, are interspersed with more present-day episodes, slowly peeling back the layers of characters’ past experiences with crime while simultaneously pushing forward the present-day plot. This order chips away at Leo’s character in these flashback episodes – viewers gradually piece together the puzzle of his intentions later on, but the slow burn of his plotline is sure to heighten engagement with the show.
“Blue,” the episode just days before the heist, builds up a strong tension as you question allegiances before promptly heading into the frantic minutes after the heist in the following episode. As I transitioned into “Red” and “Pink,” which chronologically told the story of the heist and its aftermath, I was on the edge of my seat, eager for these episodes to reveal hints so I could piece together the mystery. Ending on “White,” as the series intends, filled the plot holes developed throughout the course of the show as different plotlines laced together seamlessly.
My experience with the show was undoubtedly entertaining. But if I need to follow an intentionally curated viewing order to appreciate the story, then the show’s central design to curate a randomized viewing experience for each viewer fails entirely. Netflix has drawn large audiences to prior “choose your own adventure” storytelling, and experimenting with interactive content like this can offer a captivating way to harness audiences in the future. But just like a kaleidoscope creates gorgeous patterns no matter how the colors are arranged, each and every one of the show’s randomized episode orders must reflect the meaning of the storyline for the series to work.

The release states an MTPD officer revived an unresponsive person suspected of overdosing within the first day of the naloxone rollout.  
The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority announced earlier this month that all active Metro Transit Police Department officers and Metro’s crisis intervention specialists will carry naloxone, also commonly known as Narcan, a medication that can reduce or reverse the effects of an opioid overdose. 
MTPD officials said carrying naloxone is the result of increased calls to MTPD reporting suspected overdoses, rising from 27 in 2021 to 43 in 2022, where officers are usually the first responders to a scene and can apply the medication to “temporarily reverse” the effects of an opioid overdose, according to the Metro release. The h3 Project DC, a nonprofit organization whose mission is to end homelessness and human trafficking, helped train Metro personnel equipped with naloxone through lessons on proper usage and safety precautions along with a revision on the signs and symptoms of an opioid overdose, according to the release.
“MTPD officers are committed to keeping our community safe, and this additional tool is already being used to potentially save lives,” said Metro Transit Police Chief Michael Anzallo. “Like all medical emergencies, time is of the essence when rendering care to those experiencing overdoses, and officers are now better equipped to quickly help those experiencing a crisis.”
The release states an MTPD officer revived an unresponsive person suspected of overdosing within the first day of the naloxone rollout.

Yellow is the place to be for breakfast in Georgetown, offering the first of its kind, a Middle Eastern cafe with ingredients that remind you of the motherland.
Between the enchanting melodies of Lebanese vocalist Fairuz, the Arabic words scattered across labels and signs and the calming aroma of Za’atar and summaq, the line at Yellow stretches out the door and around the block for good reason. The cafe, found at the intersection of Wisconsin Avenue and P Street, has a menu well worth the early morning wait with a Palestinian twist on traditional breakfast items, like croissants, coffee cake and breakfast sandwiches.
Breakfast is only served until 11 a.m., so make sure to get there on the earlier side.
Upon walking into Yellow, the namesake of the cafe is immediately apparent through the shades of the yellow walls, which create a warm atmosphere for the crowd gathered inside. The dining area takes from Middle Eastern influence, with a U-shape formation of chairs along one wall and geometric engravings on the tables. There is also a outdoor patio option in the front of the cafe, lining the street.
Chef Michael Rafidi – the founder of Albi, the famous Michelin-Starred Middle Eastern restaurant located in Navy Yard – takes inspiration from his Palestinian heritage in his flavor profiles while adopting modern western cooking techniques. At Yellow, he has infused typical Palestinian ingredients like Za’atar, tahini and summaq into western food including French pastries, iced coffees and soft serve to create a fusion of his background and culinary training.
The menu offers an assortment of sweet and savory morning breakfast options and lunch items sold from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Soft serve ice cream is also available, along with a range of Middle Eastern-inspired coffees and teas.
I went with the breakfast egg pita ($10), made of soft scrambled eggs, cheese known as kashkaval, labne – or strained yogurt – and tahini chopped salad with a consistency similar to a cucumber sauce alongside kofta (extra $3). It was a heavenly combination. The kofta, which is made of minced beef mixed with spices and vegetables like onions, added a savory complementary flavor to the egg, enhancing the overall mix. Toward the end of the pita bread, you will discover another amazing contrast – labne and tahini chopped salad – a refreshing blend of yogurt and a light cucumber sauce to follow the meat and eggs.
I paired the breakfast dish with the golden date latte ($6), and though it was a first for me, the date molasses added a distinctive sweetness to the latte that was not overpowering. I also tried the lemon sumac pastry ($6), comprised of a sweet lemon glaze along a crust that was baked to perfection, crispy yet still floaty, which created a perfect setting for the sumac to shine. Though I was was hesitant about it at first because I have only tasted summaq in savory dishes like musakhan, a famous Palestinian chicken and rice dish, my doubts went away after I took the first bite.
Overall, Yellow was modern with its Middle Eastern-inspired beaming bright yellow decor. The cafe can get a little overcrowded on the weekends, but it’s truly worth the long lines. The mix of spices and ingredients created a bold taste at Yellow – the Middle Eastern flair and flavors complemented each other in a way that you cannot find it in your average neighborhood cafe.
Although it’s very rare to see Palestinian culture celebrated, especially in affluent neighborhoods like Georgetown, Yellow does an exceptional job of doing that and more. Yellow is more than a cafe. It’s a center of Palestinian culture for people to discover Arabic flavors and for Middle Easterns like myself to feel at home.

The NCAA council is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the organization and is made up of representatives of each conference, two student-athletes, two faculty athletic representatives and four conference commissioners.
The NCAA Division I Council approved legislation on Jan. 12 that looks to modernize coaching limits with modifications like waivers for second-time transfers, personnel rules across several sports and the elimination of standardized test scores for initial freshman eligibility.
The NCAA Council is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the organization and is made up of representatives from each conference, two student-athletes, two faculty athletic representatives and four conference commissioners. The new guidelines come after the 2023 NCAA Convention in San Antonio, where the council received the final report and recommendations from the Division I Transformation Committee to expand the post-season tournament.
“The Council’s actions today for coaching limits reflect the ongoing efforts within Division I to modernize NCAA rules,” Executive Associate Athletics Director at Florida and Chair of the Division I Council Lynda Tealer said in the press release. “These changes will ease the burden on campus compliance staffs and increase the number of coaches who can assist with recruiting activities.”
Coaching countable limits 
The Council voted to terminate the voluntary coach designation in Division I to create a new limit for countable coaches in each applicable sport. This proposal will increase the number of countable coaches in baseball, softball and ice hockey to four total, but the council rejected the additional increase of five countable coaches in these sports.
The Council increased the number of additional coaches in men’s and women’s basketball that can engage in coaching activities but are not allowed to recruit off campus to two. The rule change also codified a waiver that allows noncoaching staff members to engage in skill instruction.
The Football Bowl Subdivision and Football Championship Subdivision football will now limit individuals serving as graduate assistants or graduate student coaches to serving a maximum of three years in that role.
The basketball program chose not to impose the current seven-year window for manager positions to increase the opportunity for former student-athletes to return to campus for degree completion and to develop as potential future coaches.
The press release said that in women’s basketball, the professional development of the manager position allows an opportunity to “increase the gender and racial diversity of coaching ranks long-term.”
The coaching limit rules will take effect on July 1.
Second-year Transfer Waivers
The Council unanimously voted to update the guidelines for waivers given to undergraduate student-athletes who transfer for a second time, and now waiver requests will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis but most complete the following criteria.
The student-athlete must demonstrate a physical injury, illness or mental health conditions that required the student’s transfer by providing supporting documents and care plans, and the proximity of the student’s support system will be considered.
The student-athlete must demonstrate exigent circumstances that necessitate their immediate departure from the previous school, like physical assault, abuse or sexual assault that is unrelated to the student-athletes athletics participation.
The guidelines will take effect for any waiver requests to compete during championship seasons that first occur in 2023-24.
Reasons like lack of playing time, position presence and academic presence will no longer warrant waiver relief. The Council also directed the Transfer Advisory Group to manage situations that do not fall under the guidelines.
Student-athletes are expected to meet the requirements for the limited transfer exception like discontinued sports or nonscholarship exceptions that will be allowed to enter the Transfer Portal at any time instead of requiring them to follow their respective sport’s transfer window.
Standardized Testing
The Council voted to eliminate testing score requirements for the immediate eligibility of freshman student-athletes, following a recommendation from the NCAA Standardized Test Scores Tasks Force – a specialized group that reviews initial eligibility requirements as part of the NCAA’s plan to advance racial equity.
“As some NCAA member schools shift away from requiring standardized test scores for general student admissions, the Council felt it was appropriate to reflect those admission standards in eligibility requirements for incoming freshman student-athletes,” Tealer said.
The NCAA Division I waived standardized requirements due to COVID-19 and its impact on the ability to take the tests in 2020.
Stunt
The Council referred a proposal to the Committee on Women’s Athletics that would add stunts to the Emerging Sports for Women program in Division I that requests an opportunity to conduct additional diligence.
