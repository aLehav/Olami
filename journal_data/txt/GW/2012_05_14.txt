The Columbian College of Arts and Sciences announced Friday that it will begin a search for a new dean following the resignation of Dean Peg Barratt, opening up an opportunity to examine what the priorities of the dean of the University’s largest and oldest school should be.
As Barratt prepares to exit her deanship in June 2013 and shifts to a faculty position in the psychology department after a sabbatical, the University will embark on a search for her replacement, a process that will be led by a team of nine tenured faculty members from the college in the fall.
The new dean will assume the position in summer of 2013, but this leaves the University in an uncertain period of transition.
Barratt’s resignation news follows an April staff evaluation in which more than two-thirds of faculty expressed displeasure with her leadership abilities. The survey might not have directly contributed to Barratt’s resignation, it undoubtedly points to the need for the Columbian College to have a more communicative dean, a fact the University must take seriously when it begins its search for a new leader in the fall.
The new dean should be able to identify a vision for the college and effectively articulate those ideas and plans to faculty. This means actively seeking out faculty input before implementing major or overarching policy decisions. This effort to initiate a dialogue among faculty will make for a more transparent environment within the school and hopefully quell faculty concern from the staff survey that said Barratt failed to create an “atmosphere of trust.”
While engagement might not seem like the key pillar of a deanship, the dissatisfaction seen in the survey shows how critical it is for the next Columbian College dean to frequently seek input from faculty. The school will undergo significant evolution over the coming years, with the strategic plan’s release in the fall and the humanities curriculum moving toward an increasingly interdisciplinary model. Rather than carrying out reforms then alerting faculty to the changes, professors should be closely involved throughout the process.
A dissatisfied or disillusioned faculty would not just be detrimental to the school’s progress – it could impact teaching, which hurts students. It is crucial to keep faculty frustrations with Barratt’s lack of communication skills in mind when considering a new hire.
University President Steven Knapp moved forward with a fundraising plan in 2009 that drastically changed a dean’s role, adding an extensive focus– 40 percent of their time – on fundraising, in addition to academics. The new dean must be able to successfully balance fundraising pressures while still working to promote academic programs and build a rapport among faculty.
Since fundraising is such a large part of the dean’s job description, it makes it even more imperative that part of the school’s top leader’s time is devoted to creating a strong dialogue with faculty.
Even though nine tenured faculty members will lead the search, the voices of a wide range of Columbian College professors must be considered.
A Columbian College dean must possess a wide range of knowledge and experience within the humanities. While science and research are increasingly becoming hallmarks of a GW education – as evidenced by the construction of a new Science and Engineering Hall – it is important that the dean also serve as a staunch advocate for the liberal arts.
The new dean must also tackle students’ Columbian College advising woes. Although advisers are supposed to be helpful, students often complain they do not have a sufficient knowledge of the school’s vast academic offerings. It is critical for the new dean to expand and improve the advising system by ensuring advisers are well-versed in a multitude of academic areas.
During this time of change, the faculty and administration must outline the dean’s role to ensure a transparent transition that does not leave students in the University’s largest and oldest school dissatisfied with academics or faculty feeling as though their voice are not heard.

Groups of professors and administrators have spent two months pitching bold solutions for GW’s strategic plan and one change has been gaining momentum: creating a single college for all undergraduates.
Instead of tethering students to specific schools like the Elliott School of International Affairs, all undergraduates could study in a single, umbrella college to encourage cross-disciplinary studies and make it easier to double major, administrators said at a strategic plan town hall May 8.
The one-college model, which is common across higher education and the norm in the Ivy League, could also set up more skill-based courses taught across GW, like the current requirement for all undergraduates to take University Writing.
Senior Vice Provost for Academic Affairs and Planning Forrest Maltzman said the model would allow the University to teach the same “core set of key skills” to all students. He added that specific curricular changes had not yet been discussed, but said he thought it would help the University’s academic structure by encouraging students to study multiple fields.
“There are real barriers right now for students to have a double major in two different schools. The one-college idea is one that we’re exploring, and we really want to get feedback on it,” Brian Richmond, chair of the anthropology department and head of the strategic plan’s group on interdisciplinary studies, said.
“The idea I think, what this would help us do, is really explore what we want every GW undergraduate to come away with in their education at GW,” Richmond added.
The “student-focused” change would not affect academic organization for departments or deans, Richmond said.
The Board of Trustees will deliberate on the strategic plan ideas over the summer, Provost Steven Lerman said, with faculty and administrators finalizing details before its released in the fall. He said if it is adopted into the strategic plan, which will be unveiled in October, a one-college model would not come to fruition until 2015 or 2016.
“I have a lofty ambition for the idea of one school,” Lerman said at the May 8 town hall. “I could imagine a real conversation about what are the foundations of a modern education at a university like ours.”
He also said laying out skill sets that all undergraduates should acquire would likely need a one-college model.
At the town hall, which drew more than 200 people to hear the progress of the groups working on GW’s 10-year strategic plan, administrators hyped several other ideas like showing off research through a GW think tank and extending “deep international programs to South America and sub-Saharan Africa.”
The strategic plan, a signature piece of University President Steven Knapp’s agenda, will look to define GW’s next 10 years. Working groups divided into the four themes of innovation through interdisciplinary work, globalization, citizenship and governance and policy have tried to whittle down the plan’s initial ideas since March.
The University has looked to expand its interdisciplinary academic offerings this year, creating a sustainability minor that is housed in the provost’s office instead of a single school. Richmond said the focus on interdisciplinary academics would help students focus on solutions to global issues, instead of just learning the tenants of a discipline.
Richmond also added that different schools vying for students’ tuition dollars when they double major across schools comes “at the expense of the best undergraduate experience.”
“Part of [the current structure] is just the way the University has evolved. Schools can be siloed and in order to create an interdisciplinary major, it involves some pretty intensive negotiations over who gets what tuition dollars between the different schools,” Richmond said.
Administrators cautioned that the strategic plan working groups and faculty members would provide significant input before the proposal is given the green light.
Maltzman said the University was pushing to bring down institutional barriers. For him, the issue was underlined when a parent lamented that her daughter could not major in both public health and music.
“The parent said our only disappointment was that our daughter couldn’t double major in music. And I sat there, and my job is to defend the University, but that’s very difficult to defend,” Maltzman said at the town hall. “It’s almost a sad statement about one of the things that had happened.”
“All institutions need to continuously innovate. The strategic planning process has helped to ensure that this is happening,” he added in an email.
The one-college model is common at universities so that students can students face a “core set of standards” in their education, said Linda DeAngelo, assistant research director at the Higher Education Research Institute, a research center housed at University of California-Los Angeles.
She said changing the University’s undergraduate structure would take careful planning.
“Change is hard. Institutions of higher education by their very nature are conservative and change slowly,” DeAngelo said. “This is certainly a big proposal and it will take strong leadership to move it forward and have it succeed.”

The GW Law School will enroll up to a 10 percent smaller first-year class this fall after a historically low application season, a move that will translate to fewer tuition dollars during a turbulent time for law schools nationwide.
Dean Paul Schiff Berman said he has looked to downsize one of the largest top-tier law schools in the country since he took the helm last year, predicting the law school could enroll as few as 425 first-year students in the fall, down from this year’s class of 474.
The move would benefit students, Berman said, as the law school looks to improve academic and student life by bringing budding lawyers closer together.
“If the class size is smaller, it makes this more intimate. That’s preferable, but obviously it cuts into tuition revenue, so the issue is how to make the law school smaller but continue to have it run,” said Berman, who came to GW last May from Arizona State University’s Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law, which has a first-year class of about 200.
Berman said he hopes to see GW’s first-year class size shrink to about 400 students in the next five years. First-year enrollment has fluctuated since 2007, peaking at 523 students two years ago.
Ranked No. 20 by U.S. News and World Report, the law school counted a 16.5 percent drop in applications this year, about on par with the dramatic decline nationwide as the legal job market flounders nationally but a larger slump than many peer schools.
“It’s been a challenging year because applications are down to the law school, and to all law schools generally, and that’s complicated [tracking potential enrollment],” Berman, who is finishing up his first year as dean, said.
Plans to cut enrollment also mean fewer tuition dollars streaming into the law school. Berman said by adding programs for non-lawyers, like master’s programs in government contracting and intellectual property law, the school could “expand the scope for what counts as legal education.”
Berman said in February that full- and part-time law students will face a 3.9 percent tuition bump in the 2012-2013 academic year, which he touted as slightly lower than most of GW’s other graduate programs.
Intensified fundraising programs and added programs could offset lost tuition revenue, he said, and fewer students would reduce crowding and increase selectivity.
The law school raised more than $10 million in Berman’s first year as dean, and he said he wants to add $120 million more over the next several years to pay for more scholarships and add academic space.
Few other law schools have announced plans to make sharp cuts in enrollment. The dean of the University of California-Hastings College of Law, Frank Wu,  made headlines last month after he told Inside Higher Ed the school would decrease its student base by 20 percent next year to help “reboot the system” for law schools failing to find students jobs.
Enrollment cuts will help law schools adapt to a changing legal job market, said Paul Caron, a visiting law professor at Pepperdine University and a legal blogger. Caron has taken aim at law schools for failing to adjust their curricula and admissions practices as legal jobs dwindle, but called reducing class size a “helpful first step.”

The University pocketed a total of $53,550 in housing cancellation fees forked over by about 100 students this spring, about 30 percent higher than last year’s total.
GW Housing Programs levied an automatic $350 fee this semester on students who backed out of a housing slot within five days of receiving an assignment and increased the cost of cancelling a housing contract after that time window to $700.
Last year, the housing office brought in $31,800 in fees from cancelled agreements under a policy that imposed a $350 fine after a five-day grace period.
Director of GW Housing Programs Seth Weinshel defended the policy as a catalyst to clear waitlists quicker by encouraging rising juniors and seniors to finalize their housing decisions and deter students from opting into on-campus housing even when they planned to live off campus.
“It was never about the revenue. It’s about the fact that GW needs to fill the space and lock people in at some point,” Weinshel said. “The whole purpose of the fees is to deter students from applying to see what they would get. What we’re trying to do is get students to understand their decisions.”
About 70 of the 472 students placed on the waitlist were still waiting for a housing assignment as of May 9. At this time last year, about 200 students were still waitlisted.
Weinshel said the numbers are evidence that the fee deters students from applying when they planned to pursue off-campus housing and gives students who opt into GW housing a better chance.
Weinshel said the funds from fees will funnel back into the housing budget and be used to pay for building operations like housekeeping and minor repairs.
A total of 41 students paid the $350 fee and 56 students paid $700 to cancel housing for next fall.
The office expects to remove the remaining 70 students from the waitlist in the next two weeks.
Weinshel said the office clears the waitlist every year, typically around the end of finals period, and fills residence halls at “very close to 100 percent” capacity.
Exemptions were not offered to students with financial aid, because the fee was optional and communicated “up front,” Weinshel said.
Jacob Thayer, president of the Residence Hall Association, which approved the fee increases by vote earlier this year, said the fee made some students think twice before signing up for housing but caught others off guard.
“In the future, RHA will work on making sure that iHousing policies are publicized better so students don’t feel like they’re being taken advantage of,” Thayer said.

A former employee is alleging GW shortchanged and fired him without a valid reason in a lawsuit expected to be delivered to the University by Tuesday.
David Driscoll, a former special assistant in the Office of Teaching and Learning, is charging that the University failed to adequately compensate his extra hours of work and terminated his contract in February after he raised these concerns, according to court documents approved by the U.S. District Court.
The University reviewed hourly overtime pay policies for a handful of positions that fall under the Fair Labor Standards Act – a law that regulates employment practices including minimum wage and overtime qualifications – handing employees like Driscoll less compensation, according to the complaint.
Another employee joined the lawsuit late last week, Tara Tayyabkhan, a paralegal from the firm, said Friday. She was unable to provide additional details on the client by publication time.
“I received positive feedback from [Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning Stephen Ehrmann] and the faculty, administrators, and staff with whom I worked,” Driscoll said in an email. “To this day, no one has provided me specifics about why I was terminated.”
Driscoll claimed the University cited his lack of qualifications as the reason for his dismissal.
When asked about the complaint, University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard said the University does not comment on litigation.
Michael Sweeney, an attorney from the law firm Getman and Sweeney said the firm is reaching out to other University employees who might have also been shafted in the reclassification, similar to his client. The federal labor law requires employers to pay back overtime for up to two years.
GW calculated Driscoll worked a total of 24 hours overtime throughout his two years of employment, a number Driscoll said he far surpassed and occasionally reached in just a week.
“It is our understanding that the University used estimates that they generated,” Sweeney said. “The estimates were so low they were just unrealistic.”
If a judge decides there is enough information to classify the positions listed in the complaint – executive aides, executive assistants, executive coordinators and executive support assistants – as a collective class, Sweeney said the University will be required to provide the names and contact information for all members of the group.
Employees who could fall under the lawsuit’s umbrella would be notified that they could opt into the case to potentially gain more overtime compensation.
“What happens often is, workers have fear that if they join the case, they will suffer retaliation from their employer,” Sweeney said. He said typically, individuals join the suit after a court order notice goes out because they consider court involvement a sign of protection.
“We have to prove that the firing was because David raised claims,” Sweeney said. “They could have fired for valid reasons if they had them, but we think the circumstances will show that they didn’t have valid reasons.”

The ongoing construction on campus hasn’t been the only example of change at GW. The University Counseling Center has experienced its own fair share of remodeling this year.
The UCC has seen changes including the replacement of the center’s director, multiple new psychologists and, after a vocal student lobbying effort in the wake of a student suicide, the offering of six free preliminary counseling sessions for all GW students.
The counseling center has also seen a 20 percent increase in the number of individual student sessions as well as a seven percent increase in UCC services overall. With this sharp increase from last year, it is clear students feel more comfortable seeking mental health assistance.
But the overwhelming rise in students using the counseling center’s service has been accompanied by a decrease in UCC revenue over the course of the year, prompting administrators to potentially rethink the future of programs, like the six sessions free of charge.
“As we wind down the academic year, these programs will be reviewed, and the financial implications are still being evaluated,” Peter Konwerski, Senior Associate Vice President and Dean of Students said.
A review of potential price changes will happen this summer.
As the University reviews the counseling center’s budget this summer and considers how to raise revenue, it should continue to offer the valuable six free sessions.
Rachel Krausman, co-founder of Active Minds, a student organization that works to promote positive mental health on campus, told me there has been “great feedback from the GW community” regarding the free sessions.
Abolishing these sessions would send a negative message to Colonials who have opted to seek psychological help. Removing the six free sessions is a step backward.
It may seem far-fetched to consider offering all counseling services free of charge, especially since there is a $60 fee per session after the six free preliminary sessions. But American and New York universities offer completely complimentary counseling services to students. At the very least, the University can continue to offer the first six sessions for free.
The good news is that Krausman said while she thinks there might be changes based on the revenue numbers, she would be extremely surprised “if the system went back to where it was before.”
I hope she is right. Mental health is essential to student success. The University should continue to make sure that amid potential changes at the center’s 2033 K St. offices in the coming months, the needs of students continue to remain the top priority.
In this time of transition, the University should not sacrifice programs that are beneficial to students in the name of securing steady revenue.

YOLO.
It is an acronym that, if you have been living under a rock, means “you only live once.” That sentiment has the power to ignite and motivate, but our generation does not use it as fuel to propel toward a dream job or to carve out an identity.
Instead, it is a justification for skipping class or engaging in a night of bad decisions.
Our 20s have been seen as years of delayed responsibility and decreased pressure. Our generation has taken shirking commitments so seriously that we have changed the timetable of transition to adulthood, according to the New York Times article by Robin Marantz Henig, “What Is It About 20-Somethings?” . Fewer 20-somethings are fitting the conventional definition of an adult than ever before and we have created for ourselves a decade-long transition period that Clark University psychology professor Jeffrey Jensen Arnett calls “emerging adulthood.”
I am certainly guilty of this. I let college serve as my excuse to explore career options rather than nail down a life goal, and immediate gratification is always more enticing than long-term gain.
But here is the thing: in doing so, we are not just wasting our youth or college years or GWorld money. This decade might be the most important one of our lives. And it is not worth squandering.
It is in peoples’ 20s that they begin to lose about 1 percent of the volume of the hippocampus – which is critical for memory and learning – annually, according to New York Times magazine. And our 20s are not just physically significant. 80 percent of the most important milestones in our lives will happen before we turn 35, according to psychologist and clinical professor at the University of Virginia, Meg Jay.
So as the graduates embark on what will surely be an adventure of proportions they have not yet imagined and the rest of us move up a year, our attitude needs to change.
Our twenties are still the best decade of our lives. But it is also the best decade to establish ourselves. We can find ourselves but we can also define ourselves.
Professor Jay calls the 20s a “Las Vegas in the life cycle.”
“You don’t empower twentysomethings by telling them they’re not grown-ups. You don’t demote them just when they need to start taking themselves seriously. They interpret it as ‘I shouldn’t worry about a real relationship. I don’t have to engage with having a real job. Everybody tells me I’m not a grown-up,’” she told USA Today last month.
This isn’t the time for us to succumb to our present bias or forego our potential for a more immediate route.
And why should we?
We might be nowhere near our play’s final curtain drop, but you better believe that this is when the show gets interesting. Treat this decade like the scene when you light up the stage and dazzle the audience with your performance.
Because as fun as it is to dismiss our own growth or defer to our thirties as the time when our actions have consequences, that approach makes for a seriously lackluster plot line.
And here is what is both terrifying and thrilling: this decade will at least lay the groundwork for our lives. We might begin our careers and we might meet our future spouses. We might land in the city of our dreams or finally start writing that book.
It does not matter how we begin or what path that points us to. Because life will not end when we graduate – it accelerates. This is the scene that matters most. It’s better to be the star of it.

Raekwon and Method Man of the Wu-Tang Clan were right – cash rules everything around me.
Yet for many students who struggle to find summer jobs, an unpaid internship must suffice. And due to labor laws, many organizations force students to earn course credit for free work.
It costs $1,000 at GW for each credit for an internship. That’s right: $1,000 just to work for free. I gave up hope of accepting unpaid internships I applied for after learning about the fee. But then I did some digging – well, a lot of digging – and found a way out.
The Columbian College of Arts and Sciences offers a zero-credit option for a mild $35 fee. If you have not heard of this policy, you are not alone. The zero-credit option allows students to work with permission from the University without receiving credit. But many students do not know about the zero-credit option, and that is a shame.
GW should promote and better advertise these policies to students. I have to applaud the effort to make internships more accessible to those who cannot afford $1,000 per credit, but the fact that I felt like I had to journey to find out this information means others might have as well. Students should not have to worry about turning down opportunities due to affordability.
I was passed around from the Career Center to advising offices within the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences and the School of Media and Public Affairs. Finally, I was rerouted to CCAS advising, where I learned about the zero credit policy.
The zero-credit policy is designed to help students. Advertising it more so students can actually use it is the next step. No matter how beneficial or innovative a policy, it can only be effective if students know about it.
This lack of communication between Career Services, CCAS and the student body could be remedied by establishing a more open dialogue between the different groups. Whether the answer is a University-wide email that spreads news about important policies or a pamphlet within each school explaining internship options, there needs to be a better way for students to become educated on the University’s internship policies. As unintentional as it may be, the disconnect creates a barrier between the university and the student body.
Having to pay the University for credit for an unpaid internship is something that not all students can afford. Living in D.C. for the summer is already very expensive and students must figure out other costly factors, including living arrangements.
Cash rules everything and unpaid internships are not going away any time soon. The University has to do a better job of advertising policies like the zero credit option so students can look out for their futures.
