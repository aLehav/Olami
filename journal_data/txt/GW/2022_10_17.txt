Kogan donated $500,000 to build the plaza in the center of campus. At the time, the donation made him one of the top donors in the University’s history.
Barton “Bart” Kogan, an alumnus, donor and the namesake of Kogan Plaza, died on Oct. 3, according to a University release. He was 75.
Kogan graduated from GW’s School of Business in 1969 with a bachelor’s degree in business management, then received his master’s degree in counseling in 1970. Kogan and his family made the donation sponsoring the construction of Kogan Plaza in 1999.
Kogan donated $500,000 to build the plaza in the center of campus. At the time, the donation made him one of the top donors in the University’s history.
At the time, Kogan said much of the money would go toward tuition relief because the construction of the outdoor, open-air space would not cost the full amount of his donation.
“My experience at GW was that there was no open space except what, at the time, was a very cluttered University Yard,” Kogan told The Hatchet in 1999. “I wanted a city campus, but this was just a bit sparse.”
During his time at the University, Kogan was a member of the fraternity Kappa Sigma, and he became an active alumnus after graduating, serving as the chapter’s alumni advisor and even attending fraternity barbecues. Kogan visited GW’s chapter twice annually to meet new pledges and watch their initiation.
After graduating, he began working for the Continental Telephone Corporation, which Verizon later acquired. Kogan shifted into real estate, founding BHK Management, an apartment development and management company.
Kogan served on the business school’s board of advisors for 22 years.
According to a University release, he served as president of the Western Region of the Federation of Temple Mens’ Clubs and served on the boards of Los Angeles Hebrew High School and of the Zeigler School of Rabbinic Studies at American Jewish University. At the time of his death, Kogan co-chaired the board of governors for the Sinai Temple of Los Angeles.
The release states that the Sinai Temple of Los Angeles will hold a memorial service “at a future date.”

Freshman swimmer Ava Topolewski picked up Atlantic-10 Rookie of the Week honors after two first place finishes in swimming and diving’s first home meet of the season earlier this month.
Topolewski placed first in the 1,000-yard freestyle in a time of 10:13.44, nearly 30 seconds faster than the next closest swimmer out of the 18 competitors. She also notched a first-place finish in the 500-yard freestyle, finishing in 5:04.35, five seconds ahead of her competition.
Topolewski picked up a fourth-place finish in the 200-yard butterfly, clocking in at 2:07.53. She also collected a fifth-place finish as part of the 200-yard freestyle relay team.
The results mark an improvement in time and place from her first meet at the start of the month, where she collected a third-place finish in the 500-yard freestyle, coming in at 10:21.85. She also placed sixth in the 500-yard freestyle and seventh in the 200-yard butterfly at that meet, finishing in 5:08.97 and 2:07.99, respectively.
The Grand Prairie, Texas native was a high school standout prior to GW, earning National Interscholastic Swim Coaches Association All-America honors as a senior at Lake Ridge High School. She was also nominated for the USA Today Female Swimming and Diving Athlete of the Year in 2021 and 2022 after qualifying for the US Open in three events.
She was a standout out of the pool as well, earning USA Swimming Scholastic All-American honors in 2019, 2021, and 2022.
Topolewski is one of eight freshmen added to the women’s roster for the 2022-23 season, and one of 13 freshmen who were added overall between the men’s and women’s rosters.
The Colonials had a successful weekend overall against Old Dominion, with both the men’s and women’s teams picking up their first victories of the season. GW notched top finishes in 22 of the 32 events, with sophomore Moria Freitas collecting three first-place finishes individually.
The Colonials will continue to defend their dual A-10 Championship titles as they take on Navy at home Friday and Saturday.

Students who are getting ready to go home for fall, Thanksgiving and winter break this semester may find themselves returning to states that no longer guarantee their reproductive rights. The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in June ended the constitutional right to abortion, leading states like Texas, Kentucky and Alabama to immediately ban abortion. GW currently offers minimal aid to students in need of reproductive care, but it should provide the appropriate emergency medical services to those who can’t access them at home.
GW students come from all over the country and the world, but those who reside permanently in states with anti-abortion laws could face time in prison if they attempt to get an abortion there or face serious mental and physical injury if legally required to carry a pregnancy to term. To properly support students, GW must offer the abortion pill through the Student Health Center and implement emergency contraceptive vending machines on campus.
Thirteen states have currently banned abortion with little to no exceptions since June, and five states have banned it within various time constraints ranging from six to 14 weeks of pregnancy. More than 4,000 students in 2021 came from states where abortion is now banned to some extent, according to GW’s enrollment data. Take one example – GW’s 247 students from Tennessee, whose trigger law went into effect in August of this year, could face jail time for any attempt to terminate a pregnancy while in their home state.
It’s more important now than ever that both officials and students are doing everything they can to ensure the safety of their community. But the Student Health Center can only prescribe birth control, offer “contraception counseling” and help students obtain emergency contraception if they have the Student Health Insurance Plan. Since not all students enroll in GW’s insurance plan, access to contraceptives through the SHC isn’t available to everyone. Although both of these services are extremely helpful to many students, the University undoubtedly has the money and resources to provide more support for all students.
As a private institution located in D.C., GW isn’t subject to the regulation that public schools in anti-abortion states face. Many student health centers of public universities in Texas have removed any information about terminating a pregnancy from their websites since the state banned abortion in August. But there is no ban or limit on abortion no matter how far along someone is in their pregnancy in D.C., though that may change based on the outcome of the midterm elections.
Higher education institutions like Boston University and Barnard College are miles ahead of GW in terms of reproductive health resources. In March, Boston University joined several other colleges and universities in installing vending machines stocked with morning-after pills. Sold for $7.25 in BU’s vending machines, the pills are much more affordable than pharmaceutical prices nationwide. Low-cost contraceptives are a great way to help college students stay safe, and these machines have become one of the most popular and effective ways for other universities to administer cheaper emergency contraception to their students. GW’s own Student Association has similar plans in the works, but nothing has come to fruition yet.
Besides student-run or University-sponsored emergency contraception vending machines, the Barnard College Primary Care Health Service will begin providing the abortion pill next fall, which individuals can take within 10 weeks of pregnancy to abort a fetus. Offering this pill to students would be a great next step for GW and would prove its desire to ensure the health and safety of its students. Being forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term could jeopardize students’ education, so GW should give them accessible options for maintaining their reproductive health to ensure their safety and academic success.
GW has shared a series of articles and Q and A’s with statements from the Dean of the Milken Institute School of Public Health and other health officials about what the overturn of Roe v. Wade means for anyone who can get pregnant. But these articles had no links to resources or clinics around D.C. where students could turn to if need be. GW’s move to publish several articles about the overturn without including any reproductive resources shows its lack of commitment to its students.
Students enrolled in the Student Health Insurance Plan can access emergency contraceptives through the SHC and utilize clinics around D.C., including ones close to campus like The Dupont Clinic or Washington Surgi-Clinic on F Street. But in a city like D.C. where abortion is still readily available, GW needs to follow in the footsteps of other progressive universities and student groups who are working to provide reproductive care to protect students’ rights and their ability to access higher education.
The time is now for GW to implement emergency contraception vending machines and offer the abortion pill through the SHC. The thousands of students who come from states that have outlawed abortion are relying on GW as a safe haven for reproductive rights. As students begin to return home for Fall Break and the holidays that follow, the University must make reproductive care accessible – especially when their home state will not.

From studio apartments in Dupont Circle to townhouses in Columbia Heights, students have plenty of options to find off-campus housing in the District – so long as they’ve done their time on campus. Between D.C. law and GW’s own policies, freshmen, sophomores and juniors must live in residence halls unless they meet six specific criteria, ranging from their marital status to their religious beliefs, that will garner exemptions from GW.
But neither students nor officials are above bending the University’s rules to transfer campus residents to off-campus housing. GW’s irregularly enforced housing requirement isn’t fostering community in Foggy Bottom. Caught in between deceptions and exemptions, it’s hardly a rule at all.
D.C. law requires the University to house all freshmen and sophomores on campus except those who are permanent residents, veterans, married, disabled or whose religious beliefs can’t be accommodated within an on-campus residence hall. That changed when GW instituted a three-year residency requirement in 2014 to “further support students’ academic and campus experiences” and assuage residents’ concerns over their noisy and disrespectful Foggy Bottom neighbors.
GW’s three-year residency requirement comes with exemptions of its own, as juniors can submit requests for an exemption to Campus Living and Residential Education on a first-come, first-served basis. But that policy has also changed, and largely because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The University’s decision to tightly regulate on-campus housing for the 2020-21 academic year meant that there were 1,500 undergraduate students living on campus compared to about 2,300 undergraduates living off campus in spring 2021. Even as officials planned to reopen campus during the last academic year, they granted exemptions to rising sophomores and juniors with long-term leases.
But after students came flocking back to campus, GW appeared to be short on housing. To clear a waitlist of about 250 students for this school year, officials waived the three-year requirement and offered to reduce students’ price of housing by thousands of dollars if they accepted another roommate. But if the requirement was such a cornerstone of the University’s academic and campus culture, then why would officials waive it so often in the first place?
Granted, campus housing can be genuinely convenient and comfortable for many students, and living in a residence hall under the supervision of a community coordinator can give freshmen and sophomores a gentle introduction to adulting and making friends in college. But on- and off-campus housing is a balancing act – it’s in GW’s financial interest to charge as many students as possible for room and board, but the reality is that there are only so many empty beds on campus at any given time.
Even as GW has shown it’s willing to waive the three-year housing requirement, students have broken the rules entirely. To circumvent the residency requirement, freshmen and sophomores have submitted false addresses, lied about their faith and doctored utility bills. That determination flies in the face of the Code of Student Conduct, but it should be a wake-up call for officials – in the scramble to house students, all parties are ignoring the third-year requirement.
Maura Kelly-Yuoh | Staff Cartoonist
With or without the University’s approval, students are going to seek alternatives to the University’s motley collection of residence halls. At one popular off-campus housing option, the Varsity on K directly advertises to students who can’t wait to move out of GW’s residence halls – “Sure, the dorms are close, unless they exile you to the Vern,” the building’s website reads. Off-campus apartments can offer more space and better amenities at a lower cost than residence halls, and some like The Avenue and The President next to the I Street Whole Foods, are closer to the heart of GW’s Foggy Bottom Campus than buildings along the outskirts, like 1959 E Street.
Eight years after its implementation, the housing requirement is a paradox – its exemptions are crucial to the University’s operation and students’ comfort, but they call the requirement’s very purpose into question. What’s ostensibly a hard and fast rule simply isn’t, shifting with GW’s available housing stock before the start of the academic year.
The three-year housing requirement is long overdue for a reassessment and perhaps a replacement that GW, students and our Foggy Bottom neighbors can agree upon. The selectively enforced requirement simply isn’t working. It’s no guarantee against students’ bad behavior in the neighborhood. It arbitrarily restricts or permits them from looking for off-campus housing. And it forces the University to search for more space to house students on campus.
We can only speculate as to what a return to the pre-2014, two-year residency requirement might look like, but it may mean consolidating smaller residence halls in favor of larger buildings like District House and Thurston Hall or offering more amenities to entice students to stay on campus.
Ending the three-year requirement would nearly certainly represent a financial loss for the University, which must account for annual room and board costs in addition to “megadorm” renovation projects, like those at District House and Thurston Hall. But we feel GW serves us best as an institution of higher learning, not a landlord – we know our housing needs and financial limits better than Campus Living and Residential Education. And if extracting room and board from students is truly key to GW’s financial solvency, officials have a bigger problem than who can live off campus.
Students can make GW their home, but they don’t need to live there to do so.

If you’re more into planning group costumes than pondering constitutional questions, then the seven berobed justices of the Student Court is the look for you.
Searching for Halloween costume inspiration? Look no further than Foggy Bottom.
These GW-themed getups are light on the budget and easy to assemble, so you’re ready to celebrate Halloween in no time. From happy hippos to the dreaded devil’s advocate, check out some costume ideas that scream Buff and Blue.
Move-in day GW parent
What you’ll need: GW-branded merch
Whether you’re homesick or sick of home, chances are someone helped you wheel that blue cart into your room to settle into college earlier this year. This costume is easy to pull off if you already own a GW Mom or GW Dad shirt. Shoot for the ultimate dad fit with a baseball cap and jacket to tie around your waist. Pair with cargo shorts or leggings and sneakers to capture that move-in day look, and if you really want to sell it, accessorize with a map of campus, a box of tissues and a fanny pack.
Student Court
What’ll you need: A black sheet, white collared shirt and tie 
Student Association President Christian Zidouemba is in, and former acting Chief of Staff Cordelia Scales is out after this month’s Student Court decision. But ribbing GW’s wannabe politicians is always in style. The Student Court’s seven berobed justices are inexplicably the best-dressed judicial bench this side of Capitol Hill. If you’re more into planning group costumes than pondering constitutional questions, then this courtroom-inspired look is for you.
To match the justices’ style, wear a white collared shirt and tie and fasten a black or dark-colored sheet over your ensemble with bobby pins or tape to capture that classic look of self-importance. Accessorize with a gavel, or use your WEPA account to print the full 33 pages of the court’s decision for that extra touch of authenticity.
The Wrightons
What you’ll need: A collared shirt, dress shoes, a suit and tie and a dress or skirt
For a couple’s costume that celebrates GW’s cutest pairing since George and Martha Washington, dress up as interim University President Mark Wrighton and his wife, Risa Zwerling Wrighton. Grab a collared shirt, dress shoes and a suit and tie – ideally blue or gold to show some school spirit – for President Wrighton. For Risa Zwerling Wrighton, go with a floral top and white skirt combo.
To go all out in a group costume, go as the Wrightons’ furry friends, Spike the dog and Maestro – who Wrighton nicknamed Purrfessor – the cat. A black or white shaggy sweater will match Spike’s fur, but a t-shirt can do in a pinch. Either way, don’t forget a nametag – you’re the First Dog of GW! Tan, brown and even leopard print can match Purrfessor’s tabby coat. Or even better, incorporate your own furry friend in the costume as Spike or Purrfessor. If you’re up for some arts and crafts, you can turn headbands into animal ears with some glue and felt or construction paper.
The devil’s advocate
What you’ll need: A collared shirt, dress shoes, a suit and tie and a dress or skirt
From the Elliott School of International Affairs to the School of Media and Public Affairs, the devil’s advocate is always ready to grind your 8 a.m. class to a halt with scorchingly bad hot takes. Whether you know them, you hate them or you are one, put that Hillternship outfit to good use with this costume idea. Print out some hot takes of your own and tape them to your outfit. A backpack or briefcase will help sell the look, and if you really want to accessorize, splurge on a pair of devil’s horns or a plastic pitchfork.
Hippo
What you’ll need: Gray shirt, gray shorts or pants, gray shoes and headband
GW’s relationship with the hippopotamus began when former University President Stephen Joel Trachtenberg donated the hippo statue outside Lisner Auditorium to the Class of 2000, and our collective love for this magnificent mammal is still going strong. So why not pay homage to GW’s unofficial mascot this Halloween? Grab some gray clothes to match that hippo hide, and spice up your groutfit by turning any old headband into ears. Alternatively, opt for a hippo onesie that will serve as a comfortable piece of loungewear attire long after Halloween concludes.
GW’s next president
What you’ll need: A name tag
GW’s next president is still undecided, so why not throw your hat into the presidential search ring? Channel your inner administrator and chart the course of the University’s future in a low-effort costume with a name tag or badge declaring your candidacy. Stick it to your shirt and voilà. Go formal for a little more flair or stay casual with some GW-branded clothes that’ll let you show off your school spirit. If you’d rather abandon the outlook on GW’s future, go old school as a throwback to the University’s 19th-century presidents with a puffy lace collar or some buckled shoes.

Mulled apple cider is a timeless staple when it comes to fall drinks, leaving a seasoned, delectable incense in your kitchen.
Halloween is rapidly approaching, and with it comes fall parties, get-togethers and the familiar scramble to find a delectable accessory for the Halloweekend festivities before they commence.
If you’re in a bind, never fear – we’ve laid out the best cocktails and treats for all of your last-minute potluck needs. Use our tips to be sure to wow your guests or host – and don’t forget your costume on your way out.
Here are our top picks for the best homemade drinks and treats to make this spooky season:
The Spider Bite
With its murky, swirling base, dramatic glasses and toppling spider egg visuals, this drink is sure to both intimidate and impress your guests in equal measure. It’s relatively easy to make, meaning you can scare your friends without spooking yourself with a complicated recipe.
Ingredients:
– Ice
– Tapioca pearls
– Shallow cocktail glasses
– Coffee liqueur
– Vanilla liqueur
Instructions:
Prepare the tapioca pearls in advance, boiling them in a 5:1 ratio of water to pearls. Pack glasses with ice and pour the pearls on top, styling to resemble spider eggs on top of the drink. For an extra ooze, add flavored syrups like vanilla or caramel. Finally, add coffee and vanilla liqueurs and fill the glass to the brim. For a nonalcoholic alternative, swap the coffee liqueur for black coffee or tea and the vanilla liqueur for milk or coffee creamer. Once prepared, serve immediately.
Spiked Mulled Cider
Mulled apple cider is a timeless staple when it comes to fall drinks. Although making your own pot takes one to two hours, the time it spends simmering will pay off in the taste – and your kitchen will smell amazing for the rest of the day as an added bonus.
Ingredients:
– Store-bought apple cider
– One lemon, sliced
– Two teaspoons honey
– Four cinnamon sticks
– One teaspoon each of nutmeg, cloves and star anise
– Mugs or other heat-safe cups
Instructions: 
Combine apple cider, spices, lemon slices and honey in a large pot or slow cooker. Cook on low for roughly an hour on the stove or two hours if using a slow cooker. Serve hot in mugs with a stick of cinnamon and a slice or two of lemon for garnish. If you’re hosting, keep rum, brandy or bourbon on hand for guests who want to spike their mugs. This delectable beverage can also be prepared in advance to have on hand for an upcoming Halloween party in a bind – just refrigerate and reheat the cider when you need it.
The Nurse Ratched
For a spookier vibe, try this drink to add some freaky fun to your night. With its fizzy base, splash of color and mild horror factor created by fake blood, the Nurse Ratched cocktail is the perfect mixture of corny, creepy and interactive.
Ingredients:
– A clear alcoholic drink, like vodka tonic or hard seltzer
– Alternatively, swap for a clear soda like 7-Up or Sprite
– A dark, red-colored juice, like cranberry, pomegranate or cherry
– Plastic syringes (can be found at most pharmacies)
– Ice
– Tall cocktail glasses
Instructions:
First, add ice to your tall cocktail glass before pouring your clear drink of choice, like vodka or gin with tonic water or a clear soda. Maintain a generous amount of space at the top of the glass for the frightening star of the show. Next, draw the red juice into a syringe and place the object into the glasses without depressing the plunger. The body of the syringe should rest against the rim of the glass with the plunger side up. Serve immediately, allowing your guests to squeeze the blood-red juice into the drink to add a burst of color, flavor and creepiness to their drinks.
Oreo and Strawberry Witch Hats
These simple, fun witch hat treats may be more cute than chilling, but they will make for an equally adorable and appetizing choice for your next Halloween get-together. Just melt some chocolate, add some frosting and you’ll be ready to grab your broom and leave for a night out in Salem.
Ingredients:
– Oreos
– Strawberries
– Melting chocolate or candy wafers in brown, black or color of choice
– Frosting in colors like purple, green and orange
– Parchment paper
Instructions:
Begin by melting chocolate in the microwave, heating in 30-second intervals until smooth. Next, dip the Oreos into melted chocolate, coating evenly. Place the chocolate-covered Oreos on parchment paper. Cut tops from strawberries to form cone shapes and dip the strawberries in melted chocolate. After the berries are evenly coated, place one on top of each Oreo with the pointed ends up. Once the chocolate has dried, add frosting to create a ribbon around the base of the cone and a buckle to replicate a witch hat.
Peanut Butter Spider Cookies
These spider cookies are simultaneously endearing and elegant, making them the perfect treat for any Halloween occasion. This recipe is an adorable, simple and quick way to dress up a store bought cookie mix, adding a little extra fun to an otherwise-basic recipe.
Ingredients:
– Store-bought peanut butter cookie mix
– Frozen peanut butter cups
– Candy eyes
– Chocolate frosting
– Piping bag
Instructions:
First, bake your store-bought peanut butter cookies using the instructions on the packet. Immediately after taking the cookies out of the oven, press an upside-down frozen peanut butter cup to the top of each cookie. The chocolate should start to soften once each treat has been assembled.
