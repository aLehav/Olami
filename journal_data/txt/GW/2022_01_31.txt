When Joe Bamisile isn’t on the court, you can find him meditating, recording his own music or painting. 
Joe Bamisile and Brayon Freeman both came to GW looking for a chance at consistent playing time under a coach that they trusted.
Bamisile is a sophomore guard who transferred to GW from Virginia Tech last summer and has burst onto the scene with the Colonials this year. He has appeared on the SportsCenter Top 10 three times already thanks to his dunks and has no plans to stop.
Bamisile said he was attracted to the idea of playing for Head Coach Jamion Christian, who he said was different from most other coaches.
“I knew he was going to give me a chance to learn and grow,” Bamisile said. “I didn’t leave Tech because I thought I was the best player in the world. I left Tech because I just wanted a chance to develop in game.”
Bamisile has shown his development throughout the season, averaging 30.1 minutes, 14.8 points, 5.7 rebounds and 1.2 assists per game, along with a 44.3 field goal percentage.
But Bamisile’s interests go beyond just basketball. He said he has been making music since he was a kid while also painting on the side. He said he made two songs between December and January and plans to release more music once the season is over.
Bamisile, who releases music under the name Phouelisi, has 117,731 monthly listeners on Spotify and has two songs with more than a million listens.
“Right now I’m really focused on basketball as my main goal, and music is more of a hobby and pastime and another form of expression,” Bamisile said. “And I just think it’s really cool that people can relate to something I express that’s a feeling or an emotion.”
In August of last year, Bamisile walked around campus, asked GW students to dance with him and turned his journey into a music video for his song LOCO. The video has racked up more than 80,000 views.
“I’m a relatively introverted person, but I have extroverted tendencies,” Bamisile said. “I really needed a music video, and the song was releasing that night. I put on my little extroverted cloak and just asked a bunch of people to dance, and people seemed pretty excited to do it.”
Bamisile said he has been into meditation ever since his grandparents introduced it to him at the age of seven. He meditated off and on throughout his childhood but started his own practice of meditation while in high school, and it’s been a crucial part of his daily life ever since.
“It makes life a lot more simple and easy,” Bamisile said. “I enjoy silence. I enjoy sitting with myself. I enjoy being able to disconnect a bit from the world around me. I love the perspective I get to have when I can detach from my own feelings. I love the reflection that I get to have in those times.”
Bamisile, who is studying communications and psychology, said he hopes to get a masters degree in psychology after college. He said he has been enjoying all of his classes, and his favorite is called Philosophy of the Mind.
“I love philosophy,” Bamisile said. “Growing up I used to read so many philosophy books. And now it’s like, now I get to be in a philosophy class.”
Bamisile deactivated his Twitter last summer and unfollowed everyone on Instagram recently after having a discussion with one of his friends that led him to make the decision. He said he doesn’t want his attention and mind to be controlled by algorithms.
In high school, Bamisile said he dealt with a nagging knee injury that prevented him from playing his sophomore and senior seasons. During the first surgery, he had a screw put in his knee, but it caused degeneration of his cartilage.
Though he knew he had to get another surgery to fix it, he said he only had two offers to play in college heading into his junior year, so he decided to play the season on the injured knee. That season, he averaged nearly 29 points per game and was named all-region and all-state in Virginia.
“On a wobbled knee, I’m pretty proud of that,” Bamisile said.
Freeman, a freshman guard who picked GW over offers from Oklahoma State, VCU and Ole Miss, has also thrived in GW’s environment.
He said he wanted to play at a school where the style of play catered to his abilities and Christian’s offense fit the bill.
“I like the way his offense is,” Freeman said. “It’s an open offense that allows you to be yourself, allows you to be creative. You can’t get that everywhere as a freshman. And coming here, I knew I could probably see the floor.”
Freeman has also taken advantage of the opportunities he’s gotten as a Colonial, averaging 23.4 minutes, 8.9 points, 3.1 assists and 1.8 rebounds per game with a 41.6 field goal percentage. And he’s done it all with an injured knee.
“At the beginning of the year I tore my knee up,” Freeman said. “It’s still torn as we speak. That’s why I wear the brace. I’m planning on getting the surgery after the year. It was either get the surgery and sit out my whole freshman year or play through it and get the surgery after, so I went with the after option.”
Freeman said he has lived in the D.C. area for most of his life and said his favorite part about the city is the people and the culture.
“It’s just different,” Freeman said. “It’s a city vibe. There’s always a lot of people. It’s always crowded. You can never go outside and not see people. I just like seeing people honestly.”
Freeman said he likes to listen to hip hop, especially D.C. artists, in addition to writing and drawing in his free time. He said he describes himself as an “artsy” person and has a few tattoos on his left arm, on which he plans to get more.
“Once the season’s over I’m gonna go crazy,” Freeman said. “Next year I’m gonna be back. I’m gonna go crazy. I’m just saving it right now.”
Freeman said it’s odd going to a school where sports aren’t very popular on campus and games are sparsely attended.
“It’s all about winning though,” Freeman said. “Fans come to see people win. Fans are not gonna come to see you if they think you’re gonna lose. So at the same time, it’s on us to bring fans.”

Officials finally made concrete progress this month on a topic that the GW community and administrators have wrangled over for years: shared governance. Faculty members on the Shared Governance Task Force have been meeting with interim University President Mark Wrighton and members of the Board of Trustees for conversations about how to move past the unilateral administrative decision-making that hallmarked the past few years at GW.
Meaningful engagement between administrators and faculty is an important first step to building a more inclusive and harmonious way of running the University – but it is just a first step. Not only must University leadership keep its promises to actually hash out a shared governance framework, but students need to be involved too.
The Board first announced these shared governance efforts when it delayed the presidential search process back in September. The Board has committed to establishing a formal structure by which faculty can provide input and be consulted on decisions that the University’s leadership makes.
The term “shared governance” gets thrown around a lot and oftentimes ends up sounding like a buzzword. Shared governance at GW has become so warped over the past few years that the initiative is largely focused on pinpointing what the term actually means.
Generally speaking, the concept of shared governance at universities refers to the system by which faculty, administrators and trustees can come to collective decisions after hearing each other out. But at GW, this collaboration reached its nadir when former University President Thomas LeBlanc introduced the 20/30 Plan to cut enrollment and boost STEM – faculty felt blindsided, and already-frayed relations broke down even more.
But the usual understanding of effective shared governance – and the University’s plans to improve it – leaves out students. Board Chair Grace Speights did say that officials intended to seek student input in the presidential search process, but soliciting input from the people who pay to go here has occupied a place somewhere between second-fiddle and an afterthought in the Board’s communications about moving away from unilateral decision-making.
As administrators craft a plan for how shared governance operates at GW, they must include students. Administrators should hold town hall meetings specifically for students so that both students and administrators have a defined space to have a productive discussion about important issues like the new strategic plan, student response to how the University can improve on their handling of COVID-19 on campus and have a check-in to discuss whether students’ needs are being met in the classroom.
Shared governance for students, like it is for faculty, means granting them a seat at the table when it comes to making substantial administrative decisions. It also means listening to students about their grievances with the University and providing efficient responses that show administrators are sensitive to what students need and are going through. Student-administrator town halls are one way to accomplish this, but administrators should also spend more time interacting with students on a day-to-day basis.
Although individual students are at GW for just a few years, there will always be a student body on campus, and it’s crucial that the University take its needs and views into consideration. Officials make decisions about the very character of the University, ranging from how diverse and inclusive the crop of admitted students is going to be, to what fields and majors the University prioritizes. GW’s reason for existence is more than just research and prestige – the students who choose to spend years learning here are the beating heart of the University. Not only do administrators need to understand that, but that concept should inform their decision-making to a greater degree.
To get students more involved, administrators should consider holding an application process for students who are interested in being involved in decision-making processes to apply to and ensure that a diverse pool of students is aiding administrators and faculty in providing student input.
Wrighton’s newly minted place in the GW community seems to be a step in the right direction. The most recent town hall meetings with faculty are an indication of the new administration’s intentions to move past the grievances between the GW community and LeBlanc. But administrators should continue to tinker with their ideas for the University and extend their plans for shared governance to students.

Group members said the supportive club makes climbing accessible for anyone interested. 
A group of students has turned to rock climbing to build on the sport’s core values of community and partnership inside and outside of the gym through a new student organization launched this spring. 
Roughly 100 students, who will meet about once a week to climb at a local gym in the District, have joined GW Club Climbing after two juniors founded the organization earlier this month. Club leaders said they wanted to connect students who are passionate about climbing with those who are looking for a new hobby and form of exercise.
Junior Madeleine Eichorn, the club’s president, said she has been involved in the sport for more than seven years and searched for a climbing community when she moved to D.C. as a freshman but was unable to find one at GW. She said she wanted to begin the club her freshman year to offer students the opportunity to find the same community she found through climbing, but the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted her plans.  
“You have this whole mix of people, but everybody’s united by this sport,” she said. “So I think I found that beautiful. I just kind of joined this community, and so it’s nice because wherever I go, I can find a climbing gym. And I’m just instantly welcomed there, and it’s so great.”
Eichorn said she secured a job as a climbing instructor at Movement Crystal City, a rock climbing gym in Arlington, and was inspired to start the club after noticing many students using the Virginia gym. She said the club is currently working out a deal with the gym to secure memberships for students to use the rock climbing facility, and the University will help fund the cost.
“We’re trying to make it more accessible for people to get into climbing,” she said.
She said the club hosted informational sessions this past week and will hold tryouts later in February to assess which students have time available to dedicate to the team. She said she is working to upgrade the organization to a club sport at GW, and she’s communicating with teams at Georgetown and American universities about hosting competitions.
“I want to expose as many people to the sport as possible because it is really fun,” Eichorn said. “It is a really great community, and so people that are searching for that I think can really find it in the sport.”
Junior Yutong Jiang, the vice president of the club and a former Hatchet reporter, said he began climbing last year. He said he created a GroupMe for student climbers at GW after connecting with other students interested in the sport through Facebook.
“I added a couple of people that I know who are into climbing, and it just expanded from there,” he said. 
He said the sport also allows students to learn from one another through each climber’s unique style of climbing.
“You can climb and everyone can take a different path or different road and everyone has different styles,” he said. “There’s no one right answer. You can try it in many different ways and get the same result.”
Junior Avery Schmitz, a member of the club, said he met Eichorn after he started working at Movement Crystal City, and he learned he could apply his passion for climbing and join a community of climbers at GW. He said he began climbing this July with his sister and hopes the organization will help other students find a similar passion. 
“It’s not a zero-sum sport where one person wins and the other person loses,” Schmitz said. “It’s way more, at least for me and for I think a lot of people who I climb with and talk to working over at the gym, it’s very much about pushing yourself and setting your own goals.”
He said climbing with others allows for a “supportive” environment where climbers can motivate each other and build deep connections. Schmitz said the goal of the club is to make climbing accessible for anyone interested in getting involved.
“Recognizing that there are a lot of barriers to getting started whether that is gear or hard skills or stuff like that, really being able to alleviate some of those to just make climbing as accessible as possible,” Schmitz said.

Experts in data informatics said the project is an accessible compilation that can help governments improve their democracies. 
Elliott School of International Affairs researchers are continuing to track countries’ ability to govern data in areas like human rights through an online interactive map as they start the third phase of an ongoing study.
The Digital Trade and Data Governance Hub launched the Global Data Governance Mapping Project last May, and the team has completed two phases analyzing how nations are implementing policies and laws related to data governance – how countries enforce regulations and standards to manage and protect data, according to the project’s website. The research team will study more countries, collect documents about their data policies and expand its range of “indicators” to assess data governance across the globe during its third phase, according to the report on the project’s first year.
Susan Aaronson, the director of the hub and a research professor of international affairs, said the project organizes how different countries plan strategies to handle issues like human rights and national laws to assist policymakers in developing international standards for data governance.
She said addressing issues related to data governance can help with handling other problems like the potential international decline of democracy and climate change.
“I’m not saying data governance is more important than climate change, but I’m saying that if we can figure this out, we might be more successful in these other realms,” she said.
The project observes six attributes of data governance that value a nation’s strategic, regulatory, responsible, structural, participatory and international plans when it comes to data, according to the first year report.
The research team assigned numerical values to nations that fulfill criteria in each of the six attributes. Australia scored a 75 in the responsible attribute – a measure of a nation’s consideration for the implications of data governance on human rights – because it lacked the digital charter indicator – a government’s formal statement that recognizes its responsibility to uphold data governance principles, according to the project’s website.
Aaronson said richer nations like the United States did not consistently receive high scores, and national histories – including potential invasions of privacy – could do much more to influence data than wealth. Readers are encouraged to compare national scores but should understand that they are not rankings of countries’ effectiveness when it comes to data governance, according to the project’s website.
She said researchers analyzed how 51 national governments and the European Union handle data governance based on the six attributes in the first phase. She said recent grants will fund the staff members’ observations of 19 more countries, expanding the total number of countries on the map to 70.
She also said while future research will incorporate eight more factors to evaluate nations, the team is concerned that adding more indicators will make it more difficult to assess each nation’s overall performance.
“Funding is a challenge right now,” she said. “We are doing okay, but fundraising for this kind of thing is hard. It’s never easy.”
Aaronson said the data governance hub plans to hold study groups to educate trade officials from the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom on the project’s findings and hold further discussion on data governance next month.
“Changing the internet is changing the world,” she said. “It changed the economy and now it’s changing what we research, how we teach and when and what we teach.”
Experts in data informatics said the project is an accessible compilation of various data governance factors that can help national governments determine which attributes need improvement to better democracies.
Jim Samuel, the executive director of the informatics program at Rutgers University’s Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy, said the principle behind the data governance consists of national governments respecting individuals and entities’ rights associated with data like images and statements.
He said the project can analyze whether data ownership in countries is protected and motivate national governments to behave more responsibly with data governance strategies.
“If in the process of gathering this information, we are able to collect information on best practices that are implemented at various points around the world, then it might be interesting to take a careful look at those best practices and analyze where it is that the true owners rights are being protected,” he said.
Angie Raymond, the director of the Ostrom Workshop Program on Data Management and Information Governance at Indiana University, said the website uses little academic jargon, making it easy for users to understand which data governance trends are emerging in various countries.
“You can literally go to this map and say, ‘Look, here are all of the countries that are actually thinking about data governance as something that has to be part of a strategic plan,’” Raymond said.

The primary election will take place June 21.
Mayor Muriel Bowser is facing competition in her bid for reelection as D.C. mayor as a progressive D.C. Council member vies to oust the incumbent following Bowser’s eighth year in office.
At-Large Council member Robert White – a 40-year-old, fifth-generation Washingtonian who tossed his hat into the mayoral race in October – is canvassing and phone-banking to stockpile voters in the buildup to June’s Democratic primary while campaign events are on hiatus because of D.C.’s gathering restrictions during the spread of the Omicron variant. White said in an interview that he hopes to transform the District with improved education, housing and operations administration, which he hopes will change the “status quo” in the city.
White, who has two daughters, said worsening issues like rising crime, weakened transportation infrastructure and decreased affordable housing – which he said Bowser hasn’t appropriately addressed – are guiding his efforts to become mayor.
“We need a mayor who is going to be serious about helping people, which means that we need a mayor who’s going to be serious about solving some of our most endemic problems,” White said.
Ward 8 Council member Trayon White also announced his campaign for mayor in October. He gained national attention in 2018 for antisemitic remarks during a snowstorm implying a Jewish family controls the weather.
Trayon White did not return a request for an interview.
Trayon White has not released a public platform for his campaign. As Council member, he co-introduced legislation that banned the suspension of driver’s licenses because of unpaid traffic tickets and was the sole Council member to vote against legislation that mandated COVID-19 vaccination for the Council’s members and staff.
Bowser announced her campaign for re-election through a video posted to Twitter in November and emphasized her mayoral experience as a reason to trust her leadership through the end of the pandemic.
“You trusted me to lead D.C. through these unprecedented times,” Bowser said in her campaign announcement video. “I’m asking once again for your trust and your vote in the Democratic primary on June 21.”
Bowser did not return multiple requests for an interview.
Homicides and traffic fatalities spiked during the pandemic under Bowser’s leadership because of increased traffic speeds and spikes of violence. White said some of her initiatives – like the Vision Zero Initiative to end traffic deaths, which the D.C. auditor is currently investigating – are too vague in their policies and fail to fulfill their goals.
City officials unveiled a pilot program in September that would shut down three of the city’s major homeless encampments and connect residents to housing. Local advocates have criticized the plan for its lack of details, like the apartments’ quality and location, raising concerns that evictions could “criminalize” unhoused residents who decide to remain at their more familiar encampments.
White, a former congressional staffer for Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., who describes himself as a “policy guy,” said the government needs to expand citywide programs to address the root problems of issues like crime and traffic deaths, like poor infrastructure that can cause crashes.
“We’re going to have to make infrastructure changes like a network of protected bike lanes across the city, raised crosswalks and other infrastructure changes that make it safer for people who are not in automobiles,” he said.
White said he hopes to audit D.C.’s public education system, which he says is in a “crisis.” White said 75 percent of Black students are performing below grade-level, which is hurting the city’s ability to prepare students for college or career and technical education programs that ready them for high-quality jobs.
White was the first D.C. mayoral candidate to register in the city’s Fair Elections program, which passed in 2018 to reward donations from small donors with five-to-one matches and banning large donations from political action committees and corporations.
White hopes his participation in the program will show grassroots support for his campaign. Bowser is also participating in the program, according to the District’s website.
Bowser has raised about $517,000 between October and December, more than four times than White’s $117,000, according to reports from DCist.
“Traditionally, fundraising and trying to get people to vote for you can be separate things,” White said. “Now, it’s the same thing because of the same people I’m calling to say ‘Hey, will you help me fund this important campaign?’”
Trupti Patel, a Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood commissioner, said she supports White’s campaign over Bowser’s. She said students should support White because of his focus on issues like housing costs, which can help students to afford to live on or near campus.
“Students provide an economic vibrancy and viability to the city’s bottom line,” Patel said. “The idea that the students don’t contribute to this city is a false notion, and when Robert White is mayor, students will have a seat at the table.”
Patel said White’s early participation in the fair elections program shows his accountability to his voters. She said Bowser has “never given a damn” about D.C.’s residents, but White is responsive and liable to his constituents and supporters.
“What it means to me, and what it should mean to the people, is that Robert White is not for sale,” she said. “Robert White is going to be accountable to the people he elected in office.”

The testing lab’s managers are working to address a recent shortage in staff. 
Nestled on the first floor of the Science and Engineering Hall, GW’s public health lab translates community members’ bi-weekly COVID-19 nasal swabs to online test results, generally in the span of 24 to 36 hours.
Working behind the scenes, a dozen technical staff members conduct, process and report up to 3,000 tests on a daily basis. The Hatchet met with the faculty spearheading the lab’s operations and took a tour of the space to see the workings of the system at the center of the University’s COVID-19 response.
From the H Street testing trailer to your Colonial Health Center portal, here’s how GW’s public health apparatus processes your COVID-19 test:
From the test tube to the CHC portal 
Praveena Tummala, the lab’s director of laboratory operations, said staff start to receive COVID-19 tests from GW’s testing centers at about 8 a.m. every weekday. The tests first arrive in a processing room.
Tummala said lab technicians manually de-cap each test tube and extract a small amount of the tube’s liquid onto a section of a 96-well plate, a rectangular plastic dish with 96 holes to hold liquid samples.
Next, she said Hamilton Microlab STAR robotic machines dispense chemical solutions into each sample on the plate, scan the plate and kill any parts of the samples that do not contain the live coronavirus.

Lab staff said the processing room machines take up to two hours to extract both viral and human RNA from each of the plate’s 91 individual samples and five control samples, which provide a quality measure to ensure reliable results.
Before technicians transfer the samples to the main lab room, each is decontaminated to prevent exposing potential coronavirus RNA to other areas, Tummala said.
“Only the samples after everything is killed is brought outside,” she said.
Jack Villani, the lab manager, said technicians ensure each sample complies with specific criteria before they are moved, a step he called the most labor-intensive task of the day.

In the lab’s main room, Villani said the Microlab STAR robots use pipettes to distribute a chemical liquid that breaks open every cell and virus particle in each sample. He said after each sample is removed of contaminants, lab staff prepare the samples for the PCR test.
He said a Mosquito LV robot transfers the combined samples to another 96-well plate that contains chemical solutions required for PCR testing.
“What’s in that water is dissolved RNA, and that’s what we actually use for PCR testing, so all of that has to happen before we can actually do the actual test to see if any virus is present,” he said.
Villani said the PCR test detects two regions in the coronavirus gene, known as N1 and N2 primers. A positive result means a sample tested positive for both the N1 and N2 primers, while an inconclusive result means the sample tested positive for only one of the two.

To examine the reliability of the result, Villani said staff assess each sample’s amount of human RNA. An invalid result is reported when the amount is too low, requiring a second PCR test.
Villani said the assessment of a single plate usually takes five minutes to complete. He said the entire process takes a total of six to eight hours from start to finish.
“We upload the data into our lab information system that finalizes the results, and then that system reports back to Point and Click, which is the school’s health record,” he said.
Hiring, retaining and assisting staff 
Tummala, the laboratory operations director, said hiring additional staff members like lab assistants and supervisors has been a struggle because the positions are temporary and must be filled when a staff member’s term concludes. During an interview with The Hatchet in December, officials said they would increase the number of people staffing the testing operation to deal with the influx of testing appointments in January.
“The staffing has always been challenging, and even right now we are not fully staffed,” Tummala said. “We don’t have supervisors currently, so it has been quite challenging.”
Tummala said she created more part-time positions in the lab and hired two graduate students and three undergraduate students to help run tests. She said the lab team had about 15 staff members at its maximum in August but is currently made up of 12 lab assistants, associates and associate leads.
“Since we came back from the winter break, we had times when we had to work through the weekends, and our staff graciously stayed back and came on extra days,” Tummala said. “I think everyone who works here currently takes pride in doing what we do, so it’s an extremely great team.”
The University’s job postings website currently includes listings for a supervisor and a laboratory assistant for the lab.

Villani said automation in the lab, like the Microlab STAR robots, made processing large amounts of samples easy to execute and reduced staff’s physical exhaustion from repeatedly conducting the same tests and procedures.
“I think our team has always been very proud of what they do, and seeing that increased productivity I think has made them happy,” he said.
Home test kits and the future of the pandemic
Villani said the Food and Drug Administration approved the lab to create and distribute home testing kits for the University community earlier this month. He said the lab designed the kits to fit with the lab’s test processing workflow without much disruption.
He said the staff plans to primarily distribute the home testing kits to testing locations like the Virginia Science and Technology Campus to determine the kits’ reliability and their potential use on a greater scale.
Tummala said the lab team is working to improve the processing workflow to share results more quickly to University community members. She said the team is trying to extend its work hours on Fridays – apart from the normal 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and 12:30 to 9 p.m. shifts on weekdays – in hopes of accelerating community members’ results.
“We’re just trying to extend our hours a little bit,” she said. “Maybe start a little early so that way we can test and release more results throughout the day.”
Tummala said the University community’s positivity rate has improved in the past few weeks, returning to the two to four percent range from before the spread of the Omicron variant. She said while campus health is improving, she thinks another COVID-19 variant could possibly sweep across the District once again.
“Whatever it is, we are prepared to keep our GW community safe and keep testing,” she said.

We talked to local Black designers, vendors and creators who shared with us where they find inspiration for their art. 
The District’s fashion industry is booming with designers who draw inspiration from childhood, cultural influences and even D.C. streetwear.
We talked to local Black designers, vendors and creators about their artistry and what they think the D.C. fashion scene looks like today. From highlighting the nuances of their designs to recounting what high schoolers wore in D.C. back in the day, these designers shine light on the thriving fashion community in the District.
All of Starbille Cooper’s friends know her as “Star” and in the fashion business as “Star the Visionary” for her whimsical, fairytale inspired pieces she designs for her brand, Once Upon a Time.
Cooper said as she watches her daughter’s excitement when putting on a tutu or dressing like a princess, she is reminded of the childlike joy everyone should feel when they put on clothes.
“I want women to embrace their inner child,” Cooper said. “It’s OK if you want to dress over the top. You have to block out all of the noise around you, and you have to live life as if you’re living your own fairytale.”
Cooper said the fashion industry typically caters to a certain look: smaller people who require less fabric to design, usually from a nondiverse pool of models. But for Cooper’s brand, taking inspiration from designers like Rihanna, embracing diversity was a must.
“When I was selecting my models, I wanted to have someone of each race,” Cooper said. “I wanted to have someone of different heights, just because to me, that’s beautiful.”
Taseen Abdulbarr, or “The Grand V” as his friends call him, is the founder and designer of the luxury brand Linestrax. Abdulbarr described his garments as “artifacts,” saying his pieces are works of art that aren’t limited to the fashion industry.
Abdulbarr got his start hand-painting canvases and jackets in college and then transferred his designs to shoes, which got the attention of Nike footwear designer Lee Gibson. Abdulbarr’s brand, which he prides because of its originality, took off from there and he secured a feature in New York Fashion Week 2017.
“I’m all about being different and standing out,” Abdulbarr said. “I never wanted my stuff to look like anybody else’s.”
Abdulbarr said he’s faced challenges within the fashion industry when it came to advocating for originality. The creator noted disparities between larger brands unfairly taking designs from less-known designers, and he hopes to create a system of protection in the future.
“We want to make good money, and the difference between that is that people can make money copying off somebody or stealing,” Abdulbarr said. “But good money is making your work but also changing things in the process.”
Delight Dzansi creates African prints for her brand alkeBULAN. The Ghana-born designer recently graduated from the University of Maryland and currently works in the District in international development.
Dzansi said she created her brand because she noticed getting authentic prints from Africa proved difficult for people in her church. This was because of the logistical inaccessibility of finding someone traveling to Africa to bring them back.
Dzansi said with the creation of her brand, she has noticed a surge in people’s desire to wear African prints to represent their history and culture through fashion.
“A lot of Africans have been waking up to that and also just want to represent where they’re coming from and not shy away from it,” Dzansi said.
She said one of the first fashion shows she was invited to featured all Black designers.
“I was appreciative of trying to get minorities involved because I know we don’t get that much of a platform because if you see New York fashion, Paris fashion, you don’t really see people who look like me,” Dzansi said.
Founder of the fashion brand Generation Typo Doncel Brown started out as a graphic designer and had the idea for the brand after noticing a disconnect and prejudice between generations.
All of his designs feature a signature red line meant to represent the ‘typo’ and the labeling of people as mistakes because of differing beliefs or identity. Being able to integrate this messaging into his brand is a big part of what Brown said streetwear is about.
“Streetwear has become more so of a movement and culture, and it’s more about the messaging behind it,” Brown said. “It kind of breaks down some of these stigmas of who you are supposed to be versus who you actually are, to where you can wear whatever you want.”
Brown also said being based in the DMV area lends to his appreciation for the District’s fashion community as well as his own upbringing.
Growing up in D.C., Brown noticed luxury streetwear becoming a prominent trend in fashion as a teenager. He recalled the come-up, high-end sneakers like Jordans and everyday designer clothes.
“The kids coming in with the wildest designer clothes and Jordans,” Brown said. “That’s when I really learned the history of sneakers and really dived into the different brands of shoes.”
Brown said he is proud to be able to give back to the community with his brand in the form of clothing donations, which call back to his own childhood.
“I was in a shelter for the first 25 percent of my life and just seeing what my mom had to go through and knowing like, ‘Dang, I really want that cool jacket, but I don’t have $200, $300 to spend on it,’” Brown said. “Now we’re able to just give that, like, now I’m just gonna go out and it’s gonna be really cool.”
