The presidential inauguration is a hallmark event for students, but this year most of GW – let alone the entire country – won’t witness the event firsthand.
Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic and increased military presence after a violent mob of President Donald Trump’s supporters invaded the U.S. Capitol earlier this month, President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will be inaugurated in front of a limited crowd. The University also closed all offices and COVID-19 testing sites this week as the threat of violence from rioters remains, and the Foggy Bottom Campus is marked as a “green zone” restricted to residential students and businesses.
In lieu of a typical inauguration ceremony, The Hatchet dug through nearly a century of archives documenting past events. The earliest front page coverage of a presidential inauguration from The Hatchet was in 1929, when a former Board of Trustees member appeared on radio to discuss then-President Herbert Hoover’s ceremony. Some front pages, like ones for President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941 and President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1957, aren’t available in The Hatchet’s online database.
GW started to incorporate its own celebratory activities over the years – in 1949, GW held a parade honoring the day, and in 1993, the University hosted 1,300 people for its first-ever Inaugural Ball. Other issues presented more tense days, like antiwar protests at then-President Richard Nixon’s second inauguration and demonstrations over Trump’s elect.

Louie Kahn is the president of the GW College Democrats, and Josh Kutner is the chairman of the GW College Republicans.
Throughout the past century, sitting presidents who failed to be reelected have always risen to the occasion to call for unity among the American people. In 1980, then-President Jimmy Carter  urged all of his supporters to join him “in a sincere and fruitful effort to support [his] successor when he undertakes this great responsibility.” Twelve years later, then-President George H.W. Bush declared following his electoral loss that “there is important work to be done, and America must always come first. So we will get behind this new president and wish him well.” 
Yet in our present circumstances, President Donald Trump has not only neglected to call upon the American people to unite but, tragically, has continued to foment rancor and discord among his constituents, leading to a violent raid of the U.S. Capitol Building. As a direct result of his failure to lead in this pivotal moment, it falls upon each and every one of us to work to restore the bonds of trust between one another and heal our own wounds of division.
That is why today, we write in our personal capacities as leaders of the GW College Democrats and GW College Republicans to urge all members of the GW community across the political spectrum to give President-elect Joe Biden the opportunity to lead our nation as he assumes office Wednesday afternoon.
We recognize that many of you may not have supported Biden last November. Let us be clear – we are not asking that you set aside legitimate policy concerns or simply acquiesce to the new administration. On the contrary, we seek to rekindle the spirit of civil discourse and sincere debate where those who disagree politically can openly express their beliefs and be listened to earnestly. Returning to an era where good-faith discussion wins out over scoring cheap political points is the clearest path forward to addressing our nation’s present struggles.
Our country is grappling with a series of challenges and converging crises that have adversely impacted every single American. A continuation of the dysfunction and hyperpartisanship we have come accustomed to seeing from D.C. does not serve anyone’s benefit, especially during a time when millions of Americans, Democrats and Republicans alike, are crying out for leadership that can only come from public servants who prioritize the needs of their constituents and their oath to the U.S. Constitution above allegiance to any one individual or political party.
The domestic terrorists who stormed the U.S. Capitol earlier this month took the lives of brave law enforcement officers, called for the hanging of Vice President Mike Pence and put the lives of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle in grave danger as they wreaked havoc within the sacred halls of Congress. These abhorrent actions are a tragic result of public figures who irresponsibly spread baseless claims of widespread voter fraud in an effort to overturn the results of a free and fair election.
As we write this call for unity, we acknowledge that our nation cannot fully heal until those who perpetrated the Jan. 6 domestic terrorist attack on the Capitol are apprehended and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. This moment also calls for us to put our partisan allegiances aside and ensure that those who helped to incite these seditious riots face serious consequences for their actions and are held fully accountable.
It is no secret that, given our respective positions on campus, we do not agree on much politically. Yet despite our differences, we share the belief that a thriving democracy is essential to the survival of our republic. In an era many have proscribed as the “age of disinformation,” it is more important now than ever before to speak out against those who propagate conspiracy theories and act in ways that intentionally seek to corrode public trust in our institutions and the democratic process. 
When former President Bill Clinton was sworn in nearly 28 years ago, he found a note from outgoing President George H.W. Bush in the Oval Office. Bush ended his letter with words of encouragement for his successor, writing, “Your success is now our country’s success. I am rooting hard for you.”
This encounter between two political rivals is a perfect example of the peaceful transition of power which our nation has cherished for over two centuries and embodies the spirit of bipartisan cooperation which we should strive toward today. We need our leaders to put partisan differences aside and commit to working in pursuit of the best interests of the American people as we navigate through this challenging chapter in our nation’s history.
While we are sure to disagree on actions taken by the Biden administration over these next four years, we are both rooting for Biden as he takes over as the leader of the greatest country in the history of the world. We call on you to join us.

The number of complaints filed against GW Police Department officers dropped by 80 percent this year, the result of an empty campus and police reforms implemented by GWPD Chief James Tate.
For the first time ever, the GW Police Department publicly released three years of police complaint data last month, revealing a regression of citizen complaints and internal investigations that student leaders and officials said could continue to fall in the years to come.
The number of complaints and violations dropped by more than 80 percent since reaching “very high” levels in 2018, with 20 complaints falling to just two in 2020, according to the report – which documents three years of internal investigations, civilian complaints, officer violations, calls for service and arrests. Following a year highlighted by police brutality and calls for reform, GW community members said the release marks a breakthrough in enhancing transparency and mending campus police relations.

The findings show nearly every category at its highest in 2018, which yielded an above-average number of complaints, GWPD Chief James Tate said. Tate counted 20 complaints filed by citizens, 16 officer violations and 36 investigations in 2018.
“Those numbers are very high for a police department this size,” Tate said. “Typically you do not see that number of complaints being investigated in a police department that’s less than 100 people. Those numbers are very high.”
The complaint levels in 2018 came as GWPD faced rapid turnover when its chief resigned.
Tate attributes part of 2018’s totals to a miscalculation of investigations, half of which he estimates are related to human resources matters including management or personnel issues, like coming into work late. He said the investigations were evenly split between complaints from students, faculty, staff and GWPD employees.
Since 2018, the annual figures have dropped off, the data show. In 2019, department violations shrunk to nine incidents, and investigations and civilian complaints were cut in half. In 2020, the data reports just two civilian complaints, three investigations and three violations.
Tate said officer violations, listed as “sustained complaints” in the data, often lead to written or verbal counseling before suspension or termination.
He said an officer was terminated last year following a patrol vehicle crash involving “a significant amount of damage” but no injuries. The two other investigations in 2020 involved an officer being placed on administrative leave after appearing to push a student down a flight of stairs and a community member complaining that an officer didn’t handle an issue with enough “care and concern,” which led to “corrective and disciplinary action,” Tate said.
The report comes as Tate has prioritized restoring community relations and building trust with students after joining GWPD last year. He has implemented body-worn cameras and training reforms, heightened training hours and scheduled the department’s first-ever racial-profiling report for March.
Tate participated in community discussions this summer, pledging to enhance “woefully inadequate” officer training.
“Leadership starts at the top, and I have to model that behavior that I expect our officers to model,” Tate said. “And then, of course, I expect that type of behavior and interaction with the community to permeate all the way through our department.”
Devon Bradley, the president of the Black Student Union, said he was “very pleased” to see complaints regress over the years and read the data after Tate shared it with BSU and the Student Association last month. Bradley noted the data’s release as “progress” for the future and said he wasn’t surprised by the regression given Tate’s “dedication to transparency and our safety.”
“It may not be perfect right now, but I know that Chief Tate, GWPD and GW can get there,” he said.
Bradley said Tate has involved him and other BSU members in discussions about how the department can continue to unify students with police, inviting Bradley to serve on a hiring panel for a GWPD commander in July. He said Tate’s relationship with BSU improves upon a “lack of leadership” and a “lackluster culture” within the department before 2018, when such opportunities weren’t available.
“I’m happy that Chief Tate keeps us updated and at the table,” he said. “I can’t emphasize how imperative that is and how it prevents some of the issues between students and police officers on our campus.”
Bradley said Black students on campus have faced these departmental issues in the past, often when GWPD officers would stop Black students on campus and ask for ID. Bradley said he and many other Black students have come to terms with the encounters that he describes as a “microaggression,” and he isn’t aware of students filing any related complaints.
He said GWPD should continue releasing the complaint data in future years so officers can continue to build trust with students. Bradley said officials he’s spoken with have been open to the idea of releasing a more “comprehensive” report that details who was arrested and any related safety concerns regarding violent crime.
“Students are going to trust their leaders,” he said. “They’re going to trust Chief Tate, and this officer and that officer, and that’s really what they’re supposed to be seen as – authority figures. But if the trust isn’t there, they can’t do their job.”
Senior Kent Trespalacios – a member of the Division of Safety and Facilities’ Student Advisory Board, which launched in 2018 to improve student relations with GWPD officers – said he was “taken aback” after reviewing the data’s 2018 figures, noting more complaints than he would guess given the department’s size of fewer than 100 officers. He said the 2019 totals seemed closer to what he would expect from GWPD.
“I was surprised that it was at that level because from my understanding, before seeing these numbers, if I were asked, I would suspect that the number of complaints would be very low considering the size of the police department,” he said.
Trespalacios attributed the low count in 2020 to a relatively empty campus during the COVID-19 pandemic and the training reforms Tate implemented, and he expects the totals to stay low in the years ahead.
“Seeing the raw numbers will help dispel some of that view of misconduct and then also improve transparency that in 2020, there were three total internal investigations and so on, so I think it’s very important,” he said.

Several major themes have characterized LeBlanc's leadership at GW, from a focus on the institutional and workplace culture to the reorganization of departments in charge of research and the student experience.
University President Thomas LeBlanc arrived in Foggy Bottom less than four years ago, but he has already made a lasting impact on GW’s administration.
LeBlanc quickly identified improving institutional culture, philanthropy, the student experience, the medical enterprise and research as his five top initiatives as GW president, and he has since led major restructuring efforts in the departments overseeing each of these areas. Since his arrival in August 2017, LeBlanc has overseen the hiring of both of GW’s executive vice presidents, seven of GW’s nine vice presidents and seven of the University’s 11 deans.

“We wanted to hire very talented leaders, and we were committed to diversity,” LeBlanc said in an interview Friday. “I think the results bear that out, and I’m very proud of that. I think we’ll continue along those lines as we move forward.”
Seven months after arriving at GW, LeBlanc announced the hiring of Mark Diaz as GW’s first Hispanic chief financial officer and executive vice president in February 2018, replacing Lou Katz. Diaz served under LeBlanc at the University of Miami in budget-related roles for a combined 12 years and has now worked with LeBlanc on implementing his top initiatives since coming to GW.
“Mark Diaz is a very, very talented academic leadership executive,” LeBlanc said. “He has a broad range of experience, a broad range of skills. He is trained professionally as an accountant, but he has extensive professional experience in the health care system.”
Diaz has overseen restructurings of multiple administrative units across GW, many of which were implemented in part as cost-saving measures during the pandemic.
“He’s been a great addition to the leadership team,” LeBlanc said of Diaz. “He has done some restructuring of his organization, and I think it’s benefited the University. He had to very quickly get his hands around a complex financial enterprise.”
Here’s how LeBlanc’s hires have shaped each of his strategic initiatives:
Institutional culture
Diaz and LeBlanc oversaw a broad overhaul of human resources as part of a push to improve GW’s institutional culture.
But LeBlanc’s institutional culture initiative has been met with criticism from some faculty, who raised concerns about the cost of GW’s partnership with the Disney Institute as part of the initiative. Officials have repeatedly declined to provide the cost of the partnership, which concluded last fall.
“When it came time to address HR, one of the things – and this is an observation that Mark made – is people are the most important resource at any university,” LeBlanc said. “And we ought to be clear that we’re sending a message that we believe very strongly in the value of our people.”
LeBlanc and Diaz announced the hiring of Dana Bradley, the then-associate vice president for human resources at Northwestern University, as GW’s first-ever chief people officer in July 2019 to manage the overhaul. Bradley has also served as a member of the Culture Leadership Team, which oversaw the institutional culture initiative.
“We were able to recruit Dana Bradley, who has extensive experience in higher education at first-rate institutions, to come in and make sure we promulgated a value around our people,” LeBlanc said.
Philanthropy
LeBlanc and Diaz have also overseen a restructuring of the Division of Development and Alumni Relations since LeBlanc hired Donna Arbide to lead the unit in late 2017. Arbide also arrived at GW after working at Miami.
“Donna came on board with a strategy to try to engage more alumni and to very much focus on, outside of the next campaign, building a structure that would have helped deliver a future campaign,” LeBlanc said. “And she’s worked hard to do that, I would say the first few years, including the pandemic year. We’ve done remarkably successfully in terms of fundraising despite all the challenges that we face.”
GW has experienced some of its best fundraising years since LeBlanc and Arbide’s arrivals while struggling to improve the University’s alumni giving rate, which has historically lagged behind most peer schools.
“It really was the question of ‘We’ve just finished this campaign, there’s a certain amount of donor fatigue because we’ve worked very hard to tap every donor for this campaign, we still have as an institution a relatively low alumni giving rate compared to some of our schools that were more successful in the campaign and some of the others, so what do we do next?’” LeBlanc said.
Research
LeBlanc replaced former Provost Forrest Maltzman, who announced he would step down near the end of LeBlanc’s second academic year, with Brian Blake, GW’s first Black provost. Blake, who had served as Drexel University’s provost, had worked under LeBlanc at Miami.
Since Blake’s arrival in November 2019, he has worked with LeBlanc to transform how the University manages research.
Officials announced they would transition to a decentralized “pod” research model in August following an extensive review of GW’s research practices. Administrators simultaneously announced at the time that Vice President for Research Robert Miller would step down to take a role in SMHS, and Blake would oversee research initiatives in the interim before a new research vice president is hired.
Student Experience
During his first year, LeBlanc integrated GW’s student affairs and enrollment divisions into a unified Office of Enrollment and the Student Experience, which houses a variety of departments like the Office of Student Success and the Office of Student Systems, Services and Analytics.
Ever since he identified improving the student experience as one of his top priorities, LeBlanc has overseen the realignment of various student affairs and enrollment offices and brought new leadership to Foggy Bottom dedicated to the initiative.
LeBlanc hired Cissy Petty as GW’s first dean of the student experience, who later took on more responsibilities upon being named the vice president of student affairs and dean of students in August 2019.
“With the launching of the student experience initiative that I did, I wanted to make sure that the voice of the student experience was at the leadership table and that’s ultimately what caused me to promote Cissy,” LeBlanc said.
In her expanded role, Petty serves as a member of the University Leadership Council, a group led by LeBlanc that includes deans, vice presidents and a few other top officials. LeBlanc said the group enables a “unified institutional leadership group” to guide high-level decision making.
Officials announced Jay Goff as the vice provost for enrollment and student success in June 2020, who has since overseen GW’s enrollment strategy during the coronavirus pandemic and managed the financial aid office and the Office of Student Success.
Medical enterprise
Officials sought to strengthen the Medical Faculty Associates as part of the medical enterprise initiative, leading the MFA to restructure its relationship with the University and provide GW more administrative responsibilities in December 2018.
“This new structure will help the University stabilize the MFA financially and more strategically align the clinical and academic missions,” LeBlanc said at the time.
Officials announced the hiring of Barbara Lee Bass as the first female dean of the School of Medicine and Health Sciences and vice president for health affairs in August 2019, replacing Jeffrey Akman. In her role, Bass is responsible for overseeing the MFA as chief executive officer.

Students said mundane experiences like a trip to the grocery store or a ride on the Metro feel unsafe when unmasked pro-Trump protesters armed with weapons or combat gear are in the vicinity.
The day before junior Mae McGrath planned to return to D.C., she watched a mob supporting President Donald Trump storm the U.S. Capitol on TV.
McGrath said the insurrection prompted her to push back her return date and stay inside during Inauguration Day events as threats of violence and the spread of COVID-19 remain. She said living in the District the last few weeks has been “nerve-wracking,” citing an increased military presence around campus and the potential to contract the coronavirus. 
“I’ve been seeing big groups of Trump supporters wandering around, and they’re always pretty threatening and not wearing masks, which just isn’t safe, obviously,” McGrath said. 
In interviews, more than 10 students living in D.C. said the riot at the Capitol left them “anxious” about being in the District and halted their plans to attend the presidential inauguration. Nine students said they will stock up on groceries for the week and remain in their residence halls or apartments come Wednesday in case any protests against President-elect Joe Biden turn violent. 
“Especially after last week, I just really have no idea what is going to go down on inauguration,” McGrath said. “It could escalate to the level of the Capitol last week or potentially even worse. So that’s probably my No. 1 concern.”
Administrators announced all offices and Foggy Bottom COVID-19 testing sites will close during the inauguration out of caution. D.C. officials have made similar moves to quell residents’ anxieties through many street closures and a text hotline for public safety updates.
Junior Louie Kahn, the president of GW College Democrats, said the organization is planning virtual events, like a virtual inaugural ball, instead of going to in-person inauguration events Wednesday. He said he was planning to attend the inauguration but instead will be staying indoors at his apartment and off the streets in light of the Capitol attack.
Kahn said he is “disheartened” that Biden’s inauguration won’t be able to proceed like those in the past. But he added that he is more worried about Trump not facilitating a peaceful transfer of power. 
“Of course, there will be more inaugurations in our lifetime, assuming that all goes well,” he said. “But for me, it’s really just the fact that this country is in the position where we can’t have this kind of event.”
Gabriella Spina, a freshman and a Hatchet reporter, said her parents originally wanted to pick her up from her off-campus apartment before the inauguration this week after hearing reports of bombs placed near the Capitol. She said she and her parents ultimately decided she would remain in D.C. to avoid the risk of contracting or spreading COVID-19, and she will stay inside on Inauguration Day.
Spina said she and her roommates will stock up on frozen food before Wednesday in case stores are shut down during the week. She said she is “worried” because the National Guard has deployed thousands of troops to the District, which brings more people to D.C. and may increase the spread of the coronavirus.
“You’re going to have people there supporting the transition, people that are not supporting the transition, and one subset of those people are known to not particularly follow COVID precautions,” Spina said. “I didn’t want to be in such close proximity to a place where there’s going to be a ton of people. You can never guarantee that everyone’s going to wear a mask.”
Junior Drew Amstutz said he was “looking forward” to the inauguration prior to the riots, but instead of attending the inaugural events, he decided to go into work at his job at the Pentagon City Mall in Arlington, Virginia. He said he is “concerned” about traveling to work that day, especially since the Metro was “flooded” with crowds of people on the day of the Capitol riot, calling his commute that day the “scariest Metro experience” he ever had.
“All the trains coming from Virginia into D.C. were packed shoulder-to-shoulder with people without masks on, wearing either forms of red or camouflage or giant flags,” Amstutz said. “Some people had rods and all these dangerous-looking things with backpacks or bulletproof vests on and stuff like that.”
But while many of their classmates plan to avoid Capitol Hill on Inauguration Day, two roommates are determined to catch a glimpse of the quadrennial swearing-in ceremony.
Sophomore Ashley Lomasney said she and her roommate want to walk “as close as possible” to the National Mall to celebrate Biden’s inauguration. Lomasney and her roommate said they will take safety precautions by wearing masks and following news updates and any city warnings of potential unrest in the wake of the Capitol riot.
“Being online for three semesters now is partially Donald Trump’s fault because of his response and his supporters’ response [to the COVID-19 pandemic],” Lomasney said. “I wanted to go to the inauguration anyway just because I felt he took in-person classes from me – they can’t take the inauguration for me.”

GW researchers are involved in more than 90 projects related to COVID-19 amid a record-high number of invention disclosures and patents filed by GW affiliates this year.
Officials doled out more money on research expenditures last calendar year than any other year in University history, Provost Brian Blake said at a Faculty Senate meeting Friday.
Blake said GW’s researchers had a “phenomenal” year despite the pandemic and ended up spending more than $200 million on research projects. He said GW had a “record year” of invention disclosures and patents in 2020, and the number of GW-authored documents and citations of work done by GW researchers reached a 10-year high.
“Our researchers, our faculty remain very ambitious,” Blake said. “I’m using the word very hungry because they’re still going after awards. They’re pushing us, and I absolutely welcome that push to make this infrastructure the best it can be because I think the sky is the limit.”
GW researchers are involved in more than 90 active research projects related to COVID-19, 11 COVID-19 research trials, 64 externally sponsored awards, 111 pending grant proposals and 12 projects supported by GW’s COVID-19 research fund, Blake said. GW has been involved in a clinical trial for the Moderna, Inc. vaccine since last August and was named vaccine distribution site last December.
He said despite the University’s strong research year, officials need to create a “forward-looking” strategy to accelerate research and implement “effective” processes before and after research funding is awarded. He said he wants to find a research strategy that works for all areas of the University’s research profile and wants to avoid framing the process as a competition between “winners and losers.”
“When we talk about who we want to be from a research perspective, that’s not really well crafted right now,” he said.
Blake also provided an update on the University’s ecosystem research review, which officials have been conducting since September 2018. Officials released phase one of the review in April 2019, which included recommendations like improvements in communication among faculty, staff and students and new training sessions on research policies.
Blake said officials have addressed 59 of the 84 recommendations included in phase one of the report. He said officials have addressed nine of the 83 recommendations from phase two of the report, which officials released last May.
Blake also provided an update on the amount of money officials spent on intramural funding programs, like the Cross-Disciplinary Research Fund and the University Facilitating Fund. He said since fiscal year 2017, the UFF has awarded $2.1 million and UFF-funded projects have secured more than $16 million in external funding.
Blake said he is working with faculty members to fill the position of vice provost for research, a role he is currently serving in part time. He said he held off conducting the search last fall due to the budget mitigation steps that officials had taken but is moving forward with it now since the budget is “more defined.”
“I was hesitant to start that search in the fall because I knew we were mitigating – we didn’t have much certainty,” Blake said. “At this point, we’re actually in a position where we actually have a budget more defined now. So it’s a possibility to kind of move forward.”
Kausik Sarkar, a faculty senator and co-chair of the senate’s research committee, said there have been some organizational issues with the University’s pod model for research, which officials instituted at the beginning of the year.
“There are issues about the pod models, which we are still trying to get a sense of how it is working,” he said. “And I think the pod leaders, the three leaders, have really shown extraordinary courage and commitment to make it work.”

Without further stimulus from the federal government, the planned cuts may enter effect in 2022, WMATA officials said.
Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority officials plan to dodge devastating service cuts for now, thanks to the agency’s $610 million in funding from the federal COVID-19 stimulus package.
After proposing a bundle of service cuts late last year to plug a budget fallout resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, Metro officials said they plan to resume regular service in 2021. The funding will help the agency avert cuts they planned to implement in fiscal year 2022, like eliminating weekend service and shutting down 19 stations, but local leaders said they may need to revisit the cuts in the future without more federal funding.
Metro board members said they plan to delay any potential budget cuts through 2021, but they might start scaling back service in January 2022 without any further relief from the federal government. President-elect Joe Biden’s recently outlined $1.9 trillion stimulus package allots $20 billion for public transportation – a potential beacon for WMATA’s budget outlook, DCist reported.
Local leaders said avoiding the complete elimination of rail and bus service in the future will help save commuters from losing a local transportation asset in Foggy Bottom and D.C.
Senior Yannik Omictin, a member of the Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission, said he hopes Metro officials weigh “equity” and “inequality” when deciding how to maintain service around the D.C. area, including areas with fewer Metro stops than in Ward 2.
“It just goes without saying that anyone in the community that’s already vulnerable is made even more vulnerable by reductions in service,” he said.
Omictin said WMATA officials should include local ANCs in budget talks for FY 2022, even though it’s unusual for the agency to factor neighborhood voices in its decision-making process, typically compounded with state and city leaders.
Metro officials reinstated the collection of Metrobus fares last month to start clawing back funds for the agency’s budget deficits – a measure Omictin said has disadvantaged low-income residents who commute as service industry employees. He said Metro officials should focus on maintaining Metrobus service to account for those employees’ transit access.
Omicitin, who supports implementing a discounted student Metro pass, said while he still plans on “getting transit as close to free as possible for as many folks as possible,” he’s “not super optimistic” about passing the initiative in the near future given WMATA’s financial fallout during the pandemic.
John George, the president of the Foggy Bottom Association, said Metrorail and Metrobus are assets to people commuting to and from the local neighborhood near campus. He said he’s “thankful” for the federal stimulus package because it alleviates worry from community members who rely on public transportation.
“Metrorail and Metrobus are vital to the Foggy Bottom and West End communities,” he said. “They serve a significant purpose in transporting our residents to wherever they’re going, as well as members from the metropolitan area coming into Foggy Bottom.”
He said officials should avoid completely eliminating any area of the agency’s service and instead direct any necessary cuts to a reduction of hours – still a “distressing” measure but one that would keep weekend service, rail stops and bus routes from shutting down. Metro officials shuttered 19 stations during the first outbreak of COVID-19 in D.C. in March.
“If it needs to operate under reduced hours, I understand that,” he said. “If it needs to operate under reduced frequency, I think that’s an unfortunate consequence, but let’s face it – I think we’re all having to sacrifice some things.”
WMATA spokesperson Ian Jannetta deferred an initial request for comment to Thursday’s board meeting, where members discussed budget planning for FY 2022.
Transportation experts said the Metro should try limiting cuts as much as possible and execute necessary service reductions that will bear minimal weight on low-income commuters.
Nigel Wilson, a professor emeritus of civil engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said WMATA officials should use its federal aid “as a bridge” to revamped service standards and economic redevelopment.
“When ridership comes back, I think they really have to think of this as the federal assistance, providing a bridge to maintain service that will be needed in the medium-to-long run and avoid the pain and suffering for people who depend on public transport,” he said.
Wilson, who specializes in research on urban transportation systems, said there is a “misperception” about the danger of using a transit system during the COVID-19 pandemic, and WMATA officials should try convincing local commuters of the transit system’s safety. WMATA reports daily ridership numbers and employee COVID-19 cases but also pledges a “health and safety commitment” and publicizes cleaning protocol amid the pandemic.
Other major transit agencies in cities like New York and Boston publish COVID-19 health guidelines on their website, including safety protocol and sanitation efforts.
“It’s important that they debunk the myths that are going around that public transport is a significant spreader of infection,” Wilson said. “I don’t believe that’s true, again, as long as people wear masks and as long as the density isn’t super high.”
He said agencies across the country will recover, but their ridership might take a year or two to fully return to normal levels.
Baruch Feigenbaum – the senior managing director of transportation policy at the Reason Foundation, a libertarian think tank – said canceling low-demand bus routes and reducing rail service for commuters who may still have a car would be the best ways for WMATA to save money. He said ridership could be permanently reduced because of the pandemic while private rideshare businesses could rise in popularity.
He added that contracting services to private businesses could help the agency limit costs and address budget shortfalls.
“Transit agencies are going to have to become more creative, so that could be contracting out service, that could be doing a bunch of different things, but I don’t think they can keep operating the way most of them have been operating for the past 50 years now,” he said.
WMATA will hold a final vote on the FY 2022 budget in April.

About 18 percent of the survey's respondents reported feeling isolated, while 17 percent said distractions at home hindered their ability to learn.
Student Association first-year senators presented its first report last week detailing challenges facing freshmen during online learning.
Three first-year senators released a survey in October asking the Class of 2024 about their thoughts toward online learning and how respondents want to improve their “virtual learning experience,” according to the report. The survey found that freshmen feel virtual learning has weakened their academic experience and connections with professors.
SA Sen. Jack Bloom, U-at-Large, said he and his peers felt their voices were underrepresented in the SA when the SA Senate published a statement in July – a month before first-year senators could join – supporting officials’ decision to move classes online last fall.
“A lot of us started in the context of darkness,” he said. “We felt like we weren’t being heard, and so if anything, I hope that seeing this report lets them know that we’re here, we’re listening, we care.”
The survey asked freshmen about their adaptability to college, the pros and cons of virtual learning and if they felt prepared for virtual learning this spring. The survey, which received more than 250 responses, revealed 26 percent faced “learning and organization” challenges, 18 percent felt isolated and 17 percent experienced home distractions that affected their ability to learn, according to the report.
Bloom said freshmen reported that they are struggling to form connections with the campus community. He said living on campus during the first year of college offers experiences like meeting new people and developing relationships that can’t be simulated in the same way in an online environment.
“While returning students might have some support systems in place – great friends they met in person or professors they met in person or even just having a substantial connection to Washington, D.C., Foggy Bottom, Mount Vernon and GW – first-year students really don’t have that,” Bloom said. “And so that’s just one more additional hurdle that we’ve all had to overcome.”
First-year senators hosted a town hall for freshmen in October, also aimed at gathering students’ concerns to compile the overall report.
“We conducted the survey and the town hall to get concrete data points to support what we already thought to be the case in an empirical way,” Bloom said.
The senate passed a resolution last week calling on officials to help ease the challenges freshmen are facing by promoting student resources like academic and mental health help.
SA Sen. Charlene Richards, U-at-Large, said she plans to meet with two assistant directors from the Office of Student Life this week to encourage them to organize more freshman events that introduce the class to each other and increase promotion of Engage GW as a platform for freshmen to find student organizations.
The report recommends that student life officials promote GW Engage through newsletters with upcoming events that student organizations are hosting. The report also urges all student organizations to post all their events on Engage and reach out to freshmen with a “refresher” about how Engage operates.
Richards said she will work with officials to implement social programs to build relationships between freshmen that extend outside the realm of classes and GroupMe chats. She said she wants to organize more town hall meetings this semester dedicated to freshmen so they have a consistent forum to voice their questions and concerns.
Richards said feedback from the survey suggests freshmen felt as though officials weren’t providing students with adequate information to find and use resources, like mental health and disability support services.
“A lot of students with mental health and disability issues – they felt alienated during this whole experience,” she said. “And it felt like a lot of the resources that the University already had have not been publicized.”
The report recommends that administrators publish instructional videos for students to learn how to navigate University websites and resources, and the senators ask the Office of the Provost to pinpoint those outlets students can use to voice their concerns.
SA Sen. Yan Xu, U-at-Large, said he, Bloom and Richards plan to collaborate with student organizations like the International Affairs Society and First Generation United to create infographics and videos teaching students how to navigate University websites and resources.
“For example, I never applied for financial aid, but I believe some of the student organizations are very interested to work on that because that’s part of their advocacy, their plan,” he said.
He said the three senators plan to reach out to student organizations by the end of the month and post the videos on the SA’s website and social media and potentially on the Office of Student Life website.
Xu said they plan to host another town hall this semester as a place for freshmen to raise their questions and concerns directly to an administrator. He said he will invite officials like University President Thomas LeBlanc and Vice President of Student Affairs and Dean of Students Cissy Petty to attend the meeting.
“A town hall without an administrative person who actually makes the decisions there – it’s going to become just hearing the concerns, but we are not actually offering any solutions to the students,” Xu said. “Bringing the administrators on board is a brilliant idea.”
