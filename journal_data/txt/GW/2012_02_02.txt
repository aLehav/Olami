President Barack Obama proposed new federal policies Jan. 27 that could tie federal funding to tuition increases – a move that he hopes will encourage schools to tackle the rising issue of college affordability.
But a top University administrator remains doubtful about the impact Obama’s latest efforts will have on GW because of the University’s commitment to only inflation-level tuition increases.
Obama’s most recent proposals, issued in a speech at the University of Michigan, call for some federal aid programs – including the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant program, the Federal Perkins Loan program and Federal Work Study – to be linked to schools’ tuition rates to deter colleges from hiking up costs at students’ expense.
Currently, federal funds are allotted without regard to the rate at which tuition increases. Any changes to such policies would require approval from Congress.
The changes would be implemented based on the rate at which tuition increases annually – not the overall net tuition of each institution. Despite GW’s generally high sticker price, tuition has increased about 3 percent annually over the last four years – less than at other urban schools over the same time period – reflecting University President Steven Knapp’s priority to keep tuition costs down.
Associate Vice President for Financial Assistance Dan Small said top administrators are aware of affordability concerns, but said he couldn’t predict if or how the new policy would affect GW’s funding without more details.
Financial aid experts cited in the Jan. 30 Chronicle of Higher Education said the move would likely have more impact on public universities that have been forced to hike up tuition quickly to account for federal revenue lost during the recession.
The suggested policy “shifts aid from schools with rising tuition to those acting responsibly, focused on setting responsible tuition policy, providing good value in education and ensuring that higher numbers of low-income students complete their education,” according to a White House press release.
“In this economy, there is no greater predictor of individual success than a good education,” Obama said during the visit to the University of Michigan.
Obama, who said he was dependent on scholarships and student loans to attend college himself, did not specify how much funding would be cut from schools that do not follow the directives, nor did he lay out a time frame by which he hopes Congress would act.
In his Michigan speech, Obama also reiterated ideas to reduce tuition expenses that he pitched during his most recent State of the Union address Jan. 24. His proposals – to keep student loan interest rates at 3.4 percent, double Federal Work Study jobs and extend tax credits for tuition – must also be approved by Congress. Obama encouraged students to reach out to their representatives to advocate for the changes.
Small was skeptical that Congress would vote to approve increased funding as November’s election nears.
If the policies announced last week gain approval from Congress, it is difficult to tell in what ways they could affect GW, Small said, echoing his reservations during the fall. Small said he would welcome additional federal funding, but remains unsure what to expect without more details about how increased federal money may be distributed among community, private and public institutions.
“If you really read between the lines, those increases aren’t really coming in the direction for an institution like GW,” Small said of potential boosts to Perkins and Federal Work-Study awards. The money would likely be funneled to schools new to the work study program and community colleges, Small estimated.
Specifics of the plan were intentionally left vague to allow input from colleges, Zakiya Smith, senior White House education adviser, said Tuesday, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education.
The vast majority of GW’s financial aid pool is institutionally funded rather than federally supported. The University doled out an internal aid pool of more than $142 million in the 2009 to 2010 academic year, compared to $9.1 million in federal grants and Federal Work Study funds, according to the most recent internal data available.
This year’s internal aid pool is $160 million. The Board of Trustees will vote on next year’s allotment at their meeting Feb. 10.
Obama also discussed mandating a “College Scorecard,” which would provide prospective students with a uniform document showing each college’s costs, graduation rates and potential future earnings so they could better anticipate the financial implications of attendance.
“We want a country where everybody has a chance… We don’t want to become a country where a shrinking number of Americans do really well, while a growing number barely get by,” Obama said. “That’s not the future we want.”
These initiatives come three months after Obama announced his “We Can’t Wait” campaign to rein in student loan debt, which Small said would help few GW students because they are usually able to pay off their student loans, so extensions Obama put in place would have little effect.
Some experts remain optimistic about the president’s focus on higher education. Pauline Abernathy, vice president of the Institute for College Access and Success, praised Obama’s efforts.
“By continuing to invest in Pell Grants, other need-based student aid, and well-targeted tax credits, keeping student loans affordable and manageable, and helping college hopefuls be smart consumers, the plan takes steps that directly impact college affordability for millions of American families,” Abernathy said in a Jan. 27 press release.

The Student Association is continuing its crusade against fees.
Student Association President John Richardson and Executive Vice President Ted Costigan announced Monday that printing costs in Gelman Library and Eckles Library will be lowered by two cents, an accomplishment for the executives who spent eight months lobbying for change.
And to take that fight further, the duo plans to leapfrog their cause to the University’s highest governing board. The executives will present their newly finalized fee commission report at the Board of Trustees meeting next week to advocate for reducing the burden of fees and making tuition costs more transparent.
One of the most important aspects of this debate is the ability for students and families to see a list of all the individual costs on their tuition bills.
By allowing all charges to be itemized on tuition bills and providing a detailed account of the various costs, the University will provide the community with a greater understanding of the nature of the cost of attendance. And a more transparent process will be mutually beneficial for students, families and the University as a whole.
Students, being consumers of the University, deserve to be able to clearly see what their tuition money is used for and how it is spent. Itemizing tuition costs will provide students and parents greater oversight of the charges they receive from the University.
Listing the different charges will also allow students to see if there are any mistakes in their bills. There is always the possibility that a student is charged twice for a certain service, or charged for a service they did not receive.
But taking this step also allows the University to have an honest conversation with the entire community. If students and families are made explicitly aware of the charges levied against them, then the disenchantment felt by students and families about hidden costs may decrease. Since these types of expenses are often elusive and hard to detect, they become a source of ire which can damage the University’s image.
While listing the different costs on tuition bills does create the potential for many to feel as though they are being nickel-and-dimed, with an itemized tuition students would be able to clearly evaluate the costs in their tuition.

As the job market becomes increasingly competitive, colleges and universities seek to provide graduates with even more tangible skill sets to compete in their field.
That is why it is encouraging to see new academic programs that will afford students real-world knowledge they can immediately use in the workforce.
This fall, the GW Law School will create a program to examine the future of the health care industry. As Dean Paul Schiff Berman noted, it will be critical for law graduates to remain competitive with other lawyers in the increasingly important field of health care law.
Although many law schools have been criticized for inadequately preparing their students for the legal world, adding programs that teach the most important legal topics will allow graduates to be fully prepared upon entering the profession.
In the School of Public Health and Health Services, a new graduate program in global environmental health beginning next semester will provide students with practical skills.
The program, headed by assistant professor of environmental and occupational health Jay Graham, will seek to connect the marketing and science aspects of global public health projects.
By doing this, Graham believes that students will be better suited to deal with the global public health issues they will likely face in the profession.
These types of essential programs will allow students to obtain the necessary skills and knowledge required to remain competitive in the workforce today and in the future.

A student leader is eyeing the Marvin Center’s dining hub as a way to recoup student space lost in a campus reshuffle over the last year.
Dylan Pyne, chair of the Marvin Center Governing Board, has been lobbying administrators to replace the decade-old furniture in Columbian Square, the building’s cafeteria, to turn it into a place where students can do more than just eat.
New tables and chairs and extra couches for the square would further reinvent the campus dining center, the senior said, after its venues underwent comprehensive changes last summer to draw more students to the area. He hopes to see new furnishings by the end of this summer, a change that depends on the outcome of talks with administrators over the next few weeks.
The latest furniture upgrade came to the Metro Diner, an eatery added to J Street over the summer that features more than a dozen armchairs as well as a cluster of high tables and stools. Pyne said students have been pleased with the diner’s seating options.
The building’s managers began conversations about replacing Columbian Square’s 15-year-old furniture last fall, Pyne said, and he has continued to urge them to consider the growing use of J Street as a student lounge as other areas on campus are repurposed.
He said the University has “encroached” on student space in the Marvin Center with this January’s closing of the Hippodrome, a bowling and billiards area, and last spring’s shuttering of WOW Cafe & Wingery, a burger and wings joint. The Fishbowl, a student lounge located at G and 21 streets, also closed this fall.
“There’s a real opportunity here to make a solely-student space. I’m working really closely with the administration to make sure it gets the attention it deserves because it’s the last student space we have left,” Pyne said.
The University announced in January that the former Hippodrome location on the building’s fifth floor would not include community space for student organizations, a move that spurred Pyne to lobby more aggressively for lounge space in Columbian Square. After its overhaul this summer, the fifth floor will likely include Career Services and the International Services Office, the project’s coordinator Chris Deering said in January.
At the board’s meeting in late January, Marvin Center staff talked about replacing the dining area’s furniture and adding soft seating to the upper level of Columbian Square near the room’s windows facing 21st Street. Anya Hughes, deputy director of Campus Support Services, said the team is “trying to see what sort of funding is available” and will have an update on the project early this month.
Hughes declined to comment on the estimated cost for new seating.
Pyne and Aria Varasteh, another member of the Marvin Center Governing Board, said they are seeking to meet the dual needs of Columbian Square as a dining hall and student activity space.
Varasteh wants to see a setup that can be used by faculty and staff during the busy lunch and dinner hours and by students during late nights. He also said the University should look into replacing the tables and chairs with softer seating on the weekends when the eateries are closed.
“While we are considering opportunities to enhance the use of Columbian Square, to make it a more comfortable space, there are no specific plans with regards to new construction or additional furniture at this time,” Managing Director of Campus Support Services Nancy Haaga said, declining to provide details of the efforts.
“We will continue to discuss and listen to ideas on potential future enhancements to the space,” she added.
Haaga said the office was hesitant to refurbish the area because of the limited popularity of previous changes.
“This fall we included new soft seating in the Metro Diner, but have only seen a modest level of use of that seating during evening and weekends,” Haaga said.
Freshman Kara Grandin said she doesn’t usually eat at J Street, but she often does work at the dining hub between classes.
“I may go there more if couches were there,” Grandin said.

Professors, parents, students and school administrators have long debated whether or not laptops are a beneficial learning tool, but it is time for that debate to end.
Laptops are a fundamental learning instrument needed in most classroom settings. Those illuminated apples on Macs signal how much potential classroom learning can have beyond scratching a pencil on paper.
So many college classes at GW  study current events and require analysis of developing stories. Having a laptop enables students to quickly pull up articles and access information to contribute to class discussion in a dynamic way.
I’ve seen effective interactive laptop use in classrooms, particularly in media and public affairs courses, where much of the time, the curriculum does not revolve around textbooks, but rather an ever-changing political climate.
Laptops can also bolster engineering and science courses by allowing students to interact with lectures by referring to virtual tables or graphics; moreover, many course supplements are online. Students should be able to access these during class.
Laptops are also extremely useful when it comes to documenting what is said in class. Professors and lecturers often cover so much information in such a short period of time that trying to hand-write everything that is discussed is nearly impossible.
Students who are absent from class also benefit from laptop use because they can practically access notes instantaneously. Should a student miss class, the likelihood that a peer already has the notes typed up and saved in a digital file is very high – when professors allow students to take notes electronically, that is. Sharing information becomes easier, and missing a class due to illness or an emergency becomes less problematic.
A laptop is simply an unmatched utility, but that’s not the biggest reason we should be allowed to open them up during a lecture. It is frustrating that we’ve reached a mature age and attend a school that requires a high level of academic commitment, yet we are not trusted with the ability to learn in the way that is best for us.
Not everyone is going to want to use a laptop. But the fact that those of us who do benefit from them are often prohibited from doing so is an assault on our efforts to educate ourselves and use the technology available to us today.
The classroom dynamic is no longer one of pencil sharpeners and huge binder rings; most students have more desktop folders than real ones. Our generation is constantly plugged in and takes advantage whenever it can of what the digital world offers.
Why stop progress?

The School of Business’s master of business administration program was ranked No. 79 worldwide by The Financial Times Monday – more than a 20-point drop from its most recent position.
The international business newspaper’s ranking – which was determined by collecting measures of 150 schools’ diversity, research clout and the progress of 2008 graduates – weighs salary increases and total salaries for alumni most heavily. GW’s 2008 MBA graduates earn an average annual salary of $104,814, a 104-percent increase from their pre-MBA salaries, according to alumni surveys returned to The Financial Times.
Associate Dean for MBA Programs Liesl Riddle lauded the ranking but cautioned against the significance of salaries as the primary measure of success among graduates. She added that GW MBA graduates often look toward public sector and nonprofit jobs, which skew the ranking’s salary data.
“The [Financial Times] rankings lean heavily on how financially successful people are. At GWSB, we measure our success by how our students and alumni impact their communities, not just by their salary,” Riddle said.
According to respondents to The Financial Times’ survey, 27 percent of students who graduated from GW’s MBA program in 2008 entered the finance or banking industry, 22 percent became consultants and 11 percent worked for nonprofits. The school had a higher percentage of students working in nonprofits than most schools near it in the rankings.
Salaries for alumni in the nonprofit and public service sectors were not considered in the ranking’s methodology.
After the program jumped from No. 85 to No. 57 between 2009 and 2010, the school’s former dean Susan Phillips said the ranking was a testament to its comprehensive curriculum.
A program must be internationally accredited, run for at least four consecutive years and garner survey responses from a minimum of 20 percent of its 2008 alumni to be ranked.
GW failed to reach that 20-percent participation benchmark last year, the business school’s vice dean for program and education Murat Tarimcilar said, pushing it out of the rankings.
Tarimcilar said the business school was more concerned with how it fared against U.S. competition, as it fell from No. 33 to No. 41 nationally in the ranking since 2010. He added that the schools that passed GW since then, like Pennsylvania State University, the University of Iowa and the University of Washington, saw larger average salary increases from their alumni.
Tarimcilar said the 15 non-U.S. MBA programs that entered the ranking since 2010 also led to GW’s slip. The school’s administrators have said they are looking to push the school internationally, most evident by its partnership with Renmin University in China, which launched last fall to offer a master’s of science in finance.
The school’s international business program, widely considered its top program, was ranked No. 9 when The Financial Times listed schools by subject. It was ranked No. 5 in 2010.
For the overall ranking, The Financial Times also considered criteria like the number of foreign and female students and faculty, the number of faculty with doctoral degrees and whether alumni achieved their career goals after graduation.
The top of the list has remained mostly static over the last three years with the Stanford Graduate School of Business, the Harvard Business School, the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania and the London Business School trading the top four spots.
Alumni who graduated in 2008 from those four schools saw about a 126-percent increase in salary since their pre-MBA years.
To push back against leading schools’ stranglehold on the highest spots in most rankings, Dean Doug Guthrie said GW has tried to “attract a different kind of student.”
“We’re never going to be competing head-to-head with Wharton or [NYU’s Stern Business School] on sending kids to Wall Street. We will compete with anybody on training students in the most ethical and responsible ways in fields like social responsibility and sustainability,” Guthrie said.
The business school has looked to specialize in ethics under Guthrie, who called for an undergraduate curriculum overhaul last fall to strengthen that area.
When Guthrie took over as dean in 2010, he pledged to raise the school’s graduate ranking. Since then, the school fell in this year’s The Financial Times ranking and nudged up in last year’s rankings in U.S. News & World Report and The Economist.
The school hovered around No. 70 between 2006 and 2009 in The Financial Times ranking.
In another factor to the newspaper’s rankings, the business school suffered a hit this year for its population of female students, which stood at 28 percent – far below last year’s national average of 48 percent.
GW school has looked to expand its master’s programs by launching an online MBA program next fall and an executive MBA program catered to professional athletes.
“If you think strategically about how rankings relate to things like reputation and the attraction of students, the strategy is also about points of differentiation,” Guthrie said.

Students played host to 12 musical guests this week who travelled more than 8,000 miles to share their song, dance and theatrics with the Foggy Bottom community.
Twelve cultural ambassadors between 18 and 25 years old from the Bokamoso Youth Centre in Winterveldt, South Africa are staying on campus with students as part of The South Africa Project.
Now in its ninth year, the program brings students from the Bokamoso Youth Centre for five days of cultural immersion, classes and performances at GW.
This year, the group will premiere “Take Off the Mask,” an original play written by Leslie Jacobson, professor in the Department of Theatre and Dance. The play focuses on the immense challenges facing the South African youth as they prepare for their future while still holding on to their culture and traditions.
It will also feature traditional Xhosa, Tswana and Zulu dance and song, collaborative group duets with the GW Troubadours and readings of original poetry.
“It’s a night of some contemporary stuff. It’s a night of some traditional stuff. It’s a night of music and poetry and words,” said Ariel Warmflash, a senior and student coordinator for the group’s stay.
“Take Off the Mask” was inspired during Jacobson’s ninth trip to Winterveldt this past summer and incorporates the stories, struggles, passions, dreams and cultures of the Bokamoso youth.
Jacobson and her colleague Roy Barber, from St. Andrews Episcopal School and president of the Bokamoso Youth Foundation, have been travelling to South Africa, often bringing their students along, since 2003. During their summer trips, they write and develop performance pieces about specific challenges the South African community faces, including extreme poverty, a 50-percent unemployment rate, a 25-percent HIV/AIDS infection rate, violence at home, youth pregnancy and lack of education.
The Bokamoso Youth Centre aims to combat these problems by bringing the participating youth opportunity and hope.
The South Africa Project is now sponsored by the GW Department of Theater and Dance, and with support from the department of music, Africana studies and women’s studies departments, along with the Multi-Cultural Students Association, the Bokamoso Youth Foundation, St. Andrew’s Episcopal School and The Seekers Church.
“I think of theater as a way to give voice to the voiceless, to make people who seem forgotten or not important be given their moment and their humanity,” Jacobson said.
Thapelo Mashaba, the group’s director and a facilitator at the center, said “Take Off the Mask” sends a basic message: “Be real, be yourself and do the right thing.”
“Sometimes we do some stuff to please our peers or try to be part of the group, so we put on the mask,” Mashaba said. “It’s a play about youth trying to find their success, trying to do something that is real.”
One of the Bokamoso performers, Prince Tlou, 21, said the play is about the struggles he and his peers experience back home.
“It’s just about kids who faced obstacles once they tried to reach their success,” he said. “My character is Zakes who is aspiring to become a chemical engineer, but his father gets retrenched [fired], and he has to drop out of school to take care of the family.”
Jacobson, Warmflash and junior Madeline Hendricks first introduced the play to the Bokamoso community during the summer. The students travelled to South Africa, funded by a Luther Rice Undergraduate Research Fellowship, this past summer along with 10 graduate students in the GW Art Therapy program, and program director Heidi Bardot. While there they rehearsed and refined the performance they will be debuting for the GW community at the end of their stay.
Proceeds from Friday’s performance will directly benefit the Bokamoso Youth Centre and scholarship program. Tickets are considered direct donations to Bokamoso and cost $10 for students and $30 for general admission.
“Last year we put 23 young men and women from Bokamoso into a year of college, university or vocational training,” Jacobson said.
Jacobson said that even if some organizations can boast their successes with more impressive statistics, she is proud of the foundation’s progress.
“We have this relationship now of mutual trust and respect, and, you know, I’m very happy working in this sort of microcosm, because I feel like it will radiate out,” Jacobson said.
Warmflash, who organized the group’s stay and spent her summer recording their stories as an independent research project on a Luther Rice Fellowship, emphasized that hosting isn’t just giving people breakfast in the morning and having people over at night.
“It’s the opportunity to get to know a person from another country that you would never meet under normal circumstances and that really have the opportunity to be your friend,” Warmflash said.
The performance will be held in the Dorothy Betts Marvin Theatre Feb. 3 at 7:30 p.m.

The GW Hospital began construction last week to expand its emergency department to combat the soaring number of patients over the last decade.
Plans for the 3,500-square-foot expansion, which has been in the works for about a year, correspond with a 34-percent spike in emergency room patients since 2003. The hospital’s patient spike coincides with D.C. population growth.
About 60 percent of the hospital’s patients are admitted through the emergency unit, but operations will not be disrupted during the construction, hospital communications manager Steve Taubenkibel said.
The $2.8-million upgrade will take over existing office spaces to provide additional patient care bays, as well as minor and major care bays and another triage booth “to support increasing emergency department volume,” he said.
“This project will help meet the current demand and is proposed to increase the efficiency…thus decreasing potential wait times for those patients seeking care and increasing patient satisfaction,” Taubenkibel said.
Most emergency department patients are seen within 11 minutes, he said. The spokesman declined to provide an estimate of how many minutes the expansion would shave off wait times and how many total beds would be added to the unit because the hospital would need to conduct further research to determine a figure.
Georgetown University Hospital has likewise seen a jump in patients visiting its emergency unit, “from about 22,000 patients to about 36,000 patients in the early years of the millennium,” Chief of Service for the Department of Emergency Medicine Brendan Furlong said.
Furlong said though there was a dramatic increase in patients from 2001 to 2008, figures for the past few years have remained relatively flat.
The GW Hospital’s emergency department expansion will strengthen its position “as a regional tertiary care facility by being able to accept patients more readily,” Taubenkibel said.
The project is expected to be completed by the fall.
