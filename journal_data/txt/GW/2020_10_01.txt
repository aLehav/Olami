Former Rep. Ryan Costello, R-Pa., said many viewers get their news from a source that confirms their opinions, which he said will affect what commentary people hear about the debate's events.
The Graduate School of Political Management hosted a panel to discuss reactions to the first presidential debate and its impact on the race Wednesday.
The panel consisted of two former congressmen and two students from the University of Notre Dame, who discussed their takes on the debate and how the debates can be improved in the future. Lara Brown, the director of GSPM, hosted the panel, the third installment of the school’s Frank J. Fahrenkopf and Charles T. Manatt 2020 Election Series.
Lucie Kneip – a University of Notre Dame student and vice president of BridgeND, a multi-party club that emphasizes “productive” political discourse – said those overseeing the debate need to implement reforms related to how it is conducted. She said moderators should limit the content of what is “allowed to be discussed” during a debate instead of permitting candidates to bring up “personal family matters” or insulting the intelligence of their opponent.
“We need to create a culture of productivity, which is something that was definitely missing in last night’s debate,” Kneip said. “There was almost no substance to be found whatsoever.”
Kelly Harris, another University of Notre Dame student, said she agreed with the majority in CNBC’s poll, which found that 69 percent of voters said they were “annoyed” with how the debate unraveled. She said social media focused solely on the “spectacle” of the debate since there was not much “substance” for the media to report.
“The debate lacked substance and was essentially a screaming match between the two candidates for me,” she said. “I also agree with the statement that I saw that there were no winners. America is the one who lost.”
Former Rep. Ryan Costello, R-Pa., said many viewers get their news from a source that confirms their opinions, which he said will affect what commentary people hear about the debate’s events.
“The feedback loop they’re getting is the one they already want to hear,” Costello said. “And so the ability to impact, through other people’s interpretations how an event unfolded, I think is significantly diminished from where we were 20 years ago.”
Costello said contrary to Tuesday’s debate, candidates need to be “very careful” of how they interact with their opponent on a debate stage. He said voters will view one opponent making “character assassinations” of the other as irrelevant in a time of such heightened “cultural disruption and anxiety.”
“No one needs convincing that we are in a very chaotic, difficult time for a lot of people personally,” Costello said. “And so if you’re not a president offering a helpful message with some clarity and instead you’re just whacking your opponent, I just don’t think voters are going to buy that.”
Former ambassador to India and former Rep. Tim Roemer, D-Ind., said President Donald Trump missed a “huge opportunity” to offer any “substance” in the debate. He said if Trump talked about successes from his first term and what he plans for the second term, it could have helped him attract swing voters.
“He had the opportunity to say, ‘here’s what I’ve done in my first term,’” he said. “Whether you agree with Trump or not, and I disagree with virtually everything he’s done, he could say ‘I promised the tariff trade agreements, and I did it.’”

Sunday, January 26, 2020, was a mildly cold winter day, but most people would’ve described 2020 thus far as anything but mild. Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani was assassinated, sparking World War III memes. Wildfires were raging, killing several people and decimating Australian wildlife. Impeachment hearings continued to roil D.C. The Korean Cultural Organization Executive Board was holding its once-a-term dinner that Sunday, only to be struck by the news of Kobe Bryant’s tragic death. All of these harsh realities were reflected on the drained faces of my fellow KCO e-board members.
The Korean barbecue was our way of bonding and unwinding amid the chaos. On this Sunday, the warm smoky air of soy sauce ribeye and the spicy garlic chicken kept the chills of winter and the pernicious politics far away. The camaraderie between us allowed for all of our nerves to calm. We laughed and talked about our ambitions for KCO’s upcoming spring term. But COVID-19 had yet to wreck every single event and idea we had originally envisioned, forcing the entire organization and me to rethink how we fundamentally exist and operate within the GW community.
KCO’s initial reaction to the pandemic was utter shock. Our largest event of the entire academic year – Korean Culture Night – joined the endless list of canceled events and lost networking opportunities. Because the event is KCO’s largest of the year, complete with Korean food, performances and cultural traditions, we use it as a means to compel more people to join the organization. But there was no KCN, so we had no new members or fresh applicants for the 2020-2021 e-board cycle. My roommate and I became the only upperclassmen on KCO’s leadership to keep the institutional knowledge of the organization alive, as we were the only members left that had served an entire term.
I wasn’t expecting much after a turbulent semester and not-so-stellar academics so vying for the KCO presidency felt like a reach. My internet repeatedly cut out during my interview and the committee couldn’t hear me articulate some of my points. After that, I presumed it was a done deal in someone else’s favor. But I was astonished at the decision email offering me the president position in big, bold black lettering at 9 p.m. that night. I had been selected to lead KCO through the pandemic, and I couldn’t be happier to accept this great honor.
I accepted the offer minutes after receiving the email, then the reality of this pandemic hit me. While I managed to get the strength to lead the finance division of KCO the past year, I still had the safety net of my president and now realized that was me. My previous president made the new group chat for the following year’s e-board, then left us to our own devices. I felt a deep pit in my stomach. I was finally on my own to make all these decisions and didn’t know where to start. This entire crusade was going to be a daunting task compounded by the uncharted pandemic. But I wasn’t going to back down from this fight or make the easy decision to quit as so many other veterans decided to do.
As for programming, we had to say goodbye to the normal, pre-COVID games of shoe toss and grab the “Kakao stuffed animal friend” potato sack races in the classrooms of Tompkins Hall or nearby on the National Mall. Instead, we implemented more virtual-friendly games, like Korean Culture Jeopardy, “Spykiller” and Korean Culture Kahoot. We’ve had to suspend mentorship outings in D.C. and substitute it with Zoom coffee hours. No more baked Korean Snack Sales in District House or potlucks with DMV organizations. We’re alternatively shipping Korean care packages with sealed Korean snacks.
For outreach during the pandemic, I knew we had to ramp up our social media presence. While we usually wait until fall to post anything, the police killing of George Floyd and ensuring social unrest prompted me to call an e-board meeting and take action. We kept the momentum early on from there as we planned how we wanted to present ourselves in such a radically different time. We aimed to become more personable on social media, with e-board members and I posting lengthier introductions and profile pictures on our Engage accounts. I had to publicly explain to my e-board the inner workings of GW Engage, Google Forms, the KCO Facebook page and Google Calendars while I fumbled through all the different features by myself. Confidence became a facade until I fully knew what I was doing, and I learned to be comfortable with being very uncomfortable.
Zooming together despite the echoing feedback and spotty connections, we still manage to create jokes and camaraderie during meetings I thought would never be possible over video chat. Through the fuzzy pixels and spotty audio, we’ve gotten to know each other through the little quirks of our homes that we wouldn’t have otherwise. Several strong candidates have applied to fill all of the e-board positions we feared we’d struggle to fill in fall. While this pandemic still hasn’t shown an end in sight, neither will the passion and commitment I still hold with others for KCO.

Southeast D.C.’s La Famosa offers soulful Puerto Rican cuisine, like pork mofongo in Navy Yard.
Commemorate Hispanic Heritage Month with “fast-fine” cafe eats at Southeast D.C.’s La Famosa.
Bringing “soulful” Puerto Rican food to 1300 4th St. SE, La Famosa is one of Navy Yard’s newest establishments. The restaurant doesn’t currently offer delivery or accept reservations, so show up early for either breakfast from 7 a.m. to 2p.m. or dinner from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. – people were waiting an hour for outdoor seating just 10 minutes after it opened Sunday.
The joint dubs itself as a “fast-fine” cafe, fit with homemade pastries and an espresso machine that offers Caribbean coffees throughout the day.
Like a coffee shop, I was seated at a bar-like shelf that wraps around one of the walls painted pink and green – an homage to the colorful houses that line Puerto Rican streets. La Famosa is an ideal spot to study, with a socket and USB outlet by your seat.
The restaurant uses a contact-free ordering system – after scanning a QR code to view a digital menu on your phone, you prepay your meal and drinks using a credit card, Apple Pay or Android Pay. Food and drinks are delivered to your table once you’ve placed your order.
Wanting to relive my time on Puerto Rico’s beaches, I decided to first pick one of La Famosa’s several signature concoctions. I opted for the “la pasion” cocktail ($10) – a mix of light rum, pitorro parcha, fresh lime juice and spiced demerara syrup juice. For an authentic virgin drink, you can try a “batido” ($5) – a blend of milk, ice, sugar and fresh fruit like mango or tamarind.
While relatively small, the dinner menu covered all the essentials of island-style cuisine. From what I observed, the most frequent entree being served was the “chillo frito” ($28) – a whole fried snapper accompanied with coconut rice and a spicy slaw. Other appealing dishes include the “chuleta kan-kan” ($26), a Puerto Rican-style pork chop, and the “pollo en fricasse” ($15), a chicken stew with rice.
But there’s no food that screams “Puerto Rico” like “mofongo” – a clump of mashed-up fried plantains that’s topped with chunks of juicy meat. I tried La Famosa’s pork version ($14), but there are also shrimp ($17) and vegetarian ($16) alternatives.
You may think fried plantains are sweet, but the crispy, mushed-up fruit tasted like crispy seasoned breakfast potatoes. The pork’s fat crusted around the edges, so every bite was crunchy and salty. The portion size isn’t giant, but the dish is incredibly hearty and will fill you up.
To top off any Latino dish, eat something sweet like flan ($4.50), guava “pastelillo” pastries ($3) or a “cafecito” – La Famosa’s signature coconut iced coffee ($5). I opted for the flaky, salty and sweet guava “pastelillo.”
Opening a new restaurant during the pandemic is a difficult task, let alone keeping up business. But La Famosa’s filling food and drink menu is keeping customers coming back.

As the nation continues to mourn the passing of former Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, we remember her as a true trailblazer in the legal profession who fought the noble fight for women’s rights throughout her career. But as with the death of any Supreme Court justice, the next question becomes how to fill the vacancy. 
Only six weeks out from election day, President Donald Trump nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett, even as some politicians called for him to wait until after the inauguration. A heated partisan fight is about to ensue on the question of whether or not Barrett should be confirmed. But there is a more fundamental question about whether or not Trump should have nominated anybody at all, and whether or not the U.S. Senate should attempt to confirm her, this close to the election. 
Irrespective of partisan fighting, the reality is that it is time to move forward with a Supreme Court nomination.
“While one can make an argument that Republicans have been complicit in these violations — and done nothing to attempt to reverse them — it is impossible to say that they are the source of them.”
Democrats have asserted that when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., refused to hold hearings on former President Barack Obama’s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland in 2016, he set a “new standard” for the Supreme Court nomination process. Liberals say the standard is that there should be no confirmations in a presidential election year.  They contend that McConnell is being hypocritical by violating the standard that he created. But that argument is specious.
In 2016, the “new standard” created by McConnell was not actually that there should be no Supreme Court confirmations in a presidential election year. Rather, it was that the Republicans should stick by history in not confirming a nominee of an opposing party in an election year. Republicans are sticking by history now, as well, in saying that there is nothing strange about confirming a Supreme Court nominee of a president of the same party in an election year.
There have been 29 cases in which there has been a vacancy on the Supreme Court in an election year. Nineteen of those times the Senate was controlled by the same party as the president. Seventeen of those 19 times the nominee was confirmed. Ten times the Senate was controlled by the opposing party of the president. Only one out of those 10 times was the nominee confirmed before the election. The key difference between 2016 and 2020 is that the presidency and Senate were controlled by opposing parties in 2016 and the same party in 2020. There is tremendous precedent to explain why the Republicans would confirm a nominee in the latter case but not the former.
Despite Democrats accusing Republicans of violating the norms of the Supreme Court nomination process, this is not the case. In fact, while there is no real record of Republicans undermining the fundamental norms of the court, there is a robust record of Democrats doing it. While one can make an argument that Republicans have been complicit in these violations — and done nothing to attempt to reverse them — it is impossible to say that they are the source of them.
Prior to 1987, the Supreme Court nomination process was relatively nonpartisan. Whether senators agreed or disagreed with the nominee, they voted for him or her based on their qualifications. But this changed when Democrats launched all-out partisan warfare on one of the most qualified nominees in history, Robert Bork. Bork was not confirmed, and it started a long tradition of bitterly partisan nomination processes. The fights we see today over Supreme Court nominees are relatively new and started with Democrats breaking these age-old norms.
Another time-honored norm that has been crushed is the filibuster on court nominees. In 2013, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., changed the Senate rules to only require 51 votes for any given nominee, not the 60 previously needed. This has resulted in nearly every nomination being decided by a party-line vote. Extending that precedent to Supreme Court nominees, McConnell has been able to reshape the courts in the past four years. In other words, destroying norms can have unintended consequences for the party who breaks them.                    
Going forward, some have threatened to add justices to the Supreme Court if Trump and the Republican Senate move forward with the confirmation process. But packing the court undermines the fundamental integrity and independence of the court. It is so unpopular that the people lashed out at Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1937 when he proposed it. Now, almost 85 years later, a key norm of our Republic – an independent judiciary – is under threat once again.
When we address the main objections to Trump and the Republicans moving forward with a Supreme Court nominee, we find two things. Firstly, we find that the Republicans have actually been extraordinarily consistent with precedent and history in both 2016 and 2020. Second, we find that there is no merit in the contention that Republicans want to undermine Supreme Court “norms.” It is actually Democrats who have worked to undermine the process for decades.
The bottom line is that it is time to confirm a new Supreme Court justice, without delay. The partisan bickering will continue, but we shouldn’t get caught up in the heat of the moment.

SA Sen. Thomas Falcigno, CPS-G, sponsored a resolution asking the SA president to rewrite a part of his executive order urging members of the GW community to stop donating to GW.
Updated: Oct. 1, 2020 at 11:10 a.m.
The Student Association Senate passed a resolution calling for University President Thomas LeBlanc’s “immediate” resignation at a special meeting Wednesday.
The resolution, which passed 26-2-0, presses officials to choose a replacement for LeBlanc through a committee of students, faculty and staff. Senators cited more than 20 instances that pushed them to demand LeBlanc’s resignation, including the hiring of Heather Swain, plans to cut undergraduate enrollment and LeBlanc’s use of a racially insensitive remark.
The legislation includes endorsements from more than 35 organizations, like the Faculty Association and GW College Democrats, which have made their own calls for LeBlanc to step down in recent months. 
SA President Howard Brookins was the latest student leader to ask for LeBlanc’s resignation in an executive order last week, sparking criticism from senators who said they should have been looped in on the order.
SA Sen. Gabriel Young, CCAS-U and a sponsor of the legislation, said students have felt “humiliated, ashamed and disappointed” in GW, and a lack of support for staff and faculty amid ongoing layoffs prompted the senate to draft the legislation.
“Now this begs the question: why are students so unhappy?” Young said. “Students – those who engage in academic activities are mostly involved in academia as that’s their stakeholder position. Those who engage with students are faculty, in other words, faculty are now unhappy and are influencing students.”
Senators also passed a resolution rejecting a part of Brookins’ executive order that asks for staff, faculty and students to cut off donations to GW. Senators requested that Brookins release another executive order that specifies members of the GW community should cease donations to the President’s Fund for Excellence – finances under the discretion of the GW president – until LeBlanc is no longer in office.
SA Sen. Thomas Falcigno, CPS-G and a sponsor of the resolution, said funds that are donated to GW go toward areas like scholarships, the GW Cares Fund and campus food pantries. He said the language of the order should be changed because Brookins’ original no-donation pledge would take money away from students, not LeBlanc or other top officials.
“A blanket ‘no-donation pledge’ does not hurt the University’s wallet – it hurts students,” he said. “When members of the GW community donate, they aren’t giving the University a blank check.”
Brookins said he spoke with many student organization leaders and students who all expressed “intense disapproval” of LeBlanc, but the Board of Trustees ultimately has the power to oust LeBlanc. He said University finances are a top priority for the Board, and though the pledge could potentially impact student resources, the pledge would ultimately pressure trustees to act.
“Of course, public pressure through this legislation, the media and general student organization is essential, but the only way we can level the playing field and change the governance of the school is by demonstrating that students, staff and faculty are the lifeblood of this University,” Brookins said.
Senators also heard from seven candidates to fill vacancies in the School of Nursing, School of Engineering and Applied Science and Milken Institute School of Public Health.
The senate also approved Antonio Navarello to represent the School of Nursing, Megan Freeman as the representative for the Graduate School of Education and Human Development and Mustafa Emin Oktay as a representative for the engineering school. Caroline Fuss and Connor Hounshell were also voted in as Milken representatives.
David Brothers contributed reporting. 
This post was updated to correct the following:
A previous version of the article stated one senator abstained from voting on a resolution calling for LeBlanc’s resignation. Two senators abstained.

With fall sports delayed until the spring semester, The Hatchet is checking in with head coaches from affected programs to gain insight on how each team is handling the pause on competition. Check back each week for new installments.
Men’s and women’s soccer are making the most of an nontraditional fall season, replacing competition with a slow return to practices and Zoom bonding sessions.
The Atlantic 10 postponed fall sports until the spring semester as the COVID-19 pandemic rages on. Head men’s soccer coach Craig Jones and head women’s soccer coach Michelle Demko said their teams are slowly getting back on the field to train for the upcoming season.
Here’s how the two squads are prepping for their first spring season:
Men’s soccer
With 16 of the team’s 26 rostered players returning to D.C. for the semester, Jones said the Colonials are easing into full practices.
All returning players quarantined and followed social distancing procedures to be cleared by the Colonial Health Center for training, Jones said. GW established a return to athletics and a return to play committee that mandated a phased return to athletics.
Jones said the team has recently begun using facilities and practicing in person in pods. While wearing masks and social distancing are new additions for the team’s practice regimen, Jones said the team trains in pods of position players during a normal seasons’ practices.
“It’s really slow in terms of the intensity and working back to full practices,” he said. “It has been such a long time away from the game.”
With 10 Colonials hailing from outside the United States and a couple of student-athletes on the West Coast, Jones said he and his staff have been battling timezones to keep the team connected. He added that the squad meets weekly, but after missing spontaneous visits to his office to connect with players, Jones added a weekly “coffee hour” where players can drop in and chat.
“We’re really trying to spin it and stay positive and we want to work this fall so we can win a championship in the spring,” Jones said.
Jones said he was not surprised by the decision, and the postponement gives the team something to look forward to.
“The way things were trending, it was becoming apparent that it just wasn’t going to work this fall,” Jones said. “So I’m actually glad that the decision was made in terms of the safety of us, and that’s the main thing, the safety and care of our athletes.”
Women’s soccer
Demko said 19 of her 25 athletes are back in the District, and the squad has been prioritizing social distancing measures and virtual team bonding sessions.
Practice resumed two weeks ago and the teams are divided into two separate pods, Demko said. Without a Vex to transport athletes to and from the Vern, she said the team uses two vans, one to transport the on-campus pod and one for the off-campus pod.
The pods train separately, with the first shift going from 7:30 to 8:30 a.m. and the second from 9 to 10 a.m on practice days, she said. She said the squad has also started lifting weights twice a week under the direction of strength and conditioning coach Chaz Berry.
Players are not allowed to touch equipment or set up the field for practice, and all the equipment is disinfected after workouts. Locker rooms are off limits, and players are only allowed to access bathrooms and workout areas.
Like the men’s squad, Demko set up a standing team meeting every Wednesday from 8:30 to 9:30 a.m. She said players are required to have their cameras on to connect with each other and discuss a chosen topic each meeting.
At first, the meeting topics centered on team building and leadership, but Demko she said she’s been expanding the topics to include social justice issues. In a recent meeting, players discussed the legacy of the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, she said.
“Each group was assigned a different legacy of her life, and the group had five to seven minutes to present,” Demko said. “Moving forward, we’re trying to pick topics that have social relevance and have teachable moments.”
Demko has also formed small groups of three to four players, called “accountability groups.” She said it’s easier for players to interact with smaller groups instead of 25 people in a virtual meeting.
Each week, she calls or sends an audio message to keep players who did not return to D.C. engaged.
“We need to make sure we’re getting the same kind of face time with the players that are at home, learning virtually,” Demko said.

Doctors and nurses have been relying on paper backup systems while the outages are being addressed, according to the release.
A technology security problem at the GW Hospital’s majority owner has caused “temporary disruptions” to clinical and financial operations at the company’s hospital locations, according to a release.
Universal Health Services, which oversees the GW Hospital, blamed an IT security issue for technical outages that were reported to have started Sunday morning, according to NBC. The UHS release Monday said the issue has disrupted “certain aspects” of the company’s clinical and financial operations but did not provide any details on how many facilities were affected or whether patients had to be diverted to other hospitals.
Doctors and nurses have been relying on paper backup systems while the outages are being addressed, according to the release.
“In the meantime, while this matter may result in temporary disruptions to certain aspects of our clinical and financial operations, our acute care and behavioral health facilities are utilizing their established back-up processes including offline documentation methods,” the release states. “Patient care continues to be delivered safely and effectively. At this time, we have no evidence that patient or employee data was accessed, copied or misused.”
John Riggi, a senior cybersecurity adviser to the American Hospital Association, said the issue was a “suspected ransomware attack.”
GW Hospital spokesperson Susan Griffiths could not be reached for comment about whether the issues affected GW Hospital and what hospital staff are doing to offset any possible issues.

The D.C. Office of Campaign Finance dismissed a complaint Friday that alleged Ward 2 D.C. Council member Brooke Pinto violated a campaign finance law.
Attorney Lauren Wolfe, who filed the complaint in June, alleged Pinto failed to report campaign expenditures for a $975,000 property that she used as her campaign headquarters while running in the Ward 2 special election and Democratic primary. Pinto denied the allegations, saying she planned “to initiate a sub-lease” at the location, but the COVID-19 pandemic forced her to change plans and work remotely instead of at the Q Street property.
Following OCF’s investigation into the dispute, the dismissal order states Wolfe failed to provide evidence that the property “served as a headquarters or functioned in any capacity” for Pinto’s campaign committee. Although Wolfe provided emails from Pinto that stated she planned to use the property as her campaign headquarters, OCF received evidence of later emails that canceled “in-person activity and up-coming events” at the site following the COVID-19 outbreak, according to the order for dismissal.
“Absent any actual evidence that the property at 1300 Q Street NW was utilized by the Committee as a campaign headquarters in some capacity, the complaint cannot be sustained,” the OCF order states.
The complaint put into question Pinto’s run for the Council earlier this year, through which she won the Ward 2 Democratic primary and later clinched a win in the special election to serve the remainder of former Ward 2 Council member Jack Evans’ term. Evans resigned from his seat on the Council in January following a tenure of nearly 30 years after a series of ethics investigations found he used his seat for personal gain on multiple occasions.
The dismissal comes in the midst of the buildup to the November general election, as three more candidates have joined Pinto in the race and criticized her alleged ethical lapse that they said will continue Evans’ legacy of corruption on the Council.
Pinto said in a release Saturday that the OCF’s ruling proves her campaign committed “no unsanctioned activity” before the primary and special election.
“I am gratified that OCF has completely dismissed all allegations in the complaint,” Pinto said in the release. “I look forward to continue serving the residents of Ward 2 and focusing on the important work of our city’s recovery.”
Pinto said Ward 2 voters can continue to trust her “to uphold the law and do so with the utmost in transparency.”
“From the outset of my campaign, I have paid careful attention to ethics,” she said. “Ethics have always been more important to me than politics. Our campaign plays by the rules, as the decision by OCF clearly indicates in the dismissal of the complaint.”
The dismissal order states Joseph Gonzalez, Pinto’s legal counsel, provided the OCF with several emails from February and March that show Pinto informing her campaign supporters that she had suspended in-person events before moving into the Q Street property.
In an email from March 13, Pinto told her supporters that in-person activities would be suspended for at least two weeks, which ran until Bowser’s stay-at-home order shutting down the city ended in late May, according to the order. The order states Pinto had only publicly announced plans via email to move into the Q Street property two days before the March 13 email.
Gonzalez said he’s “pleased” with the OCF’s decision to dismiss the allegations that cited “unsubstantiated sources and, in part, from innuendo and conjecture” and added to campaign expenses.
“I am disappointed that this allegation has led anyone to believe that Council member Brooke Pinto behaved with anything other than the highest regard for ethics and honesty,” he said.
Wolfe said she believes the OCF overlooked the evidence she provided in the complaint – photos that show a volunteer, balloons, yard signs and a tent decorating the exterior of the Q Street property. She said those photos from May and June indicate Pinto was able to use the area outside the building for campaign-related activities during the pandemic and should prompt city officials to further investigate Pinto’s finances.
“Everyone should know where the money behind their Council member is coming from,” Wolfe said in an interview. “Whether it’s on the D.C. Council or the president of the United States, we should know who’s behind the money of these politicians.”
Wolfe appealed the OCF’s dismissal last week, but she said she doesn’t think city officials will approve her request because she isn’t an “adverse party,” a candidate directly involved in the Ward 2 race. She said the controversy surrounding the Council member’s personal finances could be an issue that goes beyond the OCF since she believes Pinto’s wealth could influence the policy she enacts on the Council.
“The issue here is a lot greater than this OCF complaint,” Wolfe said. “I don’t think we’ve probably ever on Council seen somebody who has come from the wealth that Brooke Pinto has come from. Her family are multi-millionaires, and I think people need to seriously sit down and look at the money that is funding her family.”

Officials are postponing this year’s Faculty Assembly meeting, according to an announcement on the Faculty Senate’s website.
Officials originally scheduled the assembly’s fall meeting for Oct. 7, but the announcement states the senate’s executive committee asked University President Thomas LeBlanc to postpone the meeting to “a date to be specified later this fall.” The delay will give senate staff more time to work with Information Technologies staff to determine how to hold the meeting virtually and ensure that any votes taken during the meeting are “fair, complete and transparent,” the announcement states.
The assembly, an annual meeting of all faculty, last met in February after Sylvia Marotta-Walters, the then-chair of the senate’s executive committee, called a special meeting in light of a petition more than 20 faculty signed, calling for the senate to investigate details surrounding the University’s strategic planning process.
The announcement states that senate and IT staff have been working “extensively” to determine how to hold the meeting virtually this year, and more technical work will be needed to make the meeting “feasible.”
“Senate leadership and staff are working hard with IT personnel and the administration to identify and test reliable solutions that can allow a virtual assembly,” the announcement states. “As this work continues, a new fall 2020 date will be established for the assembly.”
