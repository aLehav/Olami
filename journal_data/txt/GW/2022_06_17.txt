For me, Juneteenth has symbolized hope since I was a young child. The holiday commemorates the emancipation of enslaved African Americans and the end of chattel slavery during the Civil War. Even though I am half Haitian and half Jamaican, I still identify with and can imagine the hope that African Americans in Galveston, Texas felt when an officer of the Union army told them they were freed from slavery on June 19, 1865. I imagine it’s the same feelings my Haitian ancestors felt on Jan. 1, 1804 and my Jamaican ancestors felt 30 years later on Aug. 1, 1834 when they each claimed their freedom, respectively. 
But Juneteenth only became a national holiday when President Joe Biden signed a bill last year recognizing it as such one year after the summer of protests over the murder of George Floyd, other police killings of Black people and continued racial injustice more broadly. Racially motivated attacks forced a similar moment of recognition for me during high school back in 2017 when I saw the cross of the Confederate flag adorning an old Georgia state flag that a student hung in my classroom. I quickly told my teacher that its presence made me feel uncomfortable, but he brushed off my concerns, saying my peer had a right to display it. My teacher eventually took the flag down, but partly due to the fresh memory of the shooting at a historically Black South Carolina church that reignited debate over displaying the flag. Without discussing why it was a symbol of hate, it was a performative move with no substance or heart. 
Removing or redesigning flags that represent white supremacy, while important, isn’t enough on its own. I fear that this type of performative activism has seeped into Juneteenth as it’s become more mainstream over the last year. Instead of engaging in empty rhetoric this Juneteenth, we must instead recognize the change still needed to address the racism that persists in this country.
Black people have come a long way in America, but more than a century and a half after the first celebration of Juneteenth, has the United States really moved forward at all? The murder of 10 Black people at the hands of a white supremacist in a Buffalo, New York grocery store last month and the murder of Patrick Lyoya by a police officer in Grand Rapids, Michigan in April show that the people in power are ignoring and fueling racism and white supremacy. Government officials have the ability to act on these issues, but they’ve historically created policies like Jim Crow laws, redlining and other forms of racial housing discrimination, restrictive abortion regulations and the Chinese Exclusion Act that oppress rather than help people.
I love Juneteenth, and I believe our country ought to celebrate it. But all of us, and especially our leaders, must remember there is more work to do. Official celebrations of Juneteenth and highly symbolic attempts to address racism can harm as much as they can help, especially when politicians use them to deflect from their own record. Black Lives Matter Plaza is a perfect example, where Mayor Muriel Bowser renamed 16th Street NW and commissioned muralists to paint yellow letters on the road amid protests for racial justice in 2020. Despite temporarily closing the new plaza to vehicle traffic, cars returned to the street in 2021 in a microcosm of Bowser’s failure to address a year-over-year increase in pedestrian deaths, especially among Black residents in Wards 7 and 8. Renaming a street does nothing to address police brutality or the deeper effects of racial inequity on safety and wellbeing, real issues that require more than a symbolic gesture to solve.
The University’s recent news that it will retire the Colonials moniker is another example of this phenomenon. The announcement came four years after students’ initial petition on the issue and more than two years after the Board of Trustees first formed a special committee to consider the renaming. Even now, we still have to wait another year for GW to choose a new name. Instead of focusing on the moniker alone, the University should make its cost of attendance more affordable for all and especially low-income students. Given that D.C. is a historically Black city, officials should work to increase the small population of Black students at GW, especially among Black men who make up only three percent of GW’s approximately 27,000 students. And in light of serious allegations that officials allowed racist behavior among students and coaches on its tennis team to go unchecked, the University needs to support Black students and other students of color rather than ignore their concerns.
I’m tired of important but ultimately meaningless gestures – we need real change at the government level and at institutions like GW. This Juneteenth, we as a nation need a reckoning not just around race relations but on housing, education, healthcare, transportation, taxes, government and immigration. Actually addressing the issues people face will transform our country, ease tensions and end political polarization. I hope you celebrate this Juneteenth with your friends and family but also think about the change you can create in your life to better help our beautiful country – support your friends, family and the people around who are struggling to deal with racism both physically and emotionally. To quote W.E.B. Du Bois, “A system cannot fail those it was never meant to protect.”

WMATA pulled all of its 7000-series railcars – the most modern of Metro's fleet – in October after a derailment near the Blue Line's Arlington Cemetery stop caused a broad safety investigation into the trains, a move which resulted in 60 percent of Metro's total fleet being removed.
The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority returned eight 7000-series trains to circulation Thursday after the carts were out of service for over 200 days following a Metro line’s derailment last year.
WMATA pulled all of its 7000-series railcars – the most modern of Metro’s fleet – in October after a derailment near the Blue Line’s Arlington Cemetery stop caused a broad safety investigation into the trains, a move which resulted in 60 percent of Metro’s total fleet being removed. WMATA officials said in a release that Metro has been training inspectors since mid-May on new protocols like daily wheel measurements to further reduce the likelihood of future derailments and downtime.
“Metro has been focused on training inspectors on the required safety processes which include daily back-to-back wheel measurements using a digital gauge,” WMATA officials said in a statement. “Metro conducted a number of pre-operational test exercises with inspectors to ensure a smooth launch of the new process.”
The eight 7000-series trains have been initially introduced to the Green and Yellow lines, with officials expecting Metro to have developed a “steady rhythm” of inspections and operations in July, when they hope to reintroduce the trains to the Blue, Orange and Silver lines.

One month into summer break, GW is changing things up. Students will soon no longer look to the Colonials moniker as their mascot. Officials abandoned their plans to offer all-you-can-eat buffet-style dining at District House. And the longtime director of the Multicultural Student Services Center is leaving the University.
To catch you up on all these developments, here’s the best and worst of this week’s headlines:
Thumbs Up:
The Board of Trustees voted to discontinue the Colonials moniker, announcing plans to pick a replacement by the start of the 2023-24 academic year. Rightfully so – student activists fought for this change for years, calling the Colonial an outdated and insensitive mascot that fueled the legacy of colonialism, a practice driven by a false belief in a superior race and explicit racism. Historically speaking, colonialism is not an icon to be admired, and the retirement of the Colonials is vital to creating a more inclusive environment on campus.  I am personally rooting for the Hippo, more accurately named the River Horse, to take its place. The Hippo is much more acceptable, remains relevant to the history of GW and is already beloved by much of the student body, as seen by the statue with ears that students rub outside Lisner Auditorium when looking for good luck.
In national news, The White House announced it would pay its interns beginning in the fall, creating a great precedent for all other internship programs, seeing as many interns in D.C. continue to go unpaid. An estimate of one million interns are unpaid by their employers, according to a University of Wisconsin-Madison study published in March. Paying interns is essential to making these opportunities more accessible to low-income applicants and removing financial barriers that cause inequities among economic classes. Moving forward, internship programs should follow suit and compensate their interns for the hard work they accomplish.
Thumbs Down:
Officials walked back their plans to open a dining hall in District House next school year, and the space will instead continue holding restaurant-style vendors. Many students planned where they wanted to live based on proximity – or lack thereof – to dining halls, and GW going back on its word complicates students’ original thoughts with meal plans. Officials claimed that the all-you-can-eat dining hall in District House was meant to address food insecurity. Now, a meal swipe, called a “meal block” by the University, will only grant students one entree, drink and side at a restaurant in District House instead of unlimited buffet-style food. Re-introducing restaurant-style vendors does the opposite of ending food insecurity – it perpetuates it.
MSSC Director Michael Tapscott is the third official to announce his departure from the University in the last month, joining Dean of Students Cissy Petty and Executive Vice President and CFO Mark Diaz. Tapscott worked at GW for nearly 19 years, supporting underprivileged and underrepresented students. His dutiful efforts to promote diversity and inclusion on campus will be missed.
The gun violence epidemic continues to rage on in D.C. A 17 year-old was fatally shot in Southeast D.C. Tuesday, and a 16 year-old was fatally shot in Northeast Sunday. Shootings of teenagers and younger people remain frequent in the District but do not receive enough attention. These preventable deaths speak to the larger issue of rising homicides and crime in the city as well as lack of gun control in the United States. Efforts like the gun violence prevention grants that Mayor Bowser awarded and bipartisan deals in the U.S. Senate must garner the support they need to end the tragedy that is the gun violence epidemic in this country.

Despite the numerous dining offerings located in The Block Foodhall, nearly everyone I saw during my visit made a beeline for Rose Ave Bakery, a testament to the pastry quality at D.C.’s hidden cafe.
Nearly every block in D.C. comes with its own coffee shop, but the hidden gem of the District’s cafe scene is the downtown Asian-American owned Rose Ave Bakery, serving innovative pastries with Asian flavors.
Despite its popularity, Rose Ave Bakery is hard to stumble upon, secluded in the back of The Block Foodhall DC on Vermont Avenue with hours limited to Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. The concealed cafe is one many visitors still know to find, and the spot’s fruit-flavored donuts and floral decor serve as quite the treat, enticing customers to come back for more.
Upon entering the food court, rainbow-colored metallic butterflies and cherry blossoms line a wall to the right covered with ivy to greet patrons. Complete in the center of the wall is a pink neon sign reading “Love DC.” On a neighboring wall, a floor-to-ceiling mural celebrating the food hall and the District displays pop art with paintings of cherry blossoms, the Washington Nationals and monuments that combine to spell “The Block.”
Though the bakery is a small-sized storefront, visitors are welcome to sit in the food court, which offers ample seating at tables, bar counters and even a covered wicker loveseat swing surrounded by blossoms and flowers off to the side. Diners looking to bask in the summer sun can also park themselves at the picnic tables outside.
Rose Ave Bakery shares the food hall with four other restaurants spread throughout the dining area, including Pogiboy, a highly-praised Filipino-American restaurant, Piccoletto, the self-proclaimed little pasta shop, Block Bar, a late-night bar open from Thursday to Sunday, and Snocream, which serves a cross between ice cream and shaved ice.
Rose Ave Bakery keeps to the floral theme of the rest of the food court, appropriately adorned with roses lining the cornered-off bakery stand. The female-run bakery, owned by a former nurse with a passion for cooking and creativity, describes its goal as providing customers with “fun, inventive and delicious” Asian-American pastries, and the establishment certainly succeeds.
The business sells a variety of pastries, but the standout is the donuts, which combine a fluffy dough with fruit, all for less than $5. The cafe additionally offers breakfast sandwiches ($4.50 to $7.50), cookies based of traditional flavors like sugar and chocolate chip with added elements like matcha and sesame ($3.25), flaky pastries known as cruffins inspired by Filipino cheese rolls ($5), fruity cake slices ($5.50), coconut mochi puffs ($4.50) and kouign amann ($4.50) – a caramelized croissant with a sweet filling like coconut sticky rice and fresh mango.
For a hot drink to enjoy alongside your sweets, try Rose Ave’s coffees and teas ($5 to $5.75). True Rose Ave Bakery enthusiasts may also purchase packs of stickers of the various pastries for $10.
On my visit, I ordered the strawberry lychee rose donut ($4.50), which arrived in a plastic container. The pastry consisted of a fluffy, doughy and generously granulated sugared base topped with a cream frosting, fresh strawberry slices and a glob of lychee, a sweet and juicy tropical fruit native to China, with rose petals on top.
The subtle sweetness of the strawberries blended well with the heavy frosting and sugar to create a saccharine taste. The dough itself had neither a hole nor filling inside, which helped balance the very sweet toppings as a more neutral flavor, preventing the donut from crossing the line into sickeningly sugary territory.
The lychee on the donut can be tough to bite, but don’t give up – pulling it off could make the donut fall apart. The fruit even adds a tang to an otherwise sweet dish, complementing the strawberry slices and frosting. Overall, the strawberry lychee rose donut provided a unique blend of sweet and tangy flavors, making it an ideal treat for someone who enjoys either taste.
I also ordered a green chai tea ($5) after my meal, which came iced and provided me with a sweet aftertaste and caffeine boost that I needed to get through the rest of my day.
Despite the numerous dining offerings located in The Block Foodhall, nearly everyone I saw during my visit made a beeline for Rose Ave Bakery, a testament to the pastry quality at D.C.’s hidden cafe.

Senators passed a resolution of appreciation for Chief Financial Officer Mark Diaz, who is slated to retire by the end of the month. 
Student Association Senators confirmed SA President Christian Zidouemba’s communications director Monday after Senators rejected the executive cabinet candidate at the previous meeting last month.
Senators voted 18-2-1 to confirm Aiza Saeed as communications director when five senators switched their vote Monday after they initially failed to meet the two-thirds majority threshold required to confirm her in their last meeting, where they cited concerns that she would not be able to connect with graduate students. Senators also passed a resolution of appreciation for Chief Financial Officer Mark Diaz, who is slated to retire by the end of the month, but rejected Zidouemba’s Cabinet Creation Act, which would have consolidated the responsibilities of multiple cabinet positions into one.
Sen. Kai Simson, CPS-G, said he did not vote for Saeed during her first nomination because he felt Saeed did not give a “substantial answer” on how to engage graduate students in the SA.
“I think that’s incredibly important as the grad senator representing grad students,” he said.
Saeed said in Monday’s meeting that she had met graduate students while she participated in women’s club basketball, so she plans to use casual events like coffee chats to “increase communication” between graduate students and undergraduates in her new role as communications director.
During the reconsideration period, senators repeated questioning on how many staff members Saeed thought she would need as communications director and how she would delegate responsibilities between her staff members. Saeed said her experience coordinating a magazine with a team of four people last summer prepared her to work with a small staff.
“I would also choose people with the same work ethic that I have,” she said. “Which is, finish your work on time, do it to the best of your ability, it should look good or whatever.”
Senators unanimously passed the EVP Diaz Appreciation Act. The Act, sponsored by Sen. Demetrius Apostolis, CCAS-U, thanks Diaz for his “more than four years of service.”
Apostolis said he wished Diaz the best in his future endeavors.
“EVP Diaz was instrumental in pushing the University through this hard time during the pandemic,” he said. “We thank him for his contribution and financial expertise throughout the last few years.”
Senators also failed to pass Zidouemba’s Cabinet Creation Act in a 9-11 vote with 1 abstention. The Act would have amended the SA bylaws to codify Zidouemba’s historically small cabinet, condensing the responsibilities of multiple positions into one and adding executive secretaries to oversee graduate student academic affairs and governmental and alumni relations.
Zidouemba said he hoped the Act would maximize the cabinet’s efficiency, “reduce confusion and increase accountability.”
“This way, all students, as well as the Senate, will have a better understanding of who’s in charge of what office and who’s responsible for what,” he said. “This approach will solve some of the problems discovered in the last year’s cabinet.”
The next Senate meeting will be held on June 27 at 8:30 p.m. over Zoom.

The donated and repurposed goods – including items such as storage organizers, dried pasta and printers – prevented 11 truckloads of goods from ending up in landfills and saved more than $17,000 in disposal and labor fees.
Students donated a total of 53,000 pounds of goods during this year’s May move-out period to local charities and nonprofit organizations, setting a record for the most items donated in the University’s Green Move-Out in its nearly 10 years of operation, according to a University release.
Student volunteers spent 472 hours sorting through 45,000 pounds of clothing, 6,000 pounds of household items and 2,100 pounds of food before sending the donations off to partnered organizations like Habitat for Humanity of Metro Maryland, Bread for the City, Green Lot and Love and Light among other charities, the release states. The donated and repurposed goods – including items such as storage organizers, dried pasta and printers – prevented 11 truckloads of goods from ending up in landfills and saved more than $17,000 in disposal and labor fees.
Volunteers ultimately filled about 1,800 bags of clothing, 115 cartloads of household goods and 700 grocery bags of food.
The University debuted the annual Green Move-Out program, which is sponsored by the Office of Sustainability, in 2014 in an effort to make student move-out more environmentally friendly and to encourage students to donate their discarded items instead of tossing them in the trash.
Kimberly Williams – the stakeholder engagement associate for the Office of Sustainability – said the purpose of Green Move-Out is to enforce the sustainability of goods, not just the sustainability of the environment.
“Sustainability is not just about the environment,” Williams said in a GW Today article. “It’s also about the economy and equity, and this program represents that. Instead of using a shower caddy, mirror or other item for only a year and then throwing it in the trash, our students give things new life by donating.”

D.C. voters will decide the Democratic candidate for mayor in next week’s primary elections, and given the city’s historic support for Democratic candidates, the vote will likely decide the city’s next mayor come November. Incumbent Mayor Muriel Bowser is facing both new and returning challengers from across the District, all of whom are looking to unseat her over residents’ concerns about education, public safety, homelessness and other issues. 
While the city may have weathered the worst of the pandemic, the next few years will test Washingtonians’ and their new mayor’s ability to address longstanding and new political issues. When we walk past homeless encampments, dodge speeding cars, struggle to pay rent, wait for delayed Metro rides, read reports of violent assaults and worry about the impact of climate change on our world and on our city, we see problems that D.C. still faces despite Bowser’s eight years in office. 
But we know our leaders can do something about each of these issues, and we believe at-Large Council member Robert White is the candidate best suited to address them – The Hatchet’s editorial board endorses Robert White as the Democratic candidate for mayor. White’s detailed proposals on issues from homelessness to bike infrastructure outline a more progressive vision of D.C., and after eight years of Bowser’s stewardship, Washingtonians need a mayor with a fresh perspective. His comprehensive and forward-looking plans would allow D.C. to move toward a more progressive and ultimately better city. 
The Hatchet’s editorial board based our decision on the issues that mattered most to us and our community, like transportation, housing costs, public safety and homelessness. We want a mayor who can address these issues but also understands where we were coming from. After reaching out to ask each candidate about their platform, Robert White’s team was the only one to respond. While White’s response to our questions was far from a deciding factor in our decisions, we felt it signified his campaign’s interest in discussion, collaboration and consultation with his constituents – especially among young people. 
The Mayor of the District of Columbia is undoubtedly a difficult position to fulfill. In the end, we had to decide between Bowser – the establishment-type Democrat who has led D.C. for the past eight years – or Robert White – a progressive with exciting ideas for the city’s future but whose time on the Council doesn’t necessarily guarantee his success in the mayor’s office. 
White’s plans on homelessness, housing, education, mayoral control of D.C.’s public schools, crime and transportation are too bold to pass up – especially when Bowser would simply provide more of the same. The progressive vision behind White’s campaign is of a more dynamic, resilient and equitable D.C. – one that has a responsive government that can support all its residents’ current and future needs. From expanding transit accessibility and building sidewalks and crosswalks that comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act to loosening mayoral control over the city’s schools and investing in affordable housing, White has an attention to detail and a capacity to care that other candidates lack. His signature proposal, a jobs guarantee program for every Washingtonian who wants one, is similarly audacious. But working to provide stable and good-paying jobs that would help D.C. residents install solar panels, plant trees and maintain urban farms in their communities represent a commitment to protect D.C. and its residents from a climate that is increasingly in crisis. 
Beyond differences in policy, White’s approach provides a marked difference from Bowser’s I-alone-can-fix-it attitude. When Greater Greater Washington asked each candidate about their plans to create priority bus lanes garnering opposition, Bowser said, “This is my plan, I will see it through.” White, a fifth-generation Washingtonian, instead stressed his ability to talk to people on both sides of the issue. D.C. residents need a mayor who will work for them and with them – not around them. 
Electing Robert White would provide an alternative to Bowser’s current vision for the District. Bowser seems fixated on her past achievements and progress, and understandably so as an incumbent candidate with a long record. Part of that record involves dealing with one of D.C.’s most notorious residents – former president Donald Trump. When police officers forcibly removed protestors from Lafayette Square in the summer of 2020 so Trump could stage a photo opportunity, Bowser renamed part of 16th Street, which leads directly to the White House, to Black Lives Matter Plaza in a show of solidarity with the protesters. But in 2022, do voters need a candidate who touts “standing up to Trump” as one of her major campaign issues? Bowser’s extensive record also includes forcibly clearing encampments with construction equipment and endangering the people living there. These policies are logically and morally wrong, and they are a stain on Bowser’s leadership. 
Regarding the other candidates, Trayon White is a tireless advocate for residents living across the Anacostia River, but his past antisemitic remarks made us question whether he can represent all Washingtonians. And James Butler’s plans for police reform combine both “tough-on-crime” and progressive ideas, but it’s unclear how those would actually work in reality. 
We look forward to covering whomever D.C.’s next mayor may be, but more importantly, we look forward to working with them to create a better city. Whether it be Robert White, Trayon White, James Butler or Muriel Bowser, the next mayor has their work cut out for them. We believe that Mayor Robert White will have what it takes to do the job.

A local governing body engaged in discussion with The Potomac Electric Power Company about renovating the F Street energy substation in a meeting Wednesday.
The Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission and representatives from Pepco discussed proposed architectural plans for a renovated substation on F Street that would decrease the size of Anniversary Park with construction on the building proposed to start in 2026. The ANC also approved several alcoholic beverage licenses for local businesses and a restaurant license for a new plant-based restaurant opening on New Hampshire Avenue called Planta Queen.
Pepco introduces plans for renovation on F Street substation
Linda Greenan, the external affairs manager for Pepco, said the F Street substation still holds functioning equipment, but the equipment needs updating because an I Street substation is set to retire in 2030. She said retiring the I Street substation means all the power that once ran through that station will now run through the F Street substation, highlighting the need for a bigger substation.
“We’re here to talk about what we’re doing and get good initial feedback,” Greenan said. “We’ve got a slide about what we’re going to be doing now, which was just to know that this is really the first of many conversations.”
The plans for the new building show Anniversary Park decreasing by about 2,000 square feet and a significant decrease in the amount of trees in the space to make room for the substation’s transmission lines.
ANC Chair Joel Causey urged Pepco to incorporate community involvement while designing the new building. He said while Anniversary Park is owned by Pepco, the community has used it for many years and continued use of the park would benefit the community.
“I know Pepco doesn’t owe us community involvement but we’d love to have some community involvement,” Commissioner Causey said.
Commissioners approve alcohol license renewals 
The commissioners unanimously approved an application for a new restaurant license for the plant-based restaurant Plant Queen. The restaurant will open on New Hampshire Avenue next to Tatte Bakery and Cafe.
The commissioners also approved several alcoholic beverage licenses for restaurants, hotels and venues including Flower Child, GW Smith Center, North Italia, Rasika, The Ritz Carlton, Nobu and more.
Commissioner Trupti Patel objected to renewing the alcohol license for Rasika because of a class-action lawsuit against the restaurant from former employees for wage theft. The renewal of the license passed with five commissioners approval and one opposition from Patel.
“I cannot exactly grant them support,” Patel said.

The Lerner Health and Wellness Center is closed until this fall for HVAC upgrades.
Following the temporary closure of the Lerner Health and Wellness Center, officials compiled on-campus exercise substitutes and off-campus gym discounts for students looking for alternative workout options.
Officials announced in May that the Lerner Health and Wellness Center would be closed for HVAC repairs from May through the middle of the fall. Lerner director Andre Julien announced in an email this week a new workout room in the University Student Center with free weights, yoga mats and self-powered rowing machines along with discounts for nearby gyms as an exercise replacement for Lerner.
The workout room, which opened on June 8, only includes “self-powered” workout equipment, according to the email. Exercise machines requiring electricity, like treadmills and stairmasters, are unavailable.
The email also directs students to Active&Fit, a student membership that gives access to 7,500 gyms for $29 per month. Students need to use their University email to access the discount.
Along with Active&Fit, the email compiles a list of seven gyms in Foggy Bottom and West End that offer discounts to university students. It further directs students to a list of walking and running routes on GW’s website. The email announces a personal trainer certification course sponsored by Campus Recreation. The course consists of a $100 participation fee and five weekly 2-hour virtual teaching sessions.
