Junior Nathan Orner, the SA's former secretary of transportation, said he wants to create an anonymous form for students to report instances of sexual assault, which would first go to the SA and later the Title IX Office to “ensure” the Title IX Office takes students’ claims “seriously.”
Junior Nathan Orner, the SA’s secretary of transportation under former Student Association President Brandon Hill, made the ballot for SA president Wednesday.
Orner, who reached the 385 signatures the Joint Elections Commission requires for SA presidential candidates, said he plans to run on a platform centered around sexual assault prevention, transparency surrounding housing decisions, pedestrian safety and updates to student organization financial allocation policies. In the race for SA president, Orner contends among a field of six other candidates including incumbent SA President Christian Zidouemba, SA Chief of Staff Keanu Rowe and Residence Hall Association President Arielle Geismar.
“To the best of my ability, I’d like to advocate for those issues,” he said. “I know that in the past, SA candidates and presidents have not necessarily held very many direct issue-based meetings, which has led to some of the most basic things that can be addressed to not get addressed. I think that if the student body as a whole, or at least as individuals and as org members and as orgs demonstrate an issue, then that issue should be addressed.”
Orner’s opponents in the race for SA president also include SA Sen. Rami Hanash Jr., GWSB-U, Mohamed Redzuan bin Mohamed Raffe, the vice president of external affairs for GW Entrepreneurship Club, and former SA senior policy adviser Edy Koenigs, whom Orner said he’s currently dating. He said though his and Koenigs’ “policy focuses” differ, they believe in each other’s ability to advocate for the student body.
“We do support each other 100 percent and each other running for SA president,” he said.
Orner, a political science major, said he plans to add therapy to GW’s student insurance plan to increase support for survivors of sexual assault on campus. GW began offering free virtual therapy in January.
Orner said he wants to create an anonymous form for students to report instances of sexual assault, which would first go to the SA and later the Title IX Office to “ensure” the Title IX Office takes students’ claims “seriously.” He said he has received complaints from students alleging the Title IX Office often fails to address reports in a timely manner.
“I would like to address that by trying to open up a form that has zero identifying information, except for when the date that the thing was filed,” he said.
Koenigs announced similar Title IX policies, including a new reporting form that would go to the SA, in her candidacy announcement on Instagram earlier this month.
Orner said he decided to run two months ago, in part inspired by his experience with housing last year wherein he unnecessarily moved across four rooms due to mold issues and “administrative issues.” Orner said he hopes to institute a policy promoting communication between students and Campus Living and Residential Education through measures like a form for students to relay their housing-related concerns.
“It’s important for us to set up a policy of being able to have open contact with students about their housing problems,” he said.
He said if elected, he plans to work with Transportation and Logistics Services to install new crosswalks and close off H Street between 22nd and 21st streets in hopes of increasing pedestrian safety on campus. He said he would advocate for new crosswalks between District House and Tatte, Western Market and University Yard and Kogan Plaza and Corcoran Hall to prevent jaywalking.
“These areas are all areas in which students have to jaywalk all the time,” he said. “I’ve done it myself, I have seen other students do it and it’s just not safe.”
Orner said he also plans to increase the number of GW Safe Rides at night. Former SA Vice President Kate Carpenter expanded Safe Ride distance last year into the 2400 M Apartments, The Flats at Dupont Circle and the Lincoln Memorial.
He said he would like to launch an investigation into why students are denied rides, especially late at night.
Orner said the allocation of funding for student organizations needs reform to ensure that even smaller student organizations are receiving money. He said he would enact a required base amount of funding of at least $200 for all student organizations to help cover administrative costs.
Twelve student organizations received none of the funding they requested in the last general allocation period.
“I would say the majority of orgs that I’ve spoken with got zero actual direct money, especially the smaller ones,” he said.
If elected, he said he plans to redistribute funds currently delegated to the SA’s food budget and put them toward student organization funding. The SA Senate publicly disclosed its spending records for the first time earlier this year, revealing that the senate allocated $4,000 for food.
Orner said he also wants to include relevant student organizations in discussions about policies that directly impact their funding, whether those discussions occur in the senate or elsewhere in the SA.
“Not only are orgs not allowed to spend money on food,” Orner said. “They are not given any money whatsoever.”
The senate amended the SA bylaws in late February to permit allocations for food that’s not restricted to cultural and religious purposes, as was the case before, though cultural food would still take precedence.
Orner said he also plans to meet with faculty department heads to make syllabi available prior to course registration so students can get an accurate understanding of the costs and coursework associated with their classes.
“Syllabi should be basically an advertisement in a certain way to know exactly what you’re getting into when you register for courses,” he said. “It shouldn’t be a surprise thing that happens a week or two after you register.”

Of 1,938 eligible voters, 720 voted in the election, a turnout of 37.2 percent, a slight increase from last year’s 31 percent participation rate.
GW Law Students elected Shallum Atkinson to be the Student Bar Association’s president during its March 10 election.
Director of Elections Sidney Lee announced at the SBA Senate meeting Tuesday that Atkinson, the current vice president of student affairs, received 60.6 percent of the votes, defeating current Finance Committee Chair John Tuley by 164 votes. SBA Sen. Kaitlin Fontana secured the vice presidency, receiving 85.8 percent of the votes and defeating 1L Leadership board member in the SBA executive cabinet Maggie Brooks.
Of 1,938 eligible voters, 720 voted in the election, a turnout of 37.2 percent, a slight increase from last year’s 31 percent participation rate.
“Congratulations to those that did run and did not secure a position,” said Executive Vice President Garrett May. “As anyone who’s been in SBA for a while can tell, there’s always ample work to go around.”
The senate agreed to allocate $2,837.69 to the Federalist Society for three of its members to attend the national student symposium on March 3 and 4 after the organization received a half-off discount from the conference. The senate unanimously agreed to allocate $2,000 to the Black Law Students Association to aid the organization in hosting a brunch and paying for gifts during graduation week.
The senate also allocated $473.80 to the Christian Legal Society to pay for travel for Brad Littlejohn, the president of the Davenant Institute — a religious think tank — to speak at an event at GW in early April about Christian nationalism and civil law.
SBA Sen. Cody Ingraham said he met with members of the University-Wide Programs Fund committee and proposed reforms to improve graduate students’ access to the fund. He said he proposed opening the fund up to events that are not University-wide but have at least 350 attendees, and he proposed increasing the promotion of events receiving UWPF funding to graduate students.
“I think we’re moving maybe towards some progress,” he said.
Ingraham, who is also a Student Association senator, said he submitted a bill to the SA Senate to urge the University’s Office of Student Life to reform the University-Wide Programs Fund and better include graduate student organizations.
The next SBA meeting will be held on April 2 at 9:15 p.m. in the Law Learning Center.

Student Association Senate Chairperson Pro Tempore Demetrius Apostolis said as vice president, he would plan to meet with each SA senator at least once to check in on their goals and ongoing work.
Student Association Senate Chairperson Pro Tempore Demetrius Apostolis, CCAS-U, became the first to announce a campaign for SA vice president Wednesday.
Apostolis, a sophomore majoring in criminal justice and history, said if elected, he plans to host regular meetings between SA leadership, students and administrators to give students an opportunity to provide input on University policies, require senators to attend student organization meetings and create a mentorship program between graduate and undergraduate students. During his time on the senate, Apostolis helped launch the Career Exploration EXPO in February and filled all senate vacancies last fall for the first time since October 2017.
He said he was inspired to run for vice president to continue building on the change the SA made this term, like the reinstitution of the career fair, which was paused during the pandemic. He said as vice president, he would pledge to attend three student organization meetings per week, and he would invite student organizations to present recent accomplishments at SA meetings to promote a sense of community.
“Our vice president and president should have the doors open, ready to talk to students,” he said.
As senate chairperson pro tempore, Apostolis is the third-highest ranking member in the SA after only the president and vice president, and he oversees filling senate vacancies and coordinating proxy votes for senators. Apostolis served as acting vice president for one week last summer while current SA Vice President Yan Xu took a medical leave of absence. During that time, Apostolis chaired the emergency senate session following an attempt to remove SA President Christian Zidouemba.
Apostolis said he hopes to host two to three meetings between students, the SA president and vice president and administrators two to three times per semester so students can deliver feedback on policies like tuition increases, curriculum requirements and University spending. The senate passed the Funding Transparency Act earlier this month, which calls on the University to disclose which companies donate more than $50,000 to the University.
“Students shouldn’t have to fight for things like financial transparency when it’s us who are paying for the school,” he said.
He said after meeting with members of academic advising teams across schools, he hopes to institute a program where graduate students can serve as academic advisers for undergraduate students.
“Graduate students normally come from other universities and other skill sets, and they’re able to help with that,” he said.
Apostolis said he plans to install a green screen in the SA office so student organizations could film videos.
He said he plans to create a sign-up sheet allowing student organizations to present upcoming events and recent accomplishments at SA meetings. Any non-senator, including student organizations, are currently permitted to go before the senate and address any concerns or accomplishments during the public comment period of each meeting, according to the SA’s constitution.
“If elected as vice president, my door will always be open to be there for students because I think that that’s essential,” he said.
He said he hopes to create a shared messaging platform between the legislative and executive branches and host social events to promote connections between the two branches.
Apostolis said while still acting as a senator, he plans to propose a bill requiring senators to attend at least three student organization meetings per semester. Apostolis has attended every full senate meeting, according to available minutes.
He said regardless of whether he is elected, he plans to create an orientation guidance document for incoming SA senators to introduce them to senate policies.
“Even if not elected, I’m not going to stop working hard to help the students,” he said.
Apostolis said as vice president, he would plan to meet with each SA senator at least once to check in on their goals and ongoing work. He said he plans to use Trello, a project management software, to monitor senators’ legislative projects.
He said after he was accepted to GW during his senior year of high school, he met former SA Vice President Kate Carpenter who inspired him to get involved in the SA after he met her at a GW-sponsored trivia event for newly admitted students. 
“She was my inspiration,” he said. “She was really outgoing, and I wanted to be Kate Carpenter.”
Earlier this year, Apostolis said he partnered with the SA’s Assistant Secretary of Dining Joshua Stone to establish a dining focus group that communicates with the SA’s executive branch and dining vendors, recommending expanded allergy-friendly options, cooking classes and clearer labels. Next year, Apostolis wants to add allergy options and grocery stores on GWorld to the University’s meal plan. 
He said he hopes to advertise Faculty Senate meetings to students so they can familiarize themselves with administrators.
He also hopes to interview applicants for senate staff positions twice to give interested students opportunities to talk about their passions.
“I want us to be able to not be scared to talk to people,” he said.
Apostolis said he plans to host tabling events and a karaoke night leading up to the election on April 5 and 6.
“I’m here for students,” he said. “Anything they need, I will make time.”

Boqueria provides both the lively atmosphere and flavorful tapas options of Spain right here in D.C. without hopping on a flight to Madrid or Barcelona.
Just blocks from Dupont Circle, Boqueria offers a slice of the Barcelona tapas scene right from the District.
Boqueria’s Dupont location is one of two in D.C. – here just a 15-minute walk from campus and the other in Penn Quarter – serving up traditional Spanish fare with an emphasis on enhancing the eating experience through shared small plates. The restaurant specializes in the country’s tapas, including patatas bravas, croquettes and tortilla Española, along with more Spanish favorites like paella, cured ham and sangria.
Outside the restaurant, a streetside patio that will surely be bustling come summer frames a staircase leading to the second-floor entrance of the sage green-colored establishment. The dining area is divided in half with a small, more private room just off the entrance and a more expansive main space encircling the bar to the right of the front door. Wooden floors, tables and wall furnishings create an intimate setting, complete with the dim lighting from hanging light fixtures.
High-top booth seating along the restaurant’s back wall overlooks the expansive wine cellar, which spans floor to ceiling behind clear glass. Four-person, low-top tables and bar-side, high-top options complete the seating arrangement. Chalkboard menus hang from the bar, displaying the happy hour menu and drink and dinner specials.
My friends and I arrived at Boqueria just after 4:30 p.m. on a Friday, in time for the restaurant’s daily 3 to 6 p.m. happy hour. True to its name, the atmosphere of the restaurant was happy and lively – minutes after we were seated at a table, our server was already proposing a round of Tequila shots. We came for the happy hour tapas menu, but there are also traditional brunch, lunch and dinner menus available. We started out happy hour the only right way – with a pitcher of white sangria, a light and citrusy drink that eventually paired well with our fried tapas options.
The regular dinner and tapas menu is home to many of Spain’s traditional dishes with a little bit of everything, from two variations of paella ($19 and $29) to charcuterie offerings with aged ham, cheese and olives ($14-36) to tapas like bacon wrapped dates ($10), ham croquettes ($9) and pickled anchovies ($13). The brunch and lunch menus offer the same tapas in addition to salads and egg dishes, while the dessert menu offers more Spanish classics like flan ($10).
We split a mix of tapas from the happy hour menu, deciding on the tortilla Española ($6), patatas bravas ($6) and pan con tomate con jamon y manchego ($10). We made sure to finish on a sweet note with the churros con chocolate ($5).
The tortilla Española, a traditional Spanish frittata, did not disappoint. Complete with soft, warm potatoes, eggs and fresh, tangy onions to add a subtle sweetness, the dish satisfied us while leaving room for more tapas to come. A garlic aioli sauce on the side was the optimal pairing for the frittata – the lemony, salty sauce is evidently a staple of many of Boqueria’s tapas, including the patatas bravas.
The patatas bravas – or sautéed potatoes – were the highlight of the evening without a doubt. The pile of crispy potatoes was drawn together by the creamy and mild nature of the garlic aioli, mixing with the pop of heat from the salsa brava, spicy tomato sauce, and the Pimentón – smoked paprika. The patatas bravas made for the ideal shared dish, with all four of us getting a decent serving of three potatoes. The oily potatoes, somewhat heavy on their own, paired well with our fruity sangria and light cocktails.
We ordered the pan con tomate con jamón y manchego next, which consisted of two pieces of grilled bread rubbed with tomato, garlic and olive oil served with four substantial pieces of jamón serrano – cured ham – and manchego – a quintessential Spanish cheese – on the side. The crusty, toasted bread and the soft, acidic tomato spread combined for a textural contrast that burst with flavor with the smoky ham and sharp taste of cheese on top.
As we finished the evening, our waiter recommended the churros con chocolate for dessert. The dish came with about six thin, long pieces of traditional fried dough dusted with cinnamon sugar and served with a thick, hot chocolate sauce on the side for dipping. The thin, crispy churros paired with the thick, gooey chocolate sauce created an ideal combination of both texture and sweet flavor, a welcomed change from the salty tapas we’d enjoyed throughout our meal.

While the food struck all the right texture and flavor notes, the best part about dining at Boqueria is the shared eating experience. Splitting tapas between friends allows for an interactive meal, with everyone passing plates and sharing commentary about the delectable bites.

Updated: March 23, 2023, at 11:42 p.m.
Police departments across the country are struggling to recruit, train and maintain well-supported forces. This challenge holds true in D.C., where 313 officers resigned or retired between June 2020 and May 2021, citing a lack of support from the government in light of police reform legislation. Now, city officials are attempting to eliminate accountability measures to increase police presence, which will only worsen crime rates and police brutality.
D.C.’s homicide count was up 14 percent from the same time last year as of March 23. Predominantly Black Wards 7 and 8 have the highest violent crime rates, with notably higher levels of poverty than all other wards. But the belief that increased police presence will tackle rising crime is uninformed, especially after members of Congress – backed by the D.C. Police Union – vetoed revisions to D.C.’s outdated criminal code earlier this month instead of addressing the city’s historic prejudice in policing. Oversimplifying solutions to policing in the District disregards the deeply flawed history of law enforcement in this country, trivializes historically marginalized communities and blurs the lines of how much power we should be granting first responders.
Last month, Ward 7 D.C. Council member Vincent Gray introduced the Police Officer Recruitment and Retention Act of 2023. The bill would increase the Metropolitan Police Department force from just over 3,000 to a total of 4,200 officers and revise a restriction barring the D.C. Police Union from putting disciplinary measures up for officer contract negotiations. The bill would authorize Mayor Muriel Bowser to fund recruitment and retention benefits for MPD officers, remove and repeal previous police reforms to attract officers and eliminate the position of deputy auditor for public safety in the Office of D.C. Auditor, which can investigate fatal police-involved shootings. These varying accountability measures were created as a part of a police reform bill that Gray voted for and the Council passed in 2021, which was meant to enforce less aggressive, biased policing.
Research examining the relationship between a police force’s size and crime rates is mixed at best, with some studies concluding that a department’s policing strategy has a more significant impact on crime than the size of its police force.
And the auditor position’s elimination is particularly concerning given that an ​​audit of the MPD this past fall revealed widespread corruption, including rehiring and aggressive back pay for fired officers across the department. Overturning police reforms – like firing officers with histories of misconduct – enacted during a time of social unrest over police brutality in 2020 only reinforces the idea that law enforcement officers are above the law. We must not excuse misconduct within the police force under the mistaken belief that more officers will mean more safety.
When the system does not hold officers accountable for their actions, we implicitly accept a faulty, corrupt and ill-equipped force. In reality, a lesser-vetted police force will only increase the socioeconomic disparities prevalent across America today. Studies suggest a strong correlation between aggressive policing and mass incarceration and poverty. Our first responders should be held to the same – if not a higher – standard as the citizens whom they are sworn to protect.
Gray’s bill would also require MPD to deploy officers to “neighborhoods experiencing higher levels of violent crime” as the size of the force increases. But such a move would amplify disparities and inequities, not reduce them. Sending untrained, unaccountable officers to brutalize marginalized communities is not the answer. Despite making up only 13 percent of the population, Black Americans accounted for 27 percent of those fatally shot by police in 2021.
Police ought to protect their fellow citizens, not improve public safety at the expense of equity. No bill, no cop and no veto will “fix” crime. And yet the incentive to become a cop has never been higher. MPD now offers a $20,000 bonus for all new hires while standards for already employed officers remain at an all-time low.
People have long understood police and safety to be synonyms – this might be why police unions and those who “back the blue” feel so threatened by measures that separate the two. But if we seek safety and security for all, understanding that it does not exist for many today, we need to reform policing rather than simply hire more officers. This bill should not pass – it would result in the elimination of reforms that are necessary for the maintenance of civil liberties for all those who reside in the District. If anything, we need more reforms that act in the interest of civilians.
When crime is high and public trust is low, hyping up crime, playing off citizens’ fears and throwing more resources at MPD is no solution. Police are undeniably a pillar of society, but more numerous and less accountable police officers will not make D.C. safer.

This post has been updated to correct the following:
The Hatchet incorrectly reported that crime in D.C. is at an all-time high. All crimes decreased during the past two years when compared to the previous two years, according to the MPD. We regret this error. This post has also been updated to clarify that year-to-date homicides in D.C. increased by 14 percent as of March 23 compared to last year. A previous version of the column stated there was a 40 percent increase in homicides in the city between 2022 and Feb. 27, 2023.

Like many adolescents, the majority of my interpretation of “normal” growing up came from the media, specifically TV shows and movies. As a child, I rarely saw a person of color in the principal cast of a show or film, let alone a South Asian female protagonist whose storyline wasn’t tied to a “loser” personality. As a first-generation Indian American woman, the host of challenges I faced would revolve around being different than this sense of “normal” reflected on TV and within my predominantly white neighborhood.
At school, I was surrounded by my white friends with their own set of customs and traditions. Being exposed to a culture beyond my own was important for a well-rounded childhood experience – but in elementary and middle school, it’s hard to see it this way. So at the time, the sight of a TV character who looked like me and could showcase the struggles of being Indian in an American society would have meant the world. Yet that never was the case.
When all of my friends were celebrating the same holidays and attending the same churches, I began to feel left out through no fault of anyone but my own internal monologue. I questioned why I was different from my peers and what made me different – my skin color was darker, my household customs were different, the language my family spoke at home wasn’t always English and the food I brought for lunch wasn’t always received kindly. I began hearing stereotypes thrown around about my culture – our houses smelled like “curry” and we were only good for tech support. I found myself laughing along with them instead of saying something. I felt embarrassed simply for being different despite knowing inherently that there is nothing wrong with my Indian American identity.
So when Mindy Kaling reached astronomical success in the predominantly white television industry, I imagine countless other first-generation Indian Americans like me believed she could pave the way to break down these stereotypes through an inclusive and culturally sensitive narrative in media and pop culture. She was and still is the only real South Asian representation that has been able to break into the world of acting, screen-writing and producing in television and film. But Kaling did the opposite of what we’d hoped – while she included an influx of Indian American female protagonists in her writing, the characters continued to perpetuate tone deaf, two-dimensional stereotypes and other harmful narratives about the South Asian community. Every time Kaling released a new show with an Indian American woman as the protagonist, I found myself disappointed at her interpretation of Indian characters and her willingness to put them into a stereotypical box.
After Kaling rose to fame with her role as a writer and actor on the 2005-2013 sitcom “The Office,” she created and wrote “The Mindy Project,” a sitcom starring herself, in 2012. The show followed obstetrician-gynecologist Mindy Lahiri as she navigated life in her 30s while living in New York City. But much to my disappointment, there was little to no content in the show that highlighted Kaling’s relationship with her culture. The titular character rarely mentioned her Indian roots except to make fun of them. Kaling’s character would commonly refer to herself as a “model minority” or attribute her intelligence to her race rather than her work ethic. The protagonist made slights at her background often, most notably in a Season 2 episode where her character’s ID read that she is 5’10″, weighs 110 lbs and has blonde hair with blue eyes. She said her philosophy is that “IDs are meant to be aspirational,” joking that she would rather be a skinny blonde white woman than one with Indian American features. That was exactly the outsider feeling I spent so much of my life trying to shake.
In each of Kaling’s many works since “The Mindy Project,” she showcases her female Indian American protagonists laughing at themselves in an effort to beat someone else to the punch. Her 2020 Netflix original series “Never Have I Ever,” which follows 16-year-old Devi Vishwakumar as she navigates high school after losing her father, is a prime example. Within the first few episodes, viewers learn that Devi thinks she’s “not like other Indian girls,” whom she views as the stereotype – nerdy, soft-spoken and innocent. She hates her dark and fast-growing hair, complains about her mother’s strict rules and treats cultural traditions as a chore. In Kaling’s wildly successful 2021 HBO Max series, “The Sex Lives of College Girls,” she includes Bela, an autobiographical Indian American character who pursues comedy writing, as one of the four protagonists. Bela calls herself an “Indian Loser” within her first few minutes on screen.
Kaling’s writing throughout her nearly two-decade-long career sends a message to all non-South Asian viewers that negative stereotypes we heard so many times at school about Indian Americans are true – Indians are hairy, nerdy and belong to oppressive households obsessed with grades and success. While this is not only a gross generalization, it also tells non-South Asian people that Indian Americans think of themselves this way. Kaling’s messaging further tells young Indian American girls that they should be embarrassed of their culture and accept the narrative that the media already pushes.
Despite the harmful messaging Kaling’s writing perpetrates, she is not solely to blame for the misrepresentation of South Asians in the media. The core of the problem lies in the fact that Kaling is the only form of representation that exists in such a multi-faceted way, placing unfair pressure on her as the lone pillar of Indian representation in Hollywood and pushing her to create such stereotypical characters. Her interpretation of the culture and her experience growing up represents that of only one person – herself. It is unfeasible of us to expect Kaling to address every problem Indian Americans face. Hollywood must start hiring more South Asian writers, producers and actors rather than relying on the same person to satisfy their diversity quota.

Facing a problem yourself? Annie has answers. Ask away!
Nicholas Anastacio | Graphics Editor
Dear Annie,
My friends always point out whenever I look bad – like my makeup is streaked or my clothes don’t match. I want to believe they do it because they don’t want me to embarrass myself, but it’s making me wonder if I ever look good!
Sincerely,
Am I Ugly
Dear Am I Ugly,
I hear you, Am I Ugly. I ask myself the same question – a lot. Recently, I felt unsightly because I realized a good friend of mine never posts pictures of us on Instagram. I may not know what you look like, but I empathize with people whose friends exacerbate their physical insecurities.
Jenna Baer | Staff Cartoonist
Despite the hurt, you – we – have to remember a hair out of place, mismatched outfit or absence from a friend’s social media feed doesn’t mean you’re ugly (probably?). You are feeling insecure, and insecurities can fester without communication.
If you want to maintain these friendships, ask your friends to refrain from similar comments going forward. Or if they can’t hold their tongue, at least approach comments about your appearance with more sensitivity.
If they intend to help you avoid a fashion faux pas, introduce them to the five-second rule. Coming from a psychologist with a large TikTok following, someone can point out a flaw in your appearance if you can change it in five seconds because quick fixes likely won’t pierce deeper insecurities. They could point out crumbs above your lip you can easily wipe away, but acknowledging a pimple poking through layers of concealer can cause an evening alone rather than one spent with friends. If you’re anything like me (and it sounds like you are), I would spend the rest of the night staring in the mirror, trying to cover up the blemish with my hair.
While you can communicate what you would like to hear from your friends, you can’t rely on others for self-confidence. Before going out with these friends, repeat some confidence-boosting affirmations into the mirror. Take inspiration from Hollywood icon Issa Rae and sing humorous reminders of your strength and the acceptance you deserve – “you’re looking real clean, you’re looking real bad, you’re looking like a queen.”
Building confidence is a much easier process than you may imagine. Follow what the confident people do! Would a confident person keep wearing clothes they do not feel comfortable in? No. They find colors and styles that work for them using the art of color analysis. Would a confident person let smeared eyeliner hinder them from enjoying their night? No, they would quickly rub it away and continue dancing. If your friends continue to make negative comments about your appearance despite your requests, pretend you don’t care about it until it is not an act anymore. Fake it ’till you make it!
You have to communicate your feelings, but you can’t expect communication to erase your insecurity. Telling my friend I feel bad there are no pictures of me on their Instagram didn’t make me feel better about my appearance or our friendship. I had to remind myself a confident person would not let this social media absence hinder their self-perception.
When your friends make you feel insecure, only you are responsible for building a positive self-image. You – we – have to put in the inner work to boost our self-esteem.
Sending (self-)love,

The movie is a hilarious and exciting romp – the last 20 minutes feel similar to the thrill of a close Game 7.
Updated: March 23, 2023, at 5:20 p.m.
Iconic sports films are often only barely about the sports they burrow into.
Rocky yells out the name of his lover at the end of the climactic fight instead of worrying about the results, and the business deals of “Moneyball” are more thrilling than the action on the actual baseball diamond. “Air,” a Ben Affleck-directed film chronicling basketball icon Michael Jordan’s decision to sign a shoe deal with Nike at the start of his NBA career, is no different.
The exciting yet occasionally ill-paced film is only tangentially about basketball. A smattering of clips showing Michael Jordan sink supernatural layups litter the movie – that much was inevitable. But the meat of the plot surrounds the fight to get His Airness to join the then-less-relevant Nike company and the making of a modern-day myth.
Affleck plays Nike founder Phil Knight in the star-studded film that also features Matt Damon as Nike executive Sonny Vaccaro, Viola Davis as Michael Jordan’s mother and Deloris and Chris Tucker and Jason Bateman as other members of the Nike top brass.
The movie centers around Sonny’s fight to let his Nike superiors chase a deal with Jordan, whom Sonny saw as an inevitable icon not just for basketball but for the world. The film tells an underdog story – Nike wasn’t always the basketball powerhouse it is now. The movie shows how the company trailed Converse and Adidas in basketball shoe sales in the early ’80s, and the firm was desperate for stars to help it break out of the rut.
The Chicago Bulls selected Jordan third in the 1984 NBA draft, and Adidas was the favorite to sign the star. In the film, Nike CEO Phil Knight is initially reluctant to pursue Jordan as a brand ambassador and opts to sponsor three lesser-known players instead, but Sonny – embracing the rule-breaking and ambitious spirit from the early days of Nike – refuses to take no for an answer.
The movie avoids showing Jordan on screen – no actor could have adequately portrayed the cold-blooded competitor. The absence of Mr. Clutch can feel awkward at times, but Davis’ motherly strength as Deloris made up for the absence of the superstar. Davis is, as always, brilliantly compelling and forceful as a mother who understands her son can exceed even the wildest expectations.
Alex Convery wrote the screenplay in 2021 and the script appeared on that year’s Black List, an annual survey listing some of the best unproduced screenplays, typically written by relatively unknown storytellers. Michael Jordan himself wasn’t involved in the production of the film, but he did give his blessing to Affleck and even suggested that Davis play his mother.
The 1980s-based film drips with nostalgia – the movie was inundated with images of an Atari or a “Where’s the Beef” clip or Walter Mondale or a Los Angeles Olympics clip. But MJ’s Nike deal wasn’t just vital for creating an ‘80s and ‘90s legend – the contract’s revenue cut for Jordan helped build a still ongoing movement by athletes to own and profit from their name and image.
A critical phone call between Sonny and Deloris where she illustrates the importance of athletes owning a share of their likeness takes the movie from a strong biopic to an excellent story of personal labor and value. Deloris knew her son would reach the stars and set up a contract to maximize the potential of his greatness.
It’s no coincidence that Sonny, who organized the Jordan contract, also helped organize the lawsuit that guaranteed student-athletes to earn compensation for the use of their name, image and likeness.
The movie is a hilarious and exciting romp – the last 20 minutes feel similar to the thrill of a close Game 7. Affleck’s movie pays great homage to underdogs everywhere, whether they be basketball stars from North Carolina or shoemakers in Beaverton, Oregon.

Interim University President Mark Wrighton declined to comment on how his election loss will affect his plans following the end of his interim tenure July 1, leaving his future professional plans up in the air.
Interim University President Mark Wrighton lost the election for president of the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences, according to an announcement published on the AAAS website March 15.
Wrighton, who ran on a platform of advancing the scientific enterprise, lost the election to Willie E. May, who will aim to promote diversity in STEM and combat misinformation during his upcoming term as the president of AAAS, a global science organization aimed at advancing “science, engineering and innovation.” Wrighton declined to comment on how his election loss will affect his plans following the end of his interim tenure on July 1, leaving his future professional plans up in the air.
“I am grateful to have been considered for the presidency of AAAS and look forward to the leadership Dr. May will provide to this esteemed society dedicated to advancing science,” Wrighton said in an email.
During the campaign, Wrighton said his experience serving as a chemistry department chair and the provost at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the chancellor of Washington University, St. Louis and GW’s interim president prepared him to lead scientific advancement initiatives, according to a Feb. 17 blog on the AAAS website.
May, the vice president of research and economic development and professor of chemistry at Morgan State University, declined to comment, deferring to his statement in a blog posted on the Morgan State University website.
May said following his victory, he will use the position to advance diversity and K-12 education initiatives, work to build public trust in scientific research and collaborate with government agencies, according to the Morgan State University website.
“AAAS has the stature and resources to support in-depth studies of the causes of and solutions to the underrepresentation of minority groups in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), and to foster an environment in which researchers of all backgrounds feel welcome and supported,” May stated on the website.
Sudip S. Parikh, the chief executive officer of AAAS and executive publisher of the Science family of journals, said AAAS is “excited” for new leadership to progress scientific initiatives as they head into their 175th year.
“We will utilize our leaders’ expertise to continue our work on expanding DEI in the STEMM ecosystem, addressing mis- and disinformation in the sciences and providing important historical context on a wide range of topics within the scientific enterprise,” Parikh said.
