Adams hit nine 3-pointers on an out-of-this-world 75 percent from beyond the arc, breaking the GW record for most 3s by a single player in a game.
Men’s basketball pulled off a 107-105 double-overtime victory against Richmond Wednesday after record-breaking performances from multiple Colonials combined with scorching 3-point shooting willed to the finish line.
The Colonials (6-5 A-10, 12-12) came into the game aiming to end a three-game losing streak against the Richmond Spiders (5-7 A-10, 12-13), who had lost four out of their last five games. The game went back-and-forth from start to finish and was characterized by lights-out shooting, as GW and Richmond both shot over 50 percent from the field.
GW was led by senior guard Brendan Adams, who torched up the Spiders for a career-high 35 points, 30 of which came in the second half and overtime. Adams hit nine 3-pointers on an out-of-this-world 75 percent from beyond the arc, breaking the GW record for most 3s by a single player in a game.
In addition to Adams’ career game, The Colonials got spectacular performances from senior guard James Bishop, who scored 33 points and recorded 10 assists, and senior forward Ricky Lindo Jr., who scored 18 points and grabbed nine rebounds. Freshman guard Maximus Edwards also turned in a double-double, scoring 11 points and pulling down 16 rebounds, 15 of which were defensive, tying a school record set in the 1986-87 season for most defensive rebounds in a game.
The Colonials started the game strong, recording multiple steals to start the game and moving the ball well on offense.
They led 12-10 at the first timeout five minutes into the game. Senior forward Hunter Dean scored 6 points on 3-3 shooting in this span.
The teams traded baskets throughout the first half, and Richmond capped off a 9-0 run with a 3 to go up 28-25 with just around four minutes left in the half.
Coming out of a pair of timeouts, Bishop went on a tear, scoring 8 points in the last four minutes alone, including a tough jump shot with just four seconds left in the half, pulling GW to within 2 at halftime 35-37. Bishop finished the first half with 10 points and four assists.
In the first half, GW hit 15-27 from the field, good for 55.6 percent, while the Spiders made 14-29. The Colonials outscored Richmond 24-10 in points in the paint, while Richmond out-shot GW from the 3-point line, hitting 6 of their 12 compared to GW’s anemic 2 out of 11.
GW put an offensive clinic in the second half, kicked off by an and-one Bishop layup off a nice bounce pass from Dean to give GW the lead, 38-37, just seconds into half.
The game soon became the Bishop and Adams show with Adams hitting two jump shots and a 3 before Bishop converted two more layups. Adams and Bishops scored the Colonials’ first 14 second-half points, putting GW up 52-45.
Richmond then went on an 8-0 run, retaking the lead 53-52 with 12:30 left in the half. Adams responded by hitting three straight 3s, scoring 9 points in the span of two minutes and putting GW up 61-57 with 10:30 left in regulation.
The Colonials extended their lead over the next several minutes. With 8:17 left to go in regulation, Adams hit his fifth 3-pointer of the half, scoring his 24 point off of a Bishop assist to put GW up 69-61.
A Lindo drive and layup made the score 71-64 with only 6:32 left to go in regulation, and the Colonials were able to force a shot-clock violation on the ensuing possession. Richmond responded by going on a 9-0 run, going up 75-71 with 2:31 left in the second half and holding a 5-point lead at 78-73 with just 1:07 to go.
Just when the game seemed out of reach, the Colonials stepped up and hit big shot after big shot to tie the game and send it to overtime. Edwards and Bishop both hit big 3s, and after Richmond hit a pair of free-throws to go up 82-79 with 25 seconds to go, Bishop brought up the ball and hit a clutch layup plus a foul that sent him to the line, where he sunk the free-throw to tie the game at 82-82.
“And then in the last play, it was like 20 seconds left,” Bishop said. “So I knew that I could still get in a quick two even if I didn’t get fouled, in my mind. I just shot it, get to the rim as quick as possible. And then he happened to foul me, that made it even better so I was able to get to the line.”
The Colonials maintained their offensive tenacity in overtime with Adams hitting his seventh 3-pointer of the night to put GW up 87-82 with 3:12 left in the first overtime. With just over two minutes to go, Adams tossed an alley-oop pass to Lindo who slammed it home and put the Colonials up 91-86.
Richmond countered with two 3s, interrupted by a Lindo free throw and just like that, the game was knotted back up at 92-92, sending the game to a second overtime.
GW offense stayed electric in the second overtime. Adams hit yet another 3, and Bishop drove to the basket and converted an and-one to start the period. Adams hit his ninth 3-pointer to put the Colonials up 101-94 with just under three minutes left.
“Yeah, I think obviously the big momentum play,” Adams said. “I can’t remember who passed me on but great pass. Was JB, I think. Great pass, the pass into the shot. I think he’s got us going, gives us a lot of momentum and sent us to the win.”
The Colonials were able to hold onto their lead this time, as Bishop hit a pair of free throws to ice the game and put them up 107-103 with five seconds left. GW ultimately emerged victorious with a final score of 107-105.
The Colonials relied heavily on Bishop and Adams to deliver key baskets down the stretch, which Head Coach Chris Caputo said was intentional.
“I think at that point in the game, we kind of went more back into middle pick and rolls with JB and BA,” Caputo said. “The idea for us was to mix it a little bit as we got down the stretch, not that we got to keep the ball in the hands of those guys. And so how do you do that as simply as possible? In those situations you think more about players than you think about plays.”
The Colonials hope to continue their momentum with a win against Saint Joseph Saturday in Philadelphia. Tipoff is slated for 1 p.m.

I’ve always loved going to old book sales. There’s something about seeing the crease in the spine and the smell of the pages, knowing that someone else could have held the same text, absorbed the same information and shed tears over the same story. I love that you can bring a physical book with you anywhere, reading and turning each page until you turn over the back cover.
The digital age has certainly lessened the prevalence of physical books, particularly in academic settings, where laptops have monopolized note taking. Technology as an educational tool has brought an unprecedented level of convenience to students. The days of restarting an entire page because of a typo on a typewriter are long gone. I can’t even imagine writing a research paper without browsing Google or leafing through primary and secondary sources via the search key. Almost every textbook is now available online at the click of a button. Yet, this great blessing of convenience has been more of a double-edged sword for me, longing for the once paper-dominant world to return.
When I started college, I got a bigger backpack to carry all the textbooks I might need. To my surprise, that bag’s purpose would remain unfulfilled during my first semester. Once I figured out that online textbooks would be the only way to avoid spending hundreds on required materials, they seemed more appealing. But once I started buying them, I suddenly hated reading – nothing felt rewarding about being hunched over my computer with burning eyes for hours on end. I missed feeling the pages flip over my fingers, holding the book open and feeling the collection of pages shift from right to left with every turn. But I wasn’t just missing that feeling of personal achievement – it felt like I could never focus. Because of my computer, I was constantly accessible – even “do not disturb” couldn’t prevent me from seeing my email inbox slowly fill up, increasing both my to-do list and stress levels.
This semester, I learned from my mistakes and invested in physical textbooks for the classes that offered them. This decision would have amounted to just under $200 if I had not borrowed a friend’s old textbooks. At last, reading no longer feels like a dreadful burden while my burning eyes gloss over seemingly meaningless words. I’ve always been an annotator, so I focus more easily with physical books or papers. Being able to highlight and write in a book as I follow along makes the process go by much faster for me and increases the amount of information I retain.
Despite taking my notes by hand, most of my peers use computers in every class. In lecture halls with 270 students, all I can hear is the clacking of keyboards. I already sit in the front of the classroom to make sure I can hear the professor, but it’s still difficult to focus when the typing becomes surround sound as I jot down notes with a pen and paper. I become anxious when I hear people typing around me when I’m not writing – what am I missing? I waste time feeling unnecessarily anxious while my peers are likely typing something completely unrelated to the lecture like homework for their next class or a crossword puzzle.
I wish every day that I didn’t need physical books or handwritten notes to absorb information or to focus – it is detrimental to my bank account and the environment.  I could save nearly $150 by taking notes on my computer, renting online textbooks or using library resources. I go through at least one notebook and an endless amount of pencils and erasers for every course I take. Nearly all of my professors assign additional online articles and research papers, and I print every single one of them out to annotate them. I’ve already had to buy filing boxes to store the numerous notebooks and printed articles so I can use them to write my final essays. And they aren’t free – GW only provides us with $30, or 500 black and white double-sided pages of printing credits for an entire year, which I went through before last semester ended.
I feel a lot of guilt about how much paper I print. Not only am I spending money, but there’s an environmental cost to my actions. The sheer amount of pollutant-emitting machinery and water necessary to create paper has made the paper industry the third-largest emitter of global warming in many industrial nations. But the problem isn’t just the detrimental effects of manufacturing the paper. We need trees. The Amazon Rainforest, a major carbon sink holding an estimated 123 billion tons of carbon, will likely be annihilated by the year 2064. Between renting used books and recycling old paper materials, I take every avenue possible to lessen this environmental harm. But I still hate knowing that I am a contributor in that process. Paper is simply vital to my learning style.
I don’t think technology will ever replace paper for me. With a computer, you get notifications, advertisements and sounds. You become accessible at every point in the day. Paper is special. It forces you to slow down and step away from life and its distractions. It’s a physical reminder of everything you have accomplished in reading and every possibility left in the pages. And for that, I will always choose paper.

Dear Annie,
I matched with a TA from my big lecture class on Tinder, and we’ve been chatting. They don’t know I’m in their class, and I’m starting to catch feelings. What do I do?
Xoxo,
Lovestruck in Lecture
Dear Lovestruck in Lecture,
You have stumbled upon the dreams of campus romance novels: connection with a (hopefully hot) TA. Imagine watching them lecture the class on molecular synthesis, knowing the real chemistry lies between the two of you. Romance authors would spin this into a New York Times bestseller or a highly read Wattpad romp. Connection is so rare, and life is so short – you should go for any chance you find, even if it defies the traditional student-TA hierarchy.
In this pursuit, both parties dive into murky administrative waters. GW prohibits TAs from engaging in a “sexual or amorous relationship” with students enrolled in their course. Punishments range from a written warning to termination of the employed party. Thankfully none of these actions will ruin your academic career – and looming consequences make any rendezvous extra spicy – but do not discount these cautions, especially as a relationship with you may have long-term effects on the TA’s career.
If you don’t want to disrupt your academics, you should also consider the friction of dating the person who enters your grades. How would you feel if after sharing an intimate moment with your partner, they pull up Blackboard and enter a bad grade on your latest assignment? Would receiving criticism about your Chicago Style formatting during dates infringe upon more hands-on formations?
After weighing the administrative and academic complications on your end, it’s time to take the next step. Inform the TA that you are a student in their course before you go out with them. Without proper time to process the reality of the situation, you might put them in a tricky spot without warning, killing the first date mood. Your TA should know the truth – and the potential consequences – ahead of time to establish a consensual relationship.

Secrecy and boundaries are the keys to success here. Cross off some spots on your D.C. bucket list and choose an off-campus location to start your rendezvous to keep your budding relationship out of sight. Bring sunglasses to class if your eyes water at the sight of them, sleeves rolled up, pinning an expo marker against the whiteboard. When you really need to take notes, pull up the PowerPoint on your computer instead of directing your vision to the front of the lecture hall.
As for boundaries, apply the Vegas approach: what happens in the bedroom stays in the bedroom. Just because you are with the TA doesn’t mean you can slack on your coursework. Apply yourself to the course material like you would any other class, and who knows – maybe you will impress your new admirer with your knowledge.
While dating a TA comes with its share of academic and administrative hurdles, each obstacle pales in comparison to the roaring passion that will materialize outside of the lecture hall. The next time you play “Never Have I Ever,” you would win every round with a story like that!
All the best,
Annie <3

I was just getting settled into the first semester in my new residence hall room when I heard a distinct “ding” coming from my laptop – an email reading “e-bill invoice.” My anxiety leaped, my heart pounded and my brain would not quiet itself as I stared at the notification. The unspeakable stress hit me like a train and left me immobile at my desk. At the beginning of the semester, I had paid off the outstanding amount in my account with all of my savings, but now I had to pay for another semester – money I did not have and would not be able to get.
Dealing with the financial stress of budgeting and paying for college as a first-generation and low-income student causes me constant anxiety. I battle with myself, cautiously weighing each option for financial support – a job, a loan or a scholarship if I’m lucky. I feel like I’m walking on a ledge, calculating each step I take, scared of making the wrong choice that could cost me my education.
For many first-generation and low-income students, a college education is one of the first steps we have taken toward success and financial security for ourselves and future generations. But it is also an extremely gut-wrenching route. I have to try and reach the top despite facing so many financial obstacles and disadvantages.
When I was about 10 years old, I learned education would be the key to a better life. My teachers told me so in school, and I saw it firsthand. I watched my brother’s best friends earn scholarships and leave for college. It seemed like working just hard enough would allow me to succeed. School became my life, as it does for many students aspiring for higher education. But the education in my hometown of Imperial Valley, California is lacking at best. I had to do everything in my power to excel by getting good grades, participating in extracurriculars, performing community service, taking standardized tests and racking up AP scores.
Once I was accepted into college, I needed to earn additional scholarships and financial aid to pay for it. I aspired to make my family proud, from my father who never finished middle school to my mother who never got to be a career woman to my gifted brother – all of whom did not get to pursue their goals due to financial hardships.
When I received the e-bill invoice, I opened up the federal loans application – I needed money immediately. In high school, I was always told that college is an investment. But I am borrowing money that I have no possible way of paying back. I would be killing myself after college to pay off loans, rent, utilities and necessities. I knew exactly what would happen – I would return to the Imperial Valley because it was too good to be true for a first-generation and low-income student traversing college alone.
When I was leaving for college, my brother told me, “People with money get to screw up. We don’t, Andrea.” I can’t ask my family for guidance – my relatives have no experience attending a university or balancing school, jobs and extracurriculars. If I prioritize the wrong thing – work, grades, extracurriculars or internships – it could all be over. Giving up internship experiences would put me at a disadvantage, which is a big price to pay at an institution that is predominantly upper-class students who don’t need to prioritize jobs to get by.
Juggling academics with college finances can seem hopeless at times. Focusing grades and extracurriculars would mean no job and even more loans, which could ruin my future financial stability. Working full-time could put my scholarship in jeopardy, but placing all my faith in competitive scholarships could risk making no money at all. A combination of each could leave me burnt out and eventually out of a GW education.
If they’re accessible to the students who need them most, scholarships can help first-generation and low-income students pay tuition, room and board, books and even basic necessities like shampoo and menstrual products. Most of GW’s schools offer merit or need-based scholarships. GW offers emergency funds to students with unprecedented financial issues through initiatives like the Cokie and Steve Roberts SMPA Student Support Fund, which helped me pay off my fall semester. GW launched the Scholarship Endowment Match last semester, and it has already started making a difference by helping students pay off their tuition and housing.
The path to higher education as a first-generation and low-income student is dark, worrisome and uncertain. I often wonder whether I am taking the right steps or even the right path. Sometimes I feel like I’m being selfish for wanting to leave my hometown to get an education, deviating from my entire family. Perhaps I was too ambitious to want more out of life than the rest of my family, to aim for success and security despite depressing statistics of college dropouts, debts and the job market.
There will always be an unending train of worries, pressure and anxiety over grades, jobs, internships, loans and money as we are in college. They will be persistent and stubborn, but so will we. Failure has never been an option. Even if we were to fall off the financial ledge, it still wouldn’t be the end of our story because we were wired to never give up.
Being a low-income student and constantly weighing my options to stay afloat is terrifying, but all I can do is hope that everything I have fought for – not just for myself, but for my family – will help me succeed enough so that I never have to worry about falling ever again.

Asjah Inniss (24, junior) drives to the lane against George Mason defender Paula Suárez (14, sophomore)
Women’s basketball fell to Rhode Island on the road, 47-64, snapping a five-game conference win streak that vaulted GW to fourth place in the season standings.
The Colonials (16-9, 8-4 A-10) were lethargic on offense and struggled to limit the conference-leading Rams’ (10-4, 12-0 A-10) second chance opportunities and proficiency from deep. Rhode Island built an early lead and never lost their momentum as they continued their spotless A-10 run.
GW got on the board with their fourth attempt as redshirt senior forward Mayowa Taiwo converted a second-chance layup to make it 4-2 with 6:49 to go in the first quarter. Taiwo led GW in both points and field-goal percentage, putting up 12 points on 6 out of 10 shooting.
Rams’ junior forward Mayé Touré continued her hot start with her third putback layup to give her all 9 of her team’s points through five minutes, with the Colonials still just having the single score on the board. GW responded with an 8-0 run of their own over the next three minutes, including 5 from Taiwo, making it 10-9 with 1:50 to go in the first quarter.
The lead was short lived as Rhode Island sophomore guard Sophie Philips and graduate guard Sayawni Lassiter netted a pair of 3s to wrap up the quarter 15-10. The Colonials shot just .385 percent from the field and shot four times from the 3-point line without success in the first quarter compared to the Rams’ .462 percent and two out of seven shooting.
The second quarter remained a struggle for GW on both sides of the court, scoring just 10 points while allowing 18 to Rhode Island. Despite shooting just 20 percent for the quarter, the Colonial defense kept the game within single digits until midway through, before graduate guard Madison Hattix-Covington netted one from beyond the arc to push the score to 27-15.
Taiwo responded on the other end with an inside score of an assist from junior guard Taylor Webster. With just a minute to play, the Colonials found themselves down a manageable 11, at 31-20, before the Rams scored 7 points to close the half, including a wild buzzer beater by freshman guard Ines Debroise from well beyond half court.
The most striking discrepancy in first-half offensive production came from behind the 3-point line, with GW failing to convert any from long range after seven attempts, and Rhode Island making six on 14 tries. 
The second half opened slowly for both squads, but a pair of free throws from Hattix-Covington extended the Rhode Island lead to 22 at 42-20, the largest gap of the night. Graduate forward Mia Lakstigala chipped away at the deficit with a contested layup to make it 25-42 with 6:35 to go in the third quarter.
Spearheaded by Taiwo, who leads the A-10 in rebounding at 10.2 per game, rebounding has been a strong point for Colonials so far this season with a 4.7 average rebounding margin. But the rebounding battle proved to be another advantage for Rhode Island, as they controlled the glass 48 to 34.
The last three minutes of the third saw just three total made field goals, punctuated by a last-second fast-break layup from freshman guard Nya Robertson to make the score 50-33.
Nya Lok started the fourth quarter with a quick burst of scoring, dropping 5 points on two shots in just over a minute, but it did not ignite the large comeback the Colonials needed. The Rams offense slowed in an effort to milk the clock, and they were able to comfortably hold their advantage as the quarter wrapped up.
GW’s five game A-10 winning streak still has them well positioned as they find themselves less than a month away from the conference championship.
The Colonials will continue their road stretch as they take on Saint Louis Saturday at 8 p.m.

While fans certainly can’t expect Beyoncé to win every award she is nominated for, it’s baffling that the most awarded artist in history has not won Record of the Year or Album of the Year even once.
International superstar Beyoncé made history Sunday when she became the artist with the most Grammy awards in history – 32 and counting.
But while that number seems like an extraordinary feat, Beyoncé has only won in a major Grammy category once – when “Single Ladies” was named Song of the Year in 2010 – despite 17 nominations for Record, Song and Album of the Year altogether. So when she was up for the three major categories yet again in 2023 with her critically acclaimed, experimental seventh solo studio album “RENAISSANCE,” fans and music critics alike were shocked when she didn’t come out on top.
Out of her 88 total nominations since 1999, virtually all of Beyoncé’s 32 awards have been in R&B, Rap or Urban Contemporary categories. Best Urban Contemporary Album, which Beyoncé won in 2017 and 2019, has since been renamed to Best Progressive R&B Album in 2020 after artists like Tyler, the Creator called the name a “backhanded compliment” and voiced concerns about racial connotations. The Recording Academy televises about 90 percent of the awards for genre-specific categories in the Grammys pre-show instead of the main ceremony, delegating them to a less influential platform and occasion. Despite decorating Beyoncé with the most Grammy awards of all time, the academy has neglected her revolutionary and universal contributions to the music industry as a result of minimizing her recognition in the nationally broadcasted show.
“RENAISSANCE” debuted at number one on the Billboard charts this summer and instantly broke the Spotify record for the most streamed album in a single day by a female artist, garnering more than 40 million listens. “RENAISSANCE” was not only a genre-bending and revolutionary return to house music – it also paid homage with proper credit to the ballroom and drag artists from the 1980s and 1990s who inspired the album.
After losing the coveted Album of the Year award for the third time in 2016 with her smash hit “Lemonade,” which even drew criticism from Adele, who won the award that year, fans and music critics alike thought the fourth time would be a charm in 2023. “RENAISSANCE” was not just an album but an immersive experience, with each track blending together to perfection. So when Harry Styles’ nonexperimental third album “Harry’s House” was announced as the winner, audiences were shocked. That shock turned into frustration and even anger when Styles got up to the podium and declared that “this doesn’t happen to people like me very often.” Fans argued that it’s difficult to think of a group of people who are awarded by the Grammys more.
Styles’ puzzlingly tone-deaf comment neglected the decades-long lineage of white artists who have monopolized Album of the Year throughout Grammys history, especially after being up against artists like Beyoncé, Bad Bunny and Lizzo. As one of the most rich and famous musicians in the world since he appeared on The X Factor when he was just 16, the justification his fans scraped together about his small town upbringing didn’t hold up. He may not have meant any harm, but his statement reflects the rampant inequity of the awards show year after year.
A Black woman has not won Album of the Year in more than two decades since rap artist Lauryn Hill won in 1999 for “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.” And while fans certainly can’t expect Beyoncé to win every award she is nominated for, it’s baffling that the most awarded artist in history has not won Record of the Year or Album of the Year even once throughout her career.
Accusations that highly awarded artists like Beyoncé are “overrated” only go so far when looking at the facts. White industry talent has consistently raked in the top honors of the Grammys year in and year out – just 11 Black artists have won Album of the Year in the show’s 65-year history. Styles as an artist draws stylistic and fashion inspiration from the very culture “RENAISSANCE” samples, but Beyoncé gives those artists concrete credit in her work instead of simply borrowing aesthetics. She even thanked the queer community for “inventing the genre” in her historic acceptance speech for Best R&B Song.
When the academy votes next year, they must turn their empty gestures like renaming categories into concrete acknowledgements and awards for the artists it claims to celebrate. They may have renamed the “Urban Contemporary” category, but they continue to put Black artists in a box time and time again – a testament to the academy’s historic racial bias.

The meal was made fresh in front of me on a flat top grill, wrapped in foil and handed to me like a gift.
Sitting in the heart of FRESHFARM’s Dupont Circle farmers market every Sunday, the Hog Haven Farm has everything and more of what a breakfast sandwich needs.
Hog Haven – a first-generation family farm – sells local meats and its famous Hog Haven Breakfast Sandwich, a handcrafted assortment of their fresh sausage, eggs and English muffins. The farm, located outside Richmond, Virginia, opens pop-up stands at farmers markets around the DMV with tents that are hard to miss as they pump out wafts of that alluring aroma of greasy breakfast sausage.
The Dupont Circle stand is situated right outside of the nearby Metro station, sandwiched between a bakery and produce tent.
As I approached the stand, a couple of friendly workers greeted me with a smile and welcomed me before taking my order. A pair of black, chalkboard-like menus hung from either side of the tent – one displayed the hot breakfast sandwich ($11) and its three variations – and the other showed the local meats available for purchase.
To my pleasure, there was no wait, which was a nice break from the crowded produce vendors that dominate the market. As the only customer there at the time, I got the staff’s full attention.
If you’re eyeing the meat lineup, take your pick from bacon ($15/lb), ham ($13/lb), tenderloin ($22/lb), ribs ($13) and four sausage varieties – Italian hot and sweet, sage, and maple ($13/lb). Other items seated on the stand include bottles of lemonade ($3.50/bottle, $10/three bottles), cheese spreads ($11-$13), jars of tomato aioli ($10) and more.
Though all the available items were enticing, I came for the breakfast sandwich. The meal was made fresh in front of me on a flat top grill, wrapped in foil and handed to me like a gift.
Stacked between two slices of an English muffin, the sandwich includes a sage sausage patty, a cage-free egg, grass-fed cheddar cheese and Hog Haven’s own tomato aioli. The dish was a step up from my typical breakfasts, bringing me back to my New York roots.
The scent of sizzling sausage and fresh-baked English muffins emanating from the tent had my mouth watering from the moment I approached the stand to the second I dug in. I walked the sandwich to a nearby bench, where the indulgence began. The sandwich was gone in about 10 minutes and left me feeling warm and full, exactly what I needed on a bitter winter day.
Each component of the sandwich burst to life with every bite – the sausage patty was hearty and firm, the egg melted in my mouth and the tomato aioli added a hint of spice and acidity to cut the greasiness. The sharp cheese spread evenly across the patty, perfectly sandwiched by a homemade English muffin, sweet and soft.
Taken straight from the farm, the juicy sausage links and fluffy scrambled eggs are healthy and authentic alternatives to the breakfast sandwich options at your local McDonalds, Starbucks or D.C.’s spread of cafes.
The homemade English muffin stood out among the rest of the ingredients because of the needed break from the savory profile that it brought to the dish. Combining the sweetness of a waffle and the saltiness of a biscuit all into one substance, it was unlike any other bread I’ve had in the DMV. The soft, pillowy texture of the inside of the muffin, met with the slight crunch of the outside from the griddle for the perfect start and end, or top and bottom, of the sandwich.
Hog Haven also offers substitutes to the sandwich to accommodate all allergies, dietary restrictions or preferences. A veggie sandwich substitutes an extra egg for the sausage patty, while a platter layers the sausage patty with another egg instead of the English muffin.
Hog Haven’s other pop-up stand locations include Arlington (Columbia Pike and Westover), Bethesda and Fairfax each Sunday and Arlington (Courthouse), Alexandria, Charlottesville, Columbia Heights and Falls Church every Saturday. Hog Haven also offers online ordering for their sandwiches and fresh meats available for pick up.
In need of a hangover breakfast after a long night out? Taking a morning stroll to Dupont Circle to kick off your week? Or simply wanting to try something new? Stop by Hog Haven. It’ll be worth your while.

Krissy Cralle, the director of GW Law Revue and functioning president of the organization, said before the pandemic, the annual spring show attracted more than 500 student attendees and cast more than 50 students in performances. 
The Student Bar Association unanimously approved the allocation of more than $2,000 toward the law school’s annual musical and sketch comedy performance.
Senators unanimously approved $2,131 to go toward the cost of renting Lisner Auditorium as a performance space and costumes for GW Law Revue’s annual performance. SBA Sen. John Tuley, the finance committee chair, said GW Law Revue applied for funding from the University-Wide Programs Fund but has yet to receive a response.
Krissy Cralle, the director of GW Law Revue, said the show is entering its 45th year at the University. She said the group held the performance in the University Student Center’s Grand Ballroom last year, and the revue sold out the venue.
“We are one of the few GW Law organizations whose primary event is nonacademic, strictly based around humor with a primary function of relieving stress,” she said. “Additionally, our law revue show and its resulting content served as promotional material for prospective students.”
Cralle said the annual spring show attracted more than 500 student attendees and cast more than 50 students in performances before the pandemic. She said the performance includes comedy sketches and musical numbers that spoof law professors, students and current events.
“Our show brings students, professors, alumni and administrators from across all different fields of interest together,” she said. “It is a chance to meet people outside of your legal area of interest and broaden your network.”
Cralle said the funds from the SBA would go toward renting Lisner Hall, a larger performance venue available on Feb. 24—the date of the performance—theatrical equipment and labor costs. She said some funding would promote awareness and increase ticket sales, allowing GW Law Revue to request less money in the future.
“While we understand the cost is high, we believe reinstilling the cultural significance of the Law Revue show should be a priority for this committee,” Cralle said.
Cralle said it was “very, very difficult” to find information on the University-Wide Programs Fund. She said she was unable to access the Google Drive folder with information about the fund. The folder requires students to request access to view the information, even while using their GW email accounts.
Events attracting more than 350 attendees are eligible to apply for the University-Wide Programs Fund.
Prior to creating the University-Wide Programs Fund, the University matched the $3 per-credit fee students paid to the Student Association’s fund. The creation of the fund removed 50 cents of what previously would have been matched funds from the SA’s budget, which in turn cut the SBA’s budget by $24,000.
GW Law Revue received the most funding of any law student organization in general allocations last fall for a total of $12,068.
Tuley said GW Law Revue requested a smaller amount from the SBA than they did from the University-Wide Programs Fund. He said senators should encourage student organizations to fundraise to make up for cuts to the SBA’s budget.
“We are tapped on the amount of money that we can give because we don’t have money to give,” he said. “So if organizations want to grow, unfortunately, at this point, a lot of that growth will have to come from within.”
Tuley said the finance committee’s internal rules require student organizations to fundraise 25 percent of their requests, but the rule has not been enforced.
“It can be enforced, and I think future finance committees will be encouraged to enforce that,” he said. “And organizations will not be happy.”
Senators failed to pass an amendment to the bill, 9-12, that would have allowed the SBA to disburse funding to GW Law Revue 72 hours prior to the payment deadline in the hopes that the University-Wide Programs Fund would respond.
Senators unanimously approved a bill reforming the bylaws to require that student organizations hold elections for the positions of president, vice president and treasurer in the spring semester of each academic year. SBA Sen. Anissa Tanksley, who sponsored the bill, said the bill would help the SBA oversee student organizations and maintain contact with their leaders.
“We need to provide oversight for these student organizations that exist on this campus,” she said. “This is an area where we have been a little lacking historically.”
Senators unanimously approved the creation of the International Arbitration Students Association, which supplies a forum for law students to discuss international arbitration. Senators also unanimously approved the creation of GW Law itrek, the University’s chapter of a nationwide organization that travels to Israel.
Senators unanimously voted to ratify three constitutional amendments. The amendments control the transfer of power between the incumbent executive branch and the incoming executive branch, stipulate that the SBA’s two non-JD senators will be elected during the fall semester general elections and serve until the conclusion of their Non-Juris Doctorate Programs and clarify previous constitutional amendments.
The next SBA senate meeting will be held Feb. 21 at 9:15 p.m. in the Law Learning Center.

The U.S. House of Representatives Rules Committee voted Monday to send a formal disapproval of two D.C. Council bills to the House floor, where the chamber’s Republican majority is expected to vote in opposition to the legislation this week.
The committee voted 9-3 to send disapproval resolutions for D.C.’s revised criminal code and the Local Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2022 to the House floor after Republican committee members disagreed with the code’s progressive policies and raised concerns about the council’s prioritization of statehood and local voting rights. The House’s Republican majority is likely to pass the disapprovals, but the Republican’s disapprovals face an uphill battle in the Democratic Senate and White House, where the party majority has historically supported D.C.’s authority to self-govern.
The disapprovals are set to reach the House floor this week, but a date has not been set for the vote.
The formal disapproval opposes the D.C. Council’s revised criminal code, which the D.C. Council passed in November after a 16-year effort to refine “outdated” criminal laws originally written by Congress in 1901. If passed, the District will retire all mandatory minimum sentences, expand jury trials for misdemeanor convictions and allow inmates to petition for a reduced sentence to a judge starting in 2025.
Rep. James Comer, R-KY, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said he thinks the Council has chosen to make crime in the District worse by supporting the revised code’s “soft on crime” policies like scrapping mandatory minimum sentences amid upticks in carjackings and property crime. He said as a result of numerous judicial vacancies, D.C.’s “overloaded” court system will not be able to keep up with the demand for jury trials if the code is enacted.
Republicans at the meeting were critical of D.C.’s “elevated” crime rate, despite violent crime dropping by 7 percent while all crime dropped by 4 percent in the District in 2022, according to Metropolitan Police Department records.
“All Americans should feel safe in their capital city, but they don’t because of D.C. Democrats’ leniency towards criminals at the expense of American safety,” Comer said.
The D.C. Council overrode Mayor Muriel Bowser’s veto of the code on Jan. 17 with a 12-1 vote, despite her concerns about “easy” access to guns in the District and the code’s ability to keep the community “safe,” which she said was her “top priority” in a statement. Ward 8 Council member Trayon White was the only member in opposition of the veto’s override.
Tom Cole, R-OK, the chairman of the House Rules Committee, said because D.C. is seeing an “elevation” in crime, it would be “unconscionable” to adopt the newly revised criminal code because it doesn’t address the uptick.
“This bill was so bad that Mayor Muriel Bowser actually vetoed it only for the District of Columbia Council to override her veto,” Cole said. “Though, we’re actually on the side of the mayor and the Washington Post, which editorialized against that particular matter.”
Under threat of the entire bill’s repeal by the House GOP, Bowser proposed a package of changes for the code in an amendment act Monday, which would restore penalties on crimes that the public has expressed “concerns” about in recent months and push back the implementation date to 2027.
Ward 2 Council member Brooke Pinto, who represents the area surrounding Foggy Bottom and chairs the council’s judiciary committee, said she will consider Bowser’s amendment during public hearings in the future but will prioritize stopping Congress’ “undemocratic” interference in D.C. legislation in the present.
The D.C. Council passed the Local Voting Rights Amendment Act in November, which allows non-U.S. citizens the right to vote in D.C. local elections, with former Ward 3 Council member Mary Cheh the only member to vote in opposition. During the meeting, congressional Republicans voiced their dissent toward the bill, claiming liberals in D.C. are putting the integrity of the American election system “at risk” with the legislation.
Rep. Nick Langworthy, R-NY, said voting is a “core tenant” of American citizenship and that allowing non-U.S. citizens to vote “devalues” the definition of citizenship.
“The bottom line is allowing noncitizens here legally or illegally to vote in our domestic elections is a violation of our sovereignty and the sovereign rights of Americans,” Langworthy said.
Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-MD, who backed the D.C. bills throughout the hearing under scrutiny from other committee members, said while the District statehood is picking up “momentum” among voters, Republican committee members are “determined” to scrap the voting bill to put the D.C. residents “in their place.”
“They will be attacking Washington not just for its local voting rights policies and criminal justice code but for its gun safety policies, its defensive abortion rights and LGBTQ rights, its decriminalization of marijuana and dozens of other issues potentially headed to the House floor,” Raskin said.
Raskin said while the immigrant vote is “controversial” in national elections because of opposing considerations against it, the matter is different at the local level because communities hold similar interests as opposed to an entire country, like D.C. residents’ particular interest in statehood or their deep blue partisan majority.
“I think that that has always been left up to local communities to decide who should vote in local elections,” Raskin said.
The Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission passed the voting resolution when it came to their desk during a July meeting, with Commissioner Trupti Patel voicing her support for the bill because of the District’s large immigrant population.
President Biden’s administration said D.C.’s 700,000 residents have faced taxation without representation for too long and the disapprovals from GOP lawmakers are “clear” examples of D.C. citizens continuously being denied representation and statehood in a Monday statement.
“While we work towards making Washington, D.C. the 51st state of our Union, Congress should respect the District of Columbia’s autonomy to govern its own local affairs,” the release states.
Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-CA, said Democratic support of the D.C. statehood movement is about “consolidating power” and “enacting radical policies” in an April 2021 tweet. He said U.S. citizens can see through statehood’s “blatant power grab.”
A spokesperson for McCarthy did not return a request for comment.

The Hatchet incorrectly reported the D.C. council chose to override or veto the criminal code. Cole said the D.C. Council chose to override Bowser’s veto of the criminal code.
