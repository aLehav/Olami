The Lerner Health and Wellness Center scaled back its hours after students returned to campus following pandemic-related shutdowns, and is now open from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturdays and noon to 8 p.m. on Sundays. 
Students said they want officials to expand Lerner Health and Wellness Center hours after GW shortened the center’s operating hours in fall 2021 following the return to campus.
More than a dozen students said Lerner’s hours inhibit their ability to exercise at early morning or late night times after officials shortened the center’s operating hours by three hours on weekdays, five hours on Saturdays and four and a half hours on Sundays, according to the Lerner’s website archives. Officials said they shortened Lerner’s hours in the 2020-21 and 2021-22 academic years because of COVID-19 and hope to expand work-study options at the center.
Shane Dong, a third-year student in the School of Medicine and Health Sciences, said Lerner’s hours fail to accommodate his “rigid” academic schedule and that it would be “really nice” for Lerner to open earlier and close later.
“Lerner’s hours could be a little bit more flexible,” Dong said.
Lerner is open from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturdays and noon to 8 p.m. on Sundays, according to the center’s website. Before in-person classes and events ceased due to the pandemic in March 2020, Lerner was open from 6:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. on weekdays, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Saturdays and 11 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. on Sundays since at least spring 2014, according to the center’s website archives.
Officials allowed 500 on-campus students in fall 2020 to schedule hourly workout blocks at Lerner during the semester. Officials let 2,000 on-campus students in spring 2021 to work out at Lerner from 7 to 10 a.m. and 5 to 8 p.m. on weekdays.
Andre Julien, the director of Lerner, said officials decreased the center’s hours between fall 2020 and spring 2022 to adhere to D.C. and University COVID-19 mitigation guidelines. He said officials observed the “schedules and habits” of students, faculty and staff without COVID-19 mitigation efforts in place via GWorld card swipes at the center after Lerner reopened in October following its closure in May 2022 for heating, ventilation and cooling system renovations.
“This semester, as we welcomed our faculty and staff back into the building for the first time since March 2020, we have continued to track the check-ins and check-outs to monitor peak and slow times for individual students, faculty and staff who come to work out,” Julien said in an email.
All of GW’s 12 peer schools have gyms with longer hours than Lerner, except one of the University of Southern California’s three gyms, which is open for a shorter time than GW’s on weekends.
Julien said there was a reduction in Lerner work-study options for students in previous academic years due to “changes” in the center’s hours. He said Lerner officials have offered more work-study options at the center this year and plan to continue offering more options in the future.
“This year, as Lerner began its transition to a more fully operational building, we have been able to start offering more hours for students to work and foresee that continuing,” Julien said.
More than a dozen students said Lerner’s current hours limit the number of available hours they have to exercise at the center before and after classes.
Nicholas Smaldone, a senior majoring in international environmental studies and English, said he doesn’t understand why Lerner is slower in fully reopening post-pandemic than other University buildings that have adjusted back to pre-COVID hours. He said Lerner hasn’t been as “consistent” of a resource as he would have liked in college due to its hours and renovations.
“I don’t know why we still haven’t gone back to pre-COVID hours when everything else on campus is at least adjusting or adapting,” Smaldone said. “The gym was also being renovated like all this year, and it wasn’t even open.”
Nevan McNamara, a sophomore majoring in political science, said the center should be open until at least 10 p.m. if it cannot be open until midnight. He said Lerner’s hours, “tiny” space, hot temperatures and reportedly broken equipment that takes “weeks to fix” indicate a lack of administrative attention toward the center.
“It seems like they just don’t really care about the gym in general,” McNamara said.
Sofia Khugaeva, a freshman majoring in biomedical engineering, said the center opening at 7 a.m. makes it hard to work out before her 8 a.m. classes, when she would prefer to work out.
“I really wanted to go to the gym before class, but that’s not possible,” Khugaeva said.
Rigel Brown, a junior majoring in biomedical engineering, said he struggles to work out at Lerner because the center often closes before he is done studying, which can be “pretty late” as an engineering student.
“It’d be helpful if the school gym was open until midnight because there’s Planet Fitnesses and things where they have that,” Brown said.
Four candidates who ran for Student Association executive positions in April elections said they would extend Lerner’s hours because they are too short.
Edy Koenigs, a junior majoring in religion and political science who ran for SA president with a platform point of extending Lerner’s hours, said the center’s operating hours make the center “pretty inaccessible” to Muslim community members who observe Ramadan fasting because Lerner sometimes closes before they have time to eat after sunset and exercise.
“It forces students to choose between their social health and being with friends and forming relationships and their physical and mental health,” Koenigs said.
Koenigs said Lerner’s hours could negatively affect students’ academic performance because “a lot” of students use the center to sustain their mental health and clarity.
“We should provide this for students because it will help them,” Koenigs said.
Arya Thakur, a sophomore majoring in international affairs and finance who ran for SA vice president with a platform point of extending Lerner’s hours, said the center’s hours disproportionately disadvantage low-income students, who find it more difficult to purchase memberships for gyms that are open longer than Lerner.
“They can’t just go and buy a gym membership because GW is making it inconvenient to work out,” Thakur said.
Thakur said GW students should have a gym with longer hours after “paying so much” to attend the University.
“I think it’s very feasible to keep Lerner open, it’s just a question of whether the University wants to accommodate us or not,” Thakur said.

Each year, graduating editors are given 30 final column inches — “30” was historically used to signify the end of a story — to reflect on their time at The Hatchet, published in the final issues of the year.
Thinking about all the late-night editing, Adobe Premiere Pro errors and computer shutdowns and crashes, writing this may be the hardest thing I have done in my years on The Hatchet.
This is not just because I have spent all my time here on a multimedia team and have never taken a written piece before but because it is hard to summarize these past four years in about 2,000 words. But the only thing I can do is try.
Auden Yurman | Senior Photo Editor
I joined The Hatchet my freshman year as many SMPA students do, and as an eager new college student, I sent my application to just about every section. Video was the first to get back to me, so it was the one I decided to stick with. Within only a few months, I was promoted to video editor, where I have been this entire time. Other editors have come and gone, videographers have left the section and new ones have joined, but through all these years I have been the one constant for the video team. The little table in the back corner of the townhouse with the broken chair and computer that never seems to be able to stay on while editing a video has been my spot for all these years, and in a weird way, I am going to miss it. I will no longer be physically present there, but I hope to have brought some light to that back section that will be remembered long after I graduate.
I admit, my time on The Hatchet has in fact felt like it lasted forever. I have concluded that the newspaper is in its own universe, and for every year in the real world you spend on staff, about 20 years pass in the townhouse. By these time standards, I would be about 101 years old, which is fitting for someone who is the self-proclaimed Hatchet grandma. As the longest running current staff member, I have seen this paper shift and grow and change throughout the years. Even through all the times I’ve complained, ranted, wanted to quit and, frankly, really played into the “old person” character I have created for myself, I am glad I stuck around and would never trade these years for anything.
In the beginning, I saw The Hatchet as simply a part time job. I showed up on Sundays, talked to the two other video editors, went home, edited my videos and that was it. But as time has gone on, I have found community, acceptance and friendship in this paper. I have found lifelong friends and people that I know who will forever be in my corner. My one hope as I move on is that in the time I have been here, I have created this same feeling of community, acceptance and friendship for other people on staff.
While I have been a constant for The Hatchet, it has also been a constant for me. Every Sunday without fail I was sitting on the couch tucked away in the back corner during staff meeting. Each week I had dedicated time to editing videos. I have said “Sorry I can’t — I have The Hatchet!” too many times to count. Even in a global pandemic when people were sent home and life was filled with so much uncertainty, I still logged onto Zoom every Sunday and continued to produce video content. It was nice, and even though the paper can be unstable and filled with uncertainty at times, it is always there when you need it.

Overall, I am proud. This paper does some truly amazing work, and I am lucky to have been a part of it for so long. I covered important protests, an inauguration, a major show premiere, a townhouse séance and much more. This year alone I led the entire video section by myself, continued to put out content consistently and grew the section to be the biggest it has been in years. It is easy to get lost in all that’s bad and hard about The Hatchet, but taking one step back can reveal all the good that is there. And there is a lot of it.
To everyone I have met and those who have supported me along the way:
Auden Yurman | Senior Photo Editor
Sarah S.: You are seriously one of my favorite people I have met not only at The Hatchet but at GW. You are so funny, dedicated, kind, fun and so much more. I am so grateful for your friendship and support throughout the years, and I know that I have a friend forever with someone like you. I am so excited to see where you go in life, and I know that wherever you do end up, you are going to absolutely kill it. Not to be sappy, but I’ll miss our little couch in the back.
Lauren: You are one of the most amazing people I have met. You are so driven and passionate about all you do, and I admire it each and every day. It’s all laughs when the two of us are together, and I am grateful for the friendship that we have. Also always grateful for Steve Roberts’ class and those 15 minute breaks where we could dish on what was happening in The Hatchet that week. You’re an icon.
Jarrod: I am always in awe of you and all that you do. Running a section is a hard feat, let alone an entire paper. You are driven, passionate and possess an unwavering ability to be a leader. This is, by far, my favorite year of budgeting, and I always enjoyed spending about 5-10 minutes talking about actual videos and then spending the next 45 minutes gabbing away. I have no doubt that whatever you do and wherever you go, you are going to thrive.
Isha: You are such a light and a Hatchet staple, even after you graduated. Your love for this paper and all that happens with it, even in all the chaos, is so admirable. You are truly amazing, and I am SO excited to keep up with you and all your adventures. Like Lauren, you’re an icon<3
Auden: My photo bestie! You are such a breath of fresh air and one of my favorite people to see each Sunday. Your photo skills are insane, and there is no one else I could imagine leading the section. You’re funny, reliable and extremely talented. So excited for you and whatever comes your way!
Sejal: Podcast queen! You are insanely driven, creative and passionate, and I know that wherever you go in life, you are going to kill it. I have loved having you as my little Hatchet sister this volume, and I am so proud of everything you have accomplished. We have been with each other through a lot, and just know that I always have your back now and anytime in the future. Keep being you and keep being amazing.
Ethan: There is no other word I can use to describe you other than “amazing.” You are such a gift to The Hatchet, and one of the most talented writers I have ever seen. Thank you for bringing some community back into the little corner of the townhouse. All of our conversations have me dying laughing, and I loved having someone to be able to rant to on Sunday afternoons. You are truly amazing. Keep killing it and keep doing your vocal warmups!
Nuria: Along with Ethan, you have added such light and community into the back corner of the townhouse. You are a shining star and one of the best people The Hatchet has. You are insanely driven and put out some incredible work. I have no doubt that whatever you do and wherever you go, you are going to do something amazing.
Abby: My Philly-side of Pennsylvania twin! I actually think that we are the same exact person, and no one can convince me otherwise. You are one of the kindest people I have ever met and I am so happy The Hatchet brought you into my life. Keep being the icon that you are.
Jaden: You are a superstar. I know that you truly love this paper with all your heart, even when things get tough. You are such a wonderful person and have been such a key portion of this paper in every role you have been in. Cheering you on forever and always!
Shea: Prom date! You are such a sweetheart and bring such positive energy to the townhouse. I love everything about you and am so happy to have met you. Keep on shining you superstar! I will be cheering you on every step of the way.
Grace M. & Izzy: My design icons! I am so sad that I only got one semester each with the two of you this year, but you both bring me so much joy. I am always so proud of the two of you and all the work that you do. Keep killing it next volume! You both deserve all the good and happiness in this world.
Erika: I am still forever sad that you were taken from the video team. I knew from the beginning though that your work ethic and drive were far above other people, and I just get prouder and prouder with every story you write. Keep being amazing!
Grace C. & Nikki: You two are both such shining lights. Every time I see either of you, I know that I’m going to be smiling and laughing the whole time. You are both such stars, and I have no doubt that you are going to thrive next volume!
Nick & Zach: Thank you for always doing weekly recaps (even if it took a few text reminders…). You both are extremely dedicated and such Hatchet staples, and I am so excited to see what is in store for you both in Volume 120!
Tara: Grateful for our time both inside and outside The Hatchet. I am so excited to see where you end up, I know you will excel in all you do. Capstone course forever!
Ava, Nick & Charlie: I have no doubt that you guys are going to lead the video section with dignity and grace next volume. Lean on each other when needed, support one another, and most importantly, have fun. You’re inheriting a great section, and I cannot wait to see all the amazing things you all achieve! I’m going to be the first viewer on all your videos 🙂
Thais: Even though you left me all alone, you are still one of the greatest things The Hatchet has ever given me. You are so creative, and no one has ever matched my energy before quite like you do. I love you so much and miss you at every Hatchet thing. You are amazing, and I know that you will thrive in everything you do in life.
Dante & Heidi: Thank you both for all that you taught me! I would not be here today without the two of you. You were both so driven and such amazing leaders to follow in the footsteps of. The video team is what it is today because of you two.
Sarah R.: I don’t think there are enough words to be able to tell you how much of an impact you had on this paper. You were such a fearless leader, and I appreciated you so much when I was promoted to be a video editor and had no idea what I was doing. You are the epitome of grace, and I will forever be grateful for you taking a chance on freshman year me.
Aaron: Thanks for leaving (note the sarcasm). You’re a force of nature and truly saw a lot in your short time at The Hatchet (lol). Keep killing it in all that you do.
My Family: Thank you for your consistent and unwavering support in everything that I do. I could always count on each and every one of you when things got tough, and you have all been my biggest supporters through everything. I love you all so much.
My Friends: Thank you for listening to me rant and complain about The Hatchet and for also giving me a life outside of this paper. I think you know more about what is happening on this newspaper than some members of staff do. Forever will appreciate you all!

H Street is the backdrop for many #OnlyAtGW moments on our campus. For some students — including members of the editorial board — that includes getting hit, or nearly hit, by a car.
Student Association candidates, local officials and student researchers have looked at ways to turn H Street between 21st and 22nd streets into a shared space for motor vehicles and people. While these renovations — assuming the University and the city agree to them — may take several years to implement, it’s worth imagining what H Street might look like in the future. Renovating H Street with pedestrians in mind could make it safer and create a new community space on campus.
This isn’t the first time the University community has considered the safety of H Street — with the city’s approval, GW installed a crosswalk between Kogan Plaza and District House in fall 2018. But that hasn’t assuaged safety concerns at this hotspot for vehicle collisions on campus. District data shows drivers have struck at least six people on the 2100 Block of H Street since 2010. Two of those collisions occurred after officials installed the crosswalk in 2018, one in April 2019 and one in November 2019.
The flow of people crossing H Street, particularly at the two mid-block crossings outside District House and the University Student Center, doesn’t mix with motorized vehicle traffic. Other than the crosswalks, there’s no signal that drivers need to slow down as they travel the block — and without speed bumps or traffic lights, nothing’s forcing them to tap the brakes. So it’s pedal to the metal for drivers on long, straight, flat H Street. In 2020, The Hatchet reported more than 90 traffic collisions had occurred on the four blocks of H Street running through campus in the last decade, according to city data.
The solution isn’t just making H Street crossable — it’s changing how people, both pedestrians and drivers, use the street. There’s no single solution to traffic safety, and officials have a sliding scale of options to pick from. Of course, they could do nothing. But ideally, they’ll consider pedestrianizing H Street, sharing the road between people and cars or closing the block to cars entirely, opening up every inch of asphalt to the community.
What might this new, shared H Street look like? Whichever route officials take, the overall goals are the same — slow down traffic, make it easier to cross the street and reduce the risk and severity of collisions. To that end, we might see bollards, benches and bike racks to keep cars separate from pedestrians, while trees and planters could turn the straightaway of H Street into a curved, slalom-like course that would force drivers to slow down. It’d still be possible to drive and park on H Street — preserving access to the student center’s garage — just not as quickly or conveniently. But that’s a small price to pay for a better, safer street.
Renovating H Street may seem like a radical move, but pedestrian streets aren’t foreign to Foggy Bottom, let alone the rest of D.C. I Street is permanently closed to cars between 23rd and 24th streets, right by the Foggy Bottom Metro station. Instead of just another way to get somewhere, the street is a destination in its own right. It’s the site of a small park that hosts Foggy Bottom’s weekly farmers market and a space where students, staff from the nearby GW Hospital and passersby can relax.
The University has even closed off H Street before — officials restricted access to the street, Gelman Library, Kogan Plaza and parts of the student center during GW’s bicentennial celebrations in October 2021. The closure coincided with an Open Streets event on a three-mile-long stretch of Georgia Avenue between Columbia Heights and Brightwood that month, where the city temporarily closed streets to motor traffic and opened them to pedestrian use.
All that’s to say that both University and city officials know there’s a time and place where people can share or even take over a street that’s usually reserved for cars. With seating, shade and maybe the occasional food truck or community event, H Street could become a place to go to instead of a place to go through — think of the project as an expansion of Kogan Plaza.
The largest obstacle facing any renovation of H Street isn’t finding consensus — it’s putting whatever plans the University community, officials and Foggy Bottom residents agree to into action. The crosswalk between Kogan Plaza and District House had been a long time coming. It took officials 12 years to introduce final plans for the crosswalk between Kogan Plaza and District House since they initially proposed it in 2006.
To be clear, it’s not as if GW slow-walked the plan — it was always part of officials’ long-term vision for the University’s future. But any changes to H Street have to go through the city’s Office of Planning and the D.C. Department of Transportation, which rejected an earlier design of the crosswalk in 2016 because it was too wide.
Whether they’re accompanied by full presentations or just murmurs of something to come, any plan to pedestrianize or close H Street is preliminary at this point — and that’s precisely why it’s worth talking about. Even if it amounts to a few traffic cones or a metal barrier rather than the perfect pedestrian street, this is a chance for students to advocate for a transformational change on campus step by step.
The editorial board consists of Hatchet staff members and operates separately from the newsroom. This week’s staff editorial was written by Opinions Editor Ethan Benn and Contributing Opinions Editor Julia Koscelnik, based on discussions with Sports Editor Nuria Diaz, Managing Editor Jaden DiMauro, Culture Editor Clara Duhon, Design Editor Grace Miller and Social Media Director Ethan Valliath.

Brian Stamps, a lifestyle, sport and physical activity professor who teaches cardio kickboxing classes, said he uses upbeat anthems to motivate his students to get through another minute of push-ups in his classes.
The sounds in most GW classrooms consist of clicking keyboards and professor droning on during lectures — but in some classes, the halls are instead filled by the soaring guitar riffs of 1980s rock.
Professors from all corners of GW said their motivation for incorporating tunes ranges from using fast-flowing hip-hop lyrics to encourage students to pay close attention to a lecture to playing the hard-pounding drums of heavy metal to push pupils to give a punching bag one extra hit. Music plays a role in GW classes beyond lessons structured around music theory, with professors teaching subjects from cardio kickboxing to American cultural history playing music as a crucial part of their teaching style.
Gayle Wald, a professor of American studies and English who teaches about modern American cultural history, said she plays music as her students are settling into class, both to set a comfortable mood for the class ahead and to put the themes of that week’s lecture in the minds of students. Wald also encourages students to pay attention to the visual and narrative aspects like the video and reception of the tunes blasting over the lecture hall speakers by projecting the music videos onto the boards in her classrooms.
“I am teaching from the perspective of a cultural historian, so while I ask students to listen to music I am also very interested in extra-musical elements of listening: to video, the settings of musical consumption, fan culture, the function of memory, the role of the body/dance,” Wald said in an email.
Wald said she plays some classic songs all her students know, and while many enjoy just hearing music already at the top of their Spotify playlists, she also takes advantage of the opportunity to introduce students to activist artists, like Asian American musician No-No Boy who writes songs about Japanese internment camps. At the same time, Wald said students help her learn about new artists, like rapper MF Doom and alternative rock musician St. Vincent.
“It’s hard to keep up with new things, especially as you get older and your ears get more stuck in their ways,” she said.
Roy Grinker, a professor of cultural anthropology who specializes in courses on African culture, said he typically gets to class early and starts playing music like the high-energy Mexican band Grupo Frontera so students will feel comfortable coming up to him to ask questions about assignments, even if the music bears no relation to those assignments. Shy students are nervous to ask questions in front of the entire class, but Grinker said background noise gives students confidence, knowing that their classmates will not hear them.
“A silent classroom does not encourage students to approach me, or perhaps even talk with each other before a lecture begins,” Grinker said.
Grinker said he enjoys taking song requests from students for the beginning of class, but also believes in integrating relevant music throughout the course. He said song lyrics in particular are useful for helping students connect with each lecture’s subject matter for showing students how disempowered groups highlight their plight.
“Ice Cube, Public Enemy, NWA, Ice-T are some artists who I discuss in class for what they communicate about disillusionment with health care disparities, anger at racism and lost opportunities and demands for the recognition of injustices, past and present,” he said.
Brian Stamps, a lifestyle, sport and physical activity professor who teaches cardio kickboxing classes, said he uses music to motivate his students to get through another minute of push-ups in his classes. He said he tries to find songs with more than 120 beats per minute, a high tempo, like many classic rock songs because studies have shown these types of songs loosen the burdens of intense exercise.
“Do you ever try working out listening to nothing but what’s going on around you?” Stamps said. “It becomes very boring very quickly.”
Stamps said he also plays music during the class workouts he leads to introduce students to classic tracks they may not have heard before. He said he often starts his lessons with 1980s rock songs like Van Halen and AC/DC since that’s what he jammed to growing up, before moving into more contemporary pop and rock, but sometimes his students  view these songs as retro hits.
 “There’s nothing like having a Madonna song or Britney Spears song being referred to as an oldie,” he said. “That makes you go, ‘Oh, I’m really old.'”
Though it might be his formal job to help students gain physical strength and endurance, Stamps said he also finds pleasure in helping them do something completely unrelated — finding and enjoying new music.
“One of the things that I tell my students at the beginning of the semester is that my class should be a fun, stress-relieving class, and if anything or anyone is making it stressful, let me know so that I can fix it,” Stamps said. “Because if it’s stressful, I’m not doing my job. So I make it fun. And music helps.”

I can clearly remember the very first episode of the culture podcast that I did. It was 2020 and the end of freshman year. I was doing a story on how graduating seniors at the time were celebrating their commencement in light of the pandemic ruining previously planned festivities. I was set up at a desk in my bedroom back home in New Jersey, recording the podcast over a Zoom call and had hid all the embarrassing childhood toys and posters behind me to give the aura that I was a professional journalist and not a 19 year old stuck back home with my parents.
The seniors I interviewed lamented over family celebrations that would never take place and how they never got to truly say goodbye to their friends. I asked if they would come back for a commencement celebration in the future, but who could really look ahead a whole year, especially given the circumstances of the world.
Back then, I would get so nervous giving interviews and I hated listening back to the sound of my own voice. My transition onto staff consisted of awkward Zoom prodo meetings with a screen of turned-off cameras and culture pitches that all had to do with how COVID made everyone’s lives suck just a little more. My interactions with the rest of the paper were email chains and staring at colorful bubbles in the top corner of the workflow.
That’s the thing with my time here. So much of it was unplanned and unpredictable. When I started on The Hatchet during the fall of freshman year, I would never have imagined the next four years playing out as they did. But despite all the downs, stressful nights editing in my room and anxiously struggling to meet deadlines, I am also so incredibly proud of the way it all ended up.

I applied for the podcast section on a whim. I can’t give a definite reason for what drew me to it. I didn’t have any podcast or audio editing experience beforehand, but when filling out the application, I just remember clicking a bunch of buttons for sections to join and one of those buttons was for podcast. That whim turned out to be one of the most defining parts of my college experience.
I loved spending my first year as a reporter in the podcast section working on the news podcast, Getting to the Bottom of It. I would sit in on interviews, monitor audio and assist in making edits. Later on in the year I started helping out more with story pitches, reaching out to sources and doing small interviews. Second semester, I applied for the official podcast host position on staff.
I didn’t get it.
I didn’t get the position hosting our news podcast as I had hoped, but I didn’t exactly get rejected either. I was hired onto staff, but my exact role was still unclear. I was originally supposed to have a small culture segment at the end of the news podcast which then turned into a co-hosting position which then led to screw it, let’s just create a culture podcast.
What’s New Buff and Blue became my baby. I was given the opportunity to start something on The Hatchet from the ground up, create a new piece of the paper that would hopefully live on even after I graduate and move on to the next stage of my life.
Through my reporting, I have met and interviewed so many amazing people. I’ve talked to professional matchmakers, restaurant owners, scientists leading a cat census, paranormal investigators, student musicians and professional artists. I interviewed a psychic as he led a seance in our Hatchet Townhouse and trounced around DC to give advice on the ideal Valentine’s Day date. I’ve had so many incredible experiences, interacted with so many incredible people and made so many incredible friends.
College splits your life up into pieces. Digestible chunks of what in the end becomes one whole experience to look back on. I’ve always enjoyed how each semester can bring something new, people come and go from staff, positions shift, policies change. Each week I would get to tell a different story.
Interviews moved from the struggles of COVID shutdown to recovery from COVID shutdown to a campus and a city finally living its life again. I changed with it. I no longer cringe at the sound of my own voice, I lead interviews with more confidence and I’ve strengthened skills in editing I would never imagine from myself as a freshman.
I don’t know what I’ll do next in life or what role my time in The Hatchet will end up playing in the rest of my existence. I don’t even know how my legacy of the culture podcast will continue to live on in the future. Maybe the next year is still as unpredictable as it was back in my childhood bedroom as a freshman. Yet, all the same, I hope that this is just the beginning of something greater to come, and I can’t wait to hit play on episode two.
To all those who’ve supported me along the way, thank you.

Amanda: Where to even begin. I express a lot of my emotions through blunt humor, but I am able to be emotional and cheesy when needed and when talking about our friendship, I think it is called for. These past years on The Hatchet together have truly bonded us in unique ways, like finding out we were both born in the same hospital and that we each share a birthday with a US president. It’s crazy to think about how long we’ve been working together. So long, that your presence has been the most constant part of my time on The Hatchet even as everything else has shifted semester to semester. Our video-podcast collabs have been some of my favorite stories to work on. Being in a multimedia section can sometimes feel unforgiving, but it has never not been worth it because I know I have you to support me through it. I’m gonna miss hanging out with you in the back corner of the townhouse basement, telling wild stories from our weekend and complaining about the edits we have to do. I hope that wherever you end up after graduation, it is somewhere close to me. Otherwise, meeting up for happy hour will be very inconvenient.
Annie: Before I even had a conversation with you, I knew that I wanted to be your friend. You bring such a lively energy to both the paper and everyone else in your life that is impossible not to be infatuated with. I have had such a pleasure getting to know you this semester from collabing with you for your advice column to training you to take over the culture podcast next year! As I’ve mentioned before, What’s New Buff and Blue is my baby and I wouldn’t trust just anybody to take it over. You are so creative, funny and spirited and I can’t wait to listen to you on the podcast next volume!
Erika: At a Hatchet party during the beginning of last semester, I remember you coming over to talk to me and saying “I am so glad that I met you.” You probably couldn’t tell between the dim lights of the party and the sounds of screaming drunk kids, but I got so choked up at what you said and almost started crying. You are one of the most hardworking and amazing people on The Hatchet. I am so impressed at the amount of work and coverage you do for this paper. And at the end of it all, you still manage to be the sweetest person ever. I hope you know that I am so glad that I met you too.
Sejal: Each week, I get slightly, secretly competitive when they read analytics to see if the news pod or culture pod received more listens. Yet I still have to admit that when news pulls ahead, you always deserve it. You came into the podcast section with a vision and over the last year and a half have done an amazing job at executing it. You tell amazing stories, have a great podcast voice and do a stellar job at banter with who you interview. Keep telling amazing stories next year because you know I will be reading them!
Max: You have been such a welcome addition to our podcast family. It’s been amazing watching you grow in the section and as a staff member within the rest of the paper. I wish you the best of luck next volume covering metro!
Ethan V: Ever since the very first day you showed up to the podcast reporter meeting, I was so impressed with you. You have always been so thoughtful and well spoken and you were always the obvious choice to take over the podcast when I left to go abroad. Listening to you every week kept me connected to my life at GW when I was away. It’s too bad that you left the podcast section, but you are doing a phenomenal job in social media. I can’t wait to see what you’ll do next!
Ethan B: There’s a reason I rarely do my work at the townhouse. One of the best parts of prodo is chilling in the basement with you, laughing and joking around instead of actually getting our edits done. You are such a hilarious person and I always look forward to hanging out with you after staff meeting, talking about the op-eds you’re working on and hearing you criticize my hot takes. Even though I would be way more productive without your distractions, I still can’t help hanging back in the townhouse for just a couple hours while pretending to do work.
Nuria: I don’t envy the job you have, but I do envy your amazing skill and drive. It takes an incredible person to manage the sports section with the talent and motivation that you have, and there will definitely be a hole in this paper when you are gone next semester. I’ve enjoyed getting to know you this year through hanging out after staff meetings, and I hope I have not been too annoying while you are trying to get work done.
Auden: To whoever is reading this, if you like the photos then you have Auden to thank. I had so much fun on our little photo shoot and I am so happy with how the pictures have turned out. You are such a talented photographer and I know you will only continue to do amazing work in the next volume.
Alec: I remember meeting you exactly one time before COVID moved us online to train into our new positions for that volume. That year, 90 percent of my human interaction on The Hatchet came from talking to you during our budgeting and reporter meetings. When we finally did come back in person, it was nice to automatically have you there as a friend. I was always so impressed with what you accomplished every week on the news podcast. You were always so prepared and knew the perfect questions to ask. I’m amazed with all you’ve been doing since leaving The Hatchet and I hope you’re proud of the work you’ve left behind.
Sarah Roach: I hope you realize the immense impact you’ve had on everyone who was fortunate enough to work with you. You were essential in helping me not only create What’s New Buff and Blue, but also develop the skills and confidence needed as a reporter. You were always so helpful in the day-to-day process of creating the podcast that it was easy to forget that you were also managing the rest of the paper in addition to me. I hope in my time here that I’ve been able to become even 10 percent of the journalist you were.
Gwyn Wheeler: I honestly don’t know how our section has managed to function since you left. You have such incredible talent with music and audio editing that I will never be able to live up to. Though it was chaotic and short lived, I hope you enjoyed the time we got together on The Hatchet and I hope you know how much I admire you.
Meredith: I am so glad that you had so much faith in a freshman with no prior podcast experience. You were my very first editor on The Hatchet, my mentor through my growth as a multimedia reporter. Those Friday and Saturday afternoons recording in the townhouse basement with you were pivotal to my interest in podcasting and what drove me to become more involved in the paper. I hope that I have managed to live up to the legacy that you started with the podcast section!
My Reporters: Chloe: You have such a sweet personality and I love how eager you always are to take on assignments. I hope you continue to do work for The Hatchet because I know you have so much talent in you. Robert: It has been so great getting to know you each week during our podcast meetings. I appreciate the dedication you’ve kept for this section and hope you keep pursuing it because you have so many great ideas and insights. Capucine: At the very beginning of the semester, you told me that you were scared of asking interview questions and hearing your voice recorded. Since then, it has been amazing to see all the confidence you have acquired. I wish you the best of luck in your future journalism career and hope that podcasting continues to be apart of it. Sarah: If you ever decide to come back to the US, you should definitely get a career in podcasting because us Americans are obsessed with a British accent. Accent or not, you’ve been a delight to have in my section this year and I hope I’ve helped make your study abroad experience as amazing as possible. Nick: You have spent this entire year absolutely killing it in podcast and I know that next year, you will absolutely kill it as video editor. You always have amazing pitches, lead interviews with such grace and I appreciate the enthusiasm you would bring to every meeting. I can’t wait to see everything else you will accomplish on The Hatchet in the future.
Mom, Dad and Gwen: If the podcast only got one listen each week, I know it would be you guys. You’re not only my number one supporters, but also the number one supporters of the paper as a whole. Sometimes I learn about the most recent Hatchet news through the family group chat before I even check the website myself. Every challenge I’ve ever had to face has been made so much easier knowing that I have a supportive family who has my back through it all. I hope that in the future, I can continue to make you guys proud.
All my friends: To all my friends who listened to my podcasts and read my articles. The friends who put up with me constantly working or stressing about work and gave me a shoulder to complain on. The friends who learned when I had Hatchet meetings and knew to schedule events around it. To everyone who supported me on this journey, I love you all. ♥️

A student model sports a vibrant crocheted top and baggy dark-washed jeans during the spring-themed fashion show at the GWU Textile Museum Friday. 
For co-founder of GW Sustainable Fashion Ari Rivadeneira, fashion is an art, but the fast-paced industry process has corrupted this powerful form of expression. 
A total of 19 student models walked the Sustainable Fashion Show runway wearing bright scarves, fashionable sunglasses and flashy pearl belts in GW Sustainable Fashion’s event at the GWU Textile Museum Friday. Rivadeneira said the event’s mission was to spread awareness about alternatives to the fast fashion brands whose unsustainable production practices harm the environment.

“We only have one world and we can’t exploit it anymore,” Rivadeneira, a junior studying environmental science and sustainability, said. “I don’t really think there’s a need for fast fashion at all. We want to keep this world and respect it and have it for future generations.”
The club borrowed the models’ clothing from local clothing shops in the DMV, including Tribute Collective, Happy Flores Shop and Slowdown Market and took clothes from the closet of student designer London Skye Roberson, a co-founder of GW Sustainable Fashion. 
“The point was to kind of show people that there’s a lot of local resources,” Rivadeneira said. 
With planning for the show beginning in January, Rivadeneira said the event focused on promoting sustainable outfitting through upcycling, a form of purchasing secondhand items and hand-making clothing. Rivadeneira said the broad theme of the collection, spring season, allowed them to find pieces with a variety of silhouettes, styles and colors — clothes that “you would wear on a sunny day” like bright skirts and accessories to match the moment like chic sunglasses.
On a rectangular runway surrounded by chairs, models showcased several pieces of handmade clothing on the corners of the stage, including a vibrant lime-green knit matching crop top and mini skirt set courtesy of Roberson. Another model sported a pair of gradient yellow and red pants hand-painted with blue abstract scribbles from The Slum Studio, a Ghanaian brand that creates hand-printed textiles and designs from fabrics that are designated as rubbish in an attempt to ameliorate the textile waste problem Ghana is currently facing.
“A lot of the pieces are really thought out and were either made by hand or have taken a long time to produce, it’s not like a machine that just keeps on making the same garment,” Rivadeneira said.
Several models dressed in secondhand and vintage items including accessories like sunglasses and platform shoes. Rivadeneira said aside from the stylistic benefits of wearing vintage clothing, buying secondhand ensures clothes are able to live a longer life outside of a landfill.

“Getting secondhand items, it’s like you’re taking a piece from a different decade that has a different story and putting it into your narrative and stuff,” Rivadeneira said. “I think it’s beautiful.”
Rivadeneira condemned microtrends and the tendency of people to purchase clothing that is momentarily the rage before it becomes outlandishly outdated, causing people to stop wearing the clothes and throw them away. She said clothing should instead be focused on “expressing yourself” and finding pieces “to wear forever.”
“Just having pieces that fit you — literally fit you like are tailored for you, but also that just fit your personality — is so much more meaningful than just kind of following whatever trends and stuff are in the magazines like an hour ago,” Rivadeneira said. 
The models were all students who auditioned and were selected to walk the runway — Rivadeneira said they wanted to accept everyone interested in modeling. Ruth Holliday, a member of Sustainable Fashion’s programming board, said the models were given creative freedom to pick out their own outfits, with hand-painted spring-colored pants and old shorts lined with eye-catching lace all through the event space.
After braving a torrential downpour, Holliday rocked the taupe rain boots she came in with on the runway. Holliday said she was nervous to model, completely avoiding eye contact with audience members as she walked the runway, but found the performance itself “exhilarating.”
Anabel Brentar, a junior majoring in economics, modeled an upcycled pair of shorts adorned with ruffles and embroidery, a big black T-shirt reading “Punk Revolution Now” and a chair around her waist with thin metal rings. Brentar said she was nervous to perform in front of an audience at first, but she was proud to be part of such an important initiative.
“People are buying what’s new and what’s next, but we can still have really cool clothes and killer outfits with things that have already been worn or just that are handmade,” Brentar said.
Reva Dalmia, a freshman majoring in international business, said she was excited to exercise her confidence on the runway and loved the feeling of “commanding the stage.”
“When it comes to modeling or doing fashion shows, you really need to learn to be comfortable in your own skin and with what you’re putting out there,” Dalmia said. “This is something that just helps me be more confident in myself.”
Rachel Schwartz | Assistant Photo Editor
Dalmia said the show’s environment was welcoming and all the participants — models and organizers — were supportive as no one placed blame on each other, even when mistakes were made.
“It’s very low key,” Dalmia said. “If you mess up or if you do a pose that you didn’t want to do, no one’s gonna really judge you for it. Just being there surrounded by all my friends and the new friends that I made just put me in a really good environment.”
Dalmia said she is concerned with how fast trend cycles cause so many pieces of clothing to end up in landfills and she said it is important to raise awareness about various sustainable initiatives.
“More people are starting to realize that fashion, being one of the biggest contributors to environmental waste and those kinds of issues, it’s something that we really have to pay attention to,” Dalmia said.

Junior pitcher Chris Kahler earned the top conference's weekly pitching accolade a second time after pitching another complete game against VCU
In his third season with the Colonials, junior pitcher Chris Kahler has hit his stride, grabbing personal accolades and helping even his squad’s Atlantic 10 record.
Kahler’s ERA has dramatically improved from his freshman and sophomore marks of 5.17 and 6.62, respectively, and he now sits at third in the A-10 with a 3.21 ERA, helping him earn back-to-back conference Pitcher of the Week awards last month. After pitching primarily as a reliever in his first two years on the team, Kahler’s starter status has allowed him to pitch three complete games and notch four wins this season, tied for best on the squad.
“I told myself there were three things I wanted to do,” Kahler said. “One, be A-10 Pitcher of the Week. Two, win A-10 Pitcher of the Year. And three, lead the team in virtually every category I possibly can.”
Kahler pitched a complete game against Fordham April 16 to clinch the series, earning the Colonials their second series win of the season and his first Pitcher of the Week title April 17. Kahler struck out 10 batters in 127 pitches throughout the game while giving up just two runs and two walks.
He said as the season has progressed, he has adjusted the types of pitches he relies on, specifically his fastball and slider. Kahler said while he’s not an “overpowering” arm zipping his fastball between 88 and 90 MPH, he credits most of his strikeouts to his heater.
“I would say I hit my spots very well and rely on my fastball,” Kahler said. “I feel like I just have the conviction and knowing when to get there, getting that ball there and just let everything else happen and fall in place. And I think most of my strikeouts have been on fastballs this year and down the wedge.”
During his sophomore season, Kahler pitched, mostly as a reliever, going for 35.1 innings and maintaining a 6.62 ERA. He attributes his success and improvements this year to his new mental approach. 
“I’m very hard on myself, and any person who knows me at this school, especially on the baseball aspect, knows how hard I am on myself when it comes to baseball,” Kahler said. “So I think a lot of people — and it’s probably a fair statement — a lot of people probably call me crazy in some regards with that.”
Kahler earned the top accolade a second week in a row April 24 after pitching another complete game against VCU, striking out eight batters before giving up a walk, leading to a series win. He also surrendered two runs off four hits. 
Kahler said despite the teams’ initial struggles, with lopsided series losses against both East Carolina and Fairfield in February, he hopes his teammates continue to bond and keep up their momentum as they battle through the A-10 slate.
“We’re finally starting to click a little bit,” Kahler said. “The season we’ve hoped for has really been showing up these past two weekends between Fordham and here. I think we’re playing our best ball right now — playing defensively, clean hitting and pitching has been great.”
In GW’s Saturday win over Davidson, Kahler headed to the mound as a reliever in the top of the sixth with two runners on and two outs. He closed the inning and kept the score even at 1-1, striking out senior shortstop Jacob Hinderleider swinging.
In the seventh, Kahler allowed two singles, but two groundouts and a flyout stranded both the runners. In the top of the next eighth with the game still knotted up at 1-1, the junior tacked on two more strikeouts, keeping the Wildcats off the board.
After a single from sophomore outfielder Sam Gates scored in graduate student catcher Anthony Frechette, GW took the lead going into the top of the ninth. Kahler slammed the door on Davidson in the top of the frame, throwing his fourth and fifth strikeouts before securing the victory on a popup to first base.
Sunday’s third game against the No. 1 ranked A-10 squad was rained out, but the series split helped even GW’s conference record to 7-7 and placed them squarely in the middle of the standings.
“The team goal is not just to make the playoffs, but I want to win the A-10 Championship,” Kahler said. “I don’t want to get there and just have to sit there.”

The lab staff said on top of their STI research, the lab processes 300 COVID tests per week, a decline from about 3,000 tests per day last academic year.
Researchers at GW’s Public Health Lab are fundraising to develop free, at-home sexually transmitted infection tests for students.
Jack Villani, the laboratory’s manager, said at-home STI collection kits will allow GW students to privately collect swab samples of their throats, genitals and rectums and return them to the lab to test for STIs like chlamydia and gonorrhea. He said the lab — which currently processes COVID tests — will refer students with positive tests to the Student Health Center and hopes the system will reduce the social stigma surrounding sexual health.
Villani said the lab is currently seeking up to $500,000 in funding to cover the cost of supplies and labor to process the tests so officials can offer the tests to students. Villani said the release date of the kits depends on when the lab receives funding and that the team is currently seeking out a “funding opportunity” from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as other federal funding sources.
“We believe that this type of testing is of greatest benefit when there is no cost to the individual so, ideally, we would like to have this project be fully funded and not require any payment from the individual,” Villani said in an email.
A CVS-brand STI kit for gonorrhea, chlamydia and trichomoniasis costs $89.99, according to the CVS website.
GW would be the only one of its 12 peer schools to offer free, at-home STI test kits. John Hopkins University School of Medicine offers at-home STI test kits for no charge.
Villani said the lab’s STI collection kits will offer testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea, among others, in the throat and rectum, which will address a “public health concern” because STIs can spread asymptomatically through those areas and the “standard” chlamydia and gonorrhea test only samples urogenital specimens. He said the DC Health and Wellness Center, which provides care and treatment for STIs in the District, only tests for chlamydia and gonorrhea using a urogenital sample, meaning the lab’s STI kits will expand access to sexual health services in D.C.
“These sites are considered neglected for screening for STIs but are believed to be commonly responsible for asymptomatic transmission,” Villani said. “With this in mind, we can design our kits to include these sites and help address this public health gap.”
Villani said college students experience STIs at a higher rate than the general population. He said the kits the lab is developing would help “capture” asymptomatic cases when people are unknowingly spreading an STI, since many asymptomatic cases go undetected.
D.C. has the 17th-highest STI incidence rate of all U.S. cities, with 1,393 cases per 100,000 people, according to a CDC report. One in four college students have an STI, and 80 percent of afflicted individuals are asymptomatic, according to a study by Washington and Lee University.
“It’s a major public health concern in D.C. and in any urban center and a passion project for me and a lot of other people here at GW,” Villani said.
The lab staff said on top of their STI research, the lab processes 300 COVID tests per week, a decline from about 3,000 tests per day last academic year. Villani said the decrease in COVID tests allowed the lab “more bandwidth” to begin developing the STI kits in summer 2022.
Jorge Sepulveda, the lab’s medical director, said the lab team is trying to “leverage experience” in creating other at-home test kits to adapt their lab infrastructure’s robotic pipetting — robots that measure and move liquids — for other forms of large-scale disease testing, like STI screening. He said lab staff hope more people will opt to get tested for STIs because at-home tests eliminate the need to see a physician unless they receive a positive test.
“That’s sometimes a big barrier to getting tested, and there’s a lot of asymptomatic infection,” Sepulveda said. “If we can remove this barrier, it will hopefully have a positive impact.”
The CDC recommends anyone who engages in risky sexual behavior, sexually active women younger than 25 and men who have sex with men should be tested annually for gonorrhea and chlamydia. Men who have sex with men should also test for all STIs “more frequently” if they have multiple or anonymous partners, according to the CDC.
The CDC does not offer a recommendation for annual STI screening for men who have sex with women, citing “insufficient evidence” for regular testing among men at “low risk” for STIs.
DC Health provides free, confidential, at-home and in-lab STI tests for District residents ages 13 and up through Get Checked D.C., a program providing HIV and STI testing to D.C. residents, according to the agency’s website.
Maddy Niziolek — a co-president of GW Reproductive Autonomy and Gender Equity, a student organization for reproductive justice and sex positivity — said on-campus access to free, at-home tests would benefit students who don’t have time to visit the SHC, can’t afford a doctor’s appointment or feel a “stigma” from seeing a medical professional for STI testing. Niziolek said at-home STI tests would be helpful to students who previously experienced racism, ableism or misogyny in health care and would prefer waiting to consult a professional until they know if their test came back positive.
The SHC offers STI testing, screening, treatment and counseling by appointment as a primary care service, according to the center’s website.
“They would really be able to fully control their own health and practice autonomy over their own sexual health and be able to test on their own time,” Niziolek said.
Yuka Manabe, the director for the Center for Innovative Diagnostics for Infectious Diseases at Johns Hopkins University and current leader of I Want The Kit — a program established in 2004 that provides free at-home STI tests for the state of Maryland as well as nine other states through the Indian Health Service — said offering at-home testing is particularly helpful for women, whose STIs are often asymptomatic. About 50 percent of women with gonorrhea and 70 percent of women with chlamydia experience no symptoms, according to the American Society for Microbiology.
Manabe said the program is helpful in expanding access to STI testing as some of the highest-risk groups are less likely to have health insurance and at-home STI tests from drugstores can be expensive.
“You have to increase the ways that people can get access because not everyone wants to go to an STI clinic and sit there and wait,” Manabe said.

David Diemert, the clinical director of GW’s Vaccine Research Unit, said researchers expect the vaccine's safety to be comparable among adolescents and adults.
The School of Medicine and Health Sciences will begin clinical trials to determine if a vaccine used to prevent mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, in adults is safe and effective for youth.
David Diemert, the clinical director of GW’s Vaccine Research Unit, said the unit will conduct a yearlong trial of the Jynneos mpox vaccine, assessing antibody responses in 12- to 17-year-olds, which the Food and Drug Administration will use to determine the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness before they approve the shot for adolescents. Diemert, a professor of medicine, said if approved, an effective vaccine would have a “huge impact” on stopping and preventing mpox outbreaks for adolescents in the United States and across the globe.
He said the National Institutes of Health chose GW as one of 18 sites across the country to perform clinical trials, which include universities, hospitals and clinics. Diemert said GW will monitor about 40 adolescent participants and the 18 sites will monitor a total of 315 adolescents and a comparison group of 135 adults aged 18 to 50.
“If the vaccine is approved for those under 18 years, it will mean that we’ll have an effective tool at our disposal to quickly and effectively stop future outbreaks of mpox,” Diemert said in an email.
He said there were only “a handful” of mpox cases among people under the age of 18 during the virus’ outbreak in the United States in 2022, but there are “frequent” child mpox cases in Africa, where the first human became infected with the virus.
Diemert said GW researchers will administer two injections of the vaccine to participants one month apart and follow participants for one year, looking at antibody responses that are “predictive” of protection against the disease. He said participants will complete a diary card to record symptoms, like injection site reactions and fatigue, for seven days following each injection.
He said GW is currently recruiting adolescent participants on social media and through local pediatricians, teen health clinics, health departments, parent groups and former adult study participants who may have teenage children.
He said NIH provides funding to the University for conducting the trials dependent on the number of people enrolled, which will cover “salary support” for the 15 researchers conducting the trials, supplies, participant compensation, pharmacy services and “recruitment activities,” but did not specify the exact amount of funding GW will receive.
Diemert said researchers expect the vaccine’s safety to be comparable among adolescents and adults, with similar expected reactions, which include injection-site reactions like swelling or temporary pain and generalized reactions like temporary fatigue, achiness and fever.
“Regarding safety, there is a lot of data already on the JYNNEOS vaccine in adults, and we don’t expect there to be any big differences in the expected reactions to the vaccine in younger people,” Diemert said.
The DC Department of Health has logged 528 mpox cases in the District since the virus first reached D.C. in May 2022 but fewer than five cases in residents under the age of 18, according to department data as of Sunday. DC Health officials have administered 39,502 doses of the mpox vaccine as of Sunday, including a dozen vaccines to people under the age of 18 after D.C. began offering Jynneos mpox vaccine appointments in June 2022, when the District had the highest number of mpox cases per capita of any state.
The FDA approved the use of the Jynneos vaccine to treat mpox in adults over 18 in 2019 and for emergency use in people under the age of 18 in August 2022 after the Department of Health and Human Services declared mpox a public health emergency that month.
Since May 2022, 22 people in the District have been hospitalized for mpox, but no District resident has died from the virus, according to DC Health data. Symptoms of mpox include rash, fever, exhaustion and muscle aches and typically begin within three weeks of exposure to the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Infectious disease experts said expanding mpox vaccination to include minors will help prevent future outbreaks because the vaccines will increase protection for adolescents susceptible to mpox infection through close or sexual contact.
Ian Lipkin, a professor of epidemiology and director of the Center for Infection and Immunology at Columbia University, said vaccinating people under the age of 18 will prevent infection in adolescents who are sexually active or before they become sexually active because mpox is often spread during sexual contact.
Lipkin said it is possible that the mpox virus can evolve to become more transmissible and spread without close contact. He said widespread vaccination, including in adolescents who can also spread the virus, helps protect against a potential future resurgence of mpox cases.
“The more people who are vaccinated, the higher the probability that we’ll be able to abort an outbreak and prevent a pandemic,” Lipkin said.
Although never considered a pandemic, the World Health Organization declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern in July 2022 and the CDC recorded mpox cases in 111 countries. Mpox is transmitted through close or direct contact with bodily fluids, rashes or scabs from a person infected with the virus, according to the CDC.
Peter Gulick, a professor of medicine at Michigan State University who administers mpox vaccines at his clinical practice, said vaccine testing among adolescents is necessary to reduce transmission because teens can spread the virus through prolonged close contact, even if they are not sexually active.
He said he administers mpox vaccines to individuals at high risk for mpox, like those who are immunocompromised, have multiple sexual partners and individuals with HIV, in accordance with CDC recommendations. He said some adolescents may also be at high risk for mpox if they engage in risky behavior.
“It’s a disease that anybody can pick up by close contact,” Gulick said. “And so young kids, even if they don’t have any kind of sexual contact, they can just touch people that have had mpox in those areas on the arms, and the chest and everything. If they have prolonged contact with those open lesions, they can get mpox.”
