Metropolitan Police officers arrested a student Friday for possession with intent to sell marijuana and possession of LSD – the sixth arrest for intent to distribute drugs this academic year.
Officers seized seven Ziploc bags of marijuana, a personal supply of LSD and $687 in cash from a Guthridge Hall room at about 3:48 a.m., according to police documents. They also discovered a black and silver scale, as well as empty Ziploc bags and freezer lock bags in 19-year-old Connor O’Neill’s room. He said Thursday that he did not face charges.
Six of the seven students arrested for drugs in the first month of school were busted for intent to distribute, University Police Chief Kevin Hay said. During the same period last year, just one student out of the five drug arrests was busted for intent to sell, he said.
This year’s busts also uncovered harder drugs.
Two students were found with cocaine and ecstasy in Munson Hall Aug. 31. The other three students this year were arrested for marijuana, and two were charged with intent to sell. MPD also arrested a former student Sept. 20 for possession with intent to sell heroin and amphetamines, and for having an unregistered rifle and ammunition.
Last year, four of the five arrests in the first month of classes involved marijuana at parks near campus. The student arrested for intent to distribute was found in Mitchell Hall.
Hay said though the number of arrests has increased, he does not consider it unusual, because there has been “less than one resident arrested for every thousand students” living on campus.
Students are increasingly alerting UPD of their neighbors’ alleged drug use, Hay said, adding that students report seeing smoke or smelling marijuana in hallways or complain of loud music.
“Some students take offense to drug use happening in their residence halls. They don’t want to be around it, and the students call GWPD,” Hay said. “As these cases are reported, we will take action.”
Officers patrolling residence halls also look out for smoke and odor, he said, but the force is not adjusting protocol as a result of the recent arrests.
Gabriel Slifka, director of the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities, said most students who are suspended or expelled are caught with “illegal drugs, such as cocaine, MDMA, hallucinogens, the possession of marijuana in significant quantities or multiple violations of the University’s drug policies.”
Thirteen drug arrests were made in 2010 on the Foggy Bottom Campus, according to UPD data filed with the Department of Education, compared to the seven reported in the past month. UPD must report statistics for the 2011 calendar year to the department next month.
Slifka said the majority of drug violations on campus are for small quantities of marijuana and would not typically result in suspension or expulsion “unless there are particular aggravating circumstances such as the distribution of marijuana to other individuals.”
The office took an education-based turn this year, outlining consequences for drug violations in a flow chart. Students who receive violations for illegal drugs must complete substance abuse education, and first-time drug users could earn an administrative record and a $50 fine.
Slifka said the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act barred him from releasing what disciplinary actions the office handed out for arrested students.

The leader of the Student Association Finance Committee is asking the University to put more money toward EMeRG.
The student-run emergency medical unit receives most of its funds from the University, but typically picks up a few thousand dollars each year from the SA Finance Committee, which allocates funds from student fees. But this year, EMeRG requested about $13,000 for new uniforms, $6,000 to lease a new Ford Explorer for use on the Mount Vernon Campus and $800 for a new laptop for record-keeping.
EMeRG received $8,000 from the SA this year, a $3,000 hike from last year. The funds are meant to cover “non-essential” expenses, while GW picks up its necessary costs.
Alex Mizenko, the chair of the finance committee, said the costs should not come out of students’ pockets.
“I was shocked to find what kind of things that EMeRG was requesting,” Mizenko said. “I just don’t think these are costs the students should be funding through what is supposed to be a student activity fee.”
Mizenko said the SA increased its financial support for the student-run ambulance service to show “commitment to student health,” but said it would not be sustainable to continue upping the group’s funding in future years.
The finance committee chair said he was willing to support the group’s programming, like its CPR classes, but said the SA should not pay for new members’ uniforms.
The finance committee has given EMeRG between $6,000 and $8,000 in recent years. But the SA cannot direct specific expenditures for any organizations it funds.
EMeRG typically transports about 30 students a week to the hospital, saving students an $800 charge for D.C. Fire and EMS’s service.
EMeRG coordinator Stephen Gerber said the University put forward the funding for operational costs,  like $12,000 for a second ambulance and supplies, “without any trouble.”
Gerber said he does not think EMeRG’s requests were extraordinary, because the group asked for funding for the EMS Day showcase, which takes place in Kogan Plaza.
“Over the years, EMeRG has increasingly been seen as an essential service of the University, and the University has graciously provided funding for our organization accordingly,” Gerber said.
Student groups requested $3.3 million dollars this semester from the finance committee, which had only $940,000 dollars to give out. Mizenko said he was worried about the growing number of student organizations, which is nearing 500. Earlier this month, he proposed the SA increase student fees by $1 per credit hour to double their existing budget.
Darrell Darnell, the senior associate vice president of safety and security, said uniforms are “non-essential items” for EMeRG, and said the University would not purchase them for the group.
“The University fully supports EMeRG and believes it provides a vital and important service that enhances the safety of our students and the GW community,” Darnell said.
Other student organization leaders, including co-executive producer for the Generic Theatre Company Rachel Bell, called out the SA for funding EMeRG’s extra expenses.
“EMeRG needs to be an entity of the University that is completely separate from the Student Association,” she said.
The SA’s allocation decisions went out Monday, but groups have until Oct. 1 to appeal for additional funds. The allocations bill will reach the Senate floor Oct. 1 for approval.

An aide helps Jaggar DeMarco get to class and put laundry away. But on Friday nights, the freshman – who has muscular dystrophy and is confined to a wheelchair – is on his own.
He said his disability has limited him from meeting other students, and he often opts to stay in his Thurston single at night.
“I would like to go out, but most of the [fraternities] aren’t accessible, and I’ve heard horror stories with clubs denying people in wheelchair entrances,” DeMarco said. He said he has been to one fraternity party at a house that has an accessible back patio.
Disability Support Services has helped him adjust to academics with classroom and tutoring services, but it does not focus on the social transition to college, which DeMarco said could have helped him meet other students and learn from their experiences.
“As great as DSS is, having peers who are around your age in similar circumstances, is much easier,” DeMarco said. “DSS can only help with academics, but there’s a lot more stuff that encompasses having a disability.”
DeMarco hopes to launch a support network for students with disabilities next semester, after the adjustment to college becomes smoother.
The University focuses its disability services on academics and does not have programs or organizations geared toward easing the social transition to college, DSS Director Christy Willis said.
The academically focused office has stepped up its one-on-one support this year, adding time management and writing tutoring, Willis said. It also created partnerships with the University Writing Program and GW Law School this fall and will launch a workforce recruitment program for students with disabilities next month.
But as the office builds up, Willis said its focus will remain in the classroom. There are no guide programs for disabled students, like the support systems that exist for veterans, transfers, international students and freshmen.
“Certainly we play a role in access to University-sponsored events, but in terms of social integration, it’s not really our role,” Willis said. “We serve as a referral resource to needing additional support outside of the classroom.”
A community feel 
Over the years, DSS has fielded requests from parents who want their children to get more involved on campus and asked the office to step up programming with student interactions, most commonly when their student is on the autism spectrum, Willis said.
Some of DSS programs help students communicate better and become more independent, she said, in addition to referring students to private-practice life coaches across Foggy Bottom.
Director of the Center for Student Engagement Tim Miller has also met with four or five students on the autism spectrum in the last few years, helping them develop leadership skills and campus connections.
The CSE has not created specific programming for disabled students, Miller said, because many don’t want to be defined by their disabilities. He added that even without a formal mentorship program, DSS maintains a “community and family feel.”
One of Miller’s former mentees, Elliot Bell-Krasner, said Miller built up his confidence through their regular meetings. He said Miller also pushed him to advocate for student issues even after his bid for Student Association executive vice president failed.
“I would have benefited from [a student guide program], but I think what’s important is that students seek out mentors who understand them. Tim understood what I needed and understood me,” said Bell-Krasner, who is diagnosed with a developmental disability called Non-Verbal Learning Disorder. He graduated in 2008 and works for President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign.
A support group would help many students meet and share their experiences if it worked similarly to the other programs that focus on individualized mentorship, he said.
Nationally, the number of students with learning disabilities seeking college degrees has doubled in the last decade, according to a 2010 report by the Pope Center for Higher Education Policy. The number of GW students with disabilities – both mental and physical – has remained steady in recent years.
About 750 students have opted to receive services from DSS, a figure that has remained at relatively the same level, Willis said.
There are about 40 mobility-impaired students, with three, including DeMarco, requiring a wheelchair. There are about 250 students who report mental and psychological disabilities to GW, Willis said.
In 2011, the most recent data available, there were about 430 students with learning disabilities, such as ADD and ADHD.
Eight of GW’s 14 market basket institutions, or similar schools, include social components in their disability support offices, like New York, Boston, Tulane and Vanderbilt universities.
Thousands of students at Washington University in St. Louis participate in the Cornerstone Center for Advanced Learning, which bridges academic tutoring and social networking through peer mentors, according to the program’s website. The program offers leadership training, personal relationships and cultural programs for students with disabilities as well as for students who come from low-income or first-generation college families.
A time for growth 
Pediatrics professor at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Bill Gaventa, specializes in community inclusion for the disabled, and said both mentally and physically disabled students need to grow and feel accepted during college.
“The key thing for many students with disabilities is building relationships, but it is harder for disabled students to get invited,” Gaventa said. “People see them in terms of their disability and not the shared interest they have.”
He said some students with disabilities would benefit from a campus or student-run social group, while others would not want to single themselves out.
Sophomore Alexa Dectis, diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy, said she has found support in the GW Entertainment Society.
“When I look in the mirror, I don’t see a wheelchair, so I don’t know if [a student organization] would be something I would be active in if it existed,” she said.
She added that adapting to life on campus was largely smooth, and that she is able to go out with friends by requesting wheelchair-accessible cabs and calls clubs and bars beforehand to determine if they are accessible.
Mobility-impaired students cannot get into some of the bars around Foggy Bottom, like those at 19 and M streets, because they are not compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act, first passed in 1990.
Townhouses along F and G streets, which house Greek chapters and departments like anthropology and American studies, are not required to comply with the act because they are historic buildings.
DSS receives about $50,000 a year to update facilities in compliance with the ADA, and Willis said the fund is used to update residential rooms with handicap accessories, but the amount is not typically spent in full.
DeMarco said his nursing aide, Renée Bow, helps him get around campus and takes him out to lunch around Foggy Bottom. She also has helped him plan a trip to the Lady Gaga concert in February.
“He never wants to get out of the room, but I try to get him out,” Bow, a nursing student at Prince George’s Community College, said.
DeMarco said the student organization he plans to launch would help him branch out. “Students going through the same thing as you can be a much bigger support,” DeMarco said.

The smoke detector failed to go off in the Dakota room where a clothes dryer caught fire Sept. 10, causing $340,000 in property damages, an investigation completed this week found.
An “undetermined failure” in the dryer’s heating system ignited the fire that sent one student to GW Hospital for smoke inhalation and prompted more than 50 students to relocate for almost a week, according to the D.C. Fire and EMS report.
Junior Justin Solar, one of the room’s residents who first saw the fire, told fire officials that day that he was in his fifth-floor room when dark smoke started pouring out of the dryer.
“He then closed the bedroom doors and exited the apartment. He stated that the smoke detector did not alert,” according to the report.
The report deemed the fire accidental.
University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard said a system panel in the building showed that all emergency systems, including smoke detectors, fire alarms and sprinklers, were able to activate and function properly.
“Smoke detectors are tested annually, and health and safety inspectors check residential rooms four times a year,” she said. “The incident is still under investigation.”
If a smoke detector is out of order, a property owner is considered in violation of D.C.’s fire code, Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs spokesman Helder Gil said.
He added that the smoke may not have been strong enough to trigger the smoke alarm, which is about 10 to 15 feet away from the room’s dryer.
But one out-of-order smoke alarm “is not an egregious violation,” said Bruce Faust, deputy fire chief and fire marshal at D.C. Fire and EMS. He said if the entire system failed, or if a fire exit was blocked, GW would face an immediate fine.

Fire Incident Report (Text)

Faust said in this case, city inspectors would check out the faulty detector, but he said he did not know whether they had visited The Dakota yet.
“We have 20,000 buildings in this city to inspect and 30 inspectors to do it,” Faust said.
Another resident who was interviewed “stated that the dryer needed to be run several cycles in order to dry clothing,” according to the report.
Damage to the building was “minor,” according to the report, which indicated $10,000 worth of belongings in addition to the property damages. The sprinkler system, which also soaked rooms on lower floors of the building, helped control most of the fire.
When fire officials investigated room 501, “a pile of partially burned clothing was found in [the] kitchen with melted distorted plastic dispersed throughout the pile, and a dryer was located on the floor of the apartment hallway, which had obviously been removed from the laundry closet.”
The fire department responded to the call in under three minutes.

As the number of students seeking mental health services has increased, many students have been forced to wait weeks to receive assistance. But such lengthy waits put students’ well-being at risk, and that is concerning.
Administrators have acknowledged they have hired a new director for the University Counseling Center, and it is clear that the new leader will have a great deal of work to do to increase faith in the center. Mental health should not be taken lightly, and the long waiting period indicates that the University has not made mental health issues a priority.
While the University has demonstrated some level of commitment to students’ mental health by offering six free counseling sessions, the long wait time at the UCC is a tremendous problem for those who seek assistance.
This year, Student Health Service has also seen a 40 percent increase in psychiatric appointments. In just the first month of the semester, 160 students scheduled appointments – which makes it disconcerting that some students reported they waited several weeks before seeing help.
Nationally, mental health issues have increased by about 10 percent over the last decade, according to a 2011 study from the American Psychological Association.
Mental health is as important as physical health. It is just as integral to a positive student experience, as it impacts every facet of an individual’s life. If you are not well, it can affect everything from success in academics to having a healthy social life. The University should not accept sub par mental health services.
If students are experiencing long wait times for appointments, the counseling center should look to hire more staff. As it stands, the counseling center has five staff psychologists, according to its website. A staffing expansion could make services more accessible for students in need. The cost of providing adequate mental health services should not be a concern – even if it means hiring enough counselors to keep up with demand. It is an expense administrators should unflinchingly meet.
At this transitional time for the UCC, it is imperative that the University address student mental health issues proactively. Interim Director Mark Levine told The Hatchet in a Sept. 24 article that long wait times are “certainly not something that has happened often.” But students reported a wait time of three to four weeks and as long as six weeks.
Students should never have to wait days to see a clinician, let alone weeks.
While the University cannot be expected to be perfect in every regard, caring for students should never take the back burner. The success of the University is at stake if students’ emotional well-being is at risk.
GW has an opportunity to become a national model for other university health services. It should be a place where students feel they can not just grow intellectually, but also feel secure emotionally.
Last fall, internal controversy over poor leadership threatened the success and reputation of the counseling center.
A new director offers a chance to start fresh. The key to student success is strong mental health.

When the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences introduced new curriculum requirements last fall, the idea was to ensure that all students would graduate with certain skills, while also giving them more options when selecting courses.
But despite recent additions to the requirements, the list of courses that satisfy the general requirements, called GPAC, still seem limited.
For example, I am planning to take four semesters of French language, yet none of those courses will fulfill the oral communication requirement.
Under the rules, the only language department courses which count toward this requirement are German, Italian and Spanish.
Does this mean students in my French class are not communicating orally?
When the University was mulling over a new general curriculum for the Columbian College, administrators decided that lower-level language courses do not give students the skills they want Colonials to receive.
But even with the courses added this fall, there are many leftover classes that seem like they could easily fulfill certain requirements.
Take for example, Spanish department courses like “Latinos in the U.S.,” “Spanish Language, Culture, and Society” and “General Readings in Spanish Literature.” Each fulfills the global or cross-cultural GPAC requirement, but somehow, the English department course “Latino Literature and Culture,” does not.
Does this mean that, by taking “Latino Literature and Culture,” a student isn’t gaining a global or cross-cultural perspective? Likely not.
Students can demonstrate the same skill sets in many courses that do not fall under the general requirements, and the list of GPAC courses should be expanded.
By only attributing these learning objectives to a narrow list of GPAC courses, the Columbian College inadvertently diminishes the merit of courses that are not included on the list.
Since last semester, the school has added a number of classes to the list. “Public Communication” now counts toward the oral communication requirement. “French Language, Culture, and Society II” now fulfills the global or cross-cultural perspective requirement.
Although many new courses were added to the list, there is still room to grow.
A curriculum should encourage students to take courses that most interest them.

Here’s a fact: 83 percent of Americans think they aren’t getting the facts they need to be educated voters.
In a nation that seems largely devoid of substantive debate, the School of Media and Public Affairs is looking to heighten the level of political discourse with Face the Facts USA, a project that provides one fact daily for 100 days before the Nov. 6 election.
Its website has information on hot button political issues ranging from education and health care to taxes and national security.
But while Face the Facts USA is an admirable attempt to educate and invigorate an increasingly apathetic electorate, facts do not help if there is no context to give them meaning. Facts in isolation might be beneficial for people who want to try out for “Jeopardy!,” but they will not help the average voter on Election Day.
According to Face the Facts USA, which takes information from credible government and research organizations, the tax on cigarettes increased from 39 cents to $1.01 for a 20-cigarette pack from 2009.
So what? Who supports the tax hikes? Who doesn’t? What does this mean as far as raising federal revenue? What are the benefits of taxes on cigarettes? What are the drawbacks?
“I hope this project will make people a little smarter, that they find something that they haven’t known before.” Frank Sesno, SMPA director and chief executive of Face the Facts USA, told me. “So that then when they hear the political debate, or when they hear something that a candidate says, they have information to superimpose on what the candidate says.”
The project starts a conversation – and an important one, at that. But there is still a lot of work to do.
A recent HBO show, written by renowned screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, hits on this same idea.
In an early episode of The Newsroom, character Mackenzie MacHale, who produces a television show, talks about how, when presenting the news, there is one question we must answer: “Is this information we need in the voting booth?”
Another question she poses is, “Is this information in historical context?”
I usually don’t believe everything I see on television, but the show makes a valid point.
Face the Facts USA needs to make sure its information is presented alongside some context, and it also needs to make sure that it can help people make more informed decisions. Otherwise, people are just left with a bunch of ideas swirling around in their brains.
To be fair, at the bottom of each fact’s page, there’s a section labeled “What do others say?” that links users to other websites and articles about the various issues Face the Facts USA covers. They also have a “Where do the candidates stand?” box that links to the presidential candidates’ campaign platforms. But those are by no means central focuses of the website.
Having an arsenal of facts is better than not knowing anything at all – as is the case with too many voters today.
But the initiative could include a history about the trajectory of the issues covered, or a fact-checking mechanism through which dubious statements made by the candidates could be screened, helping voters figure out which presidential hopeful most accurately aligns with their views.
“We are so filled with assertion and accusation and allegation and distorted facts,” Sesno told me, “that the public is justifiably angry.”
I share his frustrations. It is discouraging that the news is devoid of real substance. Face the Facts USA is a great start, but in a political race as important as this one, it falls short of the finish line.

Delays in getting help can cost lives and create liability
As the public interest attorney who first outlined legal theories under which victims of the “Dark Knight” shooting could sue Colorado University for failing to appreciate and appropriately treat student James Holmes, and as one who has studied other situations where universities were sued when students with psychological problems hurt themselves or others, it is concerning that GW students who experience emotional or psychological problems may have to wait up to six weeks for appointments.
My concern is not only for the students, but also about potential legal liability for GW if it is put on notice of a problem by the student’s call, and then unnecessarily delays providing appropriate assistance. What is even more shocking is that the delays probably could be slashed by applying common sense.
 “The office has seen 160 appointments so far this year… But Levine said about 60 of this year’s appointments have been ‘no shows,’ despite phone confirmations – creating delays that keep other students from getting into the office faster,” The Hatchet reported Sept. 24. But there are simple techniques, used by others, to limit “no shows.”
The UCC could require a student to come to the office 60 minutes prior to the time of his or her actual appointment. Those 60 minutes could be used to fill out paperwork and to read over any educational documents. If the student fails to arrive 60 minutes before the appointment, the office could call other students on a wait list. Since many students live on or near campus, a one-hour alert could provide an opportunity to use that time slot. This technique is used by many hospitals, which often require arrival two hours before a scheduled operation.
These simple suggestions obviously just begin to address the problem, and additional actions probably should be taken by GW – not only for the sake of students who are wisely trying to take the first step in obtaining the help they need – but also to reduce the University’s potential legal liability should a mentally unstable student go on to hurt himself or others.

One of GW’s fiercest admissions rivals opened a D.C. study away program Monday, opening its new academic and residence hall complex just 14 blocks from Foggy Bottom.
New York University’s newest off-site program, at 1307 L St., NW,  gives students the chance to spend up to three semesters in the nation’s capital before they return to the bustle of America’s largest city.
The newly constructed building includes classrooms, dorm rooms, offices and a 140-seat auditorium. The program includes about 25 students this semester, but NYU spokesman John Beckman said the school’s enrollment could surpass 120 students per semester in the next few years.
Like a study abroad program, NYU students who live and take classes in D.C. will pay the same price as they do on its main campus.
Out of GW’s 14 market basket schools, or similar institutions, 11 have programs that allow students to spend a semester in D.C. But NYU is the first to build a home within the Beltway.
To make use of the D.C. location, Beckman said the campus will focus on government and journalism – some of GW’s strong suits academically – in addition to art.
Frank Sesno, director of the School of Media and Public Affairs, said NYU’s decision to move to D.C. “merely underscores” the fact that GW’s location gives students an advantage.
“Our students keep getting better by nearly every measure. So while it’s good to have additional competition, we’re very confident that we are now and will remain the go-to place for the study of media and public affairs in Washington and beyond,” Sesno said.
John Sides, associate professor of political science, said he thinks students who want to be in D.C. will still choose GW, because the University gives them the chance to live in the area for four years, rather than just the length of an internship.
In 2011, the most recent National Research Council ranking, GW’s political science program came in as No. 24 compared to NYU’s No. 5 ranking.
Kathryn Napper, associate vice president and dean of admissions, said the new campus would not be competition for the University, even though many students who apply to GW also apply to NYU.
“We have the ‘pure thing,’ ” she said. “We are a four-year experience. We have better resources to take better advantage of, as opposed to one building in the middle of Washington D.C. that is a one-semester or two-semester thing.”
Napper said she is always conscious of competition among colleges, but she said the University has retained its popularity despite other schools’ programs cropping up in the District.
NYU has built up its international reputation, with study away programs on six continents, Beckman said.
The school also has a full-fledged campus in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and it is building one in Shanghai.
GW has also been building up its international scope – recently acquiring campus space in Suzhou, China and working on a four-year degree program that spans D.C., China and France.The construction for NYU’s study away building was funded by a $10 million donation by an NYU alumnus and owner of a real estate company.
