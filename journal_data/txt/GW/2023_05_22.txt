Officials have chosen Revolutionaries to be GW’s next moniker, but don’t hoist your banner or form a barricade just yet. In the truest meaning of “revolution,” the University’s moniker process has gone full circle — after years of discussion and debate, we’re back where we started.
If officials took anything away from the now-defunct Colonials moniker, it should have been that words have meanings. Monikers are meant to uplift and unite, not denigrate and divide. Colonials, which encapsulated a painful and ongoing history of violence and exploitation, failed as a moniker because it did the latter.
After feedback forms, focus groups and four finalists, we’ve finally and rightfully replaced Colonials. But how exactly is Revolutionaries any less of a loaded term than Colonials? If anything, it just seems like a more palatable iteration of the same idea — a “precious heritage” tied to the University’s namesake and the newly independent United States.
We can’t honestly claim that heritage, real or imagined, as our own. GW only became “The George Washington University” in 1904 and didn’t embrace the Colonials moniker until 1924. So celebrate the University’s storied history all you like, but we’re not inextricably linked to the founding of the country. George Washington crossed the Delaware, we cross 23rd Street — that’s not exactly upholding the principles of the Founding Fathers.
And while officials surely meant Revolutionaries to conjure up images of the American Revolution, it can just as easily apply to other movements for both good and for ill. Slave revolts, guillotines, independence struggles, political purges, even campus protests — the course of history has muddled the new moniker’s meaning. And the overtures to history aside, there’s something deeply ironic about an institution so thoroughly enmeshed in the establishment opting for such a radical-sounding name.
So, who was Revolutionaries for? Out of the 10 initial and later final four moniker options, Revolutionaries was and remains the most conservative and cautious choice — the opposite of what you’d think such a name would imply.
I’d hoped we might do something different regarding our new moniker — we’d challenge the idea that GW is a stuffy, self-serious institution obsessed with its own past. Instead, we’ve doubled down on some mythologized version of history and returned a similar, albeit less offensive, moniker.
A moniker is ultimately a branding gimmick. But as long as we’re going to try to make it into something more — a representation of who we are and who we strive to be — we ought to get it right.

Mayor Muriel Bowser named executive assistant chief of the Metropolitan Police Department Ashan M. Benedict as interim chief Friday.
Benedict will start his position as acting chief Wednesday, the Washington Post reported, replacing outgoing chief Robert J. Contee III as he retires to pursue a position at the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Benedict said in a press conference Friday he will not apply for the permanent position as a “personal decision,” meaning Bowser will still search for a replacement.

What’s for breakfast? How about lunch or dinner — or just a snack? GW’s dining options in District House, Shenkman and Thurston halls have made it easier for students to answer these questions, but they haven’t completely sated their appetite for diverse, high-quality dining options on campus.
Make no mistake — these dining halls have shaken up the culinary scene at GW. The new all-you-can-eat and swipe-based venues in Shenkman and Thurston halls plus the counter service options in District House have relieved some of the burden students face when they’re looking for something to eat, especially on a campus that’s long been dogged with concerns over food security.
But having a reliable and accessible source of food on campus only meets the bar. Simple measures like labeling the dishes the dining halls are serving and communicating dining options will elevate students’ experience — and help them meet their nutritional needs — as the University fully transitions to its new dining plan in the fall.
Students searched for GWorld vendors on and off campus until the dining areas in District House and Thurston and Shenkman halls opened in August, October and January, respectively. And while it gave students a degree of financial and adult-like independence to pick and choose from dozens of GWorld vendors across D.C., this model didn’t work for everyone — just ask the friend on the legacy dining plan who ran out of dining dollars last month.
Ultimately, GW’s unorthodox and open approach to dining hasn’t ensured students can always eat what they want when they want it, with the cost of food leading them to skip meals, lose weight and struggle with food insecurity. Rising prices have made it more difficult to find affordable dining options on or near campus in recent years, especially with Whole Foods exiting the GWorld program next month.
Under the new meal plans, students can still use their dining dollars over the course of the semester at campus favorites like GW Deli and swipe in at Thurston or Shenkman halls or Pelham Commons on the Mount Vernon Campus. Students who aren’t on the unlimited plans can still run out of meal swipes or exhaust their Dining Dollars early in the semester, but GW’s dining halls are like a safety net — they’ll always be there even if they don’t always serve something that strikes you as appetizing.
To be truly successful, the dining halls need to offer food items that students want to — and can — eat. Diners with dietary needs arising from personal preferences, allergies or religious beliefs can often find few or repetitive options that comply with their restrictions. And for vegetarian, vegan, gluten free and other students with dietary restrictions, a lack of labels can make it difficult if not impossible to know the ingredients in what they’re eating.
“Mystery meat” is one thing, but no student should have to guess what they’re consuming and risk having an allergic reaction. Fortunately, this is an easy problem to solve — work more diverse options into the menu, communicate what’s on offer and clearly label what’s at each of the stations in GW’s dining halls, especially as options run out or staff replace certain dishes.
Though foot traffic may have fallen off as this semester comes to a close, it’s clear that the dining halls aren’t just a place to eat — they’re community spaces. Officials have laid the groundwork to make students’ dining experience a distinct part of their time at the University. Dining halls are a decidedly orthodox move for an institution keen on marketing its one-of-a-kind nature, but they’ve given students places to gather, relax and eat — and where else can you get a waffle emblazoned with “GW”?
Granted, these dining halls are brand new and there are bound to be some issues that arise along the way. But because the primary purpose of these venues is to serve students food, it’s hard to give officials too much credit on that front when there’s a lack of options and limited labeling. There’s work remaining to improve students’ experience, even if it’s fairly simple — students must be able to trust they can rely on the University’s dining halls when GW fully transitions to its swipe-based meal plans this fall.
For now, Shenkman and Thurston halls have transformed students’ on-campus dining options, but there’s a long way to go before they can serve every student’s needs. We raise high at GW, and our new dining halls still need a boost to meet our expectations.

Noor Jehan Ansari is a junior majoring in American studies and a former president of the GW Muslim Students’ Association.
In the weeks leading up to Ramadan both this year and last year, the executives of the Muslim Students’ Association organized Ramadan programming for GW’s hundreds of Muslim students — all without the help of the University.
While religious life offices at universities across the country guide their respective schools on how to best accommodate their Muslim students during Ramadan, the MSA is the only liaison between the University and its Muslim students. We communicate what our needs are during Ramadan to GW every year, organize all of our religious observances and must explain to officials who do not know about Islam and Ramadan what our religious practices are and why we need accommodations for them. No student should have to carry those burdens alone.
Students who observe Ramadan, which lasted from March 22 to April 20 this year, do not eat food or drink water during daylight hours. We get up before sunrise to eat our suhoor — the meal before sunrise — and pray our morning fajr prayer. After the sun sets, we break our fast and share iftar — food for the breaking of the fast — after observing the evening maghrib prayer. Muslims around the world also spend much of the night at the mosque praying nightly tarawih prayers together.
A week before Ramadan began this year, the two current co-presidents of the MSA and I met with GW Dining officials over Zoom. We wanted officials to create a system for Muslim students to get iftar and suhoor in GW’s dining halls.
We ran into several problems. Officials we expected to lead the meeting were not there, while those who attended needed us to explain what our traditions were. When the three of us suggested having suhoor to-go boxes, dining officials instead kept replying with the term “breakfast boxes” — language was getting lost in translation. We left the meeting totally unsure of what GW Dining’s plan to provide meals for fasting students was and with the understanding that we would be responsible for what’s essentially a full-time job.
We received messages from Muslim students during Ramadan this year asking us about GW’s Ramadan accommodations, but we couldn’t answer because we were just as confused as they were. Students told us there weren’t any suhoor boxes left for them on some nights — officials did not anticipate the number of people that would need them.
The MSA provides twice-a-week iftar meals for students who are fasting during Ramadan. We organize tarawih prayers, book rooms and find imams to lead the service. And we put on Eid-ul-Fitr celebrations at the end of the month. We also ask academic departments to allow extensions and accommodations for students who have exams scheduled during Ramadan and Eid.
We expect more than 100 students to attend these events, which take about 25 hours a week to plan, let alone the time to facilitate and clean up after each event. On top of school work and other responsibilities, that means leaders of the MSA can’t always observe the very spiritual practices we help plan.
This lack of support is not just an issue during Ramadan. The MSA has also struggled to put on our weekly jummah, or congregational prayers, on Fridays. There is no space available for one hour on Friday afternoons that can fit the 100 members that usually attend — a number that only increases during Ramadan. Various University departments have met our attempts to find space with roadblocks over capacity constraints, conflicting reservations, radio silence or blatant refusals to help.
The Multicultural Student Services Center does not have its own staff position dedicated to religious life, which is why GW lags behind many other universities when it comes to accommodations for students during Ramadan. The University of Southern California, the University of Maryland, Emerson College, and Northeastern and Loyola universities offered to-go boxes for fasting students in 2022, the first year that the entire month of Ramadan fell during the academic year.
All of these universities have an office of religious life — full-time or part-time staff members dedicated to creating spiritual programming and being a services hub for religious students and the university. Omer Mozaffar, Loyola University’s Muslim chaplain, consulted on dining accommodations for Ramadan and received dates from university officials to gift to fasting students last year. At USC, a dietitian told NPR they knew they had to do something to help Muslim students who were fasting during Ramadan in 2022 — they took the initiative rather than acting like these accommodations were an inconvenience.
Without one of these offices at GW, it is up to student organizations to acquire funding to pay a salary for their own chaplains to teach the University about their religious traditions and needs. Unlike GW Hillel and the GW Newman Center, the MSA cannot draw on support from external organizations and does not have enough funds to pay for a spiritual leader of its own.
The University’s lack of awareness about its own student population and their religious practices shows how few Muslims are involved in the planning process of its dining program and other services, and the lack of a spiritual life office is hindering GW’s ability to accurately attend to its students’ needs. But, we’ve heard in other meetings the MSSC is taking steps to hire a director of religious life.
We need someone who can sit in on meetings with GW Dining, ensure students receive exam extensions and other classroom accommodations, help organize congregational prayers and most of all is knowledgeable about Islam and religious student life. If GW’s religious life director can’t meet those needs if or when the position is created, then they must help student organizations like the MSA acquire funding for their own chaplains to carry out those responsibilities.
GW shouldn’t expect undergraduates to be consultants for the University on religious accommodations — we should be able to focus on our own spiritual fulfillment during our most cherished time of the year.

More than 20 students said they plan to continue grocery shopping next year despite the Whole Foods GWorld phase out, opting to use their own money at stores like Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s.
Students said there is a lack of adequate dining and grocery options on campus as they prepare for Whole Foods to stop accepting GWorld as a form of payment next month.
A Whole Foods Market spokesperson said in an email last week that May 31 is the last day the Foggy Bottom Whole Foods will accept GWorld payments. Whole Foods’ phasing out of GWorld comes after the grocery store giant announced last April that all stores would end partnerships with university dining plans around the country and after the University switched to a swipe-based dining system in January, phasing out the declining GWorld balance system students could use to purchase groceries and dine at restaurants.
The Foggy Bottom Whole Foods opened in September 2011 and began accepting GWorld the same month. A Whole Foods spokesperson declined to comment on what other university dining plans it was phasing out and how the chains anticipate the end of their participation in university dining plans will affect their business.
University spokesperson Julia Metjian said the University will add a grocery-style market to District House this summer to ensure grocery items will still be available on the “dining program.” She declined to comment on whether officials would change the weekly shuttle to Safeway on 1855 Wisconsin Ave. NW in Georgetown — the only other major grocery store that accepts GWorld, roughly 20 minutes from campus by bus — which officials launched in December.
“We are consistently working with potential partners to offer more grocery options for students,” Metjian said.
More than 20 students said they plan to continue grocery shopping next year despite the Whole Foods GWorld phase out, opting to use their own money at stores like Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s. Some students said the University should work to partner with another grocery store closer to campus like Trader Joe’s, noting the need to travel to Safeway by bus or shuttle.
The West End Trader Joe’s has not accepted GWorld since its opening in 2006, even after the University contacted them about partnering that year. Trader Joe’s did not return a request for comment last week regarding whether they have considered partnering with GWorld.
Safeway did not return a request last week for comment on whether it plans on making any changes to its GWorld system or whether it anticipates any changes in its business after Whole Foods stops accepting GWorld. The Safeway on MacArthur Boulevard, a 10 minute walk from the Mount Vernon campus, accepted GWorld but closed in 2019.
Emma Walther, a sophomore majoring in international affairs, said it is “disappointing” that Whole Foods will go off GWorld because Whole Foods is the “biggest way” many students buy groceries and essential for those who wish to make food that reminds them of home and their culture.
“Being able to cook your own food is something that a lot of college students value, as we’re so far away from home,” Walther said. “I know, personally, I’m from across the country, so being able to cook food that I grew up eating or that I’m used to cooking is something that I will miss with Whole Foods leaving GWorld.”
Charlie Kaltenbach, a sophomore studying cognitive science and language, said Whole Foods going off GWorld is “frustrating” because it renders the kitchens in residence halls “mostly useless.” She said she plans to continue purchasing basics from Whole Foods because taking the bus to Safeway is inconvenient.
“I think the dorms are very expensive in part because of the kitchens and not being able to stock them with anything is frustrating,” she said.
The University opened all-you-can-eat dining halls in Thurston and Shenkman halls in the fall and spring, respectively, requiring freshmen to purchase swipe-based plans to use at the new dining halls in the spring semester. The University will require all on-campus students purchase meal plans for next semester, ranging from 90 swipes and $890 in DC Dining Dollars to unlimited meal swipes and $200 of DC Dining Dollars funds for groceries or meals at partnering restaurants.
Cecily Phua, a sophomore studying biology and music, said the dining halls may serve as an adequate substitute for grocery shopping at Whole Foods once it goes off GWorld for students who formerly struggled to budget their GWorld because the dining halls provide a consistent dining option for students. But she said she cannot use her remaining GWorld balance to pay for groceries, which she has prepared and cooked in her dorm previously, next year with Whole Foods going off GWorld.
“I’m also paying for a dorm with a kitchen, just to be de-incentivized to use the kitchen,” she said.
Clare Trainor, a freshman studying chemistry, said she would prefer the University put the West End Trader Joe’s on GWorld over Whole Foods remaining on GWorld because Trader Joe’s is a cheaper option than Whole Foods. She said she likes to grocery shop and cook her own meals on her own schedule as opposed to going to dining halls at set times.
She said the next nearest option for groceries on GWorld is CVS, which has fewer items.
“I like cooking my own food because I like knowing what I put in it, and I like knowing the ingredients to make it to how I like my taste,” she said. “And I can’t do that at the dining hall.”

GW Law currently offers a total of 17 clinics housed within the Jacob Burns Community Legal Clinics, with topics including immigration, health rights and domestic violence, and will add five additions next fall. 
GW Law’s Jacob Burns Community Legal Clinics will offer five new clinics in the fall semester, which faculty say will help meet the large student demand for professional experiences they need to succeed after graduation.
Officials will offer one health equity policy and advocacy clinic and four civil access to justice clinics in education-access advocacy, nonprofit and entrepreneurship, prison civil rights and workers’ rights divisions for the first time this fall, according to a GW Law release last month. Laurie S. Kohn, the associate dean for clinical affairs for the Jacob Burns Foundation and the director of the family justice litigation clinic, said the new clinics demonstrate the law school’s commitment to expanding student access to “legal skills and training” through clinical experience.
Kohn said the new clinics will expand upon the policy topics covered in curriculum and give more students access to a “D.C.-infused education” by looking at where students can help members of marginalized communities and practice legal assistance, a goal that aligns with a pillar of GW Law’s strategic plan — strengthening academic programs and offerings — that outlines strategies for advancing clinics at the law school through 2025. Kohn said determining where the community can benefit from free legal assistance is a “critical motivation” in selecting the subject matter of each new clinic.
“When considering expansion, we work closely with our community partners, the local court systems and our community itself to determine where services are needed most,” Kohn said.
Kohn said 130 students are enrolled in clinics for fall 2023 while 256 students applied. The GW Law website states that the law school currently offers a total of 17 clinics in topics including immigration, health rights and domestic violence, with five additions coming this fall. Second- and third-year law students participate in the clinics for 4 to 6 credits but are not paid, according to the website.
“Our hope is that ultimately every student who wishes to take a clinic will have a seat,” Kohn said in an email. “We consistently seek to grow opportunities for our students to achieve the best possible academic experience and part of that is immersing them in real-world curriculum.”
Kohn said the clinics help GW Law meet the American Bar Association’s requirement of offering “experiential learning opportunities” to students as mandated by the American Bar Association. She said clinical learning gives students the opportunity to connect with professors and gain hands-on legal experience before graduating, which is why officials set the 8-to-1 student-to-faculty ratio.
“Students develop deep substantive relationships with their faculty who, in turn, get to know their work so that they can act as mentors and advocates for students entering the job market,” Kohn said. “Students develop their professional identities through their practice of law and interactions with clients, opposing counsels, judges and lawmakers.”
David Johnson, the director of the Civil Access to Justice Clinic — Education Access Advocacy Division and assistant dean for pro bono and advocacy programs, said his new clinic is the only one offered by the law school that focuses on litigation in education and gives students experience with the speed and severity of real-world litigation. Johnson said his students will represent D.C. Public School students who are facing suspension trials at the D.C. Office of Administrative Hearings.
“If you are a student in DCPS and you are suspended, you are entitled to a hearing in a matter of days,” Johnson said. “So this seems to me, we’ll see if it works next semester, the perfect sort of bite-sized litigation for a student, you only got a few days to get ready.”
Johnson said the clinics provide an opportunity for law students to learn oral and written advocacy skills necessary to represent clients when they graduate. Johnson said all of the law clinics are centered around giving students the opportunity to apply what they are learning to the type of work they will be expected to do as a professional in their field.
“Lawyers are not paid to take tests,” Johnson said. “Lawyers are paid to represent people and representing people only occurs in two ways, through oral advocacy, written advocacy, even if it’s not confrontational, and then we have a small business clinic here.”
Renée Gentry, a professorial lecturer in law who directs a preexisting vaccine injury litigation clinic, which is offered each year over two semesters, said she would like to see GW offer more clinics in the coming years because there is still a higher level of student interest than spots available.
“We just talked about it in a faculty meeting, I think last month, that we still have a big group of students that don’t get clinics because there’s just not enough spaces,” Gentry said. “So absolutely, I think any law student that wants to take a clinic should be able to take a clinic.”
Gentry said GW Law’s clinical program sets students up to succeed in the professional world because they require industry experience that employers look for in the hiring process.
“Most times when you graduate from law school, a lot of what you find is a lot of the entry level positions already want two years of experience and that’s really hard to do when you’re in law school,” Gentry said. “So a clinical setting gives you that ability to do that.”
Gentry said these clinics are designed to give students exposure to the value of public interest law while gaining general professional experience and helping the larger community.
“A lot of times the clinics are pro bono or they help people that are in underserved communities, people that are sort of vulnerable in society,” Gentry said. “It’s a great thing to sort of teach students and get them grounded in public interest and pro bono work.”

Faculty within the initiative, housed within the Elliott School of International Affairs, said the donation will help grow students' awareness of Uyghur history, arts and language.
Updated: Friday, May 26, 2023, at 5:07 p.m.
The Elliott School of International Affairs received a donation to grow the school’s Uyghur Studies Initiative starting next fall, which faculty say will promote the study of Uyghur culture outside of the political context of the abuses the group faces in China.
The $900,000 anonymous donation will allow the initiative to add courses on Uyghur culture and identity and expand faculty and graduate-level research in the area of Uyghur studies to bolster the Uyghur Studies Initiative in the Sigur Center for Asian Studies, according to a University release earlier this month. Faculty within the initiative said the donation will help grow students’ awareness of Uyghur history, arts and language at a time when the group’s culture is under threat of being destroyed by genocide, while national attention focuses on the human rights abuses that Uyghur people face at the hands of the Chinese government.
The Uyghur people are a mostly Muslim Turkic ethnic group in the Xinjiang region in northwestern China who speak a Turkic language and use the Arabic alphabet, with cultural traditions that include “vibrant” music and dances like the musical genre Muqam and reading and creating literature like poetry, dictionaries and encyclopedias, according to the Tarim Network and the World Uyghur Congress. The people are historically known for their role as “connectors” between Eastern and Western civilizations along the Silk Road.
University spokesperson Julia Metjian said while the endowment is “not nearly” large enough for officials to hire permanent faculty for the initiative, it allows for the addition of an adjunct language professor to teach Uyghur language classes. She said officials are “hoping” to offer three levels of Uyghur language classes — beginning through advanced — within the next three years.
Metjian also said the endowment is “strictly earmarked” for nonpolitical purposes and will support graduate-level research in the Uyghur humanities. She said in the past three years, undergraduate courses focusing on the Uyghur region have filled and professors have noticed an increasing number of students “very familiar” with the issues facing the Uyghur community in Xinjiang.
Governments and human rights organizations accused the Chinese government of committing genocide against the Uyghur people in 2021 after reports that the government targeted and imprisoned religious leaders, forcibly sterilized Uyghur women and detained some in “reeducation camps.”
Eric Schluessel, an assistant professor of history and international affairs pursuing research on Uyghur economic history, said the anonymous benefactor donated to the Uyghur Studies Initiative because they felt “confident” that the University’s history programs exploring Chinese and Central Asian culture would use the money to promote Uyghur cultural studies, which he said is not a “strong” focus in humanities studies, rather than political research.
“The donor specified this as well that the endowment is not here for political purposes, the endowment is specifically here to open spaces to talk about the arts, the humanities, things like history, literature,” Schluessel said.
Schluessel said the donation will fund a Beginning Uyghur Language class next fall and the University plans to expand Uyghur language classes “year by year.” He said seven students enrolled in the class so far and that Mustafa Aksu, a graduate of the Department of Central Eurasia Studies at Indiana University, Bloomington with a background in linguistics and language pedagogy, will teach the class for the first time at GW next year.
He said he found in his research that many Uyghur people hope to see people disseminate more information about the group’s creative and scholarly pursuits to support and bring awareness to the group’s culture outside of their persecution by the Chinese government.
“When I speak to members of the Uyghur diaspora, especially the young people under 30, the constant refrain is that there seems to be so much money and energy for politics and activism, but in some ways, what is really needed is a space to nurture the community, in the diaspora in exile,” Schluessel said.
Bruce Dickson, a professor of political science and international affairs who focuses on political dynamics in China, said the donation will also allow the initiative to begin offering fellowships for doctoral and masters students “presumably” for Uyghur studies and fund different public events.
He said students who deepen their understanding of Uyghur history, culture and language, as well as the political impact and significance of Uyghur culture, gain a better notion of international affairs. He said the chances of students being able to go to Xinjiang to “take advantage” of their studies in the field depends on when the Chinese government opens up those opportunities, and that they’re currently “close to zero.”
“At a time when issues in Xinjiang are more and more in the news, this program will help bring more attention, more understanding to the issue,” Dickson said.
Gregg Brazinsky, the director of the Sigur Center for Asian Studies and a professor of history and international affairs, said the Sigur Center for Asian Studies is also receiving funding through the National Resource Center, a program that provides grants to language and international studies centers, starting next year to focus on a broader initiative on Xinjiang, Tibet and Taiwan. He said the U.S. Department of Education selected GW to be a member of the East Asia National Resource Center Program and that the funding will help grow Uyghur studies classes.
He said officials plan to fund new Uyghur classes next year through the initiative and with “additional” funding from the NRC, but did not specify how much money the NRC will provide for the courses.
“We should be able to offer some robust classes and public facing programming related to Xinjiang and Uyghur, as this is also part of a broader initiative that’s being carried out by the Sigur Center for Asian Studies,” Brazinsky said.
Hannah Ellis, the president of the Uyghur Human Rights Initiative at GW Law, said the Uyghur Studies Initiative itself is a “great avenue” to provide Uyghur people with a space and opportunity to present Uyghur history and preserve their culture. Ellis said the Uyghur Human Rights Initiative plans on “interacting” with the Uyghur Studies Initiative and will start engaging in “more dialogue” with the initiative in the fall.
“There’s so much value that we gain from having diverse, unique perspectives spoken about and sometimes that can be in a very positive light in just terms of the history of Uyghur people and preserving their cultural practices,” Ellis said.

The Hatchet updated this post to reflect that Mustafa Aksu is a graduate of the Department of Central Eurasia Studies at Indiana University, Bloomington. The Hatchet incorrectly reported that the Uyghur Studies Initiative is receiving funding from the NRC. The NRC will fund future Uyghur classes alongside the initiative. We regret this error. The Hatchet also updated this article to clarify that Brazinsky did not decline to say how much funding the NRC provides to the initiative because the initiative does not receive funding directly from the NRC. Brazinsky instead did not specify how much NRC funding will go toward new Uyghur classes.
