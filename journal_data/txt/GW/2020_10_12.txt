Dupont Underground is bouncing back with a new photography exhibit depicting D.C. protests against racial inequality.
After facing possible closure last November, Dupont Underground is bouncing back with a new photography exhibit depicting protests throughout D.C. against racial inequality.
The exhibition “rise up.” will feature an on-site show and an interactive virtual gallery displaying photos of the Black Lives Matter movement. The exhibit aims to create a space for photographers of all backgrounds and “offers a glimpse into American history-in-the-making,” according to Dupont Underground.
Shedrick Pelt, who curated the exhibit along with Nora van Trotsenburg, Dupont Underground’s director of operations, photographed some of the protests that took place in the District earlier this year. He told DCist he was “amazed” by the role D.C. had in the movement.
“Being a part of that process, I realized how important D.C. was to the movement,” he told DCist. “We are holding a very important part of the conversation. When you turn on the nightly news, you see Seattle, you see Portland, you see New York, and you see D.C.”
The on-site exhibition will be open from Oct. 2 to Nov. 1 on Fridays from 3 to 7 p.m. and on the weekends from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., and the virtual exhibition is available online from Oct. 2 to Jan. 12, 2021. The tickets are free, and a donation is suggested.
Dupont Underground CEO Robert Meins said last November that the community arts organization negotiated an extension to their lease, which was set to expire in April, but that District officials told him the lease would not be renewed. Since then, Meins reported he is still in “active discussion” with the deputy mayor’s office and signed a term sheet outlining the details of a potential lease extension.
“We’ve been just talking back and forth about getting into the nitty gritty of what each of those terms would look like for a lease extension,” he told DCist. “It’s not settled yet, but it’s headed in the right direction.”
Dupont Underground garnered support from local politicians D.C. Councilman Phil Mendelson and then-Ward 2 Councilmember Jack Evans, who both asked the deputy mayor’s office to sign a 10-year lease with Dupont Underground. Officials told DCist they are committed to “keeping this unique space activated” in D.C.’s “creative economy.”
Since the nonprofit organization first received their lease in 2014, Dupont Underground has transformed abandoned space below Dupont Circle into a multidisciplinary arts venue for “creative exchange.” Dupont Underground has hosted a list of artists and events including  an audio installation artist Eric Dickson and Afro-folk band VeVe & the Rebels.

When COVID-19 decisively changed everyone’s plans for the summer, students invariably had to make new ones. Some students took virtual internships, while others took road trips. I took a job at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama, where I packed single items into boxes about 1,000 times a day.
College students, especially GW students, often view Amazon warehouses as Rube Goldberg machines of human suffering. Yet this was not my experience. I worked reasonable hours at reasonable pay: 10 hours a day, four days a week at $15 an hour, in a state where the median wage is $16.73. The temperature inside the warehouse rarely exceeded the mid-70s even when the temperature outside reached 100, and I got to read books while I worked. And a few other aspects of the job didn’t align with the exposés and news reports with dramatic headlines.
Contrary to some stories, our bathroom breaks were not monitored. We were also encouraged to stay hydrated, and management handed out water bottles to this end. I was never reprimanded, warned or even looked at for going to the bathroom or getting water. On the contrary, I was generally encouraged to do so as needed.
Also contrary to some news reports, there were no algorithms that fired people for efficiency or pushed people to injury. My trainer told me on my first day to not worry about the rate I packed boxes. He explained that I had plenty of time to get adjusted to the job, and if management took issue with my rate, they would send packing coaches and send many more warnings before they even gave me a documented write up, and that I probably wasn’t going to get a notification in the first place. He was correct. In my two months there I was never reprimanded for my rate, and I never heard of anyone else being fired for failing to meet a quota. For the most part, if you showed up to work on time you weren’t getting fired. Even when I began to saunter into work with 50 pages of reading material, no one really cared. There were auditors that went around and made sure you were doing everything correctly, safely and made sure you weren’t being super slow, but these were designed to be more helpful than disciplinary.
I also began work late May, just when Amazon rolled back the $17.5/hour and double overtime that started during the pandemic. By then they had figured out a decent policy for navigating COVID-19. Workers were required to wear masks, our temperature was scanned when we entered the building, workstations were socially distanced and regularly disinfected and workers were encouraged to stay home if they felt seek and generally given financial incentive and the time off to do so. This strategy seemed to work for at least my first month and a half there, particularly for a state that was a coronavirus hotspot at that time. Amazon notifies workers when someone who works at the plant contracts COVID-19. I received none of those notifications until about my last three weeks. By the time I left, I had received around nine notifications that people had contracted the virus, although those cases seemed to be getting more frequent when I left. Amazon sends an additional notification to people who were in close contact with people who tested positive, but I received none of those notifications.
I should emphasize one particular part of the job: I never felt Amazon the corporation cared about me or recognized my humanity. Then again, I never thought it was supposed to. It was supposed to pay me, train me to be safe, approve time off and overtime when I requested it and otherwise leave me alone to read and pack boxes. In exchange, I packed boxes in a quality and speed in accordance to their general demand. This was all the recognition as a human being that I needed from Amazon the corporation. The recognition of one’s humanity that almost everyone needs in some form in a job did not come from the corporation, nor should it. It came from fellow employees who treated me and others with politeness and kindness and managers who treated me with respect and tried to learn my name. Contrary to the advertising, I did not feel like family, or, for that matter, an “associate” – a vaguely Orwellian term Amazon uses in place of “employee.” I felt like an employee, a human one, who interacted with other human employees. Although it probably works in their favor, Amazon didn’t design this environment, it just sort of happened as a result of individuals being kind to each other and recognizing their shared humanity.
At any rate, my time working at Amazon was a generally positive experience. I got paid well, worked in a safe and relatively comfortable environment and gathered a deeper understanding for how Amazon delivers its packages. It was not particularly enjoyable work, but it would be the epitome of privilege to say I was suffering or to make the laughable comparison to resistance fighters. My experiences overall starkly contrasted with most of the news stories and exposés would have you believe – probably due to a combination of exaggerated articles and the progress that Amazon has made in improving conditions of its workers.

Kim said North Korea has comedy films despite its depiction as threatening and having “crazy leadership.”
The Institute for Korean Studies hosted a webinar on humor in North Korean comedy films and its influence on the country’s society on Friday.
Immanuel Kim, an associate professor of Korean literature and culture studies, discussed the cultural effects of comedy films in North Korea addressed in his book, “Laughing North Koreans: The Culture of Comedy Films.” He said North Korea is not seen as a state capable of laughter because the standard perspective is that citizens are “brainwashed” and must “cower” before their government.
Kim said North Korea has comedy films despite its depiction as threatening and having “crazy leadership.”
“When the state began in 1948, we see a long history of not only comedy films but funny stories, jokes and different TV shows that are sit-com style,” Kim said.
He said he wanted to show how North Korea also has a “good sense of humor” through this book. He said while North Korean humor can differ from Western humor, not all North Koreans enjoy the same humor as is true in the United States.
“It’s a matter of taste, and it’s really hard to pinpoint what is funny or what North Koreans find funny,” Kim said.
He said whether North Koreans find comedy films funny or not is “irrelevant” because the films still have a “huge cultural impact” on society.
“It’s not that they run into these movie theaters to get a dose of the political ideology for that week,” Kim said. “No, they go into these movie theaters to watch their favorite actors, actresses and comedians because they recognize these comedians and know that they will be entertained for the next hour.”
He said romantic comedy directors need to keep the “star persona” in mind when producing appealing films so he said male stars require certain features that may not typically line up with Western standards.
“For men, you just need the voice so you don’t have to be fit, you don’t have to have muscles bulging out or the chiseled ‘BTS kind of look’ because that’s not what North Koreans are exactly after,” he said.
Kim said celebrities like Kim Se-yong and Ri Yong-ho have contributed to the cultural effect of comedy.
“I realized there’s a thread across all my chapters and all of the comedy films that I like, and that thread is Kim Se-yong,” he said.
Kim said he is not disregarding the political ideology in these films in his book but focuses on an unexplored aspect of North Korean culture.
“The people recognize these actors as individuals and not just bolts in an ideological machine so to me that’s really fascinating,” he said.
Kim said comedy can act as social criticisms of society, which filmmakers carry out as long as they omit any mention of the leader or the party.
“There’s so much that filmmakers can make fun of that’s waiting like a time bomb to explode,” Kim said. “But, I think we have to give North Korea more time for them to ease and go into making fun of more things.”

Here we are again.
Administrators finally revealed their long-awaited plans for the spring semester – we’re taking most classes online again. And in-person commencement events are canceled. Students and faculty are justifiably disappointed, and some have even signed a petition asking officials to reconsider their decision to halt in-person graduation. But deep down, we all know GW will not and should not reverse course. Extending remote learning for another semester is our safest option.
Some students may claim that the University’s decision came too soon. But even if the pandemic magically subsided in January, we still face the larger and even more daunting issue of distributing a vaccine across the globe. We needed the University to make this decision now – students need to figure out their housing plans, apply to spring jobs and internships and give their family peace of mind about their spring plans. It’s even more problematic for officials to leave us sitting on the edge of our seats.
We also need to remember that GW does not exist in a bubble. Had the University decided to open fully, adopt a hybrid model or even invite large groups of students back to live in residence halls, D.C. would be put at a higher risk. Just look at the students who decided to come back to campus and throw parties, infecting their peers. While it’s nice to think that all students are responsible with where they go and whom they expose, the reality is that the reintroduction of thousands of students from all across the country and the world would pose a serious threat to D.C. health and safety.
Up until the recent spread of the virus throughout the White House, D.C. had been doing a great job at regulating COVID-19 cases and remaining in phase three. Even with the possibility of a coordinated quarantine or subsequent tracking and tracing, inviting any large amount of students back to campus is a threat to public health. We saw how universities that brought their students back contributed to a spike in cases throughout their campuses and surrounding towns.
An online semester is not ideal – we knew this. But even though we’ll graduate in our childhood bedrooms and may not step foot on campus for a long time, the threat of the coronavirus is bigger than us and our pride. The pandemic isn’t going anywhere and the University made the right decision under the circumstances we’re facing.

The athletic department exceeded its $100,000 fundraising goal in a campaign to mitigate the financial toll of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The campaign, which ends Monday, raised more than $101,000 at the time of publication for student-athlete support, like daily customized nutrition plans and recovery equipment. In a tweet, Athletic Director Tanya Vogel thanked donors and congratulated the athletic department’s development office for running the campaign.
“What a week!” she wrote. “Thank you to each and every one of our donors who made this possible.”
Kathleen Burger’s donation to gymnastics pushed the fundraising initiative over the finish line a day before the weeklong campaign ended, according to a tweet.
At the time of publication, men’s water polo, baseball, men’s basketball, women’s swimming and diving, women’s cross country and track, women’s soccer and volleyball surpassed their fundraising goals.
Men’s water polo led the charge, surpassing its goal by more than $4,000. The team’s more than $24,000 in donations was the most of any program.
Women’s soccer and women’s rowing also had pledges to match donations up to $10,000 and $5,000, respectively.
Men’s water polo and gymnastics attracted the most donors, receiving funds from 37 participants. Women’s soccer rounded out the top-three with 32 donors.
Of the 271 donors as of Sunday, 60 percent were alumni, 26 percent were parents, 11 percent were faculty or staff, 6 percent were friends and 1 percent were students. Donors from 30 different states participated in the campaign.

The order also states that District government agencies may ask people using D.C. facilities to provide identification and contact information “for the sole purpose of facilitating contact tracing."
Mayor Muriel Bowser is continuing D.C.’s state of emergency resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic to Dec. 31, she tweeted Wednesday.
Bowser published an emergency order Wednesday saying the extension was effective immediately and superseded any previous mayoral order issued during the public health emergency. The state of emergency was originally scheduled to end on Oct. 9, DCist reported.
“Without continued extraordinary measures authorized under a state of emergency, as well as community compliance with preventative measures, the progress the District has made in protecting the health, safety and welfare would be threatened and likely reversed,” the order reads.
The order also repealed and replaced portions of the District’s Phase Two plan, implemented June 22. New rules now allow public indoor pools to open, and fees for outdoor dining permits have been waived, according to DCist.
The District Department of Employment Services will also be responsible for issuing public health emergency grants to help train District residents to support government, educational institutions, businesses and other organizations in the coronavirus response, according to the order.
The order also states that District government agencies may ask people using D.C. facilities to provide identification and contact information “for the sole purpose of facilitating contact tracing,” according to DCist. Any information collected under the rule will be destroyed after 30 days, the order states.
“Further, rates of infection are higher in Maryland and Virginia than in Washington, D.C., and due to our porous borders, the regional situation affects the necessity to continue the state of emergency,” the order states.
The state of emergency, which grants the mayor broad powers to restrict people’s movements, set curfews and procure supplies and support, first went into effect on March 11.

The mask rollout comes two months after the agency received its first load of 500,000 masks in July – a two-month delay officials attribute to the federal government's failure to individually wrap each face covering.
Local commuters can now receive free protective face masks when they board the Metro to avoid spreading the coronavirus on trains and buses.
Metro officials started distributing free individually wrapped face masks at Metro stations earlier this week, NBC Washington transportation reporter Adam Tuss tweeted Wednesday. Tuss tweeted that the masks are part of the agency’s supply of 1 million face coverings the federal government granted the agency this summer.
The mask rollout comes two months after the agency received its first load of 500,000 masks in July – a two-month delay officials attribute to the federal government’s failure to individually wrap each face covering, DCist reported last week. As Metro officials were left to individually wrap each face mask, the federal government shipped the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority an additional 500,000, doubling the agency’s total supply, according to the report.
City officials also announced plans in August to send hand sanitizer dispensers to 130 stations this fall, which have yet to be seen around the city, according to DCist.

The senate said LeBlanc violated the "core principles" of GW and endorsed his proposed vetting process for future vice presidential hires.
Updated: Oct. 10 at 11:00 a.m.
The Faculty Senate voted Friday to express “severe disapproval” of University President Thomas LeBlanc’s hiring of Heather Swain, who rescinded her job offer after widespread criticism over her role in the Larry Nassar sexual abuse case.
The senate’s appointment, salary and promotion policies committee recommended the senate censure LeBlanc following a private meeting with him about the matter on Sept. 25, but some senators voiced concerns about a censure damaging the potential for future shared governance. The senate voted 20-13 to remove the mention of censure, which was followed by a 33-3 vote approving the amended resolution.
The senate said LeBlanc violated the “core principles” of GW and endorsed his proposed vetting process for future vice presidential hires.
“It gives me no pleasure to introduce this resolution, but we have to do what we have to do,” Murli Gupta, the chair of the ASPP committee, said at the meeting.
LeBlanc announced Swain as GW’s vice president of marketing and communications on Aug. 12, but within days of the announcement, hundreds signed petitions condemning the hiring. Investigators said in a 2018 report that Swain helped Michigan State University engage in a “culture of anti-transparency” during the Nassar investigation through her role in MSU’s communications office.
Swain told a trustee to copy Michigan State’s legal counsel on an email to other trustees in order to “maintain privilege” even though the email did not seek legal advice, the report states.
Moments before the senate began debating the resolution, LeBlanc left the virtual meeting and asked Provost Brian Blake to chair the remainder of the meeting. LeBlanc also signed off from the senate’s September meeting before senators discussed the original censure resolution and decided to refer it to the ASPP committee.
LeBlanc did not immediately return a request for comment through a spokesperson.
The Board of Trustees said in a statement that LeBlanc met all of the requests in the original censure resolution and committed to a new process to “strengthen” the involvement of faculty in future vice presidential hires.
Blake said he had “strong feelings” about the resolution that would put him in a “compromising position” to chair the proceedings and delegated his responsibility to Arthur Wilson, the senate’s executive committee chair. Blake logged off from the virtual meeting during the discussion.
Arthur Wilson, the senate’s executive committee chair, said trustees did not want faculty to censure LeBlanc, preferring that senators voice strong disapproval of the hiring instead.
Wilson said maintaining a dialogue with trustees and administrators, rather than voting to censure, will enable senators to advocate for faculty more successfully.
“My sense is the issue here is transparency,” Wilson said. “The administration is not particularly transparent nor are the trustees. As long as we have that hierarchy, the University would not be as successful as it could be. We need to make sure shared governance is working.”
Sylvia Marotta-Walters, a faculty senator and the former senate executive committee chair, said the senate made it clear that LeBlanc’s hiring of Swain was wrong at its September meeting, and a formal censure would only impair the senate’s ability to practice shared governance with administrators in the future.
“Justice was served in September when we uniformly said this was an egregious act,” Marotta-Walters, who voiced support for the amended resolution, said at the meeting. “Now it’s time to make peace.”
Miriam Galston, a faculty senator and an associate professor of law, said she supported the censure resolution in September but opposed doing so now because LeBlanc provided a full accounting of the Swain hiring process and proposed changes for administrators to vet candidates in the future.
“Shared governance means not only that they listen to us, but we listen to them,” Galston said. “In this situation where we have gotten the two things we requested, I don’t see what productive purpose passing this censure serves.”
Charles Garris, a faculty senator and a former senate executive committee chair, said Swain didn’t do “anything wrong,” and the University community has been perpetuating false narratives about Swain’s involvement with Nassar.
“I believe resolution 21/13 is a disgrace for supporting this kind of demonization of an innocent person and will damage our credibility as the senate,” Garris said.
But some senators cautioned against watering down the censure resolution, arguing it would set a bad precedent.
Jamie Cohen-Cole, a faculty senator and an associate professor of American studies, referenced LeBlanc’s comments in January 2019 saying that leaders are often not held accountable for their behavior. Administrators identified inconsistent leadership as one of four top culture issues at GW following an employee survey conducted by the Disney Institute.
Cohen-Cole said the ASPP committee made their recommendation based on additional information from the private meeting that other senators do not have, so the senators should follow the suggestion.
The senate met last month to consider censuring LeBlanc for the hiring and recommitted the resolution to the ASPP committee to seek a “full and complete” accounting of the Swain hiring process before a final vote over concerns about LeBlanc’s legal ability to share hiring details publicly.
“A vote against this measure is a vote by members of the senate that their judgement in the absence of data that ASPP members had is better than what ASPP had,” he said. “You would move to put your judgement without data ahead of what your peers did with data.”
Shaista Khilji, a faculty senator and a professor of human and organizational learning, said the GW community is “hurting.” She supported maintaining a formal censure but added LeBlanc should be allowed to learn from his mistake.
“I would like to move on and allow him to show it was a mistake,” Khilji said. “The senate is a place where we can respectfully disagree with each other and allow him to show he has learned.”
Hundreds of faculty, staff, students and alumni have signed petitions and statements calling on LeBlanc to resign in recent months, with many citing the Swain hiring in their rationale.
The ASPP committee also endorsed LeBlanc’s proposed vetting procedure following the September private meeting.
The procedure includes creating an internal search committee to aid an outside search firm and a “trusted third party” to vet candidates through press and social media searches, criminal and civil case searches, and reference checks.
The University president will personally contact the last two presidents or leaders for whom all finalist candidates worked before making an offer, the procedure states.

Former U.S. Ambassador John L. Loeb Jr. will donate $12.5 million to GW’s religious freedom institute that bears his name, officials announced in a press release Thursday.
Loeb’s gift to the Loeb Institute for Religious Freedom, a center housed in the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences dedicated to promoting religious freedom and the separation of church and state, comes about four years after he donated $2.5 million to create the institute. Officials said the donation will allow the institute to develop new programs and fellowships and become a leader in the study of religious freedom, according to the release.
“We are grateful to Ambassador Loeb for his generous philanthropy to GW, which is rooted in the strong belief that we must move beyond mere toleration of religious differences to develop sincere respect for each other’s beliefs and observances,” University President Thomas LeBlanc said in the release.
Loeb founded the George Washington Institute for Religious Freedom – an independent nonprofit dedicated to promoting discussion about religious liberties – in 2009. He served as the U.S. ambassador to Poland from 1981 to 1983 and as a delegate to the 38th session of the UN General Assembly.
“Ambassador Loeb’s generosity has already had a major impact, enabling the institute to educate, train and teach George Washington’s unique and historic concepts to students and introduce a select group of undergraduates to the world of diplomacy,” said professor Samuel Goldman, the founding executive director of  the Loeb Institute.
