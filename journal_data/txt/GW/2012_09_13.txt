More student records have been expunged over the last four years, as the University’s judicial policies have shifted to emphasize education over consequences.
The Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities wiped about 79 percent of students’ requests to have their judicial records wiped from 2011-2012 – 6 percent more than the last academic year. Over the last year, GW has also loosened its policies so as to stress educational support following first-time offenses, rather than hand students a disciplinary record, and outlined consequences for common drug and alcohol offenses.
Under the policies implemented last year, students can avoid earning a disciplinary record by completing substance education and training. Students who establish a record can ask the University to wipe non-academic disciplinary violations related to alcohol, drugs, property destruction and theft, Gabriel Slifka, director of the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities, said.
Students hoping to study abroad or apply to graduate school, for example, may apply to clear their records one year after their last disciplinary conference or University hearing regarding the recorded incident. A judicial records sweep does not affect records kept by outside agencies like the University Police Department or Metropolitan Police Department.
“If a student’s non-academic disciplinary record has been administratively expunged,” Slifka said, his office “would communicate to a third-party conducting a record check that the student does not currently have a non-academic disciplinary record with the University.”
While the University expunged a greater percentage of records at the end of last year compared to the past four years, it also saw the smallest number of students apply to clear their records – just 94 individuals compared to the 128 who petitioned during the 2008-2009 academic year.
The University also cleared more than 700 graduated students’ non-academic disciplinary records following Commencement as part of an annual sweep – a number that remains relatively consistent each year, Slifka said.
Each year, as laid out in the Student Code of Conduct, the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities automatically expunges graduating students’ non-academic disciplinary records if they were never suspended or expelled.
Slifka said letters that detail students’ violations also outline the expungement process. Students can apply online, provided that they have not received any other disciplinary marks and completed sanctions.
One senior who asked that her record be expunged because she is applying to graduate school said it was cleared within three weeks of her request.
“I’m really lucky that we do have this policy in place,” the senior, who asked to remain anonymous, said. She added that she went through 10 minutes of questioning about why she deserves of a clear record and what she learned.
GW is more lenient with expunging non-academic disciplinary records than similar schools. Many other schools wait from one to seven years before providing clean slates.
American and Boston universities maintain disciplinary records for seven years after students are formally notified of disciplinary actions. They do not offer exceptions.
Georgetown University offers a similar policy – barring cases of suspension and expulsion, non-academic disciplinary records are purged after graduation.

A District organization with ties to GW helped launch a smartphone application this week that allows victims to report sexual assault and seek help in the city or on campus.
Through the app, which went live Sept. 10, victims can dial the police, locate the nearest medical center with rape kits, call support hotlines or request taxi services. It includes contact information for support centers at eight universities, including GW.
Men Can Stop Rape, a national sexual assault prevention group with a branch at GW, worked with the D.C. Office of Victim Services to create the app, which Mayor Vincent Gray will officially launch Friday. Neither the GW Hospital nor Student Health Service has rape kits on hand. The only location citywide to receive a rape kit is cross-town at Washington Hospital Center.
Matt Scott, co-president of the GW chapter of Men of Strength, said he hopes more victims will report abuses if they can easily find contact information for university police or campus offices, like GW’s Student Rights and Responsibilities.
“It’s a lot less intimidating than going to a police department or even a friend, in certain cases,” said Scott. He added, “When you have the personal names and personal touch, it makes it a lot easier to say, ‘Yeah, maybe I will go to Tara [Pereira] and talk to her about what happened,’ ” referring to the University’s point person for sexual assault.
The national group has tallied about 300 iPhone downloads and 60 Android downloads as of Sept. 11, Jared Watkins, development coordinator of Men Can Stop Rape, said. GW’s Men of Strength is working with the Students Against Sexual Assault group to raise awareness of the app through postering and word of mouth. The organization, which launched at GW last year, stresses bystander intervention among college males.
“We created the app, because in the moments after an assault, a survivor – victim – should not have to search and track down information on receiving crisis or follow-up care,” Watkins said. He said the app is not only a resource, but also “a conversation starter” for students in D.C.
Deputy Title IX Coordinator and Director of Campus Inclusion Initiatives Tara Periera said the app falls in line with GW’s efforts to amp up awareness of sexual assaults, which she calls one of the nation’s most under-reported crimes.
She said the app will be a “concise one-stop shop for answering questions,” adding that it will be most effective in conjunction with GW’s prevention campaigns that are still in the works. She said she hopes the app can be “one of the ingredients that makes these resources and services more accessible to students.”
In the first two weeks of the semester, three students reported four sexual abuses on or near campus.
One in every six American women, 80 percent of whom are under the age of 30, are victims of rape or attempted rape, according to statistics from the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network.
Kostantinos Skordalos, co-president of Men of Strength, said he hopes more victims will report cases, adding “the societal pressures and stigma are still present.”
“Honestly, my wish is that all members of the GW community, regardless of age, gender identity or sexual orientation, will download this app, not only for themselves, but also as a resource to help their friends.

As the leader of the University’s largest college nears the end of a deanship that added full-time faculty and research funding, she will work against a groundswell of faculty disapproval that multiple professors and department heads say could stall progress for the school.
A half-dozen current or former department chairs in the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences said disapproval could hang over Peg Barratt’s head this year, as she works with faculty who know she has just eight months left in her term.
“When a leader is a lame duck, it just is harder,” one department chair said. “It’s really tough when people know your time is limited. She’s been a controversial figure to some.”
Richard Robin, director of the Russian Language program, predicted the school would be “in standstill mode” as Barratt works around faculty whose support she has lost. Faculty criticized Barratt in a survey last spring, saying she was out of touch and lacked a clear vision for the school.
“She took away enough from enough programs to get enough people mad at her,” said Robin.
But Senior Vice Provost for Academic Affairs and Planning Forrest Maltzman said he thought Barratt would continue to launch programs, make hiring decisions and successfully fundraise in her last year.
“In the United States presidency, you have a ‘lame duck’ period. I don’t think a deanship is like that. We’ve seen a lot of deans accomplish things up to their last minute in office,” Maltzman, a political scientist, said. “You know, Dean Barratt has lots of goals, and I have no doubts that she’ll accomplish them this year.”
Barratt said she will “stay the course” for the remainder of her tenure, working with the school’s wide range of disciplines, building up an arts initiative that will bring more outside artists to GW and improving the college’s English as a second language programs. Barratt, like other deans at GW, also spends 40 percent of her time courting donors to increase fundraising.
But one major initiative could help focus the snapshot of her up-and-down five-year tenure. Barratt will lay the groundwork this year for an undergraduate economics program, where 50 students will spend two years in D.C. and one year each in France and China, by fall 2014.
She said she will travel this fall to hammer out the details with the University’s partner schools in the global degree program – Sciences Po in France and Renmin University in Suzhou, China this fall.
The program will likely include 30 to 50 students, and recruitment will begin in the spring, Barratt said.
“This will bootstrap us to be playing with the big players in each of these other countries. That’s what [Columbian College] has been leading, but the University as a whole is doing it too,” she said.
Barratt, hired away from the National Institutes of Health by former University President Stephen Joel Trachtenberg in 2007, has made strides for the college since her arrival. The number of full-time faculty has risen 8.5 percent, and external research dollars have increased 9 percent since her second year as dean.
Professors, though, called out Barratt in a survey last April. They said she failed to offer a clear vision for the college or work with faculty to solve problems.
“I think she was just out of touch with the chairs. She was making decisions not related to what the actual chairs wanted,” one department chair, who asked to remain anonymous, said.
Edward Berkowitz, a professor of history who used to chair that department, said he applauded Barratt’s leadership, but added that last spring’s negative survey revealed a dean who had lost support.
“That was extremely unfortunate, because people didn’t realize that if you take a survey – ‘How you feel about your boss?’ – they’re going to say they’re not going to like the boss. It’s impossible to satisfy everyone,” he said. “That undercut her support and made it difficult for her to continue.”
Now, one of the most important tasks Barratt should take on, some professors said, is ensuring a smooth transition to the next Columbian College dean.
An elected group of Columbian College faculty will form to begin a search for Barratt’s replacement later this month – a switch that brings excitement and headaches into faculty members’ lives, Berkowitz said.
Barratt will not be part of the search committee. She will have “almost nothing” to do with the selection of the next dean, she said.
Former deans Lester Lefton and William Frawley left in 2000 and 2006, respectively, to take on administrative roles at other universities.
“Many of us feel that we’ve had too many deans over the course of the last 10 years,” Berkowitz said. “It’s similar to a pro football team who gets a defensive coordinator. They have to learn a whole new playbook because the defensive coordinator creates his own scheme.”
Faculty discontent surrounding Barratt’s deanship started with a controversial 2010 plan to cut the number of general course requirement credits from 42 to 24, inciting some faculty to believe they were “getting the shaft,” said chemistry professor Houston Miller, who said he approved of Barratt’s deanship.
The next spring, outrage over a proposed move to relocate the philosophy department to the Mount Vernon Campus drew more than 100 faculty names to an online petition against Barratt’s decision. She reversed course a month later.
Faculty tussles over research laboratory space in the Science and Engineering Hall also brought Barratt into the fray.
“Each of my departments has their view of the world, and it’s not until you get into the dean’s office that we’re in a position of weighing and balancing all of those pieces,” Barratt said. “When I arrived, I promised all the chairs that I would work with them to move each of their programs to the cutting edge, and I have done so, and I will continue to do so for this last year.”

Top administrators are charting ways to shift off-campus researchers back into GW-owned buildings this fall to pull more grant money back into the University.
The government only covers 26 percent of indirect costs – like administrative and building expenses – associated with research conducted in leased spaces, like 2020 K Street and the Watergate complex, using federal grants. If researchers work on campus, the University recovers double that amount to help foot the bills, while also raking in about half a million dollars of extra revenue.
Vice President for Research Leo Chalupa said he will join Provost Steven Lerman, Executive Vice President and Treasurer Lou Katz in setting a “chess board” of moves into motion this year to plan researchers’ potential relocations.
The University is relying on these indirect cost recoveries to help fund the $275 million Science and Engineering Hall and startup packages to lure more academics to GW through Chalupa’s research-focused office, which has steadily built up since he arrived in 2009.
Most research is already done on the Foggy Bottom and Virginia campuses, but University spokeswoman Latarsha Gatlin said GW does not keep track of the percent of researchers who work off campus. Chalupa said no researcher will be forced to move.
Some off-campus researchers would likely move into the Science and Engineering Hall or the Virginia Science and Technology Campus, or space on the Foggy Bottom Campus that opens up as new buildings are completed.
One of GW’s most successful departments in nabbing outside funding – the department of health policy – maintains a portfolio of about $40 million in outside money, said Leighton Ku, the director of GW’s Center for Health Policy Research. But because it operates out of a leased office building on K Street, the University misses out on recovering much of those funds.
Ku said he’s been told the department will not entirely fit in the new School of Public Health and Health Services building, set to open in 2014. He said he does not know whether his off-campus space, will move.
“The risk is that if we’re not successful in attracting more researchers – particularly in the other departments – to do more research, then potentially we have a big budget hole of how we’re going to fund the Science and Engineering Hall,” Ku said.
The University projected a $55 million net increase in indirect cost recoveries over the next decade, according to funding estimates last December that Katz called a “reasonable project” Tuesday. About three-fourths of all indirect cost recoveries over the next decade will fund the Science and Engineering Hall, according to the same projection.
The University earned $21.6 million in indirect cost recoveries last year – far below peer schools like University of Southern California, which received about $132 million from indirect cost recoveries last year.
Over the last three years, indirect cost recoveries increased by $2 million at GW, a figure Katz said would rise as research dollars continued to funnel into GW.
“We never said you’re going to make money, per se, but you’re still getting revenue to the institution,” Katz said. “There are other reasons to build up the sciences and engineering and do the research, and we believe in how this is overall going to raise the reputation and prestige of the institution and build the critical mass in those areas.”
The University brought in about $146 million in outside grants and contracts in fiscal year 2011,  the last year data was available, a slight dip from the year before.
Two teams of researchers earned one of the largest hauls in recent history, the University announced last week, earning $24.5 million in two grants for public health studies.
Anthony Yezer, an economics professor who chairs the Faculty Senate’s research committee, said much of the extra federal money will need to be funneled back into the research projects before it can go toward the Science and Engineering Hall.
“A sponsored research project doesn’t pay for itself with a Xerox machine. There are a lot of things that have to be funded with indirect costs recoveries before there’s anything left over to pay for a building,” Yezer said.

With the opening of the college football season a couple of weeks ago, I’m sure many students thought that if only GW had a 100,000 seat football stadium, then we would truly have Colonial pride.
But we shouldn’t use our lack of a football team as an excuse to avoid addressing the lacking sense of spirit.
If we want a greater sense of attachment and pride to our university, we must celebrate the community that we already have. It’s up to the student body to put an end to this persistent problem.
In response to the perennial complaints about community, the Student Association plans to host a “GW Day” to boost Colonial pride by adding a new campus tradition.
We are not a small liberal arts school with a traditional campus quad and a tight-knit community. And we’re not a large state school with tremendous school spirit. Since GW is a medium-sized research university, students here are forced to associate with smaller, fragmented communities that are often disconnected from the larger school.
But just because we cannot emulate what happens on other campuses doesn’t mean that students should feel totally detached from the University. There’s nothing wrong with students who look to find a sense of belonging in smaller groups of friends.
In February, The Hatchet reported that the various religious groups on campus were failing to spark interfaith talks. This is an example of a time when students were broken into groups and struggled to unite.
Students must work harder to promote stronger relationships between religious groups to create a greater sense of belonging – not just to a specific club or group, but to a larger religious community.
Students will feel a sense of community when they are able to unite under a single, overarching identity.
And while it’s a noble goal for the Student Association to start initiatives like the GW Day, in the end, students have to take an active role in changing their outlook on the University. It’s our obligation to build that community we complain we don’t have.

Helanius Wilkins will challenge his audiences to embrace the darkest moments of their pasts during his one-man show.
The master’s of fine arts candidate’s show, titled /CLOSE/R, premieres this weekend and looks to employ choreography that exudes the passions and fears of an artist.
The show focuses on what makes individuals uncomfortable both in subject matter and physicality by forcing the audience to examine the human body and distressing emotions.
“/CLOSE/R reveals places and aspects of me from which the art I create emerges from. These things and passions are generally more hidden and channeled into broader works”, said Wilkins. “/CLOSE/R isolates and exposes my raw connections to my art and things that reflect my own truth.”
Wilkins did not walk into his rehearsals with a choreographed routine. Instead, he improvised and kept the moves that stuck out in his memory in a process he calls “sensing.”
He applies the same technique while teaching undergraduates as part of his master’s program.
“Rehearsals were so raw and emotional,” Hillary Hecht, a junior who studied with Helanius last year, said. “We looked very much into our own personal experiences to our own need for human connection, and what it felt like to be exposed, alone or burdened.”
Wilkins said a solo performance challenges the artist to make statements instead of asking questions. The narrative of the piece follows his journey – including moments of whimsy, intimacy and profanity.
“While /CLOSE/R embraces a certain level of intensity, the journey of the work explores places that include humor,” Wilkins said.
A professional dancer for 17 years, Wilkins said the decision to return to school took some thought, but he is grateful he joined GW’s 18-month-long master’s program last year, which allows professionals to refine and expand their craft.
/CLOSE/R, which will appear at Dance Place, features six projectors and a deconstructed, exposed set that emphasizes Wilkins’ interest in imperfections. The use of new technology – including projection and lighting – in the production is one Wilkins was excited to employ in his solo work.
“This program had a main component of technology, and that excited me. Along with that, I felt that I could never go back to school in a traditional sense given my world,” Wilkins said.
As an established choreographer and instructor, and the founder of EDGEWORKS Dance Theater, an all-male contemporary dance company, Wilkins’ experiences also stem from his education prior to attending GW. He studied dance at SUNY College at Brockport and has won numerous awards, including the 2008 Pola Nirenska Award for Contemporary Achievement in Dance and Kennedy Center honors.
He described his discovery of the word “choreographer” while watching the famous dancer Alvin Ailey on PBS as a child.
“I remember very vividly when he said that word, I knew, ‘That’s me! That’s what I do!’ ” Wilkins said. “I always say I didn’t choose dance. Dance chose me.”
/CLOSE/R will appear at Dance Place Sept. 15 at 8 p.m. and Sept. 16 at 7 p.m., with an advisory for mature audiences, due to nudity and profanity.

The start of the semester was the first time I had been back at GW in over eight months. And while I didn’t forget the layout of campus, there was one thing I found when I returned that I didn’t expect to see.
I realized I had completely forgotten about freshmen. And it did not take long for them to make their presence known.
I stood mystified one night, watching as a crowd of bodies stumbled over one another, ravenous for alcohol, a party or for their first taste of college life. I felt like I was in a zombie movie.
It’s become somewhat of a tradition for upperclassmen to mock and judge freshmen the first night back on campus. I was standing with a group outside of a friend’s townhouse, when a freshman approached us and boldly asked, “So like, what’s the deal here?”
I couldn’t help but recall my first night on campus. That Thursday night three years ago, I ended up at some sketchy fraternity party and like this girl, did not know what the deal was. In that moment, I realized there’s more to being a freshman than I once thought.
Freshmen possess something upperclassmen never will: an untainted perspective.
They are not yet burdened with job applications or choosing majors. They roam the campus that is not quite theirs, hopeful and blissfully blind to the mistakes that lay ahead.
There comes a point between your junior and senior years when you become too old to ask your Introduction to American Art professor 18 questions about footnotes. By now, our stupid question limit has surely run out. As upperclassmen, we may pretend to know everything. But freshmen are a reminder that we still have a lot to learn.
Being a freshman is something everyone can relate to. Watching this year’s freshmen make the same mistakes we did forces us all to reflect on our own personal growth.
We may forget about them or judge them, but freshmen are a source of nostalgia, making us feel old while reminding us just how far we’ve come since free tequila shots in the basement of a certain Mexican restaurant.
I don’t miss my daily commute on the Vern Express or struggling through economics for a second. But I am still not willing to own up to my seniority either. Both years serve as bookends for my college education.

On-campus protest goes unnoticed
I am writing in response to The Hatchet’s failure to cover the demonstration last Thursday for fair wages and treatment of all workers on campus.
Students joined representatives of the Laborers’ International Union of North America and employees of ACECO, a contractor doing demolition and asbestos removal on the Ross Hall project, to demand that the administration push for fair treatment of all workers on our campus.
GW should be a place where contracted workers are treated fairly under the law. Unfortunately, ACECO’s employees at Ross Hall have been shown anything but consideration and respect. Since the Ross Hall construction project is funded by a federal grant, ACECO is obligated to pay their employees the DC prevailing wage.
However, the workers have provided pay stubs that show ACECO directly violated those standards. It also has a long history of putting their employees’ safety at risk, even refusing to provide face masks in the dangerous job of asbestos removal.
Workers’ demands for just wages have been met with apathy and, in some cases, outright intimidation.
Here at GW, many of us have learned how to be activists. We’ve studied fundamental economic and political questions, we’ve worked for organizations and officials with tremendous influence in national and global affairs and we’ve campaigned and protested for causes that we believe in. In this case, violations of rights are not far away, and the conflict is not theoretical.
Workers are being mistreated on our own campus, and they are risking their jobs to stand for justice. We must stand with them.

Correction appended
Basketball season will officially kick off Oct. 12 at Colonial Invasion. But this year, students will rally at Colonial Invasion at Fort Myer, Va. at the Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall.
The annual event is meant to build excitement and enthusiasm around the men and women’s basketball teams, but this year it will function as both the starting mark of the basketball season and an honor to members of the military, athletic director Patrick Nero told The Hatchet.
But holding a campus tradition at an off-campus location is counterintuitive.
At a University that struggles to instill a sense of excitement around its athletic programs, hosting Colonial Invasion – virtually the largest campus pep rally – away from its home is a poor decision.
Asking students to take buses to Virginia – even if they are free – is still a deterrent to those who might have only attended because the Smith Center is near residence halls or dinner spots.
In the past, the University has demonstrated its support of members of the military through initiatives like the Yellow Ribbon Program. But hosting Colonial Invasion at a military base seems self-indulgent. Colonial Invasion is a spirit-building rally. It’s purpose is to promote the University rather than pay homage to the men and women who serve our country.
Holding a basketball rally at a military base aligns with neither the goal of boosting school spirit nor honoring our troops.
We support the troops and the University’s endeavors to honor their commitment to our country. But a weekend focused around students is not the time to highlight the efforts of men and women of our armed forces.
This article was updated Sept. 13, 2012 to reflect the following:
The Hatchet incorrectly reported that Colonial Invasion will take place on Colonials Weekend. In fact, Colonials Weekend is scheduled for the following weekend. We regret this error.
