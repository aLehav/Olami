Students on the Mount Vernon Campus will now hear the sirens of an EMeRG ambulance.
The University has decided to purchase a new ambulance for the student-run emergency response group that will likely be operational in the fall semester, said Senior Associate Vice President of Safety and Security Darrell Darnell, a move that calls for much applause.
The purchase of an additional ambulance will allow EMeRG to be an active presence on the Vern, which is particularly important as the campus continues to expand.
The purchase of this ambulance also provides an opportunity for the University to work with EMeRG to create a standardized method for acquiring new vehicles in the future. This would allow for a smooth process for replacing vehicles, which would be easier than the current haggling that occurs among EMeRG, the Student Association and administration.
It also creates a tangible timeline that allows both groups to plan for a new vehicle.
Such an agreement could include a specific timeline for when a new ambulance should be purchased. For example, the Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Service has an agreement with their administration to split the cost of a new ambulance every five years.
Tulane Emergency Medical Services is also planning on lobbying to have their administration set aside a certain amount of funding each year in preparation for the future purchase of a new vehicle.
A plan could also be devised that would allow for the replacement of a vehicle when it reaches a certain mileage.
An agreement would allow both the University and EMeRG to plan more long-term. If EMeRG and the University were to agree that every few years a new ambulance would be purchased, then administration, EMeRG and the SA could begin to put aside funding for the future purchase.
EMeRG provides critical medical emergency services to students on campus, and deserves a strong, lasting commitment from the University.

Last week, the University unveiled its online account system to provide parental access to students’ financial information.
Students can now provide access to four different users who are allowed to have direct oversight of students’ finances.
The new changes to this online portal are extremely laudable, as it will allow the financial aid office to improve how it provides its services to students and families.
Oftentimes, students and parents were frustrated over having to contact the financial aid office and work through bureaucratic red tape to acquire information. This, in turn, forced the financial aid office to deal with irritated individuals rather than actually work on financial aid applications and requests.
But the additional access granted to parents will allow them to view important financial information independently, decreasing the need for families to contact the financial aid office in order to sort out small details. This will also benefit the financial aid office, as it will likely deal with fewer distractions, such as finding out basic online account information for families.
Students who have frustrating campus or residential experiences may often gain a negative view of the entire institution.
Taking simple steps like these to improve the way an office operates will improve these critical day-to-day interactions between students and the administration.
Ultimately, these types of improvements benefit students and the University. Improved efficiency means that the offices providing services are able to focus on substantial work, while students are happier with their experience at the institution.

The Hatchet originally said the University changed its system, but in fact it just unveiled intentions to change the policy.

Set fire to your strict plan and watch it burn.
Of course, I am talking about sending the course catalogue of your overly-planned college career up in flames.
With the need to accommodate required classes, it is easy for students to lose track of the true purpose of college. We are not here only to take the courses required for our majors and move on in pursuit of a career. We’re also here to experience the world and the diverse perspectives of the people around us.
College is about learning for the sake of learning.
It should be our prerogative to take classes that go beyond our major requirements.
By implementing the University’s general education curriculum, GPAC, which decreases the number of required classes for students in the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences, the University is certainly lightening the course load for CCAS students trying to relieve some course pressure and achieve more freedom when selecting classes.
It’s worthwhile to take advantage of this lightened required course load and sign up for some classes that pique your interests – even if they don’t count toward your major GPA.
Screenwriting, Japanese swordsmanship, musical cultures of black Americans and military geography are just some of the courses we might dismiss because they don’t directly count toward anything but graduation credits. But whimsy will not destroy your four-year plan, and, for what it’s worth, they do count toward something – your personal enlightenment.
And even schools without GPAC aren’t so mired by requirements to the extent that students can’t take a few courses that take them off the beaten path.
This is the one of only times in our lives devoted to learning every bit of information we can. Why waste time ignoring the things that interest us?
When the true meaning of college is forgotten, all that is left is a factory under the guise of a higher learning institution  that does little more than manufacture students as subject-specific drones.
My goal, from the beginning of my freshman year, has been to dedicate at least one class a semester to personal growth outside of my academic curriculum. Sometimes this fits into my major, other times it doesn’t, but each semester I’ve felt more accomplished and more informed about a field I would otherwise have had little to no knowledge about.
I learned for the sake of learning.
And to be quite honest, I needed to do it. I did not come to college to be trained or to be molded into an automaton. Hopefully, neither did you. Take advantage of those classes that make GW – and college itself – unique, so you retain the ferocity for knowledge you had at the start of college.
So, as the season of class registration begins, remember to be smart about your choices, and pick a class just because you know nothing about it.
Because otherwise, before you know it, your college career, and your chance to learn just for the sake of it, will go up in smoke.

In February, Republican presidential hopeful Rick Santorum told Glenn Beck that colleges are “indoctrination mills.” He later told ABC’s “This Week” host George Stephanopoulos that, “62 percent of kids who go into college with some sort of faith commitment leave without it.”
Beyond the fact that he did not provide a source for his claim – I actually believe 62 percent is the number people always use when providing bogus statistics – his statement has since sparked a great deal of controversy and conversation throughout the mediasphere and higher education circles about the role that religion plays, and should play, on college campuses.
And I’m glad it has.
There’s no doubt that attending college – particularly one without a religious affiliation, like GW – exposes students to a multitude of approaches to faith, God, prayer, religion and even religiosity itself. Before attending college, most of us understood the conventional wisdom of our hometowns and practiced what we were raised to practice. We now interact differently with both our friends and our faith.
With some prominent religious holidays coming up in the next few days, and campus groups gearing up accordingly, I’ve been thinking a lot about where the GW campus falls when it comes to religion.
Faith – or lack thereof – is one of the principal means by which we perceive and relate to the world. It transcends a place of worship or an act of prayer; the scripture we subscribe to is, in many ways, a constant variable in our day-to-day calculus, framing our environment and – consciously or not – factoring  into our decisions.
By adding exposure to other perspectives and subtracting the family pressure, college can change that equation.
But to say college is an atheism factory, or that we should remain as fastened to the faith we had at the start of college once we leave is an immature view of what should be a four-year stint with curiosity and questioning.
The strongest foundations have been weathered – and even a little shaken – numerous times. We know their strength when they are able to withstand difficult blows.
Our approach to religion should be no different. It’s more defendable if it’s tested; it becomes more our own when we’ve questioned it and come out on the other side in its favor.
Let college be that time to question.
Now, I understand Santorum’s concerns when it comes to students leaving college with different faiths, or without one entirely, when they came into college as pious individuals.
Interacting with members of other religions might influence our minds and persuade us to pick up a bit of a different faith’s wisdom. Taking a class in which we have to attend an unfamiliar service might make us momentarily uncomfortable, but then make us realize we share more in common than we thought.
But then again, this weekend, some of my friends are having a Passover Seder, and not just Jewish people are attending. My roommate is hosting an Easter Sunday brunch, and our friend, a staunch atheist, is invited.
And when we talk about what we’ve learned from these holidays and what we still seek answers to, the conversation awakens the part of us for which we came to college in the first place: to become educated and exposed to diversity in a way that makes us more whole.
And with all due respect, Santorum, that gives me faith.

The unrecognized diversity of international students
In “Foreign students have higher rates of cheating than American peers” (Mar. 26, p. 5), The Hatchet identified statistics on cheating, saying that, “International students are more likely to cheat than their American counterparts,” and that, “instances of cheating from this population have increased over the past five years.”
Indeed, 23 percent of incidences of academic dishonesty at GW came from non-citizen students in 2010, who make up just 12.1 percent of the student body overall.
The Hatchet rarely seems to report on the diverse international student body, yet it has an entire “Passports” blog devoted to students who study abroad.
So it startled me that last week’s article chose to attack the entire foreign student community as a whole, quoting Director of the Office of Academic Integrity Tim Terpstra as saying that the cheating tendency of this population is a “growing” problem. Presumably, cheating is a cultural phenomenon from which U.S. students are exempt, but one that is a problem for everyone beyond America’s borders.
I don’t need to mention that the student body consists of more than 2,000 international students. But I am disgusted at the categorization of all international students into one cheating entity.
Marginalized communities face an uphill battle against negative media portrayals, in which they are often underrepresented and subsequently mischaracterized by false stereotypes when they are.
When an entire community is rarely the topic of discussion, just one negative or unbalanced article can be enough to shape an identity.
Dare I mention hate crimes in my home country, the United Kingdom, and here in the U.S., are often a reaction to irresponsible reporting that extrapolates a stereotype from anecdotal or limited evidence? As an international student, what have I done to be tagged with the cheating label? Should professors scour my work more closely for academic dishonesty?
I have no doubt that the evidence prompts serious concerns. What makes students cheat? Are international students more likely to be accused, or caught? Are we talking serious plagiarism or merely mistyped citations? That is what good, ethical journalism – and proper evaluation – can help answer.
Rather than profiling, an investigation might yield more solutions to academic dishonesty.
The international community at GW represents an incredible group of students from across the planet. We are men and women of every color, religion, sexuality and age, and we are arguably more diverse than the homegrown cadre of American students attending. Please, Hatchet, afford us some journalistic rigor.

Two alumni will roll a bright blue food truck into Foggy Bottom next week to offer students an eating option they call a farmer’s market on wheels.
Jordan Phillips and Samuel Rioux, 2011 graduates, will bring their eco-friendly truck – with farm animals and D.C.’s monuments painted across its logo – to campus this month for breakfast, lunch and late-night meals, championing energy efficiency and natural ingredients.
“Our whole goal of the truck is to sell sustainable and organic foods at the highest quality we can at an affordable price for students,” Phillips said.
They plan to apply to become a GWorld vendor by this summer.
Rioux and Phillips – who both have catering experience but lack formal culinary training – continue to volunteer at the GroW Gardens on H Street between 23rd and 24th streets. While at GW, they started the Revolution Green living and learning cohort.
“We really want to be involved in the community here, instead of just driving up and then leaving. We really want to educate people about sustainable food,” Phillips said.
The duo planned to hit the streets with their $15,000 truck, called JP and Sam’s, two months ago, but
encountered delays while applying for business licenses and meeting city regulations, as well as purchasing and preparing the truck and getting insurance. Phillips said the truck’s brakes stopped functioning last week – another $1,000 expense.
The city’s food truck scene has exploded in the last two years and includes more than 100 restaurants on wheels, according to FoodTruckFiesta.com.
Rioux, an Elliott School of International Affairs alumnus, and Phillips, who graduated from the GW School of Business, became friends during their freshman year, when they lived on the same floor in Thurston Hall.
Running the food truck would be a one- or two-year gig for the pair, as Rioux plans to travel to Brazil to learn Portuguese and Phillips is applying to law schools. They hope to hire employees to manage the truck afterward if business is strong.
“I’ve always been a do-gooder, wanting to change the world and everything. I think business is really an awesome way to change the world,” Phillips said. “By giving people somewhere to spend their money other than McDonalds, [TGI] Friday’s or Subway, we can change people’s habits.”
To kickstart the business, Rioux and Phillips set up a fundraising account online, raking in about $3,000 from about 30 donors who will in exchange receive gift cards and T-shirts once the business is up-and-running. The two graduates have accrued about $10,000 in debt from the truck but joked that they have nothing to lose at a young age, using what Rioux called their “meager life savings” on the project.
“This is the only time in our lives really where we can throw our finances into jeopardy because we don’t have families or anything,” Phillips said.
JP and Sam’s will serve up foods ranging from French toast to sloppy Joes with grass-fed beef and cornichons – a fruit similar to a cucumber – for less than $10. They plan to park on campus everyday and serve students as early as 7:30 a.m.
Vegetables will come from Polyface, Inc., a farm in Swoope, Va., and coffee will travel to the District from Ceremony Coffee Roasters in Annapolis, Md.
“I think the quality and how we view our food truck is very different from the quick, tasty, but not the healthiest options out there,” Rioux said. His passion for sustainability developed while growing up in a family of recyclers in Maine who frequented farmer’s markets and grew produce in their backyard.

The GW Law School’s student senate will consider pulling its support next week for a policy proposal that would call out guest speakers for “hate speech.”
Seven law students and faculty members pitched a policy in March that would alert event-goers before “hate groups” come to campus – as defined by civil rights organizations – and call for increased security at these events. While the Student Bar Association Senate endorsed the policy at a March 19 meeting, it has since stalled.
Mike Johnson, a third-year law student and SBA senator, plans to ask for the retraction of senate’s declared support of the policy at its April 10 meeting. Johnson did not immediately return a request for comment Wednesday evening.
Third-year law student Samantha Ames proposed the policy following a scuffle of words after a Feb. 29 law school panel event on marriage equality that included representatives from the Family Research Council – labeled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center for being anti-gay.
Ames noted in a letter in the law school’s student newspaper, The Nota Bene, that she was alledgedly verbally harassed and physically intimidated by senior FRC fellow Peter Sprigg after the event for expressing her support for gay rights during the forum.
Sprigg said, while they disagreed on homosexuality, “my conversation with Ms. Ames, in an open area with many other students around, was entirely civil, and no reasonable observer could have concluded otherwise.”
For the policy to move forward, a faculty committee ultimately has to sign off on the proposal after the SBA sends it to the dean.
Law School Dean Paul Schiff Berman did not take a stance on the issue and urged further discussion, adding that he did not know which way the faculty leaned.
“I think it’s useful for students to engage in difficult debates about how best to balance core values of freedom of speech and open intellectual academic discourse with the desire to maintain an academic environment where diverse perspectives are welcomed and all members of the community feel included,” Berman said.
Ira Lupu, a constitutional law scholar and the F. Elwood and Eleanor David Professor of Law, said he would be “shocked if faculty approved the proposal as it stands” because its hate group label is decided by the civil rights organizations Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League, which he said have political motives.
“I think there will be overwhelming opposition to the proposition,” Lupu said. “In a free society, we don’t try to exclude people for being insulting or hateful.”
Chris Wassman, public relations chair for the GW College Republicans, said his organization created its own Facebook group – currently at 37 members – to oppose any future action regarding the proposal.
“The point on our end is to give students a way to state that they believe in maintaining the ability for a diversity of viewpoints to be shared on campus,” Wassman said.
Ames said she has listened to ideas to improve the policy and expects the two sides to bridge the gap through further debate this summer and fall.
“There tends to be a knee-jerk reaction against any policy having to do with speech, but the more people find out about what this really does and where it came from, the easier it is to see how reasonable the proposal really is,” Ames said. “What we came up with is the best way we could find to protect student safety without infringing on free speech.”
Incoming SBA president Michael Lueptow said he would look toward student opinion polls and open forums to weigh the policy’s merit.
This post was updated on April 5, 2012 to reflect the following:
The Hatchet characterized SBA president Nicholas Nikic as wary of the proposal because the debate it caused. In fact, Nikic was not expressing his opinion and was discussing the debate.
