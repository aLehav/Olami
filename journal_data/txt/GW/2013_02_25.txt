GW is an urban school largely devoid of tradition – with the exception that students rub the nose of our unofficial mascot, a hippo.
And when GW celebrated its namesake’s 281st birthday this weekend, most students were completely uninvolved in any type of celebration, which is a shame.
The University honored its namesake with the annual bonfire and s’mores roasting Friday in University Yard and invited Professor Emeritus Gordon Wood, an early American scholar, to give a lecture on George Washington’s legacy.
These events are all thoughtful gestures to remember and honor the University’s namesake. But Washington’s birthday offers an even greater opportunity to foster a sense of community and develop a lasting tradition on campus.
Other schools, for example, have larger celebrations. This University shares its namesake with Washington College in Maryland, which hosts an annual Birthday Ball to celebrate Washington’s birthday. This is something GW could seek to emulate.
At GW, there could be a number of events for students and alumni. Perhaps the University could offer a tailgate and block party before a basketball game, or host a comedian or performer to attract the entire community and make celebrating Washington’s birthday more of a mainstay tradition.
For the first time in its history last year, the University boasted over 250,000 living alumni. Administrators see this growing number of former students as a way to increase donations and bolster the University’s endowment. GW could use Washington’s birthday weekend as another opportunity to reconnect with graduates.
To encourage alumni to remain connected after graduation, the University hosts an annual alumni weekend. In the same vein, Washington’s birthday could serve as another opportunity to draw former students and their families from all over the country back to campus, transforming the weekend into a larger and more significant event. Though the University already hosts celebrations across the country to honor its namesake, a special weekend on campus could also help to bridge generations of students and alumni.
For students bogged down by midterms, Washington’s birthday celebration would be a refreshing way to cultivate a stronger sense of on-campus unity.
And at a time when hundreds of prospective and newly accepted students are visiting GW, it would be an opportunity to integrate future Colonials through a cornerstone tradition.
Going forward, GW should look to make Washington’s birthday an event that is truly memorable.

This editorial has been updated to reflect that the University already hosts dozens of alumni events across the globe for George Washington’s birthday.

If you have any connection to federal student aid, whether through the work study program or various grants, the sequester – or large federal spending cuts across the board – could directly affect you.
In the aftermath of the 2011 debt ceiling crisis, Congress proposed a series of steep budget cuts and tax increases to take effect this year that would serve as a deadline for forging some sort of compromise on the federal budget.
Facing this loaded gun of economic danger, Congress compromised last month on the issue of tax rates. But they couldn’t agree on spending cuts and ultimately delayed their onset.
As a result, massive spending cuts are set to take effect March 1, unless Congress can cut through the gridlock and compromise.
Tell your representative in Congress that, in a time when a college education is so vital to a person’s economic future, we can’t afford cuts to programs that make equal opportunity to education possible.
If they’re not averted, these spending cuts will affect nearly every division of government, including the Office of Federal Student Aid, an office within the Department of Education. Congress must act to avert these cuts, or the student aid that so many young people across the country rely on will vanish, crippling a generation and in turn, endangering the economic future of America.
GW students are no strangers to debt: The average GW graduate in 2011 came away with $32,714 worth, according to the Project on Student Debt. And 45 percent of the student body graduated with some form of debt that same year.
The Office of Federal Student Aid is the largest provider of student aid in the country. Its aid includes Federal Work-Study funds and Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, among other forms. But these departments would be slashed by $49 million and $37 million, respectively, if the sequester were to take effect.
And while Pell Grants are protected from cuts in the short term, “sequestration is a multi-year process and does not protect Pell beyond the first year,” according to a September 2012 report issued by the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.
About 1,480 GW students received Pell Grants last year, The Hatchet reported in September. And as the cost of college grows, the number of students relying on Pell Grants is bound to increase – which makes it more frightening that these grants may soon be at risk.
Other forms of aid would not be immune from these cuts. The origination fee for both Stafford Loans and parent loans for undergraduate students would increase, making it harder for students and their families to obtain the grants they need to help offset the costs of a college degree.
And in addition to direct cuts to aid, the entire aid infrastructure of the Department of Education would be crippled and slowed if it and its affiliated nonprofits were forced to furlough employees. Not only would such a move put students at risk for being unable to receive their aid in time for enrollment, it would “significantly harm the department’s ability to prevent fraud, waste and abuse in the very large, complex student-financial-assistance programs,” Secretary of Education Arne Duncan testified Feb. 14 to a Senate committee.
Limiting the government’s ability to protect itself from fraud and ensure its funds are spent is not a responsible cost-cutting measure. In fact, firing or furloughing employees might even ensure greater spending over time, as future administrations would be forced to pick up the bureaucratic pieces.
College students looking for a reason to get involved in politics won’t find a more relevant issue than the impact of sequestration on student aid funding.
Students have a responsibility to act. It’s time they honor that duty.

As the countdown to graduation begins, students are starting to wonder who will speak at Commencement. The expectations are high given past Commencement speakers – First Lady Michelle Obama, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the host of NBC’s “Nightly News” Brian Williams.
Typically, a panel of students, faculty and administrators select the Commencement speaker. And while this is productive, there are other ways to ensure the entire University community is involved in the process.
At the start of each academic year, the University could choose a theme based on its major tenets, like sustainability, social justice, service or research. GW could spend the year putting on programming that reflects this theme. The Commencement speaker could represent the theme and highlight GW’s accomplishments in that area. This could be an annual tradition.
And past experience proves that this approach works. When the first lady was invited to speak to the Class of 2010, she only agreed to come on the condition that GW students perform 100,000 hours of community service. That year’s theme was civic engagement. And as a result, thousands of students turned out in droves to participate in community service across the District, ensuring that Obama spoke at Commencement. In one of GW’s prouder moments, the community not only rose to the challenge, but also surpassed the 100,000-hour goal.
This is an example of what can happen if students work together toward a single purpose, and the University should look to employ this approach in the future.
A speech about students’ own cause would add substance and value beyond the usual trite advice and lines of encouragement, addressing the significance of the accomplishments of a graduating class.
For example, the University could focus on sustainability and spend the year organizing environmental projects for students. A prominent environmental activist, like Al Gore, could serve as the speaker.
Graduation speeches are never easy to construct, given that it is hard not to sound generic. A speech should be based off one of the University’s major values.

More than 30 million Americans struggle with eating disorders throughout their lifetimes, according to the National Eating Disorders Association.
Eating disorders vary in shape, size, origin and manifestation.
At GW, students do not have to find a solution for eating disorders alone. This year’s Love Your Body Week, from Feb. 25 to March 2, has pulled together an extensive coalition, proving that no matter what you’re going through, you don’t have to go through it alone.
SPEAK GW, Active Minds at GWU, The eMpowEr Project through ADPi, the Feminist Student Union, the University Counseling Center, HOPEs and the Student Health Service will work together with the administration during a week of programming that seeks to help, advocate for and raise awareness of those struggling to find acceptance.
Love Your Body Week is about working to ensure that the University provides the best possible services for students, especially given that the National Institute of Mental Health estimates that one in every four college students has an eating disorder.
Love Your Body Week focuses not only on raising awareness about eating disorders, but also on seeking to advance a positive body image and whole-body wellness. Programming includes a healthy cooking class, panel discussions on beauty and the media and efforts to increase positive messaging around campus.
Finally, Love Your Body Week is about helping those who seek acceptance: acceptance into a community of survivors, acceptance of one’s own body – free from judgment and self-doubt – and acceptance of each other as friends and people who ask for help.
So if you’re feeling alone in your struggles, remember that when you replace “I” with “we,” even “illness” becomes “wellness.”

A lot of things will really suck for me after leaving college.
I’ll have to get up before 10:30 a.m. and pay for my own food and rent. And I’ll no longer be able to use the “I’m still in college” excuse when doing dumb things.
And for a nerd like me, it will also suck not being able to just go to class and learn on a daily basis. And in my last semester, I’ve realized that I took some classes in subjects I really enjoyed and wish I could have studied more in-depth.
For that reason, the University should offer students the option to take on an increased workload for additional credit in some classes, allowing students to delve more deeply into topics they find interesting.
Stanford University, which employs this method, offers a sliding scale of credits for some courses. A student can choose to take a course for three, four or five credits. And the more credits you take, the more outside work the course requires.
At GW, students have the option of taking a few courses pass/fail if they really want to avoid doing the work.
Students interested in a particular course or subject should be encouraged to explore the material outside the limits of a traditional three- or four-credit model. This would add flexibility to class schedules, as students could have the opportunity to take fewer classes and focus more on one class worth more credits than the others.
Geri Migielicz, a visiting professor at Stanford University, told me that students take her course for anywhere from three to five credits, and said this flexibility allows some students into her course who would otherwise be unable to take it because of scheduling conflicts.
Sometimes I think back to the different authors or playwrights I studied in a survey English course and wish I had time to read more of their works. By studying a particular writer more intensively, a student could essentially create an individualized seminar.
Class difficulty could be tied to the amount of credits that a student receives. Perhaps by adding extra readings and assignments, the student could receive four credits instead of three. And to add two credits, a student might have to write a research paper in addition to other major assignments.
Many departments at GW already allow students to complete an honors thesis that takes a significant amount of work, but this is something that students can only take advantage of once in their college career. Some courses already use this model, and offer two sections within the same class: a regular-credit section and a Writing in the Disciplines section for those who wish to do extra assignments to satisfy that requirement.
And while it’s unknown how many students would consider using this special credit system, it certainly doesn’t hurt to at least offer the option. Anything that allows students to further explore their academic passions creates a heightened intellectual atmosphere on campus.
College doesn’t last forever, but students should be able to maximize what they learn in their courses while they’re still here.

The Colonials never backed down against a strong Denver team, but they couldn’t compete with the Pioneers’ firepower Friday afternoon. GW ultimately fell to the Pioneers 17-6.
The team struggled at the net from the start. Just 40 seconds into the game, a Denver foul gave Colonial senior Nicole Lacey a free position attempt and a chance to strike first. Denver goalie Hannah Hook saved the shot, however, and the Pioneers rushed back down the field to net the first score of the game less than a minute later.
The Colonials answered with a strong offensive front. Fluid movement and coordinated passing allowed them to take the next four shots of the game, but they missed each time.
“Our attack moved better together today, but it really came down to our shots. We need to take that one extra second, throw a fake in there and get around [the goalie],” sophomore midfielder Rachel Mia said.
GW did score eventually, and with 23 minutes and 24 seconds to go in the first half, Mia tied the game with her eighth goal of the season.
But the defense could not hold the tie. The Colonials couldn’t stop the Pioneers’ fast and aggressive play, and ultimately gave up eight unanswered points. Head coach Tara Hannaford blamed the team’s level of communication.
“Defensively, we didn’t work together as well as I would have liked,” she said.
Lacey whipped in an unassisted goal with five minutes and 44 seconds remaining, but the Colonials’ scoring offense remained otherwise anemic throughout the first half. GW shot the ball 11 times, but scored only twice.
“We had a lot of opportunities,” Hannaford said.
GW’s defense looked stronger as the half came to a close – dislodging multiple balls from the sticks of Denver attackers as they drove to the net – but ceded an 11th goal just 16 seconds before halftime.
The Colonials came into the second half with renewed energy. Mia said it didn’t feel like the team was behind, a sentiment echoed by Hannaford.
“I think we thought we were still in it, if we played our kind of lacrosse,” Hannaford said. “We believe that we can win any game until the last second.”
The will to win showed. Denver won the draw-control battle to start the period and quickly gave the ball to junior Jenn Etzel, the game’s leading scorer. Colonial freshman midfielder Olivia Boudreau then caused a turnover and got her team the ball back. GW seemed determined to score, recovering ground balls until sophomore midfielder Jamie Bumgardner drove one, unassisted, straight to the back of the Denver net with 28 minutes to go.
But the defense could not maintain that momentum. Denver scored the next four points, making the score 15-3 in its favor with 15 minutes and 48 seconds remaining in the game.
Responding, Mia connected with junior midfielder Lindsey DiAntonio for a goal.  Bumgardner followed with another of her own, but it was too late. Denver scored twice more before DiAntonio could net a final point, and then the game was over.
Hannaford said her team will look to improve defensive coordination and shooting in practice this week. The Colonials have until Wednesday to prepare for their next game against George Mason.
“We definitely are going to focus on working together,” sophomore goalkeeper Mackenzie Jones said. “For me, [I’ll] definitely [be] continuing to communicate with my defense.”

Freshman Oliver Keegan shattered an Atlantic 10 record Saturday in the 200-yard fly, earning his first gold medal at the Atlantic 10 Championships in Geneva, Ohio.
Keegan made three trips to the podium during four days of competition, helping to lead GW to a fourth-place finish overall. For a team that placed sixth out of seven teams in the tournament last year, it’s an exciting improvement.
“The records obviously stand out, but they all showed a lot of focus and determination throughout the four-day competition. I’m proud of how they handled themselves,” head coach Dan Rhinehart said in an email.
Keegan’s race was “probably the single most exciting race of the entire meet,” Rhinehart said. In the final individual race of the competition, he won in the last six inches. Keegan also took home bronze in the 500-yard freestyle, and joined seniors Phillip Graeter and Niklas Glenesk and freshman Jordan Sharples, to place third in the 800-yard freestyle relay, breaking the school record Graeter and Glenesk helped set last year.
Graeter matched Keegan in trips to the podium, placing third in the 200-yard individual medley and winning his first gold medal in the 200-yard fly.
The 200-yard medley relay team of Keegan, senior Luke Quimby, junior Jake Mortensen and sophomore Garrett Cottingham placed sixth with a time of 1:31.32, but managed to break a 14-year-old school record. Cottingham went to the podium for the first time Saturday with a third-place finish in the 200-yard breaststroke.
“The success of this kind of competition depends not only [on] the champions, but more often, the scorers ‘in the trenches,’ ” Rhinehart said.
On the women’s side, the team placed fifth of 11 teams. Junior Lindsay Moore made her first career trip to the podium Saturday, tying for third in the 200-yard backstroke. Moore broke her own school record twice, once in the preliminary heat and again in the finals, with a time of 2:00.12. Moore also broke her own school record Friday, placing fourth in the 100-yard backstroke.
“Friday was a big day as we continued to build on our standing from the first two days, but ultimately, it comes down to what happens on the final day,” Rhinehart said. “Where you place on Day One doesn’t really count – the last day is the key.”
Freshman Lauren Steagall placed fifth in the 100-yard breaststroke, also breaking a school record. Classmate Remy Neville placed first in the B final, good for ninth overall, breaking another school record. Rhinehart said both races were some of the most exciting races of the weekend.
The Colonials 400-yard freestyle relay team of juniors Sloan Saunders, Melissa Fernandez and Sydney Saunders and freshman Kally Vanderbilt placed fourth, breaking a school record from 2011 which Sloan and Sydney Saunders helped set. Junior Caroline Myers placed fourth with a season best time of 4:54.43 in the 500-yard freestyle. It was an important finish in order to keep the Colonials ahead of Rhode Island, which finished in sixth.
“The fatigue obviously increases and can become a factor as you head into the final day – they fought off the fatigue factor and ‘toughed it out’ and were able to hold off charges on the final day,” Rhinehart said.

She was named one of the most influential women in Spain, but Isabel Linares still wants to learn how to become a better business leader.
Linares and 14 others came to campus for the first time Thursday for the GW School of Business’ “On the Board” fellowship program, which offers intensive training sessions in corporate responsibility, finance and leadership skills needed to serve on corporate boards.
“I think its important that, when we do reach a management position, we ought to give ladders for other women to come up,” Linares said. “It’s not always this way, but I think that little by little, women have to help women.”
The program, also coordinated by the International Women’s Forum, selected 15 inaugural fellows out of hundreds of applicants. It will help fill a void of top female business leaders nationally, with females comprising just 16.6 percent of corporate board members at Fortune 500 companes, according to Catalyst, an organization that advocates for women in business.
Penny McIntyre, a student and president of Newell Consumer Group, said when she was stopped from “grabbing the gold ring” at several points in her career, she realized it was a gender issue – not a personal one.
The program, announced last summer, stemmed from a large gift by University trustee Linda Rabbitt, founder and CEO of Rand Construction.
Rabbitt was one of 11 corporate leaders recognized by the Washington Business Journal for exemplary service on corporate boards – and one of only two women honored.
“I decided something needed to be done – to alter the landscape, to change the conversation and to finally move the needle,” Rabbitt said. “That needle of 16 percent female participation on corporate boards hadn’t moved in over a decade. And it was that evening [that] I decided to be part of the solution.”
Similar programs at Harvard, Stanford and Northwestern universities also look to advance women as corporate leaders.

Massoud Adibpour knows that nobody likes Mondays.
But with an arsenal of cardboard signs adorned with positive messages like, “don’t be so hard on yourself” and “smile,” he’s determined to change that.
Adibpour, the 29-year-old founder of Make D.C. Smile, spends his Monday mornings standing with friends on 14th Street during peak traffic hours, holding signs bearing optimistic messages to commuters.
“The first minute was crazy. It was just super intimidating – going out there and letting people judge for themselves,” Adibpour said. “I was like, maybe we should just bail on this thing. But after a while, some people just started honking. It’s just one of those things where one person honks and another is like, ‘Oh, okay, I’ll honk too.’ ”
Now, signs throughout Columbia Heights and an interactive, mobile “What Makes Me Smile” wall – reminiscent of GW’s own “Before I Die” wall in Kogan Plaza – offer individuals an opportunity to write positive messages.
Community members are also encouraged to write about what makes them smile on individual chalkboards, a visual movement chronicled on the organization’s Facebook page. Adibpour, who also works at the 9:30 Club, said he plans to take one picture each day and make a video compiling all the images at the end of the year.
Sophomore Emily Hirsch, a member of Make D.C. Smile, said the project challenged her to think about what truly makes her happy. Hirsch said the movement’s message is crucial in what she called a world dominated by pessimism.
“I think Make D.C. Smile is really important, because it’s reminding people to focus on optimism and encouraging each other. We could use as much of that as possible,” Hirsch said.
In her photo, she holds a sign which says that making other people smile makes her smile.
Adibpour’s act of kindness has parlayed into massive media recognition, garnering more than 1,700 “likes” on Facebook and an interview on the Jeff Probst Show.
Upon hearing of the project, Sophia Pink, a sophomore at Washington International High School, created a documentary on the movement called “Honk If You Love Someone.” The title is drawn from a message frequently scrawled on Adibpour’s posters.
Pink joined Adibpour and his fellow sign holders on K Street one Monday morning after making the documentary, feeling compelled to further spread the message.
“I hoped that making a documentary about Massoud and his awesome project would encourage people to think about the ways they could do small things to make other people’s lives a little better,” Pink said. “It’s easy to get caught in the dreariness of day-to-day life. A simple kind action can have a much greater effect than you expect.”
Adibpour hopes to expand his brainchild into a nonprofit that plasters positive messages on billboards and ads on the Metro. After receiving emails from interested people in Norway, Portugal and countries in the Middle East, Adibpour plans to translate the signs into different languages.
“The way I look at it is, if you change one person’s day, the entire mission is accomplished,” Adibpour said.
