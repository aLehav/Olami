The crash comes two weeks after cyclist Shawn O'Donnell died when the driver of a construction vehicle struck and killed her a few blocks north at the corner of 21st and I streets.
Updated Aug. 5, 2022 at 3:34 p.m.
A pedestrian died near campus Wednesday after a driver struck him along Virginia Avenue Wednesday, marking the second traffic death in Foggy Bottom in less than a month.
MPD spokesperson Brianna Burch said the crash took place on the 2100 block of Virginia Avenue, located near the CVS by the southern end of the Foggy Bottom Campus. She said the pedestrian, an adult man, was pronounced dead in hospital care after MPD officers found him unconscious and not breathing at the scene at 4:11 p.m.
The man appeared to be crossing the street when he was struck, but it was unclear whether he was crossing at an intersection, according to a Washington Post report.
The crash comes two weeks after cyclist Shawn O’Donnell died when the driver of a construction vehicle struck and killed her a few blocks north at the corner of 21st and I streets.
D.C. lawmakers are looking for answers to what has been a nonstop trend of traffic fatalities in the District. The D.C. Council’s transportation committee approved legislation last month that would prohibit vehicles from making right turns on red lights and allow bikers to treat stop signs as yield signs.

The group seeks $10 million, $2.5 million each, in damages due to alleged discriminatory practices that limited their pay and promotions.
A group of Black women firefighters filed a race and gender discrimination lawsuit against D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services in U.S. District Court Monday.
The firefighters, Jadonna Sanders, Shalonda Smith, Takeva Thomas and Bolatito Ajose, accuse D.C. FEMS of being “a hostile work environment for Black women firefighters” and “maintaining a custom, pattern and practice of disfavoring Black women firefighters.” The group seeks $10 million, $2.5 million each, in damages due to alleged discriminatory practices that limited their pay and promotions.
“This case is about systemic characteristics of D.C. FEMS that turn it into a “boys club” in which Black women are tolerated, but not embraced or treated as equals, and in which Black women always have to beg, scrape and fight just to be treated fairly,” civil rights attorney Pam Keith, who is representing the women, told WJLA.
Keith also filed similar lawsuits on behalf of a group of Black female police officers alleging discrimination on the basis of race and gender against the Metropolitan Police Department last December.
The four women are all certified paramedics and former or current members of FEMS’ Fire Prevention Division and have each been with the department from 10 to 21 years.
“I haven’t seen the lawsuit and will not comment on any pending litigation, but what I can say is the department has a history – and a recent history, very positive – of hiring women, promoting women,” FEMS Chief John Donnelly Sr. told WJLA.
Ajose said throughout her long experience working for FEMS, she faced consistent discrimination on the basis of race and gender.
“It’s been 21 years, and there’s always something that is unfair as it relates to just being a woman or a brown woman in fire services,” Ajose said to local news station WTOP.

While the crust was Napolitano style, paper-like thin, the dough was the perfect balance of flaky and chewy, with an oily consistency between the cheese and the toppings.
Vintage posters and Italian jerseys paying homage to the game of soccer hang over the fumes of freshly-baked pizza at In Bocca al Lupo, the new Glover Park pizzeria bustling with families eager for an authentic Italian experience.
In Bocca al Lupo delves into classic Italian cuisine, separating itself from the typical American pizzeria – while you won’t find traditional pepperoni and cheese offerings on their own, the restaurant delivers authenticity with family recipes and wood-fired ovens. Drawing inspiration from his origins, Fulvio De Rosa – a Roman award-winning pizza chef – serves his country’s traditional delicacies, including variations of pizze bianche, white sauce pizza and fritto, fried rice balls stuffed with cheese and sausage.
Located on Wisconsin Avenue, the Roman pizzeria is a 45-minute uphill walk from campus to Glover Park, replacing the previous neighborhood pizza spot, Arcuri, earlier this year. Aside from the restaurant’s more distant location and later hours – it opens at 5 p.m. on weekdays instead of noon like several other local pizzerias – the family-style dining experience and the Roman inspired menu is worth battling D.C.’s summer heat.
In Bocca al Lupo – Italian for “into the wolf’s mouth,” or a way to wish good luck – first opened its indoor seating in July seven months after its grand opening, operating solely through takeout until the interior design was completely finished.
The restaurant’s commitment to the soccer theme makes the owner’s ties to Rome as clear as can be. A large poster montage of Italian soccer players, jerseys honoring their names and the soccer matches televised behind the bar make it the perfect spot for fanatics of the game
The authenticity of the restaurant’s history and background is not lost on its food. The menu offers 15 different pizzas, some with white and some with red sauce. Each pizza ranges from $11 to $18 depending on the amount of toppings baked on top. While the appetizers on the menu are typical Italian plates – like bruschetta, caprese and aglio olio – the Roman pizzeria also offers fritto, a uniquely Roman delicacy consisting of a fried rice ball with cheese and sausage inside. The salad and rice balls are priced under $7.
The pizza is cooked pomodoro, a vital technique that Italian chefs use to time the rotation of their pizza to create the signature Roman crust that is light and airy, almost cracker-like. In line with Roman fashion, the restaurant’s servers and take-out boxes advise that the pizza must be eaten within 10 minutes of serving and remains uncut to preserve the oils and prevent the thin crust from wilting.
I chose the “In Bocca al Lupo” pizza – sharing the restaurant’s name for its blend of sun-dried tomatoes, salsa verde romano and mozzarella – in hopes it would induce me into the true Italian experience, drifting from my usual margarita go-to.
As promised, the pizza was served uncut, making it difficult to navigate. But one bite in, I understood why the Romans had continued this tradition. While the crust was Napolitano style, paper-like thin, the dough was the perfect balance of flaky and chewy, with an oily consistency between the cheese and the toppings.
The wide variation of toppings made me reluctant at first, but the tanginess of the sun-dried tomatoes with the mildness of mozzarella combined for a perfect pairing. The blend is further complemented by the salsa verde, made out of tomatillo, cilantro and lime juice. The salsa verde was an unusual addition to a pizza but provided a liquid garnish across the red sauce. Its lime flavor brings out the freshness of the ingredients.
Make sure to eat the pizza fresh out of the oven the thin crust leaves the bottom of the pizza soggy after about 20 minutes. While the crust may seem flimsy to those who are fans of more traditional, east coast pizza, the overload of mozzarella and sundried tomato makes the overall greasy experience worthwhile.
In Bocca al Lupo has brought about my new found love for Roman-style pizza, and with the new neighborhood pizzeria fully open, the fresh ingredients and soccer fandom make this new spot the vital stop for a quick summer bite.

Confronted with mass shootings across the country and an uptick in gun-related crimes in D.C this year, GW has joined local universities and colleges to find solutions to gun violence. The Consortium of Universities of the Washington Metropolitan Area, a group that includes GW among other D.C. schools, created the 120 Initiative last month to research and recommend tangible steps to reduce gun violence. While GW’s commitment to the initiative is admirable, it can only do so much to keep us safe. We don’t need a research project – we need immediate change.
The 120 Initiative will take six months to deliver its findings, but to save time, money and, most importantly, lives, it should revise its approach. If roughly 120 Americans die every day from gun violence, hence the organization’s name, then more than 20,000 Americans will die from gun violence before the group publishes its findings. There’s no time to lose – rather than brainstorm new solutions to gun violence, let’s implement policies we already know can make an impact. The 120 Initiative would be more beneficial if it funded or advocated for violence prevention programs and other policies that have already proven effective.
Stricter gun laws in D.C. and across the country can prevent these horrific acts of gun violence. While regulations vary in type and severity from state to state, there’s a correlation between stricter gun laws and lower rates of gun-related deaths. According to the gun violence prevention advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety, tightly-regulated Hawaii has one of the lowest rates of gun deaths in the country, while Mississippi has the weakest gun laws and the highest rate of gun deaths in the nation. But states can only do so much to control firearms within their borders, especially when surrounding states impose little to no regulations. Take Illinois as an example – though it strictly regulates guns, firearms purchased in loosely-regulated Indiana have wound up at crime scenes in Chicago. State regulations work, but it’ll take truly transformative federal policy to undo these loopholes.
Looking at the United States as a whole, gun homicides are significantly higher here than in the rest of the world. Why is that? While gun violence has become commonplace in America, some countries have clamped down hard on gun ownership in the wake of tragic mass shootings. Twenty years ago, a mass shooting killed 35 people in Australia, and the Australian government instituted a massive gun buyback program to buy and destroy weapons – since then, it avoided the sheer death tolls that American mass shootings have racked up at grocery stores, schools and parades in the United States. Japan, which has about 10 shooting deaths per year, requires its citizens to complete a rigorous set of checks that include attending an all-day class, passing a written test and achieving at least 95 percent accuracy during a shooting range test before they can own a gun.
Even our typically gridlocked, out-of-touch Congress was able to pass bipartisan gun legislation one month after the May 24 shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas. But although it’s the first gun control measure to come out of Congress in nearly three decades, this bill is only moderately effective while states still differ drastically in firearm regulations. Nor should it take tragedy after tragedy and immense public pressure to catch legislators’ attention – more than half of Americans think we need stricter laws on firearms sales, according to a June 2022 Gallup poll. Americans are frustrated that we’re still here, and they’re tired of their grief and anger falling on the ears of apathetic lawmakers who trot out the same lines after every tragedy.
With numerous proven solutions to gun violence staring us in the face, it’s clear that we already know what to do – now we just have to do it. There are only so many solutions that more research can find. The 120 Initiative doesn’t need to spend its time coming up with new ideas to reduce gun violence. It should shift its focus to demanding immediate policy change through its influence. Requiring universal background checks or banning privately-made, untraceable “ghost guns” would reduce gun violence. While these universities are rightfully concerned about appearing overtly “political,” they’ll have to take a public stance if they’re really dedicated to reducing gun violence. Engaging experts and floating solutions can only go so far.
If the initiative wants to make real change outside the halls of Capitol Hill, it could support violence prevention programs for at-risk communities. A study by the National Institute for Criminal Justice Reform found that roughly 500 people are responsible for as much as 70 percent of D.C.’s gun violence, with about 200 people behind the city’s homicides and shootings. The District’s recently-launched Violence Prevention Program targets these individuals to stop shootings before they start – bolstered by the 120 Initiative’s resources, influential figures and thousands of students, it could improve the safety of the city.
The leaders of D.C.’s colleges and universities are taking gun violence seriously. While that’s more than can be said of many of our elected officials, the 120 Initiative’s goals are still misguided. We don’t need “thoughts and prayers” and empty promises, nor do we need months and months of research and analysis – gun violence is neither inevitable nor unsolvable, but the clock is ticking. Let’s act now.

From creating safer and more efficient transportation to revising GW’s COVID-19 isolation policy, everyone from city officials to University leaders is searching for solutions in this week’s headlines. But for every step forward this week, there seems to be at least one step backward.
An electrical fire and widespread delays are overshadowing new Metro General Manager Randy Clarke’s plans to improve service. Above ground, the D.C. Council’s transportation committee has approved legislation that would make walking and cycling in the city safer.
But as traffic fatalities continue to mount in the District, the deaths of an alumna in a car crash in Indiana and a pedestrian struck by a driver on Virginia Avenue remind us that D.C.’s and the country’s streets and roads are as dangerous as ever. And while GW’s new “isolate in place” policy may beat roughing it in a hotel room, there’s still cause for concern.
Here’s the best and worst of this week’s headlines:
Thumbs Up: 
Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority General Manager Randy Clarke started his role last week with a trip from Metro’s Foggy Bottom station. Clarke’s entry also delivered some positive news – shorter wait times on the Blue, Orange and Silver lines with more rail cars, including the 7000-series, returning to service.
Clarke may want to put WMATA back on track, but he’s playing whack-a-mole – as soon as Metro makes marginal improvements, there’s an embarrassing failure somewhere else. An electrical fire in a train tunnel Saturday caused a temporary service shutdown on the Red Line, and a network issue that prevented operators from accurately tracking trains gave way to even more service delays across all lines Wednesday.
Good luck, Mr. Clarke – you’ll need it.
Moving from mass transit to personal transit, the D.C. Council’s transportation committee approved the Safer Streets Amendment Act of 2022 last month, one week before the driver of a Mack truck struck and killed Shawn O’Donnell – the 21st person killed in a traffic accident this year so far – while she was biking at the intersection of I and 21st streets. The act would prevent drivers from turning right on red lights at most intersections and allow bicyclists to treat stop signs as yield signs rather than coming to a complete stop, reducing the chance of a collision between all road users.
Thumbs Down: 
Just two weeks after O’Donnell was killed, two people have died in vehicle collisions both literally and figuratively close to GW’s community. The driver of a car struck and killed an unnamed male pedestrian at the intersection of E Street and Virginia Avenue Wednesday, bringing D.C.’s total traffic fatalities to 22 this year. In Indiana, 28-year-old Emma Thomson, a School of Media and Public Affairs alumna and communications director for Rep. Jackie Walorski, R-Ind., was one of four people to die Wednesday in a car crash that also killed Walorski.
Though hundreds of miles apart, the tragic loss of the male pedestrian and Thomson are part of the same public health crisis – our streets and roads are killing us. From 2019 to 2021, the number of traffic fatalities jumped from 27 to 40 in D.C. Over the same period, nationwide traffic fatalities rose from 36,096  to 42,915. If we want to save lives, it’s going to take more than reviewing the rules of the road – we have to dramatically rethink who and what our streets and the vehicles on them are for.
Regarding another health crisis, officials announced in an email Tuesday that GW will institute an “isolation in place” policy for residential students with COVID-19 this academic year. That’s a marked departure from its previous policy of isolating sick students in other residence halls or nearby hotels last year to prevent the spread of the virus.
Talking about isolating with your roommate like you would with washing dishes or taking out the trash is almost as hilarious as it is contagious. But on a more serious note, this policy change is an indication that we’ve entered the “you figure it out” phase of endemic COVID-19 at GW even as the virus continues to spread and reinfect people across the country. And while that may be a cause for celebration among some members of the University community, it’s giving me a sense of dread – by definition, public health isn’t a private matter.

The spot is located along the Mount Vernon Trail, just feet away from the end of the Reagan National Airport runway. Look up and watch the planes swoop to their nearby and deafening landing just overhead.
As summer draws to a close, check these items off your summer bucket list before falling victim to the stress of school-year preparation.
Cool off with a sweet treat, cheer on the Nationals, picnic at an outdoor concert, belt out your favorite song at karaoke and add to your dorm decor with hand painted pottery all before summer ends.
National Mall ice cream 
Nothing is more refreshing on a scorching summer day than a tall cone of ice cream, and what’s better than a breathtaking view of the nation’s capital while you’re at it? Head down to the National Mall to indulge in a soft serve treat. The food trucks that line the National Mall are nothing new, but many GW students have never purchased a sweet desert there. The goal of the experience is less about the quality and more about taking in the beauty of the location with a summer treat in hand, so try out one of the classic flavors offered at the trucks, like chocolate and vanilla swirl. Lick your ice cream before it melts down the cone while gazing at your choice of the illuminated Capitol building or the outline of the Lincoln Memorial as the sun sets behind the hills of Arlington National Cemetery.
Washington Nationals game
Summer is primetime for baseball, so grab some friends and some Nationals gear and head to the ballpark. While the Nationals do play in the earlier parts of the fall, there’s nothing quite like a summer game without the distractions of looming homework and classes. Indulge in classic ballgame snacks like hotdogs, popcorn, hot pretzels and cotton candy while sitting back and watching nine innings of America’s pastime. Though the Nationals lag in the standings and traded away their star slugger Juan Soto, the lively atmosphere of Nationals Park will be an experience to remember, win or lose.
Wolf Trap outdoor concert
Wolf Trap is an outdoor concert venue outside of Vienna that makes for the perfect spot to enjoy a picnic and live music. The venue allows visitors to bring their own food and drink, so pack a large picnic blanket, your favorite snacks and even a bottle of wine to enjoy with your show. Wolf Trap is a large outdoor amphitheater with multiple levels of seating layered into the national park setting. The venue hosts several concerts through August, including Little Big Town and a special Abba-themed show. Check out the list of concerts to find one that speaks to you.
Hill Country karaoke
Hill Country hosts live band karaoke every Wednesday night where you and your friends can put your musical skills to the test. The karaoke bar comes alongside a restaurant that specializes in Texas Barbecue, so get a group together to indulge in some traditional meaty delicacies before hitting the stage. The karaoke happens in the basement of the venue, with a live band backing up the rotating performers’ vocals. Decide on a classic song and hit the stage as a group, or if you’re really feeling yourself, then go solo to give the crowd a performance they won’t forget. The venue also has a full bar in the back of the floor, so no worries if you need a few rounds of drinks before hitting the stage.
Pottery painting
Create artistic pieces to add to your residence hall room or apartment this fall at All Fired Up, a paint-your-own pottery shop. The pottery painting venue also holds themed nights through August, like trivia, jazz and classical music nights to keep customers entertained while they paint. Bring your friends, or better yet, future roommates with you, and paint mugs, plates, bowls and vases that can be used and displayed in your shared space this fall. If you are looking to spice up your experience, try rotating the piece you are working on every 10 minutes with a friend to allow for some artistic collaboration and a little bit of a challenge.
Gravelly Point
Get active outdoors with a walk, run or bike ride to Gravelly Point. The spot is located along the Mount Vernon Trail, just feet away from the end of the runway at Reagan National Airport. Look up and watch the planes swoop to their nearby and deafening landing just overhead. Enjoy the green space and play frisbee or catch with friends. Or recline on a blanket and have a picnic on a hot summer day. No matter how you spend your time, the park is one of its kind where flocks of locals can savor the waning days of summer.

The Safer Streets Amendment Act of 2022 prohibits vehicles making right turn on red lights and allows bikers to treat stop signs as yield signs.
The D.C. Council’s transportation committee approved an act to make walking and cycling in D.C. safer last month.
The Safer Streets Amendment Act of 2022 would prohibit vehicles from making right turns on red lights and allow bikers to treat stop signs as yield signs. The legislation came one week before cyclist Shawn O’Donnell was struck and killed in the 21st and I Street intersection by a Mack truck last month.
D.C. Council member Mary M. Cheh, chairwomen of the transportation committee, asked for the bill to be on the Council’s September agenda when they reconvene.
“This bill takes several important steps to reprioritize streets for people over cars and increase traffic safety for all, no matter how you get around the District,” Cheh told the Washington Post.
The Safer Streets Act was originally introduced by Council members in early February but went through public hearings and markups before the transportation committee recommended approval from the Council.
The truck struck O’Donnell, a State Department employee, when the driver tried turning right onto I Street from 21st Street while she was cycling alongside the truck. She was then transported to a local hospital where she was pronounced dead after all life-saving efforts failed.
Mayor Muriel Bowser prohibited right-on-red in 100 intersections in D.C. whereas the Safer Streets Act prohibits right-on-red in all intersections except where the District Department of Transportation finds right-on-red to be safer.
The bill allows cyclists to treat stop signs as yield signs, moves bikers through intersections quicker, allows bikers to keep their momentum and clarifies when bikers have the right of way.

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., and Sen. Rob Portman, R-Oh., called for gun control, mental health support and increased border security at Monday's debate.
Two U.S. Senators debated the economy, gun safety, the border and individual liberty at the Jack Morton Auditorium Monday.
Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., and Sen. Rob Portman, R-Oh., called for gun control, mental health support and increased border security. The Bipartisan Policy Center hosted the debate that was moderated by CBS News congressional correspondent Nikole Killian and broadcasted on C-SPAN.
Jason Grumet, the president of the Bipartisan Policy Center, said he hoped to accomplish something “rudimentary and exotic” through the debate and that the debate would spark discourse crucial to “representative democracy.”
“We think that dignifying differences is the first step to actually moving the conversation forwards,” he said. “We want to try to identify whether there are some key factual issues that are the basis of different positions that require and deserve some exploration.”
Democrats proposed a climate, tax and energy bill earlier this week that would place a 15 percent minimum tax on U.S. companies and reallocate some of the collected tax revenue to cheaper energy investments after inflation hit a 40-year record-high in June, up 9.1 percent this year.
Portman said there were already supply issues relating to the pandemic, as workers were in lockdown instead of producing goods and shipments were delayed. He said corporate minimum tax and the corresponding price hikes only worsened these issues.
“Manufacturers will be hit the hardest by this,” he said.
Murphy said this week that the Senate reviewed the Inflation Reduction Act, which reduces healthcare costs for seniors and caps maximum out-of-pocket spending at $2,000. He also agreed with Portman that the pandemic caused supply chain issues that negatively affected the global economy.
“We have wages growing, inequality shrinking, fewer kids in poverty than any time in recent memory,” he said. “On the other side, there’s no doubt that costs are increasing, that inflation has been a consequence of a fast-growing economy.”
Portman responded by presenting the recently passed CHIPS Plus Act as a means of helping U.S. manufacturers. He argued the U.S.’s 0.9% decrease in economic growth is due to a lack of investment.
In the next debate on gun safety, Murphy advocated for universal background checks and banning “weapons of war” for private citizens.
“No matter what your zip code is, you can wake up and have your life fundamentally transformed by a mass shooting, by a suicide, by a homicide, by an accidental shooting,” Murphy said. “And it is not a coincidence that the rate of murder, the rate of mass shootings has increased in this country as these dangerous weapons have proliferated all over the nation.
Portman said that the most important part of the recently passed Bipartisan Safer Communities Act is the mental health provisions. He said there are 17 gangs in Columbus, Ohio, and they make up 46% of the homicides.
The Supreme Court’s recent overturning of Roe v. Wade brought on public outrage and calls for Congress to write new laws cementing the right to abortion. Congress is also looking to protect other rights currently susceptible to being overturned by the Supreme Court, such as the right to contraception, same-sex marriage and interracial marriage.
Murphy said deciding when to have a child is “the most personal choice.” He said abortion is “the last subject” the government should dictate.
“My belief is that this is a time where we need to step up as a body for the basic idea of personal liberty and freedom, something that Republicans talk a lot about as well as Democrats.”
Portman said Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the case that overturned Roe v. Wade, only relates to abortion. He said most Americans support limiting abortion to the first 15 weeks of pregnancy.
Murphy responded that the timeline on when to get an abortion should be a personal decision. He said he hopes to pass the Respect for Marriage Act, which protects same-sex and interracial marriage, by the end of this congressional session.
“Given how personal this issue is, there’s really nothing more personal than this decision of when to proceed with a pregnancy,” he said.
Portman said he supports the Respect for Marriage Act, although it was “not exactly” how he would have written it. He said he has a duty to help his constituents and “move the process forward.”
When asked about Justice Clarence Thomas withdrawing from GW Law in a press conference after the debate, Murphy did not immediately have a comment. Portman said he hoped Thomas withdrew voluntarily and was not asked to withdraw.
“I think it’s good that universities allow all kinds of opinions to be expressed,” he said.

Emma Thomson, an alumna and the communications director for Rep. Jackie Walorski, R-Ind., was one of four people to die Wednesday in a Northern Indiana car crash that also killed Walorski. She was 28.
The driver of another vehicle crossed the center line and caused the head-on collision with the vehicle carrying Thomson, Walorski and Zachery Potts – another of Walorski’s aides – killing all four people involved, according to the Elkhart County Sheriff’s Office. Thomson graduated with a degree in political communications in 2016 and began working as Walorski’s communications director in July of last year, according to her LegiStorm profile.
The School of Media and Public Affairs tweeted that they were “heartbroken” by the death of Thomson.
“Emma was a wonderful person and we will miss her dearly,” they said in a Tweet. “We send our condolences to her family and friends and all those involved in this tragic accident.”
In her final year at GW, Thomson served as a press assistant for Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., during his 2016 presidential campaign. She then served as communications director for Rep. Michael C. Burgess, R-Texas., from 2017 to 2019, and Rep. John Joyce, R-Pa., from 2019 to 2021, where she also served as campaign manager for Joyce’s successful 2020 election campaign.
“Today Emma Thomson who did an amazing job on my 2016 Presidential campaign lost her life in an auto accident in Indiana,” Rubio said in a tweet. “She was a smart & talented communicator and an amazing young woman.”
Walorski, who was 58, represented Indiana’s second congressional district since 2013, and served on the House Ethics Committee. Originally from South Bend, Indiana, she previously worked as a missionary and as a journalist.
“Dean Swihart, Jackie’s husband, was just informed by the Elkhart County Sheriff’s Office that Jackie was killed in a car accident this afternoon,” a release from Walorski’s office states. “She has returned home to be with her Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.”
Potts, an alum of Indiana University, had worked with Walorski since 2015, and had been Walorski’s district director since 2020. Potts also served as the chair of the St. Joseph County Republican Party.

Residence halls are no longer considered high-risk areas because college-aged people are unlikely to contract a severe case of COVID-19 when vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
GW will institute an “isolation in place” protocol for residential students who test positive for COVID-19 during the 2022-23 academic year officials announced in an email to residential students Tuesday.
Stewart Robinette, the assistant dean of students for residential education, and Rebekka Christie, the director of medical services at the Student Health Center, said the University will not move residential students who test positive for COVID-19 or whose roommates test positive for COVID-19 to a separate isolation space this upcoming academic year. The new protocol comes after officials required students who tested positive for COVID-19 to isolate for a minimum of 5 days in either their dorm or a nearby hotel during the last academic year.
“While we don’t want anyone to get sick, the likelihood of it happening is still high, whether it is a cold, flu, COVID or something else,” they said. “We encourage you to have conversations now with your roommate/s and family members about what to do if and when you or a roommate becomes ill.”
They said the University adjusted its protocols for the upcoming academic year in line with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which states that residence halls are no longer considered high-risk areas because college-aged people are unlikely to contract a severe case of COVID-19 when vaccinated.
The University reserved beds in Yours Truly, a hotel located north of Washington Circle, last spring to house students infected with COVID-19 due to a surge in cases driven by the omicron variant. Officials also shortened the isolation period for students who test positive for COVID-19 from 10 days to five, per CDC guidelines in the spring and officials ended the asymptomatic COVID-19 testing requirement for community members last month.
United States residents are also amid a new wave of COVID-19 infections due to the omicron subvariant BA.5, which experts said is the most transmissible version of the virus that can reinfect people who tested positive just a few weeks prior, according to the New York Times.
“If you are a residential student who has a GW approved COVID-19 vaccine exemption for medical or religious reasons, or if you are immunocompromised, and you have medical questions about interacting with someone who may be sick, please reach out to GW’s Student Health Center or your primary care physician,” they said in the email.
