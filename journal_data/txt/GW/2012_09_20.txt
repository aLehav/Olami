Senior gymnast Deja Chambliss said Simone Biles' recent public advocacy for mental health has been empowering for other gymnasts.
As the COVID-19 pandemic surged through the nation, student-athletes were forced to confront a new reality as their mental health suffered.
Student-athletes at GW said the pandemic caused their mental health to decline as they felt removed from the college environment and struggled to find a balance between their academics, athletics and personal lives. They said the athletic department provided support for their mental health throughout the pandemic, encouraging them to meet with mental health professionals and lean on each other for support.
Senior women’s basketball guard Maddie Loder said she experienced a “straining” semester as she struggled to compartmentalize her emotions about the pandemic. She said she felt she placed her value on how well she was performing instead of her how she adjusted during the season.
“That felt very dehumanizing and very, bringing us down to a point where it was like, we were playing basketball, we were going to class and we were lying in bed,” she said.
She said the pandemic was the backdrop of a “brutal” season for her, as she was unable to maintain her regular schedule due to the social distancing mandated health guidelines. She said the team felt lucky to be competing given the conditions of the pandemic but felt she had a “minuscule” role to play during the season.
In May, the NCAA released a survey showing a 150-to-250 percent increase in student-athlete concerns over mental health. About one in 10 students reported feeling depression symptoms that did not allow them to carry on a regular day.
A study by Drexel and Kean universities showed that 23.7 percent of college-level student-athletes reported clinically significant levels of depressive symptoms. In the study female athletes were almost twice as likely to show clinically relevant symptoms compared to male athletes.
Loder currently leads GW’s chapter of Hidden Opponent, an organization that seeks to empower students to talk about their mental health. She said organizations like this have begun to gain popularity as professional athletes like Naomi Osaka and Simon Biles have led the way for athletes addressing mental health.
“The field female student-athletes will feel more empowered to really say how they’re feeling because when you look at Simone Biles, who is the greatest of all time, in her respective sport, people can be like ‘I know I’m not as great as Simone Biles, but if she feels this way, it’s OK for me to feel this way at whatever level I’m not,’” Loder said. “And so I’m at least hopeful that that will open more doors for people to be more honest about their feelings.”
Senior gymnast Deja Chambliss said the pandemic made it difficult for her to maintain a work-life balance, adding another stressor to her life. She said adapting to a team mentality allowed team members to put their challenges into perspective and see they were not alone.
Chambliss said the athletics department enlisted professional sports psychologists as a resource for many of the student-athletes. She said head coach Margie Foster-Cunningham emphasizes gymnastics as a safe space for her team, focusing on breathing exercises to help them concentrate before the meets to help them relax.
“It’s focused on diaphragmatic breathing, to get your breathing in check, your mind in check before you have up on the beam to do your stuff, like nerves, their thing, and I’m not gonna say that they aren’t,” Chambliss said. “But when you focus on your breathing, and you kind of get your brain in the right mindset to get up and go, it’s a lot, it works a lot better for you.”
Chambliss said the movement Biles created for mental health was empowering because gymnasts are typically taught to “do as told” without prioritizing their own health and safety.
“That was an empowering thing for her to say, ‘Hey, I’m not in the right mental state. I have to put myself first even if that means putting my team second, but I think she put herself and her priorities first, and she did what she needed to do,” Chambliss said.
Junior gymnast Hannah Munnelly said mental toughness and adaptability were vital for the season to help team members adjust to the new changes in protocol. She said she had trouble adjusting to online classes and facing the health uncertainties, like the possibility of outbreaks during meets, that arose during the season.
Munnelly said the department encourages them to communicate instead of “suffering in silence,” to work on finding the routine that’s best for them. She said organizing her daily schedule helps her keep her student and athlete life separate, allowing her to compartmentalize as much as possible to focus on one thing at a time.
“You’re not panicking while you’re up there because then after all those hours of training and all those routines that you’re done, by the time you get up there to compete, it’s just automatic,” she said.

Enrollment in the Russian language program has fallen 40 percent since the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences dropped its foreign language curriculum requirement last fall.
The dwindling enrollment brings the program dangerously close to eliminating class sections and part-time teaching positions, Russian language program director Richard Robin said.
“Our big fear is a cut in the number of sections, because we’d lose good teachers,” he said. “We have so far not had to close any sections, but we’re teetering on the brink.”
In just the last year, 20 percent fewer students have opted to take Russian, which counted about 107 students in its 11 class sections this fall.
Columbian College faculty approved a new general curriculum – dubbed G-PAC – two years ago, which stripped a foreign language requirement and barred most beginning language courses from its general requirement list. Administrators said then that introductory foreign language courses entail memorization rather than critical thinking.
Robin said the program has tried to promote itself, putting up posters in the Academic Center during the spring and courting incoming freshmen during Colonial Inauguration.
The director is one of two full-time professors in the Russian language program, and said Russian professors across the country have noticed that enrollment also fluctuates with the country’s presence in international headlines.
He said he thinks enrollment could have slumped even lower this year, but news that spread about Russian punk band Pussy Riot – which protested the country’s President Vladimir Putin – piqued some students’ interest in the language.
“When Russian disappears from the front pages, we lose enrollments,” he said.
Only freshmen and sophomores in Columbian College follow the G-PAC curriculum that went into effect last fall – decreasing the number of general credits from 42 to 24. The Elliott School of International Affairs and some majors in Columbian College, like history, still require a foreign language.
The impact of G-PACs on other smaller language programs at GW has varied. The Arabic program added a major and a minor this fall, a response to growing interest in the language.
Margaret Gonglewski, director of the German program, said she hasn’t seen “any dramatic change” in enrollments so far, but said that could change once the new curriculum is in place for all incoming students beginning fall 2014.
Young-Key Kim-Renaud, chair of the department of East Asian languages and literature, said enrollments in Japanese, Chinese and Korean have remained stable because of the popularity of the region.
But the Spanish and French language programs, which both had waitlists of about 100 students this fall, cannot keep up with student demand.
Both program directors said they have been limited by a lack of classroom space and new hires.
“I think all the language programs and departments are just trying to make the case with administration that we need to meet more resources, that we want to convert our part-time faculty into full-time faculty instructors,” Maria de la Fuente, director of the Spanish program said.
Peg Barratt, who is in her final year as Columbian College dean, said the college met the demand for language courses when she arrived in 2007 and “more than a million dollars was invested in new positions for teaching languages.”
Now, with foreign students flocking to the University and an emphasis on globalization in the upcoming academic strategic plan, Barratt said she expects more money to funnel into languages.

The University’s full-time, two-year MBA program counted a 15 percent rise in applications last week as overall applicants to graduate business schools dropped for the fourth straight year.
The increase in popularity for the business school’s Global MBA program came in a year when similar MBA programs at Duke, Yale, Michigan State and Indiana universities reported falls in application numbers between 7 and 21 percent.
Fifty-four percent of programs across the country reported a decline, with the Graduate Management Admission Council reporting a median drop of 22 percent.
The bump brings GW almost back from the school’s lagging application year between 2010 and 2011, when it fell by one-third in just a year. Last fall’s global MBA class included 119 students.
Liesl Riddle, associate dean for GW’s MBA programs, attributed GW’s wider applicant pool to its broad range of academic offerings like entrepreneurship and international management, which go beyond a traditional Wall Street-focused MBA.
“I think that, in many ways, these sort of cross-cutting themes helps GW School of Business appeal to a broader audience and, in many ways, might have helped us as we’ve gone through this moment of economic challenge and turbulence,” she said.
The MBA program was ranked No. 52 in the country by Bloomberg Businessweek and No. 79 internationally by the Financial Times.
The business school’s graduate and professional emphasis has been a main focus for Doug Guthrie in his third year as dean. He has said the school could make its mark internationally by offering specialized education for business leaders, and by adding programs that mix business with a social consciousness.
This fall’s MBA class comes from 18 different countries, Riddle said, part of an effort to raise the diversity levels of the program.
Students at many of the top schools that saw drops in applicants are more likely to go down the tumultuous Wall Street track than are those at GW.
About 12 percent of last year’s MBA graduates at GW went into careers like those on Wall Street, compared to a program like Yale’s which sends nearly a quarter of graduates into financial services jobs.
Aaron Brachman, a senior financial associate at RBC Wealth Management, said D.C. attracts MBA candidates because it offers more jobs outside of financial services.
“Wall Street is not located in D.C., but there are regulatory agencies and other top-tier positions that are not necessarily on Wall Street,” Brachman said.
Andy Brown, a first-year professional MBA student, said the business school’s broader classroom focus likely kept student interest up as Wall Street became less alluring for students after the financial crisis.
“My classmates come from such a diverse range of jobs and industries, and the program itself gives you a very wide range of experiences outside of finance,” Brown said. “If anything, it shows how the MBA can be applied to a host of fields beyond financial institutions.”

April 2007
Taghioskoui was admitted to the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department’s Ph.D. program.
Late 2007
Montaser’s behavior became erratic and concerning, including inappropriate emails and demeaning language about Taghioskoui to other faculty.
April 2008 to January 2010
Montaser placed on administrative leave after threatening to punch Executive Vice President Lou Katz.
Summer 2008
Taghioskoui returned to Iran after suicidal thoughts caused by Montaser’s behavior. Taghioskoui fell into a state of depression.
February 2010
Taghioskoui discovered Montaser filed for a patent on one of Taghioskoui’s work, listing Montaser as the sole inventor. The University took no action following Taghioskoui’s complaints.
Spring 2011
Taghioskoui’s tried to change academic advisers but was told he would not receive his Ph.D. if he switched advisers.
June 2011
Taghioskoui discovered Montaser took credit for his work on another patent application. The University took no action against Montaser following Taghioskoui’s complaints.
January 2012
Montaser presents Taghioskoui’s research at the Winter Conference with the Office of the Vice President for Research without Taghioskoui’s consent and following a complaint by Taghioskoui.
April 2012
Taghioskoui reported
Montaser’s allegedly manipulative actions and false financial promises to the University.

A former student is suing GW for $1 million, alleging his academic adviser plagiarized his work and caused him enough emotional distress to become suicidal.
Mazdak Taghioskoui alleged in a complaint filed in D.C. Superior Court this month that professor Akbar Montaser applied for patents using his work while he was in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Ph.D. program. He said his relationship with the professor first turned sour in 2005, when he reported erratic behavior like “bizarre, inappropriate emails” and “demeaning language.”
Over the next three years, he suffered “such mental anguish” that he became suicidal, seeking help from GW’s suicide hotline and mental health services starting in 2008, according to the complaint. He said he became “extremely depressed.”
Taghioskoui, a 31-year-old from Iran, began working with Montaser when he enrolled in the chemistry master’s program in 2005, according to the documents. He met Montaser through mutual friends at the Sharif University of Technology in Iran, when the professor promised Taghioskoui full financial aid at GW.
The former student was required to work 20 hours a week to receive financial aid but was not given a full scholarship.
After earning his master’s degree, Taghioskoui enrolled as a Ph.D. candidate in 2007 and took on Montaser as his Ph.D. adviser. Montaser allegedly verbally abused Taghioskoui over the phone on weekends and early mornings and sent false and humiliating emails to faculty members about the student. Montaser also allegedly asked Taghioskoui to borrow money and a car, among several other personal requests.

  Ph.D. Lawsuit (Text)

Montaser was placed on administrative leave from April 2008 to January 2010, after threatening to punch Executive Vice President and Treasurer Lou Katz in the face, according to the complaint. During the professor’s absence, Taghioskoui alleged, the University failed to assist or communicate with him regarding graduation requirements, causing a delay.
The documents also note that Montaser’s wife contacted Taghioskoui during the absence to inform him that Montaser thought his wife was going to poison him.
Taghioskoui chronicled three counts of plagiarism after Montaser returned, ranging from February 2010 to January 2012. In the first two incidents, Montaser allegedly filed patent applications for two of Taghioskoui’s works. This year, he presented Taghioskoui’s research at a conference held by the Office of the Vice President for Research, according to the documents.
The former student claimed he notified “multiple GWU faculty and administrators” of the plagiarized work in all three scenarios, but the University repeatedly refused to investigate, leaving Taghioskoui “to suffer harm to both his academic and his business prospects.”
Taghioskoui allegedly attempted to switch academic advisers in spring 2011, but was told to drop out if he wanted to switch advisers.
Montaser also allegedly told Taghioskoui his language skills were not up to par and he “would not be able to succeed in life,” according to the documents.
The $1 million in damages would compensate for GW’s and Montaser’s negligence and Taghioskoui’s emotional distress.
“GWU’s actions were made in bad faith and with malicious intent,” the complaint reads.
Montaser declined to comment on the complaint.
When asked about the professor-student relationship and the lawsuit, University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard declined to comment, because the litigation is pending.
Taghioskoui’s attorney, James Bailey, did not return a request for comment.
The court ordered the University to respond to the complaint by Sept. 24.

The eclectic cuisine of the Fojol Brothers food truck could come to J Street, an employee said this week.
The Indian-Ethiopian-Thai fusion eatery, known for its turban and fake-mustache-wearing employees, is in talks with GW about joining the dining hall this spring.
J Street would be the first brick-and-mortar location for the “traveling culinary carnival,” which frequents H Street during lunch and dinner hours.
“The administrators, they liked the spice, they liked the flavors and we liked their flavors. So hopefully if everybody’s flavors jive well in the cooking pot, then we can get this thing served and ready to eat,” Andrew Bucket, a Fojol Brothers employee who wears a paint-splattered jumpsuit and floppy hat, and who calls himself “Nukaloo,” said Tuesday.
He added, if campus dining administrators “keep their heads high, maybe we’ll close this deal.”
Owner and founder Justin Vitarello, who goes by the name “Dingo,” declined to comment, and allowed Bucket to confirm the talks on behalf of the company.
The Fojol Brothers run three food trucks across the District, featuring food from three made-up countries.
The Merlindia truck serves tikka masala, lentils, saag paneer and other Indian dishes. The Benethiopia truck offers different vegetable and meat combinations each day which students can soak up with spongy Ethiopian bread, injera. The Volathai truck serves curries and “drunken noodles.”
The campus dining office has overhauled J Street’s options in the last two years, replacing restaurants like Chik-fil-A and Wendy’s last fall to add Sodexo venues. But since then, Sodexo was swapped in three other non-Sodexo restaurants – Aroma, Auntie Anne’s Pretzels and the Vietnamese eatery BONMi. 
The University added the Indian restaurant Aroma to J Street last spring. Dajeet Singh, the restaurant’s owner, said he has not been offered to renew his contract with GW for next semester. Singh said the J Street branch of Aroma, which has two other restaurants, will stay in business “at least for the semester.”
Singh said he wants to stay in J Street, citing strong sales and a lively customer base.
“We would love to stay there,” he said. “As long as you want us to stay, we will be there.”
Director of Campus Support Services Nancy Haaga declined to confirm the addition of a new vendor or say if any other vendors would be moved out.
“It’s our job to constantly be looking at what’s offered and what that participation is and how the students or customers are enjoying it,” Haaga said.
“Things ebb and flow,” Haaga added. “That’s the evolution to what we do.”

Lauriol Plaza, a three-story restaurant with a rooftop patio, located midway between the trendy Dupont Circle and Adams Morgan neighborhoods, is a lively place to take your friends on a weekend night.
The restaurant does not take reservations, so be prepared to grab drinks at the bar while you wait. Secure a table in advance if you are going for a birthday celebration or a big night out.
The large portions of Spanish and Latin American cuisine, friendly servers and wall-to-wall murals make Lauriol Plaza well worth the wait. Enjoy complimentary chips and spicy salsa, and be sure to try the popular chicken fajitas ($13.95) or the taco platter ($9.95).
Dishes like vegetable fajitas ($11.75), the sunshine salad ($12.95) and two varieties of vegetarian quesadillas offer veg-heads the opportunity to taste the flavors of Lauriol Plaza as well.
Those looking for traditional Spanish-style seafood can try the Paella Marinera dish ($18.95), which features a generous helping of scallops, shrimp, fish, squid, mussels and clams for a full savory experience.
The extra-large portions are ideal for sharing – which means you’ll also save some cash.
For the over-21 set, try a few margarita pitchers ($31.95) for the table, which can be ordered on the rocks or frozen and strawberry-flavored or swirled. For something less filling but just as playful, order a pitcher of red or white sangria ($9.95 for a half pitcher and $19.95 for a full).
Even for underage folk, the great food and buzzing energy of this always-packed restaurant can serve as a complete night out in itself.

You can’t move on from last night without a hearty meal and conversation to hash out the details. Visit one of these classy establishments to recharge. 
Spend the night out in Adams Morgan? Return the next morning to detox over a latte and brunch at Tryst Coffeehouse.
 Unlike Mondays through Fridays, the restaurant does not offer free Wi-Fi on the weekends, so nurse your hangover with their brunch, served all day.
The options are fairly traditional, ranging from bagels with 17 topping options, to Belgian waffles, frittatas and quiches.
Besides an all-day brunch, Tryst also offers fresh sandwiches, salads, specialty coffee and tea and even a bar featuring fresh garden cocktails.
But beyond the extensive menu, Tryst’s charm lies in its atmosphere. Worn leather couches and large dining tables with mismatched chairs clutter the coffeehouse as funky music blasts from the speakers.
Occupy a plush sofa and call it home for a few hours as you linger at Tryst, but make sure to order the occasional drink or snack to keep the waiters happy.
If you feel motivated, bring study materials and stay all day – the coffeehouse is open from the crack of dawn until 3 a.m. Fridays and Saturdays, and until midnight Sundays.

You can’t move on from last night without a hearty meal and conversation to hash out the details. Visit one of these classy establishments to recharge. 
Co Co. Sala Chocolate Lounge and Boutique is a chocolate lover’s paradise, serving up a classy brunch for the morning after a not-so-classy night out.
Select a main dish and dessert off the prix-fixe menu ($26), but make sure to check the a la carte prices too, as your meal might end up being cheaper if you go that route.
For the first course, try the Cheese Magic ($12), a cheese soufflé served alongside a side salad with blue cheese, pears, walnuts and cranberries. For a sweeter option, order the French Toast S’Mores ($12), consisting of a cinnamon brioche with marshmallow, chocolate and shortbread, with banana compote and chocolate mousse on the side.
Feeling a classic hangover brunch? Get the breakfast flatbread ($16) with cheddar hash browns, chicken sausage, scrambled eggs, bacon and tomato, topped with hollandaise sauce3.
But at a so-called chocolate lounge, you simply must save room for dessert. Choose from four diverse options, like the Stolen Heart, a white chocolate and raspberry mousse ($6), or the peanut butter cheesecake ($6).
Co Co. Sala also serves brunch cocktails ($10-$13) and six varieties of hot chocolate drinks ($6).
The restaurant’s red and gold interior is sleek and modern, but still intimate, making it an ideal location to indulge with friends after a long night out.

Visit Gazuza Lounge for ambiance and hookah
With its prime location, roomy deck and comforting atmosphere in Dupont Circle, the 21+ Gazuza Lounge is the ideal for a chill night or a date night.
Food choices at Gazuza are limited to decent sushi and dessert menus, and the service is not the greatest. But what the restaurant lacks in menu quality and service, it makes up for in ambiance and hookah offerings.
On most days, a live DJ performs house and trance mixes to boost the restaurant’s mellow mood. Paired with hookah and comfy chairs, it works wonders.
Your cheapest option is something from the sashimi list ($5-$6), but if you are looking for a more substantial meal, try one of their many sushi rolls ($11-$12), or a Maki roll ($6-$8).
In particular, I recommend trying the Tuna Tartare as a starter. Although not the cheapest item on the menu, it is one of the better ones.
After some appetizers, splurge and get your group one of their hookahs ($18). With flavors ranging from kiwi to mint, you will be sure to find something for everyone.
Along with its many hookah flavors, Gazuza Lounge also makes a mean martini for just $6 during happy hour, offered weekdays from 5 to 7 p.m.

When hitting the clubs starts to hit you too hard, visit one of these unique restaurants.
H Street Country Club is a good bet if you are looking for a restaurant and bar off the beaten path.
Nestled in D.C.’s Atlas District, H Street Country Club boasts the city’s only indoor mini golf course and puts a new spin on Mexican cuisine.
A round of mini golf on the 21-and-up course costs $7, but customers get a free round of golf with dinner Sundays through Tuesdays.
If a round of golf does not fill your gaming fix, you can also play shuffleboard, skeeball or Xbox Kinect in the bar area.
The entrees, all served with rice and beans, range from $12 to $19. If you come on a Sunday, Monday or Tuesday, you can enjoy 35 minutes of golf and a delicious Mexican meal, all for under $20. Appetizers range from $3 to $10 and are perfect for sharing.
Try the Dorado – pan-seared Mahi Mahi with sautéed vegetables in a jalapeño-lime sauce. Or stick with something lighter, like the Country Club Salad, one of the restaurant’s many vegetarian and vegan options, all of which are clearly marked on the menu.
Specials include endless happy hour Tuesdays, featuring Dos Equis ($3) and margaritas ($5). Regular happy hour lasts from 5 to 8 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays and 4 to 7 p.m. Fridays through Sundays.
When it’s not happy hour, H Street Country Club’s margaritas cost between $7 and $13, while specialty drinks – named after famous golf clubs and courses, like The Augusta and The Turnberry – typically cost between $8 and $10.
The restaurant also offers a variety of bottled and draft beers, wine and more types of tequila than you have probably heard of.
From the food and drinks to the games, H Street Country Club is a guaranteed good time.
