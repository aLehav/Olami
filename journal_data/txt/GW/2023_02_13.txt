The new announcement of the committee comes after officials used the Wi-Fi system to track community members without their consent throughout fall 2021.
Officials are forming a Data Privacy Consultative Committee that will review all University data projects after officials announced they tracked community members’ whereabouts on campus without their consent in fall 2021.
Provost Chris Bracey said in an email to community members Monday that the DPCC will complete quarterly evaluations of all University data projects, make recommendations around projects’ compliance with GW policies and review any data projects administrators flag as breaching GW’s business practices and policies. The announcement follows officials’ implementation of three data privacy principles, including making decisions around data and privacy principles transparently, adhering to federal and local data privacy laws and clearly communicating new rules on how to use community members’ personal information after officials used the Wi-Fi system to track community members without consent.
Bracey said the DPCC will also make recommendations to officials as to whether data projects or policy should “be paused or proceed.”
“I am grateful to the data privacy task force for its hard work last year in developing data privacy principles and recommendations for the University’s consideration, and I look forward to the Data Privacy Consultative Committee’s forthcoming efforts in advancing these core principles as we realize the benefits of data analytics at the George Washington University,” Bracey said in an email.
The DPCC features five staff, four faculty and one student, including Ronald Layne, Stephanie Baldwin, Harald Griesshammer, Cristina Grigore, Joe Knop, Collins Munyendo, Daniel Solove, Marinella Temprosa, Philip Wirtz and Eric Yang.
The formation of DPCC aligns with additional measures considered by the University last fall like establishing new data governance policies, constructing a new review process for University data analytics projects and refining the University’s privacy notice to include data analytics projects.
Last spring, a Faculty Senate subcommittee said the 2021 tracking project was an “extremely intrusive” initiative that provided “little” value while lauding Bracey and Interim University Mark Wrighton, who apologized after becoming aware of the pilot project.
Officials collected the data throughout the fall 2021 semester despite the University’s privacy policy stating that any party processing data from community members on behalf of GW must issue a privacy notice to users explaining how the information will be used.

The opinions writer who authored this essay asked not to be identified by her full name because of safety concerns.
Hearing “Woman, Life, Freedom” chanted at protests nationwide as a rallying cry for women’s rights in Iran over the past months has been a jarring experience for me. I came to GW for the location and opportunities, including the ability to protest for my country – whether it’s at the foot of the Lincoln Memorial or in front of the State Department.
But my excitement quickly turned to disappointment as I pitched the idea to my parents. They advised me not to go – attending could jeopardize the safety of our relatives in Iran.
As a second-generation Iranian-American, it was encouraging to see so many of my classmates take part in the worldwide protests. They erupted after Iran’s notorious morality police beat 22-year-old Mahsa Amini to death in September for not wearing the required hijab properly with women leading the uproar to change the country’s strict hijab laws.
D.C. activists have organized protests every Saturday, and, as a student living in the District where the makers of our foreign policy work, I had the perfect opportunity to get involved in a cause that was personal to me. So many of my relatives have stories about the morality police, and I’ve seen this violence toward women while visiting my home country over the years.
I felt like I was not authentically Iranian because I didn’t take action along with the others, constantly telling everyone I couldn’t protest for the safety of my family. Here was an opportunity to advocate for my parents’ home country – the culture that shaped who I am today – and yet I was scared of the very real possible consequence that my family would be threatened. I was disappointed and I even felt that my parents were being paranoid – they’re convinced the Iranian government has spies in many places, especially major metropolitan areas like D.C. One of my politically active relatives living in the District had the police visit her home in Iran, and my parents didn’t want to take any chances.
Losing the chance to protest just as quickly as the opportunity arose was almost worse than not being able to protest at all. I envied my classmates as I watched their Instagram stories and saw them attend protests every week since Amini’s killing. They had never been to Iran and had all their family in the United States, safely removed from the political unrest. But seeing classmates from both home and GW post infographics on Instagram was disheartening. These posts tended to oversimplify the situation and ignore the very real threat the country’s authoritarian government poses to demonstrators, even if they were shared with good intentions.
Yet Western awareness of the Iranian regime’s violence against women has had many real effects, like the removal of Iran from the UN Commission on the Status of Women in December. I was glad people were recognizing the oppression women face in Iran and the Middle East, but why did it take such brutality for Western countries to become educated on the matter? I laughed when one friend asked whether I thought there would be a revolution. Little did they know, my family and I had spent years hoping for change – only for the government to continue its religious and social oppression, leaving us cynical and with little hope. At such a politically active university, hearing people talk about the treatment of Iranian women in a much more educated and active manner than my majority-white high school in Orange County, California was definitely a refreshing experience. High school back home wasn’t the best place to grow up connected to my culture.
I returned to California for winter break and decided to attend a small local protest in Irvine with some friends on the condition that we had to cover our faces, not post on social media and avoid being photographed. I felt safer doing so in a suburban environment that would be less likely to receive media coverage. Protesting helped me take a smaller step toward making change, and I returned to D.C. determined to make a difference through the GW and local communities such as the Iranian Student Association on campus and protests that I’m now resolved to attend. After protesting at home, I realized it was possible to protect my identity while also being involved in the movement, and the feeling of solidarity I experienced at the march made it clear that taking action was worth it.
As we approach the six-month mark of the protests in mid-March, I’m ashamed I let myself go this long without protesting as the Iranian people have put their lives in consistent danger for this cause. Joining the IRSA, meeting so many second-generation Iranians with the same experience and organizing together made me feel more involved. The government continues to silence protesters, from average Iranian citizens to famed actresses, with unjust murders and executions. The Iranian protesters must face the fear of the torture and rape that is committed in Iranian prisons every time they step outside – yet they continue to rally.
This movement is personal for me. My friend who moved from Iran in elementary school saw the morality police beat a woman for wearing a hijab that was slightly loose, and one of my parent’s friends was detained in prison for protesting. These and other stories have inspired me to take action from my place of relative safety in the United States, and they serve as a reminder of the strength and endurance of the people of Iran.
As I prepare to join the protests within the next month, I would like to thank Iranians and non-Iranians alike who have protested ceaselessly every week. I hope that 2023 brings better things to the country and community.

Though the Medical Faculty Associates can get lost in the mix of University-related enterprises, its network of doctors from obstetricians and gynecologists in Maryland to podiatrists in Dupont Circle tends to patients across the D.C. region. But as the MFA serves the health care needs of the DMV, its own financial health – with a staggering $200 million in debt to GW – is in critical condition.
Yes, you heard that right. In the past two years, GW has doled out $200 million in loans to the MFA, which is financially independent of the University, to keep the physician practice afloat as its revenue fell further and further during the COVID-19 pandemic. But as officials worked to bail out the MFA, they simultaneously enforced a period of austerity on students, faculty and staff. If GW was willing to cover the MFA’s tab, why couldn’t it instead allocate the same amount of funds to smaller projects that would yield greater improvements to everyday life within its own community?
To be clear, the MFA is vital to Foggy Bottom, the District and the DMV with or without its financial problems. MFA doctors provide regular treatment at the GW Hospital with routine appointments and emergency care for patients, including a senator’s hospitalization last week. The network’s members teach at the School of Medicine and Health Sciences, preparing students for careers in the medical and health care fields.
Beyond the GW Hospital, the MFA’s more than 2,150 employees provide health care services at 112 locations around the DMV. The MFA will also help run the Cedar Hill Urgent Care, the first urgent care clinic in Ward 8, and the larger Cedar Hill Medical Center hospital complex once it opens in 2024. As we’ve noted previously, the multimillion dollar investment in the facilities represents a massive step forward in addressing the health of communities east of the Anacostia River, where the MFA’s physicians and practitioners will fix broken bones, run lab tests and treat traumatic injuries.
Still, the MFA’s benefits can’t change the reality of its financial situation. The MFA’s net assets have fallen by $91.1 million since 2019, and its losses this fiscal year will range between $55 million to $65 million – so much for officials’ plans for the MFA to break even by the end of June. To keep the floundering health care network afloat, GW loaned it $50 million in March 2021 before extending it to $140 million in October that year. In December 2022, the MFA received a $15 million loan from the University, and officials approved yet another $45 million loan in January. Even with measures to restructure the MFA’s financial relationship with GW Hospital owner Universal Health Services to cut costs and raise revenue, it’s unclear what impact these measures have had on the MFA’s finances.
We’re not financial experts. But it doesn’t take a few classes in Funger or Duquès halls – let alone a degree – to recognize that the MFA’s finances have been in serious trouble and are putting a strain on GW. So allow us to put that $200 million worth of loans from the University into perspective.
Aside from variations in GW’s cost of tuition, $200 million would give 805 undergraduate students a free, four-year education at the University. For fans of the newly renovated Thurston Hall, $200 million would cover the estimated cost of its renovations 2.5 times over. And if you can’t get enough of the Thurston or Shenkman dining halls, $200 million equals three semesters of free unlimited dining for GW’s current student population.
GW continued to throw money at the MFA despite reeling from its own estimated $180 million budget shortfall during the pandemic. Officials responded to that shortfall by suspending most capital projects and hirings, freezing salaries and laying off staff. The University saved $32 million doing the latter but cost 339 people in IT offices, the career center and event departments their jobs in 2020.
For better or for worse, GW hasn’t exercised that tough-love decision making when it comes to the MFA. As much as it’s critical to the health and well-being of the region and GW’s mission, the MFA has gotten – and continues to receive – special treatment. While massive layoffs aren’t necessarily the answer, officials’ only solution to the MFA’s problems seems to be pouring more money into a failing enterprise. Perhaps officials’ math adds up on paper, but after failing to meet its initial target of breaking even by this June, how will the MFA make up so much money in so little time to recover its losses by the end of the next fiscal year per officials’ plans?
Whether every dollar the MFA receives from GW represents an act of accounting wizardry or a direct cut somewhere else on campus, it certainly can feel like the latter when the University’s day-to-day operations are marred with maintenance and facilities issues. Just ask the students without hot water in their residence hall, the student organizations calling for more affordable access to Plan B in GW’s new contraceptive vending machine or overworked facilities and IT staff triaging crisis after crisis what they’d do with $200 million.
GW may not be slashing its own budget to spot the MFA a few million dollars, but if it can raise enormous sums of money to keep the organization limping along through years of deficits and debts, the University can surely spare some change for its own community.

Denise Vogt and Frank Leone are the co-chairs of the Foggy Bottom Association History Project.
Many of you decided to enroll at GW in part because of its location in the nation’s capital, but D.C. is more than monuments and politics – it is a city of neighborhoods, each with its own rich history. Did you know that Foggy Bottom was once home to slave plantations, German and Irish immigrants, D.C.’s largest brewery and gasworks, an orphanage, a convent, the city’s oldest inhabited alley and one of D.C.’s thriving Black communities?
We started the Foggy Bottom Association History Project in January 2021 to create a comprehensive resource center for all who are interested in this neighborhood and to protect its historic character. From the beginning we have sought to partner with GW students, faculty, officials and alumni to uncover, document, collect and communicate the shared history of the University and the neighborhood.
The Foggy Bottom Association History Project offers students the opportunity to enrich their experience in D.C. by learning about – and protecting – our shared community history. After all, GW is a University within and of a community, not a self-isolated urban island of education. As students, you can continue to have an impact on Foggy Bottom. As author James Baldwin once said, “History is literally present in all that we do.”
The neighborhood’s history begins with the Piscataway and Anacostan peoples who occupied the area thousands of years ago. A period of plantations and the town of Hamburg, or Funkstown, founded by German immigrant Jacob Funk, defined Foggy Bottom’s history in the 18th century. The development of industry in the 19th century, including breweries, lime kilns, a glass factory and gasworks – plus natural fog from the Potomac River – gave Foggy Bottom its nickname. The Irish and German immigrants who occupied the narrow brick row houses of the Foggy Bottom Historic District from the 1880s to the 1910s shifted to a Black majority in the 1920s.
Foggy Bottom’s history continues through the 1950s with federal and international organization office construction, urban renewal, high-rise development, highway construction and the expansion of GW’s Foggy Bottom Campus. These shifts resulted in the demolition of historic row houses and family-owned businesses in the area and the displacement of the Black community from the neighborhood. Changes and challenges including gentrification, affordable housing and highways slicing through neighborhoods reflect trends that resonate today both within D.C. and across the country.
Since GW first moved into Foggy Bottom in 1912, it has been an integral part of this community and its history. Now, the GW community can participate in the project in many ways – and your participation will help create a more dynamic Foggy Bottom Association History Project.
To learn more about Foggy Bottom’s history, you can check out our website where you can read our blog and review our presentations about the neighborhood’s history. Follow our in-person and online walking tours of the Foggy Bottom Historic District – which preserved some of the neighborhood’s historic rowhouses – or local murals and sculptures that decorate the neighborhood.
You can learn about GW’s history on the website, including the GW/Old West End Historic District and how the University and the neighborhood have impacted each other. Take advantage of our free guide to historical records and a variety of local libraries, including Gelman Library, as well as online and published resources to support your academic research. Our past experiences working with students on class papers and video projects have been mutually beneficial.
Be a house detective and research a few Foggy Bottom row houses and publish your findings about former residents and their lives on our new House History Map, which will launch this spring. The site profiles residents from oyster sellers in 1885 to the seven lodgers who lived in one small house in 1950 to GW students today.
Record oral histories. Our website contains transcripts of interviews with long-term Foggy Bottom residents and a video of Washington Post columnist Colbert King recalling his childhood years in what was then a majority Black neighborhood in the 1940s. We can help identify current and former neighborhood residents as candidates for additional interviews.
Learn about and advance historical preservation both on and off campus. Join us in urging the University to adopt a “preservation through documentation” policy, which would require officials to record the history of buildings destined for destruction under the 2007 Foggy Bottom Campus Plan, like the recently demolished Waggaman House and Staughton Hall. Gelman will permanently maintain your research, photography and documentation of such buildings.
Take advantage of this opportunity to discover, document and communicate our shared neighborhood history and your part in it. Given your choice of an urban campus in D.C., graduating with a better understanding of its history is extra credit.

Experts in higher education admissions said universities offer spring deferral programs when space opens up in residence halls and courses because of students who leave campus to study abroad or unenroll.
This spring marks the first semester for a group of 80 freshmen attending GW due to a deferred enrollment program that GW launched last year.
Officials said they initiated the program during the previous admissions cycle, deferring the 80 students – who were part of the class of regular decision applicants – from the fall to spring semester to create new paths for “academically talented” and “diverse” students. Experts in higher education admissions said universities offer spring deferral programs to enroll applicants when space opens up in residence halls and courses because of students who leave campus to study abroad or unenroll.
Provost Chris Bracey said students are willing to wait until after the fall semester to matriculate into GW. He said officials will offer the “full benefits” of a GW education to students who enroll in the spring, adding that they participated in an orientation that included panel discussions, academic briefings and a resource fair after arriving on campus last month.
“We are pleased GW remains a University of choice for many and are confident that we will be able to offer the full benefits of a GW education to all students, regardless of which semester they begin their academic journey,” Bracey said in an email.
New York and Tulane universities, both peer schools of GW, advertise that they accept students for the spring semester whom they could not accommodate in the fall. Syracuse University allows students to apply to enroll in the spring semester.
Tatum Tatch, a freshman student studying international affairs who enrolled this spring, said she spent a “productive” fall semester in Madrid, Spain, where she participated in a Spanish immersion program and took virtual community college courses like anthropology and economics. She said taking online courses that fulfill course requirements for her major facilitated her academic transition to GW.
She said studying abroad and adjusting to life outside her home state of California prepared her to attend college in an entirely new D.C. environment.
“The experience of getting thrown into a country where you don’t know anyone prepared me for college in general,” Tatch said. “I don’t feel nervous or anything coming in here as far as moving away from home.”
Tatch said after receiving her acceptance email from GW last spring, she connected with a friend from her hometown at GW and contacted other spring-admitted students via Instagram, which eased her social transition to campus life in 2023.
She said she was worried about falling behind on coursework during the semester off in the fall and considered enrolling in another university, but she was “drawn” to GW due to the international affairs program and its location in a major city. She said she is happy about her decision to enroll at GW in the spring because she was able to study abroad in the fall, which the University encourages for international affairs majors.
“I wouldn’t have the opportunity to travel abroad or heal a lot of burnout I had from high school or just take time to reflect on the stuff I wanted to do like in college,” Tatch said. “I don’t really feel behind.”
Experts in higher education admissions said study abroad and attrition, when students leave before completing their degree, create open space on campus that spring entry programs can fill.
Kristin Guidry – a coordinator for Tulane University’s Spring Scholars program for freshmen to start in the spring – said students in the program often spent the fall working, traveling or volunteering, which helps prepare them for living independently and taking on new responsibilities.
“Many students are asking for the opportunity to delay the start of their college career until January to ensure they are prepared to be successful at the university level,” Guidry said.
Guidry said spring admission provides new opportunities for universities to admit students who are qualified and passionate about the institution but cannot start in the fall due to a lack of space on campus.
“For us, our challenges are centered around housing, as our students live on campus for at least their first two years, and classroom space,” Guidry said.
Guidry said Tulane provides spring-enrolled students with the same orientation program as those who started in the fall and guarantees them on-campus housing. She said delayed sorority and fraternity recruitment in the spring semester, like GW’s, also ensures they have the same social opportunities.
“I see spring admits becoming more normalized in the coming years as more schools are hearing from their students that this is the experience they want,” Guidry said.
Anna Lee Buehn, an assistant director of admission for Southern Methodist University, said more competitive higher education institutions across the country have implemented spring admissions programs in response to an increasingly large applicant pool over the past decade.
Officials said they received a record number of freshman applicants for the 2022-23 academic year. College applications across the United States rose 21.3 percent from the 2019-20 academic year to the 2021-22 academic year, according to a Common App report last year.
Bracey said at a Faculty Senate meeting earlier this month that 97.7 percent of freshmen enrolled in the fall semester stayed at GW for the spring semester this academic year.
“For those who did not make that fall freshman class, we truly hold a very special place on this campus,” Buehn said.
Buehn said SMU does not offer virtual courses, restricting enrollment to in-person spots, and students have a two-year residency requirement on campus, which limits the number of spots available in classrooms and campus housing in the fall semester.
GW dropped the on-campus residency requirement for third-year students last month and will only require on-campus living for freshmen and sophomore students.
“We want the best and the brightest,” Buehn said. “We want the students who are going to make the most of the opportunities that exist in this campus.”

The Student Association and the Center for Career Services collaborated to host the GW Career Exploration EXPO, a two-week program featuring panels, virtual and in-person recruitment and an alumni brunch on campus.
For the first time since before the start of the pandemic, a University-wide career fair came to campus last week.
More than 70 DMV-based employers in education, health care, engineering and government attended the largest of the fair’s recruitment events Friday, drawing roughly 1,000 students to tables across the Continental and Grand ballrooms on the third floor of the University Student Center. Student Association Senate chairperson pro tempore Demetrius Apostolis, CCAS-U, the executive director of the EXPO’s planning committee, said the SA and the Center for Career Services hosted the GW Career Exploration EXPO, a two-week program of 10 events featuring panels, virtual and in-person recruitment and an alumni brunch on campus.
GW has not hosted a career fair since January 2019, according to the University calendar. The fair brought in more than 100 employers that year and occurred each spring prior. The career center hosted a fair restricted to local startups in February 2020.
Apostolis said a 12-person committee including Apostolis and SA Vice President Yan Xu, met with career center staff weekly over the last four months to organize the event. He said the SA recruited students to attend, while the career center contacted employers.
“It was actually an idea that I had when I was running for Student Association Senate last May,” Apostolis said. “Coming out of the post-COVID world, the in-person career events and allowing students to connect with employers was something that I thought GW was missing.”
The EXPO began Jan. 30 with a virtual resume workshop with the career center. Later in the week, employers and students participated in a virtual recruitment event over Handshake Thursday and an in-person recruitment event Friday spanning the entire third floor of the University Student Center.
The EXPO ended with a brunch between alumni and students Saturday.
Apostolis said the planning committee released a survey and tabled in Kogan Plaza earlier this week to seek student input prior to the fair.
“People just want to interact with employers one on one,” he said.
Apostolis said the career center covered food and setup costs for employers who attended. The SA allocated $4,000 for the event in September, which went toward promotional materials and the alumni brunch Saturday. He said the SA would reallocate unspent money back to the senate’s operating budget, which funds the operations of the legislative body.
Apostolis said about 70 students attended a panel held last week for international students, where author Dan Beaudry spoke about available pathways to employment.
“Honestly, it’s been even a learning experience for members of the planning board, just getting to see how everything works and how they can get jobs as well and preparing students to make sure that they’re all equipped for this process,” he said.
More than 25 students who attended the fair said they were able to connect with employers local to the area and relevant to their fields of study. Students said in-person interactions helped them gauge the atmospheres of companies and helped them build more direct connections.
Hae Joo Yoon, a senior majoring in international affairs, said she hoped to get a better idea of the types of people working at various companies. She said at Friday’s event, she discussed diversity and inclusion with a recruiter from a development fund and received her business card.
“In my job application process, I’ve really struggled with getting a grasp about what kinds of people are working at what kinds of companies,” she said. “And I just want to talk to people to get some more personal connection to see if I can find a place where I would like to partner.”
She said she attended the event after receiving multiple emails from the career center and the SA earlier in the week.
“Honestly, I was a little worried that it would be very intimidating, but it’s really not,” she said.
Gigi Tsastulga, a junior studying finance and data science, said she hoped to find a job that sponsored her as an international student. To work in the U.S., international students must receive sponsorship from an employer to obtain a work visa.
Tsastulga said many companies state they do not sponsor international students on their website or Handshake profile. She said the remaining companies weren’t currently offering positions relevant to her major, meaning she was likely ineligible for a job.
“They don’t have open positions for my major,” she said. “They only have cybersecurity, so I was not good.”
Tsastulga said attending the international student panel with Beaudry, the author of “Power Ties: The International Student’s Guide to Finding a Job in the United States,” provided helpful advice for international students aiming to work in the U.S. after graduating.
More than 20 company representatives at Friday’s event said the EXPO offered employers the chance to advertise job openings to future graduates already based in the D.C. area.
Christopher Bailey, the deputy chief building official for the District’s Department of Buildings, said he attended the career fair to find candidates who can fit the agency’s immediate need for engineers, architects, planners and construction administration. Bailey said he hoped to introduce college students to opportunities in the public sector.
“We also get to see who we’re interviewing,” he said. “It’s a little bit on our side too – it’s a little bit selfish – we actually get to find out if they’re dedicated, find out if they’re interested, find out if they can absorb the regulatory mindset.”
Bailey said the agency hopes to hire engineering students right after they graduate because most engineers enter the private sector.
“If we get some young minds and some really great people that can come on board, that’s great. But think about this in the long term,” he said. “We serve a society, and we need this on a constant rotation basis.”
Christina Vinhack, a senior manager of operations at the American Council for Technology Industry Advisory Council, said she saw consistent interest from students at Friday’s event. She said she saw a wide variety of majors among students.
“The crew here have been extremely welcoming, very generous, helping us all set up and the communication’s been great, so we definitely would love to come to another George Washington fair in the future.”

Dean of Admissions Ben Toll said although enrollment has started to climb since the onset of the pandemic, “Zoom fatigue” has reduced engagement in live, remote programming. 
After turning to remote meetings to reach prospective students during the pandemic, officials said online recruitment is here to stay.
Dean of Admissions Benjamin Toll said admissions officers plan to continue the student-led virtual tours and information sessions that they introduced when the pandemic began in 2020 to market the University to students who could not visit campus in person. Experts in higher education admissions said multiple universities have adopted virtual information sessions, but virtual recruitment has lost traction among prospective students suffering from “Zoom fatigue” after in-person tours and programming resumed in fall 2021.
Toll said GW plans to continue to “experiment” with a mix of in-person tours and virtual programming, which will include more specific information about the Mount Vernon Campus, transfer student admissions and degree programs than GW’s in-person sessions.
“Statistically, students are more likely to apply if they do both an in-person visit and a virtual opportunity,” Toll said in an email.
Officials said freshman applicants increased by 1.7 percent from 2020 to 2021, when they received 27,141 applications while recruitment remained entirely remote. Since fall 2020, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions has provided virtual information sessions, and officials expanded those events to include prospective transfer students in spring 2021.
The Office of Undergraduate Admissions ran a podcast series called GW Unfiltered on topics like dining and politics at GW from August 2020 to March 2021 to provide information to prospective students. The Office of Student Life also launched a student-led video blog series called “Connect to Campus,” which ran from September to December 2020, to engage with prospective students when most of GW’s operations were virtual.
Undergraduate enrollment dropped 7.7 percent from the 2019-20 academic year to the 2020-21 academic year after the pandemic began in March 2020.
Toll said although enrollment has started to climb since the pandemic, “Zoom fatigue” has reduced engagement in live, remote programming. But he said virtual live information sessions were still a very “effective” method to connect with students and communicate with parents because it supplements in-person Inside GW sessions.
The University paused Inside GW, an eight-day tour and information session program for admitted students and their families when the pandemic hit before resuming it last April.
“Virtual programming will remain a part of the admissions process moving forward, but we will continue to experiment with formats and types of programming to best meet the needs of each cohort of future students,” Toll said.
Jason Zara, the faculty director of undergraduate admissions, said he has led “Discover Engineering and Computer Science at SEAS” since fall 2020, a virtual information session about the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences where prospective students can participate in a Q&A session.
“As time has gone on, there are fewer participants that turn their cameras and microphones on,” Zara said in an email. “More questions come in through the chat. I think people have gotten camera exhaustion.”
He said SEAS will continue to host virtual events as the school expands in-person tours.
“I don’t think virtual information sessions replace an in-person visit to campus, and many students follow up by visiting campus,” Zara said.
Experts said online recruitment efforts have made higher education more accessible to prospective international students who may struggle traveling abroad to tour a college campus. They said colleges and universities can curate virtual information sessions to students based on their program or degree of interest and make programming schedules more flexible through pre-recorded content.
John Thelin, a professor emeritus at the University of Kentucky, said admissions staff have always hesitated to organize virtual recruitment events in fear of disrupting their “historic” and “established” institutional image with modern technology.
He said even after higher education institutions developed their virtual recruitment technology, the quality of recruitment content tends to suffer due to lag and poor design from adults who don’t have as much technological experience.
“Nothing is more boring than tired, weary technology that is not well done,” Thelin said in an email. “Students and applicants probably are far more sophisticated consumers about technology and images than are the adults who design and use them.”
He said audiences’ patience with malfunction runs thin with college admission sessions, and these events might become repetitive of college websites.
“It becomes a predictable backdrop, but not really central to hard decisions by good applicants and good institutions,” Thelin said.
Steve Goodman – an educational consultant and admission strategist at Top Colleges, an admissions consulting agency – said virtual platforms are effective for generating applications, but the percentage of students who enroll based on virtual recruitment efforts is still unclear.
“There’s the issue of whether the ‘good student’ who GW really wants is the student actually matriculating,” Goodman said. “Is that student applying? And is that student ultimately accepted and going to matriculate at GW? The question is in this post-pandemic period whether or not those tools will be sufficient to yield the students specifically that GW wants.”
He said the production cost of in-person tours could also dissuade officials from expanding in-person recruitment programming. He said that unlike online tours, in-person programming requires paid student tour guides and admissions staff, facility rental space and gifted University merchandise for visitors.
“I suspect that there will be a combination of the virtual and in-person because ultimately students and families are going to feel much more comfortable knowing that they’ve actually interacted with somebody at the University before they decide to matriculate,” Goodman said.

Marinella Temprosa, the principal investigator of the study, said 25 clinics across the country will evaluate potential signs of Alzheimer’s disease in participants with diabetes or prediabetes in hopes of stopping, preventing and reversing Alzheimer’s.
Updated: Feb. 14, 2023, at 12:09 p.m.
GW’s Biostatistics Center is advancing a nearly 30-year study on the connection between diabetes and Alzheimer’s with more than $51 million from the National Institutes of Health for the research.
Marinella Temprosa, the principal investigator of the study and an associate research professor in the Milken Institute School of Public Health, said 25 clinics across the country will evaluate potential signs of Alzheimer’s disease in participants with diabetes or prediabetes in hopes of stopping, preventing and reversing the disease. People with Type 2 diabetes, which affects more than 30 million Americans, have a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s, but the connection between cognitive decline and diabetes is still unknown, according to the Alzheimer’s Association.
Temprosa said the research is a continuation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study that began in 1994, which observed how lifestyle interventions like diet changes, increased exercise and treatment with the diabetes drug metformin can delay the disease in people who have a higher risk of contracting it.
She said in the new study, which will take five years to complete, researchers from the 25 clinics will observe the original 1,976 participants of the DPPOS study and see if they are showing signs of Alzheimer’s.
“The main goal is really to understand what are the determinants of Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias in prediabetes and diabetes,” Temprosa said in an interview.
She said the application process for the grant from the NIH – which was finalized in September 2022 – took two years, and the funding will last until 2027, adding up to almost $89 million.
Temprosa said the study employs about 200 researchers nationwide who will evaluate the participants while the Biostatistics Center – housed under Milken and based in Rockville, Maryland – acts as the study’s coordinating center, a facility for managing and storing data for the study.
Pamela Norris, GW’s vice provost for research, said in an email that the grant is the largest NIH-funded grant that the University has received “to date.”
Temprosa said the research team is currently enrolling willing participants from the first study and assessing their memory, language, brain and metabolic health. She said they expect about 15 to 30 percent of the original cohort to have mild cognitive impairment and about 10 percent to have dementia, which Alzheimer’s could have caused, based on national estimates.
Alzheimer’s is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive erosion of memory and other cognitive functions, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. More than six million senior citizens are living with Alzheimer’s, according to the Alzheimer’s Association.
Temprosa said the study will focus on identifying biomarkers – a biological molecule found in the body that signals a condition or disease – to identify Alzheimer’s before it manifests. She said the study will be the first to focus on the origins of diabetes-related Alzheimer’s, and the identification of the biomarkers will help future researchers potentially develop a treatment or cure for the disease.
“People don’t really know what is it in diabetes that gives that extra risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease,” Temprosa said.
Experts in Alzheimer’s studies said research that examines the association between Alzheimer’s and diabetes will be critical in treating cognitive decline in older populations because the connection between the two diseases is unknown.
Mark Espeland, a professor of gerontology at Wake Forest University, said the multimillion dollar grant for Temprosa is a “major grant for a wonderful researcher” that will hopefully help fill in some of the gaps in diabetes and Alzheimer’s research. He said GW has been critical in advancing the diabetes field as a leading research institution in diabetes because of research like the GRADE study, which found two drugs effective in decreasing glucose levels last October.
“GW has a long history of studying diabetes both among younger folks and older folks,” Espeland said. “The institution has made many major contributions to diabetes research and, of course, Dr. Temprosa has been part of that story.”
Allison Reiss, an associate professor of medicine at New York University’s Long Island School of Medicine, said researchers have known about the connection between diabetes and Alzheimer’s for more than 20 years, but finding ways to halt and prevent Alzheimer’s is still unknown. She said a cure for Alzheimer’s doesn’t exist currently, but typically expensive drugs, like Namenda and cholinesterase inhibitors drugs, give some relief from memory loss symptoms to the patient.
She said diabetes can lead to a higher blood pressure, which can hinder blood flow to the brain and can potentially lead to dementia or Alzheimer’s. She added that the human trials will create a better understanding of the disease than animal trials.
“I think we want to find help for everybody with Alzheimer’s, and if we find something in the study, I do believe it’s going to help people that don’t have diabetes as well,” Reiss said.
Huntington Potter, a professor of neurology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, said studying patients with diabetes, who have increased affliction rates of Alzheimer’s, is more efficient than studying the general population.
“If we can look at a special population that has a very high risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, then we may get better insights faster and with less resources spent,” Potter said.
R. Scott Turner, the director of the Memory Disorders Program at Georgetown University, said the risk of Alzheimer’s becomes pervasive in older populations, especially for people over the age of 65. He said doctors now have sharper diagnoses that detect more cases of Alzheimer’s, and society recognizes that memory loss is not a normal sign of aging.
Turner said he is hopeful about the prospective outcomes from current diabetes research, but the drugs and treatments necessary to make a cure for Alzheimer’s may be years away.
“If we’re successful with our clinical research program, we hope that Alzheimer’s may in the future become just something that people read about in textbooks but never actually see a case,” Turner said. “But we have a long way to go before we get to that sort of scenario.”

The Hatchet incorrectly reported 25 clinics would split up money not included in the $51 million. We regret this error. This post was also updated to clarify the study will take five years to complete.
