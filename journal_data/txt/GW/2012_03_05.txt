Academic dishonesty defies the fundamental tenets of a University, and yet cases are on the rise at GW. This is problematic for any university that seeks to foster a culture of academic self-discovery.
Tim Terpstra, the director of the Office of Academic Integrity, said the University has witnessed a 10 percent increase in cases of academic dishonesty since 2005. Sixty-two percent of the overall cases involve plagiarism.
 He is working to turn plagiarism cases into learning experiences for convicted students. His primary outreach efforts involve partnering with the Writing Center to better teach students how to properly cite sources, which will hopefully prevent future infractions from the same individuals.
But incidents of plagiarism can be difficult to catch, and that’s why it’s best for the University to take a proactive approach to curbing this trend. It is reassuring that the infrastructure exists to educate convicted students of the consequences of his or her actions, but a more effective process is putting a stop to plagiarism before it occurs.
The University can start this by standardizing a preventative approach with the Office of Academic Integrity. Terpstra and his office must be granted greater access to work directly with students throughout the University and have more personal and accessible conversations about cheating and plagiarism.
Such an approach could be implemented in writing intensive classes such as University Writing and the Writing in the Disciplines courses. These professors could partner with peer educators from the Academic Integrity Council, and could have an in-depth discussion about plagiarism on the first day of classes.
Mandating a personal and candid dialogue with students will have a much greater effect than a cursory mention of the academic code of integrity. By having a more detailed and frank discussion about plagiarism, students may better understand the significance of plagiarism.
While it is unrealistic to suggest that every single professor needs to or should partner with the Office of Academic Integrity, this discussion should occur whether or not peer mediators are present.
Professors in WID courses could also be encouraged to adopt the UW20 model of requiring students to submit outlines and rough drafts of papers. Oftentimes, students plagiarize when they are struggling to finish an assignment last minute. By frequently checking in with students as they work on their assignments, professors are better able to identify students who need help developing original ideas or citing sources.
While there is a University-wide academic code of integrity, professors should be encouraged by the Office of Academic Integrity to clarify and define their own individual expectations about what they consider to be plagiarism and how they will respond to it. By having an agreement with professors about what constitutes plagiarism, students will be more aware of how to research and cite their material throughout the semester.
As a result, they would be more aware of when they potentially infringe upon the academic integrity policy, and could self-correct their mistakes or seek advice from a professor.
Departments could also work to better communicate their specific standards for plagiarism. It can difficult for students to understand the nature of plagiarism across multiple disciplines, as each course requires a different form of research and citation.
A culture of academic dishonesty has the potential to damage the integrity and credibility of any university. Should plagiarism further manifest itself, it will set a dangerous precedent of diminishing the creative nature of academics at GW.
While preventative measures such as these are certainly not a cure-all for plagiarism, they can go a long way in furthering the discussion about academic dishonesty and perhaps curb a rising trend of plagiarism before it’s too late.

GW selected last week the five offices that will be relocated to the Marvin Center fifth floor this summer, after months of conversation about how to best use the campus hub.
The $2 million services center will feature about 80 individual office spaces and 20 meeting rooms for the five departments the University believes students interact with the most: Center for Student Engagement, the Career Center, the Center for Civic Engagement, the Office for Study Abroad and the Center for Undergraduate Fellowships and Research.
“The biggest criteria was, ‘What did students need to interact with to take advantage of interesting opportunities, or to get something so they don’t have to run around from place to place to place?’ There’s a single place where they can go and talk to career counselors and internships and service learning,” Provost Steven Lerman said.
Chris Deering, project manager and political science professor, said there was a “high degree of consent” between the stakeholders and the administration.
This is the team’s first major decision since planning started this fall for the student services center. Deering took charge of the project in early January to ensure it “proceeds at a reasonable pace,” Senior Vice Provost for Academic Affairs and Planning Forrest Maltzman said at the time.

Student organizations will have access to the rooms when departments are not using the collaborative space, Deering said. Each room will feature double doors that can be locked from the administrative side. When the offices are closed, student organizations can access the space from the outside reception area.
Robert Hallworth, director of the Office for Study Abroad, said his office needed to move because it had “outgrown” its townhouse near 20th and H streets.
“With the move to the Marvin Center, we solve some of our space problems and at the same time have the welcome opportunity to work in closer proximity with colleagues who will help us create new synergies in our future endeavors,” Hallworth said.
The offices originally in the talks but not chosen for the move include the International Services Office, which will remain in leased space at 2033 K Street, and the Center for Alcohol and Drug Education, housed in Thurston Hall.
Director of the International Services Office Greg Leonard said his staff wanted a location closer to the center of campus but understands the space crunch. Leonard’s team advises GW’s 2,100 international students and helps them transition to the University.
“We’re going to continue on as we can for a few years and hopefully move to the main section of campus soon,” Leonard said.
Deering agreed that the office “will be very high on the list to move if we can fit it later on.”
In January, the University announced that campus organization space would not be included in the fifth floor plans, which has riled student leaders and pushed them to take their case to the Board of Trustees.
The Center for Student Engagement’s shift from the fourth floor to the fifth will add 33 percent more student space to the fourth floor, Dylan Pyne, chair of the Marvin Center Governing Board said.
Pyne and Student Association President John Richardson are lobbying the University to fund a revamp of existing space for charter organizations: the SA, the Marvin Center Governing Board, the Resident Hall Association and Class Council. Other student groups will continue to vie for space by application.
In the reshuffling, the previously separate Greek Life Office will move into shared space with the CSE, although the design is still being finalized. In past years, its large collaborative space has allowed three Greek letter umbrella organizations – the Inter-fraternity Council, the Panhellenic Association and the Multicultural Greek Council – to meet informally with staff.
Last week, the three organizations created a petition to keep the collaborative and storage space in the Greek Life Office. As of March 4, close to 400 students had signed, including leaders from multiple chapters on campus. Director of Greek Life Christina Witkowicki did not return multiple requests for comment.
Pyne, who is in charge of doling out office space on the fourth floor to student organizations, said he is encouraging Greek organizations to apply for individual offices next year so the chapters can continue to share workspace.
“Looking at the size and level of programming Greeks have, I imagine that when we do review all applications and make decisions on who get space, they would be at the top of list,” Pyne said.

The Colonials exited the court Saturday in Dayton with the stage set for a chance at revenge.
After losing 75-59 to the Flyers Saturday, the Colonials must now prepare to return to Dayton for the first round of the Atlantic 10 tournament. It’s a chance to avenge the last regular season game, and a chance for payback after Dayton ousted GW in the first round of the 2010 A-10 tournament.
But before the conference standings were announced Saturday, head coach Mike Lonergan said he would not relish returning to Ohio if the Colonials were again paired against Dayton.
“It was a disappointing loss, but I give them credit. They are a very good team,” Lonergan said. “They played more physical than us.”
The Colonials were bested from the beginning of play when the Flyers exploded out on a six-point run. Dayton would not relinquish the lead for the rest of the game. Tony Taylor finally snapped Dayton’s run, first putting the Colonials on the board with a smooth jumper.
The senior guard, along with junior forward David Pellom and junior guard Lasan Kromah, were the stars of GW’s offense Saturday, scoring 51 of the Colonials’ 59 total points. Taylor finished with 17 points, Pellom added 18 and nine boards and Kromah scored 16 on the game.
Pellom narrowly missed netting his fifth consecutive double-double. His performance was a boost to GW after questions about his health surfaced in the time leading up to the game. Pellom, who battled a left knee injury earlier in the season, saw the condition return in the days leading up to the game at Dayton. At first, the forward said, he slowed his play on the court, but he soon focused on continuing his strong record of performance.
“I was just second guessing myself about turning and twisting back and forth, but I just calmed down and told myself that I am alright,” Pellom said.
The Flyers outshot the Colonials on the day, particularly from three, where they shot 62.5 percent, compared to GW’s 37.5. Dayton slightly edged GW on the boards – earning a 31-25 advantage – and better capitalized on Colonial mistakes: Despite both teams committing 12 turnovers, the Flyers picked up an 18-8 advantage in points off turnovers.
Trying to find a solution to Dayton’s shooting, Lonergan switched between man-to-man defense and different zone schemes, using a 2-3 and a 1-3-1 at different points in the game. The most successful defense of the day was the 1-3-1, Lonergan said, but it still didn’t make up for the rest of the approaches falling flat.
“We got a little bit of length, and I thought we did a decent job because we struggled to guard them off the dribble,” Lonergan said. “I thought it got us a little bit within striking distance. You got to play better man-to-man defense so you don’t have to rely on the 1-3-1.”
Further impeding GW’s progress was the amount the Flyers headed to the line, especially following calls on junior forward Dwayne Smith, who was in foul trouble by the end of the first half. By the end of play, Smith had four fouls, limiting his playing time to only 12 minutes, a serious depletion to GW’s frontcourt.
The Colonials saw the gap widen during the second half to as much as 20 points before the team went on a 6-0 run. But the team’s overall aggressive play, during which the Colonials almost matched the Flyers’ field goal percentage at 45.5 percent and 46.2 percent, respectively, was not enough as Dayton continued to outscore GW.
“[GW needs to] keep being aggressive and taking good shots. We have to continue to rebound the ball. We rebounded really well in the first half, but then they killed us on the backboard [in] the second,” Taylor said. “We have to do a better job of containing the ball so they don’t get as many threes as they did today.”
Taylor, who clocked 35 minutes in the game, said the team would keep a positive outlook going into the tournament despite being in the midst of a four-game slide.
The Colonials, the No. 11 seed in the A-10 tournament, have a chance for retribution – both for Saturday’s loss and for the first-round defeat two seasons ago.
“We have another chance, that’s how we’re looking at it. We have a big opportunity on Tuesday to win – to win one game,” Taylor said. “We just have to take it one game at a time.”

Student leaders are demanding an apology from MEOR for alleged discrimination when the Jewish student organization blocked their entry to an on-campus event.
Members of Students for Justice in Palestine claim they were barred from attending the on-campus Feb. 28 speech of Israeli Reservist Sergeant Benjamin Anthony.
Banu Gumusoglu, president of Students for Justice in Palestine, said she was one of about 12 members not admitted into the event.  She said when she asked the organizers why they had to leave, MEOR members claimed the event was private. When she and others refused to leave, MEOR called in the University Police Department to intervene.
“It became apparent to us that the sole reason we weren’t being admitted was because of the company we were keeping, which was a mostly Arab group,” Gumusoglu said. “There was essentially no way for the organizers to know who was invited or not invited based on anything besides racial profiling.”
Officers are not required to stand outside events that have less than 100 people, but Gumusoglu said the organization had a few of its members stationed at the door blocking the group’s entrance.
“[One of the MEOR organizers] pushed me with his chest out of the room,” Gumusoglu said. She told UPD she would not press charges when officers arrived shortly after the incident.
Joshua Hollander, campus coordinator for MEOR, said the organizers called in UPD officers “to provide protection and security” for those attending the event.
“Unfortunately, this week’s private event was significantly disrupted by individuals not enrolled in the class whose purpose was to make it impossible for our lecture regarding Israel to be heard,” Hollander said. “Our efforts to ensure a safe and respectful environment for the guest speaker and the students were aggressively threatened.”
He strongly denied that any student was assaulted during the incident.
Students for Justice in Palestine is demanding an apology from MEOR because “in all instances of discrimination and on some level, injustice and oppression, recognition is our right,” SJP member Adam Akkad said.
Akkad said he had heard about the event through a Twitter account called CampusSpeakers1, which had Tweeted hundreds of times Feb. 27 advertising the time and place of MEOR’s event. Hollander said the event he helped organize was private and limited to the 35 students enrolled in the MEOR Maimonides Leader Fellowship program, calling the Twitter account “fraudulent” with “no connection to our organization.”
Anthony’s website advertised several lectures of “Our Soldiers Speak” as part of its nationwide tour, but did not mention the conference held at GW.
Gumusoglu and Akkad said the event did not appear to be limited to students in the fellowship, because there were families in attendance.
“There was no ID check at the door,” Gumusoglu said. “There were small children. There were parents. There were people who told us explicitly that they had never been to a [MEOR] event previously.”
Hollander said the only family in attendance was the rabbi’s family.
Labeling MEOR’s reaction “a preemptive attack,” Akkad said MEOR was anticipating a protest. Other chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine had a history of protesting events hosted by Israeli soldiers, Hollander said.
When asked about his reaction to the students seeking an apology from MEOR, Hollander said his group would accept an apology from Students for Justice in Palestine. He added that the incident “has been blown out of proportion.”
No police report was filed as of March 4. UPD Chief Kevin Hay said officers responded to a report of a “disorderly group who tried to force their way into a small, private event.” He said a student was “bumped” while attempting to enter but did not want to press charges.

GW was Kara Wright’s first choice for college when she applied in 2006.
After four undergraduate years, she was hooked, opting to stay at GW as a graduate student and University employee.
“A lot of people that I work with have gone to GW for either undergrad or grad school, and I think that’s kind of [true] across departments,” Wright, who works in the Division of Information Technology while pursuing a master’s in media and public affairs, said. “They’re happy to be GW grads and they want to keep supporting the school.”
Wright is among a growing population of former undergraduate students who believe attending GW was the right choice. An internal survey released this month, conducted by the Office of Institutional Research and Planning, found that members of the Class of 2010 were more likely than seniors in any of the five years prior to look back confidently on their decision to attend GW.
University President Steven Knapp said anecdotally that “so many things” at GW moved in a positive direction during the years in question, but he was hesitant to draw a causal relationship between the survey results and specific changes.
Knapp noted the increasing institutional aid pool – which stood at $160 million this year – as a possible reason for the shift.
He added that an expanding population of satisfied graduates would foster alumni giving and establish stronger connections with current students, but called engaging the older alumni base “one of our biggest challenges.”
“There were periods in the past where students weren’t that happy,” Knapp said. “We were a so-called commuter school, and those schools tend not to…have as easy a time generating loyalty as schools in which there is a strong residential basis on campus.”
Since arriving in 2007, Knapp has emphasized fundraising to help wean the University off its dependence on tuition revenue in favor of dollars brought in through philanthropy.
Last year, the University raked in about $113 million in gifts – a record it’s on track to break this year.
Vice President of Development and Alumni Relations Mike Morsberger has said repeatedly that the spike in donations coincides with his department’s efforts to “knock on more doors.” The University has also moved to bolster its alumni programming in recent years, hosting more social events and using social media to drive constant communication with alumni.
Knapp also emphasized the University’s mounting academic status. Last year U.S. News and World Report ranked GW as the No. 50 university in the country, a standing it has not held since 1998.
“As we become a stronger and stronger institution, and as our reputation continues to grow, [alumni] are proud of that, even if they weren’t part of it,” Knapp said.
Completed by nearly all 2010 graduates, the survey showed that 67 percent of respondents would choose GW again, up five percent from 2008.
About 120 fewer students said they would not opt for GW again, while the portion of respondents who said they might make the same decision held steady at one-fifth.
The survey also showed more students believed they had improved themselves at GW. Slightly more respondents in 2010 indicated that they had increased awareness of social problems, had higher self-esteem and improved in goal-setting, oral and written communication and working as a team, Associate Provost for Academic Planning and Assessment Cheryl Beil said.
The internal research department distributed the survey via e-mail to graduates as a prerequisite to receiving graduation tickets. There were 2,267 respondents in 2010, representing 96 percent of the class.
The Class of 2010’s results show higher approval than cohorts that graduated between 2005 and 2009, neither of which broke two-thirds positive responses, previous data showed. Survey results vary from year to year, University spokeswoman Candace Smith said in an e-mail.
Senior Vice Provost for Student and Academic Support Services Robert Chernak said a slew of factors may have contributed to the marginal bump.
“While the results of the surveys certainly reflect satisfying results, there are probably too many interrelated factors that contribute to the improvement,” he said.
He cited improved facilities and the University’s rising selectivity and academic quality as possible causes. The Class of 2010’s higher overall test scores upon being admitted to GW may indicate that they were more prepared academically than other cohorts, he said.
This trend falls in line with the slight increases in students’ satisfaction with courses and interactions with professors also demonstrated by the senior survey, Beil noted.
“Hopefully, the survey for the graduating Class of 2012 will show even greater improvement over that for 2010,” Chernak said.
Mike Sullivan, who graduated in 2011 with a degree in political science, said he valued his GW experience for its District location.
“Some schools are in the middle of nowhere, but in D.C. there are so many opportunities to do anything you want,” Sullivan said, citing his internship with Senator Scott Brown, R-Mass. “Granted, everyone at GW has done [Congressional internships], but that’s something that not a lot of other people are able to do.”
The University’s location in the center of Washington, D.C. is something that President Knapp has been credited for touting as an incentive to potential applicants.
The resources of GW’s downtown campus are a major focus of the marketing firms tasked with rebranding the University’s visual image this semester. Their work will be unveiled to the GW community March 5 at a townhall hosted by the Office of External Relations.

The University announced Thursday that one of the world’s most-watched journalists will deliver the keynote address at this year’s Commencement Ceremony.
Brian Williams, the managing editor of NBC Nightly News, attended GW for a semester in 1980, in addition to a short stint at Catholic University of America, but he never earned a diploma.
“It is an honor to be asked, and I intend to point out the obvious: Every graduate in the audience will have achieved what I failed to do – earn a college degree,” Williams said in a statement provided by NBC News.
Vice President for External Relations Lorraine Voles headed the seven-member selection committee, which included students, faculty and staff. The list of potential speakers started out at 50 in the fall.
“He’s obviously a very accomplished person, he’s funny and we thought he would have a great message for students,” Voles said.
She declined to say how many potential speakers GW reached out to before Williams. She also did not provide names of others on the shortlist.
University President Steven Knapp called Williams “an esteemed and accomplished journalist,” in a statement March 1.
“His wealth of knowledge and experience and his attendance at George Washington make him an ideal speaker. We are honored that he has accepted our invitation to address the Class of 2012,” the statement read.
Williams has been with NBC since 1993 and took over Tom Brokaw’s position as anchor for “NBC Nightly News” in 2004. He garnered national attention for his coverage of Hurricane Katrina and the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.
In addition to Williams’ accolades as a journalist, he is known for his ability to draw laughs from audiences on “Saturday Night Live,” “Late Night with Jimmy Fallon” and “The Daily Show.”
In the last few years, Williams has delivered commencement speeches at places like Fordham, Tulane and Notre Dame universities. During each speech, Williams called for action on national and local problems such as poverty, the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and the Gulf oil spill.
Williams’ selection diverges slightly from the political speakers that Voles has helped select over the last three years. Past guests include New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, First Lady Michelle Obama and White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emmanuel.
Mexican investor Carlos Slim, the world’s richest man, will join renowned painter Clarice Smith in receiving honorary degrees at the University-wide ceremony May 20 on the National Mall.

Study space will emerge on Gelman Library’s third floor after spring break as the University gets a head start on long-awaited renovations to the 39-year-old structure.
Forty percent of the periodicals in circulation on the third floor will be moved to an off-site storage facility in Upper Marlboro, Md. to make room for study areas, University Librarian Jack Siggins said.
The space will not include new furniture, but will bring desks and chairs from around the library to reduce crowding and costs, Gelman Library spokeswoman Anne Ward said. With construction on the horizon for the ground floor of Gelman, the library has made an effort to clear some operations and collections out of the building while spreading out seating.
“The University is trying to juggle all these requirements. There’s a real crunch for space,” Siggins said. “We’re keeping up our pressure as much as possible. We’ve got our foot in the door.”
Ward said she was unsure exactly how many tables would make up the third floor space.
The extra tables will complement the new study zones and laptop bars already planned for the updated entrance floor, which will also include workstations and several multi-purpose rooms.
The University’s $16 million upgrade to Gelman’s entrance floor will shift the building’s entrance up to the second floor through Kogan Plaza. The design plan was solidified in January when the University hired the firm Cox Graae + Spack Architects.
The library is “looking to create more informal, mobile study spaces” with the entrance floor renovations, Siggins said, pointing to the Mount Vernon Campus’ newly renovated Ames Hall as a model for open study areas. The third floor will also not include cubicles.
The University will begin construction on the library this summer, and the renovations are slated for completion by 2014.
Aria Varasteh, Gelman Library’s student liaison, has led a “Help Transform Gelman” campaign that has gathered student feedback on library services and space through surveys and town halls.
“In a time where everyone in the University is complaining and looking to the Marvin Center for more space, Gelman is beating them to the punch,” Varasteh said.
To create what Siggins called a “one-stop shop” for student academic needs in the final design plans, Student Technology Services representatives and the research help desk recently joined the circulation desk on the entrance floor. The move may become a permanent fixture once plans are “locked in” at the end of this semester, he said.
This article was updated on March 5, 2012 to reflect the following:
The Hatchet incorrectly reported that books would be moved off the third floor to make room for study space. In fact, periodicals will be moved, not books. Also, due to an editing error, The Hatchet associated Jack Siggins’s comments about informal study space with the new third floor space. In fact, Siggins was referring to the space on the entrance level, which will be renovated by 2014.

The newly elected Student Association outsiders are setting out to learn the ropes of the organization they will soon be steering by getting an early start on outreach and student organization finances.
Ashwin Narla, who won the Student Association presidential runoff March 1, will work with executive vice president-elect Abby Bergren to move forward with ideas from their platforms, including outreach from the SA, streamlined finances for student groups and a campus-wide calendar.
“This is only the beginning. There’s still a lot of work to be done,” Narla, a junior, said minutes after securing the top post. “We’re going to make ourselves more transparent, accessible.”
The election marks the second-straight presidential victory for an SA outsider over a finance committee chair and the highest turnout in SA runoff history. Narla earned support from 53 percent of students, a total of 2,331 votes.
The previous record for turnout stood at about 3,000 votes in 2008. This year’s election saw a 43 percent jump over ballots in last year’s runoff to reach 4,385 votes.
Before the two take office in May, Narla said he plans to work with Bergren to kick off their efforts early.
“Abby is fantastic. Working with her, I know we’re gonna get a lot done,” Narla said.
He and Bergren both said they want to help connect more students to the SA, stepping up the use of social media and face-to-face interactions with students.
Narla, whose platform includes a monthly “State of the Campus” address, has made communication between students and student leaders top priority.
“I really want to be held accountable. I’ve been saying that since day one,” he said.
Narla intends to sit down with Bergren as well as returning and newly elected senators to “see what they’re trying to do and what they’ve accomplished this semester,” he said.
In the next few weeks, Narla will familiarize himself with student organization needs by making appearances at events. He also hopes to catch up on the conversation about student space on campus by working with the SA and Marvin Center Governing Board members.
Bergren, who beat out competitors Ben Leighton and Austin Brewster for the post two weeks ago, has already begun preparing for her role as head of the SA Senate by attending its most recent meeting Feb. 27. She said she plans to speak to departing and returning members of the senate to field their feedback about how to run the organization.
Her campaign focused on having greater transparency about student fees, expanding student space and advocating for graduate student organizations.
She will tackle fees first, keeping up the “momentum” of this year’s fee commission created by Student Association President John Richardson and Executive Vice President Ted Costigan.
During the general election, Narla came in second to John Bennett, who received about 130 more votes but did not reach the 40 percent threshold needed to secure the presidency.
Narla credited his team of supporters for their help in publicizing the elections and edging him above Bennett in the runoff. His campaigners focused on word of mouth and making a strong effort to talk to students, Narla said.
“You’re only as good as your team. I can’t emphasize that enough,” he said.
He secured the top spot by a margin of about 300 votes, unlike last year’s tight presidential race in which Richardson beat out then-senate Finance Committee Chair Chris Clark in a runoff by just 34 votes.
Narla won 58 percent of votes from students in GW’s nine other schools, Phil Gardner, chair of the Joint Elections Committee, said.
Bennett earned 97 percent of the 300 law school votes, Gardner said.
“I want to thank John for running a clean campaign, for being a great competitor. He’s a phenomenal guy,” Narla said. “I would really like to work with him in the upcoming year. He brings so much to the table.”
A three-year veteran of the SA with two years on the finance committee, Bennett said about 24 hours after the election that he is “at peace with the situation” and will consider how he wants to continue his involvement on campus next year.
“I put so much time and effort into it for so many years,” he said. “It’s almost like all the hard work was overlooked, underappreciated.”

Based on inaccurate data provided by the Joint Elections Committee, The Hatchet incorrectly reported that Narla carried 71 percent of the non-law school vote. Narla received 58 percent of the votes from this student population. We regret this error.
