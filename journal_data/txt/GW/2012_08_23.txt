Students living in Philip Amsterdam and Munson halls will move into newly renovated rooms this fall.
Carpets were ripped off the floors in Philip Amsterdam Hall and hard surface flooring was installed to update the old flooring. Director of Housing Seth Weinshel said most rooms also received new cabinets, and some bathrooms had new grout laid in the tile.
Kitchen cabinets were replaced in about 47 of Munson Hall’s 72 rooms, Weinshel said. The rest of the kitchen work will finish late next week for residents who opted in for additional work.
Bathrooms received new vanities, lighting, exhaust fans and toilets, and tap-and-enter door locks were installed, Weinshel said.
Munson repairs were allocated about $2.5 million in the 2013 capital budget, out of a total of $4 million set aside for residence hall repairs this year. Carpet replacement across GW this year totals about $100,000 in the 2013 budget.

The summer before my freshman year, I received a yellow GW towel at CI.
I find myself feeling sentimental as I unpack that very same towel junior year. Though it now has an unidentified stain with a mysterious origin I hope to never solve, the towel remains a token of a university I have grown to love and a place I call home.
That is not to say I was unhappy to return home this summer. I would hate to come across as someone who prides himself on having escaped the haunted past that is upper-middle class suburban childhood. But I cannot deny that since the end of last semester, I’ve missed my life at GW and all the experiences that make it so unique.
I’ve missed doing my food shopping in Whole Foods with all its organic pasta salads and pretentious croissants. I would sometimes browse through the aisles of my hometown’s ShopRite when I felt nostalgic, but it just isn’t the same without having to constantly avoid making eye contact with all my past hookups.
I’ve missed political humor. My home friends try to make me laugh with movie quotes and offbeat stories, but that just doesn’t do it for me anymore. I’m sorry, but I don’t see how a joke can be funny without name-dropping at least one political figure and sneaking in a subtle jab at Fox News.
I’ve missed cockroaches. We just don’t have those at home.
I’ve missed diversity. North Jersey, south Jersey, central Jersey – it’s amazing how much culture you can pick up when your friends are from all different exits along the Turnpike.
I’ve missed FoBoGro and the way its sandwiches seem to be getting progressively smaller. But its salads are still pretty hefty, so they should probably consider downsizing.
I’ve missed waking up to the sound of construction. After all, you know what they say: Jackhammers are the roosters of the 21st century.
I’ve missed school spirit. Nothing gets my blood flowing like hearing the GW Fight Song echo from the Smith Center’s crowded stands… How does it go again?
I’ve missed the thrill of snagging an empty study room in Gelman Library only to be kicked out five minutes later by someone who claims to have “reserved it online.” The only thing that makes this frequent occurrence more enjoyable is how people pretend to feel guilty about kicking me out. We both know I’m an ungrateful freeloader who doesn’t deserve their pity.
I’ve missed the high achievers I meet in class. Oh, you spent your summer building houses in Uganda? I spent my summer making money. Which I intend to keep. For myself.
They say absence makes the heart grow fonder. Well, I think I might just be living proof. And though I’ve hardly been back for much time at all, I am anxious to create new memories.

No matter what year this is for you, there is always something you can focus on or prepare for. 
Class
Introduce yourself to your professors, sit closer to the front of the room and visit office hours. It sounds intimidating, but it can only help for your professors to know your name. They will be able to distinguish you from hundreds of students, upping your chances of nailing that prized letter of recommendation or internship hook-up.
When you need to turn in big papers, book an appointment with the Writing Center’s student tutors, who can help with drafts and revising.
Colonial
Get involved with student organizations, intramural or club sports or community service. Don’t overload your schedule, but experiment with your interests. Attend the student organization fair, and think about Greek life. You could make lifelong friends, even if you end up drifting away from some of those activities.
When J Street gets old, buy food from one of the food trucks parked in Foggy Bottom. Follow @foodtruckfiesta on Twitter to know when vendors like The Big Cheese, CapMac or Fojol Brothers will make an appearance.
Capital
Buy a SmarTrip card, and explore neighborhoods beyond campus via Metro, like Adams Morgan, U Street or Alexandria.  A SmarTrip is the sign of a true Washingtonian, and branching out to sites other than major tourist attractions is a must when you’re in a city for four years.
If you like to dance, check out the 18+ nightclubs just a cab ride away from campus. On your way home, grab a late-night snack at Crepeaway or Manouch’s hotdog stand; both are GW traditions.
Career
If you are unsure about your goals during and after college, as many freshmen are, don’t worry – just stop by Career Services to sign up for a career consulting appointment. An adviser can help to identify your interests and skills and formulate a personalized academic plan that indicates majors and career tracks that would suit you.
Invest in a comfortable business casual outfit. A classy ensemble will come in handy for the interviews that will eventually begin to pop up as you begin your college career.
Class
If you live on Foggy Bottom and have not frequented the Mount Vernon Campus, there is no better opportunity than exam time to check out Eckles Library for a change of scenery – and a quieter and cozier study space than Gelman Library.
Consider continuing a language class you took last year, even if it is not a requirement for your major or school. Being multilingual can be crucial to maintaining a competitive edge in today’s global job market, and it will also open up more opportunities for studying  abroad.
Colonial
Look into alternative spring or winter break trips for an opportunity to travel abroad or across the U.S. with fellow Colonials to help others. The cost usually shrinks after fundraising, making alternative breaks affordable.
Still carrying the freshman 15? Sign up for a group fitness pass at the Lerner Health and Wellness Center. For $80 per semester, you will have unlimited access to Zumba, cycling and pilates classes.
Capital
Cupcakes are a D.C. craze, so be sure to sample different bakeries to find your favorite. Check out  Baked & Wired, Georgetown Cupcake and Sprinkles in Georgetown, but also head to Hello Cupcake in Dupont.
Just because you’re all grown up, doesn’t mean you have to forego trick-or-treating. Visit Embassy Row in Dupont to get a side of culture with your Halloween loot and participate in a D.C. tradition. Just remember to make the rounds early, as most embassies close up shop before 5 p.m.
Career
Break into the working world with your first internship. Even if you have no idea what career path you will embark on, pursue job options to gain experience and learn what you like and dislike about different industries.
Also, reach for a leadership position in one of your extracurricular activities. Building your resume early on will make you a more competitive applicant in future job searches.
Class
Stop by the Office for Study Abroad, and check out the programs offered. An academic experience abroad can pull you out of the slump during your junior year by offering a change of pace. Both short- and long-term programs are offered, based on how much time you’re willing to spend away from the District.
Take a class that is not required. Make room in your schedule for classes that you have been eyeing but diverge from your typical line of study. You might even end up changing your major or taking on a new minor.
Colonial
Participate in a GW TRAiLS trip, and get off campus to experience the great outdoors. Each year, TRAiLS organizes a whitewater rafting excursion, as well as several other trips. If you are over 21, you can volunteer to drive the TRAiLS van and receive 50 percent off the cost of your trip.
Join the Colonial Army to support athletics year-round and become part of a group of spirited Colonials. The $20 membership includes priority seating at athletic events and free goodies.
Capital
If you’re 21, check out one of the adult kickball leagues that play each weekend on the National Mall. After a bit of friendly competition and exercise, they head out to the bars, win or lose.
After a busy week of classes, meet with friends for happy hour at Nooshi on 19th Street. A hotspot for GW students and young businesspeople alike, the restaurant is a great hangout with reasonable prices and a welcoming atmosphere.
For some spontaneous fun, hop on the Metro one day with some friends and get off at a stop you have never visited.
Career
Apply for your dream internship – and some backups, just in case. Many of the high-in-demand internships are only open to juniors, so you will have tough competition and should submit your resume to multiple employers. Use the Career Center’s 24-hour resume critique service to boost your chances of scoring your ideal job.
If you do not yet have a LinkedIn profile, create one to build up your online presence for the modern job market. The website will also give you leads on potential job opportunities.
Class
If you anticipate a stressful senior year, sign up for a one-credit yoga or meditation class to calm your schedule. If not, enjoy the extra free time in your schedule after years of hard work. Do not be afraid to enroll in an introductory-level class, even if you are the oldest student in the room. If there is a subject you are interested in but never got a chance to try, go for it while you still can. You never know when a little background knowledge will come in handy – be it in your career or just at a cocktail party.
Colonial
Consider joining the GW Cancer Institute team in the Marine Corps Marathon, which takes place every October. You’ll be supporting a great cause, taking in classic D.C. scenery along the way and hearing the cheers of U.S. Marines as they cross the finish line.
Plan a spring break trip with your friends.  After graduation, coordinating travel plans won’t be easy, so take advantage of your last week off together for a while and indulge in the stereotypical college vacation, complete with sandy beaches and unlimited piña coladas. Great deals can be found on a myriad of student travel websites, Groupon.com and through STA Travel.
Capital
Make sure to complete as much as you can from your GW bucket list. If you already have, buy tickets for a Washington Nationals baseball game, and root for the city you’ve become a part of over the last four years.  Even if you don’t like baseball, you’ll be sure to have fun and get caught up in the spirit of the crowd.
You can’t leave the District without getting a peek at the interior of the White House, so book a tour of the White House through your hometown Congressional Representative’s office.  Bookings take place months in advance, so plan ahead.
Career
Start your job search prior to graduation with the help of the Career Center.  With services like On-Campus Recruiting, mock interviews, a great alumni network for networking and biannual Job and Internship Fairs, the Career Center is there to help you as you begin your career.
Don’t limit yourself to a narrow career search: Be willing to explore related fields or even accept an internship, which could lead to full-time employment later down the road.  Few jump from college to their dream job right away, so don’t get discouraged if your plan doesn’t pan out to a tee.

When Max Nunes arrived at Google’s District headquarters for his second day on the political advertising team, he put on painting clothes and got to business.
By the end of the day, after painting a giant American flag across their office wall, Nunes and his teammates had sufficiently bonded with one another, ready for the summer ahead.
Nunes, a senior from Martha’s Vineyard, Mass., has spent the summer helping political campaigns use Google to communicate with voters this election season.
“We have people who really care and are really passionate about politics. Not only do you want Google to be used in the most effective way, but you want your client to win. It’s a cool hybrid of business and politics,” Nunes said.
As a political communications major, Nunes said his interest in technology’s role in politics began in the classroom. He knew then that it was a career path he needed to explore.
This summer, as a political advertising intern at Google, Nunes worked on a team that helps political campaigns and agencies best utilize the company’s products in their efforts.
“Our job is to sell Google and to help our clients use Google in the best way possible for them to get out their messages and reach voters in November,” he said. He added that, while Google supports clients across the political spectrum, he primarily works with progressive and Democratic candidates, campaigns and causes.
The most exciting part of his internship, he said, is the group of people he works with. His teammates all arrived at Google from political backgrounds and have a comprehensive knowledge of the unrelenting world of political campaigns. Having worked largely in Democratic politics, Nunes said his coworkers have exposed him to new perspectives.
“We sit in a room with a bunch of really passionate Republicans and really passionate Democrats. Combine that with everybody being really smart – we get into a lot of debates,” Nunes said.
As the election season ramps up, Nunes’ days at Google are growing longer. He will stay on through the fall and hopes to pursue a career in political technology.
“I definitely got the technology bug throughout the summer,” Nunes said.
On an average day, Nunes sits in an open room with his entire team – from the top account executives to his fellow interns – which he says cultivates an open and engaging corporate culture.
“Google is a place where change happens so quickly and things are always evolving and advancing,” Nunses said. “They want us to feel really open to asking questions.”
The stakes are even higher as the Nov. 6 election approaches.
“After Labor Day it will be really ramped up, and we’ll hit the ground running,” he said.

A beat-busting DJ, adult contemporary rockers and horn-blaring disco barons will come to campus this fall – for a price tag of nearly half a million dollars.
The University will shell out a total of $472,500 to bring Diplo, Train and Earth, Wind & Fire to play during Fall Fest, Colonials Weekend and Alumni Weekend, respectively, according to contracts obtained by The Hatchet.
In June, the University agreed on a $240,000 contract with the Los Angeles-based entertainment booker Creative Artists Agency to bring the soft rock troupe Train to the Smith Center Oct. 20. It was a popular choice for Colonials Weekend, because the band has cross-generational appeal, which is ideal for parents and students, Senior Associate Provost and Dean of Student Affairs Peter Konwerski said. Tickets range from $45 to $125.
“Ticket prices are set to cover the costs associated with the performer and production. This has worked well in the past, and we expect to do well again this year,” Konwerski said. “Ticket sales and event expenses are carefully monitored to ensure that our budget is maintained.”
The booking was a shift from the University’s typical choice of a comedian to headline Colonials Weekend. According to estimates on the college booking agency Concert Ideas’ website, previous Colonials Weekend acts like Jon Stewart usually demanded upwards of $150,000. The University will pay $190,000 for the ‘70s soul icons Earth, Wind & Fire to play the Smith Center Sept. 28. The group, which has won six Grammy awards and is most famous for its disco hit “Boogie Wonderland,” will entertain about 2,700 alumni, whom the University will encourage to donate to the school.
“While we don’t comment on specific costs, our goal is to ensure that we are able to cover all costs and fees associated with the show, while offering a range of ticket prices,” Konwerski said.
Through the booking company The Windish Agency, the University will pay Fall Fest acts Diplo and RDGLDGRN $42,500 to play a free show for students in University Yard Sept. 1. The student organization Program Board, which is appropriated money by the Student Association, manages the Fall Fest band selection and was appropriated a $60,000 budget last year.
An estimate by Concert Ideas shows the price of a Diplo show at more than $35,000, while a college booking agency Main Stage Production pegs the price between $25,000 and $30,000 for a spring show. The Fall Fest contract also includes the charge for the opening act RDGLDGRN, pronounced “Red, Gold, Green.” The contract stipulates the opening band play for a half hour, followed by the main act performing for 75 minutes.
“It’s a high profile, high expense event, but we’re really thankful for the co-sponsorships that we get. We’re lucky to be financially supported the way we are,” Program Board executive chair Lauren Shenfeld said.
The Philadelphia-based mash-up artist is the second DJ in a row to be tapped to headline the fall performance for students, Program Board confirmed Tuesday. Under the alias Diplo – a moniker inspired by the dinosaur Diplocodus – Thomas Wesley Pentz has been mashing beats across the U.S. and Japan for nearly a decade.
“There were a lot of other artists we were looking at – some other DJ artists similar to Diplo but not as big as him,” Shenfeld said. “But we always really wanted Diplo.”
Diplo, a producer, songwriter and performer, is best known for his musical melees of big names like Beyoncé, Usher, No Doubt and M.I.A. – his R&B artist ex-girlfriend who helped him break into the industry.
He is also part of the DJ group Major Lazer.
Mash-up artist Girl Talk electrified the crowd at last year’s Fall Fest, a vibrant show that Shenfeld hopes to repeat with another DJ performance this year. A cost estimate on the website for Main Stage Production shows the price for Girl Talk at about $40,000, while Concert Ideas places it at $50,000 or more.
Program Board paid $25,000 for the alternative rock band OK Go to play Fall Fest in 2007, according to a contract obtained by The Hatchet. That equals about $27,600 in today’s dollars, accounting for inflation.
The cost of booking bands varies by the artist’s popularity and demand. For example, the pop band fun. garners more than $45,000 per show, according to estimates by Concert Ideas. Indie groups like Local Natives and Metric usually ask for about $20,000, and more mainstream artists like Jason Mraz and Kelly Clarkson typically draw more than $100,000.
Agents at The Windish Agency and Creative Artists Agency declined to comment on the market for on-campus concerts and their discussions with the University.

The University is pledging to minimize the disruptions to students as crews continue to gut Gelman Library’s lower floors this fall.
Administrators and library officials said they will strategically schedule quieter construction work during peak use hours to avoid interrupting studies.
“Work during library operating hours should not impede library functions or student access in and out of the library’s main entrance on H Street,” University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard said.
Gelman student liasion Aria Varasteh said the construction team worked from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. this summer clearing second floor offices to make way for a new ground-level entrance through Kogan Plaza. But those hours will change at the beginning of the academic year.
Noisy work will mainly occur between 3 and 7 a.m. once classes begin, Varasteh said, but he was unable to provide a construction schedule. He said students could “hear at most a thump” during day and nighttime hours.
During midterms and finals, construction will halt or cut down, he said.
“They know when there aren’t many students in the library, and those are the target hours for construction,” said Varasteh, a 2012 graduate. “The construction schedule will constantly be relayed to students.”
The crew will update the GW community on its construction schedule every few weeks so students can plan their studying schedules ahead of time.
“When we do know more, we’ll be sure to post it on different media for students’ benefit,” Varasteh said.
Construction will not affect the library’s services on the upper floors, Varasteh said. He added that none of the new staff areas, located on the first, third and sixth floors, would take up student study space. Staff office space shrunk by two-thirds since renovations began, he said, freeing up more room for students.
Sherrard said that infrastructure work in the library may cause “temporary closure of limited areas,” but did not specify which parts of the library could close.
Work on the building’s exterior will begin once the city approves building permits, Sherrard said, a process required by D.C. law for every phase of major construction projects.
Sherrard declined to comment on when the University expected to receive the permits.
Donohoe Construction Company is on track to wrap up work before the anticipated summer 2014 completion date, Sherrard said.
GW paid the company, a frequent contractor, more than $13 million as of June 30, 2011, according to financial forms filed with the Internal Revenue Service.
Renovations are geared toward mitigating the criticism the aging library has faced, including what University President Steven Knapp has called a “cave-like” entrance.
GW announced in January that it had hired an architect to design the long-awaited upgrades, including laptop bars, more study space and additional multi-purpose rooms.
The project is Gelman’s largest upgrade to date.
Gelman staff will host “Librarypalooza!” in Kogan Plaza Aug. 28 to keep students up-to-date on the project.

The University will set aside $40,000 for its counseling center to continue offering free sessions to students this year, underscoring the high priority placed on mental health programs over the last year.
The counseling center began providing free appointments last fall, cutting its $50-per-session fee after campus groups argued that the cost deterred students from seeking help. But a 14-percent increase in one-on-one sessions from September to April compared to the previous year prompted concerns that the center would need to restore the fee to meet its fundraising target of $80,000 each fiscal year.
This month, Senior Associate Provost and Dean of Student Affairs Peter Konwerski said the UCC will only need to raise half that amount this year and GW will pick up the rest of the tab.
The funding was not redirected from one specific area of the University’s budget, which is controlled by the Board of Trustees, but instead came from GW’s wider funding pool.
“Its a good endorsement by the University’s leadership that the six free sessions is a good model,” Konwerski said. Lowering the UCC’s expected revenue contribution puts “less pressure” on the center to charge for sessions, he added.
Interim director of the UCC Mark Levine said the increase in appointments over the past year showed “the impact of decreasing the financial barrier to getting mental health services through UCC” and encouraged GW to keep the reduced costs.
Konwerski and Levine led a formal review of the center’s budget this summer, and found internal strategies to shave costs and improve efficiency.
The counseling center is hiring for seven positions – including four new clinicians – this fall, and Konwerski said it will look to fill some of those spots with staff who do not hold doctoral degrees. This would allow GW to stretch its dollars for salaries, paying those without additional experience “a little less.”
The University saw more clients come into the center last year, but noticed less growth from moneymaking services like career evaluations. Predicting that the lack of cash flow into the center would take a toll on its budget, student leaders like SA President Ashwin Narla called on administrators to preserve the free sessions.
The counseling services on campus came under the spotlight after a student’s suicide in April 2011.
Last year, the University launched a mental health-focused online referral system to identify at-risk students, which is seeing an official launch this fall. About 375 at-risk students were identified through the University’s quiet rollout of the site last fall.

Most students return from summer break with a nice tan, some new clothes and a sleek haircut.
GW will also start the year off with a new look. After two years of planning, the new University logo is set to be revealed Sunday as part of the University’s rebranding campaign.
As a school in the middle of a bustling, media-obsessed city, GW was never the “typical college experience.” But as a student, I’ve always felt the University cares a little too much about its appearance in the public eye. In 2010, The Hatchet reported that the University increased the number of staffers within its Office of External Relations to help promote its departments, faculty and academic programs and to improve messaging.
That’s why it’s no surprise that at the heart of this rebranding campaign is the University’s desire to change how others perceive it.
To help design the logo, GW hired two branding agencies, FutureBrand and 160over90, whose clients include the London 2012 Summer Olympics, Microsoft, UPS, Nike, the city of Boston and several universities nationwide. And although University officials have repeatedly declined to disclose how much this expansive campaign – and the Aug. 26 launch celebration in University Yard – will cost, the estimate is .in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. According to the Miami Student, the Miami University of Ohio student newspaper, the school spent around $300,000 on billboards and advertisements alone. Michigan State University’s student newspaper, The State News, reported that MSU spent approximately $478,000 on its rebranding campaign in 2010. Both universities hired 160over90 – one of the two firms GW has brought on – for their campaigns.
Flashy logos and catchy slogans are all well and good, but this all seems like a distraction from the University’s most important focus – providing its students a worthwhile education and fulfilling college experience.
I understand why the University embarked on this campaign. GW is hoping to morph into a more prominent research university, but to do that, it first has to market itself as one. When you think of universities like Harvard or Yale, you think of stately ivy-covered buildings, high-profile research and prestigious professors.
But a rebranding campaign is not the best way to build an institution’s prestige. Funds for the rebranding campaign could have gone toward upgrading Gelman Library or improving financial aid.
From the constant construction of campus facilities, to new majors and minors, to the new Auntie Anne’s in J Street, it’s no secret that the University is undergoing significant changes. We don’t need a rebranding campaign to boost our image; there are already tangible examples of “image enhancement” all across campus.
The entire rebranding effort seems more like a sports manager’s attempt to bolster a struggling team’s fan base than a campaign to actually promote the University’s standing among other institutions.
We should aim to improve GW’s educational reputation, foster growth and entice potential students to enroll based on academics, instead of wasting time and precious tuition dollars on redesigning a logo.
I would be lying if I said I wasn’t excited to see the new face of GW, hear stories told in the mobile studio that will roll into University Yard for the unveiling event and enjoy some free snacks. But at the end of the day, can we really justify using money that could have been allocated elsewhere?
At some point, we have to step back and ask ourselves, “Is this really worth it?”
