Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., addressed questions from ANC commissioners at the meeting, where she stressed the need for D.C. statehood and announced she will hold a virtual town hall about road safety later this month.
A local governing body approved GW’s request to restrict the public’s access to District House after the implementation of a new dining system this fall during a monthly meeting Wednesday.
The Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission unanimously voted to change the building’s zoning from general public retail to restricted University dining, pushing ahead GW’s plans to build a dining hall in the basement of District House before opening the space this fall. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., also answered questions from commissioners, and the University provided updates on its COVID-19 isolation policy at the meeting.
Here are a few of the meeting’s highlights:
ANC endorses District House dining hall plan
The ANC unanimously supported the University’s application to modify zoning at District House, sending the request to the D.C. Zoning Commission for final approval.
Karen Zinn, GW’s associate vice president for business services, said GW requested the zoning modification so the University could transition to a residential dining model with a new dining hall in District House restricted to University community members this fall. GW will also open dining halls in Shenkman and Thurston halls in the fall as part of a new unlimited dining system with all-you-can-eat meal access mostly in place of GWorld vendors previously housed in residence halls.
“For community building, for the safety of our students, we want the dining program to be exclusive to the University community, not have the program open to the public,” Zinn said during the meeting. “What that means for District House is a change in zoning.”
She said the public will still have access to restaurants on campus, like Panera and Chick-fil-A in the University Student Center, as well as dining options in Western Market and new spots set to open this year in the 2100 Penn complex. Zinn presented preliminary floor plans for the renovated District House food court, which would intersperse the floor with seating and vendors, like “Piccola Italia” and “Tú Taco.”
“It will look like it’s retail, but it functions as all-you-care-to-eat,” she said. “It means that students can come in, they can stay, they can fill their plates.”

Officials presented their proposed concept for the District House dining hall that’s set to open this fall under a new unlimited dining system. The ANC approved the University’s application to remove public access from the site.
Commissioner Trupti Patel relayed concerns from her constituents about the accessible and affordable food vendors that will leave District House to make room for the new dining layout. Kevin Days, the University’s director of community relations, said the moves are meant to address food insecurity facing students, which the University considers a top priority.
“The University is not interested in reducing public facilities for the community,” Days said. “What we’re doing is transforming them and reallocating our space to serve our primary function, which is to serve the GW student population.”
GW shares COVID–19 isolation protocol update
Days also delivered updates to commissioners about Mark Wrighton’s arrival as interim University president and GW’s handling of the Omicron variant after the University community returned to campus earlier this month. Days said more than 500 people tested positive before returning to Foggy Bottom, delaying their return to campus.
He also confirmed that officials reserved 250 beds at the Yours Truly Hotel until Feb. 26 to serve as extra COVID-19 isolation housing for students if on-campus isolation housing exceeds full capacity. Days said students isolated in the hotel use their own elevator, receive food deliveries and return to campus with transportation provided after their 10-day stay.
Days said officials followed COVID-19 protocol set by D.C. Health in their decision to maintain GW’s 10-day isolation period despite guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommending five days of isolation for asymptomatic COVID-19 cases. He said GW officials are continuing to conduct contact tracing for members of the University community who test positive for COVID-19, while D.C. officials alert potential close contacts who are not affiliated with GW.
“We are seeing some promising numbers and positivity rate – the positivity rate seems to be heading in the right direction,” Days said. “And we are pretty confident that once we move through this spike period, we’ll be able to go back to fully isolating our students on campus.”
Holmes Norton answers questions from commissioners
Holmes Norton, the District’s non-voting congressional delegate, attended the meeting to answer questions about topics like D.C. statehood and road safety.
She said she helped to defeat 20 bills in the past year that threatened to interfere with D.C.’s self-determination, including legislation targeting the District’s vaccine mandate and COVID-19 restrictions. She said Congress has treated the District like a political “football” and asserted that D.C. statehood is the primary method to prevent potentially intrusive federal policies.
“Republicans, and it is always Republicans, will continue to try to interfere with D.C. to score political points until D.C. has statehood,” she said during the meeting.
Holmes Norton answered a question from Commissioner Yannik Omictin about repeated closures of the Ellipse and Lafayette Park, which can force cyclists to take detours without protected bike lanes. She said she opposes barriers to safe transportation and announced a virtual town hall about road safety later this month.
2021 was an especially deadly year for traffic-goers in the District as  traffic collisions killed 40 people on the roads of D.C. last year, the most since 2007.
“Federal infrastructure policy has long prioritized speed for motorists over the safety of people in communities that those crossroads pass through,” Holmes Norton said. “As a result, pedestrians and bicycles are often an afterthought in road design, but under the recently passed bipartisan infrastructure law, we are moving away from that.”
E Street encampment shrinks, evictions stalled
Omictin said the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services sent a letter to the D.C. Council last month announcing that no immediate plans were in place to evict people from the homeless encampment at 20th and E streets near campus. The message is a reversal from the city’s previous plans to close three of the city’s largest homeless encampments, including the E Street encampment, and transition unhoused residents to affordable housing through a pilot program launched last September.
The program faced harsh backlash from local activists who claimed it was not thoroughly or transparently planned and failed to connect all residents to housing options. The ANC requested the deputy mayor’s office in October to delay the encampment evictions until residents have received the opportunity to be housed under the new program.
Omictin said the letter announced that officials would also wait longer to evict an encampment at 25th Street and Virginia Avenue with similar intentions of ensuring residents found housing first.
He said the decision to stall evictions will make it easier to provide housing, an approach that he argued has already been successful, noting that the size of the E Street encampment has shrunk dramatically with only six or seven people remaining in tents at the park.
“The number of folks that live there has gone down to around six, seven, and so that is a tremendous improvement,” Omictin said. “A lot of folks are getting housing.”

For an investigative reporting project I worked on for a class last October, I interviewed Jim DeRogatis, who reported on singer R. Kelly’s abuse of Black girls for more than 20 years. Revisiting that conversation now, I am left with one haunting question: what is the age of innocence for a Black girl? To the convicted Kelly, who wrote and produced singer Aaliyah’s Age Ain’t Nothing But a Number when she was 14, teenage girls are ripe for ruin. In his eyes, they are not bright children dreaming of brighter futures. They are merely objects, their light subsumed by his lust. As a girl, I watched my own light be denied and distorted in the eyes of grown men who watched me with shameless scrutiny. When they asked for my age, I emphasized in a small voice that I was only 12 or only 16. I thought that my youth would insulate me. I realized that, to some guys, it eroticized me further. In this society, the question of innocence does not apply to Black girls. And in this society, when a Black girl’s age is raised, it ain’t nothing but a number. Malcolm X famously proclaimed that the most unprotected person in America is the Black woman. I would include Black girls in that assertion. To be a Black girl in this country is to perpetually feel either too seen or unseen. We are denied innocence in our youth and dealt violence. The social media hashtags celebrating our joy, our magic, our melanin imply that we must constantly affirm and insist upon our humanity. I wish these hashtags could save me. I wish the shirts advocating for “All Black Girls” could guard me against the leers that greet me on the street. But despite their best intentions, they do not. I still shudder inside when a dark-suited stranger speaks to me sweetly. And while other young women might suffer the same panic, the added menace of misogynoir makes a sexually charged situation all the more sinister for Black girls. At random moments, I think of the many missing and murdered Black girl stories that my mother sends me. They remind me of my how unprotected I am. They remind me of the dark fears and fierce blues bottled up inside a Black girl’s body. I would sometimes walk alone around my suburban neighborhood in South Carolina when I was 11 years old. While out strolling one afternoon, I passed by lovely brick houses perched on neat streets and several acres of wooded land. I always observed the woods because my friend Courtney had claimed them as her clubhouse. As I continued walking, I encountered a white man strolling down the street. I saw no one else but him. At that moment, I dreaded the adjacent woodland’s rolling hills and imposing trees. When faced with a stranger, this land I loved to roam turned quickly into a common place to cast a little girl’s corpse. I thought of Caylee Anthony, a white girl whose body was discovered in the woods in 2008 and whose death outraged America quite like the disappearance of travel influencer Gabby Petito. But would people scour the earth for a Black girl? Would the world erupt over someone like me? The answers lie in the bleak statistics on missing children in the United States. 70,754 Black girls under age 18 were reported missing in 2020, according to the National Crime Information Center. At any time, I could be included among a similarly grim number. Later, when the stranger on the street asked which house I lived in, I lied and pointed to the one closest to our location. After that, I only remember my fear fading and him leaving in a friend’s white truck. What does safety look like for a Black girl? A world where we do not feel burdened by our Black female bodies. I would have loved to have played a little more, laughed a little more without worrying about the consequences of my skin or my shape. In a better world, Black girls can skate down the street and double-dutch on concrete without searching out the suspicious men. They can be fun-loving and full-bodied and still be seen as precious little girls. Mostly, I hope that Black girls today can live without the fear that I carried throughout childhood and adolescence. The fear of a guy subjecting you to shame with just a stare. The fear of being abducted or abused and the world not batting an eye. Black girls deserve to feel light only, love only. Black girls deserve to be free.

When spring classes began remotely last week, it felt like March 2020 once again. I thought to myself, “Will I have to endure yet another semester where lecture halls and social interactions are replaced with Zoom breakout rooms?”But the reality is that it is not March 2020. Now, vaccines and booster shots aid in decreasing the severity of cases and flooding of hospitals. We know more about how the virus is transmitted and the precautions to avoid it. Notwithstanding, the highly transmissible Omicron variant is now at play. Officials “strongly” encouraged members to wear N95 or KN95 masks as in-person instruction resumes in an email sent to GW community members last Wednesday. But to take account of the recent COVID-19 surge, officials should take their recommendation a step further and require medical-grade masks in classrooms and lecture halls. The proof is in the pudding – N95 masks can filter out 95 percent of all airborne particles when worn correctly. Well-fitting masks, like N95 masks, are proven to offer the highest level of protection when compared to disposable surgical masks and cloth masks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. GW’s recommendation to wear N95 and KN95 masks clearly shows that officials recognize their benefits. Now, officials should take it one step further and provide safety and security on-campus by requiring them. One of my professors required that their students only wear N95 and KN95 masks in their classroom to protect their unvaccinated toddlers at home. Officials should support professors and instructors like mine who risk their health and safety and those around them to teach in person by requiring high-quality masks in classrooms. GW can only do so much to regulate what community members do off campus, but a more diligent strategy to masking on campus is appropriate considering the circumstances.GW has taken a rigorous approach to prevent the spread of COVID-19 on its campus, and its masking policies should reflect its previous actions. Students are required to take COVID-19 tests every two weeks to access campus buildings and facilities – and further, students must be vaccinated and boosted to attend classes unless exempted for approved medical or religious reasons. When the CDC rolled back its quarantine period from 10 days to five days for those who’ve contracted COVID-19, GW maintained its 10-day quarantine period for infected students per Mayor Muriel Bowser’s guidance. GW can and should be doing more to combat the spread of COVID-19 on its campus and in the greater D.C. area. In addition to the contact-tracing system in place for student organizations and clubs, a high-quality respirator mandate should be extended to such meetings, events, practices and performances. While student organization meetings certainly enhance one’s college experience, in-person meetings are not essential during an ongoing pandemic. If GW permits in-person student organization meetings, a more robust policy on masking would be pertinent to consider. Although GW’s daily caseload has leveled out in recent days and interim University President Mark Wrighton said in an interview last week that no one in the GW community was experiencing a severe case at the time, we’re not out of the woods yet. D.C. has sustained a 24 percent positivity rate and has seen a more-than-two-fold increase in hospitalizations over the past two weeks. 
Confirmed positive cases of COVID-19 have mounted to a daily average of 763,855 in the United States – more than three times last winter’s peak average, according to John Hopkins University data. Nearly 157,000 people in the United States are hospitalized with COVID-19, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, exceeding records set in last winter’s surge. Face coverings are one of the few methods we have to protect ourselves and others from COVID-19 – and which ones are worn should be on top of mind, not an afterthought or suggestion. Even if COVID-19 cases begin to decline and restrictions start easing as well, a strong stance on masking would only maintain a sense of security on campus. After all, wearing a different type of mask is not a hefty inconvenience. Accessibility to higher quality masks once was an issue as shortages in supply are ubiquitous, and prices are constantly rising. But as N95 and KN95 masks become more readily available, GW has a responsibility to ensure that individuals wear them on a large scale.

The sandwich comes wrapped in a soft bun covered in a layer of melted butter. 
Tucked inside a small vendor’s booth in Western Market lies Roaming Rooster, which just might offer the best chicken sandwich in D.C.
Situated inside 2000 Pennsylvania Ave., Roaming Rooster offers the food hall’s patrons a quick fix of tasty chicken sandwiches, chicken tenders and wings. While the restaurant may not have the fancy atmosphere or locale appropriate for your next date night, Roaming Rooster is a solid option for a quick lunch or dinner in Foggy Bottom that won’t disrupt your schedule.
Western Market offers a consistently clean and comfortable atmosphere to enjoy your meal alone or with some friends. Plenty of tables were available in the spacious hall when I stopped by for dinner, and during the warmer months the outdoor patio seating makes for a pleasant spot to grab a bite.
Roaming Rooster originally opened in 2015 as a food truck, which quickly expanded into a fleet of three and eventually brick and mortar stores like the one now in Foggy Bottom, according to their website.
Sandwiches fill the menu at Roaming Rooster, with options like the OG Nashville sandwich ($9.29) which is topped with coleslaw and pickles, The Buffalo ($9.49) with blue cheese and buffalo sauce and The Club ($9.99) with bacon, lettuce, tomato and ranch. Patrons can choose between four “heat levels” when ordering chicken, ranging from mild to extra hot. I ordered a mild honey butter chicken sandwich ($9.49) which comes smothered in honey butter along with a slice of cheddar cheese.
I also ordered fries ($3.99) and a bottle of Coke ($2.50) to round out the meal. Unfortunately, Roaming Rooster isn’t on GWorld like other restaurants inside Western Market, but the honey butter sandwich makes it worth the credit card swipe.
The server called my number after about five minutes, and I made my way over to the nearest table to eat. The sandwich, dripping with honey butter and wrapped in a soft bun, was larger than most chicken sandwiches I’ve eaten. The serving of fries was also more than plentiful, and they were delivered inside of a paper cup wrapped in a paper bag, similarly to Five Guys’ presentation.
The first bite of the sandwich nearly froze me like the food critic in Ratatouille when he tastes Remy’s dish – the chicken was perfectly crispy, the bun was warm and soft, the honey butter was delectably sweet but not overpowering and the flavor of the slightly-melted cheddar at the bottom of the sandwich perfectly complemented the buttery chicken. The physical aspects of the sandwich were impressive, too – it didn’t fall apart despite its size, and the bun never became soggy, even with the sandwich covered in a layer of melted butter.
I was born and raised in the South, so I’ve had my fair share of chicken sandwiches, but this one might just be the best I’ve ever had.
In spite of my glowing review of the sandwich, the french fries were at best forgettable and at worst simply bad. I suggest skipping out on the fries opting for the coleslaw as a side ($3.99).
Roaming Rooster doesn’t offer dessert, but nearby options like cannoli from Capo Deli and ice cream and cookies from Captain Cookie could satisfy your sweet tooth after your meal.
The next time you’re walking by Western Market and in need of a quick and tasty meal, stop by Roaming Rooster to give this finger-licking sandwich a try.

Interim University President Mark Wrighton attended Monday's game and was embraced by the team after the win. 
Men’s basketball picked up their first conference win of the season Monday afternoon over local rival George Mason.
In a game of runs, the Colonials (5-10, 1-2 A-10) emerged victorious 78-77 for the first time since Dec. 13 while the Patriots (7-7, 0-1 A-10) dropped their third consecutive game after a 16 day layoff due to postponements.
“You got to respect us every game,” sophomore guard Joe Bamisile said. “I think when you have a losing record, it’s really easy to come play a team and think they’re just going to lay down and die but we’re fighting every game.”
Both teams were missing key players due to injury coming into the Revolutionary Rivalry matchup.
The Colonials were without graduate student guard Brendan Adams, senior forward Ricky Lindo Jr, and sophomore center Noel Brown, all of whom were injured in practice this week. Meanwhile, the Patriots were missing junior forward Josh Oduro, who has led the team in scoring with 17 points per game this season.
“I’ve talked all year long about how resilient our team has been,” head coach Jamion Christian said. “We were obviously missing a few guys today, but we gained so much with the guys that were able to step out there on the floor.”
The game came down to the wire after GW stormed back from a 72-59 deficit with 6:09 remaining. In the last six minutes GW went on an 18-4 run capped off by the game winning layup by Bamisile.
“The whole time we had composure,” Bamisile said. “For me and James, we were talking the whole six minutes like we’re still going to win. We had no doubt we were going to win. We’ve had a great last week of practice so we just wanted to show the world that we really work.”
Bamisile finished with a career-high 26 points, six rebounds, two assists, two blocks and a steal. Junior guard James Bishop also had a strong game on both ends of the floor, scoring 23 points to go along with five rebounds, five assists, three steals and no turnovers.
The Colonials started the game with energy and barely trailed during the first half despite junior forward Hunter Dean picking up two fouls in the first 12 minutes of the game, forcing GW to play a smaller lineup with junior forward Qwanzi Samuels playing as the big man.
Graduate student guard Bryan Knapp saw his most significant action of the season so far, playing 18 minutes in place of the injured Adams and finished with three points on 1-of-5 shooting from the field.
The effects of the 16-day layoff were evident in the first half for George Mason, who trailed 35-31 at halftime. But the momentum flipped coming out of halftime.
Dean picked up a third foul less than a minute into the half and the Patriots scored 20 points in the opening six minutes to jump out to a 51-44 lead.
The defensive and rebounding ability of Lindo was sorely missed by GW, especially in the second half as George Mason outrebounded the Colonials 17-9 and shot 59.4 percent from the field to score 45 points. But the GW offense was able to keep pace and ensure the game didn’t slip away, thanks in large part to a pair of back-to-back threes by Bamisile.
The highlight of Bamisile’s afternoon was a ferocious dunk over sophomore forward Malik Henry to tie the game at 57 with 9:30 remaining that earned him the No. 2 spot in the SportsCenter Top 10 of the day.
Following the dunk, a technical foul was called on Bishop for celebrating Bamsile’s dunk in the face of Henry.
“I was just super excited,” Bishop said. “I just wanted to go crazy and I felt like it was deserving of that.”
But the momentum shifted back to the Patriots, who went on a 13-0 run in the next three minutes.
A few minutes later Bamisile brought the Colonials back by blocking a 3-pointer and throwing down a signature windmill dunk to cut George Mason’s lead to 74-66 with 3:40 remaining in the game.
Dean followed Bamisile’s dunk with one of his own off an alley-oop from Bishop to make it 74-68 going into the final media timeout. Coming out of the timeout, Bamisile drew an offensive foul and the Colonials converted a putback layup from Dean to cut the deficit to 74-70.
The Colonials forced a shot clock violation on the Patriots next possession and reduced the lead to 74-73 thanks to a tough drive to the basket by Bishop, who also drew a foul on the play.
Samuels gave GW a 75-74 lead with a dunk off a feed from Bishop with 28 seconds left. George Mason head coach Kim English called a timeout and drew up a play that gave the Patriots the lead and their first points in over four minutes.
Christian then took a timeout of his own with seven seconds remaining.
Bishop inbounded to Bamisile, who faked a handoff back to Bishop and drove to the basket and finished at the rim to give the Colonials a 77-76 lead with three seconds left. Those would be the last points of the game as George Mason threw the ball out of bounds on the ensuing inbound following a timeout.
The Colonials hit the floor Wednesday at 7 PM at Saint Joseph’s after the game was postponed from Jan. 2 due to COVID-19 protocols.

Athletics officials said this year’s honorees have been supportive of the decision. 
The Hall of Fame Induction ceremony was postponed due to the current Omicron spike in D.C., the Athletic Department announced Monday
Athletic director Tanya Vogel said in a release that the department is still looking for a possible future date to host the induction ceremony and will update participants as the details are set. She said the department had considered an online event but had “quickly ruled it out” as officials thought it was unbefitting for the celebration.
“Unfortunately, however, we are going to have to delay when we celebrate this class in person, she said. “On account of the record caseloads and hot spot that Washington, D.C. has become – and with safety, both physical and emotional, top of mind – it has been decided that it is not prudent to host an in-person induction on February 4th.”
The department released the names of seven individual Colonials being inducted into the GW Athletic Hall of Fame in a release in the fall along with the 1992-93 men’s basketball team and former administrator Karen Ercole. The 2022 class includes a trio of student-athletes who made history by breaking the color barrier at the University.
Associate Athletics director Brian Sereno said this year’s Hall of Famers have been supportive of the University’s decision.
“Regarding our Hall of Famers, they have collectively been understanding and supportive of the postponement until a time when their family, friends and fans can gather with safety as the top priority,” Sereno said in an email.

Nashman Center volunteers lined up in Kogan Plaza and the Mount Vernon Campus quad to hand out free t-shirts and boxed lunches to students throughout the Day of Service.
The University kicked off its weeklong celebration of the life of Martin Luther King Jr. with its annual Day of Service Monday, featuring interim University President Mark Wrighton and D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine.
Speakers at the event talked about King’s political and social legacy in the District, the state of civil rights in the United States and GW’s role in the quest for racial equality. About 250 students participated in the Day of Service event, which included online service events with the Smithsonian Transcription Center, the National Archives’ Citizen Archivist program and the Free Minds Book Club and Writing Workshop – a nonprofit seeking to educate young people who are incarcerated or formerly incarcerated.
Students wrote transcriptions and descriptions of different historical documents and artifacts through the Smithsonian and National Archives, and they provided feedback to the Free Minds Book Club and Writing Workshop on creative works and lessons for incarcerated and formerly incarcerated people.
Wrighton said the United States has not delivered the full level of equality and opportunity that King envisioned during the Civil Rights Movement. He said the Black Lives Matter movement, which prompted nationwide protests against systematic racism and police brutality in 2020, pointed out many widespread issues of racial inequity.
“We’re more than 50 years from the death of Dr. King, but his messages and the Civil Rights Movement more broadly remain just as important as ever, particularly in the wake of important movements such as Black Lives Matter,” he said at the event. “During the past several decades, we have seen some progress in this country, progress in acceptance and equity, but we’ve not yet achieved the truly inclusive community for which Dr. King aspired to see.”
The Nashman Center for Civic Engagement and Public Service hosted the event, which was moderated by Amy Cohen, the executive director of the Nashman Center. Nashman Center volunteers also lined up in Kogan Plaza and the Mount Vernon Campus quad to hand out free t-shirts and boxed lunches to students throughout the Day of Service.
Wrighton said he would commit to expanding need-based scholarships at GW, work with outside organizations to overcome health care disparities and promote equity and inclusion policies during his presidency to lessen the impact of racial inequality at GW and elsewhere. In October 2021, officials launched a new “focused initiative” to make GW more affordable for Pell-eligible students through additional scholarships and fellowships during the next several years.
“Today and every day, we must work together to dismantle systemic racism while developing and deepening a community committed to the values of racial equity, democracy and to care for others that was exemplified by Dr. King,” he said.
Wrighton said GW would not “settle on its accomplishments” when combating inequality and racism, and the community would continue to conduct research and work on finding solutions to current social problems.
“I look forward to working with everyone in this community to strengthen the relationship of GW with the District of Columbia, and I believe that we can make continued progress in the era ahead,” he said.
Racine, the D.C. attorney general, said GW was one of the best schools in the United States to learn about civil rights and economic disparity because of students’ presence in the District and faculty’s involvement in politics and public policy.
“You’re at an extraordinary university with Washington, D.C. as your campus,” he said. “There is nothing that GW professors can’t access, and there’s nothing that you can’t access to get the best education that the world has to offer.”
Racine said the D.C. Office of the Attorney General would continue to advocate for equal opportunities and civil rights in the District. He said voting restrictions that state legislatures have passed since the 2020 presidential election, some of which Racine has challenged in federal court, are racially discriminatory and infringe on voting rights.
“This is why my office, along with other states who are willing to fight for voting rights and fairness, have successfully led coalitions to oppose discriminatory voting laws in Florida, in North Carolina, in Alabama, in Mississippi and in South Carolina,” he said.
Racine said officials like states’ attorneys general can uphold civil rights and expand economic opportunities. He said legal cases against groups like slumlords, landlords who do not regularly maintain their properties, and discriminatory employers help increase opportunities for disenfranchised residents.
“As Dr. King said, ‘Morality cannot be legislated, but behavior can be regulated. Judicial decrees may not change the heart, but they can restrain the heartless,’” he said. “What we seek to do at the Office of Attorney General is use the law to help people who can’t help themselves.”
Interim Provost Chrisopher Bracey, who introduced Wrighton at the event, said students should perform community service in their local communities to learn more about their neighborhoods and the issues that District residents face. He said community engagement and learning about social issues are crucial to academic achievement.
“We are supportive of the efforts of students and faculty to learn from and with our neighbors in D.C. as a way of revitalizing our communities and enhancing our scholarship,” he said. “Developing these relationships helps us to improve our ability to be good neighbors. I hope that you will continue to look beyond your service today and consider how your academic achievements can contribute to the improvement of the world and enhancement of our democracy.”

Wiedefeld said he will continue working on current projects, like the Silver Line extension and relocation of Metro’s headquarters, until his retirement.
The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority announced the retirement of its CEO and general manager Tuesday during a turbulent period for the agency with rail delays and thin ridership during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Paul Wiedefeld will retire in six months, stepping down from his role leading WMATA’s operations as the agency prepares a nationwide search for his replacement to resolve operational issues plaguing the transit system, according to a release from WMATA. The announcement caps off a six-year tenure that culminated with Metrorail delays that are currently set to last for at least six months since WMATA suspended more than half of its rail fleet in October because of wheel issues spotted after a Blue Line derailment.
Wiedefeld said the announcement of his retirement will provide time for Metro’s board of directors to find a leader who can set WMATA on a stable path forward.
“Forty plus years in transportation teaches you that there is no set mile marker for this decision, but given the seismic shifts happening in transit and the region, Metro needs a leader who can commit to several years of service and set a new course.” Wiedefeld said in the release. “This gives the Board time to identify a successor and ensures an orderly management transition.”
Wiedefeld started his tenure as CEO and general manager in 2015 while the agency faced issues similar to today, including long delays and halted trains.
The release credits Wiedefeld with improving rail safety and reliability as well as guiding the agency through the pandemic when WMATA faced financial peril with potential budget cuts after ridership and revenue plummeted. The agency eventually averted the cuts with plans to maintain regular service after receiving federal stimulus funding in 2021.
Wiedefeld said he will continue working on current projects, like the Silver Line extension and relocation of Metro’s headquarters, until his retirement.
Metro has faced a plethora of challenges in recent months, including a Blue Line train derailment near Arlington National Cemetery in October that forced officials to sideline hundreds of 7000-series railcars, crippling the rail system. WMATA officials announced last week that the agency will postpone the return of the 7000-series railcars for at least three months until they determine the root cause of wheel issues that caused the Blue Line derailment.
Paul Smedberg, the chair of WMATA’s board of directors, thanked Wiedefeld in the release for his leadership in helping Metro survive the pandemic.
“There is no doubt that Paul Wiedefeld was the right man at the right time to guide Metro out of very dark days,” Smedberg said. “Paul is an extraordinary executive and the Board deeply appreciates his effective leadership and, most recently, his collaboration with us as we worked together to overcome an unprecedented set of challenges during the pandemic.”
Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., thanked Wiedefeld for his service and called on WMATA’s directors to hire a CEO and general manager focused on transportation safety.
“As the WMATA Board of Directors searches for the next General Manager and CEO, it must focus on finding candidates who are equally committed to maintaining transparency, cooperating with state, local and federal partners, and most importantly, prioritizing safety,” he said in a release.

In-person classes began Tuesday after the University started the spring semester with a week of remote learning.
Free N95 masks are now available to all students, faculty and staff across campus, officials announced in an email Friday.
GW community members can pick up their N95 masks at the University’s COVID-19 testing centers and 15 other spots on campus like the University Student Center, Gelman Library, District House and the Smith Center. Officials said they encourage everyone to wear N95 masks, which will protect them from aerosol transmission of the coronavirus, especially while indoors.
Other campus locations with available N95 masks include the Milken Institute School of Public Health, School of Media and Public Affairs, Science and Engineering, Lerner and Ross halls, Graduate School of Education and Human Development dean’s office and Elliott School of International Affairs, according to GW’s website. Students can also pick up masks at the GW Police Department’s Community Policing Center, the Key Depot, the Mount Vernon Campus Academic Building and on GW’s shuttles.
“The University strongly recommends that you wear a N95 or KN95 mask in classrooms and all indoor University spaces,” the email reads. “If you do not wear an N95 mask, double masking with a cloth and surgical mask is recommended.”
In-person classes began Tuesday after the University started the spring semester with a week of remote learning. Daily COVID-19 cases reached a record high on Jan. 6 as students returned to campus.
Officials said no face covering provides “100 percent protection,” but the N95 mask is more effective at protecting people from the virus than single-layer masks or double masking. Public health experts are also encouraging the use of N95 masks, which filter up to 95 percent of the particles in the air compared to the 75 percent that cloth masks filter.
Officials said students should pick up one mask at a time.
GW community members should remove their N95 mask with clean hands, unfold the mask and pull the bands outward on both ends and position the mask with the metal strip facing up on the nose, according to the email. Officials said students should lightly press the metal strip to make sure they securely seal the mask so that it “fits snugly.”
Students can view an instructional tutorial on how to apply their N95 masks, according to the email.
The email states the N95 masks should not replace other N95 masks or respirators required for fit-testing in occupational settings.
Officials said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has additional information on facial hairstyles that are preferable for N95 masks.
“Facial hair may create a poor seal and can reduce the effectiveness of an N95 mask,” the email states. “It is recommended that there is no facial hair in areas where the mask contacts the face.”
