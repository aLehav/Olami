An array of brand new dining options is set to open in Western Market this fall.
Western Market spokesperson Ali Gorban said Tigerella, an Italian-inspired bar and restaurant, opened its dining room for lunch service Thursday, operating from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Friday. Tigerella’s dinner service is set to open in September, according to the restaurant’s website.
Gorban said Alitiko, a Greek-inspired restaurant, is scheduled to open later this month.
ExPat, a two-floored restaurant, is planned to open later this fall. It will feature a bar where patrons can participate in sports betting on the top floor and a podcast studio, arcade, shuffleboard and karaoke stage on the bottom floor. 
Also opening in the fall is Hippo Taco, an Asian-fusion restaurant, which will feature indoor and outdoor seating options. They plan to cater heavily to the GW community, with the restaurant’s name being a reference to the University’s unofficial mascot coined by students in recent decades. 
Chinese-American vendor Lucky Danger is also slated to open later this year, according to the release.

The first case of monkeypox in the GW community came in June when only 306 cases were reported in the United States. As of July 25, the District leads the country with the highest number of cases per capita, according to D.C. Health. And while this viral infection spreads, so do misinformation and stereotypes. With a large number of monkeypox cases concentrated in the gay community, ongoing rhetoric is perpetuating harmful stigmas about queer people. Blaming monkeypox on gay men and the inaccurate idea of a more sexual LGBTQ+ community fuels lies instead of slowing the disease. To combat this virus, GW should use language that dismantles social stigmas and informs students that everyone is susceptible to monkeypox.
It is undeniable that monkeypox is mostly reported among men who have sex with other men in the United States. Ninety-nine percent of monkeypox cases occur in men, and 94 percent of them engage in sexual intimacy with other men, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. These statistics are not the issue – the issue is how these statistics are used to demonize the queer community. Language like “gay disease” perpetuates the narrative that gay men are to blame for monkeypox and homophobic hate crimes in the past month prove its danger. Misinformation circling social media also suggests this virus is a sexually transmitted infection that hypersexualizes queer people and leaves the rest with a false notion of immunity.
Africa, where monkeypox originated, has little evidence that any demographic is disproportionately affected in the continent. When it comes to monkeypox in Africa, sexuality is not an indicator of risk. Monkeypox has been endemic, spreading through small amounts of people in the continent since 1970, according to the CDC. African health officials report that the virus spreads more commonly in confined spaces and between animals that spread it to people around them. The criminalization of homosexuality in most African countries is the main reason that reports do not show monkeypox being contracted by queer people. Just because the United States is experiencing most cases in queer people does not mean that monkeypox is a “gay disease.”
On Sunday, someone who allegedly used anti-gay slurs while referencing monkeypox attacked a couple in D.C. While they sustained non-life-threatening injuries from the assault, this hateful act is unacceptable. If conversations surrounding monkeypox continue to blame a community in its entirety for the virus, more disgusting violence will continue. Similar to how hate crimes against Asian Americans increased with a rise in COVID-19 cases, it is incorrect and hurtful to blame a group of people for a worldwide virus. Gay men are not to blame for monkeypox, and they do not deserve to be assaulted, ridiculed or blamed because of the spread of it.
Casting blame on gay men for monkeypox also lulls the rest of the general public into a false sense of immunity. If people believe that only gay men will contract the virus, they are less likely to take precautions against it, like using condoms, limiting anonymous sexual partners or wearing masks. Similar to HIV/AIDS, anyone is at risk of infection, but lack of that knowledge is dangerous. Women started contracting HIV/AIDS when they had sex with men whom they didn’t know were having sex with other men. But since society accepted it as a “gay disease,” the first women to experience symptoms either did not know they had HIV/AIDS or were denied access to treatment due to disbelief among health care professionals. Eventually, AIDS became the leading cause of death for Black women ages 25 to 44 years. Everyone needs to be safe and recognize they too are at risk of monkeypox infection.
Another misconception is that monkeypox is a sexual transmitted infection. It is spread through close skin-to-skin contact and through bodily fluids. Monkeypox has the potential to spread through hugging, cuddling, kissing, clothes and bedding. Even if one is not having sex with a man, visiting their dorm room, sitting on their bed, borrowing a shirt or dancing with someone at a party could transmit the disease. In July, a professor at the University of Texas Dallas tweeted, “​​Can we at least try to find a cure for homosexuality, especially among men?” after suggesting that monkeypox is an STI. While the tweet has since been deleted and the professor has been condemned for spreading misinformation and homophobia, this is a perfect example of how lack of knowledge is dangerous. The public needs to know that there are other ways of contracting the virus or else they will not know how to keep themselves safe.
GW officials sent an email to students Wednesday explaining the causes, symptoms and treatment of monkeypox to students. While their communication of the logistics of the virus is commendable, no steps were taken to address its social effects. Staying silent will not combat the narrative that monkeypox is a “gay disease.” The University should promote more inclusive conversations among its students and staff by starting them. It is imperative to be aware of public health recommendations, like limiting the number of sexual partners one has while understanding that condoms also won’t guarantee protection. GW must be incredibly clear that people of all sexualities and gender identities can contract it. As students return to campus, they deserve to make informed decisions concerning their sex lives.
Assuming monkeypox will forever be limited to only gay men is not just a naive way of thinking, but it also piles on guilt, shame and blame to that community. We cannot wait to take this virus seriously until its spread widens even further. Ultimately, World Health Organization Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it best. “Stigma and discrimination can be as dangerous as any virus.”

This will be the first full school year in which students will be able to use U-Pass.
Students can pick up their U-Pass cards as early as August 18 as the program begins its first full academic year, according to a University announcement.
The cards will activate August 20, and students will have access to free trips on Metrobus and Metrorail through December 23. The U-Pass program, announced last November after years of student advocacy, completed its first full semester in May, with students taking more than 700,000 cumulative Metro trips using the cards.
“Utilizing U•Pass® helps save you money when you ride Metrorail or Metrobus, can save you time with your commute by not having to drive, and helps take more cars off the road as we focus on sustainability and better air quality,” GW’s website states.
Upperclassmen students will be able to pick up their cards on their move-in date at nearly all upperclassmen residence halls. Pick-up locations include District House, JBKO, Munson, Fulbright, Amsterdam, South, FSK and Shenkman halls, the Dakota and 1959 E Street. Freshmen will be able to pick up their cards at their residence hall on their move in day.
General distribution for U-Pass cards will be located at the University Student Center on Aug. 26, 29, 30 and 31 for students either living off-campus or students who did not pick up their cards when they moved in. An exclusive time slot for graduate students to pick up their U-Pass cards will be held in the University Student Center on Aug. 24.

The D.C. Council’s transportation committee approved legislation last month attempting to improve bicyclist and walker safety. 
The Metropolitan Police Department identified the pedestrian who died after being struck by a driver on the 2100 block of Virginia Ave. earlier this month.
Timothy Fingarson, a 66-year-old from Charles Town, West Virginia, was crossing Virginia Avenue from E Street near the south end of the Foggy Bottom Campus at about 4:10 p.m. Aug. 3 when an unidentified driver hit him, the Washington Post reported Thursday. MPD reported that Fingarson walked outside the crosswalk when the driver struck him, and Fingarson later died in hospital care.
Fingarson’s death came two weeks after another driver struck a cyclist, Shawn O’Donnell, near the north end of the Foggy Bottom campus at the corner of 21st and I Streets, resulting in her death.
The D.C. Council’s transportation committee approved legislation last month attempting to improve bicyclist and walker safety through actions like prohibiting vehicles from making right turns on red lights and allowing bikers to treat stop signs as yield signs.

“Bullet Train” is far from a perfect film – and isn’t that close to a great one either – but at the end of the day, it provides enough visually stimulating flair and irreverent entertainment to earn the rank of a satisfying summer action movie.
Summer is coming to a close, so what better way to ride out the warm months with “Bullet Train,” a true popcorn movie with fast-paced action and quirky characters that will entertain just about any audience.
“Bullet Train” doesn’t offer much in terms of deep storytelling with complex characters, but it doesn’t really have to. The latest blockbuster in Brad Pitt’s dense filmography, the film is an action comedy with visual flair that will deliver audiences a high-adrenaline experience, albeit with more style than substance.
An adaption of a popular Japanese novel, “Bullet Train” features Ladybug – an assassin played by Brad Pitt – boarding, you guessed it, a Tokyo bullet train with the mission of receiving a mysterious money-filled briefcase guarded by more assassins, Tangerine, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Lemon, portrayed by Brian Tyree Henry. That’s just about all the information you’re given as the film starts, but the plot quickly unfolds into a web of double-crossing, organized crime and even more assassins after the briefcase.
Pitt, Taylor-Johnson and Henry aren’t the only stars on board. “Bullet Train” features an all-star ensemble brimming with chaotic energy that matches the campy vibe of the movie perfectly. “The Kissing Booth” lead Joey King, Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny and iconic Japanese action star Hiroyuki Sanada all shine in supporting roles, alongside a plethora of cameos from prominent actors that I won’t spoil.
The cast, for the most part, delivers entertaining performances that help bolster the film’s tongue-in-cheek feel. The same can’t be said for Pitt, who gives a fine performance, but not one that captures his greatest strengths as an actor.
Pitt is more equipped for cool and suave characters, unlike Ladybug – a former assassin who later went to therapy out of guilt for his crimes and spends most of the movie apologetic and bewildered with anxiety-induced reactions to most of the events in the film. Ladybug’s demeanor is an admittedly fresh take on your typical action protagonist, but one that might have been better suited for an actor like William Jackson Harper or Robert Downey Jr.
The writing, which I consider to be the film’s weakest element, doesn’t help either. The film embodies cheesiness and camp, yet the majority of the dialogue is sterile, unmemorable and uninspired, much more along the lines of a mediocre Marvel movie. An exception can be made for Henry and Taylor-Johnson, whose chemistry is enough to carry some otherwise weak attempts at witty banter.
That being said, few will come to “Bullet Train” for an Oscar-winning script. The highly stylized – and highly violent – fight scenes absolutely deliver as the main appeal of the film through director David Leitch’s phenomenal action direction.
Reminiscent of the works of Quinten Tarantino and Shane Black, “Bullet Train” supplies captivating visual flare through action scenes, with plentiful use of long shots and close-ups that make each fight a joy to watch. But the film’s brawls also ooze creativity – each fight bringing much more than simple punching and kicking, but instead clever battles with objects like poison and water bottles. No two action set-pieces are the same, adding new and individually intense stakes to each fight.
In one such battle, characters duel in the train’s quiet car and must adhere to the vehicle’s strict rules, forcing them to be stealthy. Both dish and incur pain without making a sound, and the fights get only stranger from there.
Outside of the action, Leitch’s direction in the movie is hit or miss. Leitch, who also directed “Deadpool 2,” employs liberal use of cutaways, on-screen text and fourth wall breaks, which work well with the bizarre atmosphere at times. But mostly, the direction feels more “tell, don’t show,” lacking more subtle, strategic storytelling for viewers to decipher independently, an unfortunate approach for someone who is usually a very visually talented director.
As many problems as I had with this movie, I’d be lying if I said any of them had a huge role in dampening my enjoyment, as “Bullet Train”’s primary strength is that it simply does not take itself too seriously. The movie revels in its cheesy plot and cliché lines, savors every wink-at-the-camera directional decision and allows its cast to be as over the top as they possibly can. Yes, these factors make “Bullet Train” a profoundly stupid movie at times, yet it remains contagious in its vitality throughout its runtime.
“Bullet Train” is far from a perfect film – and isn’t that close to a great one either – but at the end of the day, it provides enough visually stimulating flair and irreverent entertainment to earn the rank of a satisfying summer action movie.

While the GW community eyes the future of a storied residence hall with new glamor, darker headlines in D.C. overshadow the anticipation of students’ return to the nation’s capital.
One week before Thurston Hall reopens for the first time in more than two years, promising photos of the facility indicate a long construction process is set to pay off for 800 new residents. On the citywide level, Mayor Muriel Bowser secured funding to combat the effects of climate change, like power outages caused by severe storms. 
But another pair of headlines in the city underlined systemic issues facing D.C. and the entire country. Bowser’s inability to deploy the National Guard left local migrants without emergency support and a hateful attack against a couple stemmed from homophobia and misinformation about the monkeypox epidemic.
To catch you up, here are the best and worst of this week’s headlines:
Thumbs Up:
Thurston Hall’s renovation appears to be near completion for GW’s move-in weekend just around the corner. Several stories of floor-to-ceiling windows overlook an open outdoor space. Sixteen lounges will provide students with ample area for their study time. A rooftop overlooks the D.C. skyline, shaped by the Washington Monument, National Cathedral and Eisenhower Executive Office Building. In a tweet posted Monday, Peter Sacco, the executive director of the Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission, shared images that should excite incoming freshmen who can breathe a big sigh of relief at the nearly finished product of their residence hall. Campus housing at GW has not always been safe or up to the standards that students deserve. Let’s hope this version of Thurston Hall is much different than the one that became notorious for its black mold.
Bowser announced Wednesday that she secured $20 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help reverse the effects of climate change in D.C. As the District continues to experience power outages due to thunderstorms that cause floods and fallen trees, funding more resilient infrastructure is imperative. Bowser has stressed that rainfall, natural hazards and frequent storms are all increasing, and this funding can help protect the people of D.C. who lack safe homes. D.C. has outlined the spending of this money, which will help restore tidal wetlands in Watts Branch and retrofit homes for possible flood damage in the future. This concrete outline promises a better chance of progress. Climate change cannot be taken lightly.
Thumbs Down:
The governors of Texas and Arizona started transporting hundreds of migrants to D.C. four months ago as a form of criticism of President Joe Biden and his immigration policy. The influx of migrants seeking asylum is overwhelming the District, but the Department of Defense denied Bowser’s request for National Guard support last week. If approved, the National Guard would process, feed and sanitize local migrants while managing the armory that would connect them to a permanent housing destination. Bowser cannot deploy the National Guard herself as a city mayor without statehood in D.C., an emblem of the painful lack of power in the city. Meanwhile, the migrants are left to sleep homeless outdoors, mostly around Union Station, with little to no food, water, clothes or shelter.
Metropolitan Police Department officers are investigating a suspected hate crime against two men who were physically assaulted and verbally harassed with homophobic slurs with reference to monkeypox last weekend. The District has the highest number of monkeypox cases per capita in the United States as of July 25, according to D.C. Health. Since gay men make up most of the people who contract monkeypox in the United States, they are facing violence from people who blame them for the virus. GW officials sent an email to students about the transmissibility and treatment of monkeypox, but it failed to mention the social impacts. As students come back to campus in the near future, they need to know about preventive methods like limiting sexual partners. Queer students need better guidance for this virus as they face increased risk and encounter acts of hatred.

The well cooked, crispy curry chicken combined with the elastic and chewy noodles to create a distinctive and fulfilling texture pairing as I dove into the dish.
While ramen is often served in simplistic, modest Japanese restaurants, Toki Underground’s hippie furnishings and weekly anime nights will redefine your ramen-eating experience in every way.
Toki Underground delves into the Japanese hippie underground culture with mainstream Japanese-style decor, ranging from the artistic graffiti of the restaurant logo to a spread of colorful stickers that bring a funky yet stylish vibe to the interior. The restaurant celebrates Japanese-inspired, Taiwanese-style dishes and offers events like “Weeb Wednesday” when I visited – a day where customers can watch anime on screen under dimmer lighting as they enjoy a selection of discounted drinks and food during happy hour.
For an appetizer, I ordered fried chicken steam buns (two for $10, four for $15) – two conjoined Asian buns with sweet chili sauce, seasonal pickles, cilantro and thai basil. For all those pickles lovers, this is a must-try along with a similar but vegetarian option, the sake-battered cauliflower steam buns.
Toki Underground features an authentic and aromatic tonkotsu, a broth of boiled pork meat and bones, that creates a thick and hearty soup with a meaty flavor. Scallions, beni shoga – a japanese red-pickled ginger – sesame seeds and nori are served as toppings that elevate the broth’s flavor.
I ordered Taipei curry chicken ramen ($19), made with the tonkotsu broth, which is one of the most expensive ramen dishes on the menu. The dish, along with all ramen plates, is discounted to $14 during happy hour, which lasts from 5 to 7 p.m. every Wednesday.
Shallots, greens, a soft poached egg and seaweed adorned the top of the ramen while also partially sinking into the broth. A thin layer of roasted sesame seeds garnished the bowl, spreading a subtle smell of caramelized hazelnuts without any disturbance of the rich smell of pork broth sitting underneath.
The well cooked, crispy curry chicken combined with the elastic and chewy noodles to create a distinctive and fulfilling texture pairing as I dove into the dish. I loved how the layout of the bowl gradually transitioned from the softest to chewiest ingredient – from the poached egg to the fried curry chicken to the noodle. The meal made for an easy and smooth-tasting meal.
Food aside, Toki Underground also offers a wide selection of wine with an emphasis on Japanese whisky and sake. The non-alcoholic selections – including apple soda and watermelon and mint juice – are sourced predominantly from Japan and Taiwan.
I ordered the Toki Monster cocktail ($14) which contains Japanese whisky, vanilla-orange syrup, bitters and grilled pork belly. A small piece of rich but not so fatty grilled pork belly on a stick was placed on the whisky cup, which serves as a sweet add-on to the already drier, smokier taste of Japanese whisky.
Toki Underground illuminates an artistic, underground aspect of Japanese culture while craftily blending traditional Japanese and Taiwanese cuisine to craft a substantial meal and fresh atmosphere.

Officials said students who suspect they may have monkeypox should contact a health care provider or the Student Health Center.
Officials shared a public health update on the spread of monkeypox in an email to the GW community Wednesday.
The email states that cases of monkeypox, a viral infection that causes skin lesions, among the GW community remain “very low,” but that it is important to understand how the virus spreads in light of a rise in cases in DC and across the country. Officials announced the GW community’s first case of monkeypox in June.
“While MPX can be painful, severe complications from MPX infection are rare, and to date there have been no deaths related to MPX in the United States,” the email states. “However, it is important to learn about this infection, how it spreads and the resources available to support your health and safety as MPX cases in D.C. and across the country have risen in recent weeks.”
The email states that monkeypox is spread through direct and indirect contact with skin lesions and that symptoms, such as a rash, fever and fatigue, typically occur 7-14 days after exposure to the virus.
“It is important to understand that at this time, the primary mode of transmission is skin-to-skin contact in very close social activities like kissing, dancing, or cuddling,” the email states. “While this contact can occur in the context of sexual activity, MPX is not a sexually transmitted disease, and condoms are not protective.”
The email states that monkeypox vaccines and treatment options are currently available in D.C. but that supplies are limited. D.C. Health postponed administering second doses of the monkeypox vaccine in July due to shortages in supplies and a rise in cases.
“People at high risk for MPX who meet eligibility requirements may be able to receive a vaccine through D.C. Health,” the email states. “Pharmaceutical treatments may be prescribed only to those who have been diagnosed by a health provider with MPX.”
The email states that students who suspect they have contracted monkeypox should contact a health care provider or the Student Health Center, formerly the Colonial Health Center, for more information.
“As we prepare to welcome more members of our community to campus this fall, the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff remains our foremost priority,” the email states. “Thank you for helping to support the continued wellbeing of our campus community.”

SA Senators unanimously approved Carille Walcott and Hamzah Niazi for the GWSB-G seats, ending their application period.
The Student Association Senate filled two vacancies in its final scheduled meeting of the summer Monday.
SA Senators unanimously approved Carille Walcott and Hamzah Niazi for the GWSB-G seats, ending their application period. Executive Vice President Yan Xu said he expects to fill “almost every remaining” vacancy in the next round of applications, due Aug. 12, which have been vacant since last spring’s election when no one ran for the positions.
Walcott, a part-time second-year student in the graduate school of business who works in construction, said she hopes to be “intentional” in her participation in the GW community by strengthening part-time students’ relationships with the campus community.
“I have found that interacting in person with my colleagues provides the best working environment for me since collaboration on building is more effective for me this way,” she said.
Niazi, a second-year graduate student in the school of business, was not present for the meeting, but he submitted a written statement saying he is “excited and passionate” about joining the senate.
SA President Christian Zidouemba said District House’s basement dining space would open on time for the fall semester. He said the Thurston Hall dining facility would open “within a short time” after the beginning of the fall semester.
The next Senate meeting will be on Aug. 29 at 8:30 p.m. in the Elliott School State Room.
