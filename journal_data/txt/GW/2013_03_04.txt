The University’s top safety officials said searches of several residence halls across campus on Monday were regular, scheduled inspections that led to one drug bust in a Greek townhouse, and happened to overlap with a drug and alcohol bust in Thurston Hall.
Officers found marijuana and alcohol Monday during “routine” health and safety inspections of the Alpha Episilon Pi townhouse, located on 22nd Street, Senior Associate Vice President for Safety and Security Darrell Darnell said. He said after inspectors found the illegal substances, they called in officers to conduct an administrative search around 2:30 p.m.
Officers also investigated reports of a “suspicious smell” that led to an administrative search in Thurston Hall around 9 p.m., University Police Chief Kevin Hay said. He said it had no connection to health and safety inspections, which take place in every hall once each spring.
Students were reported to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities in both cases, but not to the Metropolitan Police Department, according to the crime log.
Hay said no other health and safety inspections took place after hours, and no other drugs or alcohol were confiscated during inspections or administrative searches Monday. He added that an officer was called in to unlock a residence Monday, but did not participate in the inspection.
“GWPD officers do not accompany Health and Safety inspectors on inspections,” Hay said in an email.
Hundreds of tweets, Facebook posts, and fraternity and sorority listserv emails fueled rumors Monday and Tuesday about residence hall “raids.” Dozens of students reported that the room searches were in connection to a list obtained by UPD from a student suspected of dealing drugs.
Asked about widespread drug-related searches, Hay said, “This simply did not occur,” and reiterated that officers were only involved the Thurston Hall case.
President of Alpha Epsilon Pi Nate Kropp said “nothing improper was found in AEPI controlled areas.”
“As you are probably aware, health and safety inspections of individual students’ rooms have no bearing on our Chapter so it would be inappropriate for me to comment on such a search in 605 22nd Street, just as it would be in any other University housing facility,” Kropp added in an email.
Two students said they saw officers searching the Alpha Epsilon Pi townhouse on 22nd Street between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. The students, who asked to remain anonymous, said officers left the building carrying four boxes with some bongs and pipes visible.
A routine inspection led to an administrative search Friday in West Hall, revealing multiple fraudulent identification cards, marijuana residue and two electric stun guns.

The District’s alcohol board is reviewing applications for two local pharmacies to sell beer and wine.
 The CVS and Walgreens stores along Connecticut Avenue are applying for “Class B” liquor licenses from the city’s Alcoholic Beverage Control Board. The stores would have to set aside 50 percent – or at least 6,000 square feet – of their shelf space for fresh meat, fruits, vegetables and dairy products to fall under the category of a grocery store.
Under the license, no more than 15 percent of a store’s sales may come from beer and wine purchases, according to the Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration.
The board held a public hearing Feb. 28, in which local grocers and city officials suggested changes to the current requirements, and the public can continue to submit suggestions to the board up to March 8.
One CVS in the District and two Walgreens stores already have licenses to sell beer and wine.
Managers at the CVS in the Shops at 2000 Penn declined a request to comment on whether they would consider applying for a liquor license.
While the Walgreens by the Van Ness Metro station and CVS in Woodley Park are pushing for “Class B” liquor licenses, more than 30 businesses with “Class A” licenses – liquor stores that sell spirits in addition to beer and wine – have begun to sell alcohol seven days a week.
In December 2012, D.C. joined 37 states nationwide in abolishing laws prohibiting alcohol sales on Sundays.

Whether you blame the White House or Congress for its inability to cut a deal over the sequester, the federal government got orders Friday to shave $85 billion from its budget. Luckily, GW is prepared to absorb the effects of the shrinking federal funding: The University saw a 4.6 percent increase in research dollars this year and has a significant amount of cash on hand in case of any cuts in federal funding. This means the University will likely be more insulated than other institutions of higher education.
Former GW Law School Dean Paul Schiff Berman took a new position last November as vice provost for online education and academic innovation. Faculty told The Hatchet in February that there was friction between Berman and professors, who were on the verge of conducting a vote of no confidence against the dean.
The professors did not indicate any problems with Berman’s initiatives. Rather, they were concerned by the lack of dialogue between the dean and the faculty and his supposed unwillingness to collaborate on major initiatives.
Regardless of the accusations and tensions, unrest in the law school can only harm students. Whoever the University chooses as the next leader of the law school, we hope he or she will make a more concerted effort to maintain a dialogue with faculty.
The University Career Center is in the midst of an overhaul, focusing on reaching out to more employers to recruit GW students.
The combination of new programs and the hiring of Associate Assistant Provost Rachel Brown, who started overseeing the department last month, are encouraging. While past students would have benefitted from these ideas, it is a promising move for future students.
The names of individuals who could soon head the University’s largest college are being kept under wraps. After initially announcing that the six candidates to replace Columbian College of Arts and Sciences Dean Peg Barratt this May would hold public meetings, administrators reversed course.
It is understandable that the University wants the process to remain as confidential as possible during the early stages so that applicants will not feel as though their current positions are in jeopardy. But setting a precedent of decision-making in secrecy is harmful to the community, especially since candidates have been disclosed in the past dean searches.
It’s a shame that the University has decided to forgo transparency in this decision because all students – save for the select few who have been privy to private meetings – will not have the opportunity to acquaint themselves with the candidates or voice their concerns before a final decision is made.

The Hatchet incorrectly stated that the sequester entailed $85 million in cuts. That number is actually $85 billion. We regret this error.

The GW Law School’s version of “Saturday Night Live,” called “Law Revue,” sold itself as a show of snark and humor, a break from the stresses of school.
The effort was tremendous, poking fun at common law school experiences. But for all the clever inside jokes about courses, study habits and school events on Feb. 23, I heard something else too.
In front of administrators, faculty and fellow students, the actors despaired at their chances of securing legal jobs.
This was a cry for help. What began with humor ended in bitterness.
There was “How Screwed You Are” based on the One Direction hit, “What Makes You Beautiful,” adapted by Corey Ershow, the show’s director.
“You will be begging for jobs like you won’t believe,” the song went. “You don’t know … you don’t know how screwed you are.”
Then, there was Trent Buatte’s “We Learned Law,” set to Rihanna’s “We Found Love.”
“We learned law in a hopeless place, employment fell at a record pace, we learned law in a hopeless place, only doors slammin’ in your face,” they sang.
In the middle of the show, an actor said “I need a job.”
“Me too!” an audience member yelled back.
These performances were meant to be funny. But sitting through skit after skit, each decrying the job prospects of law graduates, left me wondering whether anyone else in the room had the same unease about the message of the show.
And with Interim Dean Gregory Maggs sitting in the audience, the message was direct and clear: Despite all the programs, initiatives, info sessions and resources, students are scared.  The administration has a duty to respond.
There’s an argument to be made that the legal job market is beyond the control of anyone who was gathered in that room, that it is weak and that no matter what GW does, its students will have a tough time come May.
I don’t buy it. I don’t buy that a school with some of the most impressive legal minds can’t innovate to help its students.
Innovate by changing the curriculum, by individualizing education, by changing enrollment levels, by increasing programs that target non-traditional legal jobs and by aggressively matching employers to students.
At the very least, any dean – interim or otherwise – should guarantee that the Pathways to Practice program that pays alumni to gain work experience will continue beyond next year.
I don’t think law students are “screwed” or “hopeless.” And as a student, I’m betting real money on it. But if I were a law dean who watched that show, I would work extra hard to make that case.

When I first heard my friends were using the new dating app Tinder, I thought, “Finally. Grindr for everyone.”
Tinder matches users within a close radius to each other by displaying a few pro- file pictures from Facebook
accompanied by a list of their mutual friends and interests.
However, it’s more than an app – it’s a game. With minimal information about someone, you determine if you would like to “keep playing” by pressing a green heart. If you’re not interested, you simply press a red X, at which point the word “nope” flashes across the screen.
Dating can be uncomfortable and awkward, and some people simply don’t like putting themselves out there. That’s why Tinder can be a tempting and convenient option for some people.
But as an app intended to spark immediate connections, Tinder removes a very critical step: the initial feeling of discomfort and unease of all new relationships.
Yes, dating can be daunting at first, but that nervousness is also what makes it fun. Instead of pushing both sides out of their comfort zones, Tinder sidesteps any initial awkwardness by eliminating the need to gather the courage to introduce yourself to a person.
Tinder acts as a shield against rejection. You can hide behind your iPhone instead of asking someone out. It’s a buffer against the awkward moments when you’re unsure whether you should introduce yourself or continue hanging on to the wall.
Dating isn’t easy, but it’s this difficulty that also makes it worthwhile.
Whether Tinder will become a way for future generations to meet their spouses or if it’s just a passing fad, I’m not sure. But one thing I know is that relationships are complicated and intimate, and the process of seeking partners to share this experience with is often enigmatic.
But reducing an integral aspect of the dating experience to something you play on your phone diminishes the thrill of approaching a new person for the first time and actually working up the courage to ask him or her out on a date. Technology is supposed to make life easier, but by adding shortcuts, we actually take away the raw humanity of the experience – the high that comes with dating.
Just because something is uncomfortable doesn’t mean it isn’t worth it.

It’s a nerve-wracking time to be a high school senior.
Across the country, seniors are waiting anxiously to hear back from their dream colleges. And for many, that school is GW.
I remember what it was like four years ago, checking the mail daily to see if the envelope I received from my dream college was large and full of promise, or sealed in a small package, an envelope tiny enough to just hold the single leaf offering regrets.
Around the time four years ago, I received a barrage of advice from college students and graduates alike. But I was never told how to choose a school based on the metrics that signal growth in a university.
I chose to go to GW based on the metrics I thought had the most value: I optimized GW’s District location, the perceived quality of my department and the fact that the cherry blossoms were in full, gorgeous bloom when I came to tour campus.
I failed, however, to consider my degree’s long-term value. Because when you’re looking at prospective schools, it’s not enough to think about how it will benefit you today, but how it will serve you after you graduate.
Whether you’re a high school senior, considering switching your major or looking to transfer from GW entirely, there are a few helpful indicators of university growth to look out for.
Student-faculty ratio is crucial.
There are always exceptions, but the best learning happens in small classes with involved discussions. It’s also a factor in national rankings, eyed by people who know what matters most in a diploma.
Student-faculty ratio, and on top of that, the number of professor hires to a certain department or school, speaks volumes about a university’s goals for the future. You don’t have to mine through the academic strategic plan to know some of GW’s own academic priorities. Just look at the number of professors hired to make the best of the upcoming Science and Engineering Hall.
In addition, look into how much of that faculty is full-time. At GW, adjunct professors are very influential. Whether or not you’re fortunate enough to take classes from a part-time professor and NASA scientist or someone who works at the New York Times, the University’s D.C. location is primed to welcome the best possible adjunct faculty. But if research matters to you, consider that adjuncts are not expected to take on a research load or advise students.
Ask yourself what metrics you care about when it comes to professors. Find out how diverse the faculty is, their political views, prior experience, race or gender. Look to see if they are widely recognized for your specific interests.
Endowment and fundraising determine a university’s growth. Look at a school’s current endowment, and projected endowment through capital campaigns. Any school that seeks to stay competitive and evolve will be push forward with fundraising in a big way. New hires mean a school like GW is moving in a positive direction, which could mean a higher ranking and stronger reputation down the road.
Choosing a school is tough, and going with what feels right for you might be the best metric of all. I attribute my happiness at GW as much to my major as my luck with my freshman year roommate assignment and involvement in student organizations. But still, there’s no substitute for a school that’s on the rise.
So take a look and see how your dream school adds up. You might be surprised by the answers you find.

The University will partner with one of D.C.’s flagship theaters to explore the artistic and academic meaning of the Civil War on its 150th anniversary.
The National Civil War Project will link GW with Arena Stage to create courses, seminars and a dozen Civil War productions over the next three years to examine modern and historical warfare.
Alumna Liz Lerman, a renowned choreographer who earned her Master of Arts degree in dance from GW in 1982, spearheaded the nationwide project. It will also kick off similar efforts at the University of Maryland and Harvard and Emory universities in collaboration with local theaters.
“This is a groundbreaking – what I would term – ‘radical collaboration,’ ” Molly Smith, artistic director of Arena Stage, said Thursday. “By the end of this project, we’ll have a significant body of Civil War plays and projects. These projects will be informed by the scholars we’re working with, and will be richer because of the intersection between scholars and artists.”
Student playwrights and performers will compete starting next year for a $1,000 commission to produce a Civil War-themed production at Arena Stage, the nation’s largest company focusing on American work.
Interdisciplinary classes on the Civil War in arts, history and social sciences will also take off at GW in fall 2014. Those courses could be offered as University Writing, Writing in the Disciplines or special topics courses. GW will also host a national conference on the topic at Arena Stage in December.
Lerman announced the project Thursday at Arena Stage with University President Steven Knapp.
“This project will serve as a national model for collaborations in the future at other universities and in other cities across the country besides our initial four cities,” Knapp said.
Leslie Jacobson, a professor of theater, has spent two years setting up the project with the help of professors mostly from the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences.
She said the project could also expand to the GW School of Nursing and the Elliott School of International Affairs by tying the concept of civil wars to modern political discussion.
“We seem to be in some sort of gridlock now in this nation about how to move forward. If it isn’t an actual violent war with enemies, it’s a war of ideas seeming to be totally incompatible with each other,” Jacobson said. “We are using the arts to have a meaningful dialogue about the Civil War, and wars in our past, present and future.”
University spokeswoman Angela Olson said the project would be funded by the partner schools, donations and grants, but declined to reveal the total projected cost of the initiative.
For GW, it’s also a big opportunity to build up its emphasis on arts and humanities alongside investments in science and engineering.
The University also has ties with city art institutions such as the Phillips Collection and the Smithsonian Institution. It started up an arts initiative last year, bringing artists-in-residence to campus and trying to make GW more of a hub for arts and cultural study.
“It may sound small, but the universities and theaters that are in the same city – they don’t get to spend time in each other’s worlds enough,” Lerman said at the event. She is also producing a dance-theater piece called “Healing Wars,” which looks at the impact of war on doctors and psychologists who help heal battle wounds.
Kerric Harvey, an associate professor of media and public affairs, said she will develop a course on the topic and work with students to write a play that will be performed at Civil War sites around D.C.
She said she saw the announcement as not only a signal that the University supports the arts and social sciences, but also that it recognizes the relationship between the two fields.
“You can’t understand what people have done unless you understand how they feel,” she added.
