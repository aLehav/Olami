Sophomore Karina Ochoa Berkley, the captain of the Mock Trial team and a Hatchet opinions writer, created a petition last month in hopes of reinstating the pre-law advising position, which was eliminated amid budget cuts. Parth Kotak, the president of the Pre-Law Student Association and The Hatchet’s managing editor, said he plans to create an alumni database to create a network for students who are interested in law school.

Officials initially set this year’s meeting for Oct. 7 last winter before any COVID-19 restrictions were put into place, according to the website.
Officials have set Nov. 18 as the new date for the virtual Faculty Assembly meeting after postponing it from this Wednesday.
University President Thomas LeBlanc and Arthur Wilson, the chair of the Faculty Senate’s executive committee, said in a statement last week that since the meeting must be held virtually this year, officials needed more time to ensure that any votes taken during the meeting are “fair, complete and transparent.” Officials initially set this year’s meeting for Oct. 7 last winter before any COVID-19 restrictions were put into place, according to the website.
“Senate leadership and staff are working hard with IT personnel and the administration to identify and test reliable solutions that can allow a virtual assembly,” the website states.

Officials announced in March that undergraduates would be able to take “most” classes as pass/fail after moving all classes to an online format.
Officials said just more than half of all undergraduates and nearly a third of all graduate students took at least one class last semester as Pass/No Pass or Credit/No Credit.
University spokesperson Crystal Nosal said 50.8 percent of undergraduate students and 31.2 percent of graduate students took at least one class as pass/fail or Credit/No Credit. She said 96 percent of courses taken pass/fail by undergraduates resulted in course grades of “P” and 87.6 percent of courses taken Credit/No Credit by graduate students resulted in course grades of “CR.”
Officials announced in March that undergraduates would be able to take “most” classes as pass/fail after moving all classes to an online format. GW Law officials also moved all classes to the Credit/No Credit format last semester, and Nosal said officials from the School of Medicine and Health Sciences continued to assign letter grades.
Nosal said the remainder of students who did not receive a pass or credit grade who requested to take a class as pass/fail or Credit/No Credit received a “combination” of no pass grades, incompletes and withdrawals.
“In spring 2020, students were afforded the opportunity to see their grades and then pick-and-choose which, if any, grades to replace with a P or NP,” she said in an email. “In addition, the criteria for making the dean’s list was relaxed for spring 2020.”
She said officials saw a “sharp increase” in the number of students who were eligible for the dean’s list last semester, which she said was a result of changes like the pass/fail and Credit/No Credit option and a more “relaxed” criteria to opt in to the pass/fail policy.
“Along with these changes, we saw a sharp increase in the number of students eligible for making the dean’s list in spring 2020 with prior semesters,” she said. “We had fewer full-time students, but a larger percentage of them were dean’s list-eligible in spring 2020.”
She said 47.4 percent of students made the Dean’s List in spring 2020 compared to 25.9 percent in spring 2019. From fall 2018 to fall 2019, the percentage of students who made the Dean’s List increased by 0.8 percentage points, she said.
Provost Brian Blake sent out a survey to undergraduates and graduate students two weeks ago for feedback on whether officials should implement the policy again this semester, and officials said the majority of undergraduate and graduate students support adopting pass/fail and Credit/No credit policies this fall.
“There is agreement among the provost, deans and faculty that faculty should continue to be mindful of the continuing difficulties presented by the coronavirus, taking care to be flexible, supportive and understanding in working with students who want to remove a grade, request additional time to satisfy course requirements or take a leave of absence,” Nosal said.

Student Association Sen. Thomas Falcigno, CPS-G, said the higher number of applications from graduate students this year might be linked to the absence of a graduate student tuition reduction.
The Student Association Senate received a record number of graduate student senator applications this year.
The governance and nominations committee received 21 applications this fall for specific school seats – the most the senate has received in recent memory. Senators said more graduate students may have applied for these seats because they can more easily access online meetings and push for a graduate tuition discount this fall.
“We are getting specific input from those schools that we usually don’t get senators from about what’s going on and about the issues that they are facing,” said SA Sen. Thomas Falcigno, CPS-G and the chair of the governance and nominations committee. “And that’s a really great thing for the Student Association to make sure we have people on the ground, telling us what’s happening in the schools that we usually don’t get senators from.”
Senators selected eight of the 21 applicants to pitch their interest in the SA at a meeting last week, and the senate confirmed five of those applicants.
The senate approved Antonio Navarello to represent the School of Nursing, Megan Freeman for the Graduate School of Education and Human Development and Mustafa Emin Oktay for the School of Engineering and Applied Science. Caroline Fuss and Connor Hounshell were also chosen as Milken Institute School of Public Health representatives.
Falcigno said members of the governance and nominations committee are holding interviews throughout October to confirm the remaining vacancies in the senate that have now been converted to graduate-at-large positions instead of school-specific seats. After 30 class days of a vacancy in a school specific seat, the seat becomes an at-large position, according to SA bylaws.
SA Sen. Jovawn McNeil, ESIA-U and a member of the governance and nominations committee, said the flexibility of online class allows them to tune into virtual senate meetings, driving an increase in applications. Without the commute to work and school every day, graduate students have more opportunities to participate in student organizations like the SA, he said.
“Remote allows us to do a lot more in terms of connectivity,” McNeil said. “They’re reaching out to everyone because we’re all in different places, and we’re all just in our crib online and come together at these meetings and not have to worry about any other aspects, like people who are commuters or who lived off campus or were grad students.”
The SA has a history of low representation of graduate students, and many SA graduate senate seats are often left vacant. To increase representation, then-SA Sen. AJ Link, Law-G, proposed splitting the SA into a bicameral legislative system in which graduate students would be able to meet separately and vote – which nearly 70 percent of students voted in favor of in a 2020 SA election referendum.
SA senators established the first-ever graduate student caucus late last month.
SA Sen. Edward Rastgoo, ESIA-U and the vice chair of the governance and nominations committee, said the increase in graduate student involvement will “diversify the voices” in the senate because the senate has had less graduate participation in recent years. He said the appointed graduate senators, in conjunction with the newly established graduate caucus, will create a better platform for all of the University’s graduate students.
“You know that they’re passionate about these issues, and you know that they actually came here to make change,” he said.
Rastgoo said graduate students may have been compelled to apply to the SA because they did not receive a tuition discount for the virtual fall semester as undergraduate students did. SA graduate student applications went live after officials said they didn’t plan to increase tuition for graduate students this academic year, according to an email sent to graduate students.
Rastgoo said he considered “diversity and perspective” from applicants like international and first-generation students when conducting interviews for the vacant positions.
“Through the SA, I think they are a powerful group that has a lot of great ideas and have a totally different perspective than undergraduate students do,” Rastgoo said. “Getting more passionate graduate students on the SA is just a great thing, and I’m glad that that has happened this year.”
SA Sen. Connor Hounshell, MISPH-G and a newly confirmed senator, said the controversies in the hiring of Heather Swain and “insensitive” statements from University President Thomas LeBlanc could have contributed to the uptick in graduate advocacy in the SA. He said during a pandemic when many graduate students have lost full-time jobs and are supporting families, officials should provide more support for their graduate students – like expanding the tuition decrease to graduate students.
“There was definitely a lot of frustration and disappointment with the University’s response to graduate students and not offering the same tuition reduction,” he said.
SA Sen. Caroline Fuss, MISPH-G, said students want to be included in discussions about potential policy changes like implementing a Pass/No Pass option, prompting an increase in applications. She said she will advocate for these two initiatives as a recently elected senator.
“Given all the new policy changes due to COVID that very directly impact us as students, I think now more than ever, people want a say or want to be a voice in helping to influence the policies that GW decides to adopt,” Fuss said in an email.

Public health school researchers have used federal funding to strengthen the country's response to COVID-19 and study its effects.
Researchers in the Milken Institute School of Public Health have received more than $2 million in grants from the National Institutes of Health to fund COVID-19 research throughout the pandemic.
Since the start of the health crisis, Milken researchers have been using grants they’ve received to develop at-home COVID-19 tests and launch clinical trials for a potential vaccine. Milken officials said the school’s public health researchers engage in a variety of disciplines, like epidemiology and biostatistics, that play a role in the solutions to the pandemic.
Adnan Hyder, the senior associate dean for research at the public health school, said in addition to the funding already received from the NIH, “millions more” applications for federal funding are under review. He added that several institutes within the school have directed their existing resources to support COVID-19 research.
“In many cases, COVID-19 research aims to better understand the virus, the way it is spread, how it triggers severe illness and how we can prevent it,” Hyder said in an email. “The goal of such research ultimately is to prevent adverse health effects from this virus.”
Using funds allocated to the public health school, researchers have invested time in a variety of public health issues regarding the pandemic, like investigating the connection between COVID-19 mortality and obesity and administering a health care worker survey about experiences responding to the pandemic.
GW has also set aside an internal fund for research that offered researchers grants between $5,000 and $25,000, which they could apply to between April 17 and June 1. The proposals were subject to an unusually quick approval process and an eight-page limit, according to the University’s research website.
Lynn Goldman, the dean of the public health school, said Milken officials have been evaluating research proposals to determine how many resources they need to conduct their work.
“As public health researchers, we broadly frame our work around all phases of pandemic preparedness response – identifying actions to protect health prior to, during and in the period of recovery from a pandemic or any other disaster,” she said in an email. “We look broadly at many factors, including biological, social, behavioral and environmental, that can be important in preventing diseases like COVID-19.”
Goldman said Milken’s Office of Research Excellence tracks potential research projects and notifies faculty of any project that may be a good fit for them. She said the most successful opportunities for researchers have been when they can use research to better understand the pandemic and apply knowledge to address a specific problem.
“For example, some projects aim to better understand a disease like COVID-19 or pave the way for a treatment or vaccine,” she said. “Others aim to address a problem, such as the lack of personal protective equipment for frontline health care workers.”
Academic research experts said many universities have accelerated their research proposal processes to prioritize addressing the coronavirus pandemic. Despite universities’ larger budget cuts, they said academic research teams have remained largely unaffected by cutbacks, given that direct research funding has primarily come from government institutions.
Moshe Levi, the interim dean for research at Georgetown University, said Georgetown had an expedited application process for internal funding and received 30 proposals for research within a week after they notified faculty of the fund.
Levi said because funding from government institutions is already set in stone, university layoffs and funding cuts for faculty are the only factors that might financially inhibit research.
Officials have laid off hundreds of staff members to alleviate financial stress brought on by the pandemic, but officials have not discussed laying off tenured or tenure-track faculty. GW faces a $160 million budget shortfall for the 2020-21 academic year.
“If you have unfunded faculty – the university gives you money for travel, to go to scientific meetings, for this or that – that’s affected, but otherwise, research in most universities is really funded by external grants, not internal grants, including George Washington,” Levi said.
Levi said Georgetown’s COVID-19 research has not come at the expense of other areas of research at least for now. He said if research-funding institutions like the NIH do not see increases in their budgets, funding for COVID-19 research will eventually cut into opportunities for research in other fields.
The NIH rushed to award $3.6 billion that the agency received from Congress in grants to academic researchers, Science Magazine reported in June.
“Within NIH or other funding agencies, sometimes they put money into COVID-19 research, and if their overall budget does not increase, that comes at the expense of other areas, which is really dangerous,” Levi said.
Meredeth Cole, the communications manager for the Office of the Vice President for Research at the University of Virginia, said UVA’s grant proposal process has also been accelerated to more rapidly address COVID-19. She said UVA has awarded nearly $3 million in grants in a significantly more “rapid” manner than the typical funding process.
“Seeing problems and coming up with solutions, and not in a way that’s ‘How much money can we make off of this?’ but ‘How can we share with others?’” she said. “And I think the generosity between academics has been tremendous during the pandemic.”

Black residents constitute just over half of total positive COVID-19 cases in D.C., and Hispanic residents comprise about a quarter of city-wide cases.
Updated: Oct. 6, 2020 at 2:08 p.m.
The majority-White area around GW has sustained one of the lowest coronavirus death rates among D.C.’s neighborhoods, especially compared to other areas of the city that are majority Black.
The city’s coronavirus case data show that three-quarters of people who have died from COVID-19 have been Black, despite making up just less than half of the city’s population. District officials and public health experts said the pandemic is unequally hitting marginalized communities because they face disproportionate access to essential services, like health care and education.
“It’s not an easy thing when you think about all of the realities that poor people face simply because they are poor, economically poor,” At-large D.C. Council member David Grosso said. “This is not easily solvable. The COVID emergency has actually kind of ripped off the band-aid and shown us all what the reality is for so many of our poor residents.”

The majority of cases are concentrated in the northeastern, southeastern and southwestern parts of the city, where Black residents make up half or more of the population. Black residents constitute just over half of total positive COVID-19 cases in the District, and Hispanic residents comprise about a quarter of city-wide cases, according to the District’s COVID-19 website.
Ward 2’s 1,000 positive cases are the second-lowest number of positive cases of any ward, just below Ward 3, which logged 770 cases as of Sunday, according to the website. The neighborhood around GW, which includes Foggy Bottom and parts of West End and Dupont Circle, has tracked about 100 positive cases as of Sunday, placing the neighborhood in the bottom 10 in terms of positive coronavirus cases, the data show.
Ward 4 has been hit the hardest with COVID-19 cases, logging almost 3,000 positive cases as of Sunday, according to the website. Wards 5, 7 and 8 recorded just more than 2,000 cases each by Sunday, the website indicates.
Grosso said Black and Latino residents tend to work in essential services, like health care and food service, which have remained open throughout the pandemic. He said city officials have directed resources, like personal protective equipment and small business support, to essential workers in the city.
He added that many residents of color live in high density housing units, like apartments and public housing, that could lead to an increased risk of coming in contact with the virus.
“They have to show up to work, and they are our grocery line workers and working in our hospitals and other places where they couldn’t actually isolate themselves away from the virus like our more affluent White residents who tend to have more office jobs too,” Grosso said.
He said marginalized communities experience disproportionate access to transportation and grocery stores, another reason why the virus has hit those communities particularly hard.
He said government officials have taken strides to mitigate these disparities by prohibiting evictions and offering support for businesses who have been hurt financially amid the pandemic.
“We’ve provided more and more and more personal protective equipment, the PPE, for essential workers in the city,” Grosso said. “We’ve also tried to keep businesses from closing by supporting them. We’ve also prohibited evictions.”
The Council passed a complete eviction ban late last month, preventing landlords from ending rent agreements.
Grosso said some marginalized communities tend to lack trust in the health care system, which he said could be a result of not having the educational resources to navigate the system. He said city officials have publicized public health information through emails, newsletters and social media platforms, but it’s still an uphill battle to build trust and connect residents with a primary care physician.
“We also know that the education of folks has been something that we have not fully accomplished, and there’s huge disparities in our achievements at education and that lack of education,” Grosso said.
Alison Reeves, a spokesperson for the D.C. Department of Health, said Mayor Muriel Bowser is working on private sector partnerships, like a new Howard University hospital and a Universal Health Services-run hospital at the St. Elizabeth’s campus in Southeast D.C., which aim to improve equity throughout the District.
“The District continues to be forward-looking, leveraging public investments in partnership with the private sector that will support major investments over the next five years,” Reeves said in an email.
Public health experts said racism is deeply rooted in public health issues throughout the United States and government officials should take strides to address the issue when devising solutions to the coronavirus pandemic.
Cities like Milwaukee and New York have seen similar racial disparities in their coronavirus case data, according to a New York Times report from this summer. The same report revealed that nationwide, Black and Latino residents are three times more likely to contract the virus than White residents.
Tyan Dominguez, a clinical professor of social work at the University of Southern California, said marginalized communities tend to lack trust in the health care system because they have historically lacked access to health care and faced disparities in quality of care based on race.
“These are systemic issues, it’s not a silver bullet solution and it’s not something that is going to be fixable overnight,” Dominguez said. “It’s a multi-pronged issue from the longstanding history, and I think it’s going to take a multi-pronged approach and consistency in what responses are within the system.”
Camara Jones, the former president of the American Public Health Association, said the national response to the pandemic has been focused on medical care, when pandemic response officials should treat it as a public health issue.
She said paid sick leave, a universal basic income and a living minimum wage would help mitigate disparities in public health outcomes. She said investing in housing, green spaces and schools for communities of color would also help reduce public health disparities.
“There’s no basis in the human genome for racial subspeciation,” Jones said. “We know it’s not a gene, but it’s not even our choices.”
