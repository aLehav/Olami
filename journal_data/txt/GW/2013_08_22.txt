It’s lunchtime in Foggy Bottom and J Street sounds unappealing already. Strewn across campus sit brightly colored food trucks all vying for student’s attention — and dollars. So which food trucks are worth your cash?
Pepe @pepefoodtruck
★★★★½✰
Chef Jose Andres continues to serve up lessons to Foggy Bottom even after teaching a class to GW students last semester. Now, he’s created one of the first chef-inspired food trucks. His sandwiches — like the pollo frito with tangy piparra peppers and brava sauce for $9 — fill you up without requiring sides. Plus, it’s wrapped up to make for easy on-the-go eating.
CapMac @CapMacDC
★★★★½✰4
CapMac, a.k.a. the Holy Grail, crafts an awesome combination of coolness and creamy, crunchy cheese cracker-topped macaroni and cheese. The issue: Lines for the truck are like those outside of the Verizon Center when Jay-Z comes to town — nearly impossible to conquer without time or money. When you find yourself with both, seek the Holy Grail: Mac and cheese topped with chicken parmesan meatballs is worth the wait and the slight tug on your wallet.
Far East Taco Grille @FarEastTG
★★★★✰
Far East Taco Grille satisfies cravings like a panicked husband going out to 7-Eleven at 3 a.m. for his pregnant wife, except their food tastes good at all hours of the day. Authentic Mexican tacos are fused with the likes of Asian-style juicy steak, kimchi-lime slaw, spicy pineapple sauce and onion-lime relish. Satisfy a craving with one taco for just $3 or fill yourself up with three for $8.
Yumpling @yumplingdc
★★★✰✰
Yumpling’s dumplings are not yummy because of the dumpling itself. The yum comes from their sauces: The sweet chili is tame, while their spicy chili oil satiates more adventurous appetites. The meat and veggie fillings are not significant, so just treat this bright yellow truck as your place for cheap, yummy snacks where you can grab six dumplings for $5.
Tasty Kabob @TastyKabob
★★½✰✰✰
Lamb over rice with white sauce may be your go-to halal fixture, but this popular truck should up its game for the price it’s charging. If you’re really in the mood, go for a side like chickpeas or okra for $2, but if not, pass this truck up and get some better bang for your GWorld-less buck.
THE DISH ON OFF-CAMPUS BITES…

fojol bros. @fojolbros
★★★★★
This traveling circus goes by fojol, not Ringling, and serves Indian and Mediterranean-style cuisine. Sides include curry and non-melting Mango Lossipops.
Basil Thyme @BasilThymeDC
★★★★½✰
Missing mom’s lasagna? Hit up Basil Thyme. They husk and roast their corn as a side to $11 traditional lasagna dishes.
DC Slices @dcslices
★★✰✰✰
Disclaimer: I am a New Yorker. Appropriately prefaced with “DC,” the pizza has a brick (not “brick oven”) crust. At $4 a slice, it is not worth the price nor the hype.

Since childhood, the first day of school has been synonymous with fresh haircuts, new clothes and shiny shoes. But of course, it’s also the start of gossip season, a rite of passage each fall.
GW and its mile-wide social circles make asking ‘what’d you do?’ and ‘who’d you do?’ an art form, especially after we’ve been forced to rely on Instagram photos and Facebook relationship statuses to get our fix of artistic inspiration over the last three months.
Now, we get to ask the questions. Who broke up with whom? Who got tan? Who got fat? Who was stuck at home working at Old Navy?
All of the dirt that’s been swept under the rug for the past three months is about to be aired out to a congregation of hungry drama-suckers. Still, this long-celebrated practice does have standardized etiquette.
Spread it out – don’t focus too much on one incident. Someone’s photo op with a senator or backpacking trip across Europe can be fodder for a substantive conversation, but you can’t get much mileage out of one drunken beach escapade photo or a short-lived summer fling. The more you know, the better you’ll be prepared for all the social pop quizzes at frat parties and over Sweetgreen lunches.
Have the courtesy to at least talk behind peoples’ backs — this way, they can’t calculate how many people know about the finance internship they only nabbed via nepotism.
If you do muster up the gall to talk to someone face-to-face, offer your most apologetic tone when bringing up the dramatic breakup you monitored over Facebook as if it were your favorite television show. Nevermind the semester you spent trashing their relationship.
Never repeat the same story twice. It’ll make you look like a has-been who doesn’t know the right people with the right dirt. If it’s last week’s news, just take it elsewhere.
Gossip is juicy and fun, and everyone does it. So when someone tells you they don’t enjoy the catching-up process, laugh, because later they’ll be telling their roommate that you got fat over the summer.

With tensions still high after a string of unpopular administrative decisions this summer, students might be tempted to think GW is paying little attention to them. But in reality, GW has never been more tuned in.
The University ­­– which relies on student satisfaction for tuition dollars, national rankings and professor reviews – has spent 30 percent more on services in the last five years, allowing it to meet students’ rising demands by hiring extra hands, adding programs and expanding official outreach.
Administrators past and present agree that this generation of students is increasingly bringing a “consumer mentality” to college, putting pressure on officials to create a college experience that is worth nearly $60,000 a year. In turn, that demand is driving up the cost of college even further.
“People didn’t used to come to a university thinking they were coming to a spa or a four-star Caribbean hotel. It’s a different nature, a different community,” former University President Stephen Joel Trachtenberg, who still teaches at GW, said. “I sort of regret that we have become more like the marketplace, where people expect malls and such when they come to a campus.”
Executive Vice President and Treasurer Lou Katz said support no longer means just counseling and academic advising. He pointed to multi-million dollar programs like GW’s security escort service 4-Ride, as well as the swell of student organizations and the need for upgraded power systems and internet in residence halls. “The students do want more, and it’s expensive,” Katz said.
The service, too, has become real-time and 24/7. To help GW identify student gripes and grievances, the University has tasked a three-person social media team, including Jonathan Hussey, with the duty to rapidly respond.
“We’re looking at what people are saying at all times,” said Hussey, who has spent the last year monitoring hashtags and skimming lists of students, faculty and alumni on an hourly basis. “We see every aspect of student life. We chime in when we can, we try to help when we can.”
Nearly every department at GW now runs a Twitter account, Hussey said, which allows him to regularly pass along online concerns so “the right person” can personally respond. He said the bar has been set by Dean of Student Affairs Peter Konwerski, who has been at GW since he lived in Thurston Hall as a freshman and frequently tweets even after midnight to address student complaints.
GW has also invested in programs that give students face-to-face time with staff. A $2 million services hub brought dozens of staffers – including those from the Center for Student Engagement and GW’s Study Abroad programs – under one roof to lure more students to drop by. The administration pumped $150,000 more into its counseling center budget this year for additional staff and hours.
Then there are those luxurious residence halls – like West Hall – built with dining rooms and fitness centers; the constant changes to J Street dining options; and Gelman Library’s $16 million first floor facelift.
“Colleges are turning into businesses”
The heightened focus on supporting students outside of the classroom mirrors a national focus on better customer service in higher education. After students spend their high school careers “shopping” for schools, they arrive on campus with bigger expectations than ever, higher education experts argue.
“Colleges are turning into businesses where customers – in this case, students – expect to be satisfied,” Jeff Selingo, editor-at-large of the Chronicle of Higher Education, wrote in his book, “College Unbound,” this May.
Those rising expectations are driving up the price of college, Selingo wrote, particularly because more staff have had to be hired to run things like intramural sports and student organizations.
But one of the best-known faces in GW student life, Associate Dean of Students Tim Miller, said the idea that students are GW’s customers “belittles what the college experience is about and equates it to buying a stereo or a cheeseburger at McDonald’s.”
GW’s role as an educational institution – which includes not only classroom materials but also disciplinary roles – is far from from a company-customer relationship, he said, though the administration still must answer to students.
For $60,000, an expectation for top service
At GW, there’s extra pressure for the school to satisfy its students, said Hugo Scheckter, a 2013 graduate who called his GW experience far below par.
“I get really frustrated when programs and services aren’t in a top 10 standard, top 25 or top 100,” he said. If he went to a community college, he said, he “wouldn’t be expecting all the best facilities, but here, you do – especially if you’re paying full tuition.”
Out of a total $32,860 spent by the University per student each year, about $13,798 goes toward programs and services, according to higher education research group College Measures. That figure puts GW in the middle of the pack compared to more than a dozen similar institutions, and far behind schools like Southern Methodist and Duke universities, which spend nearly $20,000 per student on services.
“You think about it, you’re paying $60,000 a year for service. Anywhere else in the world, you pay $60,000 and you receive top service. This university seems to be an exception,” Scheckter said.
After four years, Scheckter’s frustration boiled over: “King Hugo” launched a high-profile bid for Student Association president – with the core message of “Fuck GW” – to call out administrators for basing their decisions on the bottom line.
Among the sticking points: GW’s $33 million textile museum, which Scheckter blasted for taking up precious square footage without benefiting undergraduates. He also took aim at University President Knapp’s $1.17 million paycheck, which makes him one of the top-paid presidents in the country.
After landing nearly 800 votes in the election and placing third overall, Scheckter said the success of his campaign was “clear evidence of how people are disenfranchised.”
“Building spirit at GW”
Katz, 63, came to GW in 1990 at the start of an era when administrators tried to use lavish spending to brand GW as a national destination. Students took campus tours in double-decker buses and arrived at orientation to a $75,000 laser light show. Trachtenberg has said that while those extras swelled the cost of attendance, it also attracted more top-achieving students who could afford the steeper price tag.
“Right or wrong, that was to help build spirit at the institution,” Katz said. “You can debate that to death, but there were some positives to come out of it and negatives that came out of it.”
Six years into University President Steven Knapp’s tenure, he has pulled amenities like student maid service, the Fishbowl study space and the cheap campus bowling alley and redirected $20 million into academics, research and career services. He has also hired more administrators to oversee specific areas like distance learning and veterans services.
Despite efforts, though, some students still say the administration has failed to see what students want from their college. SA leaders say they are working to make sure student voices are some of the loudest in the room.
Daniel Egel-Weiss, a leader in the SA Senate, said students must be more proactive or risk being left out of more decisions, like the new off-campus housing policies that could clamp down on rowdy student behavior in order to appease Foggy Bottom neighbors.
“Considering what’s happened over the last few weeks and over the summer, our first goal is being an advocate for the students, voicing concerns over these new policies,” Egel-Weiss said. “[Administrators] know we have concerns, and going forward nothing like that will happen again.”
Still, SA President Julia Susuni said the SA needs to strike a balance between cordial relations and playing hardball with administrators.
Susuni said she will appoint multiple students to work more closely with the University’s Faculty Senate on committees ranging from the library system to athletics – a kind of direct representation that’s traditionally been absent from top university decision-making bodies.
“It’s really important to be able to work with the administration, and do actual things and make positive changes,” Susuni said. “People inherently understand that you’re elected for a reason, and people pick you for a reason.”

The University’s newly hired head of Gelman Library says she will use the building’s $16 million upgrade as a springboard for digitization to better use their space on GW’s cramped Foggy Bottom Campus.
Geneva Henry, who arrived just a month before GW renovated the building’s main level with sleek new furniture and more powerful desktops, said the upgrade allows the University to rethink the library’s primary purpose. While the transformation to e-journals and data visualization tools will be slow-moving without a boost to the library’s budget or a cultural shift among researchers, she said it will pay off.
She said the changes, like new visualization technology in Gelman, will help researchers make “new discoveries you could never have made in print in the same material.”
“You make it digital, you turn it into data and it’s amazing what you can do,” said Henry, who was the executive director of digital scholarship services at Rice University.
As staff members scan materials into digital form, librarians must wrestle with different types of scanners and resolutions, as well as how to make materials the most accessible online. That means the library must sometimes navigate patchwork copyright laws and business models that Henry said are not up to date with the digital age.
At the core of Henry’s mission for a transformed Gelman is a culture shift, which would be aided by potential facility upgrades like humanities-based research labs to lure researchers into Gelman.
“That’s not going to happen in the first year because facilities planning is big, but to create those kinds of environments where you could have research going on in the building, students already here who can walk by and say, ‘Wow, that’s interesting, what are they doing in there?’…it might spark something,” she said.
The struggle, Henry and her predecessor Jack Siggins both said, is to provide enough study space while maintaining the library’s status as the University’s primary research hub – and dealing with its about $4 million annual operating budget, which outside librarians have said is paltry.
“One of the challenges for a librarian today is to figure out what the balance is between having – in terms of books and periodicals – what it is that you need right here, and what should be accessed very quickly from the storage facility,” said Siggins, who retired in June 2012 and remains an adviser for the project.
The library must prioritize what items within its collections to digitize, likely focusing on its special collections and rarer materials.
To make way for more group space and technology – such as three-dimensional screens – GW has cleared more than 20,000 volumes of materials out of its main building each year, scanning its existing collections and opting for e-books when possible.
But the digitization process is costly – and therefore slow.
Already, the library lacks the money to properly maintain its materials, Henry said – which is the subject of Provost Steven Lerman’s strategic library review slated to be released at the end of the month.
“We’re under-resourced. Without having any budget increases, our collections are not at the level that a first-tier research university needs to be at,” Henry said, detailing findings from the review.
Henry said Gelman’s annual budget is unlikely to change until donations drastically increase. She said she has already begun working with a member of GW’s fundraising team whose focus is the library. She said more donations could bring GW to the same level as schools with premiere research libraries, like Stanford University and the University of Michigan.
The University of Michigan’s library system’s total expenditures for 2011-2012 were nearly $64 million, compared to GW’s $26 million, according to the Association for Research Libraries.

The University announced this week that GW will set aside $250,000 annually for scholarships using cash that was previously spent to engrave graduating seniors’ names on bricks around campus.
With names already etched onto most of the bricks on GW’s walkways, Senior Vice Provost for Academic Affairs and Planning Forrest Maltzman said money will be reallocated into a scholarship fund in the name of each graduating class.
The last recipients of the two-decade-old program were students of the Class of 2013. Since 1990, names have filled bricks in University Yard, Kogan Plaza and Anniversary Park.
“Re-directing funds from the alumni brick program, along with the gifts given by seniors through the Senior Class Gift Campaign, ensures that each class leaves a legacy beyond bricks and mortar on campus – a legacy of philanthropy for future Colonials,” a statement from the University reads.
Student Association president Julia Susuni said she brought concerns up with University President Steven Knapp this week after hearing multiple complaints from seniors.
“A lot of people are pretty disappointed by it, but I also think it’s nice to know that the money is being redirected for future students,” Susuni said.
Vice Provost for Academic Affairs and Planning Forrest Maltzman said he doesn’t think the end of the program will change how alumni relate to GW.
“Although I have always liked seeing the bricks, our academic programs and student aid are always my top priorities,” Maltzman said.

The University ended its freshmen mentorship program this fall as GW’s student life offices continue to rein in spending and better cater their support to specific populations of students.
Nixing the Guide to Personal Success program – which paired all incoming freshmen with upperclassmen, faculty or alumni to ease the transition to college – is one of the most visible changes in the University’s constant tinkering of student life programs.
Dean of Student Affairs Peter Konwerski said the program wasted resources by offering it to all undergraduates instead of just to groups like first-generation students. It also stirred confusion between freshmen and their academic advisers, he said.
The program had been mandatory for freshmen until last year, though many students would “meet once or twice” with their guides, if at all, before adjusting to college life, Konwerski said. He added that the program was “another layer of bureaucracy on top of faculty and advising roles.”
Last fall, guides were required to meet with students at least once a month and set up two outings per semester, though the program became optional. About 300 students – almost 13 percent of the freshman class – signed up for a GPS guide after GW ditched the mandate.
Konwerski had said then that a stricter structure would improve the program. But this fall, Konwerski reversed course and lauded the decision by Center for Student Engagement director Tim Miller to scrap the failed program altogether.
“One of the hardest things that any organization has to decide is how do you stop doing something that maybe isn’t doing what it’s meant to be doing,” Konwerski said last week.
Miller said the program could be awkward because the best pairs “happen naturally, instead of through a matching process.”
Matthew Traina, a sophomore in the GW School of Business, said he was disappointed with the program last year after he and his guide met one time and “afterwards she didn’t talk to me.” He said it didn’t seem like a serious time commitment for her.
“I was expecting more out of the program,” Traina said. “I think the idea of the program was good, but it was just not executed well.”
Miller had previously planned to transform the program into one involving career mentorship, which would be called the Connect Program, but administrators unveiled plans this summer to throw their support behind the University’s existing career center and alumni association mentorship program instead. The University is also trying to connect first-generation students with mentors.
With the end of the program, Miller said GW will rely more on its house staff members to be a resource for new students transitioning to college life.
Konwerski added that the GPS program, housed in the Center for Student Engagement, “never had a huge budget associated with it,” but declined to provide exact amounts.
Student support and services – one of the largest costs the University foots  – have undergone major shifts under GW’s current administration, which stresses efficiency and has expanded personalized support to populations such as veterans and first-generation college students.

Gelman Library’s refurbished entrance, which opened this month, includes security measures like glass door turnstiles and more security cameras to combat unlawful entries and thefts.
Security was a priority during the entrance redesign process for both Jack Siggins, who served as Gelman’s head librarian until last summer, and Kevin Hay, chief of the University Police Department. Both said the new features, including about 15 additional security cameras and chest-high turnstile doors, would help tighten security.
Hay said UPD had previously caught teenagers in Gelman who were “really thin” and able to squeeze through the turnstiles.
“With this new system of glass doors, they can’t do that. They would actually have to physically climb over, both coming and going,” Hay said.
UPD logged 37 thefts or robberies in the library from July 2012 through Wednesday, and 35 of those cases remained open or lacked suspects or witnesses. Officers also responded to three incidents in which people entered the building without permission, arresting suspects in two of those cases.
Siggins, who had served as GW’s head librarian for 17 years and remains a consultant for Gelman, said security was one of his “highest priorities” as he planned the overhaul.
“Security in this building, in any library, is really, really difficult because you don’t have many straight lines of sight,” he said.
Hay said the new layout allows desk staff to see both the entrance and exit gates at the same time. Before, staffers could only check the exit if they turned around, and a suspect could walk into the library through the exit gates while their backs were turned.
Officers arrested a teenager in February after he entered the the building through the library’s exit lane, and the Metropolitan Police Department also charged him with possession of and intent to distribute marijuana.

In a mayoral race already crowded with six Democrats, the GW-led team driving Jack Evans’ campaign is hoping to broaden support for the seasoned D.C. Council member by appealing to a city tired of scandal-embroiled officials.
Josh Brown, the Ward 2 Council member’s campaign manager who earned a political science degree from GW in 2012, said his campaign is trying to turn attention away from trivial politics and towards the problems Evans has vowed to address.
“The biggest challenge is having the race not getting bogged down by small, little, horse-race sorts of things,” Brown said. “We have to be disciplined and focused on our message, and hope that the press and political pundits stay focused on the issues.”
Evan’s staff, which also includes four current students, is drawing on Evans’ big business ties to tout his history of job creation and development in the areas of D.C. that need the most growth.
Justin Mark, a senior, stressed Evans’ role in bringing business to U Street and Dupont Circle – two of the most prosperous commercial areas in the District today.
“He’s done so much already for this city,” Mark said, sitting in a room covered with “Jack Evans for Mayor” posters, where staffers hunched over their computer screens. “He’s seen the city at his worst, and he knows how to get things done.”
Evans was in his fourth year serving on the Council when D.C. was in danger of bankruptcy in 1995, and watched as the federal government established a financial control board for the city. The 59-year-old now chairs the Council’s finance committee and sits on its economic development committee.
The District’s finances have turned around since the 1990s, with the credit-rating company Standard & Poor’s upgrading D.C.’s credit rating in March and the city reporting a $140 million surplus at the beginning of fiscal year 2013.
Evans’ campaign headquarters, on 14th Street between Logan Circle and Columbia Heights, sits in an area the Council member takes credit for revitalizing. Brown called the neighborhood a “rough area” five to 10 years ago, and a home for blight and prostitution before then.
Now, national publications are “writing on how 14th Street is one of the hippest neighborhoods in the entire city,” Brown said.
Evans will have to contend with candidates like fellow Council members Muriel Bowser, D-Ward 4, and Tommy Wells, D-Ward 6. Bowser and Wells held a slight lead over Evans in a recent poll, but the trio’s main competition may be Mayor Vincent Gray.
Gray, whose 2010 campaign is under federal investigation, has not confirmed whether or not he will vie for the Democratic primary in April. But Brown said the campaign would not be intimidated by the challenge.
“We will still win. What no candidate can take away from Jack, including the current mayor, is his track record, his knowledge, his relations and accomplishments,” said Brown, who added that he personally supports Evans because of the candidate’s proposal to hire music, art and physical education teachers and librarians for every school in the city.
Evans has prided himself on advocating for the city to help finance Nationals Park, which Brown said was a controversial project at the time because of disagreements over construction and financing.
“Evans made it into a combination of business and labor working together,” Brown said, adding that Evans helped ease both sides’ worries about the development. “And it has completely changed that part of town for the better.”
