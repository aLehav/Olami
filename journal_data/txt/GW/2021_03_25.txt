The debate for SA vice president and president were split into two different sessions Thursday.
Candidates vying for Student Association president and vice president fielded questions about GW’s back-to-campus plan and building trust in the body during a virtual debate Thursday evening.
More than 400 people tuned in via Zoom and Facebook Live to listen to six candidates – two vice presidential and four presidential hopefuls – discuss issues like rebuilding trust between the SA and the GW community, facilitating a safe post-pandemic return to campus this fall and increasing diversity initiatives at GW.
Jared Gans, The Hatchet’s senior news editor, and Jessica Nix, an anchor for  GW-TV, moderated the vice presidential and presidential debates, respectively. The SA elections will take place via Engage on Wednesday and Thursday.
Building trust
SA Sen. Kate Carpenter, U-at-Large, and a candidate for vice president, said if elected, she will create an “accountability mechanism” through GroupMe for students, SA members and faculty to discuss issues facing the SA and the GW community. She said using GroupMe will enable community member to “directly” hold the SA accountable if they feel SA senators are not representing the community.
“There is a lack of trust between the SA and the student body, and it is really time to bridge that gap and we do that through communication,” Carpenter said. “It doesn’t need to be through ‘Overheard at GW’ anymore. There needs to be direct communication between the SA and the student body.”
SA Sen. Sofia Packer, CCAS-U, and a candidate for vice president, said she will continue working to pass an ethics amendment – which would outline behaviors prohibited by SA senators, like using an SA position for “personal, material or financial gain” – that was struck down at a recent senate meeting, to form trust in the SA. She said she will work to implement the amendment in the coming year.
She said, if elected, she will create a caucus system that will include more students in the SA to advocate for “identity-based issues” that students may feel are underrepresented in student government.
“We need to make sure that students who feel like their voices are not being heard and feel like their identities are underrepresented are being included as much as possible, no matter whether they were elected or appointed to some position or not,” Packer said.
Returning to campus
SA Sen. Charles Aborisade, CCAS-U and a candidate for SA president, said “acclimating” the classes of 2024 and 2025, both of which have not lived on campus for in-person classes, to the D.C. community will help transition the students to campus life this fall. He said, if elected, he will share information about the D.C. area with these groups to assist them in a smooth transition to GW.
Officials are hoping to return in person this fall but have not made an official decision.
“Making sure we provide them with the most resources possible not only working with just the SA, but also with other organizations throughout campus,” Aborisade said. “Mainly to provide those resources and provide a direction to those resources is going to be important moving forward into this fall semester.”
SA President Brandon Hill, a candidate for SA president, said he is currently working with the SA Pandemic Recovery Task Force to discuss possible reopening plans and gather student input to bring to officials. He said gauging the “quality of life” for students if they return to campus is an “essential” step in deciding whether or not students should return to campus.
“Nothing’s more essential than student health and so when we think about coming back, if one student dies at the hand of a reopening, that’s one too many,” Hill said.
Addressing diversity and inclusion
Christian Zidouemba, a candidate for SA president, said, if elected, he will push to create a one-credit class about racial biases. He said the class could help address discrimination within the GW community.
“By doing so, I think we will reduce anti-Semitism and racism on our campus,” Zidouemba said. “It’s time that we will not only have this conversation in classes but also within our community by having dialogue.”
Hannah Edwards, the former SA vice president for diversity and inclusion and a candidate for SA president, said her platform is focused on accessibility and “making sure students have access to GW,” like providing financial resources for minority students. She said, if elected, she will advocate to expand financial resources for low-income and first-generation students by pushing for more need-based scholarships in addition to merit-based scholarships.
“The last thing that I have wanted to do is expand the Founding Scholars Program, and offer a first-generation scholarship for students as well,” Edwards said. “I think that that would help enhance the student experience for freshmen students on campus.”

Shortly after three Atlanta-area shootings that killed six Asian women last week, my parents questioned whether I should return to the United States to attend GW.
They pointed to statistics indicating that more than 500 hate crimes against Asian Americans have already been recorded in the country this year, and the shootings in Atlanta were one of the many. My dad told me I won’t always have my parents to keep me safe, and I need friends who will ensure my safety. My mom suggested I purchase a gun for self-defense, and I should head to my cousin in Canada if hate crimes rise in the District.
My parents may be worrying too much, but they are being reasonable. As an Asian student, my life is on the line if I come back to a country where anti-Asian violence is on the rise, only to take classes. I can’t help but worry that other Asian students or I might face racial violence if we come back to campus.
When I thought about returning to GW this fall, I turned to student leaders to gauge whether they are just as concerned as I am. Many of the candidates running for Student Association president, executive vice president and senator seats have drummed up some ideas for approaching issues of diversity and inclusion, but I was disappointed to learn that no one really had ideas to address anti-Asian hate on campus. When I asked senatorial candidates directly about the issue, many avoided my question altogether and merely emphasized their commitment to “listen” to the GW community. One candidate even said he is “never going to truly understand our things as a White guy.” It is concerning that even our campus leaders are not being proactive about Asian hate when we know it is prevalent across the United States.
My decision to return is also dependent on how seriously officials take the deadly shootings in Atlanta. Following the tragedy, University President Thomas LeBlanc released a statement condemning the violence. But his words were just that: a statement. I wish I saw a more concerted push from administrators to reach out to Asian students when anti-Asian hate is clearly growing in the United States. Asian students need to know that they are being supported the minute they return to campus come fall, if it is safe to do so.
It is the most fundamental value any people should always mutually understand, tolerate and care for each other, regardless of their skin color, religious beliefs and cultural differences. We must learn solidarity as a GW community to ensure we can fight any form of hate on campus and beyond. While many people are suffering and dying from racial violence every day, it is imperative, and I am confident, that our student, faculty and administrative leaders work to prevent hate and promote rights for minorities rather than just denounce a violent event after it happens. Even if this effort only reaches a certain level of defeating the spread of hate on campus, it is still worthwhile to do it.

Justin Diamond, a junior, is the treasurer of Philosophy Club and Secretary General of Blocky Bottom.
Tuesday, March 23, was a busier day than usual for me. I woke up early for geography class, prepared and delivered a lengthy presentation in Chinese, then listened in on my Economics class lecture while playing a game of chess by the Foggy Bottom Metro Station. Finally, after uploading the recording of a charity event from a few days before, I called my good friend Ian Ching to plan yet another virtual event: a Student Association presidential debate, which would be hosted on our GW Minecraft server, Blocky Bottom. Despite the momentum behind my daily grind, we couldn’t begin planning just yet.
Since Ching and I were both members of different student organizations’ e-boards, we had to join an Excellence in Leadership Session, or else our organizations would be delisted from GW Engage. This is the consequence for any group that neglects to fulfill its four ELS requirements per year, one of which must be a Title IX-related ELS session.
Ironically, the session, which obstructed our ability to plan an event, was titled “Planning a Virtual Event 101,” and like every other ELS session I’ve attended, it was painfully uninformative. My goal is not to belittle the students or administrators who deliver these presentations but to point out the fact that ELS requirements are at best a waste of time, and at worst, an elaborate excuse to delist less active organizations while disincentivizing small groups from establishing themselves within the GW community. Personally, I’m convinced that they’re both. After all, if ELS sessions were purely meant to inform student leaders, then why aren’t they pre-recorded and made constantly available like all other organization resources? It seems like our time is either being unintentionally wasted because student organization leaders are assumed to be clueless by default, or our time is being intentionally wasted in an overzealous attempt to deter a minuscule population of inactive student leaders. For students like Ian, who would otherwise be working on passion projects that build community at GW, these Exceptionally Lame Session requirements are counterintuitive.
As a student who has founded organizations big and small, I know that the Center for Student Engagement is constantly working to create new organizations. They are also looking to prevent the creation of organizations that are seen as unnecessary, redundant or overtly niche. The process of applying to become an organization should be a strong enough filter in and of itself. Once an organization is established, requiring four ELS sessions only serves to place an undue burden on student leaders who are already busy taking on leadership roles in communities they care about.
One Title IX ELS session should be mandatory per year, and all other ELS sessions should become completely optional. This change will ensure completely inactive organizations can be delisted, while active student leaders are made repeatedly aware of the Title IX resources available to them on campus. I think I speak for most – if not all – student leaders when I say that we’re sick and tired of this bureaucratic thorn in our side. It’s time we limit ourselves to requiring one unfortunately important ELS session per year.
I expect student leaders to advocate for the elimination of these unpopular requirements, and I hope our administrators will listen carefully and act accordingly. I’m confident that relegating excessive ELS requirements to the past will prove that sometimes, less is more.

The Cuban restaurant Colada Shop offers an Easter package that lets you assemble Cuban treats like bunny-shaped pastelitos, croquettes and empanadas.

Updated: March 25, 2021 at 1:54 p.m.
The Student Bar Association Senate unanimously passed a resolution condemning the recent surge in violence against Asian American and Pacific Islander communities at its meeting Tuesday.
SBA Sen. Celeste Kim, a sponsor of the legislation, said the resolution censures the “despicable” targeting of Asian American civilians in Atlanta after six individuals of Asian descent were killed in a slew of shootings at three spas last week. The SBA also voted to endorse Student Association Sen. Charles Aborisade, U-at-Large and the chair of the SA finance committee, for SA president and SA Sen. Sofia Packer, CCAS-U, for SA vice president.f
Kim said the resolution denounces the rising trend in anti-Asian American and Pacific Islander violence and calls on GW Law administrators to “communicate developments” in its efforts to combat racism in and around the law school. She said she hopes the law school community can unite against all forms of hate and embrace intergroup solidarity in the midst of the spike in hate crimes toward the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities
“I’ve spoken with some of my constituents and friends who are members of the AAPI community,” she said. “And we all have a shared feeling of vulnerability, frustration, anger and a lack of safety, as if going through the COVID wasn’t challenging already.”
Riven Lysander, a second-year graduate student and first-generation Korean immigrant, said the events in Atlanta were “nothing new,” having personally seen and experienced both verbal and physical attacks on the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities
“It asks for support from our school and our peers,” Lysander said. “It asks for help in claiming, without fear, the ability of people like myself to introduce ourselves as first-generation immigrants in the spirit of Emma Lazarus, and it asks for you all to see us and what we have long endured in silence.”
Lazarus authored the poem “The New Colossus,” lines of which are engraved on the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty. The poem, connected with the Statue of Liberty, is interpreted as an embrace of different cultures coming to the United States.
After meeting with and interviewing all the SA presidential and vice presidential hopefuls, SBA Director of University Affairs Maggie O’Brien, who also serves as chief judge of the Student Court, and her “team” of Ian Lam and Zamin Raza presented an overview of the candidates’ platform points at the meeting.
O’Brien said the team unanimously chose each candidate, whom she said stood out in their policies to support graduate students.
Lam said the three recommended Aborisade, the SA finance committee chair, for SA president because of his plans to support graduate students, including through creating a task force of graduate students to include their voices in SA decisions and onboarding new graduate student organizations that hadn’t requested SA funds in the past. He said they believe Aborisade has the institutional knowledge and experience working with umbrella organizations like the SBA to be best suited for the position.
Lam said the team supported Packer for SA vice president due to her plans to include a graduate student in every branch of the SA and to increase graduate students’ accessibility to resources on campus. He said the team chose Packer because she recognized the “significant devaluation” of graduate students existent at GW.
Lam said the team was impressed by Packer’s “dedication” to advocate for equity on campus through her plans to increase accessibility for community members with disabilities and awareness for gender-inclusive initiatives.
“Sofia’s thoughtfulness, her tangible goals for grad students and her commitment to increasing grad student participation and also amplifying the voices of grad students, especially to administration, we are confident to recommend Sofia as vice president,” he said.
The senate also endorsed SA Sen. Cody Ingraham, Law-G, and SBA Sen. Andrew Wise, the chair of the SBA’s rules and constitution committee, as SA law school senators.
The senate also passed three bills allocating funds to three law school student organizations – $600 to the GW Jewish Law Students Association, $80 to the GW Law School Feminist Forum and $525 to the GW Equal Justice Foundation.
This post was updated to correct the following:
An earlier version of this story stated that the senate passed a bill endorsing SA Sen. Cody Ingraham, Law-G, and SBA Sen. Andrew Wise. The senate only endorsed the two student leaders. We regret this error.

SA Sen. Sebastian Weinmann, Law-G and the sponsor of the bill to add procedures to remove the SA president, said the referendum aligns the current SA constitution with the newly restructured SA bylaws.
Updated: March 25, 2021 at 1:49 p.m.
The Student Association Senate voted to place two referenda on the SA election ballot, including a measure to establish more operations to remove the sitting SA president if the person is found to be “unable” to execute the duties of their position.
The Constitutional Reform and Amendment Referendum of 2021, if approved by the student body, would allow for the president to leave their position either voluntarily or by executive cabinet members’ unanimous vote. Senators also approved a referendum that will ask students to vote on creating an urban studies minor in the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences.
SA Sen. Sebastian Weinmann, Law-G and the sponsor of the bill to add procedures to remove the SA president, said the referendum aligns the current SA constitution with the newly restructured SA bylaws.
He said the referendum would create two processes that allow for the SA president to either be removed or voluntarily leave. The first route would enable members of the executive cabinet to remove the president if they unanimously agree that the president is “temporarily or permanently unable” to perform their responsibilities, while the second process would allow for the president to leave on their on volition, he said.
A one-third vote of the senate is currently required to begin impeachment proceedings against an SA executive official. The executive member can then be removed from office following a Student Court hearing and a two-thirds vote by the senate, according to the SA bylaws.
The referendum comes on the heels of former SA President Howard Brookins’ resignation in January. The senate initiated impeachment proceedings against Brookins amid allegations of workplace mismanagement and claims of sexual misconduct were brought forward against him, citing four SA bylaw and constitution violations.
Senators also voted to reorganize and update language and procedures in the SA’s bylaws through the SA Modernization Act, which will take effect May 1. Some of the major changes include removing redundant, incorrect or “non-pertinent” references and allowing senators to attend meetings virtually even if students return to campus this fall.
SA Sen. Thomas Falcigno, CPS-G and the sponsor of the bill, said he and members of the constitutional transition task force – a body created to align the SA’s updated constitution with its bylaws – wrote the legislation.
Senators reviewed the updated language at the last SA meeting, which also includes increasing the number of committees in the senate from four to nine, adding graduate and undergraduate education policy committees, graduate and undergraduate student life committees, a financial services and allocations committee, a physical facilities and urban affairs committee and a permanent subcommittee on sustainability.
“We completely overhauled where things are in the bylaws so that they make sense in terms of order,” Falcigno said. “We also added definitions so that things mentioned in the bylaws are clearly defined.”
Senators also approved a referendum that will ask students to vote on the possible creation of an urban studies minor program in CCAS. SA Sen. Gabriel Young, CCAS-U and the sponsor of the legislation, said he was inspired to push for the minor by both the wealth disparity of his hometown, San Jose, California, and his work as an intern in Mayor Muriel Bowser’s office focusing on housing and homelessness policy.
“D.C. is a unique city, and there is no better time to have this conversation than now, as the House [of Representatives] Oversight Committee is looking to make D.C. our 51st state,” Young said.
The program would offer an “interdisciplinary platform” for students to study urban life, “processes” and design in relation to GW. Several departments like history and American studies include courses in “city-related” topics but no currently existing courses combine the topics with city surroundings, according to the legislation.
Senators also rejected a bill to place a referendum on the ballot that could have put in place a run-off system for electing executive officers and single-seat constituency senators. SA elections for president and vice president are currently conducted through ranked-choice voting, which does not include the possibility of a runoff occurring.
SA Sen. Patrick Burland, U-at-Large and the sponsor of the bill, said ranked-choice voting is a more “complex, tactical and political” system.
He said ranked-choice voting is “less majoritarian and decisive” than a simple majority vote because ranked choice does not prevent a candidate from creating a “spoiler effect” on another candidate. He said the referendum would not prohibit ranked-choice voting but would encourage the body to use a majority vote “wherever possible” for senate elections.
“By putting this referendum on the ballot, we give the people the direct ability to influence the constitution that governs their Student Association and resolve this question for all future elections,” he said.
Burland argued the referendum, if approved, would allow students to have the final say about how they vote for their representatives.
Joint Elections Commission Chairperson Chloe Wagner fielded senators questions about the impacts of the possible referendum on elections, stating there is a significant decrease in voter participation for runoff elections and a runoff election would lengthen the election process.
The bill received 24 votes in favor and seven opposed, but it failed because it needed to receive 2/3 support of the 44-person senate instead of just the 31 senators present.
The senate also voted to allocate $20,000 of the SA executive branch budget to the Office of Advocacy and Support’s survivor’s fund, which aids survivors of sexual assault.
This post was updated to correct the following:
The Hatchet incorrectly reported that a referendum, if approved, would allow cabinet members to remove the SA president through two processes. Cabinet members can remove the president through one process, and the other process would allow for the president to voluntarily leave. We regret this error.

Redshirt junior forward Neila Luma looks to pass during a game against George Mason. Luma is one of three players to leave the team since head coach Jennifer Rizzotti was fired last week.
Redshirt junior forward Neila Luma, freshman center Ali Brigham and freshman forward Caranda Perea intend to transfer from the women’s basketball program, athletic department spokesperson Kevin Burke confirmed last week. 
The trio departed the team after head coach Jennifer Rizzotti and her coaching staff were fired March 15. The three players combined for 23.4 points per game, firing at a 44.8 percent clip, and 13.1 rebounds per game.
All three players did not return requests for comment. 
Luma has been a key starter in Rizzotti’s squad since her freshman year. In her debut season in 2017-18, Luma started all but two games, netting 7.1 points a contest. She averaged 9.3 points and 5.5 boards during the team’s Atlantic 10 tournament run, helping the program nab its seventh A-10 crown. 
Her presence on the court expanded during the 2018-19 season when she secured a team-leading 10.4 points and 6.1 boards. She started another 28 games, playing 28.1 minutes a game. 
Luma’s junior season was cut short after she suffered a knee injury against Maryland five games into the season. 
The Macungie, Pennsylvania, native made her return to the court for the 2020-21 season. Luma averaged 40 percent from the floor and 7.7 points a game in her final season with the Colonials. She amassed a season-high 18 points against Old Dominion.
In her last game donning the buff and blue, Luma finished 2-of-6 from the field and five rebounds in the Colonials’ (9-14, 5-9 A-10) 58–54 overtime loss to No. 6 Richmond in the second round of the A-10 tournament March 11.
She also contributed to off-the-court efforts to promote racial equality and social justice, serving as the vice president of Athletes Driving Change. Luma also nabbed spots on the A-10 preseason All-Conference Second Team in 2019-20 and the preseason All-Conference Third Team in 2020-21. 
Brigham and Perea were in their first years with GW. The offense flowed through Brigham for the majority of the season. She averaged a team-leading 11.9 points on a team-high 50.4 percent from the field. She netted 21.2 percent of the team’s total points. 
The center was the second  in her family to play for the Colonials after her father Bill Brigham competed with the men’s basketball program for two seasons, helping his squad reach the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament. 
Perea missed the first two games of the season but saw her first minutes against Virginia Tech. In an off-the-bench role, Perea scored a career-high 10 points against Fordham five games later. She missed three more games before scoring two points in 11 minutes against George Mason. In her 16.5 minutes per game, Perea scored 4.2 points and ripped 2.3 boards off the glass per game. 
After the coaching staff was let go last week, 10 of the 12 players on the roster released a statement in support of Rizzotti and her staff. Brigham and Perea attached their names to the statement, but Luma and graduate student guard Sydney Zambrotta did not.
“Each of us has relationships with our coaching staff that go beyond basketball and we will forever have their backs, as they did ours,” the players wrote in the statement. “Unfortunately, we understand that this is a business decision, but for us this is more personal because this is our family.”

Freshman guard Lincoln Ball has entered the transfer portal, athletic department spokesperson Brian Sereno confirmed Monday.
Ball is the fourth player to enter the transfer portal since men’s basketball wrapped up its season in the second round of the Atlantic 10 tournament, following sophomore forwards Jamison Battle and Chase Paar and junior forward Sloan Seymour.
He is the seventh player to leave the program this season after senior guard Maceo Jack, senior forward Ace Stallings and sophomore guard Jameer Nelson Jr. left the team in December. 
Ball did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
After Battle and Paar entered the transfer portal, head coach Jamion Christian released a statement in support of a player’s right to transfer. He added that the squad needs to improve, and he plans to work with the players currently on the roster to bring the program back to its former “glory.”
“We need to get better,” Christian said in the statement. “I need to get better. I will be better, and I believe deeply in the guys we have in the locker room. I look forward to coaching this group and bringing in new additions in short order that will help to restore our program to the glory that our University, alumni and fan base deserve.”
Ball found a spot in the starting five for the majority of the team’s shortened season. He played in 14 of the squad’s 17-game season, starting in nine matchups. He averaged 1.1 points and 1.7 rebounds in 14.2 minutes of action a game. Ball dished 11 assists and nabbed eight steals in his time as a Colonial.
Ball’s inaugural collegiate season was cut short after the Colonials (5-12, 3-5 A-10) went on two COVID-19-related pauses and canceled a game after the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. The first COVID-19 break lasted just two days, but the second break – which began Jan. 19 after head coach Jamion Christian tested positive for the virus – extended 35 days.
Of the team’s 18 scheduled conference games, 10 were postponed and ultimately canceled amid the pauses.
The remaining nine players on the roster will be eligible to play another season with GW after the NCAA allowed another year of eligibility for winter sport athletes.
