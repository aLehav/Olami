GW Law Dean Dayna Bowen Matthew said AppointLink told officials the portal had been “compromised” early Friday morning.
Updated: Dec. 15, 2021 at 12:22 p.m.
GW Law students have been unable to access classroom materials after the “MyLaw” platform suffered a cyber attack on Friday, possibly exposing students and faculty’s personal information.
Officials said potentially compromised information included GWIDs, course schedules, academic and degree programs, faculty office locations and office phone numbers. Some students’ take-home final exams may have also been lost, a law school administrator said in an email to law students Monday evening.
It remains unclear when MyLaw, which provides law students with online access to classroom notes and past assignments, will come back online. AppointLink, an education software developer that owns the platform, did not immediately return a request for comment.
“GW takes very seriously any situation that could compromise our community members’ data,” administrators said in an email to law students Monday evening. “This incident is being thoroughly investigated by the vendor and GWIT Information Security, who took immediate and appropriate actions to reinforce existing security measures and to mitigate potential impact.”
Social security numbers, home addresses and dates of birth were not stored on the portal, officials said. Law school alumni’s graduation year and degree information may have also been exposed.
Officials also warned students to “protect” themselves against fraudulent calls and phishing scams by ignoring and deleting any suspicious communications asking for personal information.
“We want to assure you that we are continuing to take all appropriate actions to remediate the situation,” officials said in the email. “We recognize the seriousness of this issue and will continue to update you with any additional information about this incident as it becomes available.”
University spokesperson Crystal Nosal said in an email that AppointLink and GWIT Information Security are “thoroughly investigating” the incident.
In a separate email to law students, Michael Abramowicz, the school’s associate dean of academic affairs, said take-home final exams that were submitted on MyLaw between Dec. 9 after 2:31 a.m. and Dec. 10 before 3:15 a.m have likely been lost.
“We know of seven students whose take-home exams are unaccounted for, and we are sending those students a message simultaneous to this one,” Abramowicz said in the email. “But it is possible that others may also have submitted exams during this period.”
He said students who believe they submitted their exams during that 25-hour time period should send a copy to the Records Office as soon as possible.
“AppointLink is continuing to search log files to see if additional files may be recovered, but we are not sure that will be successful,” he said.
Law school Dean Dayna Bowen Matthew said AppointLink told officials the portal had been “compromised” early Friday morning.
“This is of utmost importance to us, and we know to you, first and foremost, to our students who are in exam period,” Matthew said in a video statement released Monday morning. “We can’t imagine a more stressful time for this to have happened.”
She said most final exams, the majority of which are administered through a separate software, are continuing as scheduled this week.
In response to the outage, the Student Bar Association created a crowdsourced Google Drive folder where students and faculty can upload missing documents and study materials until MyLaw services return online.
“Our faculty members and staff worked with students to contribute documents to google drives that contained the same materials that were lost in the attack,” Matthew said in an email to The Hatchet. “The University IT experts met with us around the clock to work toward restoration while also retrieving documents as requested.”
Matthew thanked the Student Bar Association for creating the shared folder and said law school faculty were continuing to share documents through it over the weekend.
“I want to say a huge thank you to the SBA who created a Google Doc shared location and poured into that all of the student contributions for sharing materials, all of the faculty contributions over the course of the weekend,” Matthew said in the video statement.
SBA President Jordan Michel had asked law school faculty and administrators on Friday night to re-upload class materials to the folder.
“We understand how stressful this situation is at an already stressful time,” Michel said in the email. “The SBA is in regular communication with the administration and has been advocating for alternatives to help students during this outage.”
SBA leaders also called for officials to extend exam deadlines and improve the current portal software in a separate letter to law school deans. The letter called GW’s response to the outage “abysmal” and “disappointing.”
“The students of this institution have prepared tirelessly for exams during this exhausting semester only to be met with dismissive placations and unpreparedness from the administration,” SBA senators said. “The absolute tip of the iceberg is the MyLaw outage with no current end in sight.”

DC Health had announced the first four cases of the variant in the District on Sunday.
Officials announced GW’s first cases of the Omicron COVID-19 variant on Monday.
Administrators said in an email Monday that they had identified a “very small” number of positive Omicron cases in the University community after months of continuous screening of positive COVID-19 cases. DC Health had announced the first four cases of the variant in the District on Sunday.
“As we shared previously, the GW public health team has been conducting genetic sequencing and screening of positive cases over the past several months,” the email reads. “We are now seeing a very small number of positive cases of the Omicron variant among the GW community.”
Officials said the presence of the new variant will not alter the current public health measures in place to protect campus health or the processes toward treating or isolating infected individuals.
Georgetown University announced their first Omicron case Monday morning – an individual who had not been to campus since before Thanksgiving break other than to get a COVID-19 test.
Administrators said they would not share specific case details due to privacy concerns but added that the individuals who contracted the variant had not traveled internationally.
“We are not able to discuss these cases specifically other than to share that the individuals did not travel internationally, which means the Omicron variant is now circulating in the region,” the email reads.
Students, faculty and staff will be required to receive a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine by February, officials also announced on Monday.
Officials said they believe their vaccine and booster mandate alongside the University’s indoor mask requirement and contact tracing programs will help protect GW from COVID-19, adding that they will continue to review new information.
“As always, we will continue to review our public health guidelines based on the latest data about COVID-19 transmission in our community, as well as local and national public health guidance,” officials said. “We will update you on any changes to our guidance.”

Officials said GW community members who have medical or religious reasons exempting them from GW’s vaccine requirement do not have to abide by the booster mandate. 
Students, faculty and staff will be required to receive a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine by February, officials announced on Monday.
Officials said in an email that all GW community members must upload documentation of their booster shot to GW’s medical portal by Feb. 1, exactly six months after community members were required to be fully vaccinated for COVID-19. The requirement came as officials also announced the first cases of the Omicron variant in the GW community.
“​​​​The booster requirement aligns with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) recommendation and is part of our ongoing efforts to keep the GW community healthy and safe amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,” the email reads.
Officials said students who do not receive the booster before Feb. 1 will have to get tested for COVID-19 weekly and complete a questionnaire monitoring their daily symptoms. Students who do not receive a booster shot by March 15 will not be allowed to register for summer or fall classes, according to the email.
Faculty and staff who choose not to get the booster by March 15 will receive a warning from officials who may proceed with “subsequent employment actions.”
Officials said GW community members who have medical or religious reasons exempting them from GW’s vaccine requirement do not have to abide by the booster mandate.
The announcement comes after the D.C. Department of Health confirmed the first four Omicron cases in the District on Sunday, Maryland officials detected three Omicron cases earlier this month and Virginia announced its first case last week.
Earlier this month, officials encouraged students to receive booster shots, saying it was the “best way” to stay protected from COVID-19 mutations. The Medical Faculty Associates is offering walk-in appointments at 949 23rd St. NW, across from the GW Hospital between 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on all weekdays.
A growing number of students said prior to the announcement that they got their booster shot or planned to schedule an appointment in the near future to stay safe as they return home for winter break.

Jessica Parillo, the director of CAPS, said GW faces a “significant challenge” hiring new therapists as the University competes with neighboring institutions to hire from a limited pool of D.C.-based counselors.
The University is looking to expand Counseling and Psychological Services staffing to manage an influx of appointments this year, officials announced at a Faculty Senate meeting Friday.
Colette Coleman, the senior associate dean of students, and Jessica Parillo, the director of CAPS, presented a report that stated that CAPS handled 2,739 student appointments this semester with a depleted staff. Officials said the University’s reopening has increased mental health concerns for students who have struggled coping with busy schedules, crowded in-person classes and heightened academic rigor since returning to campus during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“We’re seeing somewhat regressed functioning and poor coping skills on top of these increased mental health diagnoses,” Coleman said at the meeting. “So it is really challenging the systems that we have in place, and this is not unique to GW CAPS by any means. I think it’s more of a national conversation.”
The report states that CAPS has received roughly two dozen cases of “suicidal ideation” this fall, and officials logged 848 CARE reports this semester in which psychological, academic and medical issues accounted for students’ top concerns. Both of these totals are consistent with pre-pandemic levels.
Coleman said GW is also looking to add six more counselors to CAPS in addition to the 12 currently employed, keeping the total in line with national standards, which recommend one counselor for every 1,000-1,500 students.
Parillo said CAPS faces a “significant challenge” hiring new therapists as the University competes with neighboring institutions to hire from a limited pool of D.C.-based counselors and navigate an increased demand for psychological services because of the pandemic.
“The pandemic changed our field in permanent ways, where now, therapists are often choosing to just start out with no overhead, doing telehealth and private practice,” she said. “Someone out of a master’s program can easily make like $160,000 a year where they’re going to make not even half of that here.”
Senators voted by unanimous consent to officially adopt a resolution of appreciation for outgoing University President Thomas LeBlanc, who was not present at the meeting. The senate initially tried to adopt the resolution by acclamation at last month’s meeting, but Arthur Wilson, the chair of the senate’s executive committee, said the move was found to be out of line with senate procedure.
“Senate bylaws treat all resolutions identically – there is no exception for resolutions of appreciation,” he said.
Harald Griesshammer, a faculty senator and an associate professor of physics, said he was concerned that officials said they will soon resume the search for a new chief digital officer – which Chief Financial Officer Mark Diaz said he hopes to conclude by the end of this fiscal year – without considering faculty input.
Faculty and administrators have been working to improve shared governance at the University in advance of the search for a permanent University president. Faculty have previously expressed concerns about a lack of opportunities for their own input and involvement in University planning efforts.
“That’s deeply troubling because the senate has made it very, very clear at the last meeting and via both informal and more formal channels that we want to have a significant say in that, and that discussion of the CDO position includes a discussion of what the future of Academic Technologies and IT at GW is,” Griesshammer said.
Faculty have said GW Information Technology is overwhelmed and understaffed while dealing with a spike in support requests at the start of the fall semester under the newly centralized IT model.
Interim Provost Chris Bracey said in his remarks that a steering committee working to improve shared governance at GW in advance of the search for a permanent president met this month to discuss the structure, timing and distribution of an upcoming survey to assess the current state of shared governance at GW.
“The steering committee has determined that the next meeting of the full task force will include a determination of the steps and timeline to follow with regard to town halls and a faculty survey,” Bracey’s remarks state.
Bracey also said officials are looking for the necessary personnel who will conduct the University’s internal diversity review, like a committee made of subcommittees studying faculty hiring and the student experience.
“We will share an announcement when the roster is finalized,” he said. “Shortly thereafter, we plan to distribute a [diversity, equity and inclusion] survey instrument to the community.”
The senate unanimously approved a proposal from the senate’s executive committee to adjust the timeline for electing Columbian College of Arts and Science faculty senators.
Griesshammer said the new timeline allows for a more even division of when the senators’ terms begin and end, with five senators beginning a two-year term in one year and six senators in another year. Previously, seven senators began their terms in one year and four senators in another.
“We are not suggesting that there are more members from the college,” he said. “We are just asking that instead of serving out the remainder of the term, that additional person gets a full year term.”
Bracey announced at the beginning of the meeting that Jason Zara, a professor of biomedical engineering, had stepped down from his seat representing the School of Engineering and Applied Science, and Tarek El-Ghazawi, a professor of engineering and applied science, will serve the remainder of his term.
Senators also confirmed Adriana Glenn, an associate professor of nursing, to join the professional ethics and academic freedom committee and six professors to the benefits advisory committee.

Officials have been conducting genetic sequencing on COVID-19 cases identified through GW’s in-house testing lab but have not yet attributed any positive cases at GW to the Omicron variant.
DC Health confirmed the District’s first four cases of the Omicron COVID-19 variant on Sunday.
All four cases are adults who were fully vaccinated, one of whom did not receive a booster shot while the other three people’s booster statuses were unknown, according to the release. DC Health said all residents 16 and older whose second dose was more than six months ago should get their booster shot “as soon as possible,” also encouraging everyone five and older to get vaccinated.
“The recent emergence of the Omicron variant further emphasizes the importance of vaccination, boosters and prevention strategies (e.g. masking, washing your hands frequently, choosing activities wisely, and physically distancing from others) needed to protect against COVID-19,” the release reads.
City officials said one of the Omicron cases is a woman who recently traveled to New York and Florida. Two of the other cases are women who traveled during Thanksgiving to Maryland and Virginia, respectively, but the man identified as the fourth case had no known travel, exposures or close contacts.
Individuals who were named as close contacts have been notified, DC Health said.
The World Health Organization classified the Omicron mutation as a “variant of concern” late last month.
The Omicron variant has been found in more than two dozen states including Virginia, which detected its first case of the new variant on Thursday, and Maryland, which identified its first three cases earlier this month.
Officials have been conducting genetic sequencing on COVID-19 cases identified through GW’s in-house testing lab but have not yet attributed any positive cases at GW to the Omicron variant.
DC Health said anyone in the District who is six months and older should also get the flu vaccine to stay safe.
Residents looking to receive a COVID-19 vaccine can schedule an appointment at a local pharmacy on vaccines.gov, visit a D.C. government walk-up location or call 1-855-363-0333 to request vaccination at home, according to the release.
The Medical Faculty Associates is offering walk-in appointments across from the GW Hospital at 949 23rd St. NW from 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on all weekdays.

The Clothesline Project originally started in 1990 when a woman in Massachusetts protested the fact that while 58,000 soldiers died in the Vietnam War, 51,000 women were killed by domestic and sexual abusers.
Students hung t-shirts bearing stories of sexual assault survivors in Kogan Plaza Wednesday to raise awareness about recent concerns with the Title IX Office. 
The protesters hung 64 shirts with stories about sexual assault survivors’ experiences with the Title IX Office in the center of Kogan, lining either side of a sign that read “GW Protects Rapists.” Organizers said they hope the demonstration, called the Clothesline Project, educated students about their concerns with the Title IX office and pushed them to take action to support sexual assault survivors on campus. 
Shira Strongin, a senior and a co-president of Students Against Sexual Assault who oversaw the demonstration, said the Clothesline Project gave students the opportunity to participate in a “safe manner” and visit for as long as they were comfortable.  
“​​So if they are triggered and don’t want to read it and walk by, they’re able to,” she said. “If they are interested, they’re able to. It’s a tangible form of action.”
Members of SASA were in Kogan throughout the day to help write survivors stories on the shirts so they could remain anonymous.
She said organizers chose to hold the demonstration in Kogan because the area gets the most foot traffic from students walking to and from classes. She said campus tours passing through Kogan also stopped to learn about the demonstration. 
She said she hopes parents and potential students on tours learning about survivors’ concerns with the Title IX Office will prompt the University to fulfill the changes they promised in their recent release late last month. Officials said in the release that they will enhance training for students, faculty and staff after appointing a training supervisor in the GW Police Department to engage with SASA and the Office of Advocacy and Support.
“It’s kind of the middle of the last week of classes, middle of finals, which means that students are moving through here a lot,” she said. “And there are tours that are happening, which I think is really to our benefit as far as getting GW to listen.”
The Clothesline Project model has been used across the country to raise awareness about domestic abuse and sexual assault, originating in Massachusetts in 1990 with the goal of highlighting previously ignored acts of violence like domestic abuse and sexual assault. The first project was in response to the fact that 51,000 women were killed by domestic and sexual abusers while 58,000 soldiers died in the Vietnam War at the same time.
GW Protects Rapists ​​posted on Instagram Nov. 5 that survivors could submit their stories about “feeling unsafe” at GW through a Google Form to be written on a shirt for the demonstration. Other stories included those where GWPD did not protect students, GW administration and policies put students “in harm’s way” or when students felt scared to report because they knew they would not be heard. 
“From repeated hate crimes against the Jewish community to leaving out crucial information in GWPD alerts about a sexual assaulter that hasn’t been caught to not doing anything when dozens of students call in to report a man who has been sexually harassing and stalking women on campus for weeks, there is an inherent problem that the GW administration continues failing to address,” the post states. “We are left to protect ourselves when that should never be our responsibility as students.”
The post outlines the University’s “failure to protect students” including incidents on campus like recent hate crimes against Jewish students, like the desecration of a Torah in the Tau Kappa Epsilon townhouse.
The post also mentions concerns with the University’s communication about an assault with intent to commit sexual abuse on campus earlier this semester. After an unknown suspect wounded a staff member the Metropolitan Police Department declared that the suspect assaulted the staff member with an “intent to commit first-degree sexual abuse,” but 40 minutes later, University officials sent an email to the GW community about the crime without any mention of potential sexual abuse.
She said she hopes students who attended the demonstration were prompted to take action after reading the survivors’ story.
“I hope they become more aware of the issues going around on campus and hopefully get involved,” she said. “Whether that means holding administration accountable, joining orgs, like GW SASA, or just simply helping to be a leader in creating a shift in campus culture.”
She said one story told of a survivor who experienced a Title IX coordinator “laughing” at their disclosure.
“That’s just unacceptable, horrific, negligent, just so many different things that I can’t even begin to express how awful that is,” she said. 
She said the demonstration was a “personal” experience and the sharing of survivors’ stories was both extremely powerful and painful. She said she watched students throughout the day recognize issues on campus and want to take action. 
“It’s painful to watch them,” she said. “It’s painful to hear that kind of, ‘Oh, my god’ moment that a lot of students have had. But it’s also powerful because you can see the shift happening, you can see them wanting to get involved. We’ve had a lot of conversations to be like, ‘How can I help?”’

The Saudi Arabian Embassy is located just off campus on New Hampshire Avenue near The Kennedy Center.
The D.C. Council unanimously voted Tuesday to designate a section of New Hampshire Avenue in front of the Saudi Arabian Embassy as “Jamal Khashoggi Way,” honoring the Washington Post journalist who was killed in the Saudi consulate in Turkey in 2018.
The Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission had initiated commemorative efforts for Khashoggi in 2018 when commissioners passed a resolution to rename the roadway a month after his assassination. U.S. officials have said Khashoggi’s killing was ordered by Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, although bin Salman has denied involvement in Khashoggi’s death.
Ward 2 Council member Brooke Pinto, who represents Foggy Bottom and introduced the bill, said the change is meant to remind embassy visitors of the killing, which she called an assault on freedom and democracy.
“Jamal Khashoggi knew that by shining a light on Saudi Arabia and seeking truth, he risked his freedom and, indeed, his life,” Pinto said in a statement after the bill’s introduction. “Journalists around the world and here in America face similar dangers every day, and we must never let those who seek to intimidate them succeed, because when journalism is under assault, our freedom and democracy are under assault.”
The change will be made official during a public ceremony next month, according to a release.

SA Sen. Yan Xu, ESIA-U, said he sponsored the resolution to ease “tension” between the administration and students and to offer an act of “good faith” to officials.
The Student Association Senate voted to recognize outgoing University President Thomas LeBlanc for his leadership since 2017 at its last meeting of the semester Monday.
The senate passed the President LeBlanc Recognition Act to recognize LeBlanc’s accomplishments during his tenure at GW just more than a year after the body demanded his resignation. SA Sen. Yan Xu, ESIA-U, said he sponsored the resolution to ease “tension” between administrators and students and to offer an act of “good faith” to officials.
“That’s the main reason I put through this resolution,” Xu said in a statement to The Hatchet. “It basically shows the current administration and future administration, you can work with us.”
Xu said while the resolution did not negate some of the more negative aspects of LeBlanc’s term, the senate already took action in the past to point out past “mistakes,” like the hiring of Heather Swain and LeBlanc’s use of a racially insensitive remark.
The resolution passed with at least two senators opposing. SA Vice President Kate Carpenter did not return a request for comment on the official vote count.
SA Sen. Sofia Packer, U-at-Large, partially read a statement voicing opposition to the bill before Grace Pedersen, the senate parliamentarian, called her “out of order.” Packer said passing the resolution means the senate is “ignoring the great harms” that LeBlanc caused throughout his tenure.
“I understand that it may be standard practice to do things a certain way,” Packer said. “But I think we open ourselves up to a lot of these same harms if we continue to follow a standard for a president who has been involved in so many problems at this University throughout his years.”
Carpenter, the SA vice president, announced plans for President’s Weekend Palooza, a multi-day University-wide event during President’s Day weekend in February. Carpenter said the occasion will include four main events leading up to a basketball game at the end of the weekend, and senators are welcome to serve on the planning committee for the weekend.
“This weekend will serve as a time to experience new and exciting events while rallying around school spirit and culture,” Carpenter said. “We are excited for what is in store.”
The senate passed a special resolution at the meeting to allocate $18,775 of the SA’s general fund to the Black Student Union to help cover the cost of its Black Heritage Celebration events, which also take place in February during Black History Month. BSU did not request any SA funding for BHC last February as the events were completely online, but the SA doled out $29,000 for the event in 2020.
During an executive session to discuss the resolution, senators unanimously voted to remove SA Sen. Dasia Bandy, ESIA-U, from the session and advised her not to vote on the resolution after determining her current membership with BSU as a conflict of interest. Bandy said she did not feel her membership was significant enough to warrant her removal from voting and her input on BHC would have been “valuable” in the decision to allocate funds to the celebration.
“I don’t speak to the BSU for any personal or professional reasons on a day-to-day basis for it to be a conflict of interest,” Bandy said. “But unanimously, based off of the senate, it was considered biased.”
Pedersen, the senate’s parliamentarian, said senators who are current or former members of organizations should recuse themselves from discussion and voting on those organizations.
Bandy was the only senator to abstain from voting on the BHC resolution.
The senate also unanimously passed the Civic Day of Service Election Day Act, a resolution calling on GW to cancel classes and declare a “Civic Day of Service” every two years on Election Day.
The senate unanimously passed the Inclusive Transportation Act, a resolution urging the University to ask the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority to include part-time law students in the U-Pass program.
The Student Bar Association Senate passed a similar resolution last month calling on the University to include part-time students in U-Pass, which provides unlimited rides to undergraduates at a rate of $100 per semester, while full-time graduate students can choose whether to participate in the program.
SA Sen. Cody Ingraham, Law-G and the sponsor of the resolution, said law students who are enrolled in similar credit hours at other universities with U-Pass have been allowed to enroll. Carpenter responded to these concerns in a meeting last month, saying WMATA sets a policy restricting U-Pass enrollment to full-time students, so GW did not choose to exclude part-time students.
The senate unanimously passed the GW Men’s Rowing Varsity Reinstatement Act, which urges GW to reinstate the varsity status of men’s rowing after the University cut the program and six other varsity teams at the end of last academic year.
Senators also unanimously passed three bills updating the SA’s bylaws at the meeting.
The first revises the SA’s financial allocation process. Under the legislation, the executive and legislative branches must request remaining money from the SA’s general fund for the three branches’ use after members of the financial services and allocations committee finish handing allocations to graduate umbrella organizations.
The branches together may receive either 5 percent or $40,000 – whichever is the highest total – from the fund, according to the legislation. The judicial branch will receive $300 of that sum for the fiscal year, according to the bill.
The bill states that the branches formerly would automatically receive the remaining cash from the general fund without any formal request process, with the executive branch receiving two-thirds and the legislative branch receiving one-third.
The legislation also clarified the budget hearing process that the financial services and allocations committee holds for student organizations.
The University cut the SA’s budget by about $100,000 this fiscal year. Xu, the finance committee chairperson, said the SA’s finance committee approved about $15,000 dollars for 24 co-sponsor applications since Nov. 15, including a $1,584 allocation to the GW Panhellenic Association for its formal recruitment period.
The second bill codified the bylaws with the results of a referendum that students passed last month to switch ranked-choice voting in multi-seat senate elections with plurality-at large voting.
The third bill updated the bylaws to allow the SA to host a University-wide contest to redesign the SA emblem with the image falling under the executive branch’s jurisdiction, which the legislation expanded.
Senators also filled the two existing vacancies on the senate at the meeting. The senate confirmed first-year graduate student Kiley Mulligan to a Milken Institute School of Public Health at-large seat and junior Chloe Wagner, the former Joint Elections Commission chair, to an undergraduate Columbian College of Arts and Sciences seat.
Chief Financial Officer Mark Diaz, who delivered a report to the SA, said GW’s $22 million three-year plan to enhance campus accessibility across its buildings will include the Lerner Health and Wellness Center, which is set to shut down for part of 2022 for roof repairs and HVAC renovations. Diaz said officials would use the $22 million to address a $300 million overall deferred maintenance backlog – a process when officials implement facilities and maintenance updates that are most affordable and top priorities for the University.

Officials had added a two-day fall break starting in 2016 after student leaders called for a break before Thanksgiving break, but it was shortened in recent years.
GW will extend next year’s fall break to two days, according to the academic calendar.
The updated fall break will occur on Monday, Oct. 24 and Tuesday, Oct. 25 next year instead of a Friday like the past two years. Student Association Vice President Kate Carpenter said she and SA President Brandon Hill discussed in October extending fall break with Imani Cheers, the interim senior associate provost for undergraduate education, and Christopher Bracey, the interim provost.
Officials added a two-day fall break starting in 2016 after student leaders called for a break before Thanksgiving. The break had been shortened to one day for the past two academic years.
Carpenter said not having a longer fall break this fall “greatly inhibited” the student experience this semester because the longer period provides students a break from classes and a chance to catch up on their school work. Students were mentally and academically “exhausted” this semester after not having a significant break until Thanksgiving, she said.
“Having fall break moving forward will be I think an essential for students,” Carpenter said. “I think that it is not only an essential to catch up on schoolwork, but also to just catch up mentally and be able to take care of ourselves moving forward.”
Hill did not return a request for comment.

Unvaccinated community members who have University-approved medical or religious exemptions will be required to quarantine for seven days if they traveled outside of the District, Virginia or Maryland over winter break.
Officials will grant students returning from winter break with campus access for the first two days of classes before requiring them to take a COVID-19 test.
Administrators said Wednesday that students who are near campus the week before classes should schedule a test before the semester begins to avoid peak testing times, adding that campus access holds will be reinstated on Jan. 12. Students who test between Jan. 3 and Jan. 7 will have one hour of free parking at the G street Garage if they validate their ticket at the testing center.
“We strongly encourage you to test the day you return,” the email reads. “Testing hours are available online. Schedule your test now, or before you leave for winter break, for the day you will return to campus.”
The email states students who return on Jan. 3 will also receive a two-day grace period before campus access holds due to overdue testing go into effect on Jan. 5. Officials said students who need “immediate campus access” and are having trouble scheduling an appointment should email the COVID Campus Support Team at CCST@gwu.edu or call the coronavirus information line.
“If you do not have an appointment and use the walkup line, you should anticipate a wait time much longer than normal,” officials said. “We ask that you use this option only as a last resort.”
Students will have to wait approximately one hour after their coronavirus test before their GWorld card is activated to unlock campus buildings.
Officials announced in the email that they anticipate “very high demand” for testing on Jan. 10, 11 and 12 as students return to campus.
Officials said students can also get tested outside of GW to stay in compliance with the University’s testing policy. Students who choose to do so should upload their external coronavirus PCR test to their medical portal.
“This is another way to avoid peak testing times January 10-12 and to avoid access interruption for testing non-compliance,” the email reads.
Students who need a coronavirus test before traveling home for winter break should schedule their test for 48 to 72 hours prior to leaving. Students who get tested before 7 p.m. on Dec. 22 will receive their results by the end of the following day, officials said.
