Hill said said the SA will search for recreation space that students can use in place of the Lerner Health and Wellness Center, which will close for a portion of 2022.
The Student Association will prioritize engaging graduate students and enhancing student health resources this spring, SA President Brandon Hill announced at a SA Senate meeting Monday.
Hill said that the SA executive branch will undertake 12 semester-long initiatives, including plans to establish a graduate student newsletter, organize pop-up STI testing through the Colonial Health Center and redesign the SA logo. He said the SA will work to create diversity and inclusion course requirements for University degrees and search for recreation space that students can use in place of the Lerner Health and Wellness Center, which will close for a portion of 2022.
Hill said he and Vice President Kate Carpenter welcomed interim University President Mark Wrighton to GW after he started his term earlier this month in place of former University President Thomas LeBlanc. He said Wrighton expressed “excitement” to work with the SA and an eagerness to help get GW “back on track” during his meetings with Hill and Carpenter last semester.
“We welcome Dr. Wrighton as our interim University president,” Hill said at the meeting. “Myself and Vice President Carpenter had the pleasure of meeting with him last semester in addition to a handful of conversations.”
Hill said he started attending GW as a part-time student this semester – a move that he said would allow him to dedicate more time to SA-related matters.
“It also gives me an opportunity to experience firsthand how our University treats its part-time students, which I think will open my eyes to a lot more we can do with our advocacy,” Hill said.
SA Sen. Derek Lo, CCAS-U, announced that the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences will create a diversity, equity and inclusion council during the summer, which comes after “months of advocacy” from Lo and former SA Sen. Charlene Richards, CCAS-U. He said the council will consist of faculty, staff and students who will work with CCAS leadership on activities and initiatives for the council, which will accept self-nominations through Friday.
Senators also unanimously passed the Bylaws Part V Update Act, which added three sections to the SA’s finance bylaws – prohibited spending of SA and University funds, temporary funding policies and political activities.
SA Sen. Yan Xu, ESIA-U and the sponsor of the bill, said the spending bylaws will prohibit student organizations from requesting funds for social media advertising services, miscellaneous costs and food and drinks at internal student organization meetings. He said the finance committee can now reallocate funds from events that move online because of University decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic as part of its newly created temporary funding policies.
“This section will allow the finance committee to put temporary funding policies in line with any unexpected changes,” Xu said. “So those items and unexpected changes are, for example, we change from online classes to in person or we change in-person class to hybrid.”
The University confirmed Wednesday that it would return to in-person learning next week after starting the spring semester with classes online. Officials recorded 748 total positive COVID-19 cases in the past week through Tuesday, with an 8.2 percent positivity rate from Jan. 4 to Jan. 11, according to GW’s COVID-19 dashboard.
Xu added that the new bylaws will prevent student organizations from spending SA funds on political organizations or donating funds to political candidates.
The senate also unanimously confirmed first-year law student Allison Finn as the secretary for graduate student life in the executive cabinet.
The next senate meeting will take place Jan. 24 at 8:30 p.m. in the University Student Center.

Senators who voted in opposition said health concerns tied to the pandemic and a lack of feedback from students about the future of remote learning should stall the return to in-person operations.
The Student Bar Association Senate rejected a resolution calling for officials to resume in-person learning at its meeting Tuesday, a day before the University confirmed its plans to return to in-person classes next week.
In an 8-13 roll-call vote, the senate voted against the Virtual and In-Person Learning Joint Resolution, which would have urged officials to reinstate in-person learning when it is physically safe to do so and acknowledge the mental health struggles of students when taking online classes. Senators who voted in opposition said health concerns tied to the pandemic and a lack of feedback from students about the future of remote learning should stall the return to in-person operations.
GW Law and the rest of the University held classes remotely during the first week of the spring semester amid a surge in COVID-19 cases spurred by the spreading Omicron variant. Officials recorded 748 total positive COVID-19 cases in the past week through Tuesday, with an 8.2 percent positivity rate from Jan. 4 to Jan. 11, according to GW’s COVID-19 dashboard.
SBA Sen. Nicole Karem, a second-year law student who sponsored the resolution, said it was meant to target mental health concerns that students face while taking classes online more than “forcing” the University to switch back to in-person classes. She said the resolution would not “sacrifice” students’ physical health because it requests the University to return to in-person operations only when it is safe to do so.
“We do not want the administration to feel like we are demanding to return before it is safe, but we do not want the decision to be delayed after the health risk is no longer a viable one,” Karem said at the meeting.
Helen Jasper, the SBA’s director of disability, said she was opposed to the resolution because a return to in-person learning would spark a surge in COVID-19 cases and staffing issues at GW. She said an immediate return to in-person operations or classes would reflect a disregard for students with disabilities because they may be more susceptible to severe illness from infection with the coronavirus.
“I think emphasizing a ‘return to campus’ now before a clear end to Omicron is in sight, all this body is doing in supporting the resolution, and specifically that phrase in the resolution, would be expressing a disregard for the health and safety of our fellow students and teachers,” Jasper said. “Particularly those who, for whatever reason, be it age, pregnancy, disability status and so on, are more vulnerable to the virus.”
Senators also passed an amended version of the Spring 2022 Community Town Hall Act, which SBA President Jordan Michel vetoed after it passed during the last senate meeting. SBA Sen. Rurik Asher Baumrin, a third-year law student, proposed revisions in three clauses,  which the senate approved – like removing the word “unilaterally” in reference to University decisions made without student support – to address Michel’s concerns with the bill.
Michel will now have the option to sign or veto the revised bill.
Senators also unanimously voted to schedule eight meetings this semester. The next senate meeting take place Jan. 25.

COVID-19 cases in D.C. have skyrocketed over the past month and a half, and the District recorded the highest number of COVID-19 cases in the country. Due to the high demand of testing resources across the country, folks have been struggling to get their hands on either the PCR or rapid antigen tests. High demand, long lines and long distances are deterring factors for people to get tested. The Medical Faculty Associates website even says that due to “high demand,” those who seek COVID-19 tests might be asked to go to another facility for testing. 
To aid the non-GW D.C. community through the COVID-19 spike driven by the Omicron variant, GW should consider opening extra testing sites to test non-GW District residents, work with Mayor Muriel Bowser’s office to bolster testing efforts in the District and fund tests for residents who can’t afford to buy a rapid antigen test.
But for the GW community, testing has been blissfully simple. The sites have been easily accessible, the results come within 48 hours and appointments are usually available. This has made life at GW easier and has proven to keep COVID-19 at bay over the course of the past semester. If the University further extends some of these resources to the larger D.C. community, it would increase the chances of residents who contract the virus of being aware and promptly isolating themselves from others.
Though the MFA already offers testing in three locations in D.C, the University should open additional walk-up sites that are open early in the morning and close late at night. The MFA sites only offer tests for a couple hours in the middle of the day, which is not a feasible period for people who work during that time.
Some universities in New York are already working as community testing centers on a large scale. Last week, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul announced that in a partnership with State Universities of New York and Syracuse University, the state government will open several new testing sites across the country on college campuses. These sites are open for longer than the testing sites offered by the MFA, depending on the day and location. 
GW has a large public health apparatus and should use this to the community’s benefit. Similar to New York and SUNY, the University can partner with Bowser’s office to open more testing sites across the District. GW should also increase the number of testing sites on campus that are open to non-GW D.C. residents rather than limiting it to the couple of sites run by the MFA. 
Though the District government does provide pick up and drop off PCR testing, results normally take anywhere from 3-5 days, which is a long turnaround. Because the new variants are getting increasingly transmissible, it is important for people to know their results within the next day or two to know whether they are contagious before seeing people. It would be helpful if GW opened more testing sites with quicker turnarounds.
Moreover, those who are not insured incur costs if they go looking for a PCR test at MFA sites. It costs $150 to be “evaluated for testing” for residents who don’t have insurance.  New testing sites should not charge people who come by for any kind of COVID-19 tests, either rapid antigen or PCR, so as to be as accessible to the community as possible.  These sites should be funded through the D.C. government while GW provides employees and space to carry testing out. 
GW has done a phenomenal job testing the GW community and getting results in on time. But for those who don’t have access to these resources, the holidays and winter season have proved to be difficult for finding any kind of testing. Hopefully, the University can use its resources to be a force for good in the D.C. area by offering an extra site to boost the nationwide testing effort.

Despite an early lead, the Colonials quickly fell behind and the Rams kept up the pressure in the second half. 
Men’s basketball fell to VCU on the road Tuesday night.
The Colonials (4-10, 0-2 A-10) were routed by the Rams (10-4, 3-0 A-10) in a 85-57 blowout. Despite an early 5-2 lead in the opening minutes, GW quickly fell behind and struggled to catch up for the rest of the night.
Junior guard James Bishop led the team with 16 points followed by sophomore guard Joe Bamisile and freshman guard Brayon Freeman with 11 and 10 points respectively.
On the other side of the court, sophomore guard Adrian Baldwin Jr. racked up 16 points while hitting 4-of-5 buckets from deep to stem any chance of a Colonial comeback.
Though the Colonials conceded an early turnover that led to a basket, Bishop struck back on the next two GW possessions, hitting a jumper inside the paint and then sinking a 3-point bucket to give the Colonials a 5-2 lead.
VCU then went on a 13-0 run that left the Colonials scoreless for the next 5:34 seconds of game time. Freeman ended the drought on a jumper with 13:13 left to play in the half but the Rams continued to pile on the score.
After Bamisile hit a 3-pointer to bring the Colonials back within 5 at the 12:10 mark, VCU hit a jumper and a back to back threes to reestablish some distance. The Colonials cobbled together a few baskets before Baldwin hit a wide open three to set off an unfortunate series of events for the Colonials as the half wound down.
Bamisile was called for goaltending at one end, followed by two missed layups by junior forward Hunter Dean and Bamisile, before Bishop turned the ball over inside the Colonials’ half of the court, forcing a shooting foul by Dean. GW continued to turn the ball over, giving up 13 in total through the first half, leading to 13 points off turnovers by the Rams.
The Colonials also shot just 33% from the line compared to the Rams’ 80%. Bishop, a 75.8% shooter from the line, missed both of his free throws with just over two minutes left in the half.
Moments later, Bamisile missed a dunk and then failed to convert on both of his free throws the next possession. But Bamisile finished with a dunk off a fast break to end the half with the Colonials trailing 42-22.
The Rams kept up the pressure in the second half, as senior guard KeShawn Curry swiped the ball from senior guard Amir Harris and finished with an emphatic dunk with 19:06 remaining in the game.
VCU dominated the Colonials near the basket all night, snagging 48 total rebounds compared to GW’s 30 while also racking up 44 points in the paint compared to GW’s 30. Though the Colonials finished with 18 turnovers to the Rams’ 17, VCU was able to capitalize on GW’s lack of ball security, netting 24 points off turnovers while the Colonials scored just 8.
After falling behind by a 29 point deficit with 11:28 remaining and a score of 66-37, the Colonials rallied for a stretch, going on a 16-2 scoring run bolstered by four turnovers by the Rams.
After pulling within 15 points at a score of 68-53, the Rams found their rhythm again. Baldwin sank a three with 3:52 left to play to end the Colonials’ run and kick off a VCU 9-2 scoring run and they never looked back.
GW did not score any field goals for the remaining 4:10 of the game, netting just four free throws before eventually capitulating to a score of 85-57.
The Colonials will return to the Smith Center Monday for a 2 p.m. tipoff against George Mason.

Barcelona Wine Bar's chorizo is cut into oval medallions, which are charred and tossed together with braised figs.
Students may typically stop by Barcelona Wine Bar for drinks and a fun atmosphere, but the consistently tasty tapas-style bites and extensive charcuterie and cheese selection keep them coming back.
Barcelona operates locations in Cathedral Heights and at 1622 14th St. NW just north of Logan Circle. With late weekend hours, a longer alcohol menu than food menu and friendly staff, Barcelona makes for the ideal lively dinner spot to relax with friends.
Situated between Sette Osteria and Pearl Dive Oyster Palace on one of the busiest strips of 14th Street, Barcelona is equipped with a large heated outside patio dining area, a bar area with seating and a main dining room which is well-suited for larger groups. The high ceilings, low light, dark wooden walls and stone floors make the space feel more upscale than it actually is. A glass encased wine room near the kitchen and a giant rectangular multi-media art piece in the dining room ties the bougie atmosphere together.
Drinks essentially function as appetizers at Barcelona – I recommend starting with a pitcher of the red sangria ($30) for the table. If you’re ordering solo, try out a wine flight of aperitivos ($13.50), which are traditionally pre-meal drinks, with half pours each of BarCava sparkling wine, La Cigarrera dry sherry and El Bandarra red vermouth.
To start, decide on some cheese and charcuterie to share with your table. For three people, I ordered the Idiazábal smoked raw sheep’s cheese, Drunken Goat, a red-wine soaked semi-soft goat cheese, and jamón serrano thin sliced dry-cured Spanish ham. All three were presented on a dark stone board with a dollop of an apricot fruit jam and a basket of warm rustic white bread. The Drunken Goat was my favorite with a balance of richness and acidity from the subtle flavor of the wine.
After nibbling on the charcuterie board and sipping on your sangria, you’ll probably be ready to select a few tapas from the more than 30 options on the menu. The servers are helpful with any any clarifying questions you have and can recommend popular options if you get stuck.
My two friends and I ordered six tapas plates total in two waves and were sufficiently full by the end of our meal. We first ordered the whipped ricotta with herbs ($9), patatas bravas ($7) and hanger steak slices with truffle vinaigrette ($11.50). The patatas bravas, crispy fried potato chunks, were served with a thick, smoky tomato sauce base layer and a light garlic aioli on top and are absolutely addictive.
But the tapas dish that really blew my taste buds away was the chorizo with sweet & sour figs ($9) which we ordered along with the gambas al ajillo, garlic shrimp, ($9.50) and truffled bikini jamón serrano sandwich ($8.50) to complete our meal.
The chorizo was encased and sliced into oval medallions which were charred and served mixed together with balsamic braised figs. The dish is uniformly brown, sticky and not completely attractive in presentation, but the flavors are bright, strong and balanced.
You may be used to eating Chorizo crumbled or spread but the hearty slices of sausage with a moist interior and snappy ring of casing on the outside was the right choice to balance the soft, jammy texture of the figs. The figs added a distinct earthy sweetness to the dish but were caramelized with a balsamic vinegar sauce which created a bright, sour flavor that was quite strong but appealing.
For desert options you can choose from four options including flan catalán ($7), olive oil cake ($9), crepas with seasonal fruit and citrus cream ($8) or chocolate cake with coffee cream and almond crumble ($9).
Whether you’re a Barcelona regular who’s hoping to relive the pre-pandemic experience of limoncello shots being poured directly into people’s mouths or you’re just a tapas fan, make a reservation at this wine bar next time you’re planning dinner with friends.

Wrighton will make his first appearance at the senate since September when Board Chair Grace Speights announced that he would replace former University President Thomas LeBlanc at the start of January.
Mark Wrighton will appear before the Faculty Senate for his first time as interim University president, and a committee will review the status of GW’s financial wellbeing at Friday’s Faculty Senate meeting, according to a senate agenda.
Wrighton will make his first appearance at the senate since September, when Board Chair Grace Speights announced that he would replace former University President Thomas LeBlanc at the start of January – four months earlier than when LeBlanc was first expected to step down. The senate’s fiscal planning and budgeting committee will also present its annual report, which summarizes University finances and major sources of revenue and expenses for the current fiscal year.
Last year’s report consisted of a summary of GW’s credit rating during the fiscal year, which Moody’s Investors Service affirmed at an A1 rating with a stable outlook. The report also outlined fiscal opportunities and challenges, including the varying impacts of enrollment trends on University revenue.
Faculty senators Joe Cordes, a professor of economics and public policy and public administration, and Susan Kulp, a professor of accountancy, co-chair the committee.

Officials had pushed up the deadline to submit booster documentation from Feb. 1 to the first day of classes as they announced that the first week of the semester would be virtual.
Updated: Jan. 12, 2022 at 2:59 p.m.
The University reaffirmed its plans to resume in-person learning next week as COVID-19 cases in D.C. remain high and the spring semester is underway.
Officials said in an email to the GW community Wednesday that in-person classes will resume Tuesday, research and lab spaces will be able to return to full operations and University employees should return to their normal schedules from before the virtual period. Officials are “strongly” encouraging community members to wear KN95 masks, N95 masks, which will be distributed throughout campus, or double-mask, the email states.
“Our Medical Advisory Group continues to monitor the rates of COVID-19 transmission on our campuses and locally, and we will provide any updates to you,” the email states.
In-person social gatherings will remain virtual or postponed, all campus facilities will be closed to the public and library study rooms and tables will be limited to single occupancy, according to the email. Athletic events will continue to take place without ticketed fans, and the Lerner Health and Wellness Center and West Hall Fitness Center will be closed.
The email states that officials plan to resume in-person activities in a “phased approach” starting Feb. 1.
The announcement comes after the University’s daily total positive COVID-19 cases reached an all-time high Jan. 5 with 196 cases. Mayor Muriel Bowser reinstated the District’s public health emergency Tuesday.
Officials announced a COVID-19 booster vaccine requirement in December after they identified the first cases of the Omicron variant on campus. The University pushed up its deadline to submit booster documentation from Feb. 1 to the first day of spring classes in tandem with an announcement that the first week of the semester would be virtual.
Officials restricted on-campus students from visiting other residence halls for the start of the spring semester and required on-campus students to quarantine in their residence halls pending two negative COVID-19 tests, taken three days apart.
Georgetown and American universities announced in December that they will hold classes remotely until Jan. 30.
GW administrators moved remaining final exams online late last semester and canceled in-person events when COVID-19 cases on campus first began to spike.
The District had the highest average rate of daily total COVID-19 cases in the country in late December.
As students head back to Foggy Bottom for a spring semester beginning online, read the latest on Omicron’s impact at GW.

Merhat Sharipzhanov, a newsroom correspondent for Radio Free Europe, said recent Russian military intervention to disband protesters in Kazakhstan is an attempt to assert influence in Central Asia.
A panel of experts discussed protests and governmental collapse in Kazakhstan Monday, where Russian military troops recently intervened to stifle ongoing demonstrations.
More than 1,000 viewers tuned into a live stream of the virtual talk, which featured two professors, two researchers and a journalist who said recent instability in Kazakhstan and clashes between protesters and Russian soldiers have interfered with reporting on the unrest. Marlene Laruelle, the director of the Institute for European, Russian and Eurasian Studies, moderated the event, which was hosted by the institute and the Central Asia Program, both housed in the Elliott School of International Affairs.
Merhat Sharipzhanov – a central newsroom correspondent for Radio Free Europe, a U.S. government-funded news broadcast based in the Czech Republic – said citizens who are calling for the removal of the country’s top leadership because of concerns about public corruption, slow economic development and a lack of democratic reforms have fueled the recent protests in Kazakhstan. He said the Russian military intervention that sent about 2,500 troops into Kazakhstan late last week to disband protestors, who Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev labeled “terrorists,” is an attempt to assert influence in Central Asia.
Sharipzhanov said the protests, which started earlier this month in response to rising fuel prices, spread nationwide as more Kazakhs demanded the resignation of the country’s top leadership, the return of a directly elected government and economic concessions.
“For anyone who is a grown up person, it is incredible to believe, and as a person who served in the Soviet Army for myself, 20,000 troops is impossible to believe,” Sharipzhanov said during the panel discussion.
Sharipzhanov said reporters covering the protests struggled to determine where Russian troops were stationed in Kazakhstan because Kazakh government officials provided little information about the protests and military response. He said government press officials have not indicated whether Kazakh President Tokayev has remained in the country or explained the level of security in the capital city of Nur-Sultan.
“We lack complete information because, among all these reports, the statements like 20,000 troops or terrorists coming to Almaty don’t give us any ground to believe anything the government says,” he said.
Barbara Junisbai, an associate professor of organizational studies at Pitzer College, said ethnic Kazakhs have been economically and politically disadvantaged in Kazakhstan because of government neglect and a lack of economic opportunity, which Russian influence in the Kazakh government has worsened in past decades.
“Kazakhstan used to be a place where the middle class expected to grow and expand and people expected that their life would get better,” Junisbai said.
She said even though the Kazakh government has labeled protestors as “terrorists,” most of the demonstrators’ actions have been peaceful in hopes of ending poor economic conditions and military reprisals. She said many Kazakhs feel they have been forced into action because of declining standards of living and middle-class conditions around the country.
“I think that there is a real protest element, and I am sympathetic to it,” she said. “I feel that it is correct and my sympathy goes to the protesters.”
Temur Umarov – a research consultant at Carnegie Moscow Center, a think tank based in Moscow that focuses on domestic and foreign policy – said Kazakhstan has always been a “middle ground” region where major world powers could join together and cooperate on international policy for the nation. He said the recent protests and Russian government intervention could undermine the country’s reputation with the United States and European countries because of its new reliance on Russian aid and its rejection of Kazakh calls for constitutional changes.
He said the current situation in Kazakhstan is similar to demonstrations in Belarus in 2020 and 2021, where thousands of Belarusians protested reports of election fraud and mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to the imprisonment or exile of most major opposition leaders in the country.
“For Kazakhstan’s future, I think it means that we will in the near future see some very similar political moves that we saw in Russia and after protests that we saw in Belarus after 2020,” he said.
Umarov said China will not likely soon take any direct action against Russia or Kazakhstan, even though a large ethnic Chinese population lives in Kazakhstan and the rest of Central Asia. He said the Chinese government prioritizes political stability within Central Asian countries over economic development and democratic reform.
“Right now, China doesn’t care whether stability will be reached in Kazakhstan with Kazakh’s own internal forces or Russia, which is a very good Chinese partner and will come and make the situation stable,” Umarov said.
Nargis Kassenova, a senior fellow and the director of the Program on Central Asia at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University, said the protests in Kazakhstan will likely spark political reforms, like anti-corruption policies. She said President Tokayev has been discussing potential reforms for years, but he has been unclear about which policies he might unveil after the protests’ conclusion.
“I think there is an understanding at all levels that the country is in a very bad shape,” Kassenova said. “Now the situation is explosive.”
Pauline Jones, a professor of political science and the director of the digital Islamic Studies Curriculum at the University of Michigan, said Kazakhstan’s economy has been in decline for more than five years and has contributed to recent unrest. She said Kazakhstan has suffered from years of declining oil prices, public sector corruption and constraints on growth in the private sector.
“I think this is a crucial question that both of my colleagues raised in their remarks was whether Tokayev will continue to choose repression over reform,” Jones said. “Will he engage in the political and economic reform that is needed and that he promised?”
Jones said the crackdown on the protests by the Kazakh government will lead to fewer democratic elections and less popular representation in public life in the country. She said Kazakhstan will also be more reliant on support from countries like China and Russia in the coming years because of the Russian military involvement and its gradual move away from the West.
“This is not just a move or a turn toward more repressive authoritarianism and away from soft authoritarianism, but I think it’s also clearly a turn towards authoritarian solidarity with Russia and China,” Jones said.
