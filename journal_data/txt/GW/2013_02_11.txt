Clarification appended
Some administrators are concerned with healthy eating practices for students, but on-campus dining does not reflect that. J Street, which is the first introduction students have with campus dining, disincentivizes healthy eating.
The food is expensive and does not match the quality of other on-campus options. Even a bottle of water at J Street costs more than double the cost of a bottle of water at Whole Foods. And the price for an apple is significantly higher than other campus venues like the GW Deli, Gallery Place in Ivory Tower and Foggy Bottom Grocery Store.
And unlike many other venues, J Street does not display nutritional facts for every eatery. There are nutrition facts listed separately for some options, like the pizza at Pesto, the foods at Thyme and the hot and vegan bars, but for every item.
The University should add calorie counts to every J Street menu. It would be a tangible step toward promoting positive health and educating students about food choices. Giving students the option to see calorie counts before they buy food could influence their choices.
This practice is common at eateries across the country. Campus restaurants like Au Bon Pain and Potbelly’s Sandwich Shop, which take GWorld, also offer calorie counts.
Associate Dean Tim Miller has started a campaign to teach students how to make healthier choices while in college. Miller’s initiative will consist of cooking classes and weight loss seminars to help students live healthier lifestyles.
A calorie count would complement Miller’s initiative, which is commendable.
As a result, students would be able to see how many calories they consume with every cheeseburger or sushi roll they buy, potentially pushing them into healthier habits. It would be a simple way to spark awareness and encourage students to eat healthy foods on a daily basis.
This addition would benefit J Street as well: Examining the calorie count and supply and demand for certain foods would help campus dining officials understand students’ preferences and tailor offerings accordingly.
Every year, J Street faces student complaints, whether it is regarding the poor food quality or high prices.
A staggering 29.2 percent of college students were overweight or obese in 2011, according to the American College Health Association. And while it’s not a complete solution, a calorie count could go a long way in helping raise awareness of healthy eating options on campus.

This editorial has been updated to reflect that some eateries at J Street do display nutritional values, but all do not.

GWs top political student groups announced on Monday that two big-name speakers will visit campus: a third-party presidential hopeful and the man who propelled President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign.
Three-time presidential candidate and libertarian powerhouse Ron Paul will speak March 4 at 7 p.m. The former Texas Republican retired from the House of Representatives this year after 30 years.
Jim Messina, Obama’s campaign manager and top adviser, will speak Feb. 20 at 6:30 p.m. in front of about 300 people. Admission is free for the hour-long talk. The venue has yet to be determined, Chase Hardin, the communications director for the College Democrats, said.
Chairwoman of the College Republicans Sinead Casey said Paul would comment on the future of the Republican party.
“I am proud that our organization is bringing such an iconic figure for American democracy, whose following extends beyond party lines,” Casey said.
The College Republicans will give priority seating to dues-paying members of the group with a selection of free tickets available for non-members, which can be purchased on their website. Tickets will free for members of the GW community and $10 for the general public.

When I was 13 and I told my mother I had my first boyfriend, she told me to “be safe.”
“Be safe.” The two words you hear when you ride a bike for the first time or as a reminder to put on a seat belt. The two words you hear urging you to take an extra jacket or to wait for the walk signal. The same two words you hear telling you to tie your shoes or not to talk to strangers. I was confused. Shouldn’t she have been elated like my teenage, boy-obsessed friends? Shouldn’t she be peppering me with questions, trying to figure out the identity of this mystery boy?
What I couldn’t understand at the time was that my mother is a statistic. She is one of the 22 million women in the United States who have been raped. She is among the one in three women globally who has been beaten or sexually abused in her lifetime. She is part of the 29.9 percent that, between the ages of 11 and 17, has survived a completed or attempted rape. She is part of the 73 percent of sexual assaults that were perpetrated by a non-stranger.
It took her 15 years to come forward and work through the trauma and shame. Fifteen years to not feel responsible and understand that no matter what she said, did or wore, she was not at fault.
Although my mother’s story is unique, her struggle is common. Most survivors of sexual violence find it difficult to ask for help and share their stories.
That’s why Deputy Title IX Coordinator Tara Pereira’s efforts to extend the 180-day window for filing a complaint alleging sexual harassment or assault are so valiant. The more time we can offer survivors, the more realistic it is that individuals will find the strength to acknowledge, process and take the initiative to work through their incidents and reach out to the University for support. I urge the Faculty Senate to sympathize with survivors and vote to extend the six-month time frame.
However, it’s important to understand that the 180-day window comes from the Department of Education Office of Civil Rights’ model policy for filing a complaint. If any victim of sexual assault were to seek help from the University – regardless of time elapsed since the incident – GW would provide resources to aid in their recovery. GW has recently implemented many changes to make its services and policies more survivor-friendly. This proposal to extend the 180-day window is just another example of the progress GW is making to help victims of sexual abuse.
When looking at the violence in our world, many use distance as a coping strategy. We tell ourselves that it could never happen to us or someone we know. We push it to the back of our minds, or out of our heads altogether, so we feel safe. So, when something happens again and again, we just keep reminding ourselves that it could never happen to us or our community. But the truth is, no one anywhere is exempt.

Sodexo workers held a demonstration Friday at noon, alleging that J Street managers have violated their union contract by cutting hours and staff.
In the past two months, Sodexo, the company that provides GW’s dining services, has cut workers’ hours from 40 hours a week to 30 and laid off about 10 employees since December, several workers said.
All Sodexo employees, as well as dozens of students, donned buttons displaying their support for Sodexo workers and the union’s rights.
Sam Nelson, a member of GW’s Progressive Student Union, helped organize the protest to raise awareness among students.
“We need to consider Sodexo workers part of the GW community, like professors and faculty,” Nelson said.
Allison Burket, an organizer with UNITE HERE, the union that represents Sodexo employees at GW, said while venues at the eateries have changed, many workers have been there for upward of 20 years.
“The relationship is strained,” she said.
Burket and UNITE HERE declined to provide a copy of the union contract, which was last fixed in 2011. The next negotiation is set for 2014.
J Street general manager Bernadette Thomas said Sodexo is “following the process outlined in the [collective bargaining] agreement” agreed upon in 2011. She added that recent staffing changes still allowed workers with scaled back hours to receive health insurance.
“The changes that were recently implemented fall within the guidelines of that 2011 contract,” Thomas said.
She declined to comment when asked why workers’ hours were cut.
Sodexo employee Rochelle Kelly said workers sometimes serve up to 50 students at a time due to the layoffs, and that managers have also screamed at workers and discouraged them from talking to students.
“What they’re taking us through is just emotional, stressful and is a problem with everybody,” she said.
Former Sodexo employee Rosita McCollum said she was fired last week after 12 years as a server, and many employees say the recent layoffs make the working environment uncomfortable.
A cook for Metro Diner, Therrece Brown, said she is worried about her future with Sodexo and whether management will keep her around.
Sodexo employees across the city, from school cafeterias, to hospitals and government buildings, are organizing a city-wide rally at the African American Civil War Memorial Feb. 28.

Still letting your parents take care of your taxes? The Center for Student Engagement wants that to change.
Starting next fall, students will be able to attend weekly seminars called “Big Adult Topics” and learn not only how to file taxes, but also how to pay off student debt and start saving for retirement.
“The challenge we have is that seniors don’t want to think about this until they have to think about it,” CSE director Tim Miller said. “We have to get across to them [that] you need to know this before you think you need to know it.”
The student life office has focused on post-college skills since it was created in 2011, but Miller said too many of the events were busts, failing to attract students.
These sessions, however, will be taught by adults who “can teach people real-life skills, instead of a financial planner who’s going to be scary about it,” Miller said.  He hopes to bring in speakers who graduated from GW and have since figured out the real world, as well as employees from around campus. The first event kicked off Jan. 30, and focused on planning for retirement.
It was led by director of GW Housing Programs Seth Weinshel and another CSE leader Andrew Goretsky, both of whom Miller called “two of the most frugal, future-planning people I know.” The duo outlined different combinations to fund retirement, like opening an Individual Retirement Account and pensions.
Miller said if students theoretically waited to start saving for retirement at 35, instead of starting at 25, they would end up with $500,000 in their personal retirement accounts instead of $1 million.
The sessions will highlight tips that Miller said most people don’t know, like how to make an extra $3,600 a year by investing, which would also put students in a lower tax bracket.
Matthew Grossman, a senior mechanical engineering major, said he is intrigued by the plan.
“I’ve never had to do taxes, so something to teach me how to do that would be pretty nice,” Grossman said, adding he had not heard of the programs before.
But senior Amita Achutuni said she didn’t know if she would want to go. Achutuni said she already knows how to file taxes, but added that she would be interested in testing out the program.
“I think if it became more of a thing that they did for the entire senior class and it was promoted towards that, then I’d probably go,” Achutuni, a political science major and business administration minor, said.

The University is jolting fundraising for its all-but-final strategic plan and could set off some ideas within the next two years.
The 10-year plan, which could cost up to $400 million, hinges on fundraising success. Officials have begun pitching the its tenets – from doubling the number of enrolled international students to more immersive study abroad programs – at small dinners with top donors, Vice President of Development and Alumni Relations Mike Morsberger said Friday.
“While I’m hoping the small dinners draw some very big gifts, we’re trying to spread the word and build the base,” Morsberger said. “We’re responding to everyone’s wants and needs, but this is really something we can sell.”
Though administrators say the plan is mostly final after 16 months of crafting, the timeline for schools to execute it remains fuzzy.
After the plan’s final hurdle – a Board of Trustees vote over the next few weeks – Provost Steven Lerman will convene task forces to figure out how to implement ideas such as building new cross-field research centers. He said each group would include administrators, faculty and students, though he wasn’t sure how many groups there would be or how many members each would include.
He said he would also not set a deadline for when each individual school would lay out implementation plans.
Parts of the plan, like adding up to 100 faculty positions, could take up to a decade, but Lerman said in December that by outlining the plan, GW has a platform to pitch to donors.
“This is something that’s been accelerating now for a couple of years, and it will become more and more intense over time as we get the plan finalized and more and more of us talk about it with people who have immense affinity with GW,” Lerman said in December.
Lerman said first on the docket is laying out the new admissions model that would admit high school students directly into the University instead of its specific schools. That switch could be set within the next two years, and would require immediate planning on GW’s part to shift its messaging to high school students, he added.
Other pieces closer to fruition include new interdisciplinary research centers that could be rolled out by next academic year, Lerman said.
“We won’t try to do everything at once. You have to make choices in the plan [about] what comes first,” Lerman said.
And as GW’s fundraising machine builds momentum, Lerman said his office has also stockpiled about $6 million from the Innovation Task Force ­– a group University President Steven Knapp charged in 2009 with finding $60 million in recurring savings and new revenue by identifying ways to save money. About $5.2 million of those funds will go toward the strategic plan every year.
Chair of the Faculty Senate executive committee Michael Castleberry said faculty and program directors will soon begin to react to financial incentives to shape their research and teaching agendas.
“Faculty will go anywhere where there’s money,” Castleberry, a special education professor said. “Even if I wanted research on flowers in Montana, if they’re going to offer me money to look at Chinese special education students, I’ll look at Chinese special education students.”
As professors vie for research dollars coming out of the plan, the fundraising rush will require more time from deans and other top administrators, Morsberger said. Knapp molded deans into fundraising chiefs three years ago, mandating that they spend at least 40 percent of their time raising money.
“There will be an enhanced effort to ramp up that time,” Morsberger said. “Dr. Knapp does a lot of this. A lot. It’s one of his top priorities. The provost does a lot, as do the deans. I expect it to all pick up even more.”
The University will officially launch a sweeping, comprehensive fundraising campaign within the next two years. The strategic plan will account for about one-third to half of that campaign’s goal. Now, Morsberger’s office is in the midst of the quiet phase of the fundraising campaign by talking to top donors in small groups.
The University is looking to advance from raising about $120 million per year to $200 million per year by the end of the decade. GW has seen increases in giving for the last five years, but has historically faced low alumni giving rates and only began building up its development office when it tripled its staff between 2005 and 2009.
Strategic plan fundraising will also come as GW is trying to raise millions of dollars for scholarships and hefty construction projects like the $275 million Science and Engineering Hall and $75 million School of Public Health and Health Services building. GW will also use $1.35 million saved annually from lowering the interest rate on two series of bonds over the last few years.
The University’s last strategic plan in 2002 also convened task forces and targeted money toward specific areas like transportation safety and Asian studies.
