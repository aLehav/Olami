Higher education fundraising experts said GW's decision to refuse to release the data is "unusual" for a college.
Officials are declining to release how much money parents donated to GW last fiscal year, breaking with longstanding precedent to disclose the statistic publicly.
Parent donations hit the highest level in seven years in 2019, reaching $15.7 million in contributions. But officials from the Division of Development and Alumni Relations declined to provide the number of parent donations during fiscal year 2020, which ran from July 1, 2019, through June 30, 2020, stopping an at least 10-year trend of releasing the data.
DAR also declined to say how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the number of parent donations or how much officials hope to raise from parents this fiscal year.
Higher education fundraising experts said releasing parent fundraising numbers in annual reports distributed to all donors is common practice and declining to provide that data is “unusual.”
Timothy Winkler – the principal and CEO of the Winkler Group, a private fundraising firm – said the COVID-19 pandemic upended regular fundraising tactics, requiring colleges to adapt to a virtual setting. Many universities have started hosting engagement events virtually, like homecoming reunions and dinners with the president, he said.
GW officials said the development and alumni relations office has been connecting with supporters by promoting virtual networking and online webinars through a weekly email blast. The fundraising staff also encouraged alumni to donate to the GW Cares Student Assistance Fund to contribute to relief efforts for students and to mentor graduating students through the Career Connect program.
“People, because all of us were facing the same situation, adapted really quickly,” Winkler said. “The universities that were on the front end of it and just willing to be innovative and think outside the box, they’ve actually seen significant gains this year in their fundraising.”
He said higher yields can be attributed to the efficiency of technology platforms like Zoom and Skype that allow fundraising officials to continue meeting with donors. At GW, officials adapted Colonials Weekend to include a number of remote receptions for students, parents and alumni.
Winkler added that many people have decided to donate to help universities weather financial challenges brought on by the pandemic. GW is facing a roughly $180 million budget gap this year.
“Everything going on right now seems counterintuitive,” Winkler said. “You would think that everything in the world with the pandemic would really inhibit fundraising for all. What we’ve seen is the opposite – a lot of people have really stepped up during this pandemic.”
Casey Heilig, the director of family engagement and philanthropy at Villanova University, said about 600 more families donated during the college’s day of giving this year compared to last year. She said universities need to increase communication to their supporters about pandemic-related changes and decision-making among top officials.
“When those who are invested in and care about your organization have a better understanding of what’s happening on the ground, in addition to the new needs that have arisen from the effects of the pandemic, it’ll help the development team to raise philanthropic support,” Heilig said.
Linda Durant, the vice president of development at the Council for Advancement and Support of Education, said one of the drawbacks of the virtual sphere is a lack of athletics, which can serve as a key source of engagement and donations for universities. Instead, institutions have been forced to divert their attention to the development of academic programs, career development, student affairs and technology, which typically do not yield as many donations, she said.
The athletic department at GW launched a fundraising campaign, called Together We Raise Higher, to help mitigate the financial hardship brought on by COVID-19. The campaign raised $137,000, surpassing its $100,000 goal.
Durant said parents will sometimes step forward as donors, especially if their student attended a private high school and they are accustomed to financial involvement.
“Their generosity is just incredible,” Durant said. “If they know they’re able to support their son or daughter and they have all of the technology they need, then they’re willing to help out with another student who may not be that fortunate.”
Anna Norville, the senior director of parent and family giving at The College of William and Mary, said creating “meaningful funds” – donations that have a direct impact on improving students’ situations – is a useful strategy for universities to increase donations during the pandemic. She said donors at William and Mary created the HEART Fund last November to support students facing emergency situations.
University administrators have contributed millions toward emergency student aid during the pandemic. Officials announced last week that GW received more than $22.5 million from alumni toward financial aid next year.
“Any time a donor is facing a situation where their dollars are limited and they really want to make an impact and you can show them what they are actually accomplishing with their donation, that is essential,” Norville said.

More than half of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission covering GW's Foggy Bottom Campus will be newly elected following the November elections.
Locals will see a slew of fresh faces on the Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission as just three commissioners run for reelection and more than half of the body’s eight seats remain up for grabs.
Vacancies on the commission have cropped up in recent months – two commissioners have resigned since July and three said they will not run for reelection. This leaves three commissioners hoping to return – one runs uncontested, another faces a new neighborhood challenger and the third launched a write-in campaign after the ballot’s deadline passed.
Commissioner Trupti Patel, who is running for reelection against longtime Foggy Bottom resident John George, said constituents and fellow ANC members asked her to run a second time because they were happy with her service on the commission. She said she hopes to return to the ANC to maintain “stability” on the commission and in her district as a majority of commissioners step down.

“So many of the commissioners for personal, professional and private reasons have decided to not continue on, I thought it was even more important that I run for another term,” Patel said. “I felt that the constituents of 2A03 deserved a little bit of stability in a time where there’s a lot of instability.”
Three out of the eight seats on the ANC still don’t have a candidate, meaning only five seats are expected to be filled during the election, according to the ANC candidate list. At least five of the eight commissioners must be present to hold a quorum, the minimum number of members needed to hold a vote on resolutions, the commission’s bylaws state.
If those seats remain vacant next term, the ANC will still move forward with each vacant district lacking a representative on the commission, Patel said. She said when there’s a vacancy on the ANC, commissioners must jointly decide how to handle certain issues but may not be as effective as the sole commissioner of a district.
“If you don’t have a dedicated ANC commissioner, that discussion will not take place or it may not be highlighted and elevated as quickly as it could have been had they had a dedicated representative,” Patel said.
Patel said she thinks the length of ANC meetings, which can often run for more than three hours, can deter potential candidates from wanting to serve. She said the long meeting can “become exhausting,” and if officials were to cut hours, more candidates may be compelled to launch campaigns.

As commissioners hope to find a new class of candidates to fill this fall’s vacancies, Patel said the ANC could turn in a “new direction” in the following term. She said a majority of new commissioners will bring with them “fresh new ideas” for the ANC.
“This is an opportunity for the ANC to grow and expand in different ways, in different directions that it hadn’t had the opportunity that it’s had in quite a few years,” Patel said. “It shouldn’t make people leery. It should excite people, actually.”
One of the seats set for vacancy next term is 2A08, which represents most residence halls on campus. ANC Chair and senior James Harnett has held that seat for the past two years, but he plans to step down before graduating at the end of the fall semester because his district only includes housing for on-campus students and he couldn’t continue living in the district.
Harnett said student representatives need to step down after graduating and leaving the area, limiting the amount of time they can serve. He said he has communicated with some students planning to launch write-in campaigns to represent on-campus students, but no one has publicly launched a bid for the seat.
“I think it’s a lost opportunity in that we don’t really have the opportunity to allow a young person, a student, to really develop in this role because you can only accomplish so much in a limited time,” he said.
Harnett launched a campaign to represent Ward 2 on the State Board of Education this summer.
Senior Yannik Omictin started a write-in campaign for the ANC in September because he saw the commission’s pending vacancies as an opportunity to serve the neighborhood.
“I know that with the support of folks across the neighborhood, they’re going to be able to be successful, and the ANC is going to be able to continue to push forward on the priorities that are important to us and to voters,” Harnett said.
Commissioner Evelyn Hudson, whose district includes Shenkman Hall, said she is running for reelection as a write-in candidate after missing the D.C. Board of Elections’ deadline because of new COVID-19 guidelines that require scheduled times to turn in paperwork to the city. Hudson said communication and teamwork will be essential for the next group of commissioners to successfully govern in the next term.
“I’m basically a person who likes to see unity, and that’s what we had on our team this year – we had a lot of unity,” she said. “I’m going to miss everyone who did resign or go on to another position because of the fact that this is the second team I’ve worked on in my entire career in education or any other job that I’ve worked on where the people actually work together.”

Sophomore Alisa Kingsbury is taking a gap semester to work full-time on the campaign of a Democratic challenger for city council in her hometown.
In eighth grade, senior Tyler Kusma served as the data director for his hometown’s Obama campaign team – and he hasn’t left the campaign trail since.
Kusma is currently the president of the University’s chapter of GW for Biden, where he spends his time in between classes to organize text or phone banking sessions and other campaign events. He said he’s wanted to stay involved in politics because the choices students make at the polls will affect him throughout the rest of his life.
“The issues and the candidates who we’re voting for will have some of the greatest impact on us as a generation, because we’ll be living with these effects, whether it’s the local, state or federal for the next several decades,” Kusma said.
Kusma is one of six students who said they have turned to their political student organizations or local campaigns to get active in the presidential race. Students said they wanted to get active in the upcoming election to find their footing in politics and help sway what they called one of the most important elections of college-aged students’ “lifetime.”
Catherine Morris, a junior interning on the Florida Democratic coordinated campaign, said all of her volunteer work for the campaign is virtual, so she finds herself “always” on the computer. She racks up roughly 15 hours online per day between completing school assignments, phone banking and recruiting volunteers.
Morris said she got involved with the campaign because she saw a “need” for change in elected officials in light of the pandemic. She said she became more interested in politics and shifted her political ideology from a Republican to independent after the 2016 presidential election and eventually Democrat as she transitioned into college.
“Around the presidential election last time, I was just starting to get interested in politics,” she said. “I grew up in South Carolina and I was like, ‘Oh, I’m a Republican,’ and then I realized, ‘Oh no, I’m not.’”
Noah Rothstein, a junior working on a campaign for Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., said he spends his time talking with constituents on the phone about things like Zeldin’s platform and community issues he wants to address. He said he joined the representative’s team because he felt this election was one of the most important of his life and he wants to build a foundation in politics.
“It was a really good way to get an experience in politics,” Rothstein said. “If I do eventually seek some sort of elected office, this was a good way to see the groundwork, see how it all happens behind the scenes, running a campaign.”
When administrators first decided to send students home in March, then-sophomore Alisa Kingsbury, a former Hatchet reporter, joined a campaign in her hometown of Simi Valley, California, to help Democratic challenger Phil Loos elected to the city council. After GW eventually announced classes would be online in the fall, Kingsbury said she opted to take a gap semester and work full time with the campaign.
“I was on track to graduate a semester early anyway,” she said. “When they announced that we were going to be online in the fall, it just kind of made sense.”
Kingsbury said she executes literature drops, which includes distributing pamphlets describing Loo’s campaign around town. She said volunteers staple a piece of paper with his main platform points to an empty bag with a list of organizations people can donate to help those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Junior Patrick Burland, who works as the campaign manager for Mike Southworth in Connecticut’s 14th Senate district, said he spends anywhere from 20 to 40 hours per week working full time for the campaign on top of his regular class load.
“It can be very hectic at times because you’ll be in the middle of a Zoom class, and then you get a call because something happened [with the campaign] and you have to manage that while also being in class at the same time,” he said.
Burland, who also serves as the director of public relations for GW College Republicans, said he manages the campaign’s public relations by posting content on the campaign Instagram and Facebook pages and emailing press releases to campaign subscribers. He said he also drops off cards around his district with the candidate’s name, race and other biographical information.
Sophomore Lauren Guzowski said she works as the deputy director of campaigns for GW College Democrats organizing five phone banking events per week for campaigns chosen weekly.
She added that members work for a Democratic House campaign on Wednesdays and for a Democratic Senate campaign on Thursdays phone banking. Guzowski said a committee within the organization chooses which race they’ll work for each week.
“We have members of our committee look at polling and we try to go for the competitive races where it could be really close, there’s a razor thin margin,” she said. “And we’ve also been trying to look into progressive candidates, because that’s something that I know a lot of people in College Dems want to see.”

If approved, the Asian American studies minor will be housed in the English department and explore the history and identity of that demographic.
Officials said they are undergoing a “vetting process” for an Asian American studies minor in light of ongoing calls to implement the program.
Faculty submitted a proposal for the minor to Columbian College of Arts and Sciences officials earlier this fall, and students launched a petition last month calling for administrators to implement the minor, which has garnered more than 2,500 signatures as of last Monday. Rachel Riedner, the associate dean of undergraduate studies for CCAS, said the program is undergoing the same review process as all majors and minors, and officials are reviewing it in terms of “curricular offerings and resource allocation.”
Riedner said officials did not consider “tabling” the minor, despite claims from social media posts.
She said it usually takes one year from a minor’s submission to officials for it to be implemented into the curriculum. She said racism against Asians in light of the COVID-19 pandemic is an “important consideration” as officials consider implementing the minor.

Student leaders said they launched the petition to demonstrate student support for the minor to CCAS officials, but students have pressed officials for the program for a few years.
In 2017, then-Asian American Student Association President Jeremy Lee approached Patty Chu, a professor of English, about creating a minor in Asian American studies. Over the past three years, students and faculty have been working to develop the minor, Chu said.
Chu said if it is implemented, the minor will be housed in the English department and explore Asian American identity and history. Students who declare the minor will be able to take classes from different departments, like Asian American Experience through Movement and Sociology of Immigration, she said.
She said GW is “falling behind” its peer schools, four of which offer an Asian American studies major or minor.
Chu said it’s still possible for GW to implement the minor despite the hiring freeze officials implemented in March to mitigate the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, since it would require little additional hires or spending. She said officials should implement the minor in light of recent protests against racial injustice and increased xenophobia against Asians due to the pandemic.
She said students need the tools to understand the “place” of Asians in the United States, which she said students can learn through the minor.
“GW should counter such a situation by educating the next generation of leaders and citizens,” Chu said. “Public awareness of other Asian American issues pertaining to the pandemic is uneven.”
Dana Tai Soon Burgess, a professor of dance who helped develop the minor’s proposal, said the minor would teach the historical components of the Asian American diaspora in addition to the modern experiences of the diaspora.
Burgess said if the minor is implement, he will teach a course called Asian American Experience through Movement, which covers Asian American history through movement and performance.
“Many of the issues that Asians and Asian Americans deal with have to do with the body itself, like how it’s been exoticized or feminized or emasculated,” Burgess said. ”That’s really exciting to also have that with the minor.”
Fredrick Flores, a senior studying neuroscience and the vice president of the Philippine Cultural Society, said he is part of an informal group of members of various Asian American student organizations that have been pushing to implement the minor.
“Asian American identity and experience is a very unique thing,” Flores said. “I think a lot of students would benefit from learning that, not just Asian American students, but all kinds of students of all kinds of backgrounds.”
He said the petition, which he helped launch, gained a “whole wide range of support” from students, family members, alumni and professionals in the field of Asian American studies within a day of its release.
“If we can show that there’s a community of individuals supporting this thing, not just at GW, but throughout that, I feel like that’s a very glaring thing that the administration cannot ignore,” Flores said.
Student Association Sen. Gabriel Young, CCAS-U and the chair of the SA’s Asian Pacific Islander Desi Caucus, said officials told students who were pushing to implement the minor that CCAS officials were considering tabling its deliberation “indefinitely.”
The SA Senate passed a resolution last week backing the minor.
He said the GW community can help break down stereotypes and discrimination against Asians through the minor while also “clarifying and finding the truth” about Asian American identity.
“It is more of a reclamation of identity and truth to the Asian American identity and promoting the voices of those voices that have been oppressed throughout history,” Young said.

Wahlbeck said the pandemic threw a wrench into his plans as dean, like pausing the process of hiring the school’s first director of diversity, equity and inclusion.
Updated: Nov. 10, 2020 at 10:41 a.m.
When Paul Wahlbeck was serving as the chair of the political science department in the early 2010s, he would take faculty candidates for the department past a hole in the ground that would become the Science and Engineering Hall every morning.
He called the hole the “most important development on campus” for the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences, adding that bolstering the school’s sciences would move GW “comprehensively in a stronger direction.”
Since the hall’s creation in 2015, Wahlbeck has become the school’s permanent dean and said he hopes to ramp up efforts to strengthen GW’s STEM offerings and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in his role for the school. He said though the COVID-19 pandemic has shifted his initial goals as dean, he is still working to strengthen CCAS’ educational and course offerings.
“In this moment in our nation’s history with the unrest that exists around race and racial politics, this is a priority for the college, and we will make progress on it despite the pandemic.”
Time as interim dean 
Officials announced in July that Wahlbeck would take over as permanent head of CCAS after he held the position in interim for two years. As interim dean, he oversaw the development of the data science major, short-term study abroad opportunities and “collaborative team teaching” between STEM and other faculty.
Wahlbeck said Ben Vinson, the former CCAS leader who stepped down in 2018, established “visionary leadership” in the school, and Wahlbeck wanted to focus his time as interim dean on maintaining the progress that Vinson had set for the college.
“But I think that more specifically, that’s a caretaker role, and that’s not necessarily the kind of thing that really is what one would aspire to as an interim dean,” Wahlbeck said.
He said his goals as interim dean were in line with University President Thomas LeBlanc’s goals to improve the undergraduate experience, enhance GW’s research and scholarship, engage with alumni and strengthen philanthropic outreach and improve GW’s institutional culture.
Wahlbeck said he was also interested in building on Vinson’s vision of the “engaged liberal arts,” by pushing students to apply knowledge gained in the classroom to real-world experiences through short-term study abroad programs.
“I think that those are fascinating opportunities to take our knowledge and to push it further than what we’ve been able to do in the classroom and simultaneously push our students out of their cultural comfort zones at the same time,” Wahlbeck said.
He said he also wanted to increase rankings for various doctoral programs in CCAS and created “bulletins” — where officials could publicize the accomplishments and successes of students and faculty to faculty at other universities, which would develop a “stronger reputation and stronger rankings” for the school’s programs over time.
Wahlbeck said as chair of the political science department and later the vice dean for programs and research of CCAS, he had the opportunity to work with several faculty members and listened to the perspectives and insights of faculty, staff and students in CCAS.
“I could see their commitment to their students and to their programs, and it was clear that it was a real privilege to be surrounded by so many caring and committed faculty members, staff members and students all pushing in the same direction,” Wahlbeck said.
The COVID-19 pandemic
Wahlbeck said the pandemic has caused him to “shift course” for his plans as the permanent dean and change the focus of his broader goals like those relating to diversity and inclusion. He said officials paused the process of hiring the school’s first director of diversity, equity and inclusion after officials implemented a hiring freeze in March.
Wahlbeck said officials are still pursuing the advancement of diversity, equity and inclusion in CCAS through workshops and roundtable discussions about racism and inequality and partnerships with the Office for Diversity, Equity and Community Engagement to teach faculty about how to create more inclusive classrooms and course curriculums.
“In this moment in our nation’s history with the unrest that exists around race and racial politics, this is a priority for the college, and we will make progress on it despite the pandemic,” he said.
Wahlbeck said when he moved into his role as interim dean, he was surprised by how much he enjoyed interacting with alumni and discussing their experiences at GW and their life after college. He said despite the pandemic, officials continue to hold virtual speaker events where alumni discuss their careers, like a September event in which two alumni who work as reporters discussed their insights on the 2020 election.
He said although the pandemic has caused alumni events to be held virtually, event attendance has increased and officials have been able to engage with more alumni than in the past.
“From my vantage point, that’s a real win,” he said.
Wahlbeck said the economic impact of the pandemic has affected some alumni negatively who haven’t been able to donate as much as they used to but added that officials have encouraged alumni to volunteer their time through virtual mentoring events for students.
“There are so many ways that we can engage with alumni,” he said. “Fundraising is one piece of it, but we can actually double down on other forms of engagement during a time of economic downturn where some people aren’t able to contribute financially to the University.”
Plans for the future
Wahlbeck said his role as dean is to “think strategically” about the future of CCAS, and the pandemic has highlighted questions for him about the future of higher education, the role of virtual learning among graduate programs and future course and program offerings for GW.
He said although GW’s strategic planning process is on hold, he wants to improve the school’s STEM offerings.
Officials paused the strategic planning process in April amid rising concerns surrounding the pandemic’s financial impact on the University. It included plans to reduce undergraduate enrollment by 20 percent and increase the proportion of STEM students to 30 percent.
“This is a time for thinking about how to build the sciences in Columbian College so they’re really positioned to contribute to our preeminence as a comprehensive global research university,” he said.
Wahlbeck said as dean, he values hearing about student perspectives on issues like the Pass/No Pass policy and the push for Election Day to be declared a University holiday.
“I think the thing that going forward that’s going to be very valuable for us to hear, especially now that we’ve had a full semester of being in a virtual learning experience, is what challenges are students facing, and what can we do to help students navigate those challenges?” Wahlbeck said.
This story has been updated to correct the following:
An earlier version of this story stated Wahlbeck oversaw the development of the data science major as interim dean in 2015. He was not interim dean in 2015 but oversaw its growth in subsequent years. It is now corrected.

Former College Republicans Chair John Olds helps lead a new organization called Gen Z GOP, which has distanced itself from President Donald Trump's Republican base.
Republican students voting this November say they’re divided on support for President Donald Trump, with some defectors opting for a different choice on Election Day.
As Trump seeks reelection as the GOP nominee, a coalition of national organizations have assembled a wide base of Republicans who oppose Trump as part of the “Never Trump” movement born in 2016. Students said a similar split exists at GW, and some are deciding whether to endorse or oppose Trump based on issues like populism, foreign policy and immigration.
Junior Patrick Burland, the director of public relations for GW College Republicans, said despite the organization’s endorsement of Trump and all Republican candidates “up and down the ballot,” multiple members intend to vote for Biden in the election.
“As an organization, we’re also a big tent party on campus,” Burland said. “We have members who are voting for Joe Biden, President Trump, other candidates, and we welcome people of all views and backgrounds no matter their stance on the presidential contest.”
College Republicans held a mock platform committee similar to the Republican National Convention in September, during which Burland said members voted on policies they want the party to support. He said members voted on some issues that weren’t mentioned in the 2016 or 2020 Republican platforms, like taking action against climate change.
Burland said he believes difference in opinion among members is “healthy for a political party,” especially on matters of ideology. Despite members’ personal views, he said the organization serves as “an arm of the GOP” that will continue to support the Republican Party.
But not all Republican organizations want fully to align with their party.
Senior John Olds, a former chair of College Republicans, said he currently serves as the political chair of Gen Z GOP – a national organization that has distanced itself from the election to create a new vision for the Republican Party. He said he views the future of the GOP as “up for grabs” no matter the outcome of the election, as the party’s top national issues and voter base eventually fall in the hands of younger Republicans.
Olds said Gen Z GOP isn’t as focused on what happens with the election but more on what comes next, pointing to the group’s hopes to diversify the party in terms of race, religion and sexual orientation. He said even if Trump is reelected, he wants Republicans to focus on reconsidering its values and diversity to create “an alternative for the left.”
“We are becoming the party of old White people, and we can’t be that,” Olds said. “We need to look inward to see why we are not appealing to people of color, people who care about the environment, people who might not have gotten a fair shake economically.”
Olds said he’s aware of Republican division on campus but said policy rather than personal morals seem to cause the split between voters. He added there’s a lot of reluctant as well as enthusiastic Trump voters, the latter of whom he said comprise a smaller group.
“No one really likes Trump as a man, but a lot of people support him because of his policies and agenda,” he said.
Despite “different perspectives on different issues,” Olds said he thinks the shared identity of being a Republican still binds conservative students together as a community.
Zev Siegfeld, a self-identified Libertarian who is a member of College Republicans and Young Americans for Liberty, said he plans to vote for Trump and identified the split among Republicans as similar to one within the Democratic Party. He said he thinks debate among party members serves the country well when citizens can “engage and battle” on their views.
“Democrats have the same issue, say with the Bernie wing of the party and the Biden wing of the party,” Siegfried said. “With any group of people this large you’re bound to have divides based on a given candidate or ideological preferences.”
Siegfried said his best friends, whom he met through College Republicans, are “pretty evenly split between the pro- and anti-Trump camps” through open political conversations they’ve had.
Mark Schalger, who identifies as a “more moderate” Republican who’s part of College Republicans and plans to vote for Biden, said he feels this division personally, as he’s struggled with his political identity during the Trump presidency.
“You see the way they treated John McCain and how they treat Mitt Romney, so I feel like if I disagree at all, I get called a RINO or ‘you’re a fake conservative,’ so I guess I’m just struggling to view myself as a Republican when people are so quick to defend Trump no matter what he does,” Schlager said.
Schlager said the election has more to do with gaining “our sense of decency back,” emphasizing bipartisanship for the good of the country after the election.
“I hope we realize that it’s country over party always, and if Trump loses, we get the old party of the McCains and the Abraham Lincolns back, where politics is all about respect, and it’s all about compromise, and it’s all about working across the aisle to get stuff done because you’re representing the people,” Schlager said.
