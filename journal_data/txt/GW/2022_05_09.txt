The leaders of the fossil fuel industry and their funders have repeatedly and deliberately misled the public about the science and solutions to climate change in an effort to block climate policy. But they don’t stop there – they have long tried to influence research related to climate policy and undermine academic freedom to their own advantage through funding for research centers, including at GW. That’s one reason I stand with the members of Sunrise GW and encourage every faculty member to take the organization’s No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge. Taking this pledge lets students know we are taking our responsibility to protect the University and its students from disingenuous and dangerous efforts to undermine a healthy exchange of ideas seriously.
As a member of the faculty of the School of Media and Public Affairs and one of this year’s Terker Distinguished Fellows – a program that brings professionals from the fields of media, political communication and public affairs to SMPA each academic year – I believe it’s absolutely essential to protect the integrity of information. As leaders in the field of public information, we must safeguard against the misinformation running rampant in today’s world, especially when it seeps into the work done by those of us at GW.
The Sunrise Movement is a youth campaign whose mission is to make climate change an urgent priority in the United States, end the corrupting influence of fossil fuel executives on our politics and elect leaders who stand up for people’s health and well-being. In 2020, Sunrise GW and other student groups successfully pressured GW to divest its endowment from the fossil fuel industry after a week of student protests in February that year and after Georgetown and American Universities announced their own plans to divest from the industry.
To end the industry’s influence at GW once and for all, Sunrise GW is now urging faculty and the University to take their No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge to refuse speaking engagements or fees from fossil fuel companies. Sunrise GW is calling on GW’s administration and the Board of Trustees to enact a ban on funding from the Slippery Six – the six companies and organizations that Congress subpoenaed for their role in the “Disinformation Campaign to Prevent Climate Action” – and from the top 10 funders of the related U.S. climate change counter-movement.
I fully support Sunrise GW’s goals and am signing this pledge because these young people are taking decisive, coordinated action to end an era of lies and ruinous climate denialism. We must respect their leadership and make sure the University aligns with the values of its students and on the side of truth. With its focus on intellectual honesty and responsibility, the School of Media and Public Affairs must take a particularly strong stance on disinformation. Making sure every faculty member and the University itself signs this pledge is critical to protecting information integrity, especially when there’s a connection to GW.
The hard truth is that the fossil fuel industry exerts significant influence at GW, clashing with the principles of independent research. A 2019 report by Public Citizen found that the Regulatory Studies Center has received more than a million dollars in funding from both ExxonMobil and the Charles Koch Foundation since its inception in 2007. Public Citizen’s report concluded that the RSC’s research heavily favors outcomes beneficial to the fossil fuel industry and provides “scholarly rationales against government regulation” that would reduce pollution or combat climate change. A 2021 report by Jake Lowe, a researcher with the Milken Institute School of Public Health’s Redstone Center for Global Wellness, found that “the RSC is an ally of chemical manufacturers, the fossil fuel industry and a vast network of wealthy ultra-conservative donors.”
Sunrise GW has great potential to achieve its objective with a precedent for bans on funding from industry groups at GW. In 2018, Milken placed an embargo on academic funding from the tobacco industry to protect its work from the influence of a professional field known for unethical interference in academic research. Many other academic institutions have enacted similar bans, including the Harvard School of Public Health, which adopted a tobacco funding ban in 2002. “The fossil fuel industry’s denial and delay tactics come straight out of Big Tobacco’s playbook,” the George Mason University Center for Climate Change has stated.
GW cannot afford to allow its affiliation with fossil fuel companies to diminish its stellar reputation. Even the appearance of funding from the fossil fuel industry impacting research and operations at GW creates a damaging conflict of interest, and there’s already proof that the impact is very real. Allowing fossil fuel companies to associate with an institution of GW’s standing thwarts climate action – it lends them credibility, gives them a social license to operate and contributes to greenwashing campaigns in which they deceptively market themselves as environmentally friendly.
Faculty must stand with the students of Sunrise GW who are determined to disengage GW from an industry that not only denies climate change but puts millions of dollars into efforts to manipulate research and mislead the public. We have a responsibility to protect and amplify the truth. Dozens of faculty have already taken the No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge, and I urge every faculty member to do so. By acting together and supporting the efforts of the students of Sunrise GW, we can take a stand against the architects of the climate crisis.

During a year of anxiety and uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, my professors have been empathetic, flexible and understanding of the pressures facing students. My professors’ dedication to our wellness, mental health and academic careers manifested through simple acts like extended deadlines, which helped mitigate stress and enhanced my college experience. While I didn’t expect them to be so understanding and caring with their busy workload, I’ve appreciated their kindness this school year more than they’ll ever know. More students should recognize the difficulties of teaching during the pandemic and thank their professors who have done so with effort and empathy.
The pandemic sent classes online from March 2020 and for the rest of the following academic year, damaging students’ academic experience and aggravating their anxiety. During a time of heightened anxiety, remote learning led to Zoom fatigue and less socialization. Much of the pandemic-related stress persisted even after GW’s full campus reopening. Balancing COVID-19 safety with new relationships on top of coursework, internships and jobs made students like me feel more anxious than past years. Many students still feel overwhelmed despite widespread vaccination and a return to in-person learning.
This academic year, professors had to adapt to balancing students’ health and safety with in-person classroom interaction. Professors and students navigated a University mask mandate that has remained in place for the entire school year except for the first week in April along with shifts in testing and visitor safety protocols and a move to virtual classes after winter break. Despite these changes in COVID-19 protocols, my professors were still excited to teach us and remained masked all year to protect themselves and us.
Knowing that professors understand the pressures of being a college student, especially amid a pandemic, can make students feel less alone. Even with COVID-19 restrictions and classes with hundreds of students, my professors have created an open dialogue and discussed aspects of student life like daily stresses, current events and University news to show that they can empathize with students’ struggles. At the start of each class this semester, my history professor asked students to share any good or bad experiences from the days when we didn’t see each other. She showed interest in our lives and welcomed all answers, no matter how big or small.
My professors also always offered office hours, encouraged us to reach out if we felt overwhelmed and asked us for our opinions on deadlines, assignment content, exams and more, which all eased my nerves. During weeks of midterms and final exams, my professors acknowledged how busy we were and one professor shared an article about managing stress outside of class. During the online period at the beginning of this semester, my professors taught with excitement, constantly asked and answered questions and worked to make classes as interesting as possible despite the difficulty to lecture to a screen for more than an hour.
Extended deadlines were another major way in which my professors eliminated stress from my COVID-19 college experience and showed that they care about workload. My professors sought to grade our best work instead of a paper completed during a stressful all-nighter. One professor reminded me of her two-day deadline extension policy for papers and finals after I asked her about my paper after class. I had three important meetings the day of the paper’s deadline and felt stressed all day about submitting my best work. Before I even told her that my week was extra busy, she could tell I was anxious and would benefit from an extension. She even told me to get some rest during the busy exam season – she truly cared about me as a student and a person.
Faculty’s dedication to students’ well-being has helped them navigate pandemic-era education with less stress than anticipated. An October 2021 report from a University-wide task force focused on GW’s learning environment found that a “culture of empathy” between faculty and students has been key to students’ academic success during the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, we as students ought to show empathetic professors that we appreciate their kindness. Whether through a simple “thank you” or time spent on a course evaluation, we can show professors that their behavior makes a difference, especially during this past school year in which students felt anxiety and uncertainty about public health.
It cannot be easy to foster an empathetic environment and make connections with students during a pandemic – we’ve all grown accustomed to less socialization and more stress. But my professors’ genuine empathy and flexibility during a difficult year can provide a model for other faculty members who may not have demonstrated such empathy and flexibility. Feedback and appreciation can encourage more faculty to become better educators for their students and themselves. Widespread adoption of this empathic approach is essential as the University community continues to deal with COVID-19 and the stress it causes.
While fluctuations in COVID-19 cases caused stress this academic year, I’ve also felt joy meeting new friends, professors and exploring D.C. GW’s community has seen changes in COVID-19 guidelines within a city constantly focused on concerning and polarizing political news and controversies all while attending classes. We sometimes forget our professors experience stress daily, too. I want to thank all of my professors for consistently facilitating my education and creating an empathetic environment.

The leaked draft opinion of the Supreme Court’s potential overturn of Roe v. Wade has triggered a mix of shock, anger and frustration among students whose access to safe and legal abortions is essential to their health. The University has yet to communicate its stance on the future of abortion access, leaving students to prepare for a future without Roe and the protections it affords them. As part of their commitment to students’ health and well-being, officials should demonstrate that they unequivocally stand with students who want, need or have already had an abortion.
The Supreme Court’s 1973 ruling in Roe established a constitutional right to obtain an abortion, but a majority of justices now seem willing to overturn Roe entirely in their decision in Dobbs v. Jackson, which stems from a 2018 Mississippi law that limits abortion past 15 weeks. Doing so would return the issue of abortion to individual states, and while some states have already codified protections for abortions, states like Kentucky, Louisiana, Oklahoma and South Dakota have enacted preemptive “trigger laws” that will automatically ban or severely restrict abortion if the court overturns Roe.
To be clear, Americans still have a right to have an abortion as the court finalizes its decision. If you or someone you know wants or needs an abortion, you can obtain one legally and safely, including in the District. But because D.C. is not a state, the future of legal abortion in the city depends on Congress’ willingness to respect its local laws. A Republican-led bill to ban local funding for abortion in D.C. failed to pass in 2017, but a Republican-held Congress eager to act in the wake of Roe’s overturn could successfully enact legislation that overrides the District’s abortion laws.
Students are in the midst of reacting to the leaked draft opinion, whether at nightly protests and vigils at the Supreme Court or at an abortion clinic on campus that has been the site of previous demonstrations. Beyond physical proximity, abortion access directly impacts students – more than half of people who receive abortions in the United States are in their twenties, within the typical age range of college students. Outright bans or severe limitations on abortion disproportionally affect young people, especially those who are queer, disabled, of color and others who already lack access to healthcare.

Invalidating Americans’ constitutional right to an abortion puts pregnant people – including students – in direct danger of serious bodily harm. Restricting abortion access increases the risk that people seeking abortions will face life-threatening complications from carrying their pregnancy to term if they are unable to terminate it.
Threats to overturn Roe and limit abortion access are no more politically charged than other incidents that interim University President Mark Wrighton and his predecessor have responded to in an official capacity, like the 2020 protests over police killings of unarmed Black people, the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and the invasion of Ukraine. Yet Wrighton and officials have so far remained silent about the court’s impending decision. A clear, empathetic and informative statement recognizing that reproductive healthcare is key to students’ health would tell students that they are not alone and that the institutional weight of the University is behind them.
In line with GW’s prior communication on such issues, the University should make it clear that the Office for Diversity, Equity and Community Engagement, Counseling and Psychological Services, the Office of Advocacy and Support and other institutional resources are prepared to provide students with the resources – whether psychological help or financial aid – that they need to navigate the shifting legal terrain surrounding abortion access. The University’s media relations department is providing media interviews with faculty well-versed about the issues surrounding abortion rights, and it should make this wealth of knowledge available for students looking for succinct explanations on the state of reproductive healthcare in the United States.
Officials should also publicly recognize that the future of Roe and abortion access is in danger. They don’t need to join a picket line, but they must demonstrate a degree of empathy with students concerned about their access to reproductive healthcare. GW must make one thing clear – its students currently have a right to safe and legal abortions, and that right is fundamental to their health.
Until the University takes action, protesting at the Supreme Court and donating time and money to local abortion clinics are means for students to advocate for their own and others’ right to an abortion. They can also volunteer to drive people to their appointments or house them if they need to travel out-of-state for their procedure. And as students discuss abortion among their peers or at protests, they should be cognizant of the fact that not only people who identify as women need or want abortions. The overturn of Roe would be especially impactful for members of the LGBTQ+ community because it could signal the court’s willingness to hear challenges to Americans’ other rights, including marriage equality.
The University’s silence is a disservice to students reckoning with a dangerously real threat to abortion access. A statement on behalf of the University can cut through complex legal analysis, shifting students’ attention from the decision of five justices to their own physical and emotional health. For the University to take a stance supporting its students with the force of its institutions and resources would be well in line with its proud tradition of activism.

The leaked draft sparked days of protest where thousands of demonstrators, including GW students and organizations, gathered in front of the court to voice their outrage against the decision.
Megan Dunnigan said she saw “anger” and feelings of “betrayal” percolate through the crowd outside the Supreme Court last week protesting Roe v. Wade’s likely reversal, but she was determined to find a way to harness those feelings into political action.
Dunnigan – a freshman and the co-director of communications for Swing Left GW, a left-leaning political advocacy group – joined hundreds Tuesday in protesting the court’s leaked draft opinion signaling the overturning of the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that protects federal abortion rights. The draft, written by Associate Justice Samuel Alito, states the former Roe v. Wade decision was “egregiously wrong” and called for the federal government to return control of abortion legalization to the state level.
More than a dozen students said they felt compelled to protest at the court this week, despite many balancing final exams. Trans and Non-binary Students GW, Persist GW, Sunrise GW and Swing Left GW have mobilized in response to the leaked ruling, attending protests, supporting the demonstrations through social media posts and organizing letter-writing and phone-banking campaigns.
“I was just shocked that this had actually happened,” Dunnigan said. “It’s one of those things that the signs were there that this might happen, and yet actually to have it happen was just still shocking.”
The leaked draft sparked days of protests where thousands of demonstrators, including students and organizations, gathered in front of the court to voice frustrations against the decision that could eliminate decades of federal abortion protections.
Dunnigan said Swing Left is attempting to harness the energy of recent outcry and redirect it into actions to elect federal officials in favor of abortion rights during the midterm elections through phone-banking and letter-writing events. In an Instagram post Wednesday, Swing Left GW condemned the draft opinion and said students should take action with the organization to elect candidates who will support protected abortion rights.
“We had a conversation about ‘How do we be respectful of the fact that this is really damaging?’” Dunnigan said. “This is a really harmful opinion if it becomes law, so we want to acknowledge the severity of the situation and also use it as a moment to remind people that this is why elections matter.”
Dunnigan said Swing Left will continue organizing pro-choice projects like phone banking, canvassing and letter writing to federal representatives throughout the summer. She said the end of the semester will risk stalling the momentum of the fight for abortion justice as students leave campus and have less access to attend protests, but Swing Left members hope their hybrid events and sense of community within the organization will motivate students to stay involved with abortion rights.
“I think that people are hungry for ways to impact or ways to create change around abortion rights and to get involved, and we have that benefit that even though people are leaving, people really do want to get involved and people want to make a change and take action,” Dunnigan said. “And our job is just to hand them a letter and a pencil and say ‘Here, write to a voter in Pennsylvania, and let’s make a difference in the midterms.’”
Persist GW and Transgender and Non-Binary Students of GW both posted to Instagram to encourage people to attend the “#ReproRightsRally” – a rally in support of abortion rights outside the Supreme Court building Thursday afternoon.
Emma Hearns, a freshman majoring in neuroscience, attended a protest outside of the Supreme Court Monday night hours after the decision was leaked and gave an impromptu speech in support of abortion access. She said she returned to the protests Tuesday and spoke about bodily autonomy and constitutionality in front of a crowd because it is critical for young people to be active on the front lines of protesting.
“I was able to just do something on a whim,” Hearns said. “I was really focusing on the first night just about how we really need to be here, we need to show them they cannot take away our rights.”
Hearns said she recently joined GW Reproductive Autonomy and Gender Equity, a student organization dedicated to reproductive advocacy that organized about 10 students to attend the protests. She said she would encourage people looking for ways to support abortion access to call their senators and representatives to advocate for abortion rights, demand the ruling not be overturned and donate to the D.C. Abortion Fund. 
“It’s important to educate yourself, and really, if you just take about an hour of research, you’ll be able to understand why people feel so passionately about this and how horrible overturning this decision could be,” Hearns said. “We can stay in front of the Supreme Court for a week straight but nothing is going to be done unless we’re taking it down to community and local points of view.”
Maddy Niziolek – a senior and the co-president of GW RAGE – said RAGE organized about a dozen students through social media to protest the decision at the court Tuesday morning and evening. 
“Especially when it comes to abortion, abortion should be available for anyone regardless of where they live in this country, and that is a constitutional right,” Niziolek said. “We’re really just showing the Supreme Court, and also congresspeople, that that’s where we stand and that a majority of the country supports the right to abortion.”
Niziolek said RAGE will educate students on campus about how they can fight for abortion rights and what a future following the reversal of Roe v. Wade might look like. She said the student organization is planning on utilizing their social media platforms over the summer to keep students engaged in fighting for reproductive rights by posting resources students can use to continue the protest from home. 
“It’s one of the major goals of RAGE as one of the reproductive justice orgs on campus is to make sure that we are supporting the right to abortion and abortion access,” Niziolek said.

This spring’s Commencement will follow the same COVID-19 safety protocols as the in-person ceremony last fall. 
Updated: May 10, 2022 at 6:35 p.m. 
For the first time in three years, GW will host its traditional spring Commencement on the National Mall Sunday.
University spokesperson Tim Pierce said the event will draw about 25,000 attendees who will hear remarks from Commencement speaker Elana Meyers Taylor, an alumna and five-time Olympic medalist, before capping off their GW careers. The event will kick off at 10 a.m., marking the first in-person spring Commencement since the COVID-19 pandemic moved commencement ceremonies online for two years until the classes of 2020 and 2021 returned to the National Mall for a joint Commencement in October.
“We are thrilled to bring together the Class of 2022 for Commencement on the National Mall for a truly Only at GW moment,” Pierce said in an email. “With approximately 25,000 people expected to attend, it will be a great day celebrating with the graduates and their family and friends.”
Additional commencement celebrations for the University’s schools, multicultural groups and ROTC cadets will start Thursday and continue until Monday. You can find the full schedule of celebrations on GW’s Commencement website, alongside information on registration, COVID-19 safety protocols and accessibility.
This spring’s Commencement will follow the same COVID-19 safety protocols as the in-person ceremony last fall. GW registrants must provide a copy of full vaccination proof for all their guests over the age of 5 who must have received their last dose more than two weeks in advance. All guests, regardless of vaccination status, will be required to wear a mask for all indoor events unless they are eating or drinking.
Graduating students receive individual recognition during celebrations specific to each college or school, where they will walk across a stage as school administrators announce their names. Graduating students and their guests will also hear from speakers like Dr. April Kapu, the president of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners, who will address the School of Nursing, and Rep. Gregory W. Meeks, D-N.Y., who will speak to the Elliott School of International Affairs.
Following a tradition that started more than a decade ago, the Multicultural Student Services Center will hold its signature Graduation Celebration in Lisner Auditorium at 10 a.m. Thursday. Everyone is invited to this celebration which honors graduating seniors who identify with the Black, Asian and Pacific Islander, South Asian, Latinx, Native American, religious and faith and LGBTQIA+ communities. This event features student guest speakers and award winners as well as a parent and family reception.
Alumna and Commencement speaker Elana Meyers Taylor received a bachelor’s degree in exercise science in 2006, a master’s degree in sports management in 2011 and an honorary doctorate in public service in 2018 after she was inducted into the GW Athletic Hall of Fame in 2014. During her bobsled career, Meyers Taylor made history as the most decorated Black athlete ever to compete in the Winter Olympics, earning a total of five medals. She also advocates for equality of opportunity for girls through her work on the Women’s Sports Foundation.
The University selected Vishva Bhatt, a first-generation American and international affairs major, as the Commencement student speaker. During her time at GW, she has served as the head delegate of the Model United Nations team and has directed College Next Door, a nonprofit organization that pairs GW mentors with D.C. high school students to serve as a support system.
“The big message that I want to leave students with and the community at large with is that we all want to make a difference in the world, and we all can and will make a difference in the world, but it’s okay if that difference is only in one little corner or if you only help one person or if you only do one positive thing, because that will cause a ripple effect,” Bhatt said.
Journalists and alumni Dana Bash and Chuck Todd will receive honorary degrees at Commencement. Bash, who received a bachelor’s degree from GW in 1993, serves as CNN’s chief political correspondent and co-anchors Sunday morning talk show “State of the Union.” Todd, who attended GW between 1990 and 1994, is the political director of NBC News and moderates NBC’s Sunday morning talk show “Meet the Press.”
Commencement check-in will take place on the first floor of the Science and Engineering Hall, where GW registrants can print out credentials for themselves and their registered guests to gain access to events. The check-in schedule is available on the Commencement week check-in website.
A reserved seating area will be available for attendees with limited mobility who may be dropped off and picked up on Jefferson Drive between 7th and 12th Streets. Golf carts, controlled by Commencement staff, can transport guests from the drop-off area to seating.
The celebration will be livestreamed for everyone to enjoy on the University’s Commencement website on the day of the event. The livestream will also be posted on the website as a video after the ceremony for students and their families to watch or rewatch on their own time.
This post was updated to correct the following:
The Hatchet incorrectly reported Commencement would be held Saturday. It will be held Sunday. We regret this error.

Campus went into a frenzy when Kanye West arrived for an unexpected show to promote his then-upcoming album “Jesus is King” in Lisner Auditorium. 
As the class of 2022 prepares to bid farewell to campus for the final time, reminisce on some of the #OnlyAtGW moments from their time in Foggy Bottom.
The past four years at GW have been anything but ordinary, with a pandemic, celebrity appearances, residence hall evacuations and Justin Diamond punctuating students’ academic careers. Take a stroll down memory lane and relive some of the most bizarre events that have taken place at GW since August 2018.
March 2019 – Justin Diamond’s write-in campaign
The 2019 Student Association election was shaping up to be relatively standard between three presidential candidates on the ballot. But nearly 24 hours until the election was set to take place, freshman Justin Diamond announced his write-in candidacy for SA president on GW’s Facebook meme page called “GW Memes for join without video teens.”
“I know the election is about 24 hours away, but I know the majority of students at GW are sick and tired of SA for its political antics,” his announcement states. “The time to act is now. Write me in on Wednesday, and I will see to it that the SA is abolished. GW will save time, money and dignity.”
Diamond, who ran on platform to abolish the SA, immediately received endorsements from the moderators of the meme page which has more than 15,000 members and was soon renamed “GW memes for pro-Justin Diamond teens.” Diamond’s unconventional campaign, which featured “fireside” chats from the Madison Hall basement and accordion performances, spread like wildfire across social media sites like Facebook and Instagram, gaining him key endorsements like the student workers at the H Street Starbucks.
Ultimately, Diamond’s campaign forced a runoff against then-junior and RHA President SJ Matthews after all candidates received less than 40 percent of the vote. Diamond received 27 percent and Matthews received 25 percent. Matthews clinched the SA presidency in the runoff with about 67 percent of the vote
Despite the loss, Diamond’s 2019 run was a lasting memory for all who witnessed it, because how often does a candidate run on a platform of abolishing the organization they want to be a part of?

October 2019 – Kanye’s surprise visit
Campus was sent into a frenzy when Kanye West arrived for an unexpected show to promote his then-upcoming album “Jesus is King” in Lisner Auditorium.
At the performance, West spoke about his newfound devotion to God and showed off samples of songs like “On God” and “Water,” which both ended up on “Jesus is King.” While GW is no stranger to celebrity sightings, Kanye’s surprise appearance will not be forgotten for students who were lucky enough to get a glimpse of Yeezus.

November 2019 – Thurston Hall fire
Thurston Hall, which is set to reopen in fall 2022 after roughly two years of renovations, has been known for water leaks, mold growth and the “Thurston plague” for decades, but a fire upped the ante for freshman year residence hall horrors in November 2019.
When a minor fire started in a third floor room, students evacuated from the 55 year old building because of the sprinkler system triggered in response, which showered the residence hall in water. Luckily, the fire caused minimal damage, the majority of which was due to the sprinklers. Students evacuated to the University Student Center but moved to nearby residence halls and hotels for several days while staff worked to repair the damage in their rooms.

March 2020 – COVID-19 pandemic
A few months later, students were met with by far the biggest moment of their academic careers. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic forced students out of their residence halls and into their homes as classes moved online and the world adjusted to a new normal.
Despite memes and levity on social media that joked about the severity and length of the pandemic, the pandemic ended up extensively defining students’ lives with online classes that lasted for more than a year. After 500 students were allowed back in the fall of 2020, that number grew to 1,500 in the spring while iconic events like Commencement and New Student Orientation remained online through the summer.
Despite the challenges the pandemic presented, students were resilient and made the most of their Zoom semesters in a variety of ways. From embarking on road trips to reminiscing about embarrassing mishaps that could only have happened online, students stayed resilient and made the most of their Zoom semesters.
17 months after classes first moved online, the University welcomed the GW community back to in-person classes as it completed its full campus reopening in late August as much of the student body stepped foot on campus for the first time.

September 2021 – Townhouse Row mold outbreak
But as campus life surged, so did mold growth.
Students evacuated from Townhouse Row after officials received reports of “environmental concerns” from separate townhouses leading up to Labor Day weekend, as students across campus began reporting their own mold findings to social media. Residents of Townhouse Row boarded shuttles and moved their belongings to the River Inn and Yours Truly hotel Sunday night during the evacuations, not returning for nearly a month.
Seventy-five GW community members said apparent mold growth and water leaks in their campus buildings have given way to illness, relocation and an overflow of FixIt tickets in the first half of September. Students reported cold-like symptoms, itchy eyes, coughs, congestion, allergic reactions and infections along with their mold findings.
It was an unforgettable time on campus filled with students re-packing up their belongings and heading off campus, as both students and professors rushed to investigate their own rooms for mold.

International affairs major Elena Picon said students should get involved on campus and take advantage of the opportunities and organizations available to them.
Reflecting on their last four years at GW, graduating seniors advise that freshmen get involved on campus and learn to adapt to unexpected changes to make the most out of their college experiences.
Moving away from support systems, deciding what to study, finding community and managing mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, five seniors said college offered a series of highs and lows that taught them to be flexible and adapt to unexpected changes in their lives. Seniors advised getting involved on- and off-campus through student organizations, strengthening relationships with professors and trying new experiences.
Journalism major Izzy Hardy said students shouldn’t take themselves too seriously, but rather focus on pursuing paths that most suit their interests.
“I’ve learned that nobody’s going to be there to advocate for yourself other than you,” Hardy said. “And so you have to sort of put yourself out there and join the clubs that you want.”
John Watson, an anthropology major, described their college journey as a “self directed and self guided” experience, in which they had to take a lot of initiative and regularly check in to ensure they were doing well in their studies. Watson said they learned to independently make decisions that would best serve them in their education and future.
“This is my future,” Watson said. “This is my education that I’m concerned about, so I feel like I learned to center my life around me. I got to make my own decisions and choices.”
Watson said advisors serve as a key resource for students when developing a class schedule with courses that best align with their academic and professional goals, and professors can share internship and research opportunities that might peak the interest of students.
“As a kid, my teachers were always scary authority figures, but the more you start seeing them as people like us, then it’s easier to talk to them and they’re obviously so helpful,” Watson said.
At a school based in a city with an independent student body and limited school spirit like GW, seniors have also learned the need to get involved on campus to meet new people and establish a supportive community.
“I would definitely do more clubs, definitely clubs,” Watson said “‘Cause like everyone says, I think it’s the best way to find new friends and meet new people.”
Emilia Gorecki, a speech and hearing sciences major, said students should take pride in their work and passions, even if they’re unlike those of their peers.
“If you’re interested in it, go for it and do it,” Gorecki said. “Because it is cool, it’s cool to you, and it’s important to you so you shouldn’t feel bad for feeling like something is cool or being interested in it.”
She said younger students should avoid letting imposter syndrome prevent them from pursuing opportunities before they try them out for themselves, whether making plans with friends or applying for an internship or job.
“Be the person who initiates,” she said. “If you want to do something with your friends, plan it and do it. If you want to apply to a job that you like, just apply for it.”
International affairs major Elena Picon said younger students should get involved on campus and take advantage of the opportunities and organizations available to them. She said when it comes to joining clubs the quality is more important than quantity, but exploring academic and social organizations can help students decide what field they would like to work in and offer a space for students to consistently foster new friendships.
“Get involved in as much as you can even if you’re not super motivated to get involved in it at first,” Picon said. “The more things I got involved in, the happier I was as an independent individual.”
Picon said professors and classes also play a crucial role in shaping students’ college experiences in addition to forging a campus culture. She said she took “revolutionary” thinking courses at GW which improved her writing skills and encouraged her to think critically.
“I think they helped me question a lot of things that I would usually just accept,” Picon said.
International affairs major Sally Kim said although the pandemic led to online learning after students left campus, the shift forced her to pause and think about the academic path she was on and how it would shape her career opportunities.
“COVID changed everything,” Kim said. “And that was the most monumental thing because it taught me so much within the college experience.”
Kim said many students, herself included, come into college aiming to accomplish several goals all at once but then face burnout a few months into the semester. Rather than stretching yourself thin, Kim said students should take their time and enjoy all college has to offer.
“As long as you feel fulfilled and you are happy, that’s the perfect college experience,” she said. “There’s no right or wrong thing to do.”
Kim said although college is a time to expand intellectual knowledge, it is also a time of growth and learning outside of the classroom. With many different organizations and clubs to join, people from different backgrounds to meet and the opportunity to live independently for the first time, college is also a time to gain important life experiences.
“Go to that cocktail happy hour or go to that school event,” she said. “I know it’s so easy to just sit at home and like to be in pajamas, because I do that all the time. But it’s the only time in your life where you can talk with people from so many different backgrounds.”

Senior Robin Fern said she gained a deeper appreciation for her Jewish faith while at GW through her involvement with student organizations like GW Hillel. 
Nicolas Rios has had debates with his Hispanic friends over how to say the word “straw” in Spanish.
Rios, a graduating senior who studied international affairs, said some of his friends he met in the Cisneros Leadership Institute spoke different dialects of Spanish coming into GW and they all have different words for “straw,” like El Salvadorians who say “pajilla” or Puerto Ricans who say “sorbeto.” He said he uses the word “popote,” which is the Mexican-Spanish translation for the drinking utensil, but the joke has become a running gag for some students in Cisneros – which is symbolic of the greater cultural distinctions students integrate into GW.
“It’s little funny nuances and words and sayings and expressions,” Rios said. “It’s always a fun topic of conversation.”
Rios, from Tucson, Arizona, is among other graduating seniors who said they brought their home culture, whether religious, regional or ethnic, to GW through food, clubs, language and work while in attendance. Students said they incorporated their home culture into their college life, found community, joined multi-cultural organizations and chose their future jobs.
Rios said he highlighted his Mexican and American Southwestern culture in the Cisneros Hispanic Leadership Institute building, a “home-base” during his time at GW where he would relax, study and hang out with some of his friends on campus.
Rios also is among other students of color who cannot find tasty, authentic food from their home city, state or country in the District. Instead, Rios said he opts to try new cuisines he is not accustomed to like Peruvian, Venezuela or Argentinian dishes.
“I can’t find what I’m used to, but at the same time, I can’t find a lot of this food back home either,” Rios said. “So this is also an opportunity to learn more about other foods as you build out different tastes.”
Rios also said in coming to the District, his lifestyle sped up with the city. He said at home in Arizona the environment is slower paced and more carefree than D.C., and people will say hello while walking down the street or stop to make small talk with strangers.
“It’s small human interaction on the daily basis that I found that I was missing,” he said.
He said unlike Arizona, “grind culture” propels people in D.C. to work themselves to the bone. He said while in the past he has fallen victim to this culture in the District, he has tried to embrace his hometown attitudes to focus on slowing down to put his well-being before work.
“The grind will never stop unless you make it stop or you choose to change it,” he said. “There’s always going to be something else to work towards and stay up all night writing or so on, and so I think it’s going to be like an internal values shift.”
Robin Fern, a senior who studied public health and dance, said she explored her Jewish faith and gained a deeper appreciation for it while at GW through her work and involvement with student organizations.
“Everybody has their own experiences with Judaism and I didn’t realize how unique mine was until I came here and it helped me find my people,” Fern said.
Fern said she teaches at a Jewish Sunday school in Montgomery County, Md., bat mitzvah tutors and babysits for a family she met through GW Hillel. She said at GW she learned to find pride from her early life Jewish experiences, like reading from the Torah at a Jewish summer camp she attended every summer growing up.
Fern, who hails from Seattle, said people in the Pacific Northwest are more empathetic than those in D.C., and that quality helped her understand the different backgrounds of people who attend GW, leading to more friendships throughout her four years. She said her Jewish culture and empathetic worldview connected her to a “tight-knit” place on campus over her four years at GW.
“It’s helped me discover who I am and it’s fun to reflect on who I thought I was and who I knew I was when I entered GW at age 18 and now reflecting back at age 22, to be like, ‘Wow, I am a different person with the same values,’” she said.
Jennifer Garcia, a graduating senior who studied political science and English, said she has been able to dive deeper into her Mexican heritage through food. She said during the COVID-19 pandemic she moved back to her home in a small town of Georgia, where her mom taught her to cook Mexican dishes like tostadas, picadillo, albondigas and flautas.
“I’ve definitely connected way more with my Mexican heritage through food, and so I hope that that’s something that I can keep up,” she said. “And hopefully after I graduate and I’m off of GWorld, I can go to a market that has actual spices that can replicate my mother’s cooking.”
Garcia said after she moved from her small town in Georgia to GW, she was exposed to a more diverse student body and a variety of new cultures. She said the Hispanic community at the Cisneros Institute welcomed her with open arms.
“It’s been such a strong ground, like strong foundation for me to not let go of my heritage and delve deeper into my Mexican heritage,” she said.
But Garcia said she hasn’t left all of her southern heritage behind.
“But I will say, I do enjoy some good cowboy boots,” she said.
