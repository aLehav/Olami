The advisory states that private institutions like universities and hospitals may ask visitors about their recent travel and require a record of a negative COVID-19 test.
Mayor Muriel Bowser issued an updated travel advisory Thursday requiring visitors to the District to get tested within 72 hours of traveling and to avoid travel if in contact with an individual who has tested positive for COVID-19.
The advisory, which was issued in Bowser’s situational update Thursday, also requires any visitors to the District to get tested for COVID-19 within three to five days of arrival if they are staying for longer than three days. The updated advisory, which will go into effect Monday, is set to replace the executive order Bowser issued in July requiring people traveling to the District from certain coronavirus hotspots to self-quarantine for 14 days after arriving.
The advisory states that private institutions like universities and hospitals may ask visitors about their recent travel and require a record of a negative COVID-19 test.
Individuals who are visiting from Maryland and Virginia and those who will be in the District for less than 24 hours are exempt to the advisory. Those who are coming to the District for essential work may do so before receiving the results of their second required test as long as they do not exhibit symptoms, and those traveling to the District for a family emergency or funeral don’t need to get tested prior to arriving if it would be “impractical” to do so, the advisory states.
“Traveling increases the risk of contracting COVID-19,” the advisory states. “If you must travel, limit your activities and get tested to understand your exposure.”
D.C. residents returning from Maryland, Virginia or other low-risk areas are required to either “self-monitor” for two weeks after returning and limit their daily activities or limit their daily activities until they receive a negative COVID-19 test result about 72 hours after returning.
“The requirement for residents to self-quarantine for 14 days or to obtain a negative test does not apply to those performing essential work, insofar as they are going to work, or for essential activities such as obtaining medical care, food or pharmaceuticals (only if the resident does not have symptoms of COVID-19 and has not been exposed to an individual diagnosed with COVID-19 in the past 14 days),” the advisory states.

Officials said they decided to halt the programs after weighing the COVID-19 health risks student leaders would have been exposed to while working closely in contact with other students.
The Resident Adviser and Student Access Monitor programs will remain suspended for the spring semester, officials said.
Despite the University’s announcement last month to allow 1,500 additional students to live on campus during the spring semester, the RA and SAM programs will be paused for the full academic year. Officials said they decided to halt the programs after weighing the COVID-19 health risks student leaders would have been exposed to while working closely in contact with other students.
Stewart Robinette, the assistant dean of students, campus living and residential engagement, said officials’ “main goal” has been “safeguarding” the health and safety of students who are or will be living in GW’s residence halls. He said administrators’ decision to pause the program for the spring was communicated directly to the RAs Oct. 21, after the University’s announcement regarding additional spring housing options.
He said Campus Living and Residential Education anticipates the demand for housing will be more than the available residential halls.
“This decision is based on how we are continuing to respond to COVID 19 spread in relation to aspects of the RA role, ensuring equity with students who apply for housing, and ways that roles can be provided in lieu of the RA position,” Robinette said in an email.
Vice President of Safety and Facilities Scott Burnotes said keeping the students employed as SAMs safe had been the department’s “first concern” when the University began preparing for the fall semester. He said officials made the decision to pause the program for the year to prevent any possibility of students being exposed to COVID-19 while monitoring residence halls.
He said security in residence halls will be conducted by “existing” staff members in the spring in lieu of employed SAMs.
“The very nature of that job, monitoring and interacting with community members visiting our buildings, four hours at a time, could increase the likelihood of exposure to COVID-19,” Burnotes said in an email. “Although we can mitigate such risks, it’s not possible to eliminate them.”

In college, few decisions feel as pivotal as committing to a major. Now a junior, I’ve unofficially changed my major three times, internally transferred once and second-guessed my minor twice. I know I’m not alone in the uncertainty of choosing a major, but sometimes I feel embarrassed that I can’t confidently say which academic route I’m picking. We need to start recognizing how totally normal and reasonable it is to change our minds, no matter how late or how many times we do so.
GW is competitive. We hunt for internships and jobs – regardless of if we really want the commitment – and put ourselves on a pedestal when we secure a coveted position. For someone who doesn’t really know what I want, that’s intimidating. While my colleague is perfecting the details of their postgraduate 10-year plan, I’m scheduling meetings with my adviser to declare and un-declare a major. While my friend is lining up an internship, I’m trying to figure out where I would even want to test out a workplace. I alternate between wanting to pursue a so-called impractical passion and feeling pressured to prioritize financial security. And that issue is exacerbated by the pandemic, which has left the job market destroyed and millions unemployed. That sounds stressful, but it’s perfectly normal.
Many of us undergo a small identity crisis about our futures at least once a week. It’s understandable, since these are all valid concerns, but we should recognize that changing our minds is not a disorganized sign of weakness, but a positive venture that only brings us closer and closer to where we’re meant to be. 
Each semester marks a new opportunity to redefine our aspirations. Career goals evolve, passions narrow and old interests become unappealing. Although coming to that revelation often feels stressful and usually incites another scroll through Degree Map, it actually feels relieving. Think of it as uncovering hidden parts of your academic and professional identity, which is exactly what our seemingly put-together peers are doing, too. 
But despite how understandable these identity crises are, no one at GW seems to admit to experiencing them. The second we step foot on campus, people are already flaunting their internships on Capitol Hill, perfecting their LinkedIn profiles and unveiling their 2036 presidential campaigns. No one talks about the hundreds of internships we get rejected from before being accepted to one or the lineup of academic advising meetings we attend before even considering a major. Instead, we let the imaginary expectation that we should have our entire lives planned out by now. The walking embodiments of this expectation deter us from admitting that we’re still undecided about our futures.  
The reality is that questioning ourselves is not as uncommon, irrational or as shameful as we may be inclined to think. Instead, it signifies how far we’ve come in our personal and intellectual journey. Nearly one-third of undergraduate students enrolled in bachelor’s degree programs change their major within their first three years, and one in 10 switch twice. Even beyond college, 49 percent of people make dramatic career changes, like from medicine to accounting. Change is OK. Not knowing what you want to do is OK – even if everyone at GW thinks otherwise. 
It makes perfect sense that the more we mature and grow in our academic and professional careers, the more prone we’ll be to altering our paths. Considering other possibilities is the only way to guarantee that we don’t dedicate four years of our lives to something that just doesn’t feel right.

In a world where people claim to champion diversity, we tend to forget a certain kind: diversity of thought. 
Long gone are the days where people learned to agree to disagree and understand that you can rarely change someone’s political stance at the dinner table. For generations, Americans understood how to have a level of mutual respect for one another, one that maintained families and friendships, despite differences in political affiliation. And for a long time, teenagers lived freely, caring more about each others’ music taste or favorite outing than whether or not you fit the ideal ‘”progressive teen” mold. 
Entering the most intensive part of the 2020 election cycle, students are likely finding themselves pitted against family members with opposing political beliefs. Those disagreements could be divisive, depending on how you handle it. As absurd as it may sound to some, students need to remember how exactly to behave in these sometimes challenging and heated discussions. Students need to sit back and ask themselves how much they can really accomplish in a discussion, and consider whether calling out an elderly grandparent for their unfavorable political beliefs is more destructive than productive. They need to prioritize friendships, kindness and common decency before choosing to judge and scapegoat people for who they voted for this week. 
I get it – it’s easy to forget about decorum when politics is always on your mind. We’re constantly fed information on the news and social media, pushing us to share or post our own hot takes. In some ways, modern-day politics have made the District a never-ending soap opera that GW students are in the depths of. We feel obliged not to befriend someone who holds opposing political beliefs, and we call people out when we don’t agree with them. But we don’t need to cut those off who we don’t like. We could try to hold a civil discourse and learn how to live with diversity of thought.
The United States has a lot of maturing to do. Just look at the past couple of presidential debates. But let’s try to uphold decency through the chaos. We need to understand that political beliefs aren’t made in a vacuum – they’re based on factors like lived experience and education. We need to think twice before attacking someone else for their political beliefs. I’m not saying you can’t point out your disagreement, but blasting someone else without holding a conversation is unproductive. 
In the spirit of embracing kindness and love as a life manifesto, each and every one of us should not let political divisions tear us apart. We already face the daily challenge of social isolation and emotional vulnerability, and we cannot let our rage over new tweets from the president or absurd statements by extremist politicians get the best of us. Instead, perhaps it may be best to channel the oddly correct position of former presidential candidate Marianne Williamson of “harnessing love for political purpose” this election.
As members of the GW community, we are responsible for fostering a community of compassion and acceptance, which extends to political affiliation. While GW is a deeply political school, we need to learn to take the politics out sometimes and just be kind to one another. It’s important now, and it will be especially important in the weeks to come.

As GW consigned its students to another semester of virtual learning, many voiced their discontent and desires to return to campus on social media and through petitions. But every post arguing for campus reopening caused a barrage of angry replies from students, outraged that someone would dare advocate for our lives resuming again. Those wanting to return to campus are routinely branded online as selfish or callous, caring more about partying or Spring Break than the lives of those around them.
We should all agree that safety concerns are paramount and mourn every COVID-19 death that strikes our community. But this kind of emotional blackmail is disingenuous and needs to stop. Contrary to what is portrayed, many who support campus reopening do so in good faith – precisely because they believe it could be done safely, with the benefits far outweighing any costs and with every student and employee able to make the decision that’s best for them. Students, before publicly shaming those who ask to come back, should first take the time to listen and understand where these people may be coming from.
It is easy to look at the numbers and get alarmed at the prospect of reopening. After all, COVID-19’s mortality rate for the 20 to 49 age bracket is 0.02 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This implies seven deaths would occur if all 26,000 students and, say, 10,000 employees under 50 both came to campus and got COVID-19. Yet that scenario happening is practically impossible, as any sensible reopening would not invite the most vulnerable students or employees back, and there are countless effective campus safety measures GW can take. Many other universities, including four of our peer schools, have already reopened successfully with no fatalities and, seemingly, few recorded hospitalizations.
In light of this, the University community at minimum deserves an earnest dialogue about our reopening options. Since 94 percent of people dying from the virus have certain underlying health conditions, perhaps we could ask those with such conditions to stay home and give everyone else a choice to do so. By enforcing strict testing, distancing and masking protocols, we could have a good chance at preventing mass campus outbreaks. Maybe professors at high risk could remain online but opt to have in-person discussion sessions with teaching assistants. Or, we could think of innovative ways to minimize student contact with front line workers and others in the Foggy Bottom area. Of course, not all reopening ideas will turn out to be feasible – and we should debate and reject those that aren’t – but demonizing students who suggest them with honest intentions only makes them needlessly intimidated and afraid to speak up for themselves.
Perhaps more importantly, we should remember before calling someone “selfish” or “uncaring” that people have had their entire livelihoods, everything that they enjoy and find meaning in, completely upended for half a year now. People have had their academic and career trajectories, which they have worked hard over the years to build, thrown into uncertainty; and are going into often crippling debt only to watch online video lectures. People are isolated with nobody to interact with and are struggling with depression, mental illness and all the health problems associated with staying alone indoors. By all means, we should talk to others about why we think reopening is unviable, but there is no excuse for invalidating someone’s struggles and smearing them for trying to fix things.
If nothing else, the debate over reopening has clearly shown how beholden we are to a classic false assumption: that those we disagree with are not only wrong, but are somehow acting in bad faith or at least don’t care at all about people like us. This is far from the truth. No one is advocating for anyone to be forcibly put in danger. Students are simply asking for the right, if the risk of coming back is worth it for them, to be allowed to make that individual choice – provided that they follow strict rules to protect others, bear responsibility for any costs to themselves, and most importantly, respect the decisions of those who choose not to return to campus with them. It is not our place to vilify such people, especially when the risks of reopening can potentially be managed and the human cost of staying online is so high.
I understand, especially for those who have lost someone close to COVID-19, that it may feel like we should take every drastic measure possible to prevent even one more death. Those are completely valid feelings to have. But consider, before you write in anger, that many asking to reopen do so out of legitimate concern for everyone’s wellbeing. And while you may think someone is wrong on the merits, remember before personally berating them that, chances are, they are in a fraught situation and see coming back to campus as the only viable course of action. You yourself may not take a 1 in 5000 chance of death to start living outside of your bedroom again, but for many others, it would be a lifeline.
No one is saying they don’t care about you or your loved ones, only that they also value their own well-being – we need to start respecting that.

Pinto originally joined the Council as the first woman to hold the Ward 2 seat and the youngest Council member ever elected at 28 years old after a special election in June.
Updated: Nov. 4, 2020 at 8:46 p.m.
Brooke Pinto declared she’s been reelected to the D.C. Council’s Ward 2 seat Wednesday.
Pinto – the short-term incumbent in Ward 2, which includes Foggy Bottom – maintained the lead she cemented Tuesday night as mail-in ballot results trickled in and secured nearly 69 percent of the vote with more than 270,000 ballots counted in D.C. as of Wednesday afternoon. With a victory, she will serve a full four-year term on the Council after completing the remainder of former Council member Jack Evans’ term following his resignation.
Pinto tweeted at 2:18 p.m., declaring victory “by quite a large margin” and thanking her supporters. The D.C. Board of Elections will continue to count ballots received up to Nov. 13.
She said she plans to “continue to seek out and work with diverse perspectives” that will benefit the District.
“Thank you so much to the voters of Ward 2 and my wonderful team and volunteers who supported me in this election and entrusted me with the responsibility to serve as your Council member for four more years,” she said in the statement.
Pinto originally joined the Council as the first woman to hold the Ward 2 seat and the youngest Council member ever elected at 28 years old after a special election in June. The special election followed the controversial resignation of Jack Evans, the ward’s Council member since 1991, who fell under several city, regional and federal investigations that found he violated the Council’s ethics code four times since 2014.
Pinto replaced Evans but started facing her own ethics concerns before she was elected when a local attorney alleged she violated campaign finance laws during the pandemic. Although the complaint was eventually dismissed, two independent challengers and a Green Party candidate entered the race with a common goal of unseating Pinto because of her ethics and voting record on the Council, which opposed raising the wealth tax and severing ties between the Metropolitan Police Department and D.C. Public Schools.
The independent candidates – Martín Miguel Fernandez, a biomedical anthropologist, and Randy Downs, a local Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner – joined the Ward 2 race in June and July, respectively, in hopes of challenging Pinto’s bid for a permanent term. Peter Bolton, the ward’s Green Party nominee, launched his campaign with vocal opposition to Pinto and the independent candidates, whom he labeled “switchers” for their prior Democratic affiliations.
Downs – who was projected to outraise Pinto, according to a DC Geekery analysis – received just more than 20 percent of the Ward 2 vote. He issued an email to his supporters Wednesday, thanking them for their help throughout the campaign and refusing to end his “fight” for more affordable housing, better public safety and an effective COVID-19 recovery.
“I will continue to work with you for COVID recovery that prioritizes the needs of residents, workers and small businesses,” Downs said in the email. “I will continue to fight alongside you for affordable housing so that long-standing residents can stay in our community and new neighbors aren’t shut out by high costs.”
Fernandez and Bolton reeled in about seven and three percent of the vote, respectively.
Pinto will continue to serve the remainder of Evans’ term until January and will enter her own four-year term at the start of next year.
In other local races, senior James Harnett has lost his bid for the Ward 2 seat on the D.C. State Board of Education while senior Yannik Omictin awaits results for his write-in campaign for the Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission.
Allister Chang, who works at a nonprofit incubator, sealed victory in the state board race when he captured nearly 50 percent of Ward 2 ballots. Harnett tallied votes on 2,217 of the counted ballots in Ward 2, receiving just short of 12 percent of the recorded vote as of Wednesday afternoon.
Harnett congratulated Chang on his victory via Twitter earlier Wednesday.
“I know we will continue to fight together to fully fund our public schools and pursue accountability for our students, teachers, and parents,” he tweeted.
Harnett has served on the Foggy Bottom and West End ANC since his sophomore year in 2018 and this summer became the youngest person to ever chair an ANC in the District’s history.
Harnett launched his campaign for the state board in July, pledging to improve equitable access to resources like technology, mental health services and local infrastructure for public schools across Ward 2 and D.C. at large.
Harnett said in an interview that he hasn’t considered the possibility of future campaigns for local office and will spend the near future helping newly elected Foggy Bottom and West End ANC commissioners “hit the ground running” at the start of the next term, as he looks to continue serving the local community.
“It was disappointing to lose, but I know all of us got into this race because we care about the issues and we care about serving our community,” he said. “And I know that that’s certainly not going anywhere for me. I’m going to continue to be involved, continue to advocate for what’s right, continue to be a champion for change.”

A student-led political analysis group outlet hosted a one-hour Facebook livestream Tuesday afternoon to discuss election projections with a political science professor and a student leader.
Seniors Zachary Bernstein, Blake Goodman and Zach Sinykin launched the outlet Eyes on the Capitol in January 2018 to publish political news, opinion pieces and analysis of national politics. A couple of hours before the first polls closed on Election Day, the trio sat down to talk with Jeff Bernstein, a professor of political science at Eastern Michigan University and GW College Republicans Chairman Josh Kutner to hear out their analysis on election results.
Bernstein introduced his father, Jeff Bernstein, as the first guest, joking that while “a lot of news networks talk about their in house talent,” he literally has an in-house expert. Jeff Bernstein said “something pretty significant” would need to happen for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden to lose the election.
Professor Bernstein said voter demographics like Catholic Americans, White males without a college degree and African Americans were key to deciding the outcome of the 2016 presidential race. He said religious matters are usually a “code word” for “abortion,” prompting many Catholics to endorse the candidate who supports that cause, which was President Donald Trump four years ago.
Jeff Bernstein added that other topics, like how votes will be reported in waves this year depending on the number of mail-in ballots, may lag election results.
“Count all the votes,” he said. “Count all the votes.”
Kutner was introduced onto the livestream next, saying he hopes for Trump’s victory and for the Republican senate races.
“There is definitely more optimism at least among the college Republicans that I speak to than pollsters are saying,” he said.
GW College Republicans student leaders said the organization is split on their support for Trump this election cycle.
Although after showing a print out of his state by state predictions, Kutner admitted that it might be a rough night.
“If my predictions are right, you might be having a more fun night than me who will be sweating through this tie. But this is what political junkies live for,” Kutner said.

Students approved a package of amendments to the SA constitution in the spring 2020 elections, including one that created seats specifically allocated for first-year undergraduate and graduate students.
Student Court judges held a public hearing Thursday for an ongoing case about the status of first-year Student Association Senate seats.
Witte v. SA, a case filed last April by then-SA Sen. AJ Link, Law-G, and Robert Witte, G-at-Large, concerns the rationale behind including two first-year seats – one undergraduate and one graduate – in the senate as part of efforts to increase first-year representation in the body. Judges questioned both sides about the court’s possible actions, like “completely” striking the SA constitution of designated first-year seats, and the relation between the rules of the Statement on Student Rights and Responsibilities handbook and the senate’s processes.
Students approved a referendum in the spring that created seats specifically allocated for first-year undergraduate and graduate students.
Witte, who is serving as the plaintiff, said the inclusion of first-year seats in the constitution “breaches representational equality” because it allows first-year undergraduate and graduate students to serve two semesters without needing to be elected by the student body.
First-year senate seats, which are filled in the fall by a senate vote, do not have voting rights in the senate and can be converted to undergraduate-at-large and graduate-at large seats, respectively, in a senator’s second semester in the body, according to the SA constitution. In the at-large seats, those senators can acquire voting rights, the constitution states.
Witte said the first-year senators amendment does not allow for a democratic election because the senate fills first-year seats in the fall instead of through a student body vote. He said the amendment allowing first-year senators should be eliminated or altered to include a more democratic process for selection.
“The Statement of Rights and Responsibilities specifically recognizes that the University recognizes the students’ right to elect representatives,” he said. “They don’t mention anything about appointing representatives.”
But Jean Hyun, the SA vice president for judicial and legislative affairs and the defendant, said allocating seats to first-year students “does not violate the charter” because its language states any group of students who represent less than half of the student body can be selected in a manor the SA sees fit. These groups will be chosen in a way to “create or preserve essential representation and equality,” she said.
She said multiple articles in SA governing documents outline the body’s powers to impose a system of “representative governance” that best fits all students.
Hyun said in a brief submitted to the court in September that the SA’s charter does not equate a method of representational governance to proportional representation.
“In fact, the SA is obligated to provide representation to inadequately represented groups of students because Article III of the charter requires them to make every effort to meet the needs of the students,” Hyun said at the hearing.
