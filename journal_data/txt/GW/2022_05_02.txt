Drivers began picketing outside the bus depot Tuesday morning after accusing the company in charge of operating the Circulator of unfair labor practices.
Drivers for the D.C. Circulator bus system went on strike Tuesday, citing stalled collective bargaining agreement negotiations and “unfair” labor practices during contract discussions with their employer RATP Dev.
The Circulator, jointly operated by the District Department of Transportation and French transportation company RAPT Dev, acts as a shuttle service with fixed routes and schedules serving predominantly Northwest D.C. neighborhoods and the National Mall. Amalgamated Transit Union Local 689 – the D.C. chapter of the national labor union which represents workers in the transit industry – President Raymond Jackson said in a release that RATP Dev left drivers with “no other option” but to go on strike and alleged RATP Dev committed multiple unfair labor practice violations during the negotiations.
“We encourage commuters to seek other forms of public transportation throughout the city,” Jackson said in the release. “After months of negotiations, it has become clear that RATP Dev has been negotiating in bad faith, committing multiple unfair labor practice violations in the process.”
The Circulator operates six stops north of the Foggy Bottom campus, with four stops on its Georgetown-Union Station line and two stops on its DuPont Circle-Georgetown-Rosslyn line respectively. Only two of several dozen Circulator buses operated Tuesday, according to the Washington Post, leaving some riders stranded.

The League of Women Voters D.C. partnered with GW to host the in-person forum, which Cheryl W. Thompson moderated.
D.C. mayoral candidates gathered at the School of Media and Public Affairs to discuss their plans for affordable housing, crime, policing and education if elected into the city’s top spot.
Mayor Muriel Bowser, At-Large Council member Robert White, Ward 8 Council member Trayon White, James Butler and Rodney “Red” Grant presented their plans to address crime in the District and bring D.C. out of the pandemic. GW and the League of Women Voters D.C. partnered to host the in-person forum that Cheryl W. Thompson, an associate professor in SMPA and a senior editor for investigations at NPR, moderated last Wednesday.
Mayor Muriel Bowser cited accomplishments during her term like increasing enrollment in D.C. Public Schools as a reason for her reelection to a third term as mayor. She said her next goal for D.C. is to focus on bringing the city out of the COVID-19 pandemic.
“We have to really know how we’re going to bring our downtown back, how we’re going to fill spaces, how we’re going to change spaces, how we’re going to bring more people toward downtown and get our business economy going again and working with our federal partners to do exactly that,” Bowser said.
Bowser said she plans to hire 347 new Metropolitan Police Department officers in the next fiscal year if the Council approves her proposed budget. She said the department is also aiming to hire more women into its ranks and hopes women will make up 30 percent of MPD by 2030.
“We have based that hiring on incentives to be able to recruit officers,” Bowser said. “We’ve done the research, we know what’s important to young people who are considering departments around the country.”
Robert White said his experiences as a “fifth-generation Washingtonian” and his support for the District through roles like working with Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., prepared him for the position of mayor.
“My life has been defined by overcoming obstacles,” White said. “Like so many native Washingtonians, I grew up in a city that was difficult, and I watched my family struggle for decades just trying to get footing in this city that we love.”
White said the lack of affordable housing in the District is reflected in the fact that his father, who he described as one of the “proudest Washingtonians,” can’t afford to live in D.C. due to the high cost of housing.
“These are people who belong here who should be able to stay here,” White said. “And so when I think about the issue of affordable housing, I think about my family, and I think about the other families that no longer can afford to live here.”
Butler, a former advisory neighborhood commissioner and the former head of a law firm, spoke about his plans to stop the use of illegal guns in the District and his proposal to hire an additional 700 police officers into MPD to make D.C. one of the “safest cities” in the country.
“D.C. is at a 20-year high for gun violence,” Butler said. “If we give the present mayor four more years we don’t know if it will be at a 30-year high. Both of my opponents are ‘defund the police,’ have moved to strip public safety budgets and they’re all career politicians. It’s time we get someone in with a plan.”
Butler also spoke about his disbarment from the D.C. bar in 2009, after officials found the law firm he used to run mismanaged the representation of its clients. A report from a D.C. Court of Appeals hearing committee said that the firm’s employees obtained retainers from clients but did not speak with the clients when the clients called and later handed the case over to associates who were unprepared to handle cases.
“I’ve learned a lot from it,” Butler said. “I didn’t run from this problem. I’ve stayed in the community. I’ve stayed invested in the communities. I’ve given so much back to this community, and I continue to give back to the community”
Trayon White spoke about his observations through his time as a Council member working on problems like police-community relations in the District.
“I’m not a politician,” White said. “I’m just a guy from the community.”
Trayon White talked about using a “public health” approach to public safety through actions like District-provided mental health services for victims of crime. He said through his visits to crime scenes, he sees a need for people who witness violent crimes to receive some form of mental health support.
“I don’t see anybody working with the kids after just seeing somebody get shot or stabbed or whatever,” White said.
Rodney “Red” Grant, a humanitarian, comedian and film producer, spoke about his role as an independent candidate and how his experience in different lines of work differentiates him from the other candidates.
“As an executive, Viacom entrusted me to employ thousands of people, work with millions of dollars in budgets and 25 different television shows from behind the camera,” Grant said. “My career experiences have taken me different places, unlike the party-line politics that’s going on here in D.C.”
Grant said MPD officers need to be trained to be more “sensitive” to their local communities through community policing. He cited his experiences growing up in Southeast D.C. as helping him understand the perspectives of both police and D.C. citizens in conversations about policing.
“I’m sensitive to both sides because I come from my side of the track where it was a lot of danger, a lot of crime,” Grant said. “And thank God I got out of it. But you know my wife, and we talk about it all the time, I think we all have to be sensitive to this situation.”
Kathy Chiron, the president of the League of Women Voters D.C., gave closing remarks and talked about how the forum “exemplified” the organization’s mission to empower voters and defend democracy.
“I want to take this opportunity to thank the candidates for taking time to be with us tonight, so we could get to know you and learn about policies and ideas,” Chiron said.

“It’s time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the leaked majority opinion draft.
Hundreds of protesters have demonstrated outside of the Supreme Court building from Monday night and into Tuesday afternoon after POLITICO leaked a draft majority opinion striking down Roe v. Wade.
The draft majority opinion, which Associate Justice Samuel Alito wrote and the Supreme Court confirmed to be authentic Tuesday, states the Roe v. Wade decision that ruled abortion is a constitutionally protected right was “egregiously wrong,” leading the court to return the issue to the state level. Protesters outside the Supreme Court said the decision was an attack on the rights of people seeking abortions, and action must be taken to protect them.
“It’s time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives,” Alito wrote in the majority opinion draft.
If enacted, the obtained draft would overturn a 49-year precedent dating back to the 1973 Roe v. Wade case in which the court decided the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause extends the right to privacy to include the right to an abortion. A POLITICO source familiar with the Court’s proceedings said justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett voted with Alito on the opinion in December, but judges can be fluid with their vote until the decision is likely published within the next two months.
At least 500 people gathered outside the courthouse Monday night, including a mix of pro-choice activists calling for abortion protections and anti-abortion counterprotesters defending the leaked decision. The demonstrations at the Supreme Court have continued Tuesday, drawing a crowd of about 200 to 300 throughout the afternoon.
Monday night’s protest started at about 9:30 p.m., with about 50 pro-choice protesters arriving with candles and signs about an hour after the POLITICO leak. The crowd of pro-choice protesters continued to grow with hundreds of people turning out throughout the night.
At 10:45 p.m., about 10 anti-abortion protesters arrived at the court, banging drums and chanting “Roe v. Wade has got to go.”
Police presence outside the building remained minimal, with about 10 Supreme Court police officers standing on the steps behind the barrier and in front of the building, and at least four Metropolitan Police Department cars and motorcycles parked near the intersections on either side of the court on First Street. About 30 Capitol Police officers formed a line next to the protest adjacent to East Capitol Street.
About two hours after the protest began, a group of protesters holding a large banner that read “the people are supreme” stood in front of the barrier that separated the Supreme Court building and the sidewalk where the protests took place. Organizers then encouraged protesters to join the group and link hands in front of the court, who then chanted “Hey hey! Ho ho! Abortion bans have got to go!” and “They say no choice, we say pro-choice!”

Sanchi Rohira, a sophomore at Georgetown University, said she was in the middle of writing a paper for her women and gender studies class when she got a notification saying the Supreme Court was set to strike down Roe v. Wade. Rohira said she attended the protest because the issue of abortion rights was “personal” to her, and said she felt her voice was “disproportionately powerful” in a city like D.C.
“We’re here not just for ourselves, but for the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who cannot be here, but people who are predominantly Black and brown working class immigrants, for whom Roe is not just about whether or not you can get an abortion if you have the money for it,” Rohira said.
Rohira said after anti-abortion counterprotesters began “tormenting” her friends as they protested the court’s draft opinion in silence, she and another protestor joined hands to form a wall around her friends to protect them. Rohira said several others began to join the wall, which she said became a way to further protect any pro-choice protesters who wanted to grieve after the leak of the draft opinion.
“Our idea here is to be more somber and recognize the depth and the intensity of what is going on here and to just form a chain of solidarity,” Rohira said.

At about 12:30 a.m., D.C. Council member Janeese Lewis George of Ward 4 joined the protest and said the Supreme Court’s draft decision was a “travesty” and an infringement on human rights. She told the crowd to “get ready” to organize and said activists have won the right to choose to have an abortion before, and will do so again.
“Don’t be sad, don’t despair,” George said. “We have fought, we have organized and we have won.”
George said the issue of abortion rights was also an issue of workers’ rights, and said Democrats in Congress should remove the filibuster – one of the major procedural hurdles for the Democratic majority of the Senate – and codify Roe v. Wade, which would mean passing a law affirming people’s rights to choose to have an abortion. George then told the protesters to “dismantle systems” of oppression and led chants of “We’re not going backwards.”

Bella Kumar, a freshman at GW and a Sunrise GW hub coordinator, said she started receiving texts from other GW students shortly after the draft opinion was leaked and immediately organized plans to head to the Supreme Court with candles and signs to protest.
“This is a whole coalition of people, who are not just women, who are upset because abortion affects everyone – men, women, nonbinary people, trans men, trans women, people of the like,” Kumar said.
Kumar said it was “disturbing but beautiful” to see the high turnout of protesters following the publication of the leaked draft opinion.
“We’re all just here because we’re upset,” Kumar said. “I don’t think it takes more than that.”
Natalie Fontana, a GW sophomore studying international affairs, said she was preparing for a final when she heard the news of the Roe v. Wade decision. She said she plans to continue to protest outside of the Supreme Court in the coming days while working around her finals schedule.
“This needs to come first in the end, which is just crazy that we as busy college students have to come here and protest for rights which we should have concrete 100 percent,” Fontana said. “But we’re still going to be here.”
Fontana said the decision is an “intersectional issue” that impacts all people with uteruses, including those who don’t identify as women. She said the topic requires more attention than it currently receives.
“It’s something that we really just need to talk about and you need to get loud about it,” Fontana said.

At least 500 people congregated outside the Supreme Court Monday night after a leaked draft majority opinion revealed the court voted to strike down Roe v. Wade, a move that would wipe away federal abortion protections.
Hundreds of protesters gathered at the Supreme Court Monday night after a leaked draft majority opinion showed the Supreme Court voted to strike down the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision and eliminate federal constitutional protections for abortion.
The crowd outside the courthouse grew to at least 500 people Monday night after POLITICO published the leaked document that was drafted in February, drawing pro-choice activists calling for abortion protections and anti-abortion counterprotesters defending the leaked decision. The court’s decision is not final until it is made public, which will likely happen in the next two months, according to POLITICO.
Here is a glimpse of the protesters, who congregated near the barricades of the Supreme Court throughout the night:

The Student Court did not release a preliminary order last month because neither the plaintiff nor the defendant requested a prompt decision. 
Updated: May 2, 2022 at 3:56 p.m.
The Student Court struck down a Student Association bylaw that allowed the finance committee to sanction student organizations Sunday.
The SA Office of the Legislator General filed a lawsuit against the chair of the SA Senate’s finance committee in February opposing sections of the Financial Reorganization Act – a bill that amended the SA’s finance bylaws in December, allowing the finance committee to impose sanctions and fines on student organizations that break from SA finance policies. The court ruled in a 6-1 decision Sunday that only the SA’s executive branch – specifically the treasurer’s office – can sanction student organizations, invalidating the finance committee’s sanctioning power but keeping the other bylaw updates that define the parameters of the finance committee and set up general allocations.
“Our holding is based on our conclusion that the power to sanction is an executive power that properly lies within the Executive Branch—which Section 511 unconstitutionally vests in the Legislative Branch,” the decision states. “And we reiterate that the exercise of the sanctioning power must, at the very least, comply with the basic standards of due process guaranteed by the Constitution or otherwise identified by decisions of this court.”
Xu sponsored the Financial Reform Act in March in an effort to nullify the Student Court case. Senators unanimously passed the act to remove sanctioning power from the SA’s bylaws after June 30th, but the court found that the bill didn’t “render the plaintiffs’ challenge moot,” rejecting Xu’s bid to circumvent the court and extending the case until Sunday’s ruling.
The plaintiffs argued that the court should strike down the committee’s sanctioning power as unconstitutional but said the rest of the act should remain in place, which the court ultimately agreed with. Juan Carlos Mora, an assistant legislator general and a plaintiff, said the power to sanction student organizations lies solely within the executive branch, specifically the treasurer.
“While the Senate plays the primary role in moving the legislation and identifying what kind of conduct is unlawful in this case, the enumerated kinds of conduct, like political activity, like certain usage of equipment, then it’s up to the executive to be able to enforce this power,” he said in oral arguments last month.
Xu countered this and said that the finance committee will only theoretically be able to sanction student organizations until the power expires in July because of the updated legislation the senate passed, rendering the case irrelevant. He said that under his proposed sanction system, the senate and the court could have appealed any sanctioning decisions the finance committee made.
“The defendant believes that the treasurer should be acting as a prosecutor, the finance committee acting as a hearing panel,” he said. “The senate should be the first step to appeal, and the court will be the last resort to solve any dispute.”
The Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities can also sanction student organizations for violating the Code of Student Conduct and sanctioned student organizations can face punishments like suspension, censure and expulsion.
Xu said the University “must be involved” in all sanctioning processes, including the SA’s. He said because the SA receives funding from the University, the treasurer must discuss with officials throughout the sanctioning process to determine if an organization violated the Code of Student Conduct.
“If the University does not participate in this process, the treasurer has no way to learn all this information before it raises charges against student organization,” Xu said.
The court’s decision states the SA’s power to sanction demonstrates student autonomy and self-governance. In presentation of the judgement Sunday, Chief Justice Yun-Da Tsai said the University is not subject to the same limitations as the SA because “the Board of Trustees gives them an immense amount of power.”
“The fact of the matter is that once the SA has been given the power, so long as the University has not preempted the SA from exercising its power in those areas, it has been granted power,” he said.
The decision states that although the defense argues that there has never been a situation where the sanctioning powers within the SA were unclear, that does not mean there is not a question about the SA Constitution that the court needs to answer.
“To hold otherwise would sharply curtail this court’s review of duly enacted legislation in flagrant contravention of the constitution’s grant of judicial power and this court’s solemn duty and responsibility to hear cases plainly falling within our jurisdiction,” the decision states.
Associate Justice Fatmah Noredin, who wrote the dissenting opinion, said the treasurer and the finance committee are inherently involved in the sanctioning process, so they should share the power to sanction with the executive branch.
“I believe that the sanctioning power can be shared among the branches,” she said.
The court’s majority decision states the treasurer must follow the existing rules having to do with SA funding and sanctioning, and the treasurer must “timely notify” any organizations they sanction. The decision declares the finance committees’ sanctioning power as ”unconstitutional and invalid for all purposes,” and it revises any sanctions administered under SA bylaws.
“Our decision here today reiterates the responsibility of the Student Association to police the disbursement and use of Student Association funds, abide by the fundamental organizational principles provided in the governing documents of the Student Association, and afford registered student organizations the basic due process necessary for fair and just exercise of the sanctioning power,” the decision stated.
This post was updated to correct the following:
The Hatchet incorrectly reported the decision to invalidate the finance committee’s sanctioning power was decided with a 5-2 vote. That question was decided with a 6-1 vote, with Noredin dissenting. Associate Justice Devin Eager concurred with the decision to invalidate the sanctioning finance committee’s sanctioning power, but dissented from the court when he argued the court should also invalidate the two pieces of related SA legislation.
The Hatchet also incorrectly spelled the name of Chief Justice Yun-Da Tsai. It is now spelled correctly.
We regret these errors.
