A federal appeals court Friday temporarily blocked President Joe Biden’s recently announced student loan forgiveness plan.
Six Republican-led states motioned in September to block the program, saying it is an overreach of Biden’s executive powers. It is unclear how the decision will affect the 22 million borrowers who have applied for aid.
White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said borrowers should still apply for debt relief as the court order does not prevent applications or the review process.
“We will continue to move full speed ahead in our preparations in compliance with this order,” she said in a statement. “And the administration will continue to fight Republican officials suing to block our efforts to provide relief to working families.”
The plan would forgive $10,000 in student loan debt for individuals or households making less than $125,000 annually.
Initially, payments were not expected to be disbursed until Oct. 23. Now, it is unclear whether they will go into effect by Jan. 1, when the pandemic-caused freeze on loan payments expires.
Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said the Biden administration is “moving full speed ahead” to process debt relief applications regardless of the temporary decision.
“President Biden and this administration are committed to fighting for the millions of hardworking students and borrowers across the country,” he said.

SA Sen. Kai Simson, CPS-G, who sponsored the resolution, said students struggle to vote while taking classes, working and participating in extracurriculars, even though they may be more politically active than the average youth.
The Student Association Senate, in its annual meeting on the Mount Vernon Campus on Monday, unanimously approved a resolution calling on the University to make it easier for students to vote on Election Day.
The Election Day Voting Act recommends that faculty permit excused absences on Election Day, which falls on Tuesday, Nov. 8. The resolution urges professors against scheduling due dates for graded assignments or exams on Election Day.
SA Sen. Kai Simson, CPS-G, who sponsored the resolution, said despite being more politically active than the average youth, GW students struggle to vote while taking classes, working and participating in extracurriculars.
“By enacting the Election Day Voting Act, GW has a way to show its community that voting and the opportunity to vote is a priority,” he said.
The senate unanimously confirmed Keanu Rowe as the chief of staff of President Christian Zidouemba after the Student Court decided earlier this month that the senate unconstitutionally confirmed Rowe in May. The court found the confirmation was unconstitutional because the senate confirmed two people to the same position.
“Although my original confirmation was illegitimate in the eyes of law, I executed the responsibilities of the chief of staff position to the best of my ability,” he said.
The senate also unanimously confirmed Rebecca Aduclasse as the executive secretary for graduate student life, Adam Galland as the director of inventory and Aditcharan Thyagarajan and Cradler Volmar as assistant legislators general.
The senate failed to pass the Mount Vernon Meeting Act, which would have removed the bylaw requiring the senate to hold at least one meeting on the Mount Vernon Campus each academic year. The resolution received 21 votes in support, five short of the 26 to reach the required two-thirds majority.
SA Sen. Simon Patmore-Zarcone, Law-G, who sponsored the resolution, said the senate’s requirement to meet on the Vern each year is unnecessary and burdensome. He said now that senate meetings are live-streamed, freshmen can easily attend regardless of where the meeting is held, while graduate students struggle to access the Vern.
“In particular, graduate students such as myself are adversely affected,” he said. “Tonight, if I were to take public transit home, it would likely take almost two hours to get back.”
Only eight senators attended the meeting in person, with the rest attending virtually or voting by proxy. Patmore-Zarcone said no Vern residents attended the meeting, and attendance was limited to SA members, University officials and Hatchet reporters.
Five senators opposed the resolution. SA Sen. Carille Walcott, GWSB-G, said the SA should ignore the inconvenience of meeting on the Vern annually because it only occurs once per year.
“Who knows next year if you have a bigger attendance,” she said.
Zidouemba said students have submitted more than 1,000 responses to a survey seeking input on distributing Plan B vending machines on campus, which could distribute the emergency contraceptive. Zidouemba announced at the beginning of the year a plan to put vending machines for contraceptives on campus after the reversal of Roe v. Wade, following a similar move at Northeastern University.
“The future of this initiative is bright,” Zidouemba said. “And I’m hopeful for what it can be for women across our University.”
SA Vice President Yan Xu said the SA has reserved spaces in the University Student Center for the career fair that will take place during the spring semester.
Senate Chairperson Pro Tempore Demetrius Apostolis said the fair will happen over three days in February on the third floor of the University Student Center.
He also said the Governing Documents Review Committee, which the senate created this summer following an attempt to remove Zidouemba from office, has looked over sections of the SA Constitution having to do with the executive, legislative and judicial branches. Apostolis said the committee will re-draft parts of the constitution, which it will complete some time in February.
The next Senate meeting will be held Nov. 7 at 8:30 p.m. in the Elliott School State Room.

Interim University President Mark Wrighton and Provost Chris Bracey will share reports with and take questions from the Faculty Assembly.
Officials will deliver updates on the search for the next permanent University president to professors during the Faculty Assembly meeting Monday.
Vice Chair of the Presidential Search Committee Jim Tielsch will share an update on the ongoing presidential search process with the Assembly, which is an annual meeting of all the University’s faculty. The update will follow officials’ release of the presidential profile, which details the attributes and qualifications the presidential search committee is looking for in potential candidates, earlier this month.
The release came after the Presidential Search Committee hosted a series of forums to gather feedback from faculty, staff members, students and alumni on the search process. The Assembly approved a 17-member committee of professors to advise the Board of Trustees’ Presidential Search Committee during its meeting last fall.
Tielsch, who also serves as the chair of the Faculty Senate’s executive committee, will also share a report on the senate’s activities since October 2021.
Interim University President Mark Wrighton and Provost Chris Bracey will share reports with and take questions from the assembly.
The assembly will also welcome new faculty members who joined the University this year.

Biden said the application requires the applicant’s name, date of birth, contact information and social security number.
President Joe Biden announced the launch of the federal student debt relief application at a press conference Monday.
The application, open until Dec. 31, launched about two months after Biden announced his plan to cancel up to $10,000 of federal student debt for borrowers earning less than $125,000 a year and $20,000 for Pell-Grant recipients. Biden said borrowers with remaining federal student debt after the cancellation and borrowers who do not qualify for the debt cancellation will resume student debt repayment in January after the debt moratorium ends and loan repayments go back into effect.
The Department of Education opened the application last week in a preliminary “beta test” of the application to pinpoint any issues with the application website before officially launching the application. Biden said eight million borrowers applied for debt relief during the beta test without any issues with the application website.
“This is a game changer for millions of Americans,” Biden said at the press conference.
Officials said 29 percent of undergraduate GW students received federal loans during the last academic year, about 30 percentage points below national trends.
Biden said the application requires the applicant’s name, date of birth, contact information and social security number. He said the application is available in English and Spanish and does not require applicants to upload any documents.
He said more than 90 million Americans are eligible for federal student debt relief, and 90 percent of eligible borrowers are individuals who make less than $75,000 a year.
Experts in higher education and finance said the debt cancellation program will aid many borrowers but should target financially struggling or low-income individuals like borrowers who did not finish college.
“Not a dime will go to those in the top five percent of the income bracket. Period,” Biden said.

WMATA General Manager CEO Randy Clarke said in the release that the lack of available 7000-series railcars has led to overcrowding in several Metro stations, which would only be strained more by opening the Silver line's six additional stops.

The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority announced it could open its new Silver Line stops to riders as early as Thanksgiving, but it does not currently have enough available trains for the extended service.
WMATA officials said in a release that the Silver Line extension – which began in 2014 and will add a Metro stop at the Washington Dulles International Airport – could be ready to operate by Thanksgiving, but the opening hinges on the 7000-series trains being approved to return to operation. Metro officials removed its 7000-series railcar fleet from operations last year after a derailment on the Blue Line in October, but officials have recently started reintroducing the cars back into service as safety inspections continue.
WMATA General Manager and CEO Randy Clarke said the lack of available 7000-series railcars has led to overcrowding in several Metro stations, which opening the Silver Line’s six additional stops would further strain.
“Since control of the extension was turned over to Metro, we and our partners at the Airports Authority, Fairfax and Loudoun have worked diligently to complete all of the steps needed for Metro to offer safe and reliable service for rail travel to Dulles Airport and Loudoun County, and we are just awaiting concurrence from our Safety Commission partners,” Clarke said in the release.
The Silver Line extension will add three new stations and extend Metro’s reach into Virginia. The new stops will also be the first Metro stops located in Loudoun County.
Deputy CEO & COO of the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission Sharmila Samarasinghe said in a letter to COO of WMATA Brian Dwyer Monday that WMSC objected to WMATA’s Return to Service plan because the axles on 7000-series railcars failed Metro’s safety standards 79 times during inspections. Samarasinghe said WMATA officials’ statements implying the trains were safe and ready to operate “deeply concerned” WMSC officials. 
“It is concerning to the WMSC that Metrorail may not be interested in carrying out its safety responsibilities, even going so far as to have senior leadership suggest at a public WMATA Board Meeting that Metrorail will only mitigate known safety issues if ordered to do so,” Samarasinghe said in the letter.
WMATA responded to WMSC’s letter in their Wednesday release, stating the letter provided “confusing direction” to Metro, like contradictory directives based on the safety of 7000-series railcars and axle manufacturing recommendations that would be “operationally infeasible.” Dwyer said in the release that while Metro acknowledges the importance of the safety inspections, the agency would “welcome” a more consistent directive from the WMSC.
“We have developed an industry-leading inspection process in which we have high confidence,” Dwyer said in the release. “At the end of the day, all we’re asking is for our customers to be able to ride on the same trains as our employees.”

Junior goalkeeper Luca Castorina and graduate student center Pateros said they moved to the U.S. to strike a balance between water polo and a higher degree of education, which they have found at GW.
Water polo’s center and goalkeeper have become a dynamic duo grounding both sides of the Colonials’ pool in the final month of their dominant regular season play.
Split between an impenetrable defensive wall at the goal and a blazing scoring front, junior goalkeeper Luca Castorina and graduate student center Theodoros Pateros have catapulted the Colonials (16-2) to the top of the 11-team Middle Atlantic Water Polo Conference following a 15-game winning streak. Both athletes have earned conference player of the week nods while leading the team in saves and scoring respectively and positioning GW for a threatening postseason run for the MAWPC Championship crown.
Castorina and Pateros, two of the team’s six international student-athletes, said they moved to the United States to strike a balance between water polo and a higher degree of education and that they could not find mutually available at any other institution in Europe. After arriving at GW this fall, Pateros has electrified the GW offense to complement the defensive prowess of Castorina at the net.
Pateros has fired 81 goals over 18 games, while GW the MAWPC gave him player of the week honors for his unrelenting offense in the pool in September. Castorina has compiled 206 saves and 11 steals throughout the season to anchor the Colonials defense, receiving the MAWPC Defensive Player of the Week title in late September after registering 49 saves.
“I chose to play polo during college because I think it’s a great opportunity for us to both play sports and at a high level and also be at a high academic level,” Castorina said in an interview Tuesday. “So for example, I’m studying right now international business, so if I did that in Europe, it would have been way harder because you can either focus on sports or you focus on academics. But the U.S. gives this chance to study and play sports at a high level at the same time.”
Castorina credits much of his defensive game to his time on the U-17 Italian national team in 2019, where he helped the squad win gold at the European Championships. He said the international tournament introduced him to a higher level of competition that advanced his defensive IQ as a goalkeeper to direct the defense in front of him when the opposing offense surges.
“Until now, I’ve been the leader of the defense since I kind of know all the positions where all of the defenders have to be,” Castorina said. “And also, I’m a person that talks a lot during the games, so I kind of try always to help them.”
Even with his stellar performance, Castorina said it was hard to adjust to water polo in the United States with different elements to the game, like referees who are quicker to remove players from the pool for misbehavior than those in other sports. He said he works to maintain his composure during intense matches to avoid potential ejection from the pool.
“It was hard to adapt also to the method of reffing that they use because they’re way more strict than in Europe, and also the refs kicked me out my first year because I yelled at them in Italian,” Castorina said. “I wasn’t really talking to them, I was just mad at the team. And they don’t understand Italian of course, and they just kicked me out.”
Castorina said the graduate student-athletes on the team have helped enhance team chemistry and support the center with each of their own experiences from other athletic programs during their undergraduate careers.
“We should win as a team, our conference and also maybe reach some individual awards so that we can also be remembered on paper,” Castorina said. “And, of course, the energy and the passion that we bring every day to the pool, I really hope that it’s going to always stay there.”
Pateros has emerged as the Colonials’ leading scorer in just his first season at GW with 41 goals – the seventh-highest count in the MAWPC. Before arriving in Foggy Bottom, he played at Long Beach State during his undergraduate years, scoring 93 goals across 75 games and leading the team to two NCAA tournament appearances.
“Obviously, at the end of the day, the only person that is credited for the goals, is the person scoring,” he said. “However, there’s a lot of work that goes behind that. And it’s ultimately my teammates that are putting me in this position, and I’ve been fortunate enough to be able to score.”
Pateros helped lead the Greek National Team to the Youth World Championship title in 2018 and represented Greece at the Junior European Championships and Mediterranean Cup in 2017.
He said the pace of play of competition at the collegiate level is much faster with predominantly younger competition in the United States in a sport that has gained popularity with college athletes in recent years. Water polo is one of the fastest-growing sports in the U.S. with nationwide competition increasing by 25 percent between 2011 and 2017, according to the most recently available data from USA Water Polo and the National Federation of High School Associations.
“It’s not very similar to what we’re used to in Europe,” Pateros said. “This is a more fast-paced game in the U.S. It’s like more college kids, younger people whereas in Europe, it’s older people. Usually, there’s not so much speed in the game, but there’s other things, like tactics are a lot more in-depth over there.”
He said during his three months at GW, the coaching staff has been accommodating of the team since they understand the challenging course load and balance of responsibility that come with a student-athlete’s lifestyle outside of games and practice.
Pateros said GW’s loss against Fordham Saturday served as a wake-up call for the team that developed an “untouchable” attitude while riding the 15-gam winning streak that overlooked technical mistakes despite higher levels of confidence. He said the team is looking to readjust for a final rematch against Fordham on Nov. 20, where they hope to get their revenge.
The Colonials look to find their winning stride again during a non-conference break where they will face No. 15 San Jose State and No. 16 California Baptist in Santa Clara, California.this weekend in the Julian Fraser Memorial tournament.
“We still have a long way to go,” Pateros said. “Our season is not done until Nov. 20, and this is when we’re going to be tested to see if we’re actually going to meet our goals. Those goals are definitely to win our conference and then there’s a plane game and take our chances against the winner of the other conference and see if we can make it to NCAA’s.”

A lack of disciplinary action against officers with a track record of inappropriate and despicable behavior has created a culture of inaction within the Metropolitan Police Department. A D.C. government audit released earlier this month revealed that three officers previously terminated for misconduct were back on the city’s police force. The audit comes after a December 2020 audit that revealed that 10 MPD officers raked in $5.6 million in backpay over an 18-month period. These officers regained their positions through an appeals process after they were fired, illustrating D.C.’s alarmingly high tolerance for violence and misconduct by police officers. MPD needs to shore up its officer disciplining procedure if the department plans to retain competent, considerate and moral officers protecting our public safety.
The level of protection D.C. residents receive is less dependable when armed police officers with histories of violence patrol the street. Police funding feeds officer deployment with funds meant to reinstate corrupt police officers with backpay, but stronger safety measures and policy reforms that can limit acts of police brutality deserve the same financial attention. MPD recognized that dozens of reinstated officers engaged in deplorable acts like child sex abuse, the improper firing of weapons and abuse of power with sex workers and those in associated professions. The department’s process for discipline and termination is malleable, acting in accordance with D.C. Code, the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations, the District Personnel Manual and precedent set by administrative and trial court decisions. But the Office of Employee Appeals – which allows city government employees to appeal personnel actions – can overturn these firings. Arbitration is hindering public safety in the District because of this permissive, police-first attitude, thereby curtailing the safety of D.C. residents, including GW students.
Policies and practices that allow dangerous officers back on the force are unacceptable and should be abolished immediately. MPD has rehired officers because “independent arbitrators believed firing to be too severe a punishment,” or because the department lacked the evidence to prove incompetence on part of the officer in question, according to the audit. Personal beliefs and subconscious biases influence decisions, especially those of an independent arbitrator or employee – as long as feelings toward police systems are as strong as ever. Racial and socioeconomic disparities that historically exist in MPD also contribute to the inequitable firing and rehiring on the basis of race, orientation or otherwise. To combat implicit biases, MPD should establish an ethics committee to set guidelines for arbitration use in these instances and set firmer boundaries to prevent officers who are convicted of violent crimes or unfit for service from returning to the force. 
MPD Officer Wilberto Flores represents a shining example of why the department’s current disciplinary process is so ineffective. Flores was fired in 2011 following a guilty verdict in criminal court for exposing his genitals to women in a parking lot. While a trial board recommended suspension, he was ultimately fired, given the severity of his actions. But MPD rehired Flores five years later after the Office of Employee Appeals stated the department overused its authority in penalizing him for his actions. Because he was charged with a crime as egregious as indecent exposure – a crime that police officers enforce with an arrest – keeping Flores out of the department would be a far more appropriate decision. If the rehire isn’t appalling enough, Flores also received more than $350,000 in backpay and has prompted three reports of misconduct, ranging from use of force to improper behavior, since returning to MPD. A lack of trust is ever present when we have dangerous officers like Flores charged with the responsibility of protecting us.
A lack of trust between MPD and D.C. citizens is harmful, given that there is already a history of misconduct, discrimination and inequity with regard to police conduct. The U.S. criminal legal system, inclusive of police departments, was founded on the tenets of discrimination and violence. A lack of discipline against officers who may contribute to the perpetuation of systemic tenets of violence, worsens a system already overrun with systemic bias and mistrust by citizens. As students encounter issues relating to safety in college, like assault or stronger security in public spaces at night, they need to know that those meant to protect them will do just that. MPD must be cautious when reinstating officers, with the entire reputation and dependability of the department on the line when doing so. 
The police are meant to protect us, not avoid scrutiny. It’s time to stop protecting them and start enacting measures to further keep the public safe, a job that independent arbitrators should not determine. It is critical to build and repair trust with police departments so students and D.C. residents alike can feel safe, secure and supported and trust that an officer won’t violate their rights to such feelings. With so much systemic damage and discrimination enduring across D.C. and the U.S., the money, resources and time wasted on these officers leave much to be desired.

By the time Thanksgiving break rolls around, it will have been three months since I’ve been back in Louisiana – home to my parents and my boyfriend. For most of us students who live outside the DMV, the extended breaks from school are our only times to see loved ones back home and enjoy a well-deserved period of recuperation from months of taxing classes and schoolwork. But GW’s Thanksgiving and winter breaks do not budget enough time for students to do so and become more of a short-lived inconvenience that’s no longer worth the appalling price of travel. A five-day Thanksgiving respite and a winter break that officially commences for some two days before Christmas Eve leaves no time for students to embrace their friends, family and childhood holiday traditions. GW should offer the whole week off for Thanksgiving and wrap up final exams a week earlier so students can get the most of their time off during an otherwise-burdensome school year.
Out of my five days of Thanksgiving Break, two are for traveling and only three are for actual enjoyment and relaxation at home. With my classes set to resume Monday at 11:00 a.m., my time at home ends early Sunday morning to catch a flight back to the District. Three days are not sufficient to make memories with family members and friends you haven’t seen in months and return to class recharged. A whole week off for Thanksgiving would give students enough time to relax and rediscover the joys of reconnecting with loved ones.
Other universities have set the precedent of giving students longer breaks, and GW must take the initiative to follow. As a tradeoff for kickstarting fall classes Aug. 22, one week before GW, my friends at Baylor and Tulane universities get the whole week off for Thanksgiving and finish the semester less than two weeks into December, compared to GW’s last day of final exams Dec. 22. When my friends are home enjoying the holidays and spending time with their loved ones, I will still be taking finals on campus. That can feel very isolating when you’re more than 1,200 miles from home. The people I feel closest to aren’t easily accessible, and extended holidays like Thanksgiving and winter break are my primary chance to see them. Nearly 80 percent of GW’s undergraduate students are from outside of the DMV area and deserve the chance to enjoy a fulfilling break from classes. Even if it means making up for the lost time elsewhere, the University needs to provide these students with the full week off for Thanksgiving and add an extra week off for winter break. I would be more than willing to start classes a week earlier if it meant I could spend quality time with the ones I miss and love back home.
I couldn’t finalize my travel plans home for the holiday season until about two weeks ago when my professors told me when my final exams would be in December. By then, ticket prices had soared compared to what I would have paid in August or September. Plane tickets for holiday travel are noticeably pricier than other times of the year with higher demand. If you bought a ticket this week, the trip to my Louisiana hometown would cost $1,319.70, not including the price of seats or the luggage – roughly double the cost of the same trip in August.
Even though GW publishes an official final exam schedule, not every professor plans an in-person exam for that day. The longer professors delay informing students when their final exams will be, the more students will need to pay for their tickets home. Other forms of transportation are essentially impossible for me because of their inefficiency, with car or train trips that can take up to 42 hours. For a five-day break, flying home is the only realistic option, one that is extremely expensive and unaffordable for many. With exorbitant prices for a visit covering a handful of days, I thought I’d have to spend the holidays alone and forego the financial burden of travel expenses piled on top of tuition. What should be a time to enjoy family, friends and a break turns into two days of worrying if the cost was even worth it.
To avoid the increased cost and experience a more fulfilling break, many students skip their Monday and Tuesday classes before Thanksgiving to enjoy the full week off, choosing to sacrifice their academic responsibility just for a much-deserved rest. Midterm season has been in full swing through the month and will continue for many after fall break. Students are already experiencing extreme burnout. I am tired, as is everyone at GW, and we will be even more exhausted by the time Thanksgiving arrives. I know I would also skip classes Monday and Tuesday if it didn’t mean sacrificing my grade. Time away from classes and residence halls are necessary for the well-being of students. We shouldn’t have to be cornered between seeing our loved ones, taking the time off we need to care for ourselves or staying alone to avoid spending money. If GW was more considerate, students wouldn’t have to make the choice between prioritizing themselves and essential rest time needed to thrive inside the classroom and beyond.
