Residents of The Dakota will lose one of their building’s most coveted features over winter break – washers and dryers in each room – three months after a dryer caught fire in the hall.
The University will remove laundry machines from each quad and triple in the sophomore residence hall starting next week, which University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard said was “out of an abundance of caution and to maintain building safety.”
The Dakota’s first-floor laundry room will be expanded to six washers and six dryers, leaving just two other residence halls, South Hall and 1957 E Street, to offer free in-room laundry service.
Dakota residents learned about the machine removal Wednesday, though some students said they had known earlier, because facilities workers had already begun preparing to remove the machines in their rooms.
Sherrard said the University reviewed the hall’s washer and dryer system after the September fire, and “determined that the building is not configured for the optimal operation of units in individual rooms.”
The fire, which broke out in a fifth-floor room Sept. 11, caused $340,000 of damage, largely due to water soaking through lower floors. The incident, which inspectors called an accident, displaced 52 students for more than a week.
Residents can use the first-floor laundry machines at no cost for the rest of the academic year, but will incur charges starting next fall.
But some students said the University should provide more than free laundry for the rest of the year.
“I am paying a lot more to live in Dakota, and part of the reason I am paying that much is because we have our own washers and dryers,” Emadaldin Kassem said.
Rooms in The Dakota range from $11,200 to $13,400 for a year, a cost Kassem considers to include private laundry facilities. The room also includes dishwashers. Sherrard said the University will not refund students for housing costs after it removes the laundry machines.
Sophomore Jacqueline Rose, agrees with Kassem, and said it would be inconvenient to go down to the first floor to do laundry.
“I am paying a lot to live here, so for the University to remove the washers and dryers makes me furious,” Rose said. “I think that the people who were responsible for the fire should have them removed and not everyone else.”

You might think it would be a good thing to be popular. But right about now, anthropology majors are probably wishing classes in their department weren’t such hot commodities.
With increasingly competitive registration for anthropology classes, the department is struggling to accommodate its own majors.
The problem is that upper-level classes quickly fill up with students from the Elliott School of International Affairs looking to satisfy their requirements with anthropology or geography classes.
The University should respond to the high demand by allowing the department to hire more professors.
Despite the growing need, the anthropology department has experienced considerable pushback from the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences’ administration in response to its plea for more professors.
It’s impossible to just push Elliott School students out of these classes. They need to take them to fulfill requirements like conflict and security and international development. Like students in every school, they have a strict curriculum to follow.
But students don’t just enroll in these classes because they’re requirements. They may take a course and decide they love the subject and choose to double-major in it.
Just because the number of students in the Elliott School taking anthropology courses is going up doesn’t mean that the University shouldn’t accommodate CCAS anthropology students. In reality, all students in the major should be treated equally and given the opportunity to enroll in small, discussion-based courses.
The solution is to increase the number of sections taught in the department. And that can only happen if there are more professors.
Having more professors in the anthropology department would also improve the University’s commitment to research, since it is a discipline with extensive field research opportunities.
The department has searched for ways to prioritize their own majors for these upper-level anthropology courses, but the only way they’ve managed to do so has been by increasing class sizes, which is detrimental when it comes to facilitating class discussion.
The best classes I’ve taken at GW have been smaller ones. More full-time faculty would decrease class sizes and give students an opportunity to interact more with their professors.
The University added 96 new professors this semester. And the strategic plan, which will be set in stone in February, proposes to hire another 50 to 100 faculty members in the next few years.
If the administration is committed to the strategic plan and improving all of the academic programs at the University, it is imperative to hire more professors for departments that need it.
GW shouldn’t forget that popularity is a good thing.

The biggest news in higher education this year has revolved around massive open online courses, known as MOOCs.
For those who haven’t heard, MOOCs allow students from across the world to take online courses and watch lectures given by leading scholars.
These courses have taken off globally. As The New York Times reported Nov. 19, “The expansion has been dizzying. Millions of students are now enrolled in hundreds of online courses.”
For months, GW has debated whether or not to jump on the bandwagon – and if so, to what extent. And Nov. 12, the administration announced that GW Law School Dean Paul Schiff Berman would step down to assume a newly-created post – vice provost for online education and academic innovation. The University has finally made up its mind: GW will enter the fray.
But it shouldn’t.
Lately, an educational arms race has emerged among some of the nation’s leading universities in the name of democratizing education by providing access to millions of people around the world. But GW is already showing up late to the party. It’s unlikely, given the millions of dollars being invested in these programs, that GW can keep up. Already, Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University have partnered with MOOC providers such as edX, Coursera and Udacity to help establish online programs at their institutions.
It’s easy to see why GW wants to get involved too. With all the hype and promises of revolutionizing higher education, the University doesn’t want to be left behind.
But we need to focus on our finances and figure out how to fund and afford these programs first, rather than just going along with the fad to keep up with the Joneses.
The University is also in the midst of several large construction projects, including the Science and Engineering Hall, the School of Public Health and Health Services and the GW Museum. With all these investments, GW has to be wary of stretching itself too thin.
The fact is, there is no clear way for us to profit from these courses. And we don’t have the resources that other colleges, like Harvard, have to invest in and experiment with them. GW’s endowment stands at approximately $1.3 billion, while Harvard boasts an endowment upward of $30 billion and MIT’s is just over $10 billion. To put it bluntly, our endowment is too small to afford to take risks like these other universities can.
And if we invest in MOOCs, there’s no guarantee that there will be any significant return on the investment down the line.
It’s a concern even University President Steven Knapp has expressed.
“You have to spend something to produce these courses,” Knapp said in an interview with The Hatchet Nov. 13. “And if you spend money producing a MOOC course that you’re not spending producing another course, and you don’t get any revenue in return, that takes away from something else you’re doing. ”
Without a steady stream of revenue coming back to the University, it’s not clear how this endeavor would ever benefit full-time students at GW.
And this model also undermines the personal interactions between teachers and students. If you think getting your professor’s attention in your introduction to economics course is difficult, try asking a question when 50,000 other students also have their hands raised.
Since online teachers aren’t as accessible, educators must ask if online instruction is really worth it if they can’t ensure that students are benefiting from it.
In the higher education world, MOOCs are in vogue. But it’s a fad that GW just can’t afford.

Students will soon be able to pay with their GWorlds at food trucks around campus, an administrator said Wednesday.
Senior Associate Vice President for Administration Ed Schonfeld said the move was in response to a letter submitted by the Student Association this week.
The University has not yet decided when food trucks will begin accepting GWorlds, and Schonfeld said details about the application process have yet to be ironed out.
“We are in the process of developing criteria for [food trucks’] inclusion in the program,” Schonfeld said. “We continually look for ways to add variety and quality to students’ dining options. We hope that food trucks help meet this goal.”
Steve Nichols, deputy director of the GWorld card program, said administrators expected the move would cause food trucks to “blow up” in popularity even more.
“Once they take the card, they’re going to be pretty successful,” he said. “We’re anticipating they’re going to be really popular.”
Most food trucks, which serve up meals like kabobs, paninis and macaroni and cheese along H Street every day, had been shut out from GWorld, causing many operators to grumble that they were losing potential student customers with campus dollars to spend.
Student Association cabinet member Ben Leighton said the plan received little “pushback” from administrators, who called it a win-win situation for students, food trucks and the University.
“It works better for students because it allows more dining programs, more competition,” Leighton, vice president for undergraduate student policy, said. “There’s already a market for these food trucks, so the University will get a little bit extra money too.”
GWorld vendors must give a slice of their profits back to the University, though officials have in the past said the amount vendors must pay for each GWorld swipe is confidential information.
A few food trucks with brick-and-mortar restaurants already accept GWorld, like the Lebanese food truck Kababji D.C., prompting more trucks to seek card readers.
In the letter, student leaders had to address concerns that adding GWorld machines would bring more food trucks to campus, hurting pedestrian safety on H Street as crowds would line the street even more. Administrators also were concerned that food truck trash would litter campus.
“When you’re not in a restaurant, and food trucks aren’t contained, trash may spread more quickly,” Leighton said.
Leighton said solutions included working with administrators to add trash cans to campus and coordinating with the Residence Hall Association to make a video about pedestrian safety.
He added that their proposals helped clear the hurdles that had caused concern about the move.
“I’m confident because there doesn’t seem to be too much opposition. Everyone we talked to realizes it will benefit students,” Leighton said.

Students no longer have to worry that their laundry will be dumped on the floor if they take more than five minutes to empty the washer or dryer.
The University’s new laundry tracking website will allow students to keep track of machines they are running and get texts from impatient hallmates who would otherwise unload the machine themselves or be forced to wait for machines to open up.
Director of Campus Support Services Nancy Haaga said all laundry rooms in residence halls that take GWorld will offer the laundry tracker, which will allow students to reserve machines online.
“These functions make it possible for students to have more control and will enhance the overall convenience of doing their laundry in the midst of their busy schedules,” Haaga said.
She added that being able to reserve a machine in advance will “ultimately save time and frustration by not hauling dirty laundry to a busy laundry room.”
The University will begin advertising the GW Laundry Tracker later this week, sending informational postcards to students’ mailboxes, adding posters to laundry rooms across campus and posting on the GWorld website. The system is run by a company called C-Bord, which is compatible with the University’s GWorld system.
The Student Association has considered creating a website to track laundry machines several times in the last few years, with former Sen. Cory Grever, U-At-Large, pushed the University to adopt a similar system, also used at American University, called LaundryView.

Since Danielle Melican started working the night shift at a New Jersey hospital, she has tried to squeeze in her GW School of Nursing class work between seeing patients at 2 a.m.
Melican, 38, became one of only three students piloting the nursing school’s online accelerated master’s program, which GW’s newest school wants to grow to bring in more students and polish the school’s appeal outside D.C.
“I’ve really been able to tailor the program to my lifestyle, which is very chaotic,” said Melican, who has five children and added that the $575 she will pay per credit was cheaper than other schools she eyed.
The nursing school, only founded in 2010, is trying to separate itself from its competition partly through a program that allows students to save time in pursuing a master’s of nursing degree by bridging it with an associate degree. The program also responds to a shortage in primary care providers, a problem that’s become especially rash in rural and poor towns.
The program, called the ADN-BSN/MSN Nursing Advancement, started as a pilot program this year and will start recruiting applicants for an expansion next month for aspiring midwives or nurse practitioners.
A 2010 Institute of Medicine report called on nurses to earn advanced degrees so they could help a medical shortage by seeing patients as nurse practitioners.
Stephanie Wright, interim senior associate dean for academic affairs, said the growing school is trying to prepare for an influx of students.
“We’re actually worried about the numbers we might get. We might get a lot, and so we’re trying to gear ourselves on how to manage that, but we don’t know what’s the truth,” she said.
The combination makes a big difference for nurses trying to help their careers, particularly in rural areas, associate nursing professor Mayri Leslie said. And the online program helps the school attract students otherwise uninterested in a GW degree by allowing them to watch lectures online.
Students work from their homes and only come to GW three times during the program: once for orientation, once for pre-clinical testing and then for a final testing and graduation. Through a partnership with GW, credits that students earn toward their associate degree at community colleges can be applied to a University program once they’ve completed requirements.
Most nurses in these areas have a two-year associate degree but it would take them six years to get their master’s.
Melican said the program still needs some improvements and should be using more social media for the students performing medical training from a distance.
“You’re sort of isolated at times, and if we were able to talk essentially more freely to one another, it would really help the program and get rid of the sense of isolation,” she said.
The nursing school, which houses its 116-student bachelor’s program on the Virginia Science and Technology Campus, could also forge partnerships with other rural Virginia community colleges next year to help students combine work on lower degrees with advanced degrees in the program. It started a partnership in March with a community college in Alleghany County, Va.
The program also leans on one of the nursing school’s strengths: its online reputation. Administrators touted its No. 1 rank in faculty credentials and training from U.S. News & World Report’s inaugural rankings of online graduate programs this year.
The school has kept growing overall, with a 100-student jump in graduate enrollment two years ago, a program that is almost entirely online. Undergraduate enrollment, filled with students who typically live off campus and in Virginia, also inched up this year after doubling two years ago.
“Our goal at the beginning was to offer a high-quality online experience for the students. So we have worked very hard at making that happen, because online education sometime gets a bad rap, because there are a lot of people who do it and don’t do it well,” Wright said. “We knew that it could be done well.”

The University will pull the Indian restaurant Aroma out of J Street after fewer than two semesters – marking the third venue swap at the dining hall in the past six months.
GW’s dining head said Aroma’s sales have fallen short this semester, and the University plans to replace it with more of J Street’s signature pay-by-the-pound salad and side dish options.
The change comes as a result of a Student Dining Board survey of more than 700 students that revealed J Street fails to attract upperclassmen, with just 17 percent of sophomores saying they would stop there if hungry, compared to 58 percent of freshmen. 
Freshmen are required to spend $700 per semester at GW-run dining halls, a stipulation that also applied to sophomores until last fall. Director of Campus Support Services Nancy Haaga maintained that J Street’s overall sales semester were strong, boosted by this fall’s addition of Auntie Anne’s Pretzels, though she declined to release sale numbers.
“The feedback we received confirmed what we already knew,” Haaga said.
Chair of the Student Dining Board Michael Morgan said the survey, the first of its kind, would become a regular method to gauge student opinion of the dining hall.
About 30 percent of students who responded to the survey said they wanted more traditional American cuisine options in a hot bar.
Haaga also said the Metro Diner – which was new to J Street last year and is now open the most hours out of any other venue – has also let down the office this semester. And after the University switched up the menu this summer, expanding self-serve hot bar options and upping its marketing efforts around campus, it still lags behind Haaga’s expectations.
J Street’s hot bar faces competition from Whole Foods, which opened last fall with a popular pay-by-the-pound bar that offers similar types of food.
To save the cornerstone of J Street’s overhaul in fall 2011, Haaga will oversee another reworking of the diner’s menu over winter break. The office could scrap the diner’s hot bar, which was added over the summer after students complained of long waits for grill items.
Morgan said his committee will work to turn the venue into “the American diner students want to see on campus.” He said he wants to add a hallmark item, like a special burger or sauce.
But Morgan said the most important information they received from the survey was that students can’t get past J Street’s poor reputation.
“The food that they put out is very high quality. That has not broken through to the student population,” Morgan said. “We’re going to focus on getting the students to appreciate the quality of food they see at J Street.”

About $86,000 of student organizations’ cash, or about 9 percent of the total budget, went unused last year, Student Association leaders said this week – pointing toward the need for a more efficient allocations process.
SA leaders said the pileup of surplus funds – roughly on par with past years’ despite intensified talks with campus groups to better utilize SA funding – demonstrates the need for reform. SA President Ashwin Narla and Executive Vice President Abby Bergren have charged a committee of six senators and six students outside the SA to spend next semester brainstorming ways to improve budgeting.
The effort comes on the heels of a referendum last month, in which students voted to increase the SA fee and double the organization’s budget to $1.75 million over the next nine years. Student leaders said the fee increase was necessary to supplement a budget that sees more than $3 million of requests each year from GW’s over 400 groups.
Narla said the joint committee could recommend changes like increasing the student fee at the pace of inflation or allocating funds differently depending on the type of organization.
“Everything is on the table when we go to these committee meetings,” Narla said. “The best way to reflect is to bring in outside opinion. [The SA’s finances] involve every student here.”
But SA finance chair Alex Mizenko said he doesn’t see a need for change in the system despite criticism that the allocations process for not having enough structure.
“As finance chair, I am going to defend the system of allocations we have now,” Mizenko said, adding that the finance committee would have to approve any of the group’s recommendations and hinting at a potential clash between the senate and executive branches.
Mizenko said the allocations process is not to blame for the rollover, and that recurring problems, like organizations saving money for events that end up not happening and organizations over-requesting funds, cannot actually be avoided.
“We try to handle that through checking in with groups to see if they’re spending the money. If they don’t, we take money away,” Mizenko said. “But you can’t really force organizations to spend every cent they have, even though that’s what they are supposed to do.”
He added that he and Vice Chair Ryan Counihan will not serve on the committee because it would be a conflict of interest, although other members of the finance committee will.
The finance committee will use the additional money to bolster its co-sponsorship fund, which is allocated throughout the year after funds are allocated in the fall. Initial allocations typically dole out about 85 percent of the SA’s budget. With the rollover, the co-sponsorship fund will be about $216,000.
Mizenko said there was a mix of groups that had leftover money but declined to provide the breakdown because he said “after talking with some people, we decided it would not be best to give out the list. It’s private information to see how much is left in each account.”
Rollover from the previous year’s allocation is one of several criteria considered when the finance committee doles out funds, along with group membership and “prestige,” Mizenko said
