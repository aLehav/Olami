Before Maude LaBelle transferred to GW this fall, she said she had never heard of the Mount Vernon Campus – and then it was her home.
LaBelle, a sophomore, is one of about 150 transfer students – including her twin sister Sophie – who were assigned housing on the University’s second residential campus this year as part of an effort to unite the transfer student community. Last year, about 50 transfer students lived on the Mount Vernon Campus.
But after just one semester living in Clark Hall, a small, three-floor building of freshmen and transfer students, the LaBelle sisters moved to Foggy Bottom, dissatisfied with transportation and lacking a sense of community.
“Every single one of our friends transferred off the Vern,” Maude LaBelle, who now lives with her sorority in the Phi Sigma Sigma townhouse, said. “The building is completely dark.”
Seth Weinshel, director of GW Housing Programs, was not fazed by the trend of students leaving the Vern halfway through the academic year, but he emphasized the fluctuating nature of housing assignments. Weinshel declined to provide a figure for how many students moved off the Mount Vernon Campus this year or how many of those students had recently enrolled at GW.
“Transfer students are assigned where space is available throughout the GW inventory,” he said. “During the fall, space was available on the Mount Vernon Campus. During the spring, space was available throughout both campuses and transfer students were assigned throughout the inventory.”
GW Housing Programs has no plans to change its approach to placing these students next fall. Under existing housing policies, transfer students are not given a choice of housing assignments like other undergraduates, but rather receive spots across both campuses depending on availability and the timing of their relocation to GW.
This year, the reopening of Lafayette Hall drew freshmen to Foggy Bottom, shifting 100 more transfer students to the Vern. Next year’s options for transfer students will again depend on the housing preferences and the overall student population.
The housing department is in the process of finalizing placement options for next year before the online iHousing portal opens Thursday.
The LaBelle sisters, who transferred from Chapman University in Orange, Calif. last fall, echo perennial complaints from Vern residents who feel disconnected as most social events take place on Foggy Bottom.
“If I would have known that I wasn’t going to be on the Foggy Bottom Campus, I wouldn’t have transferred here,” Sophie LaBelle, who now lives in Francis Scott Key Hall, said.
When asked if GW was taking steps to increase programming for transfer students living on the Vern, Colby Moss, community director on the Mount Vernon Campus, and Tim Miller, director of the Center for Student Engagement, declined to comment.
“The way we have approached transfer students has been drastically different than you would find in first year halls, as transfer students do not require the introductory skills typical of a student new to GW,” University spokeswoman Jill Sankey said on their behalf. “Instead we have focused our efforts to transition transfers to our campus by mentorship and connection with our house staff.”
Ahmad Mustafa, a senior who transferred to GW and is the Student Association’s director of transfer students, is currently reaching out to disgruntled transfer students who were placed on the Vern, with the goal of creating an online sounding board.
“Transfer students are sometimes overlooked in terms of housing,” he said. “Sometimes they get stuck in situations they aren’t comfortable with.”

The University will launch a sustainability minor this fall – the first program of its kind to cut across school boundaries and be housed in the Office of the Provost.
In conjunction with the undergraduate minor, five new green-minded classes will be offered this fall, including the first-ever course to be taught by a team of professors based in different schools.
“I get excited about new ways that we teach students. In the past, we have been held back by an institutional structure that did not encourage interdisciplinary teaching, but having schools working together in this way has been extremely exciting,” Forrest Maltzman, senior vice provost for academic affairs and planning, said.
Provost Steven Lerman said he hopes interdisciplinary work among schools will serve as a model for future programs, including entrepreneurship and security studies.
Similar to other minors, the sustainability program will require 18 credit hours, with a minimum of six credit hours completed outside a student’s home school and discipline. Lerman said the University hesitated to make sustainability a major, citing concerns that the field is most useful when paired with another practical subject.
Students who complete the minor will be required to take one class from each of three tracks: environmental and earth systems; society and sustainability; and policy, organization and leadership. Developing interdisciplinary studies is a focus of the strategic plan that will lay out the University’s academic priorities for the next decade, Lerman announced Feb. 10. The Science and Engineering Hall, which will open in 2015, will be home to collaborative lab space to encourage cross-disciplinary research.
“A sustainability issue is never isolated within a particular sector: the corporate sector, the public sector, the NGO sector. And it’s never isolated in terms of science or policy, so it was a natural fit,” Director of the Office of Sustainability Meghan Chapple-Brown said.
A 23-member sustainability committee comprising faculty from nine of GW’s 10 schools contributed to the development of the minor after the Board of Trustees challenged University leaders to “think big about sustainability” last spring, Lisa Benton-Short, associate professor of geography and the program’s first academic director, said.
“We think it’s a pretty innovative way of introducing students to sustainability and one that will appeal to students across different schools and disciplines,” Benton-Short said.
Students will also be tasked with completing an experiential learning project, including research, study abroad or internships.
The culminating experience will provide students with real-world applications of their sustainability knowledge, Chapple-Brown said. She cited a 2011 study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that found demand for sustainability-educated graduates will increase significantly in the next decade.
Introduction to Sustainability will be taught by a team of professors from different schools within the University, who will each discuss a sustainable issue from their discipline’s perspective during different class periods. The inaugural section of the class is capped at 100 students.
This is the first time nationwide that a sustainability course will be taught this way, Beanton-Short said, citing research conducted by the Office of Sustainability this summer.
All of the courses included in the sustainability minor have a green leaf designation, indicating that they address issues in social, economic or environmental sustainability.
Since fall 2010, about 60 green leaf courses have been marked at the undergraduate level. An additional 30 existing classes are awaiting confirmation that they meet the required green leaf sustainability focus, Benton-Short said.
To expand classes within the three tracks of the sustainability minor, the University will award four $2,500 grants to faculty to develop new green leaf courses to launch in the fall.

Candidates have shelled out top dollar for campaign materials in hopes of securing the Student Association’s highest post.
Four out of five presidential candidates spent an average of $918 over a two-week period this year – 44 percent more than candidates last year – excluding the low-spending outliers in both campaigns and falling just below the $1000 out-of-pocket limit set by the Joint Elections Committee.
Last year’s eight presidential hopefuls spent an average of $638.
Ashwin Narla, the second-highest spender among presidential candidates, said the high financial stakes reflect the passion each candidate has for his campaign.
Narla said Tuesday at the GW Student Media Debate that he spent $920 on T-shirts, posters and palm cards – expenses he anticipated when he kicked off his campaign.
“When we’re planning out our expenses, we’re not trying to outspend the other candidates. We’re just trying to use our money efficiently,” he said. “We don’t want to spend $900 if we can get our materials for $500.”
John Bennett, chair of the SA Senate Finance committee and a contender for president, said he has spent $975 on his campaign in a “ramped up” version of the strategy he used to run for the U-At Large SA Senate seat last year, choosing this year to add T-shirts to his purchases.
“I don’t think having an extra 100 posters will change the turnout of the election,” Bennett said.
Two years ago, the highest-spending presidential candidate did not win the seat. Jason Lifton beat out Xochitl Sanchez for the SA’s top seat but spent $180 less on his campaign.
A “normal campaign,” Lifton said, would require students to dish out at least $400 or $500 to pay for posters, T-shirts and palm cards, but he said reaching the cap is unnecessary.
This year, Benjamin Pincus has defied traditional campaign expectations by spending just $56.50 to print 30 posters of his portrait so students could recognize him on campus. He opted not to print palm cards or buy T-shirts.
“The idea that the only way you can win is spending money for a student election is absurd,” Pincus, who is pointedly running a nontraditional campaign strategy, said.
“I don’t know how people get that much to spend on a two-week election,” Pincus said.

The School of Media and Public Affairs will add two undergraduate research awards next fall named after retiring professors Jarol Manheim and Christopher Sterling.
The school will offer a Manheim-Sterling research prize to an undergraduate in each of the school’s two majors – journalism and political communication – as part of the University’s broader efforts to widen the pool of money for students with research ambitions.
“I’m hoping that this is something that will be able to grow over the years. This constitutes true growth [for the school],” SMPA Director Frank Sesno said. “Anything that we can do that encourages and helps students do more independent work I think is great.”
Sesno said the school will announce individual prize totals later in the year. A specific fundraising goal for the one-time prize has not yet been set, he said.
Students who earn the prizes will work on research with a faculty member, present an academic paper at a conference or work abroad on a reporting project, Sesno said.
The awards will become the school’s first in-house research funding that is available to students in both majors.
While the school’s main undergraduate research prize – the SMPA-Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting student fellowship – offers a student the funds to investigate an underreported news story abroad, the Manheim-Sterling awards will include the research-focused political communication major.
Efforts to boost undergraduate research across GW have been spotlighted this year by Provost Steven Lerman, who added $100,000 to the University’s undergraduate research pool, with about one-third going toward students and the remaining two-thirds serving as matching funds for faculty.
Paul Hoyt-O’Connor, director of the University’s Center for Undergraduate Fellowships and Research, said experiences provided by undergraduate research are ones that students “can’t get elsewhere.”
“Undergraduate research is more than just sitting in a classroom. It is a high-impact experience, allowing students to delve more deeply into their disciplines and appropriate their own learning,” he said.
Hoyt-O’Connor said schools at GW typically offer their own undergraduate research awards, but communication and marketing of the prizes need to improve.
Columbian College Dean Peg Barratt said the college as a whole is looking to improve its advertising of student research opportunities, focusing especially on reaching out to “the real go-getter freshmen.”
“We want to put this on students’ minds earlier and try to have faculty on the lookout for students who could be developed into somebody who has an independent research project,” Barratt said.
Manheim and Sterling, the award’s namesakes, accepted the University’s 2010 voluntary retirement offer to the longest-serving faculty members of Columbian College.
Manheim, the founding director of SMPA, joined GW in 1987 and led the development of the political communication major. He specializes in strategic political communication and has written several books on the subject.
When he was an undergraduate, Manheim said a professor mentored him in his own research project – a process he learned was instrumental to motivating students.
“In a way, it is probably the reason I followed the career path that I did,” he said. “I learned a lot about independent thinking, time management and, of course, the research process, all focusing on the excitement of actually having my own research findings.”
Sterling, who joined the GW faculty in 1982, penned a journalism encyclopedia with contributions from SMPA professors and graduate students three years ago.
While not every student wants to focus on research, Sterling said finding students who do is rewarding.
“Learning about the process and being able to do it is excellent experience for so many career paths,” Sterling said.
Sterling will continue his roles as the Columbian College’s associate dean for special projects, which he began in July, and as an adjunct professor, teaching graduate classes in SMPA as well as in the Trachtenberg School of Public Policy and Public Administration.

Time travel is a normal occurrence for a group of on-campus thespians.
The cast of “Hair,” the GW Department of Theatre and Dance’s production of Broadway’s edgy tribal-rock musical, has spent their semester spanning two eras, living in both a modern world and one of cultural revolution.
The show, once groundbreaking on Broadway for its racially-integrated cast, chronicles the lives of members of the “tribe,” a group of young hippies in New York City confronting sexuality, drug use, protests and military conscription amidst the counterculture of the late 1960s. The show originally opened off-Broadway in 1967 before moving across town to debut under Broadway lights in 1968. The show experienced widespread fame, defining the genre of the rock musical and continuously running for 1,750 performances.
The GW version, directed by the Smithsonian’s Discovery Theater Director Roberta Gasbarre, with assistance from senior Ed Churchill, features a cast of more than 30 performers dressed in era-inspired costumes, and even showcases an authentic, vibrantly painted 1970s Volkswagen van adorned with draping beads. The vehicle was the director’s own before becoming an authentic “Hair” prop.
“There is something very unique about this era, because there wasn’t as much technology or access to information as we have now. The hippie movement seems to be a sort of cultural defiance that just couldn’t happen today,” said Jamar Brown, a University of Maryland graduate and guest performer playing the role of Hud, a tribe member “representative of black males in America” during the time period.
To familiarize them selves with the era, the cast and crew undertook extensive research efforts on bohemian culture.
“From day one, we’ve been reading books and watching documentaries [on the time period]. We’ve also been having a really amazing time comparing it to what’s going on socially now, with the Occupy movement and the war,” senior Ariel Warmflash, who portrays Jeanie, the young, pregnant matriarch of the tribe, said.
Brown sees the Vietnam war as “the one that sort of changed the idea of battle lines,” setting the standards by which the current war on terrorism is measured today. He sees similarities of war mongering and deceit between the dissidence then and the frustrations felt now.
While some components of 60’s culture were familiar to the cast and crew, the show’s principal actors were often placed outside their traditional comfort zone in depicting a tribe that approaches drug use, mild nudity and social eccentricity with nonchalance. Their research couldn’t prepare them for every new topic breached.
“Listening to Jimi Hendrix, The Grass Roots and Eric Clapton – that wasn’t a stretch for me. But putting myself in that [time period] was a stretch,” Warmflash said.
Throughout preparations, sophomore Sam Game, who plays Berger, the tribe’s rebellious, bohemian leader, began to notice the show’s relevance to the social, political and economic climate of today.
“The late 60s were a time when a lot of people were really angry with what the ‘establishment’ or the ‘man’ was doing to them, the postwar economic boom had ended so there were a lot fewer jobs, and there was a very unpopular war, all like there is now. The only difference is that people acted a lot more readily,” Game said.
The cast aims to not only emphasize themes of self-identity and social revolution, but to also discard traditional typecasts of the bohemian lifestyle.
“We have this stereotype now of hippies with colored glasses, long hair and bandanas, but there were people who actually did this, and they believed very adamantly in what they were doing and why they were doing it,” Game said.
“Hair” is presented by the GW Department of Theatre and Dance in collaboration with the GW Department of Music. The show will run Feb. 23, 24, 25 and 26 in the Dorothy Betts Marvin Theatre. Tickets are $10 for students and $15 for adults.

The amount of family problems plaguing the cast of the classic “Antigone” could make even the most dysfunctional modern family look saintly.
Generic Theatre Company reenacts this salacious Greek tragedy where the young female protagonist Antigone defies her family and kingdom, plaguing the herself with deadly consequences.
Antigone tries to arrange a respectable burial for her brother, when Creon, the ruler of Thebes, orders Polynices to be buried on the outskirts of their city where his body will be eaten. She attempts to bury Polynices herself, but Creon’s guards foil her plot and capture the young heroine.
In a twist of fate, Creon offers to overlook her discretions, but Antigone refuses the repreive.
The version the troupe chose to adopt, written by Jean Anouilh, debuted in 1944 during Nazi occupation of France. The adaptation opened under Nazi censorship, but Anouilh slipped in identifiable parallels to French resistance and Nazi occupation.
Despite the wild scenarios and serious moral dilemmas, both the cast and audience said they forged a connection with the story and the heroine’s tribulations.
“I continued going back to reading it, and every time I did, I liked it more and for all the different various reasons. I think I chose to do this piece, because it’s one that consistently, no matter what position I find myself in, I find myself identifying with it,” director TJ Billard said.
Sophomore Samantha Nesfield, who plays the fated heroine Antigone, felt the play was relatable and that it had an added value for a GW audience.
“I think that it has a lot of emotional catharsis,” Nesfield said. “People need to be in touch with the tragic side, not just sad but something that’s genuinely tragic.”
To forge such an emotionally relevant and relatable production, the cast developed roles that were often extremely different from their own personalities, something director Billard says he struggled with.
“If you can create a clear image of the character, even if it’s separate of yourself, it’s easier to become them,” Billard said.
For the more villainous characters, it was about building a role based on what he calls a “paradigm” or “exemplar” of their character and then pretending to take on that persona.
“For this show, you have to make them aware of parts of themselves that they do not notice on the day-to-day basis,” Billard said.
Billard stripped down the traditionally elaborate sets and costumes, which match the complicated plot of the show, to instead create a performance with only the most crucial necessities.
In the original production, the set includes walls, doors and furniture changes, often accented by imagery of Nazi rule or French patriotism. None of these political symbols will appear in this version, in an attempt by Billard to create a more modern and relatable version for college students.
“I took away the set, and I made the audience intentionally more aware of the fact that they are watching a show, so that you can be engaged in the moments where the actors’ emotions are at their highest and you empathize with them. But at the same time, you’re reminded that you’re watching a show, and so you step back and you look at it critically,” Billard said.
The 12-member cast says they feel the effects of Billard’s struggle to create a close environment.
Spencer Frenchman, a senior who plays Creon, described the need to capture a character with a persona so different from his own as a big challenge, echoing his director’s struggles.
“Certain aspects of the character, like when I am supposed to be enjoying how evil I’m being and enjoying the cruelty…that was kind of hard to develop,” Frenchman said.
The Generic Theatre Company’s production of “Antigone” debuts Feb. 23 through 25 in the Lisner Downstage.

This year’s candidates for Student Association president each demonstrated clearly defined character and a sense of priority.
The choice ultimately came down to two exceptional candidates, and deciding whom to endorse required us not only to look back over their endorsement hearings, platforms and debate performances, but also to consider which traits we value most in a student leader. To that end, The Hatchet’s editorial board endorses junior John Bennett for Student Association president.
Bennett is a truly impressive candidate with a long history of student advocacy and a generally comprehensive plan for arriving at his goals. His platform strikes a healthy balance between tasks that can be quickly achieved and those that require a year’s worth of advocacy, and, more importantly, he has the strategy to accomplish both.
His plan to get SA senators more involved and motivated by including them in upper-level advocacy efforts is a smart response to the SA Senate’s typical apathy. It also speaks to his own high-impact term as SA finance chair this year, during which he reformed the financial allocations process and notably kept open dialogues with the many student organizations on campus by holding well-attended town halls.
We are confident Bennett would be able to negotiate the University bureaucracy to push his agenda and make the right connections to achieve his goals. Not only does Bennett have the knowledge of campus issues, but he knows how to apply it. His plan to revitalize Columbian Square, for example, which includes bringing in new furniture and making the area more inviting, is an efficient short-term response to the current lack of student space. This could provide next year’s student body with improved community space while he continues to lobby for his long-term agenda to secure a student hub. When pressed on the infeasibility of a point of his safety and security platform, he was willing to be flexible on its details as long as student safety did not suffer.
Bennett’s performance during the student media debate didn’t simply exemplify the success he’s had in his current role as SA finance chair. When posed questions about student life issues that weren’t mentioned on his platform, such as how to ensure that campus groups are accepting of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, he responded with a smart and effective solution by suggesting involving major student organizations in Safe Zone training.
But we worry that Bennett is not willing enough to ask for the counsel of the students whose votes he seeks. There is no denying he has a huge ego, and while this might fuel a tenacious students-first lobbying agenda, he must make it clearer that he would continue to seek student input.
If elected, we have confidence that Bennett would bring about important change during his one-year term.
Ashwin Narla has made frequent communication with the student body the focal point of his campaign. Often, Student Association executives become so entrenched in their efforts that they lose sight of the students they are serving, but Narla’s strong, students-first platform and plans to hold frequent “State of the Campus” updates reassures us that he would keep his ear to the ground and maintain dialogue with his peers. Narla’s attitude about the sort of chief lobbyist he would be is one of the greatest strengths of his platform. He asserts that he wouldn’t just work with administrators as one student taking on the University, but also, through his outreach, he would mobilize the student body to be involved in initiatives and lobbying efforts.
Student space is a principal campus issue, and Narla has a clear focus to acquire an area that would serve as a student union. He said the Multicultural Student Services Center townhouse could serve as a model for an ideal community space, and we see this as a smart and attainable goal if he relentlessly lobbies for it.
That said, Narla’s platform comes off at times as too dependent on his passion, and it lacks a clearly outlined method. If elected, Narla must take the time to develop an even more comprehensive and detailed plan for how to achieve his platform promises. We were very impressed by his fervor and charisma during his endorsement hearing – he certainly has the magic – but during the debate, it became clear that his platform lacks serious substance beyond plans for frequent student outreach. There is a huge difference between having charisma and being able to carry out a platform. While he couldn’t be expected to speak to certain issues with as much savvy as an SA insider, we were disappointed he wasn’t able to address student issues unrelated to the SA with much substance.
Narla’s infectious personality and commitment to improving student life would make him an excellent lobbyist. We were disappointed to find that his platform wasn’t developed enough to match the strength of his passion and desire to lead the student body.
Jeremy Iloulian was a clearly knowledgeable candidate with a variety of innovative reforms for day-to-day student issues. His career services plans are a creative fix, and his understanding of the initiatives already in motion shows he would capitalize on that trajectory and advocate for even more student-focused reforms in the field. His method for gathering student concerns – by holding town halls that are co-hosted by the SA and specific student groups or schools – is a wise revision to the poorly attended town halls the SA usually holds.
Iloulian was able to showcase his impressive resume and list of accomplishments through his strong debate performance. This gives us confidence that he has the tools to be an effective lobbyist for students.
But Iloulian’s call to allow members of Greek life to self-adjudicate is a concerning one, as all students should be subject to the same set of regulations and enforcements. This policy goal is such an egregiously poor idea that we can’t help but worry he hasn’t thought through the rest of his platform thoroughly.
Will Thompson made a notable effort to demonstrate his commitment to building strong relationships, which we also believe is key in effective lobbying. His platform drew attention to a number of innovative issues that would have otherwise gone unaddressed during this campaign.
But Thompson’s ideas are not fully developed, and many of the changes he pledges to achieve have already been enacted, such as his desires to improve alumni connections with students and to limit construction noise early in the morning.
While it is important to distinguish oneself from the other candidates by having a variety of campaign goals and identifying unique platforms, latching onto issues that have already been addressed or are in progress does not make for the strongest lobbying strategy.
Ben Pincus’ platform reads more like one for executive vice president than president, and even when pushed on his goals, he remained exclusively committed to calling for internal reform to the SA Senate’s financial allocations process. His goal of increasing financial allocations transparency would require him to usurp power from the future SA finance chair and executive vice president – power we suspect neither person would be willing to cede.
Pincus demonstrated little knowledge of campus issues aside from SA reform, and when pressed on what else he would pursue, his responses were ambiguous at best. Pincus’ sole plan for SA reform would require effort over the summer and the first weeks of the school year, and we can’t help but think that if elected, he wouldn’t serve as an advocate for real student issues after that time.
You have a number of candidates to choose from, but there is only one who can provide real results as next year’s SA president. Vote John Bennett for SA president.

A new shuttle bus service will give passengers a $5-ride across the National Mall starting March 12.
Rides on the new transportation service – announced by the National Park Service Friday – will be discounted to $1 during this year’s Cherry Blossom Festival, from March 20 to April 27.
The shuttle’s regular route will span from Union Station to the World War II memorial, the Lincoln Memorial, Arlington Cemetery, the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial and the Smithsonian Metro stop before returning to Union Station.
It will pick up visitors at Hains Point, near the Tidal Basin, during the Cherry Blossom Festival.
National Park Service spokesman Bill Line said more stops could be added to the route, depending on public response to the shuttle. He said the $5 service – which will be funded through the fare – fills a void in transportation options on the Mall created after the group Tourmobile, which stopped operating its $32-tour service last October after holding a contract with the park service for about 40 years.
The Trust for the National Mall, a nonprofit launched in 2007 to foster public-private partnerships to improve the grounds, announced Monday that the park received a $1 million donation from John Akridge, its founder and chairman, for improvements to the grounds. It has aided programs including increased recycling and energy-efficient lighting on the Mall.
Caroline Cunningham, president of the trust, said the donation is the starting point for a campaign to raise $350 million to support the Mall’s restoration and upkeep with private funds.
“We encourage people to get involved to make the park a beautiful and sustainable place,” she said.
The Mall is undergoing a number of maintenance projects, including the restoration of the reflecting pool near the Lincoln Memorial that began in November 2010, with a targeted completion of the end of the year.
Lin said a time frame is unknown for when the Washington Monument will reopen after it shut down following an earthquake in August.
