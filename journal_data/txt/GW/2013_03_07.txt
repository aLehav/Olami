Rumors percolated around campus Monday evening that the University Police officers inspected Ivory Tower, Potomac House, Thurston, Fulbright, Munson and Madison halls, Townhouse Row and The West End.
But that didn’t happen. At least not in its entirety.
The truth is, UPD only conducted inspections in two residence halls. In the Alpha Epsilon Pi townhouse on 22nd Street, a drug bust resulted from a routine health and safety inspection. And in Thurston, officers responded to the odor of marijuana in the hallway.
The record has been set straight – but it took two days after the events took place. The University did not release any communications to address students’ concerns regarding what types of searches were happening across campus. And when a small piece of information was released, it was unclear and failed to answer major questions.
It’s standard practice for health and safety inspectors to examine campus housing twice in the fall, once in the spring and once in the summer.
For the most part, students know the drill: A health and safety representative does a visual check to see that smoke detectors are intact, prohibited items such as extension cords are not present and that students haven’t snuck pets inside. Officials leave a tag on the door to indicate that an inspection occurred if the resident isn’t there.
University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard said Tuesday that the inspections Monday night were routine.
For nearly two days, the most tangible piece of information available to students came from the campus crime log which indicates that Monday evening, UPD busted students for drug law violations at 605 22nd St. and in Thurston Hall. UPD Chief Kevin Hay eventually responded for comment, but it took nearly two days.
That means for two days, students were left largely in the dark, left only with questions that circulated on Twitter, Facebook and across listservs about whether UPD officers would enter their rooms as part of alleged “raids.”
Some suspected that the University had broken room inspection protocol while conducting sweeps in fraternity housing. And while officials say that was false, the widespread panic among the student body should have been quelled earlier. It is unacceptable that the administration did not release information earlier to calm the barrage of rumors.
If the University had been up front with students and stated that there were only two busts in specifically targeted areas, tension would have quickly dissipated. It is the University’s job to dispel rumors and tell students what is going on.
UPD itself is not a transparent institution. Records are closed. Officers wield the authority to arrest and enforce the rule of law – but there is little room for public oversight. Though commissioned by the Metropolitan Police Department, UPD operates at a standard of secrecy.
In such circumstances, it becomes even more critical to maintain an open dialogue with the community and provide information.
UPD blatantly failed in that duty this week.
Campus police exist to create a sense of safety and security. But in this case, UPD did more to incite panic and concern than mitigate it.
The days-long silence that followed only perpetuated a feeling of distrust.

In the wake of internet pioneer Aaron Swartz’s suicide after illegally downloading 4.8 million journal articles from the online database JSTOR and the federal government’s decision Feb. 22 to make all taxpayer-funded federal research available to the public within one year of publication, it is clear that open access to information is a national issue.
This situation has increasing importance for colleges and universities as the cost of academic materials continues to rise. As communities charged with educating and preparing the next generation of American leaders, it is critical that GW and its professors shape this national debate by siding with open access.
It’s up to universities like GW and their faculty to play a role in making research available outside academic circles so society can benefit from new knowledge and discoveries.
There are a number of obstacles that prevent universities like GW from providing free access to information, including publishers of academic journals and university professors themselves.
Unfortunately, publishers maintain a virtual monopoly on information.
And price-fixing on the part of the publishing industry has made an impact on colleges and universities across the country.
Even Harvard University has felt the high cost of information. According to a memo released by the Harvard Faculty Advisory Council last April, the two most expensive journals have increased the price for individual access to articles by over 145 percent over the preceding six years, prompting the traditionally plutocratic college to call the pricing situation for academic journals “untenable.”
If Harvard – with an endowment of more than $30 billion – is feeling the constraint of journal costs, then imagine the financial hardship for a university like GW, with a comparatively paltry endowment of $1.3 billion.
Daniel Chudnov, director of scholarly technology at Gelman Library, said the problem is one that GW will have to contend with in the very near future.
“The pressure to pay more and more when we know that the biggest publishers are reaping very high profit margins…something’s gotta give,” he told me.
The inevitable question is how colleges and universities should move forward. Some responsibility falls on publishing companies, which must stop increasing their costs. But realistically, that probably won’t happen anytime soon.
The answer must come from professors, some of whom are hesitant to put their research online for free.
“Most professors have careers, and they are trying to advance in their careers. And that includes getting tenure. Where they publish is very important, and they are always looking to publish in selective journals,” Charles Garris, an engineering professor and chairman of the Faculty Senate Committee on Professional Ethics and Academic Freedom, said in an interview.
Traditionally, the tenure system rewards professors who publish frequently and looks skeptically on the idea of open-access scholarship.
Information that can be acquired and proliferated at little-to-no-cost is viewed as being somehow inferior, though there  are thousands of open-access journals.
But if the purpose of higher education is to empower as many people as possible with knowledge, making information free is something professors have a responsibility to do.
“There’s nothing inherently wrong with publishing for profit. But it’s limiting our options dramatically and restricting our ability to share information back on our campus,” Chudnov said.
Tenured professors must make a concerted, coordinated effort to make more of their research free and open to the public at large.
For many in academia, this might be an unwelcome culture shift. But increasing access to information can only benefit researchers by sharing the results of their painstaking work with a wider group of readers.

I’m in my fourth year as a columnist, so I’ve been asking students what they think are the biggest issues on campus for a while now. And the responses I’ve gotten most consistently? Low school spirit. Lack of community. GW doesn’t have a football team.
It’s a tough issue to tackle, but on the opinions page, in conversation with friends and across campus, people are trying to turn around this so-called lack of University affinity. They’re trying to invigorate campus with a sense of identity reminiscent of big state schools, while simultaneously touting everything that makes GW, well, GW.
But so often, those two goals have been in sharp contrast, to the point of falling flat or feeling contrived.
I’ve found that GW is a school that prioritizes the micro over the macro. People nationwide are told through the University’s rebranding campaign that GW produces great leaders, a message that speaks to the ambitions of individual students here.
Students measure their pride in achievements in student organizations – or even more alienating, in collecting internships – and not in the University as a whole. We don’t lack school spirit – it’s just more localized.
Both my parents and my older sister went to big, sports-focused state schools, so I grew up around people who experienced a very different college community than I have. Their identity first belonged to their college, and everything else, from majors to student organizations, followed far behind.
And whether we’re looking at our family members or our high school friends who go to larger schools, at some point or another we’ve all found ourselves asking, “What makes GW different?”
When I ask students why they believe school spirit is low on campus, the responses range from “the University is too bureaucratic” to “everyone just wants to talk about politics” to “J Street is not all-you-can-eat” and “there’s no football team.”
But changing any of those things wouldn’t really fix our school pride problem. And solving the puzzle that is GW’s lack of community goes much deeper than being more welcoming to non-politics students – the University already is. And as for starting a football team again, well, that’d be a terrible idea.
In fact, it often seems as though students simply love to hate on GW.
Last year, GW was recognized in a Unigo survey as one of the top 10 colleges with the happiest students in the country, a sign that spirit here might be high. But the ensuing shock expressed across Facebook and Twitter seemed to call into question that survey’s authority. As someone who has genuine pride in her school, I found it disheartening to see this recognition being fiercely attacked by so many of my fellow students.
But the message the University puts out, and the one students quickly adopt, seems to portray each student as a traveler on an individual journey to political stardom, investment banking glory or the theatrical role of a lifetime. GW is a place where students carve out their identities individually or in small groups and do not have to latch onto less personal communities, like the greater University.
Indeed, not everyone feels this way. I have tremendous respect for the community members who show up to every basketball game, talk about “raising high” and attempt to promote a sense of spirit in others.
But there aren’t enough of them to say that the culture here is one of strong school pride.
Maybe GW just isn’t a place where buff and blue pulses through our veins. Maybe we need to stop thinking there is only one way we show school identity. GW is a place to grow as individuals. Maybe it’s time we embrace that.

There was no second-half comeback this time.
Earlier this season, down 20 points against La Salle, the Colonials embarked on a 19-4 run that cut the lead to five and gave the Smith Center crowd a reason to hang around.
On Wednesday night, in the final road game of the season, GW wasn’t so persistent. The game finished just as the last against the Explorers ultimately did, with another mark in the Colonials’ loss column. This 84-70 defeat has a heightened impact for the Colonials, with only one conference game remaining and the team’s A-10 tournament status still hanging in the balance.
GW must beat Dayton Saturday to make it to Brooklyn.
“It’s just hard to come back,” head coach Mike Lonergan said, “when you’re not making open shots and you’re missing free throws.”
Up 10-9 early in the first half, it appeared GW might be able to hang with the third-ranked team in the A-10. That wasn’t the case, though.
La Salle turned up the heat, storming ahead on a 19-4 run and leaving the Colonials wondering if they would make it to playoff basketball. Igniting and bolstering La Salle’s run was the nights’ one-man wrecking crew: Explorers’ senior guard Ramon Galloway.
“You try not to let the best player beat you, but he definitely hurt us tonight and had a great game,” Lonergan said.
Galloway finished with a game-high 29 points on 11-of-17 shooting, giving GW’s defense fits the entire night.
But for the Colonials, he was just the beginning of their problems, with the inability to find an effective defense proving to be most fatal.
“We played a man-to-man defense to start, and we just didn’t guard the three point line well,” Lonergan said. “They were going by us and kicking it for threes, and we weren’t doing a good job guarding the threes, so we called a timeout and got out of that.”
Nothing was getting the job done. When GW went to man, La Salle’s guards had no trouble blowing past them to the basket. The easy points led to 61 percent shooting for the Explorers on the game.
When the Colonials switched to a 1-3-1 zone, the Explorers showcased their spot-up shooting. Despite coming in with the game plan of limiting La Salle’s long-range attempts, GW just simply left too much space for the lethal shooters.
At the end of the half, the Explorers had made 10 three-pointers – compared to only one for GW – and would go on to record 12 treys in the game. Trying to get a head start on a much-needed comeback, GW began to claw away at La Salle’s lead over the end of the first. A jumper here and a lay-up there gave the team some momentum, but a Galloway drive or outside three constantly put another speed bump on the team’s road back.
With one final possession left in the first, the lead was down to eight, but a déjà vu floater by La Salle guard Tyreek Dyren put the margin back up to double digits.
“They were playing for the last shot, and their guy fumbled the ball and I thought one of our guys could’ve dove for the ball,” Lonergan said. “But they just stood there, and he picked it up and hit a shot at the buzzer. So it was a big momentum killer.”
In the second half, GW just couldn’t get the lead below double digits, accomplishing nothing more than trading baskets with the Explorers. The team certainly had its chances, able to get the ball inside, but blown lay-ups and turnovers led to the eventual 84-70 loss.
One bright spot in the game was GW’s performance on the glass, outrebounding La Salle 28-17, but that was expected with the small four-guard line-up that the Explorers like to suit up. And the Colonials again struggled at the free throw line, going 5-for-10 in the game and failing to get to the free throw line in the first half.
Senior forward Isaiah Armwood used his height advantage inside to lead the team with 18 points and 10 rebounds. Also scoring in double-digits were freshman guard Kethan Savage, who used a strong first half to put up 12 points, and senior guard Lasan Kromah, who made the lone three-pointer for GW and finished with 15 points.
This loss certainly increases the difficulty of the Colonials making it to the A-10 tournament, but their fate is still in their hands.
“We gotta win Saturday.  It’s like a one-game season,” Lonergan said. “I guess Duquesne was winning, but then lost in overtime, so we didn’t get any help there. So basically we’ve gotta beat Dayton.”

The Bar Bro brings you the best dives in the District. He isn’t classless – just low-class.
During a fresh-air – or really, smoke – break on a bar patio this weekend, my friends and I stood around a tall, metallic space heater chatting with a man who was clearly from out of town.
“When did they start serving PBR at bars?” he said, flicking ash off his Kansas Jayhawks sweatshirt.
I tried to explain.
“People started drinking it ironically, and as dive bars around the city have become hipster bars – ”
“Don’t say that word to me, man,” he said, removing his baseball cap to brush his hair back underneath. “Why do they have to jack up the price of my beer?”
I didn’t have a good answer for that.
Where? 3114 N. 10th St., Arlington, Va.
Cover? No
Carded? Yes
Happy Hour? Weekdays, 4 to 7 p.m.
He told us he was from Colorado, and that back home, he was used to buying girls $1 beers and shooting 50-cent pool. I told him that if he wanted the coveted combination of cheap drinks and no hipsters, he’d have to head out to the ‘burbs.
What I neglected to tell him was that he wouldn’t find what he was looking for there either.
There are two types of bars in the District that people prominently designate as dives: small, grimy hipster meat markets and sleepy, local watering holes. I tried out one of each last weekend, and each had something to offer.
The patio we were on, surrounded by walls covered in illegible graffiti and spray-painted M.C. Escher rats, belonged to the Velvet Lounge, a dive-y staple of the U Street corridor. Enter late on a weekend night, after a band is done playing upstairs, and you’ll find throngs of young, hip urbanites grinding in the dark, searching for one last chance to get laid that night.
Where? 915 U St., NW
Cover? Prices vary for concerts upstairs. Downstairs is no cover.
Carded? Yes
Happy Hour? No

The night I was there, the DJ played dancehall, reggaeton and all manners of heavy-beated music that made the hipster girls in white tank tops shake their hips while boys with mustaches held their coats. I had several mustachioed men of my own – on cans of Natty Boh – which only set me back $3 at the bar.
If you get there early, you can pay a small cover and catch a concert upstairs. Watching a show here was like watching your friend’s band play in an attic – loud, intimate and full of people you’re not sure you should talk to. Bars with hipster cred should be grimy – one Yelp reviewer wrote that these were the best bathrooms in the District to throw up in, although I’m afraid I didn’t test her theory. They should be a little rowdy, with people making out in practically every corner. This is fun.
But this one failed to live up to the Kansas fan’s expectations, or mine, frankly. No dive should offer a $6 can of Brooklyn Lager like the Velvet Lounge does.
Could I find that same grimy charm without the sort of contrived hipster coolness that has seemingly spread to every cheap, downtown bar? I ventured out to the ‘burbs to find out.
I was a little worried getting off the Clarendon Metro that I hadn’t gone far enough. Walk from the station down the main drag, and the bars remind you of the trendier places on the H Street Corridor. Fancy signs hang over establishments with enormous glass facades and one-word names. This is where Arlington yuppies come to drink.
But walk a ways down and you’ll find Jay’s Saloon & Grille, a house-turned-watering hole that bills itself as “one of Arlington’s last true dive bars.”
The walls of this buzzing but not overcrowded bar are adorned with little homages to the Nats and, for whatever reason, the Kansas City Chiefs. The TVs above the bar must be from 1986, and a small ramp from the main dining area leads down to what must be the world’s smallest pool table.
Nothing about this place is pretentious; the same waitress who took our food order went down and unstuck the pool table for a group of trucker-hatted guys and their girlfriends every time they wanted to play another game. Domestic drafts, and by that I mean Bud, Miller or Coors, were $3. “Premium” brews, like Yuengling, are $3.50. The food is cheap and satisfying. Most sandwiches run in the $7 range, are big and hearty, and come with fries, chips, tater tots or perfectly sweet and salty onion rings. The “wine list” has two entries: red and white.
When it warms up, and Jay’s opens its AstroTurf front patio, I imagine I’ll probably spend a night there with my friends, ordering pitchers of beer and watching cars go by through a crisscrossed wooden fence. And I’ll be happy.
Well, almost. Because for all of its Southern charm, Jay’s is a little too sleepy for a 22-year old who came here to live in the city. And despite its familiarity, I don’t know how often I can frequent a neighborhood bar a Metro trip away.
Both bars are undeniably fun, and relatively cheap if you do it right. Still, when it comes to dive bars, no one in this city gets the recipe perfect. The best we can possibly hope to do is to try everything and see what we like.

The University’s top safety officials said searches of several residence halls across campus Monday were regular, scheduled inspections that led to drug and alcohol busts in a Greek townhouse, and happened to overlap with another in Thurston Hall.
Officers found marijuana and alcohol Monday during “routine” health and safety inspections at the Alpha Episilon Pi townhouse, located on 22nd Street, Senior Associate Vice President for Safety and Security Darrell Darnell said. He said after inspectors found the illegal substances, they called in officers to conduct an administrative search around 2:30 p.m.
Officers also investigated reports of a “suspicious smell” that led to an administrative search in Thurston Hall around 9 p.m., University Police Chief Kevin Hay said. He said it had no connection to health and safety inspections, which take place once each spring in every hall.
Students were reported to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities in both cases, not to the Metropolitan Police Department, according to the crime log.
Hay said no health and safety inspections took place after hours, and no other drugs or alcohol were confiscated during inspections or administrative searches Monday. He added that an officer was called in to unlock a residence Monday, but did not participate in the inspection.
“GWPD officers do not accompany Health and Safety inspectors on inspections,” Hay said in an email.
Hundreds of tweets, Facebook posts, and fraternity and sorority listserv emails fueled rumors Monday and Tuesday about residence hall “raids.” Dozens of students reported that the room searches were in connection to a list obtained by UPD from a student suspected of dealing drugs.
Asked about widespread drug-related searches, Hay said, “This simply did not occur,” and reiterated that officers were only involved the Thurston Hall case.
President of Alpha Epsilon Pi Nate Kropp said “nothing improper was found in AEPI controlled areas.”
“As you are probably aware, health and safety inspections of individual students’ rooms have no bearing on our Chapter so it would be inappropriate for me to comment on such a search in 605 22nd Street, just as it would be in any other University housing facility,” Kropp added in an email.
Two students said they saw officers searching the Alpha Epsilon Pi townhouse on 22nd Street between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. The students, who asked to remain anonymous, said officers left the building carrying four boxes with some bongs and pipes visible.
A routine inspection led to an administrative search Friday in West Hall, revealing multiple fraudulent identification cards, marijuana residue and two electric stun guns.

The power to send intoxicated students to the hospital rests with emergency responders at other colleges – not campus police, as is the case at GW, according to a Hatchet analysis.
University Police officers, who are certified in first aid and CPR, make the final call to send students to GW Hospital after field sobriety tests and Breathalyzer exams. At other schools with EMS units, only emergency responders make medical judgments.
“We call EMeRG in when we determine that we think they’re bad enough to go to the hospital, because we’re worried about their health,” UPD Chief Kevin Hay said. “Our goal is to make sure that no one dies from drinking 15 shots of vodka. That’s what we’re out to prevent.”
Last year, 75 percent of alcohol-related transports at GW resulted from UPD officers or house staff members stopping intoxicated students.
About a third of EMeRG’s about 900 on-campus calls listed alcohol as the primary cause last year. That rate that has dropped since 2010, when 36 percent of calls were due to intoxicated individuals on campus.
And while EMeRG is on site as officers make the final decision, the group’s coordinator said UPD officers override crew members – who are licensed District EMTs with months of training in at least basic life support – to enforce the University’s alcohol policies.
“EMeRG providers do not influence the officers’ decision to require someone to be transported to the hospital for intoxication,” EMeRG coordinator Stephen Gerber said.
But Michael Hilton, director-at-large of the National Collegiate Emergency Medical Services Foundation, said police should not make decisions about whether patients should be sent to the hospital. Volunteers in EMeRG, part of the national organization, act on behalf of the District’s medical director like other certified EMTs.
“In terms of a purely medical decision, if you don’t have the medical training, it doesn’t make sense to be making medical decisions about patients in the field,” Hilton, an EMS physician, said. “It’s probably not a best practice for a police officer to make that determination.”
UPD officers check students’ blood alcohol content twice through breath tests, but do not exclusively rely on that measure, though Hay said it is key in the decision to send an individual to the hospital.
“That’s going to be a big red flag for me because we don’t know where it’s going to top out,” Hay said, adding that his officers consider the “totality of circumstances.”
He said that under D.C. code, UPD officers handle intoxication as a public health problem, rather than a criminal offense.
Hay said that the department uses field sobriety tests, breath tests and horizontal gaze nystagmus tests, which involve moving an object horizontally in front of the person’s face. The latter test, according to the National Highway and Safety Administration, is accurate in 77 percent of cases.
“EMeRG relies on the officers’ assessment of when someone is too intoxicated to care for themselves,” Hay said. “The officer is determining whether or not the patient can provide consent for treatment.”
Rochester Institute of Technology and Georgetown, Penn State, Syracuse and Tulane universities have emergency response teams similar to EMeRG. At each school,
EMT medics determine whether a subject is in need of hospital care after coordinating with doctors via radio or phone. The schools’ rate of alcohol-related emergency calls are about 30 percent, similar to the GW rate.
Patients can only refuse transportation if EMTs determine that they are sufficiently alert, cognizant and display no signs of significant intoxication – even if they’re underage, Tulane’s EMS director Bijan Rizi said.
“Officers have no input in whether a person is transported,” Rizi said. “They’re not allowed to make any medical decisions.”
Georgetown’s Emergency Response Medical Service, known as GERMS, maintains a low threshold for advising hospitalization and urges patients to seek further medical assessment.
One sophomore, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is underage, said UPD officers dispatched EMeRG to transport him to the hospital after a Breathalyzer exam revealed a 0.14 percent blood alcohol content.
He passed a field sobriety test but was still transported to GW Hospital, where doctors gave him a cup of grape juice.
The University’s “good samaritan” policy grants disciplinary amnesty to students who seek out emergency care for friends even if they are underage and have been drinking.
More students have taken advantage of the policy over the last three years, with the number of calls rising to 33 percent of alcohol-related transports from 22 percent.
In 2009, sophomore Laura Treanor died from alcohol poisoning, prompting the University to launch a review of alcohol policies and better inform students how to recognize when their friends are dangerously intoxicated.
Raw EMeRG data doesn’t show the full picture of liquor-linked incidents at GW. About a third of calls were tallied as alcohol-related over the last three years, but other incidents in which students are unconscious and intoxicated are logged as “unconscious person” and not under the “alcohol” category, University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard said.
And while more than three-quarters of EMeRG patients were transported to a hospital over the last two years, the service does not track the number of intoxicated students taken to the emergency room for care, as it does not document category-specific outcomes, Sherrard said.
A student scribe in GW Hospital’s emergency department said doctors and nurses have expressed frustration with the University’s alcohol transport policies. As a scribe, she sees most patients as they enter and exit the ER for treatment, and she works alongside medical practitioners. She asked to remain anonymous because she is not authorized to speak to the media.
“When someone is really very drunk and needs acute care, then obviously that’s not a source of frustration,” she said. “But when kids come in and they’re mostly fine, except that they’re just a little bit drunk, it is frustrating to some of the providers.”
GW Hospital spokesman Steve Taubenkibel declined to comment on alcohol-related admissions, costs and care in the ER.
The scribe recalled instances involving underage patients with very low blood alcohol contents, such as the case of one freshman who she said UPD officers sent to the hospital with a BAC of 0.02 percent.
Intoxicated patients who do not need serious medical attention, like stomach-pumping or an IV fluid, are monitored by nurses and physicians, handed a cup of water or juice and asked to sit on a bed for a couple of hours, she said.
Angelo Salvucci, an emergency room physician in Santa Barbara who serves as medical director at two county EMS services in California, said hospitalizing intoxicated individuals opens up the opportunity to refer them to counseling services, if needed.
“If they’re drunk to the point where EMS is called on their behalf, then that’s an early sign of a substance abuse problem,” Salvucci said.

Funneling into a spare Duques room for a seven-hour beer- and pizza-fueled brainstorming session, an assembly of graduate students scribbled notes on whiteboards, vigorously vetting out each other’s ideas.
With a month to go before their May 2012 graduation from the GW School of Business, the five friends were determined to release a product to leave their mark before embarking on separate business endeavors.
They created GONO, set to release in Apple’s app store in mid-March. The survey application allows users to publicly or privately submit polls to friends and other app users to receive instant, interactive feedback.
GONO’s founder and co-creator Todd Butler said the app was inspired by the idea of girls mass-messaging their friends to determine whether an outfit choice is a hit or a no-go.
“People nowadays more than ever care about what society thinks. With social networking bringing the world closer together, everyone is very aware of their social presence,” Butler, a 2012 graduate, said. “So when it comes to buying something or picking something out, people love to get the feedback of their closest friends.”
The program, which can be accessed via the phone app, email or online, allows users to send two contrasting photos or a “yes or no” question to a mass audience, be it a selected group of people or all GONO users.
The responses are then presented in graphs, displaying instant public sentiments via polling.
“You can totally picture frats and sororities using this to be like, ‘Which beer should we buy?’ But we also can see this being hijacked by so many different demographics, whether it be about politics or just something fun,” Butler said.
The free app also allows advertisers to present surveys to public users as well, funding the app’s development.
Because the program is framed around poll responses, users may unknowingly respond to ads, a quality Butler says is both unobtrusive to users and beneficial to companies seeking focus-group-style feedback on their products.
“This app represents the solution to mobile advertising. There’s nothing sneaky about it. Someone is putting out a public survey – it’s just from a company instead of a person,” Butler said.
For 2012 alumnus and GONO co-founder Sachin Anand, spearheading public survey technology offers advancements beyond GONO’s social, interactive format.
Anand, who teaches an online new media strategies course at the University of Virginia, said that despite the convenience of the online class format, it makes it harder for him to ascertain student feedback. He called polling technology in a real-time format beneficial to his course.
“It’s not easy to poll students in real time and to gauge student sentiment of where they are in the class and if they can understand the topic,” Anand said.
As the presence of social media increases, Butler said an aptitude for coding is an ever more valuable commodity in the business world.
He said this cultural shift might alter business school students’ approaches to entrepreneurship.
“I think it’s one of those things that has replaced a lot of the MBA’s mind-sets in terms of the old brick-and-mortar, ‘I’m gonna go out and start a business and change the world’ mentality,” Butler said. “It’s more of, ‘Let me find something really creative that’s a niche that I can create in the basement of my house and launch it.’ ”
Butler also noted that business school programs are adapting to the expansion of technological and app-related businesses.
While some users may pose deliberately trivial questions – in the app’s beta phase, for example, Butler posed a poll pitting Nicolas Cage against a sponge for the “best actor” superlative – Butler hopes to devise an app that is ultimately useful to a mass market.
Sophomore Josh Dingus, GONO’s marketing intern, touted the app’s versatility in reaching a range of audiences and purposes.
“You can have your friends put in input, which is extremely valuable. But you can also just use it to take pictures of things that maybe you think are funny and share them. I think it’s also an extended version of something we have now, sort of like Instagram,” Dingus said. “It’s extremely malleable in that sense.”

The 24-year-old law student who was found dead in his New Jersey home Dec. 20 died from an accidental overdose of heroin and Adderall, according to the state’s medical examiner.
Third-year law student John Hroncich died from “acute intoxication due to the combined toxic effects of heroin and amphetamine,” more specifically Adderall.
Adderall is legally prescribed to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but substance abusers also use it to counteract the effects of heroin so they can take more of the illegal drug, director of the National Capital Poison Center Cathleen Clancy said. That practice, caused by the combination of stimulant and depressant drugs, is known colloquially as “speedballing,” she said.
“Either can cause you to die in different ways, but both can cause you to die,” said Clancy, who is also an associate professor at the School of Medicine and Health Sciences.
Clancy said a person’s lethal dose of heroin depends on his or her history with the drug.
“When you start delving into street drugs, this is a huge problem,” Clancy said. “You’re exposing yourself to very potent chemicals and you don’t really know what dose.”
Excess fluids in Hroncich’s lungs deprived his body of oxygen, according to his autopsy report, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, an adverse reaction associated with heroin use.
Hroncich would have received his law degree in May. Law school interim dean Gregory Maggs said last month at the student’s on-campus memorial that the school will recommend to the University that he receive the honor posthumously.
He earned his undergraduate degree in economics and political science at Rutgers University, finishing off his last three semesters there with a 3.93 grade point average.
Hroncich was remembered as an easy-going friend, brother and son committed to academics and driven to pursue a career in cybersecurity law.
“It was a surprise to all of us,” his father, William Hroncich, said last week. “This was a huge tragedy to the family.” He added that the family had not yet received an autopsy report from the medical examiner’s office.
Friends at the law school’s memorial service called him “Jersey Johnny,” and said the late student used to joke that he had more Amtrak points than Vice President Joe Biden because of how often he visited home.
Hroncich’s death comes one year after graduate student Benjamin Gupta died from a mix of alcohol and oxycodone, a prescription pain reliever. The 28-year-old JD and MBA candidate died in his sleep on Dec. 19, 2011.
Provost Steven Lerman wrote in an email that GW has “no plan to review the circumstances surrounding this tragic death, which occurred far from our campuses and during a University break.”
The University conducted a review and altered its alcohol amnesty policy in 2009 after sophomore Laura Treanor died from alcohol poisoning in Ivory Tower, pledging to step up its education about the dangers of drinking.
Deaths from drug overdose in the United States quadrupled from 1999 to 2010, according to a report published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last month.
The report showed that nearly 60 percent of drug-related deaths in 2010 involved prescription drugs, and three-quarters of those deaths involved opioids such as oxycodone and morphine.
