A panel of media experts discussed journalists’ culpability in facilitating and perpetuating the Iraq War just a few days after the 20th anniversary of the war Wednesday.
Reuters National Security Correspondent Jonathan Landay, Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft Senior Advisor Kelley Beaucar Vlahos and Jewish Currents’ Editor-at-Large Peter Beinart discussed media’s role in war and peace. The Quincy Institute, GW’s Institute for Middle East Studies, The Nation magazine and the political podcast Breaking Points sponsored the event, which was moderated by Krystal Ball, the host of Breaking Points.
Landay said he and his writing partner Warren Strobel won the Raymond Clapper Memorial Award in 2003, a prestigious journalism award, at the now-defunct media company Knight Ridder for their work about the invasion of Iraq and how former President George W. Bush’s administration sold the war to the American public.
“I would wake up at night, two o’clock, three o’clock in the morning, after we’ve run one of our big stories refuting the administration’s case on the intelligence or the alleged link between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda and bin Laden, and wonder, ‘Why are we the only ones out there doing this?’” Landay said.
Beinart said the ethos of American exceptionalism – the idea Americans are essentially good and their enemies are bad – contributed to the U.S. government’s decision to start the Iraq War and other American military interventions like the Afghanistan War and Vietnam War.
“We don’t have enough people in important positions of the media, who, when they think about the history of American foreign policy, they think about America’s toppling of democratic regimes all over Latin America and the Middle East, Africa,” Beinart said.
Vlahos said while writing for Fox News at the time of the war, she found fellow conservative journalists unwilling to question and criticize the Bush administration for fear of alienating readers with unpopular reporting.
“They were really closing ranks, as they say, about this, and that was really disturbing to me,” Vlahos said.
Vlahos said the influence of a few corporations over mainstream media risks dominating journalism today with a single, convenient narrative.
“It’s going to be difficult when you have all of the mainstream media owned by six conglomerates,” Vlahos said. “And they have different incentives and different interests, and it’s called money and shareholders and it’s not about journalistic integrity.”

CLRE will provide a $3,000 housing credit for community engagement advisors to reside in “assigned” first-year residence halls with a roommate of their choice.
Campus Living and Residential Education officials are looking to hire student community engagement advisers and community engagement assistants in first-year residence halls for the next academic year.
In an effort to aid community coordinators, CLRE is seeking student community engagement advisers who will live in first-year residence halls and community engagement assistants to organize social programming and support on-campus residents. The positions will be paid an hourly salary of $17 for 10 to 15 work hours per week and are open to rising sophomores, juniors and seniors, who can apply until March 29, according to an email from CLRE officials Tuesday.
“We are looking for GW students who want to make a positive impact in our first-year residence halls,” CLRE officials said in an email.
Community engagement advisers will organize events for freshmen students to meet, identify residents’ issues and help facilitate the roommate agreement process at the beginning of the academic year. CLRE will provide a $3,000 housing credit for community engagement advisors to reside in “assigned” first-year residence halls with a roommate of their choice.
Officials are inviting students to apply for two community engagement assistant positions – a programming and community-building role that will mediate roommate concerns and agreements and a community services and support role that will design residence hall lobbies and bulletin boards.
The opening of the community engagement advisor and assistant student positions comes after officials eliminated GW’s residence adviser program in February 2021, transferring counseling, safety and on-call responsibilities to community coordinators because of concerns about the “complexity” of the duties.
Officials will notify applicants to schedule interviews by April 1 and conduct interviews from April 3 to April 5. Officials will ask applicants who were offered positions to attend a “Group Process” session on April 8, according to CLRE officials.
Officials said community engagement advisors and assistants will be required to return to campus on Aug. 11 for position training.
Officials held information sessions for the positions Tuesday in the Thurston penthouse lounge and Thursday in the District House first-floor lounge.

The battle over Foggy Bottom’s future is coming to a store near you – literally. While GW touts its ties to the District, the relocation of the GW Campus Store to 2100 Pennsylvania Ave. has become the latest flashpoint in a community defined both by and in opposition to the University.
The new, 16,000-square-foot retail space inside 2100 Penn will include a rotating event space, a children’s book section and an area to highlight local artisans, setting the venue above and beyond its current location in the basement of the University Student Center. But local community groups are using planned modifications to the building’s design to argue the Campus Store doesn’t belong in 2100 Penn altogether.
Before the Campus Store can open this fall, GW and real estate firm Boston Properties want the city’s approval to install a wider “The George Washington University Campus Store” sign above the building’s I Street entrance and eliminate the store’s 21st Street entrance. While the West End Citizens Association and Foggy Bottom Association have objected to these requests, the battle over the building isn’t ultimately about aesthetics. If it were, Boston Properties and GW’s decision to shrink the sign before the Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission voted to approve the project 4-0 earlier this month should have placated their critics.
Instead, this debate between neighborhood residents and the University in their backyard is about the gap between the needs and wants of the local community and GW – and how both understand 2100 Penn. The modification is hardly more than a facelift to the University, while residents believe it’s a violation of zoning regulations and a sign of GW’s dominance over the neighborhood.

While the new Campus Store is clearly retail, it’s not the “new community-oriented retail,” like a grocery store, dining venue or child care facility, that Foggy Bottom and West End residents were hoping for – or that WECA contends must occupy the space. In a letter submitted to the D.C. Zoning Commission Friday, a law firm representing WECA alleges the city approved 2100 Penn’s construction to create retail space and attract new businesses to the neighborhood – not another outpost for GW. If that was the plan from the beginning, the Campus Store would alter the building’s purpose and benefit to the public and necessitate a public hearing where the Campus Store’s opponents can raise their larger concerns before the D.C. Zoning Commission.
For their part, officials and Boston Properties have argued changing 2100 Penn’s design doesn’t fundamentally alter the building project as a whole. And though the Zoning Commission’s initial approval for 2100 Penn’s construction mentions various types of uses the retail space might fulfill, it was never a mandate that precluded GW from relocating its Campus Store in the future.
Nor is it unreasonable to assume that officials intended to use the location for a new Campus Store from the outset. The University owns the land 2100 Penn sits on and has worked with Boston Properties in the past. Anchoring the space with the new Campus Store is a mutually beneficial investment that gives the University a marquee retail space and buoys the building’s financial future with a major long-term tenant, even if – as the community’s negative reaction to the project shows – there are hoops to jump through.
Residents’ demand for changes to the project and their opposition to the Campus Store itself are hardly surprising given the history of disagreements between the University and the surrounding neighborhood. Local groups have sparred with officials over the construction of the GW Hospital in the 1990s, threatened to sue the University over its campus plan in the 2000s and spent years debating the construction of a helipad at GW Hospital in the 2010s.
The truth is that what best serves GW doesn’t always help its neighbors. So it’s understandable that they’re unwilling to take the University at its word, especially since there’s no guarantee the aforementioned event space, children’s section and selection of products from local artisans and artists will come to fruition.
All the same, the new Campus Store is undoubtedly an improvement over its current location for students and the University. For one, more retail space that isn’t tucked away in the bowels of the student center means it’s more accessible. And if the Campus Store opens as planned with a technology store with Apple products, a GW Information Technology help desk and other features, it’ll be far more than a place to take your parents or stock up on supplies at the start of the semester.
But for the Campus Store to be truly successful – and earn the trust of residents – it needs to benefit the neighborhood just as well as it does GW. Officials already know how to operate University spaces that cater to the broader community, like the Lerner Health and Wellness Center and Gelman Library. Even if it’s adorned in GW regalia, the Campus Store should be a place where residents feel welcome. The store’s community-focused features, like the rotating event space, children’s book section and “made-in-D.C.” selections, should be at the core of the store’s experience, not a gimmick to run a profit or soften opposition to the project.
As of right now, a vacant storefront plastered over with posters doesn’t make I Street a bustling thoroughfare, enliven the neighborhood or give the University a return on its investment. So the sooner the Campus Store opens, the sooner officials can execute their concept for more community-oriented spaces within the location.
The Campus Store is a far cry from a grocery store or day care, but perfect shouldn’t be the enemy of good – or even mediocre. Officials’ plan deserves the go-ahead, just so long as there’s room for the local community amid a sea of Buff and Blue.

John Prokop received a bachelor’s degree in journalism from GW in 1962 and graduated from GW Law in 1968.
The 10 options officials initially selected for GW’s new moniker – Ambassadors, Blue Fog, Catalysts, Fireworks, Independents, Monumentals, Revolutionaries, Sentinels, Squad and Truth – were a “pick your poison” list. Last week, officials narrowed the 10 to four final options – Ambassadors, Blue Fog, Revolutionaries or Sentinels. When they select one of these names, GW will have missed a golden opportunity to choose an effective moniker.
These monikers did not offer anything you would really want to or could easily identify with – they do not indicate what GW is or who its students are, and they encounter the same problems of the “Colonials” they are meant to replace. Whatever their intentions, revolutionaries can engage in violent activity. The term’s connotations mean international students from countries undergoing political upheaval may not always look upon the moniker favorably, just as students found Colonials and its association with violence “extremely offensive” toward Indigenous people and people of color.
Like Colonials, Ambassadors, Blue Fog and Sentinels are difficult to portray in a graphic and as contentious sports opponents. College students need to identify with a formidable-yet-fun figure to express their intent to overcome rival teams. A ferocious animal like a bear would make a better moniker than Ambassadors, Blue Fog, Revolutionaries or Sentinels. They immediately convey a formidable message – “Don’t fool with me!” The bear lived in all 13 colonies and was an animal that George Washington would have encountered. How about the Buff and Blue Bears?
As a student, I worked on many a float for parades before major athletic events – usually football back in those days – which traveled down G Street to pass before the judges who sat in front of the old student union. We were all proud of GW, of being GW students and displaying GW spirit, but we struggled portraying Colonials to effectively appear as a formidable opponent to Georgetown’s Hoyas and their bulldog mascot.
We were neophyte amateurs working with limited resources, volunteers and time. You want the easiest path to conclude the job – but to win, it must look good. For us, it was easier to brand our float with “GWU” than “Colonials.” I favor short, evocative or symbolic words in logos and on signage because you can fit a large four- or five-letter word in a smaller space than one for a 10- or 12-letter word. A large four-letter can be seen from a greater distance than longer words with smaller letters.
You have only a limited time to get your message across in visual communication, so you must do so quickly and effectively. And “GWU” is one of the most recognizable names and really a moniker in itself. It stands up there with UCLA, for the University of California, Los Angeles, as easily and clearly identifiable.
It would be hard to find any one or two words that could convey all of the messages the committee set out for the monikers – that GW is “tenacious, ambitious, resilient,” “electric, energetic, charged,” “open, approachable” and “diverse.” As words, Ambassadors, Blue Fog, Revolutionaries or Sentinels cannot demonstrate how GW strives for success, bursts with excitement and passion or welcomes new people as much as new experiences, ideas and ways of thinking. GW’s core values are more than one word or one enlightened theme slogan, and perhaps the criteria were so formidable that they discouraged people from attempting to find the one word that would convey all or even a part of them.
GW’s new moniker should be short, and the shorter the moniker, the easier it is to understand and merchandise. For example, “Hoyas” with a picture of a bulldog instantly says Georgetown University, and “Bison” signals the strength of Howard University. An instantly recognizable moniker can help sell the University on all levels whether on posters, T-shirts, sweatshirts or all sorts of other paraphernalia. But how will the moniker work on an athletics level? Saying “the Ambassadors won a tough one” would be better than cheering on the “Truth.” But the media, including the sports press, will continue to use the more recognizable “GW” in headlines instead of the generic “Ambassadors.”
When I emailed my idea for the Buff and Blue Bears to officials, I got the impression, but no explicit statement, that they desired a more demure moniker – no animals, weapons or warriors but maybe Revolutionaries. Officials definitely did not want “Hippos,” and they ruled that option out in January. The choice of the moniker was almost a foregone conclusion, and the decision-making process has been a performative effort to raise alumni and student interest while staving off criticism that they were not involved.
I do not mean or intend to disparage the work of the volunteers and professionals who are employed in this effort – I think they are working hard and have some good concepts, and no one said this was going to be an easy job. But we should not hinder the University with a moniker that is not symbolic of GW and is difficult to portray. Each student and alum should be proud to identify with the moniker. Alas, these “pick your poison choices” fail in all respects. I applaud the effort, but GW, we could have done better.

While President Joe Biden’s student loan debt forgiveness plan stalls in litigation due to claims of executive overreach, college students like me can’t afford to wait for relief.
Biden announced his plan in August to relieve up to $20,000 in debt per borrower by the end of 2022. But in November, six states – Iowa, Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and South Carolina – asked the Supreme Court to block the plan, which they argue is an abuse of executive authority. The Supreme Court’s review of the plan has halted debt cancellation for millions of students and graduates just before they received their checks, leaving Americans like me anxiously anticipating my financial future.
College is an investment, but the debt that comes with loans is a nightmare for college students, especially when it’s unavoidable for most of us who enroll. About 43.5 million people are in student loan debt in the United States, where total unpaid loans piled up to about $1.757 trillion by the end of 2022.
As a low-income student, financial aid was a major part of my decision-making process for selecting which college I would attend. While I was ecstatic about getting into the University of California, Los Angeles and the University of California, Berkeley, the prospect of attending a private institution like GW actually turned out to be less expensive. The financial aid packages from UCLA and UC Berkeley would require me to take out roughly $15,000 and $20,000 of respective loans per year to attend.
When I gained admission to GW, it wasn’t the letter of acceptance that made me cry but the financial aid package they were offering. College finally seemed like a very real possibility. It wasn’t a full ride, but I would not have to take out $20,000 in loans each school year thanks to the scholarships I received. I ended up taking out $10,000 for my freshman year, making it financially possible to attend college.
I most likely would not have attended a four-year university if not for GW’s financial aid package. After my mother’s death, there were many other financial priorities – car payments, utilities, taxes – that demanded my attention more than school. I was scared I would have to take out more loans and end up in debt if I went to college when there were other major expenses in my life.
Higher education has become a lot more expensive than it used to be, especially in the United States where tuition is twice as high as the world average. The average college tuition in the 2000s for a four-year public university was around $5,088. Today, that would be around $9,349.
But this is even happening at our own University. GW has raised next year’s tuition by 4.2 percent from $62,110 to $64,700, its highest-ever price, as the cost of attendance exceeds $86,500. I will have to take out at least another $5,000 in federal loans next semester to keep attending the University – so much for the $15,000 a year in debt I tried running away from when I rejected UCLA and UC Berkeley. So whenever I complain about school, I remind myself that I might not always be financially able to attend GW.
My family members have had to stretch their dollars further because of the rising prices, making it more difficult for them to contribute to my education – let alone set aside money for future student loan payments when they resume this summer. We have had to budget more and sometimes only partially pay bills and utilities. Even though inflation has eased from a high of 9.1 percent in June 2022 to 6 percent in February, food and goods are still more expensive than they were before the pandemic, eating into workers’ wages. And it doesn’t help when 32 states cut pandemic-related Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits earlier this month, forcing families like mine to pay more out of pocket for groceries.
The Supreme Court will likely decide the case concerning Biden’s student debt forgiveness plan in June. If it rules in favor of Biden and forgives $10,000 to $20,000 of debt, borrowers would not have to work so much or so often as right now. Students like me have every moment of their day scheduled between working and studying. While Biden won’t eliminate all debt – and debt forgiveness won’t make inflation go away – his plan will give people the chance to become more financially stable in the future. Instead of keeping up with debt payments, they could be saving for a bigger apartment or a car.
If the Supreme Court rejects Biden’s plan, we will be sentenced to a life of constant debt and financial instability – nothing would change despite the initial promise of forgiven debt. For many low-income students, college has been the way to close the economic inequality gap and make things a little bit fairer. College degrees would enable us to save more money, invest, release some financial stress and even build generational wealth. Now, people are skeptical about whether a college degree is even worth it. With everything becoming more expensive, the middle and working classes need help to keep up financially. If they don’t get that help – if their debt isn’t forgiven – students from lower-income families won’t better their lives when going to college leads them to financial ruin.
Whether the current plan for student debt forgiveness is imperfect or executive overreach, it just needs to happen one way or another. Students and graduates feel suffocated because of their loans, especially in a world where it feels like even breathing is expensive. Student debt relief would be just that – a breath of financial relief.

Experts in criminology said low neighborhood crime and the department’s reporting method could also explain the drop in complaints and arrests outlined in GWPD’s internal review.
GW Police Department officers received more calls for service but arrested fewer people in 2022 than in 2021, according to an annual internal review of department data.
GWPD released its third Annual Statistical Review earlier this year, showing the number of calls for service jumped to a three-year high in 2022, while the number of arrests dropped to a three-year low. GWPD Chief James Tate attributed the uptick in service requests to fewer COVID-19 restrictions on campus and students who might feel more comfortable speaking to officers. 
Tate said officers faced fewer interactions that required an arrest, but any reason for the drop in arrests beyond that is “not immediately clear.”
GWPD reported 8,178 calls for service last year, compared to 6,403 requests reported in 2021 and 5,703 in 2020. The department’s arrests fell to 15 in 2022, down from 32 arrests in 2021 and 26 in 2020, according to the review. 
“GW is a world-class institution, and it deserves a world-class police department,” Tate said. “To reach that goal, we must continue to build trust and legitimacy with our community, and that is an everyday effort.”
GWPD reported that it investigated five internal complaints about department employee conduct in both 2021 and 2022 after reporting just three investigations in 2020. 
“The five investigations initiated by the department were largely regarding policy violations,” Tate said. “We acknowledged those shortcomings and implemented the appropriate corrective action.”
The review states GW community members submitted one formal citizen complaint in 2022, one in 2021 and two in 2020 over policy violations, including rudeness, excessive force and biased policing. Tate said the one complaint from last year revealed a department employee failed to provide the level of service expected by the department.
“Appropriate corrective action was taken to address the issue,” Tate said.
Tate said GWPD conducts “random audits” of body-worn camera footage at “regular intervals,” which may be responsible for the slight increase in sustained internal complaints – officer violations that result in departmental action – from 3 in 2020 to 4 in 2021 and 5 in 2022. He said the audits allow the department to review interactions with the public, ensure compliance with body-cam policy and detect any “minor issues” before they develop into “major” ones. 
GWPD purchased body-worn cameras in August 2020 to improve relations with the student body through enhanced accountability and transparency within the department. The cameras’ rollout followed an incident where an officer pushed a student at a protest against fossil fuel funding at F Street House earlier that February.
“Footage helps us understand if we have a training issue that needs to be addressed or a performance issue that may require a combination of corrective action and additional training,” Tate said in an email earlier this month. “Either way, we address the issue.”
Complaints against GWPD officers and arrests have declined since the department released its first review in 2021, which came after the Black Student Union sent a letter to the department in June 2020 demanding officials improve relations with students after complaints of officers’ alleged racial bias. The first iteration of the report in 2021 included data from 2018, 2019 and 2020 and showed drops in complaints, arrests and calls for service after they largely peaked in the first year of data.
In an effort to lower barriers between officers and students, GWPD has started organizing community outreach events this school year, like the Raise High with GWPD meet-and-greet in September and monthly Coffee with the Chief, where students can have a conversation with Tate in Phillips Hall. 
GWPD also hired two student outreach liaisons in late February to help organize community outreach events, create infographics about GWPD activities and serve as points of contact for students not comfortable speaking with officers.
Emir Johnson, a junior studying criminal justice and a student outreach liaison, said due to one of the reforms Tate brought to GWPD, officers will only enter a residence hall room in response to an alcohol violation if “needed,” first deferring to EMeRG responders to enter the room. 
“I think that’s one of the ways that you kind of eliminate that need for police officers,” Johnson said.
Gabriela Angel, a senior studying international affairs and history and a student outreach liaison, said officers must be “accountable” so students can receive the “best service.” She said she has organized “constant” student liaison tabling events so students can feel comfortable sharing any “weird” GWPD officer experiences instead of filing formal reports.
“There are so many situations that go unreported, and that is because the student feels weird or doesn’t know how to reach out to the police or feels intimidated by reaching out to the police,” Angel said.
More than 50 percent of violent crime and about 70 percent of property crime goes unreported nationwide, according to a September 2022 Bureau of Justice Statistics report.
Experts in criminology said low neighborhood crime and the department’s reporting method could also explain the drop in complaints and arrests outlined in GWPD’s internal review.
Richard Rosenfeld, a professor emeritus of criminology at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said while GWPD’s student outreach is a “good idea,” departments should not stop at organizing community events, and officers should actively engage with the community when working or on patrol.
“The idea there is for the police to engage with students outside of situations in which the student is being treated as a suspect or as a victim of a crime,” Rosenfeld said. “On a regular basis, the police should engage with students and faculty and other staff at the University.”
Rosenfeld said he considers GWPD’s “handful” of arrests “low” on a campus of more than 15,000 students, and shrinking crime rates in surrounding communities and calls for service that primarily involve non-criminal concerns could account for the small number of arrests.
Metropolitan Police Department records show that crime in Ward 2 decreased more than anywhere else in the District last year, which Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner Jordan Nassar partially attributed to MPD and GWPD police patrols at the time. Violent crime dropped by seven percent across D.C., while property crime dropped by four percent in 2022 compared to 2021 data, MPD crime records show.
“If they’ve become safer, one would expect the same thing to happen on campus,” Rosenfeld said.
Michael Scott, a clinical criminology professor at Arizona State University, said students who must engage in a lengthy, in-person complaint process are less likely to file complaints than those who can file paperwork anonymously through their phone. Individuals can email the department to file complaints against GWPD officers.
“Some departments make it very easy to file that complaint, you can do it anonymously, you can do it over the phone, you can do it by email or text,” Scott said. “Other departments have much more stringent requirements.”

The release states the body cameras will “supplement” the 20,000 surveillance cameras officials have already installed throughout D.C.’s rail and bus network
The Metro Transit Police Department announced that officers will begin to carry body-worn cameras starting in April, according to a Friday release.
MTPD announced it will train and equip all officers, sergeants and lieutenants with body-worn cameras to “strengthen public safety and security efforts,” starting with two dozen officers in certain units later this month and expanding the devices to all 315 officers across each of MTPD’s three districts by the end of the summer. The release states the body cameras will “supplement” the 20,000 surveillance cameras officials have already installed throughout D.C.’s rail and bus network, the latest major metropolitan transit system to implement the cameras.
The department will roll out the body-worn cameras in a “staged approach,” first equipping “highly trained” officers in the MTPD’s Special Response Team and Tactical Operations Unit, then expanding the implementation to MTPD employees in D.C., Maryland and Virginia, the release states. 
The release states MTPD Chief Michael Anzallo said officials are “committed” to the feeling of safety and security of riders, employees and officers and the program is aiming to build trust in MTPD. He said similar body-camera programs in the region provided “important insights” that will inform the department’s rollout. 
“I am confident that the new body-worn camera program will continue to build trust and confidence in the department’s work,” Anzallo said.
Officials equipped transit police with body cameras in New York, Newark, Philadelphia and San Francisco in 2019, 2017, 2015 and 2012, respectively.
The release states officials will mount the camera, which has internal memory for video and audio storage and includes a “pre-recording” feature, on the “outer garments” of officers’ clothing to capture a forward-facing view. Officers are required to inform individuals the cameras are recording the audio and video of the situation at the beginning of any altercation, according to the release.
The U.S. Department of Justice awarded MTPD a $905,000 grant to support the program last June.
An MTPD officer shot a man armed with a knife at the Anacostia Metro Station earlier this month. A gunman shot and killed Robert Cunningham, a Metro mechanic, after injuring two others at the Potomac Ave Station on Feb. 1. Following his death, MTPD, Metropolitan Police Department and District officials announced they were increasing police presence on trains and buses by nearly 60 percent.
The department’s announcement also comes after Fairfax County Police Department Sergeant Wesley Shifflett fatally shot Timothy McCree Johnson, an unarmed Black man, at Tyson’s Corner Center last month. FCPD fired the officer after body camera and surveillance footage revealed he did not follow the department’s use-of-force policies, according to the Washington Post. 
“The MTPD’s Community Services Bureau will begin working to ensure customers are educated and informed around the deployment, protocols and use of body-worn cameras,”  the release states.

Compass Coffee is offering both in-store pink coffees and take-home blends to add a bit of cherry flavor to your coffee of choice.
Peak bloom of cherry blossoms in D.C. calls for celebration, but beyond the trees of the Tidal Basin, local bars and restaurants are serving floral drinks, cherry-infused desserts and Japanese-inspired dishes to commemorate the season.
Restaurants in the District are finding ways to recreate the beauty of the iconic pink trees on their own menus, whether it be through pink coloring, flower garnishes or even hand-painted frosting. We made a list of the new springtime menu editions you need to try to get a taste of that cherry blossom flavor. Debuting in March and lasting until May, take advantage of these limited-edition specials while you can.
Immigrant Food
With three locations in D.C., including one just blocks from campus, Immigrant Food is serving up a ube-infused cocktail and a sour cherry trifle for the blossoming season. The restaurant is a vibrant display of a blending of cultures from around the world, and that doesn’t stop at their year-round menu, with their cherry blossom specials pulling from the flavors of Japan.
Both the White House and Planet Word Museum locations are serving a nonalcoholic cocktail called the Okinawa Colada, a Japanese-inspired take on a Piña colada, to honor the cherry trees’ origin as a gift from the Japanese government. The drink is comprised of lime juice, nonalcoholic gin, pineapple juice, coconut milk and ube extract. All of the restaurant’s locations are serving up a special dessert option – a Cherry Blossom Trifle comprised of Genoise sponge cake, fresh raspberries, sour cherries, pomegranate ganache, cookie crumble and white chocolate topped with house-made Chantilly cream. Head over to Immigrant Food and pair their specialty menu items together for a fruity blend of cherries, raspberries and pomegranates.

Compass Coffee is offering both in-store pink coffees and take-home blends to add a bit of cherry flavor to your coffee of choice. The shop is selling its cherry blossom blend of ground coffee, a brighter and more floral version of its ground coffee using beans from Ethiopia and Guatemala for you to take home and enjoy later. Their in-store offerings include a cherry blossom cream cold brew, a cherry blossom latte and a cherry blossom Vienna topped with a heaping pile of whipped cream. The pink-colored drinks add cherry syrup to their classic menu options for a sweet, slightly tart flavor.

Sababa
This Cleveland Park Mediterranean restaurant is offering both drink and food specials that celebrate spring with rose, cherry and lavender flavors. Sababa specializes in Israeli cuisine, and this spring they have added a cherry blossom twist to their menu with floral sodas and a cherry dessert. Pair your springtime drinks and dessert with any arrangement of their small plates for a festive and filling meal.
All three of their handmade soda offerings scream spring by incorporating flavors such as rose, lemon, mint and rosemary, so choose between the pomegranate-rosehip, lavender-borage and cucumber-mint sodas for a fruity start to your meal. Be sure to end with the cherry blossom tart, made with a traditional white sesame crust that adds a savory contrast to the sweet cherry filling.

SecreTea
No need to travel far from campus to get a cherry-infused drink – head over to SecreTea’s E Street storefront. The tea shop, popular among students for its bubble tea options, has five spring-themed drinks and food menu items just in time for peak bloom.
For a small bite to eat between classes, snag a sakura mochi, a mildly sweet, light pink-colored treat made of black sesame filling and pickled sakura leaf. The shop also has four cherry blossom-inspired drinks. The Spring Wonderland is a layered pink matcha drink while the Blossom in the Cloud Generation 2 is a light, fruity dragonfruit tea with strawberry popping boba. The Pink Lady Generation 2 is a black and pink drink topped with whipped cream and made of cherry blossom flavored milk and charcoal espresso and Eden’s Garden is a pink-colored lemonade drink with kiwi popping boba. Stop by the store for a refreshing treat after your next class in the Elliott School of International Affairs.
1959 E St. NW. Open 9:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily. Find more information here.
Astro Doughnuts & Fried Chicken
Head to Penn Quarter for a hand-painted cherry tree doughnut paired with fried chicken. Astro Doughnuts & Fried Chicken specializes in two American staples, and their cherry blossom special is one you certainly don’t want to miss. Start your meal off with a taste of their famous fried chicken before moving on to a cherry jam-filled treat.
For cherry blossom season, the restaurant is providing a doughnut filled with tart, red cherry jam and cream cheese glaze. But it doesn’t stop there. The top of the doughnut is artfully decorated with a hand-painted, blossoming cherry tree. Order one – or a dozen – of these creative and delectable treats to celebrate the season.

Stop by José Andrés’ Penn Quarter restaurant for a savory take on the cherry blossoms. Jaleo is a Spanish restaurant specializing in the country’s signature tapas, paella and sangria. This season, Andrés has introduced a cherry-infused soup and appetizer to the menu.
Start with the gazpacho de cerezas, a take on the traditional cold blend of tomatoes that adds cherries to the mix. For another inventive integration of the fruit of the season, try the fried brussels sprouts with almonds, cherries and apple puree. Finish your meal with either the Basque-style cheesecake with cherries or the Turrón Cherry Times – a box of cherry and chocolate nougat – for a sweet ending note.
