Just 30 minutes after presidential hopeful Mitt Romney pledged to cut funding for public television programs in the Oct. 3 debate, two Muppet fans more than 1,000 miles apart hatched an idea to save the shows.
Los Angeles producer Michael Bellavia and Idaho college student Chris Meacham separately planned demonstrations to save the children’s programs, and began to coordinate after discovering each other’s website and Facebook page for the Million Muppet March.
After a month of coordinating through social media, the pair met in person for the first time Nov. 3, joined by more than 700 colorfully clad public broadcasting supporters.
Supporters gathered in Lincoln Park and marched to Capitol Hill, shouting, “No puppets, no peace” and “Give felt a chance.”
Most wore puppets and many dressed up as Sesame Street characters, carrying signs that read “Elmo wants equality, not binders.” Dozens of Big Birds held signs like “Flip the GOP the bird” and “Keep your Mitts off me,” referring to the Sesame Street character Romney assured audiences he supported, despite his intent to cut funding to the program’s benefactor, the Public Broadcasting Service.
The demonstration culminated in a Twitter campaign, with thousands tweeting at 2 p.m. “I support continued funding of public broadcasting” with the march’s official hashtag.
Andrea Klein, a Silver Spring, Md. resident and alumna, came out for the march because she believes the impact of public broadcasting stretches beyond shows like Sesame Street.
“This doesn’t just have to do with Big Bird, it’s about supporting PBS stations all across the country,” Klein said. “Stations will close if we don’t support them.”
Rather than taking a bitter stance on budget cuts, the marchers focused on the benefits of public broadcasting.
Freshman Amelia Williams said public broadcasting outlets shouldn’t be a partisan issue, calling Big Bird “a puppet, not a political issue.”
“[Public broadcasting] brings people joy, it’s educational and it brings America together,” Williams said.
Baltimore-native Louis Triandafilou said those without cable depend on public channels like PBS, backing the company’s programs that provide essential information and entertainment.
“It’s a resource that’s available to enlighten us and make everyone so happy,” the 60-year-old said. “The country could be robbed of something so important.”

Administrators will lay out an ambitious set of sustainability strategies Tuesday to diminish the University’s eco footprint over the next decade.
The green plan outlines goals, such as becoming a zero-waste college and expanding farming to sell more GW-grown food in dining halls, to propel GW to what administrators call the forefront of sustainability campaigns in higher education. Most initiatives have targets of 2020.
Covering initiatives already in place by the Office of Sustainability, including water quality and carbon emissions reduction initiatives, it also highlights waste reduction, ecosystem preservation, spiritual and body health and self-sustainable agriculture.
“We weren’t going to make GW sustainable by just doing energy, water and waste. We had to look at it more from a systems perspective,” Director of the Office of Sustainability Meghan Chapple-Brown said. “A lot of times, our economy doesn’t value the service the ecosystem provided.”
GW’s urban campus gives it a unique responsibility to restore the ecosystems that it has impacted over the last 100 years in Foggy Bottom, she said.
Chapple-Brown said the University has not calculated the cost of the plan, but added that many of its investments will pay for themselves.
A major component of the plan calls for increasing water-absorbing spaces on campus – like walkways connecting buildings – by 10 percent to make up for Foggy Bottom’s loss of its natural swamps.
Chapple-Brown said the GroW Garden, a campus garden across from Philip Amsterdam Hall, would serve as a model for more small-scale farms on campus. The garden, which received a $10,000 Gardens for Good Grant last year, is run by the Food Justice Alliance with student, staff and faculty volunteers.
Intensified efforts to become a zero-waste college will emphasize composting, recycling paper and promoting reusable water bottles on campus.
The University also plans to add more green space and promote healthy lifestyles outdoors by promoting the student-run group GW TRAILS and the nearby Rock Creek Park, Chapple-Brown said, though all the details for the years-long plan have not yet been hammered out.
The office’s graduate research associate Ridhima Kapur said staff looked at studies that showed that more natural space improves cognitive abilities and helps hospital patients heal faster.
“That you can see green space and see nature around, and to be more in tune with it, is somehow more helpful,” Kapur said. “We need to get the students the opportunity to access it.”
Each of the plan’s key tenets will be broken down into specific initiatives and projects over the next few years, Chapple-Brown said. Big ideas will be handed off to the Innovation Task Force, the University’s cost-cutting committee that meets year-round to outline ways to make GW more efficient.
Chapple-Brown said GW has a pioneering take on sustainability, similar to those taken by corporations like the Dow Chemical Company.
“Service companies haven’t tackled it before,” Chapple-Brown said. “We have a lot to learn, because we know this is a really ambitious plan.”
Chapple-Brown, who spent about 15 years working for companies like Ford Motor Company, Nike and Walmart, said she knew a holistic approach “was where the world was moving towards” because of its cost-saving and moral implications.
The office based the strategy on recommendations from the World Business Council on Sustainable Development and the United Nations Environmental Programme. GW also pulled in experts and professors to weigh in on the plan, though Chapple-Brown said GW would need to continue to solicit feedback to create community buy-in.
The plan is the most far-reaching green initiative under University President Knapp, covering all aspects of the school’s impact on the environment.
Knapp, who lived on a sustainable farm in Sparks, Md. before coming to Foggy Bottom in 2007, has made green initiatives a priority since the start of his presidency. He convened a sustainability-focused task force upon his arrival, leading to the founding of the Office of Sustainability in 2009. Two years ago, GW launched its first major commitment to sustainability with the Climate Action Plan, which set the aim to reduce 40 percent of greenhouse gas emissions by 2025.
A year after Knapp arrived, a scathing Sierra Club report called out GW for lacking measures to combat greenhouse gases, highlighting the amount of eco-related catch-up the University had to undertake in a new administration.
The Office of Sustainability has worked on its master eco-plan for two years, after releasing glimpses of its sustainability strategy through the Climate Action Plan and GWater Plan. Knapp introduced the plans in 2010 and 2011 respectively, pledging a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and water bottle usage on campus. Knapp said in April that the office was planning for a third “ecosystem plan.”
Both of the smaller blueprints will fall under the umbrella of the overarching green plan.
Twenty-two students have declared majors in the sustainability minor that launched this fall. The GW Law School also began pumping money into its energy law program this summer, with an almost half a million dollar donation from The Constellation Foundation, a branch of the national energy provider Exelon Corporation.

Correction appended
GW will become a smoke-free campus by September 2013, banning smoking within 25 feet of campus buildings and in public spaces like Kogan Plaza and University Yard.
The Faculty Senate executive committee heard the plan and the Board of Trustees both approved it last month.
Students who violate the policy will be referred to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities, while faculty and staff will be referred to Human Resources, according to planning documents.
When asked what consequences students could face from the disciplinary office, its director Gabriel Slifka deferred to University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard, who said GW was not ready to comment on specifics.
Administrators plan to promote quitting programs as New Year’s resolutions and incorporate awareness efforts into Colonial Inauguration, according to planning documents.
The Office of External Relations will also make how-to guides, videos and “mock tickets” soon after the launch to gain student, faculty, staff and neighbor support.
The graduate student organization Colonials for Clean Air partnered with the Student Association to hold a referendum on the issue last February. More than 66 percent of voters backed the idea of a smoke-free barrier around campus buildings, though less than 20 percent of the student body weighed in.
Julien Guttman, a member of Colonials for Clean Air, called the policy “a dream come true for us.” She said the group has worked hard to get it approved since 2008 – distributing petitions that have collected more than 900 signatures, meeting with faculty and educating the community about the dangers of secondhand smoke.
Director of the Center for Student Engagement Tim Miller, who supported the group last year but was concerned as to how the ban could be enforced, said the community should focus on the new policy’s wellness benefits. He added that despite the 20 percent voter turnout in the referendum, it was fair to implement the policy because students had an opportunity to oppose the ban.
“I hope the students who smoke will still find a way to enjoy what they enjoy – which is smoking – but I honestly hope some of these people will make a choice and not smoke,” Miller said.
GW will formally announce the new policy Nov. 15, coinciding with the annual Great American Smokeout, hosted by the American Cancer Society. Sherrard said the review of the smoking policy is part of the Healthy Campus program, which noted that a healthier pool of faculty could save GW $3.5 million in healthcare costs.
Sherrard also declined to comment if the University will add more quitting programs. GW also unveiled an anti-smoking campaign in February 2011, offering resources and counseling to smokers looking to ditch the habit.
“This is really an initiative stemming from the students – not from the administration or the [Faculty Senate] pushing down onto the student body,” Kimberly Acquaviva, director of Faculty Affairs and a professor in the School of Nursing, said.
She stressed that committee had “no desire to create a culture where people are busted for smoking” and that the primary focus was to make a healthier campus environment.
Acquaviva said she knows that GW, as an urban campus, “can never truly be a 100 percent smoke-free campus because of the people walking through, but we can certainly do our best.” Building managers in D.C. are permitted by law to implement smoking bans in areas up to 25 away feet from a building. GW cannot ban smoking across its campus because of privately owned businesses in the neighborhood.
But the Mount Vernon Campus could become entirely smoke-free since it is all University property, Michael Castleberry, chair of the Faculty Senate executive committee, said.
“Still, the problem is, once you’re entering the Mount Vernon campus, are you going to totally exclude smokers from that environment? These are still questions we need to work on,” he said.
Nearby schools – Catholic, Gallaudet, Georgetown, Marymount and Trinity Washington universities, all ban smoking within 25 feet of building entrances. The University of Maryland will become smoke-free by next summer, joining 825 other campuses around the country.
Student Association President Ashwin Narla said he will convene a group of about a dozen smoking and nonsmoking students to get feedback, because he said “some students will feel marginalized and think the University is being unfair.” He said gauging students’ opinions on this issue is especially important since the referendum didn’t gather a large turnout.
“We want, as the SA, to take their feedback and make sure the administration is taking that into consideration,” Narla said. “We represent every student and there are a lot of students out there that will have negative feedback.”
Acquaviva said that the University pays attention to student voices because their tuition dollars run the school.
“At the end of the day, you are all our bosses, in many ways if you think about it, and during your educational experience, you have put us in that role,” Acquaviva said.

The Hatchet incorrectly reported that the Faculty Senate’s executive committee voted to move the smoking ban forward. In fact, the committee only heard the plan.

After spending the night on a YMCA gym floor, students gulped down coffee at a local diner and piled into cars for their 11-hour work days.
A typical day on the College Democrats campaign trail starts at about 8 a.m. Students crisscross the streets by foot until sundown, pitching President Barack Obama to potential voters and keeping up their energy by the occasional shouts of “Four more years!”
Nearly four dozen students traveled to Hilliard, Ohio on one of four overnight trips  from Oct. 12 to 14. They are among thousands of college students working Obama’s ground game, armed with clip boards, buttons and campaign stickers.
The group has also taken about 50 students to North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Virginia this election cycle. Students also participate in weekly phone banking events and weekend trips to Virginia, sometimes with groups like Allied in Pride to promote the Maryland ballot initiative on marriage equality.
“I think that personally as someone who’s really starting to become more integrated in society, I’m going to be looking for a job in a few years, I want to make sure my country’s going in the right direction,” Kevin Palermo, the group’s freshman representative, said.
Some volunteers at the Cleveland suburb, mainly college students, have been campaigning there since the beginning of the year. The CDs knocked on more than 5,000 doors in the battleground state during their visit.
Campaign directors had a ritual to energize volunteers, shouting “Fired up,” with canvassers responding “Ready to go” in unison.
The state’s branch of Obama for America, headquartered in Chicago, Ill., got its start from Hilliard for Obama volunteer Judy Kamalay. The 61-year-old has pulled several College Democrats chapters from across Ohio and the country, including GW’s.
Kamalay has held several small meetings at her home since she joined the campaign in January. She said college students play a pivitol role in the 
election, and her inspiration comes from the many energized young Obama for America staffers – like GW senior DJ Sigworth, who took a semester off to work at the campaign office in Ohio.
“I think it’s a reward every day, because we’re working towards a really worthwhile goal,” Kamalay said. “I made a decision last year that there was nothing more important – not fully retiring, not going back to work – nothing was more important to me than doing everything I possibly could to get the president elected.”
Students received brief training on how to approach voters before pairing off to hit the streets, while others dial phones for hours to get out the vote for Obama.
That Saturday in Ohio, students were surprised with visits from former state governor Ted Strickland, a Democrat, and former Republican Florida governor Charlie Crist.
Both leaders encouraged political activism and stressed the importance of early voting during the election, with Crist saying Obama represents “American values,” not just those of Democrats or Republicans.
“What you’re doing is so vitally important to the future of this great country, and what so many people have worked for for so long,” Crist said. “We have to come together, and I know that this president is the man who can do it for all of us, so thank you for what you are doing.”
Unlike many other chapters nationwide, GW’s CDs rely on their own funding for events. It boasts more than 2,000 members. Of the 44 students on the Ohio trip, 10 were international students, representing England, Australia, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Japan and Singapore.
Senior Juliana Amin, the CDs’ campaign director, said the group began planning the trip in July. The most tedious aspect was keeping track of events and participants to follow through with arrangements, being that trips are usually coordinated just a month ahead of time.
“I think that young people should really be paying attention to what’s going on in this country, and appreciate the work this President has done, and should be trying to re-elect him so that we can keep moving forward,” Amin said.

For the Graduate School of Political Management, this election has become a game for political junkies.
The political community applied an unconventional approach to election polling with a weekly Horse Race poll this fall, surveying about 170 GSPM students, alumni, full-time faculty and adjunct professors to track presidential candidates’ strategies and performance – not voter preference.
Launched Aug. 5, the poll was designed to bring together the program’s politicos, professor of political management Chris Arterton said. He and TransparaGov, Inc. CEO David Rehr, also an adjunct professor in GSPM, spearheaded the project and executed its data collection.
“We came up with the idea because our people are in the thick of it all day – involved in campaigns and working in the capital,” Rehr said. “We’re the foremost political, legislative and strategic graduate school in America, so why don’t we look at how they view the previous week and what advice they would give?”
In the past month since the first debate, the participants concluded that former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has bested the president. In the week proceeding Oct. 30, Romney received a 3.72 rating in comparison to Obama’s 3.15. The scale ranks candidates from one to five, with one being “very ineffective” and five meaning “very effective.”
Contrary to prominent polls, such as the POLITICO/George Washington University Battleground Tracking Poll, “participants are not saying who they will vote for, [but instead] who is doing a successful job,” Arterton said. “It’s remarkable; Democrats would say Romney did better, and Republicans, Obama.”
Arterton said the goal of the poll was to represent the thought of political professionals at GW, who are often campaign experts.
“I don’t consider this to be a poll in the strictest sense,” he said. “We are calling it an ‘insiders’ poll, representative of opinions only of this group of people.”
The Horse Race also provided a forum for alumni to voice their opinions.
Arterton said alumni, who are often hard to engage, responded positively to the project and had a high response rate each week.
The survey also allowed participants to provide suggestions to candidates’ campaigns based on the previous week’s performance. This sort of qualitative data, Rehr said, is rare in political polls.
“The best part is getting the insights on what advice they would be offering,” said Rehr. “It’s really good stuff.”
Responses often directly addressed the candidates. One Democratic respondent told President Barack Obama to “go after Romney” in a debate.
As the vice presidential debate approached, a Republican insider recommended:, “Ryan: Let Biden talk. If you give him enough slack, he will run to the end of the leash, and we all know what happens next.”
The poll, in its first year, gave students an opportunity for sharp political analysis, putting classroom skills into practice.
“We are going to continue to look toward our community for their engagement,” Rehr said. “It’s been a lot of fun.”

You’ll be forgiven if, looking at the stat sheet, you’re not sure Isaiah Armwood actually took any time off at all.
The Villanova transfer returned to the court after a year off Saturday afternoon and transformed into the driving force behind GW’s 72-46 victory over NCAA Division III Catholic in an exhibition game – pulling down 16 boards, adding seven points, two blocks and three steals.
To put it simply, Armwood enjoyed his return to the hardwood.
“I felt like I was a freshman again,” Armwood said. “It really felt good to get the first game out of the way and look forward to the rest of the season.”
Armwood was the key piece of a GW defense that oftentimes left Catholic stymied, running down the clock as it desperately sought an open look. An imposing presence in the paint, Armwood threw his whole body into maintaining a physical presence in the paint, and gathered 16 boards on the game, 11 of which were defensive.
It would have been the most rebounds recorded by a single Colonial since February 2009 – except that the contest was technically just an exhibition match.
“Rebounding is something that [head coach Mike] Lonergan emphasizes a lot. He emphasizes it every day in practice,” Armwood said. “He’s demanding about it, so I have to go out there and do it.”
The Cardinals shot just 30.2 percent on the game. And Catholic had only 10 assists, proof the team was struggling to run its offense.
Still, Lonergan wasn’t satisfied with his team’s defense. GW’s rebound margin, 45 to Catholic’s 33, wasn’t as big as the coach would have liked, and he saw his players get pushed around by smaller Cardinals on a few possessions and fail to box out on others. For a young team like the Colonials, Lonergan added, the physicality of the defense needs to be ramped up even more.
“I give them credit. [Against] some of our tougher guys, Catholic U came out and played physical,” Lonergan said. “Physical at point guard and other positions, and it really took a couple of guys out of the game, and we got into some foul trouble on different things.”
The main foul trouble came for freshman guard Joe McDonald, who started the game but fouled out midway through the second with a stat line that included six assists.
Still, Lonergan said, McDonald will be GW’s starting point guard moving forward, calling Saturday’s play an anomaly that doesn’t represent the freshman’s true potential.
“Not judged by today, Joe has been our best point guard by far, in the preseason and trip to Italy. He just had an off day, the foul trouble, everything – he got rattled. That’s not indicative of his talent,” Lonergan said. “He’s got a week to get back, put this out of his mind, I hope.”
With McDonald at the point, GW took the lead at the 18:38 mark of the first half off of a dunk from sophomore forward John Kopriva. From there, GW never looked back, maintaining a comfortable margin over the Cardinals throughout most of play. The Colonials shot 46.6 percent on the game, making 40 percent of their shots from long range.
The offense relied heavily on gritty play, scoring 40 points in the paint, many of GW’s tallies coming from high-low post maneuvers that often saw Armwood team up with senior forward Dwayne Smith, or Kopriva, to get turn-around buckets and easy lay-ins. Smith finished the game with a team-high 14 points, adding two boards and two steals, and Kopriva netted 11 points and five rebounds.
“We’re not a very good shooting team. We work on it all the time,” Lonergan said. “We are an average to poor shooting team, and if you’re not a good shooting team, you have to get the ball inside and establish an inside game, and go inside-out.”
Senior guard Lasan Kromah added 12 points on the night, pulling down three rebounds, dishing out two assists and adding three steals. And freshman forward Patricio Garino became the fourth Colonial to enter double digits, adding 10 points, five boards and four assists. A lot of the team’s success came from its focus on inside-out play, Kromah said, and communication on the court.
Overall, the team seemed to relax more in the second, after turnovers and allowing Catholic to, at times, control the pace of the first half kept GW from decisively pulling away.
“We’ve had a couple guys that have been great in practice, been very consistent, that didn’t have good days today, and really caught me off guard,” Lonergan said. “I’m sure they’ll bounce back, maybe it’s first game jitters.”
And in a pattern that’s become familiar to those who watch the head coach’s approach, Lonergan walked away from a decisive win with a long list of things his team needs to build upon.
He hopes reinforcements will come soon in the form of senior forward David Pellom and freshman forward Kevin Larsen. Pellom, who’s out after undergoing wrist surgery in the offseason, has been practicing with sprints and drills, but has yet to return to contact play, Lonergan said.
And Larsen, who hurt his groin in a preseason practice, returned to the court today, but hurt his right ankle, leaving his status up to the team’s trainers, the head coach said.
“I’d love to get [Pellom] back and get Kevin healthy,” Lonergan said. “I think we’d be a much improved inside team.”

Foggy Bottom’s governing group is pledging to protest the University’s plan to build a multimillion-dollar office building when it goes to the city’s zoning board for approval Nov. 15.
The Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission voted at a rare special meeting Thursday to oppose the new office complex slated for 2100 Pennsylvania Ave. The session was held after the group’s monthly meeting Oct. 17 could not reach a voting quorum and ended abruptly after chairwoman Florence Harmon stormed out after members disagreed on the project.
The commission operates as a liaison between community members and District agencies to give local residents a voice over issues that directly impact them.
“The ANC is the only organization that has great weight, and the zoning commission is supposed to recognized that,” Harmon said at the meeting.
The ANC pushed back on the University’s offer to build a row of affordable housing units along F Street in return for an additional 40,000 square feet of space for the office complex. The University refuted neighborhood concerns, citing traffic and construction reviews conducted by GW’s operations team.
The commissioners agreed that the project must offer community amenities that benefit the neighborhood in return for increased space.
Neighbors proposed locally owned and operated retail space in the new GW structure to replace the restaurants on site that will be forced out – Froggy Bottom Pub, Mehran Restaurant, Panda Café and Thai Place.
“I think that’s the point, is that it’s mom and pop places and not chains,” Harmon said in the commission’s resolution. “We want what we have there now with businesses that are open later – not a dry cleaners that closes up at 5:30.”
The commission also echoed concerns raised by residents of the President Condominium in mid-October. Tenants and landlords of the 2141 I St. building said construction and noise would deter potential renters.
The proposed design for the property includes an alleyway directly adjacent to the condos with a loading dock and 179-car parking garage.
Senior Associate Vice President for Operations Alicia Knight said the University will remain in discussions with neighbors regarding the project “with the goal of addressing the concerns raised at Thursday’s meeting.”
