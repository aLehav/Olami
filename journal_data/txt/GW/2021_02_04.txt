Cane's wings are smoked for 12 hours and served with a side of dressing and sliced green onion for garnish.
Instead of daydreaming about sunbathing on a Caribbean beach, experience the best of Trinidad and Tobago and indulge in the islands’ tropical flavors at Cane. 
Located at 403 H St. NE, the modern joint is conveniently situated in the heart of D.C.’s H Street corridor and neighbors popular restaurants, like Thamee and Brine. For now, Cane is only open for takeout and delivery, available through Uber Eats and Grubhub. 
When COVID-19 does go away, you should probably expect long wait times for in-person dining. The inside is cramped and offers just a few seats along a booth that extends across the left wall. Cane does not take reservations, and seats inside the small restaurant are allocated on a first-come, first-serve basis. 
Cane serves lunch Monday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. and dinner on these same days from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m., except until 9 a.m. on Saturdays. Both the dinner and lunch menus incorporate many of the same ingredients, but lunch servings are relatively smaller.
I opted to order for dinner but not before I skimmed through the lunch menu for dishes I’ll try when I’m back again. Meat eaters might want to check out the cumin-packed geera pork belly bowl ($15), and vegetarians can enjoy the veggie bowl topped with curried potatoes and a channa, or chickpea, stew ($14). 
Starters on the dinner menu offer some more variety. If you’re craving something bread-like, Cane offers the “Doubles” Indian fried bread topped with spiced chickpeas ($6), as well as a half dozen Trinidadian “hops” buns with homemade butter ($8). The cow heel soup ($7), complete with chilis, cilantro, lime and cucumber, also caught my eye.
There are only three individual entree options available for dinner, but all looked equally delicious. You can choose between an oxtail, brisket and beef tendon stew ($29); grilled ox tail ($22); or a whole deep-fried snapper (price depends on market). 
To be honest, the price to portion ratio appeared a bit steep for a college student, so I opted for two appetizers to save a few bucks. I settled on the 12-hour smoked jerk wings ($12) with a side of the channa fritters ($5). The wings were served with a side of creamy ranch dressing and topped with sliced green onion for garnish. 
I like pretty much all chicken wings, so my bar for quality is pretty low. But Cane’s jerk chicken wings blew my expectations. Having sat in a smoker for half a day, the chicken was delectably tender and literally fell off the bone with every bite. I could taste the deep woody smoke infused into the delicate meat.
The zingy and spicy dry rub gave the meat a bright and addictive heat – similar to curried chicken but more peppery and citrusy. The rub also formed a sticky bark-like crust on the chicken wings that was packed with flavor.
I didn’t order drinks, but Cane serves specialty punches for those who are 21 or older. The chef’s punch combines white rum, bitters and lime juice, while the Christmas punch uses a hibiscus flower base with white rum and other spices (both $9). 
Cane may be a bit too pricey to frequent, but the multicultural fusion of flavors left my taste buds hooked. I hope to order again in the future, hopefully at a time when I can sit down and get the full restaurant experience.

There may finally be light at the end of the tunnel for the COVID-19 pandemic, as cases fall and vaccinations ramp up across the country. But the presence of new strains of the virus could wipe away all of that progress – making it more important than ever to follow public health protocols to stop the spread.
Here’s the good news and bad news about the state of the pandemic in D.C. – and how you can ensure we have more good than bad going forward.
The good news:
More people are getting vaccinated, the number of cases is dropping and the number of deaths is leveling off. Cases have started to decline nationwide, with the rolling average of new confirmed infections down 29 percent from two weeks ago. Hospitalizations are down more than one-fifth nationwide in that same time frame. In the District, there are about a quarter fewer daily cases than two weeks ago, with D.C.’s overall trends closely resembling national ones.
The number of virus-related deaths has remained fairly constant in both D.C. and nationwide, but deaths tend to be a lagging indicator. In other words, epidemiologists predict deaths will decline in a few weeks about as fast as infections and hospitalizations are falling now.
The vaccine rollout is beginning to shake off its rough start. More people have now gotten at least one shot since mid-December than have tested positive throughout the entire pandemic. In D.C., nearly one in 10 residents have gotten at least one dose, which is similar to the nationwide vaccine rate.
The bad news:
Even though cases are going down and deaths have stopped climbing, tens of thousands of people are still getting sick and dying from COVID-19 every day.
The presence of new, more-contagious variants of COVID-19 threatens to send cases skyrocketing again and could imperil the effectiveness of the vaccine rollout. These new variants are right at D.C.’s doorstep: the U.K. variant was detected in Northern Virginia, and the South African variant has begun to spread in Maryland.
These new strains could unravel the progress that has been made – or, at the least, make further progress harder. Both variants spread faster, and the strain originally found in South Africa may be harder to stop with the vaccines currently available. If the public becomes lax with mask wearing and social distancing or the federal government fails to improve vaccine distribution, things could get worse.
There is also still a glaring racial disparity in who is able to get the vaccine. On both a national level and in D.C., people of color are vastly underrepresented among vaccine recipients – for example, only 5 percent of total shots nationally have gone to Black Americans.
When the District opened up appointments for residents aged 65 and older, the majority of signups came from White seniors, while very few Black and Latino people got slots, according to DCist. The pandemic has hit people of color especially hard across the country and in D.C., exacerbating existing disparities in access to health care and treatment. The District and the country need to take concrete steps to repair that trend and ensure equity of access.
What you can do: 
Wear a mask. If there were ever a time to buckle down, it’s now. The new variants are circulating, and it is only a matter of time before they become prevalent, which could throw a wrench in the pandemic finally subsiding. Wearing a mask and practicing social distancing remain some of the most basic and effective ways to protect yourself and others.
How you wear your mask and the kind of mask you wear also matter in stopping the spread. Double-masking, for example, is an option that National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci recently expressed support for. Alone, a surgical mask is about 60 to 70 percent effective at filtering droplets, and a cloth mask is about 50 percent effective. But layering a tight-fitting cloth mask on top of a surgical mask could be as high as 91 percent effective. A KN-95 mask – which is nearly as protective as the N-95 masks used by health care workers – is another great option, according to researchers.
Students, especially those living in Foggy Bottom, generally have advantages and privileges that many people do not have – so students should use them to ensure they are keeping the community safe. For example, the University provides free, on-demand testing that takes minutes – so pick a time every week to get a test. Limit gatherings and unnecessary travel as much as you can because lots of people do not have that option.
And, when it becomes available to you, get the vaccine as soon as you can.

Karina Ochoa Berkley, a sophomore majoring in political science and philosophy, is the Student Association’s vice president for sustainability and an opinions writer.
Late last month, the Student Association Senate officially introduced impeachment charges against then-President Howard Brookins following several cabinet resignations and a public statement posted on Twitter describing how Brookins purportedly sexually harassed a student. The statement prompted several student organizations, senators and SA cabinet members – including myself – to call for Brookins to resign. Since the impeachment charges have been filed, Brookins has resigned in a, frankly deplorable, letter where he not only denies the basis of the “allegations” but calls the experience of the survivor who came forward against him “speculative.”
However, none of the impeachment charges against him are related to this conduct – they are solely tied to technical violations of the bylaws, like failing to make appointments to certain positions. That’s because, according to the Code of Student Conduct, student organizations are not allowed to take “adjudicatory or sanctioning action” for breaching GW policies without the approval of the Student Rights and Responsibilities director. As currently written and interpreted, the Code of Student Conduct fosters an environment that allows potentially dangerous members of the community to assume leadership in the GW community, and it is unacceptable.
This rule is likely intended to encourage students to use University departments, like SRR and the Title IX Office, to report violations of the Code of Student Conduct. But the policy limits the power of student organizations to remove student leaders who present a threat to the safety and well-being of other students. Had Brookins managed to avoid four bylaws violations, there would have been no mechanism to remove him for purported sexual harassment. We could have only hoped for his eventual resignation. To remedy this, the SA Senate and other student organizations should amend their bylaws to 1) adopt organization-specific ethics codes that describe what constitutes “misconduct” and 2) outline how to remove and/or ban individuals for said misconduct.
One of the most powerful tools student organizations can have to support survivors of sexual misconduct is the ability to deplatform assailants. GW has a significant history of men in student leadership positions getting away scot-free for sexually harassing and assaulting, predominantly women survivors. For example, just last summer, nearly a dozen people came forward against Ethan Somers, a well-known figure in certain anti-gun advocacy circles, describing experiences of rape and sexual assault. While Somers never publicly faced charges, the platforms that gave Somers his notoriety, namely Guns Down America, Gifford’s, Express Inc. and Culture Media-Co all terminated their contracts and affiliations with him – solidifying his “social death.” But more importantly, it ensured survivors of sexual misconduct would no longer have to see their assailant undeservingly glorified in their community. This is exactly the kind of measure all student organizations should be allowed to take to expel community threats.
This liberty is especially important when existing University institutions fail to provide adequate support for and ensure survivors’ safety. For instance, in 2017, a survivor of sexual assault had to resort to petitioning the University to expel her assailant after GW had only issued a deferred suspension, meaning he was banned from residence halls for two months and required to attend two meetings with a administrator. Clearly here, the University’s priorities were to ensure the comfort of the assailant, as opposed to the safety of the survivor and other women at the University. At the very least, officials should allow student organizations to remove students who pose threats to other students, particularly to women.
My fellow students should join this effort to ensure we are allowed to remove predators for being predators and to not simply hope that future leaders just so happen to also be incompetent in their professional lives. Student groups must institute substantive changes that allow for members to be removed for misconduct, because there will be more abusers that come through who are not bad at their job like our previous president.

GW's chapter of Students for D.C. Statehood brings both Republicans and Democrats together to fight for representation for the District's 700,000 residents.
Updated: Feb. 4, 2020 at 1:59 p.m.
With Democrats gaining control of Congress and a new president, students say advocates for D.C. statehood have been emboldened with the prospect of establishing the District as the 51st state.
The topic of D.C. statehood has shot to the top of national attention over the past year, after the city received relatively smaller COVID-19 stimulus packages and lacked the authority to call in the National Guard when rioters supporting former President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol. Matthew Oberstaedt, the president of the GW chapter of Students for D.C. Statehood, said members are using that momentum to increase advocacy efforts by lobbying members of Congress and joining forces with other advocacy organizations.
“We’re closer now than we have been in a long time,” Oberstaedt said. “For the past four years, we had a president who was opposed to this idea, but right now, we have a president and a lot of members of Congress who are really supportive. So I think we’ve got a better chance now than we have in quite a while.”
The U.S. House of Representatives introduced statehood legislation last week after passing a previous version of the bill for the first time ever last year. President Joe Biden has indicated support for D.C. statehood for years.
Oberstaedt said chapter members are writing letters to members of Congress, hosting events with speakers supporting D.C. statehood and encouraging students to write pieces for their local publications in areas across the country that might not be aware of the citywide movement. He said the group also plans to participate in an annual lobby day in February, held virtually this year because of the pandemic, in hopes of generating momentum in Congress.
Obersteadt said he spoke with several congressional staffers who won’t co-sponsor statehood legislation and learned that several have withheld their endorsements because their constituents lack interest in the issue.
“One of the big problems that the D.C. statehood movement faces is that a lot of people around the country don’t realize D.C. residents lack the same rights they do,” he said. “More of them are learning about it due to the events of the past year where it’s been in the news, but it remains a problem.”
The GW chapter is partnering with other student organizations like GW College Democrats and March for Our Lives GW, Oberstaedt said. He said the partnerships involve co-hosting events with speakers and holding letter-writing campaigns.
He said the chapter also would like to work with GW College Republicans if the group is interested.
Even though statehood generally hasn’t received as much Republican support, Oberstaedt said partnering with Republicans can help give the issue the bipartisan support it needs to pass Congress.
He added that chapter members are coordinating via email and GroupMe in light of the pandemic. When students are all on campus, members would normally gather around Kogan Plaza with the D.C. flag to spread information about the cause.
Josiah Reedy, the treasurer of the GW statehood chapter, said he’s a Republican who supports statehood because it upholds national values dating back to the Revolutionary War, fighting against taxation without representation. He said he helped organize an event last fall with conservative speakers from D.C. who also have advocated for the measure to pass Congress.
“We should uphold the values that we fought a revolution a few 100 years over, and we fought for no taxation without representation,” Reedy said. “And that should apply to everyone in the U.S., the people in D.C.”
Republicans led by then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell quashed Democratic attempts to push a statehood bill through Congress last year as D.C. statehood would likely increase the number of Democratic representatives in the House and U.S. Senate. Reedy said more Republicans are starting to flip in support of statehood after understanding more about the transition to a state government and the benefits of additional state funding.
“Coming from a Republican perspective, usually it’s the kind of issue that Republicans aren’t necessarily big fans of D.C. statehood, but usually they don’t want to necessarily talk about it that much because it’s not like one of those issues that is going to look really good to be against,” he said.
Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat and the District’s non-voting member of Congress, introduced the most recent statehood bill to the 117th Congress last month, gathering 202 cosponsors – the most statehood has ever received. Republicans are expected to block a Senate vote with a filibuster, so statehood would need 60 senators to pass the bill.
“This is the most important bill I introduce each Congress, and it made historic strides in the last Congress,” she said in her introductory statement for the bill. “District residents have always been citizens of the United States and pay more federal taxes per capita than the residents of any state but are the only federal income taxpaying Americans who do not have full and equal citizenship rights. The denial of local control on local matters and of equal representation in Congress can be remedied only by statehood.”

An earlier version of this story stated that the GW chapter has partnered with GW College Republicans to host events. The chapter is hoping to partner wit CRs in the future.

Then-SA Executive Vice President Brandon Hill ascended to the presidency earlier this week after former SA President Howard Brookins resigned.
Applications opened for a permanent Student Association executive vice president Wednesday to fill a vacancy that resulted from former President Howard Brookins’ resignation.
After Brookins resigned Sunday, then-SA Executive Vice President Brandon Hill was sworn in as SA president, and then-SA Sen. Thomas Falcigno, CPS-G and chairperson pro tempore of the SA Senate, became acting EVP until Hill appoints a permanent replacement, who must be confirmed by the senate. The new EVP will serve the remainder of the term, which carries through the end of the academic year.
“President Hill is looking for someone who is prepared enough to take on this role starting in the coming weeks, to take us through the rest of the Spring 2021 semester,” an SA Facebook announcement states.
The position’s responsibilities include chairing the senate, leading “legislative initiatives” and meeting with top officials, according to the announcement.
Falcigno, the acting EVP, will serve in the post until the senate confirms a replacement, but he said when reached for comment that he will not submit an application for the role.
“I have full confidence in President Hill’s ability to select an EVP that will be able to rebuild trust and carry out our mission,” he said. “I will continue to play an advisory role in the EVP selection process when asked and look forward to assisting the SA with an orderly transition for whoever is selected and subsequently confirmed by the senate.”
All “qualified” members of the GW community are allowed to submit a one-page letter outlining their experience, policy goals and qualifications to Hill by Saturday at noon, the announcement states.
Brookins, the former SA president, stepped down after more than 50 current and former SA members and student leaders called for his resignation and the senate began impeachment proceedings against him amid sexual misconduct allegations and claims that Brookins created a “negligent and careless work environment.”

Faculty overseeing the survey announced on Jan. 7 that they had so far received 802 completed responses to the survey, which was sent to 1,690 faculty on Dec. 17.
The faculty-wide survey on University President Thomas LeBlanc has closed after collecting responses for more than a month.
The survey, which was launched after faculty voted to approve its development in November, included questions about GW’s campus climate and LeBlanc’s leadership abilities and garnered responses from hundreds of faculty. Faculty overseeing the survey said they received more than 1,200 completed responses, more than 70 percent of the 1,690 faculty on the Dec. 17 distribution list.
The faculty announced last week that they would analyze and post the results publicly by Feb. 22.
Arthur Wilson, the chair of the senate’s executive committee, said at a senate meeting last month that the response collection was going “well.”
“The survey team has made every effort to accommodate all full-time faculty, and we have already achieved a response rate comparable to other University surveys,” Wilson wrote in his report to the senate. “More responses are still being submitted. A report on the survey’s findings will then be produced and reported out via the senate website.”

GW Law professor Jonathan Turley will not testify before Congress during Trump's impeachment trial.
GW Law professor Jonathan Turley declined a request to represent former President Donald Trump at Trump’s impeachment trial, The Washington Post reported.
Five lawyers quit Trump’s legal team this past weekend, days before his Feb. 9 trial for his role in the riot at the U.S. Capitol, The Post reported. Trump originally wanted his team to argue that he won the November election – a claim that would require citing disproven claims of widespread election fraud, but his attorneys instead advised him to focus on arguing the unconstitutionality of impeaching a former president.
Trump’s office announced that two new lawyers are taking over his defense.
Turley told The Washington Post that Trump could harm his own case if he insists on arguing that voter fraud cost him the election.
“That claim is viewed by many senators as one of open contempt for their institution,” Turley said. “As it stands now, he would be acquitted by a fair margin. If he pursued that path, it could change the view and the votes of some senators.”
Turley has testified before Congress on Trump’s behalf before. He spoke in front of the House Judiciary Committee during Trump’s first impeachment trial in December 2019, saying there was no “compelling evidence” that the former president committed a crime.

Campus will open at 9 a.m. Tuesday morning.
The Foggy Bottom and Virginia Science and Technology campuses will have delayed openings Tuesday, shuttering facilities until 9 a.m. due to snowfall and a winter weather advisory.
In a GW Alert issued at about 8:50 p.m., officials said campus facilities like GW Libraries and COVID-19 testing centers will remain shut until 9, but the Medical Faculty Associates will be open during its regular 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. hours. The alert states the winter weather advisory will continue until 9 a.m., and “light snow” is expected to continue into Tuesday.
Foggy Bottom will see about an additional inch of snow, and Ashburn, Virginia – the site of the VSTC – should see between an additional 1 to 2 inches, according to the alert. The alert states a “potential” one-tenth inch of ice could also form.
The alert states students with COVID-19 testing appointments scheduled before 9 a.m. can get tested later in the day.
