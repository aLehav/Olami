A conservative commentator and a liberal pundit will cross swords March 4 at a debate co-sponsored by the College Republicans and College Democrats.
The debate challengers – Ann Coulter and Lawrence O’Donnell – were selected because of their sharply partisan positions in a matching that Student Association Executive Vice President Ted Costigan said he hopes will lead to a heated dialogue.
“You have like the real liberal warrior and a conservative maverick going at it, and it’s kind of unique here in the center of politics at GW,” Costigan said.
The pair will spar on contemporary political issues related to the 2012 election.
Coulter is a right-leaning columnist and controversial New York Times bestselling author known for her works such as “If Democrats Had Any Brains, They’d Be Republicans.” O’Donnell, who received his own time slot on MSNBC last year, is staunchly left-leaning and vocally supports a liberal perspective on social issues. Coulter last came to campus in April 2011.
“We’re essentially pitting Fox News and MSNBC against each other,” Joe Maniscalco, president of the College Democrats, said. “I think it’s going to be a fun Sunday night.”
School of Media and Public Affairs director Frank Sesno will moderate the 7 p.m. debate taking place in Lisner Auditorium.
The two political groups are partnering with the Young America’s Foundation, the Student Association and Program Board. The event will mark the third installment in the Student Association’s new “Only at GW” speaker series.
Costigan has played an active role in bringing together University and student resources to help furnish $40,000 to host the speakers, tapping the School of Media and Public Affairs as a paying partner and asking for just $5,000 each from the College Democrats and College Republicans.
Last year’s $40,000 Newt Gingrich and Howard Dean matchup was funded entirely through student expenses – the largest single allocation made by the SA that year.
The coordinators hope to open the floor for student questioning at the debate, with some requests submitted in advance through Twitter.

Paulin files lawsuit against GW.
Feb. 23, 2012
GW files legal response to Paulin’s complaint. 
The University asked the U.S. District Court Thursday to drop a student’s lawsuit alleging she was unfairly dismissed from a medical program, saying it is unfounded.
Former School of Medicine and Health Sciences student Cyrena Paulin, a 53-year-old who was enrolled in the physician’s assistant program, filed a lawsuit Jan. 19 against GW after she did not receive a diploma due to a failing grade in a practical training course. She is suing for $2 million in damages.
GW rebuffed Paulin’s claim that her failing grade was the “product of ill-will and malice,” saying her complaint failed to show legal merit. The court has not yet reached a judgment on whether it will grant GW’s request to dismiss the case.
“This case is about a student who failed her program of study, was dismissed in accordance with school policies and is now complaining about her dismissal,” the University wrote in court documents.
Paulin alleged that former physician assistant program director Venetia Orcutt assigned her to a rotation that never previously handled students, leaving her without sufficient oversight from supervisors.
Orcutt resigned in November, following student complaints that she did not provide instruction for two online courses but still handed out “A” grades. The University refunded tuition for the classes, but students were allowed to keep their credits under the notion that they earned them through other program coursework.
The former student was treated in a manner consistent with GW’s grading policies, according to the University’s court response. The response said, while Paulin complained she was placed in an unfair rotation program, she “cannot point to one policy that this alleged treatment violates.”
Paulin’s academic performance was consistently poor, according to the University’s court filing.
“The University gave [the] Plaintiff multiple opportunities to improve her performance, but in the end, [the] Plaintiff was simply unable to complete the requirements for graduation,” the court documents read.
Faculty and her rotation supervisors met with Paulin prior to her dismissal, according to the documents, warning her that her performance was reaching an unacceptable level and she would need to make strides to pass.
Paulin’s complaint also alleged that the review examining her dismissal did not consider witnesses she hoped to present.
Students in suspension or dismissal cases similar to Paulin’s are unable to present additional witnesses, according to the medical school’s professional guidelines that GW included in the documents.
An independent committee formed by the University upon Paulin’s appeal of her dismissal found her behavior in the rotation “was not in a manner conformable to what is right, proper or expected,” according to the University’s filings.
Sean Malloy, Paulin’s attorney, said he had not yet fully reviewed the responses to the complaint and declined to comment, adding that he would “at the appropriate time” file a legal brief opposing GW’s request to toss the lawsuit out of court.
GW does not comment on pending litigation, University spokeswoman Jill Sankey said.
The $2 million Paulin is requesting in damages would cover her tuition, funds she would have earned if she graduated in 2010 and the difference in the annual salary earned by someone with a physician’s degree compared to an individual without such a degree.

The University’s largest domestic employer will expand its applicant pool by opening up its hiring process to college juniors.
Teach for America, an AmeriCorps affiliate that places college graduates in disadvantaged schools across the country for two-year teaching stints, hopes to attract more applicants with the new option.
“We created this opportunity for juniors whose personal or school calendars may make it logistically challenging for them to apply during their senior year,” Teach for America Regional Communications Director Kaitlin Gastrock said.
Teach for America accepted 5,200 new corps members last year, which represented only 11 percent of applicants.
Gastrock said junior applicants will apply for slots to enter the program in 2013, which will not affect this year’s seniors who will form the 2012 corps. She declined to say how the change would impact future selectivity of its applicant pool, saying, “we’re planning to look closely at and learn from the results from this year.”
She said “it’s hard to predict” how the volume and composition of 2013 applications will change with the new option.
Dean of Students Peter Konwerski said the early application will allow interested students to pursue relevant classes during their senior year, “particularly those with a service-learning focus or in education or child development, and also to participate in service that will increase their preparation for the classroom.”
The early application deadline for 2013’s cohort is Feb. 27. Juniors will be notified of their application status by the end of April and, if successful, will have until November to commit.
Teach for America competes only with the Peace Corps for post-graduation popularity among GW students. Of 2011’s 186 GW applicants, 28 joined the program. In September, Konwerski set an informal goal of reaching 50 participants this year.
About 8 percent of GW seniors applied for the program this year, on par with past years. A final acceptance tally has not been released.
“I think at GW, we have a student body inspired to serve, with great passion and a track record for making a difference on campus, in the community and of course in the classroom,” Konwerski said. “As a result, this earlier set of deadlines does allow them to get a jump on making that commitment and forming a plan for their post-graduate experiences that involves choosing a public service career.”

“I saw my fate to my great affliction…” Robinson Crusoe explains in Daniel Defoe’s most famous novel when Crusoe finds himself alone. “That I was in an island environ’d every way with the sea, no land to be seen, except some rocks which lay a great way off.”
The theme of isolation is nothing new to our culture – society has wrestled with its implications for centuries. During the Renaissance, for example, to live outside the city walls meant you were an outcast and up to no good – literally living on the fringe of civilization.
So, when I found out last year that my roommate would be going abroad for the spring semester, I realized I was afraid to live by myself. I was terrified that I might turn into a hermit or a recluse.
But the stigma of living alone seems to be changing. According to a Feb. 4 New York Times op-ed, “One’s a Crowd,” 40 percent of all persons living in thriving American cities live alone. The author, Eric Klinenberg, explains how there has never been a time in history before now in which so many people have lived by themselves.
There are a lot of benefits to students who choose to live alone. It gives students more privacy than they would have living in traditional on-campus housing. And to my surprise, I have found that living alone has actually made me more social. Now that I do have a “place of my own,” I actually spend more time hanging out with friends than I ever have before in college.
It’s a shame that the only on-campus housing option entirely dedicated to students who want to live in singles is Mitchell Hall, an old building on the edge of campus that very few students identify as their first choice on housing applications. And who could blame them? Notorious for its worn-out facilities, Mitchell’s communal bath and shower rooms make it unappealing to most. While there are other on-campus dorms that offer singles, the chances of being placed in one are extremely slim. This usually leaves students who want to live alone with one option: moving off campus. But off-campus living can have its drawbacks too, such as dealing with a landlord, monthly rent and building problems that come with renting or owning property.
College life can be pandemonium. So many of us run from class to internships and jobs to clubs and then to the library to do homework. It’s so easy to get caught up in the vortex. It’s as though the things we have no time or space for are ourselves.
Don’t get me wrong. I’m not suggesting we all imitate Henry David Thoreau and withdraw from society, rid ourselves of material belongings, forget all debts and responsibilities and retreat to the woods. But I do think there is something to be said for having your own place where you can get away from all the commotion and stress that the day brings.
It’s an idea even Robinson Crusoe came to embrace on the island. “I changed both my sorrows and my joys,” the castaway muses. “My very desires alter’d, my affections changed their gusts, and my delights were perfectly new, from what they were at my first coming.”
Living alone doesn’t have to mean you are alone, and isolation is more often than not a source of clarity.

The University’s announcement in “Career services to specialize support, Feb. 16, p. 1” regarding additional investments in career services furthers our commitment to meet the needs of students.
By engaging alumni and employers while simultaneously strengthening our academic programs, career services will be the perfect nexus between student and academic life.
GW has exceptionally dedicated career services professionals, yet we realize there is a need to do more to support students. The model we are building strengthens alliances across all schools and programs, links curricular content with the co-curricular experience and harnesses the expertise of our faculty and academic advisors.
The recent expansion of career services created new individualized services and skill development support that will help prepare students to assume responsibility for directing their own career paths. This includes new niche career expositions for undergraduates and graduates targeted at emerging fields. The new undergraduate career services model will more directly connect a student’s major with industry specialization to foster a successful transition from school to the workplace. It will also provide career management skills that are essential in the workforce. Graduate students will see more focused student career services, with further specialization coupled with school-specific services.
These alignments between academics and the co-curricular experience have been proven to help graduates find employment. The new model will offer students enhanced connections with the alumni, parents and employers who are eager to support GW. It will also offer improved support for those seeking careers in interdisciplinary fields like sustainability, public service and government, entrepreneurship and globalization, all of which are central to the University’s strategic efforts.
At GW, we are fortunate to have a fully engaged Board of Trustees and a forward-thinking administration that all agree strengthening career services will enhance the student experience and the value of a GW education. We see that support in action with the establishment of the Career Services Advisory Council, which assembles career services leadership and expertise from across GW and engages student leaders to better coordinate projects and services that benefit the entire University. We will continue to seek input from critical stakeholders like the Student Association, the Parents’ Association Advisory Council, the Parents Campaign Philanthropy Board and the GW Alumni Association. We invite other interested stakeholders to join the conversation.
It is clear that GW’s emerging model puts a premium on personalized services and will establish a new leadership and management structure. We believe that the new career services model will serve our students well, as they put knowledge into action now and move into their future careers.
Peter Konwerski and John Richardson are the senior associate vice president and dean of students and the president of the Student Association, respectively.

Green is the new buff. At least it seems like it, now that the University has introduced a sustainability minor. This new minor is a cutting-edge model for how departments can collaborate and foster discussions and advance interdisciplinary education on an important global issue. These efforts to educate the student body on green initiatives demonstrate the University’s commitment to the environment despite being a city school.

Reports from University Police Department officers of sporadic radio coverage is concerning for student safety. Given that officers are unarmed, radios are their most important tools for relaying important campus safety information to the rest of the force. Officers must be able to respond to a potential campus emergency swiftly and effectively, and broken radios inhibit their ability to do so. This has been a problem for too long, as many officers have reported that these breakdowns have been occurring for more than a year.

The centennial celebration of the University’s move to Foggy Bottom is an exciting milestone for everyone at GW, and throughout February, the campus hosted informative lectures and events regarding Foggy Bottom and George Washington. But more could have been done – such as holding a rally or block party – to make this festival a more community-encompassing event. One hundred years in the heart of the nation’s capital is an exciting achievement, and the events unfortunately weren’t a reflection of this historic moment.

With 4,806 voters, this year’s Student Association election drew the largest student turnout in the 45-year history of the SA – a 15 percent increase from last year. We commend the Joint Elections Committee for its role in promoting student participation, with “get out the vote” efforts such as “Choose Your GW.”

Security guards posted in residential halls will no longer force GW students to be signed in by fellow students. Instead, the University has employed a system where students can enter other dorms by simply tapping their GWorld cards, as long as a resident taps his or her own card first. The policy change is a welcome response to a longtime student complaint, and it will hopefully eliminate unwanted traffic in residence hall lobbies. It also signifies that the University Police Department is cognizant of feedback on these matters, which is particularly important now, as safety and security questions in residence halls remain a principal student concern.

Last week, classes, student organization meetings and Valentine’s Day dates were interrupted by an outbreak of the Norovirus (see: debilitating 24-hour stomach illness). While there were at least 85 reported cases of the virus by Student Health Service, it seemed as though all of campus was bedridden for at least a few days. While the virus only occupied campus for about a week, memories of the havoc it wrought will remain immortalized on the hilarious Twitter account, @GWNorovirus.

The School of Engineering and Applied Science is looking to beat the odds after researchers reported in the journal “Science” this month that it would take 100 years to close the gender gap in science, technology, engineering and mathematics faculty.
Nationwide, about 27 percent of faculty in STEM subjects are women and it could take a century before that population reaches 50 percent, the Feb. 17 report found. Researchers said universities have hired female STEM faculty only incrementally over the past decade because of social expectations for women in the field and the obstacles of starting a family while fighting for tenure.
As the engineering school has gone on a hiring spree in the last few years, the University’s first vice provost for diversity and inclusion said targeting female candidates is the first step to reversing the trend.
Of the 80 professors in the engineering school this year, 10 are women – the widest gap of any school at GW. Three of the five department chairs in the engineering school are female.
“If we’re comparing ourselves to other institutions, we’re doing pretty well, but not as well as we want to,” Terri Reed, GW’s vice provost for diversity and inclusion, said.
Reed said all six of this year’s searches for faculty in the engineering school have had at least one female candidate in an effort to start balancing the number of female and male faculty members in the school.
The Council on Diversity and Inclusion, which University President Steven Knapp created in 2010, charged Reed with diversifying the faculty as one of five goals.
Engineering school dean David Dolling asked Reed to meet with all of his department heads in November to discuss diversity hiring practices, she said.
The University also put together an application to a $5 million National Science Foundation grant to help recruit and retain women in STEM fields. Reed said GW will hear back about the grant next month.
“Cultural change isn’t something that happens instantaneously,” Reed said. “I’m trying to be a champion and trying to hold the deans and department chairs accountable.”
Dolling declined to comment on the progress of the faculty searches, but said the school would pick the best candidate regardless of gender.
“I’m proud of the fact that there are women in all ranks of SEAS from assistant professors to an associate dean,” he said. “We strive to attract a diverse candidate pool. We hope, but can’t guarantee, that we will attract qualified female candidates.”
The engineering school has undergone a hiring boom in recent years, as the program seeks to raise its profile and boost its research portfolio. The school hired 32 faculty members the last two academic years and has initiated searches for six faculty members this year.
To bring in younger professors with blooming research credentials, the school offered buyout packages to the 39 faculty members – half of the school’s full-time faculty – in December 2009. Six professors accepted the buyout.
In their report, Deborah Kaminski and Cheryl Geisler highlighted several challenges universities have faced with holding onto women faculty in STEM fields. Kaminksi is a mechanical engineering professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Geisler is a dean of faculty at Simon Fraser University in Canada.
“Women don’t want to fight the tenure clock and the biological clock at the same time. Those who try to care for young children at the same time as striving for tenure are under intense pressure,” Kaminski said.
Kim Roddis, chair of the civil and environmental engineering department, said she had to choose between starting a family and attaining tenure when she taught at University of Kansas School of Engineering in the early 1990s.
“If I hadn’t been back on the eleventh day after I had my daughter, I could have been fired,” she said.
Roddis later was the first woman to attain tenure at the school.
The gender gap persists not because women are “less capable than men,” but because of social expectations, Shelly Heller, associate provost for the Mount Vernon Campus and a computer science professor in the engineering school, said.
The engineering school’s enrollment, 36 percent of which is female, lies above the national average for gender representation.
“In middle school or high school, girls are not encouraged to take the science and math courses that prepare them for an academic degree in the areas in college and beyond,” Heller said. “If there are not many women in your class, you are often the only woman on your team. It is not a very welcoming environment.”
