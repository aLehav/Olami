Wrighton's appointments fill a line of positions that have remained in limbo during the past several months, left empty by departures like Dana Bradley last fall, Mark Diaz last week and Jared Abramson this August.
Updated: July 12, 2022 at 3:10 p.m.
Interim University President Mark Wrighton announced a series of administrative hires Friday, splitting the position of CFO and executive vice president – previously held by Mark Diaz – between two newly appointed officials.
Bruno Fernandes, GW’s treasurer and vice president of finance, will add CFO to his job description, and University of Vermont General Counsel Sharon Reich Paulsen will serve as executive vice president and chief administration officer – a new position that will “oversee the leadership of administrative functions,” according to a release. Wrighton appointed interim vice president for human resource management and development and chief people officer Sabrina Minor to a permanent role and Ellen Moran as the permanent vice president of communications and marketing, which she also managed at the University of Pittsburgh.
“We are fortunate to benefit from a strong leadership team and the many staff who support our community and the university’s teaching and research,” Wrighton said in the release. “I look forward to the contributions our current and new leaders will bring to campus. This is another important step forward in our ability to achieve the university’s aspirations as we embark on our third century.”
The appointments fill a line of positions that have remained in limbo during the past several months, left empty by recent and upcoming departures like Chief People Officer Dana Bradley last fall, Diaz last week and Jared Abramson, the vice president of financial planning and operations, this August.
The vice president of communications and marketing became mired in controversy after former University President Thomas LeBlanc tapped Heather Swain for the role in 2020 despite her involvement in the Larry Nassar sexual abuse case at Michigan State University. Swain withdrew her acceptance of the job days later, and interim vice presidents have since gone on to fill the position – most recently Stacey DiLorenzo, who previously worked as the executive dean of external relations for the Milken Institute School of Public Health.
Wrighton’s newly created administrative position – the CAO, which he formed after consulting faculty, administrators and trustees – will have oversight across financial operations, human resources and safety and facilities, the release states. Paulsen, who join GW in August, will also manage GW Information Technology with Provost Chris Bracey and help create “financial plans and budgets” for the University in collaboration with the provost and CFO, according to the release.
“I look forward to working collaboratively with President Wrighton, Provost Bracey, faculty, staff and University leadership to help ensure that the University can broaden even further its global impact and reputation as it embarks on its third century of educating tomorrow’s leaders and engaging in research, scholarship and service that betters our world,” Paulsen said in the release.
Fernandes, who has worked at GW for more than a year, will lead GW’s financial operations carrying experience as D.C.’s former treasurer and deputy chief financial officer. Fernandes spearheaded negotiations with Metro officials last year to secure the U-Pass program for the University.
He started in his expanded role as GW’s CFO earlier this month, according to the release.
“I am pleased to serve in this leadership role and grateful to continue working with the many team members who manage the University’s financial resources and help us support GW’s mission and community,” he said.
Moran previously served as the White House communications director under the Obama administration and will start her new job at GW in August.
“GW’s more than 200 years of teaching, research and service – and the impact its students, faculty, staff and alumni have locally, nationally and globally – make joining this community an exciting opportunity,” Moran said in the release. “I look forward to working with the creative and dedicated teams in communications and marketing, and to partnering with stakeholders across the university to share and amplify GW’s many important contributions to the world.”
The release states Minor, who started earlier this month, will now oversee the performance management of Human Resource Management and Development, employee relations, staffing and service. Wrighton said Minor has been a voice for faculty and staff to GW’s leadership team since she joined GW in 2013.
“Our people are core to everything we do at GW,” Minor said. “I am delighted to continue to lead the HRMD teams to attract new employees, retain current employees and bring together faculty and staff to fulfill our mission and goals.”

This post was updated to correct the following:
Due to an editing mistake, a previous version of this story incorrectly spelled Stacey DiLorenzo’s name. It is now spelled correctly. We regret this error.

The DC CAN exposure system - a cellphone alert for individuals that notifies them when they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive - will remain in effect.
Washington D.C. ended its COVID-19 contact tracing program last week after a recent uptake in take-home tests as total cases begin to wane.
The D.C. Contact Trace Force, a 151-member team that has been notifying D.C. residents of COVID-19 exposures since the onset of the pandemic, laid off 131 employees and dissolved itself due to the District’s low case numbers and a rise in take-home tests, which often go unreported. The DC CAN exposure system – a cellphone alert for individuals that notifies them when they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive – will remain in effect.
GW’s contact tracing remains active and will continue to notify close contacts to positive COVID-19 cases, according to GW’s Coronavirus Response website.
The District had a 105.7 case rate per 100,000 people as of last Thursday, according to the CDC website. D.C.’s COVID-19 community level is also listed as “low,” meaning residents can take minimal preventative measures like staying up to date with vaccines and boosters, according to the CDC website.
The University had 137 positive cases from June 27 to July 5 and an overall 5.39 percent 7-day case positivity rate, according to the GW COVID-19 dashboard.
This month, GW ended its asymptomatic testing requirement and ceased operations at the medical trailer, according to an email sent to community members. Officials said that testing will still be available at 1957 E Street, Monroe Hall and the Science and Engineering Hall.

Metro stated that the current temporary removal will help prevent a “backlog” issue that they experienced last week. 
The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority announced that they withdrew the 7000-series trains from the tracks for inspections Wednesday.
Officials said in a tweet that the train cars would be removed for “a couple of days this week” while they adjust the cars for inspections. WMATA reinstated the 7000-series rail cars, which make up about 60% of the fleet, in June after they removed the cars from the tracks last October due to a train car derailment that forced WMATA to investigate the safety of the trains.
Metro stated that the current temporary removal will help prevent a “backlog” issue that they experienced last week. They said that the 7000-series removal would not “impact service levels for customers.”
During their original railcar assessment, investigators found defects on the railcars that were considered “out of compliance.” The months-long repair project led to long wait times and nearly 30-minute departure intervals for riders.

The data from the report shows that GW heavily relies on biomedical and health publications, which make up more than half of GW’s published research.
The University’s international scientific influence fell to an all-time low in global rankings released in late June.
GW ranked 415th out of more than 1,300 institutions from around the world – its lowest ranking since at least 2011 – in this year’s annual CWTS Leiden Rankings, which is an international ranking of universities’ research that is published by Leiden University in the Netherlands. The Leiden Ranking system counts the number of scientific publications from each university and shows how many of those are in the top 10 percent most frequently cited in their given field to measure the institution’s scientific influence.
GW has fallen in the Leiden rankings over the past few years, ranking at 392 in 2020 and after placing closer to 280 about a decade ago. The University released more than 3,500 scientific publications between 2017 and 2020 in different research areas, with 431 of them considered in the top 10 percent of publications, according to the rankings.
Seven out of the University’s 12 peer institutions outperformed GW on the list, with New York University, University of Pittsburgh and the University of Southern California ranked 100 or higher, but Georgetown and Wake Forest universities lagged behind at 609th and 525th, respectively.
Despite the number of publications GW puts out compared to its peers, only four of GW’s peer institutions – Boston University, Tufts University, the University of Southern California and the University of Rochester – put out a higher percentage of publications considered in the top 10 percent most prestigious in their fields, according to the rankings.
The data from the report also shows that GW heavily relies on biomedical and health publications, which make up more than half of GW’s published research, and the closest second – social sciences and humanities – account for less than a quarter of the remaining research, according to the data.

GW’s decision to shift classes online, shutter dorms and close its campus in spring 2020 marked the end of student life as we knew it. But for student-athletes, the University’s decision to cut seven varsity sports over pandemic-related financial concerns was truly the straw that broke the camel’s back. Continuing to compete as club teams, some of the athletes who lost their varsity status haven’t just survived – they’ve thrived, seizing victory on the national stage even as they support themselves without GW’s help. With the worst of the pandemic seemingly behind us, restoring varsity status to standout programs, like the highly competitive co-ed sailing team, would demonstrate GW’s faith in athletics and reinvigorate school spirit among fans.
Alongside men’s rowing, men’s and women’s squash, men’s indoor track, men’s tennis and women’s water polo, sailing lost its varsity status after the 2020-2021 season. But the sailing program – now a club team – is a prime example of how non-varsity teams are still succeeding. In its final varsity season in the spring of 2021, GW’s sailing team finished 10th in the nation. Despite competing without the University’s support, sailing has only continued its dominance on the water.
During its first season as a club in 2022, the Inter-collegiate Sailing Association allowed the team to compete at the varsity level while athletes juggled their own management and finances as University funding dried up. That left the sailing team responsible for filling the financial gap with alumni donations and newly-created membership fees to make up some of the difference. While their competitors enjoyed the guidance of experienced, paid professionals all year, GW’s sailors relied on the expertise of current and former team members. Without sufficient financial support from GW to pay a coach or other staff, tasks like buying equipment, scheduling practices and arranging travel fell to student leaders on the team.
And yet, they qualified for the 2022 College National Sailing Championship in New Orleans after finishing first in the regional tournament in the fall of 2021. While GW’s sailors scrambled for resources to fund their expenses, their predominantly varsity competition had focused solely on sailing all season – their colleges would completely compensate them for their trips to the championship.
To say that the Colonials were operating at a competitive disadvantage that weekend – and that their disadvantage stemmed directly from GW’s decision to cut their funding – would be an understatement. As proven in the story of “Moneyball,” if scoreboards read teams’ budgets rather than their abbreviations, then the outcome should have been obvious. But GW finished the season ranked 12th in the nation among all competing schools in the Intercollegiate Sailing Association, earning their position as the best club team in the country.
Other former varsity teams haven’t been as lucky. Despite finishing 13th at the International Rowing Association National Championship in its final season, ranking seventh overall in the country and receiving funding from alumni, GW’s men’s rowing team was also terminated in 2020. Unable to compete as a club team, the men’s rowing’s reinstatement is riding on the outcome of a lawsuit that the team’s former captain filed against the University. GW’s decision to sacrifice this prestigious team has jeopardized the careers of student-athletes who were excited to compete for GW.
It’s time the University rethinks the future of its prestigious former varsity teams. While sailing may not have generated the $6.2 million that men’s and women’s basketball combined to bring home in 2021, the co-ed team’s expenses were equal to its revenue by the end of the same season. The team even maintained zero athletic scholarships compared to the 195 University athletes who received nearly $12 million worth of student aid from GW in 2021.
But officials shouldn’t evaluate these programs just on whether they make a profit or offsets their costs. GW should also recognize the value of its highly successful athletics programs on campus and fund them accordingly. Restoring some of the nation’s most talented sailors to the varsity level would be a golden opportunity to unite the student body over the shared success of their classmates. A winning team can rally its supporting community, but stripping teams of their varsity status sets a poor example for potential fans. It takes support from the top down to build a sense of community around athletics. The University should seize the opportunity to reinstate the sailing team’s varsity status and celebrate its success.
GW only has to look as far as the Potomac River to find members of a powerhouse program practicing to play at the sport’s highest level – and winning. Building a winning culture on campus is not an easy task, but GW’s sailing team shows that dedicated student-athletes deserve the support of the University and their community.

Housed under a bright red awning, what sets Jumbo Slice Pizza apart from other Adams Morgan jumbo slice shops is the crust of its slices.
D.C. may not be known for its pizza as much as your classic “pizza cities” of the Northeast, like New York and New Haven, but the District has what others don’t. The jumbo slice.
The jumbo slice is, appropriately, a comically large slice of pizza, often measuring more than a foot in length. The slices are especially popular and prominent in Adams Morgan, though jumbo slice shops are spread throughout the District, each with variations of slice style and size, and all open late into the night to capitalize on the city’s bustling nightlife.
We visited five jumbo slice pizza shops across Adams Morgan and the rest of the District in an attempt to find the best jumbo slice D.C. has to offer.

5. DuPont’s Pizza, DuPont Circle
Proudly proclaiming to produce New York style and jumbo slice pizza, DuPont’s Pizza presents a unique slice that combines appealing aspects of signature pizzas from the Big Apple and the District.
The slice at DuPont’s Pizza ($5 for cheese, $6 for pepperoni) is one of its kind in the jumbo slice world – the slice’s size comes from its width instead of length, essentially smashing two or three thin-crusted New York-style slices together. The pizza has the distinctive New York taste, with minimal sauce, a thin crust and heavy cheese, all to serve up a jumbo slice fit for a full meal.
While nearly tripling a typical New York-style slice may be too much pizza for some, DuPont’s Pizza can satisfy the cravings of northeasterners in a jumbo style.
2004 P St NW, 11 a.m. to 12 a.m. Sunday through Wednesday, 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. Thursday, 11 a.m. to 4 a.m. Friday and Saturday.
4. Pizza Mart, Adams Morgan
The first place to ever use the term “jumbo slice pizza,” Pizza Mart is located in the heart of Adams Morgan, easily noticeable by its crumbling yet emboldened bright green and red paint.
Beyond the history, Pizza Mart still provides a memorably classic jumbo slice. The pizza was covered with ample pepperoni and cheese, and while lacking in sauce, the other aspects still ensure a distinct flavor. The crust is drenched in grease from top to bottom, revealing that greasiness has been a characteristic of the jumbo slice from the start.
While Pizza Mart’s slice may not be the best Adams Morgan has to offer, its conspicuous exterior and history in the jumbo slice scene make it a worthy spot for a late-night visit.
2445 18th St NW, 11 a.m. to 3 a.m. Monday through Thursday, 11 a.m. to 4 a.m. Friday and Saturday, 1 p.m. to 3 a.m. Sunday
3. Pizza Movers and Calzones, Georgetown
Located on Wisconsin Avenue and proudly proclaiming itself as the “First Jumbo Slice Ever in Georgetown,” Pizza Movers serves pizza oozing with flavor in a neighborhood lacking other jumbo slice options.
Pizza Movers’ slice is pre-prepared and hastily reheated upon ordering, with any toppings tossed on at the last minute, making them prone to slipping right off. The slice is covered with puddles of grease that will get all over your hands, pizza box, and in my case, notebook.
The slice is delicious. The blend of cheese between the baked cheese mixture and the recently melted mozzarella coats the pizza, while the greasiness creates a strong flavor that is undeniably delectable in the moment. The cheese slice costs $6.59, and the pepperoni costs $7.69.
Pizza Movers takes many of the traits that make jumbo slice pizza great and dials them up an extra notch, and while that can certainly be overwhelming to the taste buds – and overly greasy to the hands – this slice is the best option when out late at night afar from Adams Morgan.
1618 Wisconsin Ave NW, 11 a.m. to 2:30 a.m. Monday through Wednesday, 11 a.m. to 3:30 a.m. Thursday and Sunday, 11 a.m. to 4:30 a.m. Friday and Saturday
2. Jumbo Slice Pizza, Adams Morgan
Jumbo Slice Pizza presents perhaps the closest image to what one imagines when they hear the words “jumbo slice pizza shop.”
Housed under a bright red awning, what sets Jumbo Slice Pizza apart from other Adams Morgan jumbo slice shops is the crust of its slices. Jumbo Slice Pizza offers thick, doughy crusts that add more flavor to the slice and fill up anyone eating it. The cheese and pepperoni have a slight bake to them, while still fresh enough for an enjoyable experience. Cheese slices cost $7, and pepperoni cost $8.
Jumbo Slice Pizza’s slice epitomizes the late-night indulgence and bold taste people crave from the classic jumbo slice.
2341 18th St NW, 7 p.m. to 2:30 a.m. Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday; 7 p.m. to 3:30 a.m. Friday and Saturday
1. Bestolli Pizza/Pizza Boli’s, Adams Morgan
Located just a few steps away from Pizza Mart, Bestolli Pizza – also known as Pizza Boli’s – provides the best jumbo slice experience with a unique slice, late hours and cheap prices.
Bestolli’s jumbo slice takes the mantra that bigger – or in this case, jumbo – is always better. The charred, thin, New Haven-style crust is covered with copious amounts of sauce, cheese and pepperoni, so much so that as you eat your slice, toppings will almost be certain to flop off. The crust provides a taste closer to matzo than what one might expect from pizza crust. The cheese is greasy and bubbly, mimicking the New York style that many jumbo slice shops seek to emulate. Bestolli’s cheese slice costs $6, and the pepperoni slice costs $7.
Even though it is not as well known as other Adams Morgan jumbo slice joints, Bestolli Pizza’s unique combination of New Haven-style crust and New York-style toppings makes it an ideal spot for jumbo slice lovers.
2455 18th St NW, 10 a.m. to 2:45 a.m. Sunday through Thursday, 10 a.m. to 3:45 a.m. Friday and Saturday

From F Street House to Pennsylvania Avenue, this week’s headlines all have one thing in common – politics and power. In two moves that should leave District residents healthier and wealthier, the D.C. Council and Mayor Muriel Bowser expanded access to medical marijuana and raised the city’s minimum wage.
Meanwhile, the aspiring politicians of the Student Association are facing the aftermath of an attempt to force SA President Christian Zidouemba from office. And University President Mark Wrighton’s response to students’ demands to fire U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas leaves room for improvement.
Here’s the best and worst of this week’s headlines:
Thumbs Up: 
Mayor Bowser signed into law Wednesday a bill that the D.C. Council unanimously approved last week allowing D.C. residents over the age of 21 to “self-certify” their need for medical marijuana after passing a similar bill in February for patients over the age of 65 to self-certify. The legislation makes it easier for D.C. residents to obtain medical marijuana, particularly those without the time or finances to get a doctor’s recommendation to do so.
The ability to self-certify also marks a de facto expansion of recreational marijuana in the District without any explicit enforcement mechanism in place for the self-medication process and subsequent marijuana use. Whether they’re looking for medical or – “medical” – marijuana, customers going through legal dispensaries could drive business away from the unregulated shops of the District’s cannabis gray market while the sale of recreational marijuana remains illegal. This bill seems like a good step forward to basically legalizing recreational marijuana, albeit with extra steps. And with any luck, and perhaps D.C. statehood – which would allow the District to determine its own laws without federal oversight – recreational marijuana can actually become legal.
As of last Friday, D.C.’s minimum wage increased from $15.20 to $16.10 per hour for non-tipped employees, including GW’s student employees. “The Fight for $15 didn’t end at $15,” Bowser said in a press release last week, and it’s reassuring to see her following through with these changes after she approved the Fair Shot Minimum Wage in 2016.
But hourly pay for tipped employees, like waiters and bartenders, only increased from $5.05 to $5.35 per hour. That’s certainly better than the federal minimum tipped wage of $2.13, though it’s not enough to make a living – the slight increase in tipping for some workers during the COVID-19 pandemic may be waning with a recent increase in inflation. Fortunately, D.C. residents will have the chance to raise the tipped minimum wage further to $16.10 per hour when they vote on Initiative 82 this November.
Thumbs Down: 
The U.S. House committee on Jan. 6 isn’t the only legislature in town investigating threats to our democracy – and that’s the problem. Members of the Student Association seem to be taking themselves a little too seriously after an attempt to oust SA President Christian Zidouemba from office. But after two nights of testimony before the SA Senate, it seems like Zidouemba will continue in his position. Members of the SA’s executive cabinet voted last Friday to permanently remove Zidouemba from his position and appoint Vice President Yan Xu in his place in an acting capacity. But not so fast – Xu and Communications Director Aiza Saeed retracted their votes, and a wave of resignations followed as Zidouemba retained the presidency. SA members allege that Zidouemba’s mishandling of an open letter calling on officials to fire U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas from GW was the last straw in a line of poor leadership marked by a “hostile” work environment and threats of termination.
The SA is ostensibly meant to distribute funds to GW’s hundreds of clubs, represent the student body and work with officials to achieve concrete goals like expanding SafeRide or bringing U-Pass to GW – not dive headfirst into an embarrassing power struggle. I’m not sure what this achieved beyond making more students equally tired of and amused by the SA’s sophomoric, overgrown student council antics. It’s summer – don’t they have something better to do?
Looking toward more mature leadership, Wrighton shared his thoughts about the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade last month with the GW community in an email Friday. Describing it as a “significant moment in history,” he stated, “As president of our University, I believe it is important to recognize this pain and share the University’s support for women and for all members of our community.”
I’m glad that someone is finally recognizing how the Supreme Court’s decision has affected students, staff, faculty and alumni, but that support – which Wrighton said officials would soon share – has yet to materialize. What’s the delay? The court’s decision leaked in early May, and The Hatchet’s editorial board soon after called on the University to help students through institutional resources like Counseling and Psychological Services and the Office of Advocacy and Support. Officials have had plenty of time to craft statements and develop GW’s response in a way that puts this community first – here’s hoping we hear something soon.

Jon Kay is a rising junior majoring in international affairs and philosophy. After U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas voted to overturn Roe v. Wade last month, Kay started a petition calling on GW to remove him from GW Law where he serves as a professional lecturer. Officials rejected the petition, which accumulated more than 6,000 signatures at the time, out of concern for maintaining academic freedom on campus. The petition has since gained 10,000 signatures in total.
After the U.S. Supreme Court voted to overturn Roe v. Wade last month, I started a petition calling on officials to remove Justice Clarence Thomas from his position at GW. Thomas is a professional lecturer at GW’s law school, but his willingness to strip me and my classmates of our rights, his ties to political extremism and his flawed ethics give cause for his firing from the University. Instead of representing a commitment to academic freedom, continuing to employ Thomas demonstrates officials’ disregard for the students they preside over. Despite officials’ rejection of the demands for him to be fired, more than 10,000 supporters still agree that Thomas must go to maintain both GW’s prestige and its commitment to the health and well-being of its students.
In his concurring opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, Thomas welcomed opportunities to overturn decisions that granted Americans basic human rights that are the hallmarks of a functioning democracy, like access to contraception and the freedom to love who and how they want. Thomas didn’t just help overturn Roe – he has made it clear that his work will continue until he demolishes the rights of queer people and people with wombs, including those who attend GW. In 1993, Thomas even reportedly told his law clerks that he hoped to make the lives of liberals “miserable.” Whether you agree or disagree with Thomas’s judicial philosophy, using his position to attack his political opponents is no model for aspiring lawyers to follow.
Beyond his vendetta and disastrous rulings, Thomas’ troublesome conduct on the bench extends to his association with the plotters of Jan. 6. After the 2020 presidential election, Thomas’ wife, Ginni, communicated with lawyer John Eastman – an attorney for former President Donald Trump who spoke at the rally preceding the attack on the Capitol, which she also attended – White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Arizona lawmakers about overturning the election. Yet Thomas has not recused himself from any of the cases related to the insurrection, and he was the sole dissenting vote against releasing Trump’s presidential records to the members of Congress investigating Jan. 6. Thomas’ failure to uphold even the most basic of voluntary ethics rules is embarrassing. His utter silence about the potential role he and his wife played in the violence on Jan. 6 – just minutes from the Foggy Bottom Campus – suggests he views the law as a means to facilitate his ideological agenda and protect himself and those close to him from the consequences of their actions.
Officials know students, faculty and alumni are outraged with Thomas’ continued presence at the University. Provost Chris Bracey and GW Law Dean Dayna Bowen Matthew emphasized in an announcement last week that Thomas’ opinions “do not represent” GW’s values as an institution. Yes, GW doesn’t explicitly endorse the wide range of views among its faculty. But gesturing toward academic freedom, as Bracey and Matthew did to defend their inaction, wrongly assumes that Thomas is capable of fairly and effectively educating his students. As long as his disdain for the rights of LGBTQ+ Americans and his self-serving judicial philosophy can find their way into the classroom, he does not belong on our campus, and the University’s silence isn’t neutral.
I don’t agree with Clarence Thomas on much of anything – it’s no secret that he’s the most consistently conservative member of the Supreme Court. But if this were a disagreement between two private citizens over differences in opinion, no matter how reprehensible those opinions are, that’s where this argument would stop. Yet Thomas doesn’t have opinions like I or my peers do – his words carry the force of law on the bench, and they’re inseparable from how LGBTQ+ and other students experience his class and his presence on campus.
Continuing to employ Thomas tells students that they can and should debate their identity with the same person that has spent his entire judicial career trying to criminalize their existence. My existence is not up for debate. GW does and should allow its students and faculty to express a wide array of beliefs without fear of punishment, but Thomas’ beliefs are beyond the pale. How do you look someone in the eye and debate them on whether you deserve the right to exist when they just threatened to take that right away from you? How do you take their class and pretend that your professor didn’t just make your life infinitely more dangerous at home? Worse still, GW’s implicit approval of Thomas’ behavior under the umbrella of “academic freedom” will embolden homophobic and misogynistic hate groups to harass students affected by his rulings. Come fall, the environment officials have created will make life more unsafe for and facilitate discrimination against its most vulnerable students.
It takes courage to fire a professor who also happens to be a sitting Supreme Court justice, and under normal circumstances, it would be stupid to do so. But these aren’t normal circumstances, and Clarence Thomas isn’t a normal Supreme Court justice. The University can find other high-profile, experienced and even conservative jurists who respect our democracy and respect their students.
I started this petition because I believe the University can institute meaningful change. President Mark Wrighton said GW’s role is to support the “health and safety” of its community. Thomas’ continued employment is an impediment to that health and safety. He has made it his legal mission to cause immense and unprecedented harm to the country and his students. Will GW watch as the court, with Thomas leading the way, strips the rights of their students, staff, faculty and alumni? Or will they muster up the courage to fire Thomas and demonstrate that they value the people they house, educate and protect?

SA Vice President Yan Xu and Director of Communications Aiza Saeed withdrew their removal votes of Zidouemba in separate emails to the chief justice last weekend. 
After a weekend filled with presidential chaos, eight witnesses testified in the Student Association Senate’s special session Tuesday and Wednesday night, with some saying that SA President Christian Zidouemba created a “hostile” work environment and raised cabinet members’ concerns over his capacity to complete his duties.
Senators called for an emergency session of the senate to shed light on the executive power struggle after executive cabinet members unanimously voted to remove Zidouemba last Friday, a decision that they have since revoked after two cabinet members withdrew their removal votes, leaving Zidouemba as the de facto president. The featured witnesses offered various explanations for the incident, ranging from miscommunication and confusion to mistrust of Zidouemba’s ability to carry out his role.
Dylan Basescu, a witness and the former legislator general, said he was concerned that Zidouemba would “hurriedly fire” cabinet members involved in Friday’s removal vote, which required the vice president, treasurer, legislator general, communications director and the chief of staff to vote for removal unanimously.
“I heard from other members that they were concerned that Christian was issuing either veiled or explicit threats to fire them,” he said.
Some executive cabinet members testified that they felt pressured to vote to remove Zidouemba from office during Friday’s cabinet meeting and, if given the choice again, would not have voted to remove Zidouemba. SA Vice President Yan Xu and Director of Communications Aiza Saeed withdrew their removal votes in separate emails to the chief justice this weekend.
Zidouemba said during the meeting’s presidential report that he wanted cabinet members to express their opinions in a respectful environment free from the threat of termination.
“I have never intended to fire anybody in my cabinet,” Zidouemba said. “And I have always appreciated the different views that I have in my cabinet.”
The incident resulted in at least seven members of the SA’s executive branch resigning, including Basescu and former Chief of Staff Cordelia Scales, who both voted to remove Zidouemba from the presidency, and who other witnesses also alleged coordinated the removal vote.
The senate’s special session meeting comes after community members called on officials to fire Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas from his duties as a GW adjunct faculty member after he voted to overturn Roe v. Wade and repeal federal abortion protections. Officials rejected their petition and doubled down on his employment status, which prompted SA members and student leaders to sign and release a letter urging officials to “rethink” their decision not to fire Thomas.
Edyth Koenigs, a witness and a former senior policy advisor, said she did not force anyone, including Zidouemba, to sign the open letter sent to the University administration in response to the University’s decision to retain Thomas on the faculty.
They added that Zidouemba was “condescending” toward cabinet members and threatened to terminate them.
“I believe it’s an abuse of power,” they said.
Scales, a witness and a former chief of staff, said she hoped to bring “harmony” between governing branches in her role. They said Zidouemba called two mandatory emergency cabinet meetings to discuss the open letter and the Thomas decision with less than 24 hours’ notice.
“I understand that in situations, there are crises, but I also understand that respect goes both ways,” they said. “And the respect of cabinet members’ time is very important.”
Scales said Zidouemba’s “increasingly erratic behavior” and threats of termination caused the removal vote.
“We felt that it was like a time bomb,” they said.
Keanu Rowe, a witness and the current chief of staff, said he did not receive any correspondence about the removal vote until the morning after it happened.
Rowe said he thought future cabinets should delineate an assistant or deputy chief of staff to make a potential Article 15 vote clearer.
He added that to his knowledge that prior to the Friday vote, no one questioned Zidouemba’s capacity to act as president.
“Christian won this past election off of a platform of community-minded leadership and advocating for the underrepresented here at GW,” he said. “Thus far he has upheld his promise and has put the greater good of students at the top of his agenda.”
Two witnesses did not appear to testify. Maddie Billet, the former executive secretary of advocacy, and Sakhshi Sharma, the former executive secretary of diversity, equity and inclusion, did not attend the meeting.
Senators originally planned to vote on the Cabinet Statement Override Act, which would have certified Zidouemba as the legitimate president, but after an hourlong, private executive session during Wednesday’s meeting, the legislation’s sponsor, Ian Ching, ESIA-U, removed the legislation from the docket.
Student Court Chief Justice Devin Eager said the court is not currently deliberating on the legitimacy of the removal vote because no one has filed a lawsuit.
“These events caused great confusion and undue controversy,” he said. “At times, people were unsure who the current president of the Student Association was.”
