Walk-in appointments at the University Counseling Center jumped 42 percent this spring, an increase its new director said helps students as they wait to be assigned to a counselor or in emergency situations.
A total of 262 walk-in appointments were recorded this spring, compared to 76 walk-ins made in spring 2012.
UCC director Silvio Weisner said while students had not been turned away in the past if they walked in with an urgent need, the center could now see walk-ins for 20 or 30-minute sessions within about an hour.
The two counselors now on duty for walk-ins and phone assessments during business hours comprise a major piece of its new director’s plan to increase access. The change comes after students last fall reported waiting up to one month for an in-person session.
Weisner said almost 90 percent of students waited fewer than three weeks to be assigned to a counselor, after an initial assessment, so far this academic year.
He added that since he arrived at the counseling center in September, most students had their first session – an initial assessment that is typically held over the phone – within 24 hours.
Weisner, who was hired away from nearby Marymount University in Maryland last fall, said the center is working toward a same-day system for all students seeking those first appointments, compared to past years when students sometimes waited up to a week for prescheduled phone sessions.
He announced last week the center’s “mostly successful” 24-hour assessment period alongside a handful of other changes he’s overseen in his seven months at GW.
The counseling center has seen an uptick in appointments in the two years since giving students six free sessions per semester, as well as cutting fees for group sessions.
To implement more than a dozen recommendations from a University-wide review of the center last year, Weisner brought three staffers into leadership roles this year, one of whom started Monday at GW. The center’s assistant and associate director roles include training and education, outreach and prevention and clinical services ­– three areas highlighted by last year’s review.
He began whittling down the waitlist by allowing for a walk-in option and freeing up staff hours for appointments, and said the staff is also focusing on increasing trainings for staff members and faculty around the University, assessing visitor experiences through surveys and reviving the center’s graduate student training program.
As staff tweak procedures, Weisner said he would constantly crunch numbers and look at evaluations.
Senior Associate Dean of Students Mark Levine, who has overseen the UCC for several years, said GW has previously tracked the way students request appointments, how long they have to wait and who that student is.
This summer, staff will dig into a comprehensive, data-driven review and examine “all aspects of the center,” Weisner said.
Students will be asked to fill out surveys this fall, evaluating everything from the friendliness of the front desk staff to the types of skills they gained during their sessions.
“I’m a very data-driven person and I believe you can use data to help implement positive changes,” Weisner said, adding that data can help confirm what the center is doing well and what needs improvement. “We’re looking for as much and as varied data as we can possibly get about students’ experiences.”
Administrators have scrutinized the counseling center over the last year after allegations surfaced in November 2011 from multiple counselors who said they left the center because of previous leadership. Director John Dages resigned in December, followed two months later by associate director Barbara Brown.
Weisner noted that he has observed strong staff morale, and said no counselors left under his leadership.
Weisner is also advancing an idea pitched by the University’s counseling review team last year to reintroduce a graduate student training center.
He said the University will likely begin recruiting for its graduate student program next year, and is planning to admit students in the fall of 2014. The center currently hires post-doctoral students working on their licensing accreditation, and has not taught graduate students for nearly a decade.
The students would be brought in as full-time interns to work alongside the center’s staff, which Weisner said would keep staff “energized and motivated.”

The first explosion went off at about 2:50 p.m. Monday.
Then there was a second blast. Reports of injuries followed. Pictures taken from iPhones and security cameras showed, in real time, the chaos that ensued at the finish line.
Students at GW were far away from the tragic events up the coast in Boston. But there was a sense of close connection, even from hundreds of miles away, as we watched the rush of Tweets and Facebook posts throughout the afternoon and into the night.
The University community learned about the catastrophe minute-by-minute, watching from the District. And despite the distance, we felt a sense of attachment to the events and the victims, trying to make sense of the chaos.
Whether you have family in Boston or friends who were at the marathon Monday afternoon, all Americans – and even members of the international community – were touched by this event. And when the effects of the tragedy came to the District as the White House heightened security, the chill on campus was that much more palpable.
Tuesday and Wednesday, news outlets reported that letters sent to both President Barack Obama and lawmakers on Capitol Hill contained ricin, a poisonous substance.
Three people were killed at the Boston Marathon, and the number of injuries climbs as authorities learn more. How do you respond to tragedies that, though located in a single city, rock an entire nation?
Students at GW who struggle with the ramifications of the bombings should know that they can find comfort and security at the University Counseling Center.
And in the coming days and weeks, students, faculty and administrators should be especially vigilant and take advantage of the CARE network, through which they can identify students who might be struggling emotionally.
The unfortunate events in Boston were an act of terror. The perpetrators were trying to instill fear in the hearts of all Americans.
There’s no way to go back and change what happened. But the American people, especially in Boston, will rebound.
In a press briefing Tuesday afternoon, President Barack Obama described the resilience of the American public.
“What the world saw yesterday in the aftermath of the explosions were stories of heroism and kindness, and generosity and love,” he said. “Exhausted runners who kept running to the nearest hospital to give blood, and those who stayed to tend to the wounded, some tearing off their own clothes to make tourniquets. The first responders who ran into the chaos to save lives.”
As the days pass, we hope intelligence officials will begin to piece the details together in pursuit of justice so families and friends will begin to find closure.
In the meantime, we will find solace in one another. We will mourn together.

When I was a sophomore in high school, my Spanish teacher would blame any mistake I made – mispronouncing a word, arriving late to class, fudging my homework – on the mere fact that I was a sophomore.
“You’re in your sophomore slump,” she would remind me, as if my shortcomings in learning a language directly correlated with my second-year status.
But now, as I finish my sophomore year in college and look back at my time as an undergraduate thus far, I finally realize that my teacher might have had a point. Strangely, I didn’t find the clarity I thought I would in college.
Sophomore year is a transitional time. A second-year student is neither just beginning nor almost finished. My position between those landmarks has left me thinking a lot about what it means to be a college student.
But I have more questions now than when I started.
I’ve picked my major, but have I chosen the most marketable one? I love my friends, but what if I had met a different group of people? What if I stuck with my original plan and went to a small liberal arts college in the Pennsylvania cornfields or the New York Catskills?
And sometimes, I question the very questions themselves.
Should I spend so much time reflecting? Isn’t that, in and of itself, a poor use of seconds and minutes?
As college students, we all have high expectations about how our time should be spent. We’ve convinced ourselves that any free minute should be devoted to an internship, and that if we don’t take a full course load, we must have a work-study job. And if we spend a Saturday night doing anything other than drinking at a fraternity party or meeting a potential future spouse at a club, then we’ve wasted a social opportunity.
That’s the conventional wisdom. But because these expectations are so tremendous, it’s quite often that they are never fully achieved.
As a resident of JBKO Hall, I thought that over the course of the year, I’d witness a massive hole in the ground outside my window slowly but surely turn into the largest academic building on campus.
I was apprehensive that loud, early morning construction at the site of the future Science and Engineering Hall would cut my sleep schedule short, but I tried to assuage my concerns, thinking optimistically that at least I would have an interesting perspective on the state of the construction project.
But we all know that only minor visible strides were made. There’s still nothing there but a massive hole in the ground.
Granted, the project isn’t slated for completion until 2015, but my unrealistically high expectations led me to believe there would be more tangible progress. I thought there would be monumental changes I’d be able to observe this year.
High expectations are great, because setting goals is, of course, the first step toward achieving them. But it doesn’t mean that we will get anywhere near mission accomplished. And it certainly doesn’t mean we will walk away from every experience knowing where we’ve been and where we must go next.
So if there’s one thing I’ve learned this April, as I prepare to move from my second year to my third year as an undergraduate, it is to accept that an overflow of questions is okay.
There’s nothing wrong with not quite knowing what remains to be achieved. In fact, not knowing is the norm.
So call it the sophomore slump if you want, but something tells me that these questions will last beyond just one academic year.

Within the next week, the University plans to announce a new librarian for Gelman Library, after the former leader stepped down last summer.
Gelman is a campus centerpiece. It’s the crossroads of all academic pursuits at GW for thousands of students, faculty and administrators every day.
But despite its location at the heart of campus and the critical role it plays in students’ and professors’ lives, consultants said in March that Gelman is lacking when it comes to resources and staff.
To most of us, this isn’t news. Gelman has a long history of being underfunded. The library’s budget has remained stagnant at $4 million for the past decade.
During midterms and final exams, it’s nearly impossible to find a place to sit and study at Gelman. Last week, the library closed twice because temperatures reached unbearable levels after the cooling system broke. Students have come to jokingly refer to it as “GelHell.” It’s a joke, but truth wears a smile.
And on top of that, the consultants said this semester that Gelman barely counts as a research library, so it isn’t even a functional academic facility.
So that’s why it’s essential that the library’s new leader assumes the role of Gelman’s chief lobbyist, making sure that these issues are resolved.
The University invested $16 million for renovations to the first and second floors of the aging building, which will include a new entrance from Kogan Plaza. But these changes are largely going to be cosmetic.
At a time when GW is investing hundreds of millions of dollars in projects like the $275 million Science and Engineering Hall, a new School of Public Health and Health Services building and the GW Museum, it’s shocking that Gelman has been put on the back burner.
Old, uncomfortable furniture. A lack of space to study. Cracked ceilings. The list of complaints was endless. And it still is.
Now, GW is about to name its new chief librarian. This person should see his or her role not only as the leader of the library, but also as a chief advocate for the student body.
GW students are fortunate to have the National Archives and the Folger Shakespeare Library near campus. Provost Steven Lerman said in March that because of the University’s close proximity to these libraries, GW has hesitated to invest in Gelman.
A college cannot neglect its own library just because there are others across the city.
A library is the most basic element of any college campus. It’s the starting point for research and academic pursuits. And if GW has any hopes of elevating its stature, the library has to at least be up to par.

In a joint effort, Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology rolled out a piece of software this month that would provide instant feedback on essays and gives students the opportunity to correct their answers for more credit.
Some in the higher education and tech worlds have touted it as an educational boon, saving professors and students time and grunt work. EdX expects plenty of universities to catch on to aspects of the program and follow in the footsteps of some of its partners like Georgetown University and University of Texas, which have already launched free online courses through the venture.
And while GW administrators say they have no immediate plans to adopt the software, they admit the technology is intriguing. But they should continue to tread lightly on rocky technological terrain.
The edX software would degrade the classroom experience, replacing valid, personal faculty feedback with tips from computers.
The note of caution is key, especially as the University rightfully looks toward innovation. The University recently appointed its first vice provost for online education and academic innovation, handing the job to former law dean Paul Schiff Berman. It’s also expanded its base of online graduate programs and made them more interactive.
With such a push toward online education recently, it seems logical – albeit frightening – that edX’s essay-grading software is a realm that could be explored.
“My immediate personal thought is that it potentially is a great learning tool,” Associate Provost and Director of the Teaching and Learning Collaborative Denis Cioffi said in an email. “If a student could see how to improve an essay immediately, redrafts might be much more attractive, and rapid improvement might occur.”
Using technology to enhance the classroom experience is, of course, vital. Students learn better with visual components, like PowerPoint presentations and YouTube videos, to augment lectures. And there’s something to be said about making college-level classes affordable for the masses through online education.
But when considering ways to offer some academic options online, computer-graded essays should remain off-limits. After all, it’s hard to imagine how a machine could grade something as subjective as a paper.
Essays by their very nature are subjective, argument-based and difficult to quantify. And unlike a standardized test or a math problem, there isn’t necessarily a right answer. What’s troubling about edX’s invention is that it assumes you can plug in a formula for the perfect essay, but that simply isn’t the case.
Computers can tell you if you have a run-on sentence or a misspelling, but they can’t help improve the ideas of an argument or thesis. That’s where teachers come in. A professor’s purpose is to provide meaningful feedback to students and help them develop their argument.
When I’m writing a paper, I often bring it to the professor and we edit my work together. It triggers a dialogue about my progress and gives me ways to improve the draft.
I fear that edX’s invention would render this important step in the learning process virtually obsolete. Professors would lose relevance, as there would be no need for them to give students feedback.
GW, like many other institutions, has a comprehensive writing program that, in theory, relies heavily on one-on-one conversations. The writing courses are intentionally small, which gives students the ability to work closely with their professors.
No computer can replace that.
Technology is an important part of higher education, and it should be. But we should be wary of what it might replace.

Correction appended

The School of Media and Public Affairs will offer grants for at least two students to travel across Africa this summer as part of a project targeting worldwide hunger.
The trip is part of a larger initiative by Planet Forward, a sustainability-focused media project run by SMPA. Its latest endeavor, called Feeding the Planet, will bring top political and business leaders together to highlight innovations in food production, said Frank Sesno, director of SMPA and creator of Planet Forward.
Students will be accompanied by a professional backpack producer on a trip that will likely last about two weeks, before returning to D.C. to produce the videos. The trip is currently funded by foundations, individuals and other companies, though Sesno said he is seeking more funding and hopes to add another production team.
The videos will be showcased as part of a Planet Forward event this November, which will also feature a major keynote speaker and videos from Sesno’s multimedia reporting class this fall.
It will be one of four events this summer and fall bringing together top decisionmakers to collaborate across disciplines on issues such as food and technology, public-private partnerships and the changing nature of farms, tastes and nutrition, Sesno said.
“The idea is to bring together innovators and decisionmakers so that we can celebrate the innovators, the innovations themselves and replicate best practices,” Sesno said.
University President Steven Knapp hosted the first event April 3 that connected faculty, the head of the U.S. Agency for International Development and the director of the World Food Program USA at his F Street home.
The Africa trip, which will be fully financed for those accepted, is the second fellowship offered by SMPA this year for undergraduates. The school offers the SMPA-Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting fellowship to one student to investigate an underreported news story abroad every year. The Manheim-Sterling award, named for two SMPA professors who retired last year, was also awarded to two students this year.
“We’re not fielding correspondents to do a stand-up in front of somebody who’s working in the field,” Sesno said. “We want to hear from the people telling their stories. And that’s, to me, one of the exciting and empowering things about this sort of ‘smart food revolution.’ Everyone can tell their own story.”
He said that the ideas brought forward could help global hunger, an issue GW has focused more on lately.
The initiative comes after the University dished out over $200,000 on research proposals related to food and nutrition and lured famous chef José Andrés to teach an undergraduate class on food this semester.
The initiative also tries to take root as more people nationwide focus on food issues.
“Right now, one of the things we do and do very well is we export food. We can do more of that,” Sesno said. “How do we navigate the debate over GMOs and labeling and all these other things? Our focus is not going to be to wallow in the debate over those things, but to really try to highlight those new things that are happening.”
This article was updated April 18, 2013 to reflect the following:
The Hatchet incorrectly called Planet Forward’s initiative Feed the Planet. It is called Feeding the Planet. The Hatchet also incorrectly identified the World Food Program USA as the U.S. World Food Program. We regret these errors.

University President Steven Knapp urged Congress Wednesday to increase funding for the humanities, stressing the significance of research dollars in these areas.
Knapp, a former professor of English literature, testified before a House Appropriations subcommittee and defended funding for the National Endowment for the Humanities – a federal agency that is one of the nation’s largest benefactors of humanities programs.
The agency has allocated more than $1 million to GW  initiatives in recent years.
“Without support from the NEH, universities like ours would not have the resources they need to sustain their role in enabling our citizens to understand our nation’s history, to cherish its core values or to strive together to realize our shared aspirations,” Knapp said.
Echoing President Barack Obama, Knapp asked members of Congress to approve a $154 million budget for the next fiscal year.
The National Endowment for the Humanities typically grants about $40 million each year to universities, museums, libraries and other cultural institutions to fund independent research and projects tied to the humanities. The organization has seen significant budget cuts over the past few years, and chairman Jim Leach said in February that awards would be constrained due to the federal sequestration.
The agency helped fund the $710,000 Eleanor Roosevelt Papers at GW, Knapp said in his testimony. The Eleanor Roosevelt project, which has hosted 130 student volunteers, has published historical records related to the former first lady. GW also received $330,000 to fund the First Federal Congress project.
Knapp has staunchly advocated for the humanities at the University and beyond the campus’ perimeter. Knapp launched a University-wide initiative to promote the arts at the University in 2011. He has stood up for other humanities benefactors, defending funding for research in the field before the National Humanities Association in 2009.
Last month, Knapp gave the opening address at the 2013 meeting of the National Humanities Alliance. He is also a member of the Commission on the Humanities and Social Sciences.
Knapp also discussed the practical benefits of studying the humanities, pointing to the 9/11 Commission Report, which demonstrated the nation’s limited knowledge of foreign cultures.
“They are, to begin with, essential to national security, and there is little doubt that the nation’s security would be strengthened if our citizens and their leaders were better informed about the languages and beliefs of our allies as well as our adversaries,” Knapp said.

The freshman mandatory dining plan will increase starting next fall for the first time in five years, after parents called the current plan insufficient.
Freshmen will pay an extra $100 in Colonial Cash, amounting to a total of $3,500 for their meal plan next year, Director of Campus Support Services Nancy Haaga said Wednesday.
Students can also choose a costlier Dining Dollar plan and earn free money from the University to spend at on-campus Sodexo-run venues. Students who purchase between $100 and $500 receive an additional $10 to $100 through GW’s first voluntary dining plan.
For example, students who choose the most expensive plan will pay $500 and, in turn, receive $600 worth of Dining Dollars that can be used at J Street and G-Dub Java, along with Pelham Commons and ZeBi on the Mount Vernon Campus. Freshmen already pay for $700 worth of Dining Dollars each semester.
“We made an effort to try and bump up [the required plan] a little bit, while at the same time introducing the voluntary plan,” Haaga said. “So we think it’s a nice mix.”
Haaga said the move was based on feedback from the University’s Parents’ Association Advisory Council over the last several years.
She said the increased plans will help students keep up with the costs of inflation as area businesses raise their prices.
Some GWorld partners have also said they inflate their prices to afford the 8 to 10 percent commission fee and the 10-cent swipe fee to the University. Major credit cards charge between 2 and 5 percent in surcharges.
Rodney Johnson, executive director of the office of parent services, said the decision was a step in the right direction to give students the meal plan they need. He said he has fielded a high volume of calls from parents who said the freshman dining plan fell short.
“I’m glad we added $100 to the meal plan,” Johnson said, adding that “$3,500 is not enough, to be quite honest. In my opinion, it’s just not enough money for the average student.”
Johnson said he thinks the freshman plan will increase again next year.
The pricier dining plan will benefit students receiving financial assistance, because their scholarships and loans will cover an increased total cost of attendance, Haaga said.
While the University has nothing proposed to increase dining plans for upperclassmen living on campus, the voluntary dining plans will be available to all students throughout the year.
The University stopped requiring sophomores to purchase J Street dining plans in 2011, after years of student complaints. Sophomores now pay $2,500 each academic year for GWorld money that can be used at venues around campus. That meal plan drops to $2,000 for juniors and $1,000 for seniors. Students who live off campus are not required to purchase the plans.
The University has made multiple changes to its dining services in recent years, looking to attract more students to the Sodexo-run venues. In the last two years, the University has scrapped vendors from J Street, such as Wendy’s and Chick-fil-A, and revamped its marketing efforts to boost sales.
