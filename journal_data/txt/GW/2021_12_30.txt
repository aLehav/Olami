Many students are wondering what the rest of the spring semester will look like as headlines about Omicron continue to unfold the second week into winter break. 
Luckily, officials continue to plan for the re-opening of residence halls two days before the start of classes, a heartening sign of a year that does not bear striking resemblance to 2020 and the first half of 2021. 
Here’s the best and worst of this week’s headlines:
Thumbs up: 
Though COVID-19 has wreaked havoc on past semesters and continues to affect the coming ones, President Joe Biden is not indifferent to students’ financial concerns regarding the loans many Americans have taken out to obtain their degrees. Biden will extend the pause on student loan repayments until May 1. The pause was instituted in the March of 2020, at the beginning of the pandemic to give students more time to pay off their loans, and the extension will surely help recent graduates as their finances continue to be impacted by the pandemic. 
The end of the year is nigh, and it is fitting to celebrate some of the highlights of student advocacy efforts this year. Earlier this semester, several GW students who attended the class of 2021’s commencement ceremony made signs to protest the University allowing a person who was accused of sexual assault to attend the commencement ceremony. This brought the issue of how the University deals with sexual assault and sexual assault survivors front and center. 
Most recently, student activists were heard loud and clear after years of advocacy in favor of the U-Pass program, which will give students unlimited access to Metro services following a flat fee tacked on to tuition. 
Thumbs down: 
In worse pandemic-related news, D.C. has the highest rate of transmission in the country. Despite more than 67 percent of D.C. being fully vaccinated, cases have skyrocketed during the holiday season. People between the ages of 20 and 49 – who constitute nearly half of the District’s population – are driving up infection rates because they have a higher likelihood of attending work in person, a greater likelihood of household transmission due to raising young children and a greater chance of socializing outside the home, particularly during the holidays.
This does not bode well for an in-person spring semester, but hopefully GW’s vaccine and booster mandates will bolster our chances for the coming semester.

The year started with the National Guard's occupation of campus after the Jan. 6 insurrection, drawing thousands of troops to station in Foggy Bottom during the buildup to President Joe Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration.
2021 was a year of transition, with national headlines and University tensions coming to a head from start to finish.
The year started with the National Guard’s occupation of campus after the Jan. 6 insurrection and continued with a reopening that resumed in-person learning in the fall before a record resurgence of COVID-19 cases spurred by the Omicron variant ended the year with a return to online operations. Administrative shakeups and facilities concerns led GW’s biggest stories this year, headlined by University President Thomas LeBlanc’s departure and the news that Mark Wrighton is set to take over as interim president at the start of 2022.
Take a look back at some of the biggest stories at GW this year:
GW completes reopening during COVID-19 pandemic

The University welcomed students back to campus after reopening from the COVID-19 pandemic in late August. For some students, the semester presented the first chance to step foot on campus after 17 months of closures.
After nine months of pandemic-related shutdowns, 2021 offered the GW community a fresh opportunity to begin a gradual reopening.
About 1,500 students, roughly 15 percent of the undergraduate population, returned to campus for spring housing at the start of 2021 under strict guidelines like weekly COVID-19 testing and a no-guest policy that lasted until May. Officials announced plans for a phased summer reopening in March, during which some summer classes that required an in-person component would be held on campus for the first time since the outbreak began.
The entire student body returned to campus for the fall semester for the first time since March 2020 after officials turned to new public health protocol to limit the virus’ spread, including vaccine requirements and biweekly testing deadlines.
The classes of 2020 and 2021 returned to the National Mall in October to gather for GW’s first in-person Commencement ceremony since 2019. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., delivered the keynote address and LeBlanc awarded the President’s Medal – the highest honor that GW’s president can award – to Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
The semester progressed with minimal coronavirus-related disruptions until the spread of the Omicron variant reached D.C. in December. After officials recorded the variant among GW community members, COVID-19 cases surged on campus and prompted officials to cancel in-person exams and events for the remainder of the fall semester.
Transitioning to new leadership

LeBlanc faced mounting calls for his resignation leading up to his decision to step down in May. Mark Wrighton will replace LeBlanc at the start of the new year with an interim term of up to 18 months.
The GW community will enter 2022 with a different University president and provost from the top leaders at the start of 2021.
Officials announced in May that LeBlanc would step down at the end of the academic year, which came after widespread pushback against his leadership in the months prior. Former Provost Brian Blake, who previously worked with LeBlanc at the University of Miami, left GW in June to become the president of Georgia State University.
LeBlanc faced several calls for him to resign from GW community members leading up to the end of 2020, but the Board of Trustees largely maintained its support for the president through his tenure up until his retirement announcement, lauding his efforts to lead the University through the pandemic.
Board Chair Grace Speights announced at a Faculty Senate meeting in October that Mark Wrighton, the former chancellor of Washington University at St. Louis, would take over as interim president at the beginning of 2022 and hold the job for up to 18 months.
Insurrection prompts national security concerns

A violent mob of supporters of former President Donald Trump stunned the country on Jan. 6 when it stormed the U.S. Capitol Building in an effort to disrupt Congress’ certification of then-President-elect Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory, leading to the deaths of five people. The insurrection forced GW officials to close the Foggy Bottom campus from visitors and increase the security presence on campus.
Thousands of National Guard troops stationed in D.C. during the buildup to Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration, and Foggy Bottom was subject to the Secret Service’s security zone established following the insurrection. Armed officers and National Guard vehicles were stationed outside the Science and Engineering and Funger halls, and campus residents received special GWorld cards that confirmed their identities and D.C. residency.
Students condemn acts of antisemitism

About 400 students processed through campus in early November after news spread about the desecration of a Torah scroll at Tau Kappa Epsilon’s on-campus house during a break-in.
Controversy arose after Halloween weekend when members of Tau Kappa Epsilon reported that a Torah was vandalized with laundry detergent at the chapter’s on-campus townhouse. The incident garnered national attention, and LeBlanc released a statement condemning acts of antisemitism.
Hundreds of community members, led by members of TKE, protested the act of antisemitism during a march to Kogan Plaza, where the group read from the Torah and listened to speeches condemning the acts of hatred. Students expressed hope that despite the desecration, the protest would prove that Foggy Bottom is a safe place for Jewish students.
Facilities concerns across campus

Residents on Townhouse Row were instructed to evacuate their buildings in September after residents in two units reported “environmental concerns” to officials earlier in the week.
Nearly 200 residents, all members of Greek life chapters, evacuated Townhouse Row in September after officials detected water leaks that created conditions “conducive to biological growth” and mold. Several Townhouse Row residents also visited hospitals for flu-like symptoms like mild coughs, runny noses and coughing up blood.
Following the evacuation, more than 75 students and faculty across campus said they identified what appeared to be mold in residence halls and academic buildings. They said the apparent mold gave way to illness, relocation and an overflow of FixIt tickets for facilities staff – many of whom were laid off in fall 2020.
Students grapple with GW’s handling of Title IX cases
Grace Hromin | Senior Photo Editor
About 75 students marched by the site of Commencement on the National Mall in October to to silently protest GW’s handling of sexual assault cases.
Former Student Association President Howard Brookins stepped down in January after sexual misconduct allegations sparked calls for his resignation from more than 50 current and former student leaders. In a letter, Brookins said he was resigning for his “health and so many other reasons” but denied the accusations.
A group of about 75 students protested the University’s handling of sexual assault cases at Commencement in October, calling on officials to bar alleged assailants from campus and to implement a more transparent Title IX process.
Officials announced in November that they would add new staff positions in the Title IX Office and the Office of Advocacy and Support and expand training measures for the GW community in response to student concerns. Students held another demonstration on campus earlier this month in Kogan Plaza where they hung t-shirts bearing stories of sexual assault survivors to raise awareness and pressure officials to fulfill their planned reforms.

Ray Lucas, the University’s COVID-19 coordinator, said officials will consider in-person classes when GW's transmission and positivity case rates return to levels from before the Omicron variant's spread.
Updated: Dec. 30, 2021 at 8:08 p.m.
Students will be required to quarantine until they receive two negative COVID-19 tests when they return to campus next month, officials said.
Scott Burnotes, the vice president for safety and facilities, said in an interview that students must check in at the University Student Center upon moving in before beginning a quarantine period lasting until they receive results from two negative PCR tests, which should be scheduled three days apart. Officials also said they are considering offering COVID-19 tests seven days a week if needed, and they will increase the number of people staffing the testing operation to deal with the influx of testing appointments next month.
Administrators announced last week that GW will hold classes online for at least the first week of the spring semester and moved up the deadline for GW community members to receive a COVID-19 booster shot from Feb. 1 to Jan. 10 to combat the spread of the Omicron variant.
Burnotes said seating will be restricted at dining areas on campus, like District House and the student center, during GW’s remote learning period and students will be instructed to eat in their residence hall rooms instead. He said officials expect higher rates of COVID-19 transmission among the University community as students return to campus.
“We’re hoping everyone will play their part and understand that while it’s a little bit of an inconvenience to go back up to their room to eat, it is helping us maintain that safe environment and the numbers to decrease,” Burnotes said.
The District currently has the highest average rate of daily COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in the United States, and GW and D.C. officials have tightened restrictions in response. Earlier this month, Mayor Muriel Bowser reinstated the city’s indoor mask mandate and announced that all residents will be required to have proof of vaccination to enter all restaurants, bars, gyms and entertainment venues beginning Feb. 15.
Officials announced last week that residence halls will reopen to students Jan. 8 as originally scheduled, despite the remote learning period.
Burnotes said the University has “significantly increased” its isolation capacity for students who test positive with additional residential spaces and beds to prepare for higher COVID-19 transmission rates. He said the return of in-person events, which will be canceled during the remote learning period after officials suspended them in mid-December, will depend on the University community’s transmission rate and the District’s regulations.
“We will continue to stress the importance of good universal COVID protocols such as the masking and moving to a grab-and-go dining concept until we can see the metrics improve,” Burnotes said.
Interim Provost Chris Bracey said in an email to students last week that the Lerner Health and Wellness Center will be closed until Jan. 18 during the remote learning period, and several campus libraries will have restricted access during the first week of the new year.
Gelman Library will remain closed to patrons until Jan. 10 with book pickup and scanning services still available, according to the University’s website. Bracey’s email states one student at a time may occupy study rooms where masking compliance will be “rigorously monitored” during the remote learning period.
Eckles and the Virginia Science and Technology Campus libraries will also open Jan. 10, Jacob Burns Law Library will open Jan. 9 and Himmelfarb Health Sciences Library will open Jan. 2, according to GW’s website.
In-person clinical programs may continue with limited learning activity, according to Bracey’s email. The email states lab and shared areas for research may be filled up to half their capacity, and access will be restricted for undergraduate students, who must receivce approval to work in the labs “on a very limited basis.”
Ray Lucas, GW’s COVID-19 coordinator, said officials will consider expanding GW’s testing capacity next month with appointments available seven days a week and additional personnel working in the University’s testing lab.
He said officials will consider returning to in-person classes when GW’s COVID-19 transmission and positivity case rates return to the same levels as before the outbreak of the Omicron variant. He said an extension of the remote learning period will depend on whether cases rise in the District and among the University community at the beginning of the spring semester.
“We set the Jan. 18 date as sort of a best guess, but we’re continually monitoring that,” Lucas said in an interview. “I don’t think we’re going to go sooner than that. If we think we have to go longer, we’ll certainly give the campus ample notice.”
Lucas said officials hope the current surge in cases will subside between late January and early February based on the course of the variant’s spread in South Africa. He said hospitalizations have generally decreased recently nationwide with positive patients experiencing fewer severe health consequences from the coronavirus.
He said officials might struggle to manage the University community’s contract tracing and clear up isolation housing if the COVID-19 positivity rate exceeds 2 percent and the transmission rate surpasses 1.2 percent on campus.
“Even though we were pushing off in-person learning until later in the month, we really wanted the residential students to come back according to the original timetable so that they could be as successful as possible in this virtual learning environment that we’re starting with,” he said.
Lucas said the remote learning period will help students avoid missing classes and work and allow officials to focus on monitoring COVID-19 surveillance testing, quarantines and  isolations on campus.
“I think getting that group ethos among our campus that we’re all in this together and that we all need to be careful is so important now and more so than it ever has been throughout the pandemic,” Lucas said.

The Hatchet incorrectly reported that GW will begin offering COVID-19 testing seven days a week. Officials will consider offering testing seven days a week if needed. We regret this error.

The new policy states that conference standing and championship seeding will be based on an approved formula that balances team win-loss records with the total number of contests completed by a team. 
The Atlantic 10 conference revised its COVID-19 forfeiture policy to require games to be postponed or rescheduled if team members test positive for the virus, the athletic department announced in a release Tuesday.
Athletic directors of the A-10 programs voted Tuesday to approve a change in their postponement and scheduling policy of women’s and men’s basketball games due to a recent surge of COVID-19 cases and the spread of the Omicron variant. The A-10’s current COVID-19 policy states that games must be postponed or rescheduled by the A-10 conference office if any team member tests positive and that if games cannot be rescheduled they will be declared a no contest.
The A-10’s medical advisory committee will be meeting this Wednesday to review the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s updated isolation policies for asymptomatic vaccinated individuals, a time period that was recently reduced to five days from 10.
The new policy states that conference standing and championship seeding will be based on an approved formula that balances team win-loss records with the total number of contests completed by a team. If a team decides not to play in a rescheduled match, the team will suffer a forfeit by the league.
The revision also requires teams that have at least seven scholarship players and one countable coach to compete in all conference contests, but teams will also be allowed to participate with less than seven student-athletes. If the team decides not to play under these conditions, they will suffer a forfeit and be given a conference loss.
The release states the league commissioner may choose to administer penalties, like forfeitures or fines, on programs that do not meet the league code of conduct of rescheduling games. The release also states the decision regarding the forfeiture policies of spring sports will be announced at a later date, as they continue to monitor the pandemic with its medical advisory team.
Men’s basketball’s Dec. 30 home match against Saint Bonaventure was postponed over COVID-19 concerns.

O'Neill previously served as the director of baseball operations for Duke where he helped coordinate team activities and recruitment.
The former director of baseball operations at Duke has joined the baseball staff as an assistant coach.
Chris O’Neill will serve as assistant coach and assistant recruiting coordinator, Head Coach Gregg Ritchie announced in a release last Wednesday. Prior to joining GW, O’Neill served as the director of baseball operations for Duke where he helped coordinate team activities and recruitment, the release states.
“Chris brings a special combination of tools, experience and skills to our student-athletes,” Ritchie said in the release. “He is a disciplined technician that has strong teaching, communication and creativity skills. He is going to tremendously impact the training and development of our team, and his leadership will be a difference maker in assisting the team and program reach new heights.”
Before his gig with the Blue Devils, O’Neill also coached at Bucknell, Marshall and Maryland Eastern Shore.
“I’m thrilled at the chance to join Coach Ritchie’s staff,” O’Neill said in the release. “He has made George Washington feel like home in a short amount of time. I can’t wait to get started contributing to the winning mentality and performance of our Buff & Blue athletes, and I’m thrilled to try and push this team to Raise High!”
O’Neill was also the manager for the Grand Lake Mariners, a summer collegiate team, for two seasons where he helped guide the Mariners to the team’s most wins since 2009 in his first season at the helm. In his second year, he led the Mariners to a second-place finish and the team’s first finals appearance since 2006.
O’Neill will join a team looking to improve on a 26-18 overall record last year and earn a berth to its first Atlantic 10 tournament since the 2018 season.

D.C. currently has the highest average rate of daily COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in the United States, according to national data.
The District has recorded an average of 293 daily COVID-19 cases for every 100,000 residents in the past week – a tally that outnumbers all U.S. states and territories, according to data from The New York Times. The city’s rate is more than three times the national average, which remains at 81, and New York checks in with the second highest average daily case rate of 191 per 100,000 residents.
The District’s cases have soared since Thanksgiving, jumping by about 3,300 percent from a daily average of about 60 cases to about 2,000 after the spread of the Omicron variant made its way into the city earlier this month. The city’s average daily case rate has spiked by about 931 percent in the last two weeks, according to Times data.
D.C.’s nation-leading average rate of daily hospitalizations totals about 46 tied to COVID-19 out of every 100,000 in the last week, double the U.S. average of 23. The rate is up by about 135 percent in the city during the past two weeks, according to the data.
District officials estimate that nearly 67 percent of city residents are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus.

Metro General Manager and CEO Paul Wiedefeld said officials don't have any additional safety concerns with the cars but wanted to pause their return to perform daily inspections out of an “abundance of caution.”
The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority paused the return of a series of rail cars that sparked transit safety concerns following derailment issues earlier this fall.
In a release issued last week, WMATA officials said they halted plans to bring back the 7000-series railcars to perform additional inspections of the trains’ wheels, a reversal from an announcement earlier this month indicating that the agency would start reintroducing the cars to service. Metro pulled the rail cars from service in October following a Blue Line derailment in a move that slashed service and extended wait times at stations across the D.C. area.
The suspension of the cars, which account for 60 percent of WMATA’s fleet, troubled transit plans this fall for students and local commuters who said they had to miss class or readjust their schedules to make up for the changes.
Metro General Manager and CEO Paul Wiedefeld said officials don’t have any additional safety concerns with the cars but wanted to perform the daily inspections out of an “abundance of caution.”
“While I recognize the pause is unexpected, we are going to continuously evaluate data we are collecting to ensure that we are enhancing safety,” Wiedefeld said in the release. “I feel that requiring a daily inspection is the safest course until we know more and our experts have an opportunity to review the data we are collecting with the few trainsets now in operation.”
