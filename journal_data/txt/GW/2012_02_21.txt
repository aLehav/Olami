The University is celebrating 100 years on Foggy Bottom this year as well as its namesake’s 280th birthday. But this month has revealed the significance of other historical milestones, as well. It’s been 58 years since the University officially desegregated and 49 years since Martin Luther King, Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech was delivered just blocks from campus.
These milestones tie into this year’s theme for Black Heritage Celebration at GW – “Bleeding Black.” The theme incorporates the many facets of African-American and Afro-Latino culture while acknowledging the racial struggles and advances made at the University over the decades.
“There is definitely a message of pride we want to covey with this year’s theme. ‘Bleeding Black’ symbolizes the historic and current cultural struggles our community has faced and overcome,” said senior Dominique Bozeman, the student events coordinator for this year’s Black Heritage Celebration. “The message is for us to be educated enough to exude that pride for more than a month out of the year.”
After GW desegregated in 1954, students from the “Black Peoples Union” began establishing a prominent presence on campus, organizing the University’s first events in honor of a black history month in 1968. The group eventually transformed, laying the groundwork for what is today the Multicultural Student Services Center, an organizer of African-American History Month celebrations on campus.
Vice president of the Black Student Union and Williams House Coordinator Malissa Wilkins notes an important duality to the celebration’s theme.
“‘Bleeding Black’ represents two inherent themes: The love within the black community and then those things which continue to plague the black community, such as incarceration and black-on-black crime.” Wilkins said. “In other words, bleeding black with love for myself and my community, yet bleeding black in a literal sense as my brother on the corner is killed by his brother for a pair of shoes.”
Director of the Multicultural Student Services Center Michael Tapscott compares the theme to a common adage of loyal appreciation heard on campus of “bleeding buff and blue.”
“Bleeding Black can also relate to the blood, sweat and tears of our ancestors who answered challenges that paved the way for success in America for the following generations,” Tapscott said.
Although universities nationwide have adopted broader diversity initiatives, minorities make up a small percentage of college students nationally. Only 33.4 percent of African-American males go on to post-secondary education after high school graduation, according to a research study done by the College Board.
Recent diversity initiatives made at the University and the creation of the Multicultural Student Services Center in 1994 aim to combat these staggering statistics, hoping to make the sentiments of black history month salient all year.
Wilkins noted that minority students face challenges not only in higher education, but socially as well.
“It’s not enough [for a minority student] to just get into school. I think that once we are here we then have to decide whether or not to be so involved in making known who we are to others on campus, being proud of who we are and embracing what we love about ourselves,” Wilkins said.
A breadth of campus and student organizations, including the Black Student Union, the Williams House and programs within the Multicultural Student Services Center, have championed initiatives to provide networks for minority students while also educating the GW community about multiculturalism.
“The goal of [the Black Heritage Celebration] planning committee, the participating organizations and the staff at the MSSC is to reach those who have an interest in the issues being addressed. To limit that to any particular racial group would be a disservice to the values of our community,” Bozeman said.
It was 1938 when former University President Cloyd Heck Marvin issued a memorandum publicly defending the institution’s refusal to admit “colored” students. But Tapscott added that black students were enrolling in night courses as early as 1949. He said the first black man he is aware of attending GW Law School took classes in the late 1870s.
“The Williams House has definitely developed a stronger bond with other organizations on campus such as the GW Hillel and Jewish Student Association, who we now will have an Annual Freedom Seder with in honor of the similarities and differences we appreciate about each other’s communities,” Wilkins said.
A theme of embracing all cultures has resonated in events surrounding “Bleeding Black” initiatives. Past events like “Black & Brown in America” aim to create a dialogue about relationships among ethnic groups, while upcoming events like “Taste of Africa” show off the food and traditions of different African cultures.
“I remember a colleague once said, ‘We have to honor our history, with all its beauty marks and all of its warts.’” Tapscott said.
Black Heritage Celebration events brought by the MSSC will run through March 3.

Sales at J Street have stagnated this spring after dipping in the fall semester in the face of competition from new food venues near campus.
In the fall, dining representatives reported a $5,000 drop in daily sales compared to that period the previous year – a result of reduced prices, the nixing of dining requirements for sophomores and the lowering of mandatory spending for freshmen.
Sales so far this spring remained at about $16,000 per day, Rich Yokeley, director of campus dining for Sodexo, said.
Yokeley declined to elaborate on his reaction to flattening daily sales, but said “while we are pleased with much of the progress that has been made since September 2011, we are not complacent or satisfied that we’ve met all of our goals in terms of creating a campus dining offering that is unique to GW, as compared to the local restaurant marketplace.”
The dining hub saw 2,229 more transactions weekly in the fall compared to the previous year, totaling about 16,000 to 17,000 purchases a week on average.
Yokeley attributed the climb in purchases primarily to the additional 40 hours J Street has been operating per week since September.
He declined to say how the sale dip alongside increased foot traffic impacted revenue.
Ben Leighton, chair of the Student Dining Board, said the increase in transactions shows “people [are giving] J Street a chance.”
“It’s not the same dining program and facility that they thought was horrible,” Leighton, also a candidate for Student Association executive vice president, said.
Along with last summer’s physical overhaul of J Street, which replaced nearly all dining options with new vendors, prices were brought down to “be more competitive with the local marketplace,” Yokeley said.
J Street’s overall price reduction goal, Yokeley said, was 8 to 10 percent for the new venues, such as Pesto, the Metro Diner and the Coffee Stop.
Whole Foods Market has not tracked GWorld traffic, but Kim Bryden, the store’s marketing team leader, said “the amount of students that come in and use GWorld is phenomenal.”

Foggy Bottom’s leading community group voted last Wednesday to hire an attorney specializing in zoning laws to unscramble GW’s campus development plans and detect potential violations of city law.
The Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission – which advises city agencies on issues ranging from traffic to safety and liquor licenses – allocated $2,000 to task a lawyer with determining if upcoming construction projects are in line with both the University’s 2007 Campus Plan and with city regulations for land use planning.
GW received an initial go-ahead for future development when the campus plan passed, but each individual project must obtain second-stage approval once more detailed blueprints are drawn up. The commission automatically becomes involved in each zoning case the University puts forward in the neighborhood.
Alumnus and commissioner Asher Corson said the lawyer would offer perspective on projects and their zoning filings to the city, independent of University officials’ briefings to the ANC. Corson said the lawyer would not sue GW upon noting a potential discrepancy in the documents – as Planned Unit Developments, or spots outlined in the campus plan for later development, are subject to ANC consideration under D.C. zoning laws.
“I do like the idea of getting an outside person to tell us what we’re really being asked,” Corson said. “I think that for us…it’s just overwhelming for the commissioners to go through hundreds of pages of zoning documents and figure out if GW changed something.”
Corson pitched the idea to obtain legal counsel to evaluate the University’s projects at an ANC meeting in November, upset with GW’s public announcement to bulldoze six properties along Pennsylvania Avenue.
A sleek office building with 275 parking spots will replace the cluster of restaurants – including Froggy Bottom Pub, Mehran and Thai Place – and the office space leased by Kaiser Permanente next door.
Corson, a staunch critic of major campus development efforts, said the plan’s focus is purely commercial and abandons the University’s academic mission. He threatened at the time to resign if the other commissioners did not support his request, later postponing the decision after a tie vote.
University officials keep local residents up-to-date with campus projects through briefings at neighborhood meetings. Corson said the commission also consulted a lawyer during GW’s campus plan approval process in 2007 but he has not heard of any other commissions that did so.
The D.C. Zoning Commission weighs ANC support or opposition to a project when reviewing cases for approval.
Commission chair Florence Harmon, whose constituency covers a large swath of campus, said an independent attorney who is familiar with the city’s laws would provide valuable insight on the zoning process.
“If [GW comes] in with something that just violates every zoning regulation known to man and is against every precedent, I’d like an attorney to tell me that,” Harmon said. “If they come in and we don’t really have a strong case, but there are some questions we should ask, I would like a zoning attorney to tell me that.”
She added that using the commission’s operating budget to hire a lawyer would cover about 10 hours of work.
“This isn’t a war chest to go fight GW. You can’t get very far with $2,000,” Harmon said. “But we do want to work collaboratively as much as we can.”
Britany Waddell, GW’s director of community relations, said GW’s relationship with the community is reliant on transparency, and the University would work with the legal counsel if the commission finds it helpful.
“The decision to retain an attorney on this or any other application is entirely up to the ANC, and we do not feel it will negatively impact our on-going dialogue,” Waddell said.
Harmon said the commission has not yet tapped a lawyer and is unsure when it will begin seeking counsel on projects.

The University is making progress in its efforts to attract international students, early admission data show.
About 8 percent of the students who received early binding acceptances to the Class of 2016 are international, a 2 percent bump over last year. The University has actively sought out international students.
Associate Vice President and Dean for Undergraduate Admissions Kathryn Napper said the increase resulted from a larger pool of qualified international applicants this year.
In October, Napper said the University would target international students to increase campus diversity and expand into untapped financial markets, bringing in more tuition revenue. This year, GW re-established formal outreach programs in South America to draw applicants from emerging economies there.
“The recruitment we have been doing in admissions over the last five years is yielding results such as greater diversity within the international pool,” she said.
In 2006, GW had 1,863 international students enrolled in its undergraduate and graduate programs – a figure that rose 37 percent over five years to reach 2,553 international students last fall.
Foreign student recruitment aligns with the globalization theme that will inform the University’s 10-year strategic plan, set to be published in the fall. The priority includes bringing more foreign students to campus and increasing GW’s presence abroad.
International students contribute $21 billion annually to the American economy, according to a November study by the Institute of International Education.
The University accepted 13 percent more early decision applicants this year, leaving 110 fewer places for regular decision candidates. Early candidates fill 40 percent of the desired 2,350-person Class of 2016. Last year, early decision made up 37 percent of the freshman class.
Early decision candidates experienced a significant advantage over regular applicants, with acceptances granted to 37 percent of Early Decision I candidates and 43 percent of those in the Early Decision II pool. Last year’s overall admission rate stood at 33 percent.
Napper said both early decision applicants and admitted students this year were “more diverse than ever,” bucking a national trend of generally lower levels of racial diversity among the cohort.
About 35 percent of GW’s successful early decision applicants were multicultural or international.
Early decision applicants are also less likely to come from diverse economic backgrounds, Scott Jaschik, editor and co-founder of Inside Higher Ed, said.
Napper said the University works to recruit applicants from all socioeconomic backgrounds and hopes that this year’s early and regular decision candidates will reflect that diversity.
She noted that GW is a need-blind institution – one that does not consider financial status of its applicants in the admissions process.
“Until we enroll the freshman class, we have no measurable indicators to report regarding socioeconomic diversity in the class,” Napper said.
Students accepted in GW’s early decision programs come from 41 states, Puerto Rico, the District and 20 countries.
By admitting 100 more early decision students, Napper acknowledged that there are fewer spots for about 21,700 regular decision applicants. Regular decision students will be notified of their admission statuses later in the spring.

When University administrators decline to comment, they are sending the community a loud message: GW doesn’t value students’ rights to information.
And that’s a problem.
Every time an administrator decides to withhold information, he or she does far more than simply limit the thoroughness of an article. These denials disrespect the very student body administrators have been hired to serve.
Earlier this semester, the University launched an online referral system to support students experiencing crises. This system is extremely laudable, and it demonstrates how the University is working to improve its existing mental health support system for students.
Yet Helen Cannaday Saulny, associate vice president and dean of student academic success, declined to provide basic information about the service, such as how the pilot program was modified, or protocol for when a student does not respond to e-mails or calls from the system.
Worse, Saulny declined to comment on whether or not the University would use the information gathered from the CARE system for disciplinary action. And while a different administrator provided an answer to that question – it’s no – GW only released it after being told that Saulny’s decline to comment would be included in this editorial. These basic, crucial facts should have been explained right away. There is no excuse why it was not included. No party-line can explain it this decision away. It was purely a commitment to reticence.
This is especially concerning because of the University’s poor record on mental health issues. A student was suspended from GW in 2006 after he sought treatment for depression and suicidal thoughts. Because of this history, the University needed to be extra candid about their plans for these records.
Last month, the University released a survey that claimed student satisfaction for J Street increased 11 percent. But University spokeswoman Jill Sankey declined to provide any contextual information, such as overall satisfaction.
There is absolutely no reason the University should have withheld more information on this survey. Student satisfaction for dining is “up,” but from what?
If dining is improving on campus and the University is continuing to make fixes to the current system, the community should be engaged in a dialogue with administration about it. Clamping down on information puts an end to these conversations that would ultimately benefit student life – an end goal the entire community should be working toward.
At the very beginning of the school year, the University Counseling Center decided to overhaul its fee structure and allow students to have six free counseling sessions. Former UCC Director John Dages expressed concern that it might constrain the center’s budget.
Months later, the Senior Associate Dean of Students Mark Levine has declined to provide information on the center’s financial status.
The University has also repeatedly denied any information regarding the ongoing UCC review. And while it should not necessarily be expected that the University provide every single detail of the review immediately, it is inexcusable that so much information was withheld on an issue essential to student health and well-being.
But the fact that the University continually declines to comment is indicative of a larger, more troubling trend throughout the administration. There seems to be a culture pervading the University that promotes secrecy and belittles the importance of sharing information. In other words, we go to a school where administration prioritizes image over openness.
That has long-term implications for the relationship and sense of trust between students and the institution. And that’s certainly something the administration can’t want.
It is unrealistic to ask the University to provide every piece of information to the community. But as consumers and stakeholders, it is ridiculous that students are continually denied basic facts and information even when they seek it out.

University officials will take the next step Thursday toward transforming the historic Woodhull House into the GW Museum by presenting a city board with revised designs.
D.C.’s Historic Preservation Review Board must green-light plans for the $22 million project to ensure its integrity and significance is preserved before the University can renovate the building to unite the cross-town Textile Museum with GW’s collection of city artifacts.
The Woodhull House, home to the University Police Department, was marked in the National Register of Historic Places in 1990 for its Italian villa-style architecture and its importance in GW’s history. Maxwell Woodhull, a former Board of Trustees member who had a hand in making Foggy Bottom the University’s main campus, donated the structure to GW in 1921.
Like all historic landmarks and districts in the city, changes to the house’s design must be reviewed by the preservation board.
After a $5 million donation by collector and real estate developer Albert H. Small last February, construction for the dual museum is expected to begin by late summer. The main entrance to the four-story museum with two underground floors will be on 21st Street, with a second entrance on G Street.
Steve Callcott, senior preservation planner for the Historic Preservation Office, said the board is pleased overall with the University’s plans for the Woodhull House.
GW gained approval from the preservation board in November for its general project blueprints but was asked to make small adjustments to the designs, like narrowing a bridge connecting the Woodhull House and the additional building where textiles will be showcased.
The revised sketches would lighten the load the bridge places on the Woodhull House and switch the construction material from glass to limestone to match the building’s façade.
The bridge changes would open up the breezeway between 21st Street and University Yard, creating a more “inviting” space as recommended by the preservation board at the November meeting.
Director of Community Relations Britany Waddell said the design process for projects always involves a back and forth and “GW takes seriously its responsibility to develop projects that are either historic or located in historic districts with a view that is sensitive to the historic context.”
The board also asked that GW make the building’s façade more appealing, Lee Becker, one of the architects for the project, said Wednesday at a Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission meeting. He said hardware to place promotional banners across the structure would be added.

Since a crushing defeat at nationals last year, the men’s squash team hasn’t wavered from its desire to be champions.
And after defeating No. 23 Colby College 5-4 at the College Squash Association Team Nationals Sunday, for the first time in program history, head coach Wendy Lawrence and her squad (15-9) are national champions.
“I was getting text messages and calls from many of our alumni after we beat Colby,” Lawrence said. “They are really excited to see GW on the map like this. It is really a bright star for GW and the athletic department.”
The No. 17 Colonials traveled to Princeton, N.J. needing to win three matches in three days to claim the Summers Cup, the highest honor in the tournament’s C division. GW easily defeated No. 24 Stanford 8-1 with dominant play from juniors Islam El-Fiky and Omar Sobhy.
El-Fiky and Sobhy, who are No. 1 and No. 2 on the team ladder, respectively, set the tone for GW, and the team soon advanced to face Bowdoin in the semifinals.
It was that round that gave the Colonials a chance to avenge their defeat in the 2011 tournament at the hands of Bowdoin. In a tight contest, GW narrowly defeated Bowdoin 5-4, earning hard-fought four-set victories from senior Jose Calderon and junior Player Haynes.
“We had beaten them twice during the season this year. We played them in December and won 8-1 and we played them in January and we won 5-4. We weren’t at all overconfident, but we at least had a sense of how they played and what their strengths and weaknesses were,” Lawrence said. “And when you lose in the finals like we did to Bowdoin last year, it is tough to deal with. Revenge was always in the back of our minds.”
With last year’s loss solidly repaid, GW turned its attention to a surprising finals opponent. Colby successfully upset two teams to reach the last round of the tournament, defeating both No. 18 Amherst College and No. 22 Hamilton College, but the Colonials were prepared to stare down the surprise challenger’s momentum.
“We were not expecting to play Colby,” Lawrence said. “It came down to us being prepared and taking care of business.”
And GW did just that, maintaining a high level of play until the Summers Cup was solidly in its hands. Though El-Fiky and Sobhy both have more squash to play this year – representing GW at the Individual National Championships in March – for the rest of the team, it’s a thrilling cap to the season.
The championship helps boost the program’s future, too, Lawrence pointed out. After capturing the Summers Cup, the head coach can more aggressively pursue the best high school squash players in the U.S. and around the world, working to continue to build a strong program.
 “For the seniors to go out winning is great, and we will miss them,” Lawrence said. “We do have great juniors and sophomores who are fantastic players as well. Obviously, winning the Summers Cup makes my life easier as a recruiter and we can really attract some great players to GW.”

As the shot clock ticked down on the play Sunday, redshirt junior forward Brooke Wilson launched a long jump shot and watched it fall through the net.
The basket broke through three minutes of play without a GW score, and pulled the Colonials within one point with a minute and 16 seconds left in the game. But Massachusetts kept control for the next minute of play, keeping GW from scoring again.
The Colonials (11-15) ultimately fell to the Minutewomen 56-53, extending GW’s losing streak to three, while snapping Massachusetts’ nine-game losing streak. The loss handed the Minutewomen their first home victory since Dec. 11 and just their second A-10 win. And as the team prepared to return to Foggy Bottom, head coach Mike Bozeman didn’t think it was a loss in which his team played its hardest.
 “This was not a good overall effort for the entire 40 minutes,” Bozeman said.
 GW’s bench play continued to plague the team Sunday. Despite dressing nine players, an increase from the six the Colonials were forced to play with earlier in the season, the bench contributed just three points on the day.
 The lack of production from the roster, Bozeman said, has roots in the Colonials lacking a solid offensive rhythm. Substitutions in the lineup make it hard to create a consistent game plan, a challenge that sometimes halts GW’s play on the court.
“We’re trying to play [the once-injured players] back into the fold,” Bozeman said.  “We’re trying to get a rhythm with this team overall.”
As the game began, neither team was able to establish a clear advantage, both GW and the Minutewomen unable to lead by more than five points over the first 15 minutes of play. But Massachusetts exploded on a late run in the first, tallying a 14-3 spurt that gave it an 11-point lead with 40 seconds left.
It was a lot of ground to make up before the break, but the Colonials did their best to close the gap, scoring the final three points before the half. Still, GW entered halftime down eight, crippled by the Minutewomen’s 50 percent shooting and the Colonials’ inability to have the same success at the net, shooting just 37.5 in the half.
“That’s part of the problem with so much of the valuable injuries that we had,” Bozeman said, reflecting on the team’s struggles.
The Colonials weren’t able to immediately regain ground out of the break, remaining in a seven-point hole four minutes into the second, when senior guard Tiana Myers helped jump start an 11-2 GW scoring run, adding six points on her own. It was a boost that gave the Colonials a two-point lead, their first of the game, but one that wasn’t enough to cement a victory.
The teams traded baskets over the final minutes of the game, before Wilson’s basket, and GW’s ensuing failure to convert on five chances, wrapped up play.
In the end, the Colonials had no answer for the Minutewomen’s 45.1 percent shooting on the game. Though GW was able to limit Massachusetts’ success at the basket in the second, the Colonials’ errors kept them from truly asserting dominance. Despite earning a slim advantage on boards, 36-33, GW turned the ball over 14 times. While Massachusetts had an almost equal 15 turnovers on the game, as the team with less successful shooting, the Colonials could ill afford sloppy play.
“There were spurts where we got back into the game and took the lead. We would get a steal and dribble the ball off our foot,” Bozeman said. “Or we would get a steal and a turnover after.”
It was senior forward/guard Tara Booker who truly battled to pace the Colonials. Hitting shots from all over the floor, she earned her third double-double of the season, matching her season-high with 20 points and 10 rebounds.
“Tara carried us all night,” Bozeman said. “Rebounds are effort so you cannot question Tara’s effort.  She gave us a great boost.”
The Colonials next return to Foggy Bottom and prepare to host La Salle, looking to snap their losing skid. The game is “winnable,” Bozeman said, and he didn’t anticipate the holes in GW’s play carrying over to its next contest.
“I don’t think it’s anything that we are going to carry over to next game. I’m looking forward to ourselves bouncing back on Wednesday against La Salle,” Bozeman said.
