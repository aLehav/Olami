Rosa Nomvuyo Fihla poses for a portrait session for her EP, “The Sad Songs,” which was released last month on Spotify and Apple Music.
With a background in piano and vocal training, senior Rosa Nomvuyo Fihla, a singer-songwriter from South Africa studying interior architecture, had all the right tools to write her own music. She grew up with a piano in her home and spent hours playing on it as a child.
“As a kid, me and my friends would hang out and make music and put on performances and so I kind of continued with that all throughout high school,” Fihla said. “But it wasn’t until COVID actually or 2019 that I was like ‘I actually want to make music that I can put there and share with people.’”
With a strong musical background since a young age, Fihla, like many creatives, said the pandemic offered a unique opportunity to further explore her music and kindled the desire to put her work on a larger platform. To achieve that goal, Fihla released a three-song EP titled “The Sad Songs” last month.
Fihla said periods of struggle and burnout from different moments in her life inspired the work.
“I remember there was one night I was lying in bed,” she said. “I was so sad and I had this like tune in my head like Do, doo, doo-doo-do-doo. I whipped out my notes app and I just started writing,” she said.
Fihla said she hasn’t set firm goals for her music career besides helping others connect, allowing her to keep music as a self-fulfilling passion that never feels like work.
“The goal is to just put it out there and for it to be something that I created,” she said.

(L-R) Gibby Gibson, Dylan Weiss and Issac Appelbaum pose for a group portrait at the Student Musicians Coalition space in the University Student Center. The space, which recently moved from the basement of Shenkman Hall, is a functioning recording studio and rehearsal area.
The “post-rock” band Dundrum came to be when drummer Issac Appelbaum and guitarist Dylan Weiss met on Instagram during their freshman year while studying virtually during the height of the pandemic. Once the two met in person, they hit the ground running and never looked back. 
“We started jamming, and we’ve been jamming ever since,” Weiss said of the band’s trajectory.
Earlier this spring, Weiss and Appelbaum met guitarist Andrew “Gibby” Gibson through the GW Student Musicians Collation, which Applebaum and Weiss lead as executive members. They recently started working with alumnus Connor Peters, who will be the band’s new bassist.

Weiss and Gibson named the band Dundrum after the name of a Dublin, Ireland suburb where they both spent time abroad.
“It’s a really boring town with nothing in it, but it sounds cool,” Weiss said. “It’s got a mall.”
In a purposefully stark contrast to the band’s name, their sound is one filled with energy.
“Mainly just loud,” Gibson said. “It’s loud music. It’s loud, fun music. Genre – Loud.”
Dundrum plans to start recording original music in November, which the group intends to release on Spotify.

Gibson and Appelbaum are also members of the band Home Remedies along with guitarists and vocalists Max Cohen and Zach Basile. Basile and Cohen met at a concert that SMC and WRGW hosted, where they both covered songs by the band Modern Baseball while performing as solo artists. The similar taste in music, and long, flowing hair led them to grow close and start making music together.
The four eventually joined to form Home Remedies as they were planning to perform at the Sunrise GW Fossil Free Fest last spring.

Home Remedies is also working to record new music to debut its upcoming album, which will draw inspiration from the children’s book “Goodnight Moon,” by Margaret Wise Brown.
“There is wisdom in the book,” Basile said.
For now, the bands are both scheduled to perform at the DC 9 club Friday night from 7:30 to 10 p.m., along with other student musicians from GW.

Graban says she is influenced by the likes of Alicia Keys, whose song writing and production she finds inspiring. She said the community she has found with other artists at GW has made progressing as a musician easier.
While not officially a member of a band, she said she plans to collaborate with Dundrum and Home Remedies as a vocalist.

(L-R) Blake Ewing, Liza Mozolyuk, Bryan Fischer and Cliff Khowara, members of the band E-19, pose for a group portrait in Rome Hall.
For E-19, it all started in Mitchell Hall. In fall 2021, guitarist Cliff Khowara and keyboardist Bryan Fischer, who both also sing in the band, began playing music together. Not long after, Liza Mozolyuk heard them playing and asked if she could join. Drummer Blake Ewing followed and completed E-19, named for the intersection of 19th and E streets, where Mitchell Hall is located.
A year later, the band has progressed beyond just a group of friends jamming in a dorm room. They’re still good friends and hang out when they’re not practicing together, which they say contributes to their chemistry as a band.

Bryan Fischer and Cliff Khowara perform with their band E-19 at Lisner Auditorium in late August.
In its first year as a band, E-19 has played five shows on campus, including at First Night and a few gigs at Lisner Auditorium in August. They’ve released singles including “In 2” and “Out of the Orphanage,” the latter of which is also the name of their upcoming album.

Liza Mozolyuk belts out some notes at an E-19 band practice in the University Student Center Friday.
The band members describe their style as along the lines of alt-rock, but they each have a wide array of music tastes that combine during their writing process. They’re hoping the release of “Out of the Orphanage,” which they’re currently recording, will help them burst into the D.C. music scene. That’s not to say they’ll stop playing and collaborating at GW, but they want to branch out to playing at restaurants, clubs and wherever else they can get their instruments through the door.

Sophomore Alejandra Ramirez said she struggled to “keep in touch” with her culture during her freshman year with a predominately non-Hispanic roster but found a larger Hispanic community through student organizations, like the Organization of Latin American Students.
Tennis has always been a way of life for sophomore Alejandra Ramirez and junior Gabby Giraldo, but the cultural backdrop of their athletic careers hasn’t always translated to the court.
Ramirez, a second-generation Mexican American, and Giraldo, a native Colombian, have navigated a predominantly white playing field in the United States despite carrying cultural roots that have molded their athletic careers. As the only two Hispanic athletes on GW’s seven-player tennis roster, Ramirez and Giraldo have risen to integral roles on the team, securing two of GW’s three places in the regional Bedford Cup Finals earlier this month, where Ramirez took second place in singles and Giraldo earned first place in doubles.
“I’ve sacrificed so much for tennis,” Ramirez said. “I love the sport, I love the people that I’ve met, the opportunities that I’ve had where I’ve traveled to, it’s all because of tennis. ”
Now under the leadership of Head Coach George Rodriguez, who filled the position at GW in August and shares a Hispanic background, the two said they have found a home with the tennis program and “dad feel” in Rodriguez. During Hispanic Heritage Month, The GW Hatchet is profiling Hispanic athletes at GW to showcase their talent and spotlight the faces behind the stat lines.
“It was definitely hard, I definitely lost some Spanish,” Ramirez said. “It’s harder for me to talk about it more, but now this year with Gabi on the team, and now with our new head coach, it’s much better and it’s easier for me.”
Ramirez and Giraldo attended the same boarding school – Boca Prep International School in Boca Raton, Florida, which specializes in athletic training, including a strong tennis program – during their high school years. Ramirez arrived at GW for her freshman year, but Giraldo took a detour to the University of Houston for two years, where she attained a 19-12 singles record and earned singles crowns at the Texas Regional and the international Universal Tennis Rating Tournament.
Ramirez earned a 1-5 record for GW last season in the singles category but ranked among the top 1,200 worldwide tennis players by the International Tennis Federation. She said she struggled to keep in touch with her culture during her freshman year with a predominately non-Hispanic roster but found a larger Hispanic community across campus through student organizations, like the Organization of Latin American Students, to make her feel at home.
She said she misses the family-oriented nature of Hispanic culture, like when her grandparents would visit Texas from their hometown in Reynossa, Mexico and she would eat traditional dishes like pozole – a Mexican soup that has seasoned meat and garnished with lettuce, onions and garlic.
Ramirez said her father, a former Division III tennis player, inspired her to pursue her own tennis career, and she’s living out his dream of playing at the Division I level. She said she started playing tennis at the age of five, and she has not been able to drop the racket since.
“He was my coach, which definitely has its ups and downs,” Ramirez said. “But I think my relationship with my dad, it’s really special because tennis is such a huge part of my life. And he’s not only my dad, but he was also my coach.”
When Giraldo moved from Colombia to Florida as a 16-year-old to continue her academic and tennis careers at boarding school, she struggled to find her place so far away from home and the comfort of her family. Now at GW, Giraldo said the University has offered a support system through its Latino community, and she returns home during breaks in the school year to see her family and friends in Colombia, which she holds “really close to her heart.”
“I think also the Latinos that are here, we take care of each other at times because, again, we’re not that many,” Giraldo said. “But it’s a very good group, and it’s something I carry with myself, like my values and all that. So it’s definitely really good to be able to represent where I come from even though I’m so far from home.”
Giraldo has represented the national Colombian team in the Regional and World Championships in the 2022 season. Rodriguez said Giraldo has modeled the fight and commitment that he looks to set as the recruitment standard for the team in the coming seasons.
“I think having Gabby gives us a good foundation and a stronger foundation as a team, and she gives me a measurement of what I need to bring in talent that would match that or make it better,” Rodriguez said. “And when they say that is when you have someone like her that sets that bar high, my goal now – and I tell my team this – is to bring in people that are as high or even better to keep pushing or to keep making her better at the same time.”
Both players applauded Rodriguez’s leadership of the tennis team so far, advancing their athletic potential and supporting them through a sense of cultural understanding. Giraldo said he has made her transition to GW as smooth as possible, and Ramirez said he has provided mental support beyond the physical demands of the game.
“I love having that international presence because it does bring a different flare, a different dynamic to the team, a different way of thinking,” Rodriguez said. “And for me it’s getting to know each of my players on a more personal level and understanding their background as well, and they’re all different.”
With a special bond developed with his players, Rodriguez looks to chase the A-10 crown this season after the team showed encouraging results at Bedford Cup Finals in their first competition of a seemingly promising season.

The Medical Faculty Associates’ GW COVID-19 Recovery Clinic started providing treatments for long COVID in October of 2020 but closed in June 2022 due to staffing shortages. 
At the height of the pandemic in the fall of 2020, Aileen Chang founded GW’s COVID Recovery Clinic to treat patients with symptoms of long COVID.
Two years later, Chang, an associate professor of medicine at GW, said the clinic housed in the GW’s Medical Faculty Associates has been shut down for four months because of staffing shortages in the MFA. Long COVID, which affects 1 in 3 U.S. adults who catch COVID, causes long-term symptoms like shortness of breath and a lingering cough for months following an initial coronavirus infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
University spokesperson Lesley Swiger said patients’ long COVID care “transitioned” back to the MFA’s primary care office after the clinic closed.
“Our free-standing long COVID clinic is no longer in service, but instead, we have transitioned this care for our patients back into the primary care office, where strong comprehensive care will be of further benefit to patients on their post-COVID recoveries,” Swiger said.
Swiger said the transition allows the MFA to “broaden” patients’ access to care, while still referring patients to specialist physicians, physical therapists and other healthcare team members. Swiger declined to say why the clinic closed or how many staff were employed at the clinic and did not specifically say how patients’ care will expand.
“At the GW Medical Faculty Associates, we are proud to have offered one of the D.C. metro area’s first long COVID clinics, which has enabled us not only to serve our patients but also to learn a lot about caring for the illness,” Swiger said.
GW’s Center for Integrative Medicine started hosting virtual group sessions about different topics like nutrition, rehabilitation, integrative treatment and mindfulness for individuals struggling with long COVID in early September. Johns Hopkins University also runs a post-COVID-19 care clinic to provide specialized care to long COVID patients.
The most common symptoms of long COVID are a lingering cough, shortness of breath, fatigue and heart palpitations. Long COVID also causes neurological symptoms like brain fog, sleep problems, dizziness, depression and anxiety.
Aileen Chang said the clinic provided symptomatic treatments, which sought to mitigate a patient’s symptoms for those with long COVID struggling to return to their normal day activities. She said the GW Center for Integrative Medicine – GW’s contemporary and alternative medicine practice – is still seeing long COVID patients. Chang said people experiencing symptoms of long COVID can see specialized GW doctors, like those who focus on cardiology, physical therapy and other musculoskeletal issues that stem from long COVID.
“The most important message that I try to give patients right now is that after recovering from COVID it’s really important to give your body the time to rest that it needs so that it can recover after the infection,” Chang said.
Chang said treatments at the clinic included prescribing blood pressure medication for patients whose blood pressure would drop when standing up, prescribing patients struggling with depression or anxiety with antidepressants and assigning physical therapy to patients with joint pain.
“There are a lot of different presentations that come with long COVID and just being patient and trying to understand where the patient is coming from can be really helpful to helping them on a track to recovery,” Chang said.
Olivia Schwinn-Clanton, a junior majoring in public health, said she started showing symptoms of long COVID a month after catching the virus this May and is worried her fatigue symptoms will hurt her work as an EMT, which requires her to lift patients and heavy objects. She said she has trouble falling asleep at night because that is when her cough is the worst.
“Whenever I cough I’m always afraid that people are going to assume that I’m sick and have something,” Schwinn-Clanton said.
She said her doctor prescribed an albuterol inhaler – commonly used for respiratory conditions like asthma and bronchitis – as the only form of treatment she’s received for her symptoms. Schwinn-Clanton said she encourages people who think they might have long COVID to see a health professional because they can offer insight into symptoms and potential treatments for the condition.
“Still be cautious that there is a pandemic and that it still can affect you, and you should be aware of your surroundings and who you’re interacting with and what you’re doing that could put yourself at risk to get sick,” Schwinn-Clanton said.

Womble said her goal for the season is to make the A-10 Championship or the All-Conference team and see her team succeed at the tournament level.
With a spike of the volleyball from junior opposite Liv Womble, no unguarded pocket of the court is safe.
Womble has steered GW to an 11-9 record this fall while exploiting the opponents’ weaknesses in the court’s empty corners with in-game shot adjustments that power the team’s offense. The 2022 season has proven to be Womble’s first full regular season as a collegiate player after COVID-19 paused her freshman season and disrupted spurts of her sophomore season, a development she hopes will culminate in an Atlantic 10 Championship run.
Head Coach Katie Reifert said Womble has developed a special vision to decipher her opponents’ defensive front and place her hits accordingly to lift the Colonials to victory. As the team’s leading threat against the competition, Womble is pushing the fourth-place GW team closer to playoff contention after the team scraped together only two wins while losing 25 matches last season.
“Liv’s a competitor, she loves to compete, and winning drives her,” Reifert said. “It’s really precious, it’s fun to have her in the gym as a great energy source and competitor. As I was talking about before, Liv is very knowledgeable of our opponents, she studies up on who we’re playing next so that she can really expose their weaknesses.”
Unlike most college athletes, volleyball was not an integral part of Womble’s early sports career. Womble – who grew up in Wilmington, North Carolina – pursued track and basketball in grade school before joining the volleyball team in high school after a friend decided to try out for the team.
During her high school career, she achieved two All-District and All-Region honors at Robinson Secondary and went on to commit to GW to continue her volleyball career. After playing nearly every position in high school, Womble said she had trouble adjusting to college play her freshman year.
“When I first got here because when I was in high school, even in my position, I played all the way around,” Womble said. “It was a little bit different, like the speed of the game is vastly different when you get to college.”
She said she also struggled to regain her strength after losing muscle when the pandemic halted her freshman volleyball season, when the team only played 10 of its 16 scheduled matches in 2020. But Womble has adapted to the mental and physical aspects of collegiate volleyball with craftiness on the court, often faking the spike and tapping it over the net to dupe defenders.
“I would say she’s a very knowledgeable player,” Reifert said. “She is really gifted at seeing what’s in front of her and adjusting her shots and her swings to really take advantage of the situation.”
Womble said Reifert’s entry to the program this year and the new coaching staff that joined have helped fuel her winning mentality and evolution as a player. She said the coaching staff makes sure the team spends unfiltered time together and has rules like the “no phone policy” during team meals. She said Reifert prioritizes the team’s mentality and tries to boost morale for games and practices.
“She just told us that you’re only going to get as much joy as you put in,” Womble said. “That kind of mentality spreads onto the court, spreads into the bench, spreads into practice.”
Womble said her teammates have also played an integral role in the 2022 season as they look to support her play on and off the court during tough matches when she puts too much pressure on herself to lead the team’s offense. She said the team demands high-quality play from each other, which helps drive them throughout the season to continue winning.
“I think competitiveness always walks a very fine line of how you approach it,” Womble said. “There’s healthy competitiveness, and there’s sometimes toxic competitiveness. And I dabble in both areas sometimes, but I really do like to push my teammates as well as by demanding of them but leading by more of an example.”
Womble said her personal goal for the season is to make the A-10 Championship or the All-Conference team and see her team succeed at the tournament level. She said she’s more interested in making progress as a team through the development of their six freshman players, who continue to work on hitting their goals in practice.
“Our goal was win everything that we can and be the best that we can and make sure that we’ve prepared ourselves to go into that,” Womble said. “She calls it battle, she prepares us to go into a battle every time we go into a game.”

The Elliott School of International Affairs offers 22 courses on gender in international affairs – more than any other university in the D.C. area, officials said. 
Updated: Oct. 14, 2022 at 1:40 p.m.
The Elliott School of International Affairs started offering a new concentration this semester that will allow students to focus on the role of gender in the global landscape of security and politics.
Elliott School officials established the Gender in International Affairs concentration last spring after faculty and students advocated for a curricular focus on acknowledging the impact that global issues have on different genders. Gender in International Affairs will join concentrations like Conflict Resolution, Security Policy and International Economics, and will be the 16th concentration for undergraduates studying international affairs. 
Shirley Graham – the director of the Gender Equality Initiative in International Affairs, a group of Elliott School faculty and staff who promotes gender inclusivity in international affairs – said she created the concentration to make students more proficient in the growing field of gender in international affairs after her students expressed interest in the topic in past semesters. She said she presented the gender concentration to the dean of the Elliott School’s Council last spring, and the council approved the concentration with unanimous support.
The concentration requires students to take Masculinities in International Affairs and either Women in Global Politics or Women’s Rights and Gender Equality. Students enrolled in the concentration must also complete three additional courses that are connected to gender, like Women in Asia, Migration, Gender and International Development and Global Women’s Health Lecture.
She added that Elliott has 22 courses on gender in international affairs – more than any other university in the D.C. area.
“This makes the Elliott School a leader in the field of Gender in International Affairs by recognizing feminist international relations theory and gender analysis as critical tools in fully understanding processes of globalization, international development, humanitarian crises, violent extremism, conflict, peace and security,” Graham said in an email.
Elliott School students also have the option to choose a regional concentration like the Middle Eastern and African concentrations.
Graham said classes in the concentration will be taught through a “feminist, intersectional lens” which will expose students to issues relating to women, people of color and members of the LGBTQ+ community like women in leadership positions and gender-based violence.
“Graduates of this concentration will be able to draw on this analytical framework to explain current and emerging gender issues in international affairs and develop informed arguments and pragmatic policy recommendations in response,” Graham said.
Christina Fink, the director of the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science in International Affairs majors, said graduates of the concentration will be able to bring their perspectives in gender to a professional setting in political, economic and social institutions, which will help them work to create a more fair society for those of all genders.
“It enables people to get jobs after they graduate in which they can bring a gender lens to their work in the government or in the development sector and private industry or wherever they may end up,” Fink said.
She said many people think gender courses are only about women, but the focus of concentration is to tackle the challenges all genders face with inequality.
“The reality is when there are strict gender norms in a society, that has negative implications for men as well,” Fink said. “So addressing gender is about addressing both the challenges and opportunities or barriers to opportunities for men, women and everybody across the gender spectrum.”
Mona Samadi – an associate professor of religion who teaches Women in Islam, a class within the new Elliott School concentration – said the inclusion of all genders in international affairs decisions can foster “stability” and peace.
“Women and girls represent half of the world’s population, but they also represent half of the potential that countries have not taken a good usage of,” she said. “Gender equality, besides being a fundamental human right, is also proven that once women get to play a part in deciding how society should function, it leads to more peace, it leads to more potential within that society.”
Samadi said gender education is essential to understanding the biases and prejudices that affect how foreign policy is targeted toward certain groups.
“So much has changed, but also at times, it just feels like nothing has changed,” Samadi said. “We take a couple of steps forward only to take a couple of steps back. I think the biggest change I’ve realized, or shift is just realizing the differences between people and showing more respect to that and being more nuanced in understanding how people relate and so forth.”
Students in the Elliott School said focusing on gender, especially in national security, will help bridge gaps in an international affairs education that did not previously address women’s existence and priorities in international policy.
Mary Glavey, a sophomore in the Elliott School, said she’s been considering declaring a concentration in Gender in International Affairs after Graham introduced her to the focus. 
“Any data available on women’s security has proven to be very indicative of other conditions, and it’s just an important aspect to think about when learning about international affairs,” Glavey said.
This post has been updated to correct the following:
The Hatchet incorrectly reported that Women and Terrorism is a required course for the concentration. Women’s Rights and Gender Equality is a required course for the concentration. The Hatchet also reported that Fink said gender in academic settings usually only addresses women. Fink said many people think gender courses are only about women. We regret these errors.

Anton Ovchinnikov works as a professional choreographer, producing pieces for international festivals and serving as artistic director for his company, Black O!Range Dance Theatre.
A choreographer and performer from Kiev, Ukraine with a robust body of international artistic work to his name is bringing his expertise to the District this semester to guest choreograph for the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design’s Fall Dance Concert from November 17 to 19.
Anton Ovchinnikov’s piece for the concert next month will feature six students and three pieces of music, a Ukrainian folk song and two pieces of “electronic jazz contemporary” music, he said. For the piece’s contemporary choreography, a collaboration between himself and his students, he said he drew inspiration from the idea of unspoken words between people who once knew each other, but now are strangers.
“This was my idea, to explain to them what it is about, and now they can reflect this topic through their own bodies in their own choreography,” Ovchinnikov said.
Ovchinnikov said he met Corcoran dance professor Maida Withers when they connected in a dance class in Moscow twenty years ago, and years later, in 2018, they collaborated on a piece titled 60 MOVES with FUTURE GAZE. This work explored their shared choreographic style of postmodernism, a movement with roots in modern dance that aims to push the boundaries of the conventional dance world through individuality, which influences much of Anton’s choreographic work.
Ovchinnikov and Withers created 60 MOVES with FUTURE GAZE for the 60th anniversary of the National Exhibition Center of Ukraine, a building the Soviet Union constructed in 1949. Ovchinnikov said he and Withers drew inspiration from the juxtaposition of the Ukrainian dancers and the Soviet architecture, styling the dancer’s movements so that they interacted directly with the building, weaving around the grand, neoclassical columns and down the wide staircase.
“All the dancers who participated in the performance were born after Ukraine became independent,” Ovchinnikov said. “So it was a kind of new generation that had never been living in the Soviet Union.”
Ovchinnikov visited GW in 2019 for the first time to teach choreography to Corcoran dance students at Withers’ invitation, as the two remained in touch. Having returned to the District again, Ovchinnikiov performed an original piece Friday at the opening of LEGACY: Fifty Years of Dance on the Edge, a celebration of Withers’ career at the gallery at the Corcoran.
Ovchinnikov said he admires the dance program at Corcoran for giving students the opportunity to pursue academic majors in addition to dance, affording them “a much wider vision of the world.” He taught choreography at the Kiev National University of Culture and Arts, where he also earned degrees in theater direction and choreography, for more than 10 years.
In addition to teaching, Ovchinnikov works as a professional choreographer, producing pieces for international festivals and serving as artistic director for his company, Black O!Range Dance Theatre. Ovchinnikov established the company in 2005 and works mainly with students and fellow alumni of the National University of Culture and Arts.
Ovchinnikov brings a vibrant range of experiences to his dancers from his career spent presenting his work at festivals across Europe and collaborating with fellow creatives like Withers. Before arriving in D.C. this fall, he said he spent two months traveling to dance festivals and artistic forums in countries like Lithuania, Hungary and Germany to perform original choreography and present Monochrome, the dance film he created this year.
Monochrome is a 15-minute feature filmed and edited by Ovchinnnikov as an expression of the “depression and despair” of his home country after Russian troops invaded in February. The film opens in black and white, revealing Ovchinnikov dancing alone in a shallow pond to electronic-style music of his own composition while color slowly sets in.
“After the war started, I had not been dancing for six weeks or two months or something like that because I didn’t feel like I could dance,” Ovchinnikov said. “And then right away, I decided to create this film and because I started dancing again, I really felt that it brought me back to living. So it was the idea that dance can bring back this feeling of the world to have colors.”
Ovchinnikov said he has been able to travel internationally as an artist during the conflict with permission from the Ukrainian Minister of Culture and Information Policy. He said the Ukrainian government has supported artists like himself who have presented their artistic expressions of the Ukrainian cause to raise support and awareness of the war abroad.
At home in Ukraine, the artistic community has faced devastating losses and many artists have left Ukraine, seeking safety and work, he said. However, those that remain have used their work “as a weapon” to create an artistic outlet for civilians and throw festivals for all mediums of art to raise funds for the Ukrainian army.
“Most of the works were created after the war started and reflect the situation and the feelings of the people, sometimes something that happened in the past destroyed cities and villages, so everything which can especially give motivation for people to continue to live in Ukraine and create and also to have this feeling of community again,” Ovchinnikov said.

Though the clock is ticking to determine the University’s next moniker by the 2023-24 academic year, the consensus that GW needs to move past its divisive former moniker hasn’t made it easier to decide on a new one. With suggestions for the new name ranging from Revolutionaries to Riverhorses, officials will have plenty of options to choose from after garnering feedback online and during Alumni and Families’ Weekend earlier this month. Now, we’re throwing our support behind GW’s next mascot – take off your tricorn hats and say hello to the Hippos.
Our favorite mammalian moniker is already popular with the student body. And Hippopotamuses, or Hippos for short, is everything that Colonials wasn’t – it’s divorced from the ugly history of colonialism and racism that marked our use of Colonials. The hippo has already found its way into students’ hearts, whether as the statue outside Lisner Auditorium or on GW-branded merchandise across campus. By picking Hippos as the University’s next moniker, officials can create a campus culture in which everyone feels welcome and bolster GW’s school spirit in years to come.
A 21st-century university deserves something better than a 20th-century distortion of 18th-century history. In a period of racially tinged nostalgia for the American Revolution, a single administrator picked Colonials in 1926 to replace other nicknames that students previously used to describe themselves. The new moniker’s meaning wasn’t lost on students – fraternities and residence hall associations decorated their lawns with GW Colonials slaughtering William and Mary Indians for the football team’s 1946 homecoming game.

The Colonials moniker carried GW through the last century, but it’s grossly out of touch today. The personification of the Colonials moniker exemplifies why it can no longer, if it ever did, unite students.  GW can’t squeeze out school spirit from students who understand colonialism as a historical fact, not a mere costume.
That brings us to Hippos, which are expressly apolitical. The University’s love of the hippo began when former University President Stephen Joel Trachtenberg gifted the now-iconic hippo statue that stands at the corner of H and 21st streets to the Class of 2000. Unlike Colonials, which was foisted upon the University community, students have made the hippo their own. Some 20 years later, they’ve literally left their mark on the hippo, rubbing its bronze tusks and ears out of admiration and as a tradition for good luck.
Even as GW has continued to “hail to the Buff and Blue” in recent years, the hippo hasn’t been far behind. Officials are well aware of the grip that the hippo has on campus, from its appearance at campus events, in promotions and on merchandise sold in the campus store. And what better mascot is there for GW’s sports teams than the hippo, one of the strongest animals on Earth?
Others suggested monikers fall short of our beloved Hippos. Revolutionaries, Patriots or Generals would allow GW to shed its overt Colonial branding while maintaining its early American aesthetic. But that’s a cheap move both financially and morally. If the inventory in the campus store remains practically the same pre- and post-Colonials, then what good did the moniker change accomplish?
And like Colonials, these historically inspired monikers ignore the facts in favor of a flashy brand name. Aside from a visit from the French military leader Marquis de Lafayette in 1824 and Columbian College’s namesake change in 1904, GW doesn’t boast deep historic ties to the American Revolution. Nor do these names set GW apart – George Mason University uses Patriots for their athletic teams across state lines, not to mention the NFL team out of New England. Revolutionaries might celebrate students’ commitment to political change, and Patriots or Generals could honor GW’s military students and alumni, but these monikers can’t resonate with every student. Their close association with politics and war would likely subject them to the same scrutiny as Colonials.
Unlike Colonials or these other monikers, Hippos can be a symbol for students to rally around on game days or events that require no reckoning with history. It’s a mascot that can trot out at half time without making national news. And most of all, it’s something that can bring every member of the GW community together.
If this discussion amounts to overanalyzing GW’s moniker, then we’ve done our job. And we hope officials will be just as careful in their considerations. This University has known the Colonials moniker for nearly 100 years of change, from the highs of the roaring 1920s to the lows of our not-so-roaring 2020s. Let’s replace it with the Hippopotamuses, a name that can truly last through the next century.
Officials have a chance to pick a moniker that encapsulates GW’s values and vision for the foreseeable future – don’t mess it up.
