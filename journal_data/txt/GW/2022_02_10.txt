The Student Bar Association Senate passed two pieces of legislation updating the SBA’s bylaws on student organizations and SBA elections at its meeting Tuesday.
The Student Organization Bylaw Reorganization Act revises the bylaws to allow law student organizations more flexibility when applying for recognition from the SBA. SBA Sen. Nicole Karem, a second-year law student who introduced the act, said the previous bylaws pertaining to student organizations were “outdated and in need of revision” to be more accommodating.
“It was really just a matter of trying to be respectful of students’ time while also giving them the option and giving the senate the option to hear from them if needed,” Karem said.
The act allows organizations seeking SBA recognition to submit and resubmit constitutions for their organizations in a “reasonable amount of time” while previous bylaws limited submissions to one per semester. The senate can invite leaders of a student organization seeking to become an official organization to speak before the senate to discuss their organization and how many members they have instead of requiring all student organizations seeking recognition to speak in front of the senate, according to the legislation.
The senate passed the Omnibus Election Rules Amendment Act, updating the SBA’s bylaws to reflect procedural changes, like updating the definition of electoral constituencies. The new bylaws will require senate candidates to seek the permission of opponents when mentioning them in their campaign materials or speeches under the legislation.
The senate also allocated more than $400 to a student organization advocating for Uyghur minorities at its meeting Tuesday to help fund its spring operations. SBA Sen. Jaden Taylor, a first-year law student who introduced the bill, said the SBA would fund a t-shirt sale run by the Uyghur Human Rights Initiative – a student organization established in 2020 to advocate for Uyghur minorities in China.
The SBA distributed about $150 to the Intellectual Property and Entertainment Law Brief to cover food costs for its first general interest meeting. SBA Sen. Bree Vculek, a third-year law student who introduced the bill to grant the funds, said the organization plans to write blog posts “in the sphere of intellectual property.”
The senate failed to override SBA President Jordan Michel’s veto on a bill, by a 9-to-14 vote, that approved a survey for the senate to send to faculty and administrators. The bill, introduced by SBA Sen. Garett May, would have sent a survey to law school faculty asking whether the availability of take-home tests in the spring semester would be more beneficial for students instead of traditional in-person exams.
Michel said he vetoed the bill because he felt he and faculty addressed the concerns cited in the bill, like the “dramatic issues” the MyLaw outage caused in December, without needing to send out a survey. He said he was “frustrated” by the bill because he felt it was giving too much responsibility to the executive branch by allowing it to create the questions and asked the senate to do more research on virtual exams before reintroducing the bill.
“I’ve seen bills come out that asked questions, half of which were answered through an email that I sent out by myself, by faculty, by admin two weeks earlier,” Michel said.
Karem, who voted to override the veto, said she felt the materials on virtual and in-person exams provided by the executive branch were difficult to find when writing this bill. She said it was “unfair” of Michel to assume the senate should know exactly who to contact when researching the bill.
“We’re all out here working really hard,” Karem said. “This idea that we should inherently know who we should have asked questions of when the senate and the exec are separate is completely unfair to us.”
The SBA Senate will hold its next meeting Feb 22 at 9:15 p.m. in the Law Learning Center.
This post has been updated to clarify the following:
This story has been updated to clarify that the senate’s attempt to Michel’s veto failed with 14 opposed and nine in favor.

GW’s squad was able to shut down the seventh-best 3-point shooting team in the country on their way to victory.
Men’s basketball picked up their second road win of the season and their ninth consecutive win against Massachusetts Wednesday night.
The Colonials (9-13, 5-5 A-10) were in control for much of the game and were able to close it out 77–68 thanks to a 5-0 run in the last 2:24 of the game. The Minutemen (10-12, 3-7 A-10) came into the game as the seventh-best three point shooting team in the country, shooting 39.6 percent from beyond the arc, but the Colonials held them to just 8-of-27 from three point range.
“They’re a really good three point shooting team,” head coach Jamion Christian said. “But we’re also a very good three point defensive team. We had a plan going into the game we thought would work and we had a secondary defensive plan that we thought we might need to use in terms of switching.”
Massachusetts started out hot, shooting 4-of-5 from three point range, leading 14-8 going into the first media timeout. After that, GW adjusted to their alternate defensive plan and locked down their perimeter defense while settling into the game offensively.
Junior guard James Bishop spearheaded the team’s attack early, scoring 12 of his game-high 24 points in the first half to start another strong night offensively despite finishing the game 0-of-5 from beyond the arc.
But perhaps the most important aspect of his performance was the defensive work he did on junior guard Noah Fernandes.
Coming into the game, Fernandes was the Minutemen’s leading scorer with 15.7 points per game. Bishop, who guarded Fernandes most of the night, limited him to four points on 1-of-11 shooting, not allowing him to score until 36 minutes into the game.
“James has been outstanding for us defensively.” Christian said. “And then, our switching, I thought affected him, it affected his rhythm, how he was able to play.”
The Colonials controlled the glass all night, finishing with a 41 to 29 rebounding advantage and a 12 to 6 edge on the offensive boards, allowing GW to outscore Massachusetts 36-30 in the paint.
At halftime, GW was leading 43-38 thanks in part to an efficient outing from freshman guard Brayon Freeman, who had nine points on 4-of-5 shooting to go along with three assists, two rebounds and a steal.
Freeman maintained his good form after the half, hitting a few off balance, contested shots to go along with impressive finishes at the rim and wily passes to his teammates. The DMV native finished with 15 points, five rebounds, five assists and a steal in a team-high 36 minutes.
Senior forward Ricky Lindo Jr. grabbed six defensive boards and blocked a shot in limited minutes. Lindo was in and out of the game due to an injury, but Christian said he will play a key part in GW’s next game.
“Ricky’s a great player, a great defensive player,” Christian said. “He does a lot of things at such a high level. We wanted to be a little conservative with him because it’s such a big game on Saturday.”
Mid-way through the second half, the Colonials slowed down offensively. Eight minutes into the second half the Colonials were only shooting 27 percent from the field, but still held a 56–51 lead.
“We missed about four layups in about a five-minute span.” Christian said. “So you know, it’s really just about not overreacting.”
Graduate student guard Brendan Adams had 15 points, five assists, two rebounds and two steals, earning him ‘George’s Chain of Command’. The chain acts as a ‘Player of the Game’ trophy and is a new addition this season.
After struggling with an injury at the beginning of conference play, Adams has been a key contributor for the Colonials recently.
After junior forward Hunter Dean split a pair of free throws to make it 75–68 with 1:40 remaining, graduate student guard Rich Kelly missed a long three-pointer that would have pulled Massachusetts within four points. Minutemen head coach Matt McCall opted not to foul, allowing the Colonials to close the game out.
“No one picked us where we are now,” Christian said. “We’ve got a lot of work ahead of us. I never allow people to put my team or myself in a box. We’re going to be as good as how much we learn and we’ve been learning a ton.”
The Colonials continue their three game road trip on Saturday at Dayton, who sits third in the A-10 and beat GW 83-58 on Jan. 8 at the Smith Center. Tip-off is scheduled for 2 p.m.

Neither the Colonials nor the Dukes could pull away for almost the entire game before GW was able to ultimately prevail.
Women’s basketball took down Atlantic 10 rival Duquesne on the road in a tight matchup.
The Colonials (8-14, 1-8 A-10) defeated Duquesne (9-14, 4-7 A-10) 50–48 to snap an eight-game losing streak and nab their first conference win. GW held the Dukes to just 23.7 percent shooting from the field and topped the rebounding battle 45 to 37, with walk-on freshman guard Maxine Engel pulling down 11 boards on her own.
Redshirt junior forward Mayowa Taiwo led the way for the Colonials, hitting 5-of-6 from the field combined with three trips to the line to cap a 15-point performance. On the other end of the court, graduate student guard Libby Bazelak spearheaded the Dukes, sinking 4-of-10 from the floor to go along with nine rebounds.
Defense was the go-to for both teams on Wednesday, with neither the Colonials nor the Dukes finding any rhythm on offense in the first half. The first quarter featured a back-and-forth bout with both teams strapped for points, as GW shot for 4-of-14 and Duquesne for 3-of-13 from the field to knot the game up at 10–10 by the first-quarter buzzer.
Just four minutes into the second quarter, the Colonials had held Duquesne to just 10 points, underscoring a stellar defensive performance that saw most of the Dukes’ half-court sets being worked deep into the shot clock. The second quarter featured more of the same, with the first score coming a full two minutes in.
With 2:13 left to play in the half, sophomore guard Taylor Webster knocked down a three to give GW their largest lead of the night, putting them ahead by six.
But if the Colonials anticipated a significant run to end the first half, Dukes’ sophomore center Precious Johnson had different ideas. Johnson scored five unanswered points, including a last-second three to cut the GW lead to just one at the break.
At half, the Colonials had notched only four assists combined with 10 turnovers. Despite that ratio, GW managed to maintain their lead and start the second half with the advantage.
In a recurring trend for the night, the Colonials dominated the paint, doubling Duquesne’s points there in the first and controlled the boards on both offense and defense. GW would finish the night with 28 points in the paint compared to the Dukes’ 12, despite conceding 18 turnovers and allowing 24 points off the turnovers in total.
Within a two-and-a-half minute span in the third quarter, the Dukes put together five unanswered from the field, prompting Head Coach Caroline McCombs to call a momentum-halting timeout with 6:31 left in the quarter.
The back-and-forth battle continued in the third, with neither side gaining an advantage of more than four points as play progressed. As the quarter drew to a close, the Dukes led by two, just before sharpshooter freshman guard Tess Myers hit a buzzer-beater three to put Duquesne on top by five with a score of 37–32.
In the final quarter, Duquesne held their biggest lead of the night of six points and a score of 40–34 with just more than six minutes to go. But the Colonials were not to be denied, holding their rivals scoreless for the next four minutes.
In the closing quarter alone, Taiwo continued to lead, dropping six points to help mount the comeback the Colonials needed. Her layup with 1:34 remaining gave GW the lead for the first time since the opening half, setting up a must-foul situation for the Dukes.
The Colonials were able to capitalize on the fast break in the second half in a way they hadn’t in the first, grabbing 11 points off of defensive rebounds and turnovers.
Both teams traded free throws as the final quarter wound down, before a Bazelak trey brought the Dukes within one with two seconds left. Webster converted her free throw with one second left to seal the win in Pittsburgh.
The victory closes the chapter on a four-game road swing as the Colonials head back home to take on St. Bonaventure on Saturday for a 2 p.m. tipoff.

A section of Kogan Plaza will likely be closed for at least a few more days as officials repair a broken pipe that has led to water leaks, steam and ice in the heart of campus.
A small zone of Kogan in front of Gelman Library has been taped off for more than a week as the area undergoes water and steam leakages. Baxter Goodly, the University’s associate vice president of facilities planning, construction and management, said the leaks stem from a broken underground condensate line, a pipe associated with steam heating that extracts moisture from buildings.
Goodly said in an email that officials taped off the area to protect pedestrians from slipping on ice or water that gathered due to the leaks, but the leak is not impacting nearby buildings. He said he expects the space in Kogan to be closed until temporary repairs to the pipe are completed, which he expects will happen near the end of the week.
“The repair will include digging up the ground to reach the broken pipe and make the repair,” he said in the email. “The permanent repair will be completed during the spring when the steam line can be secured.”

Last week, when a professor in my class asked for volunteers to write something on a whiteboard, my hand immediately shot up. It was an opportunity to be an active participant in the learning experience, which I would not have been motivated to take advantage of two years ago when classes first moved online. 
During winter break, the prospect of a normal, uninterrupted semester looked bleak for students. As the Omicron variant led to a dramatic increase in COVID-19 infections, both here in the District and all over the globe, I began to worry that we might return to entirely online instruction, that perhaps we would not get to return at all.
This fear did not come to pass. Thanks to GW’s vaccine mandate and rigorous on-campus testing, we were able to return to the classroom and participate in in-person student organization events after a brief delay at the beginning of this semester. But when we finally got back in the classroom, a glum feeling began to sink in. I’d been in this headspace before: believing the disruptions were finally over during the summer and then having to mask back up in the spring, and then being blindsided when Omicron showed up and seemed to infect nearly everyone in my life. 
I couldn’t stop thinking about how unpredictable the world really is, and the pandemic only accentuating that unpredictability. I wish I could say that we won’t ever have to worry about being pushed back online again, but nobody can say that with certainty. I found myself at every class, every club meeting and every hangout with a group of friends enveloped in a cloud of negativity. But then it hit me – I’m never going to know how long the good times will last. Pandemic or not, the world around us is inherently temporary. The only way to get the most out of my college experience while we’re here is to enjoy it while it lasts. I volunteered in that class because I value now more than ever the feeling of being just a little more involved, a little more immersed in the material.
Attending class virtually made me feel detached from the learning experience. It’s easy to zone out or get away with participating much less than you might in person, and nobody will notice. It feels nice to be able to relax, but in the end we get out what we put in, and putting forth less effort harms us as students.
Perhaps the most important piece of an in-person college experience is our ability to engage with one another socially. If we can’t see our friends, is this even a college campus? The part of losing out on my in-person freshman year that hit me the hardest was the fact that I’d have to meet most of my peers on Instagram, and my biggest fear about what Omicron could do to this semester was that I wouldn’t be able to see the people I had gotten so close with in the fall. Moving forward, I’m not going to take these important connections for granted, to do so would be to throw away one of the best parts of going to college.
I get to spend time with my friends primarily through student organizations, which were not permitted to hold gatherings until the end of January, about two weeks after in-person classes resumed. Before that time, meetings had to be conducted via Zoom. It felt like 2022 was 2020 all over again. Since campus has opened back up, I haven’t been late to a single meeting. I have decided to leave it all on the field from now on, in all of my extracurricular activities, because it is impossible to know how long we’ll have the opportunity to meet with our favorite clubs. It would be foolish to waste the time we’ve been given now by doing the bare minimum in the student organizations you are a part of by missing meetings or limiting your own participation. It is important for me to go above and beyond for the clubs I’m passionate about, and I hope that my peers are doing the same. 
We never know what the future holds, or what it has in store for us and the people around us. It’s scary to think about, but we can choose to be motivated by this feeling of uncertainty rather than discouraged by it. See the people you care about now, as often as you can. Take some friends to a concert, go to the zoo or to a Capitals game. Don’t let your busy schedule distract you from getting in touch with some of the people you might not get to see as often as you’d like in the future. You never know how long this window of opportunity will be open. Presumably, the world has more hurdles to throw at us. But rather than letting negativity overtake us, let’s enjoy being alive in D.C., while we still can.

Try some delicious snacks like beer-battered onion rings and Bavarian pretzels while watching the game at Church Hall. 
With the Super Bowl just around the corner, it’s time to make plans for how you plan to celebrate the unofficial holiday.
In addition to the actual football game, the Super Bowl is about the food, friends and especially the commercials. Finding a place to watch it is key to having a fun time – hit up one of these five D.C. sports bars to watch the Rams take on the Bengals in the 56th Super Bowl.
Church Hall
This popular Georgetown sports bar is located just off M Street at 1070 Wisconsin Ave. NW. When you walk in, take your pick between the spacious, traditional first floor or the loft area. The lofted second floor gives you a less crowded space to tune into the game, and you can relax on one of the big leather couches while you enjoy your drinks and appetizers. Order up some beer-battered onion rings, giant Bavarian pretzels and sweet potato tots to pair with your drink of choice. Enjoy the rustic, laid back vibe of Church Hall while you sit back to watch the game. This year’s Super Bowl kicks off at 6:30 p.m., so arrive at Church Hall a little early to take advantage of their happy hour prices which include $5 beers and house liquor.
Dirty Water
Dirty Water Bar is a Boston-themed sports bar in the H Street Corridor found at 816 H St. NE. Expect your classic sports bar with plenty of TVs to watch the Super Bowl from every angle possible. The exposed brick walls are filled with posters from Boston sports teams, and though the city is not represented in the Super Bowl this year, it is still a lively environment that will ensure you have a good time. Grab a couple orders of your favorite appetizers and drinks while you enjoy the down-to-earth vibe of the bar.
Rocket Bar
Head over to Rocket Bar at 714 7th Street NW in Chinatown to both watch the game and play some games. The spacious bar provides several shuffleboard tables, darts, pool and arcade games. Be sure to take advantage of happy hour, which runs from 4 to 8 p.m. daily. Rocket Bar is known for its beers, so order a few pints while they are only $4 during happy hour. The spot offers plenty of bartop seating throughout the spacious underground location, making it the optimal location if you want to enjoy the game with a large group of friends.
Penn Social
Stop by Penn Social, a sister bar of Church Hall, located at 801 E St. NW. This bar is divided up into an outside patio bar open seasonally, a coxy street-level bar with games and couches and a spacious underground bar with several TVs and a large stage. Feel free to move between the bars to see which you like best. Happy hour runs from 4 to 7 p.m. The space is outfitted with a 22-foot TV screen, perfect for big games like the Super Bowl. You can even take an online tour before heading out to see if this bar is right for you. There is also plenty of table setting so you can enjoy your favorite Super Bowl snacks while watching the game.
Union Pub
If you are looking for a spot to watch the game and enjoy some stellar food, hit up Union Pub at 201 Massachusetts Ave. NE in the Stanton Park neighborhood. The new menu includes items like Arepas, sweet plantains, crispy brussel sprouts and cachapas. The venue is on the smaller side, so this is the optimal place to go if you’re interested in watching the game with a small group of friends in a lively atmosphere. Pair your favorite drink with any item on the menu to have a culinary experience with a side of football.

If you’re not in a relationship and are still looking to have fun for the holiday, there’s a variety of activities you can do alone and with friends to make the most of Valentine’s Day.
Whether you’re looking forward to or dreading Valentine’s Day, consider some enticing ways to spend the day spreading and feeling love.
D.C. is certainly a sublime place to be on the 14th if you have someone special to spend it with, but the holiday has just as much to offer if you’re planning to go about the day alone or with your friends. If you don’t have a boo this year, direct your love toward yourself, your best friend and your favorite things to do.
Unfortunately, Valentine’s Day falls on Monday this year, but you can do any of these things the Sunday before, or just implement them into your daily routine to still feel like it’s a special day.
Treat yourself
If you choose to take on the day alone, start it off with your favorite coffee and breakfast. Whether that means grabbing a coffee and bagel from the recently opened West End location of Call Your Mother or trying something sweet from Boulangerie Christophe in Georgetown, treat yourself to a short, understated walk and a meal you wouldn’t go for on any ordinary day.
Wind down with a night of self care. Watch a movie you’ve seen a million times or start a feel-good, guilty pleasure show like the new season of Love Is Blind, which arrives on Netflix Friday. Make it a wine night and order a bottle of red or white from Foxtrot along with some chocolate or ice cream.
Embark on an excursion
If you’re in an active, adventurous mood, opt for a solitary day trip. Commit to an activity you love or excites you – something you’ve wanted to do for a while that you just never got around to.
Start your day at the Hirshhorn Museum visiting the immersive audiovisual experience “Laurie Anderson: The Weather.” Follow up with a walk through the Sculpture Garden, where you can browse through more than 20 figures like the striking “AMOR” sculpture, or stop in for a snack at the Pavilion Café. Alternatively, visit the National Arboretum or take yourself shopping in Georgetown and end the afternoon at the Waterfront.
Celebrate platonic love
Valentine’s Day is also the perfect excuse to plan you and your friends’ ideal day. Opt for a luxurious bottomless brunch at El Centro, The Fainting Goat or Agora lasting a few hours, then explore the exciting neighborhood surrounding the respective restaurant.
After that, the world is your oyster. Since the weather on Monday is expected to be chilly, choose from a variety of indoor excursions to take your friends on – head to District Winery for a wine tasting or spend a few hours at the Van Gogh Immersive Exhibit, which is open in D.C. until March.
Brave the cold with a hike through Rock Creek Park or on Theodore Roosevelt Island, or pack your favorite drinks and snacks for a picnic at the monuments or the National Cathedral. That night, go out for karaoke, a nice dinner you wouldn’t usually splurge on or attend Black Cat’s free Valentine’s Day Rock and Roll party.
Get creative, get out of your comfort zone and remind yourself that your love is not reserved only for a significant other. It is for everyone and everything you love: music, movies, food, sports, art, your friends and yourself.

Phillip Troutman is an assistant professor of writing and of history and the director of Writing in the Disciplines. 
It’s time we finally abandon the Colonials moniker. It’s been almost three years since students voted to drop the term and nearly two years since the Board of Trustees approved a framework for renaming and commissioned the Special Committee on the Colonials Moniker. Last semester, the Board of Trustees announced that they would make a decision about whether to rename the moniker this academic year, so it’s possible that the decision could come soon.
Our use of “Colonials” is damning, embracing a celebration of the North American colonial project, including the enslavement and murder of Africans and genocidal wars against Native American nations. Its adoption by GW in 1926 made no logical sense, and its use by GW thereafter reveals its racist origins. And in the international context of GW’s research and teaching, its continued use is entirely inappropriate.
George Washington never used the term “colonial” to describe himself or his Continental Army. To him, “colonial” was a pejorative term describing British power over Anglo-American subjects who thought of themselves as British citizens. Nor did the 1821 founding of Columbian College, nearly 40 years after independence, have anything to do with the colonial era. In fact, some early donors hoped it could fulfill George Washington’s vision of a national university in the nation’s capital. This was a forward-looking, nation-building idea, not one that looked backward to the colonial past.
So, how did GW become the Colonials? It has only been our nickname since 1926, more than a century after our founding and 22 years after we became The George Washington University in 1904. And it was done more or less by administrative fiat.
In 1926, then-University President William Lewis was unhappy with the various sports nicknames used by students, including Hatchetites, Hatchetmen and Axemen, according to the 1970 history of the University by Elmer Louis Kayser, a GW historian who was also a top-level administrator. Lewis found them “obnoxious” due to “their lack of any euphony,” – that is, they weren’t pleasing to Lewis’ ear – so he instructed Kayser to “find a better name and try to get it accepted” by students. The name Kayser chose was Colonials. On Oct. 27, 1926, The Hatchet – which was not yet independent of the University – declared that GW’s moniker going forward would be the Colonials. There was no broader student discussion or input – unlike the 2019 referendum. And because The Hatchet’s 1926 announcement parroted Kayser’s language–complaining that the prior names “were not entirely euphonious”–it’s possible that Kayser even wrote the announcement himself.
But why Colonials? If Kayser and The Hatchet’s editors at the time were celebrating General Washington and his army, then why not choose, say, Revolutionaries or Continentals? The answer lies in the early 20th-century Colonial Revival, a cultural movement that glorified and mythologized British North America’s colonial era as a golden age of white, Christian homogeneity. Historians have linked the movement to elite and middle-class white populations’ fears of an increasingly urban and diverse United States being reshaped by ethnic immigrant communities and African Americans who were increasingly mobile, both geographically and socially. Organizations like the Daughters of the American Revolution romanticized colonial “heritage” in architecture, antiques, arts and crafts, historic preservation, monument building, history and literature. Paradoxically, the 1920s revivalists conflated their vision of stability and gentility with one of revolutionary patriotism. In their minds, the “colonials” were, somehow, simultaneously revolutionaries.
The Hatchet’s editors made this colonial/revolutionary slippage in 1926, asserting that GW’s colors, “the Continental Army buff and blue,” were “the colors of Colonial America.” They went on to assert, with tortured logic, that “George Washington University, in its antecedents, is a colonial school. Dating back to very early post-Revolutionary days, it was founded when the term ‘colonial’ still applied to an era which was then passing.” No one in 1821 would have thought we were a “colonial school,” but in 1926, being a “colonial” was fashionably nostalgic. GW students seem to have understood the violence of colonization implicitly. For the football team’s 1946 homecoming game, for example, fraternities and residence hall associations decorated their public lawns with life-size papier-mâché caricatures of GW “Colonials” slaughtering William and Mary “Indians” in various fashion. This is what colonization means, as GW’s Students for Indigenous and Native American Rights and many international students understand.
Colonials is a term that was chosen by administrators to replace more organic nicknames used by students. It was imposed without general student input. The logic used to impose it was nonsensical. It represented a nostalgic vision of a lily-white golden age, romanticizing genocidal war and slavery. And today it does not represent the values of GW students or the University as a whole. It’s past time to change it.

Since Title IX went into effect during the Nixon administration, the law has promoted equality in education and confronted sex-based discrimination. 
The Atlantic 10 Conference is commemorating the 50th anniversary of the passage of Title IX amendment.
The legislation, signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1972, banned sex-based discrimination at educational institutions that receive federal funds. The A-10 has pledged to honor the anniversary throughout its semicentennial year and will display a commemorative logo throughout winter, spring and fall A-10 finals and will conclude at the 2022 Volleyball Championship in November.
“On behalf of the A-10, it is a privilege to honor and celebrate this landmark legislation,” A-10 Commissioner Bernadette McGlade said in a release. “Personally and professionally Title IX has had a profound effect on me as well as so many.”
Passed June 23, 1972, as part of the Education Amendments, Title IX has served to promote equality in education, as well as to root out sex-based discrimination, including those based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Prior to its passage, restrictive quotas, unequal scholarships and other discriminatory practices were commonplace.
“No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance,” the amendment states.
The amendment has been crucial to equal opportunity in athletics, boosting participation in women’s high school sports sevenfold since its passage in 1972. Moreover, since 1982, Division I schools have seen the highest ratio of women’s sports participation rate to men’s, from 29.8 percent to 46.7 percent as of 2016.
Among the celebrations, the A-10 conference promoted their new “What it Means to Me” campaign, an effort to highlight the importance of Title IX in providing equal and accessible access to students and staff around the league. The campaign will feature stories from A-10 student-athletes, coaches, administrators and alums whose lives have been impacted by Title IX and will be told through social media, videos and the Atlantic 10 website.

SA Sen. Sofia Packer, U-at-Large, sponsored the resolution urging officials to eliminate research funding from the fossil fuel industry. 
The Student Association Senate passed a resolution calling on the University to phase out research funding received from fossil fuel industry companies Monday.
Senators unanimously passed the No Fossil Fuel Money Act, sponsored by SA Sen. Sofia Packer, U-at-Large, calling on administrators to eventually ban research funding from the fossil fuel industry, including from companies like Exxon Mobil and Chevron. The resolution comes as Sunrise GW continues its campaign pressuring officials to enact a ban on funding from a line of the country’s largest fossil fuel companies through protests and a petition.
“If not for the sake of future generations and for our planet, then for the sake of academic honesty and the principles on which GW rests, we need to commit to phasing out funding from the worst offenders of the climate crisis,” Packer said.
Sunrise GW has openly opposed GW’s ties to fossil fuel companies over the past two years, pushing for the closure of the Regulatory Studies Center and demanding divestment from the fossil fuel industry – a commitment that GW announced last year.
“We are very happy that the SA did the right thing and called on the administration to enact a ban on funding from the fossil fuel industry at GW,” Sunrise GW said in a statement. “We hope that this will signal to the administration and the Board of Trustees the student body’s support of the No Fossil Fuel Money campaign and that they will act to end the influence of the fossil fuel industry on campus.”
Various SA leaders called for the University to fire Alicia Bitler, a GWTeach professor who said the N-word during class on anti-racism, and Marie Matta, a business school professor who denied a student’s service dog from class, during public comment and prepared remarks. SA President Brandon Hill said that he and SA Vice President Kate Carpenter both recently met with interim University President Mark Wrighton to discuss the incidents and call for the professors’ removal.
Hill said members of the executive branch met with representatives from the Princeton Review and GW Libraries administrators last week to purchase GRE, LSAT and MCAT preparation books for the Top Textbooks program in Gelman Library, which reserves books for courses with expensive courses for all GW students. He also announced he joined other student government presidents in calling for President Joe Biden to cancel student debt.
Carpenter read from a statement on behalf SA Sen. Gabriel Young, CCAS-U, who was not at the meeting, saying he was concerned about posters placed on campus depicting a Chinese curler pushing a coronavirus molecule because it could be interpreted as racist toward Asian students on campus.
“Throughout the pandemic, the Asian American community has been a target of racial violence due to the violent rhetoric associated with the Asian American community with the virus due to the impacts of geopolitical rhetoric,” Young said in his statement.
Christy Anthony, the director of the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities, presented changes that SRR is currently proposing to the Code of Academic Integrity that the senate will vote on in March. Anthony said the proposed changes would define academic exercises, like exams and papers, and remove the words “intentionally” and “knowingly” from the code so the students would not need to prove intention to falsify information.
“We’ve taken out intentionally or knowingly because the verb here is falsifying, which presumably implies that this is done with intent and knowledge,” Anthony said. “And we have taken out without authorization. We struggled to imagine a situation in which falsifying information deliberately would be permitted.”
Senators unanimously passed a bill to contribute $8,420 to the Club Sports Council to rent fields for 12 club sports teams at a sports complex in Springfield, Va. Senior Hailey Stephany, the president of GW Women’s Club Lacrosse, said the council needs to rent out third-party fields because the Mount Vernon Campus fields do not have field lights for late-night practices.
“GW is one of the few Division I schools that has no lit fields on any campus,” Stephany said.
The senate unanimously passed The Attendance Disciplinary Reform Act, sponsored by SA Sen. Cordelia Scales, SEAS-U and senate chairperson pro-tempore, to update senators’ attendance requirements to include a section on “nonfeasance”. The bill states that any senator who doesn’t attend three consecutive meetings or six non-consecutive full senate meetings during their term should be considered “nonfeasant” and eligible for suspension by the governance and nominations committee.
Once they receive a notice of nonfeasance, the governance and nomination will set a hearing within 14 days of the notice for the absent senator. The committee will then evaluate whether to recommend reinstating them to the senate.
The legislation also states that senators who do not attend four consecutive or eight non-consecutive senate committee meetings during their term will also be considered eligible for suspension. The bill stipulates that a motion to suspend a senator requires a two-thirds vote from the senate to pass.
The bylaws previously did not include provisions for nonfeasance attendance, and said senators had to hold a hearing within five days of the delivered notice instead of the updated 14 days.
The next senate meeting will take place on Feb. 28 at 8:30 p.m. in the University Student Center.
