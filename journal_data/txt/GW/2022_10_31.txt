I never thought I would be turned away from one of GW’s newly opened dining halls empty handed, but that’s exactly what happened when I tried eating at Thurston Hall earlier this month. GW’s newest dining venue is crowded, mismanaged and fails to give students the food options they need and deserve.
GW’s new all-you-care-to-eat dining halls and meal swipe system will replace its current dining dollar plan, which gives students a limited amount of money compared to the expensive price of eating in D.C. The swipe system will commence in the spring, but the first dining hall to open in Foggy Bottom lacks the capacity to seat more than 225 students, the rest of whom are often refused entry until the space clears. If the University cannot address and resolve this issue, students will be cut off from their basic right to accessible food options when they want to eat on campus. Before implementing the meal swipe plan, officials must open the dining hall in Shenkman Hall on time in January to give students the space they need to eat.
Delays and shortcomings have plagued the rollout of GW’s new all-you-care-to-eat dining system since 2021. Officials announced last year that four reimagined dining halls would be open for the current fall semester. By the start of the 2022-23 school year, only one – The Eatery at Pelham Commons – was open on the Mount Vernon Campus, where only a small fraction of undergraduate students live. While The Eatery may serve students on the Vern, it’s unreasonable to expect students living in Foggy Bottom to take a round trip on the Mount Vernon Express just for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The Foggy Bottom dining halls – Thurston, Shenkman and District House – should have all been ready for the start of the 2022-23 school year, but officials pushed back the opening dates of the Thurston and Shenkman dining halls and scrapped their original plans for District House. The Thurston dining hall was set for September but opened earlier this month, and Shenkman is set to open in January. The District House dining hall opened in September, but as a restaurant-based system rather than an all-you-can-eat dining hall. Students found out about the changes from unexpected emails in the middle of the summer notifying them about these delays.
Though Thurston offers relatively affordable meals after opening, the biggest issue has been crowds and logistics. The capacity for the Thurston dining hall is 225, compared to 675 at American University and 2,300 at Howard University’s two dining halls. American and Howard also happen to have lower undergraduate populations than GW – around 8,000 and 9,000 respectively, compared to around 12,000 at GW – which means that our dining halls are tiny both in actual size and in proportion to our student body.
The logistical failures at Thurston speak to GW’s complete mismanagement of its dining halls. Students can choose to either sit down and eat or get a to-go box when they enter the dining hall. To make the most of the advertised all-you-can-eat experience, students are taking up the already-limited number of seats to enjoy longer and theoretically unlimited sit-down meals. Officials expect to serve 750 to 800 students during the daily four-and-a-half hour dinner period as if students will take at least an hour to eat – a far cry from the constant flow of customers at quick, accessible venues like Western Market. That leisurely pace may work in the restaurant industry, but that is not the case at GW. Because of the capacity crunch, the dining hall has less of a relaxed “all-you-care-to-eat” feeling than a “hurry-up-and-eat” and “take-what-you-can-get” atmosphere.

The crowd issues at Thurston already mean that students are not able to eat when they want to, so the longer the Shenkman dining hall remains closed, the more strained Thurston becomes. The switch to a swipe-based system, which will occur in January, will only make things worse if students cannot eat at the overcrowded dining halls. Freshmen on the meal swipe plan would have less money to spend on other vendors for the semester depending on their meal plan, which cuts dining dollar balances to $500, $250 or $100. If or when students run out of dining dollars, they and their parents will be sure to complain about GW’s negligence and lack of food options, creating a logistical and public relations nightmare for GW.
As one of the most well-respected universities in the country, GW must make sure that students have full access to the dining halls when our meal swipe system comes into place. Pushing back the opening of Shenkman yet again while reducing the dining dollar balance by switching to a meal swipe system would risk students’ nutritional well-being.
Instead, officials should prevent any further delays to the dining hall rollout, or they can admit they were not ready for the meal swipe system in the first place. GW could still extend our current dining-dollar-only plan to the spring semester to ensure that students will be able to find food outside of the dining halls when they are at capacity, while also making sure Shenkman is fully ready to relieve crowds from Thurston Hall.
The administration cannot allow students to potentially go hungry some nights, and it’s not fair that many students rely on one dining hall in Foggy Bottom that seems to always be at or near capacity. Officials need to make smart choices when it comes to the immediate future of dining at GW. Failure is not an option for the administration when it comes to the food security of students.

After years of negotiation and months of construction to build a new health care facility in Southeast D.C., a GW-staffed urgent care unit opened to the public earlier this month. Though it’s only one part of the still-developing Cedar Hill Regional Medical Center, whose name is a reference to abolitionist Frederick Douglass’s nearby estate, the completed urgent care clinic shows that the University can escape the Foggy Bottom bubble for the betterment of the city.
GW’s investment in new health care facilities east of the Anacostia River should improve the lives of residents who face disproportionately higher rates of health issues yet less access to medical resources than other city residents. But the University must leverage its position as a stakeholder in the medical development at St. Elizabeth’s East – a 183-acre space of developmental land in Southeast – to ensure Cedar Hill Urgent Care GW Health and the medical center as a whole offer accessible and affordable health care to the communities it’s meant to serve.
A combination of factors like financial hardship, limited access to healthy food and air pollution means residents of Wards 7 and 8 suffer disproportionately high rates of illnesses from cancer to COVID-19. Yet all but one of the city’s seven current hospitals – the United Medical Center – is in Northwest. With more health issues but fewer health care centers, Southeast residents die on average almost a decade earlier than residents of whiter and wealthier neighborhoods. Life expectancy in Wards 2 and 3 exceeds 85 and 87 years respectively, compared to an average of 76.7 in Ward 7 and 72 years in Ward 8.
That stark contrast, which represents a legacy of systemic and racist disregard for D.C.’s Black residents, led Mayor Muriel Bowser to partner with the GW Hospital to expand health care access in Southeast D.C. by building a new hospital. But the initial plans between the city and the GW Hospital fell apart – the hospital would only agree to construct a new facility in Southeast if it could increase the number of beds in its current Foggy Bottom location, which University officials, local residents and staff at the Howard University Hospital all opposed. Bowser, the D.C. Council and the hospital finally reached a deal in 2020 and broke ground on the complex in February this year.
With the center’s urgent care clinic now open, GW has initiated its expansion beyond Ward 2. Universal Health Services will manage the facility and the School of Medicine and Health Sciences and the Medical Faculty Associates will provide academics and physicians. The clinic, which is the first urgent care center to open in Ward 8, will treat nonlife-threatening conditions like allergic reactions and asthma, colds and flu, minor sprains, broken bones and sore throats and offer x-rays, lab testing and blood work.
But when it finishes construction in 2024, the completed Cedar Hill Medical Center complex will represent an even more dramatic improvement in the services available to the community it serves. While D.C. has stopped the United Medical Center from delivering babies since 2017 due to issues in its screening, clinical assessment and delivery protocols, Cedar Hill will have a newborn delivery and an intensive care nursery. The hospital will also be a Level 3 trauma center – though smaller than the GW Hospital’s Level 1 trauma center, it’ll be the only one east of the Anacostia River and can still treat injuries from gunshot wounds or car accidents.
In the operation of the urgent care clinic and the Cedar Hill Regional Medical Center at St. Elizabeth’s East, GW and its partners must, as the saying goes, “first do no harm.” While new facilities in Wards 7 and 8 are evidently more accessible to residents east of the Anacostia River, they ought to be affordable, too. If the hospital can’t serve the people in the local community without burying them in medical debt, then who really benefits from it?
It’s not enough to simply treat pink eye or write a prescription – the employment opportunities these facilities will create ought to go to people from Wards 7 and 8. The UHS, SMHS and MFA staff at both the urgent care clinic and hospital will work in the midst of the 8,233 families in Wards 7 and 8 who live below the poverty line, more than the rest of the city’s wards combined. Good paying medical and nonmedical positions and benefits won’t just “do no harm” – they can actively create wealth for residents of some of the poorest parts of D.C.
D.C. is more than a backdrop to our college education, and we hope that the opening of Cedar Hill Urgent Care GW Health and the continuing development of the Cedar Hill complex will begin to chip away at decades of systemic neglect of communities east of the Anacostia River. But it’s all in the execution – only a medical facility that puts the health and well-being of our neighbors first with affordable and accessible health care can proudly carry GW’s name.
We offer our praise with caution – the completed medical center won’t open for another two years at the earliest, after all. But a multi-million dollar investment in expanding health care access across D.C. is truly a tangible example of the value the University can place on serving others. Many of us attend GW to learn how to become global leaders, but the University is showing us that you don’t have to look very far from home to make a difference.

As states roll back reproductive rights across the nation, violent attacks target our political leaders and democracy itself seems under threat, the outcome of this year’s midterm election will determine the future of this country. A Republican majority in Congress could enact a nationwide abortion ban, oppose gun control legislation, reduce Medicare or raise the cost of prescription drugs. Though young, left-leaning voters are growing increasingly disillusioned with the Democratic party, the stakes of this election carry a harsh truth for them – if progressive voters fail to fill government seats with Democrats, Republican politicians will seize their power to threaten human rights. Whether you like it or not, it’s time to rally behind Democratic candidates for office.
Dwindling support from America’s youngest voters, who are more progressive than older generations, has been a looming source of concern for Democratic politicians in this year’s midterm elections. Losing the vote of young Democrats is devastating to the party – when only about 20 percent of Americans younger than 30 voted in the midterm election under former President Barack Obama, Republicans were able to take control of the House of Representatives in 2010 and both chambers of Congress in 2014. Young voters make up a much smaller fraction of early voters in 2022 as compared to the 2020 election. And now, estimates of President Joe Biden’s approval rating among young voters have been steadily decreasing, currently estimated at about only 30 percent to 40 percent. In comparison, former President Donald Trump’s approval ratings among the same group averaged at roughly 50 percent.
Many voters feel as if they’ve given their vote to Democratic politicians who aren’t making substantive change – they may seek nothing short of an immediate and total social and economic revolution. Left-leaning voters feel Biden and Democrats are failing to assert their political power and have grown at odds with the political party that fails to meet their demands despite controlling the White House and Congress.
The sentiment extends to GW’s campus – GW Environmental Justice Action Network criticized Biden’s minimal effort to eliminate emissions from cars and trucks, and The GW Political Review has argued that Biden failed to use his executive power to protect abortion rights in the wake of the overturn of Roe v. Wade. Instead of codifying abortion access after the Supreme Court’s decision leaked this May, Democrats solicited donations for their campaigns. Nor have they or Biden passed revolutionary gun reform, declared a state of climate emergency or offered sweeping student debt forgiveness to help those with private loans. Even last February, GW’s chapter of the Young Democratic Socialists of America bluntly tweeted, “Can we shut up about Joe Biden’s f*cking dogs already literally who cares.”
To be clear, I am also disillusioned with Biden and the Democratic party. I haven’t forgotten about former U.S. Senate aide Tara Reade’s groping accusations against Biden in 2020. And I am both furious and horrified by Democrats’ failure to codify abortion rights and declare a climate emergency, support for increased police funding despite an uptick in racially motivated police violence and resistance to changing political systems, like the filibuster, that stall the progress of this country. So I, too, am ready for everyone to shut up about Joe Biden’s f*cking dogs already.
But whether we youth voters like it or not, if Democrats are not elected, then Republicans are most likely to fill government vacancies. The Democratic party does not have all the solutions, but it holds the foundations to make more progressive change than Republicans. Biden has succeeded in passing some major liberal initiatives, like the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the first major gun safety legislation Congress had passed in 30 years, and the Inflation Reduction Act, which will cut greenhouse gas emissions by almost 40 percent by 2030. Many issues plaguing the country today are not at the fault of Democrats – inflation and high gas prices are largely the result of the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, both international problems not specific to a failure on the part of Biden or the party.
While the Biden administration hasn’t met every voter’s expectations, its successes demonstrate the necessary progress that Democratic leadership can create. But Democrats rely on young voters to get elected. The need for college students like ourselves to show up during elections and support Democrat nominees cannot be understated. Despite the understandable, collective disappointment in Democrats, Republican politicians threaten the future of issues from health care to climate change to civil rights in the United States.
With a little more than a week before Election Day, we should keep our focus on encouraging leftist voters to go to the polls and support Democrats in Congressional and local elections. Advocate along with the Student Association to turn Election Day into a GW holiday, volunteer as a poll worker or check out clubs or University events that encourage productive political conversations. Focus on the need to defeat Republicans who would threaten our rights instead of causing Democratic losses by disincentivizing liberal voters.

O’Leary said the current tipped minimum wage makes personal budgeting for basic weekly needs difficult for tipped workers because their pay is inconsistent depending on factors out of their control.
After getting laid off during the pandemic along with many other tipped employees in the service industry, Ryan O’Leary decided to launch an initiative to give tipped workers livable wages.
O’Leary, the chairman of tipped worker advocacy group Committee to Build a Better Restaurant Industry, started working as a tipped employee 11 years ago at Tysons Corner, Virginia before balancing a job at The Hamilton with political organizing just ahead of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. He said getting laid off due to harsh financial impacts felt by the restaurant industry at the time prompted him to reach out to One Fair Wage, a campaign devoted to ending subminimum wages, to start organizing advocacy efforts against the tipped wage system.
“We realized that, given the pandemic, given the fact that this had already been proposed and succeeded on the ballot before the will of the people was overturned by the Council, it seems like it was high time to reintroduce this and try to get tipped workers in D.C. full wage plus tips on top,” he said.
Initiative 82, which O’Leary filed with the D.C. Board of Elections in June, would raise tipped workers’ wages by about $2 per year until they equal D.C.’s standard $16.10 per hour minimum wage by 2027. In 2018, D.C. voters passed a similar initiative that the D.C. Council overturned, opting for what they said to be better policies to support tipped workers, like creating an anonymous tip line for workers to report stolen wages, which never received funding.
With the elimination of the tipped minimum wage – which totals $5.35 per hour – back on the D.C. general election ballot, restaurant management and labor advocates are split on the measure. Some welcome an increase to workers’ base earnings, while others fear locals may struggle to find tipped jobs and would earn less from customers who leave less gratuity with higher prices if the initiative is passed.
O’Leary said the current tipped minimum wage makes personal budgeting for basic weekly needs difficult for tipped workers because their pay is inconsistent depending on factors outside of their control, like scheduling between busier and quieter shifts that may dictate the number of daily tips.
He said during his time as a tipped employee, his tips often fell below the minimum wage level. He said managers seldom provided a tip credit to ensure their employees earned the equivalent of minimum wage pay for each shift, which is legally required in D.C.
“Rarely ever do you hear of a manager even implementing a tip credit,” O’Leary said. “It’s not something that any server has ever actually experienced, you know, getting a higher hourly rate for a pay period because they didn’t reach the average in tips.”
Seven states have implemented the standard minimum wage since 1975, including California, Washington, Oregon, Nevada, Minnesota, Alaska and Montana, all of which have experienced declines in racial and gender pay gaps as well as lower rates of poverty and on the job harassment.
O’Leary said raising the minimum wage for tipped workers also benefits businesses because it lowers employee turnover rates, saving businesses time and money they would spend training new employees, which he said can cost thousands of dollars.
“When you pay everybody a fair wage with tips on top, they generally stay where they’re working, which saves the business owner money, but also, it just makes the businesses themselves more resilient to economic changes,” O’Leary said.
Geoffrey Tracy – the founder of Chef Geoff’s restaurant group, a D.C. based chain of comfort food eateries – said tipped workers can earn beyond the minimum wage threshold, depending on the tips they receive in a given night. He said at his restaurant, employees tend to make $30 to $40 per hour.
Chef Geoff’s, which has locations in West End and Cathedral Heights, offers entrees ranging from $15 to $34.
Tracy said eliminating the tipped wage strips employees of the opportunity to earn higher pay through tips, while others prefer to receive a fixed wage. He said restaurants will need to add a service charge to customers’ bills to cover the cost of higher wages, which will reduce gratuities and limit servers to roughly the same total pile of earnings.
“For servers, what we’ll do is we’ll change the way they are paid, meaning that more of their money will come on their weekly or bi-weekly paycheck,” Tracy said. “And they will actually have less take home money than what they have right now.”
Alex Morash, the director of policy and communications at One Fair Wage who worked as a tipped employee at a friend’s restaurant in Rhode Island, said eliminating the tipped minimum wage is crucial because tipped workers whom One Fair Wage has surveyed struggle to pay rent with their current levels of income. He believes customers will continue tipping despite the elimination of the tipped minimum wage, which would prevent a potentially negative impact by the initiative, if passed.
“People don’t tip based on checking the employment law ahead of time regardless of where they are,” he said. “You still tip in Nevada, and that’s a full one fair wage state.”
Morash said in other states where the tipped minimum wage has been eliminated like California, restaurant owners have managed to continue operating while paying full wages. Restaurants in states which require employers to pay the full minimum wage experienced higher sales than those in subminimum wage states, according to a 2021 report from One Fair Wage.
“If a diner in Alaska can pay the full minimum wage, the different establishments on 14th Street can definitely afford to pay the full minimum wage too,” he said.
Morash said tipped employment is growing among more establishments across the country, not due to a desire to increase employee earnings, but because employers want to pay their staff less money. He said that mindset hurts efforts from labor activists to increase the minimum wage, like the nationwide Fight for 15 movement that seeks to increase the minimum wage to $15 per hour nationwide.
“We’re actually in a dangerous situation coming up now where if we don’t eliminate the subminimum wage soon, we might see all the gains of the Fight for 15 movement of the last 10 years completely eroded because almost everyone is going to have tip jars and tips added to their bills and ways to try and lower wages for working people,” he said.

Published in early October, GW’s presidential profile states the University’s goal to become the first AAU member in the District will “likely take years to achieve.”
Updated: Oct. 31, 2022 at 4:36 p.m. 
University leaders tabbed joining the Association of American Universities as a top priority in GW’s new presidential profile, but experts said GW needs to increase the amount of competitive federal research grants it receives and strengthen its academic programs to get there.
The AAU, an invite-only organization composed of 65 leading research universities in the United States and Canada, facilitates regular meetings with leaders from member institutions to share best practices for acquiring research funding, employing highly awarded and cited faculty and lobbying the federal government on education policy. Experts in higher education said membership is difficult to acquire and maintain because of the types of grants and programs an institution must have to be a member, but the prestige and connections with other elite universities are worth the effort, despite the nearly $140,000 annual membership fee.
Published in early October, GW’s presidential profile – which lays out the characteristics, experiences and priorities the search committee members want to see in presidential candidates – states the University’s goal to become the first AAU member in the District will “likely take years to achieve.” The profile states the first step to becoming a member would be to become one of the top 50 ranked schools in U.S. News and World Report’s annual college ranking list – where GW is currently at No. 62.
The presidential profile also states that GW’s next president should strengthen the School of Medicine and Health Sciences by increasing the amount of funding it receives from the National Institutes of Health and growing its research and clinical capacities, which could increase its chances at joining the AAU.
“In summary, GW’s next president will need to convey unparalleled ambition for the University, a commitment to and the ability to raise the resources to fund this new agenda, and work collaboratively to realize that ambition with all of GW’s key constituents as partners,” the profile states.
Interim University President Mark Wrighton, who will likely remain at GW for the remainder of the academic year, served as chairman of the AAU from 2004 to 2005.
Invitation to the AAU is also reliant on the money the University can bring in from outside grants and the number of faculty who are members of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, the number of faculty who receive prestigious academic awards and fellowships and the amount of research citations the University can produce, according to the AAU’s website. The AAU also considers other types of research funding and the quality and quantity of undergraduate, doctoral and postdoctoral programs, according to the AAU’s website.
A spokesperson for the AAU declined to comment on the AAU’s membership criteria or on the work it conducts with universities.
University spokesperson Josh Grossman said a university’s membership in the AAU is an “indicator of excellence” and would bolster GW’s mission as a comprehensive research university.
“While AAU membership will take time to achieve, the university aspires to work with all members of its community on the strategy, goals, and road map, with the hope of joining this distinguished group of leading comprehensive research universities,” he said.
Grossman declined to comment on how officials intend to gain membership or how close GW is to becoming a member.
Seven of GW’s 12 peer schools are currently members of the AAU, including the universities of Pittsburgh, Southern California and Rochester and Boston, New York, Tufts and Tulane universities. In its annual national college ranking list published in September, Forbes ranked GW one spot below NYU and 36 and 54 spots above the University of Rochester and Tulane University, respectively.
David Peterson, the Lucken professor of political science and member of the Iowa State University faculty senate executive board, said being a member of the AAU brings prestige to an institution by association because of the number of large research institutions that are already members.
“The AAU is the leading comprehensive research universities in America that sort of defined themselves, and if you look at the list, that’s really what it is,” Peterson said. “And so being in the club is a sort of signal and an indicator of research prestige.”
The AAU website does not lay out the specific numbers or benchmarks that prospective members should meet, but Peterson said the factors the AAU considers in determining membership does not fit for all types of research institutions. He said some institutions are increasingly starting to put more resources into financial aid and scholarships instead of other programs, which may help schools improve the quality of their student bodies, but not be as prestigious to the AAU.
“The AAU doesn’t consider things like four-year graduation rates,” he said. “It doesn’t consider things like the percentage of students with Pell grants. We’re a land grant school, we have a mission of science with practice, of being an engine to lift up the middle class and be an engine of social mobility. And the AAU doesn’t care. I mean, that’s not their criteria.”
Once accepted into the AAU, continued membership is not guaranteed, according to the AAU website. Member universities must maintain levels of research and education on par with peers within the organization and above schools outside of it.
Bernard Arulanandam – the vice provost of research at Tufts University, which has been a member of the AAU since last year – said invitation to the association brings higher status not just to the university, but also to students, who can use the sign of academic prestige to market themselves better to potential employers.
“The fact that we have this distinction further provides the marketability of our graduates,” Arulanadam said. “I mean, they’re coming from an AAU institution.”
Arulanandam said Tufts’ affiliation with the organization has led to a greater number of citations in academic journals and collaborative research published across different fields.
“They really advance the cause of all things higher education from a vibrant and robust undergraduate experience and the inquiry of graduate education and really creating thought leaders that will go out into this knowledge economy that we have here,” he said.
Fred Cate, the vice president for research at Indiana University, which has been a member of the AAU since 1909, said membership in the organization encourages universities to compete with other member institutions on the quality of their academic programs. He said universities in the AAU had to stay within the academic standards of its top 60 members if they hoped to avoid being dropped from membership.
“We may think we’re doing great if we’re increasing by one percent a year, but if the other members are increasing by five percent a year, it helps spur us to, you know, want to do better,” he said.
Cate said being a member of the AAU can also help institutions attract prestigious and well-known faculty.
“I think for faculty in particular, they’ve been regarded as an indicator of quality,” he said. “So when people are recruiting for jobs, it may be a little easier to recruit in some areas, at least, if you can say ‘Look, we’re in a member institution.’”

Owens began her conversation by discussing her family and her relationship with her family, to whom she dedicated the book.
Valerie Biden Owens discussed her memoir at the School of Media and Public Affairs last Friday.
Owens, the first woman in U.S. history to manage a presidential campaign and the sister of President Joe Biden, spoke about her new memoir, “Growing Up Biden,” which details growing up in the Biden household and how it shaped her career in an event hosted by the College of Professional Studies and the Graduate School of Political Management. CPS Dean Liesl Riddle moderated the event, part of a larger two-day seminar, “Strategy of Electoral Campaigns: Elections in the U.S. and Latin America,” hosted in both English and Spanish.
Owens began her conversation by discussing her family and her relationship with them, to whom she dedicated the book. She said the Bidens were a middle-class family while she grew up with three brothers.
“I grew up with three brothers in a middle-class, American Irish Catholic background, in mid-20th century America,” Owens said.
Owens said her book is about appreciating and embracing the ties which bind families together. She said the values of appreciation and understanding that come from family are needed in times of increased political polarization.
“The thing that I think we’re most missing today is empathy,” Owens said. “And it’s my ability to taste or feel when you only have so much more in common.”
Owens said there is a significant difference in politics today versus when she began working, as there is less trust in institutions than in the past. Owens then took questions from the audience with topics ranging from the character of her brother to navigating the worlds of both politics and writing.
When asked about the influence of modern media on politics, Owens said the effect of technological change, like the massive amount of new media platforms, in recent history is having a major impact on how politics functions.
“There’s so many different exit ramps, and what we tend to do was take the exit ramp that takes us to home base with people who think like us and act like us,” Owens said.

The Colonials are set to take on Loyola Chicago Saturday where they hope to survive the first round of the A-10 Championships.
Men’s soccer crushed George Mason in a 3–0 victory Saturday to close out its regular season and enter the Atlantic 10 Championship as the fifth seed in an eight-team bracket.
The Colonials (8-8-2) clinched a playoff berth with the win over the Patriots (2-11-2), building a substantial lead with unstoppable attacks in the box before establishing an impenetrable defensive wall that kept George Mason scoreless. The must-win game secured a playoff berth for the Colonials, who entered the game in seventh place in the conference and would have been eliminated from postseason play with a draw or loss.
GW opened the game with high tempo and aggressive play through the first 25 minutes. Senior attacker Roee Tenne fed the ball to senior midfielder Elias Norris who ran down the left and rocketed a shot into right corner of the net for his seventh goal for the season, putting GW on the board 1–0.
A lengthy back-and-forth battle ensued between the teams as the Patriots defense locked down with increased pressure, leading to seven fouls against GW throughout the game. But the Colonials wall proved stronger – GW senior goalkeeper Justin Grady blocked all of George Mason’s five attempts.
Both nets remained untouched during the last 20 minutes of the first half of the match, but the Patriots offense started to build momentum as halftime approached. Freshman attacker Zach Golden entered the match and helped generate momentum for his team as they transitioned into a 4-3-3 formation.
The score remained at 1–0 at the end of the first half with 12 total fouls between the two teams.
In the second half, GW maintained possession for the majority of the 45 minutes and capitalized with a pair of goals during the first 10 minutes. In the first minute of the half, senior attacker Tom Cooklin launched a corner kick following an offside penalty and junior defense Lucas Matuswezki headed in the goal.
GW intensity continued entering the 51st minute when Cooklin fired a cross to senior attacker Oscar Haynes Brown who rifled it off the left post and rebounded back to the George Mason goalkeeper.
The Patriots pushed upfield before a steal by Cooklin sabotaged their push toward the GW goal. Cooklin shoveled the ball to Haynes Brown who entered a long run and drilled the ball straight into the back of the net for the Colonials’ third score of the evening.
Haynes Brown is now fifth on GW’s all-time points list, passing 2009 men’s soccer alumnus Andy Stadler with the 84th goal of his career.
George Mason had four opportunities to score, the first of which came in the 60th minute when junior forward Ishmail Kamara missed wide. Nineteen minutes later, senior forward Kent Harrison ran down the box and kicked the ball toward top corner of the goal, but Grady caught it with both hands.
A minute later, George Mason graduate student forward Noah Raphael fired a shot from out left that went long. The Patriots had one final chance to score in the 88th minute when freshman defender Eric Allen ran down the zone and shot out left, but Grady made a diving save.
The Colonials fell back on defense for the rest of the game, tightening their coverage of the zone. George Mason failed to break through the GW wall, with Grady recording four saves on the day.
The Colonials are set to take on Loyola Chicago Saturday where they hope to survive the first round of the A-10 Championship. Kickoff is set for 4 p.m.

The MFA lost nearly $80 million by the end of the fiscal year in June, and the doubling of malpractice compensation costs accounted for an extra $7.8 million in expenses for the nonprofit that was not a factor in 2019.
The Medical Faculty Associates’ malpractice compensation costs – expenses for legal payouts and insurance premiums and reserves – have surged over the last three years despite a drop in legal claims and payouts, reflecting a national trend of growing malpractice insurance costs.
The MFA – a group of physicians and faculty from the School of Medicine and Health Sciences and physicians at the GW Hospital – spent $14.6 million on malpractice compensation in 2022, a 114 percent jump over the past three years, according to data that officials presented to faculty senators earlier this month. MFA malpractice compensation increased by more than $7 million from 2019, including a $600,000 increase from last year – a trend that officials partly attribute to rising insurance costs, despite dwindling malpractice lawsuit filings against the MFA in the same period.
Payouts and filed claims for malpractice lawsuits haven’t demonstrated growth similar to that of the MFA’s malpractice compensation, according to D.C. Superior Court records and data from the National Practitioner Data Bank. The number of malpractice lawsuits filed against the MFA and the amount of malpractice payment reports in medical facilities across D.C. and the country have decreased since 2019, the records and data show.
Plaintiffs filed 19 malpractice lawsuits against the MFA in 2020, a jump up from 12 cases in 2019, but the number of filings dropped to nine in 2021 and four so far this year, according to court records.
One of the 12 lawsuits filed against the MFA in 2019 and one of the 19 cases filed in 2020 reached settlements, but all closed cases filed since 2021 were dismissed, court records show. As of Monday, one of the 12 lawsuits filed in 2019 remains open, compared to nine open cases from 2020, three from 2021 and all four cases filed this year, according to the records.
Court records do not reveal how much the settlements were worth or share further details about the settlements.
The total number of malpractice payment reports filed by practitioners in D.C. fell from 23 in 2021 to nine so far this year – which includes reports from up to June 30, according to the NPDB, which collects data from health care providers and entities across the country. The data shows national numbers for the number of payouts dropped by about a quarter since 2019.
The MFA, a University-operated nonprofit, lost nearly $80 million by the end of the fiscal year in June, and the rise in malpractice compensation costs accounted for an extra $7.8 million in expenses for the nonprofit that was not a factor in 2019.
University spokesperson Josh Grossman said the MFA’s malpractice expenses include several years of “historical claims,” and include insurance premiums and “reserve true ups” – money set aside by insurance companies for lawsuits not yet filed or settled – from previous years. He said overall insurance costs jumped during the pandemic, but the MFA’s premiums and reserve costs have not increased substantially over the last year – in line with the MFA’s overall malpractice compensation costs over the last year.
“In general, the cost of insurance has increased over the past few years across most lines since the pandemic,” Grossman said in an email. “MFA experienced very little increase in premiums and reserve requirements over the last year.”
Grossman said the medical malpractice insurance market has “high confidence” in the MFA. He declined to specifically say why the MFA’s malpractice compensation has increased since 2019 or how it relates to the number of lawsuit payouts or claims.
GW entered an agreement with the MFA in 2007 to have the MFA’s medical professional liability insurance policy cover the University’s employed physicians, residents and interns. The policy was written by the MFA Physicians Insurance Company, a subsidiary of the MFA which was previously based in the Cayman Islands but transferred to D.C. during the last fiscal year.
The company offers coverage on a claims-made basis with limits of $3 million per occurrence and $12 million annually per individual employee.
The American Medical Association published a report in March stating the cost of medical liability insurance has increased nationally over the last three years by a proportion not seen for more than a decade, with nearly 30 percent of industry premiums increasing between 2020 and 2021.
The March report states the pandemic hasn’t driven up base premium costs, and the pandemic’s long-term effects on malpractice insurance costs are “still unknown.”
Medical liability insurance data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners states medical liability insurers in D.C. reported an average loss rate of 63 percent in 2021 because of claim payments that calendar year. Though the District’s loss rate fell under the national average of about 69 percent in 2021, the rate wasn’t that high in D.C. since 2007 with the exception of 2019 when it reached 88 percent.
Experts said rising premiums may be the biggest factor accounting for the MFA’s increasing malpractice compensation costs, because nationwide, regional and MFA-specific malpractice claims have decreased during the same period.
Dan Singer, a partner at Trombly & Singer law firm, said he is “skeptical” that the rise in MFA compensation costs can be attributed to a rise in actual claim payouts because of the national decrease in reports. He said rising premiums are a possible explanation for the increase because liability insurance companies have inflated malpractice coverage costs under the guise of a concrete increase in claim payouts in the past.
Singer said a 2020 study shows medical malpractice insurers overrepresented actual losses from 2002 to 2005 by 33 percent and used those inflated figures to charge doctors higher premiums for malpractice insurance. Singer said there isn’t evidence of rising payout costs today, and the insurance companies may be using inflated losses to charge insured doctors more.
“There is no real evidence of rising claim payouts,” Singer said in an email. “Consumer advocates who study this issue have concluded that this rhetoric is often used to price gouge insurance customers.”
Mark Hall, a professor of public health at Wake Forest University, said liability insurance costs can rise for broader financial market reasons “entirely unrelated” to actual suits or payouts because insurers rely significantly on financial investments with the funds they collect.
Hall said if the MFA started providing coverage for more healthcare providers in recent years or increased the number of physicians it employs, compensation coverage costs would rise regardless of premium rates or the amount of claims filed. The MFA currently employs roughly 700 SMHS physicians and other advanced practice providers, according to documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act in September.
“If that’s the cause, then there isn’t necessarily an increase in the aggregate, only a shift in who is paying the claims,” Hall said in an email.
Stephen Landsman, an emeritus law and social policy professor at DePaul University, said the sum paid out to policyholders for individual malpractice claims has “certainly” increased in recent years, but not necessarily the total claims reported. He said the increase in payout quantities is a symptom of current economic inflation affecting the medical industry because the price an insurance company may have to pay a policyholder to compensate for malpractice will increase as overall prices for medical care grow.
“With medical care, the rate of inflation usually exceeds what’s going on in the rest of the economy,” Landsman said. “You have a spiral upwards.”

Co-owner Kyle Burk said the Twitter account has reeled in customers who wouldn’t have visited the store otherwise, including those from outside the District.
At first glance, Capitol Hill Books looks like a small neighborhood bookstore nestled in a tiny white brick building on C Street Southeast, but behind its mellow exterior lies a widespread and adored social media presence.
When you first walk in the store, any book lover will immediately sense the classic aroma of dust motes and aging pages filling the air. But more than a purveyor of published material, Capitol Hill Books connects its customers to literature through humorous exchanges between staff members, photos of gorgeous first editions and bibliophilic thirst traps on their Twitter account, which currently retains more than 50,000 followers.

“I think the people who like it in general are the people who understand that we’re not taking it or ourselves too seriously,” current co-owner of Capitol Hill Books Kyle Burk said.
The account’s following list ranges from prominent journalists like Kaitlan Collins of CNN to politicians like House Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. An array of D.C. locals also enjoy the bookstore’s occasionally snarky tweets, ranging from jokes about the impressively enormous amount of titles they sell to a recent seeming annoyance with Elon Musk.
“Proposed 2022 policy platform: Seize the wealth of billionaire technofascist cosmonauts,” the Musk-inspired tweet reads.
Mixed in with the humorous posts are sarcastic responses from other Twitter users who join in on the back-and-forth engagement touching on topics ranging from popular media to the store’s policy on dogs.
“This gave me flashbacks to the time in the college bookstore I worked at when my boss’s Dachshund peed all over a stack of brand new law case books,” one Twitter user wrote.
“Was his dog named Alito, by chance?” Capitol Hill Books replied, taking a jab at Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, the author of the recent ruling that revoked abortion rights nationwide.
“I know a few of the tweets have gone viral,” Burk said. “It seems like it’s generally the more political tweets that go viral for whatever reason.”
A tweet from the account about the controversy surrounding Dr. Seuss books that were taken off shelves for containing racist content earned more than 70,000 likes in March 2021.
“No, we don’t have any of the recalled Dr. Seuss books and why are you suddenly trying to buy them now that you found out they have racist imagery, you weirdos,” Capitol Hill Books tweeted.
The store’s Twitter account launched in June 2013, but Burk said it didn’t become as active until he and his fellow employees started using it about “a year or two later” to entertain each other with jokes about books and literature. As they tweeted more, Burk said the account never received a steep influx in followers, but amassed a steady audience over the last decade.
“From my perception, it doesn’t feel like something that’s taken off,” Burk said. “We’ve been doing it for many years and slowly growing a following over those years.”
Burk said the Twitter account has reeled in customers who wouldn’t have necessarily visited the store otherwise, including those from outside the District.
“Some people say, ‘Oh, I’ve been following you on Twitter for years, and I finally made it to D.C.,’” Burk said.
Burk said the main mission of the store is to provide the “best books” it can to the community. The employees regularly post photos of new, used, signed and first edition books for sale on the account. He said the employees love books and want to share that love with everyone.

“That’s the number one job of any bookstore,” Burk said.
He said before COVID-19 vaccines became widely available during the pandemic, the bookstore closed for 14 months and only took online orders because of the interior’s “tight space.” Customers could fill out a form online to order books, and the staff would curate the grab bags for their readers.
“During that time, we mostly stayed alive because we sold books online through these grab bags that are sort of curated by our staff, in accordance with the pace of people,” Burk said. “There’s a form on our website, they can fill out and order grab bags of books.”
Capitol Hill Books has gone through a few owners since 1991 when Bill Kerr opened the business. Burk said he began his career at the bookstore as an employee in 2004 before he, two other employees and one long-time devoted fan of the store took over in 2018. Burk said because of the store’s longevity, shoppers continue to return to its many shelves of books, which run floor to ceiling of the two floors of the small, colorfully packed space.
“It’s definitely part of a neighborhood in a pretty deep way,” Burk said. “People have been coming to it for decades. Some people have known both previous owners, and that’s where they do all their book shopping.”

Stacy Staggs, a customer at the store from Jacksonville, Florida, said she stopped at the bookstore because of her “love of literature” and Capitol Hill Books’ similarity in size to a bookstore she likes back home.
“I’ve been here twice in the past years before,” Staggs said. “And I always really liked how small the space was. Reminds me of another bookstore that’s in Jacksonville, similar ‘crawl space’ vibes.”
Nikki Grigg, a customer from Chicago who previously lived in D.C., said she trekked out to the bookstore Friday to browse around and search for books on D.C. history. Grigg said she went to Capitol Hill Books when she lived in D.C., but the Twitter page and the variety of books has drawn her back to the bookstore.
“They just kind of have everything and you never know what you’ll find,” Grigg said. “It’s really just fun to spend some time in.”
