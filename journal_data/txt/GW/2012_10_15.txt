The University earmarked $20 million for a massive expansion of career resources over the next decade in the draft of its strategic plan.
The plan, released last week, would add a professional internship office, hand out scholarships to students with unpaid internships and create an employer-in-residence program.
The commitment to career services is part an effort to give students more work experience and help finding jobs after graduation. GW launched an overhaul of its career services last spring – plans that have been cemented by the $2 million in annual funding laid out in the plan.
Senior Associate Provost and Dean of Students Peter Konwerski said the plan will allow students to “put their class knowledge into action” in jobs, internships, study abroad, service and research off-campus. It would also expand networking events and programs that target student-athletes, international students, veterans and disabled students to personalize student support.
“The next few years will be an exciting time at GW as we work to build a career engagement and success model that complements the level of activity our students are already engaged with,” Konwerski said.
Other program ideas include preparation courses, career planning websites like Focus2, industry-based speakers and expanded technology for interview preparation.
Most components of the career expansion, like the unpaid internship grants, would be funded by donations. But the plan also leaves leeway for the program to collect funding from a $2 to $7 million pool that will fund service-learning courses and the addition of student research opportunities.
The Board of Trustees approved an expansion of career services last spring that brought dozens of new hires. The additional staffing and resources, including the creation of an assistant provost for career services position, were partially funded by a 3.7 percent tuition hike.
Last spring, GW began focusing career development toward six industry-specific fields, ranging from the arts and media to science, government, law, education and economics. The career center also reached out to parents and alumni to participate in career fairs and mentorship programs.

Tickets for GW’s Jan. 21 inaugural ball will go on sale on Election Day.
The University will put all 5,500 tickets for the ball up for sale Nov. 6, University spokeswoman Candace Smith said. The figure represents 1,500 more tickets than GW offered on the first day of ticket sales for the 2009 ball. Those tickets sold out within 24 hours.
Students, staff, faculty and alumni can purchase tickets online and at the Marvin Center when polls open at 7 a.m. Leftover tickets will be sold through the Lisner Auditorium box office.
Smith declined to comment on ticket prices, saying said “more information will be forthcoming.”
Tickets sold for $75 in 2004 and $85 in 2008, with steeper prices after election day.
More than 1,000 individuals filled a waitlist in 2008, prompting GW to release 1,200 tickets two weeks after selling an initial 4,000 tickets on Election Day. The 2008 ball – the fifth in University history – was also GW’s largest.
The ball will again be held at the swanky Omni Shoreham Hotel. Its seven ballrooms, all reserved by GW, can accommodate up to 5,500 people.
GW is selling 300 more tickets than it did in 2008, when it rented the same amount of space. Smith added that GW would also “reserve some tickets for staff working the event.”
Smith declined to comment on the ballroom rental costs, but said the University plans to make up for the costs through ticket sales.
Four years ago, the University dropped $575,000 to host the luxurious event, including rental costs, security and free transportation to the hotel.
GW’s ball was one of 60 held throughout D.C. as the city welcomed the 44th president. The event featured live bands, GW performers and an array of hors d’oeuvres and desserts.
Nearly 75 percent of tickets sold in 2008 went to students, but 20 ambassadors were also in attendance, alongside several local and national politicians.
Smith said the University has not been approached about participating in the Inaugural Parade, a 1.5-mile procession of floats, marching bands, citizens groups and military regiments.
The president’s inaugural committee, which does not start up until after the election, selects participants based on individual applications. During the 2008 parade, the University showcased a 46-foot-long, two-trailer float with a physical representation of each school. The inaugural committee approved the $85,000 float that about 50 students helped build.

Correction appended
The Columbian College of Arts and Sciences dean search got off the ground Wednesday when an elected faculty committee picked a professor to lead the six-month hunt.
A group of nine handpicked Columbian College faculty – led by philosophy professor Gail Weiss – will spend the year raking through candidates to head GW’s largest college, getting its start five months after Dean Peg Barratt announced she would step down next summer.
The next dean will step into a college that is more selective and research savvy than it was when Barratt arrived – but one with a scrutinized top position.
Committee spokesman James Clark said the committee has not yet outlined criteria for an ideal candidate, but it is looking for “strong interpersonal skills, a vision for the future and the ability to run a large and complex organization, among many other skills.”
The traits he pointed out matched some of the top concerns faculty expressed about Barratt in a school-wide survey last spring, which revealed widespread disenchantment with the five-year dean’s vision and leadership. A month later, Barratt announced she would step down and move into a teaching role.
But Forrest Maltzman, senior vice provost for academic affairs and planning, said the University officials will not pay much attention to faculty members’ perception of Barratt when they judge the next group of dean candidates.
“I don’t think the selection of the next dean has much to do at all with the current dean,” he said. “The selection of the next dean is where we’re trying to go forward.”
Provost Steven Lerman highlighted the need for the next dean to build momentum, because “Dean Barratt is passing on a college that is much stronger than she inherited.”
The list of qualifications that the 2007 Columbian College dean search committee laid out also includes traits like interpersonal skills and ability to communicate a vision. Clark said he hopes the committee will begin candidate interviews by early 2013, with Lerman and Knapp making the final call on the hire by the spring.
Barratt said that cultivating personal relationships is on the radar for her successor.
“Being a dean is a people job – the job calls for constantly working with faculty, students, alumni and staff,” she said, calling the essence of Columbian College “the intersection between students and faculty.”
Besides earning professors’ trust, the next dean will have a long to-do list, executing the strategic plan, overseeing GW’s first global undergraduate degree and facilitating the science departments’ move into the Science and Engineering Hall in 2015.
“This is one of the most important positions at GWU, and the new Dean will come to the university at a time when it is becoming even stronger than before,” Clark, the chair, said in an email.
The committee is also combing through consulting firms to help organize the search process. Vice Provost for Diversity and Inclusion Terri Reed will help guide the search to ensure a diverse field of prospects. Barratt is one of only three female deans at GW.
The committee includes three representatives from each division in the college – natural science, social sciences and humanities – elected earlier this month by the school’s faculty. The other eight search committee members did not return requests for comment.
One undergraduate and one graduate student will be added to the committee by next week, but neither will have voting powers.
Former University President Stephen Joel Trachtenberg, now a higher education consultant at Kory/Ferry International, said last month that the University will likely turn to an outsider from a high-ranking liberal arts school.
He pointed to his successor’s hires of administrators from higher ranked schools – like Lerman from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and GW School of Business Dean Doug Guthrie from New York University – as hints to where GW to could turn next.
During Knapp’s administration, two-thirds of the hires for top administrative or academic positions have been external hires.

The University plans to modify Freshman Day of Service in response to a proposal from a senior who has volunteered since the day was created, calling for more productive work hours and campus projects.
Rachel Krausman outlined about a dozen improvements to help students get more out of the annual event in a 10-page proposal to administrators last month, including two extra hours of service and closer projects to cut travel costs – ideas GW’s community service office will spend the next year reviewing through focus groups.
“We can do so much in such a short amount of time,” Krausman said. “Even with a long list of recommendations and ideas, the adjustments and innovations we make are just tweaks to the core model, which I think will remain intact.”
Thousands of students sign up for Freshman Day of Service yearly, Krausman said, posing logistical challenges like busing students to dozens of different sites. The event racks up a high bill for buses and costs about $60,000 overall, Robert Chernak, formerly senior vice provost for Student and Academic Support Services, said last fall.
Amy Cohen, executive director for the Center for Civic Engagement and Public Service, said Krausman’s proposal coincides with talks within the department to “enhance the connections between days of service and the long-term service.” She said the office is also looking to increase the number of service days and projects throughout the year, add more faculty and staff volunteers and better structure training for student project leaders.
“We’re figuring out what we’re going to do next,” Cohen said. She added that the office would look to answer, “‘How do we make sure that this is the most valuable experience?’”
Service has topped University President Steven Knapp’s list of priorities since he was hired in 2007. Administrators hail Freshman Day of Service as the largest service day of any university nationwide, and the event drew national attention in 2009 when first lady Michelle Obama promised to speak at commencement if GW students served 100,000 hours.
This year’s event was the largest in its history, prompting GW to nearly double the number of service sites to 35 to accommodate 2,800 participants.
Freshman Joanne Zalatoris, who spent the day painting fences at a park near campus, said she thought the service day was a “good concept,” but added that she did not feel inspired to spend more time serving.
“We didn’t seem to be giving back to the community in a meaningful way,” Zalatoris said.
To increase the impact of students’ service, Krausman stressed more service projects that “require manpower,” like assembly lines of students putting together kits like care packages for troops overseas.
That idea would also help GW connect with organizations outside of the District, which Krausman called important because GW already sends students to dozens of sites across D.C.
She said developing projects for up to 200 students at a time is “one of the biggest challenges.”
Krausman also wants to track the event’s impact through surveys, looking at how many freshman participants also volunteer for Alternative Breaks, D.C. Reads, Jumpstart or Community Building Community after participating in the service day.
Senior Associate Provost and Dean of Students Peter Konwerski said service days like the Freshman Day of Service and Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Service are “good short-term introductions” to community engagement.
“While short-term service days don’t always have a dramatic and immediate impact to change a community or project, what they do is effectively provide students with a strong foundation for future service and further entice students to want to do more with that issue or community after the service,” said Konwerski, who was the founding director of the Office of Community Service.
Amanda Robbins, a freshman who helped paint a hallway in a Virginia middle school, said the work helped her feel connected to the community and to her hallmates who served with her. She said she was inspired by the school’s principal who talked about how excited the students would be when they walked in Monday morning.
She said the event inspired her to do more in the District because it helped her realize “there’s so much we can do in the immediate D.C. area to help people.”

Everyone has an opinion. I share mine on a regular basis through my columns on this page.
And last week, a group of students, supported by Newman Catholic Student Center chaplain Father Greg Shaffer, shared their thoughts with the community in what they called a peaceful demonstration opposing abortion.
Students should be able to stand up for a cause that they believe in. A university should be a safe haven for free expression, even on controversial subjects that we don’t all agree on, like abortion.
But on a campus as eclectic as this one, it’s also important that students feel as though their views on faith are both respected and represented. Groups like the Newman Center, which are generously funded by the University and the Student Association, have a religious purpose on campus – not a social or political one. The chaplain is there to hold religious services, offer communion for interested students and foster a sense of community among Catholics at GW. Contentious national political issues should be outside of the Catholic Student Center’s purview.
Apparently they don’t think so.
To get more students involved in spiritual life on campus, numerous religious groups, including the GW Catholics, are joining together to participate in interfaith-related activities, which they hope will broaden their support base. The Interfaith Council is hosting religious activities, but it’s also thinking out of the box by incorporating community service into its programming.
Through their demonstration, the Catholics are negating their own efforts to attract members. They inadvertently ostracize students who may be interested in the services that the Newman Center offers, but feel uncomfortable participating because their political stances do not align.
It’s no secret that the Catholic Church formally and outwardly opposes marriage equality and a woman’s right to choose. But the purpose of an on-campus religious organization should be to help students living away from home safely practice their faith, not to participate in divisive political debate.
Politics has a place on our campus. The College Republicans and College Democrats can and should hold debates about abortion rights and advocate for their positions all they want.
But GW Catholics, it’s not your job to enter the political fray, especially on a college campus that strives to be inclusive and open-minded.
This isn’t the first time that the Newman Center has found itself in the midst of controversy as a result of Father Shaffer’s vocal involvement in social issues. Last May, he wrote a blog post aggressively stating his opposition to the legalization of marriage equality.
With offensive comments like this, it’s no wonder LGBT students felt the need to form their own more inclusive Catholic organization on campus, Dignity GW, last October. It’s great that members of the LGBT community who also happen to be Catholic have a place to come together and practice their faith, but it’s a shame that so many people feel unwelcome from the central Catholic group on campus.
There’s nothing wrong with standing up for what you believe in, even if it incites controversy. In fact, I’m sure the views I have expressed in this column will come off as contentious to some readers.
But if the Newman Center does not want to alienate students, it’s going to have to tone down its message.

“What is the critical mass of African-Americans and Hispanics at the university that you are working toward?”
This was the question Chief Justice John Roberts raised on the first day of oral arguments last week in the affirmative action case Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin. The justices of the Supreme Court focused their questioning around “critical mass,” or the point at which affirmative action will no longer be necessary.
Colleges don’t use quota systems during admissions – and they shouldn’t – but that means the Supreme Court justices couldn’t be given a clear point at which race-based admissions will become obsolete.
UT’s lawyer, Gregory Garre, responded that while the school has no specific point of “critical mass,” the university’s 3 percent African American population was certainly insufficient.
“But would 3 percent be enough in New Mexico, your bordering state, where the African American population is around 2 percent?” Justice Samuel Alito asked.
“What you’re saying,” Justice Anthony Kennedy said, “is that what counts is race above all.”
This exact line of questioning shows the many reasons race-based affirmative action is still needed today. Ideally, affirmative action will become unnecessary. The Supreme Court predicted in Grutter v. Bollinger that racial preferences in admissions would no longer be necessary by 2028 – 25 years after the landmark affirmative action case was decided. But that Fisher v. UT has come to the Supreme Court only nine years after Grutter v. Bollinger is an affront to a decision that needs more time to play out.
There’s no “critical mass” for the appropriate makeup of a student body that challenges its peers and represents a range of perspectives and backgrounds. At a time when student bodies so often lack racial diversity – only 14 percent of GW’s population is black or Hispanic – we are nowhere near reaching this upper limit.
We don’t know what a “critical mass” for racial diversity is because we remain so far from it. The hearing at the Supreme Court Wednesday sought answers to questions that can’t be answered until there is greater equality across higher education.
The University agrees, and it has a number of laudable diversity recruitment initiatives on campus which could be jeopardized if affirmative action policies are struck down.
In an amicus brief to the Supreme Court in response to Fisher v. UT, GW joined nine other schools nationwide in advocating for a continued push for diversity.
“Purely numeric approaches are infeasible,” it reads. “Without the ability to consider race among other factors in selecting a diverse student body, diversity will be [sic] inevitably suffer, as will the educational experience of all students at the university.”
It is a university’s job to foster the best possible learning environment for its students. That means offering the best facilities it can for learning, encouraging critical thinking, hiring the strongest faculty and admitting the most vibrant student body. But by trying to pinpoint diversity numerically, we limit the amount of minorities colleges and universities welcome to campus.
In the amicus brief, the University specifically pointed to the importance of diversity in a field where there’s never enough: science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Underrepresented minorities make up only 11 percent of STEM jobs, while they comprise 33 percent of the school-age population. But STEM occupations seek diversity, as that is what drives innovation. Extending opportunities to get involved in STEM education and jobs is not just crucial for increasing diversity within the field, it’s crucial for the progress of the country as our economy attempts to become the leader in math and science once again.
But the justices’ questions Wednesday displayed just how contentious this issue can be. Many Americans wouldn’t agree with the University’s commitment to diversity, and that’s disheartening.
But there’s one thing the proponents of striking down affirmative action don’t seem to understand. Universities aren’t using affirmative action to fill their tour books with photos of black and Hispanic students. Nor are universities using affirmative action because it makes them look progressive.
They use affirmative action because it benefits the entire student body, and it benefits the fields underrepresented minorities ultimately pursue.
The fact that the Supreme Court is seeking answers on the point of “enough” when it comes to minorities suggests that it is concerned with limiting diversity or keeping it at bay, rather than seeing underrepresented minorities as equals. Critical mass isn’t the racial composition at which we will no longer need to appease a group. And it’s discriminatory to believe there might be a critical mass at all.
We remain far from finding out the full potential of underrepresented minorities, yet the high court is asking a school with a 3 percent black population when it will know it has had too much.

The next decade of GW’s future is critical. The state of higher education faces unprecedented change.
The University has big plans for the next 10 years, outlined by administrators in the strategic plan released Tuesday. Spearheaded by Provost Steven Lerman, along with administrators, students and faculty, the document will face the Board of Trustees in February. The plan is clear and forward-looking, and will hopefully propel GW onto stronger academic ground. But in its current state, it also has a number of weaknesses.
Before the Board gives its approval to the strategic plan, there are a few parts that should be amended and elements that should be clarified.
An overarching curriculum
One of the key parts of the plan is a proposal to develop a core curriculum that provides all students with a central set of skills and knowledge before receiving a degree. As it stands, University Writing is the only course required across schools before graduation.
But this change comes after the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences and the Elliott School of International Affairs have recently restructured their curriculums, and the GW School of Business is in the process of doing so, raising the question of why such an overhaul is even necessary.
The plan also calls for enrolling students into the University as a whole, rather than to specific colleges. Admitting students to the University could undermine individual schools’ prestige, as some of the more elite programs generate a higher level of appeal.
Administrators have said that having a unified undergraduate college would make it easier for students to switch between different courses of study. But as it is, switching into another college is not difficult. Instead of taking dramatic steps to reorganize the structure of the University, administrators should instead ensure current and prospective students better understand the process to switch majors and schools.
Drastic structural changes are not necessary, but improved communication is.
What the plan lacks
The University is undergoing a transition. It is struggling to define itself as either a liberal arts institution or a school that focuses on teaching specialized skills to prepare students for the job market.
In this plan, the University attempts to do both.
The strategic plan was organized around four broad principles: globalization, governance and policy, innovation through cross-disciplinary collaboration and citizenship and leadership.
It’s no secret that GW is hoping to increase interdisciplinary collaboration over the course of the next decade among departments, students and faculty, and with good reason. Interdisciplinary education offers students a chance to immerse themselves in a wide array of intellectual fields. The plan to build small research centers would create more opportunities for students, including those who are looking to explore interests outside their major.
But if creative thought and innovation are top priorities, those goals should have been clearly spelled out as one of the guiding tenets of the plan, not just mentioned in a few vague bullet points.
The job market for today’s college graduate is challenging to say the least. Students are expected not only to have good grades, but to have a number of marketable experiences to be considered by many employers. And having skills outside their specific major will give students a leg up.
That’s why the plan could have also mandated that students take on  minors to complement their majors. Although some students, like engineers, might find it difficult to fit in an extra concentration, many others could benefit from an added skill, like those in the School of Media and Public Affairs.
The plan makes clear the University’s increasing emphasis on science, technology, engineering and math courses, but any notable devotion to the social sciences and humanities is absent.
In the past few years, these courses have been called into question time and time again. But these courses are integral to any undergraduate education. The humanities teach students critical thinking and how to write well – both essential skills. Students may not remember obscure chemical formulas  forever, but writing is a lifelong skill.
An evolving gameplan
Some ideas in the plan – like the goal to renovate performance space on campus, which shows recognition of the value of the arts – are commendable.
In light of the reality that many students have to forgo unpaid internships for paying jobs, the University has demonstrated a commitment to establish a scholarship fund, giving students the financial means to work as interns even if they are not paid.
And in keeping with the trend of hiring part-time professors who also excel in the workforce, the University has expressed interest in increasing the number of professionals who share their expertise in the classroom. Termed “reverse sabbatical,” this new approach would continue giving students who attend the University insight into potential career paths.
The plan both looks into the past and anticipates the future, providing the community at large with the University’s vision of itself in the years to come. As such, this plan should not be a steadfast rule, but rather a flexible document that can adapt with the changing educational climate.
As a community which has continually evolved over the past 200 years, we recognize the importance this plan will have on the future prestige of the University and the value of a GW degree.
And this document must fully reflect it.

1523 22nd St., NW
In 2010, world famous tavern The Brickseller closed – reopening days later as The Bier Baron. While The Brickseller held the Guinness Book of World Records’ title for the largest number of bottled beers – 1,032 – The Bier Baron boasts more than 500 beers, with brews heralding from D.C. to Latvia and countries in between. The Dupont Circle bar has an overwhelming menu with rare ales and porters, and this exclusivity is a large part of its charm. With brick walls and bar stools crafted from barrels, the atmosphere is cozy and relaxing. Prices are reasonable, with a wide selection of drafts and bottles at $5-$7. Daily happy hours boast any draft beer plus a burger for $10. The menu is well-balanced between American craft beers and international specialties – including many Belgian, German and British brews. If you’re a fan of IPAs or wheat ales, the selection here highlights some of the best American breweries, including Goose Island Brewery of Chicago and Allagash Brewing Company of Portland, Maine. You can also try three selections from DC Brau, the District’s first brewery, which opened in 2011. As for the crowd, the bar typically sees a mix of younger and older patrons.
1337 14th St., NW
If you’re looking for an upscale bar that offers beer of the finest quality, ChurchKey is your place. This Logan Circle establishment has more than 500 options with an emphasis on exclusive international beers, particularly Belgian brews. At $8-$10 a pint, they’re not cheap. But you can’t put a price on the chance to try some of the world’s best beers, such as Brasserie de la Senne of Belgium or Kissmeyer of Denmark. ChurchKey’s atmosphere reflects the quality of its beer, as the bar caters mostly to professionals and the Capitol Hill crowd. Modern, industrial décor completes the bar’s formal feel. Its popular happy hour runs until 7 p.m. and seating fills quickly. If you can’t make it to happy hour, check out one of the bar’s unveiling events – when it introduces a new draft beer and offers specials.
3400 11th St., NW
Meridian Pint draws both a typical college crowd and older beer lovers alike. A short walk from the Columbia Heights Metro stop, the bar offers 24 draft beers and an extensive selection of bottles. Unlike other bars, all of the draft beers are American, and patrons can sample selections from several local breweries. Options include Firestone Walker Brewing Co., an up-and-coming West Coast brewery, 3 Stars Brewing Company, located in the District and Mad Fox Brewing Company of Falls Church, Va. Prices range from $5-$10 for both pints and bottles. While the upstairs has a nicer dining room, the real fun is in the basement, where pool tables and a bar that stretches across the room create a lively, social atmosphere. Each Tuesday night at 11 p.m. Meridian Pint cleans its draft lines and offers $3 pints. It’s a bit of a hole in the wall, but the wide selection of American beer, low prices and the young crowd make the trip to Columbia Heights worthwhile.
1100 New York Ave., NW
“It’s all about the beer!” is Capitol City Brewing Company’s creed. This Metro Center bar offers about 10 signature brews, including rotating seasonal varieties. Out of all the District’s breweries, Capitol City has one of the most diverse lineups of original beer, including amber ales, pale ales, porters and stouts. Favorites include the Capitol Kolsch – a German-style golden ale – and Amber Waves – an American red ale. Pricing is reasonable, with pints going for $5-$7 regularly and $2-$3 during happy hour – from 4 to 7 p.m. Since the bar brews its own beer on site, the food is tailored to complement the beers’ signature flavors. Plenty of ale is used during food preparation as well, for options including beer-battered onion rings and porter-infused chili. The atmosphere at Capitol City is casual, welcoming a mix of professionals, tourists and a younger crowd. It’s a versatile bar for drinks, dinner or just watching the game.
3282 M St., NW
When it comes to pizza and beer, Adams Morgan bars and Jumbo Slice most immediately come to mind. But Birreria Paradiso, located in the basement of Georgetown’s Pizzeria Paradiso, offers a classier take on the combination and is a must-visit. It offers a rotating selection of high-quality draft beers and more than 200 bottled choices. Prices here can be steep, with most drafts going for $6-$10, so try to catch happy hour on Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 5 to 7 p.m. All drafts are half-off, so try unique beers like Weyerbacher Autumnfest and Southern Tier Harvest Ale at an unbeatable price. The selection of drafts is perfect for fall, with nine out of the 16 beers on tap being autumn or pumpkin specialties. There’s plenty of Neapolitan pizza to complement your drinks. But because Birreria Paradiso is tucked in the basement of a restaurant, it is not as socially dynamic as other bars along M Street.

A week after seeing the University’s strategic plan for the first time, faculty are pointing out that changing GW’s admissions structure and encouraging cross-school collaboration will prove difficult.
Even when professors praised the plan widely considered ambitious and far-reaching, their acclaim was often cautious. Several said that the University would need  to better define how to turn ideas into action in the next four months before the final plan goes before the Board of Trustees.
The plan lays out about $300 million worth of investments in academics, research and student life over the next 10 years. Ideas include more cross-disciplinary research centers, strengthening of career services, up to 100 new faculty positions and a doubling of the international undergraduate population.
Neal Chalofsky, associate professor of human and organizational learning, said it will be tough to encourage GW-wide collaboration at a university that has stressed school-by-school fundraising, planning and budgeting, adding that administrators would have to continue to “put their money where their mouth is.”
“A plan is only as good as its execution,” he said, “And it will be interesting to see how the University will change the entrenched culture from one of rewarding individual faculty performance to rewarding collaboration across disciplines.”
He said the interdisciplinary approach would fundamentally change operations at a school where programs with similar disciplines don’t know about each other and even if they do, they rarely swap ideas.
Some professors said the plan could prompt staff across GW’s schools to start dual academic degrees or forge research connections.
Engineering professor Charles Garris said he is optimistic about the plan’s draft, and will help tweak the tactics GW will use to implement its big ideas.
“On the surface the plan sounds good, but how it shapes up might be difficult,” he said.
A new process that would allow students to apply to the University as a whole rather than applying to specific college has captured the most attention from faculty so far. Faculty have praised the idea for creating more academic flexibility for students, but some also cautioned that it could put schools’ identities at risk.
Philip Wirtz, a professor of decision sciences and psychology, stressed that administrators must put it into action carefully so it does not drown out the attractiveness of schools – like the prestigious Elliott School of International Affairs – for undergraduate applicants.
“We have a small number of schools within the University which have attained a high stature and visibility, and which provide particularly stellar positive contributions to the GW brand,” Wirtz said. “We have to be careful not to dilute the extraordinary value that these schools bring to the GW branding.”
David Dolling, dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Science, said he was unconcerned with how the admissions model would impact his school. While it would be nearly impossible for engineering students to double major because of the curriculum standards imposed by accreditation agencies, he said the school could open up elective courses to expose students outside the engineering school to the basics of 21st century technology.
Those courses could be part of a core curriculum across the University for freshmen and sophomores, which members of the Faculty Senate will put together this year. Faculty Senate committees, ranging from research to fiscal planning, also will examine portions of the strategic plan over the next four months.
Only two professors asked Lerman direct questions about the plan’s content during Friday’s meeting of the Faculty Senate.
The plan’s funding stream will flow partly from money generated by the Innovation Task Force, a group of faculty and staff that formed in 2010. The group aims to save money across the University by increasing efficiency and generating revenue to put back into academics and research.
The Division of Development and Alumni Relations will also try to raise $300 to $400 million as part of its comprehensive capital campaign, which will get off the ground in 2014.
