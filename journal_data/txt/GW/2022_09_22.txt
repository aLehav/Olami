CNN hosted an event with four journalists who discussed national and local policies that could affect the upcoming midterm elections at the School of Media and Public Affairs Wednesday.
Journalists Gloria Borger, David Chalian, Kasie Hunt and Jasmine Wright talked about political issues like the overturning of Roe v. Wade, immigration and inflation and how they might impact American voters’ choices in the 2022 midterm elections. About 200 community members attended the fourth installment of the civic engagement-focused CITIZEN by CNN series hosted in partnership with GW at the Jack Morton Auditorium.
Sam Fiest, CNN’s Washington bureau chief and senior vice president, introduced the other journalist speakers and endorsed the partnership between GW and CNN, including the recently established Ted Turner Endowed Fund, a fund seeking to raise $6 million to help create a new professorship in SMPA that will focus on environmental journalism.
Kasie Hunt, a CNN anchor and chief national affairs analyst, moderated the event and discussed her perspective on national topics like former President Donald Trump and how his rhetoric could affect the election outcomes in November.
“I was talking to a Republican candidate who actually had worked for Donald Trump and ended up being the sort of more mainstream of the candidates in this particular race,” Hunt, a GW alum, said. “And this person pointed out to me, he was meeting voters on the trail day in and day out, who were absolutely convinced of the things that Donald Trump was saying about the election in particular, that it was stolen from Donald Trump”
Gloria Borger, CNN’s chief political analyst, spoke about motivating voters when it comes to midterm elections. She said Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’ decision to fly immigrants to Martha’s Vineyard provided Republicans and Democrats the opportunity to motivate their respective bases.
“It’s cliché but midterm elections, especially, are about turnout,” Borger said. “And so what you’re seeing is both parties trying to figure out a way to get their people to the polls.”
David Chalian, CNN’s political director, spoke about the potential opportunity created for Democrats following the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade. Chalian said while abortion restrictions are being implemented around the country, the possibility of state-wide abortion bans will motivate a new electorate of single-issue voters that will rally around protecting abortion access during the midterms.
“Look for where abortion rights are going to be an actual issue on the ballot, like in a referendum where voters are voting,” Chalian said.
Voters in Kansas rejected a ballot measure that would have removed abortion rights protections in the state’s constitution in early August. It was the first state to hold a vote on abortion rights since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June.
Jasmine Wright, a CNN reporter covering the White House, talked about Democratic candidates’ attitudes toward Biden leading up to the midterms. When answering a question about President Joe Biden’s approval rating, Wright said across the board there has not been a total rebuke of his leadership because of policies the White House implemented like the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
Wright also said Biden’s attempts to shift national attention toward Trump and Republican extremism could shift votes during the midterms.
“He’s making it a referendum, not on himself, so much of what he’s done in office, but on former President Trump, even though he is not on the ballot,” Wright said.
The journalists finished the discussion by offering advice to students who want to get involved in fields like media and politics. Hunt talked about being persistent in the face of rejection from jobs and recommended students keep in contact and build relationships with people who may be involved in careers they are interested in.
“I would just recommend to you that if you are rejected, don’t let it get you down,” Hunt said. “Don’t let it stop you. Don’t let it get into your own head and make you judge yourself because if you work hard enough, the right thing will come your way.”

Foggy Bottom residents noticed DDOT placed 10 barriers at intersections along Virginia Avenue from G to 20th streets, blocking access to the bike lane on streets that lacked functioning traffic signals.
A local governing body announced the D.C. Department of Transportation will remove barriers blocking bike lanes and make all traffic lights operational on Virginia Avenue in the next two weeks during its monthly meeting Wednesday.
Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission Chair Joel Causey said the flashing single-color lights on Virginia Avenue will be turned on in one week while the street’s signals will become fully operational and the bike lane barriers will be removed within two weeks. Commissioners also said that Foggy Bottom D.C. Circulator stops on the Georgetown-Union route will likely be removed and two commissioners will fill the vacant position for the 2A08 single-member district on the ANC before the election in January.
Here are a few of the meeting’s highlights:
ANC chair announces removal of bike lane barriers, signal illumination on Virginia Ave
Causey said he received confirmation after “many favors” and extensive communication that DDOT officials will remove the barriers blocking the protected bike lane and fully illuminate the traffic signals on Virginia Avenue.
“That’s good news to everybody, and good news for bike people, and good news more importantly for our constituents who just want to safely get across,” Causey said at the meeting.
Foggy Bottom residents noticed DDOT placed 10 barriers at intersections along Virginia Avenue from G to 20th streets, blocking access to the bike lane on streets that lacked functioning traffic signals. This decision left pedestrians vulnerable to oncoming bikers last month. Causey said the bike lane’s opening without the proper lights was “premature” late last month.
Officials “disappointed” with expected Foggy Bottom D.C. Circulator stop closure
Commissioner Yannik Omictin said he wanted constituents to be aware of DDOT’s proposed stop consolidations on the Georgetown-Union route, which will remove the eastbound 21st Street and Pennsylvania Avenue stop and the westbound stop at 21st and K streets.
Omictin said he pressured DDOT to preserve the former stop because of its proximity to the Western Market, a popular Foggy Bottom shopping and dining complex that he said has recently had a “massive” expansion in vendors and employees.
He said despite these stops becoming increasingly popular among tourists, Western Market workers and GW students, it didn’t seem likely that the community’s requests would yield changes in the proposed stop consolidations based on his conversations with officials.
Commissioner Trupti Patel said she was “really disappointed” in the city’s decision to remove the stops and hopes DDOT reconsiders the removal of the stops in the future. She said the stop’s planned removal will make it more difficult for commuters to reach their jobs and for visitors to access Foggy Bottom businesses.
“Western Market is gonna restore a lot of vibrancy and economic prosperity to our ANC, and we already know that Foggy Bottom has not been seen as a popular destination,” Patel said during the meeting. “We’ve seen how businesses just leave when they don’t have people coming to them.”
Commissioners Omictin and Adam Friend to represent vacant district 
Causey said the ANC position for the 2A08 single-member district, which represents several residence halls on campus, will be vacant until January. He said Commissioner Omictin and Friend are “handling” the district for the time being.
James Harnett, a GW alumnus and former ANC chair, represented the 2A08 single-member district for two years before stepping down in 2020 because, as a GW alum, he could not continue living in a district that only represents on-campus GW students. Margaret McDonald, another GW student, filled the seat five months after Harnett stepped down and then eventually stepped down themself.
Harnett said student representatives have a limited amount of time they can serve and need to step down after graduating and leaving the district.
Patel said the ANC will still move forward with the new term, even if seats remain vacant after the elections. She said commissioners must jointly decide how to handle certain issues concerning that district when there’s a vacancy for a certain single member district on the ANC.
“If you don’t have a dedicated ANC commissioner, that discussion will not take place or it may not be highlighted and elevated as quickly as it could have been had they had a dedicated representative,” Patel said in an interview in 2020.

About 9,400 migrants have been bused to D.C. from Texas and Arizona since April. 
The D.C. Council voted unanimously to approve the creation of the Office of Migrant Services Tuesday, which will provide short-term assistance for migrants who have been bused to D.C. from Texas and Arizona after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.
Mayor Muriel Bowser’s office wrote the Migrant Services and Supports Emergency Act of 2022, which authorizes the use of $10 million to establish the office within the D.C. Office of Human Services and provide asylum-seekers in the District with food, shelter, clothing, transportation and legal services. Bowser declared a public emergency and proposed forming the office three weeks ago in response to Governors Greg Abbott, R-TX and Doug Ducey, R-AZ, sending about 9,400 migrants from their states to D.C. since April.
“This is a new challenge for D.C., but I feel confident that if we lead with our values, and if we put the right systems in place – which we are doing with the Office of Migrant Services, then we will lead a response that makes our community proud,” Bowser said in a statement.
Republican governors have bused and flown migrants who have crossed the U.S.-Mexico border to liberal bastions across the United States in a political stunt to draw attention to migrant crossings.
Bowser previously said the influx of asylum seekers in the District was a “growing humanitarian crisis” when she requested the U.S. Department of Defense activate the D.C. National Guard twice and was denied both times. Bowser said D.C. will be seeking reimbursement for funding the new office from the federal government through the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“Regardless of the federal response — which I think has been lacking in some respects — that the District of Columbia would continue to work with partners to advance what we need and ensure our systems in D.C. are not broken by a crisis that is certainly not of our making,” Bowser said in a press conference earlier this month.

Senate Chairperson Pro Tempore Demetrius Apostolis, who sponsored the bill, said GW Career Services plans to bring in 70 to 80 employers for a full-day career fair at The Smith Center in February.
The Student Association Senate unanimously passed a bill appropriating $4,000 to a career fair that will take place in February 2023.
The GW Career Exploration EXPO Act establishes a planning committee that will organize a University-wide career day next spring after officials held the last University-wide career fair pre-pandemic in January 2019, according to the University Calendar. Senate Chairperson Pro Tempore Demetrius Apostolis, the sponsor of the bill and the executive director of the planning committee, said officials plan to bring in 70 to 80 employers for the full-day event at The Smith Center.
“We’re actually looking to make this one of the hallmark events of the year, and so I’m really excited to actually get started,” Apostolis said. “I’ll be building a team very shortly.”
Apostolis said he has been in contact with the Vice Provost of Career Services Kelley Bishop to coordinate the career fair. He said he hopes the event will promote community among students and give employers a change to engage with students.
“This is a chance for GW to really connect students with employers and really help GW students take the next step in their process of getting into their career,” he said.
Apostolis said the event will feature a table where students can interact with GW Career Services and receive advice on their resumes.
Senators unanimously passed the Sustainability Chairperson Reform Act, which amends the SA bylaws by dropping the requirement that the chair of the sustainability committee had to be a member of the physical facilities and urban affairs committee.
Sen. Kai Simson, CPS-G and the sponsor of the bill, said if the chair of the sustainability committee were to step down, but the vice chair of the committee was not a member of the physical facilities and urban affairs committee, the vice chair would be unable to replace the chair, so the bill serves to make the chair position more accessible.
The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention also presented to the senate on the resources they offer and encouraged senators to direct students in need of assistance to the organization.
GW Votes, a nonpartisan student organization, also called on the SA to support them in their mission to mobilize the student body to register and vote in the upcoming midterm elections in a presentation to the senate.
Vice President Yan Xu said he is talking with GW Listens, a peer counseling program on campus, in an effort to train future peer support staff members.
The next senate meeting will be held on Oct. 3 at 8:30 p.m. in the Elliott School State Room.

The Colonials set new season highs with their five goals, 24 shots and 12 shots on goal in the game.
Men’s soccer defeated Howard in its most overpowering game yet with a resounding 5–0 victory that gave GW its second consecutive shutout win.
The Colonials (4-2-2) took a break from the Atlantic 10 slate to beat their crosstown rival at home with a flurry of offensive attacks and corner kicks that overwhelmed the Bisons (1-5). The Colonials bulldozed the Howard defense and only gained steam as the game wore on, scoring two in the first half and three in the second, in GW’s second straight game holding the opposing team scoreless.
GW dominated possession with a .208 shooting average and 12 shots on goal as they outsmarted the Bisons’ defense throughout the game. The Colonials’ five goals marked their highest scoring game since 2018 when they scored six goals against American in late August.
A shot from junior defender Lucas Matuszewski that fell short from the net kickstarted the action before Howard took possession and fired its first shot of the game from sophomore forward Baker Bryson at bottom center, but junior goalkeeper Justin Grady snatched it out of the air.
After the Colonials regained the ball, senior midfielder Elias Norris ran down the box to score the first goal for GW six minutes into the game. Graduate student midfielder Connor Stephens shot to score again for GW when he crossed it from the bottom left but failed to put it past freshman goalie JR Gawel.
GW and Howard entered a corner battle with each of their own kicks out of their respective boxes but failed to connect on either attempt. A bottom-left shot from junior midfielder Tim Neumann almost delivered the second goal for the Colonials, but a quick save by Bryson blocked the shot.
In the 62nd minute, senior midfielder Tiago Carvalho saw his chance to shoot with a right cross to graduate student midfielder Oscar Haynes Brown, who netted the second goal of the afternoon, good for a 2–0 Colonials lead.
The Colonials continued a shooting frenzy with four attempts aiming to further their lead, but they could not overcome Bryson’s steady hands in the final 20 minutes of the first half. The aggressive GW offense collected six fouls in the first half as a product of their pressure on the Bison’s defense.
The second half continued with six substitutions for GW that intensified the vigor on the field with help from freshman forward Alex Nicholson, junior midfielder Carter Humm and Haynes Brown.
In the first minute of the second half, the Bisons received a yellow card in response to a coach screaming from the sidelines.
The Bisons had two opportunities to gain their first goal of the match by way of two corner kicks, but they failed to press the ball in the zone long enough to score.
The Colonials proceeded to spur into action, first with a pair of shots on goal from Haynes Brown. One minute later, a GW corner kick fell to junior defense Aaron Kronenberg, who kicked the rebound ball down center to give the Colonials a 3–0 advantage.
GW locked down with some tight defense against the Bisons attacking for their first goal, but Grady clutched each shot at the net to hold Howard scoreless in the final 45 minutes of the game. The Colonials once again fired a corner kick in the 62nd minute when senior forward Tom Cooklin passed down the ball to Haynes to shoot and score, widening the lead to 4–0.
The Howard team earned two more warning yellow cards after junior Miles Sims and junior midfielder Abdullah Aljirafi attempted a tackle against GW. The Colonials responded with their final goal from freshman Nicholson who knocked home a bouncing ball from Norris, leading GW to the final score of 5–0.
The Colonials set new season highs with their five goals, 24 shots and 12 shots on goal in the game. GW will face Loyola Chicago on Saturday, and kickoff is set for 4 p.m.

Qui Qui delves into classic Puerto Rican cuisine like fried plantain bites called tostones, bringing comfort during difficult times for those away from home.
Located on 7th Street, Qui Qui’s salsa music and smell of fried plantain mixed with seasoned meat brought me straight home from the District all the way back to a traditional Puerto Rican atmosphere.
A 30-minute Metro ride from campus to Shaw, Qui Qui delves into classic Puerto Rican cuisine like fried plantain bites called tostones, bringing comfort during difficult times for those away from home. The restaurant draws inspiration from Chef Ismael Mendez, also known as “Qui Qui” by family members, who decided to create a new restaurant in 2018 that would honor his family roots and beloved traditions.
National symbols like the flor de maga, the island national flower, and el coqui, a frog species endemic to the island, as well as the Puerto Rican flag adorn the restaurant, fostering an environment of cultural appreciation for the island that I also call home. The wooden tables, colorful walls and worn smell bring a reminiscent feeling, similar to the ones found at my grandmother’s kitchen on the island.
Bottles of Don Q rum are placed at corners of each tiled table, but if you’re looking for a quick drink, you might be disappointed to find they are filled with water. The menu is in the form of a QR code stuck to the edge of the table with the number 21 on top of the code, a number associated with the jersey worn by the Puerto Rican baseball legend Roberto Clemente.
The exceptional customer service creates a welcoming atmosphere with staff who constantly check in and bring animated conversation to the customers. Wooden elements like barrels and figures decorate the small, cozy interior, bringing a sense of comfort for those dining, since traditional furniture on the island is made out of wood.
The menu offers a diverse selection of famous Puerto Rican plates like Morcilla, a pig-based sausage, and Sorullitos, a fried, corn-based appetizer that can be dipped in mayo-ketchup, a sauce famous on the island.
I ordered the Pastelón ($20), a dish that my mom would make after long days at school, made from seasoned ground beef with sweet plantains and cheese. The dish arrived in a hot cooking skillet that quickly brought the smell of home to our table. The seasoned meat tasted just like my childhood favorite, with the adobo spicing the recipe to Puerto Rican standards and the plantains, though not quite as mouth watering as back home, mixing in a perfect blend of sweetness.
The dish is perfect after long rain- or snow-filled days when you need to warm yourself up. For fellow Puerto Ricans, finding traditional dishes in the District like these will lift your spirit by bringing back nostalgic memories.
Qui Qui’s other entrees include the traditional chuleta Kan Kan, a tomahawk pork chop, the bistec encebollado – flap steak seasoned with onions – and mofongo, a fried smashed plantain dish typically filled with either meat or fish. The menu also offers refreshing drinks like Malta India and India coco, earthy and bitter tasting sodas that younger children typically enjoy.
This is the perfect location to visit if you’re looking to support Puerto Rican businesses in the District. Qui Qui, along with other restaurants in D.C., are donating proceeds to humanitarian efforts in Puerto Rico. After increased flooding and landslides on Sunday night, the island is currently without power and water utilities in the aftermath of Hurricane Fiona, which trashed the island’s power grid and caused the loss of homes.
Most towns in the south of the island are facing increased flooding since Sunday, with up to 30 inches of rainfall pouring down upon already ravaged neighborhoods. Around 1,000 residents across Puerto Rico, from more than 25 different municipalities, have had to be rescued since Sunday since they were unable to leave their homes due to the flooding submerging neighborhoods.
Organizations like Fundación Sin Límites, a nonprofit that looks to promote education and reduce poverty on the island, are looking for volunteers to donate supplies for Puerto Ricans. In a recent Instagram post, Fundación Sin Límites requested help in providing the necessary supplies like clothes, solar lanterns, first aid kits and water filters for the displaced families around the island.
As the crisis continues, Qui Qui is one of a few D.C. restaurants donating a portion of their proceeds to help the people of Puerto Rico during their time of need. Qui Qui is more than just a scrumptious restaurant – it represents a home away from home for students who are away from their families and provides a place to enjoy their culture with friends.

The student debt relief plan that the administration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris passed in August grants millions of borrowers the chance to get rid of some or even all of their student debt. This three-part plan forgives borrowers up to $20,000, extends the student loan repayment pause through 2022 and aims to streamline the student loan payment system. Americans pushed for student debt forgiveness for decades now while criticizing an education system that has grown far too costly.
Relief is far overdue considering former President Donald Trump hardly touched the idea of loan relief when he was in office and actually vetoed a major student debt relief bill.  And while the Biden-Harris administration’s loan forgiveness plan is definitely a step in the right direction, it is not enough. Considering the price tag of the United States’ education system – which costs an average of roughly $25,000 in tuition yearly for every in-state public school student – it discriminates against those of lesser financial status and perpetuates socioeconomic disparities to create a system that’s inaccessible overall.
Biden’s student debt forgiveness plan doesn’t address the absurd cost of higher education that is steadily rising. College has grown 169 percent more expensive in the last four decades and continues to rise each year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. At GW, tuition increased by 3.9 percent this past year to a whopping $62,110. And the University’s total cost of living now totals over $80,000 for on-campus undergraduate students. Saving up for college is no longer a feasible plan for most Americans. At the federal level, minimum wage hasn’t increased since 2009. The median household income has meanwhile decreased from $69,560 in 2019 to $67,521 in 2020. Income inequality is also worsening in the United States. Half of Americans own just about 2.5 percent of the country’s wealth as of 2021, and only three of the wealthiest citizens take home 45 percent of all new income. The rich continue to get richer, while the working class continues to struggle. Enabling such a costly education system perpetuates the detrimental cycle that abandons college plans under mounting tuition costs. The ability to attend and afford college should be a given for everyone, not a privilege.
Millions of more Americans would be able to attend college if it was more affordable, which would in turn open numerous employment opportunities and economic benefits. The cause of poverty often boils down to a lack of education, and making educational resources more widely available would play a role in decreasing crime in less financially stable neighborhoods.
The United States has more than enough money to sustain an affordable education plan. Take a look at other costly budgets in the U.S. – the military budget sits at roughly $801 billion annually, and the income security budget totals $215 billion, both outweighing the less than $189 million education budget. Implementing the American Family Plan, which would invest more in federal Pell Grant to make community college free, would cost about $290 billion – barely one-third of the military budget. Protecting the United States is vital, but so is educating those who selflessly protect the country for us. Federal officials should reallocate funds from other budget areas to work toward affordable education and avoid raising taxes on Americans.
Other countries like Denmark, Sweden, Germany and France have already committed to lowering the cost of college, leaving students with only small amounts of payments or even minor fees. Sweden offers free education for those pursuing doctorate programs. Germany slowly abolished tuition fees and created a dual education system that enrolls students in apprenticeships offering training and instruction instead of confining them to a single degree. Making college affordable is not a costly nor complex concept, and we have all of the resources we need to accomplish more affordable education now. The United States must follow in the footsteps of other countries to lower the cost of education for all.
While Biden’s recent student debt forgiveness plan is progress without a doubt, it is far overdue and cannot be the end of the push for affordable education. The United States education system has too much potential for the federal government to pass up investing in it. It’s time for us to recognize that education is a basic right, regardless of our financial status.

Baby boomers and Generation X often deem Generation Z weak. “Failure is a key to success,” “Pull yourself up by your bootstraps” and other mantras of the past have come crashing down for young people who struggle with their mental health. But in the face of these obstacles, Gen Z has an opportunity to acquire problem-solving skills and develop emotional resilience to improve their mental health.
Fortunately, the stigma around mental health vulnerabilities has recently declined, and we the people of Gen Z are more comfortable reaching out for help. But we are still reported to be the most diagnosed generation yet, with up to 44 percent of college students facing anxiety and depression. Research shows that these conditions generally stem from isolation during the pandemic, feeling overwhelmed with school, work and internships or experiencing uncertainty about finances, jobs and future aspirations. Instead of confronting challenges head-on, many have resorted to self-harm and substance abuse at alarming rates unlike other generations. But here at the University, I have partnered with GW Hillel to tackle the need for resilience head-on. Through GW Hillel’s newly launched mental health program and my personal research, we are establishing resilience groups on campus, open to all.
The return of students to campus last fall following the University’s reopening from the pandemic overwhelmed GW’s Counseling and Psychological Services with a depleted staff struggling to handle every student’s needs. Ever since, GW Hillel has been intent on establishing a mental health hub for students of any faith or demographic to help fill this gap. A new mental health extern named Celina Alvarez joined GW Hillel’s team this year to provide therapy sessions to students in hopes of providing a supplement to Counseling and Psychological Services. Now she’s helping to create student-led spaces for students to develop resilience, confidence and manage their own mental health outside of or in addition to traditional therapy sessions. 
Members of GW Hillel’s staff and I first connected over how the lessons in my book, “My Mother’s Mirror,” could help other students with their confidence and decision making. Resilience groups are small group seminars with no more than 10 students who discuss shared challenges, like stress, identity crisis, cross-cultural communication, parenting, religion, friendships or relationships. Students who join these groups will not only benefit from fortifying their mental toolbox, but they will also build a supportive group of friends to empower each other on a campus that is often criticized for lacking a sense of community mental health resources. 
Some of these tools come from the SELF-Ex program, which stands for set purpose, evaluate the situation, list all possible solutions, forge ahead and take action, then examine outcomes. The examination allows for a reflection on purpose. In their workshops, resilience groups will also incorporate GRIT – an acronym that the University of Southern California coined to stand for gratitude, responsibility, integrity and tenacity, which together can transform obstacles into opportunities and generate confident, value-based decisions. To embody GRIT, students need the safe space from resilience groups to voice challenges while embracing and managing their emotions. 
Once the program is fully developed by next month, I hope to be a partner with the University to focus on especially catering resilience groups to first-year students, perhaps in New Student Orientation programming. If students begin to cultivate resilience at the onset of their college experience, they can prevent potential episodes of discouragement and manage the obstacles they’ll face in their four-year journey and beyond. Any student who wants to form their own resilience group around a particular theme can reach out to GW Hillel or me via email or Instagram @sabrina.soffer. As this resilience movement grows on campus, I hope the demand facing CAPS will ease so it can attend to the students who need help the most.
Resilience groups are not a replacement for licensed counselors and therapists, but they’re another avenue where students can bolster their mindsets outside of the clinical realm in a student setting. Sometimes, the clinical aspect of therapy seems intimidating to Gen Z because therapists might lack a connection to the younger age without the same vulnerability that young people feel. That’s why students often open up to their closest friends for advice – those who will be able to share the safe space of resilience groups. 
Sharing the common bond of stress and anxiety, identity formation and relationship issues, Gen Z students who join resilience groups can find a shoulder to lean on for guidance and building resilience. Resilience groups can help GW students strengthen their mental muscle just as much as their academic one so that they feel equipped to manage adversities confidently at GW and beyond. I hope these resilience groups can inspire future generations with practical tools that make each challenge a pathway to strength and confidence.
