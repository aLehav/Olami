With a nine-game winning streak on the line, the GW softball team defeated UMass for the first time in program history, sweeping the series and extending its win streak to eleven.
Leading up to their triumph over UMass, the Colonials swept two conference games against Rhode Island, with the help of some stellar individual performances. Atlantic 10 conference player of the week, sophomore Victoria Valos, and A-10 conference pitcher and rookie of the week, freshman Meghan Rico, both kept the spotlight on the Colonials over the weekend games.
The Colonials (22-17, 9-3 A-10) played a close first game against Rhode Island (9-26, 2-9), but overcame challenging weather conditions to grab the 9-8 win.  In the second game, GW made quick work of the Rams, winning 9-1 in only six innings of play.
GW took advantage of the Rams’ struggling pitching, working the count and coming up with timely walks and hits. Senior Autumn Taylor was an offensive sparkplug for the Colonials, hitting a two-run homerun in the top of the sixth, and adding another RBI off her triple to right center.  Valos also added two singles and scored twice in the game.
“We sent a strong message to Rhode Island during the second game on Saturday and demonstrated that the weather and field conditions was not on our side during the first game”, said Coach Schramm, “We woke up the next day and said we are going to be a different team.”
Proud of their success over the nine-game winning streak, the Colonials moved to Amherst ready to challenge the defending A-10 conference champion, UMass. GW clicked on all cylinders during the first game of the doubleheader, en route to a comfortable 4-3 win.
“I honestly did not have to tell my girls anything after the first game to keep them motivated. I did not have to pull them in at any point in the game to make strategic adjustment. My job as a coach was very easy today because they were focused 110%.”
The bats got started quickly for the Colonials.  Stringing together two singles and walk, GW took a four run lead in the top of the second.  They were unable to be effective offensively throughout the rest of the game though, allowing UMass to fight back and ultimately fall just one run short after a three run bottom of the seventh.
The second matchup saw the Colonials remain consistent for the game’s entirety, exerting offensive skill, composure at the pitcher’s mound, and defensive pressure over the six innings of play.
GW started off the first inning with a run by senior Amanda Zakeri off a single to left field.  The Colonials then broke the game open in the fifth, scoring three runs on three hits and a walk.  Sophomore Samantha Dos Santos capped the inning off with a single to second, allowing Valos to score and increase the lead to 6-0.
Rico, who started on the mound for the Colonials, never looked back after a strong first inning and finished the game with a four-hit shutout.  The Minutemen could not muster any runs against Rico, who dropped her season ERA to 2.94 and earned her twelfth win of the season.
“Meghan succeeded in keeping her composure throughout the whole game. I wanted her to focus on not putting her emotions out there”, said Schramm, “She did a good job of maintaining her teammates’ confidence and she is able to bounce back from walking someone and is ready to strike out the next girl that comes up to the plate. ”
At the end of weekend action, two program records were broken by current Colonials.  Taylor stole the Colonials’ all-time RBI record, 94, and senior Amanda Zakeri eclipsed the record for career-stolen bases with 69.
Individual records aside, advancing to an eleven-game winning streak and a top two-spot in the current A-10 standings, Schramm is hopeful for Wednesday’s matchup with La Salle.
“We had a great weekend, but we have tough competition ahead. As next week approaches we will remain focused on our goal: to get the top spot for A-10 and win it”, said Schramm.

The deadly explosions in the Boston area last week will not impact security measures for the Commencement ceremony May 19, the University’s top security official said.
Senior Associate Vice President for Safety and Security Darrell Darnell said GW would continue to work with U.S. Park Police for the University-wide ceremony held on the National Mall. He would not provide specific plans for security but said the procedures would be “based upon any credible threats.”
“We will not discuss specific security plans and procedures but security will be adequate for the ceremony,” Darnell said in an email. University spokeswoman Michelle Sherrard said Friday that the events did not change the University’s plans.
Graduates faced heightened security in 2010 when first lady Michelle Obama headlined the ceremony. Students and families arrived early to pass through metal detectors and showed photo identification in order to enter the cordoned-off seating area.
Darnell wrote in the GW Today newsletter that neither the District nor any of GW’s campuses had received credible threats since bombs went off at the Boston Marathon on Monday. He added that GW would maintain its current level of security on campus or at University events.
“We are maintaining our normal security operations, but we are reiterating to our officers to always be on the lookout for suspicious or unusual behavior or activity,” Darnell wrote.
The message followed reports of letters addressed to President Barack Obama and Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., containing a deadly poison called ricin, which prompted the evacuation and lockdown of two Senate buildings Wednesday.
Darnell said the University works with its contractor, Pitney Bowes, to “provide on-going training to our mail handlers on how to spot suspicious mail and packages and what steps to take to notify to notify the proper authorities,” adding that mail has “already received an appropriate level of screening at the USPS distribution center before it arrives on campus.”
At least two colleges – the University of Nebraska at Lincoln and the University of Arizona – have considered bulking up security for large-scale events including commencement ceremonies, the Chronicle of Higher Education reported. Measures could include blocking off more areas before the event begins, adding surveillance and hiring more security guards to monitor suspicious individuals.

When tragedy strikes, counseling services and other campus support options come more sharply into focus. If those programs are not up to par when students need them most, criticism comes easy.
This time, the University is making progress, but still has more work to do.
Since new University Counseling Center director Silvio Weisner took over last fall, it seems to be moving in a more positive direction. The University has begun to carve out more time in counselors’ schedules to make them available for walk-in appointments. As a result, the number of walk-in appointments has increased by 42 percent this semester.
It is essential to have a walk-in option every day but especially during national crises like the one we endured in the past week. On the surface, the staffing reshuffling may seem minor, but the rewards are huge for students.
Offering students more opportunities for walk-in appointments means that students will no longer have to wait days or weeks see a counselor, and it will ensure that the University is able to accommodate more students than it ever has before.
But this hasn’t always been the case.
In the fall, the Hatchet reported a 40 percent increase in students who scheduled appointments with the UCC. But some students were waiting three to four weeks just to see a counselor. This was problematic because it meant that students couldn’t get the assistance that they urgently needed.
Mental health challenges are pervasive on college campuses. Twenty-seven percent of people between ages 18 to 24 have diagnosable mental health problems, like depression, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness.
The University’s response to this issue is helping combat the stigma surrounding mental health in this country. And that’s encouraging.
The counseling center has clearly made progress since former director John Dages and associate director Barbara Brown resigned from their posts in the past 18 months after staff members at the UCC complained about their poor leadership styles.
But the University shouldn’t let up in pursuing new ways to improve its counseling services.
The next step is to make sure more professors have some form of psychological training to help fulfill their dual role as teachers and mentors. Professors are the University’s closest link to students. If a student is struggling, professors are most likely to be the first to notice.
GW offers a CARE network, or an opportunity by which administrators, professors and students themselves can submit a students’ name to the UCC if they feel that he or she is experiencing mental or emotional difficulties.
But the resource goes largely unused.
The Hatchet conducted a study of 80 professors about the CARE network last month, and found more than 81 percent of them did not know much about the program or how it worked. The CARE network infrastructure already exists, but professors aren’t given adequate training for it to work effectively.
For this program to benefit students, professors should be trained to recognize the warning signs of depression and anxiety so that they can adequately respond to student needs.
The University cannot mandate that professors approach students when they suspect they are struggling, but it can make mental health resources more easily accessible.

At the start of each semester, professors spend the first few minutes of class going over the syllabus. It’s a routine, almost an afterthought, that every student comes to expect.
But as GW raises its academic ambitions by hiring better faculty and recruiting smarter students, academic integrity should not be an afterthought, as it is in almost every syllabus. It should be front and center. The University should greet new students not only with hype about internships, research and student organizations, but also about a campus culture that exudes academic integrity.
Right now, we have work to do to build that culture. GW reached an all-time high of 145 cases of academic integrity violations last year – a 45 percent rise that The Hatchet reported in the fall. While there is a general understanding that cheating is unacceptable, beyond that, many students do not know the specifics of the Code of Academic Integrity, let alone whether or not we have one.
As administrators plan how to inform next year’s freshmen during Colonial Inauguration and Welcome Week, the University should consider some key changes that elevate academic integrity.
GW could, for example, follow the lead of Davidson College in North Carolina, where the honor code is an integral part of the college experience. Davidson has a two-paragraph pledge that covers everything from academic integrity to theft which students must sign before enrolling. This is a policy that GW should look to implement.
GW’s Code of Academic Integrity is long and drawn out, spanning 10 pages and five articles. Therefore, the meaning is lost on many students. The detailed set of rules and punishments may help curb cheating, but it’s not making enough of an impact.
Handing out a short, direct and concrete pledge in students’ first week at GW would help to build a culture of academic honesty on campus by etching those words into our minds as we start as Colonials.
Tim Terpstra, director of the Office of Academic Integrity, told me in an interview that schools with an integrity code have lower incidents of cheating. And research shows he’s right: Donald McCabe, a professor at Rutgers University and a leading scholar in cheating, verifies this in his 2005 study, “Cheating among college and university students: A North American perspective.”
But McCabe also argues that students must feel some sense of ownership over the code. “It is the peer culture itself…that appears to be the most significant factor in influencing the level of academic dishonesty,” he wrote.
The honor code at Davidson is more than just a pledge – it is a larger part of the culture there.
A representative from the college’s Honor Council is assigned to each freshman hall to facilitate dialogue about academic integrity, and all students are given a book of detailed information about the honor code and Code of Responsibility.
The reason this works is because it engages students in a dialogue – which is not something GW does right now.
Administrators have tried to balance the entertainment of Welcome Week and Colonial Inauguration with a message that promotes academic excellence. But it hasn’t gone all the way toward demanding that students remain devoted to academic integrity.
In an effort to elevate his office’s visibility on campus, Terpstra has spoken to numerous students and faculty groups.
Unfortunately, academic integrity has not been a part of Colonial Inauguration programming in recent years. Terpstra told The Hatchet in an article last year that the University thought he was a “downer” at a time when students are supposed to gain enthusiasm about coming to the University.
And a pledge we all sign would expose students to the Office of Academic Integrity before even enrolling in courses.
There is no cure-all to cheating. But engaging students with the code from day one would be a way to prevent cheating going forward.

My hometown in Pennsylvania has a population is just shy of 5,500 people. We have one grocery store, one gas station and a small pizza place. A tiny, family-owned pharmacy sits on Main Street, 10 yards from the post office and the local bar, the Uptown Tavern.
Needless to say, living in D.C. has been quite an adjustment. The large crowds of tourists and the high-profile public officials draw armed guards, sometimes making D.C. feel like a police state. My parents like to comfort me by saying that I live in the safest city in the country, but sometimes it doesn’t feel that way.
After the bombings at the Boston Marathon last week, that feeling of protection is eroding.
Between aggressive rhetoric from North Korea, the slew of letters tainted with ricin sent to a number of public officials and the increased security presence in the White House and in the Hart Senate office building, it feels like nearly everyone has been on edge.
Now, I’m constantly feeling anxious. I can’t take my eyes off of backpacks and suitcases in the Metro. I miss the cozy streets of my small hometown.
I don’t regret moving to D.C., but these events make the adjustment more difficult. Walking around the District the past few days, I’ve tried to avoid large crowds and I’ve shied away from leaving the Foggy Bottom Campus. The move to the big city has not been as seamless as I hoped it would be.
Terror threats, of course, aren’t new. But for the first time for today’s college students, they seem real.
As a second grader, I remember watching CNN footage of the terrorist attacks on 9/11. At the time, I couldn’t fully comprehend what I was watching. I remember thinking that the CNN footage looked like a movie, and that it probably wasn’t real. I understood that something bad had happened, but the gravity of the situation was left to the adults.
In that respect, I feel lucky. But at the same time, many of us in the U.S. have never experienced a lifestyle in which we are threatened with death or injury so frequently.
We cope with this fear in many different ways. I have done so by watching and consuming as much news as I can. And when I’m confused or afraid, I feel as though I need to hash out the details with someone.
However, I’ve realized that the only way to overcome this sense of anxiety is to keep living. No amount of police officers can make us feel truly secure. The only way to fight the fear is to acknowledge its presence and move on.

Freshman Suzy Wilson remembers spending holidays at her grandmother’s house, where her favorite snacks – Fritos and ginger ale – were always laid out.
But when she was in the seventh grade, her grandmother passed away from lung cancer, prompting her to captain the Phi Sigma Sigma sorority Relay for Life team in her memory – the kind of story shared by several of the 860 students who raised $61,000 at Relay for Life Saturday night.
“She didn’t get to see any of her grandchildren married or anything like that,” Wilson said. “It’s really hard.”
The 12-hour walk around the indoor track at the Lerner Health and Wellness Center brought more than 50 student groups together, raising a record amount for the American Cancer Society. For some students, the relay is a chance to reflect on those they have lost. For others, it is a time to support their friends or remember the stories of those who have survived.
This year, more than 860 students attended the event, slightly fewer than the 1,000 that participated last year.
Relay for Life chair Lauren Clark said participation far exceeded her expectations of about 500 people, and said volunteers printed more registration forms throughout the night.
“There are a lot of things that happen on campus that are a little bit more specific, but the American Cancer Society represents every type of cancer. Everyone that’s been affected by cancer can relate to this cause, and so many people have been affected by cancer,” Clark said.
Students who stayed overnight in the gym were assigned sites on the third floor, and brought air mattresses, tents, food and games for when they were not walking around the track from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. Participants took part in tug-of-war and hula hoop contests, and tie-dyed clothing throughout the night.
The top three teams – Reene’s Runners, Alpha Phi Omega and GW Women’s Rugby – each raised more than $4,000. The 11-member team Reene’s Runners brought in $4,758, compared to the second-place team, Alpha Phi Omega, which had 91 members.
Freshman Alli Meyer said she had not seen an event in her first year at GW that brought so many students from different organizations together.
“I’m doing this with my sorority, and it’s nice to see that everyone really comes together,” she said. “It’s not just one group of people here, there are so many people to be here. Everyone has a reason to be here and it’s really what Relay is all about.”
Musical groups, including the GW Sirens and the GW Troubadours, performed throughout the night. The Troubadours, which was awarded crowd favorite at the Battle of the A Cappella Groups, sang during the luminaria ceremony, a more somber lap dedicated to cancer survivors.
Camp Kesem, a student group that hosts a week-long summer camp for children ages six to 18 that have a family member with cancer, took part in the relay again, bringing campers along for one of the reunions they host throughout the year.
One of the camp’s participants and her mother both spoke during the opening ceremony and told Relay attendants how the camp made both their lives easier while their father and husband was suffering from cancer.
Junior Shailly Gaur, Camp Kesem’s public relations coordinator, said that the two organizations had similar missions, so it made sense to include the campers.
“It’s a fun atmosphere. They’re able to see us again, it’s a normal reunion atmosphere. But they also remember why it is they come to camp, why it is they’re involved,” she said.

Clarification appended
He blew $500 of Christmas money on cocaine, snorting a half-ounce until New Year’s Eve. Then he had to stop – his nose was bleeding.
He had to try something different.
The sophomore, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, cooked crack in his basement while his parents slept in their room above him.
His mother cleaned his room soon after, and instead of finding marijuana, which she already knew he smoked, she found Oxycontin and heroin.
He first snorted heroin only a couple months before then, and when he came back to D.C. – after going to an intensive outpatient program over winter break – a former student offered him more.
The sophomore turned it down. Four days later, Dean Smith, the former student who offered him more drugs, died from an accidental overdose.
Smith, 20, died Jan. 13 from an overdose of heroin, diazepam and cocaine, according to the D.C. Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. Smith, who attended GW from fall 2011 to spring 2012, died in the District.
The sophomore, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Smith’s death intensified his fight to stay off drugs.
“You hear about it happening, you know?” he said. “But when it’s someone you know, who you used to see all the time, who you used to get high with, it’s really different.”
He has been clean for about four months now, and takes drug tests every week, which he must pass or his parents will pull him out of GW.
The sophomore said his drive to stay at GW and regular sessions at the University Counseling Center – mostly to address his bipolar disorder – have kept him from slipping.
Some friends have cut ties with him since he quit drugs, but he said most, even those who still use drugs, were happy for him.
“They were proud of me, because they could tell I was in a bad place,” the sophomore said. “I was like a skeleton. I was super pale and everything.”
He had never tried drugs until his senior year of high school, when he first smoked marijuana. After coming to GW, his drug use spiraled out of control, from alcohol to psilocybin mushrooms to acid.
But the sophomore said heroin was different. The users he knows, about eight who attend GW, sometimes do not even tell their closest friends about their habit.
Reports of heroin use on campus are rare, Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities director Gabriel Slifka and associate director for the Center for Alcohol and Other Drug Education Alexis Janda said earlier this month.
“Since I began working at GW, I have not had a student discuss or disclose use of heroin to me,” Janda said.
The sophomore said the group would only stop using heroin if they drained their stashes or ran out of cash. They had to take larger and larger doses to get high as their tolerance to the drug rose, and turned to other opiates such as Percocet and Vicodin when they could not get their hands on heroin.
“You’re just really not you. Obviously, you could say that about any drug, but with heroin, once you start doing it, the craving for it is unbelievable,” he said. “I told myself I would never do that.”
He remembers Smith falling asleep standing up from the effects of heroin, and watching as his skin turned yellow and the whites of his eyes turned green. He said Smith bought heroin off campus from a dealer in the city.
Another student, a junior who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Smith was the only student he knew who sold heroin. He knew Smith since high school, and said Smith had already gone to rehab multiple times before he came to GW.
The junior said Smith moved to the Mount Vernon Campus for some time and his health seemed to improve, with color returning to his face.
Smith, who was from Georgia, left GW in spring 2012 to return to rehab, the students said. When the junior saw him in D.C. before winter break began this year, he said the former student looked “near death.”
“It was like one of the most disgusting, freakish things I’ve ever seen, just because I knew those were just chemicals that were swimming in his body,” the junior said.
The sophomore said his drug use at GW intensified as the years passed.
He said the notion that marijuana is a gateway drug proved true for him, and his first experiences with weed revealed a “whole new world.”
“Once you get your first taste of that escape, you want it again. You just want to keep getting it and getting it,” he said. “In my case, it’s about getting out of your own mind because it’s a scary place. It’s about numbing yourself from society, from school work, from whatever you have to do.”
He and his friends bought acid for $650 a sheet, which he called “easier to get than a cheeseburger” on campus last year. He sold about 100 tabs of acid a week and made $1,500.
But that was not enough.
The sophomore then tried cocaine at a club in D.C., followed by Oxycontin at $30 per pill. He took speed every day and lost 20 pounds in two months. He tried MDMA, Ketamine and research chemicals over the course of two years.
“It really is like a web. You just move from person to person. You just gotta make the connections. It’s really easy – it’s so easy,” he said.
He became more withdrawn around friends and at parties, keeping to himself until someone in the room started to talk about drugs. He got in trouble with the police and failed class after class.
“I’ve like commando crawled across my parents’ bedroom floor in the middle of the night to steal money to buy drugs,” he said. “I stole money from kids. I beat some kid up one time. I’d steal drugs from people – just scheming pretty much. That’s what we’d call it.”
For the junior, his use of heroin was short-lived – he quit about three weeks after he took up the habit. He still uses another opiate, Oxycotin, which he said is popular on campus.
“If you’re hooked on anything, you’re going to feel like there’s a void that’s being filled while you’re on the drug and when you’re not on it, it’s completely empty and, not only that, it freaks you out. Like it scares you more than anything,” he said. “And then it gets to a point where you’re on top of this mountain and the only way to get off of it is to jump off this cliff. That’s basically heroin addiction, too, more so than other drugs.”
Deaths from drug overdose in the United States quadrupled from 1999 to 2010, according to a February report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in February.
John Hroncich, a 24-year-old law student, died Dec. 20 from an accidental overdose of heroin and Adderall in his New Jersey home. Last year, 28-year-old law student Benjamin Gupta also died from drug use – a lethal mix of oxycodone and alcohol.
The sophomore said he was asked to list what he valued the most while in an outpatient program back home, and then worked to figure out what held him back from those goals. He realized drugs were holding him back, which motivated him to let them go.
“I thought the things that I value the most were the things I actually held true, but in reality, I didn’t hold true,” he said. “Luckily for me, someone was there – my parents were there, people were there to help me.”
