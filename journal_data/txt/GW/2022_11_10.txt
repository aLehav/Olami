The first two Season 2 episodes of “The Sex Lives of College Girls” premieres Nov. 17 on HBO Max. The 10-episode season will continue with a two episode-per-week rollout culminating with the season finale on Dec. 15. 
There has never been a shortage of successful high school dramedies on television, but series set in college are few and far between, making Mindy Kaling’s “The Sex Lives of College Girls” truly a one-of-its-kind find.
While high school is undeniably a more universal American experience, a TV show set in college strikes a rare dynamic of characters teetering somewhere in between adolescence and adulthood while living just blocks from one another on the same campus. The comedy written, produced and directed by the “The Office” alumna utilizes relatable teen tropes in four randomly assigned freshmen roommates – Kimberly (Pauline Chalamet – yes, Timothee’s sister), Bela (Amrit Kaur), Leighton (Reneé Rapp) and Whitney (Alyah Chanelle Scott) – whose engaging portrayals of tumultuous friendships, relationships and hookups are the heart of the series.
Despite its name, the essence of “The Sex Lives of College Girls” truly lies in its authentic depiction of female friendships found during the formative years between the ages of 18 and 22. Season 1, which premiered on HBO Max last November, introduced viewers to four distinct archetypes of college women to illustrate the ins and outs of navigating relationships and sex during a period of life that can be intense, dramatic and uncertain for anyone, not just those who attend college.
Overachieving, awkwardly lovable, work-study student Kimberly struggles to fit in among her wealthier peers. Ambitious-yet-goofy aspiring comic Bela provides an autobiographical look into Kaling’s experience as a young Indian-American woman hoping to break into the male-dominated world of comedy. Seemingly effortlessly composed student athlete Whitney juggles a secret affair with her married soccer coach while trying to escape the shadow of her overbearing mother, who happens to be a famous Congresswoman. It takes closeted New York City it-girl Leighton a few episodes to break down her emotional walls, but once she does, she has impeccable chemistry with the other three roommates.
As each character develops throughout a chaotic first trimester at the fictional Essex College in Vermont, inspired by Kaling’s own alma mater Dartmouth, the quartet’s unlikely friendship continues to blossom despite their immense differences in personalities, interests and backgrounds – a common phenomenon in college roommates, thrown together in a turbulent period of their lives.
We got an advanced look at the first six out of 10 episodes of Season 2, which premieres with the first two episodes Nov. 17 on HBO Max. The 10-episode season will continue with a two episode-per-week rollout culminating with the season finale on Dec. 15.
Now back for their second trimester after returning from Thanksgiving break, the girls are faced with an all-new set of problems. Kimberly loses her scholarship after being caught cheating on a test and is forced to find a creative way to pay her tuition without her parents knowing. Leighton is finally out to her peers at school but ends up in over her head in a messy attempt to catch up on the dating scene she’s missed, which could potentially impact her chances of rushing a sorority. Upon leaving her once-coveted spot at Essex’s prestigious comedy magazine after experiencing sexual harassment, Bela struggles to pave her own way when she starts an all-women comedy group faced with barriers including low readership and campus engagement. Whitney finds herself with no passions or hobbies to fall back on after ending things with her coach and quitting soccer, unsure of her identity outside of the sports world.
Although obstacles are still thrown at each character, this season feels lighter – the friendships are stronger, the characters are more defined and each member of the group has seemingly learned to stick to their convictions in ways that were less apparent in Season 1 when they struggled to find their place in the transition between high school and adulthood.
Kimberly is noticeably more secure and confident in her romantic pursuits, Leighton no longer feels internal pressure to hide her sexuality from her friends, Bela stands up for herself against powerful men despite inevitable pushback and Whitney takes control of her narrative for the first time with an especially exciting budding romance with Kimberly’s adorable coworker at the campus coffee shop, Canaan (Chris Meyer). As an added bonus, the arrival of Jackson (Mitchell Slaggert), a transfer student who frequently appears in the hallway shirtless, piques the attention of all of the girls, even Leighton.
Overall, the first half of Season 2 ultimately shines in the places where some of Season 1 fell short. Rapp’s mean-girl portrayal of Leighton in Season 1 is witty and entertaining – after all, Rapp starred as Regina George in Tina Fey’s “Mean Girls” Broadway musical adaptation, so she’s no stranger to embodying a “queen bee” persona. But the series feels most authentic when each girl lets down her guard with one another, which is the essence of Season 2, aided by the on-screen chemistry among Chalamet, Rapp, Kaur and Scott.
It’s clear that the series will continue to flourish throughout the remainder of Season 2 and onward if renewed for a third season. The heartfelt and hilarious comedy does not skip out on drama or sex, but its wide-ranging, sometimes-exaggerated depictions of college life successfully illustrate the nuances of an extremely multifaceted period of life.

Incumbent Commissioner Yannik Omictin appears to have clinched the 2A01 seat with about 70 percent of the vote in the ANC election Tuesday night according to the D.C. Board of Elections.
Updated: Nov. 12, 2022 at 11:03 a.m.
Voters decided their neighborhood’s representatives for the next two years in Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission elections Tuesday night, with unofficial results from the D.C. Board of Elections reporting winning candidates in seven races while ballots continue to be counted Wednesday night.
Incumbent Yannik Omictin seems to have secured the 2A01 seat for a second term against challenger Susana Baranano and Jordan Nassar secured victory in the 2A08 single-member district. A DCBOE official said Wednesday morning that some D.C. ballots are still being counted and official election results will be released next Tuesday, but given the smaller voting pool, some candidates have declared victories already. Read more about the races below.
Incumbent Yannik Omictin defeats fellow alum with 70 percent of the vote
Incumbent Commissioner Yannik Omictin appears to have clinched the 2A01 seat with about 70 percent of the vote in the ANC election Tuesday night according to the D.C. Board of Elections, likely defeating his opponent Susana Baranano, a GW alumna and paralegal who brought in about 25 percent of the vote. Omictin, who won with a tally of 59 votes, announced his own victory Tuesday night, tweeting that it looks “likely” he secured the 2A01 seat and thanking his colleagues and mentors for their help during his reelection campaign.
“Now to a new crop of Commissioners in ANC2A, a group of people with whom we can truly dream big about the future of our neighborhood, with whom we can get our ANC affairs in order and aspire to be a model for the city,” Omictin said in the tweet. “Let’s get to work.”
Omictin graduated from GW in 2021 and has represented the southern end of Foggy Bottom, including Mitchell and Thurston halls and apartment buildings like The York and the Statesman on the ANC for the last two years. Baranano, a GW grad with two degrees from 1979 and 1993, lost the election for 2A01 commissioner for the second time, collecting 25 votes, after being defeated in the race for the same seat 24 years ago in 1998.
Omictin said in September he will prioritize ending homelessness and improving transportation in 2A01 during his next two years on the ANC. He said he also wants D.C. officials to offer housing voucher accommodations and equitable income opportunities to unhoused people in the E Street encampment.
Omictin also said he wants to wrap up long-term projects that the commission couldn’t complete within the 10 meetings of his first term, like expanding neighborhood transportation via bike lane implementation and in the future, closing H Street to motorized vehicles.
“It would be an honor to continue serving everyone in Foggy Bottom and standing up for our most vulnerable neighbors,” Omictin said in a text Sunday. “Having served one term, I’m ready to hit the ground running on a number of projects.”
Baranano, his challenger, lost the race with just under 30 percent of the vote and a tally of 25 votes. She earned two master’s degrees from GW in 1979 and 1993, and said in a September interview that if elected, she would draft a bill of rights into the ANC outlining the constituency’s priorities of stronger traffic safety and neighborhood outreach.
“I mean we all live in the same neighborhood, we cross the same streets, we eat at pretty much the same places,” Baranano said.
D.C. resident Jordan Nassar clinches the 2A08 seat after running unopposed
Originally from Texas, resident Nassar won the 2A08 seat with more than 96 percent of the vote and 111 votes tallied after running unopposed. He will cover the area covering District House, Lafayette Hall, Western Market and 2100 Penn, and said he hopes to bridge the gap between students and the neighboring Foggy Bottom and West End community.
6A06 Commissioner Robb Dooling announced Nassar’s and his own victory Wednesday afternoon, tweeting a selfie with the ANC newcomer and congratulating him on the win. Dooling also thanked constituents in his own district for electing him for a third term.
“DC has two Deaf elected officials starting in January 2023!” Dooling said in the tweet. “Congratulations and hands waving to Jordan Nassar!”
Nassar said in an email Wednesday night he accepted his victory after receiving numerous congratulatory messages from ANC commissioners and constituents and that he “appreciates” the ballot counting process in its entirety despite the delayed official results.
Nassar said he plans to control the rat population that makes basic nightly activities uncomfortable during his first term on the ANC and wants to push for a greater student involvement in the local governing body, which he said would be an “asset” to the commission.
“The win seems and feels unreal, but it is one that I inspires me to make it deserving for the rest of my upcoming two-year term for everyone,” Nassar said in an email Wednesday night.
This post has been updated to correct the following:
The Hatchet misspelled Dooling’s last name in an earlier version of this post. The correct spelling is now reflected. We regret this error.

SBA Sen. John Schmidt said he voted for the bill because it was a “good use” of SBA funds as it showed support for the organization.
The Student Bar Association Senate unanimously approved funding to reimburse the costs of a Diwali dinner for 32 South Asian students.
The SBA Senate unanimously approved $1555.24 in ad hoc funding for the South Asian Law Students Association, reimbursing them for a celebratory Diwali dinner. SBA Sen. John Schmidt said he voted for the bill because it was a “good use” of SBA funds as it showed support for the organization.
“I support the growth of this organization and signal our support of it by giving funding to this event that they hosted,” Schmidt said.
Jagriti Khurana, the president of the South Asian Law Students Association, said the organization only received about 25 percent of the amount it requested during the SBA’s original budget allocations, so she made the request due to an increase in participation in the organization.
The SBA unanimously approved an authorization to give $250 to second-year law student Aashini Choksi in order to fund her travel to New York for the City University of New York School of Law’s lecture on the climate crisis, climate refugees and how to address the issues. Choksi is a member of the Journal of Environment and Energy Law.
“I think it would be a really good way for me to learn more about this area and really connect with people who are dedicating their legal research to this specific topic, especially because it’s so new and there’s not a lot of ground covered on it,” Choksi said.
The SBA Senate has $25,062 remaining of its initial $30,000 ad hoc budget, which exists to provide funding requested by individuals and organizations within the Law School after the standard, per-semester budgeting process ends.
The SBA also unanimously approved the Model UN Techniques Act, which will authorize the use of friendly amendments and unmoderated caucusing in the parliamentary procedure of the SBA, drawing directly from Model UN parliamentary procedure. SBA Sen. Amanda Grace, who co-sponsored the bill, said they proposed this act to provide the Senate with more flexibility.
“This bill is really just to serve to try to expedite and codify some things that we currently do that are kind of unspoken rules that we follow, which really shouldn’t happen, because it really would be us diverting a bit too much from what our bylaws stipulate,” Grace said.
Executive Vice President Garrett May swore in two new second-year senators, Vedansh Vashisht and Hadil Helmy, along with two new associate SBA Supreme Court judges who were confirmed in the SBA Senate’s last meeting in late October. Executive Chief of Staff Sydney Blitman said 70 of the roughly 90 students in the second-year class voted in the election.
The SBA Senate also unanimously approved a joint resolution commemorating Professor Dmitry Karshtedt, who died on Oct. 30. The resolution describes Professor Karshted’s contributions to the GW law community and offers condolences to his family, friends, colleagues, and students.
“Professor Karshtedt is the standard for members of this profession,” the resolution reads. “His humor, humility and dedication to this community will be sorely missed.”
SBA Sen. Bree Vculek, who co-sponsored the resolution, said the circumstances were “devastating,” but she hoped the resolution could share condolences.
“I think that the least that we can do on behalf of the George Washington University Law School student body to commemorate the positive impact of Professor Karshted is to honor him through something like this joint resolution,” she said.
The next SBA Senate meeting will be held on Nov. 29, 2022 at 9:15 p.m.

SA Sen. Henry Deng, CCAS-U, who sponsored the resolution, said the legislation will make the formation of resource groups easier, only requiring three SA members to start the group and approval from the chair and vice chair of the Diversity and Inclusion Assembly to form.
The Student Association Senate unanimously passed an act that will work toward simplifying internal operations for advocacy groups in the SA.
The Encouraging Advocacy Act reforms resource groups, groups within the SA’s Diversity and Inclusion Assembly that advocate for specific issues, giving students who are not SA members an opportunity to work with SA senators to discuss and formulate SA policy about issues important to them. The act will better define the process of forming resource groups, giving students clear guidance on the conditions needed to maintain the group.
SA Sen. Henry Deng, CCAS-U, who sponsored the resolution, said the legislation will make the formation of resource groups easier, only requiring three SA members to start the group and approval from the chair and vice chair of the Diversity and Inclusion Assembly to launch. The act also lays out the responsibilities of resource groups, which include backing SA legislation, formulating reports and meeting with University administrators about their concerns.
“There have been many caucuses and resources coming and going,” Deng said. “And there are no clear guidelines on how they should be defined and how they should be supposed to work in the SA.”
SA Sen. Cody Ingraham, Law-G, spoke in support of the Encouraging Advocacy Act and said the act would give the SA more flexibility to focus on timely issues without having to follow the narrow guidelines that were previously in the SA Constitution. Resource groups would then be able to issue recommendations and gather student input.
“This really aligns with policy issues,” Ingraham said. “This would allow senators who have a certain policy interest to create a fluid resource group without having to have say such a formal structure that’s embedded in the Constitution.”
The SA also unanimously passed the University Wide Program Fund Committee Reorganization Act, clarifying the SA’s internal documents to show that the SA does not control this funding. The committee and fund is composed of SA senators and University staff members from the Office of Student Life and provides funding from the University for campus organizations.
Senators rejected a motion to reconsider the Mount Vernon Meeting Act, which failed at the last SA meeting and would have removed the requirement from SA bylaws to hold an annual meeting on the Mount Vernon Campus.
The governance and nominations committee decided to not move forward with Arjun Singh’s nomination for legislator general, rejecting his nomination. The position was previously occupied by Andrew Harding, who announced his resignation Oct 30.
President Christian Zidouemba addressed the progress of a project that would introduce Plan B contraceptive pill vending machines to campus, making it easily available to students, as well as a project to improve textbook affordability. Zidoeumba said he met with Provost Chris Bracey to discuss the accessibility and affordability of textbook materials to students.
Zidouemba also said he has not yet filled the vacant seat on the Student Court due to a lack of applications, but hopes to fill the position before the end of the school year, with interviews for the seat beginning soon.
“It’s my duty to make sure that I’ve been with the best people in our campus, not only being able to bring people to the court, is a duty I don’t take lightly,” he said. “With that being said I had to push some applications because I didn’t receive enough candidates.”
Vice President Yan Xu said that he spoke with facilities managers about menstrual product dispensers being fully stocked in all University bathrooms. Xu said his team will continue to follow up with facilities to make sure those products are continuously available.
Xu also spoke of the textbook concerns facing students and said he spoke with Provost Bracey about officials’ plans for addressing student access.
“There is a textbook accessibility issue on campus and they are taking active actions, [Bracey] suggesting that he’s going to use open source materials and help the faculty adjust to open-source materials in their instruction and also provide access through library services,” he said.
During the public comment session, former executive Chief of Staff Cordelia Scales said that processing delays within GW’s mail system has caused her to almost miss voting in two elections, and she wants the SA to take action. Senators unanimously passed the Election Day Voting Act at their last meeting, recommending faculty excuse absences on Election Day.
The next Senate meeting will be held Nov. 21 at 8:30 p.m. in the Elliott School State Room.

Officials announced plans for the 320-bed residence hall in December 2018 and hoped to complete construction by fall 2022, but temporarily suspended the plans due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Faculty Senate will vote on a resolution to support the construction of a new residence hall on GW’s Foggy Bottom Campus at the senate meeting Friday.
Faculty senators will vote on the resolution – co-written by the senate’s physical facilities and education policy and technology committees – urging officials to resume plans for a new residence hall on the corner of 20th and H streets, across from University Yard. Officials announced plans for the 320-bed residence hall in December 2018 and hoped to complete construction by fall 2022, but temporarily suspended the plans due to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the resolution.
The resolution states that the new residence hall is a “safe investment” for the University as it would help attract undergraduate applicants and provide more housing for existing undergraduates, as the newly renovated Thurston Hall holds 280 fewer beds than it did prior to the renovations officials completed this fall.
“Building a new residence hall is widely recognized as a safe investment that promises to enhance both the student experience and the financial stability of the George Washington University,” the resolution states.
Caroline Laguerre-Brown, the vice provost for diversity, equity and community engagement, will also deliver an update on Title IX regulations at the meeting. The presentation was originally scheduled for the October senate meeting, but it was moved to the November meeting agenda after faculty discussion on the Medical Faculty Associate’s finances extended beyond the allotted time for the October meeting.
Officials are working to reform Title IX policy in the wake of students’ criticism of the Title IX office’s handling of sexual assault cases and the Department of Education’s announced plans to reinstate Title IX regulations that the Trump administration removed.
David Diemert – the chair of GW’s Medical Advisory Group, the public health body that advises GW’s COVID-19 policies – will also present an update from the group to the senate.
Jay Goff, the vice provost for enrollment and student success, will deliver an update on enrollment at the University to the senate.
Provost Chris Bracey will also introduce Michael Glazer, the vice provost for budget and finance, and will present a report to the senate. Interim University President Mark Wrighton and Jim Tielsch, the chair of the senate’s executive committee, will also share reports Friday.

Fans packed the Smith Center for GW's home opener Monday night, pushing the attendance to 1,711 – higher than all but one of last season's games.
Men’s basketball took down Virginia State 85-58 Monday in its first regular season matchup after dominating the paint and pulling away with a dominant second half scoring run.
The Colonials scored 38 points inside the paint and outrebounded the Trojans 47 to 40 through the game, allowing them to control the pace and build a sizable lead. The final score marked the first regular season victory of Head Coach Chris Caputo’s tenure with the Colonials since his offseason arrival, following a preseason victory last Thursday. 
In a game that even drew ESPN NBA insider Adrian Wojnarowski to the stands, fans packed the Smith Center for GW’s home opener Monday night, pushing the attendance to 1,711 – higher than all but one of last season’s games. The turnout was dramatically more than that of last Sunday’s exhibition match victory against Western Connecticut State.
“Yeah, it was amazing playing in front of the fans,” senior guard James Bishop said. “It’s really a sixth player on that floor. We’ve got a packed house and bringing that energy and talking trash out there, really helps out.”
Bishop led the way for GW, netting a game-high 21 points and dishing out nine assists, while only committing one turnover. Bishop shot six for 13 from the floor and just one for six from three but managed to draw multiple fouls and hit eight free throws.
Less than a minute into the game, Bishop made an inside layup off an assist from senior forward Ricky Lindo for the game’s first score. Virginia State responded with a layup of their own before junior center Noel Brown scored inside off the dish from Bishop.
For the next six minutes the Colonials held a narrow lead as both offenses traded scores. With 12 minutes to go in the first half, the home crowd got to their feet when graduate guard E.J. Clark threw an alley-oop that Brown slammed home with force.
GW managed to hold on to a a six point lead through much of the first half as fouls started to rack up for both squads heading into halftime.
With six minutes to go, Bishop found senior forward Hunter Dean under the basket for an easy dunk. Dean netted nine points and grabbed four rebounds during the game, even though Caputo said he was on a minutes restriction following an offseason plagued by injury.
“His style is as a rebounder but also his versatility on offense, him being able to move the ball, get guys open and create for everybody and him just being so athletic makes it convenient to play on the run,” senior guard Brendan Adams said of Dean. “He’s a really versatile guy that helps us in many ways.”
Adams also saw the court for the first time this season after missing the exhibition game due to injury. In conjunction with Bishop, he was at the helm of the GW backcourt throughout the game. The senior guard finished with 15 points and a career high four 3-pointers.
With just two minutes to play in the first half, Adams knocked down a corner three to give GW their largest lead yet at 40-25. The Colonials would end the half with a trip to the line where Bishop uncharacteristically missed three straight free throws, resulting in a halftime score of 43-30. 
Early in the second half, the game would tighten to as little as eight points before a massive Colonial surge put the game well out of reach. After a foul was called under the basket on Virginia State junior forward Tremere Brown with 13 minutes to go, GW launched a 28-9 run that extended their lead to a game-high lead of 32 with four minutes to go.
Caputo attributed the second half surge to an increase in fast breaks and cohesion between his starting guards.
“I think we did a good job running right?” Caputo said. “And we took advantage of them there. I think anytime JB has the ball good things happen. And you just try to mix it up with him and Brendan.”
As the clock winded down, Virginia State kept up an aggressive offensive attack while Caputo cycled out his starters for reserve players. The colonials held the trojans at an arms length, holding the lead off their offensive run.
The Colonials stole the ball four times in the second half and scored 11 points off of offensive rebounds, reflecting an intense level of hustle.
“This group has been great, you know, super high care factor,” Caputo said. “Attentive, wants to be good, no issues, no attitudes, no selfishness. And they’re all trying to become good players and all want to win, which is really important.”
As the second half drew to a close, both teams found themselves in the foul bonus and took numerous trips to the line. The Colonials shot just 15 for 27 from the stripe, a far cry from their 81 percent success in the exhibition versus Western Connecticut State.
As Caputo’s inaugural season gets underway, his squad started with a decisive win at the Smith Center. The Colonials will host Howard Friday at 6 p.m.

I enjoyed the dish’s wide-ranging flavor profile as the seemingly traditional strawberry jam summoned hints of anise and fennel, giving the palate recess from a lineup of sweet ingredients.
Earlier this year, For Five Coffee’s Pennsylvania Avenue location opened just two blocks from its L Street cafe to the delight of lethargic GW attendees, who now must only walk a few feet off campus to get to the newest spot, which now boasts status as a GWorld vendor.
For Five’s menu is eclectic albeit rather expensive for a traditional coffee shop, though their delectable integration of salty and sweet flavors within daytime staples – like the 24-hour overnight oats covered by sundry toppings – allows for a well-justified splurge. The new spot on Pennsylvania Avenue serves as a gift for students looking to study somewhere more inviting than Gelman Library’s suffocating cubicles, elevated by the cafe’s natural lighting and raised ceilings which harbor the potential to alleviate momentary stress.
Although the shop’s wickered outdoor seating is limited and tucked beside a brazen Bank of America building, the interior offers a handful of scattered, sleek black tables accompanied by ample benches and chairs to provide a remote workspace utopia for passersby. The register sits by the entryway, separate from this seating area – customers must descend a small flight of stairs to reach the dine-in section of the establishment. Soft pop songs gently drift from the speakers as the day’s hours pass by – a relief for those who have been victimized by abrasive music in alleged “work-friendly” cafes.
The cafe offers a breakfast menu available from 7:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. alongside an overlapping lunch menu between the hours of 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. The establishment retains fame amongst steadfast customers for its halloumi-stuffed Manhasset breakfast sandwich ($16.95) and loaded salmon sriracha toast ($21.95) – a bastardized take on a traditional lox bagel. Served iced or hot and deliciously bitter, the cafe’s coffee drinks preserve consistency and tradition – simple espressos ($3.75), cappuccinos ($4.75) and lattes ($5.25) are readily available for sleep-deprived customers in need of caffeine.
Despite the normalcy of For Five’s drink menu, the chain bears a nuanced selection of cookies pictured vividly on a sidewalk sign outside the Pennsylvania Avenue location. The variation of possible flavor options ($5.50 each) – funfetti, s’mores, red velvet, strawberry cream and more – excite even the most reserved adults, drawn in by their placement under a warm-toned light at the front counter of the store.
The coffee shop boasts an extensive breakfast menu, but the 24-hour oatmeal caught my eye as something not traditionally served in a cafe. For Five serves prepackaged overnight oats in addition to a restaurant-curated bowl ($14.95) for those who choose to dine in – epitomizing true health among its alternatively indulgent menu items. The oats, soaked in a cinnamon and vanilla-infused pool of nondairy milk, sustain their chewy texture while melting on the tongue.
The 24-hour oatmeal is labeled as vegetarian as well as gluten and dairy free, but the hodgepodge of toppings includes an array of nuts and seeds to the dismay of those who may suffer from allergies. A heaping spoonful of silky cashew butter sits atop an array of tart berries, flax seeds, chia seeds and sugar-dusted walnuts smothered with natural honey.
I enjoyed the dish’s wide-ranging flavor profile as the seemingly traditional strawberry jam summoned hints of anise and fennel, giving the palate recess from a lineup of sweet ingredients. Though coffee shop overnight oats tend to retain a grainy texture, letting customers down after hasty quick-grab purchases, For Five’s interpretation of the essential breakfast dish is reliably hearty, rich and meticulously composed.
All in all, I appreciated the quirky take on overnight oatmeal and departed the contemporary cafe fueled by its nutrient-dense contents. Each ingredient, like the toasty sugar-caked nuts and fluffy cashew butter, evidently received special attention, culminating in a dish that feels made with love.
Everyone must find time to visit this coffee shop – whether it’s for a simple espresso drink or an American-sized portion of multifaceted cafe fare.

Between the Colonials and the Ramblers, only four shots were fired on the net, three for Loyola and one for GW. 
Men’s soccer was eliminated from the Atlantic 10 Championship Saturday by Loyola Chicago, marking the end of a hard-fought season.
The fifth-seed Colonials (8-8-2) fell 1–0 to the fourth-seed Ramblers (8-2-6), who were riding a six-game undefeated streak into the game and notched their only score off a corner kick in an otherwise-defensive deadlock. Following the conclusion of their A-10 season, senior midfielder Tom Cooklin and graduate forward Oscar Haynes Brown earned First and Second Team All-Conference honors Tuesday, respectively.
The Colonials managed just under a .500 winning percentage in this season, with four of their eight losses decided by only one point.
The Colonials won three of their last four conference games heading into the playoffs looking for a rematch victory against the Ramblers, who bested them 4–0 in their September contest. The game marked GW’s first A-10 Conference tournament appearance since the 2020 season, where they competed for a conference title. 
The Colonials ran a 4-5-1 formation, allowing them to go toe-to-toe with the Ramblers as both teams battled for possession of the ball. The Ramblers took four shots on goal in the first 23 minutes of the game, all caught or deflected by senior goalkeeper Justin Grady to hold the Ramblers scoreless. 
In the 19th minute, an attack led by junior midfielder Elias Norris ended up at the feet of Cooklin. The wind hoisted Cooklin’s kick nearly under the top bar of the goalpost, but Loyola goalkeeper Simon Jillson stopped the ball from entering the net.
Six minutes later, the Ramblers took a shot on the goal, which Grady went for, but the ball deflected into the feet of Rambler midfielder Oscar Dueso. Dueso powerfully buried it into the back of the net, and the Colonials went down 1-0 with just under 18 minutes left in the half.
Right after the goal, Haynes Brown took a shot that went over the bar of the goal. The Colonials were forced to go on the defensive in the last 10 minutes of the half when the Ramblers took three corner kicks and a shot on the goal.
The Ramblers took three shots in the first 10 minutes to kick off the second half with a quick start, but none reached the net. With 20 minutes to go, the Colonials started taking chances but couldn’t get anything on target. 
With three minutes left in the game, the Ramblers played with one less man after graduate forward Fabian Becerra of Loyola received a red card following his second yellow card. The Colonials were unable to capitalize on the Rambler’s mistake as the game and their season came to a close. 
The game finished with a 1-0 Rambler victory – the fifth shutout the Colonials have suffered this season.
The Colonials managed only four shots on goal through the bout, not enough to match the Rambler’s 14 shots. Between the Colonials and the Ramblers, only four shots were fired on the net, three for Loyola and one for GW. 
Cooklin led the offensive push for the Colonials in their sole playoff game, firing two of their four shots on goals after setting the team-high in points through the regular season with a total of 19. Haynes Brown and freshman forward Alex Nicholson got off one shot each. 
Grady allowed only one goal and saved two shots throughout the game. He finishes the season with a .706 save percentage and 60 saves total.
Cooklin managed three goals and 13 assists this season, the latter of which led the A-10 and was good for the second highest in the NCAA. His career-total 22 assists are good for the fourth most in program history. 
Haynes Brown’s seven goals this season bring his career total to 38, which places him at fourth in program history. This is his second Second Team All-Conference honor of his career.

Last summer, Mayor Muriel Bowser’s administration offered residents of the city’s four largest homeless encampments one-year leases to move to transitional and ultimately permanent housing in a “housing-first” approach. The city successfully housed 100 of the encampments’ 139 eligible residents under the Coordinated Assistance and Resources for Encampments, or CARE, pilot program. But to paraphrase GW alumnus and Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner Yannik Omictin, you can’t just give somebody housing. It takes more than a home to ensure someone is housed. 
While Bowser’s initiatives to address homelessness may connect members of the District’s unhoused population with forms of temporary housing, these programs fail to target underlying factors like skyrocketing real estate costs, high addiction rates and complex mental health issues that force unhoused people back onto the streets just months into their subsidized leases. Bowser should be held accountable for breaking her promise to end family homelessness by 2018, but she just won her third term as mayor Tuesday. It is unjust for the local government to treat our unhoused neighbors as second-class citizens as they neighbor the vast wealth concentrated on GW’s campus.
Unlike CARE’s focus on short-term leases and transitional housing, D.C.’s more regular and less publicized encampment clearings force unhoused people to pick up and leave, shuffling around the city with their belongings. A Washington Post map of encampment engagements – when the city removes waste from, deep cleans or shuts down an encampment – shows a dense group of dots concentrated around Foggy Bottom in D.C. from 2015 to 2022. But as abstract as these dots are, they represent real people living among GW’s campus. 
In the frequently literal push to move unhoused people from encampments to temporary housing, a bulldozer struck a man in a tent in NoMa in a October 2021 encampment engagement. In the event of a sudden encampment closure, case workers have been said to lose residents’ birth certificates or fear their clients’ disappearance. And when officials do close down an encampment in one part of the city, the experience of finding shelter elsewhere can be traumatic. The Office of the Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services closed seven encampments this summer without any promise of vouchers for encampment residents, leaving unhoused individuals completely on their own to find housing. 
While CARE may offer more direct assistance than direct encampment engagements, it’s also setting up unhoused people for failure. The idea of temporary or transitional housing assumes residents can begin paying their full rent typically within a year of their leases. Bowser’s use of rapid rehousing quickly mandates economic self-sufficiency for homeless residents climbing out of abject poverty. But without a steady source of income – something that substance abuse and mental illness can make harder to obtain – newly housed residents can end back up on the street. And while DC’s Department of Human Services increased and extended the subsidies offered to participants in rapid rehousing during the pandemic, that program has quickly expired. The dire needs of its recipients are not going anywhere, and evictions will continue to spike in the COVID-19 pandemic’s wake. 
D.C. needs more healthcare professionals and social workers to help unhoused Washingtonians obtain not just a home but the tools, resources and support they need so that they can continue to be housed. The city should not expect unhoused people to pull themselves up by their bootstraps since they only have guaranteed shelter for a few months or a year. Meeting unhoused people where they are, whether in transitional housing or in an encampment, is essential to truly helping them.
And now that Bowser has been elected as mayor again, D.C. residents need to keep her accountable to her latest promise to truly end all homelessness by 2025. This issue needs to remain in the public eye through initiatives like Street Sense’s Homeless Crisis Reporting Project. And District residents who are housed should adopt their unhoused neighbors’ most pressing concerns as if they were their own. Homelessness should become D.C.’s political priority heading into 2023 – whether housed or unhoused, the city can’t progress by leaving part of its population behind.
D.C. cannot ensure that rapid rehousing programs address homelessness at its roots without an understanding of the complex reasons for why people are unhoused. This city’s residents are not homeless by choice – they are the mailman who got laid off last spring, a recent grad between jobs or parents who spent their last paychecks on their child’s needs. By acknowledging that it takes more than housing to address homelessness, Bowser can pair long-term support with immediate shelter to aid unhoused Washingtonians.

I woke up Tuesday with a queasy feeling in my stomach and a mental list running through my head of everything I needed to do – including fighting for my basic rights. As a queer person with a uterus, my anxiety was at an all-time high thinking that people could ever vote against my existence as a human. Over the course of the past two years, blatantly homophobic politicians like Ron DeSantis, the Republican governor of Florida, and questions over the constitutionality of abortion somehow made their way onto the 2022 midterm election ballot. Not knowing whether my rights to bodily autonomy or to exist as a queer person would be intact when I woke up after Election Day left me physically and emotionally drained.
In March, DeSantis – who was reelected by a margin of nearly 20 points Tuesday night – signed the “Don’t Say Gay Bill” into state law. Florida and five other states prohibit the discussion of sexuality and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade. I often think about how meaningful it would have been for the younger version of myself to see or know a non-binary person – I didn’t even know about transgender people until the age of 15.
Outlawing conversations about sexuality and gender identity means children fail to learn about labels they could possibly identify with, and others could remain ignorant and disrespectful to my existence. I often exist in spaces where I am the only non-binary person, and I’m forced to explain my gender identity to those who don’t understand and correct people when they misgender me. Sometimes I get called a “they/them” or “girl” despite explaining over and over again that they/them are just my pronouns and I am non-binary. If education existed at a younger age about the LGBTQ+ community, more people would grow up to understand the correct language for respecting and talking about me.
Prohibiting the discussion of queer people is also inherently homophobic because it implies there is something inappropriate about our existence. Due to how taboo discussions surrounding the LGBTQ+ community are, it took me a long time to not be ashamed of my queerness. And no one – especially government officials – should tell a child that their sexuality and gender identity is too inappropriate to discuss. All children deserve a safe place to explore who they are and receive support and celebration for simply being a human.
My heart sank when I saw the votes for DeSantis come in until he secured his reelection, and some news outlets even predict he will run for president. The thought of a DeSantis presidency makes me panic – U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thomas Clarence has already signaled his willingness to reconsider gay rights, setting the stage for politicians to outlaw my right to marry who I love.
When the Supreme Court’s conservative majority overturned Roe v. Wade in June, a pit grew in my stomach similar to the one on Election Day and when DeSantis codified the “Don’t Say Gay” bill. Four cisgender men and one cisgender woman overturned my right to an abortion despite the fact that more than 60 percent of the United States population supports legalizing abortion in all or most cases in 2022.
Reproductive justice remains at the forefront of my concerns after the Supreme Court’s conservative majority decision. I already struggle to access adequate health care as a genderqueer person, and ripping my right to an abortion away only exacerbates that struggle. While I never needed an abortion in the past, people who can get pregnant share that abortions saved their lives, and I cannot guarantee that I won’t need one in the future. Access to abortions is essential, life saving and necessary, so I remain deeply concerned for my life, the lives of many people who I love and every other person that could need an abortion.
I voted “Yes” on Proposition 1 to amend the California constitution to include the right to abortion, which passed with overwhelming support. In Vermont and Michigan, voters amended their state constitutions as well to protect people’s reproductive freedom while Kentucky voters rejected a ballot measure aimed at denying any constitutional protections for abortion.
Thankfully, some election results caused happy tears and not sad ones. Maura Healey, a Democrat, became the first openly out lesbian governor in the United States after winning her race for governor of Massachusetts. As a queer person who was socialized as a woman and is entering the world of politics, Healey represents everything I ever want to accomplish – creating change while embracing my queerness, not as my entire identity but as a means to stand up for others and also be proud.
James Roesener, a Democrat running for office in New Hampshire, also became the first ever transgender man elected to a United States state legislature in history, showing the transgender community that they are able to lead our country despite running alongside transphobes. As a genderqueer politician who is affected by abortion access, I see a lot of myself in Roesener and feel safe knowing that he will fight to protect the rights of people that are queer and can get pregnant.
The feeling of immense fear as my rights lie in the hands of people who will never understand my existence is inherent to who I am, but the culmination of Election Day truly exacerbates those feelings to a level of gut-wrenching anxiety. Respect for my sexuality, gender identity and own body is the bare minimum, and to watch them debated on a national level is exhausting beyond anything I have ever experienced. While I’m ecstatic to see openly lesbian women and transgender men trailblazing what will hopefully be my own path into politics, I am scared of the threat that people like DeSantis pose to my ability to live as myself.
