Led by senior guard James Bishop IV, the Colonials rained a barrage of 3-pointers down on the Gamecocks, five of which came from the slithery southpaw who finished the game with 24 points.
Men’s basketball trounced the South Carolina Gamecocks 79-55 in a nationally televised showdown at the Smith Center Wednesday night – the team’s first win against a Power 5 opponent since 2016.
Led by senior guard James Bishop IV, the Colonials rained a barrage of 3-pointers down on the Gamecocks, five of which came from the slithery southpaw who finished the game with 24 points. On the other end of the floor, GW’s defense was tenacious, allowing only 22 South Carolina points in the paint and 55 points in total on the night.
In a post-game interview, Head Coach Chris Caputo said the team’s elevated effort and energy, particularly on the defensive end, translated to the Colonials’ success in the blowout victory.
“The message today was we’re going to start with maximum effort to start the game, and I thought we did,” Caputo said. 
A total of 2,216 fans packed the Smith Center, the second-highest attendance of the year behind the Colonials’ matchup against Howard in early November. And the fans weren’t the only notable attendees – at least 10 scouts from eight NBA teams were in the stands for the game, according to a GW Athletics attendance sheet.
Before tipoff, Caputo presented Bishop with a commemorative ball, celebrating the veteran guard’s 1000th career point for GW, a feat he achieved against New Hampshire last week. 
After a pre-game hype video and the announcement of the starting lineups got the Smith Center rocking, senior forward Hunter Dean slammed home a monstrous dunk to put GW on the board first just 32 seconds into the game, and the Buff and Blue never looked back.
Thanks to the Dean dunk that ignited the already-buzzing crowd, it didn’t take long for Bishop to start heating up. His first shot of the game came in the form of a right-wing 3-pointer off an assist from graduate student guard E.J. Clark, which he followed up with a deep three from the top of the key, courtesy of a Dean offensive board, to give GW a 15-7 lead nine minutes into the game. 
The pair of threes from Bishop sparked a 12-0 GW run, tied for their longest of the game, which included a 3-pointer from graduate student guard Brendan Adams that sent the crowd into a frenzy and put the score at 27-10.
In a highlight reel play during their run that epitomized the Colonials’ night, senior forward Ricky Lindo Jr. careened across the court to track down a tipped offensive rebound that he managed to shovel to Bishop. The 6-foot-2 point guard gathered, weaved his way past two South Carolina defenders and banked in a tough layup high off the glass plus the foul.
GW’s defense commanded the first half, holding South Carolina’s offense to 20 points. Five-star freshman forward GG Jackson II – who was met with chants of “overrated” from the crowd all game – could only muster two points on eight shot attempts. The Gamecocks’ 20 first-half points are the fewest GW has allowed in a half all year, according to GW’s media kit.  
Jackson, the highest-rated recruit in South Carolina’s history, made just four of his 17 shot attempts, and his 11 points accounted for his lowest total of the season.
Thanks to their stingy defense and 15 points from Bishop, the Colonials entered the locker room at the half with a comfortable 40-20 lead.
The lead may have been comfortable, but GW still came roaring out of the gates in the second half with a sense of urgency. 3-pointers from Lindo and Adams, a layup from Dean and two Lindo free throws composed a 10-0 GW run. The scoring streak stretched to 12 when Lindo uncorked a vicious dunk off a James Bishop assist, giving GW a 55-23 lead with 15:54 left in the half and sending the Smith Center into pandemonium.
Throughout the night, Lindo dictated the terms of the game, knocking down six of his eight shot attempts, grabbing six boards and stoutly defending South Carolina’s Jackson, a 17-year-old recruit already carrying a heavy load for the Gamecocks. 
Lindo said beating a Power 5 team in the Smith Center in front of such a raucous crowd was especially meaningful for himself and Bishop as senior leaders on the team. 
“It was big for us, not just for the school, but just for ourselves,” Lindo said. “Me and JB have probably been here the longest, and it was just big for ourselves.”
The Gamecocks were the first Power 5 school to visit the Smith Center since 2017, when the sixth-ranked Miami Hurricanes arrived in D.C. to beat the Colonials 59-50. 
In fitting fashion, Bishop put the last exclamation point on the Colonials’ incredible night. His fifth and final 3-pointer, a flailing heave from the left wing that kissed off the glass and nestled in the bottom of the net, capped off a statement win for GW. 
South Carolina Head Coach Lamont Paris lamented the loss, saying the Colonials simply outcompeted South Carolina’s young team.
“They were more competitive than us, and I don’t have a magic play for that,” he told The State, a South Carolina-based newspaper. “We got our butts kicked.”
At the end of the day, Caputo said he wants to thank the students who showed up to the game and brought passionate energy.
“It certainly felt like, particularly, the student section was incredible, and it gives you a chance to build a great program when you have that type of support,” he said.
The Buff and Blue will travel to Virginia Sunday to challenge Radford. Tip-off is at 2 p.m.

The University was ranked first among medium-sized institutions for its number of Gilman Scholars.
The Gilman International Scholarship Program recognized GW as a top producer of Gilman Scholars in a release last month.
The Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship program provides up to $5,000 in funding for Pell Grant recipients to study and intern abroad for those who might not otherwise be able to attend. For its 20th anniversary, the program recognized the top 20 schools sending the most students abroad across small, medium, large and minority-serving institutions.
“These institutions were recognized for their support of equity, diversity and accessibility in study abroad for American students through the Gilman Program,” the release states.
The University was ranked first among medium-sized institutions. The Office for Study Abroad sent 15 students abroad through the Gilman Scholarship Program in 2021 and more than 200 students since the program began in 2001.
“These recognitions reflect the University’s mission of creating global citizens and its commitment to improving access to study abroad so all GW students can have the opportunity to immerse themselves in different cultures and educational experiences,” Assistant Provost of International Education Jennifer Donaghue said.
Officials from the Office for Study Abroad said an increase in study abroad participation before the pandemic and increased promotion through information sessions and University-sponsored support and outreach programs caused the University to increase its production of Gilman Scholars.
Kimberly Rush, the manager of advising services at Office for Study Abroad, and Donaghue said in a joint email that the office’s essay workshops, alumni events and promotional content drew interested applicants.
“Our status as a top producer of Gilman Scholars, we believe, is largely a result of both the hard work and dedication of GW students in submitting competitive application essays as well as our office’s resources, support and outreach for the program with the help of campus partners like the University Writing Center,” they said.

A Palestine Legal release states GW charged SJP and its president with a student conduct violation “for misconduct related to property” for their protest outside a speaker event with Doron Tenne, a former IDF intelligence officer, at the GW Hillel building.
Students for Justice in Palestine is facing disciplinary charges from GW in connection to a protest outside the GW Hillel building in October against a speaker who formerly worked for the Israeli Defense Forces, according to a Palestine rights advocacy rights group.
Palestine Legal – the Palestine rights advocacy group representing SJP in its disciplinary case – stated in a release Tuesday that a student conduct hearing Friday could sanction SJP’s president with disciplinary probation and censure or limit the “privileges” of the entire student organization. The release states GW launched an investigation into SJP after students gathered outside the GW Hillel building in October to protest Doron Tenne, a former IDF intelligence officer who was speaking at an event hosted by GW for Israel and GW Mishelanu, an organization dedicated to Israeli American heritage.
GW charged the president and the student organization with a student conduct violation “for misconduct related to property,” according to the release. A video posted online following the protest showed about 15 students demonstrating outside the Hillel building holding signs that read statements like “War criminals GTFO.” 
Before the October protest, SJP led a postering campaign to demonstrate student support for Palestinian rights and pasted messages around campus like “Decolonize Palestine” and “GW for a Free Palestine” – actions which remained in compliance with the University’s “freedom of expression” policies, according to the release. The release states the University’s “continued repression of student expression in support of Palestinian rights” breaks its political expression policy, which outlines GW’s commitment to free speech, assembly and protest.
“SJP followed all the rules around postering and directed their members and allies to do the same,” Palestine Legal attorney Dylan Saba said in the release. “But GW is selectively targeting this group for punishment, when there is zero evidence of any wrongdoing. This looks like racist, anti-Palestinian profiling and the law does not support it.”
University spokesperson Julia Metjian said when the University receives reports of student activity that may violate GW policy, University officials respond in accordance with the GW Code of Student Conduct and applicable University policies and procedures. She declined to comment on disciplinary proceedings. 
“The University continues to support the right of all members of the University community to engage in debate and discussion, as well as protest, in accordance with University policies,” Metjian said in an email.
SJP defended their decision to protest in a statement they released after the demonstration, “wholeheartedly” condemning the event with Tenne.
GW Hillel and GW for Israel also released statements saying Jewish students felt targeted by the protest, and GW for Israel called the protest a display of “antisemitism.” GW Hillel said they were “deeply troubled” by posters condemning Zionism prior to the protest, including one that stated, “Zionists f*** off.” 
Interim University President Mark Wrighton released a statement that said officials heard that Jewish community members felt the October protest was directed toward them.
The statements from GW Hillel and Wrighton did not include context about the speaker event featuring the former IDF official, which organizers said was the sole reason behind the protest.
Jewish Voice for Peace said in a statement in October that GW Hillel and GW for Israel mischaracterized the protest when they claimed the protests were targeted at GW’s Jewish population instead of just Tenne. The Palestine Legal release states that Israel advocacy organizations and media outlets “smeared” protesters supporting Palestinian rights online, with one site allegedly calling on its following of 60,000 people to dox the students by publicly posting their personal information. 
Palestine Legal filed a civil rights complaint with DC Office of Human Rights against the University last November, alleging that the University had discriminated against its Palestinian students by being “selective” in its trauma service offerings. Palestine Legal says the DC OHR has charged the University with national origin discrimination but that the investigation is still ongoing.

Students said despite tuning in while some advocates call for boycotting the tournament, the human rights issues hanging over the World Cup have tarnished their experiences celebrating the sport they love.
The decision to hold the 2022 World Cup in Qatar has ignited criticism for more than a decade, and for many students at GW, this choice has sullied what is usually a “magical” tournament.
After FIFA selected Qatar in 2010 as the host country of the World Cup – a soccer tournament between 32 qualifying national teams who square off every four years – instances of bribery tied to the hosting bid and human rights violations involving stadium construction have risen to the forefront of global attention surrounding the competition. Students who are long-time soccer fans said tragedies tied to this year’s World Cup, like the deaths of thousands of migrant workers building the stadiums in Qatar, create moral dilemmas for those rooting for their teams while standing against these human rights violations.
The Department of Justice found that the Qatari government bribed FIFA officials to secure Qatar as the host country before their vote to make the hosting decision in 2010. Qatar has relied on migrant labor to build seven new stadiums among other construction projects for the tournament, worth nearly $6.5 billion altogether, to prepare the country for the flood of fans.
Investigations from human rights organizations and news outlets like the Guardian show that more than 6,500 migrant workers have died building the stadiums as a result of dangerous and exploitative working conditions the Qatari government instituted in hopes of rushing the construction of the infrastructure and saving money with unfair wages – a continuation of the Qatari government’s human rights violations that students said “blemish” international soccer. The country also criminalizes homosexuality and sex outside of marriage, which students said has further dashed their respect for the 2022 World Cup because of the discriminatory values of its host and central symbol.
Senior Oscar Southwell, who moved to the U.S. from London when he was seven and plays right wing and attacking midfielder for the men’s club soccer team, said the Qatari government strained its labor force through “terrible working conditions,” which taint this year’s competition. Southwell said while he considered boycotting the tournament, his desire to support his home country of England and his anticipation to see each country’s culture reflected through their individualized style of play motivated him to tune into the tournament this year.
“I think it’s really shameful from FIFA, in terms of the lack of recognition from FIFA and from the Qatari government of the unacceptable sacrifices they made,” Southwell said.
For many avid fans, soccer is more than just a game. The sport offers a chance to connect with their families and cultures around the world, and the World Cup – which kicked off last Sunday and runs through Dec. 18 – represents a time for nations to showcase their top athletes. But 10 students who consider soccer a core part of their identity said despite tuning in while some advocates call for boycotts, the human rights issues hanging over the World Cup have tarnished their experiences celebrating the sport they love.
Senior Nick Porr – who co-hosts a WRGW show dubbed “3 At The Back,” which covers international soccer – said Qatar’s call to suppress public displays of affection between LGBTQ+ fans and visitors is “abhorrent.” He said the bribery and migrant deaths surrounding this year’s World Cup “taints the entire experience” of watching the tournament.
“This is an event that’s supposed to be a celebration of international culture and just everyone coming together and playing soccer,” Porr said. “It’s horrible.”
Players have attempted to engage in small acts of protest against FIFA’s corruption and Qatar’s oppressive practices, but FIFA threatened punishment for any teams that planned to take part. The English, Welsh and Netherlandish national teams planned to wear armbands in support of the “One Love” campaign, an effort to promote LGBTQ+ equality, but FIFA warned they would immediately receive yellow cards.
Freshman Kalea Wilson, who plays center back for the men’s club soccer team, said acts of suppression against protests made him “lose respect” for FIFA. He said soccer games have historically been a platform for similar activism, like the Premier League players’ “Rainbow Laces” campaign for LGBTQ+ rights.
“A big part of soccer, in general, is equality, and to host in a country where people of certain groups such as the LGBT cannot go, that’s against the nature of sports,” Wilson said.
Wilson said as he’s watching the games he can’t ignore the games have been “built on the backs of people that died for a sports tournament.”
“You’re thinking about the game, you’re loving the players, the football but then in the background the whole time you’re thinking ‘What is all this for? Who died for this World Cup? What does this say for sporting integrity in the future when atrocities like this can happen?’” Wilson said.
Freshman Mo Hammadi, who plays center midfield for the men’s club soccer team, said while the controversies dampen fans’ moods directed toward the World Cup, the tournament provides hope and comfort for viewers around the world.
“Many people in the world don’t have many blessings, and they don’t have many things to look forward to – but soccer gives them joy and gives them hope,” Hammadi said.
Freshman Seowon Kim, who is originally from Seoul, South Korea and is rooting for the Korean national team, said although he doesn’t support Qatari actions, it is “touching” for him to watch his team play because he has been following their journey since childhood. Kim said for many international students, the ability to support their national team during the World Cup helps them stay connected to their home countries.
“The match time is the only time you’re free from homesickness,” Kim said. “That’s one power that the World Cup has.”
For fans of the U.S. team who are electing to continue watching the tournament, this World Cup is particularly special, because it marks the first time the U.S. will compete in eight years. Analysts attribute the U.S.’s traditional lack of competitive force in international soccer to coaching issues, insufficient player investment and systemic flaws, like a lack of a well-organized youth system within the national organizations devoted to developing the sport.
But senior David Korn, the sports director at WRGW and co-host of the sports talk show “3 At The Back,” said fans are excited to watch this year’s U.S. matches because the team has moved up in standing on the world stage in recent years. He said this competition distinguishes the first time in history when the U.S. national team’s “most important players,” like Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Tyler Adams and Gio Reyna, will play together in full health.
“The fact that we’re going to be seeing that for the first time in the World Cup is really exciting because this team’s full potential has really never been reached,” Korn said. “It’s cool to see how they’ll mesh together on the world’s biggest stage.”
Freshman Marc-Andre Berthin said despite the excitement surrounding the U.S. team, the Qatari government’s bribery and human rights abuses are “tragic” and “plague” this year’s tournament. But he said the rise in media attention toward these issues creates a “global” opportunity for advocates and fans to advance positive change for future World Cups.
“Hopefully the next World Cup will be like World Cups in the past where everyone can really come together,” Berthin said. “No matter who we are, no matter where we’re from, no matter what we identify with, we can just come together and have fun and enjoy the sport we love.”

Netflix bought the rights to two “Knives Out” sequels including “Glass Onion,” which is showing in limited theaters before releasing on Netflix in late December.
As the highly anticipated sequel to murder mystery “Knives Out,” the star-studded whodunit “Glass Onion” delivers a twisty mystery that lives up to half its title – expertly layered but never translucent.
Director Rian Johnson presents a series of deadly riddles that serve as a cunning commentary on wealth and power to piece together a cinematic puzzle consisting of class privilege and the “American dream” in true “Knives Out” fashion. Lively filmmaking and strategic editing, which leaps between arguments and plot twists, match the quick pace of the picture as part of a sly and humorous display of this dramatic thriller.
“Glass Onion” comes as the first of two Netflix sequels to “Knives Out,” featuring a completely new slate of cast members save Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig), the whimsical and witty gentleman sleuth who solved the “doughnut hole” murder mystery in the original. The movie came out last week in limited theaters and will release on Netflix in late December.
A private Greek island owned by Miles Bron (Edward Norton), an Elon Musk-esque tech billionaire, anchors the action of the film. Like any whodunit, the plot revolves around a core of Bron’s caricature-like friends whom he invites to his island, including the liberal wine mom governor of Connecticut (Kathryn Hahn), the “men’s rights” gaming streamer (Dave Bautista), the former model under constant media scrutiny (Kate Hudson) and the scientist on the verge of a major breakthrough (Leslie Odom Jr.). The oddballs are all members of a troupe that calls itself “The Disruptors,” hinting toward their desire to interrupt society through their own professions.
Blanc’s appearance is curious in and of itself – he didn’t know Bron before he received the invitation, and his arrival comes as a surprise to every other guest. The introduction of Cassandra “Andi” Brand (Janelle Monáe), Bron’s former business partner who was booted from their company in a controversial business move, catalyzes drama between guests.
With arguments spurring and drinks being poured, tensions begin to rise when irregular Google alert pings and slamming door thuds build a sense of tension and unease around the oblivious characters as the music stiffens and the camera shots tighten. With the mounting suspense, it’s not long before someone on the island turns up dead.
While most movies released over the past few years work to ignore COVID-19 at any cost, “Glass Onion” is an unapologetic period piece set during the height of the pandemic in 2020. Instead of corsets or historical dresses, face masks are the film’s period clothing. Between dreaded Zoom meetings, gubernatorial TV interviews from the living room and Among Us games from the bathtub, the movie’s portrayal of the boredom of May 2020 ushers in the much-needed getaway weekend in Greece.
The film takes full advantage of its location on the breezy Greek island (just look as far as Craig’s killer blue and white striped poolside outfit) – bright blue skies and warm settings establish the perfect location for the contrast of a dark murder. Johnson’s care for detail in his directing shines through in this movie with tactics like a mimicking of classic celluloid film in one of the most beautiful films I’ve seen in a theater. The movie’s at-times suspenseful and at-times bubbly score, supplemented with Beatles and Bee Gees and David Bowie songs, feeds into the senses of doom and cheer defining the film.
Johnson set the bar high with “Knives Out” with solid performances from Ana de Armas, Chris Evans and Daniel Craig as part of a witty midbudget film genre that has otherwise failed at the box office since the proliferation of the franchise megablockbuster. The subversion of the detective genre, typically marked by worn-out cliches and tropes of the centuries-old genre, is crucial in “Glass Onion.”
Rest assured, you will leave the theater having watched a vastly different movie than expected.
A set of brilliant lead performances from Norton, Craig and Monáe drives the movie forward. Craig’s priceless “Kentucky-fried Foghorn Leghorn drawl” crowns him the master of the one-liner – “You vainglorious buffoon!”, “You dimwitted, brainless, jackass!”, “I am not Batman” – and his poise and intelligence are central to the film.
Monáe walks away the big winner performance-wise – her wildly dynamic portrayal of Andi ties the film’s mysteries together in more ways than one, and she juggles the challenging role with ease. Monáe adeptly tunes into a sense of revenge – not just toward Bron, who kicked her from their company, but toward her former friends who doubted her character and betrayed her during a very-public trial regarding her role in the company.
The movie is obviously not perfect. The surrounding cast of characters feels shallow — their backstories needed to be fleshed out further and the social power dynamics within the group were, at times, unclear. After “Knives Out” — when the interactions and tension between family members was instantly understandable and, to a certain extent, relatable — a group of secondary characters with unclear motives and interactions was disappointing.
Much like the first film of the series, “Glass Onion” is a pointed critique of the vapid culture of the über-rich. Bron awkwardly name-drops real-life celebrities he’s befriended, sharing Jared Leto’s kombucha and Jeremy Renner’s hot sauce with his guests. Bron obsesses over the Mona Lisa – he rents the art for his home while the Louvre is closed for COVID while praying that his life’s work will be comparable to the fame the artwork has earned. Even Bron’s guests admit to disliking Bron, simply pandering to keep suckling his economic teat.
The film gains thematic relevance as Elon Musk gains cultural relevance – in fact, it feels nearly prophetic. Bron works hard to maintain an aura of intelligence and prestige while touting products potentially failing expectations. But in reality, he’s a dunce simply profiting from well-timed maneuvers and claiming the intellect of others.
It’s those dynamics – monied interests versus the opportunistic, those with nothing to lose versus those with everything to lose – that keep the engine of the film running. The theme isn’t a radical one, but “Glass Onion” builds off the momentum of “Knives Out” to spin an entertaining tale.

SBA Sen. John Tuley proposed an amendment to guarantee that submissions to the Finance Committee are still sent to the vice president of finance prior to senate meetings for the sake of clear communication.
The Student Bar Association Senate Tuesday unanimously approved a bill internally clarifying and simplifying the rules regulating the process of submitting, preparing and presenting legislation to the senate.
The Clarifying Legislative Procedural Rules Act drops the requirement for executive officers who are otherwise unaffiliated with the senate to be included in email communications relating to legislation in order to avoid burdening certain officers with extra work. SBA Sen. Evan Barber said he hopes the act will reduce the amount of unnecessary information executive officers receive from senators.
SBA Sen. John Tuley proposed an amendment to guarantee that submissions to the Finance Committee are still sent to the vice president of finance prior to senate meetings for the sake of clear communication.
“With our finances having been and maybe still kind of being in disarray, I think it’s probably better administratively to require him to know about that,” he said.
The SBA Senate unanimously approved $335 to be disbursed from the ad hoc fund to the GW Jewish Law Students Association to cover the cost of hosting Shabbat dinner and GW JLSA President Baila Haim’s hotel stay the night after the dinner so she did not have to commute from Silver Spring. Tuley said the JLSA already requested funding for Shabbat dinners during the SBA’s initial budget allotments, but the price of Kosher food has since increased, necessitating extra funding.
The majority of the budget, $190, covered housing for Haim and her family in a hotel from Friday to Saturday because Haim is shomer Shabbat and observes the practice that prohibits some Jewish people from driving between Friday at sundown and Saturday at sundown. She and her family stayed in a hotel overnight to ensure she would be able to attend Shabbat dinner without having to travel home to Silver Spring afterwards.
“I’m the president, and it was imperative for me to be there,” Haim said. “We’re just asking for a little bit of extra money to offset that cost.”
The SBA Senate also unanimously approved the distribution of $872 to cover the cost for second-year law student Hannah Scionti to attend the Tulane Women in Sports Law Symposium in New Orleans in late January. Scionti said Tulane Law School is a top school for sports law, and she hopes the symposium will give her the opportunity to network with professionals in the field of sports law.
“Last year’s conference saw more than 30 law schools represented, so I think it would be awesome to have GW Law represented,” Scionti said.
SBA President Nicole Karem said she met with a GW administrator regarding on-campus graduate student housing but found there is “no plan for the foreseeable future” to reinstate on-campus graduate student housing. SBA Sen. Cody Ingraham said he has written three resolutions over the last year throughout the SBA and the Student Association attempting to reinstate graduate student housing, to no avail.
The University converted the Aston, which used to house graduate students, into housing for undergraduate upperclassmen in 2019. SA Senators once again called for on-campus housing for graduate students this summer after officials announced plans to sell the Aston.
“It was a great benefit, and we’re trying to talk the University into caring about grad students again,” Ingraham said.
The next SBA Senate meeting will be held Jan. 9, 2023 at 9:15 p.m. in the Law Learning Center.

WMATA officials will continue normal operating hours from 7 to 1 a.m. on Saturday and 7 a.m. to midnight on Sunday.
The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority announced scheduled maintenance, increasing wait times on all lines this weekend.
Metro officials announced all three lines available at the Foggy Bottom station, the Silver, Orange and Blue lines, will run every 24 minutes from Dec. 3 to Dec. 4, up from the normal service times of trains every 15 minutes. The scheduled updates on all three lines are a part of The Aerial Structures Rehabilitation Project, which seeks to reinforce the “structural integrity” of Metro’s bridges and aerial structures by the winter of 2023.
“The Aerial Structures Rehabilitation Project will continue concrete repairs, weatherproof coating application and joint replacement on structures through 2023,” Metro’s website states.
WMATA officials will continue normal operating hours from 7 to 1 a.m. on Saturday and 7 a.m. to midnight on Sunday.
The release states that the Red line trains will run every 10 minutes between Shady Grove and Twinbrook, and Medical Center and Glenmont, with closures at the North Bethesda and Grosvenor-Strathmore stations.
The Yellow line will remain closed through May 2023, while the Blue and Green lines will run between Huntington and Reagan National Airport, and Branch Ave and Greenbelt with additional trains, respectively.
Green line trains will run every eight minutes between Branch and Georgia Ave., and every 16 minutes between Branch Ave and Greenbelt.
Officials greenlit WMATA to reintroduce all the 7000-series trains last month after Metro removed its 7000-series trains for safety inspections following a derailment on the Blue line last year.
“The Metrorail system includes nearly 20 miles of tracks atop large above-ground aerial structures,” Metro’s website states. “These structures allow trains to pass over traffic and various types of terrain. Now almost 45 years old, many structures are showing signs of routine aging due to exposure to the elements and supporting Metrorail trains.”

The ratio of fish to rice allowed for a harmonious balance of rich flavors in each bite all the way through to the ever-disappointing-yet-satisfying end of my meal.
Abunai – a poke haven for overtired employees and nearby students – may sit among the deep line of bleak L Street office buildings but its fresh Hawaiian cuisine delivers a rare gem to the heart of the District.
Since founder and Hawaiian native Akina Harada established Abunai as a food truck in 2016, the business has flourished into a restaurant with locations in Philadelphia and downtown D.C. Harada created a menu that remains loyal to the simplicity of Hawaiian poke with signature ingredients, like fresh pineapple and sushi-grade tuna, despite the American pressure for more mass-produced, inauthentic exorbitant cuisine.
The restaurant’s mission does not solely focus on culinary authenticity – Abunai also works to reduce its carbon footprint by using locally sourced ingredients and eco-friendly packaging.
Though the restaurant’s outdoor surroundings are drab and nondescript, its glitzy light display will draw in any curious passerby. Artificial vines dangle across the windows among color-shifting bulbs set to flash by the second. Two tall tables stand in the minimalist indoor space, yet Abunai’s otherwise out-of-place decor – sports gambling kiosks and news-projecting televisions – makes for an interactive dining environment.
Abunai poses a rare conglomeration of authentic dishes and ingredients to customers unlike Americanized poke restaurants that often mimic one another like a chain of dominoes. Their options include a spicy Maine lobster salad ($20.40) and an octopus-based “tako” poke bowl ($18) as well as hand rolls ($7.20 to $9.60) and spam musubi ($9.60) – a traditional Japanese dish. For those looking for larger portions, Abunai serves plates including Japanese curry ($13.00) and Kalua pig & cabbage ($15.60) to broaden their versatility as a specialized restaurant.
Take advantage of the Hawaiian joint’s generous specials deal – $12 for their designated daily poke bowl – from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. on weekdays.
I ordered the Abunai bowl ($15), in its purest state without substitutions, to sample the restaurant’s signature dish. Despite my preference for salmon poke, which Abunai also offers, I enjoyed the roughly chopped tuna accompanied by peanuts, scallions, sweet onions, masago, nori and ogo Hawaiian seaweed. The Abunai sauce – similar to the consistency of the traditional Ponzu sauce served with many poke bowls – was slightly too sweet for my liking and overwhelming on the surface area of the dish. With the restaurant offering nine alternative sauce options, the wasabi aioli looked particularly appealing to me.
D.C., similar to any city, is full of eateries serving food for far too much money. Rarely do I find non-chain restaurants offering picturesque portion sizes – yet Abunai’s poke bowl did just that. The ratio of fish to rice allowed for a harmonious balance of rich flavors in each bite all the way through to the ever-disappointing-yet-satisfying end of my meal. Little beats the feeling of unwavering confidence in a purchase.
If you enjoy quick, healthy fare at the hands of small business owners, visit Abunai’s L Street location before the holidays.

Before the promise of turkey and stuffing dragged me away from my inbox, I opened an email last Wednesday to find a tantalizing opportunity. Among discount offers from the Campus Store, an invoice for the upcoming spring semester and countless well-wishes for Thanksgiving was one of the School of Media and Public Affairs’ weekly newsletters. The Wall Street Journal’s opinion section was looking for interns. The application was due Monday, and I knew I had to give it a shot.
Editorial journalism has defined the past five years of my life – I wrote dozens of columns for my high school newspaper, parlayed that interest into an application for SMPA and eventually joined The Hatchet as an opinions writer last year. So why not see how the professionals do it? It certainly didn’t hurt that the internship was paid, and I can think of worse places to spend a summer than New York City. With a vision of the Big Apple dancing in my head and the dulcet tones of Frank Sinatra ringing in my ears, I spread the news that I’d be applying in calls and FaceTimes to siblings, parents and grandparents, conjuring up visions of 10 weeks of journalistic training par excellence.
Come Sunday, Thanksgiving in all its gluttonous glory and the days that followed should have given way to a cover letter, resume and a handful of my best articles. Except they didn’t. I won’t be interning at The Wall Street Journal come summer. In fact, I didn’t even apply at all.
As the midnight deadline ticked ever closer Sunday night, I sat at my desk, staring at blank pages that should have been a cover letter and writing sample. I couldn’t, per the application’s instructions, find 600 measly words to write something consistent with The Wall Street Journal’s philosophy of “free markets, free people,” defend my most controversial opinion or write a letter to the editor. I called my mom and dad to break the news. The internship was off. I wasn’t applying. I lost this opportunity, and worse, I made myself lose it.
It’s easy to understand what happened – I didn’t write a cover letter or answer a prompt. But I’ve been trying to rationalize why I didn’t all week. Maybe I decided that The Wall Street Journal’s brand of sneering, I-told-you-so conservatism wasn’t for me. Maybe it was just procrastination. Maybe I didn’t care about it in the first place. Or maybe it was a combination of all three.
This slow-moving tragedy was the first time I’ve really tried – and failed – to secure an internship. I chucked my bare Word document into a folder on my desktop, took a step back from my computer and went through a bout of deep frustration. It didn’t help that I was the target of my own disappointment. My stomach churned, and I felt wisps of tears form in the corner of my eyes. I sabotaged myself, throwing away an opportunity that could have unlocked more paths to learn about editorial journalism, or at the very least, a chance to update my resume. Like infinitesimal grains of sand, a summer at The Wall Street Journal slipped through my fingers.
I don’t think I’m the only one who’s lost something amid this flurry of internship applications and finals. If you’ve procrastinated just a little too late to meet a deadline, flunked a test or even botched an application like me, you’ve lost. It’s all too easy to think that you failed or lost something because you’re bad – undeserving, unworthy of success.
But internships and other academic pursuits can’t measure your value as a person, like what you believe or how you behave. You can’t talk about how you kept your friends’ spirits up during an all-nighter or handed someone back the change that slipped out of their pocket on a resume, yet these skills are as valuable as an ability to crunch spreadsheets or shoot video. A 10-week internship in New York City or wherever else is not the be-all and end-all of the human experience, and an aborted application is no reason to doomspiral. And while no internship is guaranteed to be perfect, don’t settle for one at an organization whose philosophy, be it editorial or otherwise, stands at odds with your personal values.
Loss and failure are a regular part of life and we can either succumb to it or master it. And in my time of trouble, I turned to poet Elizabeth Bishop’s “One Art,” a lovely piece I’ve revisited time and time again for class assignments and now for the wisdom it contains. “One Art” is an ode to loss and how we move on from it. In other words, it’s a guide to grief.
“The art of losing isn’t hard to master,” the poem begins. Yet this “art of losing” is actually pretty tricky to master. Lost keys or a wasted hour online are a far cry from a loved one passing away or a career opportunity that failed before it even began. But loss, both big and small, is normal. And it’s possible to move on from it. Like any loss, remember that a missed opportunity is neither a reflection of your self-worth nor the end of the world. It may take some convincing, but life goes on. Even the tears shed mourning the application that went unsent will dry at some point.
I don’t think Elizabeth Bishop, who died in 1979, could have ever expected a college student navigating the perils and pitfalls of internships to find solace in 19 lines of poetry. So I’ll leave you with the final lines of “One Art” – “The art of losing’s not too hard to master/though it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.” This has been my attempt to “write it!” And I feel better already. Loss hurts, but it doesn’t last forever.
