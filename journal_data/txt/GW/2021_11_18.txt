The Foggy Bottom and West End ANC voted to approve the installation of a Flixbus stop and hosted a discussion with D.C. Council member and mayoral candidate Robert White at the meeting.
A local governing body approved plans to install an intercity bus stop in Foggy Bottom during a monthly meeting Wednesday.
The Foggy Bottom and West End Advisory Neighborhood Commission unanimously voted to install the bus stop on the 400 block of 19th Street near the F Street intersection, offering transportation service to Richmond, Virginia or New York City. Commissioners also received an update about the D.C. Council’s ongoing work from at-large Council member Robert White, who launched a campaign for mayor last month, and approved an alcohol license for a restaurant preparing to open in Western Market.
Here are a few of the meeting’s highlights:
ANC greenlights Flixbus stop near campus
Following the ANC’s approval, the application to install the intercity bus stop, which will replace five parking spots, will now head to the D.C. Public Space Committee and the District Department of Transportation. Flixbus officials developed plans to add a stop in front of the International Monetary Fund last year before scrapping the idea because of traffic concerns.
Francesca La Brecque, a spokesperson for Flixbus, said the stop’s new location south of the Elliott School of International Affairs has minimal impact on traffic and residential parking, which were previously concerns related to the stop.
“The schedule that we proposed to DDOT is a seven-day-a-week schedule with more service on the Monday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday timeline,” she said at the meeting.
La Brecque said the bus stop could be operational before the holidays next month, but stipulations from the Public Space Committee at next month’s meeting could delay that timeline.
White talks homelessness, crime in D.C.
Commissioner Trupti Patel introduced White as her guest at the meeting, where the mayoral candidate and Council member delivered updates about the Council’s work and fielded questions from commissioners. White voiced his opposition to the District’s controversial pilot program to remove three of the District’s largest homeless encampments, which he said regressed the city’s support for unhoused people.
White said the program, which is set to close the E Street encampment near campus, offers housing to people in need but leaves behind those who don’t immediately accept assistance from District officials.
“Getting people to use these housing vouchers and support services that come with them requires a level of trust, and it takes some time often, to build that trust,” White said in the meeting.
White said city officials should listen to activists who protested against the pilot program and said they should extend the program’s timeline to expand outreach efforts to unhoused people who may take longer to decide to accept housing vouchers. He said he hopes to work within the Council to separate the timelines set for residents to obtain housing vouchers and city officials to close encampments, and prevent the implementation of no-tent zones, which he said is “criminalizing poverty.”
“I think we shoot ourselves in the foot by trying to rush this process,” he said. “We want to do it quickly, but we don’t want to rush it to a degree that is unreasonable.”
White also updated the ANC on the Council’s budget for the Metropolitan Police Department to address concerns that lawmakers were either defunding or failing to defund the police. He said the Council decreased MPD’s budget by $22 million from Fiscal Year 2021 to FY 2022 but also maintained a department of nearly 4,800 employees, the most at MPD since 2014.
White said the Council budgeted more money to local crime-fighting efforts through the Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement, which takes a “public health approach” to violence prevention, to reduce crime instead of defunding the police.
“The Council approved an increase in the budget for the Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement of $12.3 million for violence prevention, which means that that office now has a budget of nearly $30 million,” he said.
Commissioners approve alcohol application
Commissioners unanimously voted to approve an application from Onkei, a Japanese food and sushi restaurant opening soon in Western Market, to serve alcoholic beverages. A representative from the restaurant said the business would use the alcohol permit to sell sake, a traditional Japanese alcoholic beverage.
The representative said the restaurant’s hours will match Western Market’s hours of operation when the business opens.

The organization has made eight demands of GW, including an apology and additional training. 
A Palestinian rights advocacy organization has filed a civil rights complaint with D.C.’s Office for Human Rights against GW, alleging that the University discriminated against Palestinian students by being “selective” in its offerings of trauma services.
The organization Palestine Legal sent the complaint to officials Nov. 8 on behalf of an employee from the Office of Advocacy and Support. The complaint states that representatives from the Board of Trustees and the Office of the President called an emergency meeting on June 3 to instruct OAS to take down information about a “virtual processing space” for Palestinian students that the office had posted on its Instagram June 2 in the wake of outbreaks of violence in Gaza.  
The complaint states officials communicated at the emergency meeting that University President Thomas LeBlanc was going to conduct “audit” of OAS, which could have resulted in the office’s permanent closure, depending on the audit’s results. The complaint alleges that administrators “ordered” OAS to post an apology following the emergency meeting.
The letter alleges that when Students Against Sexual Assault also attempted to host a trauma support group for Palestinian students on Instagram, they were directed to remove the post. The complaint states that SASA and OAS were told that supporting Palestinian human rights and offering support to Palestinian students was harmful to Jewish students. 
University spokesperson Crystal Nosal said in a statement that the University received the complaint from Palestine Legal and will investigate the concerns.
“GW is committed toward diversity, equity and inclusion and to maintaining a nondiscriminatory work and educational environment,” she said in an email. “We have received the letter from Palestine Legal and the concerns raised there will be investigated.”
Nada Elbasha, an advocacy specialist at OAS who brought the complaint to Palestine Legal, said officials “acted in opposition” to the principles of diversity and inclusion at GW. Elbasha said the University’s alleged actions against OAS amounts to “institutional discrimination.” 
“Palestinian students deserve to access the same services as any other student here – and by canceling OAS’s processing space and threatening our office, GW sent the message that they don’t care about the Palestinian community and that their healing is not important,” she said in an email. 
Elbasha said she’s looking for accountability for University leaders and more Palestinian representation in the University community.
“GW offers my office’s services after incidents of violence on campus – and ultimately what I’m asking for is that Palestinians be considered in that offer as well,” she said.
Radhika Sainath, a Palestine Legal senior staff attorney handling the complaint, said senior officials implied to OAS staff that they would be fired if they did not cancel the virtual processing space. 
“To this date, they have not been allowed to provide trauma services for Palestinians,” Sainath said. “And that’s unlawful. That’s a civil rights violation in this country, and in D.C., you cannot discriminate against people on the basis of their identity.” 
She said the D.C. human rights office, where the complaint was filed, is expected to soon contact Palestine Legal to open an investigation.
Palestine Legal has had involvement with GW in the past. After campus police ordered a student to remove a Palestinian flag from his window in 2015, the group wrote to then-University President Stephen Knapp urging the University to allow the student to hang the flag. Knapp issued an apology to the GW community about a month later. 
Sainath said she hopes to receive an apology from the University and adherence to the group’s eight demands outlined in the complaint. The demands include releasing a statement apologizing for the denial of processing services to Palestinian students, mandating a training for Office of Diversity, Equity and Community Engagement staff, creating a resource list for Palestinian students and rescheduling the virtual processing space.
Other demands include allowing OAS to operate as it did prior to the original post without censorship over healing spaces, adding an Arab or Middle East and North Africa category to the Multicultural Student Services Center webpage, recognizing Arab American Heritage month and holding a “#GWinSolidarity” event on anti-Palestinian bias and violence this academic year.  
“​​We’re asking GW to do the right thing, apologize, reinstate services to Palestinians,” Sainath said. “Clearly a lot of people need a training on anti-Palestinian discrimination, and you can read the rest of the demands there, but we really do hope that GW will do the right thing.”

The Atlantic 10 Conference Presidents Council announced its formal acceptance of Loyola University Chicago as the 15th member institution of the league.
The Ramblers will become official members on July 1 and compete in the 21-sport league, according to an A-10 release. In joining the conference, Loyola will take on old foes including Dayton, Duquesne, La Salle and Saint Louis, which were all previous foes of the Ramblers in the Midwestern Collegiate Conference.
“Welcoming Loyola University Chicago was not a difficult decision for the Presidents Council, due to its similarity with our member institutions, including the value Loyola places on conducting successful athletics in harmony with a nationally recognized, broad-based educational profile,” Chair of the A-10 Presidents Council and Saint Joseph’s University President Dr. Mark C. Reed said in the release.
Founded in 1870, with an enrollment of more than 17,000, Loyola will become the fourth Jesuit institution in the Atlantic 10, joining Fordham, Saint Joseph’s and Saint Louis.
The Ramblers will join the A-10 as the fourth program to have appeared in the men’s basketball Final Four in the last 25 years, and the ninth program with a Final Four appearance in history. Loyola won the 1963 Men’s Basketball National Championship and also took home the national titles in men’s volleyball in 2014 and 2015.
“Loyola’s commitment to the high-level scholastic achievement of all of its students, coupled with its excellent athletic profile, from success in basketball, soccer and volleyball to outstanding facilities and resources, is a perfect fit for the A-10,” Atlantic 10 Commissioner Bernadette V. McGlade said in the release.” The addition expands the A-10 footprint into the Chicago market, giving the conference a presence in three of the top five media markets in the United States.”
As a result of Loyola’s membership, A-10 institutions now cover states comprising 39.9 million state-wide television households, approximately a third of the national media market, according to the release. The conference also entered their ninth-year of a long-term television agreement with ESPN, CBS Sports and NBC Sports.
The A-10 conference has received 34 men’s basketball NCAA Tournament bids over the last 10 years, ranking seventh nationally. The A-10 has also seen 17 appearances in the NCAA Women’s Basketball Tournament over the past 10 years, eight of which have come via at-large bids, and had at least four teams qualify for women’s basketball postseason play every year of the past decade

Kerrie Finegan, one of the three students overseeing Marriage Pact, said she hopes to offer the questionnaire annually. 
Whether it’s a casual friend, a perfectly compatible romantic partner or something in between, students are optimistic to find a new peer to meet on campus as the GDUB Marriage Pact unveils matches for its second launch this week.
The Marriage Pact, a questionnaire consisting of about 50 personality-related questions, garnered widespread attention from more than 4,200 students last semester as a means to match students with their most compatible partner. Students, who said they are “underwhelmed” by GW’s dating culture, said they are looking forward to meeting their new matches after failing to hit it off with their initial pairings last semester.
Kerrie Finegan, one of three students running the GDUB Marriage Pact, said the group relaunched the questionnaire this semester so that the Marriage Pact would release close to the same time as Georgetown and American University launched their versions. She said the new edition of the Marriage Pact features updated questions the organizers found relevant to the GW community.
“I really hope that since we are in person, people are actually going to meet up with their pact and maybe start dating, maybe find better friends,” Finegan said. “I think that’s definitely an advantage to being in person is that it can be more of a real thing.”
She said the relaunched Marriage Pact, which released matches Wednesday evening, received responses from more than 3,500 undergraduates, and she hopes to offer the questionnaire to students annually.

Finegan said while preparing for both launches, she and the group sifted through a list of questions and chose to add specific inquiries that particularly pertained to GW’s community. She said some of the new additions include “I am against Greek Life,” because a “lot” of students are “not necessarily the biggest fans” of Greek Life, and “I can’t stand people who play Devil’s Advocate,” as a nod to the controversial tendency for students in the Elliott School of International Affairs to volunteer to argue the unpopular opinion in class.
She said these personalized versions of the Pact, curated for GW students, act as a way of “celebrating” GW culture. She said responses to new statements like “I talk to my Uber drivers on every ride” can reveal a lot about campus culture.
“The talking to Uber driver question was just really fun because it really shows whether a person can be talkative, spontaneous or very friendly, or if they are more introverted and keep to themselves,” Finegan said in an email.
John Hicks, a junior from Elkin, N.C., said he has experienced difficulties finding a partner within the D.C. gay community. He said he finds the community “shallow” because without a certain type of “physique” or adhering to a busy social life involving partying and clubbing it’s easy to feel like you don’t fit in.
“If you’re not in the ‘it group,’ you have a harder time connecting with people,” Hicks said. “So definitely I think if you don’t fit a certain stereotype, especially in the gay community, it’s harder for you to find those connections.”
Hicks said outside of the questionnaire, the GDUB Marriage Pact Instagram page, which features comical posts and stories about GW dating culture, provides a sense of “camaraderie” for students who are all going through the same “sucky” situation. He said while the questionnaire provides “hope” for students looking to find a match, Marriage Pact also helps students still struggling with feeling “alone” after returning back to in-person instruction.
“It’s fun and if you get a relationship out of it, great,” he said. “But it’s still something that can keep your interests and hopes alive for a little bit.”
Celia Luling, a junior from Medford, N.J., said she noticed the new version of the questionnaire poses more “refined” questions relevant to students about the environment and political activism that connect more with the GW community.
Luling said she finds dating at GW difficult because of the high female-to-male ratio of students at the University, which U.S. News reported as a 64% female, 36% male split as of fall 2020. She said while she did not communicate with her initial match from the spring, she thinks Marriage Pact will have more potential in an in-person environment than it did during the virtual spring semester.
“I don’t think it’s truly telling of the impact it could have, because no one was really around on campus, and if you were, you were still isolated in this COVID world,” Luling said. “So I think the fall has really given us a chance to really see how much will actually come of it.”
Alexander Robinson, a sophomore from Athens, Ga., said when the initial version of the Marriage Pact rolled out last spring, he was “excited” by the opportunity to meet someone new at GW after spending his entire freshman year at home. He said he spoke with his original match online, but ultimately did not maintain contact.
He said in the second go-around, he hopeful at the prospect of a potential match.
“Meeting new people is always a good thing,” Robinson said. “So meeting someone else, someone who I can hold a conversation with, that’s always a win.”

Although the Colonials were unable to finish off a late surge to win the game, center Noel Brown's performance was a bright spot with a career high 10 points scored. 
Men’s basketball suffered a loss to Cal State Fullerton Tuesday night to end their two-game road swing in California.
The Colonials (1-3) fell to the Titans (1-2) in a 74-59 loss. Despite a late game surge to pull within seven points with just over three minutes left to play, the Titans finished the game off with an 11-3 scoring run to leave the Colonials winless on the road thus far this season.
Junior guard James Bishop led GW with 19 points and three assists. On the other side of the court, the Titans were paced by senior forward E.J. Anosike, who had a dominant game with 28 points and 11 rebounds on 12-of-16 shooting. Sophomore guard Dante Maddox Jr. also finished with 11 points, five rebounds and three assists while senior guard Damari Milstead amassed 10 points, four rebounds and two assists.
Head coach Jamion Christian said the team just wasn’t able to “slow down” Anosike, whose older brother played for Siena prior to Christian’s coaching position at Siena.
“He’s a great offensive rebounder, and he put together a great night against us.” Christian said. “Our thing is, because we’re great at defending the three, we make people take tough two’s and he was able to make them tonight.”
GW was dominated on the glass all night, with the Titans having a rebounding advantage of 40-28. The Colonials struggled to get consistent scoring from anyone but Bishop, who shot 7-of-21 from the field and 5-of-14 from three point range.
“We have Ricky Lindo, he’s going to lead the A-10 in rebounding this year.” Christian said. “So, he’s always going to get them. We got to get some more rebounds from some other guys. And, one of the contributing factors is that our offense is not scoring enough so we’re having to go back in transition so often.”
GW has struggled to stay out of foul trouble yet again Tuesday as both sophomore guard Joe Bamisile and senior forward Ricky Lindo Jr. found themselves in trouble. Bamisile picked up two first half fouls and Lindo collected three before the break.
The Colonials struggled to reach the foul line, only getting 12 free throws, 11 of which came in the second half, and converted just 8-of-12. Meanwhile, the Titans earned 20 free throws in the game, cashing in on 18 of them. Through four games, GW’s opponents have attempted 108 free throws while the Colonials have attempted just 59.
“I think defensively, we’re not containing the ball enough.” Christian said. “So we’re putting ourselves in a position to foul. And the result of that is that they’re able to get to the free throw line before we are.”
But sophomore center Noel Brown proved to be a bright spot for the Colonials, who was second in scoring with a career high 10 points on 4-of-6 from the floor to go along with three rebounds.
“Tonight it was great to see Noel Brown.” Christian said. “He was stepping up and playing great. I feel like that’s a piece for us, that, as he grows, can be really scary.”
Brown took on a larger role after junior forward Hunter Dean went down with an injury in last Thursday’s 71-64 loss to No. 20 Maryland. Christian said Dean is day-to-day and his status for the Colonials next game is unknown.
Freshman guard Brayon Freeman also ended the night with four points and seven rebounds, driving into the lane to create shots for himself and his teammates off the dribble.
Despite suffering a six minute scoring drought in the latter stage of the first half, GW went into the half trailing 34-30 thanks to a pair of threes by Bishop. The Colonials had held a 17-12 lead earlier in the period with just more than 12 minutes to play but were unable to maintain it.
After a similar back and forth start to the second half, the Titans pushed their lead to 63-40 with 6:49 to go in the game. The Colonials slipped into a scoring drought during this period, not scoring a field goal for over eight and half minutes. During the drought, Cal State Fullerton went on a 20-2 run to seemingly put the game to bed, until Bishop landed a three point bucket with 6:07 left to play.
Part way through the Titans’ run, Christian pulled the starters from the game for nearly two full minutes.
“I wanted to reset them because they’ve got to play well together for us to be a great team.” Christian said. “And the times this year they’ve done that, we’ve been great. But there’s been a long stretch over the last few games where we’re not playing together and you get to a point that you just can’t continue to watch that happen.”
Upon putting the starters back in, the Colonials went on a 16-0 run over 2:54, beginning with Bishop’s three, to claw their way back within seven points with 3:13 left and score of 63-56. The effort was sparked by an aggressive full court press and forced turnovers that allowed GW to score eight points off the fast break.
“I think when they gel together we’ll be a dangerous group.” Christian said. “But if they’re not gelled together, we’re going to be a team that’s beatable. I thought I saw some strides today and I’ve seen some strides in the last few weeks.”
But the Titans were able to hold off the surging Colonials with a few important baskets and 5-of-6 free throw shooting in the last three minutes of the game to get their first win of the season after close losses to Santa Clara and San Jose State.
The Colonials return home to play UMass Lowell Friday night in a 7 p.m. tip-off.

To many, 18 is not their favorite birthday. Getting their drivers’ license at 16 is well behind them and the privilege of legally drinking alcohol is still three years out. But the age does mark one of the most important milestones in a young adult’s life – the age at which they can vote. 
Making their voices heard through the Democratic system is crucial to ensuring that young people have a voice in the country’s decision making process, but the first-time voting process can get complicated for students starting their journeys at GW. Voting for the first time as a student can be a long process that involves requesting absentee ballots to be sent to their new addresses, filling out their ballots well in advance of voting day to ensure they can make it to their hometowns in time to be counted and navigating any delays with mailing. 
And the implications of this head-spinning ordeal? The youngest generation that can vote isn’t able to make their voice heard in their own communities.
Elections at the local, state and national elections occurred throughout the country earlier this month, but officials failed to provide students with information on how to cast their ballots or to send out messages encouraging them to get involved even in an off-year election. Voting is the best way to participate in our democracy – to sustain its reputation of being a politically active school, administrators must do their best to ensure students feel empowered to participate in democracy. Off-year elections are particularly impactful because many key Congressional roles are filled. Some of the most influential elections in recent memory, including races won by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and former Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.), were elected in off-year races. 
Off-year elections – years without presidential elections when citizens elect congresspeople, mayors, city council candidates and school board members – are vital to communities, because that’s when elections are held for positions that most often work the closest with communities. Though these elections have the most direct impact on community members, Americans consistently fail to cast their ballots in time for the elections. 
In the next off-year election season, GW should initiate social media campaigns with infographics or links to how to vote in your state, or posters around campus just reminding students in general. GW Votes, a nonpartisan task force in the Nashman Center for Civic Engagement and Public Service hosted a voter registration drive in Potomac Square earlier this semester to encourage first time voters to show up to the polls this election season. Enhancing efforts like these could once bolster voter turnout in future off year elections. 
GW should prioritize student voting and model their efforts after other schools that have been able to increase student participation. For instance, Princeton University’s Dean of the Undergraduate Studies office launched an initiative in 2015 encouraging students from New Jersey and those from out of state to register to vote in their home states. The organization partnered with other nonpartisan organizations to launch a training program that educated students on voting. From the 2016 election to the 2020 presidential election, Princeton’s eligible student voter turnout  increased by 15 percent. 
Different generations often have similar political beliefs within themselves because they grew up going through the same events. This is why older generations often are more conservative, and younger generations more liberal. It’s vital that we elect people who share our hopes and dreams in order to create a better future for ourselves and others. GW can support this cause by encouraging students to vote. 
Voting for a president is only a fraction of the battle for the change that we want to see. For a political party to remain in office and have the chance to promote their beliefs, people have to do their best to vote in all elections. Even for those who don’t subscribe to a party, voting is what allows us to choose who is in power. As a political school in the nation’s Capital, this applies to GW especially. The key is getting young people like us involved, and GW has the ability to make an impact among young voters.

For 34 days, students at Howard University occupied the university’s Blackburn Student Center to protest unsafe building conditions and to demand student voting rights on the board of trustees. The take-over, organized by the Live Movement and HU’s chapter of Democratic Socialists of America, began Oct. 12 and ended on Nov. 15 after reaching an understanding with administrators.
The occupation follows a historic nationwide uptick of student protests regarding the increasingly undemocratic structure of university administration, the affordability concerns of rising tuition costs and poor housing conditions. What has been unique to Howard is the overwhelming degree of intellectual vitality, courage, organization and love that their activism has embodied. GW students who care to improve the conditions of our University should take notes on Howard’s student activism, and GW administrators should take heed – it is only a matter of time before students must organize for a more democratically led university.
Howard students are no strangers to setting extraordinary precedents for student mobilization. In 2018, Howard students protested for nine days and occupied the administration building at the university in favor of police demilitarization, shared governance and improved student services. After reaching a deal with the university, where seven out of nine of the student demands were met, the take-over ceased. But the university failed to adequately implement the demands that they agreed to and student frustration with administration continued to boil. This is why students in the past two months have been demanding student power in administrative decisions. As a result of the Blackburn take-over, HU granted students voting power on its board of trustees at the committee level in addition to the creation of other shared governance avenues.
Students at Howard recognized that their university had been notorious for failing to deliver student demands. If administrators at GW refuse to fulfill students’ needs, then students must take it upon themselves to implement change. This can mean a take-over or any other action that directly challenges university authority.
HU students have shown that they are attuned to engaging in the kinds of direct action that challenges authority. Occupations, take-overs and other forms of collective-based direct action have been highly effective, especially in the context of student movements, because they physically disrupt the processes that are needed for typical university operations. This makes them incredibly difficult to ignore, much more so than emails, petitions and letters. Though all of these other forms of protest have their own merits, they are not as effective at challenging power dynamics, demanding urgency or demanding attention as disruptions like sit-ins are.
The Blackburn take-over received national attention. Media attention on these types of protests can pressure university officials to end the disruption more quickly out of worry that the university will appear, especially to donors, disorganized and unable to manage its students.
Time is also a crucial element. Longer protests can communicate the degree of severity and urgency of student needs to officials. The longer these protests last, the longer they pose a threat to day-to-day university operations. Identifying university interests and determining how to strategically obstruct those interests is important in influencing how a protest should be carried out. In Howard’s case, the duration of the sit-in allowed the protest to garner national attention that pressured HU’s administration to cooperate with the student protestors.
GW has been notorious for faltering on student demands. In October, GW Protects Rapists, an organization for survivors of sexual misconduct who reported being unsupported or out-right ignored by the Title IX Office, organized a town hall for administrators to hear the grievances of the student community. Grievances included non-responsiveness by the office and not failure to bar assailants from campus. According to a post on instagram made by GW Protects Rapists, the University has made no statement on how corrective action on the Office’s failings will be taken following the town hall. Students are becoming increasingly frustrated with the University’s inaction and know that they wouldn’t have to ask the University to act if they already had a seat at the decision- making table. GW needs to give students that seat.
Graduate students at GW unionized with SEIU Local 500, a labor union representing workers across the DMV, to demand fairer working conditions including higher wages and more affordable health care. In a letter to the University in 2018, workers described how the University disengaged with the union on several key issues regarding the University’s operations, refusing to make contact or even recognize graduate students as workers. The manner in which the University has willfully chosen to ignore student demands reflects not just an unwillingness on part of administrators to take corrective action but an institutional opposition to student power.
On the climate front, student climate activists at GW including Sunrise GW have been calling on the University to cut ties or disaffiliate from the RSC, a research center at GW that receives millions of dollars from the fossil fuel industry and in turn produces research calling for fossil fuel deregulation. Students have argued that the University must close the center because it is perpetuating climate denial, in light of the fact that this research has then been used as an authoritative source by the government to implement these deregulations.  In response, the University has been hostile to the movement, doubling down on denying the clear relationship between fossil fuel money and the RSC. This dismissal of student interests reveals a simple fact about power distribution at the University: the University sees students as suggestion boxes, not equal players in decision making.
Students everywhere are organizing and since administrators have already chosen to ignore several fronts of student activism, from sexual assault to labor and more, it’s time that students start recognizing and feeling entitled to having administrative decision making power at GW. This is something that students across the country are beginning to see as a serious institutional flaw in higher education. Students should not have to beg for what is due to them, and so they should feel very much in their right to take it – whether that be a responsive Title IX office, better labor conditions or a Board of Trustees that is accountable to the University community. GW students deserve better and should begin to mobilize for it.

GW's trouble scoring plagued the team for most of the game, converting on just nine of 42 shots from the field throughout the game. 
Women’s basketball dropped its second straight game to Minnesota on the road Sunday afternoon.
The Colonials (1-2) were defeated by the Golden Gophers (3-1) in a low scoring affair 48-32. The Colonials shot a season low 19.2 percent from the floor, handing a program record for the Minnesota defense in a single game, but the GW defense also kept the Golden Gophers to a season low 48 points.
Graduate student forward Ty Moore finished the afternoon with eight points and eight rebounds while sophomore guard Aurea Gingras, junior guard Sheslanie Laureano and sophomore guard Taylor Webster accumulated six points apiece.
On the other side of the court, graduate student guard Deja Winters led all scorers with 17 points, eight rebounds and three blocks followed by junior guard Sara Scalia with 14 points and two assists.
Golden Gophers redshirt junior forward Kadi Sissoko scored all nine of her points in the first quarter, including a pair of threes to kickstart the Minnesota offense early and take the lead. She also collected eight defensive rebounds to help keep the Colonials to just 4-of-17 from the field in the quarter.
Despite the poor shooting performance, junior guard Essence Brown hit a bank shot to bring the Colonials back within single digits by the quarter’s end with a score of 16-8.
Scalia began the scoring in the second quarter, driving toward the basket and converting a layup despite being chopped down by Moore. Scalia converted the free throw as well to establish a double-digit lead over the Colonials.
GW finally got their first points of the quarter with 6:15 left to play, courtesy of a three point bucket from Laureano. Gingras hit a jumper on the next possession to cut the lead to 21-13 before Scalia sank a deep three with 3:39 left.
With 2:22 left, Webster ended the Colonials three-minute scoring drought with a jumper just outside the key. After a missed three attempt by Winters, Brown attempted a layup off the fast break but Winters stuffed the chance from behind before marching down the court two possessions later and finishing a Euro step layup.
At the sound of the halftime buzzer, the Colonials trailed 28-15 and had shot just 7-of-31 from the field while sinking just 1-of-7 from deep.
After trading several two-point buckets to start the second half, Scalia hit another deep three with 7:16 left in the quarter. Scalia followed it up with yet another less than four minutes later, this time from the corner, to put Minnesota up 38-19. Winters swatted another attempted layup from Brown to close out the quarter.
The Colonials shooting woes continued in the second half, as they hit just 2-of-11 from the field, 0-of-3 from deep and 1-of-4 from the free throw line. By the end of the third, the Colonials trailed by the largest deficit of the game at 40-20.
GW struck first for the first time in the fourth quarter, thanks to a pair of free throws by Webster. Freshman forward Sophie Haydon also scored her second layup of the season after Brown found her inside the paint while dribbling away from Winters with 6:40 left to play. Haydon’s layup would be the only field goal of the quarter for the Colonials as they would finish the game 1-of-9 from the floor, but 10-of-12 from the charity stripe.
Winters scored all eight of Minnesota’s points in the fourth quarter, highlighted by an uncontested three with 4:06 left and a contested jumper just outside the key with 1:41 left to close out the game.
The Colonials will continue their road swing Thursday night when they head to Norfolk, Va. to take on Old Dominion for a 6:30 p.m tipoff.

The Board of Trustees voted last year to divest GW’s endowment from companies that focus on fossil fuel extraction following pressure from Sunrise GW and other students. 
Sunrise GW launched a campaign pressing officials to enact a ban on funding from a line of the country’s largest fossil fuel companies Tuesday.
The “No Fossil Fuel Money Campaign” initiative pressures officials to reject funding from fossil fuel companies that have worked to oppose climate action, including ExxonMobil and Chevron, and “end reliance” on fossil fuel funding from the top 200 public owners of oil, coal and gas reserves. Student leaders said more than 200 students have signed a petition in support of the campaign, which was outlined in a letter members sent to administrators and the Board of Trustees in an effort to highlight “the stakes of climate crisis.”
Sunrise members said they’re requesting officials to meet the campaign’s demands by the end of the semester Dec. 22.
“As students deeply concerned about the climate crisis and committed to our University, we are calling on you to take the next steps towards building a better future for all of us,” the letter sent to the administration and the board states. 
The release states officials must start turning away funding from the “Slippery Six,” a group of six fossil fuel companies that testified before Congress about their role in an alleged “long-running, industry-wide campaign” to spread disinformation about how fossil fuels can cause global warming. The group is comprised of ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP America, Shell, the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Sunrise also called on the University to ban funding the top ten funders of a countermovement against the climate change intended to obstruct climate action. 
The campaign requests officials to adopt a plan to end reliance on funding from the Carbon Underground 200, the top executives of publicly-owned oil, gas and coal reserves across the globe. The list of 200 owners are ranked by the amount of carbon emissions embedded in their reserves.
Sunrise has protested GW’s ties to fossil fuel companies for years, advocating for the closure of the Regular Studies Center and demanding divestment from the fossil fuel industry – a commitment that GW eventually made last June.
“We divested from fossil fuels to align our investments with our commitment to climate action,” the letter states. “Now, in order to lead on climate in higher education, GW must examine how the fossil fuel industry’s investments in our university square with those same commitments.” 
The release states other universities, like the University of Texas, have banned funds from companies like those in the tobacco industry, which tamper with research and mislead the public. 
“By taking the steps we called for today, GW can address issues deeper than any one center,” the letter states. “It is time to be a model across higher education for how to best position institutions to take on the greatest challenge of our time.”
Sunrise also called on faculty, institutions, students and student organizations at GW to become a “climate ally” or “climate leader” and pledge their support for the campaign, according to Sunrise’s petition.
Aza Evans-Townsend – one of three chairs on the Sunrise’s Regulatory Studies Center committee, which spearheaded the launch of the new campaign – said if the University does not respond to the group’s requests by the December deadline, members will initiate meetings with administrators, organize protests and hold events with students to continue pushing for their demands. 
“It is something that’s so important to us, and we know that the community cares about it,” she said. “We have plans if we are completely ignored to continue pushing, to have our voices heard.”
She said members hope officials will stop accepting money from fossil fuel companies to research centers, so GW can continue to set the precedent to combat climate change among universities nationally. 
“​​Sunrise GW had a big win with divestment, and a lot of top universities around the country are deciding to divest,” she said. “And that’s a big step in ensuring that fossil fuel money isn’t getting more influence from our universities, but the reason we’re launching this campaign is because there’s still influence from big oil and the fossil fuel industry that is infiltrating our campuses.”
