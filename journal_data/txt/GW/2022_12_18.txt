The lawsuit alleges Stafford and other non-white players faced years of racism, including frequent racist slurs, harassment and harsher punishment from coaches for minor infractions.
A federal appeals court Friday revived a former tennis player’s lawsuit against GW alleging racial discrimination from coaches and teammates after the court ruled a lower judge wrongly dismissed the case earlier in January.
Jabari Stafford – a former men’s tennis player – filed the lawsuit in 2018 accusing officials of failing to properly address a racist and discriminatory environment fostered by players and coaches during Stafford’s time as a player. A D.C. District Court judge struck the lawsuit down in January, saying Stafford filed the lawsuit too late, in violation of a one-year statute of limitations under the D.C. Human Rights Act.
A panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled the District Court judge incorrectly used the one-year statute of limitations under the human rights law to dismiss the case, saying a three-year statute of limitations under personal injury law applied to Stafford’s lawsuit.
The U.S. Court of Appeals’ decision, a victory for Stafford, means the case will return to the D.C. District Court and litigation will resume.
The lawsuit alleges Stafford and other non-white players faced years of racism, including frequent racist slurs, harassment and harsher punishment from coaches for minor infractions.
“They asked him if his ancestors were slaves, how he could be Black and have money and told him he belonged in Black neighborhoods,” this year’s appeal from Stafford reads. “They plotted to goad him into lashing out so that they could secretly record him and then use the recording to have him kicked off the team.”
U.S. Court of Appeals Senior Judge David Tatel, who wrote the court’s decision, said the court used Supreme Court precedent to determine that officials’ alleged discrimination – which they say falls under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bans racial discrimination by institutions which receive federal funds – are like “an injury to the individual rights of the person.” The judges decided the Supreme Court precedents show Title VI cases are most similar to personal injury cases with three-year statutes of limitations, rather than the D.C. Human Rights Act’s one-year statute.
After D.C. District Court Judge Christopher Cooper dismissed the lawsuit earlier this year, Tom Stafford – Jabari’s father – said in an interview with The Hatchet that he was “very confident” in their ability to successfully appeal the dismissal.
The University denied claims that officials mistreated Stafford based on “the color of his skin” in a 2019 filing, which stated officials treated him “fairly and lawfully.” But Cooper said the University was “wise” when it didn’t deny that Stafford faced “severe, pervasive and objectively offensive” abuse while on the tennis team.
A University spokesperson was not immediately available for comment. University spokesperson Tim Pierce declined to comment on Stafford’s appeal earlier this year.
Attorneys for Stafford were not immediately available for comment.

SA Sen. Linsi Goodin, CCAS-G and chair of the finance committee, said the finance committee disbursed allocations to fund student organizations “as equally and as equitably as we possibly can.”
The Student Association Senate earlier this month approved the general allocations for student organizations for the spring semester, totaling more than $240,000.
The SA fulfilled 16.75 percent of organization funding requests this semester, a drop after officials diverted 16 percent of the SA’s budget to the University-Wide Program Fund, which funds multicultural and large-scale events. Nathan Nguyen, the director of the Legislative Budget Office, which consulted on allocations, said the SA reviewed each organization’s applications at least four times.
“A significant amount of money was set aside specifically for cultural orgs to make sure that we are funding them because we know that they’re voicing complaints, and they think that they’re not being funded properly,” he said.
Nguyen said within its internal allocation processes, the finance committee added an additional round of funding to give to student organizations based on a surplus they had after several rounds of allocations.
Food and drinks made up 21.51 percent of the funds allocated, while subscriptions to services like Canva and Wix made up 4.7 percent of funds and registration fees made up 4.68 percent of funds.
Nine student organizations received the full amount they requested. Of these nine organizations, Circle K International, a service organization, received the most funding at $800.
EMeRG and GWU Esports received the most funding, at $8455.55 and $8131.35, respectively.
Twelve student organizations received none of the funding they requested. Most of these funding request denials were due to SA bylaw prohibitions.
GW Program Board did not receive any of the $170,000 they requested for the Spring Fling and the GW Gala, which has historically been held at the National Portrait Gallery. The funding was denied due to SA bylaw prohibitions, and the SA deferred the funding requests to the University-Wide Program Fund.
Program Board did not appeal the denial of allocations.
SA Sen. Linsi Goodin, CCAS-G and chair of the finance committee, said the finance committee disbursed allocations to fund student organizations “as equally and as as equitably as we possibly can.” She said the process was behind due to “a variety of factors.”
Goodin replaced former SA Sen. Ian Ching, ESIA-U, as chair of the finance committee after he resigned. His resignation followed accusations that he delayed the allocations process by about two months.
Senate Chairperson Pro Tempore Demetrius Apostolis said the appeals process occurred over a nine- to ten-hour period on Dec. 11. He said the appeals process granted student organizations about $24,000 of the $290,000 they requested.
“Considering our cultural orgs and then going down the list, we really wanted to make sure that everyone was treated fairly throughout the process,” he said.
The next Senate meeting will be held Jan. 23 at 8:30 p.m. in the Continental Ballroom.

Senior guard James Bishop netted in 30 points, two rebounds and shot 7-7 from the free-throw line.
Men’s basketball defeated the Coppin State Eagles 83-71 at the Smith Center Tuesday, notching a key win in their final nonconference game at home this season before Atlantic 10 competition kicks into gear.
The Colonials (6-4) shot 45.9 percent from the field and 32.3 percent from beyond the arc against the Eagles (4-9) with consistently high-quality looks from midrange and from deep that turned a slim 2-point lead in the first quarter into a 14-point cushion by the fourth quarter. Senior guard James Bishop netted 30 points to lead the way for GW while collecting two rebounds and shooting 7-7 from the free-throw line.
Graduate guard Brendan Adams scored 18 points and grabbed seven rebounds for the Colonials, followed by freshman guard Maximus Edwards who dropped a double-double with 16 points and 12 rebounds off the bench. GW is now set to hit the road with momentum on their side for the Hawaiian Airlines Diamond Classic Thursday before entering their conference slate next month.
“It is big, any game you are able to win is a huge win, no matter who you are playing,” Bishop said in a post-game press conference. “It was a great win for us and definitely some good momentum going into the Hawaii trip, a lot of confidence from everyone in the locker room.”
The Colonials’ defense got off to a slow start in the first quarter, trailing Coppin State through the first four minutes. The Eagles got on the board first with a layup, followed by a score in the Coppin State paint by senior forward Ricky Lindo Jr.
The Eagles and Colonials exchanged a pair of 3-pointers, and the lead would go on to change hands six times throughout the first half until a 3-pointer from graduate student guard EJ Clark kickstarted a 6-point run for GW.
The Eagles netted 21 points in the first 10 minutes of the game while the Colonials’ defense struggled to keep the Eagles from stretching through the paint and netting in consecutive shots. The Colonials controlled their possessions with 10 offensive rebounds in the first 11 minutes of the first half to hang onto the ball and increase shot opportunities.
The Colonials responded with a 12-0 run that put them up by 4 in the 18th minute. GW remained ahead by less than 5 points in the final nine minutes, finishing the half with a 2-point lead, 34-32.
The Colonials shot 39.3 percent from the field and 26.7 percent from the 3-point line in the first half, a significant drop-off from their season average of 48 and 34 percent, respectively.
Bishop got GW going with a layup to kickstart the second half and led the Colonials in scoring for the rest of the game, dropping 21 points in the second half.
The Colonials grew their lead to 11 points in the first seven minutes of the second half while the Eagles went scoreless for the following three minutes. Down by 14 in the fourth quarter, Coppin State only managed to inch 2 points closer as the game ended 83-71.
After the back-and-forth affair in the first half, the Colonials’ offense pulled ahead by a steady double-digit margin for the rest of the game. Senior guard Sam Sessoms led the Eagles’ offense with 23 points, the fourth-highest scorer in the country with 23.7 points per game.
“I thought we did a good job on Sessoms in the first half,” Caputo said. “He is such a talented player. We have to continue to get better defensively. That is no secret. We got the right stops when we needed them.”
Edwards, Adams and Bishop broke out with stellar performances with Bishop recording his second-highest point total all season. 
The Colonials’ next game will be against the Washington State Cougars Thursday, which will jumpstart the Hawaiian Airlines Diamond Head Classic in Honolulu. The Cougars are ranked 66th in the country.
The Colonials will return to the Smith Center in January and start conference play against the UMass Minutemen.

This win marked Head Coach Caroline McCombs’ 150th in her collegiate career, after recording 130 victories over seven seasons at Stoney Brook and now 20 wins with the Colonials.
Women’s basketball trounced the Wilmington Wildcats at the Smith Center Tuesday, running up the score to 88-40 in Head Coach Caroline McCombs 150th career win.
The Colonials (7-5) built a 48-point difference, which marked the largest winning margin for GW since 2017 when they crushed George Mason 80-49. GW was met with little resistance from the Wildcats (1-10) while connecting on more than 50 percent of shots from the floor and shooting from the 3-point line at a .414 clip compared, up from their respective season averages of .414 and .362.
The Colonials tight defense was also constant theme throughout the whole game – the Wildcats coughed up the ball 13 times and shot a measly .291 percent from the field.
Five Colonials scored in double digits, led by senior guard Nya Lok, who netted in 19 points for a spectacular showing off the bench. Redshirt senior forward Mayowa Taiwo scored 14 points with a dazzling .875 shot percentage and recovered 10 boards, which pushed her past 600 career rebounds as the 19th player in program history to reach the milestone.
“I think we played really well,” Lok said in the post-game conference. “There’s always improvements to be made every time we step on the floor. Today I think we did a really good job of trying to do things that we practiced in practice, and I think we still have improvements of staying in the gaps. And it’s important that we keep teams below their average because we’re a defensive team.”
Freshman guard Caia Loving and junior guard Piper Macke came off the bench to start their first game of the season in place of senior guard Essence Brown and freshmen guard Nya Robertson, who were both unavailable to start. Loving and Macke netted in 11 and 10 points, respectively.
GW opened the game with a quick 8-0 scoring run while the Wildcats faced a two-minute scoring drought as the Colonials’ defense kept them from taking possession with frequent turnovers that turned into points in the paint. The Colonials never looked back after their hot start, building up a 15-5 lead before Wilmington called a timeout late in the final two minutes of the first quarter.
Taiwo made her mark early in the game, scoring 6 points to go along with four rebounds prior to the first stoppage on her way to a 14-point, 10-rebound performance that suffocated Wilmington’s interior offense.
The Colonials continued their dominance in the second quarter, scoring a season-high 32 points after a layup by Macke set off five 3-pointers by four different players, continuing a season-long trend of sharpshooting for the team.
Junior guard Asjah Inniss dished out three assists in the second quarter on her way to a game-high of 7. Lok finished the half off with a 3, extending the lead to 54-17 while the Wildcats continued to fall behind on both sides of the court.
GW continued its stifling defense into the third quarter, holding Wilmington to 4 points and forcing five turnovers.
In the fourth quarter, Wilmington outscored GW 19-12 in the final quarter, but it was not enough for the Wildcats to overcome a 48-point deficit.
The Colonials took advantage of the 3-point line, draining 12 of 29 shots from deep led by star forward Mia Lakstigala, who was four-for-eight. Shooting from 3-point range has been a point of emphasis for the team this season, improving to a .362 average from last season’s .271 clip.
The team’s shooting average was due in large part to the team’s shot selection in addition to quick, steady ball movement that found open players in the paint.
“One of the things our coaches continuously say to us is to take shots in the game that we would take during practice, so it’s not a surprise that 3-point shots are looking pretty good recently,” Macke, who hit two 3-pointers, said.
McCombs attributed much of the team’s success to their dominance in the paint, where several players were able to dish out assists for shots from beyond the arc.
“I know we are taking a lot more 3s than we have but the kind of 3s that we want to get are inside-out 3s, so that means we get a paint touch before we get that 3,” she said.
This win marked McCombs’ 150th in her collegiate career, after recording 130 victories over seven seasons at Stoney Brook and now 20 wins with the Colonials. She brushed off congratulations during the press conference, crediting her team and players like Lok, Macke and others who have come in clutch while other key players remain injured.
“They do really accept their roles, and they’re always doing whatever they can to help the team win,” she said. “So, we have a lot of players like that on the team which I enjoy coaching, and love that about this group.”
The Colonials will take on the Coppin State Eagles at the Smith Center Dec. 31 at noon.
