It is transition time for the Student Association.
This period is filled with promise and more promises as elected executives and senators are motivated by the power of their positions and the chance to make good on campaign goals.
For Student Association President-elect Ashwin Narla and Executive Vice President-elect Abby Bergren – who will become the chief student lobbyists May 4 – it is also time to decide what to preserve for next year and what to leave behind from the former administration.
Narla told me Tuesday his principal objectives are to focus on student health and wellness, create a student calendar, and drive home the need for student space.
These are laudable goals, but the pair also has much to learn from SA President John Richardson and Executive Vice President Ted Costigan’s time in office.
Advocacy does not happen in one year, so continuing to work toward several key issues that were SA focuses this year – like fees and student space – will be vital during the Narla and Bergren administration.
While students always seem to complain about fees we acquire throughout our four years, Costigan’s campaign brought the issue to the forefront of the conversation. It has been flagged as one of the principal student concerns on campus, as too many unexplained fees can ultimately disillusion students and leave them feeling as though the administration levies fees without caring about their affordability. And that’s a problem for the administration and the community. If students feel nickel-and-dimed today, they probably will not care to donate money when they graduate.
Narla and Bergren should continue to question fees levied against students and demand communication from the administration about the fees’ legitimacy. This year’s fee commission attempted to outline every fee students might face, but this endeavor proved too great. That said, the advocacy and efforts to draw attention to the issue did yield some positive results; for example, the printing fee in Gelman Library – originally nine cents – has been trimmed to seven cents. Indeed, some fees are necessary – like Student Health Services co-pays and lab fees – but without a dialogue, students will continue to feel they are footing unjustified costs.
Student space is undoubtedly another key campus issue that requires continued advocacy, and this year’s SA and Marvin Center Governing Board focused heavily on ensuring students are allotted space in the Marvin Center. But the administration has plowed forward with its plans to put offices in the student union, and Richardson and Marvin Center Governing Board Chair Dylan Pyne’s requests have been reduced to merely seeking some of the fourth floor for student organization collaboration space.
Narla and Bergren are considering student space options beyond those offered in the Marvin Center, which is promising, but they should also continue to defend the plans that SA executives and Marvin Center Governing Board student members have begun this year. The Marvin Center is the student union, and while finding student space anywhere would be ideal, there’s a reason today’s campus leaders are fighting so hard for it to be there.
Transition is also a time to leave behind a few of this past year’s initiatives.
This year, Richardson and Costigan organized town halls and spent several weeks at the beginning of fall semester collecting student concerns before going forward with plans. Reaching out to students and keeping your ear to the ground is important, but a yearlong term goes by quickly, and if Narla and Bergren keep waiting to hear from students before carrying out the platforms they were elected to achieve, it will be a waste of time.
If town halls must happen, Narla and Bergren should hold them while carrying out their advocacy efforts to avoid stalling. John Bennett and the SA Finance Committee did a good job of holding town halls efficiently in conjunction with their work, keeping the committee informed of student concerns and also relaying their progress back to the community.
The same goes for programming. Narla and Bergren were elected to be student lobbyists – not event planners.
This year, Costigan focused heavily on organizing the “Only at GW” debate series, which was not the best use of his time as executive vice president. No matter how the SA tries to justify the series, it was still programming, and there’s a whole team called Program Board dedicated to doing just that. Narla and Bergren are both heavily focused on improving student life, but they should not try to do so through organizing events or ensuring beer gardens at campus-wide events. It might be tempting, particularly as programming offers tangible results to point to, but there is enough other work for Narla and Bergren to do.
And then there’s an issue from SA administrations past that could use a revival.
Gelman Library is still abysmal. Former SA President Jason Lifton and former Executive Vice President Rob Maxim helped secure Gelman’s $16 million Board of Trustees allocation in 2011, but there is still more to be done. And while further improvements to Gelman will surely be difficult to advocate for in a year, Narla and Bergren should press the University to be transparent with the community about its operating budget and how that will go toward future renovations.
It is tough to let some platforms go and it’s tough to start some others up fresh.
But it is time for spring cleaning, and Narla and Bergren, the season is ripe for you to decide what is worth giving another polish and what is just unnecessary clutter.

Steven Knapp has launched many new efforts since his induction as the University’s 16th president, with one of the most important being his desire to build a service culture at GW.
Graduating well-educated students should be every institution’s first priority, but students who do not understand their place in society’s larger context – and their ability to change it for the better – can hardly count as well-rounded.
This is why GW’s work to create a culture of service, from first lady Michelle Obama’s community service challenge in 2009 to the annual Freshman Day of Service, is perhaps one of the most important efforts the Knapp administration is undertaking.
It is time to take this cultural change seriously by institutionalizing service for all members of the community: staff, faculty, administrators and students.
Since the first Freshman Day of Service three years ago, GW has had time to study the successes and failures of creating a culture of service at the University, and with Vice Provost for Diversity and Inclusion Terri Reed assuming leadership over the Center for Civic Engagement and Public Service in July, there should be a new vision created in which  service is not something GW does, but what GW is.
The Obama service challenge was one of the first large public efforts geared toward volunteerism, and it is still one of GW’s best examples of how the community can gather to create a better District. More than 3,800 community members logged 106,945 hours over the academic year to secure the first lady as a Commencement speaker. Not only did Colonials benefit D.C. through service, but the challenge also created a sense of community for those volunteering.
That success has been hardly matched by the University since. The much lauded – and expensive – Freshman Day of Service is annually criticized for poor organization and a lack of actual service activities for student participation. The idea behind the day is laudable, but without continued service opportunities, it only offers a glimpse for freshmen. The day should be a welcoming to the service culture of GW for its newest students, but after the freshman class returns, GW must offer institutionalized ways for each Colonial to impact the world.
But a culture of service can only be created if the majority of the community is involved. There are thousands of students who study abroad, and just as many should be involved with service on a regular basis. New partnerships like the one announced last week with the Washington Literacy Center should become commonplace at the University.
All students should have the opportunity to take at least one service-oriented class during their time as a Colonial.  This could be done by making course-offerings widespread in academic departments throughout the University.
If you give students a chance to volunteer for a cause they are passionate about and they’ll be hooked. Providing more service-oriented courses in specific fields and disciplines would allow students to explore volunteerism in their academic fields of interest. Students majoring in math or science could take courses that allow them to teach the fundamentals of their major to those who might not have access to a quality education.
But service does not only have to be a student activity.
Engaging professors and students in the community together will foster a personal, non-academic relationship.
Service could become part of the faculty tenure requirement. If volunteerism is ingrained in professors’ daily lives at GW, they will, in turn, emphasize it in the classroom.
Alternative breaks have soared in popularity in recent years, with hundreds of students signing up to volunteer across the country and globe. Other student organizations should take a hint and the University should push clubs to require all members to log a specific number of volunteer hours each semester or hold service events.
Administrators and staff – who are crucial to fostering an enduring culture of volunteerism – should receive special privileges, like better parking, for performing service regularly.
Critics might note that service should be something the community elects to do, rather than a requirement. But to establish service as a core facet of Colonial life, it must be institutionalized and incentivized.
Soon enough, service itself will be the incentive.

I have spent a lot of time thinking about the roles The Hatchet and other student media outlets play at GW. We raise questions, critique policies and applaud favorable changes.
But we can only do so much. We need to hear from you.
We need readers, listeners and viewers to engage in the conversation with comments, suggestions and critiques.
So in my final column, I challenge you, the readers, listeners and viewers, to write letters to the editor. Submit an op-ed, or phone into a radio show to discuss campus issues. Or simply leave a comment on our website.
Our campus thrives on discussion. Political, religious, sports-related and issue-focused conversations happen every day on Facebook and Twitter, in classrooms and over late-night dinners.
But these conversations often do not reach the people they should. When our fellow Colonials show support for an issue or voice concerns about a plan, the University usually takes note. Student outcry sparked Gelman Library renovations and changes to campus dining.
Our daily conversations with friends need to happen in student-run publications, so they can be recorded and remembered. A two-month-old Facebook status update on a campus gripe can only do so much. At the end of the day, student media is your forum too.
I saw the student body’s passion and potential this semester during the GW Student Media Debate for Student Association candidates. Along with WRGW and GWTV, The Hatchet hosted an event to inform students about campus issues and hold our potential student leaders accountable.
It was promising to see such a large students turn out, and as an organizer, it was even more promising to see how many students had questions for the candidates. I hope administrators who attended learned as much I did. And GW can only improve if the University is listening to the people it is here to serve: the students.
When I first started writing for The Hatchet my freshman year, I was overwhelmingly excited – but nervous – about seeing my opinions in the paper. But to be honest, I didn’t know who was reading them. I would write about sustainability or University finances, but then barely hear any reader feedback. Then one day, I was sitting in class when I received an e-mail from my editor. Someone wrote a letter to the editor about my column.
A letter. It was not from a friend. It was not from a relative. It was from a professor with whom I had never spoken. And he shared his piece of mind on my opinions about the Science and Engineering Hall plans.
The letter proved that I was not writing in a vacuum. People were listening.
As I continued writing, my columns garnered more feedback. Some received more than others – like one in which I called for a diner on campus that saw a surprising amount of support. But I hoped midnight pancakes would not be the only thing people passionately endorsed.
So I hope readers extend that passion into other issues. And you do not even have to agree with what’s being said. Submit your ideas in a letter or a comment, or a call into a radio show. People will listen. I only hope to see more feedback when I am no longer a writer, but purely a reader, listener or viewer.

Each year, graduating editors are given 30 final column inches – “30” was historically used to signify the end of a story – to reflect on their time at The Hatchet.
I’ve been saying goodbye to The Hatchet since December. I was wrapping up my degree, cramming out the last few edits of my thesis and spending my time between finals sitting at my soon-to-be former desk. I didn’t know how to say goodbye then, so I just sat and tried to soak in all of the memories that had been made inside 2140 G over the course of my college career.
In my new place on the West Coast, I still find myself sitting Wednesdays and Sundays wishing I could be hanging out with Allison and Madeline downstairs, looking for ed-ball with Lyndsey or making fun of Connor for looking like Howie Mandel. From the very first time I walked up those stairs, knowing I had made it onto staff as the arts editor, to the final time I closed the front door and walked out onto G Street, saying goodbye to being senior editor, The Hatchet always helped me move forward. But it wasn’t how much I learned about writing and editing that made the paper so unique, it was the people that I met along the way who truly made the difference.
Lauren, if we somehow end up working together again, I’m just going to accept it as a sign from above. You are one of the strongest women I know, and I am continuously amazed by how far you have managed to take us as a paper. You were always patient with me and so supportive. I can’t imagine having a better experience at the paper without you. As a friend, I will always love and respect you, and as a leader, I will always believe in you. You faced considerable odds, but you triumphed. The Hatchet will always be better for having had you to keep it together.
Lyndsey, you have always been able to keep things positive, and I love you for it. From Skee-ball to Froggy, to Justin’s to belting out whatever song we could come up with, we have had some wonderful experiences together that I will always love and miss. I wish you the best, love.
Annu and Priya, I will always appreciate you both being there for me last year, and for being such a positive influence on so many people at The Hatchet. I wish you both the best of luck next year. It’s up to you to keep the paper strong.
Josh, Cory and Madeline, you three brought smiles to my face more often than that kitten video Allison always made me watch. Josh, I loved being able to see you go from my writer to a contributing editor. You made me very proud. Cory, I’m so glad we got to work together again. You have truly shined. Madeline, what can I say? I just have so much respect for you as a Hatcheteer and as a woman, and I know we will always see each other again. I love the three of you dearly.
Dev, so I probably broke your phone. I admit it. And I definitely made fun of your Droid obsession a bit too much. And your Krispy Kreme stock. And your love of pink drinks. Don’t hate me. Besides, we’ll always have Angel.
Doug, I have been waiting for this moment since I met you: I just lost the game.
Gabe, I still don’t know how you managed to catch me every single time I was making a face at something, but you did. You are a tank and a genius, and I’ve loved every minute we could spend together.
Jordan, hey buddy. You are such a bright spot in so many lives. Your work is incredible. Your personality is beautiful. Watching you chase after Cloud is still one of my favorite memories.
Francis, I love you and your ability to fall asleep in a locked room like clockwork every time I was over. Learning how to pick a lock was too much fun. I genuinely wish I could be as cool as you.
Michelle, I don’t think I will forget our time at The Red Palace. That entire night will go down in history as one of the most uncomfortable and awkward situations of my life. I am so glad you were there to experience it with me.
Andrea, you are the only person I would ever have wanted to deal with for that security story. You are an inspiration and an amazing writer, and I am so confident that you will go so far in your life. Good luck!
Allison, I miss you terribly. You have made my life better just by being in it. You make so many people at The Hatchet smile and enjoy themselves, and I admire that about you. You have kept me honest and together in spite of everything. You have yelled at people for me, and stood up for me and laughed with me when I got hurt. We have complained about everything and somehow remained positive. We’ve thrown things at each other, bought Nerf guns, nearly gotten arrested, gone to Lindy’s when I was leaving at 6 a.m. the next morning and made fools of ourselves in Whole Foods more often than not. I have had more fun with you than I have with anyone else, and I respect you so much. You are a math and prodo genius, but you have remained humble in spite of it all. You’re my best friend, and I know you will always help to keep The Hatchet together. Love you!
Mom (and Cloud), thanks for putting up with the late nights and the bleary eyes and the tired phone calls. Thank you for believing in the paper and in me. You have always been my rock, and I am so excited to see what happens next and to tell you all about it. Cloud, well, you sure left an impact on the townhouse.
To those in Volumes 107 and 108 who I couldn’t mention, you all got me to where I am today. You taught me so much and inspired me constantly. Every single one of you has made an impact on my life, and I will always remember you and our time at The Hatchet.
For me, the paper was more than just my experiences. It was more than turning the arts page into the culture page, more than covering inspiring students and more than being amazed at the stories that were generated by my writers. It was about the looks on so many of the faces of people who came into the townhouse and simply enjoyed being there.
Whether you were my close friend, my writer, my contributing editor or my co-worker, I want you to know that I appreciate the time we had, no matter how little it might have been. Even if you might not have known it, you made my college career something I will always cherish. You helped make The Hatchet more than just a student org – more than just a college newspaper – you helped to make it a home. I will always be thankful for that. -30-

Each year, graduating editors are given 30 final column inches – “30” was historically used to signify the end of a story – to reflect on their time at The Hatchet.
This came so much sooner than I ever expected.
Days ago, I was finishing my thesis for a major I never expected to have, working, searching for a cat for this photo – failed – and wondering when I even had time to write this. I was bitterly resentful of the broken fast-forward button that somehow put me here.
Time has literally flown. I strolled up to The Hatchet table at the Colonial Inauguration student fair four years ago, thinking that four years would be an eternity. I knew that I was going to find a way to work on the school newspaper, hopefully designing it.
What I would soon realize is that it was one of the best decisions I ever made.
I still cannot comprehend how so many incredibly talented and impossibly dedicated people have produced 236 issues since that time. It is mind-boggling to think back on the time spent with those people.
Within weeks of starting freshman year, I was training as a production assistant. I sat downstairs in 2140 G and began learning the wondrous world of InCopy and workflows. I didn’t know anyone on staff and did not even have another freshman partner-in-awkwardness.
I stopped worrying very quickly because the staff was so welcoming and friendly. I got to know them – to understand their jokes, quirks and dynamics. Coming on to staff and growing comfortable with others is nearly inevitable – you see them almost as much as your roommates – especially if later, they become your roommates.
On production days, the more I saw, learned and practiced, the more I loved designing. I still do and always will, regardless of where my career path leads.
Gradually, I became used to the weekly pattern of losing all free time Wednesdays and Sundays, avoiding early classes Mondays and Thursdays and eating at the GW Deli an infinite number of times, because it’s the closest place. It was a routine – to be sure – but a comforting one.
After five semesters on prodo and eventually becoming production manager, I went abroad for a semester. When I returned this year, it was to a different role on staff: special issues editor. I both edited and designed the special issues, and reviewed them on prodo days as well, so each one was time-consuming. I challenged myself to be more creative than ever with designs, and ultimately seeing a polished final product to be proud of was rewarding.
I had joined The Hatchet expecting to happily churn out page designs forever. Then suddenly I had my first byline, and found myself working with writers, editing, proofreading – and I enjoyed it. I appreciate immensely the skills that both roles have given me.
Secretly, though, I am still a designer at heart. I’ll never fully leave behind the semi-unstable office chair parked in front of a prodo computer.
I don’t regret a single minute of my time on staff, or any other way I have spent my time at GW. For the inordinate amount of hours I spent at The Hatchet, sorry I’m not sorry.
There is no way to adequately address here exactly what four staffs of The Hatchet, outside friends and family have meant to me. So here’s one sorry: for half-assing all the thanks I wish I could give. I would need another whole thesis to do them justice.
To Natalie, Erica and Abnos – Prodo was a microcosm of my first feeling at home with The Hatchet in general, and that’s entirely thanks to you guys and your amazing work. I could never have hoped to learn half of anything I know now without such talented mentors and friends.
Natalie – I think I got all the sass I have from you, since you first proved that it could come in small packages and rule over everyone else (even Roper). I always admired you for knowing everything and somehow having the patience to impart it to others.
Erica – You and I had quite a ride together, and did it all alone more than a couple of times. And I’m not referring to anything inappropriate, or that time we were both Britney Spears (although that was hot). The townhouse isn’t the same without your bright, smiling and laughing self, but I count our prodo nights together as some of the best memories.
Abnos – You were the first friendly face I talked to at the CI student org fair, so thank you for your warm welcome. It hasn’t been quite as fun since your talented page designs, random outbursts and joke headlines left 2140.
Justin and Tim – Thank you for both being, at various times, many things: jokesters, friends, great listeners, understanding and sassy people and definitely also good talkers. I don’t think either of you fully realize what a stabilizing and positive force you were for so many people on staff. But I’ll never forgive your incessant jabs about my slow eating habits.
French – Your ability to continue such a high caliber of work with endless energy for not one, but two years, is something that will always astound me. Your own work, as well as pushing two staffs to produce their best work, has resulted in a great product. I can’t believe we are here now, but congrats on finishing one hell of a two-year run. I imagine you have done so while secretly watching more cute videos of baby animals than you let on.
Allison, Cory, Lauren and Madeline – You all have done amazing things above and beyond what any previous prodo team has. Plus, there could not be anyone more of a joy for staff to work with. I know they like your tunes. Allison – Keep up the amazing work. I know that you will always be exactly as great as you want to be. Cory – I’m still sad prodo couldn’t keep you, but The Hatchet will always benefit no matter which team you work for.
Teams photo and multimedia – I am at a loss for words at how consistently visually stunning your work truly is. I’ve seen work in past years, recent years and a combination of the above, and couldn’t begin to compliment you all individually. I would actually need a novel to thank so many of the very most talented individuals I know.
Michelle – In particular, you are amazing. Time and time again you have proved that talent, kindness and kicking ass are your M.O. Never change.
Doug – I simply must have your friendship always, for the “meows,” and because you are one of the best people I know. I can haz?
Connor – I don’t care what anyone says, I take all the credit for hiring you to staff for prodo. Therefore, I saved the Internet by proxy. You are great, and please never stop laughing.
718 – My heart has stretched a million times since you all became friends in my life. Everything is simply happier with you guys around, and I simultaneously respect you and love you more than I ever thought possible. Lyndsey – Our friendship is one of the best things The Hatchet has given me. You have killed it at every role you’ve taken on, and made working here a pleasure for others. Wherever we are in the future, if it includes Bernie-ing and whale-speaking, I wouldn’t hate it. Annu – Hatcheteers are lucky for being so very well-developed next year, I know it. So does #linda. I love you, our friendship and our constant laughter endlessly. You are my sunshine. Priya – You will be stellar next year. Don’t ever forget your wonderful passion: It’s the best tool to keep in your belt – besides maybe a portable coffee maker.
To anyone who has ever been an anchor for me outside of The Hatchet – you know who you are, and I could never thank you enough. One “rock” for most people is probably enough, but I’ve been fortunate to have many. Thank you in particular to Alex Feigin – I’m so happy we found our friendship in London. To Mom, Dad and the rest of the fam – your support has never faltered, and your encouragement means more than you know. I love you.
I have never, and never will, regret any happy memories from the last four years. An unbelievable amount of them are related to The Hatchet.
Sorry I’m not sorry. YOHO: You Only Hatchet Once. I’m so glad I did. -30-

Each year, graduating editors are given 30 final column inches – “30” was historically used to signify the end of a story – to reflect on their time at The Hatchet.
They call me a slayer.
And by they, I mostly mean Doug. I don’t remember when my nickname arose, but it’s had incredible sticking power. Every time I hear it, I remember why I love being on The Hatchet: the only institution that rewards enterprise reporting with a moniker so violent.
From the second I walked into the townhouse, I recognized the dedication that goes into making the newspaper. I knew already that I wanted to be a part of it. I thought I knew how cool all the editors were, until I found out they spent their weekends editing.
But once I got a taste of the grind, I couldn’t stop. Running on just a few hours of sleep became normal; thinking in news articles developed into a constant habit and talking to sources more often than my friends didn’t seem strange anymore.
And once it does stop, I won’t know what to do with all my time. After all, I especially didn’t know how to write my final piece.
I thought back to the assignment that introduced me to the person that would become my best friend, back to the late-night trips to Ivory, back to the days of running from one interview to the next. I thought that it was all over.
But the photos on the walls tell me that it doesn’t stop. For 108 years – soon to be 109 – it has kept going. Even though there’s only one more issue left for me, only a few more weeks until GW is no longer my home, The Hatchet will still be there. It won’t be mine anymore, but I will still belong to its circle of alumni.
That is what makes all the hard work worth it – knowing that it will live on in bound editions, knowing that a staff member will become an icon like the ones I hear about now and knowing that my relationship with The Hatchet is not over.
To my walking companion: French, you have an uncanny ability to instill both fear and love, but your talent as a mentor has pushed me to become a better journalist. While your standards seemed impossibly high when I came in, I have confidence that the next news team can exceed them going forward.
To my other half: Team Campus News Wednesdays brought us together, and I hope we never lose touch, no matter how far across the world we end up. Chelsea, you helped me get through thesis-ing, editing and jaunting across Europe. Your tenacity is something I hope to emulate. If you only live once, don’t let anything get in the way of pursuing adventure.
To my exploring companion: Gabe, you have been there for me like no other friend, and I only hope I can return the favor. Even though you never covered my shift, I look forward to reading your dissertation in a database one day.
To someone who always wants to do more: Ferris, your drive is almost scary. Somehow, you manage to stay on top of everything and never get tired. I know the senior news legacy of keeping the administration in check is in good hands. Keep on slaying.
To my adopted roommates: Priya, Annu and Lyndsey, you always make me smile. Your room became my second home, and I hope you keep a spot open for me to come visit next year. Never stop being that sunshine for The Hatchet.
To the only one who understands my academic jokes: Cory, keep making me proud. I can’t wait to see what you accomplish.
To someone who constantly impresses me: Turley, I always consider it a successful prodo if I can make you laugh. Your energy inspires me to be half as good a writer as you.
To the judge of my quote-gathering ability: Doug, your impressions of sources have gotten me through the worst of prodos, and your invention of my nickname encourages me to live up to it everyday.
To team photo and prodo: Your creativity makes pages of text look beautiful and fulfills the twice-weekly miracle of making jumps fit.
To team sports: Traynor, your passion for what you do is apparent, and your blogging puts team news to shame every time.
To copy: We will get to IHOP one day. You two totally deserve it.
To my actual roommate: Julianne, you listened to tales of drama and tedium, but always reminded me that there is a world outside The Hatchet. Thanks for keeping me sane and showing me what true dedication looks like.
To Volume 108: Thank you for making the townhouse my favorite place on campus. -30-

The first thing that jumps out while walking into Wicked Waffle is the sign that reads, “No butter. No syrup.”
For those of us who smother our breakfast in dairy and maple syrup, the philosophy at Wicked Waffle is a bit different. Rather than serving food in traditional breakfast fashion, this shop makes waffles suitable for any time of day, offering breakfast waffle sandwiches until 11 a.m. and a lengthy list of lunch options.
When I walked into the shop, apprehensive about the concept, I was greeted by orange walls, checkered ceilings and friendly employees. The shop prides itself on the healthiness of its waffles – only 235 calories each – along with their freshness and premium quality ingredients.
I chose the natural smoked turkey and French Brie waffle sandwich ($8) and a large soup ($4.99).
One particularly helpful employee allowed me to sample the four varieties of soup while my sandwich was prepared. I decided on the puréed wild mushroom with fresh herbs, which had a strong, yet pleasing mushroom flavor and a wholesome consistency.
Meals are served in takeout boxes, as the shop’s limited seating is suited for on-the-go eating, but my friends and I found a spot outside on the orange and black cubes that serve as tables. While these substitutes for proper furniture worked for college kids, I have trouble imagining more mature clientele being comfortable.
Setting our woes aside, my friends and I were eager to take our first bites. My turkey and Brie sandwich came with sweet maple mustard, adding a bit of spice to the standard combination of ingredients.
Surprisingly, the waffles did not add much to the meal. I almost did not notice that my favorite breakfast dish replaced the bread. The waffles themselves were crispy and tasty, adding a light and crunchy texture to an otherwise average sandwich, but the meat and cheese flavors overwhelmed the delicate treat.
The waffle twist was a more positive addition to the $4.95 bacon, egg and cheese waffle sandwich. Perhaps it was its nature as breakfast food, but this combination did a better job of incorporating the waffle flavor with the rest of the ingredients.
Naturally, a waffle dessert followed our waffle lunch. Selections from the Sweet Treats menu are served all day and are sure to satisfy even the strongest sweet tooth.
A simple, classic option is the sweet waffle with melted chocolate and powdered sugar ($4.75). More complex selections are also available, including a waffle topped with strawberries or bananas, chocolate sauce and your choice of caramel cream or whipped cream ($6.95).
Wicked Waffle’s unique sandwiches might not blow visitors out of the water, but their cute idea puts a satisfying spin on the breakfast treat so many love.
